“Work never ends, does it sweetheart?” Tony says ruefully and he goes to pick up the phone, completely ignoring Steve, once again.
“When we both know who really owns you.” Steve says, then reaches around Tony’s neck to grab his chin, tilting his face backwards until he was forced to look into Steve’s eyes.
“Shower, then brunch?” Steve asks softly as he observes the face in front of him, and Tony responds with a nod and an easy smile, looking at him with rare, open admiration it took Steve a long, long time to earn.
“Both of you,” Tony moans, and Bucky and Steve moan at the prospect. One day, Steve hopes that the Lord could take the both of them. That way Steve could feel his lover’s cock against him as he pressed into his other lover’s ass and physically become close to the two most important men in the world at the same time. Yet, Bucky’s cock is thick as hell—Steve remembers from when it went up his ass, numerous times before they met Lord Stark— and Steve’s cock is all around huge, and both of them together may accidentally hurt Tony more then he can handle. Perhaps if they were ever able to do this in a bed, then Steve can really take his time.
His head ends up next to Tony’s neck, and he kisses down his spine absently, before pulling out and falling on his ass into the grass, watching Tony’s hole as it fights to close.
“Ms. Potts!” Tony’s eyes go wide for a moment. Pepper is Tony’s advisor, assistant, and closest confidant in all things related to his learning as the new master of the Stark household, and she’s currently sitting on the desk, legs spread wide. The other redhead, the one on the ground, jumps up quickly, and then, catching sight of Tony, stands in front of Pepper immediately.
"That should get enough attention." Said Tony, who was sitting in the front seat. "There will be news about it in at least three pages of the Washington Post tomorrow."
Tony looked into Steve's eyes. Once again, he was lost in the blue ocean, as if he had fallen into it for the first time. Once again, like a drowning man, he had forgotten how to breathe... But he couldn't...
"I'm glad you like it. Now let's go inside and I'll help you with your shirt. I'll make sure it's clean."
Tony located the armor base according to the phone. By the time he arrived, Zimmer was a corpse. The armors were destroyed, the mainframe was invaded, apparently by intruders who stole the designs.
"We can go back to the Mansion together or you can go back to the campus if you don't want to see Avengers..."
"Tony, you know very well, you know very well that there is a third option, the option to keep Iron Man and Captain America alive, and Tony and Steve."
"The magnetic interference in this area is blocking communication, even if it’s you can't solve it in such a short time, that is why you rushed straight to the base. Besides, Captain America and Spider-Man are busy right now. It will take a while to get here.”
"I have a little implant in my chest, this little poison, hydride, just filters out." Tony replied with a smile. "Are you sure you just want to know the answer to this little thing? I've prepared a long speech to expose your plot, Spymaster, or should I call you Coop."
"No, Thor, not you." Tony said. "You are our back hand. Once its shell is broken, we have to neutralize the chaotic space-time energy. We must transform from those who possess space-time energy themselves. You're very old, probably thousands of years old, no offense, and you have traveled through time many times, so you're one of the highest providers."
At that moment, a pile of masked ninjas jumped out of the bushes. A row of shuriken struck the mask girl. The girl clearly did not expect an ambush, but she reacted quickly, dodged the shuriken and knocked down two ninjas in front of her. But these ninjas clearly expected her skills. They came up behind her and raised their arms. In the meantime, a bunch of green smoke flew from ninjas’ cuffs toward the girl. The girl struggled but fell down eventually. See what happened, Tony dropped the sticks. He thought of his watch, but it was too late. The green smoke came into him. Tony fell down, too. The ninjas took two captives, jumped into the bushes and disappeared.
“This is the New York Fire Department. We’re preparing to get you out. Is there anyone else in there with you?”
Tony glanced up to see the call waiting screen. He’d only met with him… some time ago. What did he want now?
The man is attractive, there’s no doubt about that. Under different circumstances, like at a bar, Steve might’ve gone for it. Like this, though? It doesn’t seem right.
. He was floating as pleasure filled his entire body. It burned through his mind until there was nothing else.
Steve proceeded cautiously, shield held out in front of him. Whatever had been contained in the chamber had been strong enough to break out of the fairly strong glass keeping it inside. Steve wiped away some nervous sweat as he advanced into the room. This was starting to feel like one of those sci-fi movies that Tony had made him watch every other week.
Tony flinched for a second, then glanced away quickly. “Well, sure, but… I lost my wallet and that’ll make things a bit of a pain in the ass.” He rested his head on his hand against the window. “Would rather put off dealing with all of that.”
Steve recognized the machines from back at home, though the toys in this one seemed far more impressive. “Nah. These are scams, aren’t they?”
He pushes back into Steve’s embrace and lets out a content sigh. Steve mumbles something into his ear, and before Tony knows it, the world is shifting around him until, disoriented, he finds himself in Steve’s lap. They’re sitting on Tony’s discarded jacket, he realizes. His legs are covered by Steve’s discarded shirt, keeping them warm. Steve wraps his arms around Tony in a strong embrace.
“Tony, Tony…” he gasped into the pillow that was already damp with sweat and saliva. “I’m so close.”
Steve shakes his head. “Nah, I took the subway. I’ll just… see myself out.” He glances back toward the door to the office suite before he realizes he isn’t even sure which way that is. “How do I get back to the lobby, again?”
Tony glared at the screen in front of him. JARVIS had been harping on him for avoiding sleep for the past… well, he really had lost track of time at this point.
Steve glanced away despite himself. “What, go drag him out of the lab like you suggested the other day?”
Steve doesn’t look convinced but doesn’t say anything. Instead, he starts a slow march through the snow. It’s knee deep by this point, and Tony notes as he looks around that Steve’s right: it’s snowing and the cloudy sky above seems to promise even more.
His unease must have been written all over his body language because Tony moved to close the distance between them.
“Good!” Tony closed the diagram. “So you still want to try, right?” He glanced up at Steve slowly in an expression that Natasha had once dubbed ‘the puppy dog eyes.’
“You’re perfect for me, Tony, so perfect,” he repeats as he speeds up his thrusts. His balls are already drawing up, both heavy and tight as they brush against Tony’s ass. “I’m so close. God, Tony, you feel so fucking good.”
Steve could only nod. Whatever Tony wanted to do, it had to be good. Steve trusted in that more than anything right at this moment.
“You are?” Steve couldn’t help asking. Now that his arousal had rekindled, he found himself getting antsy.
Steve did as he was told, pulling his shirt off of his head and tossing it off to the side. “And?” Steve asked, looking down expectantly.
Steve’s gaze flicks up to Tony. He looks relaxed despite how out of place he is on the old couch. It’s still hard to believe he’s serious. Part of Steve wonders if he’s dreaming. As he’s considering his reply, he remembers what Bucky said a week ago.
“Huh.” There was a pause that felt ominous to Steve.. “Can’t believe I didn’t think of this earlier! It just might work…”
As Steve left the examination room, he started wondering exactly what might be going on in Tony’s head right now. If there was one thing he’d learned in the months he’d worked with the man, though, it was that such a question was one of the universe’s greatest mysteries.
“Huh…” Japan really was something else. He turned to the policemen who were watching them curiously. He bowed awkwardly and offered the formal way of saying thanks that he’d learned during his preparations for this trip.
Tony’s not sure what to say. What would Pepper want him to say to encourage someone who wants to work at the company? “You should be good. HR’s always on top of stuff like that.”
Steve sits down on the edge of the cot and sets his arms on his thighs. “This is going to sound ridiculous.”
Steve laughs nervously. “It’s not a big deal, Mr. Sta… er, Tony. I’m starting to think that maybe…” He runs a hand through his hair. “Maybe it’s for the best that I don’t apply for the position after all.”
Steve couldn’t help laughing, though it sounded delirious and almost manic to his ears. “Tony, you’re really something else. You know that?”
Tony turned away from fiddling with something off to the side to face Steve. He had that manic expression that Steve associated with Tony lacking sleep. “Absolutely not.”
“I’m okay,” he insisted as he kept struggling with his underwear. “Just… just need to get out of these.” He let out a little giggle despite himself. The creature was crawling even lower with its other end now.
Tony stared at the scene on the screen in a mix of mute horror and something else he didn’t want to admit to quite yet. JARVIS assured him that the readings of Steve’s vitals that he was seeing did not indicate distress. Rather, he seemed to be experiencing intense sexual arousal. Then again, he didn’t need to read Steve’s vitals to know that.
“Nope. You never let me mope around when I felt like shit. Gotta return the favor.” He grasps Steve’s leg tightly. “So, what’s up?”
“Good. I don’t think we have time to check the wreckage of the jet.” Steve crosses his arms, though it also looks like he’s trying to keep himself warm. “We’ll have to find shelter.”
“I can handle it,” Steve insisted as he turned toward the door. He had that determined expression that Tony was all too familiar with by now. Steve shrugged before saying, “Serum, remember? I should be okay.”
Shaking his head, Tony kept laughing. “You must be rubbing off on me.” He ran a hand through his hair before turning away. “Let me just get a few things ready and get a new pair of gloves.”
“I… huh.” Steve’s not sure what to think. It’s not like he’s angry. He hadn’t really expected to hear back from them, all things considered. “I mean, it’s not a big deal. It happens, right?” He turns toward Tony.
Steve couldn’t help a nervous, almost hysterical chuckle as he did his best to comply. “I’m starting to wonder just what the hell I signed up for.”
Eventually the man stirred, his eyes opening slowly. Steve was taken aback for a moment. Even as unfocused as they were, the man’s eyes were striking. A deep brown with eyelashes that stuck out. They seemed so expressive, even now when the man seemed to be barely conscious.
Something nudged his cheek, causing him to look up. It was the creature’s mouth or whichever end—Steve had lost track at this point—again. Steve knew what was coming next. His hands were still occupied holding his legs open, but the creature accommodated him by moving in closer to his mouth as it started secreting that sweet fluid again. He moaned in pleasure as he lapped up more of the sweet flavor.
Steve shook his head. “Not for the past day or so.” He pushed away from the table and headed for the door.
“In that case...” He patted the curve of Steve’s ass lightly. “Does that mean you’re ready for round two?”
Steve’s response was cut off when the egg finally passed through the resistance of his entrance. Relief washed over him, so strong it was almost like an orgasm in and of itself. He glanced up at Tony, who smiled at him. Or at least, it looked like a smile. The edges of his vision were fuzzy, and he felt oddly detached from his own body. It was nice, though. Like he was floating and everything was just flowing through him.
“Tony,” he said as he pulled back reluctantly. He almost lost his train of thought when his eyes caught how swollen Tony’s lips had become. “Shouldn’t we… take this somewhere else?”
He eyed the door leading out of the chamber. JARVIS was monitoring Steve’s vitals and Tony’s suit had picked up no signs of any strange organic life when he’d scanned Steve. Steve was fine. And would continue to be fine. He didn’t need Tony watching over him like some creepy stalker.
When their lips meet, it feels like all of the tension of the last few minutes—no, since back on the jet—has finally reached a tipping point.
Much to Steve’s annoyance, Tony just rolled his eyes. “We’re on a mat in a gym, what better place is there? I can have the place locked down in seconds if I need to, anyway.”
And anyway, as he got a better look at it, it didn’t seem to be immediately threatening. At the moment, it was slowly advancing toward him, its antennae waving rapidly back and forth in the air.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he finally reached his own reserved place at the end of the room. Keeping the dead weight of the man’s body balanced with one hand, he reached for his key card in the other and swiped it over the lock to open the door. The door opened with a soft click and Steve hooked his foot into it to nudge it open.
Steve moaned around Tony’s cock even as tears filled his eyes. Tony’s words felt like hot coals pressing against his skin. Meanwhile, the bug continued to cradle his cock with one end and rub over his sensitive nipples with its other. Held as tightly as he was, all he could do was squirm and take whatever Tony gave him.
“Whoa, whoa, calm down,” a deep voice said as a hand landed on Tony’s shoulder. He flinched, and backed into the wall, turning onto his side. From this vantage point, the whole place looked sideways. “I know you’re probably confused right now.”
Tony raises one hand up and waves his hand in what he hopes Steve interprets as a signal to keep going.
Shaking her head, Natasha turned her face toward the gym’s large windows. “I think that’s enough for today.”
He feels the mattress shift a bit before Steve says, “It’ll be tight, but I’ll go slow. Is that okay?”
“At this point? Probably not.” Steve thinks back to what Tony, or rather, Mr. Stark’s assistant had told him on the car ride back home. She’d seemed understanding about the whole thing, and sure, sometimes crazy shit like this happens. Mr. Stark was adamant that everything was consensual, which it was… but still. How could he start working at the company after that? How could he even go back into that building? “Definitely not,” he corrects.
“Like I said,” Bruce repeats. He reaches across the table to pat Tony on the arm. “Life is too short. I’ve never really known you to be the risk-averse type.”
This time, Tony does shake his head. Shit, did his heats always start out like this? Was it always this bad on the first day? It’s been so long since he had a natural heat, he can’t even remember.
“Will they vibrate against your prostate?” Tony asked with a laugh. “Sure. Wouldn’t be nearly as fun if they didn’t, right?”
“Well, could’ve done worse, I guess,” Tony mumbles to himself. Steve was pretty damned hot. It wasn’t like they’d talked much, but he’d
There’s the sound of slick skin against skin, the mattress shifts, and then there’s a pressure pushing at his entrance. He lets out a moan before he can stop himself when the head of Steve’s cock pushes past the ring of muscle. Steve’s fingers felt big enough. Now, it feels like Tony’s being split in two. But god, it’s good. It’s so fucking good. Tony’s always been a size queen and Steve is just
“Right… Well, I don’t think the creature was necessarily hostile. Given what little information I’ve been able to gather, I think it uses that pheromone to attract a mate. Whatever its species biological makeup is, it can handle its effects far better than any human…” Bruce drifted off and shook his head. “Er, nevermind. What’s important is that I didn’t see it attack Tony. He seemed very… agitated as he engaged with it, to be honest.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair in frustration as he looked over the holographic diagram. It looked like he’d need to build a new version of the suit to implement the kind of foolproof seal he was looking for. That meant going back to the drawing board, which would take a week at least…
Steve’s laughter turned nervous. With Tony, chances were that he’d walk into the workshop the next day and find Tony working on an actual fucking machine.
Steve squirmed against his bindings. He looked lost in a haze of lust as his bleary gaze met Tony’s. “Please, Tony… I’m so close, I can’t take it anymore.”
“...Oh.” Steve wasn’t sure of how to feel about that. Had the creature attacked Tony as he tried to rescue him?
Steve drifted off a bit more, just barely paying attention to the sound of Tony preparing things off to the side. Tony’s hand on his abdomen forced him to focus his attention again.
The man looked puzzled for a second. “I’m not trying to steal your organs, geez. And keep it down, would you? If anyone else hears us, we might both get kicked out.”
Bruce glanced around, at which point Tony realized that he’d left his coffee mugs lying around. Wow, he’d really been slipping these past few days.
He mostly zones out aside from making sure Steve stays on the route he charted out in the HUD. There’s a persistent ache all along his back, which he knows isn’t a good sign. The cold temperature is probably acting like a giant ice pack. Tony can appreciate that, but it’s not so great for Steve. As always, Steve grits his teeth and doesn’t show any outward signs of discomfort. Tony’s known him long enough by now that he’s learned that even Steve has his limits, though. Not to mention that this cold can’t be pleasant for him.
As he’s watching the numbers on the elevator rise, he notices his leg shaking and has to stop himself. Even worse, he can feel the first signs of his ass loosening up as it prepares to produce slick, and it’s driving him nuts. When the elevator finally arrives, he breathes a sigh of relief and practically dashes inside.
He mashes the garage sub basement and close door buttons at the same time and retreats to the far side of the car once the doors have closed. As the numbers count down, he turns to look at the gorgeous view of the city below through the tinted one-way glass of the elevator wall. Usually, he’d find the sight relaxing, but right now it’s hard to concentrate. Despite the building’s many air filters and perfectly controlled climate, he’s sweating more than usual. Tony reaches up to loosen his tie, but ends up just untying it and sticking it haphazardly into his suit jacket pocket.
It took him a few moments to untangle himself from the sheets so that he could sit up. Once he had his back against the headboard, he let himself relax as he slipped his hand under the elastic of his boxers. He should’ve been ashamed, but he couldn’t help it. The dream had been so vivid and he could still see it so clearly in his mind’s eye: Tony gazing down at him with feigned indifference as he fucked Steve’s face with abandon.
Tony sighs, long and heavy, when Steve finally removes his fingers, which leaves him feeling surprisingly empty. Considering how long Steve took, Tony can’t help wondering just how big he is. He supposes he’ll get his answer soon.
Distantly, he realized that he hadn’t heard Tony for a while. Maybe he wasn’t worried anymore. Steve hoped he wasn’t. He felt so fucking good, and he wanted Tony to feel this way, too. After adjusting to the rapid, unrelenting pace of the twenty-first century, it was nice to just let go like this. Now that Steve thought about it, keeping this to himself was selfish. He bet Tony would enjoy this, too. He and Tony could enjoy this together. Maybe he could watch Tony get himself off. Or maybe… maybe Tony would let Steve get him off. With his hand or his mouth or, or—
Steve presses a soft kiss against his forehead. “Go to sleep. You’ll need some rest. And then we can work on getting out of here.”
“Tony...!” he cried out softly. The warm metal of Tony’s gauntlet gripping his arm was reassuring. “I…” It was hard to keep speaking. He was so, so tired, but he wanted to at least tell Tony how he felt. “...want you,” he managed to whisper, his voice strained. And then everything went black.
“It’s a fairly recent discovery, according to the medical journals I’ve been reading,” Bruce explains. “And I mean, people always had their own lay theories about the phenomenon.”
Honestly, he wasn’t sure what to think upon seeing the setup that Tony had been hyping up for the past week. It looked like a cross between the examination tables he’d gotten used to in SHIELD medical crossed with a dentist’s chair. It also had a bunch of crazy and quite frankly intimidating attachments built onto it.
He tried to find some leverage, so he could really fuck into Steve, and found that the alien creature’s soft body surrounding them was just perfect. Placing his arms on either side of Steve, he started to really go to town. The way Steve’s insides trembled and clenched around his cock was downright heavenly. He wasn’t going to last long at this rate.
“Well, if it makes you feel better…” Steve was back to rubbing the back of his neck—that was also flushed—as he considered his next words. “It didn’t… It didn’t actually hurt?”
The way Steve was lapping up whatever bizarre fluid the creature was secreting was bad enough. The fact that the creature’s head, or what seemed like it anyway, looked rather suggestive. Well. The mental imagery was unavoidable.
“Very sure,” the man answers. He bares his throat again, but this time Steve can tell it’s deliberate—an omega showing submission to entice an alpha.
The man shrugged. “A capsule hotel. I found you passed out on the second floor trying to break into the woman’s area and get yourself arrested. You said you’d lost your keycard, so I did the only thing I could think of.”
Tony blinks a few times. That definitely isn’t what he was expecting. “I’d tell you that you should’ve brought this up ages ago if this is some super secret strategy of yours?”
He practically carries Tony to what turns out to be a lumpy cot on the other side of the small room. After he carefully sets Tony down, there’s a rustling noise which Tony assumes is from him gathering his supplies. He returns a minute later and sits down on the mattress next to Tony.
me,” he said to himself as he gave up all propriety and practically broke the zipper getting his pants open.
Steve shook his head vigorously. He did want this. Not to mention that he’d already prepared and had a butt plug shoved up his rear. There was no way he was going to waste all this effort. “No, no. It’s not that I don’t want to do this.” He wasn’t sure exactly why he was hesitating, to be honest. “I guess it’s just… I just want to take time to ease into things?”
Tony went into an explanation of his plan for finally satisfying Steve’s supersoldier libido. Since he clearly got off on the feeling of being full, Tony claimed that he was going to use the nanotechnology for exactly that purpose.
For once, Tony actually looked bashful as he ducked his head. “Could say the same about you, big guy.” He seemed to hesitate before asking, “So… is that a yes?”
Steve took a deep breath and then let it out. “I can only imagine what you saw back there.” Oh god, his ears were starting to burn just at the thought. He couldn’t resist reaching back to rub the back of his head sheepishly. He tried telling himself he’d faced far worse than an embarrassing conversation with Tony Stark. “While the situation was out of my control, I was still very… indecent.”
To be honest, Steve wasn’t sure of how to answer right at the moment. Now that the pressure had abated, he realized he was fully hard. The sensation of its pushing had been tense, but the way it had forced itself past the tight ring of muscle felt good, too. The pressure was still there, though, as whatever had been pushed into him seemed to be moving slowly.
“Easy for you to say,” he gasped out. “Just... give me a second.” He focused on relaxing his whole body. Once he did that, the egg slowly started to ease its way through. “Oh god,” he said as what felt like the widest part passed through him.
Tony froze, which was already a dead giveaway. Just the mention of his name made Tony think back to how Steve had sounded when he was begging the alien bug for more, when he was overcome by pleasure.
Steve went easily, allowing himself to be pushed until his back hit the front of the table. He pushed himself up onto it automatically, leaving Tony standing in the vee of his hips. That also meant that Tony had a nice view of the bulge in his sweatpants.
Once he was on his back, he noticed Tony pull something out from underneath the table’s surface. They turned out to be padded stirrups that folded out from the base of the table. Tony directed him to scoot forward and raise his legs up so that he could secure Steve’s legs and feet in the stirrups. Like this he was on display with his ass right there for Tony to see. Tony moved around next to direct Steve’s arms to the straps on the sides of the table.
He hears the sound of something being opened and some rustling before Steve says, “This might be a bit uncomfortable, but I’ll take it slow. Okay?”
And Steve was so close, too. Tony was riding out his orgasm, fucking Steve’s face while the alien kept working Steve closer and closer…
He was still staring down at the neat, folded leather in disbelief. He could see Steve’s smug grin out of the corner of his eye. As he started to go through it, he realized that everything was there. “Driver’s license, credit cards, even my cash… wow,” Tony said, finally glancing up at Steve. Even his black Amex was safely ensconced in its pocket.
Funny that Bruce should mention Steve. Images rushed back to Tony’s mind unbidden: Steve in the throes of ecstasy, begging Tony to take him. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’ll talk to him when I’m done with this.” He glanced up to find Bruce still looking skeptical.
His breath hitched when the increase in pressure in his abdomen seemed to hit him suddenly. It wasn’t long before the sensation was incredibly strong and everywhere at once. A slight cramp flared up, making Steve gasp—only to elicit a moan a few seconds later as it somehow added to the pleasure that was already building up low in his gut.
So he lets Steve keep going, his mind going slow and sluggish as he relaxes a bit more and focuses on the warm pleasure settling in his core. Distantly, he’s impressed at how Steve has seemingly no refractory period.
Bruce nodded. “The serum did its job of handling the effects of the pheromones, but your body could only handle so much. So yes, the effect was strong… but it wasn’t life-threateningly so.”
“If you put them inside me…” Steve couldn’t help feeling off-kilter. “How… are they going to come out?”
Chuckling, Steve smiled up at Tony. He was beautiful like this. Naked and so open for Tony. Even with the alien creature surrounding them, all Tony really cared about was Steve. Tony couldn’t resist leaning forward to kiss him. When Steve moaned enthusiastically into the kiss, Tony let it turn filthy as he sped up his thrusts into Steve’s welcoming heat.
Steve blinks a few times as the words register. He steps back and gestures to the couch that serves as the divider between the kitchenette and living room. “Sure. If you don’t mind the mess…”
Meanwhile, the creature’s countless other legs were constantly fondling him from his perineum to his balls. As its other end hung in the air above him, its body undulated against his groin.
He’s gratified when Steve keeps going. As the moments draw on, Tony wonders to himself hysterically, if this works via the other end, too? Tony
Tony’s gaze slowly drifted up to Steve’s face. He looked pensive. The fact that he was quiet was definitely a bad sign.
The thing was, Steve enjoyed getting fucked. Absolutely loved it. While he was thankful for the strength the serum had granted him, sometimes he wanted to let go. Tony had recognized it, too. The way that Steve naturally took charge in the field. How Steve sometimes just wanted to get away from that in his down time. In bed, he could trust Tony to take care of him. To direct his considerable strength toward the purpose of their mutual enjoyment.
Steve shook his head, though that didn’t help clear his mind at all. He still wasn’t sure why Tony sounded so worried. A path of burning pleasure seared across his shoulders and his chest as the creature’s legs continued to wriggle against his skin. The pleasure continued down his back as the creature continued its path downward. It was like a really good massage multiplied by a hundred.
Bucky huffs out a breath, sounding annoyed. “Okay, there is definitely something you aren’t telling me, here. You mind clueing me in? Something happened after the not-interview?” Bucky shakes Steve’s foot. “Come on, man. You know you can tell me anything.”
“He’s fine. Just angry about the whole situation.” He offered Steve an apologetic smile. “You know how he is. He tends to blame himself even if he doesn’t have control over what happened.”
Steve could feel his face heating up again. He wasn’t even sure how he could be embarrassed after all of this, yet here he was.
Tony’s gloved hand was back on his thigh. “Relax, champ. Just some sterile gel that’ll ease the way for what’s coming next. And believe me, you’ll want to be ready for that.”
Tony slowly ran a hand down Steve’s leg to his ankle as he circled around to his front. “You’re irresistible like this, you know. Well, you’re always irresistible. But…” His gaze met Steve’s and the fire in it made Steve shudder with anticipation. “Right now I just really want to ride you.” He hopped up onto one of the supporting steps below the apparatus so that he was standing over Steve. He glanced down at him with a predatory grin. “And you’re going to lie there and let me enjoy your big, fat cock, aren’t you?”
Tony closed his eyes for a moment. If there was one thing he hadn’t gotten used to, it was the sheer force of Steve’s sincerity. “You’re too sweet, Cap. Really.”
Considering his predicament, Tony couldn’t exactly blame him. It was the millipede-like alien creature from the other day. Steve was already naked, pieces of his uniform discarded on the floor around him. That alone would have been bad enough, but…
“God, Steve, you look so good like this,” he said, his tone breathless as he ran a hand across Steve’s cheek. “Were you waiting for me this whole time?”
“Whoa whoa whoa, wait a sec.” Tony stepped toward him and placed a hand on his shoulder. Not that he could stop Steve in any meaningful way. “We’re not 100% sure what we’re dealing with here. JARVIS is working on sealing up the Mark 43 and then I can head in.”
Tony hesitated for a moment before answering, “No. Tell him that he can contact me if he needs anything.”
Which isn’t possible when he’s run out of his goddamn suppressants. He had dug through the workshop earlier, found nothing, and then remembered that he sometimes kept some in his rarely used office. So he came up here for a few meetings, hoping to grab his suppressants, only to find himself at 6 PM on a Friday with his heat coming on and not a prescription bottle in sight.
Steve wanted to protest. To tell Tony that that wasn’t true. But the only word he could seem to form was, “Please…”
Steve puts down the paint brush and scrubs a hand over his face. He’s running up against a deadline, but he’s run into a block he just can’t seem to get past. Glancing over at the clock, Steve realizes it’s starting to get late. He gets up, stretches, and heads out of his room-slash-studio for a drink.
Steve reached for a complimentary bottle of water kept by the sink. “You’re probably gonna have a killer hangover in the morning, so you might want to drink this.”
“Just taking a break,” he said as way of explanation as he dropped to his knees and then into a crouch. “Don’t worry about me.”
“Glad you enjoyed it,” Steve murmured. He could feel the corners of his mouth stretching into a weary smile. Now that he’d pushed the last one out, exhaustion hit him like a truck. “‘m gonna take a nap now.” The last thing he saw before closing his eyes was Tony’s soft, fond expression.
“You’re damn right, I am!” Tony tried to think back to the night before, but he came up blank. He remembered drinking way too much at shabu shabu with his clients. After that was a giant blur, though. Served him right for getting drunk off of his ass in a foreign country. He held up his hands. “Look, I don’t know what you want from me, but I’m really attached to my organs. I can spare a kidney at most, but that’s it.”
Steve opened one eye just to get a sense of what Tony was about to do. He walked around to where Steve was precariously exposed with something that looked like a hose in his gloved hands. Steve wondered if he should ask but then thought better of it. He flinched at the first sign of something prodding at his hole and then quickly relaxed like Tony had told him to.
Tony doesn’t have the energy to argue with him. He barely even flinches when he feels Steve’s slick finger against his hole. He even starts relaxing as Steve gently circles his finger around the ring of muscle.
“Of course, Sir.” Another holographic screen with the relevant information appeared next to the one monitoring the lab.
Steve thanks the man before heading out of the room, his portfolio clutched tightly in his hand. Once the office door shuts behind him, he has to resist the urge to slump against the wall. Sarah Rogers, God rest her soul, would never have stood for her son slumping his shoulders just because of a little setback. Even if he feels like crap, he needs to hold his head high as he marches home.
“We haven’t even gotten started and you’re about ready to go off, huh?” Tony’s hand that had been on his thigh moved down to caress the curve of his ass. “Don’t worry, I’m almost ready.”
The touch of a hand on his cheek caused him to open his eyes again. He glanced up to see Tony staring down at him. The disgust was still there, but it was mixed with something else.
“Which means?” He could have asked JARVIS to replay the recorded footage, but he wasn’t exactly keen on reliving that moment.
The softness in Steve’s expression as he moves to help Tony out of the armor registers in the back of Tony’s mind. Looking back, he feels guilty about getting into an argument with him on the jet. Now that Tony thinks about it, he can’t even remember what they were even arguing about. Probably something stupid.
He went ahead and removed his gloves, too. Now that his hands were free, he noticed how much the hazmat mask was digging into his skin; so he reached up and removed that too. He took a full breath and let it out with a sigh of relief. The air was just fine, anyway. Better than fine, even. It smelled… pleasant. Soothing, in a way. Like that massage parlor that Tony had taken the team to once.
“Cap, I fucking swear I’m going to bust in there and drag you out myself if you don’t say something.”
He groaned when Tony raised his gloved hand to his mouth to lick off his come. “Mmm, that was so sexy to watch, honey. You have no idea.”
Once he was safely on the platform, he stopped to take a deep breath and look around. The station was a lot smaller than others he’d seen, which he was thankful for. It made finding the proper exit easy. From there, he had to walk a few blocks to his hotel.
Tony’s relieved when they hit the copse of trees that he had detected. His scans indicated signs of a large structure, and sure enough, it comes into view once Steve’s wandered a few feet under the trees. Tony glances up to see what looks like a small cabin.
He made some complicated hand gesture, which changed the hologram to something that looked like… an egg?
Tony continued to move it around while murmuring praise; saying how good Steve was at taking the plug. How nicely stretched his hole was. He pulled it slowly, stopping for a bit at the widest part, seemingly listening for Steve’s harsh breathing. Steve cried out when he finally pulled it loose with a wet pop.
Tony shrugs. “Well, yeah. Pretty sure there’s a bunch of rules about not dating employees.” One corner of his mouth turns up.
He glances over to see a second elevator in the sublevels and the third out of service. “Remind me why I didn’t have a private elevator installed?” he asks his AI.
They both rested there for what felt like a long time to Steve. He was still pretty far under. The only thing really registering at the moment was the heat of Tony’s skin against his own and the unrelenting fullness in his abdomen.
“Gonna need this later,” Tony explained as he spread it around with his fingers across Steve’s oversensitized skin.
Cradling his chin on his hands, Tony leaned forward on the table. “You’ve got that right, sunshine.”
“Fuck, you’re huge,” Tony says breathlessly. He pushes back against Steve on his next thrust and they both moan in unison.
The first brush of its legs against the oversensitive head of his cock was like nothing else he’d ever felt in his life. He cried out wordlessly and came again, hard. As though sensing his pleasure, the creature closed its legs around his cock to cradle it between its legs and its underbelly as it continued to raise itself into the air above him.
Steve had heard about rimming. If the Internet was good for anything, it was informing him of what SHIELD’s uncomfortably detailed course on twenty-first century sexual norms had omitted. He hadn’t imagined that it would do much for him, but now? He was starting to reconsider.
Steve couldn’t help smiling at the pet name. “Amazing.” Except there was something that felt off. “But um… I’m kind of thirsty.”
As if on cue, Steve felt yet another egg-shaped object push against his entrance. He cried out again as it pushed against the tight ring of muscle. Even after having been eased open by the first one, it took a bit for the second to reach its widest point. By then, Steve was moaning, his eyes shut as he tried his best to allow the intrusion.
They stay there for awhile, Steve gently rolling his hips as his cock continues pumping come into Tony. His knot shows no signs of going down, but Steve can’t bring himself to care; he feels high on pleasure. Tony’s words are mixed with moans as he tells Steve how good his knot feels, how full he feels, until his words slur into incoherence. Every now and then, Tony comes again—the way he ripples around Steve’s cock like Tony’s body is milking his come out of him, unable to get enough.
He turned around a bit to check on Steve again. The man was still out like a light, though he was breathing steadily. The suit’s HUD reported that his heart was beating at a normal rate and Tony breathed a sigh of relief.
In any case, the man was clearly out for the night and without somewhere to stay. He hadn’t found a wallet or any identifying information on the man, and his clearly very advanced cell phone was locked to a fingerprint. The few moments of lucidity he’d gotten out of the man didn’t give him much to go on, either.
Eventually, Tony ended up dragging Steve into his frenzy as he tried to ask shopkeepers questions about various things. Steve did his best to translate for him, though sometimes it seemed like the language of electronics nerds transcended all barriers.
He does what he can to make it easier for Steve to remove his boots. As Steve gradually works his way upward, Tony remembers how he’d shown Steve where the latches in the armor were so that he could help in case of an emergency. And here they are in such a situation.
Steve nodded and gave him a thumbs-up. “Thanks, Tony. I appreciate it.” He turned toward the door and opened it quickly with the manual override.
Steve starts mentally going through the bills for the month: what he can pay now and what he’ll have to defer yet again. Even if he somehow had gotten the job today, he probably wouldn’t have been able to start until next week. Who knows when his first paycheck would even clear? There’s most likely another long conversation with his landlord in his future. Sighing, he leans against the wall closest to the elevator panel.
He’d ended up deciding to take a long trip for Christmas and the New Year. After saving up for a few months and budgeting carefully, he’d snagged a cheap Shinkansen ticket and headed up here. Even with the fast ride, though, the day had been long and now he was looking forward to settling down for the night in the hotel he’d reserved a “room” in.
“But you can have this one,” Tony said as he held up a golden retriever plush. It was really cute. “Reminds me of you.”
Tony was taken aback for a moment before he realized Steve was messing with him. They both broke out into laughter before going back to their food.
That gets Tony’s attention. He shifts against Steve’s chest so that he can ask, “You’ve done this a lot?”
It wasn’t long before the alien was wrapping around Tony, bringing him closer to Steve. Tony groaned as his orgasm started to build.
Steve turned to him with a small smile despite the seemingly dire situation. “Just takes me a lot less time to suit up.”
Steve glances down at his khaki slacks and the old leather shoes he’d salvaged with leather restorer as he considers the man’s words. It isn’t the end of the world, but it’s definitely disappointing.
This had to be one of the weirdest conversations Steve had ever had in his life. “And this… won’t hurt?”
Throwing his head back, Steve moans as the overwhelming warmth envelops his cock; it’s almost enough to make him come right away. He moves his hands to Tony’s hips and grips hard as he starts to push all the way in. Steve closes his eyes without thinking as he focuses on how Tony feels all around him: his slick inner walls are loose enough to make the slide easy, yet tight enough to provide some wonderful friction.
“Holy shit, I think I’ve heard about this place…” Tony’s feet were stepping forward seemingly on their own. He turned to look at Steve. “I know you wanted to get on the subway, but can we stop here? Just for a bit?”
In retrospect, Tony blames the fact that he and Steve were in the middle of a rather heated argument for him not noticing the first warning of an approaching missile.
As Steve continues to fuck into Tony and the quiet elevator fills with the sounds of slick skin against skin, he knows he isn’t going to last much longer. Tony’s hole feels like it was made for his cock. It’s the best sex he’s ever had, but dialed up to eleven.
He was covered in sweat, and even that felt different. It was like he could feel each and every droplet across his skin as he relaxed in the creature’s embrace.
Tony waved a hand as though dismissing the billion-yen deals he was supposed to be negotiating. “Yeah, but it’s pretty boring, to be honest. Stuffy meetings while I listen to old dudes drone on about technology they barely even understand.”
Steve huffs out a breath and starts to cross his arms before stopping himself. He turns toward the fire. “Let me just add some more wood to the fire, first.”
Shaking his head, Steve continued on. “What matters is that you saved me back then. And I’m sure Bruce told you that the alien’s pheromones would’ve been too much for anyone else.” He couldn’t help a small smile. “I’d rather go through a bit of embarrassment than let you get hurt.” He froze for a second as he realized he’d said ‘you’ instead of ‘a teammate.’ Well, people always did tell him he was honest to a fault.
Tony couldn’t blame him, considering what he knows about Bruce’s past. “I feel like you’re trying to tell me something.”
Tony would shrug, but moving seems like a bad idea. “Snow’s kind of taking the edge off, to be honest.”
Tony’s shift from project planning mode to mischief was as plain as day as he leaned back against a workbench. “It’s supposed to be a surprise!” he answered in a sing-song voice.
Sighing, Tony stepped back away from the door. “One second.” He ran toward the other end of the room, took something out of a compartment, and ran back to Steve with it in hand. “At least put this thing on. It won’t protect your eyes or any exposed skin, but it’s better than nothing.” He handed over the partial hazmat mask that Tony and Bruce kept stocked for such situations.
“Fine,” the man said stubbornly as he reached up and tried to grab for the bottle. His hand missed by a few inches before falling back to his side.
When they stopped in Akihabara to transfer to another train line, Steve noticed Tony stop dead in his tracks. Following his line of sight, Steve caught sight of a ton of signs for electronic stores and even a giant department store boasting their electronics department. Tony’s eyes were wide like a kid who’d just discovered a candy store.
“Only if I get to watch,” Steve added with a small smirk. He was gratified when Tony nearly choked on his own breath.
Steve knows he should stay away, but he can’t bring himself to. Even when he closes his eyes, it’s like every other sense is pointing a dozen arrows at the omega. He feels like an animal trapped in a cage. When he opens his eyes, the man is curled over himself.
Tony watched in horror as Steve proceeded to remove his undershirt while the creature crawled over him. He needed to get Steve out of there.
Tony stepped back away from the door. It led to a sealed chamber between the current room and the larger lab, but Tony wasn’t taking any chances.
Tony lets Steve take the lead because anything that uses his back muscles would just be painful at this point. He went commando, which means that he’s completely naked without the undersuit. He can’t even summon up the energy to feel self-conscious as Steve finally removes it.
When Steve turns Tony back to face him, his eyes are wide and his mouth open slightly. At that moment it hits Tony that Steve really
“You basically are!” Tony’s hand moved away from his cock and up toward his chest instead. Steve swallowed his moan of protest at the loss. That would just encourage Tony to keep being stubborn. “Haven’t had the time to work on that fucking machine I mentioned a while ago, but the design in my head is complete.”
Tony woke up gradually in the way even his partially awake brain associated with hangovers. Groaning, he turned over only to hit something hard. That was odd… He was reluctant to open his eyes considering the pounding headache, but something was definitely off. Despite all of the weirdness, though, he was on something soft and he didn’t feel as bad as he expected to feel, all things considered.
The room settles into a calm quiet that’s only interrupted by Steve’s grunts as he continues to push into Tony.
Tony’s upward slide was just as good as his muscles clenched down on Steve’s cock as though reluctant to be empty again.
Tony leaned forward. “Mmm, yeah, that is settled in there real nice, isn’t it?” Steve flinched when he felt Tony’s hand on his ass cheeks. “Used one of the medium-sized ones, too.”
Tony smiled down at him. “You can still feel it moving inside of you, huh? Like I said, it’s peristalsis—all those circular gastrointestinal muscles contracting to push it through you. So you’ll feel it the whole way through.”
“Are you fucking kidding me?” he says as he slaps his forehead and lets his head fall back against the glass wall.
Bruce shrugs. “I mean, there’s always cases of alphas and omegas getting a bit too enthusiastic when stuck in a confined space for too long. And you said it was consensual, so…”
“You look like you could use something to help you take your mind off of everything.” She smiled at him and nudged her head in the direction of the now broken cable machine. “And unlike that machine, I’m much harder to break.”
Steve feels Tony’s inner walls start to contract around his cock and distantly realizes that Tony must have reached his climax. Undeterred, Steve continues to chase his own pleasure, enjoying the added stimulation as he rolls his hips. It doesn’t take much longer after that—he cries out as he comes hard inside Tony.
Steve nodded again as he let his head sit against the headrest. “Do your worst, Stark.” He already so full, but he wanted more than anything to keep going.
“Perfect,” Tony practically purred. Steve nearly jumped when he felt Tony’s finger prod the base of the plug. “Though we both know you can fit much, much bigger in you, don’t we?”
He didn’t notice anything at first. Tony just kept idly stroking his stomach as he peppered kisses over his chest. Occasionally his hand would stray up to tweak one of Steve’s nipples, which would make Steve writhe in his restraints. Maybe that was why he didn’t notice things sooner.
“Not helping,” Tony grumbled under his breath before swiveling around on his chair to face Bruce. “Well, you’ve got me. What’s up?”
Steve groaned, the thought of pushing everything back out making his cock twitch and stiffen up a bit. He was so exhausted; just taking in everything had taken so much out of him. He could take the easy way out, and he knew Tony wouldn’t think any less of him for it. At the same time, though, he couldn’t ignore the challenge in Tony’s voice. He opened his eyes to find Tony looking at him expectantly, his eyes heated with excitement. He wanted to do this, just to prove that he could. Even if it wouldn’t be easy, he knew it would be enjoyable.
Falling back onto the pillows, Tony gave into the endorphin rush. Unfortunately, his brain was quickly waking up from the haze of sleepiness. It wasn’t even surprising when the rush of guilt hit him like a ton of bricks.
Tony shook his head. “Of course not. Just… working on making sure it can’t happen again. Taking precautions.”
Steve wraps one hand around Tony’s waist as he deepens the kiss. He slides the other around the back of Tony’s neck, making sure to avoid his back. It’s like it’s automatic for him; to make sure that Tony is comfortable. The realization makes warmth bloom in Tony’s chest as he lets Steve lick into his mouth. He had wondered how it would feel to kiss Steve, and he’s gratified to learn that he kisses with a passion and intensity that takes Tony’s breath away. He’s seen Steve’s knife-sharp focus in a fight or on a mission. To have all of that on himself is something else.
“So you’re going to inject them into me…?” Steve wasn’t sure he liked the idea of being a guinea pig again.
Steve quickly locks the door and then joins Tony on the couch. He’s hit with a sense of déja vu—this whole situation feels as surreal as everything in the elevator did. Just thinking back to it makes Steve’s face warm. He’s been trying not to think about it all week. And now he’s sitting next to the man, though thankfully without the overwhelming omega scent accompanying him.
He distinctly remembers yelling some expletive before spiraling out of control toward the ground. Thankfully, Tony still has the presence of mind to bank into a decent enough landing; if plowing through a few feet of snow at a low angle can be considered decent. He turns so that he takes the brunt of the impact, Steve clinging to him like his life depends on it.
When Steve opened his eyes again, Tony was standing in front of him and pulling on white latex gloves as he turned toward a tray off to the side. Steve could just make out a container of some indistinct substance before he closed his eyes again. He’d rather not know too much about how all this worked. Instead, he focused on easing up and letting himself just enjoy this. Tony would take care of everything, and he trusted Tony to make this good, as bizarre as it all was.
He finally convinced himself to chance a look back at the screen. Steve had gone quiet, and Tony needed to make sure the creature didn’t suddenly decide to eat him or something.
He was surprised when Tony brought a crazy straw to his lips. It seemed like a bit much, but he was grateful all the same. Steve savored the sensation of Tony running his fingers through his hair as he emptied the bottle. After Tony took the straw away, he let Steve rest for a bit before he came back to the table and patted his knee to get his attention.
“Yeah. This isn’t your usual blackout. It’s city-level.” Tony glances out at the cityscape, which is unsurprisingly darker than it was a few minutes ago. “Emergency crews will be busy taking care of lots of situations like our own.”
It was like nothing else Steve had ever felt in his life. He writhed against his restraints, the stimulation almost too much to handle. Whatever the object was, it was like it knew exactly what he needed. He cried out again as he came hard, his release spattering his chest and belly. The orgasm was intense as the thing inside of him seemed intent on driving him insane. Finally, the vibrations ceased as Steve came down from his climax.
Now, though? Who knew. Tony was avoiding him for a reason that Steve couldn’t quite figure out. Was it guilt?
...Tony’s hand was on his dick before his eyes were even open, he was so turned on. It only took a few strokes to get himself off to the quickly fading memory of Steve writhing underneath him.
Hopping off the table, Steve adjusted his shirt that had ridden up a bit. As relieved as he was, something else was bothering him.
“Oh, yeah, this is a design I’ve been working on. No idea how Natasha got them out of the workshop, unless…” Tony ran a hand through his hair. “Wow, yeah. They both really got us good.”
“Considering how boneheaded you both can be, we decided we should take a different approach,” Natasha said as she stood up. She reached up to her ear. “I’ve got him secured. How’re things on your end?” She nodded once before saying, “Good.”
The rest of the day went much better and Steve managed to keep his mind off of his worries. By the time he was ready for bed, though, the silence of his room and the muted sounds of the city allowed some of his wayward thoughts to wander back.
Next thing he knows, Steve is leaning over him. He looks worried, but Tony opts instead to focus on how ridiculous he looks with snow clinging to his eyebrows.
He heard Tony sigh heavily before Tony reluctantly turning to face Steve again. Tony raised an eyebrow. “Yes, Cap?”
Steve nodded, though he wasn’t sure if Tony could see it. “I-I can.” He took a sharp breath when Tony pulled on the plug a little.
Moving seemed like far too much effort at the moment, too. His muscles felt like liquid, yet heavy at the same time. He was content to just lie there and let himself be, for once. Tony’s fingers carded through his hair gently, and it felt so good it traveled all the way through him. He groaned as his toes curled under the sheets.
“Ah, yeah, that’s it. I am so fucking ready for you, Steve.” Tony pushes back into his touch. “You like what you see?”
Tony scrubs a hand over his face as he sits back in his very expensive, ergonomic office chair and laments his existence.
“That’s good to know…” Blondie sighs and slumps further against the wall. He glances up at Tony. “How was it when you started here?”
Tony’s eyes darted toward the locker rooms like he expected Natasha to jump out any second now. “Wouldn’t want to get on Big Green’s bad side,” he mumbled. His shoulders slumped forward for a moment before he recollected himself and turned toward Steve.
“Good.” Thank god he’s able to dodge that bullet. If anyone tries to make Tony sit in a room for yet another meeting, he will lose it. From what he can remember, he’s got a few hours before the symptoms get really annoying, but he’d rather not take any unnecessary risks.
“I’m not too worried about it. I’ll let Tony be Tony for now.” He opened the door and turned to Bruce with a smile. “And thank you, Doctor Banner.”
Well, sure, he supposed they were the reason the were both together now. “I’ll get them some chocolates.”
“Oh, uh…” Steve’s nostrils flare involuntarily, which only draws in more of the sweet aroma. Warmth quickly builds up in his cock and then spreads to the rest of his body. “S-sorry?”
Between the intense pressure in his abdomen and the feeling of Tony sinking down on his cock, Steve couldn’t even bring himself to form words. It felt like there was hardly any room in him left for air, let alone wasting any of it on speech.
It wasn’t painful—the last egg had ensured that he’d be prepared for this one—but the pressure was still immense.
Steve woke up feeling lethargic, every muscle in his body lax. His sense of his surroundings filtered into him bit by bit: the warm, soft bed sheets and blanket surrounding him, the solid thigh his head was leaning against, and finally the soft pressure of someone caressing his scalp. He could hear faint vibrations, which meant Tony was probably on his phone and they were probably in bed. He must’ve been out for quite some time.
“I didn’t find anything unusual looking at some samples under the microscope,” Bruce said with one of his half-smiles that was meant to be reassuring. “Though I’ll have to do some more tests to be sure. Those will take at least another day.”
Steve finally gazes up at the man behind the desk. “Uh, sure. I appreciate the notice and all that.” He runs a hand through his carefully styled hair. “I’ll definitely be looking forward to hearing back from you guys.”
“Yeah…” Steve answers absently, as he trails his fingers down Tony’s ass to the back of his thighs. “Liking it a lot.” He moves his hands back up and squeezes the firm cheeks a bit. That earns him a nice, long moan as a fresh coat of slick rushes out of Tony’s entrance. “You’re so perfect,” Steve blurts out without even thinking about it.
Steve laughed at the wonder in Tony’s voice. “Well, like you said earlier… there’s more where that came from.”
“Mmm, yeah,” he responded lazily as he continued to work his pants off. It was getting a bit difficult with the creature pushing against him, but he finally managed it. With his pants gone, all that were left were his white boxers soaked with precome. He always got so wet, and now everything was turned up to eleven. He reached for the waistband.
After he closed the shutter for privacy, he maneuvered himself awkwardly to lie parallel with the mystery man. It was going to be a bit uncomfortable for sleep, but Steve had slept in worse conditions. He checked over the man once again to make sure he was okay. Steve had managed to get a glass of water in him, but that was about it. Otherwise, he just seemed to be black out drunk and sleeping it off.
“I’m not gonna be mad at you if you didn’t get the job, man. I mean, I know more than anyone how hard you worked for it. But sometimes these things don’t work out, you know?”
Tony rubbed at his nose, wondering if his workshop was dustier than it seemed. That’s what he got for putting DUM-E on dusting duty.
Tony narrows his eyes. “Is this person the only person in the whole world who I’m super compatible with? Or what?”
Tony was in Bruce’s lab again, which in itself wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. What was strange was how the lab’s alarms were going off. His first thought was to ask JARVIS to summon his armor until he heard something or someone from the next room over. He headed in that direction. The rest of the lab was in a surreal haze as he walked through it.
Now that Bruce mentioned it, Tony had clearly found the time to meet with Bruce as soon as he’d returned to the tower. Yet JARVIS had claimed he had an important deadline keeping him busy.
One end of the spiral that Steve hadn’t even noticed before moved. Before he could step back, he reflexively brought his shield up to block what turned out to be a spray of some sort of liquid substance. His shield blocked most of it, but it splashed off the edges and hit the skin on his neck and the exposed fingers of his other hand.
After settling back, Tony started unceremoniously removing his shirt. He moved onto his pants next. Even in his post-orgasm haze, Steve couldn’t miss how impressively Tony’s erection tented the front of his briefs. Tony turned to him with a sultry look before slowly pulling them downward. His cock sprung free, already fully erect and flushed red. Just the thought that Steve had done that to Tony without even touching him was enough to make him moan.
“What the hell?!” he couldn’t help yelling out as he backed against the wall. Except the way was too close and didn’t give him much room to maneuver. Tony wasn’t one to get claustrophobic usually, but since when did he wake up locked in a tube with some random person?
He resisted the urge to cover himself. That would only make it more obvious. If he’d been flushed before, he knew he was beet red by now. Maybe talking here had been a bad idea.
It was as honest an answer as he could think to give. He imagined he’d be feeling full, but he never could have imagined
Steve didn’t waste another moment and started pushing again. He groaned as he felt yet another object move through him until it passed his prostate, at which point he gave into the overwhelming pleasure that burned through him, from his core to the tips of his fingers. He was beyond oversensitive by now, yet his dick didn’t seem to care: it was already half hard and seemingly ready for another round.
“Sorry,” Tony said as he kept his attention on Steve’s ass. “Just seeing if I can make it easier for the next one.”
At that, Tony actually looks somewhat bashful as he glances away briefly. “Well… it’s my fault that your interview got cut short. So I figured an in-person apology was the least I could do.”
As Steve stepped into the lab, he took a quick look around. Aside from the alarms going off, the place didn’t seem any different from usual. He hadn’t spent much time down here—it was more Bruce and Tony’s space than anyone else’s—but he remembered the layout from the last time he’d been down here. As he stepped further into the room, he also noticed that the air in the lab didn’t seem any different. Of course, it wasn’t like he should expect any biological agents to be visible.
The magnetic force ceased and the shackles clicked open, freeing Steve completely. He rolled over and was on his feet in a moment.
As Steve pulled Tony close by his shirt collar and kissed him for what felt like the thousandth time that night, he couldn’t help grinning against Tony’s red, swollen lips.
Eventually, a crackling noise brings Tony out of his haze somewhat. He’s confused at first until he glances toward the elevator panel.
On the screen, Steve had just torn his own underwear apart and was jerking himself off. He didn’t even seem to notice as the creature started wrapping itself around him. Hell, if the audio was anything to go by; the more the creature crawled over him, the more he was enjoying himself.
Steve couldn’t help the deep groan as he shut his eyes at that. He felt his cock twitch as his eidetic memory helpfully brought up images of all the times he’d let Tony tie him up.
Tony’s fingers deftly undid the button and then the fly on his slacks. He was in such a hurry he almost tripped over his pants as he pushed them down and stepped toward Steve. His boxers were next. He didn’t even bother with his shirt once he finally stood over Steve.
He was about halfway up the first flight when he heard a noise coming from the second floor landing. He stopped for a second and sure enough, he could pick up what sounded like a low moan. His instincts told him to hurry up, and he took the rest of the steps quickly. Steve wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but a man in a suit leaning against a door wasn’t it.
Tony kneeled down beside him. “Look, Cap, I’m not one to kink shame. But I didn’t design this gym for testing out your bondage fetish.”
He had expected to spend Christmas by himself when he’d planned this whole trip. And sure, it would’ve been lonely, but he’d told himself he could live with that. Yet somehow he’d crossed paths with Tony, one of the most amazing people he’d ever met. The past day almost seemed like a dream. The wreaths and ribbons and other assorted Christmas decorations all over Akihabara only added to the dream-like feel of everything. It wasn’t that he felt like he was at home, though. Rather, it was an exciting mix of nostalgia and excitement for something new and the joy of having someone to share it with.
Steve threw his head back, eyes closed. His throat was exposed, and Tony’s eyes followed his Adam’s apple as it bobbed. He couldn’t resist leaning forward to mouth at it as he slowly pulled back out of Steve.
Tony’s eyes were half-lidded as he glanced between Steve’s face and his ass. “I might have to record this some time. Fuck, you’re gorgeous.”
“I’m good for tonight. I mean it.” He could let it go down on its own. It was uncomfortable, but he’d live.
An uncomfortable silence started to stretch between them as Steve realized he didn’t really know the standard operating procedure for the “you’ve been intimate with an unidentified alien creature and we need to make sure you’re okay” talk.
Steve reached back to pat Tony’s side. “I’m not going to die from lack of orgasms, Tony. Really, it’s fine.”
“Mmm?” Tony asked as he pulled back a bit. He glanced up at the clock above Steve’s head on the wall. “Oh yeah, guess it is.” He pressed a kiss to Steve’s chin before moving down to his neck. “Merry Christmas to you, too, Steve,” he murmured into Steve’s neck.
Steve felt like he was burning up from the inside. His skin was electric, every touch magnified by a hundred. Whereas the creature’s countless legs had looked unnerving before, he couldn’t get enough of them now. Even with his uniform and undershirt removed, it wasn’t enough. He wanted more. It wasn’t long before his cock hardened to the point it was tenting the fabric of his uniform pants and straining against it. He’d never unfastened his pants so fast in his life. The second he managed to pull his zipper down, he let out a sigh of relief. The end of the creature, now cradling his neck and shoulders, brushed against his cheek as though encouraging him. The contact sent another wave of pleasure through him and he moaned.
“I’m here until the weekend,” Steve said as he dug through his duffel. “I have my days planned out, but it’s not all set in stone.” He glanced up at Tony, looking hesitant. “So you’re… really here for business?”
Suddenly everything fell into place to form a finished puzzle in Steve’s mind. He took two bold steps forward and grabbed Tony’s shoulder, stopping him in his tracks. Tony glared up at him, but Steve didn’t let that stop him.
He dropped his shield before he even realized what he was doing. The loud clatter of the metal hitting the floor made the creature freeze for a moment before it resumed its path toward Steve.
What he hadn’t been prepared for, though, was the after work drinking culture. See also: fucking sake. The kind they’d had at the shabu shabu place had been some high quality stuff that looked like water. The flavor hadn’t been much, but it’d left a nice after taste in the mouth. Tony hadn’t realized just how much he’d had until he was face down on the table, his limbs like lead. When he’d finally summoned up the energy to look around, he saw all of his colleagues similarly knocked out. Fan-fucking-tastic.
Steve groaned at Tony’s words. His cock had flagged a bit when Tony had started strapping him to the table, but now he was getting hard again.
The terrible joke was worth it to watch Steve almost choke on his melon soda. Tony couldn’t help a soft smile as he gazed at Steve over his fries. He was probably giving him some serious bedroom eyes, and he couldn’t help it. Passing the time with a regular person and not in stuffy, super formal meetings was a nice change for once. Sure, Tony wasn’t a stranger to living in the public eye, but the past few years ever since he’d taken over the company after his parents’ death had been nothing but putting on a fake face for the world. Here, in this chain restaurant off the main road in Akihabara, Tony felt more like himself than he had in what seemed like forever. Despite having only met the guy in the strangest circumstances less than a day ago, Tony felt like he’d known Steve for years.
Despite how worn out he felt, Steve almost forgot how to breathe when he looked up and saw Tony’s expression. He looked entranced as he stared down at what must be Steve’s gaping asshole.
“—and all that…” Tony’s eyes narrowed. “Excuse me?” He tilted his head to the side a bit, like Steve was a mathematics problem he hadn’t figured out yet.
He can’t remember the last time he’s been this turned on during his first time with someone. He barely even knows this guy, yet all he can think of is burying his dick inside him. Like he’s been waiting his whole life for this moment. His hand trembles a bit as he moves his thumb to pull at Tony’s hole, which gives nicely as Steve pushes inside. He pulls back out and pushes two fingers inside instead, enjoying Tony’s hitching breath as he stretches him.
Steve shrugged. “Can’t think of a better time. Pretty sure if we don’t talk things over right now, Natasha and Bruce are going to wring our necks.”
The omega rolls his eyes at him. “Ya know, if we’re gonna do this, we might as well be on a first name basis at the very least, huh?” He raises himself on his elbows and offers Steve a lopsided smile. “I’m Tony. You?”
Steve agrees, but he’d rather not give Bucky more fuel. He pushes away from the table and stands up. “I’m gonna go for a walk.”
Steve stood up as he pushed his duffel back in and turned to Tony with a small smile. “Yeah, sure. Like I said, my plans for today are shot.”
“Good,” Steve said as he settled his hands on either side of Tony’s head. “Now, where did we leave off?”
Not like Tony had been watching the cameras outside of Bruce’s lab or anything. He did his best to act surprised.
Tony lets out a sigh when Steve finally pushes a lubed finger past his entrance. He’s impressed with how good Steve seems to be at this. Makes Tony wonder how often he’s done this in the past. He was pretty sure Steve wasn’t even into men. Maybe he isn’t? If he apparently got into the habit of doing this with his comrades way back in the day… well, it could have just been the sort of thing where he was helping out a teammate. That’s what Tony tells himself to hold onto his sanity for the moment.
This was where Steve liked to spar with Natasha, but seeing as how she was also okay with tying him up to teach him a lesson… “Fine.” He pulled back from Tony to settle down on the mat and gave him a look. “I’m not even sure I care anymore, after the day I’ve had.”
He flinched when he felt Tony’s gloved hands probing around his entrance. Glancing down, he could only see the top of his head.
many. He doesn’t even know where to begin. On the one hand, he could just turn Steve down and grit his teeth through this and then hope the team finds them in the next 24 to 48 hours. On the other hand… Tony can start to feel the fever taking its toll and even with Steve’s first aid, his back is only feeling worse. And, well, he’s definitely fantasized about Steve a few times. Maybe even more than a few times. He’d never imagined them getting together like
Sighing, Bruce said, “Why don’t you just talk to Steve about this? Natasha says he’s moping about all this, too.”
Steve grunted as he dragged the limp body of the man down the quiet corridor. He glanced around nervously, hoping that none of the other residents of this place were awake. As far as he could tell, though, everyone was asleep. The little windows into the small chambers that he passed by were either empty or covered by a screen that had been pulled down. Steve couldn’t help a slight shiver as he moved further into the room. Japanese capsule hotels reminded him of some bizarre science fiction film featuring pod people or something crazy like that. He’d been reluctant when a fellow assistant language teacher had told him about them, but he couldn’t argue with the price.
Steve went for the honest approach. “I mean, I was pretty heavily drugged at the time.” He shrugged. He was suddenly conscious of how he was wearing gym shorts that didn’t leave much to the imagination. It usually wasn’t a problem when he was sparring with Natasha, who was always polite about not pointing things like this out. But with Tony… Well, he hoped Tony was too worked up to notice. “It’s just, I think Bruce was right that the alien wasn’t actually hostile. So it’s not like it hurt me.”
Steve took a moment to think it over. “I guess I just really enjoy… the feeling?” He added, hastily, “Especially when it’s a lot.”
Steve let out a long, loud groan at the contact. With his stretched skin as oversensitized as it was, it felt like he could feel every bit of Tony’s thick, hot flesh. Now he understood why Tony had applied lube there before starting.
“Yeah yeah, I know. Could just be a fever due to inflammation.” He glances out the window again. “But ugh, this is a shitty situation to be stuck in.”
Steve holds out his hand, smiling wide when Tony takes it. Bucky’s right, maybe he could use a ‘break.’
“I’ll tell you when to start pushing.” Tony glanced up at a screen somewhere above Steve’s head and seemed to be counting to himself. A few moments later, he started saying the numbers out loud. “In five seconds: four, three two, one… Start pushing now.”
Steve’s next orgasm hit him so hard he nearly blacked out. It seemed to go on forever as the tight pressure in his core practically forced it out of him. He was sweating profusely now as he focused on keeping his breathing even. That seemed to be the best way to deal with the pressure so that he could focus on the pleasure. He felt like he was floating, his entire body going lax as he felt the aftershocks from one of the best orgasms of his life.
Tony takes his phone out, pretending to look at it to avoid any interaction, until he catches a glimpse of his unexpected companion. He almost drops the phone and has to consciously restrain himself from gawking because
Tony had seen him like no one ever had before. His memories were hazy, but Steve could recall enough to know that he’d been completely shameless. He could only imagine what he might have said in the absence of his inhibitions.
Steve could hear Tony breathing heavily right by his ear. He was clearly starting to wear out; a fact that Steve’s sex drive was unfortunately indifferent to.
Tony used one arm to brace himself against the armrest and the other to hold Steve’s cock in place. He gave Steve a sly, lascivious smile before sinking down slowly.
“Come on in, Cap,” he heard Tony say from somewhere further back in the large room. “Toward the back on your right.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. If this guy wasn’t after his organs, he could at least find out what was going on. “Plans?”
Steve laughs nervously. Here he is, turned on out of his mind, and this guy is still making him feel self-conscious. “Gee, I’m starting to think you only like me for one thing.”
“Wait. Why the hell are you removing your clothes? That’ll only increase your skin contact with whatever this thing is secreting!”
This new plan of Tony’s apparently dealt with all of that, or so he assumed from Tony’s excitement over the whole project.
Steve liked to think he had built up some resistance to that look, yet at the moment he wasn’t so sure. He told himself that he at least knew he could trust Tony, especially in something as… uniquely intimate as this. “I guess… we could give it a try.”
It was almost like the mask that Steve had seen him put up so effortlessly in public. A few months ago, Steve would’ve been too frustrated with Tony’s behavior to bother looking beyond it. But now, after he’d worked with the man and gotten to know him better, he could tell when Tony was trying to distract from something making him uncomfortable. Steve wasn’t willing to back down on this, that was for sure.
Tony didn’t waste any time pushing his cock past the back of Steve’s mouth. Steve groaned when he felt the head of Tony’s cock enter his throat.
Tony grunts in acknowledgement. A few seconds later, Steve’s other hand is running through his hair and Tony has to resist the urge to purr like a cat.
. He was still squirming a little as the eggs continued to be pushed through him. He was warm all over, as though he were lying in a tangle of blankets made out of the softest material imaginable. And every time Tony’s gaze raked over his body, it was like his skin was on fire. He trusted Tony to take care of him, and it was like a burden was lifted from his shoulders.
Tony’s eyes widened for a second as his mind quickly worked through what Steve said. “Oh.” He glanced down at Steve’s bound wrists and ankles. “Uh…”
Steve pulls Tony against him, which pushes his cock against Tony’s abdomen. Tony breaks the kiss with a gasp. When he pulls back, he finds Steve looking back at him, eyes wide with wonder.
Even in the dim light, he can see how Steve’s pupils are dilated. His eyes are fixed on Tony like they’re the only two people in the world. Before he can think better, he reaches for Steve’s arm to pull him closer just as Steve’s leaning toward him.
Tony thinks it over a bit more. This will probably make things awkward between them. That’s a problem for future Tony, though. Maybe it’s the fever making him a bit loopy, but he does trust Steve. The man wouldn’t lie, not even about something that sounds as ridiculous as this. Tony is naturally impatient, anyway, so the idea of speeding up his recovery so that he can whip up a better way to get them out of here quickly is also very appealing.
He scrubbed his hand over his face and leaned back against the console. “Give me a visual on Cap’s vitals, will you?”
“That’s what I like to see,” Tony said as he lowered himself slowly so that he was hovering over Steve. “You’re being so, so good for me, Steve.”
Two days later, Tony had unveiled the new desk, and Steve had so many feelings he couldn’t parse them all.
Steve stays still, wondering if this was still a test, and it must be because Tony pets his hair affectionately and says, “stand up, if you can, sweetheart, take your time,” pulling his cock out of Steve’s mouth.
“You’re so gorgeous my Lord, taking all of Stevie’s fingers like it’s nothin’. Can you feel ‘em stretching you open, baby? Preppin’ you to take our big, thick cocks?” Bucky tilts Tony’s face up and kisses him, and Steve watches at Bucky’s tongue plunders Tony’s mouth, Tony barely having a semblance of a technique anymore.
Steve admits that perhaps four fingers was overkill, but he couldn’t help but see how far he could go, how much the Lord could take, to see how much stretch he can handle before he starts to cry. Nevertheless, he must go on to the final act, and pulls the fingers out with a wet, sucking noise, leaving behind a slight gape that would still feel like a vice on Steve’s cock.
Bucky shakes his head with a grin, pulls his cock from his pajama pants instead. Starts tracing the cum leaking from Tony’s hole with the head.
It felt like it takes hours to get the toy out of his ass, and Steve spends most of it drooling into the desk, sobbing and moaning in an almost constant stream as he feels his body push out the intrusion.
And what a rhythm it was. Bucky doesn’t stay slow for long; he picks up his pace quickly, until Steve can’t keep up and has to hold Tony their as Bucky pounds into him from below, Tony thrashing in Steve’s grip.
a shower, winking as he catches Steve’s eye from across the room where seconds ago Steve was watching it slap wetly against his thigh.
“My turn,” Bucky gives a dangerous grin, face half shrouded in the night, and Steve feels Tony shudder in lust. Bucky sits back on his heels and lifts Tony’s hips with one hand and rests them on his knees, lining up his cock on the way.
Tony catches sight of Steve, and Steve gives him a piteous smile. “Oh look, our scheduled 12 minutes are up. Call me back if you want, just know that my answering machine is now actually the sound of a call being disconnected upon receipt.” He says, and JARVIS hangs up before he can get in another word.
“Look how eager he is Bucky,” Steve breathes, resting his back against the castle wall as he looks down at the man on his knees at their feet, likely getting grass stains in his dress pants.
“Please,” Tony gasps into Bucky’s mouth, as Steve fondles his red ass, watching the way his cheeks flex and release underneath his fingers in awe. “Please fuck me. I need you, both of you, please,” Tony cries out, and Bucky silences him with another wet kiss.
The toy, slathered in their preferred brand of boutique, non-drying lube, is thicker than the widest part of the bottle of beer Tony worked up his ass last week, but smaller than the diameter of all Tony’s knuckles.
At first it seems like Steve’s torture is nearly over: Tony almost immediately picks up his pace, and his breath is coming out in stutters, and each moan has that whine in it that implies he’s so, so close—
Tony’s brown eyes lock with Bucky’s and he meets his challenge gaze with a grin of his own. “I’ll show you too much, Barnes,” Tony says, voice hoarse, then he opens his mouth, and resumes.
“Ross.” Tony mutters, “wants me to build…well it really doesn’t matter does it? More garbage to perpetuate more wars and keep the defensive budget growing.” Tony sighs, leaning only slightly into Steve’s touch. “And I know it’s the same shit every time, trust me, I’m used to it, but the fact that he has the gall to act like that with me. Like, he thinks he
“Great,” Tony claps his hands, then points at Natasha. “I will marry you, and you will move in and be with Pepper all you want.”
Steve does that very slowly, muscles and asshole screaming in protest as he knee walks his way out from underneath the desk, and it takes Tony, hoisting Steve up with his arms underneath his armpits before he can stand, feet awkwardly wide, his legs feeling like gelatin.
Tony’s tense, and looks like he needs something to fight. Steve, who’s been with Tony for the better part of three years, decides to offers up their usual, alternative form of stress relief.
Minutes later and Steve feels empty, and he feels lube dripping down his thighs, and he feels guilty, because he know how much Tony likes for him to keep clean.
Steve’s not sure how long they were fucking, but he somehow still finishes first with deep moan, biting into a limp Tony’s neck as he stutters his hips. He slips out, and watches with a lazy smile as Bucky fucks upwards long and strong, drops of Steve’s cum rolling down his cock. He slams inwards, jerking Tony’s body upwards once, and adds his own cum to the slurry inside Tony.
Tony does just that, hips circling as he moves forward and backwards on Steve’s thick finger, which was pressing hard into Tony’s prostate, just like the young Lord likes. Bucky pulls out of Tony’s mouth with a curse, and strokes his cock and stares for a moment at Tony shamelessly fucking himself, mouth open, gasping and whining into the air.
He had two and half hours of social time, not only outside his room, but outside the whole fucking tower, in the open Goddamn air like a naïve little civilian. And it sucked, but Steve kept giving him these silly little happy looks which made it all worth it, despite the hundreds of
The tape is hot-rod red, matching the blindfold wrapped twice around Steve’s eyes, matching the thick leather straps that wrap around his knees and ankles, attached with magnets to the metal bars underneath Tony’s desk that Tony built slightly too wide for Steve to be comfortable.
“I wish you can see the way you like right now,” Tony says lowly, “the way you’re spread out so pretty on my desk… I bet if I took this thing out of you, I could slip right in, couldn’t I?”
And, Steve thinks, how considerate must Tony truly be that he built this desk for Steve, made of a thick glass that’s mirrored on the outside (“but only when the lights are on,” Tony likes to remind him), with curved metal bars to serve as reinforcements and anchor points for whatever position Tony decides to put him in that day, making him feel like he’s a piece at a museum being observed by Tony’s constant stream of visitors, makes him imagine a sign in front of his exhibit reading:
When Steve’s head finally pops through the ring, Tony comes with long strips of white and several cracked sobs. Steve presses in further as Bucky soothes Tony, and starts a firm pace, leaning over Tony’s back to give Bucky a sloppy kiss. Bucky’s hips start to move with his, and they start a back and forth into Tony’s dripping hole, wet and eager and stretched wide around them both.
Steve’s basking in his depravity when he suddenly sees a flash, suddenly hears the sound of a camera shutter, and he moans out loud at the thought that his depravity is being documented, and he imagines, for a wild moment that Tony would print that picture and send it to everyone Steve knew, to throw it from the rooftops and sprinkle all over the city, so that
Steve gently nuzzles his nose up to Tony’s lax neck, his head lolling to the side, kissing lightly at his sweaty skin. “You okay, babe?”
“But you lasted, what, three hours? That’s three times as long as your last record.” Tony says. “That’s enough time to get anywhere in New York! Well, maybe Manhattan. Upper Manhattan. Depends on the time of day, really.”
, that smug-faced bird fucker. Probably getting ice cream and encouraging him to throw more frisbees back to evil Hydra agents in the park. Unbelievable.
Tony’s breath hitches like it’s the first time they’ve done this, but Steve fights to keep his expression mild, just in case. “You open for business, babe?” Steve says, and he smiles, stealing some of Bucky’s Brooklyn accent that makes Tony’s knees week. Steve feels Tony’s Adam’s apple stutter as he swallows.
you are… even after taking… Steve, fuck.” Bucky grits out. “I can feel his come inside of you, ya know that?” Steve moans at the thought of Bucky fucking his seed out of Tony’s ass. “You look so beautiful, stretched out for us. Ah, I love you so much, my Lord.”
when Steve begged him to let him come, and Tony who had slowly, almost leisurely, fucked him as Steve lost the ability to tell the difference between pleasure and pain.)
Steve preens, arching his back to emphasize that beautiful curve at the small of his back, and Tony chuckles, knowing exactly how much Steve loves to be seen, and exactly how much it was killing him to have his vision cut off.
“Fucking hell, Bucky,” Steve mutters, and he helps Tony by lifting him up and actually pushing forward with Bucky’s thrusts, effectively fucking Tony on Bucky’s cock, giving Tony no choice but to keep to their rhythm.
“Mmmmph!” Tony cries, and he bucks his hips backwards, driving Steve inwards until it reaches the base of his palm.
“Have you learned your lesson?” Tony asks, and he does this, rhetorical questions when Steve’s mouth is occupied, completely on purpose, because Tony rarely wants Steve to speak when they’re like this.
Steve moans and grips the base of his cock. “My Lord, you are the prettiest, most wanton whore I’ve ever seen,” he says, then he bends back over and spreads his cheeks wide, hands no doubt stimulating the sensitive flesh. He flicks his tongue rapidly over his hole, pressing his tongue into Tony’s impossible tightness as Tony moans at the praise and the sensation, and he lets Tony’s ass rock back into his face for a moment as he fucks himself on Steve’s outstretched tongue.
Tony cries out so loud it startles a flock of birds from the trees, and it only takes a few long sucks for Tony to finish down his throat, coating his tongue in semen.
“You were such a good boy, keeping my cock warm for me while I dealt with some work.” Tony says, and Steve whines into the glass.
Luckily, he’s picked up a few tricks to handle their emotional uprisings, and it’s worked out supremely well in Tony’s favor. Like,
Seven minutes, and Tony’s thighs are wrapped around Steve’s waist as he fucks into him in the air, Tony moaning like the whore he was as Steve moves his whole body for him, Tony’s cock jerking with each thrust.
Getting between Bucky and Steve while they were arguing was like trying to stand between two trains, barreling towards each other at full speed. Of all the benefits of a friendship as theirs, (one of them being sharing lovers, thank Asimov for that) one of the drawbacks is knowing every button to press, every flaw in the other’s being. And while couples fight, a fight between those two in a triad like theirs left Tony in the war path, watching the trains approach him at an unstoppable speed.
Steve finds it fitting that he’s on his knees in, essentially, a position of prayer—if Pastor John could see him now— except his legs and ass are spread are much, much wider than anyone would consider decent and his bowed head is positioned perfectly for Tony’s cock to nestle down his throat, leaning, almost tauntingly, against Steve’s sleeping gag reflex.
And in his stillness, Steve feels like an art piece with two purposes: to look pretty, and to keep warm.
Tony gently turns him and bends him over the desk, and something inside Steve shifts in a wrong way, shifts in a
Tony’s tongue finds and plays with that special spot behind Steve’s cockhead that makes him see stars behind his eyelids, and Steve chokes out a curse as his hand tightens in Tony’s hair. “Because, my Lord, we know you have good taste,” Steve grins, “and you couldn’t wait to get a piece of us, couldn’t you? Didn’t even know what you wanted, we had to teach you
His tune falters however, when he doesn’t hear the characteristic sound of Tony’s music, or any machine’s running a process in the background. Rather, it’s Tony himself, talking over a phone.
“You got that right Stevie,” Bucky’s low gravelly voice intones, and Steve looks over to see him grinning wildly, Tony’s hand still stroking Bucky’s cock without pause, fingertips barely closing around Bucky’s thick shaft. “I still remember the first day you came to the garden, my Lord. Stevie and I were head over heels for you. But how could two gardener’s even have a chance with the Lord of the house?”
“Natasha I’m not letting you do this.” Pepper says and she jumps from the desk. She still has one of her many skirts on, which covers up the part of a woman Tony never wants to see again, but she still is basically nude.
The young Lord Stark is on his hands and knees in nothing but his thin white shirt, his pants and underwear respectively thrown off and ripped to pieces, laying somewhere in the bushes. Steve is kneeling behind him, using two thick hands to spread Lord Stark’s tight, muscular cheeks, his tongue circling his tight hole and licking stripes up and down his ass.
Seconds later, Steve feels a barely there pressure on his hole, and realizes belatedly that it’s Tony’s cock, pushing his way into the cavern of Steve’s ass like a finger would a pussy.
Howard nods. “He is a deep man, capable of extreme intelligence, and finds that taking a walk through the gardens is a good way to clear his head. When he comes back, he’s always more focused, alert, down to earth.”
Steve, though tired, lifts Tony up slightly, and locks his upper body in a tight grip as Bucky starts sliding in, letting gravity help push Tony down on his thick cock.
“I would recommend not, my Lord,” Steve says instead, grinning. “Though I don’t doubt your greedy little ass could take it all.”
When he get’s back, Tony is lying on his stomach, leg’s kicking in the air like a teenager at a slumber party. “You’re jealous of Sam?” His voice sounds like he swallowed a pound of gravel.
“I changed my mind,” Tony says, and Steve hears a slight, electrical noise, and the magnets on his legs disengage from the bars on the desk.
Steve rolls over to the grass and lays on his back, exhausted, looking over at Bucky, who slipped out of Tony and was now kissing his red lips. Tony’s drowning in bliss, floating somewhere else that isn’t here, and Steve encourages them to come over and join him.
The elevator opens to his living room, Tony lying on the couch, a holographic screen of text scrolling in front of him. He opens his mouth to great Bucky, but he doesn’t even have time to get the first word out before Bucky picks him up, ignoring his surprised floundering. He strides to their bedroom with Tony over his shoulder and tosses him on the bed, manhandling him until he was on his back, neck hanging over the side of the bed.
He manages to tear one before he finishes with a moan, noticing idly that Tony’s already painted his own stomach, and has been hanging on the right side of oversensitive for the last minute.
“I’m just going to use it, pretty boy. I’m going to take my time with it. I’m going to feel it try, and fail, to clench around me, and I’m going to cum inside of it and watch it trickle out. After that,
“I have heard that Anthony is a master of all things intelligence, and that you scarcely see a time where he is not buried headfirst in a tome or building improvements for his friends. But can a man like that truly fight?”
“God, your ass is so nice and wet for me sweetheart…” Tony says, humming, “so deliciously loose. Of course you’re just going to tighten back up in a few, but right now?
Tony’s mouth is already open by the time Bucky gets his cock out, and Bucky guides it to his mouth, pressing into his throat, him taking with practiced ease. Bucky fucks his throat hard and fast and proper, muttering to himself between gasps but not paying attention to what he was saying, focusing more the way Tony’s throat expands and retracts around his thrusting cock, the way his spit drools down his own face, the way his lower body squirms to try and find friction with the air, and
closing massive deals and pushing things along in his company and more or less doing thousands and thousands of dollars of work while his boy warms his cock, and that is the hottest part of it all, the measure of sheer
Bucky strips off the rest of his clothes and kneels down on his pants on the grass in front of Tony. He pulls Tony’s body up so the are both kneeling in front of each other, and he pulls Tony’s hips forward, off Steve’s finger, so that their cocks are aligned. Steve can see Bucky’s hand wrap around Tony’s head and pull him into what sounds like a messy kiss as they rub together.
Tony nods his head as he sucks in response, and even Steve has to laugh at that, before he spanks Tony again, harder. Tony moans, which causes Bucky to moan, so Steve does it again, and again, and more, and more, until Tony makes a sobbing noise and slaps Bucky’s thighs twice.
“Aw, aw hell, my Lord,” Bucky stutters, and he leans back and starts to fuck upwards, abs working long and hard to press his cock as deep as it could go inside Lord Stark.
Steve shakes his head fondly, heading to the bathroom to clean himself up. By the time he gets back, Tony’s given up all pretense of sleep as he’s stretched on Bucky dick, Bucky lying on his back and using his hands to lift him and lower him like a ragdoll, Tony’s head lolling to the side, mumbling deliriously, overwhelmed with the zero to sixty of sensation.
Stepping into the bedroom, Steve is greeted by one of his favorite sights: Bucky, dozing lightly on his back in his pajamas, hands behind his head and cat-that-got-the-cream smile on his face, and Tony, completely naked, face in the mattress and ass in the sky, breathing deeply into his pillow.
Bucky swears and Steve looks up just to see his eyes roll back in his head, and he comes with a grunt, slumping back onto his heels, filling up their Lord with his seed as well.
“I say,” A large bald man says. He is with his wife, a tall thin woman with no smile, and a beautiful daughter blonde woman in a light pink dress, blush staining her cheeks.
“I believe he is taking a stroll through the gardens. It’s one of his favorite pastimes. Even a man of his stature has an artistic side.”
“Good boys do as their told,” Tony continues, as he reaches down to undo the blindfold across Steve’s eyes. “Good boys stay still, and good boys
Steve lets go of Tony’s hair, and he rests his cheek down on the Bucky’s pant leg again, and works on fucking the Lord into the ground.
Tony taps twice on the floor below him, startling Steve slightly, bringing him back to awareness enough to realize the room is empty.
!” Steve shouts as his orgasm rushes him. He thrusts a few more times in an irregular rhythm, dumping his seed deep inside of Tony, before he collapses over onto Tony’s back, breath heaving.
“Ross?” Steve says, stepping up behind Tony’s chair, gently rubbing his hands into the tight muscles of his back, worn from years of being the world’s best mechanic.
Later that night when the steam had dissipated, and crash was averted, and Tony had closed for business, Steve and Bucky make it up to him and each other by rubbing lotion into the rug burn Tony’s developed on his knees and kissing him all over. If Tony was honest with himself, which he never is, he’d realize that the reason he’s so patient through their fights is because the aftercare lasts for-
Bucky shakes his head, cutting off Tony’s moans with his cock, which is steadily thrusting in and out of Tony’s mouth.
“Though there have been rumors that Anthony has been a ‘ladies man’ as they may call it, I do know that he is ready to take on a wife that will carry the Stark name through the generations.” Maria smiles. “He has matured in this way, and is ready to settle down, with one woman, for good.”
Bucky leans back up and looks down at Tony’s face, and makes a fond noise that could be construed as a laugh as takes in the mess he made. He walks to the bathroom to grab him a wet towel.
Steve stills his hips, the licks even deeper, burying himself inside of Tony. He continues licking until Tony’s hole begins to loosen, then starts to work a finger inside alongside his tongue, looking for that special spot that makes Tony scream.
This game is a powerplay for Tony too: Tony keeping himself calm and focused during his various meetings throughout the day, sighting an injury for the reason he can’t stand up yet
. And when he’s on his side while Bucky fucks him slowly as Steve strokes his cock, breaking him apart as the whisper how much they love him each of his ears, Tony can't help the way the warm emotions well up inside of him.
“Where is the young Lord Stark now?” Lady Carter says. She looks unamused, and her daughter, a beautiful blonde in a lovely blue dress, is talking deeply with one of the other woman in the party.
Bucky balls slap Tony’s face as he cums with a sigh, and Tony swallows, chokes, then swallows again. He pulls out and Tony inhales heavily, and Bucky leans over and pulls Tony’s sleep pants down without preamble and sucks until Tony’s taste is coating his own tongue.
“Mmmm….” Tony says into the grass. He’s miraculously not cum yet, his cock dangling hard and low between his thighs, and he seems content to lie there, exposing his needy little hole to the whole world.
He leans himself over Tony’s body and presses in, exhaling at the feeling of warmth around his cock, Bucky’s cum easing the way. He’s strung too tight for slow, and sets a pace with his orgasm in mind, rutting into his hole like a teenager would a masturbation sleeve, not even bothering to lift Tony’s hips and aim for his prostate.
Steve pulls out with a wet noise and makes a puddle on the ground. Tony drops his legs and stands shakily, and they share their first kiss, Steve pulling it out of Tony long and slow, not minding the way Tony’s naked body wets his shirt.
But, he sighs to himself, he should probably brush his teeth and get ready for bed first; his hole will be there when he gets back. He points at Bucky then points at himself, then points at the bathroom.
Tony pulls off and dives back into Steve, and Steve gasps into Bucky’s mouth and pulls away with one last lingering kiss. Tony sucks with vigor, but can only make it about halfway down Steve, which is impressive given his size. And yet, when the thick head presses against the impossible tightness of Tony’s throat, Steve can’t help but feel the need to bury his hands in Tony’s hair and push his cock down that tight channel.
Maria stands to her fullest height, and smiles. “Rest assured, Anthony Stark excels at not only his academics, but in his sword fighting classes as well. Just the other day, he struck down his instructor in less than a minute!”
supremely well. Which is how Tony finds himself being spit roasted by two super soldiers as they each try to fuck him across the room in opposite directions, each too busy pumping their hips into Tony to shout any more words they don’t mean at each other, the fight devolving into a competitive fuck-off, with Tony drifting in and out of the clouds.
(And Tony had caught him looking, but that was all part of the fun, because at the end of the day it was Tony took his favorite vibrator and slipped it in Steve’s body, Tony who pushed his cock in next to it while it was on high, Tony who had fucking
Steve stops and swears at the picture Tony makes. His hips had fallen lower to the ground so that his straining cock is brushing against the grass, his knees having fallen open much wider as he rocks back and forth between Bucky’s cock and Steve’s hands. His spine is arched in a delicious curve that displays his now-red ass cheeks to the sky, begging for Steve to bury his cock in between them, and the noises he’s making, muffled as they were, were bordering on obscene.
,” Steve gasps. He fucks in until his hips are flush with Tony’s pelvis, and gives Tony only a moment to adjust before he starts to piston his hips with no mercy. He couldn’t slow down if he tried; Tony feels so good wrapped around his dick, and watching his tight, perfect ass bounce with each thrust, was pure heaven.
And Steve, Tony’s pretty boy, who just found out he’s exchanged his mouth for his ass, nearly starts to cry.
“Think I’m closed for business now sweetheart.” Tony mutters into Steve’s shoulder, as Bucky starts the bath. Steve huffs out a laugh, forever amazed at how much Tony can handle.
“Our hole’s getting loose, isn’t he Stevie?” Bucky grins as Steve presses his finger in deep, already trying to work in a second one. About their heads, Tony keens, cock hard between them.
Tony limps out of his room an into the general direction of the ballroom. He should make an appearance at his own ball, he supposes. This is his future wife that he’s is going to have to deal with for the rest of his life.
Luckily, Steve knew better than to lie about it, but Tony was still upset, gently undoing the scene he had planned and rocking Steve in his arms until the serotonin trickled its way back in, dressing him silently and laying down next to him in bed in empty, dissatisfying silence.
It’s probably arched slightly from the curve that Steve’s back has to maintain in order to keep his mouth level with Tony’s lap, the position made much more difficult with the way his wrists are bound together behind his back using Tony’s homemade bondage tape, strengthened by the sticky fluid he helped develop for his protégé.
Tony taps the back of Steve’s thighs twice, and Steve pulls all the way out, leaving Tony sputtering and gasping for air on his knees.
“Sure thing sugar. We’re just gonna get you cleaned up.” Bucky says as he kisses Tony gently, and Steve absorbs the way Tony’s contended smile stretches across his face when he looks at Bucky. It’s all worth it, Steve thinks, to be able to come home to this.
Steve has four of the fingers of his right hand buried to the second knuckle in Tony’s asshole. Tony is sobbing into Bucky’s shoulder, still doing most of the work fucking his hips back into Steve, sweat on his back glistening with the moonlight.
Tony ends up in the middle—he always ends up there—and Bucky and Steve lay next to him on their backs, and they all stare up into the stars, basking in the afterglow of another warm night in the gardens.
.” Bucky pouts. His not sure what makes him act like a petulant child, but as of late he’d been complaining and whining more than ever. He’d brought it up once with Dr. Ryan, but she started dropping words like ‘regression’ and Bucky panicked and shut the conversation down.
They had decorated their largest ballroom for the event, using the family’s colors of red and gold. Drapes covered the floor to ceiling windows of the castle, and red and gold tablecloths cloak the wooden tables. Servants ran quickly between large groups of chatting nobility, and an orchestra played light dancing music in the corner
The night was warm and the air was still on the evening of Lord Stark’s beautillion. Lord Anthony Stark was on the cusp of 21, and the Stark family was eager to find him a wife that would carry on the Stark family name and continue to grow their wealth and prominence in the land.
And Bucky knows he’s being irrational, okay? But this is what he’s feeling, and it’s happening, and Dr. Ryan keeps saying that despite all the logic in the goddamn universe, illogical feelings are valid, and while he works through his traumatic past and shit, he needs to find a proper outlet for them, or else he’s going to explode.
, Steve likes him like this, on his back spread obscenely wide on the worktop, his toes curling into points and his knuckles turning white as his grips the edge, Steve trying to see if he can rip the bolts that hold the table to the ground.
Howard stands firm. “Anthony is dominant in all matters social and physical, and is a master swordsmen. He would be on the first line, fighting with his army, and would rather die than submit to another man.”
Bucky can only moan in response, and who can blame him, with the way the young Lord Stark is slurping down his cock. He’s choking himself trying to swallow Bucky’s thick length, and his wrist is rotating his hand at the base as he bobs his head up and down ferociously. Bucky’s only hand is buried in his thick black locks, and he’s looking at the night sky like heaven’s come down to take him early.
At some point Tony wakes up, babbling and confused, and Bucky leans over and kisses him chastely on the top of his head as Steve’s hips start to stutter, the thrusts making an almost comical squelching noise as he digs in. Finally, Steve thrusts in deep, and finishes with an exhausted moan, filling the hole more than it can manage, his cum trying to make its way farther in and out at the same time.
(Steve had learned to suppress it for the anniversary of their first scene, and Tony had spent the whole day showering him with praise and rewards, celebrating the months of work Steve put in drooling around dildos and coughing on his own fingers until he could confidently swallow Tony whole and massage him with his throat without gagging or losing a drop of cum on his expensive black slacks.)
“Despite our wealth,” Howard says, puffing out his chest, “we have taught him of the ways of the world, and we have raised him to be tough, to be strong, and stand up when life kicks him down. I know that Anthony can handle anything.”
Tony pulls his mouth off of Bucky, his lips wet and cherry red, and allows himself one strangled gasp of air before diving onto Steve’s cock, which was being held in Tony’s other hand. His mouth is pure, wet suction, and it causes Steve to moan and roll his eyes in the back of his head.
And it makes Steve wonder how he must look from the back, speared open by this massive, unyielding, silicone monster, burning a searing line of pleasure into Steve’s body, his fingers just able to touch the flared end of the also hot-rod red toy sitting flush against Steve’s taunt ass, the thinness of his waist enunciating the curve in a purely sinful matter.
Steve pushes in a third finger, and the noise Tony makes is somewhere between a sob and a plea. “I don’t blame ya Buck.” Steve responds, before slicking up again, lining up, and pressing in.
Steve pulls back and wipe his mouth with his sleeve, and presses the finger of his other hand deeper inside of Tony, crooking it forward.
, babe. How am I supposed to function when I can’t even be outside for more than three hours?” Bucky says, exhausted and sad all at once.
Steve hums as he heads into his favorite engineer’s workshop, in that kind of smooth, easy mood that comes from a problem free Sunday morning. He plans on coaxing Tony out of his work mood with the promise of brunch, the kind with the orange juice and champagne that makes Tony gigglier then he would ever admit.
“Fuck, Steve!” Tony cries out; Steve can feel his breath between his legs. He massages the sack with his tongue, then sucks in the other one, feeling just how tight they were, just how close to release the young Lord was. Benevolently, Steve shifts and takes Tony’s cockhead into his mouth.
Steve has to agree. “Fuck!” He gasps, and he presses Tony down to the hilt and holds him there, feeling Tony’s throat work around his dick. It’s almost too tight, it’s certainly too wet; he can see Tony drooling out of the corner of his mouth.
Tony pulls back again and switches back to Bucky, and Bucky tilts his head back and moans to the stars above. Steve wraps a hand around Bucky’s neck and draws him into a kiss, unhurried and languid as if in contrast to Tony’s ferocity. He presses his tongue into his lovers mouth, tasting him, swallowing his grunts and moans.
“As you wish, my Lord,” Steve says slightly breathless, then he pushes Tony’s face forward into Bucky’s chest. Bucky knee walks backwards until Tony’s back on his hands and knees, and Steve rises to his feet and
JARVIS supplies quietly, and Steve doesn’t even let himself feel embarrassed that the AI had answer the question before he could ask it. Instead, Steve sighs in relief as he strides to their bedroom, pants and boxers falling to the wayside as well, cock already hard and insistent against his stomach.
“Mmm… come on. Think we need a bath.” He sweeps Tony up in his arms, who comes to gently on the walk to the bathroom. All he has the energy to do is tuck his head into Steve’s shoulder, sighing in content.
of him, likely noticing the way his legs are beginning to tremble and the tightness of his shoulders, and the rippling of his back muscles as he worked himself over Tony’s cock.
Steve mouths the words as Bucky says them out loud, the phrase old. “Must be nice, not having a job.” He says ruefully, “Getting to stay home and play with your toys all day.” Tony whimpers into Bucky’s shoulder.
Steve only has a few more moments to breath before Bucky kneels down in front of Tony, pulls him up to his knees, and pushes him, hard, back into Steve’s chest. Steve catches him easily, then wraps his arms around Tony’s, locking him in place.
Steve hums to himself as he joins them on bed, and pushes Tony over so that he falls on Bucky with an “oof.” Bucky continues to work his body on his cock as Steve slips a lubed finger into the place where they were joined, sliding in with ease.
When people enter Tony’s office, though Steve can pick up clearly on what they are saying, he wishes  he could watch their shadows play across the walls behind them, watch Tony as he interacts with them, his cock stiffening in Steve’s mouth as the depravity of their actions hits him, watch the way they slide their chairs close and comment on the new desk and crowd around it, just inches from this perverted display.
Pressing into Tony’s ass is like coming home after a long day of work and being rewarded with, well. The tightest ass on the planet. He’s hole sucks Steve in and squeeze his cock tight like a velvet glove.
Steve thinks he could learn to like this desk a lot, though he went through a lot of emotions when he was first trussed up on the floor at Tony’s feet, starting with sadness, tears wetting the blindfold, then determination, then boredom, and then stillness, which wasn’t boredom at all, but a nice fuzzy state of mind, a gentler level of subspace than he’s used to.
Tony whines around Steve’s cock, and Steve looks down and curses at the image Tony makes: his eyes are half lidded, his mouth is stretched wide around Steve’s length, and his trousers are tented between his thighs where he kneels on the grass.
“He’s slobbering all over your cock, making such a mess. Such a desperate one we got, huh?” Steve teases Tony. “So glad we can serve you the way you need, my Lord.”
Steve feels Tony press the base of the toy and he can’t help the shout that escapes him, can’t help the string of wrecked noises that come from the back of his throat as Tony jostles his prostate, his cock twitching against the glass, smearing pre-come over the glass.
all that, then you’ll get to come, and you’ll thank me like a good boy does. You think you can handle that?”
Steve walks into his room about midnight and drops his shield on the carpet with a dull thunk, muscles protesting against the combination of a too hard work out and too much time sitting in a chair in meetings at SHIELD. Every muscle in his body is taunt and begging for release.
As he walks, the bustle of the party growing louder, he frowns as he hears something behind a door in the hallway. A high pitched giggle, a gasp, and then frantic shushing. Frowning, Tony opens the door to his left to come across a scarcely used office, where he’s shocked to find two dresses thrown on the ground, undergarments strewn about, and a red haired woman, on her knees, her face buried between the legs of…
Natasha turns to him and nods stiffly, still holding an arm in front of Pepper like Tony was going to attack any second. Tony smiles at her behavior; seems Pepper’s found a good one too.
It was a simple command that had done Steve in, two days ago, Tony saying “don’t move, sweetheart, I’ll be back,” before leaving Steve face down in the bedspread, hard as a rock, dildo mark 10 vibrating away in his ass.
Tony stood up and made a show of dusting off his pants. He glanced away as he replied, “No problem. Should’ve guessed Romanoff was the one with a thing for bondage.” He huffed out a weak laugh.
Steve started pushing his boxers down. It was getting difficult to keep paying attention to Tony’s voice.
“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” Tony mumbled to himself. Then he said louder to Steve, “You’re the one that got whammied by an alien bug’s love juice and now you’re
Steve’s flush spreads to his cheeks. It’s not just the hormones that are to blame. “I… I’m not sure if we should—”
Steve moaned against Tony’s mouth. Even through his shirt, Tony could feel the heat from Steve’s dick against his abdomen. He reached down to stroke himself a bit before pulling back to position himself.
After watching Steve speak with one of the policemen at the small station in the area, they’d made some calls and after a half hour of waiting, someone had come by with Tony’s wallet.
“Oh…” Tony hopes that makes Steve blush even more. The mental image alone is great. “Well, I’ll still take it slow.”
The whole situation feels surreal as Steve closes the distance between them. He reaches down for the first button on his shirt, hesitating. He looks down to see that the other man is already working on his belt. His mind made up, Steve quickly unbuttons his shirt and untucks it from his pants. He wastes no time removing it and then moving onto his undershirt. The whole time, he can smell the sweet scent ripening in response to his own arousal.
Tony nods. “I don’t want to risk anything getting worse. As soon as I’m feeling better, I can rig us a way to send out a stronger signal that can even get through this blizzard.”
And that’s how Steve found himself posing with Tony with a smiling snowman in the middle. Thankfully the place wasn’t too busy and they only got a few odd stares for their antics.
“Oh…” Tony tried thinking back to the night before again. He did seem to remember a hotel sign. And even paying for a hotel with his train card. Not much else besides that.
“Steve,” Tony cuts in. “That was some of the best sex I’ve had in my life.” He waves his hand as though to dismiss any of Steve’s worries. “You seem like a great guy. Great nesting instincts, too.”
Once they were in the thankfully empty bathroom, Steve did his best to prop the man up one of those shower stools that Japanese baths always had.
He still wasn’t sure what to expect from this kind of hotel by the time he’d walked up to the neon blue sign outside of the building. Well, no way to find out unless he went in. He marched through the sliding doors into the bright lobby like he would have marched onto the field back during his boot camp days.
Steve could feel his cheeks heat up. He was glad his face was partially obscured by a giant bunny plush. “Just a bit,” he answered.
“Sorry, let myself get distracted.” He gestured to what was behind Steve. “Move back a bit, okay? We still have to get that plug out of you.”
“Pretty sure your Ma always told you to look at people when you’re talking to ‘em.” Bucky raises an eyebrow at him, clearly unimpressed.
because Steve, devious bastard that he is, shifts his hand so that he’s pressing both of their dicks against the taut, stretched skin of Tony’s stomach. The mixed sensations of his sensitive cock against his tender skin are too much.
Tony shrugged. “Could’ve been at the shabu shabu place or while I was drunkenly wandering around the city or even on the train. No point worrying about it at this rate.”
“We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to, honey.” Tony ran a hand up Steve’s arm. “I’ll admit, I got caught up in the excitement, but we can table this for another time.”
There was a loud shout that he realized belatedly must’ve come from him as he strained against his bonds in his throes of ecstasy. By the time the aftershocks of pleasure had passed, he glanced down to see even more of a mess on his stomach. And to his surprise, he’d managed to push the second egg out.
Steve nodded and then turned his focus back to his abdominal muscles. Once again, he felt the objects moving through him until one of them reached his prostate again. Even when he was prepared for it, the vibrations made him gasp and writhe. He was hard and leaking again, adding to the mess on his stomach. By the time the egg was halfway through being pushed out of his hole, he hit his peak.
“Well…” Tony glanced away briefly before looking back at Steve. His pupils were dilated, almost completely overtaking the brown. “I told you this is nanotech. It can do… a lot. Right now they’ve taken the form of something compact to make it easier to move inside you. But now that they’ve settled, they could… expand.”
Steve huffed out a laugh. “I’m not an engineering problem, Tony.” That was one thing he was learning about Tony in their relationship: he could take anything as a challenge.
It seemed to take forever for Tony to finally sink down all the way. Steve gasped when he felt Tony’s warmth settle against his balls.
He gasps against Steve’s neck as he’s pulled against Steve’s warm, inviting chest. His cock is enveloped in heat as Steve starts moving his hand, and it only gets better when Steve’s hand shifts and there’s the addition of hot, slick skin against Tony’s own. He’s quickly reduced to panting against Steve’s collarbone once Steve has his big, warm hand around both of them. This close, Tony can feel Steve’s cock throbbing against his own and each pulse as it keeps leaking precome. It’s so goddamned hot, Tony can’t imagine it getting any better.
Steve nodded. “Thanks.” He took the mask and promptly strapped it around his face. He wasn’t wearing his helmet, which was probably for the best. It wasn’t designed for hazmat situations, either.
Tony was here for him. He’d take care of him. Steve just wished that Tony was lying next to him and not ten feet away locked up in the armor.
Tony went into a rant about how, apparently, the apparatus was fully maneuverable, tiltable, and could be raised to any height needed. There were also supports on the side, which Tony said with a wink would come into play later.
going to get an erection while talking to Bruce, what the hell. Glancing back up at the screen, he gave Bruce a lopsided smile. No point in putting on an innocent act.
Waves of pleasure light up every nerve, and Steve lets himself be carried along. By the time he comes back to himself, his ears are ringing and he doesn’t even realize his eyes are closed until he opens them to find that he’s bent over Tony. Steve can feel each pulse of his knot throughout his whole body like each is its own orgasm. Somehow, he’s still coming inside Tony. He groans against Tony’s skin as his brain tries to make sense of the overwhelming input—like he’s slowly settling back into his body. Eventually, he realizes that his arms are now wrapped around Tony’s chest.
Steve nodded, though he had one question. “Um… will they still…” He felt awkward even trying to finish the question.
Unsurprisingly, there was a woman at the front desk even this late. She didn’t seem phased by the fact that Steve was this random foreigner who’d showed up at a late hour as she looked up his reservation. It didn’t take long before she was cheerfully handing Steve his keycard and a sheet of paper explaining in English what to do with it.
Steve seems to hesitate once he’s down to his boxers. Tony notices how Steve’s shoulders are tense. Finally, he turns to face Tony, and well… Tony can see why he was hesitant. There’s an impressive erection tenting his boxers. Going by the size of the bulge, he’s packing heat, too. Tony realizes he’s staring and snaps his gaze up to meet Steve’s eyes, whose expression is unreadable.
“I’m so sorry, Mr. Rogers,” the receptionist says sincerely. “I’m afraid something came up at the last second and the final portion of your interview today has been cancelled.”
Bruce blinked at him in surprise before he fell back against the counter, laughing. “You really are something else. You know that, Cap?”
“Of course!” Tony ran a hand through his hair in frustration. “Geez, I’m not being very considerate, am I? Here you are sweating up a storm and I haven’t even offered you anything to drink.” He winced as he pushed himself off of Steve, and they groaned in unison when the head of Steve’s cock finally pulled free. Tony gave him an apologetic smile. “Guess I got carried away, seeing you like this.”
He felt Tony’s hand start to rub soothing circles into his abdomen again. Gradually, he willed himself to calm down before he started to push again.
Even then, though… Steve had always wondered what it would be like to be even more full than that. If it was even possible.
Tony finally stirred, slowly pushing himself up from Steve’s chest. He had this dopey smile on his face that Steve wanted to kiss so badly.
. Trying to think was just a distraction from how good everything felt. Even so, part of him knew it was important that he kept responding to Tony.
Steve glanced up at the bright lights overhead. This guy must’ve been really out of it. “Not really, no. You’re just really drunk.”
He wasn’t sure how he could ever look Steve in the eye again after this without spontaneously combusting. Because despite how horrifying the whole alien incident had been, Tony couldn’t get over just how
“Merry Christmas, Tony,” he whispered before rolling them over so that Tony was underneath him. Despite actually getting his own capsule next to Steve’s for that night, he’d insisted on sharing with Steve this time. And, well… Steve couldn’t really complain right now. Even if they both got caught, it would have been worth it.
Eventually, Steve settled on the awkward task of removing the man’s shoes and cramming them into the locker next to his. Once that was settled, he took the complementary toiletries bag. He was originally planning to just go to sleep immediately. Considering his unexpected companion’s state, though, a trip to the bathroom to clean up couldn’t hurt.
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Right…” he says more to  himself as he settles on his knees. Like this, he has an even better view—the man’s thighs glisten with slick as he holds his now bare legs up, his pants and underwear tossed aside. His cock is rock hard against his stomach. The sight gets Steve to hurry up, wasting no more time getting his zipper down. Finally going for his boxer briefs, Steve lets out a groan as he frees his cock. There’s already the first signs of his knot at his base—Steve can feel it throbbing steadily.
“Yeah, I’m ready.” Steve wasn’t sure exactly what Tony needed to do on his end, but he assumed that they both needed to be on the same page.
“Ah?” Tony is caught off-guard and has to stifle a laugh. “Well, uh… it was different for me, I guess.”
The look of concern only deepened. “If you say so…” The man reached out toward Tony. “Anyway, my name’s Steve. How about you?”
Bruce hesitated, his gaze darting to the ground. “And sorry about this whole thing, Cap. Tony and I had no idea that the creature would be able to break out of its containment cell like that. That was reinforced glass and everything.”
Steve ran a hand over his face, which he knew must be beet red, by now. Ducking his head a bit, he let his gaze drift to the rumpled bed sheets behind Tony as he thought back to that night. Every slight movement of Tony’s hand inside of him had sent sparks of pleasure racing through him. Once Tony had gotten his hand all of the way inside of him and against his prostate, he’d barely lasted another thirty seconds. It had been one of the best orgasms of his life and one of the few times he’d gone to bed feeling truly sated.
One of the appendages brushed against his cock and Steve let out a loud, wanton moan. When he tried to move, he realized that he was being held in place. Glancing down he realized he was wrapped up in the long body of that strange, bug-like alien again. Distantly, he knew that this should bother him more than it was at the moment. He just couldn’t think why. Everything felt so good, he couldn’t stop the shudders running through him the pleasure that reached all the way to the tips of his toes and his fingers.
Steve felt awkward sitting on the examination table as Bruce toiled away across the room, running some tests on blood samples he’d just taken. He’d already been through a CT scan, which Bruce had said he’d take a look at later. It was starting to remind him of the days after he’d gotten the serum when he’d been poked and prodded like a lab rat by the SRS.
Steve’s moan against Tony’s lips is gratifying, which prompts Tony to wrap his hand around the base of Steve’s cock.
“Well, shit,” Tony said to himself as he made out the words ‘hotel.’ Maybe things were looking up after all. He remembered being told that his train pass could also be used to pay for some hotels around town. Maybe he’d be able to at least find somewhere to pass out for the night that wasn’t the pavement.
Steve let his head fall back against the makeshift pillow made by the creature’s soft body with a sigh. He realized dazedly that the creature’s other end was moving down his back. Obligingly, Steve arched his back to give it more space between himself and the cool floor. Everything was starting to blur together as pleasure continued to thrum through his entire body.
Tony sets the glass down and rubs at his eyes. “I’m fine. It’s just… what’s the probability that I run into a super compatible alpha?”
“Oh,” he said quietly as he finally started to process the fullness that had settled in his gut. He forced himself to relax his abdominal muscles again and focused on the sensation of the eggs still shifting inside of him. It was so damn good, and Tony’s hand stroking back and forth over the raised skin of his abdomen only made it better.
Tony knows Steve’s right. They’re a mess right now, and if he falls asleep now he’ll regret it when he wakes up. He just can’t seem to convince his limbs to move.
Steve couldn’t help smiling. “So nice of you to offer.” He groaned when Tony started lightly stroking his stomach. “Okay, yeah. Keep doing that.”
Tony shakes his head. “Wouldn’t have happened if I’d been on top of my shit.” He turns to Steve, looking into his eyes steadily. “So I just wanted to say I’m sorry about all that.”
She put her hands on Steve’s wrists and brought them together over his chest. “Steve, I think you really need to talk to him.”
He pinched the bridge of his nose. If only he’d had a suit prepared beforehand. Normally he would have, but after he’d destroyed all of his suits dealing with Killian, he no longer had the versatility he taken for granted. And really, who the hell would have predicted a situation with a pheromone-spewing alien in his own damn tower.
“Uh… Cap?” Tony sounded hesitant, though he still approached the mat. He was wearing a thin band t-shirt and slacks with a pair of sneakers.
Steve did as he was told and focused on contracting his abdominal muscles. Another nice benefit of the serum was that he had more precise muscle control than most people. He wondered how difficult this would be, all things considered.
He was taken out of his thoughts when he heard Tony approach. Glancing up, Steve noticed that he’d pulled on a pair of slacks. He smiled when he felt Tony’s fingers lightly caressing his cheek. “Got you a nice cold sports drink. Figured you probably need some electrolytes after all this.”
“O-oh…” Steve hears himself say in response. Like this, there’s no question about what the intention is. Tony’s entrance already looks a bit loose and ready—like he’s well into his heat. Steve distantly wonders how Tony got through the day like this. The question hardly matters to him as he moves closer, however. All he can think about is sliding into that slick heat. He settles his hands on Tony’s ass.
,” Bruce clarifies, looking a bit annoyed. “I’m not saying that the alpha you met was your soulmate or anything like that. Just that, going by what you described to me, the two of you are highly chemically compatible.”
By the time Tony was finally able to tear himself away, Steve was carrying a bag of god-only-knew what and walking alongside Tony, who seemed like he was on cloud nine. It reminded him of the time he’d been dating his ex Peggy before they’d decided to just be friends. She’d go shopping and Steve would happily help to lug home the ‘spoils of war,’ as she’d call them. Not that this was a date or anything, Steve told himself while trying to ignore the blooming warmth in his chest.
Tony positioned himself in between Steve’s legs in the stirrups. From what Steve could tell, there was just enough space for him to stay on his knees comfortably. As Tony steadily adjusted the position of the stirrups, some distant part of Steve’s mind that wasn’t dealing with the onslaught of sensations wondered if Tony planned this when he designed this whole setup. Knowing Tony, that was probably the case. He couldn’t help smiling to himself as Tony leaned forward to kiss him.
Steve was. His balls were drawn up tight as the alien’s legs fondled them and his cock was so hard it was painful. He was leaking so much precome that it only added to the slick that the creature had already coated him with.
She shot in an unimpressed look. “You sure? Seems like your mind is actually a few floors up from here.”
The creature was winding around toward his back as it made its way lower. Each leg felt like hundreds of points of pleasure racing like lightning across his nerves. His hand was still on his cock, which was still so hard it almost hurt. Steve felt like he could only hold on as his cock continued leaking precome against his stomach.
Tony pushes his forehead against the glass wall of the elevator, though it’s now long since warmed from the heat baking off of his body. He’s burning up from the inside out, every nerve in his body lit up with pleasure. The weight of Steve’s come sitting in his gut is a constant reminder of how closely they’re connected.
He felt Tony’s groan more than heard it as Tony rested his head on his chest. “God, Steve. You can’t just
Steve could feel his eyebrows practically hit his hairline. He shouldn’t have been surprised, and, well, this
“Steve. Come on. How long have we known each other? Nothing is dumber than some of the shit we’ve done.”
“You okay?” Steve asks as he reaches for Tony. It’s a statement to how tired Tony is that he lets Steve feel his forehead without any protest. “You’re pretty warm…” he glances away for a moment and Tony can see him clench his jaw.
Tony glanced up to see the man scrutinizing him with concern. The amount of sincerity in those blue eyes was almost too much to take this early. He needed a shower. And a massage. And maybe to kiss this guy’s pretty pink lips. ...Well, shit.
Steve found himself caught between two impulses: to listen to Tony or keep giving in to the pleasant haze that was still within reach. Even if he did want to comply with Tony’s order, his limbs wouldn’t cooperate. As he tried to move, his groin rubbed up against the creature’s body again. It responded immediately, resuming its undulating movements against his groin.
Tony’s gaze locked with Steve’s, though his expression was no longer flirty and lust-filled. He had the same look in his eyes that he had whenever he started on a new version of the Iron Man armor.
“You’re going to feel something weird,” Tony said from where he was fiddling off to the side. “Probably a little cold. Definitely slippery. Try to relax into it.”
“W-wait a sec,” Steve started to say. This wasn’t usually how things went at the end of a sparring session.
Steve knew that voice, though he hadn’t heard it in over 72 hours. He couldn’t resist a sigh as a familiar figure entered his peripheral vision.
To his credit, he did start doing better. Natasha was right; he needed to focus on the match instead of letting his mind wander to other things. Even if he hadn’t talked to Tony in almost three days by now.
of his dreams lately were of Steve. And in all of them he was writhing in ecstasy as he was violated by an alien bug. Tony had seen a lot of weird shit in the past few years of his life, but this still took the cake for being pretty fucked up.
That left Steve to bend down, get his arms around his shoulders and haul him up. He wasn’t that heavy and Steve hadn’t lost much of the muscle he’d built up while in the army. Still, it wasn’t exactly easy going on the stairs. By the time they got to the third floor and the door opened with Steve’s keycard, he was just glad to be able to rest for a second.
With the power out, the building’s state-of-the-art air filtration system isn’t working either. Even then, Tony didn’t think he’d be
“Fu-fuck, I always forget how big you are, somehow,” Tony said breathlessly. Closing his eyes, he focused on pushing down further, taking Steve in inch-by-inch. For a while, the room was silent except for the sound of Tony’s occasional grunts and the rush of blood in Steve’s ears mixed with his own heavy panting.
By the time he’s reached the elevators, he’s running on autopilot as various pessimistic scenarios continue to run through his mind. He’s imagining Bucky’s look of disappointment when the elevator arrives. As he steps through, he barely notices the other occupant in the corner, and presses the button for the lobby.
When he came back to himself, he glanced down to see the other end of the creature hovering in the air above his groin. His cock was still cradled against his underbelly, held securely by a few of its legs. When he tried moving his hips, the creature responded by wiggling the legs holding his cock. He practically choked on his own breath. Even though he was still hard, he was starting to get oversensitive. The continued onslaught of sensation was becoming overwhelming.
Tony’s eyes widened briefly before he started laughing. He was glancing down at his hands on the edge of the examination table. He raised his head to smile at Steve. “God, I love you so much.”
Glancing up at the display over the nearest door, Steve realized that his stop was next. Sure enough, the pleasant female voice announced Takadanobaba Station coming up. Steve quickly reached down for his duffel and made the awkward shuffle toward the door by politely moving through the crowd around him. People moved readily enough despite the lack of space to move to, and Steve was by the door by the time the train slowed to a stop.
He rubbed his wrists as he hesitantly met Tony’s eyes. “Thanks,” he said, sounding subdued even to his own ears.
Once they hit the smaller alleys off of the main road, Tony really did turn into a kid in a candy store. Steve could barely keep up as he watched Tony go from storefront to storefront, eyes wide as he looked at the various components they had on sale.
Guilt was unfortunately something he was all too familiar with in bed. The few times they switched, Steve could keep fucking Tony for hours, even into a second orgasm. As great as that was, it always left Tony sore the day after. No matter how much he insisted it was okay, Steve would once again feel that familiar guilt.
Tony just raised an eyebrow. He’d shifted from apprehensive to inquisitive, which was also a bad sign. “I’ve been going about all of this wrong, haven’t I?” He took one step closer to Steve. “It really didn’t harm you?”
“Yeah…” Tony glances toward one of the floor to ceiling windows of the penthouse. That alpha is somewhere out there in the city, and Tony can’t stop thinking about him. “I sent him home with Pepper, but you know how I tend to intimidate people.”
The door opened to a hallway filled with lockers, which Steve knew from the information card he’d been given was the locker room. He slowly made his way to the locker matching the number on his keycard while doing his best to support the man. When he finally reached his locker, he carefully settled the man on the ground while he opened the locker to stash his duffel bag in the cramped space. When he glanced up to find a pair of slippers with a note that politely requested that he leave his shoes in the locker, he realized he had a bit of a problem. There was only one pair of slippers, and the man he’d helped up here was still wearing his very fancy, clearly expensive shoes.
The receptionist smiles at that. “Thank you for your time, Mr. Rogers. Do you need to have your parking validated?”
Fondness washes through Tony. Steve’s possessiveness is kind of adorable. His fond thoughts are cut off by Steve shifting slightly, which pushes his knot against Tony’s prostate. He can’t help moaning.
It turned out he wasn’t in a room at all. It was some kind of enclosed space with a little bit of light coming from the direction of his feet. That was weird enough; then he glanced down to see someone asleep at his side. That must’ve been who he heard.
. It’s almost like that smile alone could light up the dim space. Tony blinks a few times, dazed. Fuck this oncoming heat. It’s starting to mess with his head. He can feel the sweat soaking through his shirt and starts removing his jacket. Might as well—with the power out the air conditioning is off. Once he’s got it off, he finds Blondie staring at him.
Thankfully, this capsule was bigger than Steve had assumed. He was able to position himself and his ‘guest’ on the soft futon layering the bottom of the small sleeping capsule.
The last two took a bit longer to push out, but with Tony’s assistance and his other hand on Steve’s dick keeping him hard, Steve managed one more orgasm just as the last one passed by his prostate. He was so overwhelmed by this point that he didn’t realize he’d come until he glanced down to see Tony’s hand still on his cock, dripping with his own release.
Tony shrugged. “Yeah, but I don’t have to go back just yet and I can cover both of us tonight.” He offered Steve a lopsided grin. “Least I could do for my knight in shining armor.”
He hears Steve exhale sharply. “It’s so much better. I’m glad.” The sincere relief in his voice is so strong, it sends a shiver down Tony’s spine.
“First of all, I’m pretty sure we’re on a first name basis by now.” Tony nods in the direction of Steve’s apartment. “Mind if I sit down? Took me a bit to find your place.”
Steve considers the man’s offer. Ruts aren’t exactly pleasant spent alone. And, well, if he’s offering… “You’re really sure?”
Eyes still shut, Steve shook his head. “N-no, wanna get them all out. F-feels so good, Tony. Just… s-so much, too.”
Tony groaned as he freed his cock from its confines. He glanced at the vitals to make sure that Steve was still okay before wrapping a hand around himself. The suit wouldn’t be ready for another ten minutes, and it wasn’t like there was anything else Tony could do until then. Might as well reach new heights of depravity while he was at it.
They ended up heading further north on the Yamanote Line to Ikebukuro, an area that Steve had heard about but hadn’t had as a priority on his list. It turned out to be worth it, though, once they found Sunshine City mall and the huge Christmas tree displayed within.
For some reason he’d had the smart idea of taking the train back to his hotel, which had ended up with him getting lost in Shinjuku station–seriously, how many exits and entrances did that station have?!–finally getting his ass on the Yamanote line only to get off at the wrong stop. Oh, and that was the last train home. What the actual fuck.
He lets the waves of pleasure wash over him as he relaxes into the sheets. He’s hard, but he doesn’t even care about that right now. It feels good just to be used like this. And sure, Steve isn’t
“Though after examining what few samples I still had left of the creature, it’s probably for the best that you went in as opposed to any of the rest of us.”
That’s what Tony was caught up about? So maybe it wasn’t that he’d been disgusted by what he’d seen. Maybe it was guilt that had kept him occupied the past few days.
At the very least he could get the bottle to the man’s lips. Sure enough, he drank gratefully once he was able to. He emptied the small bottle in no time before pulling back with a gasp.
Steve takes a deep breath and then launches into one of the most bizarre stories Tony has ever heard. Apparently, the super soldier serum not only gave Steve enhanced healing abilities, it also passed that property onto his body fluids. Including his semen. Tony can’t even think of a clever innuendo as Steve goes on to briefly explain how he’d discovered this fact by accident during the war. Needless to say, it had been life-saving for the Howlies.
By the time their plates were empty and they were getting up to go, Tony had made up his mind. He grabbed Steve’s hand after he’d tossed out his food.
“What!?” Steve watched in disbelief as Natasha headed toward the women’s locker room. She was just going to leave him like this? Was this some kind of elaborate prank? “Nat! Wait, you can’t just leave me here like this!”
Steve couldn’t help chuckling, as much of a strain as it was. Tony actually looked embarrassed for once.
Steve stepped back, too. He cursed his fair complexion as he felt his face rapidly grow warm. “So you saw everything, huh?” He hadn’t been sure how much Tony had seen, but JARVIS had said that Tony was carefully monitoring him the whole time. Other parts of him were taking notice, too, much to Steve’s horror. A distant part of his mind was now occupied with wondering what Tony had been thinking as he watched Steve back then.
“Yeah…” Blondie says, sounding resigned to his fate. “I was already having a hell of a day. Guess this is par for the course.”
Steve tried to think through his post-orgasm haze. His thoughts felt hazy, like his mind was full of soft, warm clouds. The intense pleasure radiating from his skin was like rays of bright light piercing through his clouded mind. It was so much easier to just let himself give into it and let himself
Only a few minutes earlier, he had carried Steve through the decontamination chamber, which involved awkwardly holding his unconscious body in a bridal carry as they were both sprayed with disinfecting foam that was then washed off with a quick and efficient spray of high pressure water. There was nothing like awkwardly toweling off your unconscious team member after they’d… gotten intimate with some freaky alien bug.
Waking up would be interesting. Steve was an early riser, though, and figured he’d be awake before someone sleeping off some drinks.
“Oh, fuck,” he groans as the constant current of pleasure hits another peak. He has to grab the railing by his side to hold himself up. He’s never felt anything like this before, even during one of his rare ruts. It’s like he’s losing his mind, and the more he gives in, the more he enjoys it. “Y-you okay?” he asks.
The pressure seemed to stabilize as Steve exhaled heavily. He thought back to the diagram he’d seen a few days ago and realized just what the object must look like. Even with the ample amount of preparation he’d had, though, this was a tight fit. He grunted as what be an egg-shaped object continued to push until suddenly the pressure was gone as it passed through the tight ring of muscle. He gasped as he felt it slip inside.
“What do you mean, exactly? Is that why it was able to affect me despite the serum usually protecting me from other things like this?”
embarrassment?” Tony pushed Steve’s hand off his shoulder and stepped back. “Steve, that thing pretty much violated you!”
“Strip,” Tony said as he set up what looked like a pullout tray attached to the bottom of the table.
Bruce held his hands up as though anticipating a different reaction. “Though honestly, I don’t mind. Your safety is far more important than getting a sample of the creature.”
“How about you walk me through this?” Steve asked, hoping his look conveyed what kind of tone he was going for.
Steve almost immediately regrets stepping into this man’s personal space because he’s hit with an intense wave of sweet omega scent. Oh God, how did he not notice before? The man smells like an omega in his second or third day of its heat. He takes a step back and hesitates.
“I gotta,” he breathed out. “F-feels so good, Tony. You have no idea.” He felt the creature’s other end move across his torso and let out another groan.
His expression softened. “I’m still going to take the extra precautions to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
“Can you open your legs a bit?” Steve’s voice is so soft and soothing, Tony thinks to himself as he complies easily.
Steve glanced down at his stomach again and gasped when he realized Tony was right. He could see the way his stomach was swelling even further under Tony’s hand. Really, it should be alarming, Steve distantly thought to himself. Instead, it was the hottest thing he’d ever seen. His cock certainly agreed with him, not even letting the amount of times he’d already come deter it from filling out again in record time.
Steve let himself sink back into the sea of sensation that he’d been floating on for so long, now. He was still so
He wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t even get a sound out before the fourth egg was pushing against his hole. It was obvious by this point that they were gradually increasing in diameter so that each intrusion felt as intense as the last one. The vibrations against his prostate only got more arousing as he started to feel oversensitized. He let out a low groan, his cock twitching as the egg slowly shifted past and the vibrations ceased. With four off the egg-shaped objects inside of him now, he could feel all of them moving inside of him. He felt full, and Tony didn’t show any signs of being finished yet.
Steve groaned, his head hitting the headrest with a faint thud. “So damn full,” he murmured in agreement.
With all of the precome making it stick to his skin, his boxers were proving to be difficult to push down.
“I’m serious!” Tony yawned just for show. “Going to head to bed right now. I’ll see you later.” He cut the call before Bruce could respond. Even he had to admit he was being a dick, but he actually was tired now that he thought about it. A nap couldn’t hurt. He had a cot in the corner of his workshop for these occasions.
When Steve returns, he’s holding a small tube. That’s all Tony sees before he feels the mattress sink under Steve’s weight.
“Exactly,” Tony said. “The idea is that you can inject thousands of these tiny nanites into people and they can take measurements far more efficiently than taking a sample and sending it to a lab. At the moment we’re just testing how accurate those measurements are.”
. A wave of discomfort hits him hard, the stomach cramps from earlier getting worse, and he leans against the wall for support. His vision starts to blur, and the cramps eventually settle into a deep ache in his gut. What the hell? This feels like what he’d expect from the second day of his heat, not the gradual build up of the first day that he remembers. This is why he despises his heats—they’re a battle against his own biology.
Well, Steve hadn’t expected that response. Before he could react, he felt something metal click over his wrists. As light on her feet as always, Natasha was up and did a quick flip backward, coming down to snap something down against his spread ankles. The magnetism kicked in and they pulled his legs together, locking them.
Anticipation and arousal rolled through Steve as seconds seemed to stretch forever. He opened his mouth obediently when Tony’s fingers pressed against his lower lip. And then he felt the touch of hot, slick skin as Tony pressed the head of his cock against his lips. The head of his cock was already leaking copious amounts of precome as Tony pressed into his mouth. Steve couldn’t help the moan as he accepted the intrusion.
“Hey, you okay?” The man drops his portfolio and steps towards Tony with genuine concern in his eyes. He takes two steps before stopping in his tracks and starts glancing around before focusing his gaze on Tony.
.” Steve can’t help it, his hips push forward with more force as he closes his eyes. There’s nothing he wants more in this moment than to fill Tony with his spend—until he looks pregnant with it, until anyone who sees him will know, without a doubt, that he’s Steve’s.
Eventually, he hears Bucky stomping around the kitchenette behind him like a disgruntled bear—which means it’s almost afternoon. He hears the fridge open and close, then the sound of Bucky slowly making breakfast. Part of Steve wants to help him, considering Bucky’s not wearing his prosthetic today, but then he hears footsteps getting closer.
Steve was in a daze when Tony finally pulled back. It was like the rest of the world dropped away and all he could see was the way Tony’s eyes were focused on him so intensely. Steve had seen the way Tony could work on multiple projects at once; so having all of that intense energy fixated on him was a heady feeling.
Just then, he heard the sound of footsteps approaching. A shadow fell over him and he glanced up from his position to see Tony glaring down at him.
The person next to him stirred before trying to push himself up. Who was this guy? Was he his kidnapper? Were they shipping him somewhere to harvest his organs?! He glanced toward the light at the other end of the tube or chamber or whatever the hell it was and tried to frantically crawl toward it. Unfortunately, he got tangled up in the other occupant’s feet and fell forward on his face.
Once the cloud of snow has cleared, Tony finds himself lying on the white blanketed ground, staring up at the sky. At least he was able to cover his unarmored companion, he tells himself as he catches his breath. He’d check on Steve if he could. But hey, Steve can fend for himself. Tony just needs to rest for a second. The cold snow is soothing on his back. Best not to think about that too much, though. He slowly closes his eyes…
His life is over. There’s no other way to look at things. He sighs into the art supplies catalog he has draped over his face. He’d been tempted to do a Google search for ‘so you went for an interview and ended up fucking the CEO?’ but had a feeling that wouldn’t lead him anywhere useful.
,” he said, tone breathless. His gaze drifted upward to meet Steve’s. “I know this sounds weird, but watching you do that was kind of… beautiful?”
“It’s a nasty-looking gash, but not too deep. So I’ll clean it up as best as I can before I bandage it up, okay?”
“Giving you the best orgasms of your life,” Tony said distractedly as he turned to a side table with what looked like medical implements on it. “This is 100% tailored to your comfort.” Tony gestured at the apparatus, which was set close to the ground now.
The other occupant of this strange prison moved closer into Tony’s limited field of vision. In this light, the man’s eyes looked very, very blue. His blond hair framed his face almost like a halo. This couldn’t be the afterlife, could it?
Tony reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose, which was a rare sign of defeat. “You really want to talk about this?
He progressed slowly through the rest of the lab, going from room to room. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until he hit the fourth connected room. There were shattered bits of glass on the floor surrounding what used to be a containment chamber. Some thick, clear fluid tinged with green was leaking from the broken chamber down toward the floor in the same vicinity as the broken glass.
Steve hesitates. “That’s probably the hormones talking. I can… move back to the other wall if you want.” And he would, even if his dick is a hot brand throbbing in his pants. Even as thoughts of claiming this omega sneak into his thoughts.
Steve lay there on the mat, stunned and in disbelief for a few moments, before he regained his wits. Natasha had been talking to someone, which meant that she wasn’t doing this alone. He had no reason to distrust her and could only assume this really was a prank. Who could she have planned this with? Clint and Thor were out of town, which only left…
Tony forced himself back into the seat in front of the monitor room’s main console. His leg was tapping rapidly against the floor as his hands fidgeted restlessly. Situations like this were his own personal hell. He hated watching someone get hurt due to his own negligence and not being able to do anything about it. He trusted JARVIS to monitor Steve’s vitals, but… that didn’t mean that Steve was okay. The second the armor was ready, he was going to bust in there. He didn’t care if he had to tear down half the lab to save Steve.
By the time Tony reached the lab door, it was in full lockdown. That much was expected. What he didn’t expect was to run into Steve decked out in his full uniform. Glancing down at his own pajama pants and t-shirt, Tony was impressed with Steve’s readiness at 3 o’clock in the morning.
Steve let out a sigh of relief. That was good, at least. The last thing he needed was to find out he was carrying some weird alien eggs inside of himself like in those terrible science fiction movies he’d watched with Tony for his ‘cultural education.’
"Listen, I don't buy your cosmological nonsense about balance in the universe, and the world is full of so-called 'unusual natural phenomena' almost every day, plus you can't prove these are related." Tony said.
"Go back and do what? It's raining, you have to rush home to collect the clothes, or suddenly remember to leave the stove on before going out." Another corner of the road collapsed under the rays.
"It doesn't matter if it's iron or not iron. There's nothing alive in front of my high voltage." With these words, Electro sent out a high voltage to them again.
"Hey. Seriously? Do I look like I lied? I don't have any backup. Sorry, guys, you are collateral damage."
At 4:32 in the morning, he was in the bathroom with Steve. The running water drowned out the call, so he missed the call completely. Now is not the time to blame himself. Tony put on his armor and flew out of the mansion.
If Steve knew I was afraid of darkness, he'd laugh at me. Tony thought. Thanks to Doom's out-of-order data, I haven't forgotten him. I even remember every nuance of his face when he laughed at me. The narrowed blue eyes, the little wrinkles around the corners of his eyes, the corners of his mouth, and the slightly raised tone that became a little bit more mellow. If I argued, he would kiss me. I would lose my logic and forget what I wanted to say. Tony's heart warmed as he thought of these. He wanted to find the Old Man quickly.
"Listen, the mudslide is less than a kilometer away. You've got to get out. I'll catch up." Tony carried a wounded man from under the building and handed him to a policeman nearby.
"I'm not. I have questioned of Tony's irrational behavior, but I haven’t probed into it. I have chosen to trust his authority, his experience. After all, he founded Force Works, right? All of this might have been avoided if I had been more insistent."
A fire was roasting a pheasant, which Clint had shot. Spider-Man, who was sent to catch fish, apparently came up empty. But the person who ate most of the pheasant was Spider-Man.
Steve stood up, pushed open the door and went out. He slipped down the narrow corridor, almost tripping over a toy the children had dropped. He shook his head and smiled as he reached down to pick up the toy. He set it on the table in the living room downstairs. Then he went out of the house, across the yard, opened the gate, and went into the street. He walked against the wind, felt a sense of relief in the night breeze.
Captain spoke with a serious face, who dared not to listen. They both shut up, and started to save people. As they walked out of the secret base carrying the last of the wounded, the caves collapsed behind them. Iron Man was not outside.
