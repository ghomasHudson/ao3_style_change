Tony wasn’t sure if this was a good plan, or an insane one. He wasn’t sure he Steve would react, he didn’t want Steve putting up his walls, going all Captain America on Kamala. Whilst she’d probably enjoy it at first, she seemed like the kind of girl who would notice it was fake, and she deserved something better than that. At the same time, what if Kamala was overly…
"Some people collect stamps, some collect paintings, and I collect cars," Tony chimed in, as if he had read Steve's mind.
"What the hell…" he muttered with a smile and walked over to the table, kneeling down so he was in level with Tony.
The gang let out impressed howls and talked among themselves. A few moments later another boy asked, "Have you seen any of the superheroes?"
Steve suppressed a sigh when Bucky let out an extremely loud laugh. He felt like the other man was treating him like a toddler who was trying to say his first words. Luckily, before he could complain, Natasha walked into the room and offered him a set of clothes.
Steve shook his head, removing his hands from his face. Staring at the wall, he cleared his throat "I won't blame you, if you want to leave."
"But listen-" Rhodey started to argue again. Tony sighed, dropping the key lime pie on the counter and walked over to grip Rhodey's shoulder lightly. "No, you need to listen, Rhodey. The last months haven't been easy on me or Steve. Especially in Steve's case. He deserves to have a good day. So, please don't spoil it for him."
Holding his breath, Peter cracked his bedroom door. He really hoped that it wasn't one of those days. Because Peter wasn't sure he could take it on top of all the stress he had been going through at work and with MJs father.
Peter stayed silent as he was dragged over to a small group of boys. He stood awkwardly as Johnny started to introduce him. Peter felt himself wilt as the others stared at him.
Tony felt his palms sweat as he walked into the restaurant with Steve. It may have been his anxiety, but it felt like their date night was already taking a big dip. Steve had been silent on their drive, answering Tony's questions with nods or curt answers.
Tony waited patiently for May to walk away so he could pester the man without getting chastised. The brunet almost pounced on to the other man the second May walked away. "Hi! I'm Tony. I live across your house."
Joey started gurgling excitedly again and Peter assumed that at the moment his son was pleased with getting raspberries blown on his belly.
"Tones, would you get Steve a change of clothing?" She asked, her eyes glimmering with an emotion he would regard under the category of kindness.
He was not lying. Peter did get acquainted with Sue's little brother, Johnny last weekend when they had gone to the weekly cookout. Tony had made friends too. He had hung out with Clint Barton who lived a few houses down. The man was an ex-sniper in the army. He had come a few years back due to a medical discharge. Now, he was happily married to a high powered lawyer, Natasha Romanov. Tony had talked to her too, she was a nice woman. Even if a bit scary.
"Well, normally I would jump at an offer as delectable as this one--" He paused to wink at Sunset. The woman smiled shyly, rolling her eyes in exasperation-- "But considering that I'm in an extremely satisfying relationship with a beautiful man, it will be a hard no from me."
The morning after Peter tried to wake his father up but he wouldn't move. Peter crouched down to take his pulse, confirming what he already knew. Peter didn't care to wipe the tears trailing down his cheeks as he leaned over to kiss his father on the forehead.
"I don't know what you're talking about… But my boyfriend is a sexy, artist professor who loves me and my son. He also has a heart of gold. Did I already say that? I don--"
"What you need to understand is that Stark Industries will always come second to me. I don't care if it's my father's blood and sweat--" He waved Obie's words away-- "Peter will always come first. My family will always be my first priority. So, don't expect me to stay silent when you treat him or Steve like dirt."
Steve cleared his throat, "Did your parents not warn you about going into others' house without permission?"
The brunet was pleased to see that all the pain had vanished from Steve's face, replaced by a bright smile as he listened to him talk.
He pouted on seeing that Steve wasn't online. It wouldn't be completely wrong to say that he was worried, Steve had been absent all day. He hadn't seen the blond in the morning either. Seeing his empty garage Tony had just assumed that he had an early class or something. But even when Steve was busy, he usually found time to talk to him in between his lectures.
"You're with me. This is not 2016, you're with me. This is the present, the present where Sam and Bucky have unresolved sexual tension. Where you teach Peter to draw. Where you are my amazing lover…"
Tony was about to ring the bell again when another voice interrupted them, "You probably shouldn't waste your time."
"I do hope I was anything like the man you needed…" The old man chuckled, running his slender fingers through Peter's brown locks of hair.
The brunet felt his heart clench on seeing Steve's red-rimmed eyes. Tony knew death was an inevitable force of nature, fashioned to balance out the universe. But, having to see your own child getting snatched away by it was the sort of pain that Tony never wanted to experience.
"Come on Stark, come over and join us in a rousing game of monopoly!" Clint crowed from the couch. Becca rolled her eyes beside him. Tony ignored them both and tried to find his son.
He flipped through the pages carefully and he had to admit, it was one of the most beautiful picture books he had ever seen. The only question was why would someone just give away such an expensive book. Sighing, Tony dropped down to the couch and the book on the table. He was about to slip into his bedroom when he saw the message inscribed on the book with a pen.
Squinting hard, he glanced back towards his room. The blond couldn't help but worry about Natasha seeing it. It must look like a tornado had hit his bedroom. Steve had started to pull out every single piece of clothing inside his closet trying to find a good outfit. Somehow, it felt like whatever he chose wouldn't be good enough for Tony.
Tony sighed feeling his heart break for Steve. Peter and himself had lost someone too. But Mary and himself were very unlike Peggy and Steve. For starters they hardly knew each other unlike Steve and Peggy who looked at the other like they hung the moon.
"Shut up! You were the best dad I could ever ask for..." Peter threw himself at the older brunet. He was ugly crying now. Sobbing against his father's frail chest.
Peter kicked the dirt and turned around to glance around. There weren't many balls to catch, and Peter was starting to get bored. He walked away to the cracked concrete, smiling as he saw a bellflower. He quickly plucked it out, admiring its beauty. The boy only jolted back on hearing someone scream his name.
Tony walked over to the guest room and knocked at the door nervously. After a small pause, Natasha answered him "Come on in, Tony."
Steve turned around and felt a smile tug at the corners of his lips on seeing a little boy and father walking up to the house.
Sue smiled and waved his worries away quickly, "Of course it is! We kicked Wanda out years ago and this guy doesn't ever come out. He's a hermit."
Rhodey huffed out a breath dramatically but nodded. Tony smiled and planted a wet kiss on the other man's cheek. He hadn't been lying when he said the last months had been hard. Steve had been struggling with his therapy sessions and it hadn't helped that the antidepressants Dr. Leshnerr had given him were dragging him down. It pained Tony to see someone he loved struggling so hard.
Tony was being completely truthful, Peter was in love with the book. His son had almost had a panic attack on not being able to find the book after he woke up. It was only after Tony had given it back and Peter had flipped to the end of the book that he had calmed down.
"Holy shit…" He mumbled under his breath as he stared at the cover of the book. It was painted by hand and quite professionally too. Tony ran his hand along the cover, showing a small brunette with a tiara on her head.
The genius hid a smile on seeing the fear on Rhdoey's fear.  He didn't have anything to fear according to Tony. He had stolen a glance at the drawing Peter had made last week titled
Steve seemed tense even when they sat down, making Tony's insecurities crawl out of their cave. It wasn't like it hadn't crossed his mind before that Steve was an extremely young, handsome and successful man who could have anyone he wanted, while Tony was… He was a forty-year-old single father. He knew he wasn't ugly, but he wasn't the man he was ten years earlier either.
Finishing a quick lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, Tony and Peter scavenged through their pantry to find something for their neighbors. After finding the tin of expensive cookies Pepper had gifted them earlier, they claimed themselves to be successful and marched outside.
Steve chuckled, feeling his heart swell with fondness as he looked at the indignant six- year-old sitting next to him. He clapped him on the back, "Sure is little man. Anyway I can help?"
Peter fidgeted with the sleeve of his sweatshirt uncomfortably as he sat on the couch with Johnny. He looked up at the screen of the television and quickly ducked his head. He could feel his cheeks burn with embarrassment.
"This must be your son!" Susan said, crouching down to meet Peter's gaze with her own. Peter, who had been fantasizing about meeting their neighbors till the moment, darted to hide behind Tony's leg.
"He already went over to Steve's with Clint. He's excited to spend time with Steve again. They hardly got to hang out all this time," Tony told Rhodey as they walked over to Steve's house.
Tony stopped grinning, replacing it with a soft mile, "Just because you couldn't handle your baggage one day doesn't mean you are a nut Steve."
Tony nearly preened at the compliment. He took pride in raising his son as a polite and kind boy. He gave Steve a small smile, "He is, and thank you for the book too. Peter loves it."
Steve took his arm away from his face and heaved himself up into a sitting position with a groan as he heard a ping. He searched around for his glasses blinking like a blind owl and reached for his phone. The blond smiled on seeing a message from Tony.
Tony tapped his fingers against the phone, imagining every worse situation associated with Steve. Cursing under his breath, the brunet typed in a message asking him to call him when he got the chance. Something clawed inside his chest on seeing that his text had not even been delivered to the blond. Before he could contemplate his feelings about the situation anymore Obadiah burst inside, announcing his presence loudly.
"So, why don't you think a bit about that?" He asked with an unsympathetic smile before he closed the door to the office, leaving a cowering Obadiah Stane behind.
"Well, we try." He let out a chuckle and turned to Obadiah, raising a questioning eyebrow at him. He was confused why he was sitting in his office making small talk to Sunset Bain. It wasn't like they would be benefiting from a business alliance. On the list of businesses trying to get hooked up with Stark Industries, Baintronics was dead last.
Steve smiled to himself, feeling his heart flutter. It felt lighthearted to someone who wasn't his pseudo-big brother or Sam.
Inhaling sharply, he smiled to himself. They had things to discuss about but that didn't mean their love was any less true. Nodding to himself, he twisted the doorknob next to him. Tony froze to the ground on entering the room. It felt like he had entered another universe, a universe filled with unicorns and fairies. The room was starkly different from the rest of the house with walls covered in bright print paint, plush toys scattered around and fairy lights adorning the walls. Tony stumbled over and sat down at the edge of the bed.
The blond bit his lip as Tony walked up to his car. It was one of those flashy sports cars that Steve and Bucky used to drool over when they were teenagers.  He couldn't help but raise an appreciative eyebrow on seeing the four wheeler, although he could not help but wonder how useful it would be for a single father like Tony.
Steve gulped hard hitting the send button. He was flirting with Tony. God, it had been almost a decade since he flirted with someone. His nerves were spiking with fear. But deep inside, even he had to admit it felt good.
"I'm not judging you Steve. Everybody processes grief differently. I just want you to know that it's okay to look for help. We're here for you. Okay?"
Peter held back a grimace. He kind of wanted to say no. He really had to be in a particular mood to see the old pictures they had of Papa. He was especially vulnerable as he had to make Tony understand that his Papa was gone last week.
Tony flinched, feeling the hair on his back stand up as Obie pounced onto him, making the paperweight crash down to the floor loudly. The brunet swallowed dryly, "Affirmative."
Steve nearly dropped his phone in shock. He hadn't even thought about replying, it was as if his fingertips were working on its own accord. Steve took the phone back and cringed, he must have seemed like an idiot too eager to jump at any scraps given to him. No wonder Tony wasn't replying to him.
Tony sucked in a breath feeling his heart pound against his ribs. It was exhilarating. It felt like pure bliss to finally get the elephant off his chest. He moved away from the desk to get his jacket And snapped, "Just because I'm silent doesn't mean I can't bite back."
strange noise his step-brother let out. Seeing the bright look on Bucky's face, Steve didn't know how to respond. Should he be happy that he was finally proud of one of his choices or should he be panicking about how sad he will make Bucky when he inevitably messes things up with Tony?
Sue pushed out a gust of air from between her lips and grimaced, "Well, Wanda used to say she heard loud crashing noises from his house when she walked by one night. But nobody believed the things she said."
"Can I get my ball?" He asked again. Peter moved closer to the door, it was slightly open. He felt his chest swell with relief on seeing Harry's ball lying near the window in the hall.
This had been the main reason Tony and Peter left their tower in New York. Living with just the help and occasionally Pepper worked when Peter was young. But Tony hardly felt it would be healthy for a six-year-old to grow up without peers of his own age.
Steve patted down the navy blue button down she had picked out for him and glanced at her for a second. The redhead gave him a fond eye roll. "Stop worrying, the blue brings out your eyes and those pants bring out something else."
"Get it?" He asked, pulling back. Tony felt his face burn on seeing the look his lover was giving him at the moment. His clear blue eyes were full of fondness, nothing but pure unadulterated fondness..
The boys groaned on witnessing the scene. Peter sprinted over to them, his heart still squeezing with fear on seeing the broken window pane.
Tony nodded looking over to the house she had pointed to. The house was constructed the same way almost all the other houses had been done. Uniqueness was a feature that suburban homes lacked, Tony had noted quickly.
To Peter's horror the ball was flying high, towards him. He dropped the flower in his hand and jumped up and down, trying to catch the ball. He felt his heart clench as the ball kept soaring above him until it crashed into a window with a loud sound.
He failed to hold back a snicker as the man entered his porch and started to shuffle for his keys. He couldn't blame Sue for blushing about the suburban hermit, he thought as he slipped into his bed. From what Tony could see the man looked like he was sculpted by Michelangelo himself.
Tony took a shaky breath as he walked up the lawn of the house opposite them. For all that he had whined about his son's pitiful social skills, Tony could be just as bad. He made stupid jokes when he got nervous and that managed to either affront people or scare them away from him.
The man offered them a hasty smile and walked off. Tony glanced up to Natasha nervously. The redhead was currently busy unbuttoning her friend's shirt raised an eyebrow at him. Tony glared at her. She just rolled her eyes, her green eyes twinkling.
The other man put the book down and glanced up to May and to Tony's deepest shock it was his neighbour, the wanted recluse. He watched with an open mouth as Aunt May chatted with the man, a smile that she usually stored away for Peter adorning her face. Seeing the affection on the old woman's face, anyone who didn't know May would think she was talking to her son.
Tony let out a pained groan as he climbed out of the car; he may be getting slightly old to drive for hours straight.
That was the moment it dawned on Peter that he was not inside his room. The little boy let out a cry and dropped the book. The man in front of him crouched down so he could see his face. It was the man he had waved at yesterday.
Bucky continued to sulk in the corner. Natasha gave him a slap on the back and walked over to hug Tony. Apparently, the redhead had already met him at a community event that the Osborns had hosted. It wasn't even a surprise that he hadn't been invited. Steve had turned down his neighbor's invitations to bond so many times that he was sure that they just pretended he didn't exist now.
The cafe was a lot more busy than Tony would have liked but it wasn't surprising considering it was lunch time. Tony stole one of the last seats available before he could be whisked away to the waiting room by one of the waitresses.
Tony gave her an amused look and scooped his son into his own arms. Peter buried his face into Tony's neck and grumbled, "Wanna sleep…"
Tony was pissed. He had to sit through hours of press and then endure another lesson from Obie about being calm towards intrusive questions. You would think that's the worst part of his day, but, no. Apparently, his hermit of a neighbor was now gifting Peter expensive books. Tony appreciated the thought but it would be better if he knew the man wasn't a pedophile or kidnapper or something. He had gone over to confront him but once again the house was locked shut and his motorcycle was missing.
"Mister, can I come in?" He asked loudly, slowly placing his foot inside the house. Seeing that the hall was vacant, he sprinted inside and took the ball. He safely put it inside his pocket, and Peter felt a smile play at his lips at the thought of giving Harry his ball back. He would be so happy.
"Because- Because you deserve better Tony." Steve muttered, stabbing his thumbs into his eyes to stop the tears, Tony guessed.
Steve gave him another grateful smile, "Thank you, Tony." He leaned back against his chair for a moment before saying, "But can we just pretend that I know how to shut my trap and have a normal first date?"
"And if you promise me, you'll accept others' help like a good boy. I'll be more than happy too. Elated, actually."
Tony raised a confused look on hearing her words. Why was this grown woman inviting his son to play with her brother?
Tony glanced up at Steve and let out a choked laugh on seeing the look on the blond's eyes. It had been such a long time since somebody who wasn't his family had looked at him with so much want and affection, that Tony felt his throat burn with emotions. Unable to find words, Tony jerked his head and the brunet was gifted for his effort by the sweetest smile from his date.
He smiled on seeing that Tony was sitting on the small desk near the window. The man had a soft smile on his lips as he turned to look at Peter.
"The guy who lives there is kind of an...um…" Sue stopped talking to glance at Peter who was gaping at both of them. She huffed out a laugh and told Tony, "Poo-poo person?"
Peter glanced up at him, his eyes round with surprise. Steve raised an eyebrow as the kid stared at him for a long moment. Peter nodded.
To his surprise, the older man let out a small purr. He leant over to Steve, batting his eyelashes flirtily before he muttered, "And you look ravishing, Mr. Rogers."
This got another loud set of cries and howls. Peter beamed happily as all of them declared him to be one of the cooler kids. Johnny punched him on the shoulder in pride. Peter just smiled; he was happy to have friends now. Maybe they would even play with him at school.
Obie stared at him coldly, he said, "You better hope so, Tony. You know SI comes before anything else."
Steve turned to him with the remnants of the smile he had given the old lady and Tony felt sucker-punched. He had known before that his neighbour was an aesthetically pleasing man. But seeing him up close, Tony couldn't help but decide which part of him was most beautiful, the periwinkle blue eyes, sharp lines of his jaw or the sweet dimple on his cheek.
Steve let out another sniffle, Tony could feel his shirt slowly get wet with his tears. He simply buried his nose in Steve's hair and held him as close as he could.
God, he remembered it as if it was yesterday. He had been playing with his lego set when a harried Tony had whisked him away. Pleading for him to just get into the car without asking questions. They had reached the New York Presbyterian to see Natasha sitting in a cold hospital chair with her head in her hands, her dark blue uniform coated with blood and shoulders hunched in complete defeat.
Steve was halfway done with the buttons of his shirt when he heard Bucky speaking with someone. He cursed under his breath on hearing Tony's voice. The blond quickly popped his head out the door and snapped, "Buck, I swear,  I'll throw you out of the window if you give him the second degree,"
Great. Fantastic. He moved away from a safe tower where they were walking distance from the police precinct to a place filled with crazies. And the way Sue talked, this Wanda woman wasn't anything to be cracked up about either.
"That's so great! I'm so proud of you for getting out of your shell, Stevie!" The older man beamed, clapping him on the shoulder.
Tony glanced up at Obie and felt his guilt ease on seeing the anger ebb away from the man's face. He gave him a shaky smile, "See, we can work everything out…"
"Is this your book, Peter?" Sue came over with a colorful book in her hand. Tony blinked as Peter snatched the book and held it close to his chest. He had never seen the book in his life, and it didn't seem like Sue knew the book either. Strangers were giving his son gifts? Tony felt his heart stutter at the mere thought. He couldn't stop worrying about it as he made his way into their house with Peter in his arms.
She shook her head, "He's not big on cooperation. He talks to no one, doesn't come for community events… The only time I see him is at five in the morning when he comes back from his daily jogging session."
Steve nodded in understanding. He had dreaded playing around as a child too. It wasn't that he enjoyed playing sports, it was just extremely humiliating when you fell over and had to use your inhaler all the time.
Tony let out a chuckle on seeing a familiar drawing. He should have known that Peter was working on his gift for Steve when he refused to show him what he was working on. He smiled on recognising a tall blond figure and brown haired man who he could only assume was himself. They were both holding a tiny figure between them.
Tony nodded and settled down beside Steve. He glanced over again to see that Steve had his face buried in his hands. Atleast, none of them smelled like barf anymore and Tony counted that as a win. He slowly slid over to Steve and opened his mouth to speak but the blond spoke first. "I won't blame you."
He wasn't lying. Peter adored Steve. Hell he knew that Peter loved him more than anyone except Tony. Even Rhodey. Which spoke a lot considering that the colonel secretly spoiled Peter with all of the things that Tony denied him.
"But that's my brand new ball! Daddy's gonna kill me if I go home without it," Harry told them, his lips wobbling with fear.
Peter couldn't help but grin as Joey let out a loud peal of giggles. He lifted his son into the air, blowing another raspberry on his smooth baby belly. This time he joined Joey in laughing.
Steve let out an annoyed groan and turned to glance at Tony. He felt his mouth go dry on seeing his date, Tony looked like a fucking model for Vogue in his perfectly tailored two-piece suit. Steve gulped hard and pulled his lips into a trembling smile, trying to return Tony's warm one.
Tony let out a gasp as Steve crashed his lips onto his. The blond cradled his free hand and whispered back,
Steve stepped away from his bike and jogged over to his front porch. He stopped trying to find the key to the door on hearing unfamiliar voices. Right, new neighbours.
Steve gently opened his hand and offered him a piece of paper. Tony glanced up at him confused. The blond gave him a nervous smile and muttered, "Open it."
The boy was a little ball of energy just like his Mia Rose. He was bouncing on his heels as he threw questions at his father. Steve fondly saw that the father was answering each and every question patiently, his eyes twinkling with love everytime he looked at his son.
"I have to say, I'm a big fan of how you turned Stark Industries around," Steve told him as he fiddled with the rim of his coffee cup.
The spacious two-story colonial was already straightened up with their things stacked into the respective places. A few hundred bucks could make a huge difference with moving crews, he had learned quickly.
"Oh, please, I don't want to be a homewrecker." Sunset intervened immediately. Tony gave her a grateful smile.
Steve snapped his head up and gave Tony a grateful smile. To Tony's surprise, the blond was an associate professor at NYU's department of literature. At the time he went to college, the professors had been balding, pot bellied men who wore tweed jackets, not young men who could bench press a truck. Anyways, it wasn't a wonder that Steve got the job at such a young age anyway. As they talked through various topics Tony realised that the man was more eloquent and knowledgeable than most of the
Steve shuddered, taking a moment to compose himself. He gave Tony a sad smile. "It's not your fault. Besides, I'm the idiot who brought it up on our first date."
Shaking his head, Steve walked out of the room, slowly making his way downstairs. The blond stopped to a halt on hearing noises. Pursing his lips he walked over quietly to catch the intruder red handed. Steve blinked on seeing the person sitting inside his living room. He watched silently as the little boy thumbed through the pages of the
Tony put Peter to sleep a bit later and walked back to his own room, yawning. He slipped into some comfy pajamas and stretched sleepily as he walked towards the window. He could feel the exhaustion from the day creeping up to him slowly. He started to close the window when he heard the revving of a bike. Tony glanced out in surprise to see a young blond man mount off the bike.
Tony scowled at Obie's choice of words. He knew Obie wasn't exactly the biggest fan of children but that gave him no right to talk about his son like that. Throwing the man a glare, he said, "I'm sure we can work on that. I'll have Pepper schedule more meet-greets and interviews this month."
"Are you even listening to me right now?!" He snapped again, his voice just as harsh as before. Tony stood frozen like an if his brain had stopped working. He was about to push his tongue into saying something but Barnes' shouting had ceased, replaced by a scuffling voice and what seemed to be a muffled version of a fight.
Tony grinned, he didn't miss the amused look Sunset sent him or the way Obie's face hardened, a dangerous glint forming in his rheumy grey eyes. Obie started "Boy-"
"Yes but not on my birthday, Rhodes." Tony rolled his eyes at the soldier. Tony really loved Rhodey, he loved him like a brother. But sometimes the man could get overbearing. Currently, he was insisting that he wanted to give Steve the shovel talk even though he knew it's his birthday.
Steve glanced at the arm Tony had offered for a moment before looping his own arm around it. Both of them started to walk down to Tony's house in companionable silence.
She wanted him to check on Steve? Tony felt his nerves start to fry again. What was wrong with Steve? If something had happened to his boyfriend, shouldn't Tony have known before Natasha? Tony felt his heart halt for a moment thinking about the unanswered messages.
"She was a surprise too. The most pleasant surprise that Peggy and I ever had," Steve continued, a ghost of a smile haunting his lips.
Tony nodded, swallowing the knot inside his throat. After making some more small talk with Sue, he retired into the house with Peter. Besides the scary recluse of a neighbor, Tony felt a bit relieved. The rest of the people on his street were bankers, teachers, and businessmen who wouldn't endanger Peter in any way. Besides, Sue's husband was apparently a scientist. He had some common ground there. So he wouldn't be the lone wolf of the street, at the least.
Tony let out a small chuckle, leaning over to press a chaste kiss on Steve's cheek. He whispered into his ear, "I'll see you around Mr. Rogers."
Steve felt a shy smile grow on his lips on finding that Tony was gazing at him, his eyes crinkling fondly.
He choked out a chuckle as Tony pulled away but saved himself of the humiliation by slipping out, "Flattery will only get you so far, Mr. Stark."
Steve shot a glare at him. It would have been more menacing if he wasn't wearing a soft pink pullover, his face wasn't covered with tear stains. Tony smiled at him.
"Peter, I really hope you will come over to my house. You can have fun with my brother Johnny," She told him kindly.
Steve felt his own widen as he looked at it closely. Poor Riri seemed to have done all the work. He could catch most of the complicated equations and very little of the diagrams.
"Basically, yes. We just walk around hand in hand. Flirt a little, maybe share a kiss or two and get a column in a handful of gossip magazines," Sunset supplied helpfully.
Stepping inside Tony couldn't help but feel guilty for looking around and wasting time, after sneaking a glimpse at Steve. The man's shirt which was soiled with bile before now seemed to be covered in sweat and what Tony could only guess were hus tears.
Steve guffawed looking over to Bucky. The brunet let out an annoyed snarl, "I can't believe after years of celibacy, you chose a joker."
"Steve!" He cried out, rushing over to the man who was crumpled out on the floor. He tried to heave the blond up. But Steve seemed to be intent on pushing back, letting out noises that reminded Tony of a wounded animal.
Steve silently stared at him, his eyebrows furrowed as if he wasn't trying to solve a particularly difficult problem.
Natasha and Steve didn't answer, the brunet sitting on the loveseat did. "I've had worse." He turned to Steve who was slumped over Natasha, he seemed too tired to even lift a finger.
He cleared his throat and walked over to take Peter's hand in his. He kissed his chubby fingers and asked, "Have you seen Steve, kiddo?"
Tony shook his head with a fond smile as he scooped his son into his arms. He aimed his big brown eyes at him, accompanied with a huge pout. Tony chuckled and placed a kiss on the little boy's temple, "Can that wait till we settle in, your Highness?"
Tony grimaced on seeing the painful look that quickly passed through Steve's face as his hand idly moved to his chest. He could almost hear the warning sirens, telling him to change the subject.
Obie grinned, much to Tony's annoyance and clapped his hands, "Tony, you won't believe what Miss. Bain told me."
"But--." Harry tried to protest but the boys had already scrambled away with their stuff. Peter moved over to Harry looking at him sympathetically.
"I didn't do it! Peter did!" Johnny cried out without even batting an eyelash. Peter gawked at the older boy, feeling wounded at the utter betrayal. He didn't even want to watch this. He had asked Johnny if they could just watch Power Rangers.
"Well, I thought it would be kind of unbecoming to pick food off my beard at dinner," He told Bucky with a small smile
Tony's lips were soft, warm and felt like a salve against all the wounds festering inside him. Steve let out a growl as Tony pulled away from him, feeling a twinge of sadness Tony's warm body moved away from him.
He glanced at Bucky who shared his worried look. Sighing, Tony quickly walked back inside, rushing to reach his lover. Tony stopped behind Steve's bedroom door on hearing a sob. He let out a small sigh, poking the pad of his fingers into his eyes.
The brunet glanced up on hearing Steve's voice. He shrugged on seeing that the man was eyeing him carefully, his azure blue eyes tinged with sadness.
He felt a light laugh escape from his throat on seeing Peter's face light up. He winked at the kid and gently plucked the book out of his hand. He thumbed through the pages slowly.
It had taken a few months for the meds and therapy to kick in. Tony could already see the slight differences. When he wasn't tired out Steve smiled more easily and he wasn't always wound tight like he would explode any given minute. The only problem was that since Steve started to go to his classes again they hardly had any time to spend together.
Steve raised his arms in surrender and scooched away from Peter. He glanced at the book again, and he felt the heavy urge to hide it somewhere safe. He quickly snuck a glance at Peter who was still looking at him hopefully. The blond stretched his lips into a smile, deciding that it would be better for the book to be in Peter's possession.
Sighing, he threw his phone on the couch and slipped his fingers under his glasses to rub at his eyes. He sure hoped Tony wouldn't stop talking to him. Since the last few weeks teaching Peter art and talking to Tony every now and then was the only highlight in his joke of a life.
"Don't run!" Steve called after him uselessly and settled back near the table where he and Peter usually worked.
over the blond's head. Oh. Steve crying made a lot more sense now. "Hence, the crying." He muttered.
Tony turned around to glare at the dirty blond who was still in the middle of a fit of giggles. He sighed and turned to the women again.
"Here you go, bud," He muttered, handing over the book, fighting the urge to take it back. Peter beamed at him and ran off towards his friend. Steve leaned back against the wall and watched with a hollow feeling in his chest as the two boys rushed away bickering with each other.
Steve knew Bucky was just trying to protect him like he always did. But he needed to understand that sometimes there wasn't anything he could do. He would never know how Steve felt, unless he went through it and the blond hoped to God, no one would ever have to go through what he did.
Peter quickly climbed up the stairs to meet his father. Peter wished Tony would come down stairs more often. He came down sometimes to play with Joey and talk to MJ and him. But mostly the brunet kept to himself. It really hurt Peter to see his dad who had been larger than life become this shell of a man he used to be.
Peter was a city boy through and through; he had grown up with indoor toys and playhouses. He was hardly acquainted with the fun that was roughing it out in the sun. Tony used to be the same, he could still remember how excited he had been on seeing the vast backyard surrounding Rhodey's house when he was a little boy.
Steve heaved himself up and stared at the phone, making sure he hadn't misread Tony's text. It wasn't like Steve hadn't noticed the approving looks Tony sent his way. But he hadn't thought the genius would ever act up on it.
The blond winced on finding the offending object. He must have dropped the picture when he had been storming through the room to find an outfit for his date. Putting the picture of his late family back on the nightstand, he fell back into his bed. Steve buried his face into a pillow, squeezing his eyes shut.
Steve felt his face go warm as he ducked his head. He felt the tension inside his chest loosen a bit on realising that Tony wasn't completely disappointed in him yet.
"Hey Sharon." He muttered moving on. He threw his jacket on the kitchen chair and started to move around the hall. It seemed like Sam's family had dropped in earlier. His sister Sarah was chatting with Natasha in the backyard.
Peter shrugged in disbelief and glanced at the others. He didn't believe in ghosts, and neither did his daddy. His father had told him those were just lies to scare little boys like him.
Tony took his coffee cup with both of his shaky hands and took a long gulp. He wondered if Steve would find it off-putting if he squealed like a teenage girl. It wasn't every day that beautiful academics called him brave and admirable and applauded him for one of the biggest turning points of his life.
Bucky cursed under his breath colourfully and walked out the door, announcing " Let me go fucking call Erik."
"Hi. It's me, Tony." He whispered, feeling his heart break on seeing Steve's puffy, red rimmed eyes. Steve stared at him, his eyes still looking lost.
Mrs.Storm's eyes softened a little as she stared at Peter. She hid her face in her hands for a moment and took a shaky breath. She looked up at Peter with a shaky smile. "I know, sweetheart. Why don't you boys go play outside?"
"Steve, Steve… sweetheart…" Tony pried the other man away from and took his face in his hand, gently pushing the blond locks away from his eyes.
Steve rolled his eyes, tipping his head back against the chair. He should have seen it was a trap. It wasn't like he didn't miss Mama Barnes. He missed her like a part of him. But he didn't have the heart to go over anymore. Not when Becca and her kids were over. The last thing he wanted to do was snap at the kids or something as bad. He no longer had the energy to play Fun Uncle Steve anymore.
Tony let out a small scowl on hearing the other man's words, he quickly snatched and admonished him fondly. "Hey, none of that! You know you can tell me anything and everything."
Peter gifted him for the response with a million watt smile and ran off to find his unfinished drawing.
The boys wanted to play baseball. When Peter confessed he had never played baseball before, they told him to stand in the back as a fielder. Apparently he was supposed to catch the balls that flew towards him.
He quickly composed himself and crouched down, wrapping his hand over the kid's shoulder blades, "Hey, hey. It's okay, little man. I know you just wanted to get your ball back."
Peter didn't think his daddy would allow him to watch this. The six-year-old felt a shiver run through his spine as he caught another glimpse of the screen. The man was trying to take off the lady's shirt. Why was he trying to do that? Peter would never try to do that.
Peter scrunched his nose, thinking it over slowly, and gave him a small nod before wiggling out of his arms. Tony laughed and let him dash inside their new house. The genius followed his son closely but paused for a moment, his hand placed on the doorknob. He swallowed dryly, surveying the cozy suburban homes. Tony could hope that they would be able to survive in the brand new environment. Shaking the thoughts out and commanding himself to think more positively, Tony headed into the house.
Steve let out a loud snort. He had heard more than a few of those excuses from his students too. It made no sense to him. If they had worked hard enough to get into NYU, they could most definitely continue working hard enough to submit their assignments before the deadline.
"I'm a big fan of your works. It's really cutting edge." She beamed at him. Tony silently wondered how the woman  managed to flash all of her teeth at him while she talked.
Tony stared out the window for a moment,  a mischievous smirk playing on his lips. He ducked his head and typed a few raunchy messages to send Steve. It was extremely fun to send his boyfriend explicit stuff, considering that the twenty eight year old man got flustered like a teenager after reading them.
"I really like you, Tony, and this wasn't exactly how I hoped our date would start. But all I can do now is to beg you to give me another chance."
Buckly let out another voice closely resembling one of a dying cat. Steve ignored him and grabbed Natasha into a quick hug before he could go get dressed.
Tony fell silent, knowing that Steve wasn't finished. He wasn't an idiot; he had noticed the use of past tense too. Tony glanced up to see Steve staring at the burning candle as if it had personally wronged him.
The boy let out a shriek of giggles on hearing something his father said. Steve felt his heart clench painfully on hearing the little kid's laughter.
Steve froze for a moment on realizing that the boy was now staring at him. His brown eyes wide as he sucked on his thumb. Despite himself, Steve flashed a grin at the kid. The small brunet's eyes widened for a moment before he smiled and gave him a shy wave.
The whole neighbourhood had been shown up. Well everyone except his closest neighbour. The only times Tony saw the man was when he came home from his early morning jogs or late night shifts. Which was completely fine with Tony as long as the man didn't develop new hobbies like arson or vandalism.
"Let's go meet them, Daddy! Let's go!" The boy tugged on his arm, making him stumble towards the front door. Tony let out a hearty laugh, his chest filling with warmth on seeing Peter's enthusiasm.
Some of his students were even passionate about the subject. He still remembered the day Kamala wrote extra pages for her essay; the girl had even added extra information she had procured from field research. It was one of the proudest days of Steve's short life as a teacher.
Steve smiled at how earnest the boy's words were. He rubbed his back softly and asked "What's your name, son?"
Steve cleared his throat, "It's just so unfair. Why her? Why not me? It just--." Steve let out a pained groan, his face bitter with pain.
"No, Tony. Listen." Tony pursed his lips, feeling his heart flutter as Steve took Tony's hands in his own. It was probably stupid, but suddenly, his head went blank. The only thing he could think about was how warm Steve's hands were.
…" She whispered again and again, her voice taking a softness that Tony had never witnessed before. She pulled Steve up and wrapped an arm around his waist. She quickly glanced back at Tony and the brunet straightened himself up quickly, showing her how ready he was to help.
Barnes' family had dropped in yesterday too. His family was Becca, a college girl who looked like Bucky's female clone and Mama Barnes, an older woman who wrapped her arms around anyone who was close to her. Tony had been victim more than once, letting out strangled cries everytime she squeezed him inside her arms.
Steve almost threw himself out of his chair on hearing a loud crash. He glanced around frantically as his heart pounded against his chest. He had been grading paper sleepily when he had heard the intruding sound. Heaving himself up with great difficulty, he moved over to the window.
Tony offered her a bright smile "I'm very glad you asked Miss. Potts. We are settling in wonderfully. Let me also tell you that Peter has a new friend, Johnny."
"I'm sorry,  mister. I didn't- Harry- the ball!" He squeaked out painfully, the words turning into sobs. Steve stood dumbstruck as the boy cried, which only made him sob harder.
"I don't know when you are gonna get this inside your wonderfully thick head but--" Tony slid over so that he was sitting on Steve's lap. He leaned forward, tangling his arms around the blond's long neck. He let out a satisfied hum on inhaling Steve's musky scent. He whispered into his ear, "It's me, you and Peter."
Steve let out a rough chuckle as he scratched his beard. He knew that Bucky hated his beard, even though Natasha, Sharon and for some reason his student, Gwen had said that he looked good with one. Bucky argued that if he didn't need a beard in more than twenty years, he didn't understand why Steve felt the need now.
At the time he had also considered the added bonus of hiding from the judgemental eyes of their neighbours.  But right now he couldn't help but wince at the worry at the back of his head, for he meant anything to Steve or was the blond just sowing some wild oats.
Tony shrugged, looking on gloomily as Natasha gathered Steve into a big hug. The redhead reminded Tony of a fiercely protective mama bear. But it didn't seem like Steve minded when he buried his face into her chest and sobbed painfully.
He nodded and offered an awkward salute as she let herself and Steve out of the room. Tony glanced around the hall quickly wondering where the hell Steve's room was. The times he had been over both he and Steve were drunk off their asses. The rest of the time they had spent together was mostly out. They were both comfortable with it considering they had agreed to take their relationship slow. It had been a while since either one of them had had a real relationship.
He had been almost on the verge of a panic attack inside his closet. Thankfully, Natasha and Bucky had decided to drop in. Bucky had pulled him out of the room and deposited him on the couch, while Natasha took it upon herself to choose his outfit for the date.
Steve sighed on seeing the neighborhood kids running away. They had probably sent their ball crashing in through the downstairs window. He already had enough unclaimed balls to start a mini-league. For some unfathomable reason, none of the children had the idea of asking for their balls back.
"Stark, go over to Steve's right now!" Tony blinked in surprise at the harsh favour of Barnes' words. Tony and the other man did bicker every once in a while but it was over silky matters like lack of taste in movies and the latter's old fashioned ways. For all he acted like a macho, big brother who would kill Tony with a shovel if he hurt Steve, he was actually pretty cool with Tony. Which was why Tony was confused about Barnes growling at him presently
"Bucky" Steve snapped, his heart skipping a beat at the fear of losing Tony because of a lame joke. Tony, however, seemed to take it in spirit. He let out a howl of laughter, "Oh, don't be like that sweetheart,"
Nothing good, Tony wanted to tell her. But he didn't think it would go well with Obadiah. So, he plastered a fake smile on his face. "Tony Stark."
"Then we should go introduce ourselves, Daddy!" Peter cried out happily, his face brightening at the prospect of new friends.
Tony nodded and rubbed his hand along Steve's cold neck. He flinched as Steve let out a pathetic whine and threw up all over the floor and himself. Tony tried not to scrunch his nose at the horrible smell of bile. Surprisingly it was a much easier task than trying to look at Steve who was still lying crumpled against him.
" The formal word tasted like dirt in his mouth, too honorable a title for such a man. "I don't normally make it a habit to wear my uniform outside of battle." He glared at everyone present. "It's despicable the way you all speak about the owner of this company."
Steve thought, and got a little chuckle out at that, which made Tony smile. Steve felt okay now, actually he felt exhausted. Like he'd just finished running a marathon before the serum, so he decided to let his drooping eyes fall down.
“We finally met again face to face just about a month ago. Ross was removed from involvement due to conflict of interests - too many super-powered people objected to his leadership. Everyone would only agree to sign the amended Accords if Tony and I were co-leaders. It was...scary.” Steve’s heart skipped a beat just thinking about it. “I thought Tony would hate me forever after I hurt him so bad. And maybe he still does. But he looked me right in the eye, in front of everyone, and welcomed me back. He shook my hand. It felt like I was shaking hands with a robot. We did talk after, though Rhodes and Bucky were in the room. Tony said he forgave me, but...” Steve sighed. “Things aren't the same anymore. He hasn't spoken much to me since. I try to reach out but, it doesn't really feel like he's forgiven me yet.”
"I know what a TV is, Tony." Steve shook his head, but walked over and sat down anyways. "It's weird though. The TV's here are different than the ones at my old SHIELD apartment. I can't figure out how to switch channels."
"I'll miss you too." Tony leaned back into Steve's hand, which had made its way to the short hairs on the other side of his neck. Then he was leaning forward, and closing his eyes. Poor Tony must be exhausted, after this long weekend. Steve took the hint and wrapped Tony up in a hug. The other man stiffened. He...must not have been expecting that? Surely Steve wasn't taking this too far, they'd been so close all weekend. But after a second, Tony's hands found their way around Steve too. It felt...wrong, out of sync. Like Steve had missed something, some clue. They broke their awkward hug and Tony smiled his best press smile. Steve could tell he was looking a little disappointed through it. All the same, Tony walked up the stairs, turned around to wave goodbye, then the doors closed and the jet was tugged onto the strip and took off. Steve watched until it was just a dot in the sky, then it was gone.
That was a huge relief. He wouldn't have to talk. He was still terrified and paralyzed, but at least he had something to focus on now.
Then Tony was gone. Steve turned around and headed back to the party, trying his best to keep a big smile on his face when he walked in.
Frantically opening a few more nearby doors, he finally found a bathroom and practically ran inside. He splashed his face with ice cold water, shocking himself into being fully awake. Crap. It's not that he didn't like Tony. Quite the contrary, he'd noticed a while back that he was becoming more and more attracted to the man. Or the idea of him? He wasn't precisely sure, as they hadn't exactly spent a lot of time together. Or had they? Really, if he thought about it, Tony was the closest friend he had in the future - the now. Steve was becoming more and more used to the idea of this time being his home. Of Tony being my home. Fuck, there I go again. It always comes back to Tony, doesn't it? Get it together, Rogers. He needs you right now. What he doesn't need is all this extra...stuff...when he's going through something that's important to him.
"So is that a yes or no on taking it slow?" Tony traced circles on Steve's chest with a finger while he zipped his pants back up with his other hand.
It had been a whole week, and he hadn’t seen Tony at all in that time. No one had. He suspected that FRIDAY was alerting him every time Steve got anywhere near the same room as him, if he was in the tower at all. Steve was mortified with how they had left things. He wanted to apologize. Wanted to beg for Tony’s forgiveness. He wanted to scream until he was hoarse. But it was like looking for a ghost. He tried going to the lab, tried to stay in common areas like the dining room and lounge throughout the day, hoping to catch him walking by. He even tried to go up to the penthouse once, but FRIDAY wouldn’t let him in past the front door. It was no use. He was nowhere to be found, and no one at the tower knew where he could be.
“You really don’t have to, sweetheart.” Steve pulled him in for a quick kiss between scrubbing his hair dry. It was wonderful how he could kiss Tony whenever he wanted now. “You know I like working out with the team anyways.”
"Ugh. Who can eat this early." Tony set down his mug and slipped on Steve's fluffy slippers by the door. "Don't feel like going up to get mine." He explained.
music playing now. Were his thoughts somehow manifesting into reality? He looked up and saw a band had set up at the front of the restaurant at some point during their dinner. How had he missed that? They were playing a slow, rhythmic beat filled with guitar notes and drums. It reminded him of the jazz he'd heard in New Orleans but...different. With flowy strings and light percussion instead of woodwind instruments.
"Exactly!" Steve took a long sip, it was delicious. He appreciated that Tony could understand, just because he couldn't get drunk didn't mean he wanted to be left out. If not for the taste, he liked the banter that usually accompanied social drinking. "So good. I can't remember the last time I've been to a place like this."
“You’re...you’re gorgeous.” Steve’s cheeks heated. Maybe he was being a little too heartfelt right now, but seeing Tony like this, adoration in his eyes, relaxed and open for him, it was like a dream, and he never wanted to wake up. Tony didn't seem to mind though. He chuckled, leaning forward, resting his head on Steve's shoulder, warm breath on his neck.
"The smell. Just a lot of mixed feelings that come with it." Tony put an arm around Steve's shoulders, urging him to go on. "Buck and I, we would stand outside the five cent stores and listen to the game on the radio. We couldn't get too close though, 'cause of my asthma. A lot of workers would smoke while listening to the game, so if I got too close I'd have a coughing fit. Sometimes when I wasn't feeling too good, I'd sit on the curb and Buck would go listen and rush back to tell me when they scored." He chuckled through a sob, and Tony squeezed his shoulder. "Then when I found Bucky, after they....after Red Skull got him. Old Gold was a big company and so they had a camp that processed prisoners of war. That's where we took him, and all the other soldiers. He was really out of it. The smell just reminds me of that day we spent at that camp. The only time I'd ever smoked one of these. Waiting for the doctors to work with him. I knew he would be fine, physically. But mentally...I didn't know if he would be okay. He was my best friend and now he's gone, and now everyone's gone. Everyone, Tony.
“Contractors?” Steve squealed. Was Tony building them a home in the penthouse? What on earth was going on?
“Oh good! I wasn’t sure if you remembered me from that New Year’s special we did a few years ago.” She said excitedly. Oh, Steve remembered now. He and Tony had been interviewed a while back for a New Year’s thing on TV - Tony had somehow convinced Steve to show up in a Christmas sweater while Tony sported some reindeer antlers to the interview. The whole thing had made Steve laugh so hard that he cried in the greenroom. He stood there, reminiscing on better times when he suddenly realized that Christine was still talking to him.
Tony watched as everyone scrambled to make their afternoon one that they would always remember. Just a few days ago, he felt like an intruder in his own home. Now, he was glad to be here, happy to see everyone so comfortable with each other, so comfortable with
The speeches were quick and seemed to rile up the crowd. Steve barely listened. When it came time for questions from the press, Steve was on auto-pilot, only answering the questions directed at him specifically, and giving his usual spiel on working as a team, and doing their best to make informed decisions on what threats to tackle. When Tony would talk, he listened intently, trying to make out any signs of what he was feeling, a tremble in his voice, any huff of annoyance - but he got nothing. Tony was just as charismatic as ever.
Steve just kept sitting and breathing. Seconds or minutes or longer passed. All he heard was his own breath mixing in with Tony's. Why could he hear Tony's breath?
He was so nervous about actually acting on his feelings though. If it was just a physical attraction, it might've been easier to make a move. But Steve was also completely infatuated with his genius mind, his sense of humor, his thoughtfulness, his humility...he could go on and on. That's why he'd been biding his time, hoping to find the perfect way, or perfect moment to tell Tony how he felt. He didn't want this to be a fling. He wanted their relationship - if they ever had one - to be long lasting and meaningful.
just like Tony.” Steve gently took all of Tony’s bags from him, and swung them over his shoulders like they
Steve opened his eyes again. Wasn't sure exactly why he kept closing them shut. His jaw felt sore, and he realized his whole body had gone tense. He consciously relaxed his jaw, then his eyes, his shoulders, and hands.
Steve sucked in a shaky breath. “I slept with...Tony. Kind of.” The deafening silence that followed was quickly broken with a snort from Bucky.
Tony gently set the flowers down on a console next to the door, then turned back and launched himself at Steve. He pulled him in by the collar, their mouths crashing, open and desperate. Tony groaned as he stuck his tongue down Steve's throat, blindly kicking the door closed behind them.
"No sweat, Cap." Tony handed Steve his phone back. "I probably fried your brain with all this techno-talk. You should go get some shut-eye."
alert him of Tony's presence. He was immensely grateful for it, but his stomach also churned with anxiety.
to rub this in Rhodes’ face.” She quickly pulled out her phone and started texting as Tony shook his head.
you have to say, alright?" He poked Tony's arm, which made the smaller man chuckle. "No holding back."
to get out there, this DJ is on fire and there's no one else here." Tony turned on the charm, batting his eyes with a pout, "Please? Be my dance partner?"
Tony threw an arm over his face. "Thanks, J." Well, if anything, at least he knew Steve was set to face the 21st century.
he thought to himself. "The project stands on its own merits, and should be carried out regardless of who proposed it."
"Yes!" Tony exclaimed, "They're the perfect candidate. Every winter they have rolling blackouts from overuse. Their whole country is linked to one grid centered here." Tony excitedly pulled up a map on a hologram and showed Steve. "If I could just get the biggest city on reactor energy, then the old power system could keep going to the rest of the country, and it would save so many people. Hospitals wouldn't need to shut down, small villages wouldn't need to worry about a big freeze, just by powering this one city!" Steve looked over at Tony, swelling with pride.
"Sure. Let's leave them alone, Hawkass." They retreated back into the elevator and then it was just the two of them again.
Okay, now that you've read this chapter - is it weird that I keep changing character perspectives halfway through my chapters? I feel like I want to shove all their wonderful happy thoughts onto the page lol! Next chapter might be full of changing POV's so I'm just checking that it's not too confusing 😅
looking Captain, wearing a dark five piece suit that hugged in all the right places. He was holding an enormous blooming bouquet of pink and red lilies.
As Sam’s mouth opened in shock, Bucky slammed a fist on the table and bellowed out a half-choke half-uncontrollable laugh. Sam turned and gave him an icy glare.
Steve didn't really want to. But Tony was making him feel better, so he did it anyways. He took a little sip from the bottle, coughing when it hit his dry throat, then another little sip. It helped his head hurt less, when did his head start hurting? He finished the bottle and looked at the phone again.
"But... Thor's going back to Asgard soon. And Bruce, he has work going on here and it's such a long flight."
” He hissed at Steve. “I don’t know what that Other-guy told you, or what he did to make you think you have any feelings for me, but you’re delusional. I’m nothing like him, so don’t expect that from me. Don’t expect one more fucking thing from me, you understand?” He raised his voice again so all could hear. “And now that I’ve thoroughly embarrassed myself, I’ll be seeing you all.” Tony announced, stepping out.
Tony could feel the friction of the bitumen road 5 inches below his foot. It was so blurry he couldn’t focus on it, yet it was
And that was the question, wasn’t it. How long had Tony loved him? He tried to think of an answer, he did, but he couldn’t think of an exact time where it wasn’t true, where it wasn’t the case. It was perpetual, he had just been to blind to see.
, and if he wanted, he could put his foot down and touch it at any time. They weren’t just travelling, they weren’t just moving through the world, Tony could experience, feel, and taste every nuance of the environment. The world wasn’t just a painting in front of him, the world moved
Tony clapped his hands together, breaking the moment. “So, are we ready to go on this historic world changing Steve-Rogers-Is-Introducing-Tony-Stark-To-Something-New-In-The-21
After a week, Lt. Colonel Rhodes, ‘Rhodey, please Steve, we’re not on duty, and technically, you’re not in the Army anymore’, arrived with a collection of clothes for Tony – including a new hoodie.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “I seem to recall that you dress in the exact same way when disguised, or did you and Nat not traverse through a shopping centre in 2014?”
“There is a restaurant called ‘Mighty Cakes’ in Sydney, Australia that delivers in their general vicinity,” FRIDAY replied. Tony could have sworn there was a hint of amusement in the AI’s voice. Good.
Steve froze, had he imagined it? He had to have. There was nothing else happening, no change in any of the beeping machines, and no other movement.
“For now," she added sympathetically, and Steve tensed. "It was a difficult surgery, his wrist alone needed 20 stitches. We’re keeping him in Intensive Care but,” she smiled, the kind of smile that dragged Steve's worries out of him by force, that set him at ease. “I don’t think some optimism would be amiss here.”
“Yeah, but it’s tacky. Something has obviously happened and this random rose isn’t going to fix things. Clint showed me that new Netflix comedy special, Ray something-”
Steve had been right though, the curry was so mild, he was surprised there was any chili at all. But they had cooked it together, all grossly domestic.
Tony focused on his gut, thinking about asking Steve for a favour, asking him for anything, didn’t cause his chest to tighten with worry. There was no invisible cord slinking it’s way into his lungs and cutting off air supply, and there was no rock growing and hardening in his gut. He was completely…
, just hanging between us. Every interaction, every glance, every conversation, some moment that would mean something different for me than it would for him would happen, and we would just be hammered by this thing over and over again until it becomes too much. Steve wouldn’t leave like that,” Tony snapped his fingers together, “he would be a stubborn ass about it and stick around as long as he could. But it would weigh on him, it would weigh on me.
“But it doesn’t. Thor would only be able to hold Tony with one hand, I can use both. I can hold him to my chest and run for it.”
Steve was numb, pacing the hallway outside the operating room. Suddenly, Bruce was at his side, de-hulked and a hand resting on Steve’s shoulder. “He’ll be alright Steve, it’s Tony, he
The ringing cut off, only to be immediately replaced by Natasha’s hard voice. “Tony, why aren’t you here yet? This is
“He was lucky, the blow was mostly knocked off course, only one of his kidneys was punctured, and our best doctor was conveniently free,” Christine said. “He's a brain surgeon actually, so for him this was, and I quote, ‘a walk in the park’.”
Tony nodded dumbly, not trusting himself to speak. It was moments like this that he couldn’t believe Steve was even real. The man would just, put Tony’s bag in his bedroom, without a second thought.
Worrying his bottom lip, Tony slid Steve’s sketchbook back on the bench. “I- I knocked it over whilst working. I hadn’t meant to see anything.”
“But then it’s nothing but winding country roads,” Steve said, handing Tony a helmet. “And there’s no thrill like that.”
Tony bit his lip, crossing his arms over his front., growing awkward immediately. Natasha wanted to groan,
“I wasn’t talking about the punching bag, I was talking about the rough-housing with a certain Nordic warrior with a hammer – but that applies too.”
between us that I couldn’t possibly break down. I would lose him, bit by tiny, inconspicuous bit, until he would be just a face I see in my dreams, or in the hallways.
Grinning, she slid out from the register and ran to the back of the store. Tony walked through the aisles aimlessly, gathering what he needed and soaking in the nostalgia of his childhood. Of all his years on earth, this store had barely changed. The yellow paint was peeling off the walls, the lights in the ceiling flickered sporadically, the constant smell of disinfectant permeated the air, and it was
Bruce leant over to Natasha, his eyes on Tony, who still had his arm wrapped around Steve. “Is it too late to change my bet?”
Steve swallowed thickly, stroking Tony’s palm with his thumb. He wasn’t leaving until Tony was alright. He would leave after, he didn't want to live colour blind again, but he had to let Tony find his colour again, set him free.
“Wait, son,” he said, looking at the boy on the table, and Tony almost rolled his eyes because ‘son’,
contributed. Each one had something they could give Tony, something to lull him back to the land of the living. Then there was Steve, sitting there, fretting.
“Now,” Natasha said, sitting to face him and taking his left hand, “are you going to tell me why you have decided that destroying your hands is the best thing to do with your day today?”
cared about Steve. Perhaps, at a time, Tony felt more than that, wanted more than just friendship – and maybe, sometimes, Tony ignored that niggling thought at the back of his mind, or that feeling low in his gut, that suggested he still wanted that, but that would never have been the case.
The early morning air was rather cold, and Tony was grateful that his getup included a hoodie. The streets were calm at this hour, so Tony was free to be more at ease. He passed a pair of teenagers sitting on the curb whilst waiting for the bus, and so pulled his cap lower on his head and readjusted his the hood to conceal his face. It was odd seeing anyone out this early, especially in Manhattan at 7am on a Sunday, but FRIDAY – through his glasses, told him that they weren’t a threat. Their heartrates were normal and they seemed at ease.
“That sounds like a lot of fun,” Thor said, piling another muffin onto his plate from the kitchen. He had arrived late today for family breakfast, as was the norm with him. Natasha glanced at his hands, they were clean – for once. Perhaps he was finally setting up the phone Tony had given him.
Tony rubbed the back of his neck, not surprised at all that she knew exactly who he was, that’s what he got for ditching the disguise, anonymity was almost a foreign concept for Tony. “Truth be told, this is my first time.”
I lose. Which I won’t. It’ll happen today. Where else would be more romantic for Tony than the fucking Botanical gardens? It’ll be today, or it’s not happening at all.”
“Because someone,” he said out loud so she would be sure to hear. “Neglected to mention that we didn’t have buttermilk, a key ingredient in the pancake making process.”
“Yeah, Ray Romano. And he said that the roses at the lights were a dud gift, that don’t have any value or something because your partner knows you didn’t put any effort into getting them.”
“But it would be awkward. We would dance around each other. We would pretend everything is normal, when it wouldn’t be. There would be this big, angry,
Tony gave a weak grin, hind mind still racing over what Emine had told him. “That’s great Steve, that’s really… great.”
“Yep.” – “Oh definitely.” – “Of course.” The others chorused.  “Can we start the movie now?” Thor asked, “Please? There are
Tony shook his head, collecting the bags, and whilst putting things away, called out. “It’s a bunch of cold stuff, wouldn’t want it to spoil.”
“Yeah, they have the best eggs. Emine, the woman who sells them, sometimes she gives me a half price discount if I’m charming enough, it’s actually rather sweet.”
The girl scouts for example, could have easily been explained away that there weren’t any waivers for the experiments, Tony was cautious, of course, he would never want to hurt a kid. But Tony knew he could get carried away, an innocent fire experiment for him, could be a lawsuit waiting to happen for the girl guides.
“Let’s put your bag away and we can put the fire on?” Steve suggested. “That’s what I was doing when you arrived, which is why it took me so long to get to the door.”
Steve laughed, handing her a 20 before Tony could even realise a transaction was taking place. “Of course not, you know that you’re my favourite person here, Emine.”
bag repetitively, rattling the string that hung it. The coarse jingling sound echoed through the otherwise quiet room, it was almost deafening in the silence. Natasha leant against the doorframe, staring dumbly, she knew Steve’s revelation would rattle him, but she didn’t think it would result in
Bruce was curled on a bench, which was surrounded by small trees, looking at the garden with a soft, serene expression. “That’s, that’s really sweet Tony.”
He rubbed over the phantom pain where his heart surgery had occurred all those years ago, willing the ache of loss to subside. Sometimes he wished there was something permanent there besides the scar, something to explain away his emotions so he wouldn’t have to acknowledge them.
, and Sunset only wanted my tech’s secrets. Rumiko was, well, that’s a story and a half, and every single time, they betrayed me, they hurt me. Well, with Stone it was probably a good thing he left because
Natasha shook her head, returning the smile. “You’re an idiot if you think I didn’t start caring about you the moment I met you.”
Steve came in and slid into his seat in a poor attempt to stagger his entrance in after Tony. He scanned the table in curiosity before landing on Tony’s neck. “Oh.”
Tony smiled at that, he had made them happy, he had engaged with those kids, and now he was what, friends with them, a mentor of sorts?
“I’d hope not,” Steve said. “Because you’ve worked so hard to improve your understanding of your tech, and improve the quality of your work, I wouldn’t want that to be cheapened by the idea that someone just handed that to you. You work hard Tony, it’s amazing.”
Natasha pinched his wrist. Steve winced. “It improves my skill, but that’s beside the point. My question stands and
Steve was the one to see the note on the door first. “Wait, hold on a second,” he ripped it off, scanning the note, his brow furrowing as he read. Wordlessly, he passed the note to Tony, who fumbled with it as he realised he was still holding his tablet.
He hoped he’d made her somewhat happier. Besides, he’d be coming back, once he could find some cash.
Steve’s jaw hurt as he stared, incapable of moving. He was mortified, frozen on the spot. He could feel his face burn ugly and fierce, like a hot stove, could
“But my mum has always cut my hair,” The girl said. “So Peter called me to ask and then Kamala called-”
lives with that. Peter has always been such a strong, enduring, good force, who has been infinitely better and more capable than Tony could ever hope to be. It made Tony fucking proud that he got to not only witness that, but also be part of Peters growth as both a person, and a hero.
FRIDAY was playing with their Superidiot Bet Table whilst they waited on Steve and Tony to show up, a smirk permanently plastered on her face. Natasha drummed her fingers on the table whilst they waited – that smirk could mean anything.
Clint pulled Thor’s fork back with his own. “They’re off somewhere making sure Natasha loses the bet.”
Tony woke with a soft smile, his body cocooned in so much warmth that left Tony feeling nothing but safe. The sun warmed his face, but didn’t shine in his eyes, so he let them stay closed. Tony was content, he was at ease, and utterly…
She shook the thoughts from her mind, running a hand through her hair to tuck the loose strands behind her ears. She was proud of this dish. It brought a soft smile to her face and warmed her soul. Judging by the way Thor was stuffing his face with it, it tasted good too. She rolled her eyes in amusement, she was reminded of safety, of home.  And she felt pretty much at home here.
He scanned the bike, finding the cable adjustment nut. “You got a toolbox in there?” He asked, gesturing to the sadllebags.
“Okay Kamala this is really weird, it should be really simple to connect the eftpos machine to the financial spreadsheet, but it’s not working, and I can’t work it out.” The boy at the computer said – and Tony
Natasha set Steve bandaged right hand on the table with his left, sighed, then raised her head so she could lock eyes with him. “So let me get this straight, you don’t think you’re good enough for him, even though you think that’s for him to decide – no Steve, you just said he’s too great and has created too great of a world for you to fit in, don’t argue with me. You also value your friendship and don’t want to lose that, which is fair, anyone in your position would be. Those are your main concerns.”
Steve buried his head into the crisp sheets, sobbing into Tony's side, his hands clutching Tony’s. The pain and stress that had consumed him these past few weeks was leaching through him in waves, each wave threatening to flood Steve’s mind. He had been drowning without Tony, and now Tony was
Steve’s eyes reminded him of the Waitomo Caves in New Zealand. Blue, and exciting, and so vibrant they could light up the deepest crevices of a cave. His eyes sparkled in front of Tony, which should have been impossible in this weather, but yet they glittered in the overcast sky. Tony was entranced, awestruck. He had never seen the caves in person, but looking at Steve’s eyes, he didn’t think he needed to.
“You just have to stay true to yourself, true to your heart, and you’ll excel.” Steve added, and Tony grinned at him.
Eventually the conversation drifted and Tony and Steve left the room, leaving only Bruce, Thor, Clint and Natasha. Tony had gone down to the workshop to work on something for Pepper, and like clockwork, Steve had followed shortly after. Natasha ran through their interactions in her mind, there wasn’t really any change from last week.
Each of the Avengers had come sat vigil with him at some time or another. At one point Pepper had physically moved Steve from his chair and Thor had taken him home so he would shower, change, and get some sleep.
to know why they had to go to so many nurseries all over the globe. Most probably it had to do with supply and demand, but when Tony got passionate about something, he also boarded over the edge of an eccentric rich man, so Natasha often avoided it. (1)
Tony whooped, excitement tingling down his arms and adrenaline pumping through his heart. He could hear Steve laugh in front of him as they cut through the country side, screaming down the road. Tony breathed in deeply, letting the winds bite his face and pierce his skin. Steve smelt of vanilla, motor oil, and the country air around them. He could feel Steve’s heart hammering in his chest, and was sure his own heart was the same.
That was fine too, it’s not like he’d never seen Rhodey without a shirt on in a non-battle situation. This was completely normal.
, Steve and Tony were curled up on the floor in front of the fire, Steve reading one of the books scattered around the house aloud to Tony, as Tony lazily ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“Tony,” Steve said again. “You help millions of people every day, and only 11 people have this issue. Most people – most companies, would wait until a few thousand people have an issue but you… you’re tackling it immediately. No person is too small for you to help. It’s… it’s amazing.”
“I volunteered to stay behind,” Steve said with a small, almost cautious smile. “I didn’t want you to get here and find yourself alone.”
“You could try kicking the door through? You easily strong enough,” Tony was only half joking, because it would be a
“Go, Steve”, Thor said, and for a moment, Steve was guilty he hadn’t noticed Thor return earlier. “We can wait.”
Steve shot Tony a look. “I’m not about to go destroy your house just because we can’t open a door,” He picked the bag back up off of the floor. “The wood is
Tony arrived in 24 minutes, and he may have done a little dance as he got out of the suit – but there wasn’t anyone around to see it, so it was okay. Tony had always loved this place. It was his parents winter cabin and as a kid, Jarvis – the human one, would drive them up through the dying autumn leafed trees, to set up the house for Christmas.
“They’re known as the ‘mile-per-minute’ vine.” he said to Steve, continuing what Natasha had been saying. He paused for a moment, blushing slightly. “But also – I,” He sighed, gathering his thoughts, “when I was building this bit, I was in charge of it, and well – I was kind of, no, I
Tony had decided to dump the disguise, and cleaned up his appearance. He ditched his beloved hoodie for a t-shirt Peter had gotten him from Wall-Mart (it had a cool design on it, and Peter had gotten it for him, so of course he loved it), and threw on a blazer and trousers. He even shaved, and styled his hair.
As the sun crept into the horizon, Steve felt lost. One the one hand, he was grateful that Tony had this group of people who inherently cared about Tony above all else, but on the other, he didn’t know what
Natasha refused to take no for an answer, and tugged Steve’s arm slightly before walking off. She listened for Steve’s begrudging footsteps before sliding into the side room where the first aid kit was. “Sit.” She ordered when he had entered.
Steve sighed, the anger leaching from his body and replaced with wicked shame. He forcibly unfolded his arms, swallowing in a guise to loosen his jaw. Hesitantly, he walked over to pick up his book, noticing Tony flinch away slightly, as if believing Steve would lash out at him. In all honesty Steve probably had the right, but right now he was too embarrassed to care. “What did you see?” He asked, barely surprised in how timid is voice was.
“Wow Stark,” Natasha said, the tall black iron gates lining the six as they walked in, “you’ve really out done yourself.”
“You’re amazing,” Clint said, with more life in his eyes than Steve had noticed since they arrived. “Thank you for saving him.”
“Oh…” Tony breathed, because he didn’t know what to say, he didn’t have anything to say, but he knew he needed to say something.
Tony worked for a little while longer, before it hit him. “Steve,” Tony said. “How long has it been since the others left?”
Steve smirked, before returning to his book. “Sure Tony, you tell yourself that’s why you’re helping them.”
“Well, you wouldn’t of had to.” Emine replied earnestly. “But, you can pay me back by going to see Greg, he’s been almost as worried as I have.”
Tony waved a hand in the air. “A software update for the Starkphones. About 10 people,” Tony paused, counting them up in his head. “No, 11 people complained the browser took to long to open. Then there was the display issue with the clock, and that thing with the phone not marking notifications for voicemails – which, who even uses voicemails anymore, so we just figured to roll an update out before Christmas.”
. Zemo had been right, up this close, there was some green in the blue of Steve’s eyes. But saying that his eyes were green and blue was like saying the sun was yellow. It was sufficient, but not accurate to capture the starlit fire within them.
When well out of ear shot, Thor turned to the others. “This is the most thoughtful thing I have ever seen.”
. She was nervous because he was blatantly trying to hide his identity, “and pretty much anything else I reckon will help this hangover.” Tony added.
.” Natasha said before Tony could respond, her hand grazing over the leaves. She had recognised them immediately. For a moment she was brutally reminded of her and her cousins pulling them out of the vegetable garden and stacking them by the wall. It was a nice memory.  She covered up the appreciation she had with an ire that she wasn’t feeling. “Which is idiotic, may I remind you Tony. They grow fast, grow everywhere, and are almost indestructible.”
Tony collapsed into the space next to her. “Rhodey is currently off on some super-secret mission with the Air-Force, Pepper has blocked my calls for another two days – don’t ask, and you’re the only other person I could think of whose sane enough to talk about this with; and, quite frankly, I’ve been sitting on this for months now and I think I might just explode.”
Natasha hummed, pouring herself and Bruce more juice from the jug. Clint was speaking just a tad too fast for him to be believably calm. Bruce patted Natasha on the hand in thanks as he took his glass. “Technically it would be third, fourth, fifth, and six wheeling. We’re a bus. There’s no date there.” He said.
Steve pulled them up to a stall that bordered two different stalls that each sold apples, and only apples. The woman who manned the stall was old, but not the kind you would pity with their feeble limbs and degrading mind, but the kind who could still run an army if given half the chance. At her age she should have had one foot six deep under, but if it weren’t for the deep lines in her face, which sagged like her skin was no longer connected to the rest of her body, Tony would think she was 60. If Tony had been wearing his glasses, he supposed FRIDAY would age her at 90. She stood tall, a bright smile gracing her features as she came to the counter. She moved with the grace of a dancer, when her gait should be askew with arthritis and the eyesight to match, but they shone with the wit and intelligence that would come from a headstrong woman who had lived a vibrant life.
Gentrification would have swallowed this place up decades ago, but Tony was a nostalgic thing, and was glad to save this piece for Fifth Avenue.
Tony was frail, the hand Steve held was paper thin. He lay in the hospital bed, the thinning sheets scratching at his skin. Disinfectant hung permanently in the air, making the room stuffy with undertones of bleach and sickness. The limp curtains hung by the window, they looked like they had been washed hundreds of times, and so had lost all the life they once had, and blank white walls seemed to consume Tony, making him look small and lifeless.
known. But she wasn’t going to tell him that. “So, if you’ve known for months now, why is it only now that it’s becoming too much to handle?”
Emine smiled at him, the same warm smile from earlier. “No, you’re not. You know, you’re the first person I’ve ever seen Steve bring to the markets, you must have a special relationship with each other.”
Bruce, busy stuffing four five dollar notes into his pocket said. “You cannot possibly know that it’s next week.”
Clint eyed them carefully. “Abort, this was a terrible plan, they’re even worse now that they’re together.”
Steve’s gaze was glued to tightening the chain, his brow furrowed in concentration and his tongue poking out slightly. Tony felt himself smile, his cheeks rise in delight as he watched Steve at work. It was
And they did. They’d even bought U and Dum-E along too, still wearing his terribly drawn skull and crossbones hat.
It brings forth a number of moments and flashes, each one brighter than the previous, even though Steve knows some of their moments were dark. But looking back at their discography… it’s hard to see anything that dims its brilliance. He and Tony shine as bright as a phoenix.
“No that’s important too,” Tony said. “It’s important to go through life at your own pace, to not let people rush you,
could see the joke coming a mile away. How were these idiots so dense? “I – um, no, you’re right. It’s, it’s not the right thing to do.”  Clint was never winning the bet.
Natasha nodded, including the note, and then opened Clint’s. His name flashed a harsh red, his deadline date – today, glowing an angry yellow. “Clint, betting a week before Valentines Day. You still have time to back out, then you don’t owe us a cent when you lose.”
Tony took a chance glimpse at Steve, who was observing the flamboyant scene with a grin on his face. Tony couldn’t help his own smile stretch onto his face. This was Steve’s place, this was something Steve knew, and apparently, found joy in.
Steve rummaged through one of them, pulling up a cloth holder that was similar to Pepper’s travel makeup case. Tony had never been so meticulous with his tools, often just throwing what he needed into a box and hoping for the best. “What do you need?”
Pepper would take the tray Bruce used as a make-shift desk and do paperwork on it, muttering about how she was ‘covering his ass and doing your work for you, and I’m not going to be making a habit of this so you better get well and wake up already’.
“Look, if you’re smarter than Bruce and Thor think you are, then you’ll work it out pretty soon yourself, but right now we’re watching this so…”
“Ah yeah, all the boys loved those hidden lists with our names hastily scribbled on them in brothels whilst our existence was illegal – but I get your point.” Steve said. He rubbed his neck rather shyly. “So, how do I woo him?”
Tony looked up at the tablet to glance at Steve, who was… looking at Tony with awe? That couldn’t be right. “What’s your point?”
Steve detached himself from the situation, he needed to think. The rescue services were too far away, Bruce was too far away, and Tony was in too perilous a state to move somewhere too rapidly.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Don’t get me wrong, the guy is funny. But straight people can be dumb as all hell.” She said. “Steve, it has meaning, it will have meaning to Tony. You were just going about your day, and you saw something that reminded you of Tony, that you bought
Steve glanced the table, as if trying to work out if anyone else had noticed. When his gaze rested on Natasha, she winked.
Bruce gave Natasha a puzzled look, poking his head towards Steve and Tony. Natasha shrugged and turned back to the TV. She didn’t know what was going on, she only knew what she hoped was developing.
No, no. This was a good idea, she would be thrilled to meet her hero, Steve would love to meet someone who respects him and is down to Earth, and Tony would get his buttermilk. Steve even had some cash on him.
Behind her, Steve sat in one of the wooden chairs in the room. Natasha rolled another one over, setting up the first aid kit on the bench beside them.
They carefully balanced over some mismatched rocks that were clumped together between the waterfall and another stone wall face with dangling vines.
This wasn’t something Tony was supposed to do, something he was ever supposed to consider. Tony had asked once, if he could look inside and Steve had told him clearly that he wasn’t comfortable, that Tony wasn’t welcome to pry.
Natasha hummed, her heart sinking a bit. It would have been nice to spend the day together, celebrate a different kind of love, the first kind of love that had helped Natasha feel whole. “That’s fair, you deserve to spend the day with her.”
“You’re hilarious,” Tony said, but he slid out of his chair nonetheless, because he did not spend 4 hours out of his day getting everything he needed for pancakes to just
“That’s too risky,” Natasha said. “You’d be going too fast and he doesn’t have protection, he wouldn’t stay stable.”
“Tony, this was the first time you’ve been on a motorbike.. right?” Steve asked, leaving out the fairly obvious
“He’s my best friend, Nat!” Steve breathed out. Natasha nodded, taking the pressure wrap from the kit, willing him to continue as she worked. “I mean, obviously I knew I loved him, but I always thought it was like how I love you, or the rest of the team, you know?”
It was unlike anything Tony had ever experienced before. He had never felt more alert, more alive. He was so acutely attuned to the environment around him, it was as though FRIDAY had entered his consciousness. The sights, the sounds, the smells,
“I love you,” Tony said, “for years. I’ve loved you for fucking years and I knew you’d never reciprocate and that was okay because I’ve had your friendship and that’s all I’ve ever needed and I just-”
Somehow, even doing the dishes had been enjoyable by Steve’s side. They bantered, flicked water at each other, bumped each other with their hips which turned into a minor wrestling match, Steve had even slapped some dishwasher detergent into Tony’s hair.
“The funny thing is, I’m not even afraid of what he would be like in a relationship. Ty – Stone, well, he was
With a wicked smirk, Emine turned and snuck round the back of the curtain f her stall, before pulling out a small take out container.
Then Tony felt a shift and before he knew it, Steve woke up. Tony though, ever the coward, kept his eyes closed, breathing deeply and pretending to be asleep. He felt Steve freeze, his body stiffening as he seemed to become aware of the potion they were sleeping in.
“Reagan.” Tony said about the next statue. “Suppressed the AIDs crisis, expanded the War on drugs and locked up hundreds of innocent kids just because they weren’t white, killed a journalist when he exposed it. Thousands of people died because of his homophobic and racist ideology.”
Across the table from her, Clint fidgeted slightly, his finger skimming the rim of his glass. Their eyes met and Natasha smirked. He
The door opened to a Steve Rogers with windswept blonde hair (Tony forced himself not to think about Steve clinging to Thor on the way over,
Tony hummed, turning away from talking to Steve to see what Thor had been looking at. “Oh!” he said, dragging Steve with him as he walked over to Tony. Clint snickered beside Natasha, whilst Bruce took some photo’s on his phone, feigning that they were of plants. “That’s an
“That’s a terrible disguise,” Steve giggled when Tony arrived back in the kitchen, their ingredients haphazardly strewn on the kitchen bench.
Which brought Tony crashing back to reality. There was no way Tony could be with Steve, and Tony just had to accept it.
“I’m not worried about losing him suddenly or dramatically, I’m not worried about confessing my feelings and him turning away in revulsion, he’s better than that, it’s part of the reason why I love him. I’m worried – no, I’m
It was like Steve was an extension of Tony’s mind, and he was an extension of Steve’s. They moved with each other, rather than against, like they were in sync with the others currents, like they kites moving in the others wind, like they were in battle.
Bruce snorted, juice coming out of his nose. In a rush he was clutching it, moaning whilst Clint cackled beside him, his spoon clattering to the floor. Natasha put a hand to her mouth, chuckling and trying not to snort in the process. Beside her, Thor howled, shaking the table as he lay on it, laughing mercilessly.
Steve couldn’t breathe, Tony was here, he was alive, he was safe, and he was looking at Steve like he didn’t want to look at anything else.
Happy was probably the only other person who didn't talk when he came in. He would sit in Steve’s chair and watching wrestling matches on the television. Steve wasn’t entirely sure what
Even from the bike the market seemed busy. Packs of cars lined the carpark and people seemed to mill in between them like they were suburb streets, parents chatting as children played, couples eating as they wandered back to their car. It was less like a carpark, and more like a communal gathering point, that just so happened to have cars.
“Tony,” Steve said again. “11 people complained and you decided to change your entire work schedule to fix their issue.”
Dum-E turned his claw head petulantly towards Tony, stopping so suddenly anyone else might have thought Dum-E had broken. All was silent as Tony held his breath. Three. Two.
A man who looked at Tony like he was the only thing worth looking at, who smiled like all was right in the world when Tony showed the slightest indication that he was happy.
his mind supplied. Making him feel safer in water because humanities amphibian ancestors used water to stay safe. It was soothing.
. Steve’s hair hung over his face, his sweat gluing it to his skin. He was panting, his chest heaving as breathed haggard, ignored breaths. The wrappings around his hands had fallen to the ground, bloody and in tatters; no doubt Steve was in there stripping the flesh from his knuckles with each hit, using the rough skin of the punching bag as a violent sandpaper.
, how could a human be so oblivious. The other half wanted to wrap a blanket around him and kiss his forehead. She decided on a middle ground. “Put that into something tangible. The best kind of gifts, the best kind of
he’s the type of guy who would take a photo of a bee in some flowers whilst on a jog because he knows that you would like that.”
. The light from the bathroom shone, giving him an ethereal glow that transported Tony. Water clung to his chest and dripped down his arms and Tony was lost as Steve shone in front of him. Time froze as Steve came out, ducking his head as he went to his bag.
Steve glanced down at Tony, grinning wider when he caught Tony looking. “Come on,” he said, and before Tony could respond, Steve had taken Tony’s hand in his.
Steve tapped the cap on his head on their walk back to the mansion. “You were amazing with those kids, Tony.”
Tony stared at the bike as it spluttered pathetically on the side of the road. He had to admit, when he woke up deciding he was going to have pancakes, he didn't see his morning turning out quite like this.
And Tony was crying too, and so lifted a shaking hand and running it through Steve’s hair. There was a rawness to Tony's tears, like he too, had been containing something awful he had to let out.
. Like something they should have always been doing, like them making pancakes, doing something simple and domestic, something that required teamwork for the sake of teamwork and food, should always have been part of their existence.
“Can I make a side bet that Tony will make the first move?” Thor asked. “Just for $10, like Bruce.” Natasha hummed, looking towards Bruce and Clint. “I’m okay with it if you two are.”
“Ah no,” Steve said, taking Tony’s bag from the armour. “Apparently Thor saw some sort of animal on the drive up, and the others wanted to check it out.”
As Tony stepped out of the shower, all that stress came rushing back. He’d left his bag in the bedroom.
Peter, who Tony noticed was furiously blushing, spun away so he could face the computer. “Yeah, there’s been no improvement, we might have to wait a bit for the eftpos machine to reconnect, once Riri gets it back together, that is.”
“And you must be Peter then?” Steve asked, and Peter ran a hand through his hair, his face flushed. It made sense to Tony, this was
“I know.” Tony replied, and he sounded so broken, so lost, as if he too believed this was the end. “I just – when it fell it opened on a random page and it was just so beautiful that I- I couldn’t stop.”
“Not really, you still fell for a friend, and you still had to work through that. My point is, don’t sell Steve short,
Her face pulled into a frown. “Oh sir, um, we’re only taking cash right now. The eftpos machine is down – my friend’s coming over a bit later to fix it, but um, until then, it’s cash,” she looked rather sheepish, “there’s a sign on the door.”
Thor turned to Steve as they walked down, the path, stopping sporadically to marvel at the president – or the statue. “Who was president whilst you fought in your great war?”
“I – I can’t have that. The only thing worse than loving him in silence, is losing him in silence. And I would, I know I would, and I don’t think I could bare it.”
“I really want to make pancakes but we’re out of pretty much everything we need to make them, but I don’t have cash and FRIDAY said you carried some on you…”
Which was why it was the absolute worst time for a spontaneous phone call. “Jarvis?” Tony asked over the ring tone. “Who the hell is calling me at…” Tony checked his watch, huh, it was midday. “Never mind, just… who’s calling?”
Steve chuckled, slipping his phone into his pocket. Tony envied him, Steve was so clearly comfortable, it made Tony squirm. “Yeah, well, this guy I know made this newfangled device easier to use, probably because he’s getting older himself.”
Tony sat dumbfounded, watching Steve work. He had long taken his jacket off and had rolled up his sleeves, exposing his taut, strong arms. He crouched beside the wheel, his jeans tight around his calves, leaving very little to the imagination. Tony couldn’t look away.
“Yeah,” Tony said, his voice small, “it spreads everywhere too, all over the country. The grey ones are introduced, but the purple ones are native. They often mix together though like a flowers version of a circus.”
Tony was, quite frankly, incredibly proud of Steve. Over time, Steve had taken to the whole the-future-is-now-my-present thing in his stride, and had branched out his knowledge of the world through food and cooking.
Your mind is probably one of the most brilliant things in this world, but all you’re doing is making up absurd situations and scenario’s and it’s driving you mad. If you keep making assumptions about Steve and
“Eggs,” Tony said, marvelling at how steadfast this woman was. If he aged half as gracefully as she has, he’d be damn grateful. “I’m making pancakes.”
“Dum-E, no,” Tony said flailing as he pushed himself into the wall – one of the wheels was stuck, he’d have to look into that, “you have three seconds to stop fighting the blender. I don’t need more oil and a screwdriver pretending to be an actual, edible smoothie.”
They neared a water fall (“which is still off track, Tony, we’re never going to reach the statues, just look at the map!”) which housed a variety of different ferns. Thor crouched down and stroked through a smaller one which was deep in the water. “There’s no sign here Tony, what is this plant?”
Tony shook his head, sliding into one of the counter chairs. “I went out to get some – but the corner store is only taking cash, of which I have zilch.”
“You told me we had to watch Lord of the Rings first,” Steve said. “I want to understand why you made ‘Legolas’ Clint’s callsign.”
Steve froze in the doorway, eyeing Tony carefully. He was hunched over one of the tables in his workshop, pressing a battered workbook close to his chest with trembling hands. Steve eyed it warily, realisation settling in his gut.
“Totally, this is exactly the kind of thing every one should wear to the markets, Wall-Mart t-shirts are great. I’m starting a trend.”
“Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are giving us life advice, I never thought this would happen in my life ever.”
“By all accounts it should do Boss,” Friday said. “However if you are planning on going out, wouldn’t it be more convenient to just buy some pancakes?”
He ran his hand along his chest, trailing the various scarring from all the different events that had gone through in the last ten or so years. The sharp nicks from the shrapnel, the raised angry network of veins from the palladium poisoning, and the jagged curve of Steve’s shield.
Tony sighed, peeling off his hood, taking off his glasses, and shoving his cap on Steve’s head for good measure. “Technically, I only knew Kamala would be here.”
“Oh!” Peter said. “I came in here at one point last year after I left the mansion, and Kamala and I pretty much geeked out for two hours.”
The girls however, had all been much too intimidated to even talk to him. As they had wandered the mansion, delighting in the other Avengers, they hadn’t come near him. Tony tried not to be surprised by that, he’d thought that maybe he had changed his image somewhat, in recent years, but obviously not.
He hadn’t thought there was anything better than flying in the armour, the freedom of being in the skies, the ability to go anywhere, as fast as he wanted, but this, this rivalled it. There was a visceral difference between driving a car, comfortable inside it, and being propelled upon a motorbike, holding on while it goes about its own existence, carrying you forward.
Steve gave him a look that suddenly weighted the room, added weight to the words Tony had just spoken, suddenly, it didn’t seem like there were talking about movies anymore. “We will?”
“Every single one of us love Steve. We don’t all agree with every single one of his actions – again, that awful accords mess comes to mind, but he’s family, to us. I always make some my mother’s baklava for him, Greg always sets aside some cheese, Meryl always has some spare honey, Grace sets aside a new juice blend she thinks Steve will like, and Joan always makes him a hot chocolate when she sees him.
A collective wave of relief rose through them, Steve immediately brightened. Good, Tony would be alright.
Tony smiled softly, he knew FRIDAY added that fact just to soften the blow. “Good, good. Education is important.”
Steve shrugged, knocking his hand a bit. Natasha steadied it, but otherwise ignored it. “You noticed it at breakfast.” He said.
How his eyes sparkled, up for an adventure, ready to straddle the motorbike and never let go. How he acted, the loyalty he invoked in the people around him, how Tony wanted to stand by Steve’s side always. How Steve’s very soul seemed to excite Tony, and how Tony had forgotten to wear his mask around Steve, had forgotten they existed at all.
Tony didn’t bother drying himself, there wasn’t any point when he’d just have to dry himself again before putting on clothes. Instead, he wrapped the towel around his waist and stepped out.
The farmers markets were unlike anything Tony had experienced before. The overcast sky did nothing to deter people from trekking out here, with throngs of people lining the pathways and gathered around stalls. Tony could see lovers wandering hand in hand, casually browsing, whilst others gossiped in huddles, clutching coffees around worn fingers.
to heal; and don’t let it heal whilst you’ve still got dirt and grime trapped under all this shredded skin. That’s just idiotic.”
“I’ll be there in about…” Tony checked his watch, jogging towards the elevator to go to his floor. “20 minutes –
Tony ignored his worries, scrubbing it away with the dirt and grime his body had accumulated in the hours he’d been here. He focused on the water massaging his scalp and body as he rinsed off, letting it soothe his stressed mind.
Kamala shrugged like it was nothing, taking three bags out and packing them with ease. “Alright, so with tax, your total’s $19.90.”
at him, like he’d never been allowed before. The plane of Steve’s nose, the light dust of freckles across his face the serum didn’t remove – he’d never noticed that before. The nights worth of blonde stubble that framed his jaw. In Steve he saw fear, but also an intense beauty Tony had never let himself recognise before. Steve’s eyes were a rich, deep blue that captured Tony’s soul, with the glittering of green that just made them safe and warm. His hair, mussed with sleep and sticking up in all directions was like a canvas in which Tony could just run his fingers through.
Steve put the spoon he was using into the bowl of cereal Tony had made him – because of course Tony had made it for him, he always did. “When would you like to go?” He asked. Natasha drummed her nails on the table, these two were still too wholly oblivious, and she was running out of time.
Tony blinked, absorbing what Steve had said. He took a moment to process it, to recognise the change of tone, how sincere Steve had been. Steve had complimented him, not necessarily on his intelligence, but on how he utilises his intelligence and improves on it, which was –
“Depends,” Tony said, not looking up from Steve, who was still reading softly in his ear. “Who bet Steve would say it first but I’d make the first move.”
Steve’s face morphed into something akin to a deer caught in headlights. “I… Because I, I took advantage of you, I-I, I told you that I…”
“He’s so special. He’s so good, and kind, loyal, and too generous for his own good. He – he runs a company, his own business, he mentors kids and he’s leading the fight for green energy! He’s throws himself into everything he does, he’s incredible!
Tony shrugged. “Nah, not really. You’ve been putting up with Clint as long as I have,” – Steve snorted. “We all need a bit of a break.”
Natasha closed her book and shimmied down the sofa, patting the seat beside her. “Not that I don’t appreciate this level of trust, but, why are you telling me?”
“You almost died-” Steve choked, and his heart shattered into two. Every emotion he had absorbed, every thought he had, had burst. Steve cried, exhaustion collapsing him. Tony had almost
want. He valued his employees and cared about them. They were everything to Tony, without them, the company wouldn’t function, and it certainly wouldn’t be nearly as successful without their dedication. Hell, Tony would take a bullet for one of them if he had to.
Clint gave Tony a puzzled look that was going soft around the edges. Natasha almost grinned for him. “
Tony’s heart melted, this girl was so kind. “Whatever’s easiest for you, honestly. I don’t have that far of a walk.”
Bruce shrugged. “Trying is the key word. It’s a virus that attacks the immune system and the bloods antibodies, so it’s a bit impossible to do so, since the white antibodies are what’s needed to fight the disease.”
Natasha crouched beside Steve, taking the hand that Steve hadn’t taken. Her voice was uncharacteristically strained as she took in the armour. “I swear to god Stark, if you’re thinking of dying now-”
“There’s a spare key in the water dish for the third plant to the right of the door,” Tony hurried, trying to erase the mental image Clint had oh-so-helpfully planted into Tony’s brain. “Use that to get in.”
“Yeah, actually Peter, why are you here?” Tony asked, genuinely curious, because not that he didn’t love the kid – he did, but he hadn’t been expecting to see Peter late on a Sunday morning in a corner store down Fifth Avenue.
Steve thought for a moment. “I hang out in the workshop a lot, I sketch,” he added with a blush, “– him, mostly, when I think about it. He forgets to eat so I make him food. We play chess, or he takes me to different art collections even though he hates it. Honestly – I just love being with him.”
. He’d heard from Pepper that one of the employees – Margaret, had her daughter’s girl scout group coming to the mansion to sell cookies for some fundraiser or another. Tony prepared the workshop, gathering a variety of chemicals to create different coloured flames to entertain them, the cookies were just a bonus.
“Huh,” Kamala said, before smiling. “Well, thanks then! You could just leave it to the side, it’d be faster for you when you get back.”
, that Tony’s colour was gone. Steve had taken Tony’s colour, consumed it like it was his own, because Tony had been so open, and been so willing to give it to him, and Steve had been greedy, taken everything he could get.
“I’ve got your drugs!” Kamala cried as she emerged from the back of the store. “Well – the Advil, not illegal stuff, we don’t do that, I don’t either. Don’t do illegal stuff.”
Emine cocked her head to the side, her eyes roving over Tony as though she was assessing him. “I must say Mr. Stark, I did not take you as a man who would come to the farmers markets.”
Tony nodded slowly, swallowing down some nerves. Natasha watched in almost fascination as he composed himself. He rubbed his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt from his free arm. “That’s, that’s all well and good Nat, but it doesn’t matter.”
Tony almost groaned, but contained it, it wasn’t her fault that the machine wasn’t working. Tony almost offered to fix it then and there, but knew it probably wouldn’t go down well if a customer tried to fix an eftpos machine out of the blue.
On the table in front of them, a blue hologram emerged, showing a table listing each of their names, their price, and their terms.
Tony heart in his ribcage. Tony would be completely exposed, there would be nothing separating the pair except the leather jacket that Steve was slipping into.
Swallowing down his emotions, Tony turned to the armour and put it on sentry duty outside the house (huh, almost like a metal snowman) to hide his growing blush. “Thank you,” Tony said. “You didn’t need to do that.”
“It would be so easy!” Thor said, “the two of you are some of the smartest men I have ever known! If anyone could do it, it would be you! Surely there is some dinosaur DNA somewhere that-”
Clint shrugged, shuffling so the top half of his body was hanging upside down from the ledge reaching his hand out to shuffle the un-popped kernels along. “I’m trying out nicknames.”
Peters eyes went wide, nodding along. “Fr-from the workshop, I meant. I wanted to see why Spiderman would try it.”
Natasha hummed. “I’m not sure, you’re friends – good friends, and that’s a solid foundation for a successful relationship, but I can’t differentiate between what you’re doing now and what you need to do differently. That’s what you need to do – you need Tony to realise that he’s special to you, more so than the rest of us.”
“In the workshop,” Tony continued, obviously thinking Steve’s nod translated into a prompting, “asleep at my work bench, with the holograms, talking to JARVIS, spinning in my chair when I get a good idea, dancing along to whatever music you let me blast through my speakers, on the sofa with DUM-E trying to tuck me in,” Tony’s voice grew smaller, “my smile, my eyes, my hands.”
U, ever the better behaved of the two, rolled over with the marker in hand. Tony took it, patting U’s frame. “Ah, that’s a good boy, thanks.”
He had pretended that he wasn’t disappointed, and Natasha had bought him a couple of boxes of cinnamon cookies – how she remembered those were his favourite, he didn’t want to ask, but, it wasn’t what he’d been excited about in the first place.
of work to do. It was a couple of days until Christmas, which meant the latest StarkPhone software update needed to roll out within the next couple of hours. That is, if they wanted ample time to give out holiday bonuses and give everyone actual, decent breaks.
And as much as he had cared about Steve, Tony had known that his life wouldn’t include the other man again.
Natasha dabbed the antiseptic a little harder to shut him up. “If you don’t clean this out and aid the healing, then your body will mess up the healing process. Think of skin growing in the wrong place, blood clotting and forming a longer lasting bruise, that sort of thing. Sure, it
They were at the table for their Family Valentine’s Dinner. Clint said the only reason he had shown up was so he could subtly mock Natasha when she lost the bet. She rolled her eyes and purposely hadn’t pointed out how he had stacked a collection of physical DVD’s from home for them to watch after – all with Taylor Swift in them, obviously, even though FRIDAY had them all on file already.
that was awful, but that’s the thing. I can’t, for a moment, ever imagine Steve doing something like that. I trust him explicitly. I know he wouldn’t hurt me, wouldn’t do anything to hurt me, and I, I love him for that.”
Emine tsked. “Steve has come here every Saturday since 2012 – barring that awful business with the accords, and he had never brought another person with him. He’s spoken about friends, James, Sam – apparently I remind him of Natasha,” Tony snorted, yeah, he could picture that. “But never,” she continued, “has he brought them down. It’s like we’re his own personal separate world,
Tony rubbed the back of his neck, gesturing to the door. “Besides,” he said. “There’s this girl there who I think you’d like to meet.”
“Hey FRI,” he asked, lying back into his previous position. “Is there anywhere that delivers pancakes?”
Natasha hummed sceptically, rubbing her hands on the barre as she finished he final stretches. “So you pounce on everyone?”
you’re funny, and kind, and charming, and when you’re deep in your work you run your fingers in your hair and leave grease marks on your forehead which is fucking adorable – why wouldn’t I want to draw you?”
They arrived at his statue. It was decent, but hardly anything remarkable. But – Natasha supposed, she felt that way about all the bronze statues. She didn’t really see anything to admire about in any of the presidents.
“Half the founding fathers wanted the president to be president until they died, Hamilton ranted about it for six hours at one point.” Natasha explained, choosing to omit the fact that she only knew this information because of Broadway, “Madison wanted it too. The proposal lost by 6 votes though. After Washington left to sit under his ‘own vine and fig tree’ after two terms, it became tradition to do the same. FDR didn’t though, he stuck around and was elected for four terms.”
Tuesday was nerve wracking. Natasha hadn’t heard anything from Tony – he had locked himself in the workshop, and Steve was everywhere and nowhere. She had taken herself to the dance studio to calm her nerves. It was less about winning the bet now and more about the fact that Tony and Steve could be barrelling towards a catastrophically disastrous blow up that she would have to solve.
Steve almost forgot his embarrassment as anger flared inside him again, for a completely different reason. “Good enough?” Steve said, scandalised, “Tony you’re more than good enough,
incredibly crowded today. The reopening of the botanic gardens had attracted people from all over the city. It was even more popular due to Tony’s elaborate, and accidentally highly covered involvement.
“Ms. Romanov?” Tony spluttered. “Why are you letting Natasha of all people call me? You know she only does so to yell at me.”
His head was spinning; he simply couldn’t understand. Tony knew Steve’s sketchbook was private, that he didn’t want anyone seeing the contents inside. It was like Steve’s diary, an intimate collection of all his innermost thoughts and feelings. And he had left it here, in Tony’s workshop – Tony’s
Steve winced slightly, but it was barely perceptible unless you could recognise it, which Tony could.
Steve lifted Tony off of his seat and pulled him in a blinding kiss. Tony was frozen for a moment, limp in Steve’s arms, before responding with the same fervour, latching himself against Steve like he was about to turn to dust. It was messy and hardly romantic, with Steve’s nose pushed awkwardly against Tony’s, their teeth clashing against each other as they tried to gain some headway, and their faces at an uncomfortable angle. Tony pulled away suddenly, shifting the angle before diving in – and yes, that was right. The world fell away as Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, clinging to his back as Tony wound his fingers into Steve’s hair. Someone moaned but for the life of him Steve couldn’t tell who, nor did he really care. For all the times Steve had spent with Tony, talking with him, laughing with him, Steve hadn’t thought there was anything more to learn about Tony’s lips, but as they pressed against his, soft, and warm, and safe in a way words never could be, Steve found himself addicted.
Clint was rubbing a hand over his mouth, nodding slightly in awe. His eyes hadn’t left the archways roof. “I don’t-. When I was a kid, we had this pot by the front door, overflowing with these flowers. It was the one, nice thing about that place.” Natasha blink at him, she hadn’t ever thought Clint would open up about his childhood like this. She gave his shoulder an encouraging squeeze. “When me and my broth- Barney. When Barney and I left and travelled, I’d see them around the place, and I’d feel less alone.” He shook his head, his eyes slightly glassy. Natasha knew the parts of the story Clint hadn’t said, the abusive, awful parts that he omitted from his own memory. To speak out like this – he had to have been moved. “How did he know,” he whispered, “how on earth did that stubborn genius know?”
Tony lit up whenever he was surrounded by anything to do with florals. Be it actual flowers, clothing, the myriad of artworks Steve did (although, he probably loved those because Steve made them too), or the design of the take away coffee cup from that cart he and Natasha went to the other day.
“You’re getting a bit too sure of yourself though Natasha,” Thor said, “maybe we should review the terms of the bet.”
Kamala squinted at Steve for a moment, and Tony enjoyed how her face morphed from indifference, to confusion, to realisation in the span of two seconds. “You’re Captain America.” She breathed.
Tony found Steve in the kitchen, his head buried inside the fridge. “Sorry,” Tony said in lieu of a hello, “We don’t have eggs.”
Clint looked pointedly towards her hand, her nails clicking aggressively on the table, then back at her. “Right.”
So, honestly, Siberia seemed so trivial now, that it didn’t really matter. Tony had moved on, and it was no longer a place in his life that held any sort of weight to him.
“Right,” Tony said, grabbing his wallet and sunglasses by his bedside table. “Let’s make some pancakes.”
be one of those. He knows where we stand with one another, I know where we stand with one another, and I won’t take advantage of that – or him.”
Tony almost smacked his forehead with his hand. The winter cabin! He’d almost forgotten. “Is that right now?”
“Emine I’m at least 10 years older than you, if you’re old then I should be dancing with the dinosaurs.”
Tony was no longer concerned about the shower, and it seemed their new predicament seemed to dawn on them at the same time.
Natasha snorted. “Of course he did.” Natasha walked over to her bag, rolling her shoulders. “Do you know where Steve is?”
They had never allowed themselves to grow comfortable around each other, not to an extent that actually mattered. They got to know each other on a surface level, and never gave each other the opportunity to understand each other, make mistakes and amend them, and give them another go.
“So… apparently we’re trapped here,” Steve said, swallowing before smiling softly “wanna play cards?”
Even if everything surrounding him was blanketed in a thick layer of snow that went up to Tony’s heel.
Slowly, Tony cracked an eye open. “Steve,” he breathed, and it was like everything in Steve’s universe righted itself in that very instant. Steve looked into Tony’s eyes and it was like he was drowning. They were bright, they sparkled, they were colourful, they were
Making pancakes was all Tony could think of. He saddled up next to Steve mentally mixed and matched ingredients like he did when building, adding just the right baking powder to help the dough rise, and a third of a cup of buttermilk instead of normal milk to help kick start the baking powder and make the pancakes more tender and fluffy.
to ask for money a day in his life – which probably said a lot about him that Tony didn’t want to acknowledge at this hour in the morning. “You’re asking me… for money?” Steve said.
Tony shrugged. “Just watch,” he said, before dramatically parting them to the side, revealing a cave.
“That was a dick move,” Steve agreed, but he said it with no malice, “and a huge violation of my privacy.”
It wasn’t a far walk to Steve’s room – their rooms were right next to each other after all, and Steve let them in with ease. Tony had almost forgotten that he’d given Steve the nicest room. This had been his room as a kid (he tried not to think too hard about that) so Tony knew that in the morning, the sun would shine through the window in
“Yeah, I bought us here because there’s a quiet short cut through here,” Tony said, standing up and stepping towards the back of the waterfall, “so we can avoid the crowd.”
Natasha nodded towards the next bust. “Nixon. Watergate. Google it, it was devastating news at the time. Now… not so much. He also started the War on Drugs and was president during the moon landing.”
“If you’re not used to sitting for too long, your legs can get a bit wobbly, I should have warned you,” Steve said, his voice soft. He was
Natasha placed her slice of toast onto her plate. “Tony,” she asked, “how long would it take you to repair a phone screen?” She asked.
Natasha rolled her eyes but otherwise didn’t comment, the nickname was harmless and Clint wouldn’t use it to embarrass her, he wasn’t like that. “FRIDAY, is Tony free on Tuesday?”
"You had him wrapped around your chubby little finger…" Tony told him with a light laugh which did nothing to hide the pain behind the old man's voice.
"Ring, Daddy! Ring!" Peter jumped up and down. Tony nodded and pressed the doorbell. He waited patiently as a jittery Peter vibrated beside him. He wrapped his arm around his son and pressed the doorbell again. Tony could feel Peter's shoulder hunch under his arm as nobody opened the door.
Tony was almost out of the door but he suddenly stopped. He gripped the door knob thinking to himself for a moment. He turned back to face Obie, who to his pleasure was looking a bit pale. He smiled at the man sweetly. "And I don't know if you have seen the exact substance of my old man's will but Stark Industries belongs to me. Entirely. I decide everything from the brand of toiletries to who pulls the big guns here."
"This place is safe for children, right?" Tony asked wrapping an arm around Peter, as if it would keep him safe from all harm.
. He stretched his back out and turned to the side of his car where a tiny head had popped up. He fought back a smirk after seeing his six-year-old grin at their new home as if he had just reached Treasure Island.
Peter smiled and both of them slowly fell into a comfortable veil of silence. It was when they reached the end of the album that Peter's breath hitched. The last picture. They had taken it on a picnic to the park. The three of them shining with happiness. It was a really adorable picture where his Papa had his arms wrapped around a younger Tony and a ten year old Peter. It was the final picture they had taken as the whole family.
"Steve!" Tony shouted, feeling awkward as his voice reverberated through the empty hall. He waited for a few moments and was almost ready to turn around when he heard a loud crash from above the stairs. Tony had expected many things to happen but what he hadn't expected was to see tumble down the floor.
Tony grimaced, slowly turning over to Sunset. The beautiful brunette bit her crimson stained lips and winked at him. Fighting off the urge to roll his eyes, Tony asked, "So... a PR stunt?"
Slowly, Tony opened the door and let himself inside. He bit his lip on seeing Steve sitting on the edge of his bed, his glasses askew. His newly shaved and smooth skin, blotchy and red from crying.
"Then, you would be happy to let me spend time with Peter again, right?" Steve asked his voice sarcastic but Tony could see the plain fear he was trying to hide behind the clear blue eyes.
Steve nodded, "Not a lot of people are brave enough to accept their mistakes and be willing to change it. It's admirable, Tony."
Tony almost choked on a laugh as Sunset  walked herself out of the room. He quickly decided not to judge the younger woman, Not when he had led an extremely similar lifestyle when he was her age. Shaking his head, Tony turned around to face Obadiah. He wasn't exactly surprised to see that his godfather was seething.
"You, me and Peter are a unit. You hear?" He chided Steve in a mock stern voice. He smiled when Steve's arms which were wound around his waist became tighter.
Tony smiled at his son warmly hoping to god that the neighborhood kids were not bullies. It would be very easy for Peter to get bullied considering he was small for his age and had no idea how to play around with others. He had grown up in a penthouse, he played outside only once or twice a month when his cousins came home.
"I saw him with Bucky," Sarah told him with a kind smile. He beamed at her gratefully and skipped out to the garden. Sure enough Peter was there with Bucky. The brunet was tossing Peter into the air, making the boy dissolve into shrieks of laughter.
Steve rubbed at his temple tiredly and stared at the stack of papers to be marked. In hindsight, taking on four classes might have been biting off more than he could chew off. But he had nothing else to do. If he wasn't doing work, he was either lounging on his couch or cleaning his house. He would much rather read through his student's papers.
"He isn't like a… criminal or anything, right?" Because that would mean Tony would be moving out. He was going to move right out, it didn't matter if he would have to drive back to Manhattan with his lousy back. He had moved to this vanilla suburb with sweater-wearing dads so his son could have a safe childhood. If his neighbour was a criminal it would break the whole deal.
Peter's heart clenched on seeing the very first picture. It was a picture from the day that he had been taken home from the boy's home. He still remembered how scared he was of seeing Steve and Tony. It didn't help that one of them was
Tony had no idea what he could do. Especially when Steve was glaring tiredly at the floor as if he was trying to avoid the fact that Tony was crouched down beside him. Thankfully, Bucky and Natasha dropped in pretty quickly. Both of their eyes went wide in shock seeing Tony sitting on the end of the stairs, while Steve curled up on himself near a pool of his own vomit.
Tony felt the faint annoyance he had been feeling all week, poke it's head up once again. Obie had been pushing him all week, trying to get him to push out something new for Stark Industries. Tony glanced up to look at the older man, he shrugged in surprise on seeing that he was accompanied by a stranger.
Steve rolled his eyes as he pushed his best friend off the table. He could remember it clearly even now. It was one of the few situations when he saw Mama Barnes panicking. She was torn between making sure her daughter was okay after eating the cheap acrylic paint and consoling an eight-year-old Steve who had burst into tears.
Steve chuckled and wiped Peter's tears away with the sleeve of his sweater. He ruffled the boy's hair and asked, "Do you like to read Peter Benjamin Stark?"
Peter turned around the same time that Johnny threw the remote into his lap. Mrs. Storm was glaring at them angrily. She looked almost as angry as his daddy had looked the time he had found out that his babysitter had pinched him.
Johnny just gave him a wide grin and dragged him out of the house. The older blond shouted, waving to a group of boys, "Tommy! Billy! Harley!"
Tony rose up from his chair, feeling years of resentment swell inside his chest. He wanted to speak now for every time Obadiah had bad mouthed his son, every time he had bad mouthed his lover, every time he had made him feel as if he wouldn't be nothing without his brain. He was slowly starting to realize he had been an idiot to let it all  go thinking that the other man really cared about him and Peter deep inside.
Steve swallowed dryly. "I'm gonna go home and finish all this." He gestured around the pile of paper on his desk. He quickly jammed most of it into his bag and fled his office.
"I'm delighted to hear that! Peter deserves for people to know how wonderful he is," Pepper replied earnestly, her eyes sparkling with fondness.
The woman flashed a grin at him, showcasing all of her pearly whites and dropped down to the chair next to him gracefully. She extended her hand, "Sunset Bain. I'm sure you must have heard of Baintronics."
Tony cleared his throat loudly attempting to catch either one of their attention. Obie continued pacing around the room as if hadn't heard him but Pepper was more polite, she stopped reading the files and gave him a small smile.
"Hi!" Steve said in surprise on finding Peter leaning against his door. The boy gave him a frown and walked over, climbing onto the couch. He watched with an amused smile as the boy scooched over to him.
Steve winced as his eyes watered, adjusting to the unfamiliar material. It had been years since he had worn contacts instead of his glasses, so it wasn't a big surprise that his eyes were disturbed.
Bucky dropped down on his table clumsily and let out a scoff, "Remember when Becs ate your painting?"
Tony held onto Steve's arm as the blond gave him a desperate look before dissolving into a sob. The younger man shook his head, "Get them out! Get them out. They're gonna get crushed! I'm  begging you…"
Tony felt his heart skip as his eyes tripped over the piano they had installed in the living room. It had been his mother's moving gift for them. He hadn't played the piano since he was a teenager. Tony had quit playing after he had leaped into the world of science. He had never been brave enough to play a piano since then. The brunet let out a sigh and ran his finger along the keys. Taking a sharp inhale, he pressed on the keys just as Jarvis had taught him all those years ago.
Steve felt bile surge up his throat, the lighthearted feeling quickly leaving him as he recognized the book. He let out a small croak as his eyes travelled through it's hand painted leaves.
"Oh. I just thought, maybe you wanted to look at these pictures…" He muttered pointing his thumb to the battered album lying open on the desk.
Steve returned it quickly and went inside, locking the door tightly. He leant back and chewed on his lips as he glanced at the room next to him. He lingered for a few moments before deciding to go in.
Tony rolled his eyes as Obie paced around the office like a maniac. He glanced away from the man and looked at his assistant, Pepper. She was somehow ignoring the older man and poring over the flies spread out on the table.
"I know. Still don't understand why people find it hard to believe that you were the stern parent." Peter said, trying to clear his throat.
Probably no one care but I was listening to the; The Fault in our Stars album in Spotify when writing. If you wanna... It's sparkly y'all ✨
. That boy loves you too much, I can't do anything about Peter spending time with you. Not until somebody invents a Peter repellent."
"Where are your friends?" Steve asked, wrapping an arm around the little boy's shoulder. He blinked in surprise on seeing Peter scrunching his face in disgust. "Johnny and Harry are playing baseball again."
Bucky laughed, "Of course, you won't! What I mean is, you even put in the effort to trim your depression beard for this man."
Tony waited for an answer patiently as Steve shuffled around trying to get comfortable. He held back a smile as the blonde rested his wet cheek against his neck, burying his face into his shoulder. He almost thought that Steve had dozed off until Steve leaned into his ear and whispered, "Okay…"
The younger brunet opened his mouth to decline politely but when he glanced into his father's eyes. He faltered. There was a softness and hope to Tony's wrinkled face that he hadn't seen in a long time. Somehow Peter felt that if he declined the offer he would regret it later.
"Can you pull on this sweater?" She asked Steve kindly. Steve nodded, clumsily getting up. Tony slowly moved over to offer him the clothing.
"Did your parents not warn you about going into others' houses without permission?" He asked him in a measured voice.
"Try me." Tony quipped back, he smiled on seeing the wave of annoyance that passed through the older man's face. Obadiah cleared his throat and continued as if Tony hadn't said anything. "Sunset over here is looking for a fine gentleman to play a few games with the tabloids."
"Hello?" He squeaked out, knocking his small fists against the door. Nobody answered his call just like the first time he had visited the place with his father.
Tony followed him inside quickly, giving Steve an easy smile before igniting the engine. Steve gave the genius shaky smiles, quick nods and hums when he chattered away happily.
Tony let out a humorless laugh not saying anything. Peter glanced up when the silence got too heavy. He squeezed Tony's hand on staring at the photo with a pained expression in his rheumy brown eyes.
Peter grinned at that, he had seen heroes. He had seen Captain America, Iron-Man, Spider-Man, and even Black Widow when he had gone to Disneyland last summer. They were all really nice too, Iron Man had even offered him candy.
He pulled the drawer hard but it wouldn't budge. Cursing under his breath, he tried again to see that there was a paper stuck inside. Tony almost tore the paper into half as he took it out. He let out a breath feeling his chest fill with warmth on seeing the content inside the crumpled piece of paper. Steve had drawn Peter and him and quite beautifully at that. Tony ran his fingers through the drawing, feeling a surge of affection towards the blond. He quickly pocketed the drawing and went out of the room after grabbing a soft woollen.
Tony flinched, feeling hurt swell in his chest. He let out a hollow laugh, "Humour me here but why would I leave?"
He glanced away from his phone to see that Peter was already sitting next to him, carefully placing the unfinished drawing of Spider-Man on the table.
Peter had almost started crying in fear but Steve had quickly reached out to him. He had held his hand and told him about his experience in the foster system, how he had gone from one foster family to another until he found a home in the Barnes household. Incidentally, this was also how Peter made his first and very best friend.
Tony shook his head, dismissing the thought quickly. If he had just wanted to sow some wild oats he wouldn't have spent time getting acquainted with his son. He wouldn't have set aside his precious time to babysit Peter. He wouldn't keep telling him that he and Peter were the biggest blessing in his life.
There was another family, the Kaplans. They were crying and holding Tony's hand, thanking them profusely for Steve's act of bravery. Tony had just muttered cold okays. It wasn't okay with him though. It didn't seem okay to his nine year old self that he had to lose his Papa for some strangers.
To his surprise the younger man quickly waved his apology away with an earnest look on his face. "It's completely fine, I know how kids can be. Besides, Peter is a very polite little boy."
Peter glanced up at him sheepishly, Steve gave him a suspicious look. The older man almost groaned as the small brunette turned on his superpower,
He smiled nervously, feeling his heart skip a beat as he gazed at the other man. Tony's lips were swollen from kissing, his coffee brown eyes even darker with lust.
Steve gave him a sparkling smile and started to gather his stuff to move away from the table. Tony bit his lip, feeling a twinge of sadness as he watched the man walk away. To his surprise, Steve turned around halfway and gave him a small wave. Tony grinned and returned him the lamest thumbs up in the universe.
The blonde beamed "Agent Coulson told us you'll be moving in today, Mr. Stark. I'm Susan Storm, I live two houses to your left."
"It's not me, Mrs.Storm! I promise!" Peter pleaded, feeling his eyes burn with tears. What would his daddy think if Mrs. Storm said that he had been naughty?
Padding his way through the silent hall, Tony felt shivers run through his spine. The house was silent but he could sense it was the dangerous kind. Just like the silence before a storm.
And just like that, Steve felt like somebody had punched him on the solar plexus. He chewed on the insides of his lip as Tony stared at him hopefully. He felt his chest seize in fear as he opened the car door. Letting out a shaky breath, he slid inside and clawed at the seatbelts.
"I'll need to print some paperwork before we head out. Let's meet at the SI entrance in 30 minutes, Steve? We can head over together."
He made Tony promise to get some rest before ending the call and starting his hike for the day. As the day progressed, he received a couple more calls, one from Nat and Clint, and one from Bruce, all wishing him a happy birthday. He even got a text from Fury that included a little cake emoji.
Fury was much more understanding than Steve thought he would be. He even said Steve should take his time touring the country, that SHIELD would be here when he got back. It was even a little comforting (and maybe a little scary) when Fury told him that if he was needed for an emergency mission, there would be no problem, as anyone was easy to find these days. So, Steve left SHIELD headquarters with a smile and his vacation time, off to talk to the rest of the Avengers about his leave.
agree to a day off? But as Steve pulled Tony down into his lap on the loveseat, he couldn’t help but wonder what the others would say when they got there.
quickly.” He kept looking through Steve’s phone, pulling up article after article of text. The Ironman suit retracted, housing itself back into his chest plate. Steve could see now, on his right hand - his ring finger. This Tony was wearing a ring. Though it was on the wrong hand, it was definitely a wedding ring, with a gorgeous band under it - a dark metallic gold. The same color as the Ironman suit he’d just been wearing. “Come on. Need to go to the lab.” Without a second thought, Tony was walking out into the hallway.
"Hear...you." He took a long breath in, and out. He opened his eyes, not sure when exactly he'd closed them. He saw the light again. The little light he'd seen earlier, it was his phone on the stand.
He pulled his phone out again, and opened the picture. He needed to see it - needed to know that this had really happened.
Which is why Tony was currently giving Steve the grand tour, finishing it off in the bedroom of his new apartment, just one floor under Tony's own penthouse that was currently getting a new set of windows installed. Seeing how Tony was being so generous and obviously didn't want to talk about their fight, he decided to let it go for now.
"Haha, yeah. Stuck in that shell of yours. Even when you aren't in the Ironman suit, you just put on a work suit. Stuck, see?."
"Thank you Tony. Truly. You've done so much for me." He straightened up and looked Tony straight in the eyes, "I wanted to say that I'm so sorry that I lost my temper with you the other day."
"Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow." Tony tapped Steve's chest with one hand, and then let go of him and took a step back, Steve missed the contact. "Get some rest."
"I think I've got it. Thank you for picking me up, and taking care of me. I'll see you tomorrow?" That wasn't too much to ask, was it?
I had to fly over in War Machine, Tony. You said it was an emergency. Do you know how annoying it is to get last minute air clearance?" Rhodey planted his forehead into his palm.
know how that stuff works, right?” Bucky teased through a mouthful of noodles. “Or do you need us to teach you? I don’t mind going to grab a banana and a condom real quick.”
“M..More.” He demanded, and Steve pushed in deeper. “More!” He whined, so Steve slowly sheathed himself further to his pleas, until he was all the way in. Tony panted heavily next to his ear, arms fully encasing his neck now, hanging onto him for dear life. Tony's cock, trapped between them, was fully leaking now, drops of pre-cum rolling down his stomach, tickling his skin, dripping onto the sheets. Tony’s gaze was unfocused, all he knew right now was the feeling of Steve’s fat cock inside him.
Steve honestly wasn't expecting that reaction, and as quick as his reflexes were, his hands remained hovering behind Tony's back. He didn't know whether he could - whether he was
“No...no.” Tony’s expression steeled. “You must have me confused with someone else. That’s not...that’s not me.”
but this emotionless state they were in now, as if they hadn't been best friends just a year ago. As if they meant nothing to each other.
Now it was Tony’s turn to look on in fascination. Steve watched Tony as his eyes grew, and he licked his lips. He realized that this was the first time Tony was seeing him completely naked, and it made Steve’s heart skip a beat. He couldn't help but follow Tony's eyes, they were intense, inquisitive, like so many times before, when he was first learning about Steve, unlocking bits and pieces of him, little by little. His gaze wasn't calm and tranquil like Other-Tony's. It was wild and fiery like the Tony he knew, his dark, full lashes bordering deep, dark galaxies that he could get lost in forever.
"So that's the basic movement we'll keep throughout. It sounds like they're sticking to samba and salsa, so this should be fine. Now, leading is easy, I'll show you how. That's what
So Steve told him. Everything. From the awkwardness of trying to learn to work together as a team, to finding out about Bucky and Hydra, to Ultron, to the bombing in Vienna and the horrible climax in Siberia.
Steve looked over, locking eyes with a small, older woman who gave him a meek smile. He smiled back.
"I know I said I'd try not to eat too much, but I don't know if I'm ready for any snacks." Steve absently rubbed his stomach.
"We...I...uh, last night. I tried to stay up to read that last article but...I guess I must've nodded off too. And when I woke up this morning...I was still in your bed. We, uh..." He trailed off. Was it weird to say they cuddled? Did he even need to mention that part? He searched Tony's face for any indication of anger or disgust, but the other man's expression remained neutral. He didn't even realize they were standing there in silence for several seconds until Tony blinked and seemed to come back to Earth.
"Miss Everhart's pupil dilation does increase by 29% when faced with Mr. Rogers." Vision calculated. "I am not an expert at human interaction, but the data suggests that-"
just days before such a big event. All the major news outlets would be there. Steve considered how he could spin this - the media would surely notice that Tony wasn’t speaking to him - that is, if he showed up at all.
"Yeah. With the Avengers." Tony nodded, so Steve continued. "Then, after defeating him, we all parted ways for a few months. Tony came back to each of us to ask us to move into the tower, which we did. We stayed there for a few years, mostly working jobs for SHIELD, and-"
"Go get some sleep, would ya? I'm gonna ask Jarvis when I get to Philly and if you're not in bed by then, I'm driving right back."
Tony responded with a blank expression. He was caught off guard, hadn't anticipated having this conversation without
"I apologise, Captain Rogers. It seems Mr. Stark would like to relay some more information to you as he makes his way downstairs." Jarvis said in a remorseful voice. Steve thought he might never get used to the AI, it was a little nerve wracking to suddenly hear a voice or see floating images around the tower without warning.
I hope you all liked it, and I look forward to writing more Stony fics, because I just cannot stay away from these two lovebirds :)
Tony gasped and jolted awake. He felt heavy, terrified, and saw Steve Roger's face staring back at him. For a second, he thought he might be dead, when he heard another roar, and looked around, seeing Hulk and Thor standing around him as well.
Sitting on a bench overlooking the sea, he took out his notebook and flipped to a blank page, starting a list.
“You mean you didn’t tell anyone where you went?” Steve gaped. “Tony - you - you could have gotten hurt! You could have been trapped over there, and no one would know where you were! You could have brought over a monster or some evil version of yourself for all you know!”
"That's my queue. Sorry to cut it short, Grandpa. Romanoff and Birdbrain share the floor below yours, Brucie's usually around here somewhere, so ask them or Jarvis if you need anything. You remember how to get to the garage if you need your bike?"
Steve was overjoyed that Tony had taken the time to get to know him well enough to give him such a fun day together. He couldn't remember the last time he'd smiled so much - his face hurt from all the laughing he'd been doing all day. They stopped by a sushi restaurant, but didn't stay - instead they carried lots of boxes of takeout to the car and made their way to the hotel. Tony had suggested they eat in, after such an eventful day. Steve agreed, it would be nice to relax out of the scorching California sun. Soon they were at the hotel lobby, picking up their hotel keys - or rather, key.
"Grab two of the cooling pipes over on the table" Tony pointed in some general direction as he mumbled through a blue wire currently being chewed through, fumbling with some wires in the leg of his suit. "Bring the welding gun and soldering iron. And two sets of gloves. This system is
“I don’t even want to think about it, baby.” Steve kissed his temple. “You never know, maybe we helped them along.”
Far away, someone was trying to talk to him. But they sounded robotic. It didn't sound real. He couldn't make out what they were saying.
Steve jerked his head up and down. But what if they couldn't see him? It was so dark. He tried to say something, but he couldn't get the words out. What if they couldn't hear him and they left him all alone again?
"Just gonna clean up my station, I'll head up in a few." Tony stood and started making his way back to his work table. "You go on to bed, sleepyhead."
"So." Steve didn't know what to say, now that it was just the two of them. Things didn't seem so complicated before. Now, he was struggling to find the words. He didn't want to burden Tony with another problem, but he knew he should tell Tony about the...incident. Otherwise, it would be weird, right? He was sure it wasn't exactly normal for friends to sleep cuddled up like that. It might upset Tony, but he knew that keeping it a secret would be worse.
They had a nice breakfast, Tony prepping Steve on all the worst characters he would have to meet that day. Soon, it was time for Steve to go.
“Mmmph!” He could hear Tony’s muffled protest into a pillow. “No! Harder! You know I can take it!” Steve wasn’t sure he’d ever….spanked Tony before. Well - there was that one time - the first time they trained in combat together at the SHIELD gym - before Steve had even moved into the Tower. It was the day Tony had come to ask him to move in, actually. It had been a good workout, much to Steve’s surprise. He didn’t know back then that Tony could move so...gracefully outside the suit. He’d smacked Tony on the bottom goodnaturedly afterwards with a “good job, Tones.” Tony had stiffened up, muttering a thanks and quickly changing the subject back to his moving arrangement, so Steve thought he’d been uncomfortable with it and never did it again. Apparently though, Tony still remembered that day, and wanted some more.
"Nonsense. Let me return the favor, gorgeous." Tony kept one hand on Steve's chest so he would stay put while he made his way lower, kissing and licking Steve's chest, his nipples, abs, the curve of his hips. Steve was so sensitive right now, ready to burst any second.
"Mister Rogers, we had no idea-" Fucking Williams again. Steve saw a flash of red before sucking in a sharp breath and interrupting.
He hadn’t realized that he was hugging Tony so close until he felt soft pecks on his moist temples. Tony, the sweetheart, was giving him little kisses to bring him back down.
“Well, that’s where the divergence happened, then.” Tony announced. “Without a doubt. It’s not an atomic level change. It’s smaller than that. It’s at the quantum level, the double slit experiment was correct. Quantum mechanics offers true randomness, regardless of the state of the universe, so truly random and completely different outcomes can happen between our universes, even if they are completely identical in every other way. The photons must have turned the opposite way here, which proves randomness in spite of all other factors being equal and-”
He heard the elevator door ding from the hallway, and began to mentally steel himself. This was it. He’d just need to take whatever scrutiny or humiliation resulted from this. He
"Oh it's no trouble, Mister Rogers." The lady smiled. Her name tag said Lauren. "We just wanted to make sure you were okay. Please, take your time. We aren't busy today, so there's no rush."
"Pep-peroni, are you using Stevie against.....me?" Tony looked around them and realized they were the only ones left in the room, the tv playing an infomercial on a new kind of hair curler. "Uh....J? Did we miss the rapture or something?"
“Mhm.” Tony shut him up with his lips. It took a couple hours for Steve to finally send out the Avengers call for a mandatory relaxation day.
"It's been a tough season for them, but I think they'll bounce back. Good, Stevie. Good job. The Mets were giving them a run for their money for a while there. Thankfully Cincinnati gave em a break. That's it, you're doing great."
The illustrations aren't perfect, it's actually much harder to draw naked bods than I thought it would be, but I tried my best, dangit!
Tony raised an eyebrow and sat next to Steve, who was trying to rub tears out of his eyes. "It doesn't look like you love it. What's wrong, Stevie?"
“Finally!” Sam exclaimed as he too dropped on the couch next to Bucky. “All that moping around from the both of you is done now, I hope?”
"It's a StarkPhone, you can make calls on it, though it does way more than that. But yes, all yours, Cap. Don't think of losing it either - it's not like the ones you can buy just anywhere. Of course, you'll need to learn how to use it before you leave. Play with it for now, Jarvis will let you know if you're about to accidentally post a nude to Twitter or something. I'll teach you the important stuff next week when the rebuild settles down a little."
“Oh.” Tony replied carefully. “Me too. I want to try too.” He scratched the back of his neck in embarrassment. “I, uh...I might’ve...forgotten to tell you. The Other-Steve...he kissed me. When I went to the mirror universe.”
Tony walked up to the cargo doors, and Steve ran to his side, waving the others off. Unfortunately, they couldn’t get very far in the cramped space of the quinjet, watching their leaders crumble in front of them. Steve pulled Tony’s shoulder around anyways, adamant at making him stay.
“F-FRIDAY?” Tony looked scared. “What are you...what are you doing in the mainframe?” He turned his rage back to Steve. “What did you do with Jarvis!?”
So Tony fought. burdened with the knowledge that he and Steve would need to work together to keep their world safe - he fought to bring them back together, no matter how much it hurt. But
“Tony, I’m so sorry that I made you feel this way.” Steve ran a big hand down the back of his neck, and Tony choked out an involuntary sob. It was so warm and wonderful, and he never wanted him to stop. “I’m so sorry for leaving. I
“Jarvis - please let your Tony know that he needs to depolarize the lab and the observatory. Thanks for all your help, old pal.” Tony spoke, trying not to croak.
After an agonizing minute, Tony seemed to have come to some sort of conclusion. He snapped back to reality, and straightened up, not letting go of Steve's hand.
Right outside Dallas, but exhausted from his long drive today, Steve decided it was time to pack it in for the night. He pulled off into a small inn that thankfully had no wait. With eyes half lidded, he opened the door to his room and all but collapsed face-first into the bed. Right before floating away in slumber, he heard his phone go off.
side, of course.” He threw his arm towards Nat and Clint, “And don’t get me started on the lovebirds over there.” He pointed at Wanda and Vision. “They’re all only here because of you, and they don’t trust me as far as they can throw me. And, let’s see, who’s on MY side? No one, that’s who. This might as well be
Tony couldn’t hear the concern in Steve’s voice. In fact, all he could hear now was a high pitched ringing in his ears. All he could hear was that Steve was leaving. Leaving
"That's enough!" Steve boomed, loud enough to make everyone, even Bruce, look up in surprise. "I'm a grown man and I've been in this century long enough to know how to take care of myself. I'm not an idiot. You can't stop me from going." He stomped over, right in Tony's face, challenging him to say otherwise.
He was also trying to make it easier on Other-Tony by keeping the suit on. It would take hours to depolarize the tower if he were to spread his atoms all over the place. But well, he already knew it would be a bitch to do the same once he got home, seeing how he’d sent over an unaware Tony Stark into his own universe. So he supposed he’d just have to tell Jarvis to let Other-Tony know he needed to depolarize the observation deck if he didn’t want to blow his cover. He flipped up his faceplate, ready to come up with some excuse for whatever the other man needed, when Steve kissed him.
"Do you want to get on the bed now, Steve? You'll feel better there. That way I can see you, make sure you're okay.''
“Yeah, but I wanna win.” He said through a mischievous grin. Oh God, Tony was turning this into some kind of twisted game, where his ejaculation was the high score.
Steve practically jogged downstairs, figuring it would be better to find out if the construction crew outside needed any help, than to sit with his own thoughts.
“I just missed you, is all.” Tony purred, as he boldly climbed on Steve’s lap, wrapping his arms around his neck. Steve leaned against the headboard, his cock quickly woke up too, taking great interest in the direction of this conversation.
If only...ugh. Steve should be thrilled. He's been so lonely these past few weeks, and really, he did feel a lot better now that he was home, surrounded by loving, caring friends. But he still felt a little empty for some reason. After showering and changing, he threw himself back into his bed. The sun hadn't even set yet. He wondered what Tony was up to.
in person - the photographs didn't do him justice. He was unquestionably pure, truly an Adonis. As sinfully gorgeous as he was, he was not susceptible to the evils of their time, he could do no wrong. And Tony
Now....now it was like they could never see eye to eye. He wouldn’t be surprised if he walked back through the portal and found a fuming Captain waiting to tear him a new one for some reason or another. It was no use dwelling on the past.
"Sorry. I just meant, are you settling in okay at the tower? I know Tony can be a little overwhelming sometimes, but I hope you're comfortable living there."
“You’re avoiding my question.” Steve grinned. This Steve was just as infuriating as the one back home too.
"Is that what you want?" Tony playfully slid his legs over to Steve's and rubbed his shin with his shoe under the table.
"Shit Steve it's already 10! Why did you let me fall asleep? I knew this was a bad idea, let's just call the whole thing off-" Tony burst through Steve's apartment door, and was rendered speechless at finding the supersoldier sitting at his dining room table in a full suit, next to Pepper Potts of all people. "Uh..."
“Oh Steve!” A shrill voice stopped him in his tracks. Tony must’ve heard it too - he turned his head just slightly to see who was calling out for Steve before going back to his own conversation.
So as they said their goodnights, Tony stood at his workbench and tried to organize as he mulled over his thoughts.
He straightened his tie and took a deep breath in the mirror before leaving, heading straight to the quintet before he lost his nerve. He walked right in, seeing everyone already on board, except for one man.
"You wanna talk about suspicious? How about their two new henchmen suddenly slow dancing together out of nowhere? How is that NOT suspicious?" Tony whispered to Nat as quietly as he could, but Steve had already dragged him to the dance floor nonetheless. He heard the song 'Lover' come on, and groaned internally. The lyrics alone made him blush furiously. If he didn't die of a bullet to his head, he would die of the sheer embarrassment of having to dance to THIS with Steve. In his peripheral, he could already see surprised heads turning as Steve took his hand, slowly starting to sway him to the rhythm of the music, closer and closer to the extraction point under the wide glass of the skylight.
"Easy!" Clint emerged again from the bathroom. "You gotta laugh at all his jokes, and touch his arm a lot, and compliment him. Tell him he looks sexy-ow!" He got a flick on his hand from Natasha when he walked too close.
Bucky wiped a tear from his eye. “I swear, this shit could only happen to you, Stevie. How the hell did you not know it wasn’t Tony?”
“It’s not a big deal Ton-” Steve turned back, and they both saw each other, covered in white, sticky powder.
Well, that was that, he supposed, heading back to his room. He tried to clear his mind by packing, but couldn't focus. It felt...wrong. Like every pair of socks he stuffed in his bag was shoving another rock into the pit of his stomach.
"It's not like he's in any danger, Tony." Bruce looked up from his corner, where he had been quietly reading until now. "He's Captain America. Plus, weren't you famous back in the 40's, Steve? I'm sure he's used to it."
“You’ll put me to sleep if ya’ keep doin’ that.” Tony’s words were already beginning to slur. He was more tired than he realized. Maybe an overnight interdimensional research trip
"Sir," Jarvis quietly spoke up from Tony's phone. "Your sleeping pills are in the top compartment of your black suitcase."
The next couple hours were a blast. After looking around the stadium itself, they headed straight to the Club level to look at all the most important gear, jerseys, and home plates from over the years. Tony explained special games to him, and though Steve had missed it all in his years in the ice, he felt happy hearing all about the team's great accomplishments. They went into the clubhouse, where they saw the team's locker room, and got to play in the batting cages for a while. They took some funny photos of each other decked out in player gear, and Steve made Tony bend over in laughter as he picked up an entire kettle bell rack, saying maybe he should be a baseball player too. They went into the field, taking a ball and a couple of mitts from the fan store on the way, and true to his word, Tony played catch with Steve for a while as they talked about the Dodger's record, going into detail on the biggest wins and losses. Tony insisted that Steve take a picture sliding into home base, and Steve tried to pose without getting dirt all over his pants, which wasn't successful but he couldn't have cared less. From there, they eagerly ran to the dugout when a worker came out and announced that he had some hot dogs waiting for them.
After the 5th inning, Tony was getting irritated at the constant back and forth. The next time Steve came to his side, he grabbed his arm, dragged them to the couch in front of the big screen, and yanked him down beside him.
"Captain Rogers? Mister Stark has returned for the day and is heading down to his lab." Steve let out a shaky breath. Even after weeks living here, he still wasn't used to Jarvis sometimes.
But of course, they clashed. The breathtaking Roman statue turned its gaze on him and pierced his crude insecurity masked as humor, and they clashed. Again and again.
"You're a lost cause." Rhodey threw an arm around his friend and led them down. "Don't bother me with this shit again until he actually makes out with you."
"It certainly is." Steve knocked his shoulder. "You don't need to be modest on my account. You really have been nothing if not an amazing friend to me, you know."
“These two dummies, dummy!” Clint announced, shoving himself between Tony and Steve, hugging them close. “It’s all thanks to me!”
"Hey Rhodes? Can I borrow you a minute?" Pepper smiled at the Colonel, raising her eyebrows towards the pair currently giggling to themselves about the shocked looks Steve got at the meeting.
Tony was carrying bags of equipment and notebooks. He looked flushed and tired. His frown leaned to the right, just a little. His annoyed scowl was all too familiar.
"He's being modest." Pepper interjected. "He was amazing, Tony. It went better than we ever could have hoped for. I don't want to make any promises, but if the board votes yes tomorrow, you know who to thank."
"You're going to scan my muscles?" Steve instinctively got into a defensive position when some holograms of the alien creatures they battled a few months ago suddenly appeared all around him.
“And they want to know if you need them to baby-proof the bar, or if you’re going to get rid of it altogether.” Steve held Tony’s hands once they boarded the elevator.
“Guess I changed the locks, huh?” Tony chuckled. Of course his Jarvis would make a Star Wars reference at him. “What date is it?”
No time to ponder that, he needed to get back to it. Tony started scanning his notes for anomalies again. Steve continued to watch as Tony tried to focus on the numbers. But it was hard to do with this Steve so close, completely in his personal space. When he rested his chin on Tony’s shoulder, he slammed the notebook shut and looked over at him.
To his surprise, everyone agreed. Even Thor was excited to have a place to stay when he came back to visit his 'Midgardian companions.'
When Laura asked how they slept the next morning at breakfast, Steve cheerfully answered that they'd slept well, while Tony stabbed the sausage on his plate with his fork.
“I...I love you too.” He whispered. Tony smiled sadly at him before walking up to the machine panels. He quickly checked the screens again, scribbling something in one of the notebooks before giving Steve a thumbs up, and stepping up to the frame. In the empty cavity, a dark opening appeared.
Steve nervously opened the door to the surprisingly cozy bedroom. It was small, looked nothing like the rest of the penthouse. There were clothes in piles and nothing elegant to speak of other than the huge and out of place looking bed. Tony was sitting up in the bed, leaning against the exquisite mahogany headboard, surrounded by a mountain of pillows and blue hologram screens. Scattered around the bed were huge textbooks and important looking papers littering the floor. He was reading through an article on a hologram when he looked up, swiping it to the side and pulling up a chart with his other hand.
