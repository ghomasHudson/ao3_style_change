Steve still wonders. Would his father be proud of the man he became today? A question that would never be answered, yet he feels that it has shaped his life in its absence regardless.
"I told myself that I would wait for you." Tony continues. "And I thought I could wait, until however long you took. I would wait. But facing death again and again, it's made me think of all the lost time." Tony admits sadly, dropping his gaze. "I don't want to lose any more time. This is me being selfish and asking you to be mine, and all that entails."
Steve kisses Tony just to shut him up, grabs him by his shirt and drags him in.
“Happy mentioned burgers?”
“He just talked and. I wasn’t-”
Stevos scoffs and turns around, annoyance in his steps. “He can’t see me. Act normal.” Stevos grunts.
“Cara’s a Mid-level Alpha. Marlow is a Low-level Beta, which means, in ten words or less, that he is hormonally closer to being an Omega. As a point of reference, High-level Betas have hormone levels closer to Alpha readings.”
There’s a temperamental growl in the room that comes from Tony, who hasn’t stopped thrusting his cock into Steve but doesn't sound happy with the intrusion either.
All it takes is a twitch of Tony’s fingers, a suggestion of what he wants, and they’re fumbling into another room, where there was wreckage and debris falling from the ceiling. The house is at it’s post-party state, broken vases and littered drinks that happened before Rhodey had arrived to take the suit.
It must show on his face because Tony grins at him. “What?” Tony says coyly.
“When Ma died, it was a huge shock. She never said a thing ‘bout it, never said she was feeling bad or nothing. When we went by the clinic to see her, it felt like the entire world just broke when the Doc said she was gone.” Sadness tinges his voice. It’s been two years but it still hurts to think about it. His mother was gone and he never got to say goodbye, never got to tell her he loved her one more time, never got to hug her and kiss her, and thank her for everything she’d sacrificed for him, and there would never be a next time.
They sit in amicable silence for a while, Steve taking his time with his drink now, afraid that as soon as he finishes, he’d have to say something, nervous about the topic at hand.
Omega, we shall be clear about that now, but still very much a virgin.” There’s another burst of chatter, disbelief rattles throughout the room. Tony knows what an Omega’s expected duty is, and it wasn’t cleaning the house. It was to lie in bed and seduce, produce pups for the Alpha. It was hard to think that this one would be untouched, especially if it already had a first Alpha.
And Steve does see it. In the sag of Tony's body, in the glassiness of his eyes. His scent, which would have normally made him want to be close to the Alpha, smells spiky and sick. It didn't make him want Tony any less, but he could feel the reluctance in the normally proud Alpha.
“Uh, wait.” Steve calls out, prying his phone out from his pocket. “Here.”
He does owe him. “Are you sure about that? Isn’t there anything I could possibly do?” He says, as coy as he can muster, flutters his lashes like the gals in the USO used to do when they sold war bonds to deep-pocketed Alphas.
The Omega lets out a choked snarled, and all of a sudden, Tony’s on his back, arms pinned above his head, and a very
Steve nods, catches the darker undertone of the conversation and says no more.
Which is strange in itself, being able to read about himself in book, almost as surreal as dying. He feels near anxious about the things they’ve gotten right and takes some comfort on the details they’ve gotten wrong.
With a growl, Tony mounts him in one thrust, cock pushing into his ring of muscles, forcing his way through the slick, wet passage that so craved the attention. Steve feels like he’s been punched in the gut, unable to breath, unable to think as he focuses on the feeling of Tony’s cock buried deep inside him, trying to process the pleasure that washed over his body of
Steve scratches the back of his neck, offering a shy smile.
“I understand.” Steve says, a different chill going down his body, the night spoiled despite their success. The memories come rising, of cold winter night when his lungs wouldn’t cooperate and when he’d try to stifle them, because he felt so useless and he didn’t need to wake Bucky enough with his damn cough. Bucky still needed to work down the docks in the early morning, bring home enough for the both of them to survive on, especially with scarcity of food already.
He swallows and quiets down, closes his eyes and trusts the Alpha.
##########
He’d seen the arc reactor before, though never without clothing. Before Tony can take notice of his hesitation Steve lavishes the power source with licks, taking careful attention to where the body met metal. The saltiness of Tony’s sweat-drenched skin and the clean taste of alloy making Steve’s head spin. By the sound of Tony’s moans, he is enjoying the attention.
“We don’t have much time, Mr. Stark.”
Focusing on the suit is a welcomed act, something to keep his mind pre-occupied with. Already Tony’s voice (rambling) has calmed him down enough that his skin doesn’t feel like it’s about to peel off, from inside out.
Steve knows a thing or two or three about feeling like there was something tethering from making change in his life. For a long time, he had thought that it was him being an
“Anthony Stark.” Stevos says suddenly, stopping in his tracks. “I must warn you. When you return to America, you will face a foe that you will not expect. Promise me that you will stick to your beliefs.”
##########
He comes in his fist after a few more strokes, and washes away the remnants of his activities.
Ed grunts, thrusts into Steve just a little rougher. “Omegas are made for sex, son. You get yourself a nice Omega and you can enjoy them all the time.”
“You think
, show me what you can do.”
He begins drinking a concoction to battle the effects of the palladium poisoning. It’s also starting to get harder to function properly, when pain begins to become an everyday thing. Where his muscles freeze up and the pain runs its course.
They couldn't afford being in hospitals. He was only ever in them when his mother couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. It hadn't even started out as a concept of money. He noticed, at five years old, that whenever they went to the doctors, his mother just looked sad. He didn't want her to be, felt awful whenever he was sick because it meant that it made his mother worry.
##########
“This yours?”
So he stares down at the terrorist, even as his yells get more and more irritated, gun pointed aggressively at him until the man presses the tip of the rifle right to Tony’s forehead.
“You still doubt your worth?” Stevos says, genuinely surprised. “I have told you, time and time and again that you will change the world, Anthony. This.” Stevos runs a palm over the arc reactor, and it's always so strange that it doesn’t feel invasive, like Stevos is meant to touch it. “Will help guide you and your vision for the world.” Stevos smiles, looks just as proud as any, even while Tony must look so disgusting after crying his eyes out.
He looks to Clint, already curled in bed, sheets pooled at the end of the bed because of the heat, but not yet asleep, in fact, stares right back at him, as if expecting something of him.
Tony frowns. "I have a chef for that. You didn't have to prepare anything."
##########
“We don’t do that here.” It’s firm, no hint of doubt in his voice, and makes Steve feel relieved. That was one thing off his chest.
“Terrible, paper’s going horribly. The project though. ” Tony’s eyes light up. “You wouldn’t believe what I’ve been up to since last night, I’ve added probably another six hundred lines of code and I’m nowhere even close to finishing, and that’s all just algorithm stuff so far, all very situational, I haven’t even started anywhere near the hardware involved and that’ll be another assembly language up in tow-”
“Fine.
The pride that emanates from Tony could be tasted in the air, as sure as the sweetness of honey.
Tony manages to cajole Stevos onto his back. With his legs spread, he looks about as wanton as he could be, and gorgeous to boot. Flushed chest, lean muscle, cock hard, legs spread obscenely wide for Tony.
The Alpha goes very still, surprised first and foremost, but the energy seems to hum with more curiosity than anger.
“Which reminds me, I think I owe you an apology.”
“I’ll come visit you.” Stevos says quietly after Tony’s third gulp.
“Hi.”
"In a couple of days. I'm having your visa done as we speak."
And that’s the question, wasn’t it? As much they’d been dancing around each other, the reason Bucky hasn’t settled with anyone yet, the reason Steve still comes back like a wet kitten every time. Waiting. Forever. On the precipice of something (anything).
Hawkeye (Clint) pauses at that, scent going weary.
“Holy fuck you feel good.” Tony breathes, picking up the base as the heat in his legs start to make it hard to concentrate.
He’s hot, sensitive. Andrew left him a few minutes ago, or has it been an hour already? He’s not sure.
Tony places a hand on Steve’s shoulder, sliding down the collar of his shirt, then further to his navel, and turns around. A request if anything.
“Whatever, I’m a shitty listener anyway. You’re better off talking to JARVIS than me for emotional output.”
This is probably not the story that people want me working on, but I got so enraptured by this setting that I haven't really worked on anything else.
“Go ahead Steve, tell me what I should do when you give up.” Lacks venom, like Bucky’s finally tired of arguing with him.
Slowly, Tony’s breathing evens out, the shudder in his breath dissipates, until Steve can hear Tony’s quickened heartbeat underneath the silence.
Tony scrounges around the scrap pile, setting aside piles of metal until he lets off a satisfied sound and brings an oddly familiar shape to Steve.
So he does. Dreamlessly sleeps.
It starts out slow, a careful almost curious dance as they take in each other's taste. Steve, already half-gone from Tony’s scent alone, feels himself falling further as he samples the man. He tastes of dark promise and night skies, cool, clean, and it makes him well aware of the dampness between his legs.
##########
Pepper joins them for a while, and it’s nice to see Tony interact with people for a change that didn’t involve half-snide remarks and cursing (like on the internet videos). Something is slack in Tony’s body with Pepper around, and Steve doesn’t object to that.
“An Omega can dream.”
“Then he says he wants a kissing in exchange for fixing my gun.” He leaves out the part where Howard makes a lewd joke about helping him shoot straight, that particular line had him cringing on the spot. “At this point, he’s hangin offa my shoulder, the guys are starting to get a little antsy, people are looking our way.” He blushes at the memory. The muttering that had been audible to his hearing, the cleared throats and unfettered stares.
Stevos doesn’t seem to mind that he’s laying on what must be a thousand dollars worth of gin, nor being stripped naked when Tony rips away the cheap fabric that covers his body. It’s soft and cottony in his hands, light and sinewy when he really clutches it in his fingers. It doesn’t make much sense, because if it were truly that fragile, it would have ripped a long time ago with how it stretches ridiculously over Stevos’s chest. It also doesn’t make much sense when he tosses the scrap of fabric and turns to look at Stevos, and finds him absolutely naked on the couch, shirt and pants gone, leaving him a dizzying display of flesh.
“If you would like for me to stay, I can. But I cannot be here forever, Tony.”
“Well, it was a gift.” Tony turns it over again, so that the curve of the shield rested unstably on the table. “In the middle of the war, the government was trying to get as much help as possible. Funding, technology, supplies, anything to sustain the war and win. ” He tests the wobble of the shield, frowns, and motions for them to move away.
There's something absurdly correct in the moment, to have another Alpha than the one he started with, stronger, better, makes his instincts sing and flutter when the Alpha rumbles something incoherent and takes him.
Steve swears the spot tingles.
Steve mules it over for a moment. “Later. After work.” He makes a point to say. A chance, to let the Alpha say what he wanted to say and be done with it. And if he had the wrong idea then Steve could be more than rude enough to defend his own dignity.
“And if I refuse? Would you kill me just to shut me up?”
What good is a private jet if you can’t fly it out whenever you want? Exactly. I’m texting Coulson that you’re taking the jet. ”
By dinner time, he checks to see if Tony is in his lab and brings him some food if the man refuses to surface from his work. Then it was back to reading and lounging until it was time to sleep.
A quick thanks to Jarvis and he walks through the home. The furniture has been rearranged somewhat, roomier, though everything was still there. He vaguely wonders if his room has been touched in anyway, but then quickly dismisses the thought.
“So you’re choosing him as your Alpha?”
It’s a quiet moment of misery before Natasha answers from the passenger seat. “There’s been a decline in Omega population as of late, no better market to sell them in.” Sounds as grim as it was. And Steve can make the connection from there. Slaves, or whatever equivalent it was to the present standard, forced servitude to the will of the buyer. There was more than one way to imprison a human.
##########
Clint scoffs, presses his back against the wall as a guard walks past them. They needed to get to the Omegas first, in case the guards got antsy and shoot their cargo if they thought that would be easier for them.
“Good evening, Captain Rogers. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.”
James thinks it is.
“I would have thought that you
Tony nods solemnly, like he’s used to it.
to hand over his suit.
“I shall talk with your leader, but Loki stays by my side.” He grunts, twirls his hammer, and shoots up towards the sky, with Loki under his arm.
“Oh, he worries too much. Always has. Has this weird idea that I might blow myself up if he isn’t looking. Me? Blow myself up? As if, right?” Steve can hear rustling cloth in the background, as if Tony was nestling sheets around him. Makes him want to be there, right next to Tony.
It’s quite touching really. Not a scratch on the bike. Steve’s never had anything fresh out of the factory before but he imagines this is what it would be like. He’s just itching to take her out for a spin, wind in his hair, curled around that body while he speeds through the open road, nothing but the roar of the wind as his company.
“Good Alpha.”
“Sounds like you didn’t trust him too much.” He knows he’s encroached on something personal here.
“Lost you again, Cap. Was it the triad? Everyone crowding around us? Want something to drink? Maybe we should leave-”
have this handled, there are fifteen alone following you, and ten more locked on you.”
Somehow, it feels like be’s drifting. From one thing to the next. The new arc reactor hasn’t been fully tested yet, but he’s putting her through her paces and so far she’s holding steady. He’s learned his lesson and has a couple of backups in his safe, and he has JARVIS run extra simulations in case this one fails too. He wants to be prepared for next time.
“Heard you were packing up.”
with weapons manufacturing, but it’s something those bastards don’t understand. We are not giving into them, even if they threaten to take the Iron Man again.”
“Aha! So you admit that you’re both colluding behind my back!”
Stevos pauses as he secures the bindings on Tony’s leg. It still hurts and throbs, but at least he’s not bleeding all over the place.
“High-level Omegas are generally top bitches, has the better gene pool, they know their place in a pack, produce the most pheromones which means they smell way way better to Alphas and Betas alike, and can have Heats for five to seven days, as compared to low-level Omegas who only Heat for one to two.”
##########
It feels both light and heavy, cool against his heated skin. Once Tony steps back, he tips his head to look up at him, hoping that Tony can see how grateful he is for the necklace.
“Oh yeah? What's that?”
And this was the part he was most anxious for.
It’s slow, painfully slow, both making use of what borrowed time they had to say what was difficult to put into words. Instead, they let their bodies talk, in a language more suited to Alpha and Omega.
And now to enjoy his bacon pancakes.
He gulps and nods.
Ed clears his throat. “You were very lovely tonight, Adam.” The fake name rings in his ears, but it makes him smile nonetheless. “A little willful at the start but that’s normal for unmarried Omegas. If you’re ever without an Alpha during heat…” He places a calling card on the bed, just next to Steve’s head. “The boy is still wet behind the ears, but I’m trying to do good by his mother and teach him how to treat an Omega properly. We’d provide for you, of course, during your entire stay, and a little extra to help you along afterwards.”
“It will, just give it some time.” Tony grits out, sweating even as the progress bar hits ninety.
. I forgot I had that. I forgot I bought that!”
“Now.” Tony pauses, abruptly stops walking to face the Beta, who nearly bumps right into him. “What was your name again?”
“Call my people.” Tony says, already uninterested. He’s looking back at Steve, a stern expression and pursed lips.
Steve ends up staying with him until Pepper arrives, and then it’s a tearful reunion that he thinks he really shouldn’t be around for.
“It’s a cocoa bar, pure chocolate.” Tony answers in lieu of Steve’s questioning look. “Sort of like dark chocolate, only a lot more condensed. Jarvis, well not
“I did you a big favor: I have successfully privatized world peace!” He announces to the court of assholes who make it sound like it’s his
Young, too young to be subjected to this kind of thing.
Tony, ripped and mangled to pieces, arc reactor long since dead, his armor crushed and bloodied.
She nods, another scratch on the paper. “Not a problem, either you come here or not, you gotta tell us so that we can warn the others. How long do your heats normally last?”
Tony clears his throat, and tries to act casual. “I guess this is good night?”
He’d been ready to jump right in, toss the two Alphas aside, but Natasha read that too.
“You love that don’t you.” Tony croons. The drag of the heavy girth around his walls is more than what Steve can take, he whimpers, mutters incoherent approval, muscles bunching together in the effort to take what Tony is giving, his legs so spread out that Tony can sit between his thighs with comfort, all the while pressing deep inside of him.
. No classes tomorrow because that would have just killed his mood for the rest of the night, but that didn’t mean he could slack off. Nope. He had a paper due by Monday, and then a machine project on Tuesday. He had made some headway through with the project but the paper wasn’t even done yet. Fucking business classes. He’d drop them if he could, but then he knew Howard would have him expelled from college somehow. The pull the old man had on the school was unbelievable, especially with how he was financing, like, seventy percent of the science department. Which was, yeah okay, Tony had some leeway there too because of it.
“Hey, Steve. Eyes up.” There’s a hand on his shoulder, the familiar scent of safety and earth enveloping him. Steve chances a peek, and is met with concerned brown. Eyes that tell him it’s going to be alright. “You okay?”
Without the serum, he would never have gotten here, to the future (present, he reminds himself), and he would never have gotten to seen all its wonders. Or meet Clint and Natasha. Or Tony.
Marlow excuses himself, presumably to look for Cara.
Stevos sits up, starts making hushing sounds and cups Tony’s face in his palms. “Calm, Anthony, calm.” He says in that deep commanding voice, strokes a thumb over Tony cheek, brings him in close and lets Tony rest his tear-drenched cheeks on his chest.
Anyway, here is this weeks chapter. A little longer than usual. Enter Tony.
, and Steve has to mentally tell himself not to squirm.
’ tone (Natasha’s assessment, not his) and Omega antics (Also Natasha’s assessment) to bring attention to himself instead.
“Upper it is. She’ll need something to help her appetite too.” He gets up to rifle through some boxes, trying to act as calmly as possible. Something must show on his face when he comes back with pills.
“I wasn’t always like this.” Stevos starts, motioning at himself with his free hand, careful not to jostle Tony from his position. “I was once a demi-god, half-god half-mortal. My mother, Athena, fell in love with my mortal father, who held the position of Captain in the army. He was a soldier, first and foremost, excelled in battle, brandished a sword with mastery, and commandeered the hearts of men when he spoke.” There was almost mock pride in Stevos’s voice. “But when he was thrust with a child, he floundered.”
##########
“No, test.” Stevos gives him a look. “This poisoning is caused by your technology. I am not adept to healing as others, but I-” He touches the arc reactor again, almost like he’s trying to get the feel of it. “It is connected to you. To your heart. Often the most difficult to heal.”
of thunder. Jarvis made me this whenever I was scarred from a thunderstorm. Or bribed me with it to get me into bed.” Tony chuckles, letting the mixture sit as he leaned over the counter to look at Steve.
Steve lets out a breath when Tony’s far enough, tugging the collar of his dress shirt that is suddenly too tight. He can feel the gold necklace digging into his clammy skin, and readjusts it.
Coulson would love to take this job, in fact, it might even be better if he did.”
“Then I leave you be. I mean you no harm, Anthony Stark, I shall leave if you find my presence distasteful.” Stevos gives him a kicked puppy look.
Clint laugh. “Aww, shit, nah Steve. Not like that. I’m happily married.” He shrugs impressive shoulders. “I know better than to snatch a High’s prize. And I wouldn’t do that to a friend.”
Steve fidgets in his seat but nods. He had vaguely wondered how this century handled the secondary sex, but no one had seemed to pay him much mind. He had caught a few Alphas staring at him from time to time, but then Betas and other Omegas did that too. He didn’t think it was so much him being an Omega than it was him being Captain America.
“I take it, it’s to your liking?”
“Expensive? Says who?”
them, as she puts it.
Tony looks calm like this, without the ragged edges of feral and stress to mar his face, handsome in a way that calls to the artist in Steve to capture the moment on paper Sort of like a wild animal suddenly caught in a rare moment of sleep, the sight suddenly worth much more with knowing. Steve carefully rests a blanket on top of him, tucking a stray hair to Tony’s ear that threatened to tickle his nose.
The boy, George, is a good amount taller than Steve, has black hair and a pudgy face, and quickly shoves whatever he had in his hand under his pillow.
“May I spend the night?” The uncertainty was endearing.
He doesn’t like it, feels too much like prying into lives of innocent people, but he does the best he can.
“What would you want me to do?”
He sweeps through his room, a last check before he tucks himself in for the night. Lingering hands on his sketchbook, he flips through the pages idly until he finds the sketch of Clint.
Steve thinks, because he’s certainly never seen him, and nobody picks a fight with James.
“Other people could have died.” He fires back, picking up where they had left off from the rooftop.
When Steve does return from a shower, with fresh-clothes, he finds Tony asleep on the couch, half-falling over.
They’re so close together, pressed as Stevos cradles Tony like he’s afraid that the man would break apart if he let go.
“Out. Get out. You are officially banned from the lab until you admit that robots are better than dogs in every possible way.
The blonde god laughs, even now, it still sounds like chimes to Tony’s ears, clear and warming, he wants to hear that laugh all the time.
“Hush now, it’s alright, there’s nothing to worry about.” Tony soothes, gently running his hands all over Steve’s sweat-drenched body, and it takes a while for Steve to connect the growling in the room to the sounds coming from his own throat.
“I-I don’t.” He sniffles, feels the pinpricks in his eyes, the gasp in his breath.
This might as well be considered a side chapter. It's a little on the short side but I thought it'd be interesting to put out.
He’s aware of the scene he’s making, his entrance slick with fluids that run down to his thighs, his fingers pressed into his hole to entice the Alpha, submissive and pliant. His cock hard and aching, balls pulled low by gravity.
Tony doesn’t say much about the first few pages, filled with dreary half-finished drawings of a Brooklyn he once knew. It had been the first on his mind when Happy handed him the sketchbook, the urge to draw had never felt so desperate.
“Does he have a huge knot?”
Tony’s going to die anyway, and he knows it. There are no medical supplies in their little camp, nothing to stop him from bleeding out, it would be a miracle if he lasted the day.
And gods he’s thick and long, bigger than anything Tony has seen, and Tony’s had his fair share of cock.
He says in his hug.
“What are you doing to the shield exactly?” Steve worried.
Gonna try to get the next chapter up to regular schedule but yeah, no promises still. My new job has me working ten hours a day, with saturdays so. Yeah, I actually get tired now, haha.
“It’s fine. Thank you.” Steve smiles back, with some fondness, knowing Ernie only means well, is soft at heart at most times and it’s just the way he is.
“Maybe.” Tony laughs, but leans down to kiss him anyway, short and sweet, a little crinkle in his nose when he pulls away. “Definitely.”
“Now that you mention it, you
“Steve, and I guess I’m Tony’s date.” There were only so many words he could say to a pretty gal.
“You can read and write, and that’s worth something.”
“God, Tony, yes.” He slurs, holding onto the sheets and biting into the pillow as Tony delivers a particularly hard shove, too drunk on lust to form any better words. “More,
“Okay?”
Omega yet. So, instead of forming a permanent triad of Alpha, Beta and Omega, they look for Omegas who can satisfy Cara’s desires.”
It answers on the first ring like it always does.
Hey, it only took a month.

“Hey!” After a day or two, He realized that Tony’s insults were his way of affection (Steve noticed that Tony threatened JARVIS on a daily basis), and the best way to deal with them was to play along (He learned that from JARVIS).
Steve wonders how quickly this went downhill.
“Nevermind. Of all the- Give me that.”
He waits until Clint settles down again, when his scent dampens down from the crackle of emotion he must be going through before he pops the question.
Tony’s overtaken by the urge to get closer to the scent. The room is much too large, Tony thinks, because he can’t
“First of all. This baby is fitted with Starktech security, biometric scanners that can read a 3D object
Steve dutifully adds a spoon of marshmallows into his cup. They’re not quite as fluffy as he remembers them being, like little plastic pellets, in fact makes
“Not him! He’s like fifty!” Clint yells at fifteenth Alpha to show up on the screen.
“If you’re going to ask, just get it over with.” Clint grumps, wriggling in Steve’s arms in some discomfort.
“I’m fine.” Steve insists. Quickly changing the topic, he gives Tony a playful smile. “So, I’m not for sharing?”
Andrew doesn’t even look at him when he leaves, neither does Ed, but Frank’s gaze follows him all the way down three blocks.
It had too damn lucky that Tony had survived at all, and he think that might haunt him for the rest of his life.
They sit in Tony’s tub, big enough for six people which means it’s roomy enough for two, but Tony curls close to Stevos, and the god utters no complaints when Tony rests his body over his.
“This is normal, get used to it.” Brock barks out a laugh at Steve’s confusion.
Clint taught him how to use the ATM machine (his pin had been one-two-three-four which Clint made fun of him about), and he’d been withdrawing money from the machine since. Food and lodgings were the prime expenses of their trip, but Clint had assured him that there was no way he’d use up all the money Tony had lent him even if they did eat at five-star restaurants (???) and stay at swanky hotels.
He knows a lost cause when he sees one, stubbornness a mile wide that shouldn’t make him smile, hands over the shield anyway even while the response was less than pleasant.
JARVIS had been deactivated in his room during heat, a matter of privacy, but now that it was over, Tony had reactivated him. It was still a better convenience to have the AI help him without bothering Tony.
of what was happening. He wanted a cock in him (Tony’s cock preferably) and he wasn’t getting any. Tony chuckles at him, a flare of irritation alongside the lust he felt as he shot Tony a glare.
“Oh, of course.” Stevos exclaims, but Tony can see that adorable little blush darkening the god’s pale skin. He wants nothing more than to see if that blush goes all the way down if it weren’t for his injuries.
In Stevos’s arms, he feels precious.
“Time?”
She’s all grace and poise, deadly in her attacks, very few movements wasted that it makes him feel all the more conscious of his own stances.
So even while he gets in bed, he already knows that it will be a while before he can actually fall asleep like this.
“Unless you’re on birth control?”
Steve cums with a jolt, splattering semen all over the sheets and clamping down hard on the Alpha’s cock.
At least tomorrow, they can have some bread for breakfast. Good coffee was too expensive these days, but maybe he could scrounge up some cracked beans if he’s persistent enough. And while he was at it, potatoes before they put them on display at the market.
Another Omega within a Heating Omegas vicinity wasn’t a good practice. Normally, a Heating Omega was docile enough to a group of Alphas, but with another Omega it was different altogether. The intruding Omega could be seen as a threat to the Heating Omega, an encroaching presence trying to steal good mates from them.
Steve doesn’t like it, not one bit, but he realizes that Tony speak with experience. It doesn’t mean he won’t argue with the next person to think badly of Tony, however.
He peers at Phil, a frown still on his lips at this revelation.
“I thought you’d like it if we started your Heat with something old-fashioned.” For the first time, Steve detects nervousness in the Alpha’s voice. “If you’re not comfortable then-”
“Alright. Nervous?” Tony rolls his shoulders and sets aside his gear. He’s in full engineering mode in the lab. There was none of the pristine businessman that made it so often in magazine covers. This Tony Stark was a creator, covered head to toe with sweat and grease because he wasn’t afraid of getting dirty. This Tony Stark was a visionary, who hammered away at something until he could build or break it. It makes Steve’s heart flutter when he sees him like this.
"Orphaned at the age of six and taken in by Magdalene's Home for lost boy."
“How far off are you?” Very polite.
leaving you in the mansion,
“Come on, boys. Hustle.” Comes her voice on the comm units. “No falling asleep on the job.”
“When was the last time he was like this?”
“My cameras, Captain.”
Steve swallows, stays rooted to his chair as Tony approaches him. He keeps still as the Alpha rearranges their seats so that they are face to face.
“You ain’t my Alpha, Buck. Can’t tell me what to do.” Steve says, still stubborn.
"I don't like hospitals either." Steve mutters, he leans forward, half-draped on Tony's bed, making sure not to put his full weight on Tony's side but wanting the comfort of being close to the Alpha all the same.
“You still haven’t answered my question.” Tone serious, Steve leans closer, as much as he dares. “Are you okay, Tony?”
He needs to stop the spread, shut down everything and build from the ground up. Reassess all his employees until he’s sure that Obadiah’s poison is completely flushed out. The board of directors, he had to hold a board meeting as soon as possible. Now that Obadiah was dead, they would need to release a statement about the attack. The Ironman would have to be explained. Gods, there was so much to do, and he has to do it all alone, he can’t let anyone else touch this. He needs to-
“I’ll leave you two to get to know each other. Be nice to Steven, please George? Show him around tomorrow after breakfast, and introduce him to the other boys.”
“He’s very well-tempered, it comes with age, he’d make a very good companion for children and seniors.” Steve overhears her as he walks closer.
“No, okay, the shank is good.” Steve says thinking, making his way to the refrigerator. Perfectly organized with, Steve assumes, all the food that Tony could eat. It’s no difficulty at all to get all the ingredients he needs.
“Oh god, y-yes please, faster please, please.”
“Sounds pretty old-fashioned.”
“They’ve both been grounded from active duty until Black Widow deems you mission ready. Until then, they have got nothing better to do than to look after you. Are we clear?”
He remembers it, with bruises down his side and thighs, but a bag full of food in his hand, enough for a couple of days if they froze some of it out on the porch. Setting the table and waiting for Bucky to get back, greeting him by the table with their portions set, a candle he’d dug around for and stuck to the table.
Tony could imagine that, a younger Stevos, running around, determined and stubborn, defiant even if he were smaller. He smiles at that and prods on. “Did you ever go on that quest?”
“Coulda skinned a cat and sold it off to a dog if he tried.” Steve grins at that. “But he meant well most of the time, enthusiastic at best. So one night, when me and the Commandos get invited to a fancy party, full of important officers and swells, the kind that goes on and on while Alphas with the biggest egos butt heads to see who’s got the longer stick.”
And then burst out into a loud clamor.
“Okay, and the contract...?” They'd asked some... peculiar details already, he just didn't know how much more preference they needed.
why I’m not moving. I don’t want them to ask about
Steve’s blood runs cold. Indignation, first and foremost, at what Justin had just said. Did they all think that? He was reduced to be an Omega for hire? To tote around and show off for the crowd?
’ But eventually finishes up his apple in silence and throws the core into the trash.
Tony points the bottle as a
“It was… Kind of like that. I had orders, except the orders were in my brain. Couldn’t get em out, it was like watching everything through my own eyes, I couldn’t stop myself, the thought didn’t even come up.” Clint worries the hem of his shirt.
Sensing his torment, Tony prods him on the shoulder. “Would you like to see the Ironman?”
Tony digs his fingers into Stevos’s hip, uncaring if the armor causes the god bruises. He’s so much more desperate to feel something real and solid, someone to blame for the sickness. Stevos is the perfect punching bag.
It’s often that he asks himself, why? Why did all this people choose to carry his symbol in the most mundane things possible? Coffee mugs and the like, seemed pointless in the grand scheme of things.
It finds me, so I have to deal with that problem, even if it means flirting with death.”
It’s his first public outburst since coming back from Afghanistan.
“Why would people do that?” The ride back their little apartment that has served as their base of operations is quiet, Steve hunched over where he sits in the back row, gut still churning from the scent and smells.
“Too stupid too.” But he can sense her bitterness. “I need to have a chat with Loki, see you later, Captain.”
“Not meaning to pry but actually prying but why are you dressed like this?” Tony touches the material of Stevos’s clothes. They looked oddly militaristic, and definitely not what Tony would think a god would normally wear. It feels strange, like a mix of soft cloth and durable leather, cool to the touch but sturdy.
“Oh Anthony, that is good.” Stevos moans, breathless as Tony sucks his cock, his hand petting the top of Tony’s head in enthusiasm. He’d just found his rhythm, bobbing up and down Stevos’s length when he’s pulled off.
someone?”
. He looks back at Tony with a bewildered look, and Tony is grinning his mouth off.
“I can smell it, your orientation.”
Controlling the shakes, Steve undoes his own shirt, placing it neatly over a chair, and does the same with his pants and underwear. He holds his breath as he joins Tony on the bed.
“Likewise, Captain Rogers.”
“Hey, the kid said to leave him alone.”
“Wow. Okay. I should probably forge papers more often if that’s what I’d get in return.”
Deep breaths. Don’t try to talk, just close your eyes and relax. I’m right here, Tony. You don’t gotta worry.”
“Thank you, Sir, it means a lot to have them with me.”
It’s somewhere to start. “Howard made that shield for me.”
“What happened to him?”
“Q-Quit it, J-James. Leave m-me alone.”
to check up on me than those iffy doctors who’ll probably stick something cold and impersonal up my ass for whatever reason. Since you suggested it, I expect you to take full responsibility, and make sure I am in one hundred percent working order.”
“Well, he passed you see. Peacefully. And while most of his belongings had been attended to by his will, his Omega had been left out of it. The good professor had no heirs, and thus none to lay claim to the Omega.” Jasper frowns, but then perks up. “It just so happened that our wonderful host had picked him up, paid his dues, and here he is. Lucky you.”
Clint stares at him, almost looking affronted.
Michael returns the phone, almost sadly, to him after putting his number. Steve makes a note to take better care of it.
“Approximately ten minutes.”
“What does a married pair smell like?” It’s probably a distraction, one that Steve goes on with willingly.
Honestly, Tony didn’t mind all the extra touches. “No. Well. No, no, no.” Tony says, in a burst of actual emotion. “You never came to visit!”
It quickly becomes a pattern.
Tony cries, Stevos holding him tight while he sobs uncontrollably over the god’s shoulder. “You deserve me more than I deserve you.” The god whispers, though Tony can’t make sense of it. His head hurts and he’s too tired to worry about it. “You are wonderful in all the things you do.” Stevos still feels good around him despite the lie, the fingers running along his back helps ground him.
a secretive nation and no actual commentary was given, but maybe,
“We do have beef shank, rib eye, ground beef and a cut of wagyu. Though I must warn you that steak has been putting Sir in a sour mood. ”
"Uh."
Steve, for the life of him, spaced off somewhere between chips and salt, but he understand that programming is difficult, enough. “So… You’re learning a new language, but then it’s all commands that the computer has to follow.” Gosh, he’s thankful that JARVIS seems to understand English just fine, he’s not quite sure how’d he be able to talk to him otherwise.
Thankfully Tony is a good enough distraction, as he walks up to Steve in his swanky outfit, but he keeps an eye on Clint, just in case.
“You must see him for yourself.” The curator pools down the thick veil.
He knows that Tony’s joking, but it’s a sweet thought. Even if he can handle himself just fine.
There’s a soft click, followed by silence and then- “Hi, Steve.” It comes soft and sleep-drowned, raspy and an octave lower than usual, like Tony had just woken up and eavesdropped on him and JARVIS. “Are you colluding with my robot butler?”
The sky is well dark by the time he finishes. Mentally exhausted, he closes the laptop. Finally done with every gory detail. With a sigh, he tucks the laptop away.
He needs to destroy those weapons, wipe them off the face of the earth so that no one can abuse them ever again. But he can’t do that while he’s dead, or half-buried in sand, or whatever miserable existence they might deem him worthy of.
“And in exchange? Why tell me all this now? What was that Patron thing that the green guy talked about?”
Steve shakes his head. “M-My mo-om’ll a-adopt me b-back.” He’s not sure how it works, but his mom is much smarter than him, so he’s not worried. “Y-You?”
His Alpha is brutal, a bruising grip on his hips keeps him where he is, accepting the man’s dick as he is penetrated over and over again. There’s slick and cum
“That doesn’t mean you ought to give it your best effort.” Stevos sighs, shakes his head, stands up. Tony nearly chases after his warmth, and it’s only through sheer will power that he stays rooted to the bed, fist clenched at his side.
In bold letters he’s met with the name ‘
“Mhmm. I’ll think about it.”
strange.
“What troubles you, Anthony?” Stevos asks, in that tone that Tony both loves and hates. Filled with a softness that places him on edge, and yet the god has done nothing to make him distrust him. Too many people have tried to take advantage of him, figures that the one person (god) that might not have any hidden motives could make Tony’s senses go haywire.
“Maybe it would be better if you let Agent Coulson handle this. I’m sure he wouldn’t object.” She finishes coolly.
“I’d be happy to take suggestions.” An innocent smile on his lips while he strokes Tony’s dick in slow measure, enjoys the flex and jump of it that thrills his senses. He’s not quite sure, but it’s like Tony’s scent gone darker. Like stone left for days in the rain, earth at a constant grind on the surface, metal heated in a forge, a freedom he can feel as surely as he can taste on his lips.
is taken care of. I did promise a kiss at your door.”
“Well, my name is James.” Comes the introduction, Steve doesn’t even hide the frown.
“There now Steven, you’re going to fit fine here, the other boys will be happy to have a new friend.” She says, taking his hand as she leads him to the third floor. He drags his bag of things along with him.
“I don’t think there’s much helping it, Sir.”
“Tony?” He voices his concern, trying to see what had happened.
“I’ll hand over the slide to Agent Romanoff once I’ve compiled them.”
Steve knows that, if he were to try to break free from Tony's hold, he would be let go without another word. In the dim light of his room, there's a sorrow he can see in Tony's eyes, a mixture of sad understanding and concern. The hand on his chest isn't so much a warning, as it was there to remind Steve that he wasn't alone.
Steve gathers a steadying breath, shudders through the last of the tears and finishes his bath.
“So I’m talkative now? Way to make a guy feel better about himself.”
“I think this should be our last training session.” Natasha says while they’re doing their post-workout stretches.
He nearly startles when Brock pushes himself up, and heads for the coffee maker. “Boss should nearly be up, better to make his coffee now before he bitches about it. C’mere, I’ll show ya.”
A nasty grin on his face, James shoves him particularly hard, enough to make him stumble. “Yer mama ain’t here to help you, baby Rogers.” He sneers, looming over Steve as he corals him to a corner.
Heat garbles everything else. Too hot, too cold, blurred yet sharply in focus when he wants it. There’s biting and scratching, Steve takes pleasure in making the Alpha growl, playful and manic in the way that he does during his heats, nips and claws at the Alpha as his cock strains between their bodies, the Alpha’s cock pounding inside of his, the sweet drag of friction that brings him closer and closer to the edge.
Plus the man is nonplussed about handing him different weaponry to try.
And Stevos moans so prettily, like a whore who’s never had cock, opening wide for him and giving him everything like a promised lover, panting for him. Even Stevos’s back is a sight to behold, firmly laid with muscle, the dip of his spine that only makes his ass seem more plump. That incredible waist that Tony latches on for dear life, tugging him onto his cock until Tony develops a punishing pace, pounding right into Stevos until he sees his rim, puffy and agitated.
“Okay.”
It seems an innocuous enough question, and it doesn’t sound like he’s in any kind of trouble.
“Figures that SHIELD would give you something as outdated as you.”
It’s a moment of pause from Steve.
##########
Clint laughs, apparently unable to hold it in anymore.
Tony gives him a considering look, and for a while there’s just silence between them where Steve wonders if he suggested the wrong thing. And then Tony growls, but places a hand on Steve back in defeat.
Tony actually blinks at him, almost aghast.
“Hmm, but it’s no fun if you don't take a guess.” Tony actually pouts at him but continues anyway. “It’s from Wakanda, a relatively small nation but technologically advanced in their ways. It’s often contemplated that Wakanda was one of the first nations to educate their population equally, regardless of orientation, and they were better off for it. Imagine that? Alphas, Betas and Omega receiving the same education as early as the eighteen hundreds?”
“What’s mine?” He ventures, wonders if scents could change. Steve bares his neck, shuffles around so that Clint can reach with ease.
He doesn’t look up at first, finishing a total for a couple who were going through their first child. Steve’s smile is ready and he hands over the receipt, when he catches the eye of the man behind the pair and he freezes.
“Not really?”
Taking pity on him, Stevos strokes him with his hand, smearing pre-cum from the head to ease the friction. It’s a little bit too much, Tony strung too tight, he needs to come so bad, if only Stevos would quit teasing him.
Howard nods. “Obie and I will head off first. Stay behind and take care of your Omega.” And then Howard actually smiles at him, and nudges Obie. “A Stark through and through, eh?”
“I’m not going to do anything to the Alphas, Hawkeye.” He feels the need to say, because the Agent smells nervous and it wouldn't hurt to say so.
On top of him, pinning him to the bed with his entire body, Tony sucks a heavy bruise on his shoulder, slows his thrust to a grind. It’s not the first mark that Tony has tried to instill, but the serum prevents any lasting damage, to the Alphas obvious dismay, but it doesn’t stop him from trying.
“Alright, alright. You
Tony thinks the blood loss might be getting to him, today’s been a weird day.
Tony chuckles. “Not exactly. Cara and Marlow’s case is special, not every Alpha desires an Omega, some of us pair off with Betas just fine, fully content. Triads are rare, and they’re not always an Alpha, Beta and Omega, there are hardly any, but they do exist. It’s still a matter of preference. In this day and age, you get to choose what you like. For people like Cara and Marlow, it means they can take their pick of the litter.”
“Did you actually do it?” Tony prods his arm, something knowing in his look though he says nothing else. “Kiss dad?”
The silence between them in chilling, and it takes Tony rushing back in with the papers (“I didn’t lose them, they were just
Natasha and Clint were probably doing their own reports too. A short summary, additive to what they’d already submitted beforehand, about how the mission ended. It takes him a while to get in the correct mindset of work, biting down the rejection, but he does, focusing on the grim details of the Omega smuggling bust.
It’s his second mission in SHIELD, barely a month since his and Clint’s vacation ended, and six months since New York.
A blush blooms on Steve's cheeks, he hunches into his seat and looks pointedly at the table instead, focusing on a crumb that’s fallen off the plate. Tony nods vaguely in Brock’s direction.
. I’m not sure I’d come back here again if I knew service was this dull.”
“I miss you too.” Steve mutters back, heart clenching.
Steve did say that he wanted the time to think about it first, to look into it further, even if he was too far gone on Tony to begin with. There was always the chance that it was lust, Tony’s body had been the first he’d been in contact with since awakening, it made sense that he would want pleasure from a familiar person. Or worst yet, biology. Since Tony was a compatible High-level Alpha, it would make sense that his own Omega instincts would seek him out.
He doesn’t know why it hits him just now, because he should have known ever since he’d step foot in the Stark premises, but it does. He knows, really
“Lighter than I expected. Definitely gives off more of
“Wha?”
Natasha’s contribution is vodka. While Steve isn’t sure he can get drunk on it, and even though Steve tells Natasha as much, she gets a gleam in her eyes that he isn’t sure how to read.
the first test. I’ve run the numbers and power required, trajectory calculations and magnetic pull experiments but this was the first I’ve done an actual test.”
It goes on for three days, and it would have gone on for longer. But Steve comes down hard with a bout of pneumonia. Bucky finds him passed out on the floor when he comes back from his shift, the table half-set for a meal. Steve’s not sure how the day goes, he remembers it all vaguely. Bucky practically carrying him into bed, covering him with blankets until he can barely move. His face feels too hot, his body too cold and his throat too dry. Every time he can’t hold back a cough, Bucky’s there pushing a glass of water to his lips, murmuring blurred words of encouragement. Sometimes Steve can keep the water down, and sometimes he coughs it right back out.
“Every damn thought was how to carry out orders. I knew exactly how to do it too, because I wanted to do it myself. Grab some shit. Done. Get some info. Done. Disable the helicarrier. Knew exactly how to do it.”
“I’ll go first.” Even Ed’s voice seem a little strained, belt buckle jangling loose as he takes off his pants.
“M’sorry. Never got ‘ta say it to Ma. Wanted to make sure you don’t have to wonder what I’d say to you when I’m on my last legs.”
##########
He can feel his ass give away, pried open by his own fingers, dripping with slick. A fourth finger is added but it still isn’t enough, the hunger in his body barely quenched as he stuffs himself with his fingers over and over again. His body won’t be so easily tricked, the lack of an Alpha has his mind even more desperate.
It's Tony. Of course it, God, who else would it be, his mind supplies uselessly. By his messy hair and greasy clothes, it's easy to guess where Tony had just rushed from.
” Tony clarifies, tone growing harder. Steve whimpers and Tony places a soothing hand on his hair.
“I go by many names, most lost to time.” Even his voice is perfect, a rich baritone. After so many months of listening to broken english, the sound of his American accent is like music to Tony’s ears. “But I was last known as Stevos, the minor god of courage and compassion.”
of titanium boots to cement fills the rest of the gap. “We kicked some robot
Steve sucks in a breath. “Did Fury-?”
Steve carefully pushes it just into Tony’s fingers. The Alpha makes an ungodly sound at the first sip, before he collapses into the chair and sighs, seemingly drowning himself in the coffee.
Tony nods, frown still in place, but he didn’t look unhappy. “I’ll talk to Fury about the contract. He

“Grab that motherboard for me.” Tony mutters, motioning behind him.
Steve has a choice.
“You must think I’m-”
“Agreed.” Natasha smirks. “I’d like to nominate Jaws for the list.”
according to their tailor.
“I’m open to suggestions.” Even as Tony tries for casual, Steve twists his thumbs on the band of Tony’s loose pants and does little more than play with the fabric.
top of the line phone for devs and techs. They say Tony Stark personally oversaw all the parts and codes for the OS before it was approved, and!!! Oh god. I’m geeking out. Sorry. Tech is like, my passion.” Michael turns an impressive shade of pink, returning the phone to Steve as he keeps his hands to himself.
Tony leaves him there, muttering just under his breath, unheard if it were not for the serum.
At this point, Steve grits his teeth, fights the imperative to cry, but his eyes are already blurry and his face heating up.
“Steve Rogers.”
Thing is. He knows he can’t have Tony Stark, no matter how much he might want him, he can’t. He sees him and Pepper on the news all the time, a 'Power Couple’ as one news article so proclaims. And they are, they’re gorgeous together, Steve would have to be both blind and deaf not to know it.
He hates it here, and he hates bullies.
“Not trying to. Just wanted to say I was sorry. What I did was wrong. And I’d do a lot more to make it right by you if you’d let me.” Frank says. Before Steve can protest, Frank brings out a small plain white box. “We didn’t give you this for starters. As much as my uncle wants to believe he’s a straight-edge traditional Alpha.”
“I-Is it why D-Dad left? D-Does he not want m-me? D-Don’t y-y-y-ou w-want m-m-m-me any-m-more, M-Mama?”
Steve sighs.
“Holy shit. Dad never mentioned this.”
“Ever heard of anything else the military had that was made of vibranium?”
“Uh, sure.”
Steve’s jaw falls open, certainly not what he’d been expecting.
Steve waits a beat. “I can smell it on you, you know.” He breaches the topic.
Tony doesn’t say much after that, Steve doesn’t really expects him to, but he doesn’t speak to Steve after either. They stare at each other, mere feet apart but separated by the nightmares of their past, until Steve moves forward.
“Can’t help it, can he? With what he is, makes sense cos you’re just about the most distressing Omega ever to walk the streets’a Brooklyn. Has his work cut out for him.”
“You okay?”
“I mean, yeah
That makes him suck a breath, shift in his befire ultimately stands, away from Steve and into their little bathroom. Steve hears the tap open, drips of water pouring out, Bucky splashing his face with it.
“Oh sweetie, please don’t cry.” His mom hushes, cupping his cheeks. Steve breaks free from the hands and he buries his face in his Ma’s blouse.
They insist, even when they're being held against the vans to zip tie their arms. Protest to being
“Oh, I liked it very much. It’s quite interesting!” Tony smiles. “To think, there's a drug that can induce an Omega’s heat like that out in the market.” He says, keeps walking, nudging Steve towards the doors.
He knows a thing or two about feeling trapped, mentally and physically, and Clint looked like he was ready to jump off buildings if it meant he could get the peace he was looking for. And wasn’t it a bit ironic that Clint would go to
There's a car waiting for him, without a driver which Steve takes as a curious sign. He gets into the driver seat, and no sooner than he buckles his seat belt does JARVIS's cool voice fill the car. “If you don't mind, Captain. I'll handle the steering wheel for the drive.” And with that, the car purrs alive and they rumble off.
Tony can’t seem to get enough, his hand twisted in Steve’s hair, hard and stinging. It makes Steve’s hole slick where he’s knelt under Tony.
Who, by the looks of it, ignores all warnings. Only seems to move even closer. “C’mon, Sugar. You’re not
“I never claim to know all. Only that certain events are made known to me, as your god.” He adds at the end, as if Tony could ever forget.
He plucks up his courage, no point in backing down now, grabs his coat and heads out into the night.
. Closes on Tuesday :)
“Finally. Thanks, Romanov.”
Tony takes a look at the phone, brow raised.
“I’m getting real tired of that.” Tony huffs, annoyed. It was almost like his illness was an afterthought to the god, he didn’t even look worried.
He falls asleep that way, with Tony’s arm curled over him, listening to the steady beat that lulls him into slumber.
Or maybe it was just Tony, who looked at him with such open concern, that Steve can’t help but wonder how he could deserve such attention. He knows where it comes from. Hero worship, he’s had that much when little kids came up to him, looking up to him, asking for his autograph. The men were a little more skeptical, but he’d had a couple of fellas who bought him a drink and they’d talk through the night whenever he was in town, off from a mission, trying to shake away the smell of blood and gunpowder. The war was upon them, there wasn’t much for celebration, except for small victories, and they took that sense of triumph as much as they could.
’ could still be a symbol to be used. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if they had footage of his awakening.
Clint hugs himself, forehead pressed to Steve’s front, nails digging into his biceps until Steve can smell the first tang of blood.
Tony smirks. “Well, of course it is. I built it.” There’s that proud undertone. “And this is just Mark 4, wait until I’ve finished Mark 6.”
“It’s not- I can’t-”
The stiff nod is answer enough, but Clint goes on. “Me and my brother. All we had was each other, y’know? I figured that, if I could feed us both, it’d be better than sitting around with our thumbs up our asses.” Is an attempt at lightening the mood, but Steve knows better. Knows what it feels like to be desperate and hungry, knows what it is to hand over a piece of dignity in exchange for warmth and food. Even when Bucky was begging him not to. ’
Hope ya'll like it. Thanks for the kudos and comments, and don't worry about the donation stuff, it's only for whoever is interestes but you can still find it
“There you go, handsome. Easy now.” Tony whispers when they break apart, allowing Steve precious air at last.
“You don’t have to-”
“You like it then?”
“I know, but it wouldn’t be the right thing to do.”
Stevos doesn’t greet him at the door, in fact, Tony has high hopes that the god has plain fucked off because of Tony’s shit, if it meant he wouldn’t have to face the music.
“Soooo, if I think of you naked…”
Tony nods enthusiastically, continues fiddling with his hologram, twists and manipulates little pieces. “Exactly. Except it’s grammar with logic. Like. Imagine trying to explain something to someone in English, give them a task and then logical checks so that they do their jobs in a very specific way. Say, getting your groceries. You want them to get you chips. For the sake of data entry let’s say… Doritos, nacho cheese flavor, but only if they come in the biggest bag, and they aren’t over five bucks. If those aren’t available, then any cheese flavored chips will do, so long as the bag exceeds thirty grams, but then only has five grams of salt per serving. Now, explain all that in a Chinese or something, different grammatical rules, different terms. That’s basically how programming works. You’re speaking the computer’s language, and it can get insanely frustrating when you have to learn all kinds of different languages just to get something working.” Tony says all this while minor hand gestures, mostly still focused on his desk.
And it’s to no surprise that he meets face to face with an agent, albeit someone he’s never met before.
Tony looks at him all smug, as if trying to dare him to fault his logic. Which Steve already doubted. He isn’t exactly medically trained, which is an issue he wants to rectify, what he knows is born from experience, from patching himself up or his fellow soldiers.
And then, one of them rounds the corners and spots him, gun held up and pointed at Tony. The first few shots ricochet off the suit’s metal chest, but one bullet lodges itself in Tony’s leg.
“Very well Captain Rogers.”
The shutters slowly fall down, covering the view.
Tony clicks his tongue impatiently, twirling the device and does a flick. The hologram breaks apart into smaller holograms, smaller gears and plates which Tony prods around. “Made him in highschool, modified him in college. He was my attempt at a rubber ducky solution.”
. I’d hate him if I didn’t know that it’s nothing personal.” She sighs.
Steve’s shoulders drop, he hadn’t noticed he’d had them so stiff before, sighing as places his empty cup on the table, eyes falling to his hands. “If this is just. Pity.” He hates that word too. “Then I can’t accept it. I can get by fine on my own. You don’t have to be nice to me just because SHIELD thinks I’m broken.” It’s almost like his asthma all over again, stuttered breaths as he tries to calm himself enough to take in air. It’s all in his head, his lungs are fine, he knows, but he struggles all the same.
Steve remembers that, one of the first thing he’d asked JARVIS. The answer had been sketchy at best, since Steve technically didn’t exist, had nothing to verify that he was an American citizen, no identifying numbers, no mailing address, not even a P.O. Box to his name.
words of annoyance and assertion, he had the Beta shaking in his palm. No doubt the man had been quaking in his leather shoes when Tony mentioned never coming back.
After a big lunch (it was embarrassing to see how much he had to eat now but if there was anything he learned during the first few weeks of waking, it was that America had a
Scenting was a small ceremony, performed by the Alpha and Omega if a contract constitutes it. Optional at best, as there were no definite findings that a successful Scenting meant that the Alpha or Omega got along, though research has shown that it had a high percentile of success if done properly.
Steve shrugs. “Sure, I mean, I want to meet him. I know the circumstances aren’t the most pleasant. If we’re not compatible, then I don’t have to do anything with him, right?” The details were vague at best, someone still had to explain what Scenting was.
commentary from Clint and Natasha, they all stare at him with unseeing eyes. Steve would have preferred to meet any
“Of course not. Sir.” The Beta almost stammers.
“Jarvis, open up my will.”
“Don’t want to call her yourself?”
“Call if you run into any problem.”
Steve chokes on his drink.
Steve snatches glances of him when he can, but embarrassment prevents him from speaking. He should apologize, he knows that, but he doesn’t know where to start. From the start, for being his date to begin with? Justin’s words echo dully in his mind, the whispers and yells, the pressure on his knee.
Only Tony could react to that with another grimace and then a sensual grind that has Steve’s cock very interested where it’s nestled against Tony’s ass.
“Andrew picked it out for you.” Frank starts when Steve says nothing. “He was supposed to give it t'you after the Heat.”
Tony has the power to be both charming and annoying. It’s easy for Steve to trust him, because he treats him pointed frankness that beats even Clint’s. The cold-hearted weapon maker that the internet so warns him against just isn’t there, instead he sees the very human figure that Tony is. He can almost forget that Tony’s an Alpha, were it not for himself The one who laughs at Steve when he eyes go wide at every new thing he’s handed. That’s one more thing, Tony likes handing him thing, anything he wants Steve to try.
“Steve-”
“Nine hundred sharp.”
“Good morning, how we doing today?” Brock says, grinning.
Three hours into the flight, Steve feels the first vestiges of restlessness and walks around to inspect the plane.
“You aren’t?”
“Find out their secret, and then they’re harmless to you.” She tells him.

It’s confusion on Stevos’s face, and then hesitation but he nods all the same. Gone is the muscular toned god, in a blink of the eye, a familiar form appears. Smaller, paler and sharp cheekbones, Stevos gives him a defiant look.
“He’d also make a good companion for a new couple, someone to brighten the home.” The lady chimes in, all smiles.
Even with the pictures and
“She’s a beaut, bet she runs great on open road.”
He’d shaken them off and doubled back to Natasha.
After a few short moments, Steve shyly embraces Tony, enjoys the way Tony sidles up to him, pressing his nose to Steve’s palm, and kisses his fingers. It sends a tingle all the way down to his groin, an Alpha acting submissively for him.
The lab is a marvel, nothing like what Howard had had back in the day. It had been more like a garage, a mess of parts they’d pilfered from the enemy and new or abandoned projects lay cluttered where they could be. This was a place of creation, each item had it’s place (though he could see a small pile in the corner), with names Steve couldn’t possible know and carefully welded metal and gadget and gizmos that worked without inspection.
“I don’t deserve you.” He chokes out, knees giving way as he falls to the floor in his anguish.
here and draw.” He sees Bucky let out a sigh, continues on, emboldened. “No ones gonna be looking at our pictures if a war’s going on. I’m not gonna let us both go hungry, not if I can do something about it. I can carry my own weight around here, Buck. Ain’t fair when you’re doing all the work for us.”
“Uploading, sir. Estimated completion in fifty three minutes and five seconds.”
Right, as if he needed another reminder.
Yinsen is dead, his body left in the dark as Tony fights his way out of the cave.
“As humble as ever, sir.”
“That part, I know.” Steve trails along, just a hint curious, though he knows that Tony can’t help but show off and all will be explained, with or without his intervention. “First six months of enlistment, I was touring throughout the country, given a script and told to stick to it.” He frowns. He hadn’t hated his time with the gals. Truth be told, he’d gotten used to it to a point, he nearly started believing that the stage was his place in the war effort.
“Yeah okay, minor god, uh. Thank you?”
) bike was here in one piece.
Clint makes a disgusted sound, scent going bitter that Steve flinches from it.
Whining, Steve pouts on Tony’s chest. That seemed stupidly unfair, though his inner Omega flared at the thought of being a better Omega than others.
“Lots of fun, Brock.”
, anything but innocent on his desk. No doubt Tony’s doing, he pushes himself up to his elbows, eyes huge as he takes the dildo in hand.
##########
“Steve.” He answers back, because it’s what he’s been saying the entire time.
I'd been meaning to put out two chapters on my return, but some things just don't go according to plan haha.
“Rubberducky?”
Steve traces a hand over the bike. It looks pristine, clean and taken care of, definitely not how he had left it. And certainly those bullies wouldn’t have bothered to keep her in tip top shape.
“I haven’t got any plans tonight.”
Steve leaves tomorrow. He knows that, he dreads it, and somehow coming back home (home?) brings that realization to the front of his mind.
that Tony won’t take advantage of what he knows, and it feels dangerous. And exciting.
Not wanting to lose his nerve, he’s relieved to find the shower is something he recognizes, although he struggles with the temperature a moment, but finally setting to a cold shower once he’s gotten the hang of it. He scrubs with single-mindedness, doesn’t let the slick and strange Heat get to him. He finds that if he focuses strongly enough, he can almost block it out.
Instinctively, he runs a hand over the man’s hair, placating, comforting, the stink of Clint’s distress like a haze over them. Clint doesn’t utter another sound, but Steve can feel the wetness on his chest, where Clint hides, seeping onto his shirt.
He crawls away like he’s been burned, suddenly taking the far end of the bed with wary eyes still stuck on Tony. There's a collar around his neck, dark leather of some kind, clipped to a chain that's shackled to the bed.
“STRIKE?”
“But it wasn’t like this.
“You don’t have to defend my honor.”
There’s no one with him on the plane, no one had met him on the runway. Once he had seated himself, the doors closed, the engines started and off they flew. Better this way, he thinks, the solitude appreciated as he devoured the news.
“This is Steven, he will be your new roommate from now on. I’m sure the both of you will get along well.” She nudges Steve forward. “Go on, dear, no need to be shy.”
“No, yes, Anthony Stark, Alpha.” Steve supplies with shuddery breath. He's still cold, clammy despite the sheets. Panic still fills his brain, an urgency to get warm and away taking utmost precedence. “I’m fine. Fine. I want-” Steve starts, forcing his limbs to move, wrestling against the sheets. “I need to-”
"I'll get better." Tony says with certainty. "Which leads to the second thing I wanted to talk about. Would you like to go to South Korea with me?"
Steve’s not entirely convinced, eyeing the marshmallows even as Tony fills his cup with hot chocolate. The little marshmallows foam with the heat, rising with the drink until they coat the top perfectly, tiny lumps above the chocolate.
"Oh." Steve blinks. That was… Huge. He knew that the reactor was something that Tony was proud of, a big shiny beacon, but he also knew it demanded a lot of attention, and medically there were a whole slew of complications that came with the maintenance of it. Not to mention the effect it had on Tony's body everyday.
He prowls, follows the sure scent of Omega in the air.
Steve practically melts, grasping at Bucky’s side to hold him, even through three layers of winter wear he can feel the hard form of Bucky’s body, eyes squeezed shut for fear of what he might see. Bucky soothes him through it, fingers through his hair, a hand cupped to his cheek, doing anything to keep him from pulling away from him. It’s nothing like the kiss from when they were kids, huddled in bed and soft exploratory kisses that held little weight than childish love for one another. Acceptance and question, fear and loved mixed together. Not quite as pure, but something else entirely.
"Wasn't any trouble." Steve smiles, just happy that Tony was talking to him.
“I was worried for him, it was rude of me to just barge in like that.”
As the week would go on, the urges of Heat would taper off towards his last wave, where he would be most desperate. It was still days away. Surprisingly, Steve didn’t feel particularly worried, trusting that Tony would see him through. The Alpha had been nothing but
Why would any Alpha or Beta want a sickly Omega? A burden. He’d be no good for raising children, not when the housework would pile up while he lay sick in bed.
“But I’m not gay?” Steve ponders, not getting the joke.
“Anthony.” Ah, there it is. That tone of disapproval.
Jasper only nods, all the patience in the world on his face and instead gives the envelope to Steve, who still looks slightly dazed from the drug, but accepts the envelope nonetheless. Tony is quick to usher them out and into his car. He has to help Steve into the passenger side, wary of how the sweet scent makes his legs wobble.
“Doesn’t that feel good?”
“Yeah. I thought I’d go sightseeing. Hit the dirt and see what I’ve been missing.”
“You would have to ask him yourself, sir.”
Tony scratches the back of his head, looking pinched. “Sure, the Starkphone isn’t cheap to begin with, better material than Apple for one thing. Collector’s value maybe, as the first phone we officially produced but.” Tony shakes his head, pushing the phone back towards Steve. “Keep it, I don’t know who you’re talking to but I gain absolutely nothing if you return it.”
Steve moves, tips his head down to capture Tony’s lips, who responds in kind. His arm’s fall awkwardly to his side, while Tony’s hands slide to his hips, keeping him there. Steve has a good three inches on Tony, so he towers over him quite a bit, but that’s not much of a factor when Tony kisses back.
“You’re looking at the very first prototype generator for the arc reactor. The first step into commercializing clean energy. Stark Tower was just a pet project, a hello world to the world about what my little baby can do.” Tony enthuses, patting the generator on it’s hood. “At least, she will be once I put her through her paces.”
He bites his lip, gathering himself for the right words to say.
“You’re very desirable, don’t get me wrong. But I don’t think you’re going to remember much of this in the morning, and frankly I want you to remember every moment when I do claim you because I’m going to put you down on your knees and make you beg me to claim you. It will be because you want it, not because you’ve been drugged to the gills with sex juice and-” The room thrums with intention, and Steve’s eyes can’t help but be drawn to the bed in the middle of it. Tony’s room. It must be. It’s well-kept and decorated.
He hadn’t realized how much he missed riding his bike until now.
Steve finds himself at his door, Tony trailing behind him.
“No.” Tony snarls, because if there’s anything left that is his, it’s the suit. He powers the leg thrusters and pushes Stevos against the wall, trapping the god’s wrists with his gauntlets, his suit’s plates no doubt digging into Stevos’s chest.
“Hey. You wanted a spectacle. By tomorrow, everyone’s going to know about my Omega.” Tony grins. And wasn’t that such a nice thought.
“Mine.” Steve admits. “Had to live up to the name ‘Captain America’ after all. And I figured that painting something up like that would draw a lot of attention. The more attention there was on me, the less they’d be on my guys.”
an Omega’s arousal, and outside of that Omegas were rarely knotted if it weren’t to make pups. An Omega wasn’t suppose to get wet if the Alpha didn’t want it, the only exception was for heat, the Omegas biological signal to look for a mate.
Tony’s pops out from what looks like a combination of an engine and a generator, screwdriver between his teeth and a wrench in his hands.
“You said you would lend me your strength.”
When Tony doesn’t react, not even a peep, Steve grumbles and nuzzles his head to Tony’s bicep, sniffing wildly at the man’s scent. There was no sharp tang, no anger or irritation, nor was there any bitterness that might have hinted dissatisfaction. Just Tony’s grounding scent, full of life, and calm.
He might have flirted back a little, and genuinely found Michael fun to talk to. By the end of it, Michael asks for his number and he gives it, typing it out on the Alpha’s phone before handing over his own.
Idol? Oh. Steve blushes. No wonder Phil had been so nice to him. “Never came up.”
Tony huffs, glaring at the door for a moment, before his gaze falls onto Steve. Steve can’t help but turn stiff, shoulders hunched as he waits for his verdict. He still isn’t sure what had just happened, it had felt like a whirlwind and a hurricane had a quick spat and then went their separate ways.
“Uhm?” Because Clint is actually glaring at him and there are tears in his eyes.
“Don’t.” Steve warns, stern in his gaze that puts Tony to silence. “Don’t belittle yourself. What you did was good and self-sacrificing, and you’re suffering for it.” He doesn’t say that Tony doesn’t have to. Good men suffer for the many.
The god never complains, no matter how long Tony might use his body as a pillow. To which Tony would use to his full advantage.
JARVIS: [01 OFFLINE]
“Thank you so much. I don’t know how to repay you.”
He brings up his gaze to look at Tony, so close, with his scent right there, warm brown eyes anchoring him on the spot.
Tony sucks him off, slow and languid, his mouth a furnace around his cock.
He’s not sure when, but he stops pretending that everything is fine.
It doesn’t explain why he just can’t come home with her, no matter how many times he promises that he won’t be any trouble.

##########
“Well. You should have been naked five minutes ago.”
##########
Tony speaks low, maybe not to frighten Steve, but his scent has definitely picked up, a bit more electrifying, a crackle in the wind that carries a daunting topic. Steve has a feeling that this was way more than just Howard, like Tony’s been trying to fight for this his entire life. The words aren’t lost to him, he understand that Tony’s under a lot of stress, but he just doesn’t know how to console him for something that seems to hound his every step.
She scribbles that down. “Anything you wanna add on your contract?”
Steve bounds over, careful not to step on anything, until he’s right over Tony. He’s holding wires in his other free hand, while he thrusts the wrench against a bolt to keep it in place.
The helicopter lands a few feet away, Rhodey disembarking and jogging towards him. Stevos sets him down on the sand and Tony excitedly hobbles towards his best friend.
He thought he was becoming used to the Present, a hope that had been allowed to grow in what he now realizes is his own ignorance. He hadn’t… Questioned anything. Accepted the information and thought he could trust that people knew what they were talking about.
Two weeks ago he would have smiled at anyone who would have asked that, tell them it wasn't really anything, just his confusion of the general prospect of the feature. The Psychiatrists had asked as much, and some things he had told them and some things he hadn't. He could tell almost immediately when they only did so to be polite, their eyes would glaze over or shift somewhere else in the room.
"There's a doctor I want to meet. Says she has tech that can help revolutionize medical achievements by leaps and bounds. And you know how I am with technological revolutionaries."
Phil smiles at him sympathetically.
He eyes them apprehensively. It had been easier when he was all alone, playing with his hands while he waited. Somehow, he ought to strike up a conversation, even if it’s something as simple as a ‘hello’ and ‘weather’s been terrible’, but he’s beaten to the punch.
him from bidding. He flips through the pamphlet, a picture of each Omega on it, with a short apt description. Their height and weight, heritage, blood type, origin, their personality, which Tony snorts at.
Stevos breaks the silence. “You could have died.”
“Fine, I’ll meet the General.”
“No problem.” The other blonde grunts, his scent still bitter. “We Omegas gotta stick together. If they tried to pull their Alpha-Omega traditionalist bullshit on me, I’d have a knife to her throat. I mean, Nat’s hot and all, but I’m no one’s fuck toy.”
Tony is still muttering as they leave the door, (about betrayal and treachery, if his super-hearing is to be believed) and Pepper mouths a quick ‘Thank you’ to him. He returns it with a two fingered salute.
have money.”
Yeah okay, maybe having a god around would just up his procrastination levels by a bit. Just a little bit. He needs to build a new arc reactor for one, and make backups in case anyone tried to pry his heart out again. The Ironman could use some improvements too. He had been severely undergunned during the fight with Obadiah, he needed more weapons that could incapacitate quickly and easily, but could still fit in the panels of the suit.
He blushes at that too.
Steve's mind pings, a scorching scent behind the words.
His papers come first though. He can’t afford to flunk. In the most technical sense. His scholarship is on the line, and he’ll be damned if that’s another thing for Howard to hover over his head. And as much as his classmates might bully him for taking on a scholarship despite his Father being literally richer than his entire family’s weight in Gold, the prestige and opportunity that comes with graduating with honors
“Tell me about him.” Tony says suddenly, an expectant look before he realizes what he’s said but there a stubbornness there anyway, not wanting to take it back.
Somehow Steve believes him, no matter how weakly he might cling to that tendril. He allows the sense of comfort, the lie he tells himself, to trust Tony enough to catch him when he falls. New desperation flows freely, a feeling he hasn’t let through ever since he’d woken up in this new world, overwhelming as it run through him. A new found
He does it again and again, keeps his jaw pliant, let’s the drool slip past his mouth and cover Tony’s cock to turn it slippery and wet, breathing through his nose even while Tony pets his face.
That gets Clint’s head turning, smell of surprise over the tang in the air, and there’s a rustle of sheets when he sits up. “Sure, I don’t mind.”
Justin Hammer is exactly the reason why he can’t just give them any shred of information, who he humiliates with the scrapped video of his test pilot basically snapping his spine in some shitty Ironman rip off.
“You’re not touching me.” The Omega snarls. “This is.” He huffs. “Bad. Very bad. They gave me. Something.” The Omega speaks like it takes all his concentration for his tongue to cooperate, his eyes unable to truly focus as they flit from Tony, the bed, the floor, to the windowless walls, to a table, chair and then snap back to Tony.
, that if he were to refuses, Tony would just back away and wish him goodnight.
With resignation, he fishes out his keys and tosses them over.
“Is that an order?” He asks, tone clipped.
“Not unless you want to be.” Tony answers quickly. “Otherwise, I will defend your honor and stave away these dastardly fiends.”
When he makes it down the lab, Tony has his welding gear on, still working on piece of metal that resembles a hand.
And now the urge is close to boiling, as he shuffles through his discarded things from earlier to give way to the itch. Pencil and pad in hand, he quietly carries over a chair and flips to an empty page to start.
Clint stands there in a oversized hoodie, deep bags under his eyes and it looks like he hasn’t gotten a wink of sleep since he’d gotten out of medical.
Pepper regards his apology, red lips pursed together. “It’s alright, I understand, it’s instinct.” She smiles, which lets him relax. “I should have asked JARVIS what Tony was doing in the guest room but I assumed, when he told me he wasn’t available for the week-” She bites her lip, cutting herself off.
When I finally do finish the third chapter, I'll continue with shorter chapters, almost prompt-fill like for this universe. Feel free to leave prompts, questions and whatever other comments for this godverse.
There’s a hush in the room, raised brows thrown in his direction but he ignores them, keeps his eyes on the Curator, the only person he needs to convey any meaning to, but even he looks taken by shock.
It put his mind to ease that there were things that changed for the better.
Tony steps back. There’s a new slate of metal attached to the back of the shield, thin, but Steve could make out the edges where it justone from the otherwise smooth curve.
“Did I lose us your motorcycle?” Clint yawns.
“Was I supposed to take your side?” Steve asks. It was expected of an Omega to support his Alpha.
"What's in South Korea?"
Steve complies, raising his ass for the Alpha, his cock swaying between his legs.
Nothing in his room is out of place, he keeps it relatively tidy, if only to give S.H.I.E.L.D. less things to worry about.
“You mean to tell me that you have no formal training of any kind?”
He wanders, follows the walls and carpet and sniffs around, towel left behind as well, so he must be dripping water throughout the house. A small amount of spite, he can’t help it.
Didn’t stop the Alphas in the military from thinking about it though. Or letting him know about it too.
” He pauses
The information leak was a minor issue. Where was it safer than in Stark Servers anyway, and if he understood correctly, they’d be in Tony’s personal servers too.
“What’s wrong, Anthony?” At least his voice hasn’t changed, still deep and authoritative.
“Huh?”
“You haven’t so far.” Steve provides helpfully.
“It’s beautiful.” Steve has to say, because it is. As close as man and machine will ever be, form only ever to service its user, not a plate out of place.
Dumbfounded, he flips the envelope open, thumbing through the papers. He takes out the driver’s licence and examines it.
They’re both still wholly naked, though now covered by a blanket that Tony must have placed on top of them at some point. It’s still dark out, hard to tell with the blinds down.
“Sure, Tony. All I’m saying is that what you’ve described sounded like a pet to me.” Steve says innocently enough, which earns him a light slap on the shoulder and a grimace.
She treated him to some hotdogs and promised that they’d take a few more trips outside, as many as necessary.
He wants to scream, shout, tear down his screens and rip apart his machines. What’s the point of all this if he was going to die anyway? Who would he entrust the Ironman with? Gods, he needs to make a secondary unit that would fit someone else, so that his work could still live on. And like hell was he going to give it up to the government.
following him are terrorizing civilian.
Tension runs high, and Tony sheds the last of his clothes. Given the full view, Steve keeps his eyes to Tony’s chest, noting that Tony was indeed thinner than he had been, muscles sharper and more defined, the new arc reactor providing gaunt light. Direct eye contact would mean a challenge.
“Colluding with my Omega, are you?” Tony gurgles through the coffee, both eyes still closed. Steve wonders how he can even talk around the cup at all. Tony grabs one of the sandwiches, takes a curious bite, and then scarfs it down.
, but how the fuck do they know that? It’s like magic shit, what if it’s undetectable?” This time the other Omega is shaking. “Nat is.” Clint paused, searching for the words that could approximate the Black Widow. “It hits too close to home. I don’t wanna drag her into this. Besides. She’s cleared for duty and I’m… Not.”  He clenches his fists, but stares Steve straight in the eyes. “I’m not safe. I can’t be with normal people.”
“Beautiful.” He comes like that, too keyed up and aroused to hold off any further, with Tony’s fingers all the way in his ass and the constant pump on his cock even when he does, shooting all over his own chests, milked through his orgasm until his body feels buzzed and sated.
He shifts to his knees when Tony becomes impatient, rubbing his cock against Steve’s thigh in aborted movements.
But even now, Tony stands there, waiting for him, not taking anything at all. Just waits for his decision, non-imposing.
Hey look, my first late submission. Welp. I was out of town for most of last week, up at 7 and then going back to the motel at 11 at night, too tired to do anything other than lie down.
“Why not? You’re a god, aren’t you? Can’t you do whatever the hell you want?” Tony challenges, raising a brow at Stevos.
Steve grins. “Not exactly. Cos the next thing I know is, Bucky’s separating us and is holding Howard by the collar of his fancy suit. I still remember the look of confusion on Howard’s face before Buck plants a big sloppy one, right on his lips!” He has to let out a bark of laughter at that. “And it’s not a short one either, it musta been a whole ten seconds before they pull apart. Howard’s staring at Bucky, all flushed and gawping, and Buck just turns to the rest of us, shrugs his shoulders and says ‘My rifle could use an upgrade too. Be dumb not to take him up on such a great offer.’”
He’s entertaining the idea of going to bed early tonight when there’s a knock on the door.
But the couch is still in one piece, albeit, soaked with alcohol from the smell of it.
“Space program.” And then Tony pauses, and shakes his head. “Space talk later. Anyway, I’ve said a lot already. Bottom line. The shield was a joke, but now it’s this grand symbol of hope, dreams and patriotism, when it isn’t. It’s why Wakanda is never credited for it, it’s probably incredibly embarrassing to be shut down like that but it became important anyway. It didn’t even come
“Uhm.”
“I know.” Tony all but growls at him. “But that phone is only worth it’s weight in scraps to me. So keep the damn phone, it's better with you than with me.”
“Dunno, I’d have to check in with SHIELD if I can go.” He’s surprised by the bitterness in his tone.
“Then this must be about my Heat.”
“Okay, okay, I promise, geez, way to spring news on a guy.”
But still, he puts on a smile for Pepper and gets the show on the road.
“JARVIS, put this on manufacturing, stat.”
I missed a week, again. :(Just busy at work, so I put in some extra time on this particular chapter instead.
“You never got around to undressing me.”
That stung. Enough to make Steve back down a step and allow Tony an inch into his space. “Am I one of those things too?”
“You can hack into SHIELD?”
“Suggestions.” Steve says casually, after a noisy
Tony stares back at him, an amused smile on his face, which jolts Steve back into the present. He refuses to think that he’s blushing and shifts his gaze to the machine.
##########
Instead of answering, one of the screen on Tony’s desk lights up, several files already on display.
by the looks of you, but I’m good for it. I just need you to squeal a bit, something for the papers, just a little dirt on Tony, and then, maybe
All too soon he can feel his encroaching orgasm, and there’s bitter anger that this will be over so soon.
Natasha strewn across the ground, body broken from a fall, eyes open and unseeing.
“What’s up Capsicle? J said you wanted to talk to me.” Tony says, not looking up from his work.
When they break apart, Tony’s staring up at him, body pressed close, warm and lazy.
“No no no, I was just caught off guard.” He interjects quickly. “It’s beautiful, Tony.”

“And that means?”
date.
He bears down on the god with ferocity, smashing their lips while he claws at Stevos’s sides, feels the flesh give and Stevos yelp against his tongue. He bites down on his lip until he tastes blood, slides his hands down to Stevos’s ass and grips them tightly.
are you doing to my shield?” Steve says, tone noticeably much more worried now that Tony has involved a power tool.
In fact, Steve is surprised that Fury would allow a team so pack-like to exist. But maybe it only means he isn’t worried of being usurped from his own position.
“Money's no object, but you must understand that this Omega is solely under your responsibility.” Howard says.
“Of course, schedule something with my secretary, we can pen it in by next month.”
They move a little closer, some intimidation tactic no doubt, and Steve swears he hears the shuffle of cloth and metal.
Figures that even gods lie.
“What?” He snaps, then quickly feels bad for it. His frayed scent must have tipped Tony off.
The man on the couch is undeniably Stevos, Tony would recognize that jawline anywhere, but there’s something utterly and obviously wrong. Instead of the normally bulky, muscular god, there lays a small button a blonde.
He flinches when she curses, and then she curses in a different language. In the background he can see Hawkeye smirking.
His first thought is to get his sketchpad, but thinks better of it. There was no telling where his mind would, what details he might conjure. So instead, he goes for his phone.
His body was going through pre-Heat preparation, having him pack in enough food to burn for when his Heat really starts. So that when an Alpha actually did come around, he would have enough energy and stamina to keep the Alpha interested. It also meant that, based on the amount of food he could consume, his heat would prolong, taking the sign of bountiful food as a perfect place to settle down.
“I lied, you know.” Tony suddenly admits with a sigh. “Jarvis pinged me the moment it got a distance from your phone tracker. Those guys that took your bike? They got a visit from a very
“I’ll try, it was all very sudden. There was an offer for it, and I couldn’t refuse.”
Natasha smirks at him.
Tony would disagree but he motions for Stevos to continue anyway.
Steve sends a message to Phil in the afternoon to tell him about the gala, apologizing for the suddenness of the event but hopes that it won’t be a problem for SHIELD if he stays a week longer.
Hey look, it's sunday! Wrote half of this chapter on the train, and the other half while on beach vacation!
He’s on the cusp of his Heat, a hair breadth away from losing himself to the deep need in his body, he can at least do this much out of his own volition.
spot over and over again. Steve can feel the half-formed knot pressing up against his rim, and hears the hitch in Tony’s pants that means he’s nearing completion.
“-touch and kiss and- What?” That gets him to stop, which is a relief.
“Never would have thought that I could have something so beautiful as you. Thank you for choosing me as your Alpha.”
Shield down, he leaves it by his bedside once more, following the lights on the floor that Jarvis provides to make his way to the meeting room.
##########
He remembers it, the way Bucky’s gray eyes nearly jumped out of their sockets at the sight of the meal, putting two and two together because Steve was never good at keeping secrets from him anyway, and they’d argued a whole lot about it already.
“It’s a
He pushes that away, focuses back on thinking about breakfast. He’s been out most of the night, and Bucky’s probably at the docks for his early morning shift by now. If he hurries, he might have time to bring him something to eat.
juicy gossip.” Tony waves off, jostling Steve into moving, leading him with a hand on his back into the guest bathroom. The Omega goes willingly, steps unsure but doesn’t fight Tony’s direction.
Phil looks at least relieved from his reaction.
“About those patent forms?”
He has to admire a man who would willingly sit himself down to this tedious and no doubt boring task for him. Steve has to remember to thank him for the slides when he meets him next.
When they break apart they’re both breathless.
Steve knows that Clint’s joking, at this point he hopes that half the things that Clint says are jokes, but it still gets him upset from time to time. Steve admires him, truthfully, that he can turn his situation into a joke for other people, at the expense of himself. That’s what gets to Steve though. Clint didn’t have to do that, not for him anyway.
of my being here if you refuse ny help regardless, and send me off to help other mortals! I am suppose to protect
“Let me see your penmanship, son.” The manager says to him, pushes a pad of paper to his hands and has him write.
Natasha switches between practicing on the mats and taking him out of headquarters.
Tony places another metal table, this one with clamps on it’s side. He props the shield, holding it sturdily with the clamps. The knobs tighten automatically, securing the shield in place.
“The god of invention.” Stevos corrects politely, though there is a quirk on his lips. “He builds and crafts more than just weapons, but tools and machines as well. If you were born a demigod, there would have been no doubt that you were child of Hephaestus. As it is. He often laments the missed opportunity to gain such a son, but it is these cases that humble even the strongest of gods that mortals can grow to be more capable without our meddling.”
He also undertands that Tony is busy, much busier than he lets Steve know. And yet he agreed to seeing Steve through his Heat. There were just too many things that he didn’t know about Tony Stark.
“Hey man, you don’t have to explain, you don’t like him, you don’t pick him.”
“Fantastic! I’d say that’s a good first test, don’t you?”
By the end of it, Steve is put into some clothes, Tony anxiously touching him through it. The Alpha shrills a
It looks like it takes him a lot to even form the words.
“We can change the activation codes. Any word or keyphrase you’d like, I thought we’d go basic and somewhat serious. Honestly, we can still go with ‘Thundercats ho’ if you’d like, catch and release words. I’d also kind of like to toy with the idea of an electromagnetic field, for deflecting metal debris and bullets, probably. Or at least iron-based bullets, An EMP blast would be fine too, I’m still working on an EMP shield for the suits, it would be nice to test things out with that.” Tony rambles on while Steve catches his breath.
Steve couldn’t hope to take in all of the Alpha’s cock, stopping just short of his knot, but he could damn well try.
Barton was suppose to be with us this evening, to help ease this situation but as you can see we are one Agent Barton short.”
Fury nods, like he understand the
“So. Codes. Breaks all the time, there’s always going to a bug, or glitch or… Just something goes wrong, especially during testing phase. One thing works, another thing doesn’t, blah blah blah, it’s a disaster, everything crashes. Getting it so far?”
“Look, Fury called me up to help an Omega through their heat. And then he tells me,
Six bottles of vodka later.
That night, Bucky finally clambers into his bed, tucking Steve right over his arm, with another wrapped protectively over him. Steve’s head still feels too heavy from the fever, but he smiles through the delirium. It’s a small moment of clarity, or at least, he can understand the words that are coming out of Bucky’s mouth.
“Lights J, and pull back the curtains.” Because there honest to God curtains in the lab. Steve rolls his eyes.
“We have all week to figure out what we both like.”
Steve is vaguely aware that Tony’s arm is still around his hip, as is his own arm around Tony. With that leverage, Tony steers them into some seats by the far end of the room, quieter than the rest of the place.
“Yes Captain Rogers?”
“Hey, it’s alright. I won’t hurt you.” Tony coos, slowly nears him.
“But you let me just-”
“Oh, but you
Tony hands it to Steve to hold. It’s nothing like his actual shield, except for the color and diameter, and it’s in scraps. The weight is all wrong, and he’s certain that it is of another material as well. It’s also the closest thing he’s been given that remotely resembles his shield, and it sends a clench to his gut.
The room is larger than his room in S.H.I.E.L.D., with little to no decoration.
Tony takes that as a challenge. “Do you think I’m above grovelling? Oh you don’t know half of it. I’ll grovel so hard. How do you want me? On my knees? Kissing your feet? Please, Steve, I don’t care about power dynamics. Please,
“No. It’s very okay to 'geek’ out.” Steve laughs, though the reminder of Tony brings about mixed emotions. “It’s a fantastic phone.”
“Okay then, where should I place it?”
. He would have killed everyone else just to get to me.”
“Surprisingly. I was suspicious of the marshmallows.” He says honestly, giving his own cocoa a fond look, nearly halfway into his drink already.
“A priest, for one thing.” Steve offers dryly.
Bucky turns around and slams the bedroom door behind him, Steve’s heart pounding hard in his chest.
“Release.” Just like that, the magnet gives up the shield, and Steve has it in one palm.
He supposes he has to get used to different now.
“Uhm, I don’t think that will fit in me.”
The information isn’t divulged to him, instead Steve hears it in hushed arguments just by the door, and whispered growls that they exchange when they think he’s passed out in Heat-exhaustion.
When Tony returns to Steve, the Omega hasn’t moved an inch, but remains by the corner of the bed, sweat still beading his skin. “They’ll return your clothes.” Tony assures, catching Steve’s attention. “If there’s anything missing, tell me immediately. Does the drug make it hard to speak?”
Clint pulls him into a surprise hug, running an inquiring hand over his back before whispering in his ear.
Bruce Banner with a hole straight through his brain, his eyes still glowing green.
“It’s my-”
He might have cried a little, he will admit that his eyes stung from the effort of holding back those tears, but he takes the situation as best he can. Instead, he makes himself a small space in the living room. And after a quick query with JARVIS for a power outlet and the network password, he plugs in his SHIELD laptop and starts doing the report. He hadn’t had the chance to work on them on the flight over, too stressed out by the thought that Tony was injured. But now he welcomes the distraction, at least until Tony needs him.
Steve nods. “We were off-base after a couple of days, but he sent out re-supplies for all of us, including a bunch of modified 1911, a new sniper rifle for Bucky, and coffee that didn’t taste like dirt when we set it to boil. Buck reckoned it was a pretty swell deal for a couple of kisses. Howard was always a little wary of him from then on, and the punk would throw out a kiss at Howard whenever they were in the same room. Made for a couple good laughs.” Steve lets the memory seep in, a stupid moment in time, Howard rushing out of the meeting room, the rest of the boys holding in laughter while Bucky throws them a look of utter mischievous intent and pride.
Steve finds himself by Natasha’s side, she looks at him stoically.
It’s noisy, kids running around the corridor, laughing and yelling, Steve’s never been around this many other children before. A few of the boys stop and stare, nudging one another and pointing at him. Nervous tension creeps up and he holds Sister Catherine’s a little tighter as they walk past.
Chitauri stabbing him over and over again with their spears.
Another breath, another shudder. He’s still slick. His cock has at least decided to calm down now. How long has passed? He’s not even sure anymore.
Phil seems to understand that, nodding agreeably, but then his face turns serious.
“Bucky seemed nice.”
“Fuck.”
Eventually, after who knows how long, they pull apart.
His jaw tightens and sighs, feeling a little put off by the mention of classified information. It was one thing to mention things about his childhood and another altogether to mention Erksine's work. A man who-
“One million going twice.”

“Good.” Steve grinds out, throat working to growl out the words. Tony looks surprised by the word, looking at him with wide-eyes.
is on neither of their minds, as the force of Tony’s thrusts send Steve into another field of want.
Eventually Commander Fury steps out of the room. Steve stands to greet him, stopping the knee-jerk reaction to salute. Instead he nods.
. ‘Cos you’re going to pull through and it’s gonna be okay.”
“It still wasn’t right.” Frank insuists, brows furrowed together.
And there Tony is a makeshift hospital bed. Or rather, about as makeshift in utility as possible. Steve didn’t think they made hospital beds that big, not King-sized at least, because this was definitely along those lines. Either a special order or something that was reserved for the very elite. It was almost amusing if it were not Tony in it.
“I told you before. I like Alphas. I can’t-”
“Huh.” Clint says after a while. “Same thing that Laura said, except she said newspaper but that’s pretty close, just a word choice.” Clint smiles at him. “Oranges.” He hums the words. “Yeah, that’s right.” Is a softer, Steve can tell Clint is thinking about his mate.
“I asked if he could take a bath, he said yes he could, so I let his little ass be and this is what I get. Oh, no. Tony, you couldn’t just have made sure he was fine, you just had to run off and do your own thing. God those pheromones are strong. Naked Omega with an attitude and-”
He’s not sure if Natasha is giving him just scraps because he didn’t have the clearance to know (there was an agent level system he still couldn’t grasp the exact details of, except that Clint and Natasha had exceptionally high clearance, or else they wouldn’t have even been allowed near him), or if she she was generally not interested in that sub-group of S.H.I.E.L.D.
“I’m sure he is. Handsome and rich too, an Omega’s wet dream.”
"Tony?" He says after three curt knocks, peeking his head through the door to check on him.
Omega instincts tell him that this is right, comforting the Alpha and providing him with physical support. This is a good place to be, covered in warmth and protection, away from prying eyes and outside threats.
“Where- I wasn't-” He sputters, still caught between the throes of the cold and harsh reality as everything comes crashing back to him. He was in the future, where there were LED television, computers and robots and-
“I knew your father.”
But his (traitorous) body was already reacting to the sight of the phallic object, not to mention the very informative graphic that Tony had drawn on. He finds himself already starting to slick, the desperate slow burn in his body making him consider the-
“Steve?”
Steve punches him square in the jaw, vaguely remembering to pull back as his body shakes in controlled rage. He stares numbly, Justin curled around his feet, cradling his jaw and spewing curses.
Steve nods, going quiet.
Steve knows that much, power play between Alphas, internal politics that strayed between the norm where normal Fight couldn’t occur. The Omega was like a bartering chip, a show of power, in turn could also show great disrespect towards another Alpha. To arouse an Omega in a room of Alphas was as good as any of that, especially when the Omega was not to be shared. It would have been Tony practically spitting at the face of the General, displaying an Omega just off his heat like a war prize. It was dangerous.
“But I always thought y’know. What would I have done even if I knew? Could I have changed anything? Doc said it was probably cos Ma was always around the sick, and she caught it too but she kept working anyway. Didn’t let anybody stop her.”
Stevos hits his prostate almost with devotion, melting Tony into a blubbering mess within minutes. He doesn’t want to let go though, clinging to the god with his hands curled on Stevos’s arms, a hand burying itself in that mess of soft blonde hair, drawing him in close to kiss.
if you’d let me do this
There’s a hand on his pec, another curled under him abdomen, a soft brush of lips on his shoulder. And then Tony is pressing against him, buries his nose to Steve’s collar and takes a deep inhale, arms curling around his body in a hug. There’s a half-hard cock pressed to his ass, pushing against him, hot and thick where it touches him.
“Oh honey. It’s all very complicated. Things that only adults should be worrying about, okay? I’ll explain when you’re older, but right now you need to go with those men, like we talked about last night, remember? While I was packing all your things?”
Talk turns into an invitation to dinner. Steve shrugs and goes along with it, silly to turn down a meal when Frank insists. They settle at a quiet place, or as quiet as it can be after work hours and everyone’s hustling for food.
“Okay, I think it’s time to go home now.” Steve chuckles, placing some cash for the drinks and then bodily heaving Clint to stand up.
“Save and close. Keep running those simulations. Everything from Earth and within Earth orbit. Top priority status.”
“I wanted to give you something while you were coherent. Thought you would appreciate it more.”
“Tony, I don’t-”
“They ran the tests, man. They say that there’s no trace of whatever it was Loki did to me, did to
“That ain’t fair and you know it.” Steve says sullenly, chest tightening at the thought. “You know as well as I do I ain’t got much choice here.”
Tony kills the blow torch, shoves up his welding mask and give Steve a levelled look.
Steve continues to look confused.
“He shouldn’t have touched you, he shouldn’t have even
He remembers it. One day, when his legs don’t feel like they’ll crumple from underneath him from fever, and Bucky was out working, he slipped out of their little home and went to the mating blocks, cos no matter how bad things were, there were always gonna be some Alphas who wanted to get their rocks off.

It tastes like grass and rust, with an almost sterile aftertaste that follows, reminds him of hospitals.
Fury, surprisingly, grants him permission to leave base.
“Very well, I shall schedule a driver to pick you up at your location.” And it must say something about how well Steve is acclimating to JARVIS that he doesn’t bother confirming if the AI knew where he was. “The Stark jet is available for your comfort, it will be waiting at the airport upon your arrival.”
It should feel reassuring, a sense of comfort to a space that was his. Except it’s also a reminder of Tony’s kindness.
Maybe that kind of thinking didn't change, even after all these years.
to believe.
This was sex, not heat. He had a choice in this.
Even if Fury was hiding something, dangerous and foreboding as that sounded, Steve was determined to be within reach to stop the man if need be.
Military, he can see it in his stride, the kind that gets drilled into you with months of repetition. Steve had never really gotten it down, thrown into the field of battle far too quickly to allow any kind of habit to form, but he saw it in the men he fought with, and his squad. Knowing the man is the military is hardly any comfort, especially with Tony's history with them.
“To Sir's cabin lounge.” Is what he gets, Steve does feel the disapproving tone from just that, and then Steve's phone gets an alert in his email box (Ebox? Inbox? But messages are different than in his regular phone’s messages?). Perhaps JARVIS had at least presumed his curiosity, but there were files upon files of the news articles from the days prior, all with the headlines “TONY STARK ATTACKED” or similar, boldly titled.
He can see staring off, the way he does when he’s considering a problem in his mind, and then blinks back.
“Yeah.” Andrew replies, all dazed and starry-eyed, looks at Steve in wonder. “Do they all feels this good?”
It’s a little easier than he remembers, half-hard cock in his mouth. Easier to take him to the base like this, the tip of his nose pressed to coarse hair, the first flutter in his mouth as Tony’s cock hardens. He nearly gags when it flexes, pushing deep inside his throat, resettles his hold on the base while he takes the cock over and over again, jaw slack and careful.
at him and closes the door behind him, leaving Steve in the room by himself, laid on the bed as he tries to understand what had just happened.
“Speaking of being a darling.” Tony rolls his eyes, looking to avoid another round of Brock going on and on about his Omega. “Would you be a dear and wash him off? The scent it’s-”
But sometimes he thinks that Tony is right. They aren’t soldiers, not after what they’d gone through. This isn’t a mission, this is a man’s soul shaken to the core because an alien god had found it suitable to play with his mind.
He’s not gentle, not in any of the ways he could be. It’s desperation and hunger rolled into one when he pushes his fingers into Stevos’s mouth, forcing those plush lips open, thumbs his chin when Stevos lathers his digits with spit.
Alpha. A pretty thing like you ought be tied up-”
“Yes.” He breathes, barely a whisper.
“Yes.”
“Yeah.” Steve says, near breathless, he struggles to focus on Tony. Piercing, inquisitive eyes looking over him, Tony’s scent sharp, Alpha instinct no doubt taking over, fretting over the Omega that was so clearly in distress.
though, if you know what’s good for you.”
“Oh, thank god, my feet are killing me.” The man laughs, taking the seat. He has thick-rimmed glasses, sandy-blonde hair, and a smile that makes Steve be on guard. He’s also an Alpha.
It brings to mind what SHIELD might have in store for him. He can only believe that Director Fury is doing it from the kindness of his heart for so long, and eventually, he does have to ask what he might have in store for him. He knows the way the Director looks at him, calculating and patient. Knows it from his time in war and when Alphas when they’re trying to decide if he’s worth the trouble or not.
He grits his teeth as he realizes how that sounds. So sad, so lonely, so desperate for things to cling to, but never finding them. So utterly lost that there was barely anything that could hold him together.
Tony shrugs him off and keeps walking. The man was his godfather, but he’d always been too touchy for his own good. “I’ve already told Dad.” He shoots a look at Howard. “I don’t
Stevos barks out a laugh. “It doesn’t work that way but I admire your bravery for asking.”
“Bread and eggs.”
The door opens for them automatically. It occurs to Steve that this is his first time inside Tony’s room, and tries not to look at anything too personal. It’s a bigger room than his, surprisingly void of any
“This is… A lot for me take in.” Steve admits, not to mention Tony was being distracting on how he was touching his body.
“Demi-gods have always been prophesized to do great things. To slay a beast or conquer a citadel were among the highest regards. Bucharus and I would often dream of going out on our own quest, idle daydream of the youth, and pray to the gods for an opportunity to prove ourselves. We couldn’t really, not when I could barely lift a sword, or walk a mile without needing a rest. But we pretended to be soldiers like most boys, practiced with stick for however long my chest would allow, or before Bucharus’s mother could drag us each by the ear with a stern word.”
, he preferred to go through this at his own pace in secret.
“Nonsense, he
The necklace around his neck feels both light and heavy at the same time.
It makes him smile anyway, because now he knows a little better, and it was embarrassing moments that have built him up and rounded him off. Thanks to them, he wasn’t so green anymore, and he’s learned to deal with people with the patience his Ma had tried to instill in him.
Tony takes a breath. “I’m dying.”
So I missed a couple of weeks. No excuses from me, I suck, stuff going on in my life I'd rather not get too deep into right now.
“You can practice hiding it. Find out where it’s easiest to bring out, it’ll be good practice for when you need it on the field.”
Ahh, of course. It wasn’t as if mating blocks were set up to actually find mates. More of a place to blow off some steam during an otherwise terrible night. Heats were just that, looking for a mate to see it through. There would be less emotion if the heat wasn’t finished with the Alpha. Nothing personal. Nothing too emotional.
Steve sighs, shakes his head. “It’s probably best if you would let a professional look over you instead.” He tries, even though he knows Tony is too stubborn to listen to reason.
“How long do you think you’ll need?” Is all Fury asks.
That gets him a sly smile, and a shift of limbs. “Relax, I’m just kidding. You’re horribly straight, and you go for High Alpha the first chance you get. I still don’t get you and Stark, whatever makes you happy, man but whenever you feel like experimenting-” There’s a roll of hip, though it lacks heat and is clearly meant to tease him, Steve yelps.
. Seems too brash. Is too repetitive by now that even Bucky knows what he’s going to say.
Clint is quiet for a while. “Serum-enhanced senses. Probably how you knew I was Omega in the first place.” Clint grumbles, mostly to himself, frowns right into Steve’s chest. “There goes
It was the surveillance that bothered him.
But with Tony… It’s like finding a piece of coal after being so cold for so long. The burst of heat to start the flame, a simmering ember to keep warm with. Steve’s not sure how long he can have that warmth, but he wants to make the best of it, so badly that it aches. Even if he burns himself while trying to hold on.
“There is a search helicopter a couple miles out. Your friend has been searching for you for months, he’ll take care of you and ensure your journey home.” Stevos explains, apparently ignorant of the way Tony wants to touch his muscles. Like all of them.

“I’m almost done you know.”
He looks at them expectantly, glancing curiously at Steve.
“Can you...?” He trails off.
It looked handmade, a chipped blade wrapped in worn but sturdy cloth and kept in place with string. Shiv sounded like the more appropriate term for it than knife. It seemed so out of place as compared to the guns he’d been handed.

“Just to talk? When you’re not-”
for one another.
He has nightmares of the Chitauri invasion.
“Oh believe me, I know.” Tony pulls away, Steve only managing not to look disappointed by the withdrawn warmth. “This wasn’t how I planned to tell you. I wanted to court you a little first, take you places and give you things to show I was interested before telling you my intentions.” There’s that smile again, soft and kind.
He really shouldn’t be surprised when he’s gently placed on the bed, Egyptian cotton and memory foam, barely used as little more than a decoration piece. What does surprise him is when Stevos starts divesting him of his clothes.
It’s a straight and direct command, one that Steve has no trouble following as he ambles onto the couch, bare for Tony’s ideas. He really is thankful for the serum, his knees aren’t even sore.
being filled.
“Sure Tony.”
“You really should get yourself checked by a doctor, a professional one.” Steve chides, an insistent finger on Tony’s chest.
Steve’s mind rises to attention when they reach the gated premises of the Stark Premises. Happy gets out of the car first to get his bag from the trunk, Steve standing and surveying the premises. The house is nothing like he’d seen before (Modern?), but the outside is a garden no matter how he looked at it. Setting sun against it, the house is almost ethereal.
Steve brows furrow, growling at that.
“We’ll be tracking you, of course.”
A list? That at least better than an ultimatum.
“Of course.” He would expect no less.
Tony clears his throat, a step towards Steve with indecision. “Well. Now that
Stevos chuckles and smiles at him, except this smile is so hollow. “I suppose you do not.”
They didn’t do anything too different today, another hand-to-hand combat simulation with a few other agents so that Natasha could step back to critique his form. He felt good today, looser, a warm ache in his bones that made him feel more intune with his body than he has felt in a while.
Clint flops onto the empty seat when Michael leaves, giggling madly and smelling like he’d bathed in beer, a full glass of something in his hand.
“You always say that like I ever did anything to really stop you.” Bucky comes back, work boots creaking the wooden floors. “Like I ever did you a great dishonor just cos you’re an Omega.” He shakes his head. “Fine Steve Rogers. Go prove whatever the

and couple were driven into an Omegas mind. An Omega in Heat cared for only for one thing; to have the strongest mate around. Which was why it was considered dangerous for more than one Alpha to service an Omega. Chances were that the two Alphas would be driven mad by the Heat, and fight over the Omega in question.
Tony nods but doesn't press for more, looking satisfied by the answer and maybe that what presses Steve to go on.

“Then I guess I’m just plain 'ol Steve Rogers.”
“That’s right, honey, just calm down and breath. In and out, in and out, just like the nurse taught us to.” His Ma coaxes gently, breathing with him until Steve doesn’t feel so dizzy.
Steve doesn’t regret it, they’d been at war, the men he’d killed had chosen their side, ideals that he couldn’t take sitting down. He’d pitied them, in a way, because they’d been lost and blind.
Stevos comes to visit later that night, holds him in his arms, tells him everything will be alright.
There’s another stretched silence, which Steve takes to tightening his sketch with stronger strokes. “Mr. Stark has given you alpha access throughout the household.” Comes the answer. “Information on my data servers, access throughout Stark households, any and all services I am able to render are at your disposal. Sir has put a remarkable amount of faith in you.” The last one almost sounded hopeful.
The water is getting closer and closer as the plane rattles in its descent, pitch black on the surface. When the nose of the plane finally hits the water's surface, he finds himself flung back by the impact, hands coming miraculously free. He's on his feet in seconds but the metal plane is sinking fast, water swirling around him.
When he awakens, there’s light filtering through the curtains, the strange dark-not-dark casting a strange glow to the room. He feels a little better, without the heat burning in his center, enough to look around and remember his circumstance. His throat dries, and then he swallows. Now’s not the time to mope, not when he still did not know the Alpha’s motive for putting him into the room. Was it punishment? Some sick game the Alpha played?
“Five hundred thousand.” The Curator confirms when the moment passes, and another flurry of mutters sweep the room.
The work tablet is once again in his hands, but this time, he doesn't put it down to greet Steve. He's got a look of concentration on the screen but something just seems off about it to Steve.
And the god still hasn’t said a word but he does come closer.
Steve glares.
still feels strange on his tongue.
"Hope that's a good thing." He really hopes it is. There's still something odd in Tony's look, but he trusts the Alpha to tell him if he wanted to. "Wouldn't want to be a problem for you."
“Earlier. You were trying to leave the bed, you said you needed something.” Tony clarifies. “What is it you need, Steve?”
“Right. Will you come here for heats as well?”
Tony watches him leave, and it’s only moments before he’s tapping away at his phone. He had to say, talking like his dad sure had its perks, with just a few
The heat in his belly is intolerable, and before Steve knows it, he’s coming all over the sheets, clenching on Tony’s dick like he was made for it. He hears the tell-tale grunt, the gush of hot liquid inside of him as he feels Tony’s knot lock them together, inflating to the point of burn, pressed inside him ball deep as Tony empties himself into the Omega’s hole.
"A little." Tony says with hesitancy, eyes dropping to his blankets. "The drugs. They. They you know. Mess my thoughts."
Stevos mutters something that suspiciously sounds like ‘
“I don’t want you to settle.” Steve says, curls up, stubborn, even as Bucky’s arms surround him.
By now, Steve feels too raw and open, but Ed’s cock is merciless on him, burns his insides and stretches him even further. What pleasure he can derive from it is also laced in pain, and Steve cries out from it.
“You don’t have to leave the mansion.” He mumbles into Tony’s skin. “There’s always video chat, talk to them down at the lab. I’ll be right here waiting for you.”
’ and fusses over him, makes his lean against debris and then conjures a medical kit out of thin air.
Tony stares at him, a look of surprise. “He means well. Most of the time. No. Uhh. Take whichever side you'd prefer?” Tony lifts his shoulders up and then deflates. “I wasn't kidding though, I'm very busy today. I can't exactly, err, play with you today. Maybe later tonight. We can get the claiming going on just so that you aren't so antsy about it.” Tony adds.
“You would not have believed me out in the desert. You might have picked Loki instead.” Stevos scoffs, but he lets his scarred hands be examined.
Or Michael, who bought him a drink and then started to try and flirt with him, only later he admitted that his friends had dared him because they thought that Steve wouldn’t give him the time. Steve blushes at that, flattered that Michael, a tall dark-haired Alpha, even thought about him like that.
Steve moans with the thorough inspection, shuddering when Tony takes a nipple in his mouth and sucks hard.
“For the Tesseract.” She provides. “He’s alive. Spotted in Germany, but his team got away during your tussle with Thor. Loki was the priority target, and Barton slipped away before the Agents could find them.”
That tired acceptance is back, and Steve just
“So. A god, huh?” Tony ventures.
He gasps for breath, but then Tony leans in to take his mouth in a bruising kiss, stealing his air away while he dizzily tries to respond, a hand still milking his cock.
That was good news, wasn’t it? It was going to be over soon, he could go back to barely existing within S.H.I.E.L.D. barracks and no one could say that he didn’t try. It also meant that he would have to suffer through a heat
Steve curls further into Tony’s chest, mulling over the words, feeling a warmth blossom in his chest that has nothing to do with his Heat. For the first time, he understood why Tony looked at him a certain way, he could finally put a name to that look.
Tony. Tony’s scent. Sweet, strong, tangy, like a Raspberry. Rust, strong on his tongue. Like blood. Smokey, wisps. Like coal. Not bad.
From there, he can kiss Stevos’s back, make it all the way up to his spine, and settle his chin on the god’s shoulder, panting right on the god’s ear.
“An operation you shouldn’t even know about.” He sighs.
“If the guy comes bothering you again-”
“Thanks.”

If it weren’t for Erksine, who insisted on letting a ninety-pound, asthmatic, Omega into the program, Steve doubted he would have gotten anywhere in the Army at all.
“Off the field, it’s Clint, okay? Feels like I’m suppose to be looking for targets whenever you call me by my codename. And anyway, I’m not the best guy to explain Alpha-Omega etiquette to you anyway. You’re better off
Jasper blinks, doesn’t even look offended. “Of course.” Like he deals with this all the time. “I’ll post someone by the door for anything you need.”
But Tony only moves past him, shrugging.
“You either disperse the situation or distract them. Go on

“No! Of course not.”

“You wanna get adopted?” George asks him one day. They’re kinda friends now, George lets him borrow his toy wooden car so he thinks they are.
It’s not long before he’s too impatient, yanks away the fingers and presses them right into Stevos’s hole in one sharp flick.
The image of Tony on his knees is enough to make his cheeks blush. Shoving a hand at Tony’s face as he does kissing sounds at him, Steve relents, still finding hard to believe how impossible Tony was after seven days.

Tony fake-gasps. “Why I never. I’ll have you know I treat him very well. He gets the best motor oil the market can offer, plus I’m his personal mechanic.” But his grin goes sheepish, pushing himself away from his desk in favor of settling himself next to Steve on the lab-couch instead. “Sort of. Not really. That might have been the original draft but then all the possibilities dawned on me. Rubberducks have nasty shifty beady little eyes, so I figured, what about something else. At first I put googly-eyes on a stick but then that didn’t really work out. But that gave me an idea. Say, something that could track eye movement, face tracking, could listen to audio cues. Something that could run away at the sound of danger, but otherwise stay still. Why stop there? Voice recognition, minor commands just- Why are you laughing?” Tony pouts.

Steve has an inkling, of course. Maybe this was Tony’s way of asking for him to come, where he can finally return the phone, and clarity could be made. It was too expensive a gift to ignore, he felt almost at debt to the Alpha.
Steve stares at the door knob for a good while, listening as the sound of footsteps on wooden floors fade away.
“You know, re-organizing Stark Industries from bottom up. Keeps a man busy, along with my superhero gig. I haven't had the time to fix my schedule, Cara.”
The Alpha at least has the manners to let the couple settle their dues before he starts to bother Steve.
But for now, it meant that Steve would feel like his body was on fire as hormones flooded his system.
Tony smirks at his opponent, who meekly sits back down. He turns his attention to the Omega, who’s also looking at him, something indescribable in his gaze, some mix of disbelief, pride and something else there.
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.”
The Omega-scent has lessened, enough that he can probably tolerate the smell and actually sit in his own chair. He blames Steve and his scent for the eight hours he’s lost in actual productivity. God. It had taken almost his entire will not to pounce on Steve when he’d just sat there, naked and open, blue eyes wide with expectation, pale skin all for the taking.

But that has been all a test, hadn’t it? Set up perfectly, with Fury in the appropriate spot to explain the situation to Steve, looking like the best option possible.
Will chortles. “He doesn’t look like he scares off easy, do you son?”
“I didn’t count on you being able to smell a mated pair. Didn’t think that that was possible even.”
“Oh please, if you’re calling this nothing then it’s the same as calling last night nothing. SO how about this. You tell me what’s bugging you, and I tell you what’s bugging you.”
Tony laughs, fast and unbidden, and Steve joins him until they’ve got tears in the corner of their eyes, fighting to catch their breath as Tony leans on Steve’s shoulders for support.
Steve snaps, feeling like being chided. “I know what I said. It’s just. I’m sorry, if you didn’-”
She gives him a look and then smiles gently.
Steve shrugs. “I don’t know what’s there to see, but I’d like to be out there on my own for a change.”
) enthralled by the Steve’s reaction, grabs a fistful of ass and presses in deep, plunging himself into Steve, inhibitions lost as the need thrives for the both of them. He only slows to change their position, forcing Steve onto his belly and moving his legs out of the way.
“I’m fine.” He’s more exhausted than anything. “M’ fine, get off me you lug.” When Bucky’s prodding turns more aggressive, flailing his arms at him to make him move back.
But his lucky streak would come to an end sooner or later, and he would need Tony’s help once again. Before that, however, he wanted to be sure that they were both at an understanding.
Frank at least has the mind to look abashed, a quick look at Ernie and then he nods solemnly at Steve, leaving with his pills.
It only takes two bullets for him crumple, Tony ripping out the cords as the suit goes online. Gritting his teeth, he empties his gun in front of him, switching to the flamethrower when he run out.
Happy with the fresh hickey on Steve’s neck, Tony repositions himself, his legs on either sides of Steve’s body. He rams his cock into Steve’s loosened hole, wrenching a torn howl as all Steve can do is hang on for the ride.
When Stevos’s hand snakes up under his clothes, hands pressing to the front of Tony’s chest, Tony hisses as his fingers slide over a bruise.
“I’d like some time to think about all this first.” Steve decides, solemn.
“Please not military.”
Made it with time to spare. As promised, some plot progression with smut. I've been busy collecting some funko pops and marvel collector stuff so I might have gotten sidetracked but I got a bunch of new keychains, some Iron Man pops and a Captain America pin from it so it's all good.
“You did good work today.” She starts, letting her appreciation be known, an encouraging smile on her face. “I think you’re ready.”
“You need not tease. I know why it is you wish me in this form.” Stevos admits with a sigh, shoulders slumping down in defeat.
Splayed out for him, Tony thinks that Stevos must be the most beautiful being he has ever seen.
.” John adds in, a smirk as he stretches out his legs. “Better pick something you don’t mind being called over and over again. But an Alpha’s brain loses any form of higher thinking once their knot shows. Poor things, really.” He peers over the window. “Ahh, looks like our first customer.” He waves at the window and Steve turns to look as well.
Tony turns, pouring out milk into the pot and setting it to boil. “Sometimes simple is good too.” He says, plucking out a knife from the drawers.
“You’ve been doing this, all along.” He says after a beat. He sort of knows what it does. God magic or whatever. Stevos had said so before, he would lend him his strength.
“Sounds like a shitty dad.”
To Steve’s credit, he manages to hold in a cringe. He’s seen the 'memorabilia’ in his image. From pop art comics, tin boxes and statues, it felt strange to see Captain America in almost every form imaginable. People wore shirts with designs of his shield, in hundreds of different ways.
Steve huffs. “I’m gonna die someday, Buck.”
Steve awakes with a jolt, mouth dry from panting, his skin still feels cold like it's been pressed against ic. Even his limbs feel too heavy to move. But he can feel his heart, beating against his chest, loud and strong and
Steve frowns. “I’m not leaving you, Tony.”
“Holy fuck, I take it back. You’re straight up the devil.” Tony gasps, eyes still on him but Steve can tell Tony’s brain is elsewhere. “Come here, lie down.”
It’s a beautiful display nonetheless, one normally Tony doesn’t have much time to admire when they go at it. He has a general idea of how glorious Stevos looks like, it does help that the god takes to wearing skin-tight clothes anyway, leaving very little to the imagination.
Steve feels bad for thinking that the operations are easy. Five months and ten assignments in, he can draw the obvious differences between his time in war.
“Not really.” He answered. He was sick most of the time, unable to leave the confines of his bed at worst, his Heats came sparingly, sometimes only once a year as compared to the regular three times that a normal
Steve had gotten a few when he was younger, a bracelet or a ring was common enough, something not too expensive yet the symbolic nature of the gift was there.
“Steve?” Clint murmurs sleepily, his arms draped loosely around Steve’s neck.
Just.
“He’s also kind of a douche.”
The door opens for him without a knock, which is, huh? He would think that Tony’s security wouldn’t be so slack.
“It might have been Loki messing with my head, but those were my thoughts, my fucking plans. Loki’s smart, but he isn’t a genius about some other planet’s technology.” Clint snarls, angrier than Steve has ever seen him. “Twenty people died directly because of me, by my bow, by my hands. People can try to tell me it isn’t my fault, like shit, Nat tried to tell me that. But I c-can’t believe 'em.” His voice breaks.
Tony at least seems to understand, and shifts uncomfortably away, letting go of Steve’s arm in a desperate gesture. “You know that’s not what I meant.” He says, voice too low and too calm.
He nearly fires a repulsor at Stevos when he appears, vaguely wonders if it would even do anything to the god if he did.
It’s a mess, SHIELD is in near chaos, Steve can smell the panic that wafts across the hallways of the helicarrier. Disarray in the Agents like he’s never seen before. Director Fury had briefed him about the situation on the cube, but not much else.
“The nerve of that guy. Telling me what and what not today. Can you believe that?”
on his heart that both saves and kills him.
“Got to hand it to her though, didn’t budge from her seat.”
##########
“We’re fucking idiots. I wasn’t sure.” Tony shakes his head, runs a hand down the curve of Steve’s neck that makes him shudder. “Me and Pepper. It never really worked out. I couldn’t. Well. I’m an actual asshole, it’s that simple.” Tony frowns, his gaze softens, and falls to Steve neck where he thumbs the skin there.
Brock snorts. “Doubt it. My little darling is the prettiest Omega out there.”
Stevos laughs. “No. Some are even more impressive, but most of us have quirks of our own. Mortals often have a habit of calling our squabbles petty, and I do have to agree.”
By the time Tony painfully extricates himself from behind the suit, the camp is silent. Bodies strewn across the area, he spots Stevos with another man, this one dressed in a green and gold cloak. Tony picks his way through the debris, and overhears the tail end of their conversation.
“Okay, Steven. Would you mind if I called you Steve?” Tony asks precariously, the scent goes strong and alive, pulls on his instincts, but Tony’s already made up his mind.
“But you had the time to snag this beautiful Omega. What was your name again, dearie?” She says with a flutter (four blinks, he counts) in Steve’s direction.
“No need to be afraid. Hey, what’s your name? You’ve had an owner, so you must have a name. Mine’s Tony.”
are not going anywhere.” Tony commands, placing an insistent hand on Steve's chest. For a sickening second, Steve plays with the idea of pushing Tony aside, it would have easy to push past the Alpha and head for the door. Break away from this pretend safety that Tony says he has. Steve's not safe, he's never safe, not when there are people who can easily lock him up, keep him contained.
I could wait. But I couldn’t stop myself from checking up on you, worrying, maybe a little bit too much.” He looks at him almost embarassed, and Steve would have believed him if it weren’t for the hand that continued to fondle his chest through his shirt.
“Less things to move in, perfect.”
“Nah, it’s alright. ’Sides, I got you way more times, you just heal too damn quick.” Clint tosses back jovially, throwing the knife into the air and then catching it between his fingers, and then shakes his head when Steve motions to give him back the shiv.
“Oh, I’m sorry. It’s a slight detail in contracts these days. You and your selected Alpha will meet before your Heat for a short period of time, just the two of you, and see if your scents are compatible. If neither of you react, then you may select another Alpha.”
But it’s the same, he’s through another set of doors, a viewing room of sorts. Except, this time there are a couple of other Omegas around. Figures, it was later in the night, more Alphas free with their time than in the afternoon, so of course there’d be a couple more Omegas to fill in that gap.
Steve mulls that over. Tony Stark, possibly the last connection to the past he had. It almost felt like a trap. After a two months of sitting around, why had no one told him that Tony Stark existed? And then seeing him on this list? It all sounded too suspicious.
The manager takes his writing.
“For what?” Steve keeps his tone hushed. They’re out in public, which means there are gossiping ears everywhere, and he hated knowing that people were listening in.
“That you think you don’t belong here.”
“Next time, tell us in advance.” She sounds sullen, but otherwise unperturbed.
“O ye of little faith.” Stevos jokes, to which Tony snorts.
“Someday, someday.” Tony mumbles, eyes squeezed shut. “Close. I’m going to. Oh god, Steve. I’m so close. Take off those damn clothes.”
Tony, very carefully, takes Stevos’s hands in his, thumbing a extruded knuckle. He feels calluses, rough and weathered by battle that were missing on the god’s larger form. He had thought it odd, the god was clearly some kind of warrior, but his hands had been smooth and soft, as if he had never done any labor at all. Here, he can see the trickery, how much the illusion could fool his senses. It’s a bitter realization, being lied to, but he also understand that Stevos meant no harm in it, probably thought that he was just giving Tony what he wanted.
on the list, didn’t I personally end his report with ‘never again in a million years’?” Clint said, disgruntled that a
He doesn’t want to talk about this, not now, not when Tony is such a delicious presence that he needs to physically stop himself from humping Tony’s leg. “When I joined up with the Army, I didn’t think about Heat leaves. Especially when I was applying as a Beta. They weren’t going to let an Omega into the Army, they were very clear about that. ”
He continues jerking himself off, eyes falling closed as he tries to bring up some type of memory to hurry himself along. Almost immediately he recalls Tony’s mouth, hot and wet around his cock and has to suppress a shudder.
His afternoon is then occupied by either Natasha or Clint. They’d reached an agreement between themselves without Steve knowing, as they took turns calling him out of his room for training.
Steve blinks up at Tony, the look of concern surprising. (How long was he quiet for?)
“Crystal.”
But all Steve feels is the twinge of nervousness that lodges itself in his belly. He can barely navigate his way through the internet for the most basic information, let alone a high pressure area like a battlefield. He often felt so lost as it was, trying to understand how things worked now. How he should act. He had no clue of what everyone expected of him. Leadership? He barely qualified for that amount of responsibility.
, on the bed, on his ass, on his balls, on his shaft, but Steve doesn’t care. Not when the Alpha snarls and mounts him properly, forces him to comply to the position, has him bare his throat so the Alpha can kiss and suck bruises on his neck as the man continues to make use of his hole.
It's Sunday and there's a chapter. Yaaayyy.
Fuck Fury and Natalia. Fuck their assessment. But he doesn’t argue with consultations, he trusts no one else with weapons and blueprints for their super secret boyband. If he couldn’t be part of it, then the least he could do was be their floor manager and make sure they had the best equipment possible.
“I thought you’d like to decorate yourself.” Tony says, as if reading his mind. “Feel free to buy anything that you like and bring it around. Or have JARVIS buy it online and have it delivered.”
some virgin pup.”
“You see why Agent Barton would have been of some help.”
of all people?
Steve looks up, watches the carefully blank face of Tony Stark. He’d never liked it when people looked down on him. When he was smaller, all he wanted to do was prove to everyone else that he was just as good as the rest of them. A joke to a lot of Alphas, as if a sickly Omega was ever their equal. He didn’t want pity either, he wanted to stand tall on his own terms, not because everyone else was willing to take a step down for him.
It had worked for a while, he could almost feels those huge fingers working his thin thighs, forcing him down by the neck and kept his ass high in the air to fuck over and over. He’d whimper, and the Alpha would like it, a piston of hips while he struggled underneath, knobby hands grasping onto cum-stained bed sheets.
that rouses Steve from sleep. He blinks in the darkness, light slowly brightening to ease him from slumber.
Alpha-Omega couples are the best, or at least that’s what George says. They smell the
He doesn’t tell them the details, gruelling months of scraping his nails on the blackboard until he felt so hopeless, certainly doesn’t tell them about Stevos. Neither are really oaths he wants to revisit, and it’s strange that both have equal weight on his heart whenever he thinks about them.
“A magnet. A very high-powered magnet. The best part? It’s controllable. A recent discover of mine, haven’t patented it yet, wanted to test out uses first. Wanna try it out?”
Alpha of his made it to the list.
“The o-older boy from earlier is James.”
“I know.”
He nods even as he holds his breath. It’s strangely not humiliating to be seen like this. Steve had never played off his weaknesses, didn’t like being thought little off by bullies. Somehow there’s dignity in admitting his dreams, of his fears, the quiet torment that only he knew, shared out in the open for once.
“I gave you the choice after.” Stevos rolls his eyes, clearly reading the way Tony wanted to argue. “If you had rejected me, I am sure Loki would have returned to persuade you.”
For a man who Steve has seen parade around the gala for most of the night, acting like he owned the place, he looks oddly subdued in his own home.
“And I did. You had me ensure Pepper’s safety. She is in her home right now, shaken but fine. Happy is with her, they will have each other for now.”
“Now, as I was saying, most Alphas understand that they gotta use a rubber, but some are just stubborn. They prefer natural, and really get into it.” Steve blushes. “There’s a medicine, not approved by any medical institution yet but it’s proven effective for Omegas. A little tablet that stops pregnancy. Would you be willing to take it?”
“Then we need to go.
Tony hand feeds him some fruit while they rest. It’s some sort of Alpha thing, Steve presumes, the need to provide, so he lets him, accepting the bits of fruit that Tony brings to his lips. Tiny apple and orange slices, some grapes and cubes of mango. He particularly likes the mango, the smooth sticky sweetness that is unlike anything he’s tasted before. He licks at Tony’s fingers as he feeds him, enjoying the taste and smell of ‘
It’s polite, he thinks, the way Tony hovers between his doorframe, like he’s not sure if he’s allowed.
want an Alpha around.”
“One million.” Tony smiles, all teeth.
“I didn’t go into heat this year.” Steve says truthfully, irked that Tony had assumed.
Sometimes, Steve forgets how powerful Tony truly is, between his status, company, money and sheer willpower.
“Yes.”
So... UHH. Still a bit of a delay, trying to catch up on all the work and sleep I've missed. I pushed to finish this in lieu of July 4 though so that has to count for something, right? D:
He tries to push them out of his mind, but sometimes even the trees look like the ghosts in his past, and when he’s in it bad, he can hear their voices whisper in the wind that still makes him hesitate.
##########
That had been a doozy too, even now when someone could pay for his comfort, he couldn’t actually take it because of this body.
“Be careful.”
“But then we get this gorgeous Omega.” Tony winks at him and Steve rolls his eyes. He’s used to it at this point but it doesn’t stop the blush. “This little petite Omega who volunteers for a dangerous program without knowing if he would come out alive or not, and then gives his life for his country, to save thousands from death. Do you see how amazing that is? All of a sudden the world is forced to accept that Omegas aren’t these shy creatures. They can be as brave and noble as any other sex. You were a catalyst, Steve. You changed the world.”
And, being a Stark, he was allowed access to the exclusivity of it all.
“Found it.”
He’d read about homosexuality. Where it was fine these days when an Alpha-Alpha pair were married, or an Omega-Omega pair for that matter. Steve had never really thought them any ill, there were secretive pairings back in his neighborhood, and he’d wished them the best like any other couple.
“They’re papers. Y’know, like, I.D.s and stuff. Congratulations, you are officially alive and a U.S. citizen again.” Tony says, enthusiasm almost contained. “I tried to get them as close to the truth as I could get, or, okay maybe
The Curator follows after him, quickly lead off by Tony. He produces a paper with bank information. “The company’s bank account should suffice, if you’d like to copy it down-”
, I made a mistake. You might actually
Jasper doesn’t even look affected. “We’ve given him a little something you see. Nothing to worry about, it’s not dangerous. Just a little aphrodisiac for Omegas that make them more agreeable to Alphas.” Jasper smiles.
America, was never developed by anyone, and it was purely by chance that you’ve picked it up at all, isn’t that right?”
There’s something like a snarl but Stevos remains quiet. From his scans, some of the drones are going offline even while he performs another summersault in the air while fending off Pepper’s hysteria.
Steve smiles kindly at him. “The Howard I knew wouldn’t have been the same as your father.” An echo of what he’d first said about Howard to Tony during their brief disagreement about the man. He knows he’s treading on something close to Tony’s heart, an image of his father that had not yet been so revealed, as much as it was treasured. “What would you like to know?”
There’s the rustle of seats as some Alphas move to get up, auction concluded before the curator makes a hurried wave at the crowd. “Excuse me, Ladies and Gentlemen, if you would all kindly remain seated. Our gracious host has a last surprise for everyone.”
It works, Phil sighs in defeat. Steve has to carefully maintain feeling miserable to make sure that Phil doesn’t catch on to his glee.
“Silly mortal. I’ve told you already. A minor god needs only his Patrons to stay in form. I do not wish for more power, only enough to help those who truly need me.”
They give him some time to rest, but eventually they remove themselves from the bed, quiet sounds of shuffling clothes and buckles while Steve lazily covers on the bed. He’s aware of the sweat on his body, the slick between his legs, but he doesn’t want to bother with thinking about the consequences, doesn’t want to think about Bucky at home. He’ll have to shower, hide the smell of sex.
Tony pulls him up to nuzzle his neck, Steve does the same, getting a full hit of Tony’s earthy smell, of fresh clean air and what he imagines safety smells. The metallic tang, he realizes, must be from the arc reactor, an extra zest that mingles with Tony’s natural scent almost perfectly. From deep within the earth was metal, and deep within Tony Stark was Iron Man.
And it’s that sight that propels Tony. Shoving his cock into the hot heat of Stevos's mouth, he curls his hand onto his short hair and fucks his mouth for all it's worth.
“Ma'am” Steve nods solemnly at the Alpha female, who smiles politely all the same, though he can't shake off the feeling that she's watching him for something.
“Can’t be all that perfect?”
Steve sits on the offered single seat, plush with cushions, a table in between them where the cocoa is placed. Tony offers him a smile, and pushes the mug his way, which he accepts.
“Just this?” Steve jokes, which earns him a playful slap on the thigh.
Unperturbed by Tony’s lack of reaction, Jasper clears his throat and shows Tony a manila envelope. “I have all of your papers ready, Mr. Stark. All of his registrations are right here.”
billionaire.”
“Somehow, knowing you, makes a lot of sense.”
“Yeah, you do.” Another boy pipes up. “Y-y-ya t-talk l-like th-this a lot.” Close to a snigger.
Stevos looks at him with a pained expression. “Why?” It’s soft, hurt and a little petulant.
within the confines of Tony’s lab (servers?) or about as close to that. Even then, Steve wasn’t entirely sure what JARVIS was truly capable of, and Tony hadn’t seemed intent to explain. Almost like a secret, no one truly knew of JARVIS’s existence, save for a few, and even in passing. But Tony had also politely explained that JARVIS was no prisoner either, and free route through the internet and through Tony’s own data servers in Stark Industries. Tony described millions of processing power. Like a brain, Tony said, but faster at math and remembering information, he’d joked at the end but Steve knew it was true. So for JARVIS to pause as he did, Steve couldn’t help but think there was more to it.
He presses it in, gasping as the lack of lubrication makes the entry tantalizingly slow, the burn of rubber against his walls feel alien, feels almost like it’s too much. Steve grits his teeth as he works it in himself, pulling and pushing the rod into his hole, a pleasurable buzz as his body concedes and makes way for the intrusion.
Black Widow is brutal with her attacks, it takes about fifteen seconds for Steve to realize that as he blocks one jab after the next, looking for an opening to push back and regain his ground but she overwhelms him with her speed. He manages to put some distance between them when he rolls to the side as she comes jumping back at him. He can smell her surprise, a sharp tang in the air that makes him feel proud of the achievement at some base level but then she’s in his space all over again and he has to concentrate.
Surprised. Steve shrinks back. "Okay, I understand. I'm just here for you, Tony. However, you need me."
"Suppose it was unfair to call at such short notice. Flying hundreds of miles just to see me."
But his chest hurts, his core’s power nearly depleted with the amount of energy required to move the suit. He’s only guaranteed ten minutes of power, any more and it would drain the core completely, then the shrapnel would slowly find their way to his heart again, killing him at a snail’s pace. He’s had to remove the suit completely, before it drained any more power.
Tony splutters behind him. “
“Does that mean I get snuggles?” Tony teases, nudging at Steven’s legs with his knees, but quickly sobers up when he feels Steve stiffen. “It was a joke, Cap.”
Fury got what he wanted, he showed whoever doubted him that ‘
Clint only pukes once that night, and then curls up in Steve’s bed instead of his own when Steve had been busy cleaning up the mess in the toilet.
