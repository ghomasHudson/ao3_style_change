There was no response. It took him a moment before he realised what he’d done.
Steve waited, he didn't want to cut Tony off while he was pouring his heart out. He knew it could be cathartic to rant everything out, to get everything in the open. He knew this meant he had moved to a new level of trust. Tony had just bared his rawest wounds, had bared his soul to him. When it became evident he had finished he began to speak.
“Certainly sir,” came the reply, “Mr Stark is asking for the object to your right and three items back.”
Thor laughed, “It is indeed a potent brew.” This time a real snort of laughter left Steve.
“Are you feeling well, sir?” JARVIS asked. “I sense an elevated heart rate and temperature.”
“We know he’s somewhere in the Amazon basin!” Steve shouted as he slammed his fist into the table. Fury regarded him calmly with his good eye.
Natasha looked at him, “Once you get this over and done with it'll get easier.”
“Fury, you saw what happened in Seattle. It was blind
It had also proved extremely useful as a hunting tool, with many hours of practice finally wielding its first reward in the form of a decently sized fish speared out of the river he was following. He’d had to cut his pants at the knees so he didn’t have warm, wet fabric sticking to his legs all the time, but the temperature was hot enough that it didn’t matter. He’d stopped being aware of the myriad scratches and cuts he was collecting on his unprotected legs, and the cut material of his pants worked as a crude water filter, allowing the water to pass through while catching larger particles. He’d even started to become a little more proficient at making crude bark bowls, which didn’t burn in the fire so long as there was water in them. He tried to boil as much of his drinking water in them as possible.
Steve shifted, moving backwards slightly. “No, I mean yes, but... not yet.” He looked at Tony with a slightly anxious face.
He moved his hands to the sides of the casing.
The door moved, opened just enough to let him in and then closed again.
“Uhh, nothing. I dunno what you're talking about. Oh, is that dinner?” he said in quick succession, obviously trying to divert Steve's attention.
Steve blushed, smiling genuinely this time. He was glad Tony’s sense of humour was still strong as ever – his friend was going to be ok.
“How?” Steve asked quickly.
Steve moved towards Tony who sat down by his workbench, head in his hands.
Tony looked at them all for a moment. “I want my lawyer. JARVIS, help me out here!”
Steve's thoughts were racing as he sped towards New York. It had taken him a couple of days to recover from his injuries and get his head in shape, but as soon as he was discharged from hospital he knew he had to get to Stark tower. He had to see Tony, make sure he was alive, and make sure he had at least eaten since the SHIELD and Hydra documents went online. He wasn't sure what state he would find his friend in. Natasha was due to appear at an extremely important hearing soon, Steve was lucky in that she'd already got to Clint. Thor was off world for something or other and wasn't contactable, and Bruce... well Bruce they'd need to tackle as a team. Natasha left Tony to him, on Steve's request, for which he was grateful. He needed to know he was ok.
“Aye, if we have no way to decipher where this machine has sent the Man of Iron, then we must take it upon ourselves to hunt him down,” Thor added. The large man was obviously restless, he and Tony had become firm friends after the battle of Manhattan.
Steve pressed his hand against Tony's forehead, “Gees, you're freezing! Let's get you up to your room and warmed up.”
Seconds later there was a loud screech and roiling clouds of steam filled the air, reducing visibility to mere meters.
Tony placed the helmet Steve was holding out on his head and swung his leg over the back of the motorbike. He wound his arms around Steve's waist and held tight as they took off down the road.
Steve confidently strode into the lab, putting down the food on one of the workbenches.
They ate their delicious food with gusto, and Tony refused to let Steve even offer to pay.
“Weeellllll,” Tony drew out, “I go into cardiac arrest, but it’s nothing I haven’t done before. I mean really, it’s not that bad-“
“That's all the shield,” came the reply, a slight colour coming to Steve's cheeks. He still found it strange to be praised for his physical ability.
Steve walked through Manhattan just taking in 21st Century life, he enjoyed watching people go about their days and wondering what their lives were like. He stopped outside a building site, rubble being moved out of the way and steel girders being positioned. The place where a building had collapsed and trapped he and Tony for nearly two days. He pondered everything that had happened since then. Tony, the son of one of his best friends, whom he'd never expected to call a friend, had become the person in the Avengers he enjoyed being around the most and who had become one of the closest friends he had ever had. They'd spent a lot of time together since they revealed themselves trapped in the rubble, and what had resulted was a deep connection of understanding. Steve had seen his soldiers cope with traumas and knew how to be there for Tony, how to help him through his emotions without making him feel like a child. He felt a great sense of privilege knowing that Tony allowed him to see past his snarky, I-don't-care façade to the damaged, hurting person underneath. To the childlike excitement that raced behind his eyes when he thought of a new idea, to the calm man who needed some time to relax. He turned away from the building site and continued walking. He'd been watching Tony transform from a man plagued by memories and regrets who couldn't deal with his mental trauma to a man who was at terms with everything that had happened to him and now had more healthy outlets to pursue when he felt life was building up on him again. He was oddly proud to see him growing in confidence. Not his pesudo-confidence for the press, but real genuine self-esteem. Especially since Pepper left. Steve realised he even felt a little protective over Tony.
Steve put on a brave face and smiled brightly, “Hey Tony.” He walked over to stand by the bed, “How’re ya feeling?”
They held their gaze slightly longer than comfortable before Tony stepped forward suddenly to tinker with something.
“Ok, ok,” he said, resigned. “I'm spider proofing it,” he murmured, as quietly as possible.
Steve looked a little confused, “Huh?”
“Some kind of elemental or something,” came Black Widow’s reply.
“You ok? I know it would have been your anniversary today, I wanted to come and check on you.”
Steve shifted, trying not to look at Tony.
“Look, you just swipe here, and then tap that, and then type in this,” he demonstrated.
Tony nodded and turned the car around, knowing what was coming next as Bruce headed off down the road in the direction of the SUV.
.” Tony was surrounded by a roaring sound painfully loud. Suddenly the noise stopped and he felt his ears pop. He blinked, stunned.
Steve walked down the stairs to Tony's lab on his nightly check. Sure enough he found Tony asleep on the workbench, an empty scotch bottle beside him with a little left in a glass. He let out a slight sigh as he smiled at the sight of Tony so peaceful. Such a difference from his larger than life persona. He walked over and scooped Tony up from his chair, carrying him up to his room. As he lay him down on his bed and moved to tuck him in Tony stirred. He opened his eyes a crack and struggled to focus on Steve.
The two men pulled apart breathing hard, startled by the interruption.
Bruce gave him a look Steve had hoped never to have seen again, “How did you do it, Steve?” he whispered.
“Hey Tony, I’ve got something for you,” he said, and Tony looked at him in excitement.
In the weeks that followed Tony was in and out of medical examinations making sure he was improving. He started to put on weight through an extremely carefully managed dietary plan, with the insistence of the doctors that his body would reject most foods if he just tried to jump back in to his old ways headlong.
All of the Avengers knew that Bruce had deliberately avoided the implication that Tony may not have landed on a continent at all. Or possibly not even the planet.
Tony gave him a playful punch on the arm and spoke through a mouthful of burger, “Seriously, stop being so modest, you make it feel like
Bruce slammed the chart down on the desk, “Do you really wish to argue the point with me?” he snarled. “I'm sure you've heard of me. Bruce Banner.”
Steve pointed at a post with some different coloured arrows on it, “We're following the blue.”
Bruce moved between his different experiments, occasionally glancing up at Steve. He asked a few leading questions about the battle, trying to get Steve to open up.
“Tony, I'm pretty sure you can hear me, and I wanted to get all of this off of my chest. I know this will make things awkward for you, and I know it will probably stop you being able to confide in me, but I don't think I can hold it in any longer, especially after what has happened to you.”
Steve closed his eyes as an ache throbbed through his head; he had forgotten just how awful hangovers really felt. He slowly shuffled to a free seat around the tablet, dropping down into it with no grace and roughly propping up his head with an arm resting on the table. He looked over at Thor who was watching him as he stuffed another slice of toast into his mouth.
“Iron Man.”
Tony took a moment before smiling, “Well how else would people appreciate my genius if they didn't know what I was going on about?”
“No, listen to me.” Tony shifted, his heart beating fast. “I – I heard you at the hospital.”
His shoulders dropped and he looked at Clint with tears in his eyes, “He
“Yeah yeah, I'm fine,” he replied sleepily, as he visibly shivered.
“I know you appreciate your new pistol!” Tony called out after her.
Steve turned it over in his hands. So far not a single model had been able to stand up to his super soldier strength, and a lot of the time he hadn't even been
“Then I suggest you practice more.”
Bruce rubbed at his chin, “So, we need to find out what that machine was, and we need to run the data to find out where it could have sent him.”
“Well, he should hopefully know what continent he’s on,” Bruce said, looking at the ground.
He heard Steve's chirpy voice, “So, I was thinking dinner for Friday?”
Steve started to go a little pink, “Well, they are essentially people. They deserve the same manners.”
Later Steve lay in Tony's bed, his lover lying against him with his hand on his chest, Steve's arm around his shoulder. Both exhausted and completely happy they lay holding each other.
“Fair enough,” Natasha replied with a slight nod of her head, “Makes sense. So what are you doing in here all the time then?”
Steve shrugged and looked up at her, “They get a little lonely when Tony’s not spoiling them rotten.”
“Flat head screwdriver, please.”
“Steve,” he said, standing up.
“Trying to capture any information from the lab cameras,” Steve called in, watching the recording intently to see if you could make anything out that they hadn't already gleaned from hours of extensive running and re-running of data.
“The reason I listen, the reason I care, Tony, isn't just because I want to help people. It isn't to get you to shut up. I care about you. I don't see you as some spoilt child. When I look at you I see brilliance and loyalty, passion and love for life. I don't see you as some broken toy. I see you as one of the best people I've ever known. I know that to you I am a friend, I am a person to confide in, and I've spent the longest time trying to control these feelings so you don't lose that, but I just can't any more. I have to let you know before I lose you, I don't want to be left wondering what if. I already have too many of those. So, I guess what I've been leading up to is this. I love you Tony. It's come on slow, but you've got a firm grasp on my heart and I just can't ignore that. I know you couldn't feel the same about me after all of our history, but I just wanted to let you know. I probably won't be coming back to see you, I couldn't deal with the rejection, but I'll be making sure I know how you're doing. I'd appreciate it if you could just pretend this conversation never happened when you get back to the tower. It'll make it easier for everyone.”
He saw Tony’s eyes crease in pain, “Steve-”
“So how is living in DC?”
Tony looked at him, waving a screwdriver in his direction, “Just because I am into women does not mean I can't be into guys as well you know, it's not the forties any more,” but there was no malice in his eyes, just a smile. “And I could say the same thing about Peggy.”
“Ahhhh, Black Widow,” came Doom’s voice. “You really think I would have let you catch me so easily?”
The two men laughed together.
“Yep, threat neutralised. It doesn’t seem to enjoy being soaking wet, SHIELD are going to have a whole new set of problems to tackle looking after this thing.”
“Oh come on, he does spoil you. There is no way you need a full tune up every two weeks.”
Steve smiled a little as Tony laughed. He walked towards him. Tony suddenly became self conscious as he noticed Steve's eyes flick to his arc reactor, on display without a protective shirt hiding it away. He reflexively covered it with a hand as he looked for his shirt on the ground.
Tony continued rambling as he flicked through huge amounts of information. Steve leaned against a worktop and watched, knowing Tony was badly on edge. Hell, of course he was. JARVIS’ voice came through the room.
He turned to the mother again, patting his pockets, “I'm sorry, I don't appear to have a pen. Do you have one in your bag maybe?”
Thor's smile spread from ear to ear as he walked out of the room to call Jane and arrange to go and see their new holiday home.
The others looked at Tony with a little disbelief for admitting something like that as Steve spoke.
“Tony, you really don't ha-”
“Fine, I'll ask out Captain fucking America, only to be rejected and make everything awkward for everyone,” he said snappily. “Happy now?”
Natasha looked at him, “If he crashes and kills himself in that thing, I'm blaming you.” She sauntered out of the room, taking the same route Clint had.
Steve suddenly felt nauseous as the meaning sank in, “You mean...?”
Clint put a bright smile on his face, “Steve, what are you doing? You know Tony would kill you for playing this in the tower, right?”
As the car was driving them back to the Stark Tower it began to rain. As they got out of the car, Steve grabbed Tony's hand and they ran into the Tower, laughing and sopping wet. They jumped in the elevator as Tony peeled off his soaked jacket. As it started going up the two men looked at each other, their laughter quieting. They looked at each other for a moment before they slowly met in a gentle kiss. Tony's hands moved to Steve's waist, as Steve cupped Tony's face. Electricity raced between them, both of their hearts pounding. After what felt like an eternity they pulled apart.
He spoke quietly, “Why do you even put up with me?”
“Something must be done to retrieve our comrade,” Thor growled.
Steve looked at him and realised the seriousness in Tony's eyes. He nodded, “Challenge accepted.”
He sighed and all the rage left him, “I’m sorry, I just... I just can’t lose another friend.”
“Why has Tony Stark not been working with you recently?”
“I just want him back,” Steve whispered.
“Hi Tony, dinner’s here.” Tony grunted in response. Steve noticed in amusement that he was indeed wearing a pair of safety goggles and couldn’t stop himself from smiling.
Tony looked at him and said sincerely and softly, “You thought wrong.”
“Widow,” he called into his comm, “How are you doing up there?”
“Widow.”
“Sure you can,” Tony said, “It’s really easy. You’ve just got to unplug one wire and plug another one in.”
Steve recognised Tony's attempt to lighten the burden, to move away from the pain that threatened to swallow them both. He appreciated it. “It was fine. I don't really have anywhere to stay now though. To be honest, it was lonely. I mean, I saw Natasha all the time, but every day it was back to my same empty apartment. I'm looking for somewhere else to stay now, try and rebuild everything again.” Steve's chest hurt as he voiced that. Once again he had to start over.
There was a knock on the table as Bruce put down his plate of bacon and eggs, sliding into the chair beside Steve. They shared a reassuring glance, and Steve squeezed Bruce’s shoulder.
Natasha smiled softly, “Come on Cap, dinner arrived a few minutes ago. Come eat with us tonight.”
He saw a new smile break on Steve's face as he turned towards his lab.
“Want to stay with me tonight?” Tony asked quietly.
Steve sighed and picked up the food, heading towards the elevator.
Steve laid his hand on his arm as Tony began to eat his roast beef with enthusiasm.
Winter came in fast, the summer colours changing to reds and yellows and browns before disappearing all seemingly in the blink of an eye. Steve got used to pulling Tony out of the way of walls and lampposts when he was wearing his uniform and Tony worked on getting his project perfect. They'd been out to a few places, an art gallery or the Tesla museum, but mostly they enjoyed going out for long walks, bike rides to the middle of nowhere or watching movies together. The other Avengers were quietly happy watching their friends so happy together, especially after the amount of pining they'd had to wade through before. They often walked in on Tony showing Steve how to work some new gadget or Steve trying to get Tony to sit still as he drew him. Steve still had to carry him to bed most nights.
Tony shrugged, “I didn't really notice how cold it was until we were on the way back.”
Steve stepped out of the ring and grabbed a towel, “Everything ok JARVIS?”
“Nice look Cap,” he said smoothly, “Maybe I should just make you some hot pants next time to stop my wonderful inventions getting ruined again.” He was glad his visor concealed the fact he was bright red and failing woefully at keeping his heartbeat down.
Tony lay his head on the table, and Steve could hear him trying to swallow the sobs.
Tony stood up and stretched, regarding the now sitting Steve fondly, a pensive smile dancing across his lips. He stood for a few seconds before Steve sensed him and looked up from his book.
He sighed, “I’m sorry about last night Thor. I was
“How are you doing?” she asked softly.
He practically barged through the door of the doctor's office, and found Dr Neglectful MD standing uncomfortably close to one of the nurses. She looked at Bruce with what looked like relief before turning and running out of the office.
Steve turned and looked at him, concerned, “Are you ok?”
“It's going to be nice having you back, Tony,” Bruce smiled.
“Of course I'd never judge you. You're my Tony. Now,” Steve took his hand, “you have a tower full of friends who haven't seen you in days. We should at least say good night.”
Tony took a moment before replying, “I just love the way you treat my robots.”
He walked round to the other side of the bed as Tony laid down again, kicked off his sneakers and climbed in under the comforter. He moved to lie behind Tony, wrapping an arm around the smaller man. He felt Tony relax and soon his breathing became deep and regular, while Steve lay still, his head on the pillow, his mind racing.
“I don't want people to think I'm weak,” he said, quietly. “Especially not you.”
“Ahh! Steve,” he said, smiling. Steve winced as it showed just how much weight Tony had lost, his cheekbones creating hollows on his face.
Steve let out a breathy laugh before looking back down at the arc reactor in his hand. He went quiet, really taking in the structure. It was fairly weighty, Steve couldn’t imagine the feeling of having it in his chest.
“He's stable,” came the surgeon's reply. Natasha saw the relief in Steve's shoulders, as his eyes begin to well again. “But he suffered terrible injuries, it's going to take him a long time to recover. There were a couple of complications caused by the location of the injuries, but he should survive. The next few days are critical.”
person has to deal with.”
“It’s just an idea, but there’s a possibility we can track him through his arc reactor.”
Tony smiled softly to himself. As he left the gym he heard Steve start with the punching bag again.
The two men stood there awkwardly, looking at each other. Close enough to feel each others breath. Tony broke first.
In a last desperate attempt, Thor turned to Bruce.
Tony sniffed and gave a smile. Steve leaned in and touched his lips against the smaller man's softly and gently.
“How do you think your friends will fare with another of their team mates fallen?” he said, his tone chilling.
He walked softly down the corridor towards Bruce's reinforced lab, took a deep breath as much to keep control of himself as comfort Bruce, and opened the door. His heart broke into more pieces when he caught sight of the view inside, something he didn't think was possible after all that had already happened today. He looked at the curled up, naked form of Dr Banner in the middle of the room, nothing left intact and the lights flickering. The entire contents of the lab had been turned to rubble, Steve could see blood on Bruce's knees and hands where he had dropped exhausted onto the ground and cut himself on the sharp pieces of destroyed equipment. Steve saw the vulnerable body shudder and heard the pained sobs coming from his friend, he seemed reduced to a lost child who couldn't escape the nightmare he found himself in.
“I just can't be bothered taking it all the way down to him,” Natasha sighed, looking at the stacked plate of roast pork, potatoes, veggies and gravy. “Clint and I were literally just about to go do some training anyway.”
Steve worked away at the punching bag, trying to vent the strange feeling he had in the pit of his stomach. Tony had been great tolerating his complete ineptitude with anything technological, but Steve felt like he must just be annoying the genius himself. Tony had told him multiple times he didn't mind helping him figure things out, and once or twice had mentioned the word adorable, but Steve knew Tony was a professional faker. He punched harder at the bag. Hell, Tony had been almost silent the whole way through the latest movie night, only giving him the barest answers when Steve asked him a question, whereas he'd usually be laughing and joking the whole way through and making fun of Steve if he couldn't keep up. Then Tony had fallen asleep on his shoulder, and he'd been too scared to move. Too scared he'd wake Tony up and he'd lose the contact. Of course Tony didn't feel for him, and he'd never tell him, but he relished being able to have that closeness. Steve had woken up sometime after the movie finished to find the rest of the Avengers gone and himself and Tony draped in a blanket. He'd gently picked up Tony and put him in his own bed, before retreating to the kitchen to get something to eat and try to keep his mind off of the squeeze in his chest.
“Go away,” came a low, slurred response from the figure on the couch. “I’m busy.”
Steve pulled in to a mostly empty gravel parking area and the two men climbed off the bike. Tony took his helmet off and attached it to a strap on the bike as Steve took out his own backpack from the saddle bag.
“Thanks,” Steve said sheepishly. He smiled, “Next time I ask for Asgardian mead though, please don’t actually bring me any. I forgot how bad the day after can be.”
“You could have been killed, Tony! You are not ready to be in that suit, and those burns are damn proof of that!”
“Careful, that's coming awfully close to slander,” came the doctor's smirk back.
Clint opened the door to Steve’s apartment and took in the scene. Steve was standing in the middle of the room with his eyes closed, standing stock still. Clint smiled wanly.
“No!” said Steve, more forcefully. “Stay here. We’ll be back soon, don’t come.”
Steve spent most of the next five days in the gym, trying to work out his nervous energy. He made sure to visit the barber to make sure his hair was freshly cut, and he washed his favourite outfit. His brown leather jacket was newly waxed and his shoes were just that little bit more shiny.
Laughter rang out through the room from all the Avengers.
Tony took another step forward, “I don't know how you missed it Steve. I don't know how you thought – I don't know how you didn't realise...”
Bruce smiled slightly, “I'm sure he's fine. He's being de-briefed at the moment, I'm sure you can see him once it's done.” Bruce paused, “Come on, I've got some stuff in my lab I'm working on, you can keep me company.”
Steve paused, reliving the moment where he saw Bucky fall, helpless to save his best friend, the only person who had stuck with him through everything, who had never dismissed him before he changed. “Genuinely? I don't know. I just... had to. There wasn't an option. Day by day. Just day by day.” He looked at his feet and raised his head, quietly talking to himself as much as Bruce, “I never imagined I would have to live through something this painful again. And here we are.”
“Mm?” came the contented reply.
Tony smiled at him, “No, I understand. We'll take it at your pace.”
He said in a small voice, “But they make me so ugly.”
Tony started in the direction the noise had come from. He tried to shout, but he was barely able to produce a croak. He cleared his throat and called out again, knowing it was futile but he knew with all of his heart that he was the closest to rescue right now that he was probably ever going to get. It felt like an age but soon the trees around him started to thin. Holding his arm up against the bright sun he finally cleared the forest, feeling a hysterical giggle escape his lips as he laid eyes on the wide dirt road he had walked onto. The packed, bare earth felt strange beneath his feet and he dropped to his knees, too exhausted to cry. He wasn't sure how long he stayed that way, but he knew he had to make a decision. He had no idea how well travelled the road was, but judging by the scale of it he knew that either direction would eventually lead him to some kind of civilisation. The difficult part was not knowing which direction would get him there faster. After playing an internal game of eeny-meeny-miney-mo he decided to go left. He pulled himself off the ground and started trudging. The sun beat down on him relentlessly as he was no longer protected by the canopy, but he knew he needed to stay on the road to have a chance of being seen.
“I’ve been so obnoxious,” he smiled and groaned, “I mean, playing Coldplay full tilt through the tower?
And nothing happened.
He laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder and shook gently, “Tony, wake up, it’s just a nightmare. Wake up.”
When Tony awoke it took him a few moments to gain his bearings and realise where he was. He started until he realised he was in the truck, the strong jungle sun beating through the window as he watched the trees blur past. His stomach rumbled as he stretched, before realising the driver was holding out a cereal bar for him. He managed a couple of bites before the sugary taste overwhelmed him and he had to put it down on the dashboard. Soon the trees gave way to fields, and Tony started to see farmers working out in them. Seeing people after so long on his own was difficult for him to adjust to, even though the farmers never even looked up at the truck as it trundled past. He felt himself drift in and out of sleep as they travelled.
That night they ate pizza on the couch together as they finished watching Return Of The King.
“I didn’t want to give up on you,” he choked, and suddenly found Tony in his arms, his face buried into his chest. Steve felt the dam break and wrapped his arms tightly around the thin little man as they both cried.
“Right,” Steve nodded. “JARVIS, could you put the schematics up on the screen please?”
By this point Bruce was back, Clint handing him the shorts and sweater he kept stashed just for him while in the field. He gladly took them.
"JARVIS, lower the volume please.” The music instantly lowered to a much more manageable level as Steve spun round to look at Clint.
He felt himself meet solid resistance, confused for a moment. He looked down and found himself curled in one of the creatures huge tentacles. He struggled against it, routing all the power through his thrusters but he was stuck. His arms were pinned to his sides, he couldn't fire off his repulsors at the creature and he was out of missiles. He tried to shake himself loose, but it wasn't working. He saw one of Clint's arrows explode a few meters down the tentacle, but it didn't seem to do anything. He could hear the others through the comm, but he was focusing on the restriction he could feel across his chest, squeezing the breath out of him. He was aware he was moving towards the creatures mouth, he struggled with higher urgency. As the creatures teeth bit down he felt his armour crack and buckle, hearing the ripping of metal. He screamed, heard Steve screaming “TONY!” through the comm and blacked out.
The colour quickly drained from the doctor's face as he stammered, picked up the chart and barely stopped himself running out of his office.
“Tony, you can’t. We can handle this.” He struggled to keep his voice level, going for a low growl rather than the shouts he so wanted to unleash.
“Hey kid, I saw you recognise me, you want an autograph or something?” he said, before looking at the wary looking woman and shaking her hand, “Bruce Banner.” Shaking her hand calmly took all of the willpower he had left. He looked down at the boy again and smiled, mentally running over the signs in his head. There were bruises, both fresh and old on his arms, partially covered by his t-shirt. His eyes were full of fear, and when his mother moved he flinched slightly. He had been that same little boy once, only it was his father, not his mother who took out his anger on him.
The video stopped playing and the Avengers stared in silence. Steve had ushered them all into his studio and asked JARVIS to play the footage through the projector Tony had had installed. Pepper was stuck in very intense negotiations with important officials in Asia regarding Stark Industries factories and distribution and he hadn’t been able to get through to her. Steve hadn’t told them what had happened or why they were there, but they all knew it wasn’t good.
“Hi, Stark Tower?” came a voice through the phone.
After a particularly tiring and disgusting encounter with some kind of self-replicating slime creature, the team had been shuffled through into a press conference room and into their seats. They still dripped ooze from some places, Clint wiped some off his shoulder and onto the table cover by his microphone, the stuff was obscenely sticky and seemed to be attracted to skin. The whole team was in a foul mood, facing potentially hours of scalding decontam showers at SHIELD.
On cue, the guests all rose and waited for the doors to open. They almost jumped as the music blared out of the speakers. The riff for Back in Black came out strong and hard as the doors opened to reveal Tony in a beautifully tailored black Tuxedo. The smile that broke on Steve's face could have out shone the sun.
“Oh?” His voice sounded small.
Tony continued to move vast amounts of text across the screen, “Everything in here is of interest to me.”
“Hey buddy, look at me. When did you last get looked at?” he asked.
Steve was confused for a moment. “That's not embarrassing.”
Steve sat down beside him.
“Hawkeye.”
“This is the direct line to JARVIS, who is calling? I do not recognise this number.”
“Awesome,” came Tony's half asleep answer.
Bruce looked at him, “It's... not that simple, Thor. In fact it's probably one of the most confusing things any
It had been a long time since Tony went for a simple hike through the woods, and allowing himself time to take it all in without technology getting in the way was more relaxing than he imagined it could be. Steve loved to point out any interesting wildlife or plants, and his overwhelming enthusiasm was impossible to resist. After around one and a half hours they wandered into a small grassy glade by a stream and Steve took off his backpack. He rummaged for a moment before getting out a blanket and laying it down. He sat down as Tony followed suit and told him to check his backpack. Soon there were sandwiches and yoghurt and fruit in tubs sitting on the blanket as the two men tucked into the picnic.
Tony stumbled over a tree root and couldn't muster the energy to swear. Breathing heavily he leant against the trunk, resting his forehead on his arm. He'd had lost count of the days and weeks as he tried to keep moving, only knowing it was so long due to unpleasant reaction his skin was having to the flaking arc reactor. He idly wondered how much longer he could take it, whether it would just be easier to sit between the buttresses of a giant tree and accept what was going to happen rather than stumble his way through the forest until he couldn't go any further.
Steve paled as that realisation crept over him.
Steve respectfully stayed silent, but he didn't want to leave. Tony had been down here for days, he'd even missed dinner with the team. He wanted to take care of him, and he knew Tony was on the verge of either talking to him or making it extremely clear that Steve was to leave. He waited.
Tony smiled another fake smile as people came up to him asking for pictures and autographs. Journalists wandered the hall to capture photographs of all of the Avengers in their formal wear as they attended another function put on to reward them for yet more heroic acts. Steve looked over and saw the obvious tedium in Tony's eyes, even from where he was standing talking to two very nice ladies in gowns. He politely excused himself and walked over to join Tony, posing for a photograph as a papparazo called their names.
The room went silent again, trying to figure out how they were going to find their friend. Steve felt the frustration building again until he couldn’t hold it it.
Steve’s expression could have melted steel, “We’re taking another trip to SHIELD HQ.”
“Look, if I can't spend my vast fortune on my friends then what use is it?” Tony said, exasperated.
Every time Cap went to ask Iron Man a question or ask for an update he felt a fist squeeze his heart painfully. He clenched his teeth and pushed the thought of Tony lost and alone from his mind as he rounded and slammed the edge of his shield into a bot, causing sparks to fly as it dropped to the ground.
“I'm fine,” Tony replied wearily, “I just need some air.”
Tony turned towards him smirking, holding an icepack to his arm, “And let you get toasted? No thanks.”
“Yes Captain?”
Tony dropped the circuit board he was working on onto the worktop, frustrated. He just couldn't get his head straight.
He took a deep breath, “So you haven't got to the list of people on the Insight targeting system?”
Tony nodded, grateful that Steve didn't feel the need to hide him away, nor to force the others upon him after such an emotional event.
Steve's fists balled tightly, “He survived. He was caught by Hydra, they took his memory, froze him, and turned him into an assassin. He tried to kill me, but... but he's in there. He recognised me. I'm going to try and find him once this blows over a bit.”
“Tony, I won’t. I don’t want to screw it up. I think it’s best if the doctor does it.”
Tony had wires all over him, drips in his arm, salve on his blistered, sunburnt skin. His beard, and hair, had been shaved completely. Steve counted no less than five separate sets of stitches just from his chest upwards.
Tony looked sharply at Steve, “Bucky?”
When they arrived back at the tower the rest of the team were there to meet them, as well as Fury and Coulson. Tony was attacked by hugs, wincing as he felt his still healing wounds protest. He noticed Steve stay slightly back, shifting awkwardly, only joining in when Tony shot him a you-get-here-right-now look. They dragged him up to the sitting room where they'd laid out all his favourite snacks and a dozen different flavours of pop since he couldn't drink for another few weeks. Steve sat on another couch, and the two awkwardly made eye contact a few times, Steve always readjusting himself uncomfortably. Tony felt like he could burst, but he just didn't know how to fix this with all of the others giving them no chance to talk.
For a moment Fury wasn’t sure if he’d crossed the line. The rest of the Avengers glared at him with pure unadulterated fury, Clint holding Bruce’s forearm with white knuckles. Static electricity crackled in the air. Eventually Steve sighed and took a step back. The others followed him out of the office, but their expressions never changed.
“Thank you… For not giving up on me. JARVIS told me you came down to talk to my bots while I was gone. That… means a lot.” Tony looked over at Steve who turned his eyes down and smiled faintly.
“Thanks.”
She dodged a volley of shots, still retreating, until she finally found her heel against the edge of the roof. Another curse, she pulled out another pistol and fought back as hard as she could, but when the explosion hit at her feet she had no chance. She was hurled back off the roof, and then she was plunging to the ground.
Tony huddled in with his back against the tree, nestled in as tightly as possible between the buttresses of the giant emergent. He absentmindedly scratched at skin around the arc reactor and started when he saw his damp fingers come away stained. He looked down at his chest and saw the red-brown blooms of rust which had started to take hold on the metal casing of the reactor. He cursed, he thought the reactor was pretty rust resistant, but with any alloy that contained iron rust was a risk. The coating must have got scratched in the days he had been walking through the forest, and in such a damp environment it was a perfect opportunity for rust to get in and grow. He had been so focused on finding some kind of waterway and keeping himself hydrated and somewhat fed, if some berries or fruit few and far between counted, that he hadn’t noticed it taking hold. He ran through a diagnostic in his mind as he checked the reactor.
“Well, you certainly said it earlier,” Tony remarked with a cheeky smile.
“Hey, no problem. Honestly, I was expecting you to take longer than this to get used to everything.”
Steve gently turned Tony around and lifted his chin.
Steve looked at him, concerned, “Are you ok Tony?”
“Get out!” he shouted and turned away, obviously fuming.
“No,” he directed at him.
“Whatever gave you that idea?” Tony replied, sparkle returning to his eyes.
“Yeah. Well, it turns out he's not a ghost story.” He took a deep breath, “It also turns out he's Bucky.”
“Yeah?”
A few minutes later Steve stood up and wandered across to one of the worktops on the other side of the lab. He moved a few things before getting slightly upset.
“Thanks,” he breathed, the cooler air feeling much more comfortable in his lungs, steam rising from him in plumes. “Now get back here so we can at least get a plan going.”
Tony got back on his feet and flew through the Iron Man sized hole in the wall to stick another Doom bot full of rockets. “I'm fine Cap. Just a minor mishap. All good.”
Tony winked at him, “Unless you're the one who did the tying.”
Tony continued to trudge along the road, his only change of salvation, even through the torrential downpour of the mid-afternoon. He was so used to be wet all the time he barely registered it, though the beating of the raindrops was much more intense without the shelter of the trees. The rain roared as it turned the surface of the road slick, and he had to be careful not to slip in the mud. Absorbed in his thoughts he didn't notice the change in cadence of the roaring until it became too loud for him to ignore. He started and looked behind him wildly. He could see the figure of a truck coming up behind him. He froze for a moment in relief before shaking his head and starting to wave his arms and shout. He ran into the middle of the road continuing to make as much noise as he could while jumping up and down, waving his arms. As the truck reached him it slowed, but it didn't stop. He moved from the middle of the road to avoid being run over. The truck rolled up to him but still wasn't stopping. He saw the driver looked suspiciously out of the window at him. He realised he was in the depths of the jungle and he probably looked like a crazy possible murderer. He tried to figure out how to make it obvious he wasn't a threat, before suddenly having a realisation and pulling the tied-on goggles away from his arc reactor. It took a moment, but he saw the driver's eyes widen in recognition. The truck stopped and he ran around to the other side, trying not to slip in the mud and pulled himself into the cab of the truck, pulling the door closed behind him.
“You are in danger of falling into a stupor,” came Thor’s voice from the doorway. A glass smashed into the wall beside him. “Know I will not relent to your requests for Asgardian mead in the future.”
Thor seemed to be enjoying the epic more than most of the movies they watched together, loudly voicing his approval or unhappiness at certain parts of the film. Clint, although he'd seen the movies multiple times, always whooped when Legolas did something vaguely awesome and Natasha seemed to find Aragorn very appealing. Bruce was definitely on Sam's team. Steve mostly watched quietly, occasionally asking a whispered question to Tony if he wasn't quite sure on something. He was completely in awe of the world on screen. Tony himself watched uncharacteristically silent, only breaking to answer Steve's questions. He was too busy trying to ignore the electric feeling in his stomach every time Steve reached across him to get to the popcorn, or when their arms brushed slightly.
He retreated into his thoughts, trying to remember any survival knowledge for this environment. He was taught from a young age how to protect himself should be find himself in certain situations, and since his experience in Afghanistan and building the armour he had worked hard to make himself feel invincible. One thing he had not trained for, however, was magically ending up in the middle of an unknown rainforest without his armour, without his phone and with no reference point for his friends to find him. He patted himself down, checking for injuries or anything else that might cause a problem. What he found instead was a bulge in one of his pants pockets. He reached in and pulled out a multi tool. He looked at the item in shocked confusion for a moment before letting a laugh escape his lips. He always had his penknife on him, just for the comfort of having tools at hand for any tinkering that might need done. It was such an ingrained habit that he’d completely forgotten that he had it. Maybe, just maybe, he had a chance.
Tony tried to ignore him, purposefully not replying. The last thing he needed right now was to get distracted by Steve.
The room went silent at the noise of the phone hitting the floor. Steve was already on his feet and moving to the phone while Natasha was quickly heading for Bruce who had gone completely white. As she put an arm around his chest to stop him from collapsing Steve spoke into the phone.
Natasha looked at him. “You're not as good an actor was you think Stark.” She crossed her arms. “And besides, if you think you've fooled anyone with your pining over Steve then you're stupider than we all thought.”
He groaned and sat up as Steve's voice came through the comm, a hint of panic in his voice, “Tony, are you ok? What happened?”
After a few hours he politely retired to his lab, overwhelmed with the huge amount of attention in such a short space of time after the monotony of the hospital. Everyone understood he needed to get back to his lab and fix something after so long without any ability to hands-on invent.
“They tied me to a
The woman looked at him and started to rummage in her bag, “Sure.” Was she making eyes at him? He took her distraction as an opportunity to slide a card in the kid's hand, and used a sharpie to write out another number quickly. He closed the child's hand around it and motioned for him to put it in his pocket. As the mother was making frustrated noises he whispered to the boy, “Those are numbers where people can help you if you ever need it, and my number so if you ever need me or the Avengers you can call me right up and we'll come and get you."
“Huh?” came Tony's reply, as he looked up to see Steve placing a couple of strips of bacon on a plate set at Tony's place. His mind struggled to catch up.
“No, wait.”
Steve walked over to the sink and filled a glass of water. He handed it to Tony, “Yeah, I don't think any of us are particularly thrilled about that revelation.” He sighed as Tony downed the glass of water in one, “How far into the files have you got?”
Steve’s expression hardened for a moment, “Will, Clint. Tony
He shook off the fog that threatened to cloud his mind and squared his jaw.
“JARVIS, could you help me out a little here, please?”
“So what exactly happened with Tony?”
Bruce growled at the doctor, “My friend is writhing in pain because you don't have the time of day to stop preying on the nurses, care to explain yourself?”
Strips of pants material were steaming dry over the fire, Tony had cleaned them in some of the hot water he’d intended to use for drinking. Instead the rest of the hot water had been used to clean his wound, he winced as the hot water set pain lancing through his foot and cleaned away the layers of much and dirt from the toe making sure the whole area was as clean as he could get it. He’d also cleaned off the metal bottle opener from his multitool. He’d measured it against his toe and one or two presses should cauterise the whole area the nail had once occupied, then he placed it on the edge of the fire pit to get the metal as hot as he could.
The music faded as he reached level with Steve, whom he turned to face. He took in a deep breath, running his eyes up and down his lover's body.
Tony looked at him and paused, terrified he would both say and not say what he desperately wanted to. “Thanks Steve,” he said sincerely after a moment, before looking back down into his coffee.
Tony turned to Steve, lastly.
“I know,” came the soft reply.
Steve smiled and turned his head to look down at Tony, “It's true though, I really do.”
Tony started to speak.
“When I got back from Afghanistan I was broken, Steve. I was broken. A man died to save me. Why? Men were killed by what I did. It's my fault. And when I got back, I found out that the one man I trusted, who was like a dad to me, had organised the whole thing because I was nothing but a nuisance to him.”
Tony thought for a second, “Well, there was the incident with the birthday cake.”
Steve braced himself as he saw the grenade like item land a few meters away. It exploded into a painful barrage of needle like water droplets, drenching Steve and giving him enough space and time to get off of the melting asphalt of the road and towards a more sheltered position.
“Ahh Steve!” he said as Steve walked over to give him a quick kiss.
Tony nodded slowly and started to get up, waving a hand dismissively, “I’m seeing a therapist. Wait, does Bruce count as a therapist? Anyway, I’m seeing one.”
Tony stopped and glared up at him, “I’m well enough.”
Steve raised an eyebrow, “Are you asking me on a date, Stark?” He was shocked at himself for being so forward.
Tony glared at the ceiling, “Traitor.”
Steve turned as Tony began to walk towards to the door, “By the way Tony, next time you're tied to a chair you can always call me instead of Pepper. I'd probably get there quicker.”
This time Clint had to keep the pain out of his eyes. “That was the idea, actually,” Steve said, his voice small and a distant smile briefly played over his lips, “I figured if he knew what I was doing he’d come back out of sheer will to make me stop.”
He stepped closer to Steve again, only a few inches between them. He looked up into Steve's eyes.
He looked at Bruce and something passed between them, understanding, sympathy, brotherhood. They both sat in silence, unstirring, silently mourning Tony Stark.
Tony sighed and ran a hand over his stubbled chin, “That was my next set of reading material. I needed to know what it was first before I delved in, to make sure I had everything straight. I take it you know who was on it?”
“He doesn’t have it, he left it on his lab bench for the experiment,” Steve explained. “He’s just got his pants, his shirt and his... his safety goggles.” He smiled wanly, remembering Tony’s jest.
Steve smiled and looked at the floor, “Me too,” he admitted.
Tony rolled his eyes, “I am fine, I got aloe and cold water on fast enough that it’s nothing serious. Trust me, if I held up to your workshop visit earlier then I’m all good.”
Tony looked at Steve for a moment before clapping a hand on his shoulder, “Thanks Steve.”
Clint flicked a fry at Bruce as the Avengers settled down into a post-battle come down. They'd ordered from their favourite take-out and taken over the kitchen with half-discarded bits of kit. Bruce laughed as the team went over their favourite parts of the fight, their preferred way of letting off steam.
“TONY!” she screamed through her comm, before realising that Tony wasn’t there. Tony wasn’t going to catch her like he had so many times before.
He sighed and leant back on the stool, gesturing to the pad of paper on the workbench, “Drawing, mostly.” He ran a hand through his hair, “Trying to keep my mind occupied with something less... painful.”
“I know what I’m doing, Steve,” he said, “I know you mean well, but just... just let me be me in my lab, k?”
“At least it was my fault this time and not some crazed kidnappers,” he mumbled aloud as he looked around again. He wished he could remember what was safe to eat. He felt his resolve strengthen, his first task was to find a stream or river. Follow the stream flow and he should eventually reach people or the sea. Both of those options were better than staying where he was and waiting for rescue because no one knew where he was in the first place.
Tony and Bruce were taking one of their Science Bros™ head-clearing country trips in Tony's beloved Acura, enjoying not being stuck in the labs on one of the hottest days of the year. As they were discussing new theories to distribute vaccinations and health care to some of the areas Bruce had been working in, they saw something large being thrown out of the SUV in front of them.
“I’m not hungry.”
“We- We don’t have a timeframe on that,” Steve said, trying to make himself come across as untroubled by that statement. It didn’t work.
Tony didn't even look up, “Nope, sorry.”
“Yes Captain, Mr Stark is fine.”
As soon as credits rolled all of the other Avengers seemed to have sudden excuses to leave straight away. They were tired, or had something important to work on, leaving Tony and Steve the last to filter out of the room. As they stood outside the door, readying themselves to walk to their rooms, they faced each other. They held eye contact for a few seconds longer than comfortable, and moved their heads together slightly, before Steve pulled back and sighed.
“Good news Legolas, they’re right here,” came a voice that stopped Steve’s heart for a moment.
“Dinner, Friday?” Steve asked again smiling.
“He created a new element to power it. As far as I know the only atoms of that element all exist within that arc reactor, and they should give out a unique signature. That combined with hopefully the amplification of the signal through the nature of the arc reactor and the metal casing should allow us to triangulate him to at least a vague area.”
His heart in his mouth he flew around the corner to see Steve standing defensively, with,
By the third movie, Tony was happily asleep. His head was gently resting on Steve's shoulder. Thor and the others were still riveted to the movie. Probably because they hadn't spent the last three days subsisting on coffee and occasional naps. At the end of the movie when the others made to move they spotted Tony and Steve happily asleep together, heads resting on each other and their hands suspiciously close together. Natasha smiled and shushed Thor. Clint took a photograph as Bruce found a blanket to drape over them. They all quietly filtered out to their own rooms to sleep, leaving the two men to their own dreams.
He reached over to the multitool, mentally preparing himself for what was about to come. He took a deep breath, and quickly pressed the hot metal to the nail bed. He let out a long, ragged scream of pain as he held it there long enough to seal it, then turned the tool over to seal the rest of the nailbed. The whole ordeal lasted only seconds, but it felt like an age. He wretched dryly onto the ground beside him panted loudly as the pain throbbed through him, collecting his mental energy enough to inspect the newly sealed injury. He winced as he gently investigated with a finger, making sure that it wasn’t bleeding and there was no raw open skin left. He was relieved to find he’d got the whole area and that he didn’t need to submit himself to that pain again. He wasn’t sure if he even could. Leaning over he took the dried strips of pants leg off the spit and carefully bandaged his toe, making sure that it was tied on tightly so it wouldn’t get kicked off while he slept. Forcing himself to eat the entire cooked fish through his nausea he lay down to try and get some sleep.
. Don’t make me feel even more useless than I already do,” Tony spat back as Steve paled at the memory of Natasha falling, screaming Tony’s name.
“What the hell is that thing?!” Cap heard Hawkeye shout into the comm.
“Well, there's a special art exhibition on and I was, well I was wondering if you wanted to go with me? No one else really cares.”
Steve could feel tears welling up, even though he knew Tony didn't really mean it. Something had happened, but he didn't know what. He'd never seen Tony so
“How vague?” Natasha responded.
, Pep..... Whether or not I enjoy that isn't the point!”
Tony stilled, looking off into the distance. Steve stood up, not realising Tony hadn’t made it that far in.
Steve looked up at him, “I'm sorry. Could I possibly touch it?”
Tony shrugged off Steve's hands and turned away, “Yeah, well, finding out that I was in Hydra's pocket and building tech for them has kinda put me off my food.” His voice sounded raw.
Natasha looked around at the team, “I’ll tell Pepper.”
“You're not weak,” he said. “No one could think you were weak.”
“True,” said Steve. “Well, if you ever need protection from spiders or anything like them, just get JARVIS to fetch me and I'll save you.”
Steve swallowed the tablets with the water as Bruce sat down beside him at the table to nurse a mug of tea. “Thanks,” he said softly before taking a bite of the butter-soaked toast, feeling the warmth of the fresh food in his throat and feeling a little better just for having something solid in his stomach. He finished the slice and a rasher of bacon before noticing Natasha looking at him from the corner of her eye. He smiled faintly at her.
“Genius, Clint. Remember? Coming your way Cap.”
“Certainly, friend.”
“You always like my cooking, when have I ever made something the team didn't like?”
Steve grabbed the front of Tony's shirt and pulled him in for a long, deep kiss. When he let go Tony swayed a little and blinked stupidly.
“You made this for me?” Steve stared at the camera.
“No Tony,” Steve cut him off sternly, “he was my best friend. I can't let him live the rest of his life like...” Steve swallowed hard, “Like that.”
The team simultaneously looked towards the ceiling in confusion as the sound of Coldplay came blasting through the sound system at an almost painful volume. They exchanged glances before Clint’s expression softened.
Steve spoke quietly, “So, the anxiety is still a problem? I know how that feels.”
Steve smiled, “It's warm...” He ran his hand across it's surface and peered closely at it. He examined it for around a minute before standing up and suddenly becoming awkward, a blush rising to his cheeks.
The reporters stood and asked their questions, the run of the mill ‘where was it from’, ‘what was it’ and ‘is it going to come back’ somewhat blending in together. A woman in a red skirt suit stood up to ask her question, the team anticipating another bland same old question.
“Well, there was a lot of waving around a fire extinguisher. I got the feeling he was hesitant to use it though.”
Movie night at the Stark tower was always a big affair. Every Thursday they'd get as much popcorn, ice cream, soda and chips as humanly possible and take turns choosing a movie. This week, however, was extra special. Barton had decided that he needed to educate Steve on the wondrous magic of The Lord Of The Rings. The idea was met enthusiastically by all of the Avengers and as such a marathon was declared. Eleven hours of pure fantastical bliss, not including rest stops to restock on snacks and beverages. Clint lay across Natasha's lap as they sat beside Bruce on the big couch, while Thor took up the armchair which he had claimed for movie night the first time they'd ever suggested the idea. Steve and Tony took up the smaller of the two couches.
“But seriously, that shot you pulled off from the back of the Doombot Clint, that was pretty amazing,” Steve smiled at the archer.
“It appears it was not accidental, Sir. The crash was organised by HYDRA in order to remove them from SHIELD.”
“Like you wouldn't enjoy it,” came the equally snarky reply, with added Captain America Smile ™.
As Steve left the lab he tried to pinpoint when he'd discovered he'd begun to see Tony as more than just a friend, but he couldn't. It had been more of a slow building discovery that dawned on him over the course of a couple of weeks. Regardless of when, he knew there was no way the older man was going to consider the man his father had neglected him for as a potential love interest, so he kept his feelings as firmly under control as he could and didn't mention it to any of the other Avengers.
“Thor.”
Tony laughed a crackle that sounded painful, “What, didn’t you get my postcards?” Tony lifted an arm and Steve saw what he was holding, “And I kept my trusty safety goggles with me on your command.”
Steve pulled his shirt down and stepped back, cheeks flushed. He looked at Tony, “Oh God, I- I’m sorry,” he said breathlessly, “I don’t know what came over me.”
Tony lifted his head slightly and looked at him, his eyes red and puffy, his nose running.
“Tony, I just don't get it,” Steve sighed, letting his hands and the StarkPhone fall into his lap. Tony shifted his weight, leaning over the back of the couch for long periods of time tended to be uncomfortable. He reached down to pick up the phone, ignoring the fact that his hand was dangerously close to an area he'd much like to know more about, and rounded the couch to sit beside Steve.
that Thor was able to catch Natasha. A couple more seconds and she would have died,” Steve said coldly.
“I don't feel the cold much after, ya know,” Steve replied. “Besides, you must be overheating pretty badly in all your layers!”
Steve was working out in the gym, throwing himself into his punching bag like it was the last thing left on earth. His head and his heart were spinning. Bruce's comment had left a maelstrom of emotions in it's wake, as Steve tried to figure out if it was remotely possible that Tony Stark, genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, could possibly be interested in him. He didn't know what to do, whether he should go and find Tony right now or let himself try to work out his feelings, or wait for Tony to make a move. If he did feel that way at all.
He looked back up and caught Tony’s eye, “How... How are you going to replace the one in your chest with this?”
Thor looked puzzled, “Then why not employ a friend to make them aware of the other's feelings?”
Tony shook his head, “She left, Steve.” He smiled wanly, “Plus she made me promise I’d never make her do it again.” Tony flicked his eyes up to look directly into his, “You are the only person I trust to do this.”
The next few weeks were surprisingly quiet for the Avengers. It appeared it was bad-guy vacation time, New York was left unscathed. As such the six team mates had plenty of time to wind each other up and generally get on with their own projects. Steve was making progress with the various pieces of StarkTech riddled through out the tower, with Tony's help of course. Tony was spending extra time in the lab, often barely making it up on time for movie night. He also seemed to be falling asleep a lot more often during the films, though Steve didn't mind carrying him to bed every week. A few times he'd even found Tony sleeping with his head resting on his arms on the workbench in his lab while bringing down food or pondering a question. Eventually it became habit to check before Steve went to bed, just to make sure. Most nights he ended up with a mostly sleeping Tony in his arms, listening to him murmur as he tucked him into bed. Sometimes he'd pluck up enough courage to brush the hair from his forehead and kiss the skin exposed there.
Tony awoke with a start as he felt a hand shaking his shoulder. The driver smiled at him and jumped out of the cab, walking around the front and motioning for him to get out. He undid his seatbelt and pushed open the door, climbing down on the ground. He looked around, figuring out that they had stopped at a gas station. He winced as he began to walk, suddenly aware again of the pain in his feet. Running his hand over his face he froze. He stared from between his fingers in a stupor, taking in the fact that there was a phone on the wall of the gas station. A pay phone. He stumbled towards it, his mind searching for the number for the tower. He let a frustrated howl escape his lips as he lifted the handset and realised he had no money to activate the phone. He felt tears start to come to his eyes before he heard a noise behind him and turned to find the truck driver holding out some coins. Tony looked at him, waiting for him to close his hand. When the driver nodded at his hand he greedily grabbed the coins and fed them into the phone. He prayed as the phone rang, hoping beyond hope that someone would pick up. After what seemed like an eternity the ringing cut off.
