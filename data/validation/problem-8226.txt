“Can’t even keep it in your pants when half of the US government is watching your every move, can you?” someone said.
He was in big trouble now. Assaulting a man as powerful as Obadiah Stane wouldn’t go without a price. Steve wasn't fooling himself that this rash, idiotic behavior would go over smoothly. "I shouldn't have punched him," he said, glancing at Tony. "Even though he's an insufferable asshole."

"So, that guy…"
picture that showed Bucky’s grinning face when he’d put on his new arm for the first time.
were the brains, I’d be the heart, and I don’t think this world would survive
There was almost no chance—not even for Tony, which was saying something—that they could avoid each other all the time. And maybe,
Steve rolled his eyes. “You’re not old.”
Steve nodded, not knowing what to say when he still knew so little of what had transpired.
“What?” Sam was the first to find his voice. He had turned around in the cockpit, staring at Steve with wide eyes. When Steve nodded, there was a blaze of confusion and surprise on his face. “I’m your friend, man.
Tony huffed sardonically as he stood up as well. “Excuse me, but what part of ‘flying suit of armor’ didn’t you understand, exactly? I just needed to get in, scan the damned basement—which was empty, by the way—and fly out again. Easy. If you hadn’t trailed after me, neither of us would be here now.”
“You’re not bad weed,” Steve said, looking sad.
“Your hot aunt seemed pretty laid-back.”
“It’s the damn portal,” Tony wheezed, trying to meet Steve’s eyes but everything was just too fuzzy. He had trouble staying upright and after a bit of struggling just collapsed against Steve’s chest, pushing his face against him.
“There’s only one patrol of Doombots coming here,” Steve explained. “We can shut them down easy, we just have to do it before they send off an alarm. If we do this without Doom noticing, the changes to our timeline should be minimal.”
Steve made a quick scan of the perimeter, but the area leading to the data storage appeared to be empty. Save, of course, for the two Iron Legion suits circling the Helicarrier’s glass dome.
“Where does he stand with the ATCU?” Steve asked. “Do we know?”
,” he snapped, trying to pull his hand back but Steve was holding on tightly. His eyes flared and he pushed against Steve in a swift, angry motion. “Why would you even

tried—to get him to leave with me, join SHIELD together, I might’ve had a chance to stop all of this.”
“I’m gonna stop listening to you, now,” Steve announced, grinning for a moment, before he pressed his face against Tony’s neck. “You’re just gonna be silly about this and I have better things to do.”
I don’t want this to ruin your big moment. I want you to be happy when the eclipse starts, and if that means I have to bite the bullet, I will do it.”
As if on instinct, he took half a step back when Steve stood up, but with two wide strides, Steve was right in front of him.
There were several shots following after that, but this time, Tony was fast enough. Iron Man settled all around him and Tony threw himself on top of Fury, pushing him firmly to the side while the bullets collided against the armor’s back.
Tony huffed. Steve was behaving a bit strange, wasn’t he? He took a detailed look at their surroundings with some resignation. “So you’re… absolutely sure you wanna take this stupid mystery ghost tour?”
It was sometime during his fourth month at the mansion that Tony picked up his hand during dinner and held it between both of his own. It was soft and warm, and familiarly stained with oil. He kissed the tip of each of Steve’s fingers.
“But you want to,” Tony retorted pointedly, searching Steve’s gaze. He hadn’t let go of him yet, and that was good, right? As long as Steve wanted this… wanted
Tony huffed. “Thanks a lot.”
Ah fuck, he’d forgotten about Natasha’s suggestion to talk to Vision. He just… there was so much going on, and with Ian and SI, he’d barely had any time, and—
“I want you.”
“At ease,” Tony’s robotic voice resounded, and Steve heaved a breath of relief when Tony reached for his helmet and pulled it off. There were a few bad cuts and hematomas on his face, but otherwise, he seemed to be physically fine.
They kissed all the way across the room, stumbling and laughing, nipping at each other’s lips and growling with how good it felt. Whenever they looked at each other, Steve was staring him down with that gorgeous, endless blue gaze of his, like Tony was suddenly so much more than he’d been before. The strokes of Steve’s lips were damn near reverent. He consumed Tony, all but devoured him. And with every kiss, he was crawling inside Tony, making himself at home just a little bit more. He sucked at Tony’s tongue and imprinted himself on the building blocks that made Tony who he was.
“Steve will know that we can’t help them right now,” Tony told her, hating himself for it, but knowing it was the truth either way.
side, and now am I just going to go back to being a high school kid?”
he was kind of acting the part. That was, apparently, what being near Steve did to him. Having him lose all last strands of control.
“They wiped his memory numerous times and rigged his brain with implants,” Bruce explained slowly, glancing up at Steve. “It’s all we know for now. We’ve been working to get him into a condition that’d make it safe to shut off the implants. I expect that we’ll have his brain sorted out soon, but we can’t say how he’ll react to his new memories. It’s—”
“It doesn’t make any sense,” Tony said.
Tony smiled at him, settling a hand on Fury’s shoulder as he led him a little ways off the dance-floor. Steve followed them.
Steve squatted down next to him, grabbing for his hand and giving it a little squeeze. “When you rediscovered vibranium.”
They had to.
“Well, you know how stubborn I can be. When I put my mind to something, I don’t rest until I see it through.”
“Shipwreck! Ship on the rocks!”
want Steve around.
He blinked. Somehow, he hadn’t been expecting that. Had always figured he would either live here or go into prison. “The right decision?” he echoed. “The right…”
“Thanks,” Steve said, though his thoughts were decidedly elsewhere. “I appreciate it.”
“Nope,” Steve replied, steadily pumping the finger in and out of Tony. “Taking my time with you.”
Yesterday had been a good day—or as good as could be expected. They’d had a conversation, a
There were very few things that elluded Tony’s understanding. How HYDRA had managed to wreak that much havoc in one single human brain was beyond him. True to Bruce’s predictions, once an implant was deactivated, the memories seemed to all but flood Barnes’ mind. And ever since, his unconscious body had tensed and shook and bled in random surges. It hadn’t been a pretty sight to begin with, but the last attack had really taken the cake—fuck, the whole goddamn bakery.
built the world’s first sophisticated AI, I think I’m pretty much required to use that line as often as I possibly can.”
Steve lubed himself, and when he was poised at his entrance, he paused one last time, before he carefully shoved inside. And when he was settled within him, Tony’s body came alive in ways that were so familiar by now but alien all the same. His cry of pleasure was swallowed by Steve’s insistent mouth. He held still for a minute and Tony felt him tremble above him. For control, for release, for anything, Tony didn’t know.
In moments like these, Tony liked to think that—had he known back then how good the two of them could be together, had he had
Since he was officially introduced as Tony’s new business partner, a torrent of men and women wanted to talk to him about Stark Industries. Unfortunately for Steve, he had no way of refusing their conversations and therefore, he had little choice but to spend much of the evening with horrible people with horrible questions that made Justin Hammer seem like a really swell guy.
Steve gritted his teeth. The moment of silence lingered, and he thought he might've said too much already, so with the slightest glance at Tony, he took himself out of the workshop and as far away from Tony he could get while not leaving the tower.
“No word yet?” Rhodey asked in Maria’s direction.
The gossip made Steve sick to the bones, but Tony remained calm throughout every inquiry, be it by the police or some journalist. His eyes, however, always remained on Steve—determined, focused, but full of fear as well, as though he expected him to disappear any moment.
Shrugging slightly, he stared down at the blueprint. “It was a problem I could solve.”
The excitement in Tony was so tangible he nearly vibrated in Steve's arms. It was adorable. Steve's smile softened and he tilted his head, still maintaining that nonchalant air. "Who knows? PhDs in Arts aren't as rare as you'd think." He pecked Tony's cheek. "We'll see how they find me, and if that doesn't work out, I'll find something else."
So to say Tony was nervous was a vast understatement. Though with Steve at his side, clad in a very well fitted suit, ready to go to Washington and put his signature on that paper, it was a lot easier to handle.
For the first time in his life, Steve felt utterly content. And he would be alright to just lie here with Tony like this for as long as he would let him.
* * *
“Just saying,” Tony added quickly, glancing warily at Steve. “I, uh, didn’t want to assume…”
When his eyes landed on the bed once more, Steve realized there was a man lounging on its surface.
Steve drew in a breath. “I, um, hi.”
She handed him the faded photograph, and Steve couldn’t stop the amused little sound leaving his mouth as he looked down on baby Tony giggling, drooling and biting on some plush toy that looked a lot like a wrench.
“Pretty nice set up,” Steve said as they made their way through the hallway. The entrance hall was gigantic, with four huge chandelier and a live orchestra playing Sinatra in the background. Tony instantly felt the stares of all those gathered in the giant ballroom. All eyes were on them and it only had him grip Steve’s hand a little tighter.
“Humor me?” she asked and cast him a reassuring smile.
threat to national security. Fury is trying to stop something before it even started. Based on what? He makes compromises because he is afraid of losing control. And this is the exact behavior that wills war into existence.” The tone of his own voice startled him with its conviction, his heart straining to be heard. That was a lesson learned the hard way. A lesson he would never allow himself to forget. “This is why I need to know where your loyalties are. I need to be able to trust that you’re not keeping information from me.”
“We can’t… destroy them…” the Sorcerer Supreme said, gasping with the strain. “Not without setting their power free once more.”
Thanks a lot for all of your comments! I hope you enjoyed this story :)
Steve cleared his throat, and announced their presence. “Did we fall through a rabbit hole?”
“Wanna hold him?” Tony asked Bucky, and Steve raised a brow in surprise, because he hadn’t expected that. Not that Tony didn’t like Bucky—Steve was sure that beneath a layer of side-comments, snark and banter, the two actually liked each other—but
Steve arched a brow, coiling his hands in the lapels of Tony’s tux, pulling him nearer. “Aren’t you a textbook spouse.”
After a moment’s consideration, Natalia dropped her eyes. “And I can’t do
A small murmur of complaint rumbled through her throat as her weight was shifted, but otherwise, she held perfectly still. “I have to be in DC in a few hours. You should get more sleep,” she said gently, placing a hand on his cheek. “It’s still dark outside.”
“It’s true till I have counterevidence,” Steve shot back. “Play for me sometime?”
There was a prolonged pause.
“We’re taking the tractor home with us, by the way,” Tony went on. “Put it in the shop, call it the tractor of love. It’ll be awesome.”
“Autographs?” Steve asked, confused. Of course he’d been a bit famous back in the days, and Tony had known about him, but all of that was long over.
still his lab, isn't it?" he asked, glancing at the door. The writing on it had peeled off ages ago due to exposure to whatever materials it was Bruce was working with.
Tony laughed, softly. “Fine with me.” He rested his hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing him once, while Steve tightened his grip on Tony’s waist and started leading.
Steve arched a brow in surprise. “
It took fewer strides than he thought it would to step up to Tony's side. Towering above the duo, Steve glared at Tony, refusing to admit there was more jealousy to his behavior than anything else. He wasn't
There was a pause, and they both chuckled as their fingers entwined.
“Ah,” Steve said, taking a deep breath, not knowing what to think about that. “And you’re telling me that, why?”
“More like hiding and wallowing in self-pity.”
“Cause I can still throw him into that river, you just have to say the word.”
Steve couldn’t help staring at him. He had to admit, he hadn’t thought Tony was so…
different, and Tony's words were making something warm and un-nameable swell inside of him.
“Obi…” Tony said on a sigh. But once he looked at Stane’s stern expression, a shadow fell over his eyes and he remained otherwise silent.
Tony nodded, every part of him wrung with emotions, and with a long, strangled moan of completion, Steve’s cock sank inside him. The remaining walls between them collapsed. Steve pulled him down on his chest fully, and there, with his heat scorching every inch of Tony’s body, he was whole once more.
In any case, there hadn’t been much to debrief, but Bucky knew Steve had been grateful for that symbol of normalcy.
“Tony’s in your room,” Natasha said.
“Since when have you ever apologized for being you?”
Tony pulled out the bullet he’d been shot with. “There were three slugs. And the riffling doesn’t match anything I’ve ever seen and JARVIS says it’s untraceable.”
did he want it.
“It’s a really, really long story.”
that,” Stark said. “Believe me, I do. And I understand that the waiting is killing you, but if your presence will trigger him again, it will only be harder. His brain needs more time to adjust to the absence of barriers. You really need to trust me on this.”
You change so much. The fact that we can talk like this, here, right now, is proof enough of that.”
, every part of their lives, the good and the bad.
It had already been three years, Steve reminded himself. Bucky had probably finished rehabilitation. He was… alive. Steve just needed… He needed to…
They stepped into the Kamar-Taj, hand in hand. The sorcerers-in-training were all over the place, some firing blasts of energy at one another, some sitting on the floor, staring into open space like they weren’t even there. At least, not psychically.
They sat like that for a good few minutes, and Steve almost nodded off at some point, when he heard Pietro speak up. He and Wanda were standing in a corner a bit further away from the rest of the team, and Steve watched Wanda clean some of the cuts on Pietro’s face. “What are you thinking of?” he asked her.
File "Ultron_Program.py", line 49, in
The room briefly came into focus.
they were already back at the dorm.
At that, Tony smiled, a little disbelieving. “We were never… more. If that’s what you want to know.”
Tony’s eyes trailed up Steve’s naked body, half a mind to call him back to bed and start the day as the last one had ended. Before he could ponder how bad it’d be if he came in late to work today, though, his progression was halted by Steve’s offensive boxer briefs that concealed his goodies from Tony’s reverent eyes.
“Tony,” Steve breathed.
Steve nodded and sat back in his chair. And Tony had likely never seen him this unraveled. “I… I didn’t put two and two together right away,” he started saying. “I mean, I knew the Winter Soldier killed Howard—and your ma—, and afterwards, I realized Bucky was the Winter Soldier… but it took a few days for it to sink in. That
anything," Steve said, to bring the conversation to some kind of conclusion, "because it's still... fresh." He said the first word that felt right. "Didn't wanna jinx it anymore than necessary." He looked at Tony, eyes irrevocably drawn to his ass.
During the next couple of days, they mostly gathered and inventoried supplies. Tony had found a few food cans in the ruins of his former kitchen and even a mostly torn blanket they’d now spread out beneath their shelter.
Rhodey sighed. “Indries’. Yes, we know.”
Steve sighed, drawing Tony in and burying his own face in Tony’s neck. “I just found you,” he whispered. “I won’t let them take you away from me.”
Twirling the phone in his hand, Tony put it down on his work desk with a sigh. It wasn’t that he blamed Steve. Not for all of it, at least. He’d gone too far, yes, but some part of Tony had known, from the beginning that Steve wouldn’t budge. And putting that theory to test repeatedly—it had only hurt them more. Tony guessed he had simply,
out of the blue, a small and confused voice resounded in Steve’s head.
Bruce closed his eyes briefly and paused to gather his bearings. “He’ll retain his free will. That’s—”
The man huffed, clearly more than bit annoyed now. His long, slender fingers stroked his weirdly groomed chin in mock-thought. “Great. Isn’t that a real ball-buster? Last week wasn’t shitty enough, is that it? No, now my sex-fantasy is having a crisis of faith. You’re my wet dream, darling, you’re supposed to be naked by now, not discuss your issues with me.”
Sam hit the brakes, and Barnes flew over the window and on the street.
They stepped out onto the sidewalk, Steve minding his steps because the world just seemed to slip sideways every now and again, and walked a few feet from the entrance to look for cabs that might be waiting in the area. Well,
year they’d graduate from high school, there’d be a total eclipse on American mainland. It would be a 70-mile-wide totality path, stretching over the whole country, from Oregon to South Carolina. That day—and Tony remembered it in a way he didn’t remember much of anything when it came to his crappy childhood—, he and Rhodey had started forming ‘The Plan’; the plan for ‘The Most Legendary Solar Eclipse Post-Graduation Road Trip Of All Times’. Even at the age of ten, Tony had known that this would mark the end of his youth and the start of something new—something bigger. And he wanted to share this moment with his best friend more than he wanted to breathe.
At that, he just closed his eyes again, which took almost as much effort as opening them had. He turned away as much as he could with the shackles around his wrists. Just the idea of seeing Steve, of looking into his eyes, of facing the sympathy there, the understanding, he couldn’t…
“You have three minutes.”
“Why not both,” Natasha murmured, struggling against him briefly, her breath quickening when he let go of her hands, his fingers finally tracing around her stomach, then lower.
“Let me decide on that,” Steve said, and rolled around until he settled on top of Tony. He was painfully aware that they should be doing some clean-up, but this was more important.
Steve frowned and the fierce look he gave him shook Tony down to his core. “Do you love me, Tony?”
“I’m sorry,” he told them, “Just wanted to make sure I look nice… it’s my first ball, after all.”
“I hate camping,” Tony said.
The softly uttered “I love you” that Tony whispered had Steve rumbling the same back at him. He leaned in to kiss him, letting his tongue caress Tony’s mouth as his hands slid to his hips, shoving his shirt up a bit to rub comforting circles against his back muscles that were beyond strained. He made a mental note that one of the first things he would do for him once this was over was a massage—full body. Followed by a long soak in the tub. He could feel the tension wrack through Tony’s system. The essence of his innate strength was worn and tattered—still there, but momentarily forgotten.
Steve officially hated balls.
Steve heaved a hurried breath. “No idea, but I’m sure we’re about to find out.”
“We hurt people!”
Steve remembered it all so vividly. How Tony’d grin at him and rise to his feet the second he popped into the room. Then he’d storm forward and take his face in his hands, kiss his lips and walk him backward until they fell into a tangle on the bed. Tony had kissed him and every concern niggling Steve’s brain had melted into nothing. He’d caress him and hold him and let him be weak in a world where he was supposed to be nothing but strong.
A voice Steve was all too familiar with.
, always on the edge of his mind, dark and cold and frightening. Tony couldn’t track him, though, as if he was simply lurking around, far out of Tony’s reach.
Oh right. He was completely naked.
“The thing is, and I swear there is a point here: You changed a lot since you met Steve. I’m not saying that’s all his work, but the guy who got wasted at that party, and the guy here,” he clapped a hand on Tony’s knee, “there’s helluva difference. You decided to take responsibility for what happened with the team, and that’s all because you wanted to be a better man… for him.”
There was a sizzling noise, and suddenly, the night sky was exploding with light. The different colors burst in the air  and each was a giant star that was spreading its spikes, before it ripped apart and showered the ground with its sparks.
“It’s true.” Tony shrugged. “I never said we suddenly became different people. We just… learned to actually listen to each other. That was the hard part, because once we’d managed
“Detective!” Tony called after him, far too much despair in his voice. “Steve!”
“Youbrokemeagain,” he mumbled into the skin of Steve’s shoulder, the words blurring together. Goddammit, he was completely limp—again. And still shaking, and exhausted—again. But also much,

trying to kill them, wasn’t he? It was—not just them, but the whole world. He’d built the most advanced artificial intelligence to protect the people he loved, to give the Iron Legion someone to direct them, to lead them if need be, and now it planned to lay waste to the whole of humanity.
“What is it?” Steve asked.
“I’m not
Tony wiped the steam from the mirror and stared into it, long and hard. It was May 29th 2018, the same day he’d chosen to travel back in time—and also his birthday.
“Great,” Tony murmured. He walked around the shelves, and stilled when he came face to face with a full board of beverages, including some bottles of liquor. It hadn’t been an issue in so long that Tony didn’t even feel that sudden yearning he’d once felt whenever he’d watched someone nip at a glass of wine. There was no itching in his fingers, no faster beating of his heart. He didn’t
Steve’s head jerked up as his eyes settled on the door. “Yeah?”
The boy nodded and gave him the plane. It was only when Tony turned it around in his hands, that Steve realized that one of the wings seemed to be broken. Tony inspected it with just as much concentration as he sported whenever he tinkered with the Iron Man suits, and Steve couldn't hold back a small smile when Tony hummed in pointed consideration, rubbing his chin.
Steve bit back a curse as his fingers slipped on the bridge’s ledge. One hand lost its grip and swung free, his body smacking against the pillar. He was still three floors up. He only barely managed to cling on for a second, before his hand slipped and he fell. In front of him, the pillar rushed down in a hard, shining waterfall of polished white.
A jolt of heat shimmied down Steve’s spine. He licked his lips and reached for his hand, pressing it down until there was no inch between them, looking down into his eyes intently. “I might not have realized it sooner, but I think the feelings were always there, too. One day, I didn’t even know you, and the other day you’d already taken up my whole mind.”
“I guess he isn’t tired yet, after all, huh,” Steve said, brushing a finger over Ian’s forehead.
His eyes scanned the words, then he closed them, blocking everything out.
A decision was defined by a great number of possibilities, after all.
that got him. It struck him as a bit of ironic though he would never laugh at Tony. But Tony, sitting in his lap, his body warm and pliant, asking him politely if he could bring him off?
“Nervous?” Tony asked. “Who’s nervous? I’m not nervous.”
Steve groaned and simply leaned down to grab the two main poles. “I’m here. And I’ll help you. Better start dealing with both.”
plan to end all plans.
As soon as Rhodes killed the engine, though, Tony shot upwards from his seat and moved faster than Steve had ever seen him move. He grabbed his sunglasses and messenger bag, then all but ran to the RV’s exit. The slam of the front door sliced through the room like a silver bullet.
, idiot. And I did not need to know that.
The suggestion, though anticipated, still shocked Steve. So much that, at first, he couldn’t react at all.
Meet me down at my workshop,
“Tell me,” Tony pleaded suddenly, and Steve could feel his movements becoming jerky. “Tell me you love me.”
"It emits a ghastly smell," Thor said, then pulled up higher.
resounded within Extremis’ syntax.
. “Not everyone can be saved. We need to live with that, otherwise, one day, maybe nobody can be saved.” He looked down at his feet. “I don’t think Wanda was ready for this. I thought she was, but… can’t imagine what’s going through her head. She just wanted to help and then—”
“Sure. We’re all living here right now,” Bucky explained. “We wanted to wait for you to decide what to do next.”
That had been a mistake, but at least now, he got it out of his system.
“I got a private jet taking off,” Natasha called through the comm-line, “across town, no manifest. That could be him.”
SR 6:20 P.M.>Emergency call. Be in touch to reschedule, okay?
you’re back to idolizing him. You always do that. I’m just saying… whenever he calls for you, you jump, no matter what you’re doing right then, no questions asked, right? Just worrying that you give it your all and he doesn’t.”
“You’re smiling.”
With a pleased smile, Steve pushed at Tony’s pants, trying to get them off as well. While Tony raised his hips to help him, he was also trying to shove Steve’s pants down. They struggled, getting in each other’s way.
Tony, that much was clear. But he couldn’t let Ross throw them into a prison cell and watch how the world sank into chaos either.
Tony shook his head miserably. “I have no idea. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I guess I was still expecting for some sort of explanation, but… I mean,
He didn’t move and closed his eyes again. Curiosity ebbed him; he wanted to see how Tony’d act if he thought him asleep.
Curiosity got the better of him, so Tony reached for Steve’s hand before he drew it back, but Steve’s other one shot out and grabbed him.
Carol nodded again but did not reply, instead turned to leave the tent without making another sound. And dutifully, though with palpable hesitation, Steve tugged on Tony’s hand once more and followed.
Stane smiled at him quietly and it wasn’t hard to tell that the man didn’t like him, but Tony had said that he and Stane would be friends. It was what Tony wanted. And for his sake, Steve was willing to try.
Another sigh, this one of resignation. “Right,” he said, flexing his shoulders as he unpacked the sandwich. “Slave driver.”
There was a brief pause, before Bucky raised a brow. “Sorry, was that a question?”
He wouldn’t be moving on from this.
Obligingly, the man walked out into the direct light above him. He seemed familiar in a surreal sort of way, like he’d been dreaming of this face, dreaming of what the person attached to that face had done to him.
“Sorry about that,” he mumbled instead, rubbing a free hand over his own abdomen. “Thing has a mind of its own.”
With that in mind, he sent a glance in Tony's direction and sighed.
In the distance, skyscrapers rebuilt themselves, trees were rooted in the earth once more.
Tony cracked a wry grin, his eyes sizing Steve up. “If you think I will stop you now, you really haven’t been paying attention.”
No matter how much he wanted to be.
“He really is.”
And just like that, the air between them was suspended. Tony heard Steve breathing, in and out, before he raised his voice again. “This probably isn’t the right time either. But if I keep it to myself much longer, I’m going to go crazy, and you deserve to know.”
Steve heaved a long breath. “I didn’t marry him for his money, Buck.”
“Is he alone?” Tony asked, rubbing a hand over his face. He knew the answer even before reception-lady confirmed that
He turned his metal hand into a fist, wondering if she could hear his heart as it suddenly began to slam against his breastbone. If she did, she gave no indication. Cautiously, he tugged on her hand until the length of her arm splayed across his abdomen. “Stay with me.”
When exactly he’d made ‘Keep Tony safe’ his mission, he didn’t know, but he would do anything to make it happen.
It still didn’t make any sense.
By now, the robot was on his own, with the rest of the Iron Legion suits crumbled on the ground all around the room. There was only one of them left, and the robot raised it with one hand, squeezing its mask so hard it crumbled. “With these?” he asked, sounding amused. “These puppets? There’s only one path to peace: The Avengers’ extinction.”
It was a start.
With an annoyed groan, Bucky opened the door for a little gap and glared at Clint. “Tell him I’ll be down in ten,” he snapped.
"Hi, Steve. Been a while," Bucky said, and—without any reservations—leaned over and wound his arm around Steve’s neck. Steve hugged him back, tightly. He should’ve known that even three years of absolute radio silence wouldn't sever a friendship like theirs. Even the incident that had cost Bucky so much.
. I can’t give them a blank approval.”
“Not funny,” he said, but didn’t look too angry, all things considered.
. Don’t listen to me. I know you have to. It’s important. I just—”
Steve nodded his thanks as he took one of the bottles, taking a sip. Despite not being able to get drunk, he still liked the taste. “That’s sort of hard to believe,” he said. “That
“I’m so glad you’re here,” Steve breathed against Tony’s lips. It was the same aching desperation that he’d kissed him with yesterday—the sort of desperation that came with too many hours being alone, and too much pent-up energy. But back then, Steve’s lips had curled upward then in a futile, however endearing attempt to keep from smiling. His kisses had been insistent, and full of relief and joy.
“Tony?” Steve prompted cautiously, then sighed, when Tony didn’t answer. “I’m glad you called... Wasn’t sure you would.”
Thank you all for your lovely comments!
“Is that… is that supposed to make me feel better?”
for your dork-like infatuation with these places?”
For a long moment, Steve stayed where he was, perched over Tony, but he pulled himself up after a while to look him over. Tony looked absolutely delicious like this, all pliable and soft and Steve had never seen him like this, not even after blowing him that morning.
“Never losing faith in people. I
“Steve,” Tony urged, and he was shaking all over now. “My life… it didn’t go so well. After the dreams stopped, I had a few rough years, okay? Did a lot of stuff I’m not proud of, with a lot of people I didn’t even like. I drank, I…” His eyes flickered to the floor. “I had too many affairs, built weapons that caused more damage than they did good, and… and my body is kind of a mess. I almost died a year ago, and… you wouldn’t… you wouldn’t want someone like me.”
“What is it?” Steve asked, frowning as he followed Tony’s movements with his eyes.
, there was no denying the big smile appearing on his lips. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
“James had a flashback,” Natasha explained. “Ian was never in danger. Not for a second. I promise.” She glanced at Tony. “Please don’t freak out.”
“Why? Just let me—”
couldn’t do anything but stand there. And with the way Steve held him, like he was something very precious, Tony suddenly felt like he held Steve’s heart in his bare hands.
. Without a doubt,” he declared vehemently. Tony’s eyes were drawn to him by the sincerity in his low voice and he found he could not look away. “I missed my chance… before. And I don’t know if I’ll ever see him again… after this. I know he’s still in there, Tony. I owe him another try. You
—, with no way of getting him back. Not even Strange, with all his magical power, had given them the slightest hope to undo what had happened.
Yeah, Tony had figured as much. It was what he wanted to do as well. To hide and just… not think about what had happened. Because at the end of the day, it was too much for one human mind to handle.
He aimed a strained smile in Steve’s direction when he caught his glance. The contamination chamber’s door had opened, the light within the room green once more, and Tony slowly rose to his feet.
“Fuck,” Steve said, slowly pushing his way inside.
“Yes, Steve?” JARVIS asked, making Steve smile a little. He was the only one JARVIS called by his first name, Tony included, and Steve couldn’t help but feel a little honored every time he did so.
When they reached the top of the stairs, Tony gave the common room a once-over through the large glass doors. Ugh, when Wilson had said ‘everyone’, he’d really meant that. Romanoff, the Maximov girl, Vision… that was bound to get interesting. He still wasn’t a hundred percent sure what to think about Vision—about Vision basically knowing
He grinned even wider when he noticed the now flustered look on Handsome’s face. Late twenties, early thirties, Tony figured. Clearly out of his reach, and—considering the worn messenger-bag and the casual-but-still-professional-looking jacket—he was probably one of the junior professors. Definitely out of his reach, then.
Steve huffed, almost a laugh. “I—You know, I was sort of bluffing back there. I didn’t
He hadn’t dared to stay anywhere near Wakanda. Tony was too smart not to put two and two together. Well, if he hadn’t done so already, Steve mused. There was every chance that he had only decided to play the cat and mouse thing for the time being.
Tony bit his lower lip and waved at the tablet on the nightstand next to him. “Just mailed me that our last option opted out this afternoon. She did everything she could.”
“I’m not—”
Had the others actually expected them to hook up at some point? Tony couldn’t remember ever having given off any signs that he was interested in Steve like this. Or vice versa, for that matter. Well, sure, there had been that intense sort of tension between them from the start, but that had been animosity at best, right? They’d yelled at each other, they’d bickered and teased each other all the time. Only when they did get along, they were in sync in easy seconds and…
“He sounds like a nice person,” Natasha mused, raising a brow at him for confirmation.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You sure need another one of those, here in this temple.”
And for the first time since knowing him, Steve looked utterly hopeless.
The sudden impact of Tony’s laughter shook Steve to the bone. It made the insides of his chest quiver. And once again, he felt very young and very foolish.
“You’re welcome. Come on, you should sit down.”
Steve let himself slump down against Tony, mindful to keep some of his weight off him. He knew Tony was right. Even though they were the same people, it still wasn’t the same.
“Oh hey,” Tony called back, waving a bit when Steve didn’t immediately spot him. With a confused frown to the clock hanging above the workshop’s glass front, Tony wondered how much time had passed since Steve had left earlier. Earlier—yesterday? It didn’t
“How are you feeling?” she asked him and that was a fucking loaded question if he ever heard one.
The fight with Stane had taken everything out of him. All of these past weeks, the many false trails leading to Stane’s hideout, before they’d finally found him here, in the middle of Los Angeles, and now sending Stane to Hell… Tony simply hadn’t been prepared.
couldn't he get Tony out of his head?
"You look great like this, but you might wanna get dressed." They still had to make a show of being decent human beings when they joined the others at the common room, so Steve handed over the clothes.
“It’s about the shooter,” Natasha said, awfully quiet, forcing the words out as if each syllable was painful to utter. “I knew him. Long before Odessa. We worked for the KGB together for several years. We were…”
Slowly, he shuffled over to the bathroom. “I’ll be down in five, you can wait if you want. Or join me in the shower—just saying.” He cast Steve a wide grin before he walked into the room and took a quick shower. Steve didn’t join him, but Tony could hear him lingering. And it took everything in him not to let himself get lost in the hot water and the steam wafting around his head.
“Come on. Over here,” she called and pulled him with her. Around a corner, next to another shelf, Rhodey sat in a chair.
Tony tugged at Steve’s arm, tasting himself on his lips when they were eye-level again, ignoring the victorious smirk that arose to Steve’s face in turn.
“I want to stop it,” Tony said, looking more serious.
The next minutes were a blur of motion. Phil’s team had trouble containing the last soldier, but with Fury’s help, they managed to restrain him.
“That means ‘cuddles’,” he said quickly, reaching for Steve with one hand and pouting when he didn’t move one bit. “Come here, I’m not that hungry, really,” he lied, turning around once more until he was lying on his back. He kicked off the covers, completely unconcerned with his nudity. He bent his knees, while stretching his upper body, and running a hand down his chest until the tips of his fingers were lightly skimming his cock.
The birds were getting quiet and in the distance, Tony saw a few animals running towards the forest. The temperature was dropping, and the process of the surroundings darkening and changes taking place had been slow but were now almost imperceptible.
Tony had reached up and brushed back the hair that fell across Steve’s forehead. Steve had closed his eyes, feeling his face heat at Tony’s touch.
“Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so that people could be free.” A sigh rolled off his shoulders; he knew he was surprising Fury with the finality of his opposition, though he couldn’t fully understand why. From the beginning, Fury had been tuned into his opinion on these kind of matters. Even before Loki, they’d had these sort of disputes, and Steve had never budged on his beliefs.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You were doing that on purpose, huh?”
Steve nodded, his fingers tunneling through Tony’s hair. “It will be alright,” he whispered. “I’m sure it will.”
* * *
Tony winced when the HUD listed the kinds of weapons they were unleashing on Bruce, but he knew the Hulk could take it. And just as Bruce had promised, Ross’ focus was now kind of single-minded.
Tony snorted, grasping Steve’s hand after a few failed tries. “Yeah, I know that now, too. You know… after what he did to
How the hell had he thought he could ever make it through this road trip with Steve by his side? If being near Steve had been torturous before, it was now pure agony.
[F.R.I.D.A.Y.] [chat_server:46957]
He reached up and gently grabbed both of Tony's wrists, then pulled back. "What…" He swallowed once, licking his lips without really noticing that he was doing it. "What are you doing?"
Steve rolled his eyes. “It’s neither,” he said. “And thanks for that.” He cleared his throat. “Tony actually told me he’ll visit for Thanksgiving.”
“Yeah, looks like it,” Tony said, and Steve heaved a low breath of relief. “But now we need to get this psycho out of the picture. You said it was five of them?”
* * 4/7/18, 1:42 PM * *
Groaning, Steve spit the remaining toothpaste into the sink. How a single, random dream could throw him off like that was beyond him. There were other things to worry about. He needed to stop thinking about Tony, it hadn’t been real, and tomorrow was another test show, so he should be concentrating on that.
Steve put both of his hands over his face, rubbing his skin. Then, after he regained some sort of composure, he drew in a deep breath and turned in his seat. “Let’s say I might have… feelings for him. You really think he’ll return them?”
Tony made a face. “No, you know what—I’m really tired.”
Tony blew out a breath, shifting his hair away from his eyes as he let himself fall back in his chair. That had gone well.
It wasn’t exactly advanced mathematics. The UN wanted to control what they couldn’t so far, and by now, they only waited for the right timing to make the Accords public.
Tony laid his head back on his shoulder and Steve cradled him there. Steve’s heartbeat was unmistakably strong… and steady. “I used to wish that we could have just five more minutes together—after you’d left.”
“I never wanted him to be unhappy,” Steve replied brokenly. “I knew it was important to him, I should’ve just let it rest, not plant this
for betaing this chapter. You did an amazing job! Thank you for your help :)
“Let me get this straight. You put a note in the penthouse, hoping that I’d go up there before actually looking for you. And now you’re proposing to me in this total dump of a gay bar, just because we hooked up here? This is…” He pursed his lips, pointing to the folded paper with a pointedly unsatisfied glance. “This is kind of a lame plan, all things considered. I don’t think I can say yes to that.” He raised his shoulders, shrugging apologetically. “Guess you gonna have to do better than that.”
It was a stupid question because Steve should've known by now that this would happen, should've kept his distance, and he should know
Steve was regarding him for long moments, his movements led by quiet reserve—as though Tony was precious and fragile, rather than expendable. The air around them burned with novelty and during those next minutes, Tony wanted to open his mouth to put an end to it several times. He wanted to tell Steve that he didn’t need him to hold back, that he didn’t need it slow, but the words just wouldn’t come.
Steve pointedly didn’t flinch. Where should he even start? There wasn’t much he could say to this. He knew they’d have to answer a lot of questions—about Ultron, about Sokovia, about their work in general—and he had a feeling this was just the beginning of something that had, if he looked back, already started after the Chitauri invasion. “It’s a long story. If you don’t mind, I’d rather tell you some other time, preferably with Tony there.”
Every fiber of him screamed in protest. Divided with the need to both comfort Tony and stand his ground. To pepper his face with soft kisses and shake him until Tony told him that even if Steve
Steve leaned further against the kitchen island because his legs were threatening to fold under him.
Bruce was informed about how that fight on Upper East Side had gone down, and he’d already sent Tony a short note that he’d taken some samples of the plant, so they could actually get a look at it soon, see what the sudden attack had been about. The plant had just… appeared. From seemingly out of nowhere. And instead of actually doing what their usual villains-of-the-week did, it had just… stayed where it was, and only started to get aggressive when the Avengers had tried to lure it out of the busy streets.
A still beat had settled through the car. Slowly, Natasha turned her head sideways, gazing at him through the rear-view mirror with neutral curiosity. “And the ballistics?”
“I actually think I will.” He mostly agreed to get Steve out of the room. He needed time to think—to
Next to him, Rhodey shook his head in visible pain. “Why couldn’t they have left it there in peace, at the bottom of the sea?”
In that moment, Steve thanked Wanda and her quick thinking, thanked her for his life, but on the next beat, he watched the bulb veering off course and into the building next to them. The shock wave was massive and merciless, destroying many floors, making the windows break and shatter as a fiery death took hold of their surroundings.
Tony cast him another quick glance, then walked past the portraits.
* * 5/7/18, 08:42 PM * *
Thus, on a silent agreement, they both got up and went to their floors.
Steve paused, before slowly shaking his head. He remembered exactly how Tony had all but frozen when he’d mentioned the workshop. The last thing he wanted to do now was to remind him of whatever it was that made him avoid the place. “No, I haven’t. But—”
“Great date,” Tony answered, smiling as he let his head fall back to give Steve better access. “And the… ambience,” he breathed with a little hitch, as Steve’s teeth skimmed along his throat. “Really unique. Great choice of fun activity, too. You… you really know how to spoil a guy.”
Thanks to
“This is hopelessly cliché, I hope you’re aware.”
His eyes flickered to the ring on his own hand. There weren’t many things in his life that held true value to him, but this was different. This was something Steve had given him, and something that meant they’d share their whole lives together.
"You," Tony shot back without even thinking about it. It was the only reasonable answer anyway. Right in this moment, Steve was everything he needed, and everything that mattered to him.
There was nothing Steve could do but smile as Tony kissed him. As Tony peppered his face with his lips and whispered his confession into his mouth over and over again.
Steve shook his head firmly. Then, he took a step forward and pulled Tony in a hug. “God, Tony. I could never hate you. My sexuality aside, you’re my best friend, my… you’re everything to me. And… I’m glad it was you,” Steve mumbled, pressing his face into Tony’s shoulder.
Steve heaved a great sigh, walking up the stairs. And if he pressed a hand over his heart, trying to hold himself together while he very much wanted to just fall apart… well…
Dark brown eyes stared intently down into Steve’s. Tony remained silent for a moment longer. “You really want it, don’t you? It’s not just… you didn’t just settle for the idea because you want to make me happy?”
Natasha rolled her eyes at him as he pressed her up against the wall and quickly entered her, sliding to the hilt.
When Tony opened his eyes, Steve didn’t touch him again, but Tony could see that he wanted to; his hand hovered over his face for an instant before it was withdrawn, then came to rest on his own lap. “Hey… you alright?”
“And it was… she took one of those boats, the day she died?”
Steve’s mind was spinning. Why would Obadiah have locked the door? He glanced at Tony, looking for some sign that he knew what all of this meant, but all he could see was confusion.
“Not here,” Tony reminded him with a pointed glance down to Ian’s crib.
The limousine neared the mansion’s main entry and that was when Steve saw them. There was a group of strangers on Stark Mansion’s steps. The staff, Steve supposed. People whose station had been his own just a few weeks ago.
for it, either. The guy deserved it, Steve felt, but he knew if it came to court, that excuse wouldn't really hold. He assaulted a man. What was wrong with him?
Tony opened the zipper of Steve’s pants, and pushed a hand inside his boxers, pumping the length of Steve’s cock in slow, tantalizing strokes. Tightening his grip around his erection, Tony pushed Steve on his back. Steve let him have his way and only leaned up on his elbows somewhat. He drew his own tee over his head, while Tony rid both of them of the rest of their clothes.
* * *
“Well, according to my files, JARVIS decided to put faith into Steve because he had analyzed his affection for you as unconditional. He never had an ulterior motive. And remembering each of your interactions… I’m inclined to agree with him.”
He wanted that chance so
That surprised Tony. “What for? Afraid none of the other kids are gonna want to sit with you at lunch?”
Tony flexed both hands, while he logged into a different suit which was circling the carrier’s front, and took out most of the cannons and guns in one go. He flew sideways, taking a look into the carrier’s glass dome. It wasn’t overly hard to locate Steve’s form on the bridge above, what with his bullseye target right on his back. It did take him a moment to zoom in on Barnes, though, standing only a few feet away from Steve and staring him down with a cold expression. And Tony could’ve swept into the commando area in no time, but he knew what Steve had asked of him, knew he wanted that try… and for the time being, he would have to stay away.
There was nothing for a very long moment, and Tony’s expression remained unreadable.
“Jim,” Steve breathed, barely aware he was speaking at all. “Have you seen Tony?”
Inhaling slowly, Steve’s eyes drifted to the landscape passing by and he allowed himself to rest against Tony’s shoulder. Inevitably, his thoughts returned to the shooter. He hadn’t known what to call it thenת though he knew there had been something more to it than was visible on the surface. Those eyes had seemed so far away. A dead look that somehow made Steve feel like he was scratching an over-rubbed scar.
—and it’s alright. I deserved it, to some extent. But it’s… these days, people just assume I’m part of this world. So whatever comes out of my mouth might have serious consequences. People listen to me and half the time I’m still not sure I really get how this world works.”
“Sure,” he whispered thinly, but the pain was already fading into a dull ache, fatigue taking its place, and as much as he struggled to hang on—to see what had happened with Barnes—he couldn’t.
Steve just shrugged and closed his eyes.
“Are we pretending you care?”
“We didn’t mean to hurt anyone,” Pietro muttered.
He leaned forward until his brow was touching hers, his mouth provocatively near her own. And he wanted so desperately to forget about everything else and kiss her again until he remembered nothing else but her. Taste her skin. Memorize every inch of her with his tongue. Lose himself in her body. Bring her over the edge again and again, until all of his pain was drowning in pleasure.
Blinking, Steve stared down at his hands instead, moving them back and forth, as if they held the secrets of the universe.
He rolled his eyes and sat back in his seat. “Look, I tried to stay calm, I really did, but they couldn’t be reasoned with. This is everything we have worked for in the last year, and if they plan to boycott every single decision we’re making, then I can’t do anything but—”
* * *
How could it? His own world and Mister Stark’s… they couldn’t be farther apart. And once Mister Hammer decided to leave Monte Carlo, Steve would become a vague memory at best. He was a man of no money. No talents. Nothing whatsoever. A boy whose name would perhaps cross Mister Stark’s mind once every ten years. Why should he remember the time they’d spent together?
“Now—you gotta tell me to stop now, if that’s what you want. I—”
He’d never done this before, not with a fella, and Tony probably knew, but he didn’t call him out on it. Steve knew the basics, and everything else, Tony guided him through with little gestures and gentle words.
be safeguards,” Tony whispered against his lips once he’d drawn back a little. “We’ll find a compromise together, and we’ll work on this paper until we’re all satisfied with the outcome. I won’t force you to do this if you aren’t agreeing with every single word in there, but… sometimes it’s not enough to be against something, Steve. You have to be for something better.”
“We will?” he murmured, suddenly feeling very small. In a few hours, they would be going into a fight together, and he had no idea what lay ahead of them. He didn’t want to think about it. He wanted to keep Tony here. He wanted to relive this over and over again.
“I know,” Steve said, and he
It was too much. Barely a few hours had passed since they’d started deactivating the implants, and he was already thinking about giving up.
"Yeah?" Steve asked, taking it for what it was—a permission to get closer. He set down the bottle and sent another small smile at Tony before approaching the suit, which hung a short distance from them. He rounded it once, taking in the smooth edges and the seamless transitions between materials.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. “Kinda figured that one’s a pick and choose type of thing. Selective respect, you know? Wouldn’t want to be
thing without arguing with me?”
Natasha studied him for a minute and raised a tentative hand to palm his cheek. “No matter what they tried to tell you, no matter what they wanted to make you believe,” she said, thumb caressing circles into his skin, “you’re still you where it counts. Here…” She gently drummed her fingers against his temple, then slid her touch southward until it rested above his heart. “And here.”
So in the days after Lagos, the emergency plan they’d formed in case of another incident rolled into high gear the instant Tony, Maria and Pepper had started making phone calls. They had split into groups and had set up round the clock attendance, trying to keep the truce with the UN intact.
They walked down the street, checking the decaying doors and buildings for some signs that someone broke in. It took three blocks, before Steve spotted a shattered window at the end of the street. Since they’d walked around in a circle around the landing strip, the house was only ten minutes away from the airport.
“You gonna let me do it?” Tony rasped, the steady slide of his hips had Steve dangerously close to climax. “You gonna let me show you how good it can be?”
“Excited?” Steve asked.
He felt Natasha reaching for Tony’s hand as well, brushing a finger over his palm, and even though she tried to do it casually, Steve noticed that she stopped to feel his pulse. The steady beating seemed to satisfy her, and she smiled at Steve as she leaned back. “He’ll push through.”
Only very late at night, when Steve was alone and could not sleep, did the thought gnaw at him. How Tony’s skin would feel beneath his fingertips. How it would feel like to kiss him, having that goatee scrape at his skin. If he’d groan against Steve’s lips and how his breaths would quicken when Steve would put his mouth on him …
“Like this?” Tony replied on a loud gasp, his hand pumping their hard lengths faster, just in time with the heavy breaths rolling through his chest.
They sat him down on a chair and his fingertips dug into it, as he slowly raised his head so that he could see. And it was—
“Okay. That’s enough,” Steve interrupted him with a glance towards Wanda. Next to her, Pietro had fixed Ross with a death-glare.
Tony was quiet for a moment, probably weighing his words carefully. And probably also realizing that Steve already knew all there was to know. There was simply no reason to keep secrets from him.
“Babe, you lost your best friend. Most people would have dropped everything then and there… You only had a moment of doubt. And then you soldiered on. That’s what’s important.”
Tony huffed. It was such a Steve-thing to do. He gave a shit about people’s opinion when it came to them, and Tony loved him fiercely for it. Tipping the glass, he finished off the soda and put it back down on the bar counter. Steve pressed a small kiss on his hand’s knuckles, then led him to the dance-floor.
“The Avengers are not part of SHIELD. This is not my area of responsibility,” Steve continued and shot Fury a meaningful glare. “And this goes both ways, Nick. Next time you send one of my team members on a mission without telling me first, I will not let it slide that easily.”
“You’re trying to kill me, aren’t you? Death by greasy breakfast?”
In the months following the battle with Ultron, long before Ian was born, the government had requested a meeting with Tony. Back then, he had convinced them that Ultron had been an individual mistake, a horrible one-time thing, and that, in the wake of what had happened, there had been no way to save Sokovia from destruction—that they had done everything in their powers to keep casualties at a minimum. And thus, a fragile truce was negotiated.
“You like this?” Tony rasped, when he let go of Steve momentarily. He looked up at him, and the sight of him kneeling, looking as debauched as he did, had Steve’s knees tremble hard. “You like me sucking you?”
The air around them grew tight. Constrictive.
“Glad you agree.”
“We gotta get out of here,” Steve said. It was an obvious statement, but speaking was important now. For the both of them. “Bucky, please, let me get you out of here… You
The room was buzzing with chatter and laughter, and Steve simply let himself revel in it for once. At some point Maria sat down at the table across from Steve, raising her glass at him. “Really, congratulations to the both of you,” she said. “Pepper told me it hasn’t been easy.”
“Yes,” Tony said, his voice carefully neutral.
SR 3:55 P.M.>I’ll be there
The door opened. And seconds later, he heard her voice.
As soon as the words were out of Tony’s mouth, he got so red Steve was worried for a second that he’d pass out.
“Found it in your uniform, as usual. You’re such a slob, no one would believe me.”
That roused a short, humorless laugh from Tony. “Goddammit. Obi told me you’d say something like this. He warned me. Steve… I assure you, you’re being paranoid.”
That had Steve smile. “And the other Steve helped?”
Really, the situation might not be pleasant, but this was no life-or-death sort of thing. It would be fine.
Steve nodded. “I’m coming. Thank you.”
“Well. I got no company to manage,” Tony mused. “Nat and Rhodey are more than willing to put the newbies through the wringer.” He shrugged slightly. “I’ve got nowhere to be.”
“Since HYDRA is getting stronger, they’ll accept us as a first line of defense. They’re fine with us taking all the risk, but won’t give us the authority to actually make any sort of executive decisions. Our offer on a close collaboration is more than enough. I know it. They know it.”
“Charmer,” Tony said. “Come on, screw being sexless parents, I gotta have it. We’ll fuck every minute the squid isn’t around, understood?” Pulling Steve back down, Tony closed his eyes when he kissed the hollow between his pectorals.
Natasha clung to his shoulders and let out a mewl when he twisted his hips, rubbing the tip of his cock against a sensitive spot inside her. Settling his hand on Nat’s ass, he walked their connected bodies to the bed. Natasha released a breathless laugh as he pushed her onto the bed. Standing back up, he removed his boots and then slipped his pants off his ankles.
“Everything. What I’ve done. It’s like watching myself doing all these things.” Barnes released a long, quivering sigh. “I feel everything I felt then, but it’s… it’s different now. Worse, in so many ways.” The word came out as if pained; Tony could see him wincing as he spoke.
Steve reached to caress over Tony's wrist at his waist, his fingers light against Tony's skin. He hummed his understanding, then leaned a little back.
…he was the brightest still.
“What’s Project Pegasus?” Steve asked.
“I’ve missed you so much,” Steve whispered.
“Morning you two.” Natasha made a silly face at Ian, but instead of giggling like he usually did, the baby just started wailing again. Natasha pulled away, her expression turning a tad sad, as she said, “guess someone isn’t a happy trooper today.”
He couldn’t stop thinking about Steve.
Instead of letting him finish, Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s, and in seconds, they were drowning in each other again.
“You boys really have a problem with falling off of things,” she mused, while Sam did a U-turn, and rushed towards the ground. “Wonder how Tony does it.”
Tony clenched his jaw, struggling to calm down. His knuckles whitened as his grip on the phone constricted. If he yelled at Steve, it would only serve to prove his point. He also knew if he hung up, Steve would only call him right back.
Steve swallowed. “What is she talking about?”
It was all so very long ago.
For a second, there was a green shimmer in Clint’s eyes, but it vanished in the next. “That’s it?” Clint asked, putting the now-empty vial back into the chest. “Sort of anticlimactic.”
They were kissing, and then Tony told him he could touch the scars. Embarrassed, Steve allowed himself to more directly feel them. He'd touched them briefly before, but never truly investigated them. The play of dull and sensitive skin was tantalizing to watch, and Steve had to pull his attention away with conscious effort.
Bucky heaved an annoyed breath. “I’m busy!”
Some vague faith in the divine had returned to him after meeting Erskine, but World War Two had changed that. He’d never tried to let it show—although most of his men probably felt the same way—but after what he’d seen, and more importantly done, he had been convinced that life was little more than a series of events connected only by the people who were affected by them.
“Yeah,” Tony decided and smiled. “I’m perfect.”
Tony could not spare himself a small grin. “You sure seem to be pushing this ‘me and Steve’ thing.”
To try again had been a vague abstract. The thought of anyone else. But, for all the world, Tony couldn’t even summon Ty’s face anymore due to the way his lips tingled still with the echoes of Steve’s kiss. Steve, who clearly wasn’t even into guys, even though he’d kissed back.
. Down to the last detail.
“Tony, don’t…” Steve pleaded, knowing exactly what was happening, as he tried to get back on his feet with visible strain. “We need to get him out of here, we need…” Steve coughed, staggering for a second, and Tony turned around to really look at him, checking him for wounds, for anything, when—
“Tell her I’m busy.”
Bucky didn't say anything to that. Steve wasn't even sure he'd heard what Tony'd said, but
Also, at least Natasha seemed to think they were heading towards… something. And if Natasha believed in something, that had to count for something, right?
Ian chose that moment to smile at Tony peacefully and not say anything at all.
to know why.”
At that, Steve smiled at him—still loving him, despite it all, still happy, still wanting that future with him—and that simple gesture, it was the reason Tony’d come here. It was all of their million choices, the good and the bad ones, coming to one beautiful conclusion.
About four years later, Tony and Rhodey had found out that the
“Thanks,” Tony murmured, realizing it didn’t really make him feel any better. He wouldn’t worry so much if Steve talked to
Steve didn’t know if that should calm or trouble him more.
Of course, it was hard to say if they really could have a future. After all, Steve had no idea how long Tony could truly stay away from Hell. If he could stay here on Earth at all.
Tony hummed thoughtfully. He had a big duffle bag slung over his shoulder that he now let fall down on the hotel room floor. He turned back around to Steve and raised a brow. “And Barnes?”
Tony said, smiling fondly as he reached out in his mind. On a second thought, he took control of both DUM-E’s claw and camera, lowering the first until he was brushing cautiously along Steve’s forehead. Steve’s nose wrinkled slightly, but after a moment, he was leaning into the touch. Low murmurs left his lips, as he settled into the cushions more firmly, and Tony was almost sure he’d heard his name somewhere in-between.
“I didn’t have—I was over it, fuck, I was over it for good, and then the damn
from the last days, it was that he needed to use words that couldn’t be interpreted the wrong way.
Parents. Fathers. It was a bit crazy, sure. With Steve, however, it had sounded like something that
“Bruce… that could go so wrong,” Natasha whispered and the tone of her voice was a perfect reflection of what Tony felt: Awe, and a deep gratitude. “If you attack them, they’ll go all out on you.”
“Is that you?” Tony asked quietly, tone laden with emotion.
Being with Tony was like a forest-fire, blazing and all-consuming.
“Whe’re’we going?” Tony slurred.

“So good, love you, Steve, love you so much. God, this is so good…”
“I’m fine.”
Mister Hammer stopped him with another raised brow. “Do you have a problem with that, Steven?” His voice carried the hint of a threat.
“Yeah,” Tony said with defeat in his voice.
say anything about although those were clearly outdated, and Steve did have access to Tony’s movie database.
“Not likely,” Bruce said, shaking his head. “Steve—
“Uh, yeah. Sure,” he muttered.
Steve let his head fall back against the wall. “Another twenty minutes.”
* * *
He wondered often if going to the Sheriff and simply asking for shackles would be easier than trying to make amends.
The highway was a gray blanket of endless wet pavement, shimmering with the light of the early morning as they drove towards SI’s office building. Tony didn’t know when it had rained, and either way, he figured it didn’t matter.
“Thirteen on one,” Steve said, his voice unimpressed as he assessed the men in front of him. “Odds are pretty even. I’ll take my chance. You’re under arrest, Strucker.”
Tony huffed indignantly as Steve practically forced his butt onto the nearest chair.
underestimating you.”
He’d seen it all, not caring very much. He’d watched history unfold, and waited for the next order to arrive, only mildly interested in the disasters human kind wreaked upon itself.
At top of the tree you could see the escarpment that ran the length of the river. It was by no means the highest point in the land, but it did get Steve up high enough that he had a pretty good view up and down the river.
And their faces—their faces were laden with the horror.
How Tony could hate this man and love him so much at the same time was beyond him.
“I haven’t exactly…” Steve exhaled a long breath. “Just tell me. Please. Why are you so angry with me?” It was barely a whisper.
Tony huffed, reaching for Steve’s hand and cautiously entwining their fingers. “...you build something better.”
Ian was sleeping on Steve’s chest, his tiny face squished, his fingers buried in Steve’s shirt. Steve had his hand on Ian’s back, caressing him with soft touches. He could look at his son for hours, feeling his steady heartbeat, ignoring the movie that ran on the television completely. Only when he heard steps nearing, he glanced up.
“You can do it,” Steve assured him softly. “I’m sure of it.”
Tony cast him a thin, slightly pained looking smile at that, and Steve wondered what he’d said wrong this time. He fell quiet after that, but Steve had waited too long for finally talking with Tony again and he wouldn’t let this opportunity slide. “Alright. Your pick,” he prompted, trying to keep the mood light.
“We’ll work it out,” Steve interjected, and there was that smile again. A smile so fond and exasperated it really should be forbidden, because obviously Steve didn’t see how severe the situation was.
He loosened the hold on Tony's hands slightly, giving him that opt-out, if he truly wanted it. "And I'll understand if you don't want to take that risk anymore, but I can promise you that as far as I'm concerned, your age won't matter anymore."
“Tell me what happened,” Steve urged. “All of it. No secrets anymore.”
With his family at his side, this lost place in the jungle might as well be paradise.
. He saw things he forgot had happened… Like a door unlocking in his mind: torture, slaughter, and training others in their use. So much
He glanced over his shoulder, casting Tony a small smile and letting him pull Steve back against his sturdy chest.
“It’s all going to be alright,” Vision said, helping him shift position. “I’m here.”
“Look,” Natasha started, putting her hands on Steve’s shoulders. “I don’t know anything about shared dreams. Any number of things could have happened to give you these dreams. Perhaps it really was the serum, but I have no idea why you should share the dreams with a foreign person from another time. There is no telling, Cap.”
“Let’s just say that I’m sore in all the right places.”
Steve’s cheeks rouged. The tenderness between his thighs was foreign, yes, but it wasn’t bad. “A little,” he replied. “It’s alright.”
he thought, storing up every moment of this in his memory, not fully understanding why he wanted to remember this so badly.
“It was supposed to be a secret,” Agent Coulson said on a wistful note. “Fury will be…”
Steve didn’t know any motel that was called ‘Four Seasons’, but he was very sure this wasn’t the same rundown motel he’d gone to bed in.
It nearly startled Steve out of his skin to hear the name given life. Not ‘Tony’s wife’, not ‘Mrs. Stark’. Pepper had said her name.
?” Steve asked.
Dating a seventeen year old seemed to be alright for now, sleeping with one… not so much.  Or that’s what Tony thought was going on, anyways.
“I’m… not sure.”
It took two months and fourteen days.
Steve’s eyes narrowed, as he moved a bit until he could look at Tony. “Why not?” he asked. “You were right. I could’ve stopped this by signing it.”
Steve however, had no such reservations. He let his arms close around Tony’s waist, pulling him in; his body rejoicing when he felt the evidence of Tony’s interest.
“Hey!” Steve called. “Watch it.”
“He won’t.”
. He’d thought that about girl parts, too, at first, but the tiny hole there, it was—
“Are you… okay?”
“Not old. And I don’t think you need one.” Steve continued working over him, his lips and his tongue sliding up and down, licking and sucking him until Tony’s cock twitched with interest.
“I don’t brood,” Steve replied sullenly. “I’m just… thinking.”
Steve shifted in his chair and glanced at the inconspicuous clock behind the bartender. What was taking Tony so long? Did he not see Steve's note? What if he was in trouble and Steve was busy sitting here like an idiot?
“Prepare the next implant,” said the man with the glasses to the ones wearing lab coats. “We will begin with sensory deprivation next.”
It was futile. He knew it. No question about that.
“Someone has to tell Stark to shut off the damn alarm, that’s what,” Bucky said, and felt Nat chuckling above him.
good idea.
There was a moment of quiet, and when Steve opened his eyes again, he followed Maria Stark’s movements. How worried and urgent she suddenly looked as she leaned down to Tony. Steve really wished he could be consoling him, as Maria whispering in his ear:
Fighting the urge to simply stand up and leave the corridor, Tony pushed his face into his waiting hands. He could feel his heart beat against his ribcage, could feel an intense buzzing taking home in his head, drowning out every other sound.
“Did you install a sex swing? Or is this the moment you’re telling me you’re awfully into threesomes? ‘Cause I suddenly feel like we should’ve had that talk before making with the whole ‘til death-part’, you know?”
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
There was nothing for a long second. Tony tried pinging JARVIS again with no success, and instead, the other voice in his head had him stunned into breathtaking submission. Somehow it had managed to weave its way into the system without Tony noticing and now, it was everywhere at once.
“You know... I came to appreciate how good my name looks on you, Picasso,” Tony decided and sat down on the mattress with an amused grin.
Tony grinned. He reached for his fork. “Alright. I’ll give it a try just because you look so pretty in your apron.”
Enough until they could take Ultron down together. After today, he knew they could use all the support they could get. And anyway—Steve had realized by now that their attacking them in Sokovia and Wakanda had been motivated more by repressed rage against Tony and Stark Industries than anything else. And maybe they could still salvage this, have them get to know Tony. Maybe they could take them in, give them a home, too… even after all that they had put them through.
There was a heavy pause. Tony sighed as he looked up again. “I admit, I might’ve taken a step too far there, but… I can’t let them destroy everything we worked for all these years.”
Tony took a deep breath and offered Rhodey a self-conscious smile. “Alright, uh, Rhodey, remember when I told you that I couldn’t take astrology lessons with Mr. Brown in 8th?”
—but he found himself moving with Tony in no time. He followed him whenever he started to slide away, determined to keep him where he wanted him. Tony’s tongue rubbed his underside almost roughly, then took time to skim the length of him as Steve pumped himself between his lips.
“I don’t need your help,” Tony said. However, that knowledge didn’t stop him from leaning into Steve’s touch. “Ow,” he hissed, when Steve ran his fingers gently over the wound, frowning.
“Yeah, yeah…” Tony said and let himself flop down on the bed next to Steve. His hand blindly grabbed for Steve’s, entwining their fingers with little care of the fluids that were still right there. As if on a second thought, he drew his hand up and pressed a gentle kiss against Steve’s palm. “Love you, too.”
“Come on,” Tony grunted, after he tore his lips away from Steve’s. “Do I really have to spell it out for you? Fuck me already.”
And still, it was over.
“Yap. We got some solid data.”
Steve nodded, despite knowing that Bruce couldn’t see him. “I just…” He swallowed. “If he’s the devil, why… why is he even
Clint nodded, like this happened often, taking a few steps towards the little girl. “Why, she having a date tonight?”
For whatever he intended to say, though, Tony’s mind kept returning to one conclusion: ‘I’m in love with you.’ And, of course, the second Tony almost did voice those words, Steve put his knife down and cleared his throat.
The ground beneath Tony’s feet vanished, and in a flurry he was crashing hard onto the asphalt. It took a few seconds before the stars dancing around his head faded, even longer until he realized Barnes was standing over him, his metal hand closed around Tony’s left gauntlet in a death grip.
“You… are,” Steve said. “It’s just…”
Steve released him with a wet plop, rubbing his cheek along his length before taking him into his hand again. “Either I’m very good today,” he said with a smug smile. “Or you’ve just not had any in a long time.”
[F.R.I.D.A.Y.] [chat_server:46957]
It felt a bit obscene to do this with his pants still pooled around his ankles, but it sort of fit the whole scenario, so Tony went with it. Steve was standing there in full Captain America regalia with only his dick hanging out, and it was so unbearably sexy, Tony didn’t know why all of his brain cells hadn’t fried yet.
SR 6:44 P.M.>We’re wrapping up. Should be done soon
“There is no such thing as me ‘nearly shooting’ anything and you know it,” Clint replied, and as if to prove his words, he picked up a peanut from the bowl in front of him, throwing it right at Tony’s forehead.
Steve grinned, rubbing the icy-cold water out of his eyes. “And you’re a chicken.”
“Least I could do,” Strange answered curtly. The crooked smile on his lips was a little unsettling, something in his expression looking almost amused, but Steve decided he was probably just imagining things.
There were no words forthcoming, which was really saying something. When Steve started to push inside, all Tony could do was throw his head back and pant into the open air. It was slow, God was it ever slow. And Steve was being so goddamn gentle. He was thrusting forward, millimeter by millimeter, his movement delicate but torturous.
“Has been going on for a while.” Steve glanced sideways to Bucky. “I’ve meant to tell you, but…” He trailed off, noticing the attentive but otherwise very unsurprised look on his friend’s face. Natasha sported about the same expression, and Clint hadn’t even bothered to turn around from his seat in the cockpit.
,” Tony exhaled. “Or people who’re crazy about tacky Roadside Kitsch like pink elephants or something. It’s stupid, and a waste of our time and gas.”
Hence the
“Mister Stane…” Steve started, though his voice was hushed, as if he couldn’t form decent words anymore.
“Yeah, because your future is so bright and shiny,” Tony mumbled, though there was a hint of a question in there.
“I know. He can have his papa’s height as long as he keeps my hair,” Tony said fondly as he nuzzled the brown wisps of hair on Ian’s head.
Heat scorched Tony’s cheeks again, his hands curled around his shoulders in a frozen embrace. “I’m sorry about that. All of it. I don’t like my life without you. These past three months? Really sucked.”
The first stirrings of an unhappy infant woke Tony from a fitful sleep and he grumbled into his pillow.
Tony reached his arm towards Steve and blindly groped for the blanket, draping it around his hips. In a voice still considerably high-pitched, he said, “If this is about the repulsor system, I really don’t want to hear it. You
“Do it,” Peter said, staring at Strange first, then at Thanos. “And make sure he won’t see the light of day ever again.”
T’Challa hadn’t made it either, it seemed.
There was a significant pause at that; Tony released a quaking breath and met Steve’s eyes again. And then, pedal-soft, pressed his lips to Steve’s. “I can’t leave, yet.”
Then he grabbed a rusty butcher knife from the counter and held it up in the air, staring at Steve. He placed its tip on the island and dragged it behind him as he made his way around it, the scratching sound filled the air.
“What,” he breathed, turning around in confusion. He remembered walking through a door, and now he stood in what appeared to be another, much larger motel room.
Tony nodded, more to himself, a studious look on his face as he met Steve’s gaze. They didn’t break apart, not really, staying close as their breaths intermingled. It was amazing how weightless he felt. He had shared kisses with a number of people, but it had never felt like this.
—Steve realized. And that meant he couldn’t share any information with Tony at the moment.
Tony, grimacing as if embarrassed.
of each other, Tony,” Steve repeated, with a bit more force behind it. “We shared dreams while we lived in a whole different timeline. There were five decades between us, don’t you think that counts for something?”
There was a prolonged pause, and Steve felt the hairs on his arms stand on end.
“Every situation has its own imperatives. And the Eye is the one who picked you, not me.”
Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s shoulder blade, feeling the echoes of his strong heartbeat where their joined hands were now nestled against Steve’s chest.
Eyes narrowed in defiance, Tony huffed and sucked him in as far as he could. What he couldn’t take into his mouth, he rubbed with his free hand. He drew Steve in until his head was once again pressed to the back of his throat.
he thought fiercely.
“Things will change now, won’t they?” Natasha mused and Steve nodded, though he couldn’t yet fathom to what extent.
Bucky's eyes flew over the text for a moment, then he looked at Steve. "
Still, when Steve received Tony’s message that afternoon, he had to blink several times, rereading the line over and over again, so he would believe it.
“I know.” Steve returned his smile with gratitude. “Thank you.”
“Here we go,” he murmured, hoping Steve wouldn’t hate him for just showing up here, while all of the others were around, too.
It was strange. Thinking about Steve. Thinking about him in this completely different light. It wasn’t even so much a different light but a—
There was a man in a fine-looking suit. And Steve was almost sure he hadn’t been there a minute before. What on earth was going on here?
For the longest moment, Steve simply stood inside Tony’s room, taking everything in. And not for the first time, Tony wondered what he’d seen in 2022. Had this room been
“Because I’m nervous,” he agreed, chuckling at himself. “Was it…” He swallowed, feeling foolish and more than a little flustered. “Was it any good?”
“It’s started,” Natasha said, her voice terribly soft. “He’s tearing it apart… everything.”
The steps of the stairway creaked beneath Steve’s boots, softly but loudly enough to announce his descent. Tony looked up from his place at one of the workbenches, smiling at him warmly.
Steve had trouble holding onto the strings that kept his heart together.
“Tony…”
“Tony?” Natasha asked. “Oh, come on. He’s working his ass off to get Steve back. He isn’t fed up.”
“You’re tight,” Steve told him.
Bucky raised a brow at him. “You’re from… 2018, right?”
Steve swallowed. “And what’s your alternative?” he asked. “You saw what happened with Ultron, you’re not supposed to play God. There’s no way to tell what trying again would do. It could end the world early.”
Soon after, they had the two plates full of bacon and eggs, with a side of pancakes and salad. "Grab the sauce, will you?" he asked, nodding his head in the direction of the next shelf.
When finally Tony broke their kiss, Steve thought he might have a chance to regain control of his lust, but no. Tony once more fondled at his fly, deftly undoing his buttons, easing his trousers over his hipbones. In another lifetime, Steve would have pulled away. He would have been ashamed to want to be touched like this—by another man, of all things. Now, he needily arched into Tony’s fingers and groaned when they wrapped around him. Within moments of Tony touching him, Steve’s need reached a fever pitch too extreme to ignore.
Steve rolled his eyes, then he covered the comm’s earbud and raised his voice. “Maria, area is secured. Target acquired. Hawkeye is wounded and requires medical assistance.”
Somehow, he’d known that something like this was going on. Not that he’d…
And then, the warmth of Steve’s lips was on his own. The curve of his smile. The hint of mouthwash, and then God, his tongue. Steve swallowed him, devoured him, held Tony to him as his mouth opened. And as always, Tony was a goner. A complete and utter goner. He moaned and melted into Steve. The taste of him had Tony inebriated, lost, his arms locked around Steve’s neck without planning to let him go any time soon.
And yet, it was strange; the whole thing was just strange. Most of the time, Tony wanted to find a reason to get off the phone but at the same time, he’d almost come to depend on hearing Steve’s voice every day.
There was a flicker on the monitor where Zola’s face had been. It blacked out completely, and then, only a few seconds later, Tony’s flat, robotic Extremis-voice echoed across the space like Zola’s had done moments ago. “He wrote an algorithm. Clever, gotta give him that. It’s directly linked to Project Insight.”
Steve sighed. There it was. “What do you mean?”
She’d changed. He knew he couldn’t remember her from before, but some vague feeling had him realize that she had changed.
Turning around, Tony dropped down next to Steve. With a sigh, he leaned back against the wall and drew his knees up to his chest. “I have a feeling I just made my life a lot more complicated.”
He didn’t know how many minutes passed like that—with Steve marking every inch of his body. His fingers slowly—so slowly—opening him up.
“That’s a draw,” Tony said, glaring at Steve. “That’s not ‘papa’.”
Tony stared at Steve for what seemed like an eternity. He meant that, he truly meant that.
Steve sighed. “I know. But they can’t put us on a leash, either. We can only do what we do because we don’t answer to a higher-up of any sorts.”
“I don’t know what to tell you,” Natasha retorted, something like frustration flashing within her green eyes. “I don’t know what you want to hear, or what I can say that you haven’t heard already.”
“Oh, you’ve got to be
Tony opened his mouth to say more, but then shook his head, turning from the table. Something caught his attention and Steve spotted the UN psychiatrist outside. The man had brown, short cut hair, and a particularly serious face. He was tapping a finger on his watch, a clear sign that their time was over.
“Steve,” Tony said. A long, tortured groan tore through the air. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut. “I’m a jerk,” he murmured. “I’m such a jerk. Your first time shouldn’t have… but Christ, why the hell do I even
Steve had done some talking, too. About becoming Captain America, about the war, about what Bucky’s friendship had meant to him when no one else had ever looked at him twice. About how hard it had been to find his place here, in this new time.
It was, Tony realized. “Perhaps we should handle all our business over the phone.”
“You look tired, boss,” Happy said.
It was the first time Tony woke up completely encased in Steve’s embrace. Their first morning together had been great in its own way, but this… being fully entangled in Steve was something else entirely. He felt so close to him, and it was a sensation he never wanted to forfeit.
A sigh. Tony leaned back in his chair, his sunglasses firmly in place, and took another sip of his Frappuccino. “And you haven’t changed your mind?” He didn’t address anyone in particular, but it was clear who he was talking to.
Vaguely, Tony waved in the direction of his large couch in the middle of the room. “Have a seat? Can I… I don’t know, you want something to drink? I have… energy drinks, mostly. DUM-E’s smoothies are wicked, so I wouldn’t recommend that unless you’re up for a treat and… there might be a granola bar somewhere if you’re hungry.”
His body’s explosion was sudden but complete, and Steve didn’t allow him any reprieve. He kept thrusting into Tony, massaging his cock, obviously determined to milk this moment for all its worth.
Tony frowned, giving Bruce a confused stare. “I didn’t
Vision’s voice was as impassive as ever, and in the moment he trailed off, Ultron howled in pain, pushing both hands against his own temples as if fighting a giant migraine. Vision’s unibeam bore down into Ultron’s form, and Extremis felt the links in his system being cut one by one.
Rhodey shook his head, raised his own beer, and smiled. “I’m good.”
“I wanted to keep our life intact,” Tony admitted. “Look… moral ambiguity aside, you did everything you could to keep Bucky alive. You didn’t always analyze every step you took, but that’s you—your heart always leads each of your steps. And… my head’s running a mile a second, so I often forget to stop and ask myself if it’s truly the right thing to do.”
“Yellow?” Lila asked with an unsure voice, pointing to the last white spot on the butterfly’s wing.
“Stop what?”
Tony knew there were meetings tomorrow, a bunch of them in the morning, and probably some introduction rounds with the science department later on, but this was his company, after all, or would be, once he turned twenty-one.
“You alright?” she asked.
“Nothing much,” Bucky said. “We just stole some crazy doctor’s time machine in Latveria for you.”
"I am aware of that, Thor, but this threat is here now. Do you see anything from up there?" Steve asked, hoping to deter the demi-god's displeasure with the situation. None of them was too happy with it as it was.
Steve considered refusing, briefly, to encourage Tony to get brushed up and ready, but eventually there was no denying that bed-head and sleepy eyes. He sat down on the edge of the bed and leaned down. "The things I put up with," he muttered, though he was smiling. "Billionaire's morning breath." And before Tony could say anything to that, he pressed their lips together, giving him a thorough kiss.
And that was all. The silence encircled them once more. Steve pressed small, soft kisses all over Tony's forehead while their arms were wrapped tightly around one another. And however much the last hours had left Tony shaken, this was enough. Knowing that, at the end of the day, Steve was alive and still loved him—it was enough. Everything else they could work through together, everything else Tony could deal with—as long as Steve was still there at his side.
“Come on,” Tony called, pointing towards the elevator. “Bruce had an idea. And the others are already waiting. Let’s get to work, Cap.”
Steve paused at that, but eventually, he returned his smile. “That’s good, then.”
“Steve?”
“All sorts of things could be happening,” Steve said. “Don’t give up hope.”
He looked at the ring in his hand, then held it out for Tony. "I was going to do this uh,"
They didn’t do it this way around all that often. In fact, Tony could count the times he’d fucked Steve on one hand, but every time he did, Steve was more than eager. Tony knew that Steve normally liked to be in control, to have Tony panting and moaning beneath him. And the fact that Steve had decided to give that up from time to time meant so much to Tony he couldn’t put it in words.
“Maybe not,” Tony conceded, then sighed. “I… uh, I decided to give Banner full access to everything concerning the reactor. Data, prototypes, all of it.”
“No one,” Tony stated firmly, “except for me will be driving him anywhere.”
Tony clearly expected an answer, so he forced himself to say, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have.”
“He’s a giant brat.”
in my company."
As it was, T’Challa took over and it gave Tony the moment to look at the scene he needed. Steve had almost made it to the hangar, dammit. If he left now, Tony might never find out where he was going.
At that, Tony stood up. There was still a spark of pain shooting through his body, but it was manageable. He walked forward heatedly, pushing a finger against Steve’s chest. “You’re not invincible.”
He brushed his lips across Steve's cheeks, pressing his mouth close to his ear. "So hot, and wet and tight," he whispered, accentuating each word with a slow thrust forward. "And all mine."
He hadn’t even managed to tell her he’d leave the city tomorrow.
TS 2:21 P.M.>Captain America pinky swear?
Together, they made their way into the living room, and handed out portions of cake and chocolate mousse glasses.
“Shipwreck!” someone called. “Notify the Coast Guard!”
It wasn't long before Steve realized he heeded more. He was squirming, reluctant to say anything, but then Tony punched deep, and Steve's cock jerked with the sensation as he moaned out his surprised pleasure. He could come like this, he knew right then, on Tony's finger, but he wouldn't. Not this time.
Tony stared at the bot blankly, then, his voice very stable, “Let go, DUM-E.”
There was another lengthy pause, and Steve watched with shaking, trembling breaths how the three of them stood there, just staring at each other.
Tony moaned and squirmed beneath Steve. “I was busy being completely sexed out, thanks very much. Give an old man a break, will ya?”
, Tony didn’t feel any need to hurry this along. The finger went in relatively easy now, and Tony circled it inside Steve, moving just a bit deeper with every thrust. Only when Steve started to squirm a little, as if he was getting just the tiniest bit impatient, ever so subtly moving with Tony’s movements, did Tony push in fully, hitting home for the first time and coaxing a beautifully surprised moan off of Steve’s lips.
“The Hulk can take a lot, and… it’s worth it.” He glanced to Natasha briefly. His expression didn’t allow any objections. “
Oh. Dear. Lord. Steve was definitely bright red now. He was really doing this, blushing like a schoolgirl, because of some crass words. In his own dream. In front of a hallucination.
“Are you accusing Mister Stark of murder?”
“Good job, Junior,” Tony called.
Steve rubbed his forehead. “It never involved Ian before.”
“Guys, come on…” Clint said, clearing his throat, but Steve held up a hand to stop him.
Natasha sighed, and Steve didn’t miss the way she glanced at Coulson with unease.
Averting his gaze, Tony grasped said hand currently lying on the table next to him, and let his finger trail over the engagement ring there. “And what’s
Steve sighed. But instead of drawing back, he stepped even closer until he slightly pushed against Tony. “I’m sorry,” he whispered as he loomed over Tony. “You had me pushed into a corner. But I’m sorry. I know I never told you in person.”
"You miss him, don't you?" he asked quietly, trying to not disturb the mood. With Tony pressed up against his back, Steve didn't think the atmosphere could be ruined so easily, but weirder things had happened. He let his fingers wrap around Tony's wrist and pulled up his hand to kiss his fingertips.
He waved a hand at where he hoped Steve’s face was, then set into motion. “Gotta go. Miracles to drink, coffees to invent… Have fun working out or painting or whatever it is you’re doing, Adonis.”
“Perfect?” Steve echoed. “I’m… I’m really not.”
“Retreat?” Tony echoed, looking down on the ground. “Why retreat?”
They arrived in Lagos just as Rumlow had entered the IFID building in the city center. Whether Wanda and Pietro had gotten kidnapped or traveled with him out of their free will was still unclear, but the players were few—and Tony knew how Wanda operated. And while he hadn’t been here the first time around, he’d read the reports numerous times and it should be a piece of cake to take Rumlow out before he activated that bomb.
Steve was leaning over him. Bracing himself against the car floor on Tony’s good side, he lifted him up. Tony’s head lulled before coming to a rest on Steve’s shoulder,  making Natasha and Clint exchange worried looks.
great it had felt to be so close to Steve. And now that Steve’s arms were closing in around him, making Tony feel appreciated and safe and a lot of other stuff he hadn’t felt in ages… and sure, also unsurprisingly aroused, Tony decided to damn everything to hell and just go for it.
“Don’t worry,” Rhodey called over, but his voice was shaking. “They’ll disappear in a moment.”
“Just short of two days,” Bruce said, not quite looking up from his chart.
That wasn't Steve. And as much as it hurt that he had risked his life like that... it was also one of the reasons why Tony loved him. Steve didn't quit. He didn't stop as long as there was still something to fight for. It was what made him a hero. It was part of their lives, and at the end of the day, Tony needed to respect that.
