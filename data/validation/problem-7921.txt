think it ended when Crossbones shot me, and the fact that I’m alive means it’s over and done and it’s time to move on. In your mind the worst possible thing was fixed. The rest of it is just context.” Steve finally looks at Tony. He feels like he’s begging for something he can’t articulate. “My ‘death’ wasn’t your fault--and even if it had been--it wouldn’t have been the worst thing about Registration.”
Steve’s eyes go freakishly wide. Maybe it’s too soon? It’s been forever since Tony’s propositioned someone like this, what the hell is the right etiquette again?
.” Steve unstacks the pillows underneath his hips and turns on his side so he can face Tony.
Tony opens his mouth to say something about the obviousness of the choice, but his brain gets caught on one specific detail. “
Steve smiles and shakes his head. “The future. Yeah, of course, I’ll keep that in mind,” he says. They stare at each other for a second while Tony’s hand combs through Steve’s still wet hair and then grips the back of his neck. Steve opens his mouth like he’s going to say something, but Tony’s lips are on his before he decides exactly what. He, or Tony, or the both of them at the same time scoot closer to each other on the bed, and Tony’s sweat-damp body is pressed up against Steve’s sweat-damp body, and
, his brain repeats.
“The serum didn’t change how I think or what I find, uh,
Steve decides to do so and even lifts his hips so Tony can stack them below. Now, Steve's laying out with his thighs parted and his ass on display. “Better?” Steve asks, understandably frustrated.
It’s only because yawns are contagious that Tony stretches his arms to the ceiling and feels the sound of his own flow through his body. The lack of anything to do in addition to Steve’s reassuring company makes sleep look like an actual possibility tonight. He flops down on the bed and rolls to a side of his own. Steve turns off the light, crawls, on his hands and knees, takes over the little free space Tony leaves behind. Tony watches him rearrange the covers from out and under him, and the sight of Steve trying to figure out how to get himself under the blanket without moving Tony is very amusing.
It was Tony’s opportunity to squint at him, confused and disoriented. “You cannot mean….” He trailed off without a way to finish.
“It’s ok, darling, I get it, I’m just amazed you haven’t given me a concussion already.” Tony’s stepping farther away, turning around,
The room is hear-a-pin-drop quiet until someone in Tony’s periphery clears their throat.
“l won’t forget it this time, at least,” Tony says, smiling against his lips.
It doesn’t matter. Tony’s the one who always leaves.
Steve’s conveniently stuffed his mouth with French fries, a strange sight given he looks dead serious about his plan. Tony waits for him to swallow. The dab of ketchup is still on his lips and Tony really wants to wipe it off. “Yeah, I'll just say all that smart stuff you and Bruce are sprouting all the time. Can’t be that hard,” Steve says, before breaking into a smile and adding, “Don’t worry, I can be a soldier. Your facial hair doesn’t meet regulation.”
Tony pushes himself up to his knees so he has the freedom to switch the hand around Steve’s cock and use the newly available one to swat Steve’s arm away. “Relax, I got you.” So it turns out he’s going to have to use one of his tricks anyway. That’s good. He knows this one, and likes immediately how Steve responds when he presses his knuckle to the space between Steve’s balls and his asshole so that he can apply pressure to his prostate. Steve’s back arches at the touch, and that adds even more force between Tony and Steve. “Is that good?” Tony asks, legitimately needing to know this time.
“Yes, I did,” Steve says. The words don’t feel right, so he amends them. “I still do.” There it is--the sheer weight of Steve’s uncontrollable feelings will smoother their friendship. Nothing will be the same.
“That’s a car?”
Steve shifts. It puts more than a few extra inches between him and Tony and gives Tony the impression something’s being taken away from him. “I understand if it’s a problem. Like I said before, I just don’t want you to think it’s because of you if I can’t...in the future. It isn’t.”
“Are you ok?” I shouted.
He gets a pillow across the thighs as a response and he falls to his knees, dangerously straddling Steve’s hips while holding his own pillow to the ceiling. Everything goes still and quiet, leaving nothing but the sounds of both of their heavy breathing and Tony’s heartbeats thrumming in his ears. The look on Steve’s face--eyes blown, mouth slack--fuck, if Tony had thought he’d been imagining the sexual tension, he knows he wasn’t anymore.
Tony wills Steve to not say something stupid like
“Do we need to talk?” he asks. He’s staring right at Steve’s reflection. There’s a certain aggression in his voice--the kind that tends to raise Steve’s hackles. Tony expects a fight instead of a conversation.
“Go on, ask me,” Tony prods.
Tony bites his lip. He doesn’t feel good saying this, but honesty has to be a thing between them. “Yeah, but I made a couple of the meaner ones.”
“It’s a simple yes or no answer.”
Tony tries to save the conversation. “The answer could totally be ‘no’, or ‘not tonight’ or anything.”
, Tony thinks, but that’s probably not even enough to change his mind. The Avengers, as a concept, are so intertwined with Steve that the logo itself reminds him of Steve’s knees pushing Tony’s thighs apart while Tony tries to struggle against the hands tight around his wrists. “I don’t think there’s anything. I’m sorry.”
“Uh…” Steve begins. Tony looks up to see him wearing a towel around his waist. Water drips down his skin and the blush spreads down his neck to his chest. “Does it matter?”
“Yes, exactly,” Nathan responds and he has to swallow around the words. “I know we’ve never met, but--”
Tony kisses him like he’s expecting Steve to say no. Right away it’s weird; Steve remembers all of their past kisses. It’s hard to let the past go.
“No, it’s not.” Tony counters. “You’re dead.” He rubs his eyes, like it’s any way to make the very real Steve in front of him disappear. “Fuck, I thought I was done with these fucking hallucinations.”
That emboldens Tony to keep talking. “And I got this twinge in my back. Luckily for me, I had the foresight to include a hot tub in the compound. Somehow I’ve never used it in the last ten years.”
From Toni, delivered at 1:17: conveniently, i’m also business partners with their ceo, so i can get us easily a private booth in the restaurant
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:34: I’m sorry to hear that! Did you sleep?
“So I don't know if you know, but my company used to be a weapons contractor. It was basically all it was known for. Months ago, I shut it all down.”
“It's unimportant. Do you want to go for a run later? Central Park? I'm at Buck’s right now.”
From Toni, delivered at 17:28: come back to pick it up and i might show you how much hotter i can look without the jacket ;)
His concentration is snatched away when Toni suddenly looks down. Steve, startled, copies her and sees their still-laced fingers. “What, are we already in the holding-hands stage?” Toni comments with a raised eyebrow.
On the Flaunt cover, Toni is sitting on the ground, head tilted and knees spread out. The angle is a little sideways, so you don't see further than her inner thigh. She’s wearing a loose, off-the-shoulder blue crop top that essentially hid as much as her white bra. Her white shorts are, in contrast, so tight and cut so short that you can see, what, half her butt? Her tongue’s running over her lip seductively and her eyes are looking straight at the camera. Her right hand is over her naturally flat, waist-long hair. Her left is touching the floor in beside her left thigh, to balance herself whilst she’s leaning back slightly.
After a moment, Sam gives in: “An, uhm, ex contacted me. Bootycall, ‘course. She left this morning.”
Steve doesn’t add that her being a genius has nothing to do with her family’s wealth. Instead, he says: “I met Howard once. He's very sympathetic.”
He’s baffled when he pulls open the refrigerator’s door: there’s essentially nothing, besides for a couple of brown eggs, a half-consumed bag of multi-grain bread (who puts their bread in the refrigerator?), hardly any vegetables and condiments.
Steve let's out of a sigh. He was beginning to believe something bad had happened. A laugh echoes in his ears, before a grunt is heard: Sam does that when he stretches. “I'm sorry too, for not picking up yesterday. Why did you call?”
Steve laughs and squeezes her hip a little while doing so. “What happened though? Because, I mean, maybe I'm biased, but I really don’t see how anyone could hate on an angel like you.”
“Well, you could count my best friend James Barnes as my brother. We've known each other since we were teenagers.”
From Toni, delivered at 1:11: it’s 1:11. make a wish
From Toni, delivered at 17:46: i was half-joking about my last message
From fave beefcake, delivered at 7:44: Maybe :)
Steve luckily finds a parking space, near the Tower, and nudges the kickstand out with his foot. He’s at lost, ignoring what he’s supposed to do next. He doesn’t even know where he’s supposed to join her inside the massive skyscraper, not that he has either the password to enter it to begin with, or the crucial chip for the private elevator. Steve whips out his blue-green phone, hoping Toni sent him some kind of instructions. His heart stops.
The kid doesn't always listen to her, when all she wants is the best for him, which annoys and worries Toni, but they still care about each other. He started out his singing career fine on his own and didn't truly need Toni’s financial support, but Toni still forced him to accept her money so that he could get himself more sophisticated equipments and a better manager.
From fave beefcake, delivered at 11:03: You look really beautiful in them, Toni
To Stane, delivered at 10:10: The answer will always be no, Obi. Perhaps you should switch to Hammer Industries if you want to produce weapons so bad. I promise I won’t get mad and come after you.
“My mama, Sarah, died of pneumonia. My dad died not long after from an illness, too. We were kinda poor.”
“I don’t think we can. It’d be awkward if a fan recognizes me and causes a scene.”
20 minutes later, she steps into her bedroom, with the presence of Pepper, just as she promised. She’s staring out into the city, but turns her attention to the half-naked Toni, her arms still crossed and a filled to the brink pocket folder in her grip.
“Don't you find it frustrating how so many award shows are rigged?”, Bucky asks with an exasperated sound.
From Toni, delivered at 1:44: yea, honestly sometimes i dont even know how im still alive with all the bad habits i nurture
“You,” she finishes with a grin that could lit up the whole world.
“Right, let's go upstairs.” She takes a gulp of her drink before she starts moving.
To Toni, delivered at 0:46: Do you know Scott Lang?
Seeing that, 5 minutes later, he still has no response, Steve gets up from his leather couch to go brush his teeth and prepare himself to go to bed.
Toni doesn’t pretend to not know what he’s talking about, doesn’t trouble herself with a play dumb act. Instead, she surprises Steve when she bursts out with, “Sorry if it’s not mutual, but yes I do.”
He follows Clint to the granite-floored kitchen, where a plate with a yet-untouched enormous slice of chocolate cake sits on the counter top. “Want some?” Before Steve can reply to that, he adds, “By the way, they told me everything, and Nat even happens to already know her. When do
Peppers rolls her eyes and breathes out heavily.
Antonia leans back on one elbow and stares back with a coy expression. From up close, her facial features are even more exquisite. Hollow cheeks, chiseled jawline and azure blue irises. Her dark eye makeup does nothing but complement her eyes’ gorgeous colour. Steve notices an ear cuff on one of her ears’ cartilage. He discovers that he has an ear cuff kink.
“--you flirted with both of them - the girl was pretty though- and--”
“I have pasta in this floor’s kitchen and a pot of marinara sauce.”
“Yeah, you know that country north from the U.S.? I mean, I know the educational system isn’t good here, even though it is slightly better than in Russia, but--”
“Do you know,” he halts his words for a second, while rolling his shoulders, for effect, “how much an entrance here is?”
“I did, but I think it would be too late, even if I do go right now."
“True,” Clint chimes in. He picks up his empty dish and fork, bringing them under the faucet, where he starts cleaning them.
Steve shakes his head in amusement. Seems like it’s his destiny to be called an old man by every single person he knows.
He smiles at the memories of Toni squealing at the best jumpscares and scooting even closer into Steve's embrace. He'd squeeze her harder under the heavy, fluffy blanket. The third movie, being a comedy, was much less thrilling, so they easily passed out, letting its dialogues and soundtracks lull them down.
Toni gawks at her, appalled.
Steve’s level of anticipation for this date is almost unfamiliar, and last time he’s felt so giddy was probably when he dated his first celebrity. He quickly learned that social status does not erase one’s boringness.
“It’s okay. You don’t have to explain yourself,” he reassured her with a smile.
“Steve! There you are!” yells Bucky from behind him, making Steve whip around. Scott Lang, one of those pop singers whose songs are exasperately overplayed on the radio, is with them, his right arm anchored around Sam’s shoulders.
So she did hear Toni.
They dirige themselves towards an elevator hidden away. “Only 5 people have chips that activate this elevator. It brings us to my private properties, like my personal lab in the basements.” They get in it and Toni taps on the side of the elevator opposite to the doors. “The whole building is separated in two, but no one except the 5 people who have the chips noticed it. This is not a wall, this elevator has two sliding doors.”
“Good evening, ladies. May I buy you beautiful women a drink?” Steve says, holding his gaze on only one of them.
“Oh my god, can we take a picture together?”
Her mood darkens when she scans what Stane messaged her. She never liked him, and never will.
“I'm sorry. Is it too extravagant of a gift?” Toni looks at him worriedly.
Steve looks around. There are no rooms around him. Confused, he calls out JARVIS, questioning him where he is.
just because they wanted you in Los Angeles for the photshoot.”
When Steve lays his gaze on the woman, he takes notice of two facts: 1) He doesn’t think he's ever seen her before. It's rather unsettling, considering he is currently at a party thrown by a very famous actor (Charles Xavier) and his equally famous boyfriend (Erik Lehnsherr), which means that basically all the guests are celebrity. 2) She is, by far,
Steve hears the stairs make a grating sound. He glances in that direction and sees Bucky and Natasha coming down at last.
They move out and Toni leads them straight to the living room, where, on the soft wood brown couch, lies Steve’s precious jacket. He makes a beeline for the garment and drapes his back and his shoulders with it, tugging the collar twice for good measure. If he’s honest, he’d say he still feels like crap.
“Wow. This place is impressive. You designed it all by your own?”
“I can’t believe I still have so much to take care of even when I’m not the official head of the company,” Toni huffs, opening the shirts closet. “Should I wear my Bruce Lee t-shirt or my Duran Duran t-shirt?”
Steve enters the elevator with a plate stacked with food gripped by his left hand, a clear pot of oat biscuits squeezed between the inner forearm of the same arm and the left side of his chest. On the other hand, he’s carrying two glasses full of apple juice. Steve internally thanks his dad for giving him big hands and long fingers.
Next chapter might take a week.
From Hogan, delivered at 10:00: Noted.
From Toni, delivered at 1:43: [laughing emoji] its not my fault you text like an old man
Steve usually leaves before 20:00. The soirée would always start to really bore and tire him after one and a half hour. Sometimes his close friends leave with him, most often not, but he still makes sure to notify them beforehand
After they leave, Toni steals one of Steve’s wings and she moans while she’s munching it. He lays his eyes on her with an amused expression.
Mariah and him knew each other, because she used to help him with his economics. She unfortunately left for another job after less than a year, but they parted on good notes. It was never anything more than a purely professional relationship between them, anyways.
“Hey Steve!” blurts out a feminine voice from behind them. Clint doesn't even flinch, but Steve whips around.
Seconds after he hopped into his unmade bed, he hears a faint ‘ding’. Yawning, he goes back into his bathroom, where he left his phone.
From fave beefcake, delivered at 0:40: I already miss talking to you. Goodnight Toni
Toni wakes up snuggled up in Steve’s strong arms, both of them settled on the comfortable sofa in front of her gigantic TV. She relishes in the pleasure of his natural heat; he’s like a goddamn oven. She takes notice of his leather jacket thrown on the floor in the corner of her eye, before her eyelids fall back and she drowns in darkness.
To Toni, delivered at 0:22: I was texting a friend
To Toni, delivered at 1:45: You need to take care of yourself, Toni. We should really stop texting this late
Steve is admittedly a little disappointed, but swallows his dismay down and lets her talk.
When Steve displays a dubious expression in response, she wraps her arms around Steve’s neck from his side and cooes, “Oh, don’t be heartbroken, Rogers. Trust me. If she hasn’t made the first move yet, it’s definitely likely because she wants something serious out of this. Which is good news, eh?”
She was 20 and in her I-don't-care-I-do-what-I-want phase. The Cosmopolitan picture of her is raunchy enough (whoever runs that magazine really love to sexualise everything. They talk about sex in every single issue they release), but the Flaunt photo is pretty filthy.
To fave beefcake, delivered at 10:35: yes dont worry bout me
From Natasha, delivered at 0:18: You know, a reply would be nice. Unless you happen to be doing something explicit. In that case, all faults are pardoned.
From Toni, delivered at 0:30: okay. wow. yea, thats her. i can’t believe you know nat!!
Steve’s brain doesn’t register the information. “What?”
“Alright, but first, I really need to drink something” replies Steve. Steve takes her hand and lifts her up, before making her do a twirl.
He examines his surroundings and comes to realization that the dimness is solely due to how, somehow, the windows are tinted dark. He sighs loudly and staggers with surprise when a resounding British-- when
The bouncer gives them an once-over before clicking his tongue and snorting. Toni has a hunch that he assumes they’re just a random couple who believe they’re at any normal bar. She can’t blame him: she’s wearing a burgundy dress that looks more casual than the usual glittery and sexy type girls normally wear when they go clubbing. Sometimes, for some people, casual can be translated to cheap.
An idea suddenly pops in his mind. Steve smirks and snatches the food from her fingers, faster than lightning. H proceeds to shove it as quickly as he can in his mouth, all the while he runs around the living room to escape Toni, who's pursuing him.
She gets peered at the whole time the two of them discuss what they want to eat. They settle on a bombay soup each, with a side of spicy buffalo wings for Steve and a poutine for Toni. They buzz the glowing button and order in french.
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:44: I'm at a friend's place. He showed me the cover of some magazines you appeared on
Bucky picks a plum from the fruit basket in the middle of the island.
“From who?” The mattress creaks under her stirring. She blinks her eyes open.
To Toni, delivered at 1:42: You’re gonna make me sad ):
“I'm telling you, it’s all right, love. You know I couldn't care less about that meaningless shit,” Natasha tries to soothe him, wrapping his waist with her arms and leaning the side of her head against his neck.
He doesn’t feel a twinge of sadness anymore when he thinks about his most recent ex-girlfriend, Sharon Carter. They knew each other long before feelings got involved and fell deeply in love after Steve rescued her from a murderous mugger who must’ve also been dement, because he wore a grey bodysuit with a horrific robot-looking yellow mask.
Being somebody with a big artistic side, he likes to take his time to not only admire, but also to observe the beautiful things in life. So naturally, he starts staring at the resplendent woman, from head to toe. Creepy, he knows, but there’s just something about her that takes his breath away.
To Toni, delivered at 17:25: But why don’t you keep it? I don’t mind, and it looks objectively way hotter on you (;
Plus, she doesn’t just hear what Steve says, she listens and gives back smart remarks. In return, she likes to talk a lot too.
“And, I mean,” Sam grabs Steve’s shoulders, pushing him towards the bar, “the worst thing that could happen would be that you get completely and utterly ignored by her.”
While he waits for it to cook on a low fire, - he doesn’t want the exterior of the omelet to be cooked while the middle is still raw and gooey - Steve explores the brown cabinets. He lays his hands on three juice boxes, which he judges Toni for since those overplastified things are so harmful to the environment, and jars filled with biscuits.
Toni watched the motion picture the evening after Steve mentioned it to her. He looked downright delicious in it, with the full beard and the rugged looks, which is the reason why Toni immediately bought its sequel afterwards. Steve sounded thrilled when Toni informed him about it during a Skype call, and was glad she had wonderfully positive feedback.
Steve marvels momentarily at the coincidence that Toni interrupted him replying Nat’s texts twice. He sends his message to the latter before tapping on the former’s notification.
From Toni, delivered at 1:12: did u make a wish
Just as he hears Peter Parker himself come up on stage and start awkwardly with 'Uhh, hey guys', Toni tugs at Steve’s hand. He looks down at her and almost squeals; they’ve never been that close: Toni must’ve pulled her chair closer while he was distracted. He has to restrain himself hard to not do something out of place, like kiss her right here and right now at the sight of her simultaneously adorable and hot face. A grin painted itself on her red lips just as she leans her head next to his ear and says:
“Oh, those situations don't come even close to the weird shit I was thinking about.” She swallows and takes another bite, this time a bigger one, and chumps on it. Steve gives her an intentionally judgmental look while Toni tries visibly not to smile.
They laugh like juvenile delinquents and Steve merely chokes on the dry bread on two instances. Finally, with the couch in between them as a barrier, Steve slowly puts the last bite in his mouth, chewing it with a triumphant expression. Toni sighs and lets herself fall bonelessly on the sofa. “I guess I deserved that, but I'm still hungry.” She pouts, which would definitely seem ridiculous and childish if it were any other adult. Steve finds it endearing when Toni does it.
Steve's stupid brain flashes images of her being taken to bed by more than two men. His blood rushes to his face, and somewhere else. He finishes his food quietly.
Toni's more notable and most memorable photoshoots were with Forbes and Time. They both happened in the last 4 years. Toni sighs at the happy memories and fills herself a glass of water.
This time Tony’s heart
One nod of Steve’s head is all Tony gets for that amazing discovery. He has the fucking gall to look sheepish.
Steve nods and crosses his arms. “Yes, the Avengers. Now I know you’re on the fence about this, and I respect that, so I wanted to give you a chance to tell me what I could do to change your mind.”
Tony has no intention of letting him get a word in. “No, no, no, I get it, it wasn’t a big deal. Just a tiny tiff, really minor. Makes sense you would forget. It’s not like we didn’t talk for
Tony asked both it and himself. The hologram just watched back, eyebrow crooked. It wouldn’t talk until Tony wanted it to.
. Or as slow as he can manage. Steve’s breathing in this controlled and forced way and Tony just focuses on that—not the instinct buried deep within him to snap his hips further.
“All but one...” Steve holds out his hand, the one without any extra-proprietary time travel equipment on it, but pulls it away before Tony can even think to clasp it. He wraps his arms around Tony, instead, and pulls him close.
Tony sighed and pushed himself off the floor, leaning against the wall as he did. He itched to take the suit off just long enough to take a shower, but his heart was so weak it needed all the extra juice the entirety of the suit could provide. Which meant there was no way Tony Stark was going to be entertaining Steve anytime soon.
“Good,” Steve agrees. He pulls out a key from his pocket, slides it across the table, and motions to the waitress on the other side of the diner. “Could I borrow a pen?” he asks her as she approaches. Seamlessly, she hands one off to him, as well as a handwritten check, and doesn’t wait for Steve to scribble something down on a scrap of newspaper. “This is where we’re staying. Let’s split up, pick up what we need, and meet there tonight.”
“Nathan….” Tony’s mind immediately goes to the history books on that, but the more he looks at the man and the lines around his eyes, he remembers another person he might know. “Peggy Carter’s husband?” The smile breaks in that moment, and yeah, maybe Tony shouldn’t have brought up the guy’s late wife. Tony drops his gauntleted hand in some form of apology and is glad Nathan takes it for the olive branch it is by lowering his arms to his sides and taking a few steps forward.
Tony’s attention, along with everyone else’s, turns to Steve. “What’s that?” Natasha asks. It appears Steve hadn’t given her a heads up on what he wanted on the agenda.
“Fine. I’m fine.” His head drops into his hands and he wills himself to try the response again. “It’s awful. She believed we could do this and we actually did it, and she’s not here. I can’t believe Nat’s not here.” Walking around in the compound after they returned felt like walking around a haunted house. Everything was wrong; turning every corner was just another reminder. He wants nothing more than to drive home and hug Pepper and Morgan right now.
“Like we’re picking out wedding cake flavors! We’ve only slept together five times.” He sounds more hysterical than he likes. He tries to shrug it off. “But who’s counting?”
Tony turns to look at him. “So, what’s the worst thing about Registration?”
Steve butt in before Tony could even finish his thought. “I’m sorry, Tony. I should have trusted you.” Seeing Tony now, happy to just know Steve didn’t doubt him, drove home how hurt he must have been when Steve did.
It had at first been odd to look into the hologram’s eyes and also see the wall behind them, but now Steve only saw Tony. “I missed you too.” And boy, did it look like he meant it.
“It’s been, what, three weeks since we started this time travel thing?” Tony thinks about the last night he spent at the lakehouse with Pepper.
“Play your cards right, and you might get another chance,” Steve says. “I never thought—”
, and scoots close enough to Steve he can throw his arm across his chest. Tony can’t say for sure if he would have thought it was his fault that he couldn’t give Steve an orgasm; he knows he can take these things personally. But Tony is absolutely certain what Steve’s trying to say, and it isn’t about Tony. “I don’t care,” he declares. He tries his best to look serious. “Or I do care, but not in the way you're thinking in that handsome head of yours.” He locks eyes with Steve to add to the effect. “I just want sex to be as good for you as it is for me. That’s all I care about.”
Iron Man.
Tony gets it’s never going to be the same as last night, but he hates the awkwardness he thought they were past. The last time they had been alone—just earlier today while they prepared to jump from 1970 to 2023—they had been joking with each other. They had been
“Good. Because it’s not. Anyway—” Tony flails his arm a bit for a reason he can’t comprehend and grimaces when some of the water sloshes over onto his hand. “I just came to say that. About Pepper. And to make sure you’re ok.”
“Wait, wait!” Tony calls before Steve has made even two steps in the other direction. It takes him only a few seconds to stand up and arrive before Steve. “What if I want it to mean something? I’ve been in love with you forever, before and since, and always, and I’m supposed to just forget it? I’m supposed to just
“Yes. Perfect.” Tony returns to the previous position with a little more confidence. He strokes Steve’s cock a few times to show appreciation for his eagerness.  Steve’s eyes closed and his hips lightly rock in time with Tony’s hand. “You look perfect,” Tony says. He focuses on the place where the tip of his dick is nudged against Steve’s lube-slick rim. It feels impossible that he’ll be able to fit inside but Steve said he was ready, so Tony’s going to believe him.
The hologram smiled, a small thing, and said, “Can you get him up the stairs? He needs help right away.”
But there’s none there to give, no answer, no ending that will fix it, just moments through which he’ll have to breathe. Steve picks up the portfolio case and walks up the stairs to the platform, leaning heavily on the railing with every step.
“Sometimes, I don’t know what I’d do without you,” Tony says, and it hurts to articulate, because he knows what he would do. He’d live, which meant breathing and inventing and avenging. It meant moving forward but missing something so essential, everyday he was worn more and more down, his soul growing anemic, crying out for sustenance he thought he could never have.
That has to be why Tony doesn’t let the night fall away where it is, and opens his mouth instead. “This is nice. Been a while since I shared a bed with someone.”
Tony kneels on the bed so that he can loom over Steve. One-by-one, he tackles each button and keeps his eyes trained on Steve. The shirt soon ends up as a rumpled pile somewhere in the vicinity of the desk. Steve’s fingers pull Tony’s undershirt out from where it’s tucked into pants, and his eyes follow the hem as Tony pulls it over his head and throws it somewhere he’s not looking. Steve’s eager hands dart to his pants, but Tony swats them away so he can efficiently stand up, push them down, and kick them off his hips.
He had done the right thing.
Steve snorts at that, like he knows Tony could fit it just fine. “I’m sure we could squeeze into the garage if you insist. It’s Nat’s call, though.”
“For almost seventy years I’ve gone by name of Nathan Hale,” the man explains. He has a small smile, like there’s something a little funny about it. “And I need a favor.”
“It’s gotta be you, right?” Rhodey says. “Because this isn’t really Thor’s kind of mission.”
“Make a copy of your brain. Put it somewhere no one will ever find it. It’s too valuable to lose,” Steve pleads because he never wants to relive the moment Tony woke up and looked at him like the last couple of years had never happened.
Tony groans and switches to his other side in an attempt to stop his own thoughts.
Tony pulls down his pants in one quick, fluid, motion that leaves him unprepared and off balance when he finally has to slip them past his feet. “Why wouldn’t it be?”
“I have something to say.” Tony says it with conviction he desperately doesn’t want to feel. Somewhere in the back of his head he’s calculating distances to the Long Island mansion. He’s certainly not going to sleep here ever again.
, Tony types and hopes that’s convincing.
“Do you need help?”
It was as if the world stopped. The wind stopped blowing and the crickets stopped chirping. Tony forgot there was a horse underneath him, and that there was dirt underneath that horse, and anything underneath that. He watched Steve’s face and waited for him to move his eyes just enough so that Steve can see him.  “Steve....” he prompted when Steve doesn’t.
Steve fiddles with Tony’s crooked bow tie while Tony talks, just to distract himself from Tony’s mouth. “Leave?”
The call to avenge came just as Steve was about to fall asleep, filling the mansion so loud and fast that Steve was on his feet in seconds. He dressed so quickly that he was still pulling on his boots while he hopped out his bedroom door.
“As far as I’m aware” Tony says, which means that was where Steve and his band of runaways were as of the last time he checked. Which just happened to be this morning. “Have you been up all this time?”
Tony’s struck speechless. He’s too confused to know where to begin the line of questioning he needs, too overwhelmed to accept the premise of Steve’s words.
“Like what?” she asks, all innocent.
Steve hangs his head with a sigh. “I was going to take a shower,” he says. Tony swears he pouts.
“Did you see this view?” Steve gestures to the wall of glass separating the party from an infinite number of stars.
Tony doesn’t ask
He waits for Steve to wander into the workshop and in the meantime works on improvements to the Captain America shield. Steve eventually shows up, sometime in the early afternoon, and as he shuffles closer to Tony’s makeshift desk by the platform, Tony hopes he doesn’t fall.
Which also means Tony’s prepared to give himself the gift of forgetting if he needs to. He’s going to need to.
Tony stops the kiss to say, “Now everyone’s going to know when we get back to the party.”
“I don’t know when it happened. I just know that sometime in between the first and the seventh time I carried you home from the saloon, I fell in love with you.” Steve’s eyes were on something just over Tony’s shoulder.
“Play it back,” Tony said as he watched the blue glowing copy of himself in front of him. The hologram was slightly transparent, like the proprietary tech Tony had been developing for his communication devices. It looked just like him if he had been wearing a simple white t-shirt instead of being trapped in his armor.
He excuses himself to the workshop, feeling more motivated to solve the problem in front of him than he’s been since the day Steve arrived.
“Really, thanks,” Tony added, and he placed a blue hand that Steve couldn’t feel on Steve’s shoulder. “Iron Man wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you.”
“Yeah.” Steve nods and tries to smile.
“Is that it?” Scott asks.
>>A few days ago I experienced an Extremis-induced hallucination which encouraged me to make a copy of my own memories.
Steve’s eyes go so wide, it’d be hilarious in another circumstance. “Oh.”
“I think ‘Steve, I want you here with me’ would be enough,” she explains. Like it’s obvious.
Steve shrugs. “That’s not true. You would have found a way. Also, thank Scott. And…” Steve pauses and looks over the battlefield. Tony knows what he’s going to say before he says it. “And Nat.”
He was really close. Steve wanted to kiss him so bad.
>>Everything that follows might come as a surprise, but I had to do it this way.
Tony figures he’s supposed to say something, too, just to cut through the inexplicable tension. Or at least make it less obvious that he’s actually thinking about the cut of Steve’s pants. The room, already stuffy and too small, contracts a little more.
, Tony just wants to spend a little time with them all.
It’s a lie. There are a lot of other things he cares about. He cares that Steve’s very distressed, and has been very distressed for quite a while. He cares that no one took the time to work with Steve and try a lot of other things out. He cares that Steve doesn’t seem to think any one should have. And what he’s trying really hard
Steve hums something that sounds like a response, so maybe he just said that aloud. Vibrations travel along his nerves to his brain and seem to skip so much of his body in-between. And Tony lied, it’s not just his dick he can feel, because he also has eyes. And the view from up there is
Steve opens the door and steps out, “Yes?”, and yeah, Tony was right, Steve’s body getting clean did not do the same to Tony’s thoughts.
“You didn’t want to remember it.”
“I’m so sorry,” Pepper says. “How is everybody?”
Steve kept smiling, light and with none of the lost-puppy look he wore so often since they found him in the ice. Post-battle was when he looked the most serene; Tony was going to bask until it dissipated into existential questioning. “Iron Man, has there been any more information regarding your employer? The news has been stipulating all sorts of crazy things.” Steve’s tone made it clear what he thought about modern journalistic standards.
“I was born in nineteen-eighteen.” Simple, direct, to the point. Tony can do math, but he still wants to believe him when he talks with that sort of conviction.
“You can stay, you know.” Tony’s eyes snap to Steve, who’s holding up his pajama pants like he’d rather crawl through glass then put them back on. Since he’s now getting an eyeful of buck-naked Steve, Tony’s inclined to agree. “You’re welcome to sleep here. I wouldn’t mind.”
Steve’s completely naked and Tony’s completely not, so Steve’s hands urge Tony to take off his sports jacket. Then it’s the buttons on his shirt, but they take longer. Steve’s hands are clunky, his fingers huge, and it’s slow going as he goes button by button without opening his eyes or stopping kissing Tony. Tony’s sympathetic—he wants his clothes off as much as Steve does—so he shimmies around until he can push Steve on the bed. Steve lands with a thud and a creek of springs. He’s leaning on his elbows, staring right at Tony, and breathing heavily. Tony takes in the adulation with a grin while allowing himself enough time to finally see Steve. He looks as good like this as he had that night before the Time Heist, right down to his cock which lays heavy and hard against his stomach.
“I didn’t mean you had to get out—” Steve begins to say, but Tony waves him off.
“I made some of those memes.”
The world stopped. “Is it true?” Steve asked him, and
They stand there in silence while the party continues on behind them. There’s music and dancing and all forms of interstellar alcohol flowing. It’s by every metric a celebration.
“Kinda. If you have them.”
He can still hear the shower, so he knocks on the door and enters before Steve answers. Steve’s face peeks out from behind the shower curtain, holding the rubber cloth tight against his face like he has any modestly left to conceal. “What’s wrong?” he asks.
calling
“About the mission?” asks Steve as he takes back the patch; that’s the moment Tony notices his fingers had been fractions of an inch away from Steve’s.
, they can barely manage to make the loop for a fifth try, and when they do, the bow comes out crooked. Steve pulls loose the knot and starts again.
Tony turns so that they’re face to face. “You should really get that looked at,” Tony says as he gestures to the broken arm Steve is using his shield to brace.
And Tony sighs, because Steve always sees things in black and white, always as the world is, not what it could be. He confesses, “I’m not going to let go. And someday, you’ll want me to.”
What if they were somewhere else, some one dimension? Maybe I was all alone. I fiddled with the armor faster, pouring all my focus onto getting it running again so that when I did find Steve and Thor, I’d be ready.
close to just telling Steve
Tony shimmies closer. It’s beginning to dawn on him that this is a big fucking deal.
Silence followed. Steve didn’t know what to say. Luckily, the thing in front of him did. “You may be wondering why I’m blue, and you, know…” he waved his arm and Steve saw the wall behind it the entire time. “See-through.” Steve nodded, because yes, he was wondering about that. “What you’re looking at is a hologram of me. I know you’ve heard that I’ve been missing in action, but I’ve just been working on a very important project “
? How does that even work?”
“Ok,” is all Steve says. He’s studying one of the newspaper clippings that’s framed on the wall; it’s about Natasha’s congressional hearing a few years ago. The lines on his face are furrowed in concentration; there is a look in his eyes that Tony doesn’t like. It’s a look he’s seen on Steve too often and one he never learned how to handle without a joke.
“Exactly,” Steve responds. “And since we also need to return Thor’s hammer, there are only two of us who can do the job.”
Steve was silent. Tony finally stole a glance at him and saw how the moonlight illuminated his hair. He had changed from his blood stained clothes. Without the blue vest and his sheriff’s badge, he didn’t look much like how Tony remembered him. Somehow though, Steve looked more like himself.
, not to put any emphasis on the ‘you’. It comes across despite that.
“Fuck it,” Tony swears as he steps out of Steve’s reach. “I don’t need this right now.”
“It’s fine.”
“I hope you’re not actually going to sleep on the couch,” Steve says, closer to his ears than Tony was expecting.
and not the Supreme Leader. He’s the best person Tony knows. They aren’t the same.
“Ok,” Tony says, and the word breaks in his throat.
“It’s not the type of thing I have much of a choice with.”
Steve’s head tilted up and he tried to say something, and now I knew I hadn't heard because he couldn’t barely form words.
Tony’s mouth opens, closes, and he squints his eyes. The answer is going to be ‘yes’ because neither of them have anything to sleep in and because Tony’s not really the type of person to be put off by someone’s thighs, but he can’t get it past his lips.
“That’s fair…”
Steve’s forehead creases in a way that is too adorable for a grown man. “How long?”
. “I think it missed the important stuff.”
It was by the skin of his teeth that he made it back to the mansion and the privacy of the office. There it was safe to remove the helmet and his gauntlets. He left on the rest of the armor to absorb all the charge he could get before someone came around looking for either him or Tony, not the true agglomeration of the both of them.
The world has stopped, and Tony feels like all of his ability to process feelings has stopped with it. He’s overjoyed that Steve’s here, warm and safe, and all by his side, but that joy is confused, tempered, broken by the voice in his head that keeps telling him Steve is only looking at him like that because they might as well be the last people alive.
“I hope you will.” It was the honest thing to say, even if made the hologram’s shoulders slump.
But Steve’s just sitting there, eating like New York City diners are time’s great constant, too busy devouring his burgers to even shrug off Tony’s compliment. “I’ve been trying to research what I can,” he says, and pulls out a couple of different newspapers, all in black and white, and all with headlines about the US Military. He then sets one in particular in front of Tony. There’s a large black and white photo of a young Hank Pym explaining something to a few soldiers. “This one mentions Camp Lehigh. It looks like SHIELD’s been busy.”
Wong smiled. The air in the room change somehow--it was now less stifling. “I bet right now you’re thinking about having one of those pies Mrs. Parker makes.”
One and a half of the gym’s walls are made of glass, and it’s the gentle moonlight that makes it possible to see the edges of Steve’s muscle as he stretches. He’s wearing one of those tight swimshorts Olympic swimmers use. It’s not quite a Speedo, but
“This should be illegal, it’s so fucking hot. You make it so good. Watching you—You’re so filthy. I wish I had a picture of this.”
Steve shakes himself out of whatever train of thought his brain fell into. “Tonight’s good. Are you asking, about, my...um preferences?”
A thought pops into Steve’s brain, small but loud, and it explains everything. “Was it something I did?” he asks, because he needs to know. If he knows, he can fix it.
“Tony Stark--” Tony preferred to refer to himself by his full name when he was Iron Man, it added a small layer of separation, “--just needs some time away from the public eye, but he’s doing good. I’ll tell him you asked.”
Turning his brain off doesn’t work. So what if Steve just admitted that watching Tony’s sex tape was part of his regular rotation? So what if Steve was so embarrassed he had to remove himself from the situation? That didn’t mean anything. It didn’t
Then Steve’s leg slots between his and Tony thinks,
“You think?” I didn’t feel an ounce of embarrassment with how hysterical I sounded.
“I got nothing.” Carol’s hologram shrugs.
Tony feels Steve’s words all the way down to his toes. It’s a fantastic idea, dirty in a way he’d never expect from Steve and therefore even more hot. Unfortunately his phone is in his pants and
” Tony asks, completely surprised. Natasha is unfazed and keeps looking at him like she expects him to share his deepest thoughts. So Tony tries. “I don’t even know where to start with that one.”
. “You’re never going to forget that, are you?” Not that he expects him to, just that he thought…they are going to pretend to forget it.
“Here is fine,” Steve says and looks at a spot somewhere past Tony’s shoulder. “I’ve already said my goodbyes.”
“To thank you for all you’ve done for this country?” It’s an obvious misdirection on Tony’s part, an attempt to draw Steve into a comfortable back-and-forth like they had before.
, he thinks. It takes Tony a few moments to realize he's not supposed to be looking and snap his eyes back up to Steve's.
Luckily, he’s alone for now. He can think a little more clearly without Tony right next to him. He wants to believe he’s a forgiving man. He honestly believes he’s forgiven Tony and he knows intrinsically Tony’s forgiven him. But there’s something underneath all of that, something that defies forgiveness. Something that--
It’s not easy. Steve releases one leg and it wraps around Tony’s waist, drawing him even closer while leaving a hand free to take over for Tony’s attempts at getting him off. For a second Tony’s offended, but then he gets an eyeful of the way Steve touches himself and it’s more than enough. He uses long, slow strokes which start all the way at the base and don’t stop until his hand closes tight around the head of his cock. “Yes, yes, yes, right there—just like that. It feels so...good. You’re so
“I’m not tracking,” Steve replied.
Until now.
Steve had barely slept all night—one ear and eye open waiting to be there for Tony in case he needed him. So when the birds started chirping around five in the morning, Steve got up, and got ready to go for his morning run. The serum made it so he could function without any sleep for a few days at a time, but that didn’t mean he enjoyed it.
It made him want to scoop Tony up and reassure him that everything will be alright until he believed him. Steve would do that for decades if that is what it took, because Tony deserved the world and much more.
Steve knew he had good qualities as himself, too. He was not fully delusional. He prided himself in his tenacity, honesty, loyalty, and compassion. But those were not unique qualities, especially not among the Avengers. So how much did they matter really?
“I think I like it.”
Inside the paper was a black art folder that contained several marvelous sketches of the Iron Man armor, Tony working in his workshop, Tony laughing with Morgan, and Tony with his arm around Peter. The detail was magnificent—they were utterly beautiful. Just as beautiful as the man who had drawn them. He looked over at Steve, mouth hanging open a bit, and eyes watering.
“Since two weeks ago, they have started touching each other more. You know—little touches—on the arm, in passing, like a quiet acknowledgment of something unspoken. And if they’re not attached at the hip on the couch, they’re entirely avoiding one another,” she explained. Natasha turned around, her back facing Bucky, the zipper on her off-the-shoulder green velvet dress undone. “Can you zip me up?”
It was too much too hold in.
“Tony—Steve’s just trying to be supportive. We all are. I hate to break it to
“There’s a lot of things about me that would surprise you, Tony,” was his mysterious reply. And with that he stood and walked over to Peter and Morgan. He swooped her up in his arms and spun her around before looking back at Tony, who was gaping after him and dumbfounded. “Come on Stark, the meteors won’t wait for us.”
Steve entered Tony’s shop feeling more apprehensive than usual. He carefully held the now framed sketch behind his back so that Tony did not see it right away.
“How’s it looking up there Tony?” Bruce yelled over the coms, taking out three Chitauri with one big swing of a fallen pole.
“But it isn’t that simple, and not even your All-American—“
He looked ahead—the Avengers Tower was in sight—and it didn’t look pretty. The ground below was littered with silver robots that were clearly built to deal damage but could not withstand any.
When Steve looked up, Carol was standing over Stane’s lifeless body, breathing heavily. Friday had flown the Iron Man suit with Pepper inside out of the building and down to the quinjet.
“Better hurry up, you don’t want to keep your boyfriend waiting!”
“I think I did.”
It had been insanely flattering to have the Tony Stark make flirty comments his way, both then and now. Eleven years ago Steve had read Tony’s file—the man’s illustrious lifestyle and desirability preceded him. There wasn’t a man or a woman that could resist throwing themselves at him. Tony had grown a lot over the years—he wasn’t about taking everything, or everyone, he wanted with reckless abandon anymore. But one thing that had not changed over the years was that he could—if he wanted someone in his bed, he could have them there in minutes—which made having any single Tony Stark flirtatious line thrown his way thrilling. And flattering. And maybe some of his favorite interactions he got to have with him.
And yet, hearing it said like that sent a waves of excitement and relief down his spine. The anxiety would probably come later—but for now it was nice. It was thrilling to make it a little bit real. Suddenly, the possibilities started bubbling up in Tony’s chest and he couldn’t hide the small smile that grew.
“What are you two up to?” he asked, trying to steal a glance at what was on the screen but Tony contorted his body away from him to keep it hidden.
Steve, Nat, and Rhodey rushed in right as Tony threw his phone across the living room. It smacked against the wall and landed to the floor with a thud.
“Tony,” Nat jumped in, her tone gentle and nonjudgmental. “What happened? You were doing really well.”
When they stood, Tony’s previously injured leg gave out on him and Steve caught him. Tony cursed under his breath and Steve could have sworn his cheeks were red.
“Peter—god, no, we are definitely talking about that later. No this is,” Tony took a deep breath. “This is about the last time you were here.”
Tony kept his eyes on his feet, grounding himself, but he finally began to speak.
However, the ache in his chest was an entirely different feeling but he pushed it to the side for later.
“Don’t worry, you’re not dead,” she chided.
He smashed the heels of his hands into his eyes.
She took another sip of her coffee before sighing loudly.
Now there were years of time and space between the hostility of the early days and where they were now, but one thing remained the same: Tony’s infinite intelligence. Steve did not think of himself as dumb, his awe of Tony’s own brain was not done out of comparison or self-deprecation. In fact, Steve was confident in his own mind, his ability as a tactician, and his willingness to learn anything new. No—his fascination for Tony’s expansive mind was pure and honest enchantment.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Steve whispered, captivated by the warm and loving expression Tony was wearing.
It went like this.
When Tony sat down on a barstool at the kitchen island, Steve handed him a mug full of coffee and placed a plate of food in front of him. Tony smiled happily up at him, still shrouded in sleepiness, and barely functioning.
Tony’s cheeks gradually got redder under Steve’s gaze until he broke, “Take a picture, it will last longer Rogers.”
“Right, well, I have a company to run and construction to organize for the tower, so Morgan and I are heading out, okay?” Pepper smirked, planting one kiss on his cheek before standing up to leave. He caught her wrist before she could go, his expression open and vulnerable.
The clock across the room eventually came into focus—it was just after noon. That meant it was approximately twelve hours after they have gotten the assemble call for Stane’s attack on the Tower. God—where had the time gone? How did he end up here?
“Hey Tony,” he said, slowly approaching him and sitting on the edge of his bed. Tony was sitting upright near his headboard, legs crossed, smiling.
Tony had no clue how much time had passed between the opening of the bottle and when Steve knocked on his door, but he knew it had been at least an hour.
He had thought that he and Steve were on their way to good footing—their conversation had been hard and awkward—but it had been good, right? After dinner he wasn’t so sure anymore. And god, he hated not being sure about something. He had half a mind to storm over to Steve’s room, bang on the door, and demand an explanation.
“So, Natasha probably told you about what happened,” he started.
“Tony, we did it—“
“Aye, aye Captain,” Tony laughed as Steve steered him away.
“That good, huh?”
Even the thought of amber liquid sliding down his throat, burning, stirred an unholy excitement in his belly. Maybe, just this once, would not be a mistake. It was a celebration—he had not seen Tiberius in years—and they deserved to enjoy themselves. How could that be a bad idea? It would be like the good old days in college. Just this once. And no one had to know.
Tony and Carol were flying side-by-side, with Steve, Bucky, and Nat in a quinjet close behind. The signal was for an attack on the Avengers Tower. Friday was rapidly listing off the details of the situation, information scrolling by Tony’s eyes within the helmet.
“Listen, Spangles, now is not the time. I’m not really in the mood for a lecture. In fact, I doubt I could even hear it over the sound of my headache,” Tony snarled, defensive, and feeling cornered.
It was the night of the Stark Industries Gala and the Tower was done up to the nines.
But recognizing feelings and doing something about them were two separate things.
“Tony.”
Sam and Bucky got up and started clearing the table, while the others continued their conversation. Once the table was cleaned off and Wanda went to help the boys do the dishes, Tony stood up to stretch, stumbling to the side in the process.
“I was just so—well, I still am so nervous and I was hoping a good sparring match would knock it out of me,” he looked at Bucky accusingly. “But it didn’t and I couldn’t hold it in anymore. So here we are.”
“Okay, good. I’m just making sure.”
He empathized with Tony. Thinking about the pain, the fear, that Tony must feel was heart-wrenching.
“It is a Stark Industries phone—it won’t break,” he growled, refusing to look their direction.
He refused to fully admit just how badly things went downhill after they successfully pulled off the Time Heist. However, everyone else around him never missed a chance to point out how off Tony was behaving.
“Oohhh—yes!” Morgan said, jumping out of Pepper’s arms and rushing out to be with Nat—who was apparently just outside which meant Pepper came here to talk more than she did to check in on how he was doing. Tony’s heart sank.
“Steve, it’s okay,” she started. “But you do remember Carol is a lesbian, right?”
“And why not?” Peter asked, sounding genuinely concerned, the grin fading.
They rocked together—enveloped by Tony’s hands—closer than ever before.
“I’m sorry, okay? I’m the leader, it feels like this one is on me, and if we had lost you I wouldn’t know what to—“ a lump in his throat cutting him off, Steve adverted his eyes, and clenched his fists in his lap.
The thoughts of all of Tony’s flirty quips over the years flashed to the front of his mind again. He went bright red and hot.
Regardless, Steve was grateful that Tony kept his invitation to join him in the permanently workshop open. Now it was part of his daily routine to wander down there, make a nest on the couch, and sketch for hours on end. And he was lucky to have the perfect model unknowingly wandering around and posing throughout the room.
“You should go,” Tony interjected, standing up and looking Ty in the eyes. “You need to go, actually.”
His heart was swelling with joy at the sight. And there was a noticeable presence of butterflies in his abdomen. But instead of questioning these feelings he just let himself feel them, because, well—they felt
(See the end of the chapter for
“Traitor,” Tony grumbled, shaking his screwdriver at the ceiling.
Becoming aware of his own faults, through seeing them in someone else, was suffocating. He felt the tide of his mistakes rising, choking him, and engulfing him entirely.
Tony took some shuddering breaths as Steve rubbed his back. He could feel Steve’s touch drawing him out of the panic and grounding him. They sat in companionable silence for the rest of the car ride—Tony’s heart going back to normal the further they got from the city.
“Thanks Happy,” Tony said over her shoulder, giving his longtime friend a smile.
“Well, I guess that means when it gets dark soon, we’ll have to go up there to watch, doesn’t it? Right, Tony?” Steve looked over at him with a smirk on his face, and Tony knew the bastard was aware it would be Morgan’s bedtime soon and that he was making promises to earn her favor. Little did Steve know he did not have to do a damn thing to make Morgan love him—he was, quite literally, her hero. She slept with a Captain America plush toy, for god’s sake. And Tony considering protesting, reminding them of Morgan’s bedtime, but then he saw her big, curious eyes and he was a goner. Pepper would yell at him later, but how could he resist watching a meteor shower with his daughter, Peter, and Steve? God help him.
“When I was given the mission of observing Tony as his secretary, Tiberius was still in Tony’s life. They were,” she inhaled. “Friends with benefits. Tony’s file said their previous endeavors to date seriously had ended in a volatile fashion. Anyway, I walked in on them once. Worst day of my life.”
Steve gently laid Tony onto his back on the bed, hovering over and waiting to see what this moment was meant to be—he would never overstep his bounds with Tony. The ball was in his court right now.
“Yeah—you know what, Cap? You can take your too-little-too-late caring and shove it right up your perfect star spangled ass.”
“The night is still young. They’ll notice we’re missing soon,” Tony said. It made his heart drop, but it was reality.
“Y’know Shellhead, I’m smart—we all know that—but I don’t know why they haven’t summoned your brilliant brain up there yet. We could definitely use you,” she responded, leaning into Tony a bit, returning the affection.
“Yeah, didn’t think so. Your crush ain’t on Tinder anyway,” Bucky commented, opening the fridge and taking out a plum.
“You’re absolutely amazing and I love you so very much,” Tony cooed.
Nat was not exactly secretive in her teasing of Steve and the way he stared at Tony. He wasn’t an idiot either—he was aware that whenever Tony spouted off something brilliant or puled a heroic move in the middle of battle that he was prone to beaming at him in a way Nat called like an “enamored high school girl”.
Resigned, he sat there and sobbed to his heart’s content. Steve never gave himself permission to cry. He was a soldier, the leader, and he maintained his emotional strength at all times. But even a leader needed to cry. It was something he allowed only when in solitude and only when it became too much to hold in.
“You’re going to leave. Now. And you will never come near Tony again. You hear me?” Steve whispered, his voice low and deadly. Tony was not sure if he was terrified or turned on.
This was the moment—the big one—where Tony finally realized what he meant to Steve. And the gravity of it was not lost on him—his stomach was full of butterflies and he was fairly certain his hands were sweaty.
“Yeah well, you know me,” Tony grumbled.
His name was Adam, he was in his thirties, and had been in recovery for 10 years. He started drinking at age 12 to avoid dealing with his parents’ abusive relationship. Though he was younger than Tony, he was aware that Adam was wise—especially when it came to wrestling with alcoholism—and that he deserved respect.
“Oh god—Tony, are you okay?” Steve’s tone of voice completely changed. He shifted inwardly towards the other man, frowning with worry, and almost checking him over for emotional damage.
“I am surprised you did not attend an art school.”  He said later, sitting across from Steve in the hidden barracks at headquarters.  He finally knew why he was there at headquarters, why so much secrecy shrouded everything surrounding Dr. Erskine’s work.  After so long being told he was not what the army wanted, he would have his chance, provided he lived through the procedure.  It was daunting to think about, no matter how Steve turned it over in his mind, but he was determined not to let everyone down.
“I'm all yours Sweetheart, you don't have to worry. Been yours for a while now, I was just waiting for you to notice.”
“Our date got interrupted.” Tony murmurs against his lips after an indeterminate amount of time. It's the first time Tony has brought up their dates without being prompted first, and Steve feels a hot burst of joy unfurl in his chest.
He carefully draws Tony's hand out from beneath his shirt.  It's warm, well manicured but callused. Steve brings that hand up and drops a kiss over Tony's knuckles; freezing when he realizes what he's done.  Maybe it's too much, too sappy and foolishly needy, but then Tony lets out the softest of sighs and presses closer against his back.
“Tony.” Brown eyes snap to him, there's a vulnerability there Steve knows would be all too easy to trip over, knows without a doubt that he's just a few ill said words from having the curtain drawn down.
It doesn't take long to make it there. Steve gets momentarily sidetracked by a magazine left laying around. Tony is on the cover. His camera ready smile is on, but his eyes are guarded. The article is an interesting one though, and never let it be said that Tony Stark gives a boring interview.
“True, but I know how you get all flushed, and I do really, really love it big guy.  I think it’s pretty, I think
“You're still here.” Tony whispers, standing in their doorway three days later. The light of the reactor casts long shadows around the room, they shorten when Tony steps inside, letting the door snick shut behind him.
as he reaches back with one hand, hooks a finger in the thong, and spreads himself apart. There's a plug nestled snugly within his body. Steve knows his fingers have to be digging bruises into Tony's thighs, but he can't stop staring. The base of the plug has his shield emblazoned on it.
“Oh yeah, every last inch of me.” It's maybe not the least lewd thing he could say, but it's pretty tame all things considered.
He slept four hours, which was more than he had slept since coming out of the ice.  He was still exhausted, but when he looked in the fogged mirror in the bathroom after his too hot shower, the dark circles beneath his eyes were no longer visible.  It was good, it meant maybe Tony wouldn’t worry needlessly about him the next time they saw each other.  Which turned out to be sooner rather than later.
Tony’s head whipped towards the blast doors immediately, and Steve saw him say something to the ceiling.  A moment later the doors to the lab opened, and Tony yelled for him to come in. Upon seeing Tony seemed alright, Steve felt more than a little awkward barging in on him like this. What was he even planning to say to him? Man with a plan indeed, he thought glumly, but still walked into the lab. The music lowered immediately, and Tony waved at him with his plasma torch. Upon Steve approaching more closely, he doused the flame, and pushed his goggles up, looking like nothing more than the world’s most handsome mad inventor.
“Hey, hey, leggo, stoppit! You're a brute, I can't believe-” But Tony is laughing as Steve picks his feet off the ground and swings him around. It's a joyful sound, rare and completely worth the metal fingers prodding at his ribs.
But he holds it close, locks it down, maybe someday Tony will trust him enough to take the armor off, but Steve knows a hard boundary when it's wrapped in gold titanium alloy in front of him.
