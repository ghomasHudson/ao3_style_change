Steve was so aroused by her that he didn't know where to put his hands, and Natasha wouldn't stop there, she took a mouthful of the big guy's thick head and desperately pushed the thing down her throat.
Steve gripped her shoulders so that she was slightly back away from him, making sure that this provided the girl with a perfect viewing angle before thrusting eagerly to her, "Look clearly it's me fucking you, you must never have anyone else in your eyes again."
Steve however confiscated his wallet, "Genius, boss of SI, playgirl, philanthropist, a fan of mine. I'm paying to get you to ask me out for coffee next time."
Unexpectedly, the phone was jerked from his hand and Steve sprang to his feet, reaching out to retrieve it. Fortunately, Toni only seemed to be trying to get the phone out of his hand and had no intention of probing what he was looking at. But it was a little too late to pull back, and Toni, still in her robe, carrying his phone and with her hair still wet, was already pinned to the sofa.
Bruce Banner, Clint Barton and, in front of him, Natasha Romanoff, the last one being Natasha Stark.
At first she had the patience to sidle up to her teammate, "How have you and Steve been?"
The man's blonde hair seemed long and unkempt, and his beard covered most of his face, but his clear blue eyes still struck Natasha as handsome. There was also something inexplicably familiar about him, though she couldn't recall it for a while. He looked like a street painter with a sketchbook in one hand and what appeared to be some drawing equipment in a backpack behind him. If I was still living the playgirl life, I would have slept with him tonight. The thought flashed through Natasha's mind.
Phanie was not defensive and was actually yanked down by him.
"Fine, fine, fine, whatever you want I'll say yes only if you let me sleep a little longer." Steve robbed her quilt and reached out to tickle her, "Get up, you lazy girl, it'll be afternoon if you get any more sleep."
Natasha shook her head as if to say, "How did these two get on each other again?" And Steve just frowned with red ears and didn't make a long speech like he always did, "Toni you should take care of your wounds, meeting dismissed."
Natasha lost all her pyjamas when she moved in, and every day after her bedtime shower, Steve threw her a light shirt that covered just the base of her thighs before pushing her down on the big soft bed and accusing her of seducing him. There were times when he didn't even bother to give her the shirt, but instead leaned back on the bed and watched the girl walk around the bedroom naked, occasionally taking a swipe at her before covering her mouth and fucking her hard.
In the next instant, there was suddenly someone else in the room. He assumed a fighting stance almost immediately before he saw that it was Wong, who he knew to be Dr Strange's assistant, so he removed his defences and spoke up to ask, "What are you doing here from the Sanctuary?"
Steve wrapped his arms tightly around him, "Given that we've seen a million unthinkable things, this isn't the least of them. I've been through this night, and tomorrow's whole day, a thousand times."
She reached up to turn on the light and found her dearest husband lying on the bed, dressed only in a shirt and tie that was more tempting than naked, the hem just covering the big cock that has stood up between his legs, and somehow handcuffing himself to the bed.
Epilogue:
And at that moment, the man stared with his blue eyes at his somewhat dazed little wife at the door and said in a drowning tone, "I hear there's a brainwashed Iron Woman here? I'm here to save the world."
The fun continued into the sunset and on the drive back Steve was still not satisfied as he drove with the girl's head on his crotch and enjoyed another perfect blowjob. In keeping with the principle of not wasting anything, he parked the car in the garage at the Hydra base and pinned the girl in the back of the car and fucked her again, filling her hole to the brim, before finding a blanket to wrap the naked girl in and carrying her upstairs to rest.
But Jarvis showed a disapproving face, "I heard that it was the General who had returned and brought back evidence that Obi had conspired to usurp the throne, and His Majesty is having a fit of rage. Although I understand in my heart how much you think of Miss Phanie, but you may not be able to wait here, so it is better for you to ...... do something important, Your Highness."
Tony hadn't expected this, he was just trying to be cheeky, he hadn't anticipated that Phanie wouldn't use her strength. Tony opened his eyes and her face stopped right in front of him.
Natasha seemed shocked by the thought, and she immediately dismissed it. There was no way in hell she was ready to enter into a normal good and healthy relationship. Not to mention the fact that she was also Iron Woman and should not and could not have brought an ordinary person into her life that was so full of danger. If she really was just an ordinary white-collar worker, she would have pursued him.
One day she was wandering around the building when she happened to come across a female agent in a corner of the penthouse who was stopping Steve, showing off her figure while trying to wrap herself around Steve like a water snake, "Captain, there are a few things I'm not quite sure about regarding tomorrow's combat mission, would you like to come to my bedroom and give me some guidance? "
Steve looked at her, "I'm here in person, I can practice anything you want in person to prove how much I have fallen for you!"
Day 2
He withdrew Natasha's left hand and lifted her ring finger, gently squeezing it as he made a mental note of the size. On her wrist, in the same place where Steve's wrist had his name, there were two more letters, SR, which Natasha had written in pen herself before she went to sleep. He kissed her lightly and then lay back down with Natasha in his arms, ready to sleep with her, listening to the heartbeat of the person in his arms, satisfied beyond belief.
"I thought I saw you earlier, you looked a lot more excited than all the other girls off stage. Miss ...?" Steve reached over and handed Toni back the pen and paper, attaching a perfect smile, thinking to himself that he'd just almost written his real name out.
Natasha's consciousness was now much restored, but her speech system was still only able to produce incoherent moans, "It hurts... It's too deep... .Steve please..." Steve held her left leg down with one hand and her waist with the other, holding the girl firmly in place on the bed so that she could endure his fast thrusting. He enjoyed the retention deep inside the girl's body with each shallow stroke he made, he reached down and pressed a bulgeon her belly, "Look, this is me inside you, it's deep, but it's also very pleasurable isn't it?"
In the afternoon Toni took her new boyfriend - who she mentally reminded herself was a fake - back to Malibu's villa. "Can you swim? It's a waste not to go down to the sea on a nice day like this."
They passed by several hotels during this time, but their enquiries resulted in either no rooms or doubts about the value of the watch.
Both the boss and Steve himself were a little dumbfounded as Toni looked at Steve's immediately flushed face and added, "Don't get me wrong, I'm not here to bag a bimbo or find a one-night stand, a kiss scene maybe?" She sharply removed her sunglasses and raised an eyebrow at Steve, "I won't force the bed scene, but I won't say no if you want to finish it in person." Admiring Steve's more embarrassed expression, she smiled even wider instead.
The man just smiled and waved his hand, "No need to take it back, I don't think His Highness would blame our butler for giving it to anyone. It's just that we've been standing here for a while, and I think it's a disgrace to the moonlight this evening. I only came here because I heard someone practising with a sword, and it so happens that I am also fascinated by the art of swordsmanship, so I wonder if you would like to spar with me?"
"The whole base knows that Agent 7 is pregnant and I'm afraid she hasn't been serving our Captain comfortably for months. She just has an average face and body, and you're only treating her differently because she saved your life once? Besides, she's still having an affair with Agent 15. In fact, we are all wondering who is the father of the baby in her belly. If you're tired of her, Captain, it's in everyone's interest to move on sooner rather than later."
Scott came back from the quantum realm and Tony built the device. Every day since then, in his dreams, he has noticed that his time travel device has a symbol of reactors that no one else has. But he still watched the reactor go out.
S.H.I.E.L.D.
Grant slowly lowered his hands and came to sit next to Natasha, "I'm a person out of time. I used to be a ...... soldier, and I came back from the war to find that I had nothing left. My former girlfriend had left me, my good comrades were gone, and even after the war was over, I was no longer needed on the battlefield. No one needed me. I took a long leave of absence thinking that maybe I could make it a goal to find that person, that I could maybe start a family and stay in the city and be a cop or something. But ......"
"I didn't say that, but I wouldn't object to your suggestion."
Steven seemed to know he would ask this question, the voice he had left behind in advance answered it at exactly that moment, "I saw countless possibilities on Titan, but the only one that completely wiped out Thanos was this one, I couldn't help it even though I couldn't bear it. Perhaps time and future is not to be disturbed, but among the countless possibilities, I have found one that might work. Those hours you spent with the Tesseract seem to have changed the way the Infinity Stones treat you; they don't exclude you from seeing these futures, but you can't tell anyone about them in reality. You can even relive the process over and over again in your dreams until the day it actually arrives. If you can find a way to save him before then, it will become real. The only problem is that I'm not sure the solution really exists."
Natasha remained silent the whole way, just letting Steve lead her back to the bedroom and being held between his arms and the bedroom door, the man took her breath away with one long kiss.
Natasha spoke dry-mouthed and realised that Steve didn't seem to be listening carefully, so she began to think that maybe this was a good opportunity to put him down. "Finished?" Steve finally snapped out of his wandering mind and Natasha nodded.
When he got up the next day and didn't see Phanie, he was a bit anxious, so he called Jarvis and sent people to search for her. When she was nowhere to be found, Jarvis came to tell him that his father had asked him to go to the palace again. "Didn't you see I'm busy, I just met him yesterday, I'm not going!"
"So be it." Natasha shrugged expressionlessly and turned to leave.
"Me? I just want to grow old and still try to make the world a better place with Toni Stark."
The man laughed low twice, "Just to test how much potential you have." The two did a few rounds against this babbling doorway before Steve picked up the girl's clothes, which he had already torn a little, wrapped her roughly in them and carried her out the door.
Steve's breath caught and there was her beloved girl, red in the face, still covered in his fluids. And he guiltily moved forward to wipe her off, but Natasha just glared at him, "Get rid of that 'Nat, no'! Just say isn't that comfortable." The latter half of the sentence was lowered but still caught by Captain America's quadruple hearing.
Bruce soon finishes his anti-brainwashing and tells Natasha, who has been waiting anxiously, that Steve just needs to sleep for a few days and will be fully recovered, and she has finally let go and passed out.
"Don't say that, the baby will hear you." Natasha didn't think the day would come when she would be the one to remind Steve of language.
Natasha beamed, not quite achieving her goal, but at least much better than expected, still her mouth refused to let up, "Am I to blame? You're the one who put my head on the wall..."
It was the first time Toni had seen Steve lose his temper, and he was so angry at how much malice was directed at Toni that he held the girl tightly in his arms and told her not to read the entertainment news online. "
"Your armours, beautiful," Steve lowered his voice teasingly, "and you, even more beautiful."
Toni clutched his hand tightly and picked up his words, "I love you, Steve."
The Steve in the video still looked much the same as the last time the team gathered in the lobby at the moment, the only difference being that the clothes he was wearing had changed from the combat suit Natasha had made for him to a Hydra uniform and his ever blue, deep eyes had turned a bloodthirsty red.
He looked into Tony's big brown eyes, "I miss you Tony, I want to move in here and I want to ask you to be with me again."
Steve woke up with Toni in his arms, "How about I take you to the amusement park today?"
Then the cookies all fell to the floor and startled the two men who were nibbling away in the corner of the kitchen with little fabric left on them.
Toni snapped back from her delirious wanderings waiting for the two to discuss, "Oh, there's no script, you play it out, I only have one request. Just pretend you love me. For a week, never be out of character, pretend you love me with all your heart."
Although ...... the man still hadn't returned to those close times with him, it had been a year since the Infinity War and the world was slowly recovering from its great grief, and he saw no reason why they should be prevented from spending the rest of their long lives together. The moustached man just needed some more time, and patience was the last thing he needed.
Steve waited backstage for Toni to arrive to kick off their week-long deal, and Jarvis set up their first encounter as a barroom singer and fan. He was convinced that  a deliberately understated Toni Stark herself was in the young girls crazy for him off the stage as he played the guitar and sang love songs under the name Steve Evans
"Looks like I was right?" The girl's pained voice instead made the man even more brutal as he heaved in and out quickly, feeling the frantic sucking deep inside her finally soothed pussy, "Does he know you'll suck me like that in bed? Does he know that you open your legs to be fucked by me like this every day? I wish I could record you right now and show him."
He erotically kissed the girl's cheek until it was wet, but his hand didn't stop moving, two fingers poking deeper and deeper into her little hole, and occasionally flexing his fingers to press on her sensitive spot. "Listen to you, wet as a creek, want me?" Natasha squirmed impatiently, unable to think whether she should hide further away or swallow him deeper, Steve using just enough force to keep her from breaking free, but leaving room for her to struggle for his enjoyment. The bedroom were filled with the sound of sticky water as the man held back long enough to finally reach in for a fourth finger, "Want it, Steve, come in..."
"Maybe I lied to you at first, or maybe I'm lying to you now." Natasha sat up, smirking as she watched Grant in front of her take two steps back and raise his hands to her.
"Tony," Steve's voice started to tremble, "I know what you did to MK85, you can't say you love me and do this to me at the same time."
"Mr Evans, could you give me an autograph?"
Satisfied that his only beloved little girl was looking up at him with a look of expectant relief, Steve grabbed Natasha's chin and kissed her tenderly on the lips for a moment, "No more being mad at me, my little genius Toni is so smart, your work is guaranteed to be too busy for her to hook up with me and give you a hard time ever again. I know my little girl is tired, we'll rest soon, be good." The man kissed her forehead and slowed his pace beneath him, releasing himself completely inside her.
"I missed you too Tony, when I was coaching Peter, Wanda and Vision, when I saw Bucky and Natasha showing off their time together, when I was dining with Clint, and when I was having meetings with Fury, Coulson and Hill. "
Many mornings the first thing she sees is Steve's dick in and out of her mouth, and Steve seems keen to wake her up this way, with her favourite AC/DC on his phone and his hand on the back of her head, making her take him deeper in her sleep. This is when she misses the old Captain America who used to let her sleep a little longer even when he came back from her morning jogs, when Steve was usually leaning over her and portraying her sleeping eyes with a paintbrush.
Steve came back with the building's medicine stuff and spoke with deliberation as he medicated Toni, "You can't put all the blame in the world on yourself, be kind to yourself so you have the energy to do more for everyone, isn't it?"
At Natasha's suggestion, instead of using his own sketchbook, Grant took down the wall art used to decorate the room and drew on the blank back of a replica of the famous painting. "It's called hotel graffiti. To be fair, let's not either of us take the painting with us." She figured that the first thing she would do when she got back to New York tomorrow would be to get Pepper to buy the hotel as fast as she could, and then she could keep the painting.
Natasha's tearful helplessness only aroused the man's desire, and he reached up and grabbed the long soft hair at the back of the girl's head, forcing her head up to give him an easier angle to penetrate from top to bottom, and pressing her eagerly against his lower body. With each thrust to the throat, Steve let out a gasp of satisfaction. "Fuck, you're a good sucker... ahhh... Like you expect this to live, FUCK, tell me how many men have fucked this to practice it eh?" The girl shook her head desperately as if to say it was only him, which finally gave him the satisfaction of releasing it, the spurt of cum not only sliding part of the way straight down her throat, but some down the corner of her mouth, and more shooting into the girl's hair on her face and chest.
Tony didn't find Phanie when he returned to the house.
Natasha struggled to get up but was still in Steve's grip and her eyes widened as she questioned, "What are you doing?" "Don't move, baby, let me try if you taste good." The man still leaned down over her breasts in their linked position to suck on the milk that hung from her body, while his thrusts did not lessen.
Toni broke free from his arms and hemmed and hawed, "Want to do it?"
Yes, that shield.
Phanie panicked a little, calculating in her mind the several reasons why the Prince wanted to see her: was it because she was suspicious with nowhere to come from? Or had she been discovered before she could return that shield? The worst that could happen was that she would be thrown out, it was not a big big deal except that she had only just found a reason to want to stay here ......
Tony was impatient to hear that, his father was clearly asking the General for a reward, but how could the General be saying he was guilty. When was he going to be released to go back to his Phanie anyway?
Yes. "I love you Toni, but..."
And so Phanie moved from the back yard, where she did the menial work, to the inner courtyard of the Prince's house. The little maids she used to live with could not help but secretly speculate that this girl would be lucky to be with Prince for one night. But Phanie had no idea how complicated it was to listen to these words, she just stood guard for the Prince as always.
Tony laughed again, "It doesn't matter if you don't remember what you used to be, you just have to remember that from now on you are the Prince's love, and if you do remember that you used to be a killer, then ......" Tony deliberately paused, "then what? " Fanny blurted out, and chided herself in turn for having these hidden expectations. "Then you'll retire from now on and only be my killer."
"I love you Toni Stark!" Steve's voice echoed across the valley.
"Ummm you may have forgotten, but the last time you couldn't sleep and said on the phone that Howard had never taken you to a place like that, I thought you'd want to make up for that? As well as that, this isn't a children's playground, look over there, over there, aren't all the little couples dating?"
"Toni wake up, almost noon."
Natasha was still shocked that Steve had remembered all of it so quickly, and for a moment her mind went blank as she didn't know what to say, while the man was already touching all over her delicately.
As long as the two are in the same room, there is always a place where the girl is occupied by Steve. The man still loved to use her mouth and her breast, but nowadays he rarely cum out on those places. He always thrusts hard until he feels he's almost done, then pours his cum into the pussy without wasting a drop.
"Yes, when we were in love, but as fate would have it, we missed each other."
He also began to learn to keep up with this new age, like how to use a mobile phone and how to use a credit card. He also began to read novels and films so that he wouldn't be unable to pick up the conversation.
Steve caressed her face heartily, "There will always be new good days, from now on I'll be your light, whether you're happy or unhappy, always remember I'm waiting for you to come home."
Then it was Natasha who came to him.
He stared intently at Natasha with blue eyes, "Not just now, but right away."
Toni didn't dwell on him, but changed the subject to something else he couldn't quite resist as well, "Want to do it?"
Day 3
"Tony," Fanny spoke tentatively, continuing after receiving an encouraging look, "and what did you call me here for today?"
Toni knew she couldn't really go on the roller coaster, but she wanted to see Steve's response, "No, I just want to go, I want to feel like flying."
Although she couldn't see the expression under the mask, Natasha thought it might be heartbreak, but the next moment the iron man was on his feet and said "I don't believe it!" And he crashed through the window of the building and flew away without looking back.
She had never known that Steve's soft voice could sound cruel. "Any more nonsense and my shield will not spare you." The man's voice was cold, and when he finished he pushed the girl away from him and strode away.
"I was just wondering what I really mean to you."
When they reached the top floor, just after stepping out of the lift without even turning on the lights, Toni pushed Steve against the wall. She stared into those blue eyes and slowly moved closer, and after getting no refusal, wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him with all her strength until she led him all the way down to the big bed in the bedroom.
Natasha didn't know how long she was muddled and ravaged until she had lost consciousness in her knees and her voice was a little hoarse from shouting. Steve was distressed to hear this, but told himself that he could not forgive her so easily, so he picked up her panties, which had been thrown on the floor, and stuffed them into her mouth. The girl's resistance was more like amusement to him, her grasped hands, her teary-eyed expression, the whimpers that she tried to beg for mercy but could only make, all stirred his desire to torture her more like.
Steve patted her on the shoulder, "Work hard and I'll take you out tomorrow. Maybe I can tour the Stark Industries while you work?"
Tony closed his eyes and asked Jarvis to keep looking carefully before he hurried into the palace.
Steve exhaled quietly in the girl's ear, "Why didn't you make a sound?" Before raising his voice and saying back, "I'm having an in-depth conversation with Agent 7 about the recent work schedule and I think you should listen to it."
"What are you doing, I'm not playing this game with you!"
It seemed like he'd done this already some time ago.
The girl looked interested in this, "Oh what did you draw?"
"If it was you, you wouldn't be so sad, you'd just say 'It's Captain America's responsibility!' Then darling, you know that if this is my destiny, then this is Iron Man's responsibility."
Five seconds passed and she still hadn't remembered what she was going to say, but she burst out laughing. A "Cut!" came from the distance and Steve held her arm with smiling eyes, "Was I really that funny when I confessed my love ......?"
"Yeah that's it, I'm really sleepy but I want to talk to you for a bit longer, I haven't seen you in a whole day, no, it feels like a whole century."
Out of the thirty actors, Toni spotted Steve at once. she held out her hand, "Stark Industries has a film deal, I wonder if this ......"
Toni first met Steve on the set of their first film together.
Phanie didn't know how her face could get any redder, she just repeated it twice, "Tony you really should go see the majesty." Tony dropped another kiss on her cheek and got up, "I hope I hear you say yes when I get back."
"Well," Steve said, half-truthfully, knowing he couldn't hide it from Tony, "because I have to sleep in the guest room without my Omega's comfort."
It was late afternoon when Natasha woke up again. Clint, Thor and Natasha - the redheaded female agent - had returned from the battle and Pepper was at her bedside. They hadn't seen her in months, and everyone was worried about her condition. "It's just low blood sugar, nothing serious, but your injury ...... cap's shield if I'm not mistaken," Bruce said as he changed her medicine and added when he saw her nod, "Anyway, if you want the baby to be well, just stay in bed for a few days." The crowd was surprised and concerned to hear Bruce announce that there had been a baby in Natasha's belly for over three months.
When he was finished he didn't show it to Natasha, but hung it back on the wall, "I just don't think it gives you the right look." Natasha didn't reach for it, thinking that it would be mine tomorrow anyway.
The electronic voice under the mask always made the tone inaudible, "Yeah, in fact, if you weren't here I'd be on my way to a candlelit dinner with Steve right now."
He held that pose of surrender, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come and take advantage. Though I do wish you were telling the truth, I even wondered earlier if I could just be capricious for once if the names did match up. No ...... I just can't, that's not right."
"Nat, stop it." Steve put on that Captain America look of disapproval and grabbed Natasha's hand, which was by now poking into his trousers, and guarded her stomach again for fear she'd bump it.
Steve's breath caught when he looked up to find Toni, who had finally changed, standing in front of him. The girl laughed out loud at his dumbfounded look, "What, why are you looking stupid? Amazed by my body? Don't just stand there, go wash your hands and put sunscreen on me."
"With you, of course."
Pepper was holding an umbrella for her beside her and pointed casually, "Here, that's your partner for the next six months."
Day 0
Toni instead let go and waved her hands in the wind, "You know I'm either in one of those fancy cars or flying around in my armour every day, cars are boring, armour is more exciting than cars but I'm flying around every day to fight, I've never sat in the back seat waiting for someone to take me home."
The girl smiled brightly, "Just call me Toni, I'm just a little fan who's liked you for years."
"Nat, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... anyway. I don't know what I can do to make it up to you, and maybe nothing I can do will make me accept those days and go on enjoying your kindness to me as if they didn't exist. I'm afraid that one day I won't be able to control myself and I'll hurt you, so maybe I should..." The sentence that followed seemed to weigh a thousand pounds, and he didn't finish it in the end.
The man didn't seem to know what to say to make her hurt feelings better, so he took the microphone and pretended to press a few more buttons, "Hi Grant, this is ...... tomorrow." He skimmed his lips as Natasha covered the microphone, "He believed it, I knew I would be convinced of something like time travel. Anyway, your biggest task today is to spend all the money in your wallet and break your card. It's important. bye."
No wonder Toni said their pictures were all stupid, Steve commented that he looked like a puppy. He then quickly scanned through the rest of the texts, except for Fury's emotional outbursts like "What the hell is going on with you and that Stark?" "Don't you want your secret identity anymore?" "Did you know that this photo has been the number one trending topic on Twitter?" Nothing more important than that.
"Baby open your mouth and don't make me say it twice." Clenching her teeth Natasha just looked heartbroken at the man in front of her as he reached out in slight anger and pinched the girl's small mouth open, giving her no chance to adjust before pushing it up to the opening of her throat in one swift movement. The girl's subconscious gagging response gave Steve even more pleasure, and his dick thickened again, making his head tingle with pleasure as he wanted to shove both balls into the girl's warm mouth.
Tony's heart beat faster all of a sudden, he grabbed the person's wrist tightly, forcing her to turn her head to face him, "Steve ...... Phanie ...... Stephanie, it's you!"
"Hope we'll take a nice holiday soon."
After a crazy night of fighting, Tony, who had only wanted to kiss and cuddle with his boyfriend before going back to his room, accidentally fell asleep and woke up at dawn. With his scrapped armour still lying in the workroom, he had to sneak back to his room in the morning light with his shirt, not expecting to run into Bruce, who had risen early to meditate.
Steve held the handles of her chair with both hands and slowly knelt down to look her in the eyes, "Be my girlfriend, Toni, will you?"
Her thoughts turned once again to the goodness of the man in front of her, her mind wandering before she finally gave up thinking. She tugged on the man's collar and kissed him, letting him fall on top of her. She left it up to him to decide what would happen next, or to fate.
"I'd like to, Pepper's got a frighteningly full schedule for me today, she's asked especially not to slow down on the collaboration with that king of Wakanda, and I haven't even had time to confirm the results of yesterday's experiments with Bruce."
There seemed to be a thousand words in the eyes of the person in front of him, but it was Tony who opened his mouth first, "For General's reward, please allow me to suggest, my father, just give the position of my wife to General Stephanie."
What Toni admires most about Steve is that he is always gentle and kind to everyone in the industry. He did not expect that he would suddenly be given the opportunity to work with Toni Stark and even become a close friend of hers after years of being unpopular. He had also heard that Toni had been through a lot of pain, so he paid more attention to Toni than to anyone else without realising it. But he didn't realise at first if there was anything special about it.
Steve contacted Danvers in advance so that she could return to Earth as quickly as possible. Every day since then, Danvers has appeared in advance on the battlefield in his dreams. But he still watched the reactor go out.
This left Natasha's dreams unsettled. Sometimes the dreams were also on her knees with Captain Hydra ramming into her body behind her and Captain America's big guy thrusting in her mouth in front of her. She reached up to touch those blue eyes and woke up all of a sudden with only the morning exercise of Captain Hydra, only those red eyes staring mischievously at her with the dick in her mouth below and her tongue being played with by his fingers above.
The girl finally couldn't stand being treated so roughly and her voice took on a choke, "Steve, you can't do this to me." She took two steps forward on her knees, trying to pull away from his topping so she could turn and look into his eyes, trying to summon some sense from him.
"In my opinion, why don't we just take out Hydra's lair, subdue the Red Skull and then take our time to work out a way to save my friend?" Thor said, picking up his hammer and seemingly heading out the door immediately.
He licked the girl's ear for a moment, then straightened up and, without warning, pulled out the big dick that had been stirring wildly the moment before, and there was a crunching sound where they had connected, and the small opening hole was still shrinking and leaking white fluid before it could close. The man looked at the girl's flushed face and took two steps forward, shooting all the desire he had not released into her body earlier onto her delicate face.
It was almost Christmas time, the weather was already cold and almost every shop on the far side of the street had a Christmas tree, a festive atmosphere that delighted everyone but Natasha. She didn't love Christmas, perhaps because she had lost something on Christmas Eve one year, and Natasha tightened her coat and pondered the feasibility of catching a taxi by showing her identity now.
After knocking on the door, Fanny pushed her way in, "Tony, do you remember going to see the Majesty today?"
By the time he was able to come in and out smoothly with four fingers, Natasha was so desperate that she was saying something she couldn't think about, "Get in here, come straight away!" Seeing that Steve was still looking at her like a fragile object, the girl deliberately provoked him, "Are you able to do this, Uncle Steve?"
"How old are you?" Phil pulled out the small notebook he perpetually carried and began to scribble.
"Luna is bigger than me, and got big curly hair" AJ threw his hands up and wind-milled them slowly outwards, "she is like me but with loads and loads of freckles. Mamma hasn’t been home in too long but Gramma says she loves us and that she just needs to get better. She takes special medicine that Luna says is bad but Medicine makes you better so I think Luna is wrong. Luna is special too, I hope I get special when I get bigger, but Gramma said I might be like Daddy and not special." Clint pouted a little at the description and ignored the snickers from around the table as AJ continued to talk. "We was on a bus for so  long coz we had to come find Daddy. Luna says he's a 'venger but I never seen him so I dunno but" AJ paused his eyes narrowing on Phil's face, "Are you a 'venger?" he asked.
"Agent Barton, the doors are open" Jarvis sassed when Clint continued to stand and watch his friends trying to be conspicuous.
"So you just left?" Nat asked, her voice had gone suspiciously even.
The writing was messy but legible. The content was the biggest surprise. Clint looked up at the boy as he lost the feeling in his legs, tumbling to land on his ass on the hardwood floor. AJ giggled as if Clint meant to do it and Clint couldn't help the smile that erupted onto his face. Children? Multiple! Looking up Clint could definitely see the resemblance, if not to himself then Barney. Chubby cheeks with a slight pinkness to them, pale skin unblemished by anything that could have happened to him at this age. The happy smile on his face begun to slowly fade into concern, as if Clint might have actually hurt himself when he landed with a thud.
Leading the boy down the steps and out into the street Clint realised he could have left the kid to play his game a little longer, luckily it wasn't a cold day and the stoop was clear. Clint took a seat on the cold stone, amused when the boy mirrored him, sitting with his legs open, elbows braced on his knees and hands together.
Bucky's blue eyes were downcast, glassy with unshed tears as he shook his head. "Stevie, he's not—he didn't—" He paused, pursing his lips in anger and disappointment as he looked directly at Steve. "You were supposed to catch him, but… you didn't. Why didn't you catch him? Now he's dead!"
been on Steve’s to-do list for that day, an issue that he was forced to rectify only seconds before he walked through the door.  Trying to keep himself from breaking down right in front of Peter had been less easy, but he’d still managed to do it.
"Thanks."
from behind the truck caused Peter to jump, and he scrambled to open the door, practically diving into the backseat. He was tired enough now that even with his glasses and earplugs, his senses were quickly approaching overload.
"Oh, sure," Peter said as he sucked in a shaky breath. "That—that's a great idea."
"Oh," Peter said.
"No! Don't give me the same stupid excuses that you always do just 'cause you guys are scared! I'm not a child—!"
"No, I know that," said Peter. "What I was gonna say is… I'd like to do it too. The experiment. I wanna do it."
“I want to keep going, Tony,” Papa said in his Captain’s voice.  “I need to do this.”
"Oh, yeah, sure," Peter said as he stepped back, allowing Mr Toomes to walk past him. He chanced a sneaky glance down at the files as he passed, but other than the top page appearing to be some kind of order manifest, the hallway was too dim for him to catch anything else.
"Uh huh," Peter said, even as he feared it might be pointless as Thanos placed the Time Stone into its spot on the gauntlet. Crackles of blinding white lightning engulfed him as soon as it locked into place, spreading across his massive chest and down his arms as he let out a triumphant roar.
Tony breathed in as he burrowed closer. "Actually, Sam just called, and apparently they stumbled upon some sort of carnival or something that Pete wanted to check out. I told him it was okay as long as they didn't let Pete out of their sight, and I know Sam's got Redwing and Nat's got her Bites on her, so…"
And thankfully, nothing bad happened.
"And that's not right," Peter said. "Especially not since the entire country was thrown into crisis. But none of that was my grandpa's fault either. Or my dad's, or mine. But we were all still blamed for it." He didn't add that in addition to Papa's papa, there were also hundreds of other people who were killed on that day. No sense in peeling the scab off a barely-healed wound.
"Copy that. We've got it."
"Yeah, okay," Peter said. "Um… so, how're we gonna get back to Earth?"
did it feel amazing. Steve was not only inside him he was all around him, their bodies and souls joined together so perfectly that tears sprang to Tony's eyes.
With a final shudder, Steve pressed a wet kiss to the cap of Tony's shoulder as he carefully pulled out of him, twisting him around to lay down on the bed. "Now it's your turn," he said as he immediately took Tony's cock into his mouth. Tony gasped, his back arching off the bed at the sudden sensation of Steve's warm, wet mouth.
Apparently, Obie had now decided that it was Tony who was responsible for the fact that when Regina Williams, Peter’s mother, started working for Stark Industries, she had been sent there as a spy.  By none other than Justin Hammer.  The most assholery asshole who’d ever assholed.
Steve gave a nod, ignoring the fact that JARVIS couldn't see him. "Yes, please tell him that I will. As soon as I can."
"What'd he do now?"
"Hey, hon. Take a look at that," Tony whispered as he jerked his head towards Peter, who was sitting in the centre of a gaggle of Air Corps pilots and telling them an absolutely captivating story, if the identical looks of awe on each of their faces were any indication. "Seems like Pete's got himself a fan club."
But other times, like this night, Steve just wanted—no,
Tony’s belly dropped to his knees.  “Ah,
Steve let out a sigh, rubbing at the back of his neck as the names just kept on coming, scrolling across the screen with inputiny. So far JARVIS had identified over three hundred Stark Industries and SHIELD employees that had been snapped, and while Steve had so far managed to keep up with sending condolence letters to their surviving family members, he could no longer deny that the strain was starting to wear on him. He had practically no appetite, only eating when he felt too weak to continue working, and had been keeping himself awake with way,
"Sure, little guy," Steve said with a short laugh. "I'm gonna go get cleaned up now, okay? Be ready to go when I get back."
That didn't mean he wasn’t nervous.  He was about to come face-to-face with one of the main propagators of his post-traumatic stress, as Sam called it.  And to do so so soon after finally admitting that he was suffering from such a thing was not exactly ideal.
looks. "Ah, yeah. I'm pretty much always hungry."
Steve broke off as the pink flames of embarrassment crept up his neck to his cheeks, along with a hefty dose of pride.
"I still want to go to school tomorrow, though," Peter said once he was able to pull himself together. "I don't want the bad guys thinking that they've won. I don't—I don't want to give them the satisfaction."
"No, Сэм, I'm pretty sure they
in Steve’s case.
Which meant that Hammer's suits would most likely target the non-flyers first, which meant that he needed to somehow draw the flyers away from them, which meant that—
“All right, since it seems like the cat’s got Mr Stane’s tongue at the moment, I guess we’ll continue,” Tony said.  He attempted to swallow as he moved over to stand next to Sam, a monumental feat since his mouth felt like it had been stuffed with cotton.
"As you wish, sir."
Regardless, standing there surrounded by nothing but dull grey metal and the occasional flashing light, Peter was absolutely freezing. He'd turned on the heater in his suit—actually, the heaters in both of his suits—but still had to keep his jaw practically locked so his teeth didn't chatter as he and Dad fiddled with the ships controls, trying to figure out how to drop the dumb thing out of warp.
We will meet Tony and Peter next week in chapter 2 😊
"That's just fine, Peter," said Steve. Then he moved back to the doorway to allow Tony and Sharon to hook up the various monitors and check Peter's vital signs.
Steve was quiet for a moment, his fingers tracing idle circles on Tony's back. "You know, way back on the night before I got the serum, Dr Erskine visited me in the barracks with a bottle of peach schnapps that he'd brought from home, asking if I was nervous. When I told him that I was, he poured us both a shot of the schnapps, but then took mine away before I could drink any of it because he said that I couldn't have any fluids before the procedure."
With a huff, Peter took off jogging towards the opposite end of the bunker, hoping to run into Wanda or Mr Stacy or someone else who might know where Papa was being kept. He was beyond ready to get out of there and go home.
“Huh?” Tony says, feigning surprise.  “I am certain that I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
as each of the water droplets made contact with his skin.
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered, his own eyes so filled with tears he could barely see. He carefully cupped Steve's cheek, his heart giving a painful lurch when Steve leaned his head against it. "It's okay, I can make you a new one, yeah? I'll make you a thousand new rings if it means that you'll be back home with me. With
“Oh, good.  Make sure you keep the lock passwords changed every six hours, you got that?” said Tony.  “‘Cause I’ll be damned if I’m gonna let someone else die over a bunch of OTC pain relievers.”
"Yeah, we are."
"I will."
Steve's belly gave a nervous swoop. "Yes. As long as you're careful."
"Eh, it's just comfy," Peter said with a nonchalant shrug, as if it was a perfectly normal occurrence for a teenage boy to be doing his homework while sticking to the wall nearly five metres up from the floor. "It's not like I'm gonna fall."
"Dad?" Peter said as he sat down at the counter, eyeing Tony with concern. "You okay?"
"Okay, but where's—?" Steve started, cut off when the sky suddenly lit up in a brilliant burst of lightning, followed directly by the appearance of a massive axe that raced across the plain at waist-height, taking out every single war dog in its path.
“There's not,” Steve cut in.  “I just need you.  You and Peter.  That’s all.”
"Pete? You be careful!" Tony yelped as Peter launched a web towards one of the flying chariot things, yanking him clean off his back only a few seconds after the two armies, who had been rumbling towards each other like some kind of medieval video game, finally crashed together.
“All right,” Tony said.  “Let’s start with the SHIELD employees suspected to be HYDRA moles.”
"Okay, but assigned to do what?" barked Tony. His temper, stoked by his confusion and barely-controlled panic was quickly reaching its boiling point, tempered only by the fact that for some reason, Peter didn't seem all that surprised.
Steve made his way back to the building as fast as he could, still not as fast as Toni's armour, of course. When he got back to the top floor, Toni was sitting by the window. "Where have you been?"
Natasha seemed to freeze the moment Steve leaned in for a kiss. "Why are your eyes open? Scared?" When he finished, Steve seemed a little stunned, as if he had heard that phrase somewhere. Natasha was also a little dazed, and that was exactly what she had said to him with when she had first kissed him.
Steve was a little surprised that Toni trusted him so much. It was like being in a sci-fi movie, so he sat down in the workshop, took out the pen and paper he had with him and began to draw. The armour and workroom furnishings were easy, but he didn't know where to start when he wanted to draw Toni at work here. Rubbing his forehead, he realised that it was time to go and meet Toni for dinner.
Natasha lay on her back sucking in air like a fish out of water, while Steve's hands, now working under her, lit fires everywhere, Steve carefully observing her reactions as he explored her with one finger by one finger, like he was studying a S.H.I.E.L.D. file.
"Really fell asleep. Captain America actually made up the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, just wanted to hear you say it. Good night, the answer to my life, my universe and my everything."
Steve felt that people were hiding something from him.
Toni turned back to continue staring at the shield, "But I don't have anything I want to hear, go to SI and find Pepper if you want the check."
"Mummy and Daddy, I'm having a nightmare." Peter clutched his little pillow and knocked the door outside their bedroom in aggravation.
Peter's mind was overflowing with questions, but he swallowed them all for fear of saying something wrong. He fetched his new outfit and fled as fast as he could. One was Iron Man's boss and the other was Iron Man's comrade, not to mention the fact that these were the two men he admired most, Captain America and respected most, Mr. Stark, and they shouldn't be cheating on Mr. Iron Man behind his back, right?
"I've seen interviews with you and Steve from before, and it's how coincident that you've come so close to meeting early so many times before you met, and at the speed you've been together in a month and engaged in six months, doesn't it feel like a lot of time has been wasted when you think of all those years past?"
She stared at the ceiling for a moment, recalling on the past month, when her good teammates had prepared her with changes to her look, a hidden communication device, and arranged for a plan for her to save the hero Captain Hydra's life, and so far she, Toni Potts, a brilliant agent who had saved Captain Hydra in battle, had been recuperating here for over ten days.
The man reached down and smeared the fluid away from the girl's face, lifted her chin and scraped some more from her chest into her mouth forcing her to swallow. "Baby, ah Toni, you don't know how beautiful you are now, you're mine and I'm the only one who can see you like this." Natasha managed to calm down to catch her breath, she reached out a hand over her eyes, tears running down her arm as she said in a muffled voice, "There's no one else, you're all I have Steve, you can't do this to me, you'll regret it." The man who had let go of the first half of the sentence was stung again by the second half, "Regret? No, I don't get it, I won't regret it," he said, gesturing down in the direction of his lower body again, "It's best if there aren't any other men, baby, it doesn't matter if there are, sooner or later I'll fuck them out of your head, every hole in your body is mine to fuck as much as I want, every part of you I'm the only man for you. If you don't serve me well today, I'm going to lock you in the house without clothes and make you open your legs for me at all times. Now, lick me clean."
"Good, ok," Steve reached out to wipe away her tears for her too, then swept her into his arms, "then we'll go and get married tomorrow, okay? If I still have the honour, give me a chance to look after you and our child forever."
Captain America disappeared the day after proposing to Iron Woman.
Steve turned around to see Toni, standing by the door smiling sweetly. The moment had finally come. What is the role of a romance movie supposed to say at this point? Toni didn't rush him at all, just stared at his hand as if she really wanted his autograph.
Day 6
Grant didn't object, just took down the other hanging and turned it over in front of Natasha, "Then you can paint me too."
"I thought obscure little singers like me didn't have fans, so my only fan, care to join me for a bite to eat?" Steve mentally breathed a long sigh of relief, okay I caught that line.
Steve had a hard look at Ironman once again who lowered face armor and began the final struggle, "Actually we are in an open relationship ......Thor, you may not know, but this kind of relationship in the Midgard is...... "
Tony made Mark 85, and Steve knew that there was something secret on it that no one else knew. In his dream he once again watched the reactor go out, and it hurt like hell.
"There is now." Steve slowed slightly to try and grab the girl's hand to get her to wrap around him, but Toni was fighting him and generally refused to settle down.
Steve grabbed the doughnuts for Tony and the toys for Morgan from the table and prepared to leave for home. Home. His heart softened at the thought, his home with Tony and their newborn baby girl, and even though Tony still avoided his warmth intentionally or unintentionally, his Omega was beginning to let him back into his life.
Steve seemed to be in a good mood and kissed her before giving the girl a resounding kiss on the cheek, "What did you hear?"
That's right. They were both heroes and needed no more words, and Steve understood perfectly about Tony's heart, and as he said, if the fated one had been him, he would have gone to his death without hesitation. But it was Tony, the one person he would rather take on himself than lose.
She looked a little surprised, but immediately dropped what she was holding and then tugged at the collar of the man on top of her, "You're very enthusiastic today, big guy, and I was just going to ask that, want to do it?"
Nor did she expect Steve to be enraged at once. He lunged at her and pinned her hands to the sides of her head, ignoring Natasha's pain as he touched her injuries, and simply said, "Who are you looking at through me? Who are you thinking about? I don't need that thing. Can't I afford to have a baby?"
"Toni good night."
The world around the two of them suddenly fell silent except for the roar of the engine, the words dissipating into the wind, Toni only thought Steve wouldn't hear it but failed to see his reddened ears because she was crouched on top of him. Let me indulge, it's the only week I have left to indulge myself anyway.
"Tony, get up! If you don't get up I'm going to lift your quilt!"
"That's because I sleep with my battery called Tony in my arms at night."
"Nat!" Instead of the "Captain America embarrassed but happy" look she used to love, Steve seemed yo be in a panic, as if he had done something wrong, and with a lot of worries in his voice. "I just wanted to see how you were doing with your injuries, I... I won't do anything to you."
The man said these harsh words, but his tone was soft as if he was whispering love, "Resign yourself to the fact that Toni, from the moment I saw you, you were mine." With that he repositioned the girl in a kneeling position in front of the one-sided glass window and pushed himself hard into her in response to the bustle of people outside.
"Oh, yes yes I did," Tony rubbed his messy hair in chagrin, "actually just now ......"
"But I do, breakfast has turned into lunch, it can't turn into dinner again."
Her fiancé is still as good a soilder as he was before the brainwashing, and every day he fucks her over and over with her belly bulging. Steve in particular loving to threaten the girl to obey him while expecting a new life to be born. At night, the man is keen to keep his cock deep inside the girl overnight, not only to ensure that the fluids are fully utilised, but also so that he can wake her up the next day with a morning loving session and a new day of hard work.
Satisfied, Steve deliberately rocked the bed to a creaking halt, and the slowest person on the other end of the line could realize what the people on this side of the phone were doing. "If you haven't ...... discussed it well yet, then I'll leave you two alone for now."
The sheets were already wet, and she was covered in both the milk Steve had poured and the various bodily fluids they had exchanged, and Natasha felt uncomfortably sticky, and thinking that Steve would have had enough by now, given the intensity of the previous sex activities at the building, she asked for a shower.
The first time Toni Stark almost met Steve Rogers, was in the hospital.
Fury: I shouldn't have to worry about my team breaking up on the spot, right?
Natasha finally questioned without fear, turning her head to glare at the man moving behind her with seeming ferocity, "What were you doing?" Hearing that her voice was not at all intimidating, she added softly, "Is that good enough for you? Give me a break when you've had enough."
Steve, as if unaware that he was blushing, coughed twice to hide his embarrassment, "Unsanitary."
Natasha looked into those shy blue eyes, gave a somewhat winning smile and leaned down, licking the long erect dick slowly, sucking the twin balls and then inching along the shaft to the top, occasionally stimulating him as if she were trying to burrow her deft little tongue into the tiny hole at the tip.
"I'm not messing around," the girl had tugged down his trousers as she spoke, "Bruce said it's fine at this point as long as you do it gently, oh ... although he's stressed over and over that he's not that kind of doctor."
The last thing he remembers is being shot on the battlefield the day after he proposed to the girl he loved. By the time he woke up from his nap, it was surprisingly months had passed. His good teammates tell him that he just lost those months of memory when he was hit by an alien ray while on a mission.
Steve shook and nodded his head and Tony felt a little wetness on his pyjamas. "So ...... it's you or me, it's not Morgan is it?"
"I'm sorry, are you saying I'm taking up space and getting in the way of people lining up to give you a hand?" The man retorted before frowning again, seemingly chagrined that he would react in such an uncouth manner.
"Yes, I guess. But I don't think Sam will have time to join me, he's busy training with Rhodey too."
He grabbed the girl's hand to stop her panic, "I'm fine," he looked up confused at his fiancée who had suffered so much and still refused to tell him anything, hesitating for a moment before letting go of her hand again and his voice seemed hoarse, "I've remembered everything."
"Because I've got a surprise for you." The man casually pulled a tie from the coat rack by the door and blindfolded the girl, and Natasha was surprised that he was getting better at it, but didn't notice that his voice was a little different than it had been on previous days.
Yet Natasha hadn't seen Steve around the battlefield. The teammates have also reported that they haven't seen Steve anywhere.
Steve laughed and pulled a bottle of water out of his bag and handed it to her, "Why would I want to make a whale cry?"
The dinner was charming, and although there were only two of us, Steve cooked several dishes and set out candles and played music. Toni asked what he had been doing this afternoon.
Natasha wandered aimlessly through the late-night streets, and by the time she looked back again, she noticed that there were no street lights on the road, only a few youths who had drunk too much to vent their anger on a bin. She clenched her fists and mentally calculated the chances of leaving her armour and relying only on her recently trained fighting skills to swing these men without scratching her face if they launched themselves at her in a frenzy.
Countless fragmented memories flooded into his mind, Natasha's voice quickly moving away, seemingly separated from him by the sea of ice that had kept him dusty for seventy years, and he could only vaguely hear Natasha calling his name, asking him anxiously what was wrong. Consciousness returned quickly and he was sitting on the floor at some point, his back against the side of the bed, his hands still cradling his head. And his beloved girl stroked the messy hair at the back of his head soothingly, "Just hold on, I'm going to get Bruce," she said, oblivious to the ambiguous liquid still running down between her legs for a moment, just haphazardly picking up the dress on the floor to pull it over herself.
Steve laughed at her near-choking mouthful and shook his head, "I've been out for my morning run, shopping for ingredients, making breakfast and thinking about what I'm going to say to you later when I am enjoying the views in front of the window."
Natasha didn't expect him to be so eager, and as she held his hands down on her legs, she suddenly heard the same murmur as before, "Toni... Toni..." She looked into the man's red eyes and thought that if it had been him before, he would have been a gentleman first. "What's the matter? Don't want it?" The man pinched her chin and smiled playfully before caressing her face again, "Since I've fallen in love with you, I'll never have another woman. You look at me like that and it makes me want to fuck you right now."
"If the puny god doesn't make a mess I can reluctantly let him come with Thor. Do you still have time to go for your morning run with Sam tomorrow?"
Toni stared at him for a moment with her cheeks in her hands, "Evans, I remembered, all the good you've done for me, it's all fake too."
"No," Toni shook her head still laughing, mentally saying to herself you're messed up, "The plot is not possible! I mean, you'd look at any girl with those eyes and she'd freeze, but it mustn't mean no, no one can say no to those eyes."
Steve's perspective:
Toni, who had been in Steve's arms, put on her armour and broke out of the window the next second she received the news. Immediately after Toni leaves, Steve's communicator goes off as well. As he waited anxiously for the building's lift, he suddenly noticed that Jarvis, who would normally be reporting the lift's location at this time, was surprisingly quiet.
without doing a strict number count on whoever’s using them.
Tony tunes him out and refrains from digging his index fingers into his temples. He wants Advil, but he knows he’d left the little bottle of bliss in his car. That doesn’t stop him moving his fingers around in his pockets as if it’s going to appear there.
The other is his husband.
Tony wheezes out a gasp and backs away, right back to where he stood a moment ago, with Steve’s chest pressed to his back.
Tony blinks a few times slowly, and his cock begins to harden simultaneously alongside his processing of the situation.
if you didn’t show up.” He watches the man’s lips spread into a smile. The way his chest rumbles with laughter behind the Dior he’s wearing has got Tony in a trance.
It’s an invitation, a forged one, made in the exact style and with the exact paper as the one Bucky had been formally provided with.
The lifeguard doesn’t even blink in his direction.
Tony ponders the situation as he walks the remainder of his route home.
Too nervous to laugh, Steve sighs and sits on the ottoman instead to face the pair.
He runs a hand down his face, the butterflies in his stomach flying rampant once again. He’d had a plentiful amount of time to think of how to word this, but that’s exactly what he’d forced himself not to do in the time he and Nat had waited for Bucky to return.
He takes a deep breath. He hadn’t noticed it before but—
Steve really can’t help himself.
“Stop—St-Steve, stop.
He chokes again, startled as she examines him, her camera strap thick around her neck. Even in the dark, the dimmed streetlights outside the alley allow him to get a good look at it—a Nikon, with larger lens attached.
“Anthony. Do you know what you learned in that fifteen minutes?” Howard asks him when Tony wordlessly follows his father out into the hallway. Rhetorical, Tony knows, but he wants to tell his father that firing people who he’d been patting on the back only twelve hours ago isn’t much of a lesson.
Howard would blow a fuse as soon as the night was over, and it would very much be blown in his direction. Tony is better off keeping the fact that he’d seen Nomad do any of this under wraps anyway, unless he wants Howard finding a way to tag the blame for this on him otherwise.
"Tony?" Steve said again, the wobble in his voice like a jagged dagger twisting in Tony's heart as he met Tony's eyes. "Sweetheart, where's—?" He broke off, swallowing hard. "Is—is he—? Oh, God, is he—?"
Tony tilted his head, his fingers clutching Steve's in a white-knuckled grip. "Pete's told me the same thing. He says she's one of the only nurses who acts like she actually cares about him."
"No, I'm pretty sure he's just sleeping," Howard said, or rather slurred, nearly tipping over in an attempt to cross his arms. "He seemed fine when he went to bed."
Three seconds later Sam Wilson appeared next to Clint, looking like he'd just returned from a hard run.
"Ahh, the quantum
"It looks incredible, honey," he finally choked out. "Even better than I'd calculated. It's—it's—"
Which meant that all Steve and his teammates needed to do was use the tunnel to transport themselves back to that point during the Battle of Wakanda, and wait.
"Copy that," Tony said, barely audible. He glanced back at Steve, still holding Peter in his arms with his eyes firmly trained on his friend through the window.
him. I lost our son, and—" He held up his right hand, examining it as if he somehow didn't recognise it. "Pete fell apart right in my arms 'cause I didn't do enough to stop it, and there is no such thing as healing from that."
"Huh?" Blaster Guy shrieked, right into Peter's ear. "How the hell do you know that?"
Before Obie could say anything else, Tony hung up the phone, grabbing his glasses and sweeping out of the room before he could call back.  It was amazing how easily Obie could completely obliterate the good mood he’d been in with only a few choice sentences.
"Then we need to get the ship up and running! Like five minutes ago already!" Tony exclaimed. "Quill, you got any tools on that ship of yours?"
He’d rather not get slapped in the face in front of his father’s press team.
At the same time, Tony’s own mask had been boldy decorated, but he was still very much recognizable as the one and only. The way Nomad had spoken to him about his father was…confusing to say the least. Maybe the man had been looking for a negative reaction, poking the bear with a stick. Anyone that knows of him knows he’s Howard’s media-painted poster child.
"Yes, that's correct, but we gotta be a bit faster on the button or we'll never win this," said Gwen. "Peter, give me a one-sentence explanation of the Polish Solidarity Movement."
"Shit," he breathed as he plopped down onto his seat, his heart thudding as he dug into his pocket for his earplugs. He had been trying to not use them or his glasses as often lately, thinking it was way past the time for him to be used to his genetic enhancements by now. But with how on edge he was with Dad out of town and the general uneasiness in his family, he hadn't yet been able to get through a day without them.
"Loud and clear, Tony," answered Bruce. "And, thanks. Now I can maybe go take a nap before the little old lady who runs one of the pubs here tries to get me to eat more of her lutefisk. Yeesh. I'm sorry, but that stuff is nasty!"
Steve told himself for the umpteenth time, tightening his arm around Tony's lax body. Tony let out a sigh in his sleep, sliding his leg across Steve's lap as he burrowed impossibly closer.
I can’t wait to see what you guys think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
Tony's heart soared. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been able to cuddle with Peter while he slept.
Whether or not he would get to all of the items on his list remained to be seen, but just as he did every other day, he would take things one list item at a time.
In fact, if
"'Bout time," Sam said as he came up on Steve's left side, with Natasha and Bruce crowding in between Tony and Clint. "Let's get this done."
Peter blinked. That Saturday just happened to be the day before Valentine's Day, which meant he should probably get her some flowers or something as well. "Uhh, sure! Yeah, um… that's—that sounds great! Um—"
"I don't doubt it," said Uncle Bucky. He pursed his lips, his eyes intently studying the board. "I wouldn't worry about your dads too much though, Петр. They know damn well what you can do, they just don't wanna admit it 'cause they think that'll mean you won't need 'em as much anymore."
Which, Peter realised, only ended up adding to
Steve yelped as he whirled on the doctor. "You mean you can open one of those portals directly into my
Hurrying over to Gwen, Peter stopped short as she gave Dad and Uncle Bruce a sort of shy wave, letting out a high-pitched squeal as Dad drove away.
Bucky shot him a downright wicked grin. "What do you think Sam is for, hmm?"
“Acetylsalicylic acid.  As you wish,” JARVIS said as the diagram brightened from blue to red.  Tony’s heart fluttered as the device simulated the conversion of raw chemicals, at a cost of mere pennies on the kilogram, into a supply of pure aspirin powder in a matter of about sixteen seconds.
It was just the "again" part of that thought that was so painful.
"Might wanna get behind me, honey," he said. "I'm about to run a test on the repulsors."
😣 = the angst is killing me!
"Hey, buddy!" Dad said as the door swung open. Peter gasped as Dad wheeled Papa inside in a wheelchair, looking like he'd been through hell in his huge, goofy sunglasses and his hands and feet all wrapped up in thick white bandages.
"Steve," the voice said again, this time a bit louder and more insistent. Once again, Steve ignored it, remaining locked in place on the ash-covered ground, staring bleary-eyed at the remains of what used to be—
"Yes," Shuri said firmly as they arrived inside her lab, which to Steve seemed more like some futuristic movie set than a workspace. She quickly directed Steve to lay Tony down on a table, one which Steve was only semi-shocked to see was suspended in mid air. "He will live as long as I work quickly."
And then Steve's entire body went taught, his legs shaking around Tony as he came so hard that Tony had to palm himself to help stave off his own climax.
Which at the moment didn't seem like it would be anytime soon. Not surprisingly, ever since Liz's party and the disaster that followed, Dad and Papa had cracked down on Peter even more, even going so far as to station extra security guards around the school again and install new safeguards on his phone, alerting them if he so much as stepped a toe over their predetermined perimeter. At first he had been so angry with them for taking away his Spider-Man suit that he made the decision to not speak to them until they gave it back. Even though it had been destroyed beyond repair, Peter felt that as long as he still had the suit in his possession he could at least pretend that he was Spider-Man.
enjoy :D
“Anthony—Did you hear me?
As expected, it ends relatively fast—Steve empties into his condom within a few short minutes, and Tony is left hard and hot and bothered without anyone to fix it but himself.
“Babe, what are you doing here? Where’s Stevie?”
Hydra. They’re infamous among the infamous. A group of taggers that are solely known for their uninhibited violence. Their graffiti is mediocre, at best, but that’s never what they’d made do from, usually just painting their wretched symbol anywhere they leave a half-to-death beaten body or befuddled armed-robbery victim.
A voice in his mind supplies.
Then he thinks of the stolen keycard, still in his possession, and the bag he’d left behind in his flurry to escape potential jailtime.
Steve keeps the shop open until seven after dealing with a handful more of regular customers. The anxiety bubbling in his chest and stomach eagerly begins to build up as soon as he finishes closing. And by the time he’s at his apartment, which Bucky and Natasha have already let themselves into, he’s practically shaking—antsy and raring to get the show on the road.
Tony isn’t really having the best time. He stands in a small, uninteresting circle consisting of himself, his father, Lucien Stone, and Lucien’s son, Tiberius Stone. There’s an obvious tension between Lucien and Howard that makes Tony rolls his eyes behind his golden mask. Their stupid rivalry had gotten old a long time ago, and the hate between the two of them is obvious. Almost everyone who keeps up with business news thinks that both Howard and Lucien must get off on their weird obsession with comparing dick sizes every time they’re in the same space. It’s tiring, and even more so when he has to constantly tell Ty Stone that he’s not interested in getting together for…anything really.
The three of them notice a figure leaping onto a mini jet ski and zooming out towards the drowning child, who evidently thought she could swim so far without the use of floaties. The presumed lifeguard reaches the girl in seconds, dives into the water with a clean swoosh, and quickly helps her onto his jet ski. The three of them watch in fascination as the lifeguard reaches the shore and helps the still crying child onto her feet. He bends down and seems to whisper something to the girl, whose loud wails cease just as her mother reaches her and picks her up, thanking the guy before carrying her child away.
. Talk later.”
It’s quite a sight to behold, all three of them out on Malibu beach together so early in the morning.
warning for a flashback containing domestic abuse after the words “He lived that truth.”
“Strip. I’ll be right back.” And by the time Tony is pulling off his last article of clothing, Bucky has returned, a silky red ribbon in hand that’s promptly used to tie his wrists together behind his back.
Tony looks up at his boyfriend, annoyed that Bucky’s attention is still on the ceiling fan rather than on him. Instead of putting his mouth back on Bucky’s cock, he climbs onto the couch next to him, and begins to place kisses on his chest, then on his abdomen, and finally one below his navel before he begins to lick the taut skin till he’s once again down to the base of Bucky’s dick. He does it slower this time, the way Bucky likes it, teasing the head by popping it in and out against his cheek. When he feels a hand slide into and grip his hair, Tony begins to further lower his head, only to suddenly yelp as he's yanked off.
“We? Howard wouldn’t personally crucify
Besides his good looks and lovely Australian heritage, Thor prides himself in being the Beyoncé of the surf world. He’s just known as Thor—first name only—to most.
He then whips off his sunglasses and shakes out of his hair, water flinging off his sun-kissed body as if in slow motion.
Well. If Howard was mad before…
Bucky, bless him, responds immediately, and Tony feels like melting when he’s lifted up and carried to the living room. Instead of being set down on the couch, like he’d expected, Bucky drops him onto the coffee table in front of it.
Suddenly, it feels as if his heart has dropped into his stomach.
He makes his way across the pedestrian crossing on Brooklyn Bridge to return to Manhattan for a second time.
Tony jerks his head away from the sight before him, frantically moving to grab his phone from his jacket pocket and pressing at the home button to unlock it.
is an anonymous New York-based street artist, vandal, and political activist. Typically recognized by his unique stenciling style, and his distinct portrayal of satire through street art and inflammatory epigrams, Nomad has become quite the living urban legend.
Bruce looks to the side and shrugs. “I mean…”
Tony shakes his head. “No, but—”
When Tony says nothing, Steve continues.
Howard gives him a hard stare but keeps talking. “Leave. Check the progress of whatever you submitted to R&D, leave, and be back by ten. You’ll dress accordingly, mask included.”
“Did I say you could stop?”
With a horrified expression, Tony tries again, and again, and again, but wiping his stained hands against his slacks only causes the drying, sticky blood to shift around on his fingers.
Steve thinks Howard Stark must have shit his pants when he saw it—the masterpiece had been removed from the building only a few hours ago. He’d stopped by Stark Tower during his lunch break to watch from the ground as the last of it was washed away. Steve remains quite proud of himself. The difficulty of getting onto the building’s roof that had nearly killed him was worth every bit of effort he’d exerted.
There are three cans of paint in the bag—two black, one red—along with the two halves of the stencil used to paint on his father’s office walls. Tony has the things spread out on the floor as he sits in the surveillance room on floor five. To no surprise, the room had been vacant when he’d entered. Pascal had been fired on such short notice, after all. It shows.
Staring at computer screens for several hours daily might not be worth it in the long run. And he’s not extremely satisfied that crouching over in the shitty chair at his desk has got him taking prescribed back pain medication at 23.
He settles into his mask. He’s Nomad.
. He can’t even think of anything to say when the man continues speaking, of all things.
of an attention grabber. It’s been nearly a year since then.
Tony immediately pushes Steve’s hands away from him and takes a step forward.
An itch to do
Tony raises an eyebrow that the man can’t see and purses his lips for extra emphasis that he doubts what was just said. He quickly pursues the statement, feeling bold. “Howard Stark is a cynic and a bastard, why else would he have a ball in his penthouse suite? It’d be suicide to not show up to this…” Tony pauses, remembering the look Howard had given him, the
Seconds later, Steve is on his knees in front of Tony’s face.
Tony watches, silent and shaking, as the phone, as if it’s some delicacy, is slowly pulled from his hands. He watches as it’s pushed into Steve’s back pocket, and he can’t help but let out an insignificant whimper of protest.
(See the end of the chapter for
he repeats when he feels himself grow hard.
right onto Howard’s desk. When Steve is finished wiping away any accidental prints from touching the glass, he takes a moment to admire his work, and then leaves the room. Quick and easy.
Although he had extended a bit of an informal invite to his top two rivals after the award ceremony…to scope out what he needs to beat next year.
With easier access to the surfer lifestyle, he’d gotten a palm-tree tattoo within his first week of living in Malibu, and has since surfed every notable beach on the Southern California coastline. Steve lives to surf, and loves getting a reaction from people when he tells them he’s from New York, of all places.
Steve has pushed him down to the floor, so they’re both on their knees, now inches away from the soon to be rotting corpse.
In the name of art, justice, and
He manages an art store in Brooklyn and when the chances become available, displays his own small exhibits. Other than that, his life as Steve Rogers is extensively normal. He makes good money, is in good health, and is content with himself.
And before she can call him a dumbass, he speaks up again. “How many times are you going to come here and not buy art supplies.” It’s no question, because she does this at least once every few days. Steve appreciates the company of a friend, even if only for a little bit during his day, and he doesn’t have to tell that to Nat. She knows, she shows up. Steve appreciates her ways of knowing.
Blissfully fucked out, Tony curls up against Bucky before they need to get up and clean off.
The soft purr of the capstan’s motor is comforting as he bolts it down to the flat roof and turns it on. He’s surprised he’s managed to get up here—the very top of the tower, above the fancy balcony. He’d expected security to be tight. Even though he’d brought all his equipment with him, he had expected to be caught and pending arrest by now.
He still thinks he could have done better, but there’s nothing he can do about it until the next Championship Tour.
“Tell me why you came,” Bucky grunts, dragging Tony by the hair to sit up straight.
Steve can’t help but choke out a laugh at what he gets out of context. “You bruised Tony Stark’s forehead?”
Natasha seems to get that he’d rather not let it out just yet, and just shakes her head. “Wait for James. There’s no point explaining what problems you had twice.” She responds, at least seemingly less bitter with him now that he’s confirmed that he actually got the job done.
He’d gotten large with the help of support from popular activists—through viral posts on different sites and so on. His first big hit—the stencil he’s sprayed on the building to the right of NY’s very own Trump Tower, had been
Tony acknowledges the warning, but he’s been to enough of these to know proper etiquette. He knows—he was forced to learn the names and work of everyone attending.
He almost wishes it was darker out, after seeing the woman grimace at him as she let’s go of his hoodie strings and takes a single, short step backwards. “Yeah. Taking a walk at three in the morning in an alley full of
Stark Tower after winding his way through the party. He’d be immersing himself in the social affairs of the very one percent of the one percent that he’d hated for so long. Last night had been one thing, the prequel to what’s really going to set off Howard Stark—tonight’s hit will be revolutionary.
Steve makes a face, a mix between offense and acceptance, and sighs. “Just don’t ask where I got it. And I’ll need it back tomorrow morning.” She hands him two dollars for the chocolate and is gone before Steve even tries to print out her receipt.
Bucky pulls him close and bites at his ear. “Go ahead, doll. Take what you want. Show me how much you need it.”
Pursing his lips, Tony takes another look at the items on the floor.
He wonders who had the balls to unnoticeably breach Stark security, mount the peak of the tower, and stencil graffiti onto the front wall extending above the balcony floor. Tony thinks it’s absolutely brilliant. Quite bold, but nevertheless brilliant. And well,
His thighs burn like hell, but he refuses to stop. He loves the feeling of Bucky inside him, filling him up deep and bare, he loves fucking himself on Bucky’s length, loves how only when he’s panting and sweaty and out of it that Bucky wraps a hand around his cock and squeezes hard until Tony’s hips are stuttering and he’s spilling out onto Bucky’s stomach.
He’s not at a bar or a club or here to flirt or whisk little billionaires away. He’s here for a hit, and he’s gotten all he needs from the main event.
“He wasn’t good enough. God…You do it so much better.”
Ad campaign with Gatorade makes up for the lack of.
When he finishes with R&D, Tony practically runs to the elevators that lead to the parking garage, antsy and quite obviously annoyed with his pounding head. He ignores elevator etiquette when he reaches them, and quite painfully runs right into the exiting party of one. The
Of all the events he’d participated in, Bruce had raked together an exceptional overall score total of 56.650 points, landing him safely in the third place spot.
Stark Tower. A piece quite obviously headlining the protests against Stark weapons development. The protests and calls for action against Howard Stark that are constantly ignored by not only the man himself, but the federal government as well.
Flat-out and bare, there is nothing wrong with Tony’s relationship with his husband. He loves Steve very much, and he knows the feeling is healthily mutual between them. It’s why he’s spending his morning with Steve in their bedroom—like any normal couple would—getting driven into their mattress like a wanton whore.
“Come on, let me show you.” He pulls back from the hug, and suddenly Tony’s wrists are being gripped very tightly, and Steve is dragging him towards the soggy newspaper.
He’s looking for one now, now that he’s somewhat cleansed his mind of earlier in the night and is really trying to clear his head this time around. Since he hadn’t brought any supplies with him, he can only wander around looking for bare walls or leftover space in between what is already taken.
When Steve stops, and his touch disappears, he visibly shudders and moans in protest.
Tony closes his eyes wistfully, it's beating so fast that he thinks his heart might explode.
Again, it’s Natasha who pays the driver the cab fare, and as soon as the two of them are safely behind the closed door of his apartment, he can feel that she’s cross with him. It makes him grimace, but he knows he needs to explain everything that had happened.
speaking of new characters, anyone guess Jess Jones before i mentioned her name? (i think it was pretty obvious lol)
Steve and Thor look at him, “Muscly idiots?!” They blurt in unison.
When he begins to climb back up the lifeguard post, they don’t even pretend not to ogle his ass.
Bucky brings down his hand again and again. Tony curls his toes and cries out.
He can’t help but let a part of him think of Tony Stark stepping forward from the shadows, and the way his eyes had reflected the light pouring in through the windows, even behind that golden mask. The way they’d danced together, the way they’d challenged each other so easily just a short time ago.
Ever eager to please, Tony takes the words as his invitation to crawl down from the table and settle between Bucky’s legs. He puts his mouth to work, sucking and swallowing and absolutely gagging himself on Bucky’s length, pushing past the feeling of dejection when Bucky doesn’t even twitch, or even look at him for that matter. He pulls back with a pout, licking his reddened lips.
tony feels like he has something to prove, steve is paranoid, and howard’s still a raging ass.
Besides Brooklyn, Steve supposes he owes Hell’s Kitchen a good bit for the development of his graffiti career. The first hit of his that he’d actually tagged as Nomad had been in the district, and that definitely wasn’t the last that he’d done around the area.
He refuses to open his eyes as Steve lets go of him, and he continues to drag the mouth around him back and forth.
Bruce snorts out a laugh and runs a hand through his damp hair. “Yeah right. A babe like that wouldn’t be interested in you two muscly idiots.”
“You Americans.” Thor speaks up. “Let me show you how it’s done—”
With the job essentially done, the rush of adrenaline is fading, and now he just feels uncomfortably anxious about the last component of all of this—not getting identified.
“You’re on.”
“Steve, what’s that smell?”
That’s why he’d kindly flew into Malibu to meet with his dear friend and rival Bruce Banner.
Only when the tide has finished rising, do they get out of the water to take a break for drinks.
He had been called a realist—a hypocrite. Of course it all makes sense.
who encourages me to keep writing!
He rubs a hand down his face. His palms feel slightly sweaty.
“Continue.”
“You? No fuckin’ way dude.
Tony whines at the wet, sticky, stinging feeling as he reaches for his cock, and he knows how this goes, how Bucky gets when his thoughts are nothing but lewd and demanding, so it’s no surprise to him that he doesn’t get much stroking in before his arms are pulled above his head and Bucky is gesturing for him to lay back.
(See the end of the chapter for
It would be odd for him to question Steve about his fidelity—it would imply that he doesn’t trust Steve, and reveal one insecurity too may.
Ew can you imagine jeff bezass, mark suckerfuck and elon muskrat at the same party—being hosted by howard stark???? It sounds absolutely terrifying. If they breathe too long around each other millions more workers will be subjected to unfair treatment while theyre forced to package bought and paid for teslas that are being shipped to mars (for free in 2 days). On top of that if you complain online mark zuckerberg will crawl through your screen and just…stare at u. and howard just started ww3.
“I asked you a question big guy.” It’s a woman, Steve looks up, feeling slightly less disoriented.
With Steve beginning to tongue into his mouth, he can do no more but let himself fall apart.
Steve looks a little bewildered.
Steve, recently turned 30, sporadically teaches art classes at the local community college.
“We all ride a wave, whoever gets his attention gets to talk to him.”
“Look at that,” Bucky whispers into his ear, “you see how much of fucking slut you are? You look like a rentboy. An amateur pornstar.”
Tony tells himself again as Steve whispers how
He knows this symbol.
“I don’t see why that matters—”
His hands shake as he reaches up to cover his mouth in shock, only to feel a warm trickle of liquid down his finger.
His heart is pounding in his chest, and he’s clutching onto Tony Stark’s SI keycard like it’s a lifeline as he removes his mask and walks across the street. Natasha is waiting for him in the café, sipping whatever drink she’s ordered in a booth near the back wall. When Steve approaches her, she simply stands, throws her cup away, and pushes a bag into his hands. A change of clothes, presumably. It wouldn’t make sense for him to let more than who he needed seeing him in this get up.
He’s always been a surfer at heart.
Is all that’s running through Steve’s head—from the moment he’d sprinted away from one surprised Tony Stark to the second he’d exited the building.
Nomad obviously had obtained an invitation, and Tony only has a semblance of an idea of how—either he’d had a real guest give him theirs, or he’d possibly forged one. Tony thinks the former, but if the latter, that would mean the exact format and wording of the invitations had been leaked to him somehow.
Anyone—everyone in the New York graffiti scene knows this symbol.
“All right.” Steve speaks up again, not wanting to hear the end of whatever Bruce is going to say. “I’ve got an idea. How ‘bout a competition?”
gonna go over there right now and give ‘im a taste of Brooklyn.”
And that was just yet another thing that scared the shit out of Tony.
Steve stepped back, his hand resting on Tony's shoulder as Tony took his place.
"What's that, Tony?" Steve asked. "I didn't quite copy."
"All right," Tony breathed against Steve's lips once they broke apart. "So, I'm getting the impression that you feel pretty strongly about this?"
"Uh huh," Peter said. "Thanks, Uncle Sam."
"It was a joke, honey, okay?" Tony said, rolling his eyes. "You know I tend to joke—"
Did HYDRA have Peter too? Or did Tony manage to get him to safety before he was captured?
And that's when he sees it.
But before she could conclude her countdown, the hangar area was rocked by a bone-shattering, near deafening
With a heavy sigh, Tony grabbed the clothes Rhodey had left for him, shoving the standard-issue black cadet t-shirt over his head and pulling on the army-green pants, once again wrinkling his nose at the drabness of the colours.
And after the workday he’d had, the timing of it all just royally
Almost.
"Pete came up with the idea that instead of making the satellites into weapons, we could instead have them function as continuous energy conduits. There's a device, one that the government's kept a deep, dark secret for years, that if utilised correctly could be a source of unlimited clean energy, and Pete got the idea that if we took that device and channelled its energy through the satellites and into the planet's power plants, that—"
Until that awful day when it finally hit Tony that Steve was suffering too, just as much as Tony. He had just been better at hiding it.
"Honey, Bruce doesn't even know if your temp's up high enough yet, so—"
"Hey, JARVIS?"
Reaching behind him to his bedside table, Tony grabbed one of the wintergreen mints he kept there, popping it into his mouth as he studied Steve's beautiful face. His sleep was a peaceful one, his forehead and eyes free of the worry lines that had marred them for so long, his jawline relaxed and supple, and his chest slowly rising and falling with evenly measured breaths. Leaning down, Tony pressed a soft kiss to each of his cheeks first, then to his forehead between his eyes, his nose, and finally his chin, dipping underneath to find that sweet spot just below Steve's jawline that never failed to make him shudder.
Which was at least partially true. Dad and Papa had sat Peter down a couple days after they got home from Wakanda and explained most of what had happened, starting with what Peter remembered—the arrival of the Q-ship and travelling to Thanos' homeworld, which by itself was still really freaking cool—and ending with what was apparently the do-over version of things, the second Battle of Wakanda.
“Hey, buddy,” Tony said, his heart giving a little flip as Steve gave him a small wave.  “Good day at school?”
The air temp inside the car seemed to have risen at least ten degrees over the course of their conversation, partially fogging up Tony's glasses and making him feel as though the walls were closing in. Sitting inside a parked car out in the rain was not the ideal place to be having such an intense conversation.
"And Helen too," said Natasha. She shot Tony a worried glance. "Just in case."
"Going to parties together," replied Ned.
"I wasn't keeping secrets!" Tony said, dangerously close to shouting. "I was just—" He drew back, shaking his head. "Look. You were already so upset about the fact that I flew that missile through the portal—"
"Yeah?" answered Gwen. "My mom took my two youngest brothers there to see the last Pixar movie a few weeks ago. She said it was pretty nice."
"Thanks, Papa," Peter said, smiling softly. He had witnessed his dads being so lovey-dovey with each other so often during the last nine weeks that it was almost funny. They could barely pass each other in the house without stopping for a quick kiss—and sometimes even a not-so-quick one—and now that the television people had started to bring back shows and movies that used to be considered "inappropriate", the three of them would often pile onto the squashy couch in the living room and watch together in the evenings, with Dad sitting with his back to Papa's chest and Peter cuddled up next to Dad, Papa's hand resting on his shoulder.
"Uh huh," Peter said, his eyelids already heavy. He blinked them open again, forcing himself to focus on Dad's face. "Um… I need to ask you guys something else, it doesn't have anything to do with… well, anything, but—"
"I need to eat something," he gasped. His heart was racing and sweat was still pouring off of him, dripping into his eyes and onto the floor of the hangar as Bucky planted his palm on the middle of Steve’s back and guided him to the self-service section of the mess hall.
"Hey, buddy!" Tony murmured, his brown eyes shiny with tears as he took Peter's hand. "How're you feeling?"
"Oh," Gwen replied as her face fell. "Um… he's been sleeping quite a bit, hasn't he? I mean, it's been four days now, and everytime I try to call he's always sleeping. Doesn't that worry… someone?"
"But this will, Dad, you just have to let it!" Peter pleaded. "I've never seen you so happy in my whole life! Not ever! You love Steve, and when two people love each other they're supposed to stay together! Whatever it takes!"
Peter, his precious boy, was growing up, and right before his very eyes.  Especially if his rollercoaster voice changes and his constantly shrinking pant legs were any indication.
Clint frowned, glancing at the screen as if he just realised the rest of them were still there. "Um… well… that one morning I was going to, but—" He broke off, scowling fiercely at Steve. "You know, I was in the middle of a perfectly good nap—"
"Hey, hot stuff," Tony murmured as he picked up Steve's sketchpad, setting it down on the nearby table before crawling onto the chair next to him. Steve curled his arm around Tony's shoulders and pulled him close, burying his nose into his husband's hair, slightly mussed from the sea breeze but still as soft as ever.
"Oh, Christ, you know how much I love that giddy optimism of yours," Tony rushed out. "But honey, as much as I might want to, I can't promise anything until I get a good look at what Lang's brought us. 'Cause if it's based on what Hank Pym's been up to, then… well… there's no telling how messed up it is."
"And plenty of security guards," Tony said. "I'd want 'em stationed at every building entrance, and down by the gates to the driveway."
Shaking his head clear of thoughts of blue eyes and broad shoulders—and don't even get him started on those sinfully kissable
Even now, just thinking about the deep-seated hurt in the boy's huge brown eyes when he spoke of how much he missed his father, hurt so profound that it made Steve hurt to even look at him, made Steve want to punch something for the unfairness of it all.
"Gamora!" Quill shrieked as Thanos lifted a struggling Gamora off the ground, scrabbling desperately at his fingers around her throat. Quill reached for his blaster, slamming the hilt into Thanos' chest. "Let her go, you son of a bitch! Let her go!"
"Well, no, nothing specific. I just wanted to check on you," Gwen said, a bit shortly. "I was worried, you weren't answering my calls."
"Dad?" Peter asked, his quiet voice startling Tony from his anxiety-induced daze. His clenched hands were still trembling, his fingernails leaving moon-shaped indentations in his palms as he watched Peter Quill yammer his way around the surface of Titan. He'd told Peter that he had come up with a plan for when Thanos finally decided to show up, and he had. But at the moment Tony was still grappling with the almost overwhelming desire to claw Quill's face off with his bare hands and then try to escape back to Earth in his ship, Strange Wizard and the goddamn Time Stone be damned.
As much as Tony would enjoy seeing his precious boy's smiling face after working so damn late yet again, it wasn't worth it for Peter to miss out on the rest he so desperately needed. The boy needed all the sleep he could get, and Tony could no longer afford to be selfish about it. Not if he wanted Peter to make it to his twelfth birthday.
"Oh boy," Steve muttered under his breath. "Of all the times for Hulk to want to hide…"
"Only Colonel Phillips and the nurses at the hospital," answered Steve. "I've never told anyone else. Not even my teammates."
As soon as the screen went blank Tony pressed his palm to his chest, where Steve's dog tags rested against his heart. Steve had given him the dog tags before he and Nat left on the mission that ended up snowballing into Project Insight, telling him that they symbolised a departing soldier's desire to be reunited with his sweetheart.
Three strokes from the wall, Steve takes a breath, hitting his flip turn on an absolutely perfectly-timed downstroke.  His left shoulder twinges again as he pushes off from the wall, but he barely notices it, too focused on that painted black line leading him down the stretch towards home, and the gold medal he hopes is waiting for him.
Or at least, he was for the moment. Ever since the water monster attack, Peter's nightmares had been flaring as well, with one of his most recent escalating so badly that he and Tony ended up having to summon Bucky to help contain him. Steve had been a nearly inconsolable mess once they finally got Peter calmed down and back into bed, to the point where Tony threatened to call Sam to come up and talk to him, only backing down when Steve refused to stop begging him not to.
A knot the size of a bouncy ball rose in Tony’s throat.  Leave it to Peter to be more worried about Steve than his own injured self.
"Aww, Buck! I'm so happy for you!" Steve exclaimed as he clapped Bucky on the shoulder. "That's wonderful!"
But not at all unkind.
Peter frowned, holding out his hands. "It's a bit hard to explain. I know I don't exactly look it, but I'm—I'm really, really strong. And sticky. I can climb walls and stuff, so—"
Peter’s cheeks pink up as he shakes his head.  “Ah, no, Ms Mags.  It’s not soccer season anymore.”
"Really?" Peter exclaimed. "How long will it take?"
"Do you want me to call Helen?" Bruce asked Tony after he'd handed Steve a cold pack for his nose. "I mean, Peter seems like he's okay now, but—"
good to hear, Phoenix One," Tony said. He checked over his datapad, breathing out another small sigh of relief when he saw that Barnes and Carol had emerged as well, and that all three aircraft had assumed their calculated orbital positions. "All three orbits look good from here."
And until the mission was completed, that was just unacceptable.
"You mean, one of those glowing circle things?" asked Sam. "You can do that right into the Tower?"
"Yes," Tony said simply.
"All Phoenix aircraft prepare for takeoff on my mark, fifteen second intervals," Steve said over the comm. "Takeoff in three… two… one… mark!"
Peter nodded, closing his eyes.
Mr Stacy stared at Peter while he chewed, and Peter held his gaze, almost daring him to look away. "And who would get to decide if he can join the Avengers? Captain Rogers?"
Gwen opened her mouth as if to protest again, but then snapped it closed as Dad lifted Peter into his arms, carrying him towards the medical Suburban driven by Uncle Bruce that had just pulled up to the curb.
Peter sucked in a sharp breath, clapping his hand over his mouth. Was it really that simple?
Steve grinned, brushing his lips across Tony's jaw. "Then why don't we start now, hmm?"
“I’m not,” Steve says as he takes another gulp of his juice.  “Or at least, I haven’t been.”
"Well, my father was of the mind that Wakandans should only take care of their own, that we should not get involved with the rather messy affairs of the rest of the world," T'Challa replied. "And to be honest with you, after what happened in Namibia, it would have been quite easy for me to continue along that same path. But after the attack on your home, and the discovery that the Soul Stone itself resides within our borders, I no longer believe that it is our destiny to hide from the rest of the world. We all must band together, as one single tribe, if we are to face what is coming."
For the better, Tony believed, but even good change was still change.  And something he had been conditioned very hard over the years to avoid, as Rhodey had so bluntly stated the night before when Tony had called him with the news.
The look of surprised delight on Papa's face was almost enough to bring tears to Peter's eyes.
"Huh? No, that's not because something didn't work," Tony insisted, rolling his eyes. "That was because I couldn't tell Rhodey what was going on with the suits, and—did you really have to bring that up
"Стиви, he's trying to fall asleep again!" warned Bucky.
Tony thought bitterly.
"I know that," Tony said. "But, damnit,
"Dad, I think I'll be fine by tomorrow—" Peter started.
"Well, at least there's that." Steve slumped back against the couch, wincing as the ribbed collar of his t-shirt rubbed against the raw skin of his neck. "I just don't see how this is supposed to help anything. I don't—I still feel like a live wire, ready to explode, and—"
"Captain Rogers," the man said, standing in front of the sparkling circle as if it were something completely normal. "I need you to come with me right now."
"An attack!" Peter cried. He scrambled to his feet, practically yanking Gwen's arm from its socket as he pulled her up next to him. "We're under attack, so we've gotta get out of—"
"No, I don't think so," the voice responded, this time from the opposite direction. "You shouldn't be here, Peter. You're just a silly little kid, don't you know that you should never go off on your own?"
"Damn, you have such a pretty ass, baby," Tony whispered as Steve broke away, throwing his head back as Tony rocked up against him. "I mean, not that the rest of you isn't perfect too, but
To Tony’s shock, Obie suddenly burst out laughing, pinching the bridge of his nose as he stepped around to the front of his desk.  Then he leaned against it, crossing his arms.
"Then I am afraid that I have misled you, which is not at all my intended purpose," Thor replied. "Along with the assistance of Dr Selvig and Jane Foster, I was able to defeat the Dark Elves, yes. But, as much as I tried, I could not destroy the Aether. Not with all of my power channeled through my hammer was I able to destroy it. And now, without my hammer… I fear that it would be truly impossible."
"Backup pilots are scrambling now, Colonel," said Rhodey. "Time to airborne is two minutes."
thought I was dead, and—"
" Tony begged. He brushed the sweat-dampened hair from Steve's forehead, pressing another kiss there. His arms were trembling around Steve as he held him close, his ear pressed over Tony's heart. "You don't have to tell me how close I came to losing you. Gods, Steve, I don't—I can't even think about it. I can't—what would I tell Pete, huh? How could I ever explain that to him? He just got you, he can't lose you now!"
"No, I will go first, to make sure it is safe for you," insisted Drax as he drew Mantis behind him. Then he pulled out a pair of long, slightly curved knives that had been tucked into his belt, holding them with the pointy end down. "If I am not immediately murdered, then it should be okay for you to follow."
was it a sight to behold. As far as Tony was concerned, there was nothing more beautiful in the entire universe than the sight of Steve's gorgeous face twisted in the throes of pleasure.
He couldn't go there.
"All right." With a final fidget, Grandma stepped back, smiling as she looked Peter over from head to toe. "Oh, my sweet boy, you're just so handsome," she said as she cupped Peter's cheek in her hand. "A true heartbreaker."
"Oh, shit," Sam said in a low voice. "So, does that mean that—?"
And then, as Ma would say, it’s off to the races.  Stroke by stroke, Steve barrels down the centre of his lane, his legs kicking a mile a minute as he heads towards the far wall.  He doesn’t dare look for Schmidt, or for the swimmer on his opposite side.  If Phillips managed to drill anything into Steve’s head over the last four years, it’s that in a 100 free you don't have time to do anything except swim your own race.  If you look, you get beat.  So don't even dare to think about it.
"I'm still counting at least ten more hostiles inside the building," Sam said as he swooped overhead. "Nat and Thor have most of 'em pinned inside, and I've taken out at least three, but—"
"Spiders are not insects!" he wheezed as he broke free. With a snarl, Thanos then picked him up by the shoulders, launching him directly at Dr Strange, knocking him flat.
"Everything looks good here," he muttered, more for himself than anyone. He really had no reason to believe that the mission wouldn't be a roaring success. JARVIS had proven that he could function flawlessly during the two weeks of full-mission simulator sessions completed by Steve and his teammates Bucky and Carol, and so with the final blessing for the initial trial mission given just three days before by General O'Brien, the time had come for Tony and everyone else to find out if Project Phoenix actually had wings.
"Good. Tony?" Steve asked.
Peter smiled as he shifted on the bed, his stomach already growling from the delicious smell of his breakfast. It had been so long since he'd eaten a meal that was actually hot that he'd almost forgotten what food was supposed to taste like. Ms Sharon had tried to deliver his meals in the hospital as soon as they came up from the kitchen, but after sitting on the kitchen carts for who knew how long and the fact that Ms Sharon was always assigned to too many patients than really was feasible, his food was always lukewarm on a good day, with it most of the time just being downright cold.
"Will you try and get some rest tonight too?" he asked. "Maybe even go home instead of conking out on your desk like you like to do?"
"Yes, sir," Steve said, confused. "But I don't understand how this is relevant to—"
Happy Holidays to those who celebrate!
Sam had warned Steve that it might take awhile for his sex drive to return once he started treatment, and that he needed to be patient while he waited.  It was almost a month after Stane’s arrest before Steve even felt comfortable enough for Tony to give him a handjob, worried that the loss of control he would experience during climax could potentially trigger another breakdown.
"Ah, sure." Replacing the slide with the one containing the incredibly detailed diagram of the X-302's rocket booster, the diagram that Peter had drawn for him, Tony sucked in a deep breath. He was now getting to the most important part of the presentation.
"I'm so sorry, sweetheart," Steve murmured. "I wish I could do more to help you."
"And you think this guy will be able to fix it?" Tony asked. If Steve was never able to run again… well… Tony didn't want to have to think about that at the moment.
"Love you too," Peter mumbled as he cuddled a bit closer, listening to the calming sound of Dad's heartbeat. He let out a semi-contented sigh when Dad's fingers wove into his hair, rubbing his scalp. Dad had told him too many times to count that the only way he'd been able to get him to sleep—or stop screaming, as was usually the case—when he was a baby was to tuck his head against Dad's chest over his heart, and rub his head.
Tony can pretend.
His mantra of distraction becoming impossibly more vital as he consciously begins to jerk his hips forward, fucking into Steve’s blood-slicked hand with little thrusts and gasps.
Tony fiddles around on his phone in the next 5 minutes it takes to get to his stop.
of a violin being carried through the apartment via speakers.
As if there isn’t a dead body just feet away from them.
One is the man who can relentlessly fuck him senseless and ruin him with a fervent sense of depravity.
Tony has his hands comfortably placed behind his head. His knees are bent, and his legs are spread appropriately.
His legs, his arms, his expression—all frozen in place from the trauma of discovering from what he’s come home to.
“But I thought they’d disbanded. Thought they weren’t a thing anymore.” He finishes, his words clipped.
Watching him work took Tony’s breath away. He drinks him in. The man was fluid with his medium, his movements well-practiced, clearly exhibiting skill. His focus so unbreakable that he evidently didn’t even notice Tony just standing there, taking in Nomad as if he was performing for him, and him alone. It’s a selfish thought, and Tony supposes he’s always been a little selfish as his mind warps this into something intimate, even though it remains as something he shouldn’t even be seeing in the first place.
