Once there, Steve was on the ground with his assailant above him. His hands around the super soldier's neck, and his knee lodged in the soldier's wound. Leaving Steve in a silent, croakily, scream.
He swore up and down to Steve, once they came back to the apartment, that it looked like a weapon. And not surprisingly, Steve believed him. Even though he didn't want to.
“Well, Yea. You and-” Steve stopped himself realizing the name he was going to say. It’s funny how right now he was actually wanting one of Tony’s side comments, quips, teases, really anything.
"I wouldn't trust myself with scissors. So I'd just go into town to get a haircut." Tony joked. Still hoping to break any more leftover tension.
"I know we weren't suppose to leave. I know we weren't suppose to steal one of your ships. But dammit, w-we helped people today!" He protested, "I saw, We saw, a young girl die today. Die right in front of our faces. Her screams will forever haunt me. But honestly what I'll take from it, is at least she died, with us fighting to help her! Oh! And may I remind everyone hear, that one of your airships might've killed a couple more people when you swooped in to get us. Great Job, Today! Let's go celebrate, drinks are on me!".
"Oh no... It's way past your bedtime! No come on, and make sure to be silent as a mouse." Pepper protested.
Since the incidents, Steve has tried to be a bit more levelheaded when it came to the kids acting out. Parents can lose their temper from time to time, but never Steve. He never wanted these kids to have the childhood he had with his father. It sends a shiver down his spine to even think back to those days when Steve was nothing but a scrawny kid. And his life was nothing but an endless vortex of disappointment and worry.
"Well... I guess I should leave. I hope this doesn't make anything between you and me, bitter." Steve stated.
'They did it. They actually did it.' She somberly thought, whilst smiling unconvincingly. Just like Steve and Tony, Pepper didn't want this night to end. Fearing her fate with her husband in the morning. She knew he'd never leave her, but a part of her feared that Tony may have felt something with Steve tonight.
"Me and Sam are. Steve took a beating, twice." She uttered that last part. Steve had recovered, but still was resting quite a lot.
"The... sex is fine. I noticed that she was looking at me, but she wasn't upset. She simply walked up to me and gave me a hug. It was like a goodbye hug you know. But as she let go of me, and said it was nice to see me and Nat. She didn't explain herself further." He explained.
No one was around, or even in sight. He peered out to the front lawn. Pepper's car was there, along with Steve's. Tony was a bit confused, 'where is everybody?'.
The idea that he would have to tell this sweet woman that her house wasn't meant for him, absolutely butchered the soldier's confidence.
Steve didn't say anything, admiring the beauty of the backyard and observing the other buildings sitting there. There was a monitor barn with a gambrel-shaped roof sitting near the back edge of the property. A garage, sitting adjacent to the barn, facing west, which sat a few feet from the screened-in porch of the kitchenette. And what looked to be a large river or bank of water, on the edge of the property.
In their disagreement, both sides would add new recruitments to the Avengers. Scott Lang: Ant-Man, Peter Parker: Spider-Man, Wanda Maximoff: Scarlet Witch, and lastly, Vision. All of which, were not left out of the division.
The blonde got out, gathered up his wet clothes, threw them in the hamper, and laid down on his mattress. Sleep was overrated for someone like him. But the minute his head rested against the pillow, his entire body just melted into the sheets.
The groans from everyone around the common area fell upon deaf ears. Nonetheless, the group all sat on the cushioned couch, in the little nook, by the soda machine.
Tony kissed her cheek and held her in a loving embrace. Like Clint, Tony loved these moments with her. But was utterly baffled on how he reacted to her comforting presence. Pepper let go, smiled timidly, and walked out. She felt some angst build up, but swallowed it immediately. While heading back down the corridor, feeling really defeated, she bumps into a sleepy eyed, Steve.
But apparently, he'd been obvious from the start. So he might as well come clean about it. "The truth?" Tony stuttered.
Kamala, noticing Steve's smile, had once recognized it as a look Abu would give her. She called it the 'Relieved Dad Look'.
Sure, most people could do this in a heartbeat and not feel a thing. However, this wasn't something Steve would usually do, or ever cared about doing in the first place. He's always looked out for other people's desires and hopes, never for himself. Yet, now that he's being put in a position where he has to make these decisions based on his desires. It was wrong to him.
This sends the two of them into a fit of laughter. Fury and Thor notice it, but don't pay too much attention to it. As they are discussing the urgent matter, that brought them back in the first place.
These 'venting talks' were Steve's way of knowing what was going on with his friends, since everyone scattered after Natasha's funeral. It got especially chaotic when Wanda had seemingly got into some trouble with a New Jersey town. Sam's racial discrimination with being the New Captain America. Even Bucky, who had a few more issues to deal with.
The room fell silent again. Natasha sat back down, letting her tears drop down her face. She looked up to her companion, and he still was crying.
He sighed, "Okay, okay. I'll see about this place. But we're going to have to reschedule the appointment we already have set for this afternoon.".
"I do have compassion! But we have orders that need to be followed precisely. And when he's on a mission, I need his headspace clear. Along with those lips of his.".
"Tony, I know you've been going through things. And I think it's because you missed the team. That you missed, well... us, our friendship. And like I said once before, I am happy for you. But I am willing to do anything at this point... to help you." Steve stated calmly.
Steve sighed again, "I don't know, Bruce. I feel it's not my place to say anything without Tony here.".
It wasn't like they could ask a random agent if they knew anything about initiator cores? And they didn't dare ask Hill, as she had more important things to worry about than temperature fluctuations. Maybe they'd find someone at the Ant-Hill? Pym knows a thing or two about the cores. He could help?
Breathing heavily, he raised his head, and looked weakly to Steve. He quickly dried his eyes, feeling embarrassed. But no words left his lips. His mind was no longer functioning. The super soldier’s facial expression, was completely understanding and yes, comforting. Tony was starting to realize why he kissed him. Steve was an attractive man. Even if you were straighter than a line, you couldn't deny it.
"Come on, Steve! It's already cold outside. I, at least, want to pet them before it drops below zero!" Jenny complained.
She looked, and felt, beautiful. Yet, as she looked into the window, and saw her reflection. She wasn't smiling.
"But anyway..." Tony sighed. He walked over to his incredibly messy station, still mumbling to himself, and was about to pull the monitor back up.
It was damn near nightfall, and Steve was getting hopeless. Miles of forest, on both sides of his car. Seemingly looking dominant and almost foreboding. Steve never expected trees to look this intimidating. But in this situation, everything did.
Tony didn't say anything, still giving his pecks of admiration onto Steve's neck. The soldier simply chuckled, and simply laid the both of them back down onto the sofa.
This was going to be it! The house that Steve can find his purpose in, again. The house that Steve can feel at home in. And maybe someday, the house that Steve can raise a family of his own in. But all of those hopes and desires were still to be determined.
He also knew that this is probably Tony's first with a man, this way. So he really wanted to make it as special as possible, also considering the fact that this would be the only time it would occur.
I mean, Steve never found out annoying. Just truthfully, disappointing. He didn’t understand why Tony was so much more risk-full when it came to his life falling apart. And why it seemed to correlate with Steve. But this time, it was different.
“Cool.” Sam situated his body back into a comfortable position. Probably wanting to head back to sleep.
Half the population, gone in a flash. The families, the children, the animals, any sign of life, turning into dust.
"I thought you went deaf for a second. I... I know, it will hurt. Plus your search would be futile, cause I haven't used 'lube' for sex in like three years. And a condom... really?! I thought you at least knew this much about me!" Tony relented, "But I trust you. I promise. Just... keep going. The pain is usually temporary.".
The brunette laughed, and he and Natasha began to talk about Kamala. “She’s a natural, that kid. I just hope she knows that we’re here to talk to if she needs us.”
Half an hour had passed and Steve was beginning to feel antsy. So much so, that he was beginning to seem uncomfortable by just standing there. He looked to Tony, who seemed just as impatient.
Every now and then, he would contact them. Using the same phone, that he was waiting for Tony to respond to. He'd genuinely asked how they've been, and if they needed anything. Wanda was glad, and satisfied with this. Yet for Vision, his friend was across the ocean.
Steve ended the call shortly after. Still grinning so hard that his face was going to freeze that way. He was so honored to have the two in his life. Even if he wasn't able to get anyone, he at least have Sam & Bucky. The ones he'd call his home away from home. The two brothers he never had. God, he couldn't wait to see them today!
She was her father's daughter indeed. Every little thing Morgan would do would be an instant reminder of Tony.
Sam made his way back to Steve and grabbed a gun. Like Natasha, the gun felt familiar to him, so he was able to figure out how to operate it rather quickly. Even pondering at the fact, on how Hydra was able to create such technology. But then again, it’s Hydra, what do we expect.
Steve grabbed it mid-air, and took a bite of it. It was salty, but seriously cold. He of course spit it out in utter disgust. Now Happy was the one dying from laughter. The soldier looked to the two men, and simply smiled once more. ‘This is nice.’ He thought. Eating said fry made Steve come to another question, that he honestly should’ve asked before sitting down.
It's short. I know, it’s meant to be short. The next one will be longer, and more dialogue driven. ‘Cause we finally get some Sam and Steve friendship time! Yay! And yes their conversations are about Tony.
He finally sat down and looked to the fireplace. No passionate flames to be seen. No, beautiful, naked, comforted, philanthropist next to him. Just him, and the memory.
"You're that daily," Ziggy remarked. She began to lean on one hip. Trying to indicate to Steve, that she was getting impatient.
"Listen guys, we just had a moment. I was struggling mentally, and he thought that would calm me down. And it did." Tony continued, "We've already discussed it, and he and I know it wasn't anything more than a simple mistake.".
Suddenly, a light above illuminated the area around Steve. He froze. It wasn't his new bedroom that he was in. It was that dark room with the table between him and that creature. But, the first thing the soldier noticed was there wasn't anyone across from him this time. Just a simple chair, sitting quietly.
Tony rolled his eyes, and turned around to his workshop. Sighing in such an exaggerated way. Yet Steve just smiled, and then continued.
Pepper really tried to defend them. But each time she did, it made her feel even more worse. How could she let Steve do that? Why would she even allow it?
The building itself was red, with a least four floors and a rooftop. She swiftly headed inside and could see him heading up the main stairs. Following him, she continually looked up to see if he was heading up to the rooftop.
The light above them began to flicker. The creature now leaning over the table, inching its way closer to the soldier.
The boys got the message, and were grouping to a back alley behind the market. They had noticed a couple of men go behind the booth, and to this alley. But did not expect the sight before them once they arrived. Two trucks sat quietly, with a few dozen men speaking in Russian, to a few people opposite them.
They seemed to've lost their minds. Which is honestly the nicest way to put it. Screaming, running in circles, cursing the skies above. They all believed the end had come.
Steve could see Tony's uncomfortableness as if he wasn't even trying to hide it at this point. He really wanted to talk about Siberia. It's been 8 years now, if anytime was necessary to talk about it, it should be now. Yet, he nodded along hoping that their conversation about their past would be soon.
His eyes shot open. He could hear himself grunt as he raised from his bed. Looking around, he could see the slight crack of light from under the door leading out to the hallway. Strangely, that’s honestly all he could see. His stateroom was blurry, and dark. Whilst, Tony felt like a pile of dog shit. But he knew sitting there wouldn't make him feel any better. And honestly, he didn't even want to elaborate on his fever dream.
"I contacted Stark, again. To see if he could be of any assistance with this little dilemma. And he was actually able to be of some help." She continued.
They were chatting in his room, like they had usually done after a stressful day at work. Tony vaguely remembers the conversation, but it must've been important as it's the only one he can remember at that time.
The back door opened to the raging sounds of snowfall before all went quiet when Steve closed the door behind him.
He knew, he knew that it was... Tony. The ghost-like philanthropist suddenly turned to the soldier, and uttered a sentence that gave him his confirmation.
"Well... I was trying to make some breakfast for your guys. And I think it's kicking my ass. But, I think I'm getting the hand of it." He answered.
Steve once again smiled, relieved at the fact that he was getting to see some friends again. Two years, to most of the Avengers felt quick, compared to Cap. To him, it felt like 10. Even after his own personal drama, he was pleased that at least he was getting the calm before the storm.
His mother, Sarah, came into the festive room and stood at the opposite end of the table, cutting what seemed like a piece of meat.
He had asked if they could freeze his body, just in case they were able to find out how to bring him back to life. Okoye disagreed at first, still in shock at what just happened. But eventually relented, and they haven't seen their friend, since the chamber closed. And Vision froze away.
Nat and Clint began to speak to a Russian family who lost two of their family members. Bruce was helping a little girl look for her mother. She lost her before Loki sent the rest of the Chitauri into New York. Steve and Tony were discussing with some bruised and badly cut police officers, about the building collapse. But the conversation took a sharp turn, when they noticed the thousands on injured civilians, just wandering around.
"Ah yes..." Thor says amused. He looks at Tony again, and can see a different expression. One that Thor is all too familiar with. "You seem hesitant to speak of him.".
But on the other hand, if Steve Rogers was wanting to ditch a party for something a bit more interesting. Tony couldn't pass this time up for a little adventure. And honestly, he wanted to keep his mind off of a few things, and just have a little fun.
He was looking off to certain parts of the house, not daring to look at Tony. As it would've shattered any attempt at keeping his composure.
But in hindsight, he must’ve waited a little too long. Natasha, and a few others were the only ones who actually left the building.
The two men finally had reached the stairway, at the end of the tunnel, leading up to the surface. And as the sun temporarily blinded them, the scene before them, made the two duck for cover.
Later that morning, Tony came downstairs to his family sitting in the kitchen nook. All eating some pancakes that Steve had cooked. They weren't black so he guessed Steve's cooking was improving.
With an ounce of luck, he actually found the brunette's sweet spot. And like a siren being turned on, Tony went off. His soft breaths were now short, wild moans. Moans that were almost in sync with Steve's rhythm. This finally got the soldier to relinquish his own.
"I-I-I d-don't know. It just seems a bit... wrong. Steve would send a manhunt for us." She stated, "Not even that, but Natasha would have our heads."
"No, No, your fine. I guess I just needed someone to give it to me straight." Tony stated with a smirk.
“Thank you, Happy. But I can’t. Not with all of this on my mind.” Tony croaked, before spinning his chair back around playfully, and stood back up to the board.
"Ooh, I think you left the chicken in there a little to long." Steve teased, as he exaggerated a mouth chomp, as to say the chicken was hard as a rock.
"No, you and them back there, don't know. That pain she had that day, no one does. This pain, a father's pain, My pain, is something so, so emptying and darkening that only people like me, can get out of." He replied somberly.
To think, about various situations with his once friend. It always occurred though, when Tony was alone with his thoughts. If Pepper, or their daughter Morgan were in the room, his thoughts of the super-soldier would disappear.
Since Fury's call to the team, Nat and Bruce have been practicing, in one of Shield's underground parking lots, on a mechanism to help the green guy get calm. Through numerous failed experiments, they were finally able to find a solution. The team likes to call it, Hulk's lullaby. A simple tune that Nat hums, while also slowly letting her hand graze his massive palm. Through those weeks, Nat and Bruce really bonded with one another. More or so than she did with Steve. From their first encounter together, to now; there was obvious growth shown. Many afternoon's was spent laughing, wheezing, hitting, and crying. A truly unforgettable experience to say the least. One afternoon however, sticks out more than others.
Steve leaned his forearm on the doorframe, "I'd ask why you're here, and how you found me. But I already have my suspicions: Shield.".
It was the truth. Steve could've found an abundance of ways to help the hurting brunette. But he knew, from what happened with their kiss. The only way Tony could've truly laid to rest what happened was letting Steve comfort him. And it needed to be stronger than a kiss.
"So you thought, sneaking into my room could be a solution?" Steve joked. Tony felt his cheeks get a little warm, and Steve noticed Tony's obvious embarrassing blush. It was the first time he's seen it.
"Alright, you caught me. What now?" He asks. Steve didn't like being this way toward her. But he knew she'd go back and tell Fury about his absence, or worse Tony.
Steve Rogers was everything that Tony wanted to be. Smart, skillful, brave, honest, and some nice muscles wouldn't have hurt either. It honestly astounded the philanthropist on how much he actually looked up to the man. And so did his father.
"Really... I didn't think sticking your tongue down someone's throat is a good way to get someone out of their funk." Nat added, now with her mischievous smirk, "I wonder what would happen if I tried that on Bruce?".
The team looked dumbfounded. How could they have possibly picked a solution, in that short amount of time. The group's expression went from confusion to relief. Yet Tony and Steve were still not convinced. Nat eventually asked Fury who would be doing the clean up.
She groaned. Waking up before 7, has always been the most annoying thing of her life. It reminded her of when she used to be Tony's assistant. My god, how it seems so long ago. Yet still feels as if it was yesterday.
"I know, I know! I shouldn't still be thinking about it. But... Tony we never really talked about it either. It's been eating at me still, after all these years!".
Tony took notice of this, and again felt obligated to keep it going. He knew Peter had questions, that he wanted answers. But the philanthropist couldn’t bring himself to want to, or at least not yet.
"But remember, I have to walk around a lot tomorrow. So don't have too much fun down there tonight. Kay."
Not only did half the population disappear, but so did some of the Avengers. The Guardians, Doctor Strange, Bucky Barnes, Sam Wilson, Wanda and Vision, and Peter Parker.
Steve almost pouted in response. He really wanted things to be different. But they weren’t, and he was just going to have to accept that.
Tony raised his hand in acknowledgment. "I know that, Steve. Just... not right now, please. Let's just find you a house first, and then we can talk about it. I mean, I didn't know it was affecting you still. But you and I,
Nevertheless, she grew to like it. The lame being her favorite part of it all. Sometimes each morning, she would come and sit at the banks of the lake and softly hum to herself. Mostly for when she was feeling down.
“So now that we’ve explained ourselves can we go see them now? And sell some drugs while we're at it."
Steve eased the tension in his shoulders and chuckled a little. Finally looking back to Tony to apologize.
But Steve normally doesn't get sick like this, really at all. Since the serum, he hasn't had to deal with the many issues he had had beforehand. I mean he did get sick from time to time, but he hasn't felt this nauseated in a long time. It was odd.
The sound, while annoying, does hold some nostalgic memories with it. More specifically, towards a man from his past, Howard.
“Yeah. And look, man, I don’t judge you at all. I know that Tony and that girlfriend of his were still together, when you guys, you know, did your thing.” Sam added, “But Nat told me that you and he sorted it out. And that y’all we’re good.”.
Steve quickly responds with, "Pepper had just stopped me in the corridor and told me how strange he was acting.".
He didn't even wait for Tony's response. He just threw himself up and was running his hands through his now disheveled hair.
Tony, Peter, a few others who called themselves 'The Guardians of the Galaxy', and a surgeon turned 'wizard' known as Doctor Strange; fought Thanos directly on his home planet, Titan.
This sends the group up from the table, paying for their food (Well Tony did), and into the apocalypse. The team honestly were amazed at the level of destruction they were witnessing, even with the Chitauri gone, and Loki under surveillance. The town was utter obliterated. Cars, buses, vehicles of any kind were no longer on the roadways. Some were in shops, others were a few stories high in office buildings. And let's not forget the fires that raged through the town. It was literally hell on earth.
"Steve... I know you want to help them. But you and I both know that you can't do this alone." She states comfortingly.
Just an hour ago, the Chimera gleamed with vibrance and holiday cheer. Tribulations and conversations were discussed. And even when the lights and music died down. There was still some left for two avengers, who finally were getting a night to rest.
“Yup, her funeral was so hard for me. I didn’t even want to find love after that. She was my first love, someone I cherished most. And Sharon, I knew she liked me. But again, it wasn’t really anything to me.”.
It was always Captain America this, Captain America that. It truly was an irritation for a boy like Tony. Yet even growing up, he never knew why his hatred for the man was so apparent, till he finally met the man in tights. In which, he could easily found out the answer.
A 5-floor building, with an abnormal shape to the structure. All in all, the entire building was around 100,000 sq ft. Windows were large enough for two cars to fit through. And hundreds of crates sat around the building.
The super-soldier seemed very distant, which kind of confused Tony for a moment. The brunet waited for another response or at least an indication that he was invested in Tony's attempt at a conversation. Yet when Steve didn't answer or even acknowledge his presence anymore. Tony huffed loudly, catching Steve's attention again.
Natasha had left a few moments ago. So, it's pretty much been him, alone. Kamala and Bruce waved at him from time to time. To which he politely nodded. But still no Steve Rogers.
Steve, and even Pepper, had seemingly forgotten about it as well. Just like their kiss, their 'bonding' moment, became nothing more than a forgotten memory. Who knew, a year’s set of events could completely obscure a situation like theirs.
Nat smirked to this, while feeling the memories of 2 years ago flood back to her subconscious. Even after the whole situation with Loki, The Winter Soldier, and Hydra. She really didn't feel 2 years had passed, but they did. In that time, Nat surprisingly grew her relationship with Steve, during these last 2 years. Fighting with Hydra, honestly was a bonding experience for the two. Especially when her constant innuendos she would produce, were toward Steve finding a date. Of course there were to no avail, because Steve is more stubborn  than a damn mule. Yet like everyone else, she had forgotten about Tony’s and Steve’s ‘act’ of comfort. Maybe Steve couldn’t forget about a little old thing like that. But her profound experiences from the past, were interrupted once an elevator dinged.
'Did he just say 'friend'? OMG! Captain America just said I'm his friend! Okay, Okay, Okay, just play it cool, Kamala! Play it cool!' She contemplated eagerly.
Yet in her descent, she was able to grab onto a piece of broken railing, and hung there. The man took this chance to run, and run he did. He fled past her, and ran from the building. Nat cursed once more, and pulled herself back over the railing, and fled down the fire escape.
The girls consisted of: Annie Baker, 6; Tina Davis, who was 8 (They slept in the room opposite to Steve's); Ziggy Burman, 16; and Jenny Smith, 18 (They resided in the front-left room). With the remaining two boys being: Peter Parker who was 17, and Tommy Casto, 19 (They had to sleep in the front-right room, adjacent to Steve's).
The revelation that Tony was joking with him instantly eased Steve's nerves, and he slowly laughed with him. "Oh! Nice one!".
The super-soldier remembers the rest of the night being, him & Tony, talking some more before the brunet had to leave. Apparently, his driver was still in the car, waiting for him. They had talked for over 3 hours!
The pain in Steve’s side seemed to subside, and the blood stiffened and dried quickly. Seriously, thank everything holy for the serum.
“Yeah, we were good. And truthfully, I don’t think we ever really did fix our issues. We just discussed it, and then, that was it. Nothing was ever done about it.” Steve admitted.
"Keep it up, Shellhead, and the next miracle your seeing is me blinding you." She smiled mischievously.
Tony felt a chuckle leave his mouth. He was, albeit a bit too much, fascinated at the super soldier’s past. Sure Steve and him haven’t had the greatest friendship, but it was growing, morphing, changing. And it was surely, due to this moment.
Steve said ‘Bye’ to the blonde, and 4 hours later, here we are. The super-soldier completely losing his mind.
When Fury contacted him about their new mission. He'll admit, he was very hesitant on doing it. In all honesty, Steve wished he never bought that phone. He could've blamed it on his 'Old Guy' personality.
"I know. That is why I asked. I want this... Us... to be very excelling at our communication skills." He stated with a chuckle.
The blonde told Peter he'd think about it, considering he already had four other kids living with him at this point. The two eventually said their goodbyes and went their separate ways for the time being.
The conversation suddenly drifted off, and the two women fell quiet. Wanda really was done with all this hiding, and running. It felt dirty, filthy, and complicit.
Eventually, the two stumbled (And no, I’m not exaggerating) into a room, that thankfully had no outside windows. It was dusty, the putrid odor was present, with it being almost pitch black in there.
That is until, her husband died in the war, Steve stating a month prior that he wanted to train in the army. And her job, as a nurse at the tuberculosis ward had been literal hell.
She sat thinking to herself for quite a while. Looking through every type of possibility of them leaving together could cause. Then re-evaluating it, with the other possibility.
From what Steve could see, the front door swung idly, in the darkness that it was enveloped in. 'I guess I won't be needing that spare key.' Steve jokingly thought.
Steve finally felt tired for once. And so he too took the appropriate amount of clothing before heading to sleep as well. The exhaustion of these last few days starting to weigh on him.
Natasha walked slowly back to the table, feeling a little relieved. She would sit there for a few more minutes, before heading off to Steve’s apartment complex.
"Thank God. I thought I was going have to do that all night." Tony confessed with an exaggerated sigh.
Steve moved his feet to the downstairs bathroom and threw some water in his hair. Which had now grown back to the hairstyle he'd had, when on the run from Ross.
Steve was panting profusely but nodded his head in confirmation. "Yeah, Tony. I'm okay, just a bad dream is all.".
An elevator ding from the far end of the room, made them all look toward that part of the room. It was Clint, Maria, and Cho. There were some hugs, some laughs, and some more conversations, before the clock finally hit 7:30.
Natasha noticed this, and even though she didn't want to ask. Her question still came out. "Is everything alright? You look like your about to tell me someone's dog died?".
Tony just laughed, with Steve chuckling afterward. "It's okay," Tony chuckled, "You're just 'too big' for the couch.".
They played for what seemed like hours, but was only half of one. A stomach growl eventually had ended the battle, and the family headed downstairs to eat a celebratory supper. Needless to say, the kids won.
His feet scurried to the kitchen to grab the napkins, then back to the front door. Pepper thanked him and wiped Morgan's mouth. She finally cracked a genuine smile. And then took her gaze back to the lake.
In his playboy days, that's all he did. He'd dance with women, bring them back to his penthouse, have a little fun, and off they went the next morning. And of course, there was Pepper who was always the one picking up his side-pieces. He truly wonders how she fell in love with him. But hey, Tony has an undeniable charm to him, that just makes both women and men fall to their knees. It could give reasoning to why he kissed Steve last night. Steve is essentially Pepper in man form. There both caring, selfless, loving people. And yet, they both can be bitches at times when they need to be.
"Alright." Pepper gave him a go to hell look, and simply kept quiet. She knew when Tony was going to go into a sermon. Yet she honestly couldn't wait to hear it. Thor and Maria finally appeared, as Tony finally began his lecture.
Once up though, he usually used this time to reflect, but could feel the wave of nausea hit him like a bullet. And so, he flew to the bathroom in a quick haste.
Nope! He was coming in here to grab some napkins. Not to recall the little details of his first time. Especially not right now considering the circumstance.
The soldier smirked amusingly as he headed back into the ship. Hoping he remembered where Tony kept his secret stash of liquor. Even if he couldn't get drunk, he at least was helping Tony out.
Kamala shook her head, with no answer following. Steve looked to the others. Nothing but mildly confused faces, all lost in thought. Except, Tony.
Pepper could see and feel his body tense, and become clammy. "Are you ok?" She asked. His fake smile and 'yes' response, does not impress her. 'Why is he acting so strange?' She thought. But, she chose to ignore it. Blaming it on exhaustion, and Tony's own pride.
"Could you give us a minute Pepper?" Nat asked softly. Pepper nodded and went down to Agent Hill, to hear about her breakfast fiasco. Nat pulled him to a corner, and slapped the back of his head.
Yet, as Tony stood next to him. This type of worry felt somewhat personal. He kept his gaze on the soldier's icy, azure eyes.
The decrepit building sat empty, and dark among the others on this lot. Windows shattered, graffiti along the concrete wall, and weeds coming up through pieces of the sidewalk along the property. Even some ivy crept up the rusty, and very unsafe fire escape.
She huffed in annoyance. Laying her body down on the bed, she still kept to her thoughts. "What do I do?! What do I do?!" She yelled. Not caring of any who could hear her. 'Maybe... Tony?' The thought flashed in her mind. Giving her a quick way to decline it.
That's another thing he could go on and on about. The love he has for one super-soldier. How they got together is beyond him, yet he's so happy that they did. Everything about him made Tony's cheeks blush, and his stomach do somersaults.
Steve took a glance to the confused philanthropist, and immediately felt amused by it. He knew Tony would be confused, and he knew Tony would be thinking about every possibility as to why they're heading out there. Yet guilt started to creep in, and Steve decided to put him at ease.
And so, Steve went erratic, trying to find the spot, even picking up some more pace. With his head buried into Tony's neck, while the brunette's hands hung onto his shoulders.
Yes the Accords were pretty straightforward, and Steve didn’t like the idea of being tied down for government regulations. But this war was personal. Personal on a level, that Nat desperately wanted to know why, as did Wanda.
But even with all the dismantlement, Steve could feel his brain painting a picture/memory of him and his mother, sitting quietly at the table. Of course, this was before the serum, so Steve was drastically shorter in height. And his constantly drooled over muscles, were non-existent. He just sat at the end of a oval shaped table, waiting for his plate.
Tony just looked at him with eyes of distraught. Why would he do something like that without asking him? What purpose would it serve, other than his own? Yet Steve continued, and it made Tony sick to his stomach.
The now long-haired, full-bearded, scruffy-looking man looked to her with instant worry. ‘Cause like Sam, Steve didn’t expect her to be back so quickly.
"Oh, you mean this," Tony touched the reactor with ease, so use to its presence. "Well... Cap it's a pretty long story.".
Not once, but twice. 'He knew. He knew... and yet didn't tell me.'. Tony was lost in his mind. The diner really did bring back a lot of memories, good or bad. But they all correlated to his and Steve's friendship.
Y’all, we’re here. The last chapters are what you’ve guys been wanting for the last month and a half. And I hope your hearts are ready for all the raw feels!
All these frustrations lied in their minds, as the team sat at an outside diner. They at least wanted to fill their stomachs before the upcoming battle. Mostly Steve, who was still cutting his food with some utensils.
After taking a second to calm down, she continued, “I'm just tired of everyone telling me that it's all going to work out. It's going to get better. Well, it hasn't! I just… I just feel like I'm drowning in a never-ending whirlpool of shit!" She confessed.
If he knew house hunting would be this aggravating, he would stay in a cardboard box, for all he cared. He needed some assistance, whether he cared for it or not.
The girls just stared at the blonde, waiting for his response. Truthfully, Steve thought nothing of it. But even though everyone thinks that he's dumber than a pile of rocks, doesn't mean he is. And just because he has no idea of how kids act nowadays, doesn't mean he was gullible either.
"I mean, I know we met before. But it's just nice to actually talk to you without the world ending and such." Peter began to fumble with his jacket.
"Okay, that's fine. And I do understand. Like you said, you just got her back. I don't want to take that from you. I'll try and reach Wanda or Vision again, and see if they will respond." She voiced.
The super-soldier brought his lips back down to Tony's and got to work. His hands gliding around Tony's body, as if he was the most expensive piece of china ever made.
More questions slipped from the teen’s mouth. It was almost like word vomit. Yes, the battle in Germany was surely a conversation starter, but now this! This, is every gossip girl, news reporter, and TMZ photographer’s wet dream!
Everything from Steve first waking up from the ice, to Shield collapsing. He even remembers a special incident, just after the battle of New York.
A few hours had passed and the sun was already setting on the horizon. The sky turning that gorgeous orangish-pink color that Steve always adored.
"The ship. Does it have a name? I mean, every ship/boat has a name." Tony wondered. His tone full of honesty and intrigue.
After some more passionate kisses, Steve felt his foot slip from the couch cushion. His body nearly fell off into the floor, and almost taking Tony with him. "Oh sorry!" He uttered.
"So if we find them in a, you know, situation. Who’s  grabbing Tony, and who's grabbing Steve?" Clint asked amusingly.
"I... I honestly think it's because... I just don't feel comfortable talking about... you know... sensitive things. Like almost dying." He uttered, "Pepper, Thor, Fury, never made me feel comfortable enough to tell them.".
"Steve... Are you even hearing yourself?! I can't just cheat on my wife! It's wrong! It's, it's immoral. It's honestly, something I would've done a long time ago." Tony griped aggravatingly, "And I have put those days behind me, where I want them. And if that means not having the Avengers, or you in my life. I am willing to do that for her, and Morgan.".
Vision of course, objected to it and admirably took the plates from her hands. She gave him a peck on the cheek, and he continued his route to the sink. She did ask if he wanted help with the cleanup, but he softly declined, saying that she was worthy of night off.
For a couple of straight guys, they were certainly enjoying themselves. They didn't want their moment to end. It was such a new experience, that they both wanted it to continue indefinitely.
"Yeah, yeah, I'm here." Tony got up from his bed and headed to the living area of the mansion. Pepper, who finally forgave him, was still sleeping quietly in the bedroom.
The duo ran back out of the office, and up to the attendant. They had asked if there were any car dealerships around. She of course responded with a simple, “No.”. Still with that lazily, enthused tone of hers.
"It's this thing she does every morning. Could you check for me, please?" Tony insisted. His tone sounded worried.
Tony huffed in annoyance, and continually called to the guy. He finally got Steve's attention after a good nudge to the soldier's thigh brought his eyes back to him.
Tony pushed his hand away and looked to the soldier a little dumbfounded. “Then what is it?” The response now sounding bitter.
Smile like a school kid getting his first kiss at a dance. But his feelings were short lived. As he had realized, that he just kissed another woman's boyfriend, behind her back, after she just confided in him to help the poor sob.
Bruce nodded his head in approval, "Of course! I just feel I could contribute more if I at least knew more details, is all I'm saying.".
He felt himself slowly sit at the chair behind him, while keeping his eyes glued to the super-soldier. His gaze then followed the rope along the board, taking in every piece of information that he was witnessing. Tony really was trying to paint the ‘big’ picture before him.
Natasha Romanov didn't know what to do anymore. 4 years, she's been sitting in this godforsaken lounge, sipping on some coffee, she had made. Her presence being the only soul there at the compound.
"Judging by the fact that I see no furniture inside. Nor do I see a car in sight. I'd say signs point to yes." Tony offered as he looked through, what seemed to be the downstairs, living room window.
Who could she talk too? Wanda or Vision? No, she hasn't heard from them in a while. Possibly Shield? That one hasn't been much help either. Thor or... Bruce? That would be just plain awkward.
The eerie glow that illuminated the room, flickered continuously in resistance. Both men now were having a hard time to see around, due to this nauseating light.
Clint just looked astounded. He didn't think Tony would do something so reckless, yet so open. He turned to a completely wrecked Tony. 'My god! Please stop looking at me! Jesus, Would he tell Pepper?' He thought frighteningly. He felt his stomach twist and start to cramp.
"Funny, Tony. Anyway... I..." Steve felt his palms drip with sweat. His stomach kept doing somersaults. And if that wasn't enough evidence to show Steve's nervousness. His determination to not look Tony in the eyes should've been a dead ringer for the philanthropist.
Since the Avengers first began, they've tried to keep their little 'boy band' constantly up to date with their situations. Usually, around the holidays, they would throw some small get-togethers just to see how everyone has been.
Then, it all fell apart. Thanos, also known as the 'Mad Titan' and his galactic army, appeared on Earth. Wreaked some havoc, and the Avengers stayed separated.
Tony nodded softly but still seemed as if he was trying to hold back any signs of completely breaking down.
"Well... they kind of, you know..." He says a-matter-of-factly. Thor can sense the remorse but it must be bottled up. He knows exactly what Tony will say, so he doesn't let him finish.
Coming into the foyer, Steve couldn't see the philanthropist, like anywhere. But he did know that Tony likes to play games, so his mind expected a sensuality's version of Hide and Seek.
"Yes, yes, yes. I hear ya!" Steve shouted as Tony began walking back to his car to retrieve his phone.
His arms were now losing their grip on Steve's back, until eventually falling back onto the sofa. Once Steve lifted his head, with the brunette finally opening his eyes to see him. ‘They did it, they actually did it.‘ He kissed Tony's forehead with a confirmation that it was the end.
For Wanda, it was Steve. Yes they came out together, yes they agreed on terms, but he certainly wasn't babysitting them. It almost seemed to others, as if he could've cared less about what happened to them. But that wasn't Steve.
The negative thoughts quickly dispersed from his head, as his daughter caught his attention. She was smacking her fork on the dining table. It's ringing noise strangely louder than usual.
A sudden rush of footsteps averted his attention, however. Tina and Annie came barging into the room, their faces equally red and puffy as if they had been crying for days. They were arguing over who was allowed to play with Lucy the doll. A Christmas gift that Steve bought them as they had just moved in, a week before the holiday. Lucy was a porcelain doll with golden hair; had on a white dress, and her face was ghastly white with rosy cheeks.
"Did Steve ever tell you what happened with him and Tony, a few years back?" Natasha asked. She didn't want to tell Sam. But she and Clint were really the only ones who knew of what happened. And it seriously was eating her up that she was, now, the only one who knew, between themselves.
The house they were looking for was on Cherry Rd. Not on Bell St. which is where they were driving along. "Tony, you do know that it was on the street before this right?".
Annie finally smiled. A sweet, genuine, smile. Her eyes gleaming with joy. And that was enough for the blonde to lean over and place a kiss on her forehead.
Hope your guys are doing well, and safe. Especially with these horrible events with Miss Rona, and the riots about police brutality! Which needs to be talked about, since these police officers are just disgusting, and need to be brought to actual justice! Please, stay safe! ✌️🏻❤️
The wooden floor, however, was dusty and filled with some trash, most likely blown in from the elements. But that didn't bother Steve at all, it would be an easy day of cleaning.
"Spare me the heartfelt sentiments, I already heard this before from that smart guy, ugh... St-Stark I think his name is?".
Did he have a nightmare? That must've been it. His hands were clammy, and his face was drenched with sweat. Strangely though, Tony couldn't remember it now. God, how he hated these types of dreams!
By the time he finished and fled to the barn to cool down and to feed the horses. Ziggy hesitantly followed him and asked if he was alright. He sighed. Replying only with a stern, "I'm fine, Ziggy.".
This was the final straw, and oddly enough Steve hadn't even gone through the rest of the house. Or even thought of the possibilities of filling it with furniture to fix the dreariness of it all. But Steve, honestly, didn't need to.
The two men came back to reality and they went there separate ways. The team knew they would be taking a big risk by doing this, but what else where they going to do? Stand by while innocents continue to suffer. Nope, that's not what The Avengers were made for.
The blond stopped abruptly and stared worrisome and slightly confused. It finally dawned on him that he didn't 'prepare' Tony.
“Thank you, Uh... please have a seat.” Tony ushered him into the living room. “Just uh, make yourself comfortable. I got something cooking in the kitchen.”.
The endgame is coming, and I hope ur guy’s hearts are ready! Hope y’all are safe, and staying home! ✌️🏻
Apparently, Tina wasn’t that attached to it as she just complained about it for a few seconds, and then walked off to find something else to play with.
We’re going to be stuck in this time frame for a good chunk of this story. So enjoy bearded Cap for a little while. Hope your enjoying the story! Don’t forget to leave a kudos, if you are!
Tony smirked in amusement and sat his hand on Steve’s shoulder in response. But unlike before, Steve didn’t slap it off. There little talk did seem to help.
His body shook with a vengeance. He sweated profusely, and chills/numbness enveloped his feet, legs, and face. Yet, he knew it. He knew why this was occurring, and he honestly felt like punching himself in the gut for it. You know, if it wasn't for the already pain subsiding there for substitution.
"You didn't hear it from me. But I think I saw them get close to each other, like real close." She stated, "Then they just smirked at each other before leaving rather quickly. I honestly didn't think Tony Stark, or Captain America were a bit 'light on their toes'.".
Several SHIELD agents swarmed the co-leaders and urgently carried the injured Avenger to the nearby infirmary. Steve leading the way with electrifying speed.
"Ugh! Why did I have to do that! Better question would be, why I kinda liked it. Oh god, No! That happened only once, it was uncomfortable. I don't swing that way." He complained softly. His back and forth bickering to himself, was not something he wanted to deal with today. A knock from his door, startled him back to reality. The door opened, and there stood Nat.
And just like that, the memory of his utter screw up, flooded his mind. He felt the guilt, and utter embarrassment run through his body.
Being mobbed with cameras, the paparazzi constantly asking for your private life. Oh, how he hated it all. People putting him on this pedestal as if he was God himself. That one makes the super-soldier scoff out loud.
"If you guys are going to do this, for the entirety of this story. Then, I'm gonna go ahead and go do other things." Natasha joked half-heartedly.
So besides the barn, the porches were cleaned, the tree branches removed, and any leftover debris was thrown to the outskirts of Steve's land. Granted these outskirts were covered by woodland, so it made it easier to not spot the debris. But it never made Steve feel a little less shitty.
A few more pecks and the two finally separated. Their faces flushed as if they were both teenagers again.
It was Steve’s. And you could tell him, back and forth, the many reasons why it isn’t. But deep down, the super-soldier swore to the people. That he would protect them till his last breath. Well, he’s still breathing, and the people are neglectfully broken. In his eyes, it was his fault.
Steve looked to his mother, and instantly knew what she meant. He sat his fork down, and just stared at his food. 'No, no, no why is this happening?! She's all I've got left?!' He thought worryingly.
The two men were now a messy amalgamation of moans, grunts, and sweaty kisses. Tony just left his hands on Steve's shoulders, while the super-soldier had his forearm, bracing himself, on the cushion below them, and his other hand, on Tony's own.
Tony chuckled. Wasn't he supposed to be like livid at him? Wasn’t he supposed to be hating the super-soldier? Cursing his name to the heavens, for his parents, for Thanos, for Peter?
"Please. We can still stay out of sight." He began, "We just won't be near the man who started this in the first place.".
Kamala pointed to the trio. Bruce and Kate still in conversation, with Tony now looking their way. "Cap. Come on, what's the big deal? Why are you so scared to talk to them?"
"Yeah, yeah it is." Steve kept his eyes on the house, "Do you think it's for rent or at least put on the market?".
Wanda sat quietly, yet felt herself trying to answer. But her words were strangely mute. What did Natasha want? And what is this urgent piece of information, that she so desperately wants to tell her?
When he, Tony, Tony Stark, finally had opened his eyes. The world seemingly opened up like a flower. The blinding light of the sun losing intensity, with each second.
Eventually, the two got up all together and headed into the master bath to wash up. Tony was swiftly brushing his teeth, while Steve was in the shower. When, the pitter-patter of feet came from the floor above, eventually leading to the staircase.
Kamala walked up to the co-leaders and finally noticed that they were there. "Hey Steve, Tony." She announced.
Steve was mostly the reason they were out here in the first place. Even though she took his side, Nat still felt torn, and even a little disappointed. It didn’t need to go down the way it did, but it did.
Steve looked to the brunette and gave his warm smile. "Well, that's very nice of you Stark. Are you sick?".
And finally, he held the photo of Steve Rogers in his hands, ready to part from it. Yet his hands did not move. They just stayed in place, and softly grasped the picture.
And low-en-behold, he was. He showed up at around 7 this morning and helped Steve pack up some boxes in the kitchen. The two having a very long conversation about themselves. Mainly because the two weren't all that close, just like he and Clint weren't either.
Suddenly, Vision emerged from behind her. As she turned around, her slight scream bombarded Vision’s ears.
"Patience is a virtue, you know!". Sam was about to start pressing random buttons, when an agent whacked his forearm with their gun.
Tony's pitiful protests were silenced as she hit the 'end call' button. Whilst throwing the phone across the room. The anger came back.
Steve answered with another “Yeah.”. The car ride grew silent again. And this time it stayed. Sam was fast asleep when Steve arrived in Ullapool.
Which is true. Natasha knew where her friend could be heading. And why he was heading there in the first place. But didn’t want Bruce on this piece of information, as they had other problems to deal with. Like his eventual absence from the Avengers Compound.
He continually stayed on the slow but steady pace that he was on. Whilst also moving his hand from the side cushion, to Tony's thighs.
“Tony and Steve have always had this rocky type of relationship since before you guys joined. Argued, and fought like a damn old married couple. Yet that wasn’t the only weird thing to happen to them.” Nat continued, “Hell, there was this time that these two had a situation that eventually rode itself out. But I guess to them, it was still on their minds.”
The more he thought about it, the more he realized how Bruce & Tony were right. Steve's a prisoner here. Constantly being reminded of what he's lost over the years; who he's lost, and at what cost it had on him, and who he was.
Wanting to give more passion to an already sleazy situation, Steve broke his fast-paced rhythm, and dramatically slowed down to the soft thrusts from before. Whilst taking his hand away from Tony's member, and brought it to the brunette's face. Rubbing his skin so tenderly and beautifully. In turn, slowed down Tony's urge to climax, and rose the longevity of his moans.
Natasha looked to the other redhead, and gave a warm smile. A smile similar to Steve’s. Warming to the soul, soft enough just for you spill all your secrets out to them.
The two were dashing toward the massive building on their right, hoping any weapons were inside. And truthfully, their hiding spot would at least be now made out of stone, not twigs and leaves.
Sadly though, ever since Germany, things at the compound were just not the same. Shipments were still in progress, due dates were being met, and the building was still surprisingly active.
Kamala took this as a possible hint. She followed his gaze, but couldn't understand what he was looking at. It was just a bunch of Shield agents casually conversing with one another, along the sides of the war table. She took her gaze to the walkway.
But surprisingly, the agents below barely acknowledged the sound. Mostly because the energy blasts smacking the container deafened any outside noise.
"It's going good, Tony." Steve's eyes shot down to Tony's now mechanical right arm. The colors of red and yellow, shimmering in the sunlight.
Regardless, Steve knew that house was out of the question from the minute flooding was involved. Water damage is a nasty and expensive dilemma to have.
His inner thoughts were suffocating him. This was his true ultimatum. Albeit with an obvious answer.
Once he awoke, he asked ‘where were they?’. “We’re somewhere near Drumrunie. It’s close to Ullapool.” Steve speculated.
"Ms. Potts? Really?! Please, just call me Pepper." She said amusingly. Steve smiles again and proceeds to give her a hand shake.
She raced over to him and hugged him so tightly. She held on momentarily, before gently releasing her death grip on the man.
After his vision cleared, Tony thought back to his memory. He didn’t know why he asked that question to Steve. It never seemed like a possibility then. Mostly because Steve and Tony had just met, and he was in a relationship.
She took his wallet, and looked toward the driver with eyes of utter pain. "I want you to know, that I spoke to her, that day. I saw her face. That beautiful girl all covered in soot and pebbles, yet still radiating with innocence.” She conceded, “I could've been helping the guys lift the rock. I could've... but I didn't. I was sitting there, with her. Keeping her calm until she drew her last breath. And it has haunted me, but not just me; all of us, ever since.".
Steve surprisingly, didn't know how to process Tony's version of an ultimatum. Could he jeopardize their strong friendship for something more romantic? Something more intimate, more closer, more sensual?
He sat Tony's drink down near him and quietly walked back into the ship. Alone, and guilt-ridden by what he heard.
Alongside the agents were hundreds, if not thousands, of crates filled with their weapons. The purple hue barely illuminating their presence in these boxes.
And for last night, the group didn't want to risk heading out, as they had already traveled a good distance with the lead they were tipped on. For which, it lead to the decision to stay in and order some seafood.
Simultaneously, as Thor and Banner arrive onto the bridge, and sat adjacent to Steve. They had simple conversations amongst themselves, until finally Clint arrived. Tony still stood back, and just observed. Now that everyone arrived, Fury felt it was necessary to discuss their future plans with The Avengers.
But for Steve, it was honestly so much more. He wanted Tony to know that he forgave him. That he forgave him, for not forgiving himself.
It quieted between them, but before Kamala could think, it came out like word vomit. "I mean, I would be too if I was in your situation.".
Was it Kate? Bruce? Tony? It had to be them. They were the only ones in his line of sight. And he was trying to be careful about it. Looking up at them only in spurts. 'Aww, poor pining Steve Rogers!' She giggled. Catching the soldier's attention.
It dumbfounding the 'winged-soldier' even more with the memory of a few years back. Back at the Brooklyn Diner, when Steve was with him, Happy, and Tony. And he at least ate whatever he had ordered that night, regularly. No fork cutting etiquette of any sort.
Steve’s smile suddenly went a little somber. “I do feel a bit bad. We really didn’t need to steal his car.”.
Tony only smiled, and walked back over to the soldier. He grabbed the collar of his shirt, and extended it past the reactor. Not really caring that it's surely stretching the collar out.
Nat replied with a smug smile, and hit to the back. Tony returned the smug smile, and walked up to the hurting Captain.
Tony’s realization, Steve’s behavior, and Natasha’s desires, was the main thing to be explored in this chapter. Comment what you think I should explore next?
Steven Grant Rogers, the man who always strived to have a purpose in life. Whether that was fighting in war, building a family, protecting friends, or aiding those in need. The super-soldier always found a way to feel needed. But now, after all this time, he has...
"Look man, I want to know what you meant about what you said." He started, "Did you say that last part for him?".
"Well if it isn't Mr. Rogers from the neighborhood!" Tony quipped, while also giving Steve a long overdue hug.
Until recently. Like I before mentioned, their infatuation with each other only grew. Every simple little smile, laugh, or even cry that they had shared, only seemed to catapult their emotions.
"Of course, yes?! Clint, I know this looks bad, but I'm telling you now, it was just a mistake. Okay buddy, Steve knows it is too." Tony continued.
Steve's smile stayed, as the two men entered his car. He turned the key, and off they went. Till' Steve stopped abruptly, a little ways down West 44th st.
Steve pulled Tony's hand up to his lips and kissed it softly. Slowly, he let it go. "Well then, you now owe me a date.".
He sighed disappointingly, as he really wanted to try some of the drinks at the bar, before the rest of the Avengers arrived. But, he swallowed his misfortunes and the trio dismantled to the exit, with Steve following behind.
It honestly had seen better days. The table's chairs were either broken, or completely unusable. The actual table had lost one of its legs, so it sat with a weird angle. And his mother's chinaware were scattered in pieces, all along the dimly lit room. Any pictures that hung along the walls, were either hanging by a thread, or sat destroyed on the dust-covered floor.
However, a grin suddenly appeared on Steve's face, when he felt his nose hit the man's brown hair. Tony's explanation of it being, a nice little blend of a modern quiff style with a pompadour, to smooth the edges of the front. Oh, how Tony loved to seem stylish.
And it made the philanthropist hopeful for something more platonic with the soldier. Maybe, just maybe... he could call Cap, a genuine friend one day.
So, the four main bedrooms were given to whoever, besides the master's obviously going to Steve. Bucky wanted the room on the front-left side, but after one look at the creaky, leftover bed frame there. He politely declined and decided to sleep with Sam since his room had 2 beds that were at least in better condition than the one Bucky chose.
Yet it confused him, that she was staring right at the picture. As if she knew they or whoever was there ready to snap the picture.
A grin appeared on her face, and the young avenger took another deep breath in. Shot it back out, and focused on her reflection. She was going to be okay.
“Why?!” She croaked, “It’s not fair! This is the only toy anyone has ever given me. For me. I don’t want to let that go. Please… Steve. I can’t let that go.”.
He does remember laughing a lot, that's for sure. And then, it had turned serious all of a sudden. The brunette wishes he could remember more, but it's all a blur now.
“Obviously, when I’m not in a relationship. Because I swear, me and Pepper are always so back and forth. I do wonder why she still hangs around me.” He added.
It never occurred to the super-soldier of how many times he put himself in seriously dire situations. Truly, from what happened in Germany, Siberia, and now this?! And in those situations, would have to be saved in the process, or be used as a 'tie-breaker'. Steve was surely on his way to becoming a damsel in distress.
"I was going off of emotions. He was... spiraling out of control, and I thought that would calm him down." He whispered persistently.
Steve needed some type of purpose in his life again. He hadn't done much of anything since the compound scrimmage. Minus the few errands the soldier had done with Maria and Nick for a few months; cleaning up leftover messes from Hydra's involvement with SHIELD.
Resting on his elbows, Steve shivered a little while also clearing his throat in the process. He grabbed the glass of tap water next to his bed and took a small sip. The water soothing the typical scratchy throat that was annoying to the blonde. The dream, or really nightmare, fading away from memory.
Steve then realized how small he was compared to the hulk's size. Bruce's large green, forearms enveloping the soldier in a tight squeeze.
He then moved onto Sam. His shirt and pants looked tattered and dirty. Wings still attached to his torso as if they were part of him, as the arc reactor was to Tony. In this photo, Sam was wearing a cap, covered the backside of his wings with a backpack. What was in the backpack, Tony will never really know.
Before Steve could finish his explanation for why he needed him, Tony replied quickly with, "I'll be there around 11.".
"How long have you been in love with me, Tony?" Steve asked. The smile on his face was clearly an indicator that Steve may have already knew the answer.
The trio took this time to quickly think of a plan. Cap was not ready to face everyone just yet. So they thought of a plan to keep him stalled for a little bit. And Tony was designated to be the alibi.
It truly made the accord situation more painful for Tony, and Vision could see it. Truthfully, he found it unreal at the fact that Steve let this happen at all. If he would've just stayed neutral, this could've gone so much more peacefully.
Nat looked at him unconvinced, yet with caring eyes. She waited to see if he would respond, but he didn't.
Come to think of it, she never did her humming by the lake that much. Which is why she feels so blindsided at Tony’s weird behavior.
Speaking of said parents, one was currently rustling in his sleep. When suddenly, a loud noise was heard. It rattled the house a little, shaking any chinaware vigorously.
"I just had some sleep issues, you know the usual. And I thought I'd try to and do something to keep my mind off it.".
The first thing that both men noticed is how the tone of the landlord's voice seemed when Steve had said that he was interested. His tone seemed nervous but also relieved as well. This made Steve feel a little nervous himself as most of the landlords he's talked to have never had this type of tone. And the soldier has damn near lost count at how many owners he's spoken to. Nevertheless, he agreed to come out there in the hour.
"Okay, no need to go down memory lane." The philanthropist quickly threw out, "Let's continue... this.".
Steve thanked the woman, and he headed back into the office. It was small, little, thing. A chair, a desk with all sorts of paperwork atop it. There was a filing cabinet in the corner, with some of the drawers irresponsibly left open. And next to it was the phone, hanging innocently and calmly.
"I know we don't want to, but... we... need to keep, going. F-For her, at least." Steve said heroically, yet his tone was still somberly.
"You alright Cap?" Tony asked. He had noticed a soft tear slide down Steve's face. Steve felt it go, and honestly didn't care. He felt angry, at himself mostly. 'Why didn't we try and help?' Steve thought sadly. Steve must've shown it, as Tony just suddenly grabbed the forearm of his suit. He knew Steve was beating himself up for their inability to help clean up, and Tony wasn't having it.
Steve smiled still. He caught onto what he said rather quickly. And honestly, he felt a little flattered that a man said he reminded him of his girlfriend. Although, Steve knew that what happened should only be a one time occurrence. For his sake, and Tony's. And honestly for Pepper as well. He knew he had to think of a way to fix this. Of course his response was anything but helpful.
But all the other times, it seemed as if he was standoff-ish. Pepper usually thought it was because, of Morgan. And that Tony would try and spend almost every waking minute with his daughter. Making it his new life mission to give the girl, the life he never had.
Steve barely made it to the toilet before last night's food came hurdling from his stomach. The utter retching sound he made, was disgusting, to say the least. But vomiting wasn't the only thing corrupting his body at this moment.
Tony just gives him a brushing off motion. Thor really didn't want to pry, but I guess it's in his nature. "May, I ask what happened to your mother and father?"
Besides the high standards, his parenting skills weren't anything but a low average. Constantly leaving on business trips, never taking an actual interest in his only son's life, and urged his son to become the new CEO of a company that drove his father to alcoholism. But for the cherry on top, he'd never physically told his son that he loved him, or even liked for that matter.
But these last 15 minutes had Steve lost in his mind once again. He thought about several things. Several events in his life. People he’s touched, hurt, or be-friended. Yet one remained the most persistent.
Home. He wants to go home. But he's wanted so many homes in his life that it left him baffled. Where was... home? What was... home? Who was... home?
Wanda continually looked from her food and up to Vision. She smiled but it wasn't warm at all. It was hesitant, cautious, maybe even a bit of commiseration. Never the less, she couldn't lie to herself.
Steve smirked, then taking a random stool and sat in front of the group. "Alright, Here we go. This story was told to me by my Ma when I was young.".
Steve was placing small kisses on Tony's neck, as he just looked to the ceiling above. The ceilings were made of a metallic substance that gave them a reflective texture. Tony could see the entirety of Steve's backside. Viewing their entangled bodies as a work of art.
Even though, Tony and Steve's impression of each other was a pretty rough one. The one thing these two ever agreed on, was that the world needs some protection, and they are all they have. However, the same end in mind, doesn't mean the path the duo take isn't the same. Regardless, times we're looking alright for what they were.
The parents themselves were deep in their dreams. Having been up the night prior with the children playing hide and seek. With one of the kids, the daughter, trying to hide near the dock by the river.
Some more agents of Shield arrived, as the small get together/reunion was now in motion. Happy and Sam would arrive at 8:00, being fashionably late as always. Yet there was a certain philanthropist, and Spangly Tights missing. Everyone knew Rogers's and Stark's return to the Avengers would be an eventful one. Of course, Nat, Fury, Maria and Clint were the only ones who knew of the duo's miscellaneous act, yet all the rest of them were just simply waiting. But still no sign of Tony Stark or Steve Rogers. Nat was starting to get a little worried. More so towards Steve, as Tony was always the one to have an exaggerated, dramatic, entrance.
2.5 bedrooms, 2 bath, 1,500 sq ft. in total, and it even had a swimming pool! Neighbors were a few feet away on either side, and the mortgage seemed affordable enough, for Steve at least. Truthfully, the super-soldier was excited to see it even if he hadn't heard the necessities.
"You, going to say something? See! Now I am trying to get you speak?!" Tony laughed. Steve laughed in unison and finally walked up to the philanthropist.
"I know the feeling." He replied. Back at Shawarma's, the rubbing back incident. Tony did the gesture as if they were best friends. They obviously weren't. More leaning towards acquaintances, who had some very interesting arguments just a few hours earlier. But like Pepper and everyone else, who simply just brushed it off, as some coping mechanism to avoid the fact that he literally just almost died. Steve felt obligated to figure it out. 'No soldier left behind.' He thought.
Nat noticed Steve's admiring glances. Luckily, Pepper wasn't noticing. She was discussing with Fury about the facilities. She made a quick scrap of her chair and Steve's eyes darted toward her, albeit, Tony's, Clint's, Banner's, and Hill's as well.
"Come on, we should see who needs help." Nat intervened. At this point, she knew Tony and Steve were good for each other, but the constant eye-fucking between the two, was a bit irritating. She wasn't against it, but they had pressing matters to attend two.
"Come on Steve. I was just playin around." He began, "You can't tell me no one has ever played rough with you?".
Steve lifted his middle finger in response, with an exaggerated gasp, from Sam and Nat, following that.
He felt the tears begin to flow, but still held a majority of them back. The super soldier was done. And honestly, so was Tony.
A loud noise from the house awoke Steve from his daydreaming and he rushed back onto the porch. Knocking again, this time on the screen door, Steve once again was waiting for the philanthropist to appear. His wristwatch showing 8:25 now.
No one immediately answered, as the soldier devoured his food as if he hadn't eaten in days. They all looked to him, mildly worried. Sam was more confused than he was worried. He's been with Steve all this time. And he's ate moderately from he can remember. So then, what the hell happened?
“But then again, their little altercation probably had some more drama to it then most people know.” She stated vaguely.
The two stayed like that for a while, until Kamala had burst through the door. Tears in her eyes, and a pained expression. "Oh my god, You're Alive!".
Both killed under Steve's leadership. Both who wanted to come back from this. Yet, sacrificed everything for everyone else.
"How What? Come on Steve, you have to speak to me." Tony once again took his hand to the soldier's face. His cheeks were wet and hot.
Natasha scooted herself over. She took his hand and held it tightly. "You didn't abandon us, Tony. You had your demons, and couldn't shake them. Steve wouldn’t have hated you. He’s still beating himself up over it.".
Steve let a snicker follow, and answered sarcastically sequential. "1, I came to talk to you. 2, Pepper. And 3, No.".
Whatever it was, Tony still said it. And he tried to talk his way out of it. But it still occurred. And yet, the philanthropist still wonders. Wonders on how life would be if Pepper and he did break up, before the accords, and he was alone all that time during his paranoia stages.
But the side effect to this, was that they would have to leave, almost immediately, once the threat was diminished. No recognition, no praise, no restoring homes, or really anything else left in the destruction.
Steve looked to his feet. Questioning the decision, over and over again. "I... I don't know guys. I'm incredibly grateful that you've come all this way to help me out. But I still want to be where the fight needs me. Just not as Captain America anymore."
Yes, they're married now and have a kid. But Tony's independent issues were still apparent. They never really went away. Pepper thought with their marriage; that it could bring down the high and mighty independence shtick.
Steve had noticed another door leading outside on the back wall of the house. "Where's this lead to?" He asked politely.
Mostly because, of what happened on Halloween last year. Tony woke up before the chickens cock-a-doodle-doo in the morning. He snuck under the bed, and attempted to shake it violently. I say attempt, as it wasn't violent enough to wake her. So he simply pushed the mattress of the bedframe.
The young man brushed it off with a chuckle. But the trio were not laughing. In fact, Clint felt an 'Oh Shit' leave his lips as they left the diner. If some random people at a diner could see their promiscuous behavior, what does that mean for them? But most importantly, what does that mean for Pepper and Tony?
Steve awkwardly smiles, and kindly returns the gesture back. A very odd situation indeed. He knew Tony was a touchy person, but not to this extent. I mean sure, he did grab Steve's shoulder earlier during their argument. But this was a bit more of a strange gesture of a man, who is in a relationship.
Speaking of the basement, Steve's only been down there a few times in the year he's been here. The place just gives him the willies, that, and the attic. They both just have an energy to them that just isn't inviting. So the soldier doesn't allow anyone in these rooms. Fearing that something bad could happen to them. He wasn't superstitious about a lot of things, but there was just something
Tony eventually noticed that he had stopped. Yet seeing Steve's concerned look made himself smile in amusement. He brought his hand to the super soldier's cheek again and nodded to continue.
Suddenly, as Steve looked back to Tony, something about being this close to Tony was giving the super-soldier straight deja-vu. The realization of why he's been feeling the way he has, hitting him, as Tony kept his gaze on Steve. Except instead of seeing the empathetic look of a friend, he was being reminded of the betrayed, heartbreaking look that Tony gave him in Siberia. God, he was never going to get over this.
Once the laughing subsided, the two just looked to the party-goers. It was a strange feeling to see everyone seem so happy. No worries, or issues to deal with. Their lives just always seemed so full of responsibilities and accountability, that they never got to enjoy moments like this. It brings Tony back to a conversation that he had with Steve, before the events of A-day.
The escalation, occurring a few yards from the Ex-Avengers, was in fact, their lead with Hydra. So the trio dispersed and quietly approached the ongoing riot. Natasha scurried through the crowds, and stopped abruptly once she noticed the two men standing before her. One with an eye missing, and the other with a beard similar to Steve's. Holding the weapons that Sam was right about.
The next day, they stumbled on it, purely, by accident. Tony took over the wheel after the last pit-stop at a gas station. And while the two were deep in conversation, mostly about the world's new state of chaos, the blonde had realized that they were going down the wrong road.
Tony then, put his hand on Steve's waist and began rubbing it. He croaked out the word, "Okay...", and timidly smiled. His entire face now was pink, with his eyes now puffy of salty tears.
He really wanted just to apologize, buy her a stuffed bear, again; kiss her till no ends meet; but here he was a week later. No bear, no apologies, and no kisses. Simply following Pepper’s wishes to keep their distance.
After their agreement, Tony and Steve drove around for a little while. Even passing the taxi that Natasha, Clint, and Maria were in. Yet something was odd about the direction they were going. Steve wasn't going upstate, he was heading out of state. Tony looked to his companion, and noticed the utter determination, that he was surely showing, to leave Manhattan.
"Don't worry, I'll be fine." Steve gave his lover another long kiss, before dropping on the other side of the bed.
Also, it didn't help that a third of them were women and a quarter were men. So that in itself gave a whole slew of issues that required a lot of trusting and knowledge. It certainly didn't help the bathroom situation, he'll tell you that.
Captain Marvel, who was a surprising new addition to the team, was the woman who brought Tony Stark back to Earth. So the Avengers thanked her profusely.
Sam and Happy waved goodbye and headed to the tower. Snickering like two kids leaving their parents house to a big-boy party.
And with his comment, Tony felt himself snap, "Fine! You know what I want you to do?! Go ahead, screw me! Since apparently 'therapy' is no longer an option!".
Nothing. He was breathing, Steve was sure about that. The soldier slightly patted the man’s cheek to get a reaction. “Sam! Come on, Sam... Hello?!” He urged.
A few minutes would pass, as he would feel a yawn coming. And when it did, it felt exhilarating. He was honestly so done with this day. Spinning on his feet, he closed the monitor, and left the lab. Leaving all to be discussed, in the morning.
But before Steve could question her again, a car pulled up to the shop. Now it was Sam who smirked, except his was more mischievous.
"Alright, Dr. Phil. Can we get back to reality now?" Fury honestly didn't care what was going on between the two superheroes.
The soldier sighed once more. He was done fighting for the moment, that much was true. Yet, Steve just wanted to feel needed again, even if that wasn't on a big scale.
Sam and her lifted the soldier and quickly ran to the doors. Meanwhile, the energy blasts now began to rip the building apart. Pulling down metal supports, and breaking the left catwalk. Sending those agents, to their untimely demise.
Tony looked to the ‘Spider-Man’ and instantly felt pity for the boy. He knew that Peter was intrigued. Maybe a little too intrigued, but still, he was a kid. A kid who just learned two of his biggest idols, are now enemies, and basically tried to almost kill each other in blinded rages.
"Aye, aye, Captain." The girls smiled and then ran to the back door. Disappearing from Steve's viewpoint.
“No judgment here. But if you’re that smitten then why don’t you… you know… shoot your shot?” Bucky smirked mischievously, “I mean I’d hurry up. ‘Cause I’m pretty sure you only have a few good years left in ya’ Steve—”.
“This was the actual reason. You, Vision, Steve, and Sam are all I have left right now. I don’t have much of a story to look back upon. But I at least-or did, have one to look forward too.” Natasha croaked.
Tony had Morgan in his arms, as he came down the stairs. “You okay?” He asked noticing his wife’s constant staring off.
"Seriously! We've faced worse situations than this. Like, why can't we think of a good plan." He stated while frustratingly shoving some fries in his mouth.
Bruce gave him an unimpressed look. Him, being in hulk form adding to the intimidation of the expression. "Good? Come on, Steve. I mean, I know you guys weren't on the best of terms when I was gone, but that can't be all.".
Kamala notices Tony's amused smile when he notices Steve's position. She silently snickers to herself. "You two love to stand next to each other."
That's who his home was. Someone that made Steve Rogers, see, and experience, life in such a strange, yet epic way.
Wanted to add this early, because I’m nice! Hope you guys are enjoying the story! And yes, I changed the title of the story, as well as some tags. Don’t forget to leave a kudos! Stay Safe!
Whatever the situation was, Steve didn't want to think about it too much. His eyelids began to feel heavy and started to droop.
"Sorry Tony, your sarcastic remarks aren't going to get a rise out of me tonight." He stated amusingly.
And sadly, they resurfacing. These ones not as bad, but Tony would still wake up slightly crying. And Pepper knew that had to've been about, that day.
And with the team's luck, more agents began coming into the room from the catwalks. Their footsteps cascading down the steps with quick agility.
Through all this though, she just smiled and looked to her son with delight. She was proud of the boy-Man, he had became. Her envious feelings were starting to cloud her for a moment, till the young man finally had spoke.
"Come on Kamala, I told you that you could call me, Steve." He gave her a warm smile, "I never cared for formalities being said by friends."
The trio would not tell them of their encounter in the taxi. Mostly because it was still too painful. But for Nat’s reasoning, she could see something different between Tony and Steve. They no longer seemed awkward around each other, more or so, calm and comfortable.
The Avengers are broken. Any inch of government involvement would have her back in prison, or maybe worse.
"Well, nice to meet you Happy. They call me Captain America. And I really hope there isn't any danger. 'Cause I know a few ways to handle it." Steve added, whilst breaking out his own tough guy tone. Which of course was completely believable.
Honestly, it was like this with all the kids he’s recruited over that period. But they all grew to love Steve. And knew when it came to playtime or any recreational activity. They knew the rules: No playing at night, No talking to strangers, and No playing by the river.
Nat eventually tried to throw some of her own promiscuous innuendos to relive said awkwardness. But it wasn't enough to tame it. They sadly weren’t as strong as the other twos. Clint and Maria would, again, laugh along to them but the driver just stayed silent. Something was seriously off with him. He strangely seemed okay in the beginning of the ride, but now his demeanor grew cold and distant. 'Bi-polar maybe? No that's jumping to conclusions. Maybe he's just going through some shit?' Clint thought. He felt a little concerned. So to break the ice, he took a leap of faith.
He chuckled and gave her a soft kiss. He then, laid his hand on her stomach and rubbed it softly. Even though it would be a hassle, he did want a 3rd kid. She did too, but they both never gotten around to discuss it yet.
"I know my words don't mean much, but-I know that Nat and Clint are truly sorry for what happened to your daughter. But they saved millions of lives that day. And if it wasn't for them going back, unauthorized I mind you. Your daughter would've died alone. And I couldn't imagine how that feels for someone so young.".
He smiled at the sleeping man, before placing his book back onto his nightstand and turning out the light. He was facing Tony when he finally fell asleep.
If Past-Steve could move his freakin' head out of the way, that would be lovely. But Past-Steve was too busy kissing the brunette's lips. Constantly heading back up for air, only to gently place his lips back onto Tony's.
'But it's done now. I'm here now. I have... this!' She insistently thought. She ringed her fingers over and over, again until it began to become uncomfortable. She needed to clear her head, and so she fast walked out of her stateroom and out onto the ship's massive landing deck. It felt nice to be outside again. Being cramped up in the ship while airborne, is too much of a annoyance. She relinquished in the sun's rays and the warmth. Her dying action just to run around and spin like hippie in the sunset was surely growing. But her plan was cutoff from a hand on her shoulder. It was Tony.
The sunlight, of the crisp, cold morning, poured itself drearily into Captain America's quarters. Shining rays of pink, glimmering against the metallic/cloth-like surfaces of Steve's armor. Sitting quietly in its glass container.
"I gotta head back to the compound. Natasha's usually there by herself, and looks forward to our visits.".
Tony tried to speak, but all that came out was gibberish moaning, wrapped in a constant state of desire. Which, was ecstasy to the super-soldier.
He smiles to himself, as he glides along the banister and up the other flight of stairs to the third floor. Only three rooms were on this floor. The playroom on the right, the bathroom in the middle, and the storage area on the left. Tony even chuckles a little at the thought of him and Steve almost getting 'caught' in said bathroom, during a get-together with some neighbors from around the area.
That got Steve to actually chuckle. He never cared for Ziggy's sense of humor. But in the last few months, it's grown on him. It honestly reminded him of someone else's humor.
Once everything was situated, for the time being, Tony ordered the guys some pizza. The men conversed with each other for the remainder of the evening.
He had awoken that morning to hear screaming outside. It was Jenny. Steve rushed outside and couldn’t find the source of Jenny’s screams.
Steve didn't mean to interrupt, but he knew the kid was going to keep repeating himself if he hadn't. "I'm looking for some roommates. It's—uh—getting a little lonely in that big old house of mine.".
Pepper, who witnessed the events of New York from her commercial flight, was worried sick. She stayed in constant contact with Fury afterward. Once her plane landed in a still operating airport, she eventually knew of her boyfriend's whereabouts, and found him. She then gathered her things, and up she went with Shield on their carrier. Tony and the team however, wouldn't be on the ship till afternoon.
Steve sat quietly. Here they were again, in an awkward situation. With Tony starting to lose it, and Steve having to figure his shit out.
As his eyes looked back to the philanthropist, he could see Tony’s composure start to deflate. Which was a very rare occurrence.
His hand slid down the warm, chiseled stomach. Eventually looking upward, only to see the tip of his husband's chin. Scruffy looking, and sharp.
The blonde moderately got dressed, and left her room. However, her usual first thing that she does almost every day, is to check on Morgan. Call it paranoia, mother's worry, or overprotectiveness. Pepper has seen far too much evil in the world to be anything but the aforementioned list.
There were 3 people of interest, all standing together coincidentally: Bruce, Kate, and Tony. From what she could see, Bruce and Kate were in full conversation, while Tony just listened quietly from the side.
Finally, after a minute of desperately fighting Tony off, they connected forcefully. Steve stopped completely once it occurred. He could feel Tony's heartbeat and his breathing start to slow, as their kiss morphed.
He could see the pain on Mr. Stark’s face. Sure he knew that Mr. Stark and Captain America were friends, and that there falling out was rough. But like... not to this extent. Peter looked down to his feet, hoping that the conversation would kick back up, but it didn't.
The duo just dashed near the lit building. Steve making it to the front door first. Sam was just a few feet behind the super-soldier when he stumbled into the store. Steve was already talking to the woman behind the counter, who looked utterly annoyed at the fact that she was having to do her job.
Tony dropped his smile. Seeing Steve look this upset and hurt brought back the memories of himself. Those heartbreakingly raw nights were Tony questioned every decision he made that day. But it raised another question, what was Steve talking about? All he remembers was being hit by an energy blast.
The room situation, also unsurprisingly, didn't take much coaxing to it. It honestly came down to who knew who the best. And who was lucky enough to get the sofa downstairs. That lucky person turned out to be a volunteering Clint, who didn't want to fight over rooms.
He sighed and walked over to the now-empty dining table. The children scurrying back to the playroom upstairs. He picked up the plates and set them gently in the sink. "Just know that I appreciate you so much." He expressed quietly, whilst looking outside once more.
Tony stayed at the window, momentarily, before eventually leaving it. Mainly, to head downstairs to his workshop. Or what normal people called it: The Basement.
"Yea, not his babysitter. But I'd have to say a long time." She says bluntly and gives him a more firm smile.
Steve looked to the brunette, shockingly. He's never been 'played around with' before, so this was something new to him. And strange as well, but being with Tony, what else is new?
First looking into the kitchen, Tony was nowhere in sight. Yet a shuffling noise and a scream of pain/embarrassment from another room, made Steve chuckle.
Tony felt almost uncomfortable about the whole situation. He grew nervous, at the utter thought that he was being shown Captain America's birthplace, by Captain America himself. His feelings started to range from weird to unexpected. But mostly, he felt unworthy of such a trip. 'Why is he really doing this? For closure purposes? And if so, what for?' He thought confusingly.
The words slipped from his lips like word vomit. Steve even couldn't believe he said it. The two just stood, opposite of each other, wordless.
It was brushed off or really ignored, as that didn't matter to the family. Their children were happy, and that's all the parents ever cared about.
He was breathing so that gave the blonde some comfort. The longer Steve looked, he confirmed that there was nothing to suggest for Tony to be in a state of indisposition or stress.
Once the two ladies sat down, Natasha wasted no time in getting down to business. Her posture straightened, hands were held together in front of her, and face that read: important info about to be discussed.
The two did not awake once Pepper and Morgan came home. She didn't know what to expect when walking through that door. Yet entering the quiet home, she gave a sigh of relief. No exposed husband in sight.
Yes, you read that right. Pepper had met Steve and Natasha earlier that morning, in town. They had bumped into her, after Natasha and Steve were helping this one old couple, grocery shop. Another story for another day.
Steve could tell he was not taking this well. Not that he didn't find this a bit funny, he was just worried of Tony's mental state, and what others would think, mostly Pepper.
Tony felt his heart sink. He didn't think Steve would bring their situation up so quickly. And he also, actually didn't want to forget it. Why would he? It felt exhilarating, and yes comforting. For the first time, Tony was accepting what happened, as a positive memory. Rather than a mistake that should be left back in the past.
Vision flustered his responses, but eventually gave up altogether. He came into the kitchen and stood opposite of Wanda.
But before Steve could get a word out, the man twitched, almost convulsed even. His arms grabbing the edges of the table, with a black, fog-like substance emitting from its person. The being itself becoming larger in height and size, with every passing second. Steve sat in utter shock and fear.
Tina looked to Annie, her eyes fury with rage. She held her hand out, waiting for Annie to give her the doll back.
And for the most part, it was fun. Each Avenger seemed to like the other more and more, as time went on. Most people believed that they were just working pals, that only came around when the world needed saving. But it was so much more than that. They were all good friends. But like a ‘boy band’ they dismantled, and haven’t spoken to each other. It really sent an ache to Tony’s already fragile heart.
Various rooms filled with crates, cobwebs, food wrappings, and the invading presence of the gun blasts. Smashing the glass windows, and sending strobes of energy to wreck anything in its path.
“Can you just do it! Please! I have something to tell you, that you’ll need to be here face to face with me.”.
Ziggy's older sister, Cindy Burman, was a brunette with ambitions, dreams, and was strong-headed. Had a desire to make her & her sister's life something more. A life where the two could live happily with no worries at all. The siblings kept in contact with each other when Cindy had moved out. But the older sibling didn't have the financial resources, or even room, for Ziggy to come and stay with her, and her boyfriend. So the orange-haired teen was forced to move away. Leaving any trace of a family behind.
"Uh-he-he, how... do you feel," he began, "about... moving away.". The crease was now sharper than ever.
But when they had separated, Tony could see Steve's eyes still burning with passion. "Okay then. I'll stay."
Sarah Rogers always had her life together. Always had her payments on time. Kept a job, and made sure she did it to the best of her ability. And raised her continuously sick son, with grace and strength.
To which, Steve didn't mind the amount of people knowing anyhow. As it made days like today, when he needed help with the actual move, a lot more easier.
"Steve," Tony sighed, "I'm okay... really. It's just... full on my end. And this... will go away. Plus... you'd never... hurt me."
Steve of course apologized for his odd behavior, before the two gave the goodbye pleasantries. Annalise did try to persuade the soldier just for another walkthrough, yet the super-soldier declined it again politely. And the duo were back on the road, this time heading to Virginia.
An absolute lifetime of service for the greater good, and that's not even mentioning his time in World War 2. You'd think that he, the man out of time, would be able to find some sense of a domestic life when all was said and done. A purpose.
Looking toward some of the restaurants, Natasha could see some other civilians, enjoying a night out on the town. She pointed out to them, getting the attention of Clint and Maria as well. The taxi driver however, next to Maria, just sat quietly with the biggest R.B.F in history. It actually made her feel a bit uncomfortable sitting next to him.
Steve started his search for the missing blonde, but was completely overtaken by the sheer beauty of the landscape. He was used to tall buildings, and scruffy alleyways. 'No, come on Rogers. Find Pepper first, look at scenic backyard later!' He thought. Taking one look around, he instantly spotted her.
"Good Morning to you, Tony." Steve leaned further, now placing a soft kiss on the brunette's lips. Hoping to ease the tension as well.
"Steve... I may have met you, and Tony, almost a year ago now. But it surprises me that this hasn't happened yet!" She gave him a comforting smile while placing her hands on his elbows, "Now, go ask him to dance. Or I'll ask him for you.".
Now that Thanos & his army had been dusted, and everything with the accords situation had sorted itself out. Sorted itself out meaning that Tony had persuaded the remaining senators to discontinue the Accords after the blip.
"Tony... why? Why would you do that?!" Steve interrupted. His eyes dark, puffy, and seething with rage.
"What? What are you talking about, Steve?! The blast hit me directly." Tony could see the super-soldier take a deep breath.
However his hopes were realized as they eventually stumbled upon civilization once they crossed 3rd Avenue. But it was honestly, what was left. It broke all there hearts. Men, Women, and children giving off the impression of normality, but are utter broken inside. Bruce even noticed a couple kids stealing some hot dogs. They looked rather skinny, so their misguidances were probably before Loki. But it still was upsetting to see.
It wasn't anything awkward between the two. They knew of each other's fascination and infatuation with one another. So during situations like this, they just went with it. Especially since they were on the run.
Even though she understood his duty, she was always the one to pick up the pieces after his or the Avengers takedowns. With Sokovia being the straw that broke the camels back.
But this was probably his worst royal screw up. He knew that it was futile in trying to stop those trucks at the farmers market. That it was too easy, and efficient, in their escape from the shelter.
Steve thought this house was big before stepping inside. Now he believes the house is a hotel in disguise. Never, has he had something this huge. He even remembers coming into Avengers Tower for the first time and being utter dumbfounded at the sheer size of the building.
Oh, how Steve missed Tony’s snarky remarks and quips. It was the one thing that he, and the rest of the Avengers, now miss more than anything else. But they wouldn’t tell him that now, or he would have a field day with it.
Steve began to breathe heavily now. Now, it was his turn, to lose his train of thought, as well. He never got to the level Tony was at, as his admiration of this situation was just the sight of the 'iron man'. Tony's had many lovers, and yet he has one incident with Captain America-No, Steve Rogers, and yet looks utterly obliterated with sensuality.
But it also dumbfounded the being. The act of loving another was one of the many feelings that certainly was not programmed into him. Because why would he need it? His mission was to save humanity, even if he was created by a killer robot.
Natasha was the more persistent of them calling. While Steve, Bruce, Thor, and whoever else, we’re strangely not as verbal.
Steve completely missed the question. He was still looking at the philanthropist and trying to spot the differences. Which was stupid on his part, since he could barely see anything. The only illumination coming from the lights in the kitchen.
Suddenly, a loud crash was heard in the distance. It came from Steve's quarters. And that terrified Tony even more. All sorts of worse case scenarios began to fill his head. He rushed over to Steve's door and was about to knock before the door opened.
He was near inches from the front door. Well, the screen door before the actual main door-You get my point?! His hand had turned into the signature 'knocking on door' formation.
Tony noticed his departure and suddenly ran to him. He ran outside the house, and toward their cars.
Looking into the brunette's eyes, he could see them start to glisten. Along with viewing his face becoming a shade of pink. The soldier felt immediately regretful, in that he already completely ruined the experience.
Judging by certain clues on the board, and his own mindset right now, it finally gave Tony the confirmation that he needed. All the recent photos, so easily taken as if they deliberately stood in front of the photographer. Maybe, they did want Tony to see them, but only him.
"Steve... you need to stop blaming yourself. Yes, we struggled, and we suffered. But I mean who doesn't!" Tony attested.
However, the early days of them all living together were not as calm as they were now. Steve's first kid was Christine Burman, or Ziggy, as she liked to be called. She was actually from Ohio but was moved to a shelter in New York when she and her mother had lost their house to the bank.
He still never really forgave her for it, but was willing to put it behind him. And truly, it was becoming more and more apparent that it might come true. Maybe it wasn't meaning that all the Avengers didn't die at once, but over time.
"You knew it was coming. Only you, the great, and now retired, Captain America, to go and live in the sticks, for some good olé fashion American fun!".
"Hmph? Oh, yes! Everything is fine. I just set an alarm to head outside." Steve answered calmly, "If only driveways could shovel themselves.".
She then laid her other hand, after wiping some embarrassing tears, on top of Wanda’s as a confirmation that it worked.
But in all honesty, Natasha was already completely shell-shocked at that point. Even Steve Rogers couldn't comprehend or even think about any solutions. They had lost. And what a loss that came with it.
But beyond that, Steve just did nothing. Mainly at Nick's expanse for the world to believe that the old Captain America was retired. Which, drove the blonde crazy with anger.
Once his clothes were off; leaving on his underwear for obvious reasons. The super-soldier got into bed and pulled a book out from his nightstand.
Natasha Romanov, a spy to some, a deadly agent to others, a simple gal to two, and a good friend to one, Steve Rogers.
The young woman sitting opposite him, threw her fangirl expressions away, and looked to the group a bit confused. She licked her lips, but was hesitant to speak about it. Thankfully, she eventually did as their patience was completely gone.
To be more handsy with 'manly' tasks. He wanted to go outside and chop wood, make some modifications to their speedboat, fix up the greenhouse, add some insulation to the third floor. Tony just believed a relationship was like an even playing field. He wanted to be 'the man of the house' just as much as he spent time with the kids.
Feeling this close again, brought back all those feelings and emotions. It hit them both like a freight train. All the rawness of their first kiss, their first battle in New York, their altercation in Siberia. It all flooded their minds. The heat of the argument was slowly but surely evaporating away from them.
“Oh! God no! They just slopped some pity kisses on each other one night. And then they acted like straight idiots for those following days. I swear if you could’ve seen how they looked at each other. You and the entire country would’ve thought they were fucking.” Wanda spat her drink back into the cup; not realizing that Natasha had already ordered their drinks.
Once the team hug ended, they headed into the stolen car. Natasha plugged in the coordinates Stark sent her, and off they headed.
There was a play, being held at some theatre, somewhere outside of Fairburn, and Pepper thought it would be a good idea to let Morgan go see it. Trying to make it seem, to her and herself, that the world hadn't wasted away after Thanos.
The two laughed once again and continued their dance. The rest of the guests just continued with their night. Leaving this to be the hot gossip for the following morning.
She quietly walked into her room and saw the little Stark asleep still. Morgan was laying on her side. Her hair covering her face, and her mouth slightly doing some butterflies, as she was a mouth breather. 'Just like her father!' She thought. Pepper smiled, kissed her forehead, and softly tiptoed back to the door.
"You know what I mean. There's no way that you not liking a house would bring down your whole mood. You're in your head, and you're most likely beating yourself up over something.".
Pepper noticed him and yet continually looked to the woods surrounding them. Steve tried to analyze her reaction, but ignored it once he sat next to her.
She smiled at his lame response, but didn't realize the man's hands were still free. He grabbed her and tossed her over the rail.
Therefore, for the next few months, the soldier decided that any room with a piece of furniture that wasn’t his or just recently bought would just be left alone for the time being. Till' he could at least figure out what to do with 5 beds, a freakin chalkboard, and a rocking chair; of all things. Maybe Steve could finally give in to his old age and actually use the chair. He was 105 after all.
That revelation made his skin crawl. The vision was coming true. But it didn't mean that he was going to let it.
Thor would head back to Asgard, to deal with some family matters, while Hulk would be M.I.A., during all these events. Leaving Nat in a continuous state of worry.
"They're heading to Ullapool to ship the rest of the weapons." Steve couldn't believe what he was configuring. He actually, timidly, smiled with some pride. ‘I’ll have to thank Nat, for those lessons in learning Russian!’ He thought.
The family had also used that time to hang up some leftover Christmas decorations. Much to the children's amusement. Even though, it may have been mid-December. "A little late to be getting ready for festivities," One of them expressed.
Tony began to get up, until he felt a hand hit his arm. It was drowsy action done by Steve who simply situated his body to a more comfortable state. He picked Steve's arm and placed it softly onto his chest. This of course woke Steve slightly. With his dreary eyes, he could make out Tony's face of literal 'Oh Shit'.
He runs out the nearby door and looks around. On his right was the path back to the house, nothing at all. In front of him was the greenhouse, and on his left was the dock leading out to the river. He could hear the whines from over there.
The father however, stared into her soul, hoping her words were lies. That she was making it up, in order for his hatred for the Avengers to stay. He wanted to hate them so much. He wanted to blame them. She had to be lying. But, her eyes weren't, they were truer than ever. His expression finally changed, and the driver finally had released some leftover tears. The glares subsided quickly as they realized there were other people in the car.
Both men awkwardly tapped their hands on the counter, and cleared their throats. Tony instantly got up, grabbed a bottle from behind the bar. And poured his ‘Rusty Nail’ into a small glass. Before sitting back next to Steve.
Question after question, began to fill the two minds'. And each one, feeling more like a gut punch, than a sigh of relief.
However, when Tony saw Steve again, that following year. It was as if their night together, had never even happened. The resentment towards the soldier, right back where it was, 4 years ago.
"We did... we... Kis-Kissed, and it... was..." Tony stuttered, "It was..." He pondered off. His mind was a complete mess right now. He couldn't make words turn into sentences. He couldn't make letters into words. Tony just looked to the floor, and held his hands behind his back.
'It could go wrong? What if I mess everything up? What if I don't?' Steve stood upon the porch, that once belonged to an egotistical philanthropist, puzzled and in-thought. Yet, now that mahogany colored porch and it’s beautiful home we’re owned by his wife and offspring. ‘Pepper and Morgan‘ he continually thought. Oh god, he didn't even think about them?!
The blonde looked back to the trio and softly smiled. "Sorry." He giggled, "Yes, Alright, I'll do it. It'll finally give me something to do.".
With that statement playing in his head over and over again. He needed to talk to her. If not for last night, than for their discussion from before.
The brunette reaches the third floor and leans on the doorframe leading into the messy playroom. Where, his husband was currently giving raspberries to Maria, while James was atop him pretending to wrestle the soldier. It was all just a terribly domestic scene. On one hand, Tony was soaking it all up, on the other, he was feeling a little envious.
"That's why I said yes to you. The fact that you were willing to dance with me, and you couldn't even dance yourself." Tony chuckled, "Shows that, this means something to you."
As she reached the doorframe, she noticed the window wide open, and the sound of metal clacking outside of it. The man stupidly took the fire escape, up to the rooftop. Nat actually smugly smiled, and crawled through the window. She noticed that he was a few flights up, and so she flew up each stairway.
The fireplace that sat proudly on the adjacent wall, gave Steve flashes to the wintertime and setting logs into the roaring fire.
"Sorry, I just... I was just... just so done with everyone trying to comfort me and it not showing. You know? Yet, for someone weird reason, Steve waltz in. And there I am spilling my guts out to him, and then... kiss-ing him like a school girl who just got a damn compliment about her purse." He babbled, "And here I go again spilling myself out to you now?! I mean Christ, are you two working with Loki? Do you two have some mind bending trick, to get me to open up?".
That last sentence made Steve feel bitterly awful, and cold. ‘We’re good.’ As in, no longer good. Probably so far from good, that it’s just plain bad. It was almost like a photo projector in Steve’s head. Sending flash images of his and Tony’s adventures together.
A few more sparks, but still nothing. The man was closer to the car. His shouting getting angrier. Sam’s yelling getting more agitated.
Back up on the bridge, Fury would hear the annoying A.I. System announce that one of their jets was compromised. He was about to tell one of the agents to fire up some fighter pilots, until the A.I. informed them that it was gone. And just like that The Avengers were off.
That sound, that god awful sound, was straight misery for Tony. It's repetitive, monotonous, and tedious, style of sound drove the philanthropist crazy with annoyance. And it really didn't help that he was sitting in a meeting room, with that sound coming from the clock above him. But unbeknownst to the man, this was a special kind of torture.
Steve looked to the embers in the fireplace, and instantly felt transported back to the night. The heat and intensity of it completely enveloping him. He looked to his right and could see themselves. All wrapped in ecstasy and pleasure. Tony's moans filling his ears with bliss as they did that night.
As the trio was succeeding in their skirmish, unbeknownst to them, the container was breaking with the glass losing penetrability.
And his power to still roam in the philanthropist's mind. He really pondered the idea, of how after all these years, Steve Rogers is still in his life. Even when he's miles away. Helping whoever, and whatever they might be needing.
And that was it. The last thing Steve Rogers would say to Tony Stark, as a year would pass before the two spoke again.
It's truly nice to know that he's at least making some friends in this new age, that genuinely have heart. Interestingly, Pepper reminded Steve of Peggy. The women were very strong hearted, yet both could call you out on shit if you needed it.
He looked to the building in almost disgust. The memories of what happened there so long ago, made himself feel queasy. And who's face appeared in his mind, almost like a virus: Steve Rogers.
"I didn't know that would be a crime? Did I get some lint on the fabric? What kind of handcuffs would you like me to be arrested in? Or better yet, what prison should I head to?" Tony guffawed.
This confused the genius than ever before. If not for the fact that it was glowing a yellow hue, then it would've most likely be that it's floating.
Natasha felt a chuckle come up, but held it, out of respect. Even though it was a typical disguise, she gave Wanda some points for creativity and authenticity.
And again, in his photo he was staring at the camera. But with an added finger in the shot. It really surprised Tony that they just knew where these people were, and still let them take the picture.
However, one thing that had felt different about tonight than the others before it, was this feeling of comfort. It wasn't the motel, nor was it the bed he was sleeping in.
"Come on, Tony is a full time diva. And Steve is a massive guy. There's only one way for that to work with them. And honestly, if Tony was surely gay, he seems like a bottom to me." Maria answered.
However the sheer weight of pain in Tony's heart, from their altercation, was surely becoming ever so present.
"Strategy. If we can try to knock out these agents, then the huge container thing, can be for later." Steve answered hesitantly.
He threw the car into drive, and drove the car out of the parking lot. The shouting man stopped halfway down the road, and just gave up. But not before giving them ‘the finger’.
"It's time to continue working, now me and Hill found out about secret facilities, in and around, Russia that might be valuable to us." Fury continued, "It might take a few months to get a good look at the places, figure out who's responsible, and get you all back into shape, mentally.".
Pepper would ask how they’ve been. And Natasha would always respond with ‘Could be better.’. The blonde really wishes she could ignore that part. Feeling that in some way it’s due to her and Tony’s non-involvement, in helping others with the snap.
That was an answer he'd never really understand. Or really wanted to figure out. He was perfectly fine with simply reliving these memories.
Tony always knew that Pepper, and now Morgan, have a part of his heart. But the minute that Steve Rogers came into his life. He couldn't get rid of him. Especially with that annoying, yet utter envious, nature of being a leader for the Avengers.
That name so innocent, and inviting. It made Nat stomach's gut be obliterated by it's purity. But the man suddenly smiled. It seemed that he was reliving some fond memories. It finally made the thick atmosphere disappear. And the air felt clean to breathe again.
Sam squeezed beside her, and he too looked dumbfounded at the container before him. There were only 3 of them. Barely any weapons, already bruised and battered from previous events, and that's pretty much it.
"Well thank god, you talked to me. 'Cause he would've made me kick you out, yesterday." Steve smiled at Pepper's comment.
Tony doesn't remember how his dream began, but he definitely remembers where it ended up. It was hazy, but he knew it was at the Stark tower. Yet it looked different, as if it was a completely new building. Walking along the empty corridors, slowly and bit cautiously. He could see the pictures along the walls, swaying left to right.
Nevertheless, Cindy still came by to see her sister as much as possible. But even then, it still seemed as if Ziggy was a burden on her. Which Cindy denies constantly, but it never made the feeling go away.
The two never really felt this much emotion, pain, and sensuality, in one situation, mostly Tony. This was the most comforted and aroused he's been, in a long time.
It was honestly breathtaking to say the least. If Tony had to bury some secrets anywhere, he’d pick this spot from now on.
The sun rays blinding him, momentarily. Corny as it sounded, Tony thought he died and entered heaven itself. To his disappointment, he was just asleep in Steve's room.
Even now, as he and his long-lost friend stood beside him in the Chimera's war room. The brunet didn't feel satisfied in the slightest. And that's what worried him most.
Steve was able to ease into the pain, thanks to the serum, and had his gun aimed for the door, leading out the hallway, with Sam following his friend's actions. Silence befell the room, ignoring the sounds of the trucks outside, leaving the compound. Which was more terrifying to Steve, than the situation they were in.
It was quickly diminished, once he noticed Sam across from him. The super-soldier looked to his friend in anguish, then gazed around the tunnel to see if any guards were around. There weren’t any. So Steve sighed in relief and looked back to his companion. Wings were missing, he was bloody and his hands were tied around one of these pipes.
Which the trio did look into, once they discovered this market a month ago. It made them feel good, that most people still believed in them. But it sent Steve down a mad spiral in nostalgia, to Siberia. And boy did it make his spine shiver in remembrance. But today, long after those events, everything seemed fine. But the Ex-Avengers knew that looks can be deceiving.
Peter, literally, disintegrated into dust, in Tony’s arms. It broke the philanthropist. His greatest fear had come true.
"Nope. And I feel like an asshole who ditches a pretty girl after having sex with her." He states a bit more seriously.
Steve had a feeling Tony would end up knowing somehow. But he had a very good assumption at what shithead knew first. In fact, two shitheads to be a bit more precise.
Steve scoffed, “Hell I couldn’t even keep my team together when we needed to be. I was a coward and held a secret from a person I deeply care about. I let a friend die for a mistake I made. I’ve continuously tried to help, and help I’ve done. But… it, it seems like I’m always losing any chance of happiness for it.”
The property as a whole would be about 40,000 dollars in total. Mainly because the house and surrounding property were in a bit of disarray. And since no one has purchased the place since the 1970s.
"Yes, Mr. Rogers. You not only have a decent-sized front porch, but a similar sized back porch with a covered balcony atop it." Richard smiled softly, "You usually find these types of designs on farmhouses.".
At one point he thought it was Brooklyn Heights. It was now run-down, or completely renovated to modern times to where it's barely recognizable to the super-soldier.
Happy’s gaze did not leave the philanthropist the entire time. He knew Tony was hurting, even if he didn’t want to admit it. His feet guided himself over to his friend, and he sat a comforting hand on his shoulder.
"CEO stuff. The usual, you know. And for that first part, I kind of-well not kind of, missed you guys." Tony relented.
And neighbors were at least 500 ft away, in all directions, besides the river of course. Nonetheless, it was just the right amount of space and peacefulness for a family of four to settle down in.
Annie stomped off, the doll clutched to her chest. Tina raced behind her and proceeded to wrap her arms around Annie. Grabbing the doll from her locks of hair.
Yet the two had a very pleasant talk about many things. Ranging from the Avengers, Natasha, Bruce's life since the snap, and then, the conversation took a sharp turn to his relationship with a particular person: Tony.
Tony apologized profusely, as he grabbed a couple of napkins, and helped Steve with his situation. Once the milk began to dry, the spot on Steve's thigh became sticky.
But after his kidnapping incident, she stopped the morning agony cries. Tony being gone two months really made her realize how much she actually liked his company. Even if it was mostly filled with them arguing about various things.
Steve just eerily walked up to the duo and smiled uneasily. He really was on edge after the whole Hydra/Bucky situation. The trauma of the last 2 years was really weighing on him. But he needed to stop, reflect, and forget. Because, for a man out of time, that's all he has done.
Once it was done, Tony sat on the floor, and huffed once more. It finally dawned onto Tony that maybe they didn’t want most people to know where they were. Maybe... just maybe... that they only wanted... Tony... to know where they were. And truth be told, the philanthropist actually felt a little flattered at the idea, of them posing for a photo, for him to see.
Nonetheless, she continued with the festivities. Even if it felt a little inappropriate considering the times. But how could one night with this much festive energy be so bad? And festive it was.
It was around Christmas time. Tony was heading to the tower to visit before the holidays. As, the tower had just finished construction, and the Avengers had just moved in. He and Pepper hadn’t broken up yet, Wanda was still in Sokovia, the accords hadn't existed, Peter was still alive, and Thanos was still years away from Earth.
He looked to the machine with hope. He would go back and put the stones back to their original spots. But was that all he could do? He thought about this a lot since the funeral ended.
"We're being nice to each other as a way to avoid talking about what happened. But then, something is either said or shown that reminds me of how I hurt him. And by then I'm either too stubborn or too cowardly to say anything.".
"Of course! Why wouldn't I want to sit next to a Christmas tree, that just screams 'Me'." Tony exaggerated.
They came downstairs to find Annalise looking worried as she twisted her wedding band over and over again. "Are you all right, miss?" Steve asked.
She looked to her companion with a fruity expression. Her smile was warm and inviting, which was calming for Vision. Usually this type of smile meant she wanted some comfort.
The orange-haired teen looked to the soldier. It wasn't a happy expression, nor was it a 'go-to hell' one. But he was just happy that he could finally put a name to a face. The blonde even noticed that she had freckles all along her forehead, nose, and cheeks.
And yes, he was seriously psycho-analyzing his love life right now. I mean, they didn't have anything else to do. There were no hydra agents around. Which was strange? And truthfully, his thought process was surely clouding the sheer silence that was in the tunnel.
When he arrived onto the penthouse floor, the first person he noticed was Steve. He was sitting quietly at the bar area, sipping on some whiskey. Being that it was late at night, and since Tony took the phrase fashionably late, a little too literal. Steve was the only soul sitting over at the bar area.
It seemed Tony hadn't been down there for a while, as he was instantly hit with an unusual feeling. A feeling of dread. The type of dread that would make your hairs on the back of your neck stand right up.
Sorry for being a little late, and for the short chapter. I was really trying to see how a chapter with this duo would work. But anyway here it is. Hope y’all are enjoying the story!
Steve carried Vision's body (the only one to be murdered by Thanos without the snap) back to the Wakandian fortress that was T'Challa's. But now is a reminder of his presence than anything else.
However, others looked at the Avengers with morbid intentions. One even spit on the ground near Steve. This generally changed the tone, as others began yelling at the team. Calling them 'freaks in big boy suits'. But this didn't stop from some of the Avengers looking around to see if someone needed them.
“No, No your fine. It’s... it’s just, uh, it’s just been so long-or it feels so long, since that time.”
Once his eyes fell upon their past-selves again, Tony was near his climax. His moans were picking up, which honestly made Steve chuckle a little. But before he could relive their climax, the memory faded from his subconscious. And he was once again, looking at an empty sofa.
Pushing the dialed numbers, in which she saw upon the screen, the ringing that followed made her stomach crawl with concern. Is she almost betraying Vision's trust by doing this? And worryingly, what would he do in response?
Some could say his assumptions were more for his benefit or state of mind. But it made him feel a bit better, knowing that they wanted to be seen by him.
Tony eventually laughed once he realized what his dirty mind was piecing together. And boy, did he wish his mind wasn't so creative and elaborative.
Eventually making her own plate, the overworked mother, sat next to her pride and joy tonight. She then passed him his napkin and utensils. He thanked her and waited for her to begin grace. Sarah softly stated the prayer, and then, counted her blessings for the day as well. A few of them were a bit humorous to Steve, as he desperately tried to hide his laughing.
Steve cracked his neck in relief, whilst looking to the philanthropist frustratingly. His eyes then falling upon the farmhouse before him. It was... big, to say the least. The blonde quickly estimated the house to at least be 4,000 sq ft. if not bigger. What did catch Steve off guard though, was the other buildings that were close to the house. So close in proximity that they just had to be a part of the property as well.
Maybe if they had met up sometime before Thanos, things could've ended differently. But they didn't. And now, Natasha and Steve were lost, Tony still missing, and the world falling apart before their very eyes.
Nat felt that promiscuous mind of hers kick in, and she knew that two men 'staying behind', meant one of two things. One, they are dishing out their dirty laundry. However, the city is not on fire, nor is there any signs of assembling, so then it must be number two. Which deals with several methods of sexual pleasure.
"Not really. Truthfully I actually can't. It's all fuzzy now trying to remember it." He affirmed defectively.
With that, the group left the cab and headed toward the door of the Brooklyn Diner. The man just went back to his own commemoration of Maggie, before turning around to call out Natasha specifically. How he already knew her name she will never know. The simple, heartfelt words that left his lips this night, remained with her, "Thank You.". Finally the trio walked up into the diner.
Eventually meeting him near the middle, she tackled the man. He got a few hits into her before she swung legs over the man's neck in typical Widow fashion. Twisting around the man's neck and before closing his throat in a death grip between her thighs.
"Oh please, don’t do that Tony. Come on." Steve laughed. He didn't want to sound so amused, but Tony's interview voice was getting to him.
This chapter was meant to show the trauma left over from the Chitauri’s raid in 2012. We also got a clue at to what Steve and Tony could’ve been doing in their absence. And don’t worry there returning in the next chapter. Anyway thanks for reading!
"Well, that's not all true. I did already hurt you. Through, Thanos, Peter, and the whole Accords situation," Steve mumbled.
"Steve, you're being paranoid. We're literally going to the barn, and petting the horses. You do realize that in the time-span we’ve been here, that we have only been around those horses
Bruce was wearing a regular vest with an emerald shirt underneath. Black pants and shoes to finish the look. He was also a fan of not going too deep with the 'dressing up' formality.
When Steve reached the landing and took a deep breath. He already knew what was going to happen. And even though he didn't want to, the soldier knew that it was going to happen whether he wanted it to or not. He's just going to have to tell Annalise that he's not going to purchase the house.
He never would've believed, a man, could get him to a state like he was. Especially Steve, and with their argument literally 5 minutes ago, still fresh in his mind.
A noise from inside, made his hand repress back to his side. It was walking, the sound was somebody walking. Was he walking to the door? Did he know that he was here?! Or what if he thinks it's Pepper?
Because even though he knows it'll never happen. He'd rather be honest with himself, as he searches for this new ambition, than lying to himself. With that, Steve felt less rigid, knowing that he’d be sleeping next to someone that’s giving him a home.
The grieving father looked into Nat's eyes. Her glare did not break, as she was hell bent on expressing/showing her truth. She didn't care how long they would have to stare at each other. If it meant that he could see her honesty, than that was fine for her.
"You can rain check, but I'm pretty sure I have some cheerleaders here, who would be happy to hear more of this idea." Tony protested.
"Something with him and Tony that had made them act like idiots for a couple of days. But it wasn't anything big. I got that from Fury." Sam answered.
And as each snowflake fizzled on the window, she took a deep breath in and quickly blew it back out. Fogging up her scenery, for one. Which, in her defense, was mostly clouds and the orange glow coming from her side of the window.
"Understood, Mam." Steve stood in his soldier stance. To which, Pepper playfully shoved him back. Steve looked back around the property and took a nice breath of fresh air.
Steve suddenly smirked as the awkwardness between the two gave him some nostalgic memories. One in particular hit his brain as if it was placed there. He glanced over at Tony, who now was awkwardly sucking on his straw.
The realization that Steve knew how to prepare, a man, for sex (You can thank Natasha for that one!). Yet was so enveloped in their situation that he completely forget about doing it, made Tony even more aroused.
Once inside, the two tried to catch their breaths. Whilst, Sam looked for weapons, really any kind. However, the tool they were in, was anything but helpful. A few cabinets, were on the back wall, with some boxes atop a marble counter. ‘This must’ve been a kitchen.’ Sam thought.
He didn't say anything or did anything. She began to walk her way towards the stairs until Steve grabbed her arm in defeat.
After his last sentence, he could see Peter’s ever so smug smirk. Tony sat puzzled, until the realization of what he said, and how he put it, made Peter’s smirk clearer to understand.
Truly things couldn't get any worse? Right? I mean Steve knew that losing both Tony and Natasha was a bullet to his heart and soul. How much more could he lose at this point?
All Tony does is thank her profusely, and runs back inside to find Steve. His path was a set of trips and bumps into people as he made his way through the ship's corridors. He eventually stumbled into Steve's closed doorway. He doesn't hesitate to open the door, before he stops in his tracks and freezes. The older man just stares, as he finds the built man sleeping for once.
He got up from the table, ready to ask Tony about his plan. But Tony was already with Bruce, heading down to the science lab. Steve suddenly grew fatigue. I guess yesterday's events were finally catching up to him. But the utter thought of leaving New York in the state that it is, was deafening.
Here’s a link to the theme song, that I personally picked for the fan fiction: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GB_S2qFh5lU
The woman across from him held her glee in, eagerly. But she definitely wasn't acting as if she was composed either.
Tony stayed in his place, while still trying to figure out what the trio were trying to tell him. A few more minutes passed of gazing and studying, and he felt the defeat wash over him. He felt his head droop as his eyes stared at his feet, deep in thought.
No Steve Rogers in sight. He was in the guest room next to Tony and Pepper's room. He felt his presence in Tony's bed would be obviously inappropriate. And He wanted Tony to remember where they laid together for the last time.
Anyway, the story is coming to a close. And I’m very proud on how it’s grown since the first chapter. I hope you’ve enjoyed the story, at least this far! And yes, the next chapter is the artistically-put smut chapter. The longest chapter in the story.
Tony lifted a brow while showing a mischievous smirk. He picked up the pillow in front of him and concluded with, "Your on, Soldier!".
"Yeah, this is it for me." Steve looked to the brunet with so much relief and admiration that Tony seemed to have become a little nervous.
Unbeknownst to the super soldier, a certain philanthropist had resurfaced from the bathroom, and sat in his spot. He popped a piece of gum in his mouth, and looked to his companions. Sam and Happy just glared laughingly at him.
He then decided it was time to sit down somewhere. And the 'where' was a table near the main entrance to the command deck. A Christmas tree dawned in the colors of Tony's suit sat idly by.
But, it was some damn good news. News that the Avengers have been wanting for 5 years now. But that's a story for another day.
"Sure thing, beef-cakes." Tony joked. He then, boosted himself up and down Park Ave. The group then began the trek up West, 42nd street to find anyone. They were successful in finding a couple trapped in a car by a falling piece of concrete. But that wasn't it. Bruce suddenly could hear a small cry somewhere.
Once it was all 'said and done', she felt the anger leave her. Letting the remorse, and pity for the man follow. I mean, she knew of another reason why he wouldn't want to help. But for keeping a relationship that was already rocky, to begin with, just astounded the Russian.
The soldier went back to washing his hands before drying them with the dish towel. He then walked into the playroom, which had been the room that Steve had found that old chalkboard in, and began to pick up some of the other toys. When his mind began to dissect the conversation he had with the girls, and how he almost lost his temper again.
Steve noticed Tony's anger grow. He could see his iron fists ball up. 'No, No, No, don't do that yourself!' He thought persistently. He grabbed Tony's balled fist, and nodded at him. Tony understood his gesture, and the two separated. Tony grabbed Clint, while Steve held Natasha. She was truly upset. She never saw a child, die like this before. Clint's reaction was close to Tony's. He kept a brave face, but his eyes were flooding with tears. Bruce wipes his tears, and came over to a distraught Nat, and hugged her as well. The team grouped into a circle. They had to process their situation, and get back to the plan.
