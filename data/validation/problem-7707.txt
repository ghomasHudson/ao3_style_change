“Eleanor, darling, go wash up. It’s going to be a lovely day today.” Peggy smiled as Steve began to prepare the sink to wash the dishes.
“You did it, Ellie!” Steve exclaimed as he picked her up and twirled her around.
Meanwhile…
They stared at each other unyielding, Steve wanted answers and Tony wouldn’t give any.
“Yes, I am aware, and I have been told numerous times that my humor is shit. But listen,” he said as he picked up a small device off of the table. “I need you to try this out.”
He crash landed heavily about fifty meters from where he started. He sat up quickly and analyzed the threshold for the pseudo-void himself.
“No!  Get off of him!”  Steve bellowed as he plowed his shield into the soldiers head.
“What are you thinking Cap?” The genius questioned.
What kind of game was that bastard playing? Was he doing all this to put another notch in his bedpost or was he trying to manipulate him into being okay with his imprisonment?
Tony began flying around the perimeter of the battlefield. He began launching tiny devices and landing them in strategic locations. When the last one was in place a containment field was activated.
He followed the flashing light until he came into the main processing room.  He could see every floor from where he was.  He could also see a gigantic fuzzy zapper suspended with long gnarly barbed tentacles in the middle of the entire structure.
Bucky was with the siblings. If they were no longer under anybody’s command he was sure they would not let Bucky assassinate anyone. Those kids weren’t wicked inherently, just misguided. Especially if he was with that mind reader. She had the power to stop him.
Steve shifted instinctively to place himself in between Natasha and Calamity. But Calamity remained where she was.
“I’m sorry-“ Tony started.
Tony could sympathize. He knew Steve was like that. It still hurt though despite it all. Steve still chose Bucky over Tony even if it was in the face of a terrible misunderstanding. It still happened.
Easy right?
“With your, uh, ‘devise’ did you sense what was happening, did you see who or what did do it?” Steve asked excitedly filled with hope. Could there troubles be over? But before Xavier could answer Fury butted in.
He laughed, "Time to die now-Oof!"
Tony sighed heavily and rolled his neck before addressing Clint once more.
How odd, he had never pictured himself in that kind of relationship, mostly because if any were to ever find out he and his lover would be killed for it. Steve sighed heavily, he found it interesting that he didn't find fault in being in a same-sex relationship with someone only that it was a safety concern.
“Yes Captain!”
He paid attention to the way Steve moved, to his micro-expressions, the influx of his voice and to the color of his eyes. Everything from the way he blinked to the way he breathed. He replayed the footages over and over until he was convinced that there was a modicum of truth and what Natasha was saying. He was in pain and not just physically. Tony loathed to admit it but he was sure it was somehow his own fault.
Okay, things are starting to look up.
*CLAP* *CLAP* *CLAP* *CLAP*
There.
“How long do these episodes usually last?”
"Take good care of them, love, cherish every second with them."
As they crossed over the threshold Tony initiated a startup program. “Jarvis! Start her up!” He turned to Steve abruptly, “Okay! Stay right there.”
They were at a coffee shop across the street going over the plan.
… Right…
"I did not say what the price would be? How did you not know? I told you from the start I wanted the souls. How did you not suspect where offering your soul would lead you?"
“He said it is a really ancient form of data storage, lost in time from an extinct race from millennia ago. As in, it’s stupidly rare and no one knows how to work it. Thor left for Asgard this morning to inquire about.”
End Chapter Twenty-One
“Oh, what the hell?”  Tony grabbed his glass and took a tentative sip.  It was followed by an even larger gulp.  Steve had to quickly grab his glass back before Tony drank it all.
Bucky nodded, “I do know, probably the stupidest thing they could have done to you.”
The Thing developed a severe eye twitch that was actually quite auditable.
He stood up and took Ellie’s hand and they made their way down the stairs to help unload the groceries.
“I love you, Daddy.” She whispered.
“What are their conditions?”
Steve obeyed dutifully taking his seat quickly, whilst Tony took his sweet ass time to find his seat next to the Captain. The Professor remained where he was near the head of the table. Beside him were Steve then Tony and Coulson.
God he hated himself so bad right now for destroying that radio. It was a significant piece of his plan. Now he could not use it to know what Shield was up to.
Steve sighed deeply. “I know, Bucky, I know.”
"Angie is here and is going to take us. Okay Babydoll?"
He swallowed thickly, Steve's limp body still in his arms, felt heavier and heavier by the minute. It was as if it symbolized the weight that was the fate of humanity, and in a twisted way it really was.
No, he could wait. He had to save Bucky first. Then she could take him.
“Now, tell me how the fuck you ended up in love with Tony fucking Stark?” He prodded again.
She only smiled sadly at him.
"Easy?! Easy indeed." She exclaimed with exasperation and annoyance. "For a time I had genuinely wondered if I would even succeed. You truly had me worried. Anthony, I found would have been impossible to sway. I ran scenario after scenario over in my head and no matter how deeply and depravedly I tore him apart, in the end despite how hopelessly broken he was he would have still told me to 'go fuck myself.' Every time."
"Fascinating is it not? Each beat of his heart represents a specific number in the count down to the doom of your race. How awful for you to know you were the catalyst that spurred it on." Calamity spoke up suddenly.
“Hn. Come on, let’s go see what Fury wants.”
Steve felt it was the best time to bring in team two to take over the mass evacuation while he pulled Iron Man, Antman and Thor to surround Dr. Doom. He took cover in an alleyway to give orders.
“Oh, well Natasha it made me swear that if I ever saw a prickly pear lemonade on the menu that I would order it because if I didn’t apparently I would regret it for the rest of my life.  Or something like that.”  He stated with a smile looking up at Tony.
“You did great Tony.  I know you want nothing more than to keep working but after this meeting I really hope you would stop and rest.”  Steve commented looking at Tony with a look that screamed no argument.
“Yeah, I know. My childhood wasn’t sunshine and rainbows either and I may have hated to go home, but at least I wasn’t afraid to. And I do know what its like to be afraid to go to sleep at night but not because some one is going to rape me.” Tony commented after Clint’s response.
“What do you mean by thingies??” Johnny piped up smirking.
“Thank you, Jarvis.” Bucky replied after a moment.
Suddenly, all five spatial distorters pulsed in tandem. The hole dilated then constricted rhythmically like a heartbeat as the distorters struggled to stabilize the pseudo-void. The mother roared in rage when, to Tony's relief, and to the relief of the other Avengers, the portal snapped back to a more manageable size.
After a moment, Tony felt a pair of hands on his shoulders. He looked up into Barnes’s face that was still twisted in misery.
She laughed. "I like you. You truly delight me so." She said with reverence. "Why…" She sighed. "Why did I choose you? Why did I choose your race? Why have I staked claim on the souls of the nine realms?"
He scratched his wrist.
“And you couldn’t wait to go through the proper channels because?” Fury inquired, his eye twitch very prominent.
The Captain declared becoming somewhat excited, his brilliant tactile brain already formulating startlingly amazing strategies.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What have you got Romanov, Barton?” Director Fury asked breaking everyone from his or her morbid and disturbed thoughts.
"You can relax, Anthony. I only mean to reclaim this…" She gently tucked her fingers into the collar of his shirt.
End Chapter Twenty-Seven
"When I first arrived here on Earth and began searching for my Keystone I was delighted to find that Earth had a few sets of representative champions already. One in particular hailed under the banner of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Of those individuals two had souls that shone the brightest and had the qualities I often sought-after."
“Here’s what you need to know about getting that package to the power unhindered…”
“It was my hands, my bow that did them in. I know, I know logically that it’s not my fault, that there was absolutely nothing I could do but it was still me. I will never forgive myself for that, not really.”
"Rögvava?"
One can almost see him practically foaming at the mouth.
It was important.
“What can I say, it was cramping my style.” Steve smirked.
“The “search” for my keystone?  That’s funny.”  She mused.  “Oh love, I have already found my keystone.  It’s…  How do I put this…  Not ready to use.”  She confessed with a sly smirk.
Though he had known this his whole life; women have much more value and equality that is recognized.
“Steven, listen to me, much like how you are unable to tell the others about the condition of the Director, the others cannot tell you what is happening.  I cannot tell you either, but at the very least I may be able to try and explain why.”  Charles smiled dismally at him.
Wonderful.
Everything seemed to happen at once after that. He heard Tony cry out so he whipped around just in time to see Iron Man make a collision course with Thor. The containment zone broke and the fast man appeared next to him suddenly. Next thing he knew he was on his ass as he watched the fast man pick up the unconscious woman and disappear. Steve thought he might have heard him call her sister.
Chapter One: And So It Begins
Bucky nodded slowly taking in what he was saying and what Tony was saying.
"I know this is bad guys, but we have to stay focused!" Nat tried to rally.
“To answer your question, it was a world from another time near the beginning of everything. Before history books were written and before time itself held any meaning. In a time where life forms had barely begun to become aware of their own existence.” She answered.
Tony and Bruce went straight to the machines that were monitoring and tracking the patient’s heart and brain activities along with various other vitals. Natasha and Clint were talking to potential witnesses. Xavier was also gathering information in his own way. Steve stood out of the way surveying the room, looking out for anything or anyone out of place.
“You accomplished in days with took me decades.”
“Okay, okay. I’m sorry!” Clint shouted again. “I’m sorry.” He said a little calmer now.
Steve shoved himself into a small closet sized compartment with one of the three aid bots.
“I’m Kevin and this little guy is my younger brother Tommy.”
“Really? You two make goo goo eyes at each other so often I just assumed, obviously I was wrong. Clint hit the nail on the head though.” She explained.
After cleaning up and establishing that they did not need a bonfire to do so, they had distributed what was left of Steve’s supply for a light breakfast. Pietro had woken up sometime after Steve and Bucky’s emotional exchange and moaned about how he was glad he didn’t have to witness it.
Steve’s eyes widened marginally.
"Took the words right in my mouth, Rhodey."
He had no idea how he was even talking right now. The kids slowly nodded then turned to Johnny hopefully.
Steve was so utterly lost and confused. The last thing he remembered was…
He sighed. He tried to will the idea away but now that he had thought of it the more he realized that this was the next best course of action. He hated himself so much right now. But if it got him closer to Bucky before the others, well, then whatever.
They made their way to the super duper meeting room.  Though the walls were horribly dented with Hulk fist shaped dents every which way and the ceiling was cracked and the floor wasn’t much better, the main components of the room still worked. The chairs and desk had already been replaced, so had the external computer equipment.  The rest of the Avengers looked about the room in stunned silence with a tang of horror, knowing full well that if the Hulk was angry enough it could’ve been much more worse.
Answers first, then he’d wallow in self misery till the end of the world. God, that sounded horrible. Clint and Pepper were right, he needed to pull himself together.
Why?  What was so important to destroy the core that had caused so much pain?  Something had to be worth it.
Tony fought the urge to roll his eyes.
So the first time I watched Civil War I swear up and down that in that movie Tony’s mother was also called Sarah as well as Steve’s mother. I figured they were trying to do a spoof on the Batman versus Superman movie. But then I go back and watch it and I can’t find it. And I think other people thought the same thing that I did because there were a few fanfiction that I read around the time Civil War came out that had that element, so whatever. It’s kind of important that their mothers have the same name in my story so I’m just going to roll with it.
Bucky sighed deeply. “You’re incorrigible, I tried.” He threw his hands up in surrender.
He pressed his hands into his head and winced.
His mind is trying to come to terms with this revelation. Surely Thor must be mistaken. Surely they can overcome. But then again…
Steve smiled at him. “Hey.”
"Sure thing, hon, I'll be back in a jiffy." She smiled, before heading off to the back.
“I really don’t know how to take that but I’m glad you initially had faith in me.” Tony responded dryly.
Unfortunately, our dear Super Soldier did not understand how the Professor was so absolutely sure that the suspect was not a mutant or what this ‘Cerebro’ thing was but seeing as how everyone else seem to know he kept his questions and concerns to himself.
‘Priorities Steve.’ He thought to himself. Not a very good idea to get drunk under the circumstances anyway. Tony has proven the stupidity of that idea on numerous occasions.
“First Gloria fainted here.” Natasha pointed out on the screen.
Steve laughed as Tony tried to come up with an excuse as to why he hadn’t thought of it before. In the end Steve owed Tony fifty bucks. There was just no way that Nick Fury was that much of a pleasant social butterfly without a bit of hooch.
Bucky remained silent, pensive. It honestly irked Tony more than the others presence. Barnes was as nearly hyperverbal as he was and when he was silent like this, it was scary.
Chapter Twenty-Three: Sending All My Love to You
“Not for long.”
“What did you do that was so different?!”  She nearly bellowed.
It took every ounce of strength for him to be able to.
This was his life. This was his beautiful family. When the child realized Steve was awake she bounded to him merrily.
Howard and his fiancée were right on time. After Steve closed the door behind them Peggy led their friend and his lady to the living room after calling Eleanor back into the house. Once everyone was present Howard finally spoke up.
‘How…? Just a few minutes ago we
“It seems, Sir, they have jamming technology that is overwriting homing capabilities.” Jarvis answered.
Bucky new that was utter horseshit but nodded anyway. He knew there was no arguing with him. However, he was most certainly not getting on that jet no matter what that punk says. He knows his place is right next to Steve. Wanda gave him a knowing look; she knew what he was planning.
They all nodded.
“Why are you even here?” Tony snipped at Nat.
He did not know. What does the heart and the moon have to do with each other anyway?
"Oh shit! I just remembered; Jarvis told me two hundred and fifty doom bots are incoming." Tony exclaimed in a rush. "And more cities are under attack!"
Steve found a peace he hadn’t felt in nearly a century as he watched Tony’s sleeping form. The couch was close to a window so he could still see as the clouds lazily drifted by. But despite the epic sci-fi action film and the enchanted clouds out the window Tony held Steve’s focus completely.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There was purple and orange and blue and pink and yellow and white and gold.” She listed.
Tony touched the screen a few times before he wailed.
Steve only shrugged. He had an odd look about him. The Captain looked him up and down, the tension was tight.
“What of it? If it was me or everyone else it would better that I die in their place!”
The scream of ecstasy that tore from the Captain's throat emboldened Tony to move faster, rubbing their hardening members together sensually. Now thoroughly aroused, Steve gripped Tony's hair firmly and tugged his head back, unlatching him from his neck, then resumed their heated kiss, plundering Tony's mouth for all he was worth. The desperate moan of pleasure he elicited from Tony was a dangerous fuel to their lustful fire.
Steve froze, ‘That’s not it at all!  Had he not been reading my mind?’
A/N: Welcome back, Earthlings! I have a superduper long chapter for you today. Even though I split this chapter up from thirty-seven, it still remains massive. Oops! Oh well, for those of you who enjoy long chapters, you’re going to enjoy this.
“Aww it’s a girls coat!”
Steve recoiled as the soldier punched him in the gut with his left arm.  He hadn’t felt that awful sensation in years. It was infinitely more harsh than the what the doom bot had unleashed upon him.  The soldier took the opportunity to kick the Captain in the face sending him flying back.  The soldier was on him pummeling his face in before he could recover.  Steve managed to throw him and reversed their positions using his shield to beat at his face.  The impact fractured the lens of the mask.
‘No, not now!’ He thought helplessly.
The person spoke again but Steve could not hear his words.
“As of this moment 73 victims have been reported. The media is calling it a viral epidemic however we know that is not the case.”
“Stop staring! You’re making me uncomfortable.” He whispered harshly.
“You’re in love with Tony Stark?” He asked slowly as if tasting each word.
Just as he reached his intended floor, a laughing Tony and an irritated Rhodey stumbled out of the elevator.
"Oh?" Barnes replied with a smirk. "So, you told him?" His attention now fully on Tony.
Before he could respond however, Clint spoke up.
“I don’t know, I won’t know till it happens. At this point the best course of action is to close the hole. If I take another crack at it maybe we’ll get somewhere. Think you can guard me until then?”
“Great!” He shouted sarcastically.
He watched absently as Dr. Doom turned on her instantly and attacked her with one of his most destructive abilities at his disposal. Calamity only laughed. Steve could feel himself start to shake. Victor was about to gear up and attacked her with everything he had before he altogether stopped and fell to the streets beneath him. He landed with a sickening thud. And with that he moved no more. The doom bots still remaining soon followed their master and shutdown operation.
"If this actually works maybe ten minutes, fifteen tops. Think you can keep me alive that long?"
“Like you’re any better!” Steve snapped.
“Man, what is going on?  It looks like you’ve seen a ghost.”  Clint asked getting even more worried.
“Already underway, Sir.”
Tony nodded silently, blinking rapidly. Steve knew if Tony engaged, he would have died right then and there.
Tony shook his head then got back to work, he absolutely could not let that foul mouth little turd win. Iron Man continued his assault on the hell birds and doom bots.
"But she said something that got me thinking that maybe Steve and the others are not all that in control of what their dreamscapes are." He alluded.
“As you all may know an 86
“And get as much rest as possible.” Steve said as he walked through the sick bay doors where he was met with Physicians and a gurney.
With that they began to dig in.
"Why?" She mused. "Why anything? Why does why exist? Why does existence exist in of itself to ask why it exists?" She pondered.
Tony groaned and Bucky snickered.
“Okay, take a deep breath.” Tony said helping the soldier swing his legs over the gurney.
Steve stood there for a moment, stunned to stillness. He could not get a grasp on his feelings at all. It was as if he were feeling everything there was to feel all at once. His heart pounded wildly and his breathes were short and fast.
Natasha, right beside Clint, quickly assessed the situation and swiftly concluded that the occupants in the room were having a moment. She smiled knowingly on the inside and said nothing.
"Yeah man, you did the best you could. No regrets, right?" Barton chimed in.
The others looked at the Captain disbelievingly.
Tony knew what he was gunning for. Under any other circumstance in the world he would just walk away and wouldn’t give him the time of day. But he needed to know what happened with Steve, so he submitted.
He then turned to Jane. “All this here,” he gestured to the heaps of data on the table, “is everything we have managed to gather about this whole mess.” He sighed.
She began screaming, the intensity and weight of his experiences were too much to bear. But he didn’t stop. He wanted her to know, to feel everything. He pressed on.
"Yes, it's a bit much translated into your language. I guess a looser translation would be 'Pitch Black Hair Girl' or more simply, 'Pitch Black.'"
"What?" He asked apprehensively.
The memory of Natasha’s sharp words suddenly flashed through his mind. Tony felt bile rise to his throat and tears finally spilled from his eyes. He has so much to answer for. He silently begged everyone for forgiveness then bid everyone goodbye. He could hear his team shouting for him but he would not stop. There were only five more units of the sequence before the fireworks.
"Yeah, if that's okay. I can't just keep calling you Calamity. And I guess I just thought it would be nice for you to be called a name that was connected to her somehow." And that would be easy for Steve to pronounce, but he did not say that out loud.
Steve looked on as Tony’s head started to noticeably inflate. Due to the considerable expansion of his head new ideas, formulas and schematics started popping up in his mind. The crazy genius then started to wander off to execute some of these innovative ideas.
“I’ll distract them.” Bucky suddenly whispered in his ear.
“Pretty much.” He replied. The irony had not escaped him.
“You know I could come back if I was interrupting anything.” She said with a wink.
He did not know why he was so fixated on it. He figured it was because he had dreamed of this mysterious person since day one after waking up with no memories beyond that fateful day he put the Valkyrie down. No matter what the reason was, the man was definitely important, somehow.
“Boss!  He’s waking up!”
Eleanor was obviously very put out, she had been told that she was not permitted to go in to see her mother, but it could not be helped.
The machine came to a halt and Ellie cheered and waved to her adoring fans as she dismounted gracefully.
"Want me to kill him?" The soldier asked.
He would draw damn near anything she desired in a heartbeat.
Well it’s something, damn; everyone is going to be as cranky as hell today.
“Jarvis, ETA on completed rendering?” Tony called out.
“What’s wrong?” He saw the still child and his face fell.
“What did I say when?”  Steve asked needing clarification.
“It’s my choice.”
“Yeah?”  He answered pausing his discipline over the dough.
Steve was as red as a tomato thinking back on that incident that lead to such mortification; it was all Clint’s fault.
“And Captain Rogers,” he said pointedly getting the attention of the obviously distraught captain.
The brother nudged him forward and led him to the duo. Steve thought his heart was going to beat right out of his chest with every step he took closer. By the time he reached the proper row he was sure everyone could hear his heart beating like mad. The brother nudged him again to enter the row. He counted the distance as he approached.
At the absolute least, Tony had finally managed to decrypt the thumb drive. It was gnarly and difficult but it finally happened.
Anywho, Now we are on the home stretch!
Steve stretched and rolled over, quickly grabbing the sketchbook and drew as much of the man as he could remember. Unfortunately, he didn't get as far as he would have liked. He managed to sketch out a round face, messy dark hair and an oddly stylized beard.
Later that night, after not burning dinner and getting Ellie tucked in and reading her another fable, The Eagle and the Jackdaw, Steve made his way out to the barn again.
“Come now darling, you must have realized by now.” She smirked at him delighted in the fact that was practically a blushing virgin again.
“How many people were betting on that?” Steve wondered shocked.
‘Beautiful!’ He thought spitefully.
“Please, just let me go! I’m not worth it!” He shouted as he tried to wrench his wrist free from Steve’s iron grip.
Steve was shook but focused his attention on to Ellie. "It's beautiful, Babydoll." Steve said taking the net from her.
“Unit two here, what’s the sitch?” Copied Black Widow.
“I know this is big and personal for you. I’ve known Tony for a while now and considering everything, I have a lot of respect for the guy as you can imagine.” She said.
“Funny you should say tha-ahh” His quip was cut off as a Von Doom engaged him.
“You’re right.” Tony frowned.
"And what's this about Calamity showing up again?" The Soldier inquired nonchalantly as he stared intently at Tony making the genius immensely uncomfortable.
It was also in that moment that Tony had fully realized how much he had really needed this hero, and it was also the moment he remembered that he too was a hero.
Tony sighed, “yeah for now.” Now that he was sufficiently caffeinated he knew he could not put this off any longer. “All right, let’s head over to the lounge area over there so that we can talk.” He paused when his stomach growled rudely. “And maybe attempt to eat something.” He added.
Steve wanted to punch him.  Seriously, why do they have to assume anything happened?  Even if he wanted something to happen…  Nope!  Not thinking about it.
The genius, as obnoxious as he is, is in fact still a genius. That being said everyone trusts his knowledge seriously.
A/N: Thank you all for reading! Hope you all come back for the next one!
Only if that is what is in fact on this device. It has occurred to Tony time and time again that Calamity could be using it as a diversion. Forcing Tony to focus on it instead of leading his team the way he was meant to in Steve’s absence. Unfortunately, ignoring the drive was a risk that he absolutely could not take. Too many civilian lives were at stake. If he could not solve the puzzle then every single person on earth was going to have their soul taken by Calamity. In a nutshell his hands were tied.
"I'm so sorry about everything. I know you hate me and this doesn't even come close to making up for what I did to you but I promise not to give up. I promise I'll find a way to keep it together and to keep going and do absolutely everything in my power to keep the world safe, okay?... I-I have to go now, there's some bad guys doing bad things and I got a go stop them. The… The thing is, you won't be here when I get back. So, this… this is… Goodbye…"
He pulled the net closer looking at the butterfly but not really looking at it. His mind was still utterly consumed by the man that had just disappeared right before his eyes.
“Wait, wait, wait!” Clint interceded. He turned to Barnes. “How do you know the hologram is Yggdrasil?”
He turned to Peggy mildly concerned. “Are you sure you don’t need my help with anything?”
“I wanted to see if you were all right.”  He replied almost sadly.  “So much is happening all at once and I fear isolating yourself like this is not in your best interests.”
His heart skipped a beat and his blood ran cold. There was just no way.
“Or, how about storming a Hydra weapons manufacturing facility all by yourself?”
“Look at me!  Apologizing.  It’s extraordinary.”  She cried merrily.
Back on the other side…
“Jarvis, alert me immediately if you find this guy.”  Tony ordered.
“Okay, let’s move.”
Steve still disagreed, "I understand what you are trying to achieve, and it is a remarkable ideal. But you can't just expect me to be okay with sacrificing billions of innocent people to achieve this. It's not right. There has to be a better way."
Steve smiled at her antics. He watched them as if from a great distance. Ellie began regaling Avalon's achievements and conquests and Angie took it all in laughing merrily as she patted the top of those golden curls.
She eyed him skeptically. "There is nothing beautiful about those." She wrinkled her nose at the lumpy mashed potatoes and scorched pork chops.
An odd sensation overcame him. He stared into his round coffee cup as if in a trance.
'What?'
“Is this going to be one of your suicidal idiotic plans?” Bucky sighed.
“Actually, Calamity said that if we stopped her everyone would wake up.”
There was so much information to absorb it was overwhelming. In my wanderings, it was inevitable that I would encounter life.
I know that this letter won’t reach you in time to really make a difference but for what it’s worth I’m truly sorry for the unforgivable measures I took to escape the way I did. I never really wanted to leave you or the others, Tony. Not like that. I hope one day you could forgive me.
“SpiderMan you take middle range herd them together and take them out.” Peter nodded rapidly.
Steve looked rapidly between Tony and his drawing trying to figure out how to avoid answering or explaining what it is.  Tony started to look at him expectantly.  Uh oh, oh well.
Before he could make the final adjustments, Pepper burst through the door. Oh boy, she was not happy. He sighed, he did not want to deal with whatever she came to bitch about. He just wanted to tinker with his stuff and wallow in self misery for a little while was that too much to ask?
She smiled as she addressed Tony but her eyes never left Steve's wounded body.
Steve would have to be their shield.
"Oh? Not 100%? I was sure I had you by the short and curlies." Was Tony's vivid response. She merely smiled. "And while we're being all informative here, I've got a question for you." He continued on. "Why go through all this? Why not just snap your fingers and be done with all of it?"
Fury then proceeded to distribute orders. Tony and Bruce were to continue their work with the desynthization simulations. Clint and Natasha were going to look for the face of Calamity and keep track of her wherever she may appear and try to find everywhere she’s been. If there is a pattern in her movements then perhaps there is a way to predict what she will do next.
Steve started huffing up to the fifth floor.
But it was something.
Steve could visibly see where his mind was going.
"Thor's back." Barnes commented with relief.
She smiled and tugged his hand harder now leading him down the hall of the mansion.
Steve headed on over to the directory hanging on the wall to the left of the entrance.
“Mr. Stark, Dr. Banner I assume that despite the absence of Professor Xavier and Dr. McCoy you two will be able to continue your work.”  Fury eyed them intently with his one eye.
This had better work…
“Oh! Yeah, I should probably do that.” He replied mildly embarrassed.
He wouldn’t be able to use weapons but at least he wouldn’t have to sit there in a dead suit. Iron Man stood up shakingly.
“We’re not done here Captain.” She smirked at him.
“Come on.” He sighed exasperated as he grabbed Tony’s wrist and hauled him up to his feet.
"It matters not whether you accept it. I will continue on with the next phase of my plan all the same." She said at first harshly then gently as if consoling a child.
“Okay, pay attention. In the future, you will be doing this yourself.” Tony resumed, getting serious. “You see this mechanism here? When I pull this, it’s going to flip over like a switch, and when that happens all of the neuro-clasps in the bone anchor here and the neuro-clasps in the arm here will connect and become latched. The arm will be completely locked into place.” Tony paused to let the information sink in. “When that happens, your entire neurological network will be connected. Everything from the neuro-transmitter microchip I embedded in your spinal cord, to the neuro-clasps and neuro-receivers in the arm.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey kid? How you hanging in there?” Tony called out over the coms to Spiderman.
Tony huffed and rolled his eyes. “I’m making sure you’re not going to die on me.” He said pointing to the blood. “Things like that become good indicators.”
How on earth did he get so lucky?
“Yeah, let her in.” He replied in almost a whisper.
No, he most certainly was not fine. How is it he could remember Tony but not remember his significance. It was just right there on the forefront of his mind but he could not reach it. He was really starting to get scared.
Then suddenly, the universe decided to finally send him one small mercy.
They get one more piece of the puzzle and an unexpected visitor!
Steve nodded in silence trying to stifle his own yawn as they were getting closer to the quarters.  Tired and exhausted were written on Steve face also.
The moment Natasha realized she held Steve’s attention she began to weep.  She face planted into the Captains chest and started to sob uncontrollably.
He gently removed her sandals and began to rub her swollen feet. They were silent for some time. Peggy was starting to doze and Steve got lost in thought. He would be convinced he was dreaming if it weren’t for the fact that everything was just so vivid. And he noted how sore his body was especially his right arm and abdomen. It wasn’t painful, more like an uncomfortable twinge. He had been awake for nearly an hour now the serum should have healed whatever ailed him. He guessed it must have been another side effect of his condition. A condition that made him forget the last several years of his life. Made him forget that he was married with a daughter and another child on the way.
“Just book work.”
Just as he said that, another scream pierced through the air. He began to back up a little feeling completely confused and at a loss as what to do. He had nearly backed into the orderly that was now picking up the fragments of the coffee mug he had dropped.
Chapter Fifteen: For This Moment To Come
It was on the night of the fifth day when things finally started to settle down. Tony expanded the dining room into something of a banquet hall. A lot of people had huge appetites and Tony was downright astonished over the most recent food bill. Steve only laughed.
He was yanked out of his thoughts, however, by the shrieking sound of metal tearing apart. Immediately after he felt the air return to his lungs and with it his other senses.
“You ‘nearly’ kissed?” She asked hoping for clarification.
“I love you.” She whispered into his neck. She tightened her embrace around him as if the act could hold all the pieces of his broken heart together.
"Stark? Can you fix it?"
“How did you get out of your restraints!?” Tony demanded chastising.
The world may be ending but only the avengers truly know how close to annihilation they truly are.
“On your left.”
The plan seemed to be working swimmingly until it wasn’t. After Steve, with the help of the Thing, manage to usher a few civilians they found out of the perimeter zone a new wave of puff balls emerged out of a factory to the west.
“I thought this is where you would be.”  He stated with a wink.
~-0-~
Tony walked into the range and spotted Clint immediately. He was using the little birdie bots that Tony created to fly around the room as moving targets. Barton never missed. He darted around the obstacle course and hit every single one with insane accuracy. It was jarring and breathtaking all at once. Tony approached closer and Clint spotted him instantly.
“All right here's the plan.”  Steve began.  “I will head in to the facility first and draw out the remaining two.  You two stay out here and take out these three bots by any means necessary all according to Fury’s orders.  I shall alert you should I need assistance.”  They nodded in affirmation.
What started out as a mild annoyance and something to help occupy his time, his quest to figure out the significance of the man in his dreams had in itself become the nightmare. As much as he desperately wanted to deny it, to blatantly ignore it, there was a small nagging part of him that knew the mystery man was definitely more than a friend. So much more.
“Be still! All of you!” He shouted quickly, steeling himself, ready for an attack.
"M-my Lady?" He breathed out stricken.
Tony snapped his attention to the Rhododendron who was now fiddling with the device Tony had worked on. "You could not have blocked me out! It's impossible!" He bellowed.
“That’s what I was going for.” Tony finished.
Natasha barely had time to eject before the aircraft was engulfed in explosive flame. It crashed into the ground with a resounding blast that sent shock waves miles away. The Doom bot was ready to engage its opponents once more and had locked on to Natasha who was still trying to recover from the blast.
Steve stood to greet them.
That heart again… Pain suddenly seared through his body starting at his wrist and ending in the middle of his forehead. He heard and felt something crack again. The sound was sickening like precious glass breaking.
Tony sighed heavily, there was no getting out of this. The bastard had probably watch the security footages anyway.
Steve doesn’t know why her question sent such a jolt through his system. That statement was utterly accurate, he felt like. But not in the way she meant it. He shook his head again.
A destroyed doom bot landed heavily next to him courtesy of Barnes-Captain America. It scraped across his leg loudly as it gouged a dent into the remaining armor on his thigh. He gave it a small fleeting glance as he plucked a tiny part off of its robotic corpse without missing a beat. He vaguely registered Barnes apologizing, he ignored him, favoring the task of assembling the new spatial distorter.
"It's so stunning, did you create this place?"
He went into his first conversation with Tony. He explained how the genius had brought up a valid point in his annoying passive aggressive way that Steve should chill and spend time with his team being that he only had days left. But Tony only wanted to spend time with him. Steve explained how he came to the realization that it was something he genuinely wanted, to literally spend the rest of his life with Tony.
“Ok, good. Listen ok. It is definitely not a piece of technology doing this. I know. Ok.” Tony stated reassuringly while maintaining eye contact.
“Man of Iron, have you finished your temper tantrum?” Thor looked at him completely serious.
“Whoa, No! What am I doing?” He turned to face her quickly. “I should be doing this for you!”
“Freezing to death?” Something sounded awfully familiar about that.
Anyway, that’s all they were able to get out of him.  He said that he had met with Harker’s representative, Graham Rhododendron, once and that $100,000 ended up in his account every month after he signed the contract.  Of course the funds were untraceable even with Shield and Tony’s technology.
“You’re crazy son of a bitch!”  Clint uttered in relief as he leaned in for a hug after Natasha moved aside.
“It was Tony okay.”
Tony gave another hard squeeze and when Steve glanced back Tony looked devastated.
“Is this it?" Peter asked as she gestured to the in progress painting on the table easel. The photo was in a frame just next to it.
Not only that, the whole San Jose fiasco had happened because Dr. Doom was trying to find Harker who had hacked into Von Dooms private servers and stole highly classified data as evidence of the knockoff doom bots harassing major cities of the world. It was also likely that Harker probably had everything Kumin Tankar had worked on, considering the numerous mega fuzz buzz floating about as well. And lastly, Harker had somehow tracked down one of Hydra's greatest weapons, the Winter Soldier.
"I knew it, you are from the future, a time traveler." Steve exclaimed suddenly.
“So you’ve only been dating for a short time then?”
Some of the officials glanced at each other worryingly. After a minute of nothing happening someone spoke up.
Tony was still on his phone but he was also running probabilities in his head. If he could get the professor to describe exactly the way the energy wavelength felt then he could possibly create a desynthasization devise that could potentially reverse whatever it is that is going on.
“And hope for the best.” Johnny added.
“Maria has confirmed that the evac was successful. However, just in case keep a lookout for stragglers. I’ve alerted the officials that we have this covered. They are not entirely convinced let’s prove them wrong. You have two hours, if they don’t see significant improvement, they’re coming in with the big guns.” With that the line went silent.
“Lang, ring formation!”
“Good! Is serious time over now? I’d like to go hit the hay!” Clint grinned.
Clint and Natasha started to discuss what there were going to be doing. Director Nick Fury looked around the table of unruly misfits; they’ll figure it all out. Xavier smiled and agreed with Fury’s thoughts. If anyone had the capability of figuring all of this out it was them.
Because of this odd relationship they had developed Barnes had apparently found himself trusting our genius, as an evidence of his adamant decision in trusting no one but Tony to handle and oversee his horrific and traumatizing operations to get a new battle-ready arm. Trust and believe, after everything Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes had gone through, the operations would indeed be horrific and traumatizing. Tony, in good conscience, could not, would not leave him alone for that. Especially because the soldier needed to stay completely conscious through the entire thing. And of course, it’s the way Steve would have wanted it…
Steve tried to sit up only to have big, strong hands gently push him back down to the bed…bed?
Natasha accepted the answer gracefully.  She nodded in response looking slightly apologetic before putting her usual stoic face back on.  At this Fury responded.
Bucky grunted in response. “I’m always in pain. Pain is certain and the lack of it was disturbing. I’ll be dead when there is no more pain.”
Our genius began to mutter every override code possible. Still the suit was dead. Jarvis had been booted from the system. He could not figure it out. He was on manual, the suit was still on, he should be able to regain control. His override code should be working. Suddenly, the full morbid reality had presented itself when his arms began to move… without his consent.
"Who am I? Oh God, I did not sign up for this." The man said more to himself.
That’s okay.
Steve nodded.
Could he have made up everything? Could he have imagined painting the armor? Drawing his face?
“That’s no way to live, Tony.”
"There appears to be some sort of interference with the spatial gravity."
Everyone started to mumble their apologies and one by one started to get back to work with Steve’s words strong in their minds and heavy in their hearts. This time they all were working more fluidly together like a well-oiled machine instead of fragmented like before.
Steve wasn’t buying it.
Tony Stages a prison Break and Steve gets a shock.
'I love who?' Steve thought mystified.
'Fucking bastard!' Tony bristled.
The paint bottles he had placed by the window exploded in a dazzling blaze of color. He made sure to shield Natasha from the blast the best he could by using his shield already pinning her to the wall and his own body.
"Wait! I don't know what kind of deal you two got going on but I'm going to be damned if I let you take Steve away from me again." He could feel his team rally behind him. "And I am sure as hell not going to let you tear his soul out in front of me!"
Steve nodded in agreement. "Sounds perfect."
“Jarvis, you heard him. Show him what I was doing…”
Bucky barely caught it and suppressed a chuckle. This night had become something neither of them expected.
Steve turned to her, matching her frown. He really did not want her to exert herself. He knew she could handle it but it’s the principle of the thing. What would his mother say, God rest her soul, if she found out he let his heavily pregnant wife stand there and wash the dishes when he was perfectly capable and she could be resting and taking it easy? His mother would box his ears she would. He shuddered at the thought. What was equally frightening was the fact that if he made even one little protest Peggy would ream him.
Calamity moved to sit on the crates as Steve began to pack his things swiftly. After he heaved the pack onto his back he turned to her.
“‘Tis not that simple, we know not what the keystone is or what form it takes.” Thor retorted.
Tony shook his head looking rather perturbed.
"Please! Please just look at me!" Eleanor cried out again.
“I agree, Tony set it up where Jarvis can track my work from start to finish. The videos are fun to watch. I learned a lot about myself and the way I work.” Steve smiled.
Really?  That’s what they were called?
“What the hell are you doing!?” Tony practically screeched as Barnes had just clicked one day rush on a designer oven mitt, fifteen pairs of novelty sunglasses, a toilet plunger, and a ten pound bag of Jelly Belly jelly beans.
Tony sighed then proceeded to bang his head on the table dramatically. He turned his head to the side and stared at the crystal. There were petabytes of information on that thing. The way to create a program, a device to undo her work, to save everyone, is on it. If only he could read it.
"It's wrapped up, Babydoll. You probably won't see what it is until after the wedding." He explained.
"Like a hero." Tony replied.
Steve woke up some time later, his body incredibly sore. He felt like he went ten rounds with Joe Luise… Yep … Nope. It was definitely a Doom bot.
Steve ignored his heart breaking all over again in favor of ensuring Bucky lives.
Steve did as he was instructed. He got to his feet unsteadily then walked to the spring. He knelt down and looked into the water. Instead of seeing his own reflection, Tony's visage materialized into view. He was in his Iron Man armor working on some sort of device. Suddenly, a strange black object crash landed on the ground next to him.
Iron Man, whom he loves, was in danger so he destroyed the core!  Ah ha!  It felt so good to finally come to that conclusion.  Steve’s elation was short lived however.  There was something else even more important.
He took one last deep breath before he dove.  The first contact with the gargantuan zapper was a thousand times worse than he imagined.  Before he let the darkness take him he held on to the mantra, “destroy the core!”
“I had figured that she might have been concealing herself in some way.  A thought had occurred to me when Xavier was explaining that as soon as she used her powers, he felt the force of her intrusion and that the victims and the alien itself was beyond even his own mental capabilities.  I thought that maybe that is why it was so difficult to find her before, that not only could she conceal herself from our abilities but from our technology as well.  Using what the Professor told me about her energy and her force we started developing a desynthesization program.  Although according to the simulations we were far from using it successfully on the victims.  But I thought of, instead, using the program to desynthesize her energy from the footages and eventually the program worked and when the rendering was done her face started popping up everywhere.  And then I called everyone here. The end.”  Tony finished with unconcealed attitude.
Yes that’s it!  Something else so important that he had to feel the pain and break the core.
“Thank You ‘Man of Iron.’ My friends Tis good to see you all!” The handsome golden haired man exclaimed as soon as he appeared on the screen.
(See the end of the chapter for
“When I came to and was me again, all I could think about was the people that died by my hands. Nat kept telling me that it wasn’t my fault, that I shouldn’t think that way. But Jesus fucking Christ, man, it’s really hard not to when it was me who did it, you know?”
“The problem is, I don’t think I did…”
Tony practically balked at being called a soldier but added his own amendum.
“Yes I am, but I gotta figure out how without letting someone get hurt.” Steve replied. The coms sparked again and this time it was a jumbled mess.
This situation was all too familiar. Didn’t she deck him not a week or so ago her being an insensitive jerk?
“What? Got nothing to say?”
‘Right…’ He thought.
Steve nodded.
“Stable. They are scheduled for release by noon tomorrow.”
“Fuck you!” Bucky cried trying to snatch the wand away from Tony.
"I can do this all day!" Was Steve's instant reply.
"Princess Avalon!"
"Will do."
"This is my special place." She answered. "I have decided to share it with you."
Tony viciously stamped back the harrowing tendrils of panic. He began moving quicker, his nimble fingers twisting wires, and screwing in micro mechanisms all the while dictating vocal command after vocal command, inputting the data seamlessly.
He had realized some time ago that he wasn’t healing right. He could see it in her eyes now, the realization. Steve felt that if he thought back far enough he could possibly pinpoint the point in time in which his body was not responding the way it should. It must have been after the fuzz buzz incident, after Calamity healed him and inadvertently created his mind barrier. At that time it must have done much more than he had initially anticipated.
“What? No! Come on, Pep, we’re okay!” He said quickly. “It wasn’t that bad. It was mostly percussive. Hardly any flame at all.”
When the levity died down they got serious again. The next part of the story was not going to be easy on any of them. It’ll be hard to hear and hard to say.
Bruce weaved through the machines and found Steve and Tony at the main work station that appeared to be in a poor state of disarray.
Bucky Barnes slowly turned his head best he could despite the restraints and injuries. His expression was dark and serious.
Tony nicked the badges from the officials and the to began to make their way through the corridor. Jarvis continued to cover their tracks by looping the security footages. Tony activated the elevator using the badges.
All eyes turned to Bucky.
“These them?  They look a bit scrawny to me.”
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Well now at least they knew where they were all coming from. The problem was they could not get there. The little bastards were as thick as a cloud in that area. Definitely way too thick to get there.
Yes, the Rhododendron was at it again.
"Eyes on me, Steve, you're gonna want to see this." Tony smirked mischievously, his voice an erotic timber.
It had been eleven days since the soldier’s shocking confession and Tony had put off this long overdue meeting for far too long, well, considering the end of the world is nigh and all.
On the other side~
Steve closed the trunk of the car with a heavy thunk and hauled the last of the grocery bags into the house. Peggy, ever efficient as she is, had already stored the food away and began to prepare lunch. Ellie was helping by washing vegetables. Steve put the last of the items away and proceeded to steal a kiss from both of his girls. Steve began to run his fingers through Ellie’s lovely golden curls. If he remembered back from old photos he could swear that his own mother had hair like this once. Maybe even when he was still a child. It was so long ago, however. He shook his head.
Steve shuttered in relief. That modicum of solace was short-lived however when the marking on his left wrist started to burn. He lifted his sleeve with a yelp to see it glowing iridescently. All three of them stared at it in horror. All of them realizing what it meant. Steve slowly looked up in agony.
'Almost there. Almost there.' Was the mantra he desperately clung to.
“After everything that has happened,” He started. “You can imagine how surprised I was to receive this.” He waved the letter about.
“Avengers Tower, top floor, where you will remain for the foreseeable future.”
*~0~*
"Oops!" She set her pork down contrite.
“How?”
His deepest and most profound fears had come to pass.
“What did you do Steve??” Bucky was in disbelief.
A hope that they will prevail over this new threat.
As far as they can tell Calamity needs this keystone in order to gain complete control over every living soul on a planet. The keystone allows her to imprint on every single person simultaneously. They figured that’s how she managed to get a hold of her past targets even though they had been successfully scattered across the universe.
“Falcon you will help Torch hold a parameter and give them hell.”
“I don’t care! It’s still delicate work that will affect James on a physical level if you mess up.” Tony rolled his eyes and Bucky flinched at being referred to as James. “And subsequently,” she continued unfazed. “Lead to major injury or even death to you if he unconsciously retaliates.” She concluded.
Dumb ass!
Steve, Coulson, and Bruce both gave Tony their own brand of reprimanding looks.  All with the hidden promise of digging the information out of him later.  Tony just shrugged it off and smirked at them.
Steve almost wanted to smirk when he entered the kitchen to find Peggy with her arms crossed. She tried to look serious and threatening but was almost all lost due to her chubby face and large protruding belly. Her eyes remained deadly sharp, however, and Steve knew she meant business.
The genius’s eyes fluttered shut at the sensation.  The Captain ran his fingertips down Tony’s face and along his jaw slightly tracing the outline of the genius’s stylized beard.  Tony emitted a shuddering breath and opened his eyes as Steve lifted his face away to look at him.  They stared into each other’s eyes longingly.
Then all of a sudden the Professors consciousness was assaulted by a massive amount of noise. Many many thoughts were impaling him all at once. It seemed like a huge crowd of people were heading this way. Funny thing was they all had the same voice. It took a moment for the renound telepath to realize that the assault of many thoughts was coming from one person. The closer this person got the more fragmented thoughts he could clearly make out. ‘Donating Dumm-E – Fury is a Douche Bag – Boring Meeting – Repulser upgrade – More crotch Room in case of arousal…again – Annoying worry wart Capcicle – My awesome sexiness –‘ Were just some of the thoughts that assaulted his mind. His attention diverted back to Steve when the Captain had the overwhelming urge to voice his gratitude.
“See!  She was probably just fucking with you!”  Clint reassured.
"Yes, we were close once." He answered.
“How did you do it? How did you survive after he…”
"Yay!" Ellie squealed.
"Of course, I would!"
"You're…" He breathed, "Still here." He desperately tried to douse the now burning flame of hope.
“Possess?  Oh dear no!  You silly creature why would I need to take a body when I can make my own?  All the ingredients of an average human body are relatively easy to acquire.  Most I simply dug right out of the earth.  This way I can make me fit my true visage as close as possible while blending in with your race.”  She stated as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
"No! How is this possible!? I know I painted him."
Steve looked at her worryingly.
He held up the arm and indeed, it looked something like a metal human skeleton arm with copious wires, micro-hydraulics and what looks like an arc reactor core embedded within what would be the humerus bone.
“That was a shit joke Cap, even for you.”  He smiled anguishly.
They had relocated themselves into a small common room where Tony was now destroying everything in sight.  Steve just let him go.  Letting him get it all off of his chest.  Most of his screams and shouts were incoherent.  But from what Steve could make out Tony was profoundly upset about how the simulation went.  There was a lot of garbage about a lot of the little stuff in his life here and there but Steve could make out what was really bothering him.  Tony was doing his best with a lot of pressure on him and it just wasn’t enough.  He kind of knows how that feels.
The Dr. stood up and began to apprehensively deliver his synopsis.
His head was bound in a bandage and it appeared he had a splint over three of his fingers. He caught Steve staring at him mournfully and was quick to explain.
“Of course, Sir.”
“Actually, yes, I would like one of those lemonades also.”  He said as he gestured to Steve drink.
What was he going to do now? He was kind of stuck here. Was this how he was going to live out the rest of his life? Was this empty blackness all he was ever going to know?
Suddenly the machine began to pulsate and flash. The portal mercifully began to incrementally shrink in size.
“Professor, are you absolutely sure that an extraterrestrial is behind this?” Director Fury asked seeking confirmation.
"Are one in the same." The little crystal finished. Her voice was small yet vast at the same time.
“Stay still my friend, you are greatly injured.” Told him in a deep soothing voice. Steve looked up at his alien friend for a moment. Alien friend, now there’s a thought. Thor was smiling openly at him, apparently happy Steve was going to be ok.
“You were literally frozen solid for nearly 6 months before Howard found you. It was dreadful when we pulled you out of the ice, we assumed the worst. Because of Erskine’s formula you lived. However, the combination of the trauma when freezing then thawing left you with damage that… Well, is taking a very long while to heal properly, leaving you with unfortunate episodes of amnesia.” She explained gently.
“Cheers.” He saluted to the sensors above him as he pulled a deep swig.
“Whoa, whoa. Whoa.  Tony we can’t leave the helicarrier.  How do you suppose we would get there?  I’m pretty sure Fury would not allow us to use one of his jets or in any other aircraft.”  Steve pointed out all concerned.  What was Tony thinking?
“Please, just give it back.” He pleaded.
It skidded over the pavement and gently bumped against the soldiers left leg. If Steve had the strength he could have made a grab for it. But as it was he had lost too much blood and was fading fast. Bucky picked up the gun, shaking violently. Steve could hear the gears and mechanisms in his arm whir and buzz out of control.
“Okay! I’ll behave.” Steve threw his hands placatingly.
Block elbow.
His eyes widened in horror as he can see each and every member of his unit and the second unit bound by one of those barbaric tentacles.  He had to think fast.  He had punched out enough of those things to know they had tiny cores that once broke dissipated the charge.  but he doubted he could damage the core if none of the others manage to.
The child twisted around in Steve’s arms and aimed the sonic pulse at the immense wall of zappers. The pulse shoots out and immediately the zappers start to disintegrate. Realizing with a thrill what he was capable of Kevin wiped his tears and started to wave the pulse around madly destroying all the zappers he could. He started screaming and laughing and crying all at once. It was vastly cathartic to the child but immensely unsettling to the others.
Tony let it all sink in. He imagined for a moment, just a moment, what it would be like to go do something like that. He knew how easy it can be. He runs around in a robotic suit for living.
'Tony?!'
Steve noticed that the same argument was about to be revived once more. Really!? He had to put a stop to it.
They were finally getting somewhere. The others were also starting to feel a modicum of hope in this hectic mystery.
“Stay back.”
Before Steve could stop him Tony continued.
The soldier nodded, bracing himself. It was a painful and wobbly stance but he held firm trying to control his breathing. Tony got close to the door activating a setting on his wrist watch. He nodded at Bucky as the soldier limped to obscure his presence at the wall by the door.
Thor nodded in understanding.
The soldier paused in his rocking.
“Rocky still on the outside passes Ms. Lady on the outside and is coming up neck to neck! The crowd is going wild! They are coming up on the finish line now, and Rocky and Ellie finish first by a nose! Yeah!”
“What do you wanna know?”
This is the biggest case yet. Not only does this "Calamity" have the capacity to affect their own little planet in its entirety but also has the capacity to attack any of the life bearing planets in the entire universe. All of them.
Clint’s eyes widened in panic, then narrowed.
Steve led them south east toward the coast once more. He found another abandoned factory and it was mercifully empty save for a family of alley cats prowling about. It was a small single floor one room structure. They checked all the entry points and found a nice corner that provided a blind spot for any surveillance probes and was in clear view of all possible points of entry. They were safe, for now.
Barnes seemingly sensing Tony’s thoughts piped up again. “I don’t care what you think, Jazz is ageless, you gotta admit that.” The soldier smirked.
Steve absently thought how marvelous it was to be looking into the face of his brother and to hear his voice after believing without a shadow of a doubt that he would never see him again. That was until the shock of Bucky’s response finally sunk in. To think of everything Bucky must have gone through till now made Steve sick all over again.
The doors opened.
Tony screamed on the inside. He would rather not have to talk to him at all but Steve is gone and Nat was probably watching him to make sure he did.
For once, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to completely put his trust in Steve.
Seriously!? Steve was meant to be restrained so he wouldn’t aggravate his wounds. Their specialists said that his injuries might not be healing right, so they were taking precautions.
"I was good enough, wasn't I? I can be better! I promise!"
“Okay, like I said, it’s complicated. Really complicated.” Steve started.
“He was not kidding.” He mused sluggishly, looking up at her.
Bruce inwardly groaned; anything that could possibly bring the Hulk out was no bueno!
“Moron.”  The large one said as he began pacing once more.
Steve ignored him and was by Tony’s side in an instant.
They had eventually arrived into an ordinary meeting room.  Fury, Maria, Coulson and Clint were already in the room.  As soon as the Director realized that Steve and Natasha had arrived he wasted no time in briefing them of their mission.
It took a little over an hour to finally reached the factory.  The screams of his team had died down but from what he could tell they were still alive.  He hoped.
“Oh hell might as well, I’m pretty useless here anyway!” Clint said.
Also don’t forget to leave a review and tell me what you think. All comments and theories welcome.
“I couldn’t!  This is hard for me too Cap.”  Tony visibly deflated.  “Look, I know this is horrible for you but I’m trying to keep…”  He broke off to take a deep breath and force the tension out of his muscles.  “I’m trying to keep you alive.”
Steve nodded.
Bucky glared at him before unceremoniously plopping down in the seat. He let out a shuddering breath of relief when nothing unexpected happened.
“Eleanor, darling, Daddy is right in front of you.” She gestured for the child to lower her volume.
Don’t forget to leave me a review at the end of the chapter and let me know what you think. So, without any further ado, on with the show!
Completely useless.
“If that,” he pointed at the hologram. “Is all there was to it, I would have completed it weeks ago. If the encryption wasn’t the most gnarly thing I’ve ever encountered, I would have completed it weeks ago.” He shouted in frustration. “All of this,” he gestured wide. “Is still an approximate rendering. Whatever is in that Crystal, is petabytes of data. As in several dozen, maybe even hundreds of petabytes.” The genius stressed imploring, hoping everyone understood the magnitude of his near impossible task.
“Zhelaniye…”
He sighed and gazed out the window to get a rough estimate of how the weather was going to be that day. His idle curiosity morphed to God forsaken horror when he spotted the mystery man just across the way starring down at the little black device in his hand. Steve gasped in shock and threw his hands over his mouth to muffle the noise. He hoped to God Ellie didn't hear is exclamation. He squeezed his eyes shut and took a deep breath to gather his wits and courage.
Oops.
“My nerves. Obviously.”  He said with a smirk as he took a hearty swig of his drink.
In nearly no time at all Tony had Barnes perfectly situated in the exam station Tony manufactured for him. This time, however, they had Wanda nearby ready to step in the moment Barnes became overly distressed. And just like their first awful attempt at this twelve days ago, all the parameters Tony set up where the same.
“I. Can’t.  Tell.  You.” Tony enunciated slowly.
“I can take you back to a time that was once lost to you. Or I can simply put you to sleep as I did the others. The decision is yours.”
He watched as a few strays here and there all the sudden popped into five different zappers. They were coming closer too.
“Can you tell me one?” Tony asked delicately.
“You’re on!” Shouted Johnny before leaping from the jet.
“Daddy! You’re painting the suit of armor again!” Ellie squealed excitedly as she bounded up to Steve.
"None of that, Anthony." She smiled.
Angie stood up and walked over to them.
Tony nodded mutely.
“Will we be separated??” Maggie questioned fearfully.
‘Dammit!’ He cursed himself.
“You two are insane, goodbye.”
Steve slowly slid his left hand into Tony’s soft, dark hair still cupping his face as he moved his right hand to the small of the genius’s back to pull him closer.  Tony brought his hands up to rest on Steve’s waist.  Their bodies were pressed together almost intimately and still neither broke eye contact.  Both almost wanted to moan at the profoundly personal exchange of body heat.
By the time Tony got to that moronic bunny he had already smashed the device to pieces with the rock. The pink asshole sprang away laughing like a lunatic as Iron Man landed heavily next to the device. He quickly analyzed the shattered mess to see if it was salvageable.
“Yeah, Babydoll, the armor was doing some very fascinating things in my dreams last night. I had to get it down.”
End Chapter 43
All eyes were on him.
He had no idea what Calamity was truly capable of.
It was slowing down... That heart monitor, somebody was dying.
Steve went into mission mode before he could drown in a panic attack.
A fucking love letter!
“No, it won’t be that way! Think it through!” She whispered pleadingly.
“Come on then.”  Tony sighed as he gestured for Steve to follow him back into the lab.  His snarky brand of attitude was ever present.
He knew they would agree, anything to make sure he was “okay.”
It wasn’t the deceit of it either.  He’s handled so many covert cases to know.  He had been in the loop and out of the loop enough to understand that this whole thing wasn’t because of how dangerous the information was.
“ He started to sexually assault Gloria, many times in front of Jimmy. There’s, uh, a more detailed account that I’m sure Maria can provide later about the kids testimony and medical analysis, Anyway when the boy tried to intervene George beat him good. The bastard was able to talk his way out of the accusations and the abuse only stopped when George mysteriously drove off of a bridge.
After finishing a second Sunday together, Steve and Ellie began walking hand in hand down the street to the drugstore. There was a kiddy pony ride just out front that Ellie wanted to play on before heading back to the house.
He remained looking at the door for a moment contemplating the fiery doctor before looking towards Steve and Thor only to find them looking at him strangely.
“I’m getting there!” He snapped. “Just as- as I was sure we were going to lose you, Calamity showed up.” He swallowed thickly. “I could see it in her eyes, she was coming for you. She removed me from your side like a rag doll. I couldn’t stop her. But then you were whole again. She healed you.” He stopped and squeezed his eyes shut before taking a deep breath.
"I will try." Thor responded.
Just as soon as he was about to turn a corner that led to the last stretch of hall way that led to the exit, the bot managed to get it’s revenge by brutally plowing Steve into the adjoining wall. He met the wall with such force that he broke right through it.
So Steve stood there amongst everybody trying to pay attention. Clint was the one to discover what was going on through a night patrol. He’s the one now giving the briefing.
Steve shook himself out of his stupor. It happened so fast he almost didn't catch it. Peggy's assessment of the man's beard almost felt like she had insulted himself, but he could not figure out why. For some reason, he wanted to defend the man's funny beard. The feeling was so fleeting, however, he let it go.
Gotta keep it together…
The only people left on the top two floors with him were Jane, Darcy, Coulson, Scott and Natasha. Nat was going to be the hardest by far. If Jarvis realized the connection between his movements, then hello steel jacket.
Now this threw Steve a little, he was sure this man was a genius and what genius did not know the year?
“He was my brother. He may not have been blood but there was a good chunk of time where he was my entire world, my only family.” Steve’s smile was bittersweet.
"Why?" He asked with an air of exhaustion.
“Indeed.  How do you like my encryption?  It’s a bit complicated.”  She grinned triumphantly when Tony looked away distressed.  Steve frowned at Tony’s reaction.
Steve was utterly lost, but didn’t let it show. He nodded politely. Ellie’s attention was already fixated on the sundae.
He smiled to himself, ‘Honestly, I’ve got nothing better to do. I like the idea of going out the right way this time.’
"Wherever you go, I go, sister."
Steve took a sharp intake of air as his chest tightened. He was going to die soon. There really was nothing he could do… However…
“So far so good. It feels right to have more weight there. I’ve felt so lopsided without it.”
“That is true sister, we have tempted fate far too long now.” He turned to Steve. “Are you sure you want to waste your time helping us?” Pietro said as he rose an eyebrow expectantly.
And for what? Someone else's entertainment?
“I’m sorry, but you’re making it sound like we don’t risk our lives for living.  It’s not like you’re a super secret special agent or nothing, Huh bird boy?”  Tony came in with his brand of snark.
“Come on Cap, I’m trying to meet you halfway here.”
“Thank you, Jarvis.”
“What?” He asked confused. ‘Mary Anne?’
“I told you I can’t tell you!”
He created a containment field of lightning giving Steve the opportunity to head for Harker. Before Steve could even get close to the nauseating man, he was stopped by the woman. They faced each other unmoving.
Steve shook his head. As quickly as the images came they disappeared.
Tony threw his head back on the pillow, grabbed the other pillow and screamed into it.
“The best possible thing we could do now is to find a way to help the victims. Perhaps we could find a clue as to why or how this creature chooses its targets. If we know that we may be able to predict where it will strike next and be better prepared. But first we need to remain calm and collected until we connect with Asgard for assistance.”
He had sent something!
"But what I found was out of all 75, well 78 now, victims there were 47 present at the same time as some sort of media recording device.  Of that 47, I searched back from 69 seconds after their fall around the surrounding area and found that of the 47, 39 of them had that very woman hidden somewhere in the background.  I know it’s not much to go on but according to the timeline of when and where the various victims fell it is highly likely that it is just this one working alone.”  Of course this is where Clint would have to interject.
Tony gritted his teeth in frustration. His mind already was trying to descend into misery and Barnes’s constant questions were very distracting and irksome. But, he bit back his scathing response and answered him anyway.
“Really?” Tony demanded incredulously. “You know what a fucking dildo is but you don’t know what a Lego is?”
Before he could twist around and fully face Tony, Iron Man’s fist drove hard into the junction of his neck and cranium sending wretchedly agonizing pulses of electricity through the brutal contact. The very same used in those accursed weapons. His vision blurred intensely and the raging inferno that was his very soul quieted. Before he toppled over into the darkness of oblivion one last tempest of a thought passed through his shattered mind and came out as a disgustingly broken whisper.
He held the shield against the door. In a moment what sounded like an explosion went off. The percussion of the device shattered the windows and blew back any loose furniture.
“Sir, I must say that leaving your room in your condition is ill-advised. You should rest.”
They nodded crying even more. Steve sighed, he’s the one that felt like crying.
Night had fallen and the cold was starting to set in. Now that he had settled down between a few wooden crates he had time to really think. His ideas were impulsive and mostly irrational. He ran the last several days over in his mind. He shuddered thinking how close Natasha had been to dissuading him. She probably would have succeeded if he hadn’t received that transmission. He cringed at the thought. He had to get his head in order.
He found his way to all of Tony’s usual haunts without a sign of him. He was glad he hadn’t encountered any of the others. He was on the trek to his next destination, Tony’s room, when he heard a female voice. He quickly hid behind a large house plant of all things. He rolled his eyes at the ridiculousness of it.
Bucky was watching him intently.
“What did uncle Bucky think it meant?”
Steve’s eyes widened as he realized what just happened.  Jarvis issued another alert.
“Don’t you see? This is likely what the enemy wants; to fragment us. All the while keeping us occupied so that it could make its escape.”
The look on Steve’s face went from annoyance to horror so fast one wouldn’t have a chance to blink.
“Oh my god!”  Natasha cried as she darted out of the room, Clint hot on her heels his face twisted in agony.
“Clint.” Was Tony’s immediate response. Bucky’s eyebrows shot straight up in surprise. Tony backtracked. “I mean he hasn’t actually shit in my coffee but that man has no respect for your everyday coffee drinker.” He clarified.
But then he suddenly stopped, deep in thought. “Is it selfish to think that I want to try my hardest to fight Calamity in order to save Jane? There is no place a Midgardian could hide now that Calamity has set her sights on Midgard.” Thor spoke roughly.
“H-how… does s-sending me… back… aid you? I don’t… understand.”
“I did not know that then!” Tony countered.
"If I may ask, what was her name?" He asked softly.
"No further today, love?" Peggy asked from beside him, her voice soft and still thick with sleep.
This situation is beyond fucked up. Sorting through his feelings for Tony on top of everything that is happening with Calamity is almost too much to bear. Honestly, he shouldn’t even be letting his thoughts linger on the Tony situation. The world really needs him to focus right now. And if they all fail, in the end his feelings for Tony are going to be a non issue anyway. Yet here he is, still thinking about it.
His hands still on the keyboard as he felt all hope for their future began to leach out of him. Suddenly, a rock hit him square in the forehead.
“Boy! Give that back, you know not what you are doing!” The Rhododendron bellowed at Quicksilver.
“I am so thankful that you are here Professor, we could really use your help on this.” The Captain added in.
Doesn’t he always?
Steve leered at him turning away to stare at the pale bluish gray walls. He frowned deeply. Weren’t the walls all white earlier??
Xavier was in a state of exhilaration. He was sure that if Steve had not stepped in when he did, he was going to do ‘that thing.’ He was getting too angry and frustrated it would not have ended well. The Professor is usually so patient but at that moment he was feeling not only his stress, anxiety and fear, but everyone else’s too.
The other agents were barely getting back on their feet. He could not leave any of them conscious. He took a breath and centered his body and lunged to the right, shooting one agent in the leg then following up the attack with a brutal impact of the butt of the gun to the man’s temple.
Steve sighed. Of course he did. Captain America braced himself for the fireworks. Sure enough the air-conditioning unit he was hiding behind exploded in a brilliant blaze of debris. He stood amongst the shattered remanence of the air conditioner upon a rooftop that overlooked Von Dooms location.
“No! I want to read it! I want to see what you told that rat bastard!” He said easily slipping away from Steve’s reach.
‘Bucky.’ He thought. But if that was the girl with him, then where was…
“I’ve been waiting for this!” Brock exclaimed in a heated rush. Bucky only stared. “You made me look like a fool when we infiltrated that fucking church and you weren’t where you were supposed to be!” Rumlow growled.
Tony deflated instantly, turning to the screen with a fuchsia and teal spatula.
"Done!" Iron Man declared triumphantly.
He had to think of something quick. He continued to dart through the alleyways still keeping on alert. He thought he heard something as he rounded the corner and made his way to an older section of the city, residential.
It sliced through a flock of birds taking out seventeen of them. Then it continued on, bouncing off of the head of a fake doom bot making the machine drop out of the sky only to land on eight new hatchlings. The shields new trajectory took it through another flock hitting nineteen of them then continuing on to slice through another doom bot, changing the shields to directory once more to head straight back to Barnes. He caught it deftly then turn to smirk at Iron Man.
So, as they settled down into a well-worn and immensely comfortable leather couch in Tony’s lab the genius put on the third film of the original Star Wars trilogy insisting on rectifying Steve’s pop-culture ignorance. Ten minutes into the film Tony was out like a light leaning heavily on Steve shoulder. Twenty minutes in and Tony had found his way onto Steve lap and the Captain didn’t have the heart to move him.
“Oh! I had forgotten I was meant to give her something!” Steve cried abruptly, panic stricken.
“Jarvis! Show me the footages of Steve’s escape.” Tony shouted in a rush.
Tony blinked, still nothing. “What?”
He was never going to get used to that.
That still did not give Steve much reassurance. It was like childbirth was tearing Peggy's body apart. He really did not know how to feel about that. The one emotion he could recognize, however, was fear. He could not believe that they were making her do this without him.
“Right people?” he added.
It didn’t really help that Calamity had been as equally quiet. The total number of cases still remained at 1,039 and as it was the genius was no closer to figuring out Calamity’s code as he was weeks ago. The only real progress he had made, amazingly, was with Barnes.
"What!?" His team exclaimed all at once.
"Is it in my best interest not to know your name too?" Steve shot.
She laughed again when he began to rub his hands all over her round belly.
“You know, you had me convinced, Cap.”
“Even if I did think that, Tony, it wasn’t your choice to make! Besides it wouldn’t work anyway. If she wanted me bad enough, she’d just keep me alive. And even if I could off myself she could easily choose someone else. There’s no telling if she has that capacity and I’m not about to dump this on the next person.” He shifted. “Why put me on house arrest? Why keep me locked up?”
“Just hang in there. We are almost to the surface.”
"What good are your powers if you can't even use them to help people!"
Steve was gone. Tony had him, the Captain had felt the same way… But he lost him.
After Jarvis launched another onslaught to that ridiculous bunny, who kept squealing and cackling, and another round at the birds within range, Captain America- Barnes landed deftly next to Iron Man.
As soon as Bucky barreled out of the elevator an agent opened fired on him. He did not have his left arm to block incoming bullets so he had to stay evasive. He drove his right hand into the side of the agents head and took his gun.
“Thank you for having us today.” He smiled. “Peggy, Steve this is Sarah Maria Collins, my fiancé.” His smile became almost shy. It looked utterly out of place on Howard’s usually confident face. “Maria honey, these two are my oldest friends Steve and Peggy.” He introduced.
Johnny slunk to them.
“Thank you Jarvis.” Steve whispered.
“Shit! Kids? Will do boss!”
"Yeah, good to see you, Frank." Steve smiled as he shook the man's hand firmly.
"How could you?! How could you have done all this? I just can't help but to think about all the people that got hurt along the way because of you! If it weren't for you then Tony and I could have…"
“Just so you know I will never let you live this down, Cap. You were so tripping out. You my friend lost your cool.” At his final declaration Tony started to chuckle which only served to piss off our dear Captain.
"No wonder why I couldn't figure out where I was. It's not so much where but when." He said touching the device.
When Steve glanced over he saw it had a screen of some sort like a tiny television.
“She-e” His voice cracked, Tony took a deep breath and started again.  “She has been very busy the last few days.  According to Jarvis the n-number is now 1,039 from all over the world.”
“Too much excitement, old man?” Quicksilver said, suddenly next to Tony.
“What!? Hey! Come here and say that to my- wo! ow, ow, ow, Nat!”
“You did great Cap. I’m sure we’d all kill each other without you, you know?”
Steve eyed him quizzically.
Steve was usually the most clearheaded and mature one. He kept them all in line and it was a hard responsibly especially when working with someone like Tony.  The Captain was a saint.
"Hey, I just realized something." He said as he held his hand closer to his face in order to inspect her small form more closely. She crossed her tiny arms almost defiantly. "Calamity isn't your real name, is it? That's just something old texts and accounts said." He began sheepishly.
“Hn.” Was the soldiers only reply.
His attention was brought back to the girls fully when Jane began to yawn. Darcy followed soon after.
“Director, it would be of no use to issue that order. Not only will the panic spread like wild fire but you also must understand that if it came here undetected it could leave just as stealthily.” The Professor explained promptly.
“Yay! Look, Daddy, I’m in a race!”
"Oh no! Shit, guys?" He called out over the coms. "Big ugly bird in the hole is dripping some nasty fluid, I'm going to try to contain it." Iron Man warned.
Chapter Nine: Red Sky At Morning
It had been about three hours since 74 and 75 were discovered. Bruce and Dr. Hank had confirmed that the victims’ conditions were in fact exactly the same as the others. In a coma, yet fully awake, yet completely unresponsive to external stimuli. However they had found no new information. Other than that the incredible team of super heroes had pretty much come up with zilch and were losing moral pretty quick, that is until about ten minutes ago.
"You're an idiot." Barnes intoned with a smirk as he looked down at the mess that was Tony stark.
"Okay!"
I think the title for this chapter explains it well enough.
“Jarvis?!”  Tony shouted sheet white.
“Fuck!” Barnes barely managed to pull Tony out of her reach in the nick of time.
“You’d be a surprised.” Tony smirked.
‘I just got you back! Don’t leave!’ His mind and heart screamed.
Thor’s ominous statement pounded through every one like a drum.
'Almost there, it's not too late…'
“He said that you two were still utterly hopeless pining for each other.”
Fear and worry were written all over her face. Her eyes were still wet with tears.
“I am in no condition to lead!” Bucky retorted harshly.
“It’s fine Bucky. You did not by any means come out of that unscathed either.” He said lightly tracing the faint bruising still visible on his friends face. It did not go unnoticed to Steve how Bucky also babied his right arm. He did recall with a wince breaking it.
Gotta keep it together.
Soon after a few meager hours of sleep they had all convened into the Super Duper meeting room to brainstorm and compile everything they have together under one heavy subject, “Calamity.” Everything to who, what, when, where, how, and why… At least as best as they can, which has unfortunately been going on for days now.
Tony wanted to add in his own two cents to that but found his chest felt painfully constricted and he was barely able to breathe.
He looked at Tony’s exhausted face knowing the kind of mental energy it took just to make all this happen.  Steve grabbed the tired genius’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze making sure he understood how proud of him he was at this very moment.  Tony looked up at him with a weary smile.  Despite his extreme exhaustion he was actually incredibly happy with Steve’s proverbial pat on the back.  The genius leaned into the Captains touch ever so slightly.  Absorbing the warmth he had to offer.
“Ok what’s next oh fearless leader…” His smile turning into a sly smirk.
‘Good then!’  Steve thought almost a viciously.
“You know how pretentious that is? You cannot keep me from her. She could blow up the compound, or send a few nukes our way. Hell, she could probably beat me up herself.” He said as he fought the urge to touch the prominent black bruising still very visible on his wrist.
Steve couldn’t get enough of his beautiful wife or his unborn child. They just stood there for a time getting lost in the embrace. Soon, much to Steve’s delight, he felt the arms of his golden haired Princess wrap around them as she joined the embrace. Both Peggy and Steve chuckled as they shifted to position Ellie between them. They remain that way for a moment before Ellie broke the silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Your eyes always turn a pale blue when you get that far off look as you think about your past, the time before the ice.” Tony stated tenderly.
He hoped some quick wit would hide how much he just wants to crawl into a hole right now and never come back out. He had no idea what Tony was thinking.
Steve chuckled at his friend, “I know that look, you’re thinking of Jane now aren’t you?”
"Two? Me and…" Then it dawned on him. "Tony!"
‘Ah yes, there it is.’
Steve took a deep breath to brace himself. Anybody smart enough to understand basic combat knows that one of the most effective ways to win is to take out the leader. Once Dr. Doom spots him, the Captain will be one of his first targets.
“Well now that I have less than no dignity left I think it’s high time to get back to work.”
Steve sighed deeply and grabbed Bucky’s hands off of his shoulders. He held them in his own hands and noted the difference in temperature. He looked back up to his brother’s face intending to engrave every detail into his memory. Steve looked deep into his eyes and was truly thankful to have him here with him this very moment. Bucky’s gaze was searching. He desperately wanted answers but allowed Steve to take time to gather his thoughts.
“Scrawny or not I promise you Tony Stark’s head on a platter.”  Said the man.
Everyone silently waited for her to continue, becoming ever more petrified.
"Four-"
“He told you to stay here! You’ll be breaking a direct order!” Black Widow warned.
'I am overthinking this.' He thought to himself.
He couldn’t help but to think how comical this must be for Tony and the others who must be watching. Only the Thing and Black Widow remain unscathed.
Thor may know something, and Tony and Steve share a little bit of a long forgotten past.
This was just fucking fantastic.
“Or, that time you pretended to be my mother and sent that very convincing letter to my teacher?”
He was trying not to react to have been outed in such a manner.
He busted out of a window to hit the fire escape that leads to the roof.  Once he was up there he could see flashes of light in the next factory over.  Pulses of electricity no doubt.  He could feel it from there.
Steve paused for a moment to think. They were about three miles from the nearest perimeter line. He could do it. He had to.
It was amazing, the kind of progress he’s made the last few weeks. Where before, Barnes was reluctant, even terrified to get near an exam chair, now he didn’t even bat an eye.
‘Well I have never…’ The Captain thought.
"Thank you." He smiled.
Tony had used the device to peek in on Steve's dreamscape mind reality. His first several attempts were unsuccessful. Tony figured it wouldn't have been so simple considering Steve's role as Calamity's Keystone. Steve's mind had, in the past, been hidden from the Professor who was the leading most telepath the world. Tony knew it was a long shot. However, after making a few tweaks to the code he was successful.
Deep in the heart of a frozen wasteland the fat man stepped over the lifeless body of the translator and entered a secret chamber deep within the long forgotten facility.  He looked around the room at the treasures abandoned that he claimed for himself.  He stopped and smiled salivating at one of six treasures.
It was an utter nightmare. Nightmares at all hours of the day, it seems. Life was just fantastic wasn’t it?
“If we get caught they’ll be on us instantly. They will know the moment we step into the building.”
They walked on for a time in silence enjoying each other's company and the ice cream. Steve laughed when they had finished at the same time, both munching on the cone delightedly. Ellie sided up to Steve and grabbed his right arm nuzzling it. Steve smiled and pulled her close as he walked on.
You said what you needed to say and I'd like to think that even if he couldn't remember right then, there is a part of him that will always remember you. Even if he doesn't want to. And now, that part of him knows how you feel." She said soothingly, rubbing the red spot blooming on his forehead.
It was so hard to focus. To figure out what to say. He couldn't even fully comprehend what was happening. He was, however, beginning to understand one thing…
So he let her.
Steve was half expecting for the Professor to weigh in on his new revelation.  When he remained silent, completely silent, the Captain looked up at him.  The professor was just sitting there ever patient, odd…  He was expecting him to intervene within his thoughts and say something like “It is not you they do not trust it is this dangerous matter.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yeah and I promised Steve I’d bring you back alive.”
"That's odd." He mused.
“You all bring up fair points and I do agree with you to some extent however let me put it this way.” Steve paused and swallowed thickly.
Tony watched as Steve quickly took out Scott and Colson who, by the way, were both totally wrong about the Back to the Future trilogy. He watched as Steve proceeded to gather his shield and pack as he made it back to the room to confront Natasha. Here is where Tony paid extra close attention. He listened intently to the conversation and absolutely could not understand where Steve was getting his impression.
"Holy shit that thing is crazy OP!" War Machine shouted in disbelief.
When he hit the coast he quickly found an abandoned factory to lay low in. It was old and constructed out of bricks. Most of the windows were shattered and graffiti covered many of the walls. But it was empty and secluded.
“So, Von Doom has started attacking the Silicon Valley in California earlier this morning. He seems to be focusing on various factories in San Jose. We believe he searching for a specific piece of experimental technology. He has dozens of those advanced adaptable doom bots with him.” Clint said as he displayed images taken just minutes ago.
“Do you suppose uncle Howard could make something like that? Like, if you showed him the drawings he could make it?”
Now that piece of technology is what really threw Tony. Our genius had been working on something very similar to those microchips in an attempt to aid wounded veterans. Yet, Hydra had managed to create something so sophisticated and intricate seventy years ago. Tony was both in awe and utterly disgusted. The more he learned about Hydra the more he came to utterly detest them. Hydra had made such incredible advancements in medicine and technology and instead of bettering the world they hid it away and used it on creating weapons. Tony’s disgust soon turned inward as he realized that not too long ago he himself was guilty of the same.
“Who is after you?”  Steve asked.
“Thank you so much for stopping by.  I had been wondering if the kids were all right.”  He said softly.
The aid bots were already complying to their operating program.  He saw one bot head to an unconscious Natasha.  The other went to Clint who was sporting a few bleeding lacerations but seemed to be in good health overall.
“There should be a deep sea diving suit in the compartment to your left.” Jarvis replied.
“You were right.” God he wanted to throw up.
“I don’t get it, what’s happening?” Steve ventured bravely.
“How close were you? I mean I know what the history books say and what my father told me, but there’s very little about you two before ‘Captain America.’” Tony asked.
~-0-~
“We have been working with the best facial recognition technology we have. Absolutely no hits.” Clint added.
They continued their deadly dance.
"Thank you, lad." Steve said passing the boy.
‘Eww.’ Tony thought. ‘Definitely raised in a barn.’
“Love, it is all right here.” She pointed to his heart.
“Excellent choice sir, truly.”  The waiter stated as he penciled in Tony’s order.
The look of worry and shock intensified tenfold.
“Okay, if you need anything…”
“Omm. Ritchie’s parents are going to be mad.” Tommy said after Steve opened the door and saw the damage.
That little utterance of an age old nickname from childhood threw Steve into an all new hurricane of loathsome despairing all-consuming horror. He was about to lose his brother all over again.
“All right, does everybody understand what we’re doing?”
“Wonderful.” He groaned.
“Show them I mean business.”
Steve makes his escape and comes up with yet another stupid suicidal plan.
Just as the Captain regain his balance after the second attack he was about to round on Von Doom and engage. He turned swiftly to face Dr. Doom and order is team to attack only to be faced with something that turned his blood to ice.
Tony handed over the Sentinel backup he procured while escaping the Raft. There were likely clues in the files, considering the way they had the soldier contained.
‘Ah, there he is.’
“Jar, any way to slow the agents or speed the elevator?”
Some were fighting with themselves in denial. Others where desperately trying not to let go of the barest of hope, for if they knew they lost all hope then the entire world would have lost all hope.
"Hey Dumbass, 219." Barnes boasted over the coms.
Steve sighed it’s just one thing after another.
Heimdall gave them a knowing smirk and opened the Bifrost. Back to Earth they go.
“Captain Rogers,” Jarvis alerted suddenly, shocking Steve out of his thoughts.
“Why is your mind harder to read?” She asked with a scowl.
This was too much! Way too much to absorb. It was taking everything he had not to drown in panic, instead he focused his concern on Peggy and making sure she was comfortable.
Bucky looked pensive for a moment. Tony thought for a moment that he was going to cooperate before,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey, don’t get me wrong, your ideas were brilliant. Just often times stupid and suicidal.”
He did not know how. At all.
Time seemed to stop as he snapped his attention to the source. There he was, a golden Adonis standing on the precipice of a collapsed building with his shield in hand.
“I know who you are. I will allow you here for a short time, only just. Calamity’s interest in your world makes you a liability here. However, if the aid you seek enables you to stopped her, then so be it.” The King said dismissively as he waved Steve off.
She began drawing again. “I got distracted...” She muttered embarrassed.
Steve began to speak slower and softer now. He tried to maintain control of his emotions. Despite his efforts he knew by the end he would be in tears. It’s one thing to internalize it all and another to say it out loud.
Suddenly, Tony's containment field around her that had been containing the caustic fluid's and gases fractured, expelling all of the vile contents. She weaved her head to and fro and looked at each of them in turn as if seeing them for the first time. More caustic fluid accumulated within her massive maw and flowed out of her beak at an alarming rate.
“Thirty-one!” Barnes called out as he sat down in his exam station.
“Fine. This is nothing compared to-“
“I’m so sorry Tony. But I couldn’t let you die. I couldn’t.”  He choked down a sob. Tears were trailing down his own cheeks now.
Steve sighed. All that bitter anguish finally slipping away.
Tony growled as he tapped his forehead against the glass tube that now housed his new suit. He was so sure that the Calamity case was nearly solved, that this whole nightmare was almost over. He had figured out the code, built the desynthization program. All devices except one had been deployed, he only needed to set the timer and of course place the last device on Steve.
Then, Tony felt a familiar oppressive presence. He looked up to see Calamity standing just above the pseudo-void.
"I know this is going to be kind of weird and you can understandably say no, but is it all right if I call you Anük?" Steve asked tentatively.
“Because you’re a self-sacrificing jackass that’s why!” Tony retorted quickly.
Tony's smirk widened. "Maybe, what does this extremely lucky guy look like?"
"Mmhmm. Keep telling yourself that." Iron Man noticed the Captain looking from side to side, scanning the area. "If you are looking for the shield, it is about 800 meters that way." Tony pointed to the North East side of the battle.
Seriously, any interactions he’s had with this guy the last three days have not been pretty at all. Watching Barnes have psychotic break after psychotic break made Tony want to vomit. The kind of depraved things Hydra has done to this man is beyond words. And somewhere way deep, deep down, Tony may have developed some modicum of respect for the guy. When he was lucid and coherent enough to understand his surroundings and what was happening to him, he legitimately wanted to help any way he could. Despite every fucking horrible thing that had happened to him, that has been done “to” him. Tony doubted he himself could be that way. Of the very few times Steve had ever opened up and talked about Barnes, he had nothing but fond and admirable things to say. In a lot of ways Bucky Barnes was Steve’s hero. No matter how much Tony loathed to admit it, he was beginning to discover some of the reasons why.
He grabbed the genius’s face and made him focus.
Wait…
“I do not know how you do it Captain,” Thor started still kneeling on the ground trying to catch his bearings. “To address her face to face like that, all I see when I look upon her face is my very death.” The prince said with a shaky breath. “Every time.”
“They’re fine!”  He assured quickly.
Steve and Tony watched the scene unfold before them tormented.  The Professor tried to get a hold of everyone’s minds trying to sooth them.  But it was incredibly difficult with the extreme amounts anxiety in stress permeating the air and the fact that the Professor got less than an hour of sleep wasn’t helping matters any.
“T-Tony.” He stuttered out. He winced, his embarrassment clear as day. ‘Why!? Why now of all times?’ He cleared his thoughts.
Wanda put her hands up defensively, shaking her head.
“You ready Cap?”  Tony asked as the wind started to whip around them.
A/N: And there it is. All hell’s going to break loose next chapter, I guarantee it. So buckle up and stay tuned for the next chapter. I only hope I do that epic showdown justice. We still have a long way to go to the end however, my only hope is that you all journeyed to the end with me. Until the next time.
He stopped stirring for a moment and turned to her and mock disbelief.
Hydras programming was heinous and ruthless. Even after studying the Journal there was not much they could do. Natasha had developed a strange obsession with the Journal and the man it pertains to. She had been key in deciphering a lot of it. But without the help of those kids, Barnes might be completely useless and the whole trouble with the prison break an utter waste of time.
Steve has a small chat with Xavier and later Tony. Calamity makes yet another appearance!
From the corner of his eye he saw Barnes land on the pavement painfully and rolled several meters as he desperately tried to evade a group of about twenty doom bots. At some point it looked like he lost his helm and blood seemed to pour down the left side of his face.
Ten minutes later he reemerged clean and comfortable. Pepper looked better but still a bit disheveled. She had spent most of that ten minute window on the phone trying her hardest not to make death threats. She sighed deeply when Tony sided up to her.
Oh well.
“Fine.” Was Iron Man’s clipped reply.
It was bad enough that he had to battle himself over the validity of the dream, it was a whole other beast entirely to have that man come and go as he did. Even more so knowing Steve had recognized how the man's face at contorted into pain just before he disappeared. Steve shook his head, trying not to think about it. He put the mower to the lawn and began his task anew.
"Compared to Calamity's code, your encryption was easier than a Shape 'O Ball."
“Thought you couldn’t read my mind?”
“Well, it looks like none of us are getting any more sleep tonight, Jarvis, alert the others.  We’ve got work to do.”
“Yes Jarvis, I recall.”  Tony snipped.
The sound of that awful heart monitor pierced his head again.
“You willing to try it out?” Tony asked.
He threw his arms around Steve to steady his fall. Tony held the Captain's limp form tightly against his armor.
"Really? Now who's the show off?" Iron Man drawled incredulous.
Steve frantically searched for a proper excuse besides, ‘I Fucking hate you right now.’
The Captain blushed profusely at his work. He had drawn that a little after his trip to Asgard. He sighed, it felt like so long ago now. Almost like it could have been years.
Two years ago, sure, they did shit like that all the time but he had hoped that they all had an understanding by now. “Don’t keep stuff from Steve, it’s just all bad.”
“We’ve established this already! Now how do you feel?”
“Tony…” He said in a slight reprimanding tone.
Really?
“Well, give him a little credit, he is a genius.” She replied with a smirk.
He gulped.
He rushed to the child. He barely registered Johnny face planting into the ground just a couple yards from them. He, as gently as he could, moved the panicking children away from Becka. He looked her over quickly, removing the borrowed raincoat and boots. He saw a small seared marking on her leg and realized that a zapper must have grazed her at some point.
“And there he goes.” Steve said exasperated.
“Don’t worry Cap, I’ll find things for you to do that I’ll keep you occupied.” Tony said with waggling eyebrows.
“Well?!”  Steve uttered brokenly, mistaking Hanks silence for a reluctance to deliver bad news.
“I can’t imagine it Steve. If I lost Rhodey I… I couldn’t… Or even Pepper or Happy or you, I…” He trailed off simply unable to conceive the world without these people that he cherishes most.
Chapter Eleven: Lost Inside Your Memory
“That’s good, excellent job Sweetie!”
“Don’t worry, once you make it into town you can’t miss it.” She smiled as she handed the slip of paper to Steve.
In a highly secure underground compound deep in the heart of a restless city a slender figure flitted through the halls urgently.
Tony threw him an icy glare in response.
“Hell, I don’t even know where to start period.” Darcy replied.
Steve didn’t know if he was crying or laughing, he guessed it was a horrible mess of both.
“I think she’s dead.” Natasha replied.
"No, I just… I just don't know how to feel about any of it, at all."
So I’ll post thirteen on my next day off to give you all a little morsel to chew on while I type up fourteen. I have chapter twenty hand written out and I’ll let you all know that it really feels like Steve will be in the 1950’s somewhere between chapter twenty one and twenty three.
It can’t be.
“Stop whining, Princess, just get us out of here alive.” Bucky replied sharply, leering at him.
“Well, Ellie will be waking up soon. Don’t forget your promise to take her out for ice cream.” She laughed.
“How does it feel, Stark?! Bwahaha!” Rhododendron called out. “To attack your own team? What would the good Captain think of you now?” He laughed and sneered.
Tony found the internal bone anchor mechanisms and neuro-clasps were far more intricate than he had originally assumed and that was with giving Hydra immense credit for their foul ingenuity in addition to everything he learned within the journal. Thus, the days he spent analyzing every little component of every piece of mechanism removed from the soldier’s body, including the neuro-microchips. Unfortunately, that meant giving the soldier the time to heal and heal rapidly at that.
“Always, Captain” Wanda said with a grin.
“Thor you have been thoroughly briefed on this matter, what do make of this?” Fury questioned turning his attention to Thor.
Steve started to feel a bit of relief as much as one can in this situation.
“But you’re alive!”
Tony slightly offended at her outburst but all the while understanding perhaps what she was thinking quickly went into an explanation.
“Like you wouldn’t figure out a way out of it.”  Tony quipped.
Sometimes, he hated being right.
“You could be recognized by not only surveillance but the people also. His face is all but unknown to them. He has a better chance of getting in and out undetected.” Wanda added.
“Come on man, you can hardly stand what could you possibly do to help?”
"What do you think brother? Together?"
It was oddly reminiscent of the many times, back in the day, when he had been thrown against a back alley wall.  He shook his head.  Now was most certainly not the time to allow his thoughts to go down that road.  As he pushed himself off the wall rather forcefully he roughly shoved that the fleeting thought of laughing blue eyes back to the depths of his mind.
“That was a crap view and you know it.”
“You fool!  This is the only one we have any hope of controlling!”  The fat one seethed.  “Well? What are you waiting for?  Thaw him out!”
“Gotcha!” Was all the warning Tony got before he was instantly jabbed in the ribs then having something inexplicably wet shoved in his right ear.
“I know, I know.”  He could only imagine how Steve must feel about being stuck in such a state forever.  He was almost stuck in the ice forever…
“Thank you Jarvis, here we go then.” Tony took one last then dove into the sea.
They stared at him shocked.
“I know. You’re not the only one.” Steve replied with a hint of a pout. Tony said something like that not too long ago.
"A deal is a deal." She murmured.
That's right, that's what's important…
“No matter how much you think it, I don’t want to torture you more. So I’m just going to cut to the chase and ask you just one more question, OK? But you gotta swear you’ll answer me honestly.”
"Indeed, it is as I stated before. You will only see what I allow you to see." Tony nodded mutely still vastly overwhelmed from that transcendent experience.
Steve’s mind froze solid at the genius’s unexpected suggestion then shot out a thousand different ways at once.
The genius waited a moment for the soldier to fiddle with and adjust the controls to his liking.
He stood up and began to pace around the crates trying to build up the nerve to execute his utterly idiotic plan. Finally, he took a deep breath and thought, ‘Here goes nothing.’
“You’re an idiot.” Bucky responded instantly.
“You promised.”
“I must be on my way. I am gladdened that you will make a full recovery my friend.” He said to Steve.
“Why can’t you trust us to find him!? You don’t have to keep risking what’s left of your life needlessly.”
“Oh, not by a long shot.” Tony quickly replied. “But it’s a start.”
Steve kinda gawked at them, rather surprised at the levity.  On the other hand it’s probably the best way to handle the situation.
"Oh! I'm so sorry. Let me help you with that." He stooped to help.
“Yeah, okay that’s all bad except, oh yeah, the world ending. Did you forget?” Tony replied helping Bucky out of the rest of the suit.
"I know from your perspective that sacrificing billions of individuals for this seems harsh but it is necessary. The souls that I take from these planets amass to but a drop of water against a vast ocean. The universe is massive beyond comprehension. The innumerable multitudes of individuals out there in the vast universe that are constantly plagued by chaos are in desperate need for the peace that this will provide to thrive. This needs to come to pass. I do not tear souls out of whomever I desire disregardingly or for fun, It is done with purpose and not without limitations."
Steve wanted to breathe a sigh of relief.
“Well don’t let him have all the fun, you have your orders, go get them!” Steve commanded.
When they got along and cooperated with each other the team as a whole functioned on a higher more efficient level. Missions became a breeze. Or at least as much as a breeze as evil super villains can be. Which eventually lead to Tony actually trusting the team with something incredibly important to him, his true self. Well at least a little bit of it anyway. (No one was ready for full on all natural Tony Stark.) They were a family of sorts now, even going as far to live together in the Avengers Tower.
Bucky’s tender expression made Steve want to melt in relief. His look was full of concern and comfort. It was in no way condemning or disgusted. He could tell just by looking into his crystal blue eyes that if Bucky had any issue with Steve loving Tony it wasn’t because the genius was a man, it was because Tony had a very negative reputation in certain aspects. But alas, he had to be sure.
A fresh wave of tears rolled down Bucky’s face and he blinked rapidly trying to clear his eyes of them but to no avail. “I feel the same.” He choked down a sob.
“Oh, mother, I don’t wanna!”
“Yeah OK. That is enough for the touchy feely walk down memory lane stuff for one day or year.  Whatever, I’m going to check on my program.”  Tony walked off to go check on the various programs running.
“Why does anyone want anything?” She mused.
"Oh? Is that what you call ripping yourself out of the world I created for you and shattering it to pieces. I will have you know it was not easy to make and it is now completely obliterated."
He watched captivated as Bucky prepared the needle and began his work of stitching Steve back together. There was a wondrous transcendent, simultaneous symbolism in the act. With every stitch Bucky completed something somewhere deep down was made whole again. Steve then fully realized that they both needed this on so many levels. Yeah, in the end stitching his body was a useless act but this was so much more than that. He found in this intimate moment between them, there were far more important things getting stitched back together than just his broken flesh.
“Tony, I can tell someone hit you, who hurt you?”  Steve demanded severely.
Before anyone asks him to, Thor began to elaborate, “This being will follow every living Midgardian soul to the ends of the universe itself.
Crap!
“You did a good job here Captain.” Fury came up to Tony and Steve and sat down.
Steve rolled his eyes.
“So likely an alien or a mutant is behind these cases?” Steve said slowly as if tasting each word.
"Look, across the way, it's the one before the corner shop there." She said pointing at a small brick in set building across the street.
If I can pull it off then everyone will be more aware of one another, will understand on a fundamental level that every life has value and that to hurt another is to hurt oneself. I want to achieve supreme empathy."
Steve grabbed Tony’s face to make him focus.
He looked just as disgusting as his attitude. He was short and fat with a plump oily face and even oilier orange hair. He had oozing and scabby blemishes on what flesh was visible through his neon pink zoot suit.
“No stupid, the woman called Kettle!”
Tony was on the verge of panicking. Bucky watched him, doubt filling his features.
Tony sighed miserably, "Yeah…"
“Fuck You!” Tony snapped.
He reached up to the device on his temple.  Suddenly everyone was engulfed by a fierce electrical charge.  Tony’s screams were yet another thing he doubted he could ever erase from his nightmares.
“Oh, cool.” Barnes replied.
Fury was beside himself with, well, fury. As he watched everyone hustle about the room his eyes fell upon the seemingly lifeless victims lying upon gurneys, whilst wires hooked them to copious machines that monitored, calculated, and beeped. Those victims were his agents and he is responsible for them. They were definitely showing the same symptoms as the other 73.
“They are bat crap crazy.” Tony affirmed. “Doesn’t mean they weren’t onto something big and dangerous.”
Why?!
Breakfast had been relatively uneventful.  He had a couple of pieces of fruit and a glass of orange juice.
"You are vastly irritating." She stated with a sneer. "I can simply snap your neck and be done with it."
How was it even possible, and what even did Tony mean when he said that Steve had created this world? What on earth was going on? How could he fix it?
"You'll be all right getting Ellie off for school today?"
Though many hid it well, everyone was appalled by the contents of the story. Some retained stoic faces yet others could not hide their revolted reactions to the life story of Gloria and Jimmy. Clint being one,
“Well that’s one way to end a meeting, right Fury?”  Tony asked trying to alleviate the tension.
Meanwhile…
“I need to talk to you about something important.” Tony began knowing Barton was going to make this conversation unbearable.
Now Steve really felt a nauseating, nasty headache forming. He pressed his hands into his temples more to hold his thoughts together rather than to soothe the pain. He had to do everything he could to remember…
How did all of this happen? He was just a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who was too dumb to run away from a fight. Yet here he is married to the girl of his dreams with one beautiful child and another on the way.
“Okay then, Professor? Did you see what happened to the victims?” Tony asked more kindly. He was a bit more at ease knowing Xavier had Fury whipped. Shamelessly, this made him happy.
“Not in the conventional sense.  This body is merely a vessel.”  She commented nonchalantly.
“Let him in.” He managed to groaned out.
“Hey Sparky, tell Jane I said hello.” Tony stated with a wink.
Why was he not worthy enough to have somebody choose him for once?
“It really won’t be suicidal will it?” Pietro asked concerned.
“I’ll call for you, now go.” She smiled.
Steve on the other hand felt like the rug had been ripped out from under him.
He tried to shake those thoughts out of his mind. He was making his escape to apologize. But he did think about it and yeah Tony was going to be pissed. If the situation were reversed, he would blow a gasket. He made his way out into the hall anyway.
“Listen,” Tony said rubbing his throat. “The doors lag. I couldn’t have them corner us like Rumlow did.” He explained. Bucky glared. “Look, I knew you’d make it! Okay? I timed it perfectly.”
Tony grabbed Steve’s arm after Fury had been safely handed off.
"How… Theological." Steve commented.
Then, Tony got a glimpse of it, Steve’s wrist seemed to be pulsating with dark energy. Now that was foreboding…
Tony stared up into Steve's warm stormy grey eyes, his smirk returning rapidly. "Oh? Why is that, Captain?"
“I don’t…” He started confused.
As he was looking for escape routes, he carried his sketchbook around sketching out the cityscapes. As he looked out the windows down and around for anything he could use, he sketched interesting details of various things in his site. He was pleased to note that his misleading tactics were more or less working. Natasha, he was sure, suspected something, but the others were none the wiser. He was going to red herring the fuck out of this.
“By the time we became close enough to understand each other I made a home here, made new friends and found a new mission. So my past wasn’t… Relevant.”
“Stay behind me.” Tony whispered before opening the door.
“I don’t know what the fuck they are! They are roughly the size of a basketball, furry, and they produce enough voltage to shock the shit out of you. If exposed to a normal person long enough, it could kill them.”
Steve spoke this time, “Yes that is why this case is so troubling. They are in fact perfectly healthy.”
“Well you-“
"What!?"
“How did you do that?” She demanded.
“So, what changed? It couldn’t have been my half-baked speech last night.”
A new shocking case pops up! Can Our Captain endure?
The soldier slid out of the doorway stealthily. All of his ingrained instincts were coming to the surface. Tony became immensely uncomfortable with the soldiers blank look and quiet movements.
Happy to see a burger section of the menu, Steve was quick to reply, I will definitely be having this bacon western cheeseburger with the home-style onion rings.  And I would also like a prickly pear lemonade with that.”  The Captain smiled as he handed the waiter his menu.
“Yeah I’m fine!” He replied hastily as he began dodging the next attack.
‘Right!?’ Tony thought sarcastically.
(See the end of the chapter for
Beep. Beep.
The Captain wanted to protest, however, after everything he was too tired to go on. He was emotionally and physically drained. He needed this time to lick his wounds and rest up. He nodded reluctantly and made himself comfortable next to Bucky. He watched his sleeping face for a moment letting his mind go back to the last night they spent together before their tragic mission to catch Zola’s train.
“I don’t care if you don’t want to, it’s your nap time.” Peggy replied firmly.
“So in regards to your funeral, I think we should decide now about the burial flowers.  Do you like roses?”  Tony asked with a smirk.
‘No! It can’t end this way!’
“Yeah, I get that.” He replied as he thought about how Rhodey was his rock after his parents died.
"Oh no!" The orderly said quickly. "Please, Captain Rogers, it's no trouble at all." He said picking up the last of the pieces. "See, all done." He smiled as he began walking away.
Reason one was unsurprisingly egotistical. He needed to make sure his hardware was being handled with care and installed correctly. He absolutely could not sit back and let it all happen without him. It’s like having somebody else work on his arc reactor or any of his suits, it just isn’t done.
“So, what? That’s it? Everything all hunky-dory now?” The soldier voiced.
"And gorgeous brown eyes, incredibly kissable lips."
What could possibly go wrong?
The genius jerked away almost violently.  That reaction by far did not go unnoticed by Steve.  He did not know how to feel about that or even where to start analyzing it.  All he does know is that it hurt.
As soon as he was sure he had the bots full attention he darted back down another hall way with the bot hot on his heels. He did his best to avoid the incoming assaults that were starting to become more rapid.
“I’m not proud of that.”
“Thor, I need you to get Tony out of here!”
Steve’s first instinct was to give him a scathing reply. However, he refrained. He had to start playing this real delicately now. He could not let anyone know what he was planning, especially Tony. So he merely shrugged in response. He did not miss the fact that Tony was no longer wearing his fancy suit.
The meeting room was located deep within the helicarrier. It was triple reinforced and was very stronghold like. In a few short minutes that particular room will hold nine very important people. People that, in their own personal special way, were responsible for saving the world at least twice.
How had it all come to this?
And Without any further ado, on with the show!
“You and the others were-“
“Don’t be worrying about this Cap,” he gestured to his bound head.
While Jarvis reprogrammed the Franken-distorter; Tony inputted manual command prompts vocally.
"Oh?" He said softly unconvinced, shifting their positions. "I see." He whispered slyly.
Steve snapped his attention to Tony.
Bucky was relieved when Steve finally agreed to let him go instead. One of the twins probably would have been an even safer option, however, they knew that there was something that he needed to take care of and this was the best time to do it. Unfortunately, he couldn’t really come out with it and tell Steve what he was planning. He hates keeping something so important from his friend but Steve already has such a massive load on his plate, he does not need yet another thing to worry about on the eve of… well... his end.
This may very well be the last significant mission with his team. But that’s fine, it’ll be a good one. He looked over to the Asgardian prince.
“Daddy!” Steve was startled out of his thoughts. “My friend Patty Jo said she once found a sprinkle the size of a peanut before!” Ellie nearly exclaimed.
Now it feels almost like a betrayal of sorts.  He knows somewhere deep down that his friends really are keeping his best interests at heart.  But damn, they just had to choose one of the worst ways to do it.
He smiled kindly at Steve.  The Captain could only blink.  He heard what Hank was saying but it just wasn’t sinking in.  Hank analyzed Steve’s reaction.
“I love Steve… More than anything. But for the life of me I can’t figure out what happened! How it all came to this. It all feels like horrible joke to me. People don’t feel for me the way he claims to.”
Tony's attention was diverted, however, when two things happened simultaneously. First, Jarvis alerted him that the blackhole had expanded even more. It was now strong enough to pull debris and smaller objects into its void. The second was that the weird death birds had hatched from their chrysalises and were now emitting disturbing shrieks.
Steve glanced at the sheet on the clipboard.
Tony had already gone on and on for days about that incident and how the bruise around his left testicle was never going to go away. The Captain did not need him to start that up again.
“Yeah, okay!” She said smiling brightly.
Just great.
Steve ran into the house and practically flew up the stairs. When he got to Ellie's room she was already half awake.
“As long as the others survive, I will be.” He answered almost darkly. “What brings you all the way out here anyway?” Steve eyed him suspiciously.
“You have these monitors in front of you. The one in the middle here is your control panel. Here you control the cameras placed around the station and their feed appears on the other six screens.” Tony adjusted the displays and began to elaborate. “As you can see, the cameras are showing live at multiple angles around the chair. You can see exactly what I would be doing at any given point. If you see something you don’t like or understand tell me to stop and I will stop and I will try to make it right. You with me so far?” Tony said looking up at Barnes expectantly.
Without any further ado, on with the show!
Sometime later after finishing some of his chores, Steve took the list Peggy left for him off the table by the door and looked it over. It seemed to be a pretty standard supply run list. Buy a whetstone to sharpen the blades on the push mower and hedge trimmers, pick up two fabric bundles from the seamstress, get a case of canned goods from the grocery and go to Cranston (the next town over) to pick up the wedding gift Peggy ordered for Howard and Maria. Steve figured he'd leave that one for tomorrow seeing as Peggy had the car, so he was gonna have to take the bus. He grabbed his keys and wallet and braced himself for his journey into town.
Several hours had passed and Steve had fixed the canvas up a bit and worked the paint into a more suitable background.  His thoughts had landed everywhere.  Mostly, this time, they kept circling around Tony.
“Steve, darling, I believe you outdid yourself this morning.” Peggy said as she handed Steve her plate as he began to clean the table.
He groaned as he gently unwrapped himself from Bucky to inspect the damage. He found as he sat up that Wanda was already awake. He supposed she was on second watch seeing as her brother was passed out next to her. He nodded and whispered “good morning.” She smiled shyly and replied in kind.
Seriously, was this nightmare ever going to end??
Before Tony could walk back to the exam station, Natasha pulled him into a tight hug.
He watched Steve destroy the radio after receiving the executive kill order. Okay, yeah that definitely looked bad.
On the other side, A new dangerous mission erupts. Tony can't seem to catch a break.
“Mommy!” Ellie shouted as she launched off of the counter into her mother’s waiting arms.
It was sunset now, in the sky to the west was a beautiful bright golden orange and a bold brilliant indigo to the east. Steve's heart nearly skipped a beat when he spotted Iron Man's visage right under where the orange and indigo skies met in a breathtaking magenta. Steve smiled reverently at Tony's approach, he could not wait to have that enigmatic man in his arms.
“Leave me.” He commanded as cool as ice.
“You’re worth it to Steve, so you’re worth it to me. It’s-“ he took a shuddering breath. “It’s what he would have wanted.” Tony swallowed thickly and continued. “Look, the end of the world is upon us and there is a 0.5% chance I can stop it, if I haven’t failed already. If it’s all on me to do it, then I’m going to do it my way. Even if it makes absolutely no sense anybody else. You are more useful than you know. I’m sure Steve thought so too.”
"They were indeed." She replied.
Steve brought his other arm up to wrap around Tony.  He was desperately holding on.  He held them both as tightly as he could, very much well aware of the reality that he could lose them any time now, any moment could be their last.  That hurt in ways he cannot even describe.
"Damn, can't win them all." Tony pouted.
“Two hundred yards North West outside the compound, Sir.”
“Idiot.” Tony muttered, rolling his eyes.
Tony sighed heavily, wishing desperately he hadn’t chucked his drink across the room earlier. God, he wished Steve were there. Tony really needed his advice, he needed to hear the situation from the Captain’s point of view. Yeah, this whole circumstance was incredibly complicated.
‘Where the hell is he stashing those!?’
A/N: And I'm back! The next chapter is going to take quite a bit of fixing. It is very choppy and fragmented, but I have an idea on how to fix it. So, it might be a while yet before the next chapter comes out. In the meantime, enjoy this one!
Shit!
End Chapter 48
About four hours later he made it out of the city south towards the coast. He navigated his way through Brooklyn getting lost in nostalgia along the way. Despite the long years since he had traveled those streets some things never changed.
Steve really should have learned by now how Tony was when intoxicated. Something as innocent to Steve like removing Tony’s clothes to make him more comfortable as he slept meant something entirely different to the horny genius. He remembered almost too late as he felt Tony’s hand slip beneath his shirt. As much as every fiber of his being wanted Tony to continue he put a stop to it right away.
“Captain Rogers, Professor Xavier is at the door.”
He set her up on his shoulders as he began to walk back to the car. Ellie began to marvel at all the things she could see from her new vantage point. It was kind of funny how he truly understood her awe.
“Only one way to find out.” She replied mysteriously.
Tony’s mind finally caught up to him and he turned to Steve in astonishment and apprehension.
“Ah ha! So something did happen!”
No response.
He wanted to laugh. This little girl right here had the big and strong Captain America utterly wrapped around her tiny finger. Did he ever have any power against her? He doubted it.
Steve swallowed his fear and stood suddenly to face her.
Steve smiled and nodded. Captain America and the Thing shared similar sentiments about one Johnny Storm.
“Tony look at me.”
"Damn." Iron Man drawled with disdain. "You're a slippery little bastard aren't you."
“Because the Steve I know is an excellent judge of character. He’s rarely wrong.” He swallowed his emotions back. “Listen, the kind of man he describes in this letter… I never believed that I could be that kind of man before I met him. I didn’t know he was paying enough attention to even realize these things about me… To put the pieces of who I am into words like this and claim to love them-me all the more for it…I-” He licked his lips clutching the letter close to his chest. The glow of the arc reactor illuminated the pages, making Steve’s words shine through the paper.
He will never forgive himself for the part he played in Steve’s misery that day, including, the horrible things he told him in the cell just before Calamity took him away. Tony was so hurt and angry that he failed to realize his mistake. The red alert went off and he knew instantly he fucked up. Learning his lesson after Steve escaped the first time he put a marker on Steve just as a precaution and followed him only to arrive too late.
He quickly disconnected the suit from his arc reactor, alleviating the pressure and began to breathe heavily which only served to start a coughing fit.
Steve watched him stonefaced.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
“Is there nothing we can do?” It was Steve who spoke this time.
He couldn’t help to wonder how he ended up in this absurd situation. How every seemingly un-noteworthy decision he made lead him to this point. The closer they got to the old industrial district the more Steve could feel fate closing in. It was both euphoric and at the same time hauntingly terrifying.
‘He’s trying to save me!’
He looked up at her and noticed her eyes were closed but he was not foolish enough to believe she was fully asleep. Then he focused on her round middle. She was heavily pregnant and glowing radiantly.
“The What?” Tony responded quickly, now paying close attention.
"My date, have you seen him?" Steve replied playfully.
“All of them?”  His eyes were pleading.
Steve thought back to a day when they were at their most peaceful. Before the Calamity case had even started. If Steve thought back far enough it must have been his favorite day with Tony. The day was fair and cool with a slight breeze. There were plenty of those big white puffy clouds in the sky and Steve had amused himself by taking photos and seeking out hidden images within their round curves. It was one of those rare days where everybody had some precious time to themselves where they can unwind and breathe freely.
He knew it!
“Hey! Don’t you dare do whatever it is you are thinking about doing!” Steve warned.
"Oh! I see…"
He was eternally grateful for the confidence in his voice despite the blooming tendrils of doubt.
“That… That asshole!” Tony sputtered as he scrambled to connect the wires.
All Steve could do was nod stiffly. He sure as hell could not trust his voice right now.
Tony Stark has been known by many titles. Some given to him through esteemed achievement: visionary, genius, American patriot (gag). Some self-proclaimed: billionaire, Playboy, philanthropist. Others attained through assessment: compulsive, self-destructive, narcissistic. And some acquired through the fear, anger and desolation his work had wrought: monster, terrorist, dangerous. However, his most important titles to date were born of his infernal captivity and his desperation to live and to claw his way to freedom: hero, Avenger, Iron Man.
He quickly grabbed his sketchbook and was further dismayed at finding nothing but blank pages.
The bunny continued, "Seven years." He touched the tip of the blade to Tony's neck.
Bruce sighed knowing full well that Tony deserve whatever he is going to get. Entertained at the idea he turned back to work with a slight smile on his face which irritated Tony and baffled Hank.
“Believe me, offering you such a gift is merciful beyond comprehension. You do not want to be aware of the harvest, love.” She said never breaking eye contact. “Your role as keystone is a brutal one. I suggest you take my offer.”
She wasn't supposed to take anybody but him.
The Professor was also there giving them input when needed, just in case if anything needed clarification.  Some modicum of peace was achieved during that time.  When Steve felt comfortable that nobody was going to kill each other, he started to sketch in his sketch pad.  Before he even realized it he had started sketching that farmhouse of old once more.  He began by working out the wispy clouds of the sunny day, getting the hard lines of the old house just right, and shading in the big oak tree to bring out the roughness of the bark.  He made sure that a few roses on the rosebushes were just about ready to bloom.  It was coming out even better than before.  He smiled solemnly at it, for it was a long forgotten dream.
“Oh God Tony, what did you do this time?”  His mind flashed back to a time when he found Tony locked in a closet with severe contusions and lacerations.
Tony stood frozen for a moment then when the bone chilling fear finally abated he roared, "Fuck you!" At the ceiling, hoping that even if she were clear on the other side of the universe she could still hear him.
Steve leaned forward and placed a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips.
As Dr. Davidson went about making her own preparations, Tony took the opportunity to look at the scans. He took in all of the important details with a critical eye. He frowned when he assessed how much the soldier had healed in that time. Normally, a fast healing rate would be a good thing, a fantastic thing even. In this case, however, it made their work a tad bit harder. They were literally going to have to open up old wounds to get in there to install the new hardware.
Natasha scary.
Now this gave Steve paused and shook him to his core. There is someone out there in the universe giving her permission to take innocent lives? Who gives them the right?! Is Calamity-Anük merely the pawn in someone else's game? Is it some entity calling itself Yggdrasil?
Steve shook his head. ‘Ah, there’s the hands.’
"They were working together!?" He raged. The resounding murmurs from his own team mirrored his own dark astonishment.
Almost.
“ENOUGH!!” He roared.
End Chapter 45
He began to deepen the shadows on the gold feathers making them really pop. He was proud that she had gotten as far as she did on her own. The color of the gold itself was almost perfect. It was the bright Royal gold that looked freshly polished. She watched him work completely absorbed in his movements.
Before anybody else could interject, Tony countered,
“Hold them back!” Steve ordered.
“Oh. My. God!” She gushed astonished.
Steve flinched. He knew what he had to do. He couldn’t go back for the shield. That would leave the children unguarded. They were still too far away to use Kevin’s device.
“Absolutely.” She smirked and stood up on her toes to kiss him.
Steve took a deep breath.
“Really?  What gave you back clue??”  Steve asked incredulously.
“Nah, I’ll just use your mirror to straighten up as best I can. If I can… I look like a disaster!” She exclaimed looking into said mirror.
Johnny ripped his attention from the window and directed it to the group.
“I’m sorry run that by me again? I was fucking a kettle??”
But have no fear I have up to chapter 25 written out in my notebook so once I start getting all those typed out there will be updates! Yay! However, after chapter 25 it’s going to kind of be slow going from there. And you will hate me.
“Thor, will you go check on Clint and make sure he is stable? Remind him why we are here.” Thor nodded.
Steve was becoming more and more uncomfortable with the situation as time went on. It really seems like everything is getting worse and worse by the minute. Even more so knowing that no matter how much information they gain, how many answers they receive, a thousand more questions pop up.
Bucky gave him a doubtful look.
Chapter Sixteen: The Season of Misery
“So this is basically global? Every single person is at risk?” Bruce queried, all the while trying to ignore the hulk thumping in the back of his mind.
However, he couldn't continue on like this.
Yay! Score one for the Avengers!
After several weeks of getting nowhere, Tony had nearly broken down on numerous occasions and used Steve’s stupid method of asking for Calamity to come talk to him directly. But he decided that if he ever saw a glimpse of her face he’d send his entire arsenal after her, knowing it wouldn’t do a damn thing.
Shit.
“But you had your orders.” Steve replied tiredly.
"Sir, another wave of doom bots are incoming. The sensors indicate two hundred and fifty of them. ETA two minutes."
They both began laughing and giggling together. At that moment, the waitress brought them their sundae.
“The beds ready.” Steve said simply, wondering what asinine thing was going to come out of the genius’s mouth this time.
"O-okay." She said going back to her meal.
All he wanted to do was remain in the vastly sweet oblivion, completely ignorant to everything that was happening. But the harder he tried to remain in the dark the closer the light came. The moment he opened his eyes more pain enveloped him. In that awful moment everything came back to him. He truly wished that he had remained unaware of the events that had transpired that day.
