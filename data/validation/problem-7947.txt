Castello Malvagio sat perched on the edge of a cliff in the Palisades, the lights glittering in the fading light, and on any other night, Tony probably would’ve thought it looked beautiful. But tonight, three days since his fight with Steve, three days where he’d heard nothing from his boyfriend - or should it be ex-boyfriend? - Tony was far from the right frame of mind to appreciate the beauty of a recreation of an Italian castle in the Palisades. Not when he was making a journey he was supposed to make with Steve.
By the time Tony added a third finger, Steve was starting to wonder if Tony was planning on making him come like this. He pushed his forehead into Tony’s shoulder and he didn’t know if Tony’s shoulder was sticky with sweat or if it was his own forehead. Maybe both.
Steve sucked a bruise below Tony’s ear with his teeth, before laving the skin with his tongue.
“Thanks, doc,” Wilson winced.
But the thought of meeting someone new always set off a flurry of butterflies in his stomach. And Bucky was Tony’s friend; no doubt he knew about their argument or fight or whatever it was the other day. Was this an attempt at the shovel talk?
“Are we doing debrief now or can it wait until we’re all at least semiconscious?” he asked as the rest of the team divested themselves of their weapons and armour.
Tony woke with his face in Bucky’s neck and Bucky’s head propped up on his own, snoring quietly. Letting out a quiet groan, he glanced around the quinjet, instinctively seeking out the rest of his team. Natasha was in the pilot’s seat and Bruce was curled up in a ball where he’d been when Tony fell asleep. There was Thor, looking none the worse for wear despite the fact they’d been fighting his evil ex-girlfriend in Norway for the past three days, trying to avoid getting hit by one of her enchantments. And directly opposite Tony and Bucky was Clint, his elbows on his knees and hands clasped, his head hung low.
“She did not.”
Gritting his teeth, Steve picked up the pace until he slammed his fist into the centre of the bag and it swung away from him.
“Maybe,” Tony sniffed haughtily.
Tony shifted onto his back, tipping his head back to glance around what was the ballroom of Castello Malvagio and was now a mess of broken marble and dust, several small fires scattered around the room as people lay at awkward angles.
“Mr Rogers! Mr Rogers!”
“Have you told him?” Rhodey asked, and Tony could hear his smile through the phone line.
“Come on, Mr Stane’s about to make his speech,” Sharon called, grabbing Rhodey’s hand and dragging him further into the crowd, glancing over her shoulder to check that Steve was following.
“He can’t. I told you, he’s sick. He can’t go out.”
Steve spat the coppery blood from his mouth, glowering up at Stane. Loathing for this man filled him from head to toe. Ignoring the pain in his jaw and his wrist and his arm, Steve struggled to his feet.
“We should get you checked out,” Natasha said, appearing in front of Steve.
Picking up his pace, Steve started fucking Tony, pushing him towards the edge. The image was intoxicating; Tony, with his head thrown back, mouth open in near silent little gasps, with his hand wrapped around his own dick as he tried to match his strokes with Steve’s thrusts.
“Hey, you’re the one who offered to do this,” Tony snapped. “Don’t blame me.”
“You’re welcome.”
“Yeah, definitely,” Steve agreed, rubbing his hands on his thighs and ducking his head.
Tony chuckled, his love for Peggy’s daughters growing every time he learned something new about them.
“Like Tony Stark, my client was a gifted child. Like Tony Stark, he excelled in mechanics and science and invention. Unlike Tony Stark, he grew up the son of ordinary people. And unlike Tony Stark, he did not make his fortune selling weapons.”
“That looks interesting.”
Almost everyone in the lobby of Avengers’ Tower stared at them as they made their way to the Avengers’ private elevator. Steve caught Pilar’s eye and gave her an awkward smile, only to instantly regret it when it tugged painfully on his split lip.
“What did Pierce do?”
They crossed the street, Tony and Bucky flanking MJ as they approached the homeless camp. Tony’s heart wrenched at the sight of all these people, left with no choice but to live on the streets. This wasn’t the country he went to war for.
Nefaria’s smile turned brittle, his eyes flickering to Steve. “Perhaps you really are perfect for each other. Too bad you won’t live to find out. I have had fun the past few months, but the fun is over now. I’m done playing with the Avengers, it’s time to move on.”
“Or, we could not get out of here,” Steve suggested.
“Good, ah!” Steve gasped, as Tony sucked on his neck, pulling his skin between his teeth and worrying it gently, the rasp of his beard drawing goosebumps on Steve’s skin. “Good,” Steve panted. “That’s, that’s good.”
“Uh huh. Mind telling me who the hell you are?”
Still, he’d never done well with authority.
“Okay, but,” Clint continued, turning to Sharon. “Steve.”
Steve gaped at him. For a second, Tony wondered if he’d done something wrong, but then Steve surged across the gap between them, tackling Tony with a bruising kiss. Tony’s hands shot up to fist in Steve’s shirt, if only to save himself from toppling onto the floor.
“Maybe they’re the exception to the rule?” Scott wondered.
And that's a wrap!
Rhodey nodded.
Steve nodded, then stretched out his right leg, feeling it tingle as the circulation returned. Tony grabbed a pillow, dropping it by his shoulder for Steve to lean on before wrapping his arms around Steve.
“Right. I wanted to ask you something,” Steve declared.
“No. Can’t be,” he whispered.
anything to prove,” Rhodey cautioned. “I’m still not one hundred percent sure I believe you.”
Steve waited until the locker room door closed behind them then let his head drop. “Shit,” he sighed.
“Leave it,” Tony said. “I’m okay, Steve. I wanna hear this.”
“I’ll be right there,” Rhodey promised.
“Might take a while,” Steve pointed out.
Wait.
“Because I’m a disaster when it comes to relationships,” Steve explained. “So, I don’t have them. I can barely keep friendships alive, so I have… no chance with anything more. I’m a mess.”
“Hey Stevie,” he greeted, slapping Steve on the shoulder. “God, I hope we have donuts, I’m starving.”
“We don’t have to make a decision about our future right now,” Natasha whispered. “If you don’t want us to be together, then that’s fine.”
“More than a year.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered, kissing his neck. “I’m here. I’m right here.”
“Because you owe me.”
“Great,” Steve nodded, eyeing the shining mahogany doors which led to Stane’s office. In another world, this would be Tony’s office, he realised.
“I’m sorry,” Steve offered.
“Okay. Come on.” Stark put a hand on Steve’s back and guided him towards the door.
“In here,” Clint called.
“Thank you,” Charles murmured emphatically.
“They’re putting me on indefinite leave, which everyone knows is what they do until they can find out how to get rid of you,” he explained. “But what if I quit?”
Tony sighed but he let Steve pull him backwards until he was lying on his back. Steve shuffled closer, resting his head on Tony’s chest and splaying his hand over his heart. He felt Tony’s fingers card through his hair and Steve closed his eyes, hoping his presence would help lure Tony back to sleep.
“Yes, thank you, Your Honour,” the US Attorney nodded.
Ellie let out a string of nonsensical gibberish, looking entirely serious the whole time. Ari smiled, looking far too pleased with himself in Steve’s opinion, and added, “See? Our pup agrees with me.”
“You have a hearing aid,” Bucky pointed out.
“Okay,” Steve replied, frowning a little. He did as he was told, closing the door before taking a seat opposite her desk and trying not to feel like he was back in high school in trouble for starting yet another fight.
“I don’t want rid of you,” Tony replied quickly and Steve smiled. Then, apparently realising what he’d said, Tony added, “I mean, obviously you’re human and annoying, but you’re the only entertainment I’ve got. If I don’t have you to make fun of, then I’m left with the local wildlife and those birds are assholes.”
Steve snorted.
He felt Tony smile against his chest. “You’re thinking. I can hear the gears moving.”
Tony was a light sleeper, so when the bedroom door opened, he blinked through the darkness at the small figure in the doorway.
He was right.
Thank you again to everyone who has commented so far! ❤️
“Ga!”
“Okay,” Natasha nodded. “I’ll put you in touch with the cardiac surgeon’s office and they will arrange everything for you.”
“Uh huh. So we have no weapons, no suit. Just you, me, a dog, and a lot of wires.”
“Okay. If you’re sure. Cause I can call Happy, have him turn that truck around.”
“Yeah. My last big break up, I kind of listened to the
Tony’s face broke into a grin. “She bought me ice cream. I love that kid.”
“You used to schlep it out to Brooklyn all the time.”
Steve took a deep breath, remembering Peggy’s advice to take his time and stay calm, even though he just wanted this to be over so he didn’t have to feel like his relationship was on trial and he could avoid Nefaria’s smug, self-satisfied smirk.
“What do you think?”
,” Angie read from her phone.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.
It was strange, seeing Steve in a quinjet, surrounded by the Avengers in their suits. But, perhaps strangest of all, was how easily he fitted in. Almost as though he was supposed to be there.
“He’s never been to Chuck-E-Cheese,” Clint called. “That’s a crime. Everyone should have a birthday at Chuck-E-Cheese once in their life.”
“Yeah, I got that, thanks,” Clint wheezed.
“Huh?”
Steve glanced across the room, spotting Tony lounging in the shallow end of the pool, his chin resting on the edge of the pool and watching Steve with those annoying, calculating eyes of his. Steve didn’t have it in him to come up with a smart-mouthed retort, so he pulled off his backpack, yanking the zip open. Pulling out the fish and the plastic box of vegetables, he dropped them unceremoniously by Tony’s head, ignoring the way Tony flinched back.
“Come on, let’s go,” Bucky continued, glancing at his watch. “If we leave now, we can catch the next N train into the city - provided you walk faster than Barton.”
Rhodey studied him silently, just long enough for Steve’s skin to start crawling, then he asked, “Did you get any black bean beef?”
When he was done, Tony tossed the cloth onto his pile of dirty clothes to be dealt with when they woke up. He lay back, half across the pillows, and Steve instantly tucked himself into his side, leaning his head against Tony’s collarbone and throwing an arm across his waist.
“I know,” Steve replied. He shifted onto his knees, crawling closer to the edge of the pool. “I know. Tony. I’m going to protect you. I promise. I will do whatever it takes to get you out of here and protect you. Whatever it takes.”
“Thank you.”
“On it. And… we’re down. You two have fifteen minutes,” Tony told them. “After that, I can’t guarantee anything.”
“I don’t know,” Steve mused, pushing himself up onto one elbow and letting his eyes rake over Tony’s back and, more importantly, his ass. “Looks pretty perfect from where I’m at.”
“So, uh, what’s the verdict?” Steve asked, watching Tony take his first bite of the pancakes.
“We were,” Daniel nodded. “And hey, I still love you.”
“What’s the name?” Riri asked.
Tony leaned down slowly. Anticipation curled in Steve’s stomach as he came close, his hand coming up automatically to Tony’s shoulder as warm breath flickered over his lips before Tony kissed him. Steve’s breath caught, letting Tony push him into the mattress, holding him close despite his teasing.
“Sure, pal,” he chuckled, slapping Steve’s shoulder.
Bucky glowered and muttered, “Bah!” but Steve smiled, catching Natasha’s smirk and relaxed. Teasing, he decided, and trying to make him more comfortable in her own, somewhat unconventional, way.
“They’re married,” Banner piped up. He shrugged. “I tried to tell you.”
Bruce pursed his lips and tried to ignore the lump in his throat. He’d never admitted that to anyone before. And here he was, spilling his gut to a stranger.
Steve was staring at him like he’d grown an extra head. “You want me to tell my husband that I’m flirting with Tony?”
Although he couldn’t feel Steve squeeze his hand through the suit, the pressure sensors told him that it was happening and he’d held Steve’s hand enough times over the past almost-year that he knew exactly what it felt like.
Fuck, it was early.
a social call,” Tony replied. “But more of a conversation I don’t want on the record.”
“With this? Clint, I thought you were being attacked!”
Steve reached into the backseat, grabbing his sketchpad and pencils before fighting to get the car to lock. Rhodey kept telling him that he should buy a new car now that he was a billionaire - literally - but Steve hadn’t quite managed to get round to it. And it was only partly because his head was still spinning at the idea of being a billionaire. He preferred to spend his free time searching out good causes to donate some of his money to, focusing on marine conservation and child abuse because it felt fitting.
“‘kay,” Steve mumbled. “Bye Tony.”
He lined himself up and pushed in slowly, watching enraptured as Tony’s head fell back, exposing his neck, and his chest heaved as he gulped for air. Steve placed soft kisses along his collar bone, pausing to allow Tony the chance to adjust until Tony groaned, “Move.”
“He’s the God of Thunder. I’m pretty sure he comes with his own armour,” Steve laughed.
“Get away from me,” Batroc hissed. “Pervert.”
“See you in a minute!” a distorted version of Sharon’s voice replied.
“I think Steve and I just broke up,” Tony blurted out as soon as the phone connected.
“No, you’re not.”
“I love you too,” Steve replied. He sat back and Tony lifted his arm automatically to make room for him. Steve tucked his head under Tony’s chin; Tony kissed his forehead and held him tight as they sat in silence. Slowly, he felt Steve’s tremors subside, but Tony knew they would be avoiding elevators for the foreseeable future again, same as they did every time his claustrophobia flared up.
“I hate you all,” he announced.
“Okay.” Daniel clapped his hands “What else?”
He loved Tony.
“Yeah, fine,” Steve smiled. “Just… Long day.”
“Okay,” Steve exhaled, climbing into the driver’s seat. “I think I know a beach that should be pretty quiet. It’s about a forty minute drive, but I’ll go as fast as I can.”
“The Mermaid House?” Bruce exclaimed, gaping at Steve from the passenger seat. “You expect me to believe there is a mermaid
Steve bristled.
“Hey,” he said, opening the passenger door and climbing inside. He leaned over the console to kiss Tony.
“Seven,” Thor beamed. “Just before we made it to the gateway, a Boniboo caught up with us. So Loki conjured a knife and stabbed the Boniboo and it exploded,
“When was the last time before April 13th that you were that kind of situation?”
Clint shrugged.
“What?” Steve grumbled.
“Please,” Tony interrupted. “Steve, just… Order a pizza. Please.”
He liked the ER for one very simple reason: both shifts worked well and efficiently and they rarely caused him any problems. Not like Hammer in urology, who was a malpractice suit waiting to happen, or the pharmacy, which always took longer than necessary to get a patient’s meds ready before discharge, or the board of directors who thought Hank should kneel down and kiss their ass now that he was Head of the hospital.
Steve blinked. “Do I know you?”
“I did not.”
“Uh huh, so good,” Steve nodded, sliding his hand onto Tony’s cheek and holding him in place as he leaned in to kiss his neck.
“You want a hand clearing up?” Steve offered.
and we’re both thinking we’re getting completely different species.”
“Good,” he called after Steve as he limped towards the door. “And if you tell anyone about this, I will kill you.”
There was no accusation in his tone, just simple curiosity. Steve appreciated that.
But he didn’t want to. He wanted Tony but he couldn’t have Tony, because Tony wasn’t interested in being anything other than his friend.
“I can’t believe I came all the way to Brooklyn for this.”
“Shh, I’m coming,” he told her. “Impatient. Don’t know where you get that from.”
“Not even with She Who Must Not Be Mentioned?”
“You and me both,” Steve smiled. He stole another kiss. “Go shower, I’ll go after you.”
“No, this is them being homophobic assholes who don’t like the fact that I’m publicly dating a man.”
The rest of the team agreed, Clint and Bruce a little slower than Thor, so Steve sat down again, unbuttoning his shirt with one hand while bouncing Ellie with the other while the conversation picked up again around them.
“Yes,” Steve replied. “Yeah, I do.”
“I’m sick of people treating me like I am. Are you gonna help me or not?” he challenged. His eyes flashed angrily.
Bruce studied him carefully. Just as Steve was about to give up and thank him for his time - or offer the blow job - Bruce said, “Okay.”
. As if we weren’t already doing that. Does she think I like seeing them speculate how long it’s going to be before I break up with you? Or, or being compared to your exes, or having them dig into my friends’ lives looking for dirt on me? I know it’s a price I gotta pay but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. I’m not just Tony Stark’s boyfriend.”
Angie waved him off, already turning back to finish her own make-up.
, Steve thought.
“J, gimme eyes on medical,” he asked quietly.
“By who?”
“Welcome, welcome one and all,” Stane continued. “Colleagues, family, friends. Welcome to the Stark Industries Annual Mixer. It’s been another wonderful year, and I am so proud of the work you’ve all put in. Now, I know you were all hoping to see Tony,” Stane added with a wry grin, and Steve’s breath caught. “But unfortunately, Mr Stark couldn’t make it.”
“Steve?” Angie called after him. “Steve, you okay?”
“Bucky!” he called, spotting him moving through the crowd. Bucky ducked under the tape and rejoined Steve. “I spoke to one of the tenants, she said-”
“There’s only two of them,” Tony pointed out.
Steve lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Then he sat up, swinging his legs out of bed, and crossing to the dresser. He picked up the books, before leaning down and yanking open the bottom drawer, shoving them under his
Tony beamed.
“Because I’m not responsible enough to be a father,” Bucky replied with a mouthful of fajita.
God, Steve would never get used to this. To the feelings filling him up, bubbling through his veins every time he touched Tony. He grinned into Tony’s hip.
“Hey,” the doctor’s voice softened and he sounded concerned, like he really cared, not the false concern the teachers and the social workers infused their voices with when they were dealing with him. The concern wriggled its way through Johnny’s walls, jabbing and poking at his already fragile defences. “Are you waiting for somebody? Or do you need help?”
“No,” Steve refused. “Absolutely not. I don’t want my life splashed across the media any more than it has to be.”
Natasha raised her eyes to glare at him.
He tore his eyes from one screen to another and, unsurprisingly, found Steve in the Hudson, inching towards the Atlantic.
“Why don’t you tell me what is really going on with you?” Frigga suggested. “Boy, you are wound tighter than a champagne cork about to pop. That’s not healthy. Want a hit?”
He hung up, but something didn’t sit right. Tony didn’t just not answer. He’d even picked up during a battle, because they only called when it was important. The rest of the time they just texted.
The car was empty when Tony found it; Happy was no doubt being held for questioning too. Tony would apologise later. Throwing the car into gear, he floored the accelerator and raced towards the city.
“Yeah, Howard was great at fucking people over,” Tony agreed.
Opening his closet, Steve found his urbex backpack sitting in the bottom corner, resting on top of his steel toe-capped boots where he’d dumped them a year ago when he unpacked. It still contained everything he needed for exploring; cut-resistant gloves, bump cap, safety glasses and a dust mask, and a first aid kit. All of which he’d invested in after one too many incidents which landed him in the ER, and Bucky insisted that Steve needed to be more careful. Steve resisted at first, but then his mom agreed with Bucky and Steve caved instantly.
Scott grimaced and shrugged.
“I’m in a relationship with a superhero,” Steve snapped. “He saves the world on a regular basis, so I’m not sure how that could reflect badly on the school.”
“Arnie…”
Steve knew it, had known it since he recognised Tony in the portrait the night before, but even so, the confirmation was staggering. He opened his mouth, then closed it again, searching for the words, before settling on, “How?”
Something shot out of the water, smacking the back of Stane’s neck. Stane whirled around with a glare until he spotted Tony in the middle of the pool.
He forewent a jacket; it was already over eighty degrees and climbing. Checking the door was locked behind him, Steve ran down the stairs two at a time, and turned right onto Wolcott Street.
“That’s almost a year away,” Tony pointed out. “I’m not-”
“Well, I gotta be honest: there is someone,” Tony said, schooling his expression.
“My lips are sealed,” Steve smiled.
“Oh, Steve,” Tony groaned, tipping his head back. When he closed his eyes, he could see moments from throughout their relationship, flicking from one to the next like a seventies slideshow. Tony wanted his boyfriend. He wanted to be home, in the penthouse, their home, with Steve in his arms and safe in the knowledge that his friends were downstairs or across the city in one piece. His head swam.
Tony smiled down at him, brushing his fingers through Steve’s hair. Every time Tony’s nails accidentally scraped his scalp, a tiny shiver danced along Steve’s spine. Then Tony leaned forward, kissing him slowly.
“Yeah, I'll live. This isn’t my first rodeo. Well, it’s not my first kidnapping, I’ve never actually been to a rodeo. Are they good?”
Steve tapped his finger against his phone, twisting his mouth to the side. Then with a sigh, he began to type.
Tony glanced up, realising Steve was staring at him with a funny expression.
“Let me see,” Dr Stark said gently.
And he always noticed.
“It’s okay, you can laugh.”
“Where’s your home?” Steve asked, taking Tony’s hand.
, Steve thought.
Bruce frowned, running his finger over the edge of the page and set his jaw. There had to be something he could do.
She gave Hogan one final sorry smile then slipped out of the exam room. Guilt tasted like bile in her throat. God, Hogan had planned to propose tonight and instead she’d delivered a death sentence to him. He wanted to spend forever with Pepper, but forever turned out to be six months.
Tony blinked. “You did?”
Tony glanced at Steve.
“No, it’s, sorry, I just started kinda freaking out, on the way here,” Steve explained. “Started thinking what if this is actually a catfish situation.”
Steve held open the locker room door for her, wondering who it could be. He’d worked with so many people over the years, especially after marrying Tony and following around the country to different postings. There were a number of them he would be thrilled to work with again, and just as many that he would have to grit his teeth to get through the next two weeks.
He jumped when the bell rang, blinking in confusion until he remembered where he was. The rest of the teachers drifted off, back to their classrooms, the fight already slipping from their minds as nothing more than a titbit to gossip about over dinner, but Steve lingered, watching the screen, wishing he could reach through it and touch Tony.
“Multitasking, I approve,” Tony grinned.
“Wouldn’t I?”
Stark sat up, scooting towards the edge of the roof.
“See? She knows how to ask nicely,” Tony told Clint. “I’ll be right back. Once I find a new coffee pot. One untouched by Barton’s lips.”
He turned and almost tripped over Evie Rose and Zoey again, this time in pursuit of Lucky, whose tail was wagging so quickly it was all but a blur. Tony smiled to himself. Across the room, Clint was talking to Daniel, Hannah in his arms, and Peggy had joined Steve and Rhodey’s conversation.
“You’re just jealous,” Foggy decided.
Wriggling free, Tony kissed his way down Steve’s chest, pausing to tease a nipple, before finally reaching his waistband. Steve flicked off his flip flops, watching entranced as Tony pulled down his jeans and boxers in one go. Then Tony’s eyes travelled from head to toe, taking in every inch of Steve’s skin, and it was heady and intoxicating, and Steve had to bite his lip to stop himself from moving and breaking the moment.
“Something good, I hope?”
“Good,” she smiled. “Can you come with me? There’s something I think you and Peter need to know. And I think you could use the reassurance of seeing him yourself.”
“I wanna help,” Rhodey said slowly. “And I’m starting to agree there might be something weird going on here, but if we’re going to do anything about it, we need proof.”
argue with.”
Tony grinned like an idiot, relieved there was no one but Happy to see him practically bounce in his seat at the thought of seeing Steve again.
The first result was from Psychology Today, with a list of psychologists and therapists, each with a profile on their methods and training, with headshots beside their names. It looked far too intimidating, so Steve switched tabs, returning to YouTube until his heart stopped pounding.
“Don’t let it get around,” Pym smiled. “Who knows? Maybe over time, we’ll find we have something else in common.”
“Yeah,” the guy in front of him replied. “Look!”
, he thought, kissing the top of her head.
Tony shrugged on his jacket and his boots, running back to turn off the TV and grabbed his phone before hurrying out of the apartment. The door clicked shut and then he realised he didn’t have keys.
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupted. “There is a call from SHIELD incoming. Apparently there are fish people attacking Atlantic City.”
Something in Natasha’s expression must’ve given it away because Pepper’s face fell and Hogan’s took on a resigned acceptance.
“We spoke about the press and the concerns about some of the parents,” she began.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Matt replied innocently. “Yeah, sure. I can spare a half hour.”
The Mermaid House is actually based on a real abandoned house in England. Sadly, the pool is a figment of my imagination, although this house does have an incredible indoor pool. Any crazy decor comes from the real house, inducing the Stars and Stripes bathroom, which I thought was very fitting.
“Thank you,” Tony murmured when he was done. Leaning his hands on the back of the armchair, bracketing Steve between them, he leaned forward and brushed their lips together. “Sorry I have to ditch you for a few hours.”
“You broke the internet,” Pepper declared in lieu of greeting.
He watched them disappear into the subway station, before walking back to the tower wearing what could only be described as a goofy smile.
“No. It’s, uh, still awkward.”
“No. A building. Apartment building.”
Steve watched the face off between mother and daughter with amusement; Peggy eyed Evie Rose suspiciously, while Evie Rose blinked with wide-eyed innocence that meant she was up to something.
“Uh, fine,” Steve frowned. He kicked off his shoes, rolling up his jeans as he sat on the ground and slipped his feet into the water. “Tony, can I ask you something?”
“Barton, shave the beard.”
When the elevator doors opened, Steve stalked into the gym, tossing his jacket aside and pausing only long enough to kick off his sneakers and yank off his socks before crossing the mats to the punching bags hanging in the corner of the room. Grabbing a pair of abandoned gloves, Steve shoved them onto his hands, using his teeth to fasten the straps.
“On every occasion, you were given morphine.”
“JARVIS, if you were an evil mastermind, where on this boat would you control your battle droids from?”
Tony spotted Steve’s blond head entering the bar and hopped out of the booth, his arms already outstretched to pull Steve in for a hug. And then finally, finally, Steve was there, in his arms, kissing him.
“Why is it, every time you want something, it comes back to this?”
Steve nodded slowly.
On the subway, Steve held onto the rail while Angie used his chest as a pillow. Steve wrapped a steadying arm around her waist, safe in the knowledge that no one would even look in their direction. This was far from the weirdest thing on the subway. Just last weekend, Steve saw someone dressed as a dinosaur riding the F train. Besides, most people assumed they were a couple anyway, subscribing to the bullshit
“Can we remove these restraints?” Matt pleaded. “Clearly she’s calm now.”
“I’ll call you,” Steve promised.
“Here we are,” Tony echoed. “Steve… I don’t know how to thank you.”
when his cell phone began to ring, vibrating against the bedside cabinet. Steve reached out blindly and swiped answer without tearing his eyes from Moira’s antics.
“Better make it five, to be safe.”
“What is it?” Steve asked as Tony tugged him away from everyone.
Steve grinned.
When Tony returned to the Tower, it was to a news alert that a new article had been published on People.com mentioning either his name or Steve’s. When he opened it, he found it was a ranking of the Avengers’ dating statuses past and present.
And thanks to fireinmywoods for putting into words what I didn't know I wanted to say and for being an incredible storyteller ❤️
“No,” Hank shook his head. “No. Hope can’t be dating Dodgy Darren. She has more sense than that.”
Steve glanced up and found Rhodey staring at him. Or, more accurately, staring at the scar on his leg.
Steve pressed his finger to his split lip, but it came back clean.
Bruce hurried down the hall and stepped into the supply closet, there he found Frigga lounging on the old sofa from the break room next to the resuscitation dummy, lighting up a joint.
“Now, in fairness, you wouldn’t still be gambling,” Tony interrupted. “Because for a gambling addict, you are terrible at it and they would’ve thrown your broke-ass out hours ago.”
And seriously, what the fuck was up with these two? Clint rolled his eyes.
“What the-”
“I got a few good hits in,” Steve retorted.
“Asshole,” Tony muttered, slapping Steve’s ass and listening to his muffled laughter as he left the room.
It wasn’t until he was in the taxi that Tony realised hanging up like that was probably rude, and he spent the entire journey to Brooklyn kicking himself for it. He paid the taxi driver, left the cab, then remembered his key to Steve’s apartment was sitting in the penthouse back in Manhattan. And he couldn’t use the buzzer, not at this time in the morning, not unless he wanted to wake Angie, which Tony was pretty sure was a Very Bad Idea.
“Alright, so, L&L?” Clint asked, clapping his hands together. “Waffles, coffee, brain bleach?”
“Heads up,” he nodded towards the door, where Natasha emerged from the building, a fistful of files in her hand, all imprinted with the same stylised M design they’d found stamped on the crates in the warehouse a month and a half ago.
Clint narrowed his eyes. “You know one day, that excuse is going to run dry.”
Tony turned to him, holding up a hand to wait. Steve nodded, reluctantly releasing Tony when he turned towards the surface.
“You’re not hurt,” Steve said. “You’re looking for drugs - again. You were last week and I remember you because you were wearing a Red Sox shirt and I hate the Red Sox. Get out of here.”
“Very funny, bro,” Ivan said quietly. “Let’s see you laugh after this.”
“Hey, short stuff,” he greeted.
Once Ellie was dried off, Steve dressed her in a clean pair of pyjamas - the ballerina ones from Natasha - then held her against his chest, swaying slowly and humming a long forgotten tune to her, one that his own mother used to sing to him and that he’d forgotten about completely until the first time Ellie cried.
Natasha pulled off the cloth and raised up the box, peering through the front of the carry cage.
“Guess it’s up to me then,” Steve finished.
“You tell me,” Tony replied, leaning back in the water, his tail movements only just visible through the dirty water. “They left one day and never came back. I haven’t seen anyone since.”
“You’re dating my Uncle Steve,” she said in a voice that could’ve been a question, but seemed like a statement.
. Except for the fact that doing nothing left him flooded with guilt.
“JARVIS,” Steve called as he returned to the elevator. “Where’s Tony?”
“This wasn’t how I saw tonight going,” Hogan sighed.
“However, their evening did not go as planned. At nine seventeen that evening, Castello Malvagio was blown up, injuring two hundred and thirty eight guests and staff and leaving everyone traumatised and confused.
“Tony? Hey Tony?”
“Yeah.”
“You’re being weirder than usual,” Steve announced, stepping over Hope’s feet to get to his locker. “But I’m beat, so I don’t give a shit.”
“I don’t care,” Steve groaned. “I just want to be close to you.”
“Alright, let’s head home, fire up those bugs and see what we’ve got,” Bucky declared. “Well, you fire up the bugs,” he told Tony, “Then go get laid, and we’ll see what we’ve got.”
Tony’s eyes softened. “Good luck.”
, with big blue eyes which seemed to take over his whole face.
Steve resisted the urge to snort at that. Budget? What budget? Between his father and losing his job, he was broke. And while he’d resigned himself to relying on Tony for now, he was pretty sure using Tony’s money to buy a ring for Tony was wrong.
“Yeah. Definitely,” he grinned.
“You’re listed as his next of kin.”
“You’re more than just smart, aren’t you?”
“Oh shit,” Clint muttered as Tony crossed to the workbench where a half-finished Dreadnought sat.
“Cheeky,” Tony murmured.
“Wade-”
“When does Steve’s husband get home again?” Hope asked.
“How did that happen?”
Coulson turned and stared out of the window. As much as Tony wanted to push him for an answer, he knew better.
Who the fuck is this anyway?” Tony snapped, turning his gaze on Bruce, who was staring in disbelief at Tony, his eyes flickering from the gils to the patches of scales on his torso to his tail.
“I’d worry more about the prawn toast,” Steve called.
“I mean, it is a compromise that allows you both to win,” Marci shrugged. “You get rid of him and he gets to save face.”
Part of him considered lying down again and going back to sleep. But another part reminded him that he needed to get down to Long Beach and visit the fish market before it closed.
“Jean? I went to med school with her,” Stark said absently. “Huh. She actually procreated with him. That’s disappointing. I thought she had better taste.”
“The plan,” Steve replied, swinging his backpack off of his shoulder, “Is to figure out how the hell I’m going to clean this water. I mean, there are gallons of the stuff. I looked at those water vacuum things, but I don’t think it’s going to be strong enough.”
“Hi.”
“Hey, I resent that!”
“Holy shit,” Bucky breathed. “Steve, you didn’t?”
“Yup. Have fun,” Clint grinned.
“Too long,” Barton moaned.
“Good,” Tony smiled. “If you need me to take her again, just tell JARVIS. Day or night. I don’t sleep much anyway.”
Brushing past Tony, he stepped into the bathroom to put product into his hair, giving it an artfully disheveled look. When he returned to the walk-in wardrobe, Tony was pulling a leather jacket on over his white t-shirt. His eyes widened when he saw Steve and his lips curved up into a smile.
Bruce pulled out his own flashlight and did just that. When he stepped back, his expression could only be described as flabbergasted.
Steve shrugged.
“I must be an idiot, but yeah. I’m gonna help you.”
“You know the rules,” Gary frowned. “No insurance, no tests. Dr. Pym’s orders.”
“There’s nothing from Hannah, I’m afraid,” Steve continued, retaking his seat. “She’s too small to do presents.”
“Shit, don’t do that, man,” Clint scolded. “I thought you passed out.”
“That’s very impressive.”
“You can go big or go small,” Natasha said over dinner.
“And not in person?”
Standing on the threshold of the pump room, Steve gathered his courage even though he felt ridiculously out of his depth. “Alright, you bastard,” he muttered to the machinery. “How do you work?”
EDIT: Look at the amazing art by Charlie of Steve in his costume!!!! How awesome is that??? A huge thank you to Charlie and pensivegrace for conspiring to make this happen - you are both wonderful people and I feel so lucky to have this art be part of my fic. Check out more of Charlie's art over on
“On?”
They lapsed into silence and Steve could feel Tony’s breathing slow beneath his hand on his back. But he continued staring up at the ceiling until a finger poked at the middle of his chest.
“Yeah, that too.”
A notification banner appeared at the top of the screen from Make-a-Match, reminding him that
“Really. What a surprise.”
“I could get used to coming home and seeing you here,” he admitted.
He’d hated it ever since Tony crashed it and Steve thought he was going to be a widower before his first wedding anniversary. Tony liked to tease him about it because in the early days of their relationship, Steve thought the fact that Tony rode a motorbike was really fucking hot. Especially since he’d always wanted a motorbike as a teenager, but Abraham refused point blank to let him climb on “one of those deathtraps,” as he’d called them.
“Looking for you,” she replied with a lopsided smile. “I need your help.”
“Sounds like a plan,” Steve agreed, pulling out a chair from the table with his foot and sitting down, Hannah in his lap. He fished his phone from his jeans, opening the YouTube app and finding the
“Really?”
“Lube,” he ordered.
“Where’s Steve?” she yawned, refilling her mug. “I thought he was going back to work today.”
Steve spun around and found a woman standing over him, looking worried.
Natasha smiled back at her lovingly. What was going on? Was there something in the water? Scott wondered. He’d been awkwardly third-wheeling way too many couples tonight already.
“Excellent plan, forget the champagne,” Tony nodded. He brushed the onion into the pan before setting the chopping board aside and wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist.
“No!” Tony fisted his hands in his hair. “Why are you being so impossible? I just want you to stay safe!”
“Pretty awesome,” Tony admitted.
“Oh really?” Tony nodded.
“Nice one,” Steve grinned.
The wind whipped past his ears and Tony could see the city in the distance as he gunned his motorbike. At least Dr. Romanoff sounded happy about his early return to the States when he called and told her he could start tonight instead of in three weeks when his unit was scheduled to return. Considering the circumstances, she was the only one.
“Oh! You should try internet dating!” Foggy exclaimed.
“Thank you, Your Honour,” Hogarth replied. “Mr Rogers. The events you’ve described on April 13th, they sound… terrible. Traumatising. Certainly not your average Monday night. It must’ve been very disturbing, yes?”
“Clearly,” Stane smirked.
“Good to see you too, Mr Batroc,” Steve sighed.
With a bowl of steaming pasta reheated in the microwave, Steve curled up in the corner of the couch, balancing his laptop on the armrest, and searched for
Tony started imagining what this scene might look like next year. No doubt Matt and Bucky would still be arguing over Christmas jumpers, and knowing Matt, he would make it his mission starting December 26th to find the ugliest, most over the top Christmas sweater possible just to wind Bucky up. With any luck, there would be a diamond on Marci’s finger.
When Steve returned, Tony was redressing his wound. Steve kissed his temple, before picking up the toothbrush he’d left there before. Tony smiled, glancing up at Steve every few seconds and thinking to himself how good and natural Steve looked in his space.
“Natasha gets a cat, because she is a functional human being who knows how to take care of herself,” Tony explained.
The water was green and murky, but even so it was obvious that this was no paddling pool. According to the building plans, the pool was almost eight feet deep at its deepest point. The architectural designs were a thing of beauty, in order to support the weight of that much water. He dipped the toe of his boot into the murky water, running it back and forth and watching the water swirl.
Tony’s hips jerked, and Steve cried out, his head dropping onto Tony’s shoulder.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“One hundred percent. Your call, honey.”
“We had a fight, a few days earlier. I didn’t know if I was going to go but I decided I would.”
Johnny ducked his head. “My dad’s in prison. He, uh, he hurt some people.”
“Because even when I was actively pushing him away,” he said slowly. “Rhodey never gave up on me. I was dying and trying everything to push him away because I thought it would be better for both of us if he didn’t have to see that. He wouldn’t let me. And I thought, maybe, I could… be your Rhodey.” He pursed his lips. “It was probably stu-”
But, seeing Frigga Borson as high as a kited made her night.
“Always.”
“Yeah.”
Ellie squealed loudly, tottering across the grass towards Arnie, who laughed and held out his hands.
“You drank a whole pot less than an hour ago,” Sharon pointed out. “Besides, shift’s over. Don't you want to, I don’t know, sleep?”
“Who are the flowers from?”
positives, huh?”
“I’m not giving up,” MJ declared, clenching her fists. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. “I can’t. I’m not going back to-”
“Really?” Carol’s expression was unreadable.
Steve took a gulp of tea, hiding his smile in his mug, although he wasn’t quite sure why he felt the need to hide it, when Tony was so clearly enjoying himself as much as Steve was.
Because he loved Tony more than anything, but Steve wanted to be more than just Tony Stark’s boyfriend. He just didn’t know if that was possible.
“Tony?” Steve repeated, padding over to him.
Maybe it was a sign of his own problems, but Steve turned and glared at him and asked, “And how exactly are you going to do that? You have a tail and you’re stuck in a pool in the Hollywood Hills. You’re not coming after me. You can’t.”
“How do you know that?” Foggy exclaimed. “Women don’t watch-“
“Your mother had low blood sugar,” Bruce repeated, fighting to keep his face looking as innocent as possible.
“I doubt it.” Bruce looked down at his hands, twisting his fingers together. He should tell her to put out the joint and take her back to the exam room, call Loki Borson and tell him to collect his mother because she was fine. But instead, he blurted out, “I’m scared I can’t do this.”
“No, I did.”
“Luchino Nefaria. Enchanted,” Nefaria bowed.
“Oh, he cut me off. Disinherited me, told me never to show my face again until I was ready to settle down with a nice girl and pop out a couple of kids. I gave him a counter offer where I settled down with a nice guy and adopted a couple of kids but he didn’t take me up on it. Kind of awkward, considering he was, you know, paying for medical school which I was only halfway through.”
“Does she have a name?”
“Don’t I know it,” Coulson smiled.
At night, when Steve couldn’t sleep due to his blocked nose, Tony - without a murmur of complaint - rearranged his own pillows so he could sit up, and let Steve sleep against his chest, an arm looped around him.
“Better now there’s food,” she grinned. “Ooh, crispy beef! Nice!”
“Start a new one, under my name. I’ll pay it at the end of the night,” Tony promised, and Josie’s expression softened.
“Why would you even suggest that?” Daniel exclaimed. “I still have nightmares about the time you gave me food poisoning.”
The Hulk climbed to his feet and roared, grabbing Ivan and tossing him aside.
“Where do you want this?” Tony asked, lifting the items in his arms once they stepped into the apartment.
“I love you,” Steve told him.
“Oh. Hey,” Rhodey blinked.
“I beg to differ,” Tony countered. He ran his hands up Steve’s chest and out over his shoulders, encircling his biceps. “You know what you need? Something to take your mind off of it. Something fun.”
Tony and Steve were walking around the Arboretum when Tony’s phone buzzed in his pocket. Tony wrestled it free with the hand not holding Steve’s. His face fell into a frown as he read the message.
“Hi Sandy,” Steve replied. “Enjoy your vacation.”
“Me too,” Steve replied honestly. “But you left me no choice.”
“Mr Rogers, the principal would like to see you in her office.”
He grinned as Tony approached, leaning down to kiss Steve before joining him on the sofa.
“I’m dreaming,” Bruce shook his head. “Or you’ve murdered me and are burying my body in the Hollywood Hills because that’s, that’s a mer… There’s a tail.”
“Hey, what are you doing?” Tony pouted.
When he returned with their cups refilled, Peggy turned to him with a smirk. She nodded towards Tony and Evie Rose.
,” Tony pointed out. “You’re in, what? A pair of pyjamas?” he teased.
“Whereas you are a human disaster who falls in dumpsters and drinks coffee from the pot, and would probably get scurvy from living off of pizza if we didn’t force you to eat vegetables,” Bucky added. “By the way, did you eat your vegetables?”
“Or we could let everyone else go and we could just stay here?” he suggested breathlessly when they broke apart.
“That’s going to hurt, isn’t it?” Peter grimaced.
He felt sick and it had nothing to do with his hangover. The pictures of them on a date, or the gaggle of photographers waiting outside his work were one thing. But taking a picture like this, purposely trying to make them look bad? It was something else entirely. Something malicious and intent on eliciting shame. And Steve hated that it was working.
Steve shrugged. “It’s okay. Sorry I forgot we had sex.” Besides, sometimes he wasn’t exactly sure that he wasn’t crazy.
Sex helped but it wasn’t necessary.
Tony nodded then floored the accelerator so quickly that Steve was pushed back into his seat. He laughed, shaking his head.
When Tony tried to move back, Steve chased his lips, his hand coming up to grip onto Tony’s shoulder just in case he was thinking about slipping away. Tony let out a low chuckle that was unfairly attractive, and then his lips were back on Steve’s.
“Are you okay?”
Johnny shrugged.
“I wasn’t finished with those teeth,” he muttered, spitting out more blood.
There was something creepy about the window, Steve decided. Something decidedly voyeuristic.
“Menace,” Tony growled, but the breathlessness rather destroyed any threat his tone might’ve held.
She made Steve give her details of every time he’d given Joseph money over the years. Thankfully, by the time Steve was eighteen, Joseph had been asking for more than Steve ever carried, so most of the exchanges were cheques or bank transfers and were therefore visible on his bank statements.
“And,” Steve continued, finding a second wind. “I was Tony Stark’s boyfriend for almost a year and they didn’t know. We could’ve kept our relationship hidden but why should we? Why should we have to hide? That’s not fair. It’s not right. For God’s sake, they should be embarrassed about being bigoted assholes. That’s wrong. Not this, not us. Loving someone isn’t wrong. And would you quit smiling at me?”
Tony tugged on his hair and huffed. “Asshole.”
“Yeah?”
Clint shuddered. “Why do y’all think my paperwork’s actually done?” Phil Coulson, head of the day shift was an amazing doctor, a mild-mannered man, and utterly terrifying in his defence of his shift and his staff.
Stark’s eyebrows shot upwards and he looked up. “Are you thinking of…?”
Steve almost said no just to be contrary.
“What are you, eight?” Tony scoffed. “And yes, of course I like him. What’s not to like?”
Tony sniffed. “I’m offended by the tone of surprise.”
“Hi, Sharon,” he smiled at Rhodey’s girlfriend.
“Okay, square deal, have fun. Hey, Ellie, do you like peanut butter?”
Tony followed where he was pointing.
Steve shrugged. “Just trying to help.”
“Thanks Ang.”
“Shut up,” Hope muttered, yanking Scott in to a kiss.
“What’re you drinking, Steve? It’s on me.”
“JARVIS, numbers,” he murmured.
“Here we go,” Bucky announced, leading the way into an old building and jogging up the stairs.
“You okay, short stuff?” Tony whispered.
“Wait, wait!” Peggy exclaimed, sitting up so quickly she almost fell off of Daniel’s knee. “I just thought of a brilliant one.”
“Tony, come on,” Evie Rose demanded, tugging him over to the table.
Sharon showed surprising zeal towards the whole plan. “I think she wanted to be a spy,” Rhodey mused.
“I like this look on you too.”
“No, I’m not. It was an adorable wiggle.”
“He’ll be fine. Right?” Tony said, picking up his tool again and leaning over the suit. “I mean, he’s a grown man. Technically. He’ll be fine. He’ll be fine,” he repeated. But instead of resuming the work on the suit, Tony stared into the distance, tapping the spanner against the suit.
“Agreed,” Steve panted. He pulled off his glasses, dropping them onto the table where they were safely out of the way.
“What happened to our happy ever after,” he sang quietly. “That works,” he murmured.
Tony’s heart sank.
Steve squirmed, his blush spreading down his neck. His hips jerked, drawing Tony’s attention back to his cock.
made for the heat. But he had to wear them anyway because if he ended up in the ER again, Bucky would never let him hear the end of it. Neither would Tony.
“Definitely not,” Scott snorted. “Relax, she’s just a harmless, little old lady.”
“Hey,” Steve replied. “You hungry?” he asked Tony.
“Love you. Be safe.”
“Course you can,” Steve grinned.
“Morning,” Tony called, leaning over to snaffle a muffin from the plate in the middle of the table.
Steve sighed, hanging his head. He scrubbed his hands through his hair and grimaced when he realised how dirty his hair was. Even before he’d decided to lie on the floor of an abandoned tree house. Sniffing his t-shirt, Steve wasn’t sure what smelled worse; him or his clothes. He couldn’t remember the last time he showered, and he’d been wearing the same clothes for a week.
“Oh are we done talking about Barton? Are we gossiping now?”
“Thought you said you couldn’t dance?” Tony teased.
All three of them turned towards the owner of the voice, a whisky-soaked drunk stumbling out of the waiting room where he’d been parked, the bandage around his hand red and bloody.
“Yeah?” Tony breathed. “Bet it doesn’t feel nearly as good as this. Being with you, being in you, Jesus fuck, Steve. Best feeling ever.”
“What?” Steve frowned.
“What do you mean it won’t start? Did you turn it on?” Tony replied.
“So we know they took him out this way,” Natasha said.
The smell of spices tickled Steve’s nose as he followed Tony into the communal kitchen. He breathed slowly, wishing his anxiety would just go away.
“Thank you Dr. Pedantic. You have been so helpful.” Wade yanked the blankets viciously. Honestly, he didn’t know why he was still here. He should just yank out the IV and walk out the door. And if they hadn’t taken his favourite shirt, he would do just that. Screw the pants, he’d walk away with his ass hanging out, but he wasn’t leaving Dorothy behind. “What are you doing here, anyway? You ditched me with that other doc.”
“More coffee,” Steve agreed, jumping to his feet, and joining the line before Tony could object. He exhaled, blowing out his cheeks, and pulled out his wallet to pay for their drinks.
“He’s an asshole, so you have to punch him?” Tony asked, folding his arms across his chest.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed.
“What’s this really about Clint? Because I’m here, I’m… I’m trying to be here. But I am not a mind reader. You need to talk to me if you want my help.”
“Mhmm, very convincing. Wanna try again?”
He shifted away from Bruce slowly; when he heard the Hulk roar and the SWAT team scrambled to react, Tony slipped between their vehicles, their attention fixed on the big guy rather than the genius, billionaire, philanthropist running in the opposite direction.
Steve saw the moment Tony spotted Ellie. He smelled it too, the alpha’s scent changing with surprise, and it took all of Steve’s not inconsiderable control not to turn away and hide Ellie from him.
The car came to a smooth stop outside Peggy and Daniel’s and they piled out, calling out their
Which was how Steve ended up making his way into Stark Industries the following morning, in a clean shirt and his smartest pair of jeans, following Sharon and trying to look like he belonged there. He accepted his visitor’s badge with trepidation; if he was on the visitor’s log then Stane could find out he’d been there.
“Yeah, we did.”
,” he deadpanned. “I am having the time of my life. Excuse me!” he called to a passing nurse. “Can you take a selfie of me and my friend? I want to commemorate this moment forever.”
They stumbled into Steve’s bedroom, pausing only long enough for Steve to fish for the door and slam it closed behind them, before falling onto the bed in a tangle of limbs. Tony mouthed at Steve’s neck, rucking Steve’s shirt up until he had to pull back, just long enough to yank Steve’s shirt over his head and toss it aside, leaving Steve’s perfect chest on display.
“That’s disgusting,” Steve informed her. “And people.”
“Yeah. If you want,” Tony smiled. “Or, if living in Brooklyn is a dealbreaker for you, I’m open to discussion about it.”
“Backwashed the filter.”
“My apologies,” Tony’s mouth twitched.
“It might still be,” Angie grinned, wiggling her eyebrows, before ducking into the car as Tony held open the door. Steve climbed in after her, Tony on his heels, and settled into his boyfriend’s side.
“I am not.”
“Why didn’t you just buy traps?” Steve asked.
“There’s no job, is there?” Tony grinned.
The pizza arrived as he was drying his hair. Slinging the towel around his neck, Steve tipped the delivery guy and collapsed onto the couch. Exhaustion began to creep in and he managed to eat half the pizza before his eyelids started to dip. Putting the remainder of the pizza in the fridge for later, Steve stumbled through to his bedroom and fell face first into bed, where he slept soundly for the first time in a year.
“I think I saw that.”
“Okay.”
But he didn’t. He returned to the notification list, and to read the second notification.
“I am so sorry,” Steve whispered. He wished fervently for the power to go back in time, to stop Maria Stark and her team from getting their grubby hands on Tony.
“You’re the one who let me blow you in that bathroom,” Steve retorted.
“I wouldn’t say no ulterior motive,” Steve grinned and Tony barked out another laugh. His hand slipped onto Steve’s ass, pushing him closer until they were practically on top of each other, highlighting the height difference between them. Steve cradled Tony’s head in his hands and kissed him, pouring his desire and love into the kiss. Tony’s hands held him in place, as though Steve could want to be anywhere other than in Tony’s arms, digging into his skin just on the right side of painful.
Steve held out his hand and Tony took his gladly, winding their fingers together and squeezing it gently.
Maybe?
Then Tony was gone, stepping back with a shit-eating grin on his face.
“This might be the weirdest courting gift ever,” he said quietly.
The three of them followed her directions. Tony swallowed and breathed slowly, the smell growing stronger further under the overpass. He noticed MJ ducking her head and fighting not to cover her nose.
“Um, was there a hurricane that I missed?”
“Uh, the press? My co-workers. My students.”
, he thought.
Part of Steve’s brain way yelling
“You didn’t just laugh,” Barton corrected him. “You made me into a meme.”
“No, we wouldn’t,” Daniel agreed, taking a sip of his beer. “Come on, Steve. Tony is a billionaire superhero and you’re…”
“Totally understandable.”
“As you can see,” Romanoff said, “Stark’s fitting in already.”
“I’m here,” Steve gasped, swimming forward.
“Right. And how do I do that?”
“Okay, I gotta let you go if we’re going to eat tonight,” Tony announced, patting Steve’s chest. Steve stepped back reluctantly, climbing onto a high stool to watch Tony work.
“Doctors are scary,” Clint shrugged, tossing a piece of popcorn in the air and catching it in his mouth while Ellie stared in awe.
There was a rap at the door then it opened and Tony Stark walked in, in a sharp suit and pulling off a pair of sunglasses with an easy smile on his face.
“Thank you,” Matt said, his voice thick. “Thank you for listening to us.”
Steve caught Tony’s face and pulled their lips together. Tony let out a sigh, a little huff of breath. Steve felt the shiver run down Tony’s spine in the way his arm tightened around Steve’s waist. It set off a burst of tingles beneath his skin. Steve pushed forward with renewed vigour. As they kissed, he heard the
“Uh, no,” Tony called back, wincing. He squirted the shampoo onto his hands, and if he felt better knowing he would spend the day smelling like Steve, well, that was his business and no would ever know, right?
Steve shrugged. “Seems as good a place as any. They’re good people. If kinda dumb.”
“Oh, I think we can make it work,” Steve assured him with a grin, drawing Tony in for a kiss.
They lapsed into silence, grinning stupidly at each other, until Tony shook himself and said, “So coffee.”
“Oh,” Evie Rose hummed, sucking on her spoon. “Uncle Steve once climbed a tree to rescue this cat. It was a really smelly cat, and it wasn’t very nice. It scratched my sister once, and she was crying and everything.”
“Bro, shut up!” Ivan exclaimed. “You steal building. First dog, then building. Why steal building, bro?”
Steve watched Tony march towards the door, watched him yank it open and storm out, leaving Steve alone in the apartment with only the echo of the door.
“I thought I lost you,” Tony whispered. “I was really scared, Steve.”
“And?” Steve urged.
Steve was watching him with an intensity to rival the hardest thrust of his hips. Cupping the back of Steve’s neck with one hand, Tony pulled him closer and mouthed his way up the column of Steve’s neck. The breathy little sighs coming from Steve left him light-headed. He ran his fingers down the bumps of Steve’s spine, using just enough pressure that Tony knew there would be faint red lines from his nails marking Steve’s skin.
“Maybe you’ll get matched with him,” Angie teased
SPOILERY WARNINGS: discussion of misogynistic behaviour and potential assault. If you're unsure, there's a summary in the notes at the bottom.
“Tony,” he gasped.
Rolling over, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony, buried his face between his shoulder blades, and drifted off to the sound of Tony’s breathing.
“I thought he knew,” Tony replied, holding up his hands. “Didn’t you tell him?”
Instead of answering, Steve swung a leg over Tony’s hips, settling himself in his lap and leaning down to kiss him slowly. Tony’s hands gripped his hips, and Steve felt himself relax the longer they made out on the couch.
“Tony sent them to me at work,” Steve smiled.
Steve glared at him. “You’re not helping.”
“Uh, here.” He handed her the notes. “There’s nothing there. Nothing significant anyway.” And just like that, the anger and frustration came flooding back at full force. “I’m missing something,” he muttered. “I know I am. I, I have to be!”
“Wait,” Steve interrupted. “Do you mean being the one who’s taken the shot, or being the one the shot was taken off of?”
Darren Cross was the head of dermatology and known throughout the hospital as Dodgy Darren thanks to his inability to understand social cues, like when someone wasn’t interested in him. He had a habit of asking out the female members of staff and couldn’t see that it might be considered an abuse of power.
“Tony? Tony!” Bucky shouted.
“Lucky?” Steve dropped to a crouch, rubbing the dog’s neck. “Hey buddy, where’s Clint? Where’s Tony?”
There was a pause, punctuated by the sizzle of the butter in the pan, and Tony could practically hear Pepper psyching herself up.
“Whose fault is it?”
“Of course,” Steve nodded. “Hey,
Tony inhaled sharply, glancing between Steve’s wrist and his face. Hope flickered in his eyes, like he was afraid to believe that this was really happening.
Tony wouldn’t. He wouldn’t do that.
He finished tidying up the bathroom after his shower and padded into the kitchen in search of something to eat. Grabbing a pot of pasta, he stuck it into the microwave and hopped up onto the counter to wait for it, pulling out his phone and messaging Bucky.
“Thanks,” Steve replied, and he appeared pleased.
were writing about him and filling in the gaps where they couldn’t find the information they wanted.
But then Tony spotted Bucky snoring against his locker and rolled his eyes, crossing the changing room and shaking him awake. He heaved Bucky over his shoulder. “Come on, Sleeping Beauty. Bedtime. If you’re lucky, your boy toy will kiss you awake in the morning. Afternoon. Whenever.”
“My mom’s name was Nia Jones,” MJ blurted out.
“You gonna make me do all the work?” Tony teased, kissing Steve’s neck.
He waited until Matt’s hand wrapped around his bicep, before heading over to the two stools in the front window.
And then Tony had no choice but to kiss him again.
“Thank you,” she said.
“I definitely do,” Tony nodded. “But I’d hate you less if you got a round in,” he added, lifting his near-empty glass.
“I like being tied up,” he admitted. “As long as it’s consensual. He taught me how to get out of handcuffs because that’s basic good practise. You should always be able to get free. But on April 13th, I did not consent to being handcuffed, nor did I consent to being kidnapped.”
Finally they made it to the doors of the courthouse and they stepped into the cool marble of the atrium, the shouts of the reporters, relegated to wait outside, echoing behind them. Only then did Steve feel like he could breathe again. He unclenched his jaw, letting the tension bleed out.
“She’s still part of it,” Dr. Stark replied. “It’s just all in her mind. I can guarantee she’s picturing the worst case scenario every day she doesn’t see or hear from you. You always hear that bullshit of
Tony didn’t answer right away. Steve gave him a moment, before poking him in the thigh.
“Is that a Hispanic Scott Baio?”
Steve’s eyes flickered around the room, assessing which door would be his best chance of escape. The corridor to the library was closest but a dead end. He could cut through the kitchens, but it was a risk. Stane was closer to the hall that would take him to the pool. And the front door was locked shut behind Steve.
“That sounds amazing,” Tony agreed.
“I’d agree with that,” Natasha nodded, thinking of Sharon as she noted Hogan’s still high blood pressure on his chart.
“What? No,” Steve exclaimed.
Dr. Stark laughed. “Yeah, they really are.”
Wilson hissed, breathing heavily. “Shit. That hurts like the
“You didn’t divorce him, did you? Cause you are never going to find anyone as good for you as him. Don’t know what it is, but somehow you two just work. Shouldn’t, but you do.”
Until strong hands slipped underneath his arms and yanked him upwards, breaking the surface. Tony gasped for air, despite the fact he could breathe easily underwater while in the suit, his fingers scrabbling at Steve’s shoulders.
“Stevie, I distinctly remember you saying that with a bleeding nose, a black eye and what turned out to be a fractured wrist,” Arnie pointed out, fixing Steve with a look. “You’ll forgive me if I don’t believe you on that one.”
He stayed there with her in his arms until he was sure that she was asleep, then lingered for several minutes longer, scenting her and leaning his cheek against her silky soft hair.
Because Steve had his hands hooked under his knees, baring himself to Tony, watching him with hooded eyes. Tony crawled onto the bed, mesmerised, grabbing a pillow and placing it under Steve’s hips for support.
“Aw, come on, Barton,” Tony called. “We’ve all done dumb stuff. Not me, obviously, because I’m perfect.”
“So, what’s got your knickers in a twist?” she asked around a mouthful of burrito.
“Sure, be right there,” he replied. “I gotta go,” he told Tony. “I’ll see you after the shift.”
“Sure,” Steve nodded.
“That’s, uh…”
Tony was adjusting his tie when his phone buzzed on the other side of the wardrobe, where it was charging. Grabbing his jacket on the way, he picked it up expecting a message from Steve, who was out with Daniel for the afternoon.
“So?”
“Hi,” she replied. “I heard.”
“Just back to my car,” Steve explained. “I got some new sand for the filter. I’ll be back in ten minutes.”
Steve froze, before spinning towards the screen. He elbowed his way through the throng until he could see the screen and his heart stopped.
“Tony, I really like you,” he admitted. “I gotta be honest, my last relationship - which I do not talk about - it ended… I can’t even say it ended badly, because it just ended. And I never got an explanation. And it’s not that I think you’ll do that, I don’t, I just… I’m wary.”
Steve blinked at the ceiling, willing his brain back online for something other than the loop of
“Sure,” Steve nodded. “Sounds like a plan.”
(That was a serious oversight.)
“Your house?” Steve echoed.
“Are we really going to get into a pissing contest of
“What? No,” Steve shook his head. “Okay, but, are you- You see- Are you sleeping with anyone else? Because some people think it’s the same thing, but it’s not, and I don’t wanna- I’m sorry, I’m just-”
“Not in the kitchen, we don’t,” Angie replied.
“So what if I did?” Steve smirked. “It’s working.”
“Mhmm. Very much.”
“Does it count if I didn’t want to?”
“Well, um, I was helping Dr. Pym with a patient and she’s been having these episodes of psychosis for two years. She’s been to every psychiatrist in the city and on every medication possible - you should see her file, I’ve read smaller medical textbooks - and, and they all say that it’s, uh, a result of her assault which, I, I don’t think they’re right. Now, I don’t have any medical reason to back this up, I just, I feel it. In my gut. And… And I wanna run some tests. Please. If that’s okay.”
“Shut up,” Tony laughed, even as he revelled in the good-natured teasing. “I haven’t even said
At the end of the day, Steve picked up the flowers carefully, taking care with them on the subway and thanking his lucky stars he’d decided against taking his bike to work that morning.
“So?” she shot back. “Mom always says you shouldn’t make sumptions about people-“
Pulling away slowly, Tony fought to catch his breath. When he opened his eyes, he was relieved and delighted to discover Steve looked just as discombobulated as Tony felt.
“We have a lot in common, you and I.”
Steve had to clear his throat to cover the snort that threatened to escape before he could swallow his laughter. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony wink at him. Steve reached out and took Tony’s hand.
Below his Twitter and Instagram accounts, the headlines started.
A quick consultation on the internet later, and he had the jumper cables connected. Climbing into the driver’s seat, Steve waited a few minutes, his heart pounding. His hand trembled against the wheel.
“Yeah. I thought about it. Then I decided to trust you instead,” Tony replied with a soft smile. He squeezed Steve’s hand. “Let’s go upstairs.”
Steve tried to swallow, but his mouth was suddenly dry as dust. Nefaria’s mouth curled up into a smirk and Steve could see him standing over him on the
Dropping forward, Tony pinned Steve’s arms to the mattress.
“Tony, you’re up,” Peggy decided.
“What is it?”
“You’re just jealous that you’re not getting any,” Tony told him.
“Don’t mock the guy who’d about to give you a blow job,” Steve retorted, grabbing Tony and kissing him.
“Yeah, I do,” he smiled. “Okay. Time to go.” But when he reached for the door, he hesitated, turning back to Angie. “Three days in the Caledonian, right?”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.
After the stress of the trial, he wanted nothing more than to curl up with his boyfriend and forget about the world for a few hours so he tugged Steve towards the den and all but fell onto the couch. Judging by the way Steve instantly curled into his side, he felt the same way.
“What? No way,” Steve scoffed.
Banner shrugged again. “I know how to use Google?”
“Location, Midtown Manhattan. Bio?”
He could see why Clint liked her.
Steve fisted his hand in Tony’s hair and crushed their mouths together. Tony let out a growl and pressed his hand into the small of Steve’s back, eliminating any space between them, and nipped and licked his way into Steve’s mouth. He took control of the kiss and Steve let him, a rush of excitement flooding through him because he could trust Tony, he could hand over control and Tony would take care of him and Ellie, and that realisation was as heady as the kiss itself.
“Hi,” she sighed, draping herself across the table.
When he woke again, Steve pulled his boots on and filled his travel mug with coffee, collecting some of the fish from the fridge and tossing a couple of apples into the bag too. His own stomach growled, but making breakfast felt like too much effort for him. At the last minute, he grabbed a banana and shoved it into his backpack with his water bottle, then set off.
“Don’t schedule it, tell Pepper to take what she wants. Tell her to donate the whole collection if she wants. Anything else urgent?”
“Is he okay?” Johnny asked, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jacket as they made their way through the corridor.
“Ew, Ang.”
“Hi,” Steve echoed then they both started to giggle.
He shifted closer and Tony rolled onto his back, so Steve could rest his head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony wrapped his arm around Steve, leaning down to kiss his forehead.
Joseph hesitated for a second in the doorway, his moustache twitching, then he disappeared and Steve burst out laughing, burying his face in Tony’s shoulder.
Dr. Romanoff shrugged. “Call it a gut feeling.”
Tony’s eyes drifted towards the windows. “Too stubborn not too, I guess.”
“I thought that was the sex?” Rhodey teased.
Steve shrugged.
“That long?”
. I interned at his company for two years. Never saw him smile once. But look at him! Anyway, I was talking to Angie earlier and she suggested cocktails to celebrate, are you both in?”
She toddled over to Tony, tugging on his jeans and looking up at him pleadingly.
“Fuck,” Steve breathed.
“I dunno.”
Bucky’s phone buzzed against the table; he picked it up, checking the message before downing the rest of his beer in one.
He found Clint in the communal kitchen, halfway through building a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
“You wanna carry me over the threshold?” Steve teased.
“Oh, Steve. Oh, honey,” he sighed. “I’m so sorry. I am, I am so sorry. You never should’ve had to deal with that.”
“That sounds nice.”
“Can I help you, sir?” Steve asked, his tone the belligerent one he usually used with cops who were trying to tell him off for peaceful protest.
“Maybe?”
“Find the fusebox, there’s probably a switch to turn from mains power to the generator.”
“Sure,” Tony nodded. “What’s up?”
“Musta been a bird or something.”
“Uh, definitely no,” Bruce frowned.
“I think I have a concussion,” Clint piped up.
“What do you have to lose?” Steve called. “You come with me and if I’m lying, if I’m wrong, so what? You wasted an hour. But if I’m telling the truth…”
Steve frowned.
Once the patient was sedated, Dr. Pym called Bruce over to stitch up the wound on her cheek. “That’s it,” Dr. Pym murmured. “Your stitches are very neat.”
“That’s gross,” he muttered.
“Tony, it’s never going to be the same,” Rhodey pointed out gently.
“My teachers wanted me to apply to a STEM school,” Steve admitted. “They were pretty pushy actually. I was living with my nan by this point, after my mom died. And nan, she told me
“Believe me,” Tony told him. “It’s my honour.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“As soon as you’re recovered, I’m taking you to the Tower,” Tony declared. “I’m immunised against things you’ve never even heard of. We’re getting Helen to vaccinate you too.” When Steve cocked his head, eyebrows raised in question, Tony added, “Turns out, surgery performed in a cave without an anaesthetic isn’t actually good for you. I have a severely compromised immune system, so Helen has me on super powerful vaccines, I don’t know what they are. I don’t do squishy science.”
Steve shook his head. “He’s in surgery with Carol, removing a crossbow arrow from a homophobe’s shoulder. It’s not him. Not this time.”
“Your… dating profile,” Pepper said, her tone somewhere between awkward and exasperated. Tony swallowed. The break up was hard on both of them. A year later, and they were still trying to find their way back to something akin to friendship, or at least a functioning working relationship. “It broke the internet.”
“You done?”
“At least you still love me,” Steve murmured, kissing the crown of Hannah’s head, which earned him a scowl from the toddler, who clutched his phone even tighter just in case he was considering taking it away from her. “Or you love my phone at least.”
After a few minutes, Tony’s hands gently rolled Steve onto his back then Tony slipped out of bed. Steve’s eyes tracked him as he rounded the bed, flicking on the bathroom light before disappearing inside. A moment later, Steve heard the sound of running water, then Tony returned with a cloth in hand, crawling back into bed and running it over Steve, wiping him clean with such care and tenderness. It always filled Steve with warmth, dancing down his spine and leaving his toes tingling. He almost loved the aftercare more than the orgasm.
“Okay. I know it’s weird and I’m sorry-"
“More than okay,” Tony promised. “I helped you because I could; tomorrow or next week, you’ll help me. Or I’ll help you again. That’s what we do.”
Steve wasn’t sure how he felt. On one hand, it was almost over. But on the other, everything could be on the verge of falling apart. Or they could deliberate for weeks.
“Um, I’m Ari. I’m your new PA.”
“You too.”
“I just threw up again.”
One particularly memorable occasion was during a Pride after party when, while Steve had his tongue down a guy’s throat and his hand down his pants, a familiar voice behind him chirped, “Hi Mr Rogers!” Sadly it wasn’t the first time, nor would it be the last.
“No, no. This is good. Better we find these things out now, and not down the line when one of us says
“Is that man in the court today?”
“A drug trial,” Steve continued. “That got unexpected funding. A few weeks after I first went to see Arnie.”
“Ah,” Steve nodded.
Tony shook his head and Steve couldn’t have kept himself from lunging forward and hugging Tony even if he’d wanted to. Tony’s arms immediately wrapped around him, the water seeping through Steve’s t-shirt from Tony’s body. Over Tony’s shoulder, Steve could see Obadiah Stane’s body floating in the middle of the pool, so he buried his face into Tony’s neck, breathing in the smell of the water and carding his fingers through Tony’s hair just in case he was thinking of going anywhere.
“That’s a good talk,” Tony grinned and Steve felt himself smile back. “To, um. To steal your earlier question. Why?”
“Who’s the gang?” Steve asked, draping his arms over Tony’s shoulders.
“Wow.” He smiled softly. “Congrats. But, uh, Steve and I probably aren’t the best example.”
When the pizza was gone, Steve scrubbed his hands over his face, yawning widely. He blinked muzzily, feeling exhaustion creeping in now that he’d stopped and actually eaten something almost resembling a meal. His muscles protested loudly when he stood up, but Steve knew if he didn’t move now he never would.
“Hey. It’s me,” he called, letting himself into the swimming pool. He dumped the cleaning supplies on the floor and pulled off his backpack. “Tony? I know you can hear me.”
“That one,” Tony repeated. “Definitely.”
“I’m not mad at you,” Steve explained. “I love the books. I love that you gave them to me. I love that you gave me part of my mom back. It's just… It dragged some stuff up for me. Stuff I didn’t realise I was holding onto quite so tight.”
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“Okay, that works.”
“Bruce.”
“Yeah, we picked up Natasha’s bridesmaid’s dress this morning,” Steve replied. He twisted the engagement ring around his finger, anticipation curling in his belly at the thought of their bonding ceremony only six days away. “You sure you don’t want to come?”
“You’re sniffing shampoo, Stark,” he realised, shaking his head at his own ridiculousness.
“Um, yesterday,” Steve lied.
He scrolled through the names, flicking back and forth between the pages. He clicked on a few names although he wasn’t sure what made him pick those ones over the others, but nothing really clicked.
Returning to the ground floor, Steve wandered towards the edge of the pool, sparing a glance towards the fireplace. He imagined the Starks or their guests lounging by the fire after spending an hour in the pool - although why anyone needed a fireplace in Los Angeles was a mystery to Steve.
They made their way downstairs, picking up Natasha and Bruce from their floors, and then the four of them tumbled into the backseat of a waiting car. A short ride later and they climbed out of the car again outside the club. Angie was waiting for them and thanks to Tony’s name, they skipped the line entirely and headed straight inside. Tony waved obligingly to the dude in the line who shouted, “Holy shit, it’s Tony Stark,” and burst out laughing when they heard someone add, “He’s hotter in real life!”
“Ready,” Hope agreed. Scott prayed that the hint of resignation in her tone wasn’t all in his imagination.
“Uh, okay. So you know how Sharon is on bed rest?”
“I’ve had sex since then,” he snapped. “I’m single, not celibate.”
It was hilarious.
They clutched at each other, paddling to stay afloat, then Tony cupped the back of Steve’s head and kissed him. When the need for air became too much, he broke the embrace, pressing their foreheads together instead.
Steve nodded in encouragement, happy to hear any idea that meant avoiding his life becoming front page news.
Steve growled and tried to yank himself free, which only resulted in a painful burn on his arm. He was so busy trying to get free that he completely missed Stane’s hand coming up until it smacked into the side of his head and sent him spinning. Steve stumbled away but Stane still had hold of his arm. His head was spinning and his shoulder ached and he fell to his knees.
They moved in time to the music, oblivious of everyone around them and of Natasha, who smiled to herself as she hit post on the picture she’d just taken. Even though neither Steve nor Tony had approved it first, she had a feeling they wouldn’t mind.
“What’d you do?” Bucky smirked.
“No, I don’t trust him,” Tony agreed. “Do you know how close I was to just going home that day? God, Steve, I still have nightmares about what could’ve happened if I had. How long you could’ve been stuck in there. I… No. I don’t trust him. I will never trust him. Not after he locked you in that closet knowing you were claustrophobic.”
Maybe one day soon it would be their space.
Forgoing any words at all, Steve flipped him off. Tony snorted, before darting forward and stealing a piece of pizza.
Steve’s chest heaved. He swallowed and clenched his jaw, before finally tugging on Stark’s hand, pulling him closer.
He picked up the cardboard file box he’d decided to liberate and began packing his belongings into it. He figured after everything the least they could do was give him a box. Wordlessly, Angie left the doorway and began helping him. Steve felt a rush of gratitude for her silent support. After six years, she knew exactly what he needed. God, he loved her.
“Not tonight.”
Another cheep alerted him to U’s presence; the second robot was holding something in his claw. His phone, Tony realised.
“Screw it,” Steve decided.
“Steve, you are going to get your ass in that car and you are going to go back to the Tower and that is an order,” Bucky snapped.
Steve closed his bedroom door, leaning against it for a second before hobbling over to his bed and collapsing. He pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes until he saw stars. Blinking until his vision cleared, Steve stared up at the faint watermark on his ceiling and whispered, “What the fuck just happened?”
“She’s not wrong.”
He blinked in surprise. “I’m fine,” he insisted. “I promise. I’ve felt worse after a night out with Peggy.”
“Fuck you both,” Steve huffed.
Steve turned back to the stars, barely visible above them through the light pollution. The weight on his chest was heavy, but - despite Tony’s claims that they were not friends - it was a little lighter with Tony by his side. Logically, Steve knew he should head home, but he couldn’t bring himself to move, not yet.
“No!” Angie whimpered. Steve nodded his fervent agreement, except it was tea he longed for, because he only drank coffee when he had a hangover.
“I don’t want to,” he whispered childishly.
“That doesn’t surprise me,” Tony smiled, scraping his teeth gently over the sensitive skin beneath Steve’s ear. Steve shivered, his fingers digging into Tony’s shoulders. Tony chuckled, low and dirty, teasing Steve’s earlobe between his teeth. Steve’s hips jerked forward and Tony’s hands pressed him forward so he was leaning into Tony’s chest.
“What’s going on?” Clint asked, trying for casual and missing by a mile. He’d never been good at this sort of thing. The seeing exes sort of thing.
“Come on, man,” Clint began, feeling more awkward than he’d ever been in his life. This was worse than the time he asked Bobbi Morse out in ninth grade. “We’ve all seen you and Stark tonight. You two, you’re… Well, you’re not exactly subtle.”
“His throat was cut from ear to ear, his tongue and both his hands were missing,” Bucky added.
“Your hearing might be good, but I doubt it’s that good,” Steve retorted, yanking open the door. He glanced over his shoulder when he heard a splash and Tony was gone. When he stepped inside, Tony was already there, leaning on folded arms against the edge of the pool. “It’s really irritating when you do that.”
Tony jerked backward, his eyes going wide with a flash of fear. His hands clenched and unclenched, then he opened and closed his mouth twice before squeezing his eyes shut.
, announcing their arrival at the penthouse. Crossing the apartment to the kitchen, Tony pulled out the menu for his favourite Greek place and handed it to Steve, pressing a kiss into his hair.
, Steve thought. The watch was expensive enough on its own. With the chip that allowed him access to almost every corner of Avengers’ Tower, it was priceless.
Thank you so much to everyone who has kudos, commented, or subscribed to this story. You are all wonderful! ❤️
“It’s okay, honey. I’ve got you,” Tony murmured, running his hand up and down Steve’s spine. Steve felt a strong hand grip his shoulder supportingly and he knew it must be Bucky. He leaned into their touches and tried to forget the feeling of Nefaria’s smug expression sweeping over his body.
“Dodgy Darren,” Clint muttered.
“What can I get you?” she asked.
“Come on up,” Steve grinned.
Bucky smirked.
Sure enough, above where the door on the floor below below, the shelves were shallower than on the rest of the wall.
Tony grinned. “Your wish is my command.”
“Come on, we’ll wait outside,” he suggested. “See you later,” he told Peggy and Daniel.
“Welcome, uh, welcome back Mr Stark,” he greeted, pushing his glasses further up his nose.
Stark nodded, opening his locker. “Only fair.”
“I am afraid I can neither confirm nor deny that, Mr Rogers,” JARVIS replied, sounding apologetic. “All I can confirm is that Mr Stark is not in the suit or within the immediate vicinity. However, there have been reports of a disturbance in the area.”
“You’re an idiot.”
Tony’s eyebrows shot up.
Steve nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, so close, Tony. You are, ah, so good to me.”
“I live in hope,” Bucky smirked and Tony flipped him off.
“If you want I can give him your number?” Sharon offered.
“Are you okay?” Tony demanded. “Steve, are you okay?”
“I am a captain in the US Army. I am a Ranger. I am a grown man. I do not
“Sir?” JARVIS prompted. “Would you like the music back on?”
“This is less of a disaster zone than I was expecting,” Tony announced, stepping into Steve’s bedroom.
“Italian,” Banner replied. “Okay, we’ve got avocado and smoked paprika bruschette, and marinated mozzarella balls. Then tagliatelle with sausages, rosemary and porcini mushrooms, made with homemade pasta.”
“Right,” Hogarth nodded. She frowned. “And yet, you by your own account, stayed calm and collected. Calm enough to pick the lock on your handcuffs? Which, I have to be honest, is quite impressive. It’s not an everyday skill. Picking handcuffs. How exactly does a high school teacher manage to pick the lock of handcuffs on his first try?”
“Hey, Barton,” he greeted, falling into step with Clint. “How’s it going?”
“Alright, alright,” he laughed, stepping forward and pulling her into his arms. Angie buried her face in his chest and Steve squeezed his eyes shut, nosing at her hair and holding her close. There would never be words for what she’d done for him six years ago, agreeing to move in with her best friend’s best friend on a whim. Not only that, but she’d helped him through his heartbreak without hesitation. “I love you,” he whispered.
“Definitely,” Steve replied.
“Okay. It’s official: I want a library,” he announced.
Alright, because he didn’t want to think of the possibility of anything worse than that.
“What?”
Steve draped his arms over Tony’s shoulders and leaned down for a lingering kiss. Tony’s hands ran over his sides and by the time they broke apart, Steve was well on his way to being turned on.
“You love it,” Tony grinned. As if they didn’t both know that Tony dropping him off at work for the first day of term was going to end with them making out in the car like a pair of teenagers.
“Yeah,” he replied. “I do. I believe you’ll always save me if I need you.”
“No, they’re not. They’re just five dumbasses who live in the same building as me. And you’ve already met Barnes, which only leaves four dumbasses. Nothing to worry about.”
it is to outsmart you. Because that control panel you see? It’s biometrically coded to me. And if you destroy it? You destroy this whole ship.”
“What would you know about it?”
“It is.”
“Yes, I turned it on,” Steve snapped. “I’m not that dumb.”
“You’re here late,” Tony’s voice called, breaking Steve out of his reverie.
Bruce looked at him in confusion, but he seemed no more convinced. Which meant it was time for Steve’s last ditch attempt. If this didn’t work then… Well, maybe he could offer Bruce a blow job. And if
“There you are,” Steve grinned, throwing his free arm around Daniel’s shoulders and kissing his cheek. “Hey.”
“Right!” Scott nodded. “That would be bad.”
“Any time,” Tony promised. And squeezed Steve’s thigh, his thumb brushing his dick through his jeans.
“Just looking for your boyfriend.”
“That may be.”
“That’s Tony. You know Tony,” Steve told her.
Admitting defeat and accepting that he wasn’t getting to sleep any time soon, Steve rolled over and grabbed his glasses from the bedside table, managing to jam them on without poking himself in the eye. Picking up his phone, he squinted against the bright light in the darkness of his bedroom until his eyes adjusted. Then, opening Google, he typed in
“What are you two talking about?” Steve asked as he rejoined them.
“I miss his dumb face,” Bucky muttered.
“Really? I thought he was a huge dork,” Steve smirked, sliding his arms around Tony’s waist.
“I hate you.”
“That’s it. That’s it, honey,” Tony murmured. “Jesus, you are so fucking gorgeous.”
“Hey!” Tony objected. “I mean, you’re not wrong. But still.”
“Bye Evie Rose!” Tony waved.
When Steve’s alarm sounded, he was already awake but it still took him a good minute to roll over and switch it off. His phone fell silent, leaving nothing but the distant sounds of the traffic outside and the hum of the bathroom fan as Rhodey took his shower.
He realised again how lucky he was that Tony managed to keep their relationship out of the spotlight for so long, because Steve definitely couldn’t have dealt with this in the early days. He wasn’t sure he could cope with it now, but he managed to grit his teeth and cling on to Tony’s hand to get through.
“Of course.” Steve could hear the eye roll. “Sure, it is pal. Can’t wait to meet him. Whoever he is.”
“No, you wouldn’t have.”
positives.”
“Yes, it is,” Steve grinned.
“And you want to date me?” Tony asked quietly. Nervously, Steve realised. Tony Stark was worried about what Steve thought of him?
Arnie smiled sadly. “I’m dying, Steve. I have cancer. Inoperable.”
Steve laughed.
“Gee, I wonder why?” Steve frowned in mock confusion. “Maybe because you only turn up when you want something. It’s not bail money, obviously, so what is it?”
“Don’t worry, honey. We all laughed,” Tony assured him, patting Steve’s arm.
“Can confirm,” he nodded.
“Tony, no. You promised.”
“Good.”
Tony exhaled, blowing out his cheeks. He dragged a hand down his face, the mask falling away and letting the fear and uncertainty bleed through. “You’re right. I’m sorry. There was a patient. Drug addict. Just hit a little too close to home.”
“Hey Sharon. Barton,” Carol Danvers, head of the trauma department, greeted. “Where’s Nat?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Which left the Mermaid House.
He stood up and marched away but before he could get far, a hand grabbed his wrist and yanked him into an alley.
“Alright,” Steve agreed.
Curiously, Stark’s expression seemed to darken for a second. But before Scott could question it too much, a slurred voice shouted, “What the hell’s taking so long?”
“Good boy,” Tony whispered.
Steve let Tony draw him in for another kiss, this one turning deeper, and Tony’s hands began to wander over Steve’s body. He shivered, breaking the kiss reluctantly and pressing their foreheads together.
Tony’s grip on Steve’s fingers tightened. They watched the foreman hand over the verdict form to the clerk.
“Right. What is it?”
Tony snorted loudly. He attempted to cover it with a cough when Bucky looked at him curiously.
However, this left the door cleared for a third thug to barrel towards Tony. Tony deflected his blows - sloppy and obvious, Happy would be so disappointed except wait, this was someone trying to inflict serious harm on Tony so maybe Happy wouldn’t be too disappointed - and flipped him onto the ground. The goon groaned pitifully.
“Yes, you are,” Bucky replied, his voice taking on a hard edge.
“Hmm?” Tony opened his eyes.
Arnie sucked in a breath.
“Of course you are,” Tony sighed.
“Yeah. Apparently a thunderstorm’s going to hit in the next half an hour,” Hope shrugged.
“You should be so lucky,” Steve teased, wrapping his arms tightly around Tony’s neck and leaning their temples together.
Hope sighed. “I can call psych, see if they have a bed for her. But we’re the ER. We don’t have the time or the beds or frankly the funding. I’m sorry.”
“Are there good parts of Brooklyn?” Romanoff asked. Steve eyed her uncertainly; it almost felt like she was teasing, but he couldn’t be sure. His normal response, to leap to Brooklyn’s defence, was waylaid by his knowledge that she would and could kick his ass before he knew what was happening.
“I need your help,” Clint shrugged.
“Oh man,” Clint sighed. “I’m sorry you got caught up in this shit. I just… I got in my head. I started having nightmares again. About Loki and New York. What could’ve happened if Nat didn’t get me back. What did happen before she got me back. I walk past that Wall of Valour and I see those names. The ones I put up there.”
Steve’s hands trembled as he reached for Lucky. The dog was curled up on the sofa of the den next to him and looked as miserable as Steve felt.
“Singapore will still be there tomorrow,” Steve pointed out.
“Is there a third option?” Steve asked, trying to break off a piece of chicken with his fork while holding his wriggling pup with the other hand.
“Steve, I’m in my eighties and I’m dying of cancer. I’m under no illusions about what kind role I can play in her life. If she has people who love her, then I’ll be a happy man. And I can enjoy what time we have together without worrying about the two of you.”
“If there’s no power, we’re kinda fucked aren’t we?”
“Thanks,” Daniel smiled. “Hey, wanna get hot dogs?”
“Excellent choice, Mr Batroc,” Alexander smiled. “Steve, can you call Dr. Danvers and let her know Mr Batroc will be on his way up, then prep him for surgery. And let Dr. Danvers know that I am available to assist.”
Natasha stepped forward, taking Sharon’s hands and squeezing them gently. “Sharon, I’ve known you for three years now. Even if we weren’t together, I’d still be there for you. Because you’re my best friend. And… I like kids. And your kid? I’m going to love your kid.”
“Yeah, sure thing. No problem,” Tony agreed. He bent to pick Ellie up from the floor. “Come on, gorgeous. You wanna hang out with me for a while?”
“I’m not weak,” Steve yelled.
“Bye Tony. It was… interesting to meet you.”
The door buzzed, letting him into the building. Tony jogged up the stairs and rapped on Steve’s door. From inside the apartment, he heard the sound of feet rumbling towards the door. He bit back a smile just in time, before the door swung open and revealed Evie Rose.
“Can I come over?” he blurted out.
“It all goes,” Steve murmured.
It was a relief to know that the Avengers were all onboard with Steve moving in. Not that Tony wanted or needed their permission, but it felt good to have the support of his friends behind him.
Steve stared at him in confusion.
“I mean, I thought it might be nice,” Natasha replied, opening her locker before throwing a glance over her shoulder at Sharon. “Considering you’re my girlfriend.”
“Hey!” Steve objected when Tony didn’t stop poking him. “Stop that. What are you doing?” he laughed.
Once his eyes adjusted to the light, Tony realised they were surrounded by a SWAT team and - was that a helicopter? What was happening? He didn’t have time for this, he needed to find Steve.
I have some ideas for more stories in this verse so who knows, I might return to it one day.
“I don’t trust you.”
into Google Images and hit enter, his heart pounding as the pictures loaded.
“You okay?” Steve murmured.
Steve couldn’t decide.
, because he was her best friend.
“Okay but as much as I hate to admit it, Stark has a point,” Clint agreed. “Pups are usually ugly when they’re that small but she’s really cute.”
“How do you know that?” Scott pouted.
“Thank you, Crash,” Tony continued. “Alternative plan: we send our spies in, we plant a bug - one of mine, so they’re not going to find it - and then we know what they’re doing as they’re doing it.”
Steve glanced down and saw that Ellie’s eyes were open and she was blinking slowly at Tony, not fully awake yet. Her thumb drifted towards her mouth and her other hand pawed lightly at Steve’s shirt.
“Deal,” Steve agreed.
“Nothing about me is straight,” Tony retorted and Steve snorted.
Sure enough, with every breath, a rattling wheeze echoed from Jessica. Then her eyes rolled back and she slumped forward as she went limp. She wasn’t breathing.
Foggy frowned.
Shit.
He sighed, lying down and letting the cold seep through his shirt from the ground. Even though the sun had slipped below the horizon, the humidity lingered, leaving Steve sticky and longing for a New York winter.
“Alright pipsqueak, you can look,” he chuckled.
“How did we get from talking about how great I am, to talking about Thor?” Tony wondered.
“Sure you don’t want to tell me how you got into those vents?” Tony muttered.
If heaven existed - and he was still iffy on that, and the only reason he was even kind of considering the existence of God was due to the fact he had an actual God living in his building right now - then this was surely it, he decided. Row upon row of cats, all of them gazing up at him with big eyes and begging to be scritched.
But Steve wanted to expand Ellie’s world beyond the Tower and the Avengers - not to mention the fact that he was starting to get cabin fever. Between staying at SHIELD while he was pregnant and then staying at the Tower because he had Ellie, he’d barely been out since he woke up in the future.
“What are you doing this morning?” Steve asked, stepping into the elevator.
“What do you need to know?”
“No, you’re not.”
“That’ll be the one,” he confirmed.
That time with Loki and that stick which made everyone’s clothes disappear was… enlightening to say the least. Tony had some very happy memories of what, exactly, his team mates were packing under there, and he was pleased to say they were all fucking hot.
of the lube cap flicking open and his hips jerked forward in anticipation.
“What are you talking about?” Tony asked.
“It turned into a flying carpet?”
“No, I’m just stupid and useless, right?”
“I don’t want some pompous little Stark swanning in here and taking over just because he’s riding on the coattails of daddy’s greatness - not that Howard Stark is so great,” Hank muttered. “Maria, she has some skill, I’ll admit that. But Howard only got to where he is because his-”
“Hey, if Nat gets a cat, can I get a dog?” Clint asked. “Thor, quit hogging the prawn crackers.”
He knew there was no one coming.
“Anyone who wants to come. What do you think?”
Because it looked like they were having sex. Whoever took this picture knew exactly what they were doing.
“You don’t have to stick around, you know,” Tony said as Steve unpacked Tony’s fish and his own smoothie.
“Gotcha,” he whispered.
“I’m pretty sure you deserve one.”
It was obvious that the Avengers were horribly, dangerously outmatched. These robot things, whatever they were, they were ready for the Avengers, and the Avengers clearly were not prepared for them. They fought well and hard, but they were obviously on the back foot and doing everything they could to try and catch up. Steve caught sight of Bucky, sans cowl, his scowling face smeared with dirt, a trickle of blood on his cheek from an already-healed cut. The next time he saw Tony, his armour was already battered and bruised, a dark grey scrape along one side filling Steve’s head with all kinds of horrible possibilities.
“Maybe you need more ice cream?” Evie Rose suggested slyly.
“But the one thing my grandmother was able to save was this quilt her grandmother made for the birth of her first child. With the birth of every child, the quilt grew. Each name painstakingly stitched into the quilt. As the family grew, so did it. When they lost everything, the quilt was damaged, but Nonna kept it. And she spent years repairing it to its former glory, but she did it. And it was beautiful.
When he spoke, his voice was carefully controlled.
“You’ve got me,” Tony whispered.
“Honey, that woman has seen you at your very worst.” He patted Steve’s cheek. “You don’t have any dignity left to lose.”
“I know that. Thinking about what?”
“Always,” Steve grinned.
“I’m being ridiculous,” Steve muttered. “It’s just a closet.”
Natasha shrugged. “Then you better figure something out. He’s a complete dick. At least Thor is good fun.” She patted him on the shoulder. “You’ve got this, Bruce.”
“So,” Tony said, climbing onto one of the high stools and turning towards Steve. “How are you feeling about the trial?”
“I built this company from nothing,” Stane declared. “And nothing is going to stand in my way. Least of all that fish.”
“Really?” Natasha smiled and tried not to melt because she had a reputation to maintain, dammit.
“You’re not okay?” Tony echoed, raising his head to meet Bucky’s gaze.
The Avengers finally returned around noon. As soon as he saw the Quinjet approach, Steve followed JARVIS’ directions downstairs so he was waiting when the jet pulled into the hanger. The hatch opened and Bucky was the first down the ramp, battle-tired and rumpled and looking grumpy as hell.
“This is going to sting,” Steve warned him, before using antiseptic fluid to clean the wound.
baby cats,” Tony corrected.
As much as he wished it wasn’t the case, they couldn’t have a happy ending together. Tony was going back to the ocean, of that Steve was determined, and there was no way for them to be together when he lived on land and Tony lived in the sea. Even if they wanted to try, the risk of being discovered was too high.
Tony glared, “I reserve the right to stab him if he tries anything, but other than that, sure, I promise not to stab him.”
Arnie nodded, pressing his trembling lips together, and Steve transferred her carefully into Arnie’s arms.
He took the bathroom first at Tony’s insistence, running through his nighttime routine before padding over to the bed. He flicked through social media while waiting for Tony, scrolling through his Twitter feed before refreshing his Tumblr notifications.
“It’s not personal, you know,” she murmured. She nodded towards Daniel and Angie. “Those stories. They’re not personal.”
“Here we are.”
“Morning Justin!” Clint grinned, only to be ignored as usual. Hammer refused to speak to him, ever since the time Clint and Scott put shaving foam in his shoe. That was the best April Fools.
“Hello to you too,” Stark said, glancing up from the computer screen.
“Nothing I ain’t seen before.”
Natasha swallowed. “You have between three and six months left.”
To an outsider, it looked like Arnie was holding his granddaughter, all thanks to a twist of fate. But Steve knew that if he’d had Ellie in the forties, they would’ve had to bond and then Arnie would’ve been denied the happiness he’d had with Michael. Because Arnie might’ve been one of his best friends but Steve had never felt anything other than friendship towards him. They slept together because Steve needed help and he trusted Arnie in a way that he trusted very few alphas.
, it was Thursday and Tony was flying back to New York and his boyfriend.
Tony didn’t reply, he just stared at the shattered remains of Steve’s phone with a horrible sense of foreboding. If this was what they’d done to Steve’s phone, what had they done to Steve? Steve was in danger, and it was all his fault.
, his phone lit up. Steve lunged forward, scrabbling to unlock it.
“Help you with what?”
They unloaded their pockets into a plastic tray to go through security then stepped from the metal detector one at a time. Recollecting their belongings, they made their way down to the courtroom, their footsteps echoing along the hall.
“No problem,” Walters smiled. “I should’ve known better. Where do you work?”
They lapsed into silence; Tony watching Ellie and Steve watching Tony watch Ellie. The longer he watched, the surer Steve became that something was wrong with Tony.
“You okay?”
“Uh, I’m sure we can get a car seat here within the hour,” Tony said, clearing his throat. “JARVIS, order the one with the best safety rating. Ignore the price.”
Even so, it summoned Tony instantly, leaning over the bed with one hand in the small of Steve’s back.
“Yes,” Steve panted. “Come on, Tony, I want you.”
“Whatever you’re doing, it appears to be working,” Thor smiled.
“You are way too interested in my sex life,” Tony informed him.
remained silent but they both knew it was there.
“Your wish is my command,” Tony murmured, adding a second finger.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Natasha replied. She glanced between Frigga and Bruce with something almost like amusement on her face. “How are you feeling?”
“Bruce?”
“Yes. Because they’re about to jump each other,” Steve replied. “Peggy is probably already naked.”
It was the most beautifully erotic thing Tony had ever seen.
“Where’d you learn to cook?” Steve asked, while wondering if it would be inappropriate to lick the bowl. To his dismay, Tony picked up the bowl to load it into the dishwasher before Steve could make up his mind.
“Alright,” Bucky nodded. “Let’s give it a look.”
“What do you mean?” Steve frowned. He’d started tapping his fingers against his thigh, Tony noticed. A rhythmic steady beat, each one roughly a second long.
Rhodey snorted. “Yeah, sure. And maybe after, pigs will fly.”
There was a tiny voice in his head which said he should apologise to Tony, but another bigger, louder voice insisted Steve had nothing to apologise for.
Spoilery Warnings: discussion of past mob violence
“Porphyria,” Dr. Romanoff explained. “It’s a genetic condition, due to a mutation in the genes which make heme. It’s manageable and we’re going to refer you to a specialist.”
“Beautiful,” Steve said truthfully. “She’ll love them.”
“No big picture,” Tony shrugged. “Not this time.”
“Hey, uh, quick question,” Tony called. “Why is Barton feeding that dog pizza?”
“Aw, what a shame,” Bucky deadpanned.
“We’re going to use that image to our advantage. Right now, if your father tries to vilify you, it’s not going to go well for him. People want to know more about you, and if we get ahead of it, we can control this. If we get in the media first, then he’s going to come off worse.”
“Yeah. Yesterday. I remember.”
“Steve has a terrible poker face,” Peggy explained for Tony’s benefit. “He doesn’t have a tell, he just hates losing. Whenever he gets a bad hand, he can’t hide it, bless him.”
“All because I was making out with my boyfriend,” Bucky grinned, spreading his arms.
“We’re not going to be like our fathers, Steve,” Tony replied, kissing his shoulder.
Bucky sighed. “We don’t know. He’s gone.”
Stane hummed, just as the progress bar reached the end, the window disappearing.
Bucky snorted again.
“She has a lawyer already?” Dr. Pym frowned.
“It’s not bad,” Daniel insisted. “I think it might be from my Instagram, actually.”
“Relax,” Tony smiled. “I don’t bite. Unless you’re Steve, which you’re not. So. Anyway, first order of business, Pepper is organising a Meet the Heroes event for SI on December 1st. Can you put that in my calendar and make sure the day stays clear? Coordinate with the rest of the Avengers and make sure they keep the day clear too, okay?”
“Pets are easier than children,” Tony shrugged. “Not that I’m ruling anything out.”
“I’ll take your word for it,” Steve murmured, leaning down to kiss his husband. “What’s your plan for tonight?”
As Hank turned to leave, the supply room door opened again and Hope stepped out. Hank smiled automatically at the sight of his daughter, who started when her eyes fell on him.
Tony poured MJ into bed, smiling when she fell asleep before her head hit the pillow. He paused for a moment, watching her face go slack, and wondered what it would feel like to do this with his own child.
Then she mimed gagging.
“Steve said that,” Tony smiled to himself. “Last week. We, uh, we had the kids talk. And the marriage talk.”
“It’s fine,” Steve assured him. “I think I can entertain myself for a few hours while you go do business. I have those boxes to sort out.”
Someone with Steve’s childhood ailments could not only survive but thrive, thanks to the advances in medical science.
“Why?”
“Wasn’t your fault,” Tony shrugged.
Like dating Tony had somehow changed him.
Gary huffed. “Mom, I’ll call you back, but don’t delete anything, okay? Okay. Love you too, bye. What do you want, Barton?”
Then he exhaled slowly, climbed out of the car, and ran back inside. Tony was waiting on the edge of the pool, his mismatched eyes inscrutable as he watched Steve run across the room to his backpack. Tossing everything into it, Steve swung his bag onto his back then turned to Tony.
For Steve, the fact it came from Tony made it irreplaceable.
“You know where we can find more heroes?” Ari asked. “Or very convincing lookalikes?”
And kept scrolling, because they went on forever. On and on and on. Steve could feel the knot of anxiety clenching in his gut, but he couldn’t look away. From shaky camera phone footage of Tony’s first battle with Stane in his suit, to clips from an ABC documentary on the Battle of New York, to KTLA 5’s footage of Tony’s mansion being destroyed, the clips just kept coming.
“It’s your mother,” Clint replied, his patience stretching thin.
“Really?”
“Thank you,” Stark murmured, wrapping his arms around Steve and squeezing him tight. “I’ve got you.” He leaned back, cupping Steve’s face with one hand. “Are you okay?”
He held out his fist for Donnie to bump.
“He does that,” Tony shrugged. He took Steve’s hand, tugging him into the booth behind him, entwining their fingers, because right then, Tony didn’t feel like ever letting Steve go again, and that was just ridiculous because he’d only been gone four days, and they hadn’t even been dating that long. “Steve, meet Bucky Barnes, national icon and asshole. Bucky, meet Steve.”
“Steve?”
“You…”
“The US Attorney claims that Luchino Nefaria blew up Castello Malvagio on April 13th. I ask you: how does this make him different from the Avengers, his alleged victims? Well, there is one way he’s different: no one died on the night of April 13th at Castello Malvagio. The same cannot be said for the Avengers’ actions on multiple occasions. They have put people in danger, injured them, left them traumatised and yes, even killed civilians in the past. And yet, they are not on trial today or any day.
Steve looked up sharply. “What?”
Leaning his cheek against his folded hands, Steve smiled up at him. “You gonna do something, or are you just going to sit and stare?”
It was an office, that much was clear from the files and paperwork strewn across the desk. But most striking of all was the wall of glass beyond which was murky water. It looked into the swimming pool, Steve realised.
you know all the best lawyers." He took a sip of tea. "And for the record? That’s a joke. I’m not interested in your money.”
“Nah,” Steve replied. “Besides, I’ve got more important things to worry about. Like a romantic holiday with my boyfriend in Singapore.”
Scott’s head snapped up. “What?”
Evie Rose scowled at him dubiously. “You’re famous for that? That’s silly. You should be famous for, like, saving someone’s life. Or, or doing something special. Or being in a movie. Not because you’re dating Tony.”
Good.
Jessica grunted. “Why doesn’t anybody believe me?”
“It is a fine specimen!”
“The conga,” Steve rolled his eyes.
“You asked,” Steve shrugged.
Tony grinned, leaning down to brush their lips together. The angle was awkward and put a strain on his back, but Tony decided it was worth it to kiss his boyfriend. His boyfriend who said that he wanted to move in.
“Do you have your bow?” he murmured.
“We should move,” he murmured.
“All the time.”
“Yeah,” Steve cringed.
“You need to wear eyeliner more,” Tony announced, running his thumb around the edge of Steve’s eye. “It is stunning on you. I could get lost in those baby blues.”
Tony hung up and put his phone back into his pocket as he hurried to catch up with MJ. He held open the door to the VA for her then they made their way towards the reception desk.
Sure enough, three days later his phone rang again, Unknown Number on the screen and as much as he wanted to ignore it, Steve knew his father wouldn’t leave a voicemail if he didn’t pick up.
And Tony wanted to do it, he really did. But there would always be that niggling
Steve followed his gaze along the corridor and smiled when he spotted Bucky waiting outside the courtroom, a frown on his face as he tugged at his collar.
“Thank you,” Tony murmured, sliding behind Steve, kissing below his ear.
“Who told you?” Tony whispered. “How many know?”
“Hey, who’s the Headless Horseman by the window?”
“Okay?” Tony asked, kissing every part of Steve he could reach.
When Steve woke again, Tony was drawing circles on his back with his fingers. As soon as he looked at Tony’s face, Steve knew that he hadn’t managed to get any more sleep and his heart sank.
“Hang on, I’ll be right down,” he promised.
He paused, however, when a photograph stuck above the workbench caught his eye. Frowning, Steve moved forward and plucked the photo from the wall to study it. He recognised Howard Stark instantly and he assumed it was Arno in his arms. But then he really looked at the face of the child in his arms, and Steve’s heart stuttered.
He froze.
He flew across the city as fast as he could, landing on the roof of Clint’s building with a thump. The suit split open and Tony raced towards the door, yanking it open and hurrying down the stairs as quickly and quietly as he could. He didn’t see anything from the air and there were no signs of disturbance but he knew that appearances could be deceiving.
“Wait, what?” May frowned. “You didn’t tell me there was a car,” she said to Peter.
“I thought you got thrown about by them because you have no self preservation instincts?” Natasha asked innocently, throwing Steve a wink.
Clint snorted and shook his head.
“Somebody please get me a drink so I can forget about that thing on my boyfriend’s chest,” Bucky pleaded.
“I’m right here,” Sharon assured her and Natasha allowed herself another minute of talking to her girlfriend before she went back to work.
It wasn’t in his ears or his head, it was… outside?
Then Tony closed the distance between them and Steve’s blood sang, his heart pounding in his chest and his hands digging into Tony’s ass in a desperate attempt to pull him closer. Tony let the movement rock their groins together and Steve let out a groan, muffled by Tony’s mouth, as their dicks rubbed together.
“Thirty minutes,” Tony replied, then Steve felt his lips on his cheek then the bed shifted as Tony stood up.
Because what else was there to say?
t-shirt. Falling back onto the mattress, Steve grabbed the pillow and pummelled it into shape before flopping back down with a huff and rolling onto his front. He slept fitfully, and his weird mood persisted into the new week. Angie gave up trying to get him to talk about it, but she did snitch on him to Peggy. Which meant he had Peggy on his case until Daniel, bless him, managed to convince Peggy to drop it. Steve was eternally grateful.
“Yeah. I guess.” Tony frowned. “Did I overstep?”
“I need to be quick, I have another class,” Steve interrupted, keeping his voice low and eyeing the students leaving the room who were making no attempt to hide their curious glances. “I’m basically being fired.”
“You’re not moving,” Tony pointed out.
“That too.”
“We did,” Steve agreed.
“You and Matt are still on for tomorrow night, right?” Marci asked, slipping her iPad into her bag.
“Sure,” Steve nodded, and there was something a little weird in his tone, but Tony brushed it off.
“No. It’s a shell,” Clint insisted. “They’re not building anything else. They built a shell to make it look like they built a casino, but they didn’t.”
“Dunno. They got me with the DVR,” Clint grunted. “Which, honestly, the betrayal of being injured by my own DVR hurts more than anything.”
Kids, Tony discovered, took a lot longer to eat than adults. No doubt due to the long and rambling tales they wove into the mealtime. Rather than being irritated, he was enchanted by it. Children’s minds were fascinating, and Tony would much prefer to talk to them than most adults. Adults usually wanted something from him; the most the kids wanted from him was ice cream.
“What?” Steve yelped. “Oh, come on! Are you blind? They’re nothing alike! Assholes.”
There. There was the man that Steve had fallen in love with all the years ago, when he thought he knew what love was.
Tony smiled.
As Natasha and Clint got caught in an argument of who, exactly, saved who in Stockholm, Tony nudged Steve and murmured, “Want me to hold her so you can use both hands?”
He didn’t want Tony knowing about this, never mind anyone else.
“Really?”
“Shouldn’t have made me your next of kin then,” Tony grinned. “Sir.”
“Yeah, that sounds pretty cool,” Tony agreed.
By the time he reached the workshop, Steve felt like he was going to vibrate out of his skin with nervousness. This was worse than all the times he’d lied on his enlistment form, stepping into the Rebirth chamber, going into enemy territory while technically being AWOL, and giving birth in the future all at once.
Clint swallowed. “His marriage might not have a month.”
With a put-upon sigh, Evie Rose slapped her hands over her eyes. Tony faked poking her in the stomach, just to make sure she wasn’t peeking, before stepping forward and sliding his hand onto the back of Steve’s neck. Tony stepped forward, and Steve was already leaning down. Tony ran his thumb through the hairs at the base of Steve’s neck, feeling Steve’s sharp inhalation of breath, then their lips touched.
“Well, I’ll see you around, Steve. Uh, can you…?” Bruce gestured to the wall.
Steve emerged from the bedroom and smiled. Tony was slouched on the couch in sweats and an old Army t-shirt watching TV and it was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. Because Tony was here, he was safe, and he wasn’t in a war zone getting shot.
“How bad a tattoo is it?” Clint asked.
“That would’ve made me laugh,” Tony said. “And I would’ve wanted to talk to you more.”
“Dr. Stark.”
“It was totally worth it. You should’ve seen how fast I was going!”
His heart was still pounding in his ears.
“I hate you,” Steve chuckled.
And when they woke, Tony watched Steve joking easily with MJ and felt a thrill of excitement that one day they would have this for real with a child of their own.
They stood in silence, letting the minutes slip past, each lost in their own thoughts.
“You wanted to see me?”
“No,” he panted. “Want… Want you to come.”
Tony smiled.
Natasha glanced up from her phone, her lips curving into an unbidden smile at the sight of her girlfriend approaching. “Hey you.”
“Yeah. The rest of the team - and Happy - might need lawyers, can you get on that? And I need you to trace Steve’s watch. I need to find him.”
Sticking the cartons in the freezer, Tony rejoined Steve, smiling at the toddler eyeing him from Steve’s arms. He reached out, tickling her cheek with his forefinger.
Photo in hand, Steve climbed back to the ground floor.
Pepper pressed a shaking hand to her mouth and ducked her head. Natasha could picture the ring that Hogan showed her earlier sitting on her finger. It belonged there, but for a cruel twist of fate that was going to tear them apart again.
“I want to stay with him,” she said. “My mom is gone and I’m tired of being pushed around foster homes. I want a family. I want
It felt good to have a mission.
“No, but… Why did you do this?”
Ducking his head to try and avoid the paparazzi as much as possible, Steve opened the door and hurried across the sidewalk to Tony’s car, climbing into the passenger seat and slamming the door before the photographers racing towards him could get close enough.
He looked maybe eleven or twelve, and his expression was one of abject misery. Steve’s blood boiled. How anyone could have believed Tony was happy was beyond him. But there was nothing he could do about Howard or Maria Stark.
“Come on,” he muttered, trying the door again. “Come on!”
“Amora kicked our asses, so we kicked her ass, we sent her back to Asgard, and Thor’s taste in women will forever be under question,” Bucky declared. “Anything else? Nope? Debrief over.”
“None of them are that crazy,” Tony muttered. He paused. “Although remind me to look up Sunset Bain when we get out of here.”
Tony looked up and some of the tension was gone from his eyes.
“You got it,” she nodded.
“But I’m hungry!”
The car spluttered and wheezed and his heart sank. But then it coughed once more and the engine roared into life.
Nefaria began to chuckle, building up to a full laugh, but there was little humour in it. In fact, it was the wrong side of disconcerting, and Tony pulled Steve closer just in case.
“I’m sure calling them ma’am goes down brilliantly with men,” Steve said automatically.
Maria shrugged. “Told you he was wasted. Asshole got away without so much as a scratch too.”
Steve frowned. His heart broke a little for Tony, looking so lonely. Yet again, he cursed Howard and Maria Stark for condemning Tony to this existence against his will.
“You’re welcome,” Natasha replied, tasting the guilt again.
“Why?”
Steve was never very good at walking away from anything.
Bucky snorted, burying his face in Matt’s shoulder.
Tony gaped at him.
“Uh, Johnny,” the second boy muttered, ducking his head and burying his hands deep into the pockets of his jacket.
“No. But I can keep it together,” Tony promised. “Who do we have?”
“Wow, that’s a look,” Daniel said, joining Steve to watch an apple bobbing contest Tony and Zoey were dominating. “You two are getting serious, aren’t you?”
Tony scoffed. “That is not what I was doing.”
“He made us play dodgeball.”
“Better batten down the hatches then.”
“Apparently.”
The following morning, while they were watching
“I don’t go looking for fights. The guy was being an asshole.”
The silence pressed down on him, broken only by his own breathing.
Tony thumped his head against the elevator walls until the doors slid open, revealing the penthouse, and he marched out of the elevator and down the hall into his office.
Tony clamped his mouth shut before he could say any more, possibly triggering Steve further, but that didn’t stop the images flooding his brain; opening the closet to find Steve curled up in a ball, barely breathing and with tears streaming down his face. He could still remember the sharp acrid smell of vomit and see the blood on Steve’s fingers where he’d tried to claw the door open to no avail.
Clint shrugged - or tried to. “They were trying to extort money from the residents and I stopped them. And I had that money lying around from SHIELD and I didn’t know what to do with it, so I thought something good might as well come from all that bad, so I bought the building. I vastly overpaid and I thought they’d be happy ‘cause they got the money. Guess I was wrong.”
When Clint looked up again, he saw the tender look passing between them and barely suppressed the urge to groan out loud.
“Oh. Hey Clint. Didn’t see you there.”
“Frequent flyer, huh?” Tony asked. “How did this happen?”
“Pot meet kettle,” Steve muttered.
Bruce watched helplessly as she lit the joint and took a long drag. He knew he should stop her, but he didn’t know how. There wasn’t a chapter in the textbooks on how to stop the matriarch of your hospital’s biggest donor family from getting high in a closet.
“Holy shit!” Steve exclaimed, leaping away from the voice in his ear. His head whipped around and his jaw dropped. “Tony?”
“You’re one person, Steve,” Tony replied, his voice choked.
“Okay… Um, he doesn’t have an address listed,” Riri explained. “He’s never had an address listed in San Antonio. Um, as far as I can see, he is on a waiting list for housing. But that's it.”
“I’m not. I’m here with my roommate. James Rhodes.”
“And because of him, when I was a boy, we had nothing. You know, they always talk about how Tony Stark made his first circuit board when he was five years old. I was four. But I wasn’t the son of a billionaire, so I went unnoticed. Funny, isn’t it? A genius is only interesting if they’re rich. Or can be exploited.”
“Hank, it’s been twenty years,” Natasha intoned, returning to her paperwork because she had no respect. “You have
“I’ll try to remember that,” Clint replied. “Man, depression really isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.”
Steve shook his head. “Full fuel tank right next to it.”
“Is it true that Iron Man bought you a penthouse on the Upper East Side?” they asked.
“You sure this is okay?” Tony whispered, sweeping his hand through Steve’s hair again.
"If I break my promise, you can kick my butt,” Tony promised. When she remained unconvinced, he added, “And have all the ice cream in the world. Deal?”
Steve grinned. He picked up Tony’s knife, ignoring the way Tony instinctively flinched away again, and held it out, offering Tony the handle. Tony swam forward, wrapping his hand around the handle slowly and lifting it from Steve’s hand with a frown on his face.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said once they were back in the living room. “You’re taking really good care of me. I’m sorry I’m being such an asshole. I just, I hate being sick.”
“Ari,” Tony echoed. “Okay, Ari. Hold that thought.”
“Nice to finally meet you,” Tony smiled, letting Steve lead him to the door.
“Are you okay?” Tony demanded. He cupped Steve’s cheek, his hands cool against Steve’s skin. “Steve? Steve, what did he do to you?”
“Think he’ll be okay?” Steve asked as Stark ran out of the ER.
She was the one who insisted he take a vacation. She was the one who said it was mandatory and that Head Office was demanding he take his allotted annual leave before it reset in six weeks.
“Thanks,” Steve nodded.
didn’t work, then Steve would give up and go see Tony and do his best to save him on his own.
“Exactly,” he said. “Excellent point. Why didn’t I think of that? You want the Audi?” he asked and it took Steve a moment to realise that Tony was talking to him now.
He put his phone aside, shifting closer and leaning in to brush his lips against Tony’s temple. Tony closed his eyes and breathed him in.
But deep down, just this once, Steve wanted to be greedy.
“Steve?”
He and Tony made liberal use of the building’s gym, trying anything to get rid of their nervous energy. Matt flew down for the Fourth of July and he and Bucky dragged them out for dinner to celebrate Steve’s birthday, which provided a welcome distraction for a few hours. But then Monday rolled around and there was still no verdict.
“It’s funny,” Arnie smiled, watching Ellie, who was poking at the buttons on his shirt with a look of concentration that reminded Steve of Tony. “Until a few minutes ago, I would’ve said I didn’t have much worth living for. When you get to my age, Steve, you get tired. Tired of existing instead of living. But now, now you’ve given me something to live for.”
Nefaria chuckled. “You’re cute. I can see why he likes you.” Nefaria ran his fingers down the edge of Steve’s face. Steve tried to jerk away, the cuffs rattling as they bit into his wrists.
“When we have kids.”
“Seriously?” Steve chuckled.
“Move,” he rasped, his voice low. “I want you to move.”
“I woke up here. I know who the leader of the Maggia is. He’s the CEO of Dream Master. Luchino Nefaria. There was no casino, it was all a trap because he hates you. The Avengers. All of you.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Yes,” Angie nodded frantically.
“Was there a Tony Stark doing his residency then?”
“Steve,” she whined.
“No. Not that I know of. I’m pretty sure Pepper would object to him doing that.”
“With clothes on this time,” Steve grinned.
And with Steve’s permission, Tony began to move again, his hips jerking frantically as he fucked into Steve again and again, his pace speeding up, faster and faster, until his vision whited, his blood buzzed in his ears, and he was coming, barely holding himself up on shaky arms.
“You’re not going to, though, right?”
“We’re gonna talk about this later,” Steve retorted, wincing a little as his right knee started to cramp.
“Yeah,” he replied, moving closer. “You know him?”
“That’s not on me.”
Steve swallowed the lump that appeared in his throat at the sight of Tony and Ellie together. They looked nothing alike - Steve and Arnie were both fair so Ellie had inherited their blonde hair and she had Steve’s blue eyes - but the way they gravitated together was exactly like father and daughter, and it was a wrench to Steve’s heart every time he saw it.
He put the straining bag on the table and leaned against a chair to catch his breath.
“Steve?” Rhodey’s voice came through the apartment. “That you?”
“Yeah,” Bucky nodded, giving them a puzzled look.
“Can I ask you something?”
code has a code. And then-”
Would he?
Tony left Steve and Evie Rose at the table, rejoining the queue to buy a new bowl of ice cream. As he handed over the cash to the cashier, the woman behind him asked, “Aren’t you Tony Stark?”
A few more thrusts and Steve came, warmth flooding through him as he went boneless in Tony’s arms, burying his face into the crook of his neck and breathing in the smell of sweat and antibacterial soap.
“No one here would believe it. They know Tony.”
Steve eyed the distance between himself and Stane, and Stane and the door. He decided it was worth the risk. He and Stane were about the same height, and although Stane was broader, Steve was fast. High school track team fast. He could make it.
Clint blinked.
“Hey,” Steve grinned, letting himself into Arnie’s room. He leaned down to kiss his temple before transferring Ellie into his arms. She squealed in excitement at the sight of her dad, patting his cheeks with a little too much force until Steve pulled her hands away. “You look good.”
“Bye Bucket,” Tony added.
“Lorna here fell off her bike and while she’s waiting for an x-ray, I think we should get her some painkillers. She says it doesn’t hurt that much, but I think Charles would feel better if we did. Also, can you get her a sling and an ice pack to reduce swelling?”
And despite the fact Steve had been feeling off for three days now, the irritation flared up at Tony calling him on it, and he snapped, “I’m fine.”
“And yet, you recognised him instantly?
“You’re hilarious,” Steve retorted. “Asshole. What did you want to be when you grew up?”
Bruce huffed. Maybe it was the way the officer so casually dismissed Jessica as crazy, maybe it was the determination in Matt’s jaw when he told their story, maybe it was the assumption that a woman’s problems must stem from her trauma, or maybe it was just the feeling in his gut that said,
“They are impressive.”
“Don’t diss the gym selfies,” Clint called. “Thanks to them we have more followers than Justin Bieber.”
“Oh, and hey.” Angie rummaged in her bag before emerging with two cookies. “Here. For the road.”
in the upper right corner. When Tony opened the app, wondering where his self-esteem had gone, it informed him he had two new notifications. With unnecessary exclamation points.
“Steve,” Tony breathed.
Steve and Tony broke apart. Tony giggled into Steve’s shoulder, while Steve ducked his head, biting his lip and blushing adorably. It took great resolve to convince himself to step back from Steve’s arms.
“Hope, please!”
When they finally broke apart, Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s, trying to catch his breath and calm the fuck down.
(Her favourite dinner pastime was throwing peas at Thor, which he took with tremendous grace, always declaring that Ellie had a warrior’s aim when she nailed him in the ear.)
“It’s not that simple,” Natasha explained, hating herself for causing their expressions to drop. “Your heart stopped twice during the cath procedure. The fact is your heart likely isn’t strong enough to survive the operation.”
“Great. Thanks buddy.”
“Why would he not do a scan on your patient?”
Peggy peered over his shoulder. “Oh, I can’t remember his name. I haven’t actually met him before tonight. He came as a plus one with, uh, Val from the DA’s office, I think. Why?”
“Maybe if you take a look, you can figure out how to fix it?” Tony suggested.
“Right, sumptions about people,” Evie Rose nodded, “And you should only judge them on what you know about them. Well, all I know about him is that he’s called Tony and he bought me ice cream, so I like him!”
“You are definitely not my friend,” Tony scoffed.
“God, you’re amazing,” Tony declared, pulling Steve in for a kiss that was verging on inappropriate for the workplace.
“Okay,” Dr. Stark nodded. “Where?”
Peggy sighed. “I hate you both.”
Tony unclipped the seatbelt then reached up, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck. Steve heaved him out of the car, walking as quickly as possible down the sand to the tiny wooden pier. He sat down gingerly, easing Tony onto the pier, and sat back.“Here we are,” Steve announced, forcing a smile and swallowing his tears.
Tony Stark was standing on the other side of the table, smiling nervously at him.
“Thank you,” Lorna preened. “I like your hair. It’s pretty. I asked my dad if I could have green in my hair but he said no.”
“I’m sorry, sir, I can only release that information to the next of kin,” she apologised.
“Thanks,” he smiled, drifting towards the case she’d indicated to.
“I took two fencing classes at college,” Steve sighed.
Tony shook his head. “Statistically, most technology doesn’t have a great relationship with being underwater.”
Drawing a shaking breath, Steve nodded. “It, uh… Zoey wasn’t planned,” he explained, and give Tony his due, he didn’t react at the apparent U-turn in the conversation. “She was an accident - not a mistake, because a mistake sounds like something bad - but she’s one of the three best things ever to happen to Peggy and Daniel. And when she was born, I went to visit them in the hospital. And Daniel was holding her.” He smiled at the memory, still as clear in his mind’s eye as it was ten years ago. “And he was looking at her with more love than I’ve ever seen on anybody else. And I thought to myself,
“I can’t pay for a scan,” Bobbie argued. "Clint, I swear, if you-"
The buzzer blared, making Steve wince when it aggravated his throbbing head, as he poured tea into a travel mug.
They weren’t, right?
“Ooh, let me see,” Daniel said, shuffling closer.
“I went last time,” Tony’s voice called from within the jet. Steve’s heart jumped. Then he heard footsteps approaching and Tony appeared. His face lit up when he saw Steve. “Hey, you.”
Leaving the car behind, they made their way upstairs. When the elevator doors opened onto the penthouse, Ari was waiting, looking as wide eyed and nervous as he was the day Tony left for DC.
“No, he’s wearing scrubs,” she rolled her eyes.
And then he was left in an empty apartment with only the sound of the over-cheerful jingles of dog food commercials as company. Steve sighed, picking up the remote and flicking through the channels before giving up and turning the TV off. The silence of the apartment pressed down on him.
“Let’s go,” Bucky ordered.
Steve could hear nothing but the pounding of his own heart, but Tony could probably hear everything.
When Tony picked Steve up for their first date on his bike, guilty anticipation shot through Steve as he climbed on behind Tony, wondering what his foster father would say if he knew.
“Huh?” Tony tilted his head in confusion, and that really shouldn’t look as cute as it did, Steve thought.
“Why steal from me, bro?”
“Yeah, okay,” Steve agreed.
“Alright,” Steve called. “Does anyone have any questions?”
“It feels personal,” he said finally. “First Marco’s involvement, then the, uh, the aesthetic similarities between the Dreadnoughts and my suit. It just…” He huffed. “It feels personal.”
“Steve?”
“Good night, Princess Organa,” Tony said softly.
They separated slowly, both with red eyes. Steve cleared his throat, flicking away a stray tear, before pulling his keychain from his pocket. With a heavy heart, he worked his key free from the ring and held it out silently.
“Oh, uh, Dr. Pym!” Lang explained, arms spinning like a windmill as he stumbled back. Hank raised an eyebrow.” Well, Dr. Pym the senior,” Lang grinned. “Of course. Since we have two of you. What are you, uh, doing here?”
Buying noodles meant interacting with other people, even if it was only the cashier behind the counter at the local bodega. She was a nice kid, bright and bubbly, but chatty. Steve didn’t have the energy for dealing with chatty today.
The elevator pinged and the doors opened, revealing Ari waiting for him.
Tony froze. He turned to Steve, uncertainty flickering over his features, and Steve knew Tony was torn between duty and their plans.
“If you do, I won’t tell Natasha that you used up her favourite nail polish.”
But then his first class was the same. They were full of giggles and kept talking in hushed whispers, no matter how many times Steve tried to divert them back to the task at hand. He knew military history wasn’t the most interesting subject, but they’d all picked the elective and usually they were a good class.
With a groan, Tony flopped back onto the mattress and Steve curled into his side. He smiled when Tony raised his arm automatically to make room for Steve.
Stane half-dragged, half-carried Steve through the corridors. It took everything Steve had just to try and get his feet under him again, only for Stane to toss him to the ground by the pool. His elbow cracked against the hard tile, leaving his arm tingling and numb.
