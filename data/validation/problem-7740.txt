Tony nodded.
"It's not like that Tony."
Luckily, Tony lived close by and they made it there in under five minutes. Tony even let Steve set him down on the couch and head off to the kitchen to slice up fruit for his Omega. Steve was just plating the food and setting it on a tray when Tony whined, a high pitched sound that had his Alpha rushing to his side, the tray of fruit abandoned.
Steve wasn't sure if he was upset or excited, but then Tony was wrapping his arms around his neck and kissing him.
? Are you excited about it?"
Tony tried to get rid of the sappy look on his face, but failed. He didn't really care though. He pulled the door open and wrapped his arms around Steve. The Alpha was slightly taken aback. He had been concerned because the moment Tony's heat broke he had pulled away and retreated into the bathroom. That was forty-five minutes ago and when Tony didn't emerge Steve started to think maybe he regretted that they bonded.
Steve cringed at that.
Tony rolled his eyes.
"Tony?" Steve asked, like he couldn't believe that Tony was really calling him.
Steve nodded, clearing his throat and blushing.
"Mercy! Mercy!" Tony shouted, sighing in relief when Brock stopped.
Tony cut him off before he could continue to apologize, cupping his cheek and shushing him.
"No, you're not Steve." Tony shook his head in denial. "
"I don't like the way Alphas feel entitled to an Omega's body. Like Omegas are beneath them and only there for an Alpha's pleasure."
Tony raised a brow at him.
Alpha."
Tony always said that he hated Alphas and never wanted one, but the truth was that he hated how much he wanted one. Tony didn't want to be controlled and have his independence stolen from him. He was terrified that he'd find his soulmate and they'd turn out to be some sort of asshole Alpha that wanted him to drop his whole life and be some damn houseOmega.
The smile Tony got from that was blinding and his heart fluttered in his chest the whole way home.
Steve squirmed under Tony.
Tony had finally given in and invited Brock over.
So when Brock finally coaxed Tony out of the bathroom and onto the couch, Tony glared at Sam. He hated this Alpha for taking away his best friend. Brock tried to ease the tension, but Tony was too bitter to let go of his anger, so eventually Brock sighed and kissed Tony's cheek. They gathered up Brock's stuff from his room and left. Tony couldn't help but feel like Brock was choosing his Alpha over Tony.
"Eyes on the road, Alpha, or I'm gonna have to stop," Tony said with a pout. "And we both know you don't want that."
"Sam does seem nice... for an Alpha," Tony teased.

"If you need someone to go with you to take care of it, Tony-"
"He climbed into my lap, I swear," Bucky blurted out, then immediately cringed.
Steve blushed, rubbing the back of his neck.
Brock eyed him for a moment.
"I mean, not literally. It's all in the bank. Most of it's in my savings account since it earns more interest that way-"
Clint raised his hand like he was in elementary school and Tony rolled his eyes.
"It's all good."
"Yeah, whatever," Steve grumbled. "I'm gonna go start dinner."
"So, what is he like?" Brock asked, feeling much more alive with coffee in him.
Steve swallowed hard, groaning. His eyes flickered down to watch Tony's hand moving and Tony's eyes flickered up to meet his.
Tony refused to sit on his own, so he sat in Steve's lap instead and let his Alpha feed him, stealing kisses in between bites and cooing at his Omega. Tony just purred, scenting so pretty, like newly mated Omegas always did. He smelled of sweat and sex and Alpha, and Steve couldn't get enough of it. Steve was just as lost on Tony as Tony was lost on Steve.
Steve looked down at his feet, looking awfully small for a six foot, two hundred pound hunk of pure muscle. Tony took that to be a yes.
"I think he's going into heat," Bucky answered immediately.
Thanks for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting!
Steve was one of those fortunate few.
"No, I
"I can't believe you found your soulmate!" Steve said. "What was it like? Did you know the moment you met his eyes just like in the stories?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony rolled his eyes at his best friend's teasing.
"Shh, not now," Tony murmured. "Don't wake the baby or I'll be punishing you on Friday."
"Yeah..." Tony said. "I'm willing to give this a try though, but if you try to go all Alpha on me..."
Tony hummed, nipping at his lip.
Tony licked his lips and jumped down and Steve stumbled backwards, caught off guard by how close they suddenly were. Tony just giggled and headed off to raid Brock's closet for dry clothes, running his fingers through his hair in an attempt to tame the mess of curls.
"You're gorgeous, Tony, but for what it's worth, I love that you know what you want."
Tony smiled softly and kissed his cheek, still cradling Harley to his chest while he suckled at his nipple.
"I don't want anyone but my soulmate." Steve pouted.
"Relax, I'm only teasing you. I'm not jealous of your mate," Brock said, rolling his eyes and pressing closer to Sam, turning to press his nose into his neck.
Thanks for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting!
"Tony? Are you okay?" Brock called out, knocking on the bathroom door after he checked his room and found it empty.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn't drinking right now, well, not much. He had a couple of beers, but that was nothing. Just a little something to take the edge off before he went to re-meet Brock's new mate. Tony sighed, took one last look at his disheveled appearance and flinched away from it, grabbing his jacket off the back of the couch before heading out.
So yeah, Tony was glad that he didn't have an Alpha, but secretly he hoped he had a soulmate out there. He hoped that his mate hadn't died before they met and that they wanted him just as much as Tony wanted them. He hoped that they would have a fairytale ending, like in the stories that he heard as a kid about the kind and gentle Alphas that saved the day and rescued their Omegas. He hoped they'd meet and fall in love at first sight the way soulmates were supposed to and rush off to mate, because they just couldn't go another second without each other.
"And don't worry about not knowing what you're doing. I'm an Omega so I have the instincts for these kinds of things."
"I know what I said!" Tony snapped. "Don't use my own words against me. I confided in you and you used it against me."
Steve nodded, scooping Tony up into his arms.
"So you must be Brock?" Steve asked, grinning. "I just found my mate too."
"Yeah, well, I think most bosses disapprove of fucking in the employee's room. Even the not asshole ones.
Steve chuckled.
Tony pouted. He hated being teased.
"I'm glad things are working out for you, man," Sam said, his thumb rubbing circles into Brock's hip. "When do we get to meet him?"
"I'll do this for you everyday until the baby's born," Steve promised.
"That's infinitely worse," Tony said, flinging his hands up in exasperation. "You do realize that right? That's so much worse."
"Should I call 9-1-1?" Bucky asked, not entirely certain what was happening.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good. You're so good for me, Alpha. I didn't mean to upset you and I shouldn't have teased you like that. It was mean. Can you forgive me?"
Steve frowned.
"I can't believe it. This is amazing, baby! I'm gonna set up a nursery-"
Tony had nothing to offer him. He didn't want to fuck him, didn't have a knot, couldn't claim him. Tony couldn't give Brock any of that, didn't want to give him any of that even if he could. As much as he loved Brock, he didn't feel that way about him. He did feel miserable, all alone and unwanted. Tony curled up on the couch and cried, unable to even find the energy to drag himself to his bed.
"That feel good?" Tony teased.

I'd like to think that if he hadn't been having such a bad day and been in such a bad mood when they met that they would have had more of the fairytale kind of meeting and he would have called Steve as soon as he got off work
"Hm?"
Steve was a newly presented Alpha, barely more than a pup, only just having turned eighteen a few months prior, and he was eager to find his soulmate. Eager to start the rest of his life with someone else, to settle down, to start a family. He was an artist that had been lucky to make it big, thanks to some help from his friend, Sam, who had introduced him to Pepper Potts. Most artists struggled to get by on just their art alone, not many managed to make a living off of it. So few managed to make bank while still in high school.
"Tony, I've spent time with Steve and he's literally the softest Alpha I've ever met, and I'm mated to Sam so that's really saying something. My Alpha is totally wrapped around my finger."
, yeah, okay."
Steve chewed on his lip for a moment, considering something.
"No, no, something's wrong. I think I'm dying," Tony moaned dramatically, dropping to his knees and curling in on himself until his forehead was pressed up against the cold ground.
"As soon as you can hold your head up, I'm gonna let your daddy take you for a ride on the bike that you were named after," Tony cooed at him.
"Alpha. My pretty, pretty, Alpha. I love you so much, you know that right?"
"I'm still an Alpha, you know. I know that I'm not like other Alphas, but I still have pride, Tony."
"You're such a good boy for me, Alpha. Now start up your bike."
"Your hair... It's wet," Steve said lamely, touching the end of one of the curls that framed Tony's face.
"I'm really glad things worked out well for you, man."
"Wait? Are you serious? Tony, if you're joking then tell me now before I get my hopes up."
For the first time in a long time, Sam felt like maybe dreams really could come true. His soulmate - even thinking the word made Sam feel all fuzzy - went to talk to his best friend, so naturally Sam had taken the opportunity to go see his own best friend.
"Steve... what are you trying to say?"
Steve rolled his eyes.
"Yeah? He got a name? This pretty Omega of yours?" Brock mumbled into Sam's neck.
Tony hadn't fucked either of them, but he had no qualms snuggling up to them while they were sweaty and cum was still leaking out of Clint. He also had no qualms with sleeping on the other side of the bed while they fucked, just so he wouldn't have to be alone at night. As much as Tony wanted to be fine on his own, he really hated being alone.
The next chapter is the last one and the next fic is not focused on Stony, but all of these parts can be read and enjoyed individually. So if you like Stuckony you can easily just wait until the last part is out and pick up there.
"Tony? You okay?"
Tony had never told him he couldn't touch himself, so he hadn't even thought to ask permission first. Tony giggled and Steve loved the sound of it right in his ear. He groaned, his hand squeezing his base, applying pressure to try and find some kind of relief to the sheer amount of horny this Omega was inflicting upon him.
"I'm gonna get you some aspirin," Brock said.
Steve was definitely heartbroken though. The feeling of rejection was steadily creeping up on him and threatening to consume him. He held it together pretty well that second week, but by the time the third week hit with no word from Tony, Steve was depressed and had completely given up on getting to have that happily ever after he wanted. He had also given up on showering, spent all day in bed but never seemed to sleep, and the only reason he hadn't starved was because Sam kept bringing him food.
Tony released Brock, his hands on his hips like some sort of victory pose and then he was screeching indignantly as Brock shoved him off.
"Yeah? Because you like being bossed around?" Tony teased.
"Um, Tony?"
"You want to watch some TV while I cook, or do you want to come with me?" Steve asked him, his voice soft and his eyes softer.
Sam sighed.
"He's coming over to help me move my stuff in the morning," Brock admitted. "Don't worry though. I'll pay rent as many months as it takes until you find someone new. It's just, well, you know how it is with soulmates. I don't think I'd be able to sleep without him."
"I did, or at least I was like ninety percent sure about it."
"No, I don't mean that. We
"Tony, this is Steve, Sam's friend." Brock watched him anxiously, wondering how he would react.
"Cool. That's, um, cool," Steve said awkwardly. "It's not like I'm against having another one. It's just- I'm still not sure what we're gonna do with this one."
Steve raised a brow at him, chuckling slightly.
Brock nodded.
"What?" Steve wheezed.
Steve bit his lip.

"You know I'd do anything for you, pretty Omega."
I love how even when Steve's topping he's still totally focused on Tony and making him happy and even in heat and all needy and whiny, Tony still manages to run the show lol
"Text me when you get home, yeah?" Tony said with a smirk.
"Never," Steve whispered, like a secret whispered softly into the night, just for the two of them to hear. "I'll never leave you, Tony."
He showed up on Brock's doorstep and was relieved when it was Brock who opened the apartment door. Brock was grinning, but it faltered slightly when he saw Tony.
"You're sweet, but no, I'm good. If I take you with me I'm just gonna end up fucking you in the break room and then the manager is gonna be an asshole about it."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I can't believe we were both right." Tony shook his head.
Steve cooed at him and carried him into the kitchen. He set him down on the counter and Tony pouted. Steve just grinned at him, dopey and in love. He bopped Tony on the nose with his finger. Tony tried not to smile, but it was negated by the fact that he giggled. Steve's grin widened impossibly.
"Want you, Alpha!"
"Yeah, but you didn't hear it from me. They're not telling people yet," Tony told him with a wink.
Brock rolled his eyes.
"I think I'm gonna have to walk around shirtless for the next few years," Tony said with a sigh.
Steve blushed and stuttered out an apology that Brock waved off.
"I love you, Tony. My pretty Omega. I don't know how I got so lucky."
"Steve," Tony groaned, scooping Harley up and gently laying him back down so he was now sleeping by the wall instead of in between them.
If Tony thought that Steve made pretty sounds, moaning and groaning, whining and whimpering as he got closer to his release but struggled to push himself over the edge, then Steve thought Tony made the prettiest goddamn sounds in the world. Tony whined and whimpered and Steve could hear the rustling of his sheets as he squirmed on the bed, damn near sobbing as he got close.
"What?" Brock asked innocently, going to settle in his Alpha's lap.
This part isn't that angsty, but the next two? Oh boy! Those ones get angsty for sure
"Get your ass off my bar," Clint snapped. "Only paying customers are allowed to get all handsy on the bar."
"Right." Sam glanced anxiously at the bathroom door.
"Saying that in the presence of another Omega is dangerous."
Brock just laughed and caught the pillow.
"Of course you didn't. You just found out, Tony. You literally haven't even left the room and your phone is sitting on the coffee table. How would you have told him?"
"Well, I was actually gonna tell you about this, but we've just been so caught up in our own little bubble and I didn't want to burst it by bringing up legal stuff. Besides, I almost forgot about it with all the newly mated hormones rushing through me," Tony rambled.
"Right, well, you see, the thing is Tony that I have a lot of money-"
"You'd let me own you?"
"Hate to ruin the moment, but I've got wine," Bucky said handing a glass to Steve before reaching for a glass on the counter, "and for you--"
He could hear the shuffling as Steve did the same and then he heard the groan when Steve shoved his fingers back inside of himself, one hand holding his cheek, his fingers trying to dig in as far as they could go. Steve really wanted more. It wasn’t nearly enough, but Tony had said to use his fingers. Steve wasn't about to disobey his Omega.
Tony just groaned and heaved into the toilet.
Tony shifted on his lap, looking down at his lap nervously.
Steve whined again, but he wrapped his arms around Tony when he slipped off of him and pressed back until his ass was snug against the erection in Steve's sweats. Steve squirmed and Tony smirked, shifting slightly just to hear him whine again, the sound muffled as he ducked to hide his head in Tony's neck.
"Yeah, of course, come in."
Tony broke out in a grin, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck.
"I'll drive you," Steve offered.
"I know, because you're such a good boy," Tony murmured, kissing him. "Mm, as much as I'd love to stick around and let you fuck me on every surface in your apartment, I really have to get going or I'm gonna be late."
Tony rolled his eyes.
"Tony."
"Tony, please, don't be like that. I know you didn't want this. I didn't either. You know how much I hated Alphas, but then I met Sam and I don't know... he's amazing."
Tony swallowed hard, his eyes shutting, sleep evading him as the hours stretched on.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I hate that guy more every time you talk about him."
"There you go, pretty Alpha. Such a good boy you are, Alpha," Tony purred. "I'm sorry that I upset you, but you don't get to just pout about it. If there's something wrong you have to tell me. You don't get to keep things from me, Alpha, because you're mine. You understand?"
Tony shook his head, he wanted to go to Steve’s apartment. He liked sleeping at Steve’s, because he liked being surrounded by the scent of Alpha.
"Well, jokes on you. This baby's gonna have blond hair and blue eyes."
I love how much they're just lost on each other, like it's so sugary sweet and sappy but I love it. They're definitely in that newly bonded honeymoon phase
I love Tony being like and oh by the way I'm sueing my boss lol and Steve's just like I'm rich 😂
Steve nodded, whimpering.
"Go to sleep, pretty Alpha. You did so good for me," Tony murmured instead. "You sound so damn pretty when you're all frustrated."
"You said I did good!" Steve squeaked.
Steve whined back, sounding distressed because he didn't think he would get a release and the thought of staying frustrated all night, maybe even longer if Tony didn't give him permission to come in the morning, was just too much.
"Fuck, I love you."
"Now let's talk nurseries," Brock said when he pulled back.
"Um, yes?" Steve squeaked uncertainly.
"It was perfect.
Tony didn't know if he loved Steve. He knew he should, because they were made for each other. He thought that maybe he did, but it was too soon. He couldn't admit it to himself, let alone to Steve.
Thank God it was late and there was barely anyone on the roads, because Steve was certain that they would have gotten into an accident otherwise. It was damn near impossible for him to focus on anything but Tony, the feel of his hand accompanied by his teasing words. Steve drove slow though and they made it back to his place in one piece.
Steve pouted.
Brock rolled his eyes and Sam stepped in to steer the conversation towards less rocky waters. Steve continued to rave about his Omega and Sam nodded along indulgently.
Steve nodded.
Tony knew exactly what was happening, even though it had never felt this bad before, at least not so quickly. This was so sudden, the awful cramps, the heat coursing through his body, the slick pooling in his underwear. This was his body's way of demanding a knot when it knew it had one available, when it knew that its soulmate would come and provide exactly what it needed.
Brock hummed, propping g the pillow up behind him and grabbing his beer to take a sip.
to act like he had done you some great favor and made you work extra shifts to make up for it. He didn't even pay you overtime, even though he made you work like sixty hours."
He knew that he could go back to his work, but that just seemed wrong. If the Omega didn't want to see him Steve wasn't going to force him to. He definitely wasn't going to pressure his little mate. He wasn't an asshole.
"I love you, Alpha," Tony teased, his voice sugary sweet.
"More," Tony whined, grinding down on his finger.
"Put me on speaker," Tony instructed, putting his own phone on speaker and setting the phone next to him on the mattress.
"Yeah, fine," Steve managed.
"Fuck,

to do this and I'll support you in this in any way that I can," Steve told him earnestly. "I know that this is your fight, Tony, and I would never take that away from you, but if you'll let me, I'd love to fight alongside you."
Alpha. Steve was sweet and caring and didn't complain even once when Tony was needy and whiny and clingy. He rushed to fulfill every demand that Tony made, was desperate to please him, to make him feel good, and melted anytime Tony purred.
"Tony!" Steve squeaked.
Steve was still pouting when they went to bed that night, Harley curled up in between them. Tony really didn't think he would be so hurt by the comment, since in many ways Steve didn't seem like an Alpha. Sure, he was protective and he had a knot, but for the most part he acted more like an Omega, at least when it was just the two of them.
"Good, I want you to get your hand off your dick and finger yourself. We're both gonna finger ourselves and come untouched," Tony told him. "Sound good?"
Tony raised his brow at him.
"Shh, it's okay. I'm just happy you're here."
"But Sam would know that he didn't tell me," Steve pointed out.
"Shh, it's okay, pretty Omega. I'm gonna take you home."
"Yeah, but next time I'm gonna make you do all the work and I'm just gonna lay there and be the pillow princess. Let my Alpha take care of me," Tony said, his fingers trailing down Steve's chest and a sultry pout on his lips. "You'd do that for me, wouldn't you, Alpha?"
"I will shove you off the couch if you don't stop making fun of me," Tony threatened.
It was a cold day, windy and blustery with clouds hanging overhead that threatened to soak the inhabitants of the city as they walked down the street in large groups, pushing and shoving, each desperate to get where they're going before the rain ruined their hair or makeup. Tony was far less concerned and when the rain did come down and he was left with wet hair clinging to him and soaked clothes and a gloomy atmosphere that the rain couldn't wash away, well, he thought at least his hair wasn't sticking up all over the place.
Steve blushed bright red.
"We're buying the bar," Tony said to the group.
Steve flinched like Tony had slapped him.
Steve was staring at Tony, clearly just as caught off guard as Tony was. Steve looked far more put together than Tony did, like he wasn't completely miserable about his mate rejecting him, and didn't that just make Tony feel way worse about looking like a wet rat. Sam's confusion quickly gave way to understanding as he put the pieces together. Anthony, who works at a bar, and is Steve's soulmate. Of course it would be Tony. By the looks of it Brock was already aware of this. Sam sent Brock a stern look and Brock returned it with a sheepish one.
"You should have told me. You know how I feel about Alphas."
"Thanks, Bucky."
Alphas didn't have a g-spot like Omegas did, but this just made Tony coo at him.
Steve tried to take a deep breath, tried to calm down like his Omega told him to, but it didn't do much to alleviate his anger.
Steve looked nervous, certain that Tony was about to reject him, but he nodded.
Tony's voice let off with a squeak when Brock smacked his ass.
Tony smiled softly, a light blush on his cheek. His eyes landed on their baby in his sleep sack, laying on top of their thin covers. He doesn't know how he got to be so lucky as to end up with a perfect mate and a perfect pup.
Tony's eyes widened comically and Brock was too busy snickering at his expression to notice the flash of pain that flickered in Clint's eyes. Clint swallowed and busied himself behind the bar, so he wouldn't have to think about what that meant for him and Brock, or about the mark on his own neck that still haunted him when he saw it in the mirror.

"You know I wouldn't miss it for the world."
Steve bit his lip.
He smirked when Steve's eyes snapped up to meet his instinctually.
"I don't remember this play being quite so dramatic," Sam said to Steve casually.
"You did. You were eager to please and what you lacked in skill you made up for by being cute."
He wasn't sure where Steve was going with this.
"Why don't you just call him?" Brock asked.
Tony was just as hopelessly lost on Steve, his sweet, blushing Alpha. Tony fell into bed that night with a sigh, a grin on his lips. He just couldn't seem to stop smiling. Unfortunately, his smile did fade when the loneliness kicked in. He spent an hour tossing and turning restlessly before giving in and calling Steve. The phone only rang once before Steve picked up, sounding just as awake as Tony felt.
"It's grape juice, Tony," Bucky cut him off. "I wouldn't do anything to risk your baby."
Sam was older by nearly twenty years and had far more life experience than Steve did, but Sam also had a soft spot for the kid. It was probably depressing to admit that his best friend was a kid that still believed in dreams coming true, but it was true. Sam met Steve when the teen started volunteering at a homeless shelter that catered to vets who hadn't received the support they needed when they came home.
"Okay, well, I think we should all drink to that and to our new bosses."
"Don't laugh at me, brat. I'm being evil here."
"I think you were the one doing the fucking. I just laid there while you rode me."
"As you wish, my pretty little Omega."
"Okay, if it's really what you want then I'll support it and be happy for you. I'll support you no matter what choice you make, you know that right?"
"Oh really?" Tony said, his voice shifting to teasing, slower, smoother, thick as honey. "You being naughty, Alpha?"
"How old are you even?" Tony blurted out, feeling awkward and uncertain in a way that he hated feeling. He was so not used to the warm feeling inside of him or the desire to go to Steve and touch him and be held close.
Tony knew he was only teasing, but he still pulled away from Steve and shoved him off the couch. Brock gave him the most offended look from the floor.
Sam smiled a little sadly at him and sat up.
"What is it, pretty Omega? What do you need?"
"Come on, Steve, you know you want to. Just be a good boy and let me use you," Tony purred.
"Tony, love, just tell me."
, and no, he did not think that was an exaggeration.
Steve was immediately interested, holding his breath as he waited for Tony to continue.
"Yes, si- Tony."
He definitely would not love whatever asshole Alpha had brainwashed his best friend, turning him into a knot loving, Alpha pleasing houseOmega.
Tony blushed as he looked in the mirror, his fingers brushing over the mark on his neck where Steve had laid claim on him. He thought he'd hate wearing an Alpha's mark but this wasn't just any Alpha. This was Steve,
"You really are."
Sam smiled at Steve.
Steve snorted.
Steve drove much more carefully as he headed to Tony's place, calling Brock first to get the address since Tony wouldn't say more than
"Oh I'm sure," Tony scoffed.
"Yeah, I don't remember there being a fight scene."
"Then he kissed me and it was like fireworks exploded around us, and in our mouths. He tasted like heaven," Sam said dreamily. "He dragged me off to the bathroom and sucked me off in the stall and then I took him home and fucked him all night. Didn't let him off my knot until like an hour ago, when he said he really needed to go tell his best friend about us. That's when I came here to tell you, because you're
Tony glanced over at Brock and broke out into a grin. Brock smirked when the petite Omega ran up and wrapped his arms around his neck.
"Yes, sir. I understand."
I will continue the m,w,f posting schedule through out the next two parts which are both already finished.
Every instinct inside him was telling him that there was an Omega in need in there and he should help them, but he shoved the urge down. If Brock said his help wouldn't be wanted Sam definitely wasn't going to force it on Tony. Even Omegas who didn't hate Alphas didn't necessarily want an Alpha they didn't know to be around them when they were feeling vulnerable.
"No, stop, stop!" Tony squealed. "Seriously, Brock! I'm gonna pee my pants!"
Of course he did know, and of course he didn't really blame Brock for finding his soulmate. Tony couldn't help but feel slighted though. This was a lot to take in and Tony was kinda offended that Brock would just show up and drop something like this on him. He knew that when it came to soulmates everything was sudden, but that didn't make it easier on Tony.
Steve still had a hand wrapped around himself, but the fingers that had been inside of him were now wrapped around his phone.
Now Brock was leaving him again, but this time he wasn't coming back. He was going to live with his soulmate and pretty soon he'd forget all about Tony. Twenty years from now Tony would just be that roommate that he used to have that never got his shit together. Twenty years from now Brock would have pups that he had raised and devoted his life to and Tony would still be all alone.
"Um, yeah, of course."
"I'm saying that she saw some of my work, loved it, and put it up in her galleries. I've only sold a handful, but I've made a lot of money. Your bar is not that great, no offense, and I don't really spend much of my money other than for, like, rent and groceries, so there's a lot of it just sitting around. We could probably just buy the bar. That is if you want to be an owner of a bar."
Tony watched him as he cooked, teased him a little bit, made sappy jokes and gave him heart eyes when Steve blew kisses at him. It was all so cheesy and gooey and sugary sweet and all the other food related metaphors used to describe fools in love. Tony would make fun of anyone he saw act like this, but he couldn't find it in himself to be anything but thrilled. He had clearly fallen, and fallen hard at that.
"Yeah, but don't tell anyone. We're not telling people yet," Brock told him.
Brock snickered when Tony came over, his hand clasped in Steve's. Steve was trailing after him like a lovesick puppy. If this were a cartoon they would have hearts in their eyes and little hearts bursting all around them.
"Tony? You okay?"
Sam grinned stupidly, sighing and falling back on the couch, his legs over the arm and his head in Steve's lap.
Steve's eyes widened and he looked scared at the thought.
Tony whined as he fumbled with his phone, pulling it out of his pocket. His hands were trembling and he could barely unlock it before he was cramping up again and his phone slipped from his grasp, clattering to the floor, his arms wrapping around himself.
Tony rolled his eyes, but despite all their bickering and play fighting, they still ended up curled up together on the couch while they watched 'The Rocky Horror Show'. Afterwards Steve scooped up a passed out Tony into his arms, cradling his head to his shoulder and Sam scooped up Brock. Brock scrunched up his nose, grumbled something about not liking gremlins, before snuggling up to his Alpha. Steve and Sam shared a fond look that clearly portrayed just how in love with their Omegas they were.
Tony rolled his eyes at him, pulling away to plop down on the couch and kicking his shoes off. Steve shook his head in amusement, shutting the door and grabbing Tony's shoes to place on the shoe rack, before heading off to the kitchen to fetch some coffee for his spoiled Omega. Steve made pancakes, too, and all of his domestic work was made worth it when Tony smiled at him and murmured
Oof poor Steve, he is really not doing well and Tony is so stubborn and scared and I love him but I'm also like Tony just go be with your soulmate
"Yes, sir."
Tony and Brock burst out laughing and Sam reached over to thump Steve's back.
"Let's be clear, I still want your knot, but I'm in charge here and you do what I say or I'll throw you out and you won't get another chance."
"Steve's gonna be a great co-owner and let me do whatever I want with the place, so I suggest you kiss up to me, if there's anything specific you want out of the renovations," Tony teased. "Steve will also be very busy raising our child and being a work-from-home dad while he paints and helps manage the bar.
"Ah-ha!" Tony shouted victoriously when he managed to pin Brock down. "I have conquered you, evil sorcerer!"
Tony cut off his recounting of how Bucky defended his honor and then Tony got all upset, because he could totally handle himself and he did not need an Alpha to swoop in and save him, when Clint set down Brock's beer and pulled him in for a kiss. Brock didn't stop him immediately, but he pulled back with a groan after a few moments.
"Steve, stop, you can't think like that. You'll tear yourself apart if you keep thinking those kinds of thoughts. There's nothing wrong with the way you are and someday you'll meet someone who doesn't care about that."
a child."
Tony giggled and shook his head.
"You okay, man?" Sam asked him.
Steve choked on the bite of pasta in his mouth, coughing and pounding his fist on his chest.
Tony bit his lip and looked over at Brock guiltily.
"Yeah, me too," Steve said softly. "He's... perfect."
"Night, Tony," Steve managed, hanging up and rolling onto his side. He curled in on himself and the tears poured down his cheeks.
Brock grumbled about damn early morning people and refilled the coffee cup before joining in on the conversation.
"Mmhm."
"What's his name?"
"Why don't you grab me a beer while you're at it, baby?" Brock smirked at Clint who just smirked back, not nearly as annoyed as he pretended he was.
Steve blinked at him in surprise before smiling softly. He didn't want to assume that Tony was comfortable enough with him to use a nickname, but it touched Steve to know that his Omega was trying. Tony wanted to give this a try even if he was worried about it and that was enough for Steve. He would be the best Alpha ever, because he would be exactly what Tony needed him to be. He knew already that he'd give Tony anything he wanted and he'd try his best to be whatever Tony wanted him to be.
to do all of that for my Omega. I just know it. It doesn't matter that I like to get off while fingering myself. That won't matter once I have an Omega. I won't need to do that anymore, because I'll have my soulmate to get me off and even if I can't always get off that'd be fine. It won't be about me. It will be about them and when they need me to knot them I will. I'll make it happen no matter what."
"Yeah, um, we should clarify, that while I'm technically gonna be on the lease, it's really only because it looks good to have an Alpha on it," Steve said. "I'm an artist. Um, leadership? Yeah, that's not really my thing. Tony, though, he's gonna make a damn fine boss. So yeah, he's gonna run the place and work with you guys. I'm just gonna do the paperwork and manage schedules. That kind of behind the scenes stuff."
"Yeah, but you know I was an only child, Tony. Not from a lack of trying on my parents' part either. They went through three miscarriages before they finally used in vitro to have me. If this baby doesn't make it, I don't want to deal with a whole bunch of people pitying me while I'm grieving."
"I love you, Alpha. I should have said it last night, but I was scared."
"That I wasn't a
"Yeah and- Wait? Did you say Brock's pregnant?"
Brock nodded.
Steve sucked and licked at his neck, right where his mark would go, adding a second finger. Tony rocked his hips and rolled them, anything to get more pressure. He just needed more.
He immediately regretted it when Brock grabbed his ankle and pulled him closer, tickling him again.
"I love you, pretty Omega."
"That's- That was my soulmate," Steve said, somehow sounding both shocked and heartbroken.
can't be Steve."
"I think it's amazing that you're gonna do this and that you
"No, not that. I mean that
"So... I see you bonded," Brock teased, clearly amused.
"You've got a visitor, pretty boy."
"Oh, no, I can't--"
"I'm glad you both stopped being stupid, but you need to stop being so damn awkward."
"I'll be right there. Tell him I'll be right there."
"Oh," Steve said, unable to hide his disappointment.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him before smiling a little too innocently.
"Yeah, whatever. I guess I can allow it. As long as you know I
He didn't know Steve, so he had no way of knowing, not that he really thought Tony would put up with that kind of shit. Even strong headed people like Tony could end up in abusive relationships though.
No matter how much Brock promised Tony that he wasn't leaving him alone, that they were still best friends and Tony could come visit him anytime he wanted, Tony didn't believe him. He couldn't believe that things wouldn't change. Of course things would change. Everything would change and Tony hated change.
“Just focus on rubbing my feet, Alpha.”
"Yeah, I'm great, Alpha," Tony murmured, scenting him. "Make me some dinner, won't you?"
Steve laughed, shaking his head and walked over to offer Tony a hand up.
Tony shook his head and Steve's brows furrowed.
"Hey, you okay?"
Brock raised a brow at him.
"You little brat," Brock growled playfully, sounding almost Alpha-like.
They were both panting hard and Sam glanced over at Steve, leaning closer to whisper in his ear.
"You're gonna love him, Tony."
Bucky wasn't quite sure what to make of that and Steve wasn't quite sure what to make of Bucky, but he didn't have time to think too much about it.
"Yeah, I'm in love," Tony said just as dreamily.
"If I was I wouldn't be curled up in bed right now after letting you fuck my brains out."
"Tony?" Steve said, shocked by the unexpected sight of his Omega, his hair disheveled and sticking up all over the place and a pout on his lips.
"If you don't get a release, Alpha, that's really not my problem, but if I don't get my release, then we're gonna have a real problem. So why don't you be a good boy and get some fingers inside of you? Open yourself up and make pretty sounds for me to get off on."
Tony groaned.
"You look young," Tony pointed out.
Thank God for Brock's meddling otherwise who knows what would have happened with Steve being so worried about offending Tony by showing up at his work and Tony insisting he'd run in the opposite direction lol
Despite his grumbling, Tony pressed closer and purred happily.
"Yes, sir," Steve whispered, feeling breathless like Tony had reached inside his lungs and stole the air from him.
Steve paused, like he was considering something, but then he just thanked Bucky and hung up.
Brock and Tony were rolling around on the ground now, trying to pin each other to the ground and making very dramatic declarations about fighting for their honor and the honor of their people.
"No, he'll be upset if you try to help him. He hates Alphas."
Tony shook his head.
Brock groaned.
Tony blushed bright red and bit his lip as Steve rubbed a towel over his head. There was something so tender about the way he did it that made Tony feel strange. It was a good kind of strange, but strange nonetheless. When his hair was as dry as it was gonna get Steve set the towel down and they just stared at each other for a moment.
"Yeah, well, I guess forever has come to an end."
He didn't
wasn't part of the plan and
"Then what happened?"
"Yeah,
Brock rolled his eyes, but he smiled softly and pulled Tony in for a hug.
"Who else would I have heard it from if they're not telling people?"
an Alpha, but he kinda wanted one. Wanted someone to hold onto, someone to cuddle with and be close to when the night fell and the darkness of his mind crept in like the shadows that surrounded them. Tony wished there was somebody there to pull him out of his mind as he spiraled, laying on the couch, an empty bottle on the ground. He was numb and yet he hurt so much. How was that even possible?
Brock laughed.
Tony felt like crying.
"A bar. He was the server there."
"I don't know. Sam?"
"Good boy," Tony purred in his ear, his tongue darting out to lick his neck, his teeth sharp on his skin.

"Don't shush me. I'll shush you, stupid Alpha," Tony grumbled. "Shhhh."
A shy smile crept onto Tony's face and his cheeks turned pink.
has completely changed. It's a lot, but I was scared about Steve, too, and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Maybe this baby will be like that too."
"What do you mean?"
Steve laughed and pressed a kiss to his hair.
"Okay, I get it now, but can I at least tell Steve?"
Tony raised a brow at him and Steve squirmed.
"Text me, yeah?" Tony ran his hands up Steve's chest.
Brock frowned.
Tony giggled and kissed his cheek.
"Tony, you don't really want me to fuck you out here on the street, do you?"
"Nope, if I ever see him again, I'm running in the opposite direction. Anyone who can make me feel this miserable is bad news."
Brock blinked at him for a minute before narrowing his eyes.
Bucky relaxed, nodding.
Tony nodded, groaning in pain.
"With you," Tony mumbled, blushing and hiding his face in Steve's neck.
"Okay, then, pretty Alpha. You want to play, then let's play," Tony said, coming as close to a growl as an Omega could.
Tony gasped softly when their fingers brushed and Steve's eyes widened in shock. It was like a spark shot through them both and rushed straight down south. Steve instantly felt his cock throb to life and Tony's hole twitched, getting slick in anticipation of his Alpha's knot. They stared at each other for a moment, before Tony tore his gaze away and scurried off.
The pace of this story is so quick compared to tempting, then again this one is much shorter so it makes sense. Still I love it and Stony is like so sugary sweet in the next chapter.
"You can't escape, little princess. I will have you as mine," Brock said with an evil laugh that had Tony bursting out in laughter.
"Whatever, just tell me how long I have to find a new roommate," Tony grumbled, feeling bitter about the whole thing.
"Yeah," Steve agreed, heading for the door.
"No big deal? It's a huge deal!"
Tony smirked.
Steve rolled his eyes affectionately and kissed Tony's cheek.
pregnant."
"Or she," Steve amended. "I don't care either way. I just hope the baby's just like you."
perfect. It was just like in the stories. Our eyes met and we were drawn to each other. We both knew exactly what was happening and I fell in love before he even opened his mouth. Then he told me that if I thought he was going to be some mindless Omega that obeyed his Alpha's every command that I have another thing coming." Sam laughed.
"Love you too, babe," Brock teased, winking at him.
"I was t-touching myself," Steve confessed, his voice barely audible.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam really hoped it would be, and he really hoped that Steve would meet his soulmate someday. Not everyone did and even those who did, well, things happened and not everyone got to keep their soulmates their whole lives. Steve nodded, but bit his lip nervously.
"Nope, not joking," Tony told him with a grin, but a part of him was nervous that Steve would be unhappy about it.
Tony couldn't help the blush on his cheeks and the grin on his lips, but he hid his face in Steve's chest so his Alpha wouldn't see.
"You like to finger yourself, Steve?"
Steve felt bad that Sam was spending his evenings consoling his best friend, instead of with his own mate. It really wasn't fair, but Steve was still grateful for it. He was miserable, but it was easier when Sam was there. It was easier when they were watching movies and laughing. Sam was good at distracting him when possible and being a shoulder to cry on when Steve couldn't hold it together and broke down into sobs.
"I'm going to be a good Alpha, Sam. I'm gonna be so good to my Omega and give them everything that an Alpha is supposed to give their Omega. My mark, my knot, my pups. All of it," Steve said, determined.
"I can't. I threw away his number," Tony groaned.
Tony shook his head.
Tony grinned at him.
"Nah, I can get myself home just fine," Tony said, smiling.
Clint rolled his eyes at them.
"Tony, I'm not sure I can come untouched."
Just like that the sun was shining again and Steve grinned at his Omega.
"Hey, no, stop," Tony told him. "I love you so much, Alpha, but I don't want that. This was my battle to fight and I wasn't about to let you take that away from me. I've been dealing with this bullshit for years and now I'm finally changing things. You have to let me do this."
"Thank you, Alpha. That means a lot, and I mean, there's no guarantee that the next person who buys the place will be any better than Pierce, or that they will hire us all on again. There's really no guarantee anybody will buy the place anytime soon. Realistically, it'll probably be bulldozed and turned into a parking lot for the diner next door or something like that. We all know that we're probably gonna lose our jobs, but it's worth it to do the right thing and put Pierce behind bars."
"Tony, stop!" Brock called out to him. "Don't make me run after you."
Steve nodded, because there was nothing else to say about it. If Tony said this was the way it was going to be, then this was the way it was going to be.
Tony hummed, kissing him again.
Tony sighed as he walked away, but his attention quickly turned to Harley.
Tony huffed.
"Yeah, I get that feeling."
, said, a fondness to it that made Bucky's heart ache a little.
There were murmurs and nods of agreement. Bucky stood up and grabbed the bottle of wine on the counter.
Sam answered in his underwear, told Steve to keep his voice down when he started to excitedly tell him about his night, and headed to the kitchen to make coffee. Despite Sam's best attempts to keep Steve quiet they still woke his mate, who apparently was not a morning person. Though to be fair, Steve had woken him up at six o'clock and not many people were excited about being awake that early, especially if they didn't have to be.
Poor Tony! He's so lonely and just wants to be loved, but he's terrified of it too and honestly putting yourself out there and trusting someone else to catch you when you fall is terrifying.
"Yeah, I do," Steve mumbled shyly.
"I know you feel that way now, but someday you might feel differently. Maybe you'll meet a different Omega, or even an Alpha."
"I haven't told Steve."
turned on.
Steve couldn't believe his luck. Why someone like Tony wanted someone like him, Steve would never know, but he was thrilled to have the opportunity to prove himself to his Omega.
Steve whimpered, wiping tears off his cheeks.
Tony was upset when he got home and the light in their apartment was off. Sure, it was so late that it was practically morning, but he knew that wasn't why the lights were off. This time he knew it was because his roommate, his
"Whatever you want, pretty Omega. I'll give you whatever you want," Steve promised, pulling out his fingers.
Sorta
"Yeah, this kid's so fucked," Tony teased.
"Do you want some space?"
"Sam helped me out a lot when I was a kid. He helped me turn my life around and he helped get my art into some galleries. He's got this friend, an ex of his, Pepper Potts. She's like a brilliant business woman and she runs her own company, but she also has a few major art galleries where she displays art from some of the most prominent artists in the states. I'm talking big shots, well known artists that make hundreds of thousands of dollars selling one painting."
"Good boy," Tony purred.
"Why do you sound guilty? What are you doing?" Tony demanded.
Tears pricked at Tony's eyes. He wasn't worried about not liking Steve, well, he was worried about that. Mostly though he was worried about falling too hard, too fast, only to be rejected. He wasn't the kind of Omega to just submit and say
"So you're what? Eighteen?"
"Would you rather me bend over the table and let him knot me?" Tony asked sweetly, batting his eyes at Brock.
"And I wasn't. Which is why you're on the ground," Tony taunted, sticking his tongue out.
"You can call me Tony."
"I gave him my number!" Steve defended. "Besides, he was working."
Steve sucked at his neck, his hips rutting forward at the threat.
Steve blushed, but he was grinning too.
"Fuck you!" Tony whined, kicking at him.
need your compliments to know just how hot I am."
Steve furrowed his brows.
In this au being soft is synonymous with being submissive, so Omegas are supposed to be soft and Alphas aren't, which is why being a "soft" Alpha is seen as a negative thing and Steve tends to have a negative view of his desire to be submissive or bottom
"Yeah," Steve said dreamily. "I can't believe we're gonna be parents."
Sam's Omega snapped at them to shut up when he entered the kitchen, ranted about how Steve was way too sunshiny for someone who was awake before the sun, and then stole Sam's coffee. Sam just smiled fondly at him and wrapped his arms around his waist, letting Brock lean up against him.
"I'm legal!" Steve said defensively.
"I'm not saying you have to, but you know I'd never judge you even if you did fall in love with an Alpha, or if you wanted to fool around with one or even just date around. Whatever you want, whatever makes you happy, that's what I want for you."
Tony grinned at him, standing up on his tiptoes to press a kiss to his cheek.
Steve grinned at him and leaned down to kiss him.
"Probably not."
"Tony you are the farthest thing from stupid," Brock told him, but then he smirked. "Though you do stupid shit constantly, so maybe you are pretty stupid."
"I have a table to wipe down."
"O-okay, sir."
"Yeah, but I'm not an Omega."
Tony gave him a look.
... I..."
"Tell what?" Sam asked.
"Oh my God. Oh my God! We're having a baby!" Steve practically shouted to the room in his excitement and scooped Tony up into his arms.
Brock tickled his sides.
All the chapters in this series are short (between 1-3k words), but all three parts are fully written and I will be updating it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, since the chapters are so short.
"We need to talk."
He regretted it instantly when Steve's face fell.
Brock laughed and nudged his shoulder.
Tony shook his head.
"Do you want any help?" Sam asked, concerned.
“Yes, sir,” Steve teased.
"Fuck, I love you so much. You know that, right?" Tony groaned against his lips.
The bar where Tony worked wasn't exactly high end, but it wasn't awful. He kinda liked his job, even if his boss was an asshole. His coworkers were great and he got free food on his break, so it wasn't all bad. Tony was a server, Clint worked at the bar making drinks, and Bucky worked in the kitchen. It was a small place so it was usually just the three of them.
Tony licked his lips, not sure he wanted this at all, but he owed himself this. He needed to at least try or he'd always be left wondering if it could have worked out. Besides, Brock was not going to let this go until Tony at least gave it a try. He swallowed down his fears and nodded. Brock nodded, pressed a kiss to his cheek, and pulled Sam deeper into the apartment. Steve and Tony stared at each other and it started to feel tense and awkward.
Tony sighed.
"No, I'm setting up the nursery and Brock's gonna help me since he's also pregnant and we're gonna have matching nurseries."
"Really? You want me to humiliate you, Alpha?"
"I need my Alpha."
"'Course, I'd do anything for Tony."
"So he didn't knot you and now you're obsessed with him?"
"No, um, this is Bucky. I, um, work with Tony. He told me to call you."
"I didn't say the baby was gonna
Tony was wide awake now and horny.
"Um, I'm not that young."
"Shut up," Tony grumbled. "I hate it when you say smart shit like that. It makes me feel stupid."
"I'm just kidding, Alpha. We'll wait until I stop breastfeeding this little guy and then we can try for another one. Until then, I'm going on the pill."
"Yeah, I know, but I'm still anxious about it and I'm not entirely sure why. I know it's ridiculous and I know Steve's gonna be thrilled."
Steve swallowed hard.
Steve nodded.
"Yeah, I guess," Tony said, because he didn't know what else to say to the odd request.
"We-" He said, gesturing between him and Steve, "Are buying the bar. This way we can all keep our jobs, have decent fucking pay checks, get the benefits we deserve, and just overall have a positive work environment. Sound good?"
Brock nodded, fitting the pieces together. He hoped he was wrong, because he had a feeling that if he was right that Steve might not ever get that call he was hoping to get. Brock didn't say anything about it, because he didn't want to worry Steve, but it seemed like too much of a coincidence.
Bucky helped Tony up off the ground and into the break room. He then went to talk to Pietro who was working the bar and told him to call his sister, Wanda, in to cover the rest of Tony’s shift. When he returned to the break room Tony was curled in on himself, but he reached out for Bucky when he saw him.
Bucky relayed the message to Tony who started sobbing, maybe from relief now that he knew his Alpha was on the way, or maybe just because he was overwhelmed and in pain. Bucky wasn't quite sure. He could hear rustling and a door creaking open and slamming shut over the line.
"Yes, Clint? Do you have something to say to the class?" Tony said sarcastically.
"No, I don't know, actually," Tony snapped.
"I hate you," Tony muttered to Brock.
The first night when Steve didn't get a call from his soulmate he convinced himself that he was too tired when he got off his shift to call him, that maybe he didn't want to call him so late. Totally reasonable. Steve barely slept that night, staring at his phone for hours and willing it to ring before dragging his butt out of bed at the crack of dawn and heading over to Sam's.
until the baby's born," Tony teased, wiggling his toes.
He pressed closer, slipped his hand into Steve's back pocket to pluck out his phone and pouted when he realized it was locked.
Steve just scoffed and shook his head.
Steve's mouth opened and closed a few times like he was trying to say something, but couldn't quite get the words out.
"No, he did, but it's not as bad as you make it sound. I'm
Tony bit his lip, looking at his reflection in the mirror. His hair was sticking up in weird places from trying and failing to sleep last night. There were bags under his eyes that made him look like he hadn't slept in weeks and, well, really that wasn't too far off. Sometimes he drank enough to pass out for a little bit here and there, but he never just got a solid night's sleep. To be fair, Tony didn't sleep all that well even before he found his soulmate and then pretty much rejected him by never calling him.
"Yes, we've established that," Brock said, watching Tony carefully. "What about
Tony narrowed his eyes at him.
"S'good, Alpha," Tony slurred. "Gimme more. I need your knot."
have a
Tony wasn't sure how long he laid there, but he must have fallen asleep on the couch at some point, because he woke up to the sound of a key turning in the lock. Tony groaned, cursing and stumbling off the couch, clutching at his head when it protested the sudden movement, and rushing to the bathroom. Brock saw the empty bottle on the ground by the couch when he opened the door, told his Alpha to wait in the living room and headed off to find Tony.
Thanks for reading, leaving kudos, and commenting!
"Baby, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I shouldn't have let you work for a guy like that. I'm your Alpha. I should have protected you, provided for you so you didn't have to work-"
"But he's so out of it, man. I'm not even sure he knows it was me," Bucky added just as quickly.
Steve's blush deepened at being called a pup, but he didn't object to it. The moment Steve was within reach Tony grabbed his shirt and slammed their lips together, turning them so he could shove Steve up against the wall. Tony's hair was still dripping wet and his shirt was drenched. It got Steve wet, soaking through his own sweater, but he didn't care.
"Say mercy," Brock insisted.
"Do you think he knew? Think he could just tell somehow?" Steve asked at one point.
Tony wanted all of those things, but he also cringed just thinking about it. He was not a damsel in distress. He did not need some Alpha to come and save him. Tony was just fine on his own. He'd survived this long without an Alpha, though he had to admit he would miss snuggling up to Brock, and Clint on the few occasions that Brock dragged him home and fell into bed with him.
Brock brought Tony aspirin and a glass of water and held him when he broke down crying. They sat on the bathroom floor for a while, Tony curled up in Brock's lap, sobbing and saying he didn't want to be alone and he just knew that he was going to be alone forever, because who could ever want an Omega as fucked up as Tony was.
"Y-yes, sir."
Tony smiled a little at that.
"We made a pact!" Tony whined.
"I don't know. I know that I
(See the end of the chapter for
Ever since then Sam had taken to mentoring the kid, supporting him when his asshole father only seemed to tear him down. Maybe it was Sam's fault that Steve had such unrealistic expectations about life and soulmates and happy ever afters. Sam had made a point of telling the kid, who had been so scared and broken when he first met him, that he could do anything he set his mind to and he could have anything that he dreamed of. Sam didn't regret building up his self-confidence, he just hoped the world didn't let the boy down.
"0-8-1-0," Steve offered up unprompted.
"You didn't tell me you were coming," Tony accused, but he giggled when Brock scooped him off his feet and set him up on the bar.
Brock still looked concerned, but he nodded and stepped aside to let Tony in.
Sam smiled back.
Steve set Tony down when Bucky cleared his throat.
Steve whimpered, his head falling to the side to give his Omega better access. Clearly, the goddess knew what she was doing when she paired them up, because this was better than Steve had dared to hope for. Steve had always been excited about having a mate, but he had always thought he'd present as an Omega. When he didn't, he was concerned that he'd never be a good enough Alpha, but the moment he saw Tony in that bar he knew that he was in love, knew that he'd do anything to please this man.
"Alpha?" Tony mumbled sleepily as Steve started up his bike.
"I am... um, Steve," Steve managed to get out, blushing over how awkward it was.
Tony just giggled.
"I do and I love you for that."

. Tony was wrapped around Steve, rutting up against him and rubbing his ass on Steve's crotch, which wasn't exactly safe seeing as they were on a motorcycle going forty-five miles an hour.
Steve grinned.
Realistically, there should have been more employees. Obie was just cheap and refused to hire any more people than was strictly necessary to keep the place running, even if it would run much smoother with a bigger staff. They did have three part timers, twins that attended the local college and Thor, an older Norwegian guy who was always in good spirits, that filled in the gaps in the schedule.
"I don't like Alphas," Tony blurted out when the silence dragged on.
Tony was wiping up a table when Brock walked in and Clint whistled, calling Tony's attention to him before pointing to the door.
It was like the thought of Tony calling him on his break was the most adorable thing ever to Steve, but in a way, one that Bucky couldn't quite pinpoint, it seemed almost more like an Omega inquiring about their Alpha's day, than an Alpha asking their Omega a question. Bucky wasn't sure why he felt that way and he immediately shook the strange feeling away. Bucky couldn't say anything for a moment, a lump in his throat.
This series is just a side project I've been working on recently. I just really needed something fluffy and sugary sweet that wasn't smutty and apparently I prefer my fluff with a heavy side of angst lol
like you. You know, brilliant and stubborn."
Tony entered into a small hall, kicking off his shoes before heading further into the apartment. He froze when he saw Steve sitting on the couch next to Sam. Tony's heart raced in his chest and his mind was thrown through a loop, because what the fuck was his soulmate doing here?
"You're gonna be a great daddy, Steve," Tony promised.
"Good, well, um, you should probably get him out of here."
