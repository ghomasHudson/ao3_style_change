“I knew you liked attention, Spangles, but I didn't realize you were this much of a slut for it. Poor little Brooklyn kid will do anything to turn a dime, huh?” Tony had drawled, smirking at the flushed and embarrassed Steven. He tossed Rogers clothes on the floor in front of him and a couple of dollar bills, knowing that his eyes shone with the malice that filled his heart. And like the utter jack ass he had been, he had walked away.
A stilted silence rippled through the room. He could hear Rogers’ heavy breathing, the thrumming of his own irate heart beating against his rib cage. The humiliation that twisted his guts and threatened to rob him of breath. After a minute of weighted silence had passed, Tony spoke.
How an honorable man like Howard Stark had begotten a weasel like Tony, Steve would never know. If it hadn't been for Howard Stark Steve would still be a poor, weak, kid from Brooklyn. He and Bucky both had earned one of the coveted SI scholarships. Upon meeting Howard for the first time Steve had had an asthma attack that had nearly killed him. Concerned, Mr. Stark had offered a new medicine his company was developing. It would be risky but it could potentially take care of the asthma, the allergies, and the illnesses that Steven was riddled with. It had done more than that. Much more. Steve owed everything to Howard Stark. Which was the
Tony’s lips compressed into a thin line, his gaze darting up to meet hers then back to the cucumber.
“Aggressive wildlife, huh Rogers?” Tony plucked a feather out of his hair, brushing the dirt off his pants and onto the floor, eyes narrowing at the amused smile that hid inside Steve’s eyes.
They weren't the only ones who were stunned. Perhaps as early as tomorrow Tony Stark would become the Omega mate of one Captain Steven Rogers, aka Captain America, who just so happened to still be carrying an eternal flame of burning hatred for him.
With that Captain Steven Rogers released him abruptly, then turned on his trim heel and strode through the stunned crowd like a hot knife through butter.
Rhodey’s eyes fluttered shut for a moment. He took a deep breath as if searching for his zen, which he frequently did whenever they hung out together for some reason, before opening his eyes.
Rhodey gave him the side eye. “Don’t be ridiculous, Tony. You’ve already cooked dinner. I’ll just get cleaned up and then we can eat. I’m looking forward to it.”
“Do you have any idea,” Steve began after a little while, in a calm voice that belied his actions, long strides eating up the ground as he about faced and made his way out of the woods and back towards the packhouse. “How worried we all were when you didn't come home? The entire pack is out looking for you right now. I told you to tell me if you went hiking, Tony.”
Thank you so much. You guys have no idea how much your reviews mean to me. Some days were tougher than others and then I'd check my email and there would be this review just sitting there - you guys made the hard days more bearable. I really appreciate it. Thanks for making me smile :)
“You’re so…” the aghast exhalation was followed by a stream of vitriol. “Are you kidding me, Stark? What is this? Too afraid to take it to the mats? I always thought you were a bully, but never a coward. As if you would actually...Is this an Omega apology? You expect me to believe-” he came around the table, his boots polished to a neat shine entering the corner of Tony’s field of vision. “That you’re actually sorry?  You can spout off at the mouth but won't bother to try to back it up. You think I don't know that this isn't some weird little mind game? Well guess what Stark, you know how a true Omega apologizes? With his mouth.”
, Tony.” Steve grit out, after a few minutes of brittle silence. Tony startled as Steve began to gently wipe at his face with a damp cloth, eyes narrowed as he checked him over for scrapes and bruises. “You must’ve hit your head here.” he murmured, probing at the sore area gently. Tony tried to jerk away, Steve wouldn't let him.
“Tony…” Rhodey warned, voice starting to become strangled as he saw the face of the man stalking toward him.
“Colonel!” Steve’s voice was starting to get the dangerous growly undertone to it. “You’re out of line.”
Steve felt the corner of his lips twitching as he nodded with forced solemnity. “I think I’ll pass on the bacon.” he said, proud of the evenness of his voice. “Thank you for making breakfast, Tony. How’s that hand?”
“No. No. A thousand times no,” Tony’s lips firmed, the defiance in his eyes wavering for a moment as he belated added “Alpha.”
I had big plans for this chapter. Huge. It totally veered off into a different direction. Things happened that were not planned. *shrugs* But don't fear my friends! I have explanations and angst coming up in the next few chapters. Poor Tony :(
Tony had always been above the law. Brash and wild. He did whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to. Even Howard had not been able to reign in the young Tony Stark. Steve’s eyes narrowed. He wouldn't make the same mistake. Afterall, Tony was Howard's son and there was bound to be some familial love there. There was none of that between Tony and himself. Tony was going to find that his days of doing whatever the heck he wanted were over.
“Look” Tony’s hand lashed out, curling across a forearm so broad that he couldn't wrap his fingers all the way around. He had to settle for clenching his hand in the fabric of Steve’s tailored suit. For a moment he felt as if he were a small child again, tugging at his father’s sleeves, begging for him to
It took a few minutes for Tony to familiarize himself with Steve’s kitchen. He felt like a thief rifling through the cabinets at the ass crack of dawn, trying not to be too loud lest he wake sleeping beauty.  The need for coffee thrummed in his brain, pulsing and pushing at his temples. When he found the coffee beans a delighted sigh left his lips. At least he knew how to work the espresso maker/coffee machine. He had designed this particular model himself, afterall, only last year.
How wrong he had been. The pranks had only gotten worse. More dastardly. More humiliating. In the end Stark had humiliated him in front of the entire school, and then had the audacity to knock up Steve’s girlfriend, Peggy. When he had heard Stark making disparaging remarks about Peggy, having no intention of making an honest girl out of her, Steve’s control had finally snapped. He’d beaten Stark bloody up and down the halls of Trinity. And Stark? That crazy bastard had merely spat out a mouthful of blood and
Getting down the mountain and through the woods was grueling with a sprained ankle and bruised ribs. By the time he had reached the bottom he was drenched in sweat and the sun was dipping beyond the horizon. He could hear the soft, tentative, clucks of the feral chickens in the distance. His jaw ached from gritting his teeth. He was tired. Dirty. Bruised. All he wanted to do was stop and just rest for a bit, but fear of what would happen if he wasn't back in time kept him pushing stubbornly onward. A sudden rustling of feathers had him looking up.
Without moving a muscle, Tony raised his eyes to Steve’s briefly before dropping them back down again.
“I don't want us to be at war constantly.” Steve continued on a pained sigh. “I know we don't like each other very much, but maybe we can still make this work. I’m not going to lie to you, I would never have chosen you as a partner if not for the, uh, extenuating circumstances. We are bound to get into disagreements… but I would never
And with that she strolled out of the kitchen, hips swaying with deadly grace. Tony shuddered. That lady gave him the heeby jeebies. He had liked Nat when he had originally met her during his holy-shit-I’m-gonna-die phase. To be honest, he still liked her. He just didn't trust her.
Irritation bubbled in his veins, but Tony tossed another smile that didn't quite reach his eyes over his shoulder. “Thanks Boss, will do.”
Tony groaned, rubbing his eyes. It was funny that after a six hour nap he could still feel so exhausted and burnt out. Giving the driver a thin lipped smile Tony nodded his head and hopped out of the car, duffel slung across his shoulders and sun glasses firmly in place.
Tony sighed, pinched the bridge of his nose, and muttered “I should just let him cook in that damn suit. I really should. Serve him right.”
“You know, I don’t usually take my clothes off unless I’m getting paid for it.” Tony couldn't help but snipe, his teeth clicking shut as he cast a cautious glance toward Steve. He shouldn't have bothered. Captain America was studiously staring at the wall across from him as if his gaze could cut through it if he tried hard enough. Apparently his snideness was enough to get the rest of the crew moving. They left the kitchen, leaving Tony alone with Steve and Bruce.
Tony stiffened at the derision and condescending tone. “Listen, Rogers, I know that we have a rough history-”
“Sit still.” he turned as Clint, Natasha and Bruce walked into the kitchen. “Bruce, I think Tony might have broken his ribs. Can you take a look at them?”
He knew that the board approved list of potential mates were all willing to work with Stark Industries to hobble the wayward Tony. His Mate would have his vote on the board, Tony’s personal fortune (which was nothing to sneeze at) in his hands, and be able to either force Tony to create more weapons for Stark Industries, or stop him from creating anything at all.
Lila giggled, her hands clapped to her mouth as she bounced from foot to foot in excitement. Cooper gave him a grin and a nod. “We’ll have to work fast. But it will be
“I mean, 15 oranges seemed like a lot at the time but the blender seemed to do okay with it until well, it didn't.”
Tony made a small, strangled noise in his throat, his shrewd gaze taking in the curious looks from the rest of the pack. Quickly becoming mortified, he ducked his head out from under Steve’s arm and scurried, yes scurried, away with the kids toward the launch site - ignoring the soft laughter behind him.
Tony rocked back on to his heels. One arm slung casually across his chest while the other reached up to rub at his goatee. “Let the record show that I am wondering if and when you are going to mention any actual expert here. Because Justin Hammer? Certainly does not qualify.” He waved his hand in a sweeping, dramatic, gesture toward the still smoking War Machine, a frown pulling at the corners of his lips.
Rhodey looked at Steve, his gaze sliding back to Tony who gave a half shrug of permission, before he met Steve’s eyes again.
“Ah! Dad! No!” Cooper’s shouts to his left made Tony falter for a second, almost ready to turn around and intervene. But he should have known better. Clint was no Howard. When Tony turned his head to look Clint had Cooper on the ground, smearing glitter across his son’s face as his other hand mercilessly tickled the boys ribs until they were both laughing.
Everyone assumed that Yinsen had been the one to build and design the suit that saved Tony’s life all those years ago in Afghanistan. He had, after all, spent a lifetime cultivating an image  of  a womanizing partier who rarely took anything seriously - including his education. When asked about it, and about the identity of Iron Man, Tony would smile vapidly into the camera and admit that he had been instrumental to the making of Iron man; he had the very important task of picking out the color of the suit. His idea. Red and gold, wasn't that flashy? Probably the most important part, right?  As far as who piloted the suit? Well someone much smarter than him, that was for sure. One of the scientists at the lab  who wished his identity to remain a secret. You know how it is. He’d smile and shrug, turn to watch with the crowd as Iron Man cut through the sky above them all.
“You think I had something to do with designing the armor, huh? Thanks for the ego stroke. You know I love it when people stroke my ego.”
“What are you-” It was then that Steve saw where Stark’s gaze kept dropping to, then darting away from as if scorched. The belt in his hand. He dropped it, the clatter of the metal buckle against the wood plank floor loud in the otherwise silent house.
Tony couldn't help his instinctive flinch as Steve reached for him, but instead of the blow he had been anticipating, he found himself up ended and flung over Steve’s shoulders. He let out a soft groan as his stomach made contact with the hard, broad shoulder of his Alpha.
“Nah, I got this covered, appreciate the concern though Sourpatch. Oh and uh, that kid I bullied, no big deal, not like it means anything or any-”
Hey there folks! Thank you, thank you, thank you for all of your lovely comments. I can't begin to tell you how much they mean to me! They were the driving force behind finishing this chapter. I'm going to go now and respond to them individually, but I wanted to get this chapter up first. I know its been a while, I've just been a tad busy between work (THAT'S RIGHT, I AM ESSENTIAL lol) and homeschooling my rapscallions.  I hope you liked it! I THINK we will be seeing Rhodey next chapter... but no promises. :P  As usual I apologize for my crap grammar and any spelling errors you may have encountered. I hope they weren't too glaring. Let me know what you thought of this one.
Well, there's chapter 4! Hope you enjoyed it! Thank you all so much for your comments and kudos. They mean the world!
“You have two options, Omega.” Steve’s voice was sharp as a cracking whip, “We can go down to the gym. Get you into some padding. Go a few rounds.” The almost violet gleam in his eye showed how much he was hoping Tony took that suggestion. “Or you can get on your knees, right now.” He continued, his voice quieter and deadlier than Tony had ever heard it. “And apologize for the disrespect you showed your Alpha.”
“That was actually terrible. Like legitimately the worst thing- it should be considered an actual war crime. Did you try to poison me?”
Steve had been the most normal of all. Peering up into the branches overhead, with a good natured sigh he had simply climbed the tree to get the rocket back going hand over hand. The good Captain had no flair for the dramatic it seemed, Tony mused with a secret smile. Tony had still been impressed none-the-less, watching the play of muscles as Steve hauled himself up that tree. The way Steve’s shirt clung to those broad shoulders, the flex of the muscles in his biceps, the-
A flush of embarrassment pinkened Tony’s cheeks and he instinctively shook his head in denial. “I can walk-”
Steve took a deep breath, forcing himself not to laugh or sigh at the absurdity that was Tony Stark. What had he been expecting, really?
“It doesn't matter. There are cookbooks in the kitchen. Stick to the basics. If you put in half the amount of effort you put towards all the drinking and partying you like to do, you’ll learn in no time.”
And so, without a word of complaint, Tony had merely gritted his teeth and picked it up, not bothering to argue or point out the obvious; that Bucky was just trying to humiliate and belittle him. After all, fair was fair. How many times had Tony done this to Steve and Bucky? The only difference being that he had been 16 or 17 at the time, and full of vitriol. On his hands and knees he swept up the little particles of cereal at Bucky’s feet. When he was finished there was a flush of color to the Alpha’s cheeks. Something that rolled across his eyes and looked an awful lot like shame. After that incident he hadn’t had a problem with the winter soldier since. Maybe Bucky had been expecting a fight, verbal or physical, who knew? What he clearly hadn’t expected was for Tony to just take the bullying quietly, as if it were his due.
Still, despite thinking himself prepared to meet Tony Stark for the first time, Clint found himself struck dumb as Tony sashayed into the dining room.
“Can’t let you go unscathed,” Steve murmured with a wink, dragging his bedazzled hands across Tony’s cheeks and through his slightly too long hair. Tony sputtered beneath him, laughing, his own hands pressing against Steve’s chest and pushing the laughing Alpha off of him.
“I’ve seen your twitter, Stark.” Rogers said only that morning with an apologetic shake of his head. “And I get that you want to go online but our pack is still new and vulnerable.  We really can’t afford any bad publicity right now. The recommendation from the higher ups at SHIELD was to lay low for a little bit. Let this whole mating thing blow over. They don’t want to give the media fuel to add to the fire, you know? If it makes you feel better you’re not the only one who has to go dark.”
“I tried to get you out of dinner, multiple times, if you’ll recall. You’re the one who can’t take a hint.”
“Shit, shit, shit,” Tony was cursing to himself, his back to Steve, waving his hand in the air before plunging it beneath a stream of what Steve assumed was cold water coming out of the tap.
Rogers’ eyes narrowed. “And what makes you so sure I’m the right choice, Tony? Maybe I made the cut for a reason. Maybe,” this time it was Rogers stepping into his space, claiming the distance between them unflinchingly. Tony couldn't help but stumble backward, caught by a hard hand wrapping itself around his tie as quick as a snake and jerking him forward. “ Maybe,” he continued “it’s about me watching you squirm. Making you beg. Because believe me Stark, I haven't forgotten what you said and did to me all those years ago. Maybe I do want you at my mercy. Maybe I do want you to suffer.”
Bruce was another story. For the most part the scientist kept to himself, only occasionally coming over to the packhouse unless for a training exercises that required his presence, and a meal or two during the week. He seemed to be a little stilted, a little withdrawn, from the rest of the group. Tony supposed when you could turn into a giant green rage monster at any second it was difficult to let down your guard and just hang. Tony could relate to that in a way, and found himself engaging the scientist in mild conversation whenever he was around. Well, mostly Tony talked while Bruce did his daily crosswords, but they had a camaraderie going, which was nice.
It was hard to imagine his high school bully as anything but an egotistical, snot nosed, Alpha. And although it appeared as if Tony was still the same egotistical asshole, he sure as hell wasn't an Alpha. Steve didn't know how he had missed it before. How the entire world hadn't seen through the smoke screen Tony threw up around himself. An Omega shoulder checking him in the hallway? An Omega tripping him? Pushing him down the stairs? It went against their very nature to hurt others. So why the hell had Tony narrowed in on him? Focused on making Steve’s life a living hell and no one else’s?
“Hey Tony…” Steve rubbed the back of his neck, his gaze sweeping down and away. “If you wanted, I mean, my  bed is plenty big and we’ve shared it before so…”
“Anytime, Sourpatch.” Tony patted his friend's sweaty arm and immediately regretted it. It had taken him about twenty minutes to get Rhodey out of War Machine without damaging it too badly in the process. Tony was working with rudimentary and pilfered tools, not his full workshop or lab back home, otherwise he would have had his buddy out of that suit in mere minutes. It was probably better for Rhodey that Tony wasn't at home- because he certainly wouldn't have given the state-of-the-art tech back after finding out that his pal had let Hammer put his grubby, untalented, little mitts all over his baby.
“I, hey, no lets… get up.” A strong hand cupped his elbow, pulling him up from his painful kneeling position. Tony couldn't help the reflexive jerk backwards, ripping his elbow out of Rogers’ grasp. Instead of admonishing him like his father would have done, Steve merely lifted both hands up in a placating gesture.
his monthly visits into the city, and he knew he didn't have a choice but to kow-tow to this roid rager’s dream.  He kicked his chair backward, sent it hurtling across the wood floor behind him. Satisfaction and anticipation gleamed in Steve’s eyes. He opened his mouth, but before the Alpha could say one more inflammatory, degrading thing, Tony sank to his knees. Head bowed, neck exposed, arms crossed behind his back - arching his spine, gaze to the floor. He struggled to bring passivity and calm to his face, forcing himself to take even and deep breaths.
Tony walked that path for a good hour before heading back, the muscles in his calves tight. He had worked up a good sweat, and lunch was due to be made soon, but he could afford to take a quick shower before he started desecrating the kitchen again. He entered the eerily quiet house, lost in his thoughts as he trudged his way up the stairs and to the small bathroom at the end of the hall. Closing the door behind him he stripped off his dirty clothes, letting them fall in a messy heap to the floor, before starting up the shower and getting in.
Steve scoffed. “Lets not pretend, Stark. You’re here today because I owe your father my life. He was one of the best men I’ve ever known. You can pretend all you want that it’s about Stark Industries, but I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on the wire and let the other guy crawl over you.”
Tony looked off into the valley before him, squinting to see if he could spot another homestead nearby.  After close inspection there were at least two that he could see in the distance. Tony stopped midstride to take a fortifying breath.
Tony was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Which was, he thought with a bitter twist of his lips, the understatement of the year. Over the past three months things had seriously began to fall apart for the former CEO of Stark Industries. At the age of 31 he had been at the helm of his father’s company for nearly a decade. It was a sad start, to be sure, taking over a multi billion dollar company after both his parents were tragically killed in a car accident. But the young Stark had managed to do it in stride. To some he was America’s golden boy, but most people  considered him a playboy. He drank too much, he partied too hard, he was too wild and unpredictable. His early twenties had been a string of bad press. When he wasn't making a splash across the headlines with his latest scandals, he was buried in work.
“Always a way out,” Steve scoffed before he leaned closer, elbows on the table and blue eyes cold as an arctic wind. “You may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.”
A grimace contorted the planes of his face as he forced himself to take a deep breath. He had lived with an Alpha like this one before. He knew what was expected of him. He knew that any challenge would only be met with brutality and hostility. That was what Alphas were, all that he had ever known them to be. He could go into the gym, probably surprise Steve by getting a few licks in before the Alpha cleaned the floor with him with his superior strength. But where would that get him? He
“Okay, just let me know when we need to head up.” Steve called after him before walking out of the cabin, on his way over to Nat’s place to go over a couple of “logistical” things.
Tony stepped back, his hands fisting helplessly at his sides. “Look you read the contract. You know..” he swallowed quickly, eyes flashing away from Rogers’ piercing blue. “You know that I won’t have control of my accounts, my company. I’ll have nothing except for what my mate deems it appropriate for me to have.” He couldn't help the disgusted snarl that tore at the corners of his lips.
“Glad to have you back, Big guy.” Tony stuck out his hand, like he was trying to show all was forgiven.
It was only later that Tony realized that he kind of wanted another hug from Thor. With Thor’s hugs there was no pressure, sense of obligation, or doubt. He was just a guy that liked hugging his friends.
Steve turned to look at him. “Too bad the one guy who knows is long gone. Sam’s completely lost sight of him. He’s on his way back to help here.”
“No arguments here, I’m just glad it wasn’t me.” Clint shrugged sheepishly, but his easy demeanor didn’t quite reach his eyes.
Steve placed a steadying hand on Tony’s back. “This wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t let Morbius slip through my fingers.”
Tony was damn glad that Natasha had been the one to go up against the Soldier. Tony could admit that without the suit he’d have been toast. As it was Natasha barely subdued him.
Even the most bitterly cold winter in Steve’s memory (1930, Brooklyn, in that ramshackle tenement they had moved to earlier that year) couldn’t match up to this long, frosty sprawl, but Sam never missed their morning run, so Steve didn’t either. Yet just when Steve had begun to think the winter would never end–
A vampire leaped at Steve, fangs open wide, and Steve bashed him aside with his shield. The vampire crumbled to ash, as did any that Morbius turned.
“Not if I see you first,” Tony quips before the Bleeding Edge armour seeps out from the housing unit on his chest. Steve is mesmerised by the armour slinking down over Tony’s ass as he strides away.
The Assemble alarm blares over the tower’s sound system, cutting Steve off. They both simultaneously glare at the ceiling speakers, then look at each other, but the moment is lost.
It was a memory of leaving for MIT for the first time. They’re all there, Jarvis, Howard, and Maria. They are right in front of him. His mother goes in for a hug, but even before Tony can wrap his arms around the hologram, he knows it isn’t right. There is no hint of the cloves, hot pepper, and carnation notes in her perfume, only the sterile smell of the lab.
“Who’s on watering duty?” Steve looked around the common room from where he was crouched next to the planter. Col. Rhodes chose a nice sunny spot for it, close to where everyone gathered to watch movies.
He didn’t know why this was happening, what she was thinking, but it was nice and he wasn’t ready for it to stop.
“I plead the fifth,” Tony said, trying and failing to disguise a fond look. Then he squeezed Steve’s butt. “Now go get this ass of yours into spandex while I slip on something a little more metallic.”
Tony’s eyes widened, as if shocked by the confession, tears brimming.“You have bad taste in men.” He leaned against Steve, eyes beginning to flutter closed, and it felt like acceptance.
The firefighter costume clutched in his hands, Steve fell into step with Tony, or maybe it was the other way around. "Sounds great."
Later, Tony couldn’t stop the warm feeling that spread throughout his body when he heard that the next person that tried to touch Hazel ended up with broken bones. Tony had a history of being attracted to people he probably shouldn’t, but this one took the whole damn cake.
Steve closed his mouth with a click and began ringing Tony up, his expression unreadable. Was he disappointed? Relieved? Tony noticed the tips of Steve's ears going red and covered a smile.
Sam, Clint, and Natasha fell into providing cover for the evacuating civilians, while Hulk, Thor and Steve thinned out the enemies. There was no sign of him yet, but JARVIS informed them that Tony will join them soon. Steve hadn’t been sure Tony would be able to make such a sudden call.
Tony mentally stumbled over the reminder that the Cap in the old films he watched so many times in his youth was actually Steve. It was surreal, especially since they were a formative part of his masturbation habits. What Steve didn't know, couldn't ruin their awkwardly budding friendship. It was damn lucky that Steve was as dense as a handsome brick about these sorts of things. He didn't even question why Tony had the time to hang around and watch him pose in a sexy firefighter costume. Tony cleared a very busy schedule just for this PSA.
“Do you have any idea how to fix it?” Steve asked, tearing his eyes from the plant to look over at Thor. “Loki’s your brother; you must know something about magic.”
Steve muted the comms line and took a deep breath of smoke-tinged air and let it out. There was a familiar clank as Tony landed on broken debris. Much of the base suffered damage in the attack, not all of it from the Avengers. Thankfully it seemed like the data center was still intact.
There were more seeds, but unsurprisingly the birds had found them and were stuffing them into their beaks. Every single one Tony could see from the shelter of the tall grass was snapped up before he dared to dart out and get it. Finally he found a pile of them closer to the house that the birds hadn’t even touched.
So what if Thor liked giving hugs? That didn’t make Tony any less needy for asking for one. He couldn’t even think of a way to say it that didn’t sound pathetic. Tony made an effort to loosen all the tension he had unconsciously built up and act normal.
“No, no suffering on the agenda here.” Tony’s skin crawled at the mere thought. “In case you haven’t noticed, we’re the good guys. We’re not in the business of torturing people.”
Steve’s heart jumped at the press of Tony’s lips against his. Smiling, he whispered, “You don’t like sappy?”
Execrating himself from his teammates’ warm greetings as politely as he could, Bruce strode over to Tony and got a brittle smile in return. Tony’s sunglasses prevented Bruce from seeing the hurt in his eyes, but the fact he was wearing them was more than evidence enough it was there.
Burgundy fabric twisted around Tony, pulling him up against a warm body. He tried to wiggle loose, but it was to no avail.
Steve stopped, white breath clouding the air around him, to look at the little shoots of green and purple peeking out from the scant layer of snow left on the ground. Winter at the compound stretched languidly through the months. By October frost had begun to creep up the windows and no sooner had December hit than snow had started falling in great drifts. Even now, deep into March, the cold lingered in the air.
Tony snorted. He didn't believe that many people besides Steve cared about his welfare, if his personal experiences were anything to go by.
All that remains is a large crater and a plume of dust covering the field. Steve is gone. All his tracking and biometric data has been cut off--like he’d been wiped from the face of the earth. With a burst of his repulsors, Tony rushes over, looking for some sign that Steve was still there, that he was
Moments later, the act was dropped; the Soldier likely having decided he wasn’t fooling Tony. He threw a sharp smile and a slight shrug Tony’s way as if he were saying, “at least I tried.” It was more than anyone else got out of him, so Tony tried to press his luck.
“You didn’t want to,” Tony replied solemnly and shrugged again. “Anyway, I didn’t want to ruin your birthday.”
Steve sighs and looks up at a line of wild geese heading south for the winter. A gust of wind blows through the pine trees surrounding the lake. Tony is gone.
Tony noticeably tenses and makes an inquisitive noise, even as his chewing speeds up to try and clear his mouth.
Tony crouched down to look beneath his bed, but there wasn’t so much as a dust bunny. Rising to his feet with a groan, and damn did that make him feel his age, Tony began systematically searching around every piece of furniture in the room.
"Friday, any updates on the outlaw formerly known as Captain America?" Tony said, replacing the bottle cap.
How he had tilted his head back, trying to get a good view of where it rose up behind Grand Central. The way it stood out like a sore thumb in the semi-familiar skyline with its strange curves and jutting platform, perfectly exemplifying the future in his mind. Though it had been rather ugly to his eye, he hadn't been able to resist taking up his pen and sketching it.
"That's what collections do Steve, hang around because I can't get rid of them for some damn reason!" Tony growled. "And I can't stop adding to it because it'd break the old man's heart to see something of yours in someone else's hands, so it just sits there, probably creating a fire hazard in the dusty manor I called a childhood home."
Stark was tired and thin, not to mention reluctant to lean into Fury’s arms, but Fury could understand that. He knew what kind of life Stark had led and it wasn’t one that lent itself to this kind of affection, but that didn’t mean he didn’t need it. Someone besides Fury might have been a better choice to provide it, but these were hard times and Fury could damn well man up and give the boy a hug, as awkward as it was.
Tony sighs, closing his eyes. “I never really believed in this sort of place, but you’re not who I expected to find here."
Steve blinked and blinked again as his eyes were filled with a thousand glittering lights. He twisted around, taking in the fountain and cars, the gleaming white statues and building. This – was not where he had been a moment ago.
Feeling as if he was approaching the Cave of Caerbannog, Tony stepped inside the cell. The Soldier meekly stayed on the bed while Tony came through the door, only shifting once Tony took a seat. They faced each other, the Soldier twisting towards Tony and Tony leaning over the back of the chair. Silence hung heavy in the air between them as they assessed each other.
“That’s not true. You’re one of the best men I know. Do you think I would have fallen for you otherwise?”
"No, they probably see us fight each other and like the way the sparks fly. Belligerent couples are fun to watch. It's all the hatesex."
Tony didn’t answer, only shot – Happy? Why was he so young – a meaningful look before ducking into his car. Steve caught the car door before it closed. His mind was reeling, but he knew he couldn’t just let Tony leave.
Hazel appeared to consider this for a moment with his piercing blue eyes centered on Tony. Heart thumping, Tony licked his lips and tried not to fidget. Then Hazel shook his head, dismissing whatever was going through his mind.
Not technically Steve/Tony (yet), but it's the first five in a series of hugs for Tony I've been posting to tumblr. Includes:
Written for the 1000 members celebration on the Bringing Food to the Lab: Stony Fic community on Imzy
Steve sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. “Never mind, I’m the one that’s around the tower the most, I’ll handle it from now on.”
“Their defenses are focused on the south side.” Steve gestured to the hologram projected over the mugs of lukewarm coffee and the napkins covered in crumbs scattered across the conference table. “So we come in here, just north of –”
Tony had found some food on his forage if his chipmunk cheeks are anything to go by. He looks up when Steve enters the room and visibly brightens, though he can’t smile due to how full his mouth is. He waves his fork in greeting.
“We know why it crashed, the Hammer drone that snuck on board exploded. We should definitely look into how it got there later, but right now you should stop avoiding the question.”
A bird, just discovering this catch of seeds, virtually untouched, came in for a landing beside Tony. Just like that, whatever was holding Tony there was broken and he fled into the tall grass.
Tony swallowed and tried to get back on track. “Do you know why we went through the trouble of catching you?”
“Thank you,” Tony whispered, finally bringing his arms around to rest on Natasha’s back just as lightly as she had hers.
Steve shakes his head to clear it of that dazzling image, before dashing out of the room to get ready himself.
Steve sighs and nods, feeling himself shifting into Captain America mode. “Suit up. I’ll see you at the landing pad.”
Tony flew in and landed on the tower platform where Pepper was waiting for him. He kept his pace steady as he walked over, though he wasn’t sure if he wanted to run to meet her or avoid her altogether. How could things ever be the same between them?
Steve wipes his hands against the leg of his pants, absently thinking that if he keeps nervously sweating like this, then he is going to have wet patches on his thighs. That is something he doesn’t want to have to explain.
Holding two mugs of steaming coffee, Steve peered into Tony’s lab through the glass. “JARVIS, is Tony in a meeting? It’s dark.”
"Sorry, Mr. S-stark," Peter stuttered before letting go as quickly as he grabbed Tony in the first place. "I just, whenever I, um, you know my uncle, I used to, so I wanted to, uh."
Steve cupped the mug close to his chest, letting the warmth from the cider seep into his skin. Taking a deep breath, he breathed in the fragrant steam and snuggled deeper into his blankets. It was about as quiet as it ever got in the city. Rain pattered rhythmically against the window pane, harsh and cold, and Steve could hear the sounds of passing cars and distant music.
Steve peeled off the top part of his uniform, then after some debate, shucked his pants too, leaving him in only his boxers.
The Soldier just grunted softly in response, like he couldn’t care less what Tony called him, and tilted back his head to reveal the white column of his throat. His supposed indifference was belied by the amusement in his eyes as he gazed at Tony through long lashes. The Soldier, Hazel, was humoring him.
“How so?” Steve asked. He was gently stroking the feathers on Tony’s cheeks in a way that made Tony want to- well he wasn’t quite sure what he wanted to do but it involved waving his tail and wing (arm?) feathers around. It felt quite nice.
Tony immediately pivots, throwing everything he has at the magician before the worst can happen, but it’s a miscalculation. As soon as the magician goes down, the light balloons outwards in slow motion, engulfing Steve and then collapsing in on itself.
“What I want is to know what Hydra’s next move is. They wouldn’t have shown themselves if they didn’t have something big planned.” Tony searched Hazel’s impassive face for some sort of clue. “We have other sources we can tap, but I figure, someone like you, who’s been with Hydra for years and has been involved in so many of their plans? Well, you’ve got to know the juicy details.”
“It’s kind of a relief that he was turned into something that has such a large presence on the fossil record,” Bruce interjected into Clint and Natasha’s unflattering opinions about Tony’s new form.
Nat shook her head. “It’s not – unless this is a pattern. Are you guys saying the things you really need to?”
Happy didn’t like this, putting his hand on Steve’s arm to pull him away from the car, but Steve would not budge. “Tony, please, I don’t know what’s going on, but I need your help.”
Steve smiled and pulled his attention back to the battle plan. “Right, well, we’re gonna hit them here and take out the power generators. Tony, you’re our lead on that. Thor, you cover him.”
That night, after Thor returned with slumped shoulders and a look of defeat, Steve had Col. Rhodes help him transfer the plant to the new pot. Steve could have done it by himself, but he thought it might help.
Tugging at Steve’s uniform, Tony said, “Come on. We need to get you out of this so you can warm up.”
Tony huffed and relaxed, prepared to wait it out, but moments later folds of cloth slowly came loose, freeing the two men.
He wandered back to the common room, wondering what it all meant, if anything. He left the coffee on the counter and sunk into the couch.
When Steve finished the transaction, Tony presented the bouquet of those small flowers, nearly the color of Steve's eyes, back to him. "These are for your bedside."
Sam shrugged. “You and Stark were always weird around each other, but I can’t say I saw it going in that direction.”
Steve, who has been basking in the warmth of Tonys hands, and the brush of his thumbs over his shell, doesn’t quite know what comes over him. It’s like watching it happen to someone else, his flippers reach out and connect with the sides of Tony’s face, slapping him rapidly and repeatedly.
Steve yelled, “Doctor! You don’t have to do this! Come quietly and we can get you the help you need!”
It was hard enough smuggling the battered and soggy box into the car without anyone seeing it, if any of the Avengers, especially Thor, saw he’d rescued some kittens, it’d be all over social media. Maybe when it became time to find them new homes…
So he did what he did best: he invented something new. Binarily Augmented Retro Framing was the culmination of years of research, all the efforts of scientists across the world, brought together by him. It was dazzling, alluring, and painful, those migraines were no joke. It was like he was really there, changing history. That’s what it felt like anyway.
Sam glanced at the little shoots. “Crocuses. Hardy little things, always seem to pop out before everything else. I guess Spring is right around the corner.”
Once they are back at the tower, Tony raises Steve to his face and asks, “Are you ok, aside from Harry Potter Lite™’s Turtilfication?”
The turn that was just a little bit too slow, the blast that hadn’t quite been centered, and the odd radio silence: Steve didn’t like it. Then Iron Man took a hit and his movements went from awkward to downright erratic. The armor slammed into the ground.
Steve decides to just go for it while Tony’s mouth is full, if only to stave off the inevitable rejection for a few seconds.
"...and I fixed those problems you reported with the webshooters," Tony rambled. "Gave them increased functionality too. Now you can..."
He shook his head and turned into the garage where Tony was waiting. He couldn't deny that the building looked odd, but his new home was already growing on him.
Not just any smile, it was that one smile that made Tony melt, no matter what. Tony thanked the multiverse that Steve didn’t know and couldn’t use it against him, because damn was that smile was dangerous, especially to a man with a heart condition. It was like every inch of Steve lit up and came alive, looking so inherently kissable that Tony had to stop himself from burying his hands in Steve’s hair and having his way with him.
After judging that the burn had been under the cold water long enough, Jarvis let Tony remove his hand from the sink and started applying medicine. It undoubtedly stung, but Tony put on his brave face and bore it without complaint, something Jarvis saw more and more as the boy grew.
After a few minutes and some computer wizardry, Tony said, “Okay, I’ve gotta take this data to the lab and start cracking that encryption.”
“Please just let me save your life,” Steve mumbled into the back of Tony’s head, wrapping his arms tightly around Tony’s middle. “Just stay like this until the others get back and tell us the spell is broken.”
After all his joking about Steve’s age, Tony is miffed to say the least that he was the one that was turned into a dinosaur. He supposes it was his fault; after all he jumped in front of the spell meant for Steve. If he’d just left him to his fate, Steve would finally look his age and Tony wouldn’t be waddling around in feathers for the next 24 hours.
Steve waited until the nurses had their way with Tony, checking him over and making sure he had something to eat and drink. “Why would you hide this from me? Are you trying to get yourself killed?”
Tony sniffled into Jarvis’ finely pressed suit and Jarvis gently rubbed his back, not minding the way the tears and snot soaked into the fabric. One of Tony’s hands was clutched to his chest, but the other was grasping Jarvis with all the strength those tiny fingers had.
“Literally no one in this place would survive without coffee, so what do you think?” Tony said before he took a huge gulp from his cup.
The bookstore overflowed with books, with the tall shelves stacked high above even Steve’s head. He roamed the aisles looking for the correct section and found it fairly quickly. He paged through several books with big glossy pictures before settling on a colorful tome titled:
“Bruce is on the phone with Dr. Cho, they think they can treat the symptoms, but they can’t formulate a real cure for those people without knowing what was put into them in the first place,” Tony said, his voice sounding slightly tinny.
Then there was the mission he didn’t come back from, not for 70 years at least. Stepping out into that strange and oversaturated future, he’d never been more glad he didn’t have a soulmate. Then he caught sight of it, as a SHIELD agent ushered him into one of their black cars. In the mirror on the car door, there was a glint of red and gold beside Steve.
Tony gasped awake. Sweat poured off of him, as he peeled back his ratty blanket and levered himself off the oil stained couch. The memory of the dream was sharp in his mind even as everything around him was lost in a haze.
"Thanks," Steve replied, and oh, shit. There was the smile, the one that made Tony feel like he was on fire in the best way possible. It never failed to melt Tony's cold iron heart.
On his way back to the tower Steve stopped by the gardening supply store. He grabbed everything he thought he might need, a watering can, gloves, liquid fertilizer, and after a bit of deliberation he added a decent-sized planter and potting soil to his purchases. It was more expensive, but the red and gold glaze reminded him of Tony’s armor.
Tony rolled his eyes. Even he knew better than to try to contradict what his makeup artist said needed to be done. Cameras were unforgiving, even for people as perfect as Steve.
“No, you’re not. The spell is killing you.” Steve clenched his fists. The spell had been meant for him, not Tony.
Good, that probably meant it wasn't that bad. Tony only complained about minor injuries, when he didn't mind getting attention. Unlike when he was seriously hurt and just wanted to be left alone.
Strange’s silence told Tony all he needed to know and he wasn’t impressed. What kind of hero got taken out by his own wardrobe? (The armor didn’t count and only left a few bruises anyway.)
“I’m gonna pretend that didn’t happen,” Tony says with a frown. “Now, let’s see if we can’t make this place a bit more turtle friendly.”
“No, say no more. I get it, you feel bad. Well, I forgive you,” Ant fellow interrupted, scooping Tony into a hug.
"Tony, we have satellites that can find us and people who know approximately where we went. We’re not going to be stuck out here. You know this, so what’s really bothering you?”
Steve barely felt the kiss of the cold air before Tony slipped into the blanket cocoon beside Steve. He was so warm, better than a fire. Steve curled into him a bit more and soon he was warmer than he could ever remember being.
“I figured it’d stir up bad memories.” Tony shrugged and continued walking down the corridor. Surprisingly, or maybe not, Bucky came up and walked alongside Tony.
Steve never saw anyone in the mirror with him. He wasn’t surprised, most people didn’t. Still, he thought of the possibility wistfully, trying to picture his perfect match, his soulmate. Nothing came of it of course. It was probably better that way, between his wallet and his health he wasn’t exactly a catch. But what he got up to in the privacy of his own head never hurt anyone, right?
The streets were slick with ice and slush. Steve walked carefully through them, his hands tucked in his coat pockets, remembering. It was cold in a half-baked way, like winter’s fingers had come to grasp the city, but were held at bay by the billowing clouds of steam rising off of it. Steve wasn’t sure if it had been colder back in his day, or if his body had been less resistant to it, too thin to maintain a warm core with only a shabby coat. Or maybe he knew real cold now, bone-deep and all consuming. He wasn’t sure.
During the conversation the distance between them had shrunk. Tony hadn’t even noticed Hazel moving along the bed, but now that he really looked, he could see that there was only the scant distance between the bed and the chair separating them. If Tony wanted he could reach out and touch him. He really wanted to.
Steve Rogers lived out in the middle of nowhere, Vermont. There were trees in the distance that seemed to stretch on for miles. Tall, proud, maple trees, birch and beech trees, blanketed the hills that surrounded the property on all sides. It was summer now, and the world was a bright clean green around them. But Tony knew that come fall the hills would erupt into fiery reds, yellows, and oranges. It would truly be a sight to behold, so much different the the coastal vistas of Malibu that he was used to. The rolling hills around them leveled out into lush green fields that waved in the soft summer breeze. Ahead of him stood a two story log cabin, surprisingly bigger than most, complete with a wrap around front porch and several white painted rocking chairs clustered to one side. The cabin looked new, the wood still raw, the garden and lawn unadorned with flowers or ornamental shrubs of any kind,  as if Steven Rodgers had just moved in.
Tony had jerked his head away to stare at the ground instead, a soft blush suffusing his cheeks. What was wrong with him? He took a deep breath to calm his stupid heart as Natasha sidled up to him and nudged him gently with her elbow, her gaze still on the steady progress Steve was making on his return trip down.
Tony elbowed him sharply in the ribs. Just because it looked like Nat was passed out didn't actually mean that was the case.
“Oh, Tony.” She sighed, her arms wrapping around his shoulders and pulling him close. He could feel the slight shake in her shoulders.
“So here’s the thing.” Tony glanced over his shoulder as they stepped out of the barn and into the fading light of day, seeing that none other than Steve Rogers himself had stepped out onto the porch now and was in what seemed to be a quiet, heated, discussion with Clint and Bucky. “Nows really not a good time to, uh, meet the family if you know what I mean.”
“Look guys,” Tony started, standing stock still, and suddenly feeling every single scrape and bruise from his fall down the mountain  “I’m not going to lie to you. I’ve had an awful day, I’m in a lot of pain already. Let’s just call it a truce for now, okay? Just let me go, and I’ll make sure there’s some corn in for you. No? Strawberries? Lettuce? Bread?”
“Sorry about the waste, with the oranges I mean,” Tony stammered nervously, bottom lip jutting out just the tiniest bit, “I made an extra big batch because I figured you could have some tomorrow too.”
Tony sat back in the comfy dining room chair, legs crossed and hands folded in his lap, fingers twitching towards sunglasses he didn't have in a phantom attempt to cover his eyes so that the alpha sitting across from him wouldn't be able to see it whenever he rolled them. As it was, Tony had to keep a tight rein on his emotions and physical reactions, lest he give away more than he wanted to.  All the negotiating had already been taken care of prior to the bite and signing of the paperwork. Tony understood what was expected of him, just as he understood that this was just another way of Rogers rubbing his nose in his new position. See? Rogers’ eyes seemed to shine at him from across the large oak dining table, I’m in charge now and I can make your life miserable.
He could feel his pulse thundering in his throat. How many press conferences, media junkets, interviews, and speeches had he been to or given? He had delivered speeches to a stadium full of people before but nothing came close to the tight feeling in his guts. It startled him to realize that he was actually nervous to officially meet his new pack. For so long he had been alone. A pack of one with no one to answer to or worry about.
Surprise flickered across the smaller man’s face. “Ah this? It’s fine, just fine. Do you want water? I made orange juice. Think you might need a new blender though.”
Steve turned to stare at him, his blue eyed glare like a punch to the gut with the barely concealed disdain burning there.
“Hey now,” Steve’s voice cut in before Tony could respond. “Tony is still learning. He’s come a long way. I think it’s a little rude to insult a friend's cooking in their own home, don’t you?”
Tony gritted his teeth through the pain. “I’m sorry,” he groaned, his breath short. Steve paused, mid stride, at Tony’s pained groan. Slowly, carefully, he lifted Tony off his shoulder and set him on the ground in front of him, his gaze assessing.
Stepping on to the bath mat and out of the shower two things became immediately clear. His instincts were correct. Someone had been in the room with him not too long ago. They were gone now, and so were his clothes. A quick peek into the bathroom closet confirmed that all the towels were gone too. Tony stood, dripping wet, on a damp bath mat and stared at the towel that had been left for him. It was one that he had never seen before but it didn't take a genius like himself to figure out what was going on here.
“Okay and my ribs a little bit. But it’s not going to stop me from doing my chores, so don't worry about that. It’s
The contract had been signed on that first day. Tony had brought it himself, shame and embarrassment an oily coating inside of his guts, as he stood before Rogers with his fisted hands buried in his pockets. Rogers himself looked nonplussed. A man on top of the world, although a man who was currently faced with a task he found most unpleasant.
Tony didn't even have the chance to smile before a strong arm wrapped around his waist, a much larger body tackling him to the ground. They turned at the last second so that Tony landed on a broad chest instead of the hard packed earth. Having the upper hand lasted only for a moment. A heartbeat later found him rolled flat on his back, pinned to the ground under a much larger and stronger Steve Rogers. Breathless and laughing, Tony stared up into a mock solemn Steve Rogers red glittery face.
“What did I tell you about being quiet?” Steve growled. Tony visibly shrank. Bruce was shaking his head.
Steven Rogers stopped and regarded him fully. Tony could feel his spine trying to melt beneath the stare, not that he would ever let it show. As he had all of his life when faced with the penetrating stare of an Alpha, Tony faked it until he made it. His chin lifted and he met Steve’s eyes boldly. It was hard to reconcile this man standing before him with the scrawny kid that he used to bully in high school.
Tony was learning to relax in the other man’s presence. He was learning that Steve was not his father, and although not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, he wasn't a terrible Alpha. And maybe, just maybe, he would become someone that Tony could lean on.
It had never occurred to him before, honestly. Why would it? Steve would never do something so despicable. So horrible. Force someone to...A frown marred his brow, his lips twisting. He wished it hadn't ever occurred to him.
He was placed on the couch while Bruce and Natasha piled pillows for his ankle to rest on. Steve sat next to him, forcing Tony to lean against the Alpha, while Bruce put the peas in a towel and placed it on his ankle. Bucky and Clint were arguing over what to watch, while Natasha sat at the far end of the couch and rolled her eyes. The guys finally settled upon Star Wars revenge of the sith. Pizza was ordered, popcorn was shared, and Tony fell asleep to the sound of Chancellor Palpatine commanding the clone troopers to execute order 66.
Plus there was the fact that Tony had come out as an Omega to the media. He was now the conservative Rogers’ Omega, one who the Alpha-ruled world unanimously agreed that needed to be put in his place. It started on day one. Tony fought the blush that wanted to rise to his cheeks at the memory of how Rodgers had made him kneel before him while he read the contract.
Like a light switch being flipped back on Tony turned his gaze toward the intimidating figure of Captain Steven Rogers. He was dressed in khaki pants (because of course he was) and a tight cotton t-shirt the color of gunmetal gray. He had one shoulder planted against the support beam of the porch, strong arms crossed over his broad chest, and of course that disapproving frown that Tony was growing increasingly familiar with was folded across his tightly sealed lips.
The skin at the nape of Tony’s neck prickled. He turned away to hide the confusion that was doubtlessly written across his face.
The dynamic in the house changed drastically. The Avengers breathed life into the cabin, their squabbles and jokes ringing through the air like a tolling bell.  There was constantly someone around whenever he walked into a room. The packhouse only quieted down late at night, after everyone had gone back to their respective homes. Sometimes there were sleepovers, but not often. Clint, perhaps, spent the least amount of time at the packhouse, as he had a family that lived about a mile up the road.
Was he supposed to feel grateful? Tony gave Steve a tight smile. “Thanks,” he said as he walked toward the door.
It really hadn't taken long for Tony to make his dislike of Steven known. Being shoulder checked in the hallway, shoved into lockers, his books slapped out of his hands, his locker and all the belongings inside of it defaced… these were just small things Tony had done to him as a freshman
“Okay. This is crazy, you know that right? This is -” Rhodey turned and gave Steve a wide smile, his transition smooth.
He sighed, watching the sun begin its descent in the sky. He had spent too much time out here in the woods, and if he didn't put some pep in his step then he was going to be late for dinner. Shoving down the irritation that was simmering in his chest he started back down the mountain before remembering about those damned menacing chickens. He had seen them on his way up into the forest, they seemed to migrate from the back field to the edge of the main trail that led up into the mountains, and he had only just narrowly avoided a confrontation with the little monsters on his way up. Now he was going to have to go the long way around to avoid being pecked bloody. Fool me once, and all that.
“Wait… so, this entire time - for over a month - we’ve been eating terrible meals… because Steve insulted you? And we got punished too?”
It was kind of lonely living in a house full of people who you couldn't talk to. Or, to be fair, didn't want to. And so instead of wandering aimlessly around the house, or sitting in his cramped little room - where he kinda felt like Harry Potter living in the cupboard, Tony walked and tried to avoid the thoughts and worries that crowded his mind by thinking of equations, algorithms, probabilities. Being lonely wasn't a problem for Tony. He was quite used to it. What he wasn't used to was not having anything to do. No problems to solve at SI, no workshop to get lost in, no Pepper to bicker with. He couldn't drink his problems away, there wasn't a drop of liquor in the packhouse because, trust him, he had checked. He couldn't bury his problems in booze and companionship and bad decisions. Though now that he thought of it, it wouldn’t be that hard to make his own moonshine. Most of the things were already here, on hand. He’d just have to find a place to hide it. Maybe the old barn at the edge of the pack house property? It had been a part of the original property. The old house had been torn down to make way for the new packhouse, but they had kept the barn.
“...with his mouth.” Steve was furious. Angry. And immediately felt like the world's biggest piece of garbage after those crude words left his lips. They weren't true either. Any Alpha worth his salt would be disgusted by what Steve had just said.  What was happening to him? He felt out of control, volatile. He was mad that he had tied himself to this Omega, of all Omegas. He was mad that he had his childhood enemy living under his roof and like-it-or-not, was now responsible for his health and well being. He was angry that he couldn't be a better person and let the past go, let go of his anger towards the svelte man kneeling before him. Prostrating himself in apology and supplication. Humiliating himself so that Steve wouldn't… what? Kick him out? Change his mind? That wasn't going to happen. The bite was on Tony’s shoulder, the contract was signed. Steve was a man of his word. But maybe Tony didn't know that. Tony didn't know much about Steve, or what to expect.
He didn't know why, but for some reason his brain faltered, like a train stuck on the tracks. Pistons pumping, wheels cranking, but going nowhere. Out here in the middle of nowhere. This was a homestead. A home. Unfamiliar and foreign on every single level to Tony. There was no place for him here. He wasn't the homesteading type. He didn't know how to be a pack member, let alone an Omega of the pack. He had spent too long living alone, going his own way and barely seeing to his own needs. Pretending to be an Alpha. And now? Now he would need to pretend to be an Omega. But how could he do that?  What would be expected of him now? Cold seized his lungs, sending shards of ice to stab through his chest. Tony could feel his shoulders begin to shake even as his world narrowed. Was this cold feet? If it was, it was a little too late for it. The contract had been signed, he had a perfect impression of the very-fucking-painful bite of Steven Rogers’ teeth buried into his shoulder. He was walking into an unfamiliar place with people who would most likely hate him on sight. Hell, he didn't even know if there was a place for him here. Would he spend the rest of his days as an unwanted guest? Perhaps Steve would shut him away, locked in a tower like an old spinster. Oh don’t mind the howling kids, that’s only Tony the pack Omega, only good for his money.
Rhodey came over and wrapped an arm around his shoulders, giving him one of his infamous bro hugs. Tony grunted and staggered beneath the weight of his oldest friend. “You know,” Rhodes slurred “I like what you’ve got here. These are good people for you, Tones. A little nosey but…” Rhodey shrugged. “Can’t really blame them. I think you should start
Tony gritted his teeth. His heart squeezing painfully. Once a month? That was all the time he was allowed? He nodded his head, his face calm and accepting despite his inner turmoil.
There was no other word for it. Spine straight, plump lips tilted into a smirk, the little shit strode into the shock silent room swinging his hips and wearing nothing but a towel.
“Good. I was worried about your vision. Maybe you were legally blind or something. Who am I to judge?”
“Alright guys, I think it’s time we launch the Gold rocket. What do you think?” Tony stage whispered to his little cohorts in crime clustered around him while their parents and the rest of the pack watched from a distance.
Tony had managed to procure an appointment for the end of the next week. Considering that Dr. Rothstein usually was booked out months in advance and Tony had missed his last appointment; it was indeed a stroke of luck. That or being rich had its benefits. Take your pick. Tony certainly wasn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth...well, at least not when it came to this.
“For goodness sake, Tony. No one expects you to cook dinner tonight. Just...stop talking. And don’t move. Everything you say just… makes me mad.”
Ooof, that Chapter hit me right in the feels. Hope you guys don't hate me for it! I'd also like to reiterate that editing and grammar isnt really a thing I excel at so... please forgive me, I know not what I do.
Getting to his feet slowly, Tony groaned again. His ankle was a hot throbbing mess. Likely a minor sprain, which would make hiking back down the hill even more difficult.
Tony’s eyes rounded in shock. “Thanks for the offer, it's no problem to sleep in the old room - really I don't mind.”
Steve sighed. “Yeah, of course you can go.” Tony snorted. As if Steve had not stopped him from leaving earlier. The man was full of contradictions. He didnt bother to point that out. Tony shot up from his chair. He didn't care that he looked like a wounded thing, tail tucked between his legs as he walked quickly from the room and up the stairs to his small bedroom at the back of the house.
“You let me put that In. My. Mouth.” Rhodey growled. Tony pushed off from the wall he had been leaning against.
Shaking his head, Steve led them out of the war room and toward the staircase that lead upstairs. Jaw tight, Steve led him up the stairs that overlooked the living room - explaining that there was also an indoor gym in the basement, but he would need permission to enter. There was a long stretch of hallway. Steve’s bedroom was on one end, and there were two more guest bedrooms that were, unsurprisingly, off limits. Tony let out a sigh.
Tony swallowed thickly, knowing that he looked like a deer in headlights. But when Captain fucking America held you upright on your tiptoes to glower down at you - well, somethings you just couldnt hide.
Steve sighed, fingers tunneling through his short honeyed locks, before turning to regard Tony with those piercing blue eyes.
“Shove it, Rogers!” Tony shouted back, from the top of the landing. He froze, trepidation in the line of his shoulders, a cagey wariness in his gaze as he turned down to look at a smirking Steven Rogers.
Wow! As usual I am blown away by all of your kudos and reviews! I can't begin to tell you how much they mean to me :) I wasnt going to update until Monday but I had this chapter mostly written and ready to go anyway so... THANK YOU!
Tony turned away from the door, and wrapped his arms around himself in a comforting gesture, as he padded over toward his bed. Toeing his shoes off, Tony collapsed onto the thin mattress with the scratchy thin sheets. He was so god damned tired. Closing his eyes he turned onto his back, forcing his thoughts away from everything that had occurred down stairs. He wouldn't think about anything. He wouldn't.
The blush he had been fighting back resurfaced moments later when a broadly grinning Steve had thrust the dilapidated rocket toward Tony, his blue eyes twinkling with good humor. Tony swallowed hard, despite himself, and gingerly took the rocket from Steve.
An alpha thing huh? Tony mentally scoffed. Every Alpha he had ever known had never been interested in taking care of him. But maybe Rogers was different. Who knew?
Before Tony could answer or deflect, and he most definitely would have deflected, Steve’s hands were on him. Tony startled at the touch, the warm heat of Steve’s coarse palms running up his arms and down his back with a firm measured pressure. When his thumbs grazed his ribs, Tony sucked in a pained breath. Blue eyes flickered up to meet his, the concern there evident.
“I swear I will be on my best behavior. If I do anything to cause you embarrassment you can revoke my privileges.”
Steve exploded out of his chair, muscles taut, hands clenched into fists. Tony stood up too, as if ready to face the challenge of an enraged Alpha.
Well, Steve had never claimed to be perfect. Anger was still coursing through his veins, his hands were still clenched into fists at his sides. There was nothing more he would like to do than to thrash the hell out of Stark. But he wouldn't. He couldn't. Not when he was abasing himself like this. Asking for forgiveness for a fight that Steve had started. He needed to apologize
“Yeah, Tony. Hey, listen. About all that stuff. I mean, you can go outside or around the property whenever you want. There are some hiking trails too if you want to stick to the paths. Just make sure you’re home in time for meals and your responsibilities are all taken care of. And don’t leave the property. We have a lot of land here, so that would be pretty hard to do. But you’re welcome to explore it whenever you’d like.”
Tony ducked his head, not fighting his instincts this time as he bared his neck. Everything he was doing was wrong. He sucked at this. Steve was going to revoke privileges. He wasn't going to be able to go to the city and he only had another week left...
“You have 24 hours, and then I expect you to be on your way Stark.” He threw over his shoulder before disappearing from sight.
“Let’s get you back to the packhouse and have Bruce take a look at you.” Steve murmured. “Do you want me to carry you, or do you want to walk?”
Shaking his head, Steve made his way into the dining room where a plate of slightly charred (how does one burn scrambled eggs?) and chunky scrambled eggs sat waiting for him. He took a bite, groaned, and discretely spit it back out. Rubbery. And was that a cube of raw carrot in there? He took a sip of the coffee to wash out the taste of burnt egg and nearly gagged at the bitter taste and coffee grounds.
“Here’s the upstairs guest bathroom, you can use this one.”  Tony stuck his head in briefly, taking in the sparse bathroom. White tile, standing shower, toilet, and sink. The basics. He nodded before following Steve to the last door at the end of the hall.
Tony made several calls that afternoon in the barn. By the time he came out his shoulders felt lighter, his hobbling steps had an extra skip to it, and the tightness around his eyes had eased. He felt something that was approximately close to happy, and he could hardly believe it. For a moment he imagined a life here, as part of the Avengers pack, and what that would entail. What that would
.” There was an almost pleading lilt to Tony’s voice, “I can, I can still cook and clean, and I - look it's not gonna stop me from pulling my weight around here. I might just do it a little slower, is all.  And I can..next time I’ll let you know if I go hiking…” Tony  choked off as every one of his words just made Steve’s eyes narrow and jaw clench tighter and tighter. He had the distinctive feeling he was digging his own grave.
“Come on platypus, it's time to get you up to bed, you’re starting to get sappy and you know how I feel about that.”
“My apologies Captain. Tony is an excellent cook… but one of you folks must have really pissed him off for him to make a dish like that.”
Peggy moved away and not long after Stark was expelled. He had not cropped up until years later when he began working beneath his dad at Stark Industries. They said he was smart, graduated from MIT, but Steve doubted Stark even graduated high school. Those degrees had all been bought by Daddy dearest, always covering up for his less than stellar son.
And dammit, Rogers… well, he had tortured that kid in high school. God how he had hated him. So if Rogers wanted to get back at him a little bit, rough him up - humiliate him… who was he to complain really? The legislative process could be pretty slow, but times they were a-changin’ and he wouldn't be forced to be here too much longer. For two years he had made Rogers’ life a living hell. Purposefully. Deliberately.  Seemed only fair that Rogers got the chance to do the same.
“Are you sure you can’t stay for dinner, Colonel?” Natasha asked with a saccharine smile that did not, for one second, fool Tony. That she-witch was up to something.
That night he lay away, staring up unseeingly at the wooden beams of the ceiling and kicking himself for turning Steve down.
Steve came in through the front door, sweat beading across his forehead, clinging sticky to his shirt on his back and chest. Every morning before the sun rose he went out for a run. There was something infinitely peaceful about running through the countryside, the coarse dirt road slapping beneath the relentless tred of his sneakers, the quiet stillness in the air heavy as the rest of the world slumbered on . He took a deep breath, still slightly winded from his 10 mile run, and made his way into the kitchen. Immediately his nose wrinkled as the smell of...burning? … filled the air. His eyes watered and he resisted the urge to sneeze as he rounded the corner and saw the slight figure of none other than Tony scurrying across the kitchen with a smoking pan in one hand. Steve watched in a sort of horrified fascination as Stark threw the pan into a sink full of water, yelping as it hissed and spit.
you, Stark. I don’t hold with that sort of thing. And I’m not going to ask you...ask you for favors that you aren't willing to give. I would never do that.”
“You do know how to cook, don’t you Stark?” The derision in Steve’s voice sent his hackles up. Before Tony could say anything, Steve shook his head in a dismissive manner.
The color leached from Tony’s cheeks. “R-right.” Awkwardly his hands began to tremble. Which was stupid. Steve wasn’t going to hurt him or anything. He
“Permission to go to my room, Alpha?” More like permission to get the fuck away from you and your lies?
All of his options were terrible. Tony went home after that ultimatum and straight into the bowels of his lab. He looked at the familiar and worn tables with the clutter of old coffee mugs. The scatter of papers and reference books that contained FIRST DRAFTS of potential projects. With a heavy heart Tony did what had to be done to years of his life. His work. His purpose.
“Yeah, well, I guess I’ll let you get settled in then.” Rogers said briskly. “I’d like to talk to you in a bit about some household expectations. Go over things again.”
Chuckling, Tony led his super tipsy friend upstairs to his room. He pushed James onto the bed, the colonel flopping backwards and spread eagle, groaning slightly before falling promptly asleep. James didn’t drink much and he absolutely did not stand a chance against Romanoff and Barton. Not to mention the two super soldiers that processed alcohol at an accelerated rate. He doubted either of them were tipsy let alone drunk despite the amount of moonshine that had been consumed.
“Where are your felicitations? Those better be happy tears. It’s my wedding day.” This wasn't a happy occasion and both of them knew it. Pepper chuckled without humor, pulling back to look into his eyes.
talking about Rhodey bear. He was, of course, talking about his brain child. “I don’t want to say impossible but-”
Steve nodded before walking away, his jaw tight and his steps measured. When Tony could hear his new Alpha walking down the stairs then, and only then, did he allow his head to fall into his cupped hands.
They would be leaving Tony behind in a few days for some routine training missions, ordered by Director Fury. Steve didn't want to leave the vulnerable omega behind… perhaps Laura and the kids could come by and check on him while they were gone. Did Tony like kids?
Tony slammed the front door shut, ankles bleeding, and breathing heavy. He kicked off his shoes, face smeared with dirt, and made his way towards Rogers who was partially reclined on the sofa, a sketch pad in one hand and a piece of charcoal in the other.
He had spent an afternoon exploring nature, not dwelling on the more recent happenings of his life, and instead allowing his brain to overrun with concepts, upgrades, and formulas. His fingers itched for a computer screen, tablet, keyboard. Rogers had been adamant that he avoid any such pursuits.
Tony clenched his jaw, back molars grinding together in attempt to stop the groan of frustration that wanted to escape. It was like he was back to living with dear old Dad again, from the stern disapproval and creased brow to the dictator like list of what his daily schedule was going to be. At least there weren't those damn Omega decorum classes, which had been inflicted on Tony throughout his teenage years. So much bowing and scraping. Was your Alpha angry? This is what you need to do to soothe that hot temper. Has he withdrawn from the mating? Here’s how to spark his interest again. Gentle manipulation was what young Tony Stark had been taught. Ways to guide and shape events into a desired outcome. Speaking out and speaking up, of course, was never an option.
Basically, Tony was supposed to act like a 1950s Omega. Be seen but not heard, and keep the pack house spotless. Tony knew that Rogers was conservative… but even to him this felt a bit extreme. Of course, the Captain was probably relishing being the one to put Tony in his place. Tony had been a junior in high school when he first caught wind of the freshman who was making a name for himself. Thinking back on those times Tony mentally winced. He had outright bullied Steven Rogers as a kid. He had bullied a lot of different people back then, for a lot of different reasons, but Rodgers had been personal…
“Look, I’m sorry. I lost track of the time, I had an accident. I was on my way back, it won't happen again.”
Steve chuckled softly, his head dipping down so that their faces were mere inches from each other. “You think my eyes are beautiful, huh?”
At the end of the night Hulk was passed out on the couch, Nat tucked beneath his arm. Steve had left to help a stumbling drunk Clint make it back home, and Bucky had disappeared into his room to sleep.
And then Steve was handing him his medicine, grabbing a bag of frozen peas, and then scooping Tony up
Tony found freedom in his lab that he lacked everywhere else in the world. The freedom to simply be himself, his music blaring and new inventions coming to life beneath his fingers. Everything had been going swimmingly, if he did say so himself, until his old mentor and God father had  tried to murder him and in the process put his tech, his weapons, into the hands of enemies. American soldiers being gunned down by black market Stark Industries weapons. Innocent lives lost and towns destroyed. No matter which way you sliced it, Tony was at fault. It was his weapons that had taken the lives of countless innocents. His name emblazoned on the side of those weapons that were killing the American Soldiers they were supposed to protect. He had been too wild, too carefree, too sure in how own genius and by far too trusting. He should have known better.
“Mm yeah, super huge fan.” Tony rolled his eyes “Okay here we go,” Tony grunted as he staggered up the stairs with Rhodey, trying his best to keep them both from breaking their necks. There were a couple of close calls but after a good five minutes they finally made it up okay.
Bruce left the room. Tony sensed he didn't go too far. Like the others, they were probably waiting in the living room or the war room. Unease drifted up Tony’s spine. Were they giving Steve privacy? And why?
Steve didn't bother to point out that orange juice was usually made by hand or with a juicer, not a blender. He eyed the orange rind speckled piece of machinery sitting next to the sink and again had to hold back a smile. Tony was awful at cooking, clueless really, but he was being so earnest that it was… well, almost endearing. Almost.
Minutes ticked by in absolute quiet. Tony could scarcely hear anything over the pounding of his own heart. What if this didn't work? What if the Captain walked away regardless of this display of submission? Despite everything?  A true moment of panic struck Tony then, making it hard to breathe past the sudden lump in his throat. There were so many people who were counting on him. And here he was, despite his best efforts, failing again like he always did. Why was he like this? Why did absolutely everything he touched turn to such sh-
As always I apologize for spelling errors and grammar. I went through it a few times and fixed what I could but I'm sure it's still riddled with errors.

Hoping you and yours stay healthy during this pandemic. <3
that. He did. And still his stomach was tight with nerves and his fingers trembled as they worked the snap of his jeans. Tony jerked as Steve’s calloused hands brushed his away. He made quick work of shucking a wobbly Tony out of his stained and worn clothes. He was left sitting in a stool in his black boxer briefs, cheeks flushed, as he looked anywhere but at Steve who was still kneeling on the ground at his feet. Steve made quick work of his ankle. Wrapping it up with a practiced ease as if he had done it many times before. He got up, and Tony let out a sigh of relief, his shoulders sagging, only to groan as Steve returned with yet another damp dish cloth. When he began to quietly but firmly stroke down his arms and chest Tony squeaked in indignation, swatting Steve’s hands away.
“This is why we can’t have nice things, you idiot.” Nat muttered, turning on a trim heel and heading toward home.
“Listen. I’m not… I’ve never had an Omega before. I mean, around. In the house or… I’m just not used to this. To you.” Steve stuttered. Normally Tony would find that amusing, a man known for his inspiring speeches stuttering through whatever the hell this was, but all he wanted right now was to get the fuck out of this room. As far from what had just transpired as humanly possible.
He closed the door to his room, forehead pressed against the wood and took gulping breaths to try to calm his racing heart. He should have known this was going to be difficult. Nothing in his life had ever been easy, had it? These mind games Rogers was playing…
After his second cup, Tony turned back to the fridge. Captain America wanted breakfast? Well, that was what he was going to get.
Aside from a few toiletries, there was no point in bringing anything else. He knew Rodgers would most likely confiscate it. ‘Less is more’ Tony scoffed mentally, throwing his duffel over his shoulder and approaching the town car waiting outside of his home in New York.
Rogers hesitated a moment, hand on the knob and shoulders stiff as if he was debating with himself. Tony shifted nervously behind him. He was really hoping that Rogers wasn't rethinking that whole attic situation. Tony had to remember that he was at this man’s mercy. And although from all accounts Rogers was a stand up Alpha and an all around good guy… well, their past was an ugly one. If the man wanted to throw him in a padded room in the basement and throw away the key he had the right to do so.
The next few days passed uneventfully. Tony woke up, made breakfast (terribly) did his chores around the cabin and spent the remainder of his day avoiding Steve until meal times, in which they both sat down and tried to eat (tried being the operative word there, twice they had to order takeout instead) Tony’s culinary creations. Steve, for his part, seemed keen to avoid him too… as if they were both tiptoeing around the big elephant in the room. It was on the fourth day of their little routine, after breakfast, that Tony approached Steve.
Rhodey had teased him mercilessly in college about his need for coffee, had even gotten him a mug as big as his head that read “No talkie before coffee”. It had been nice, Tony mused fondly, to have a friend. One who saw and knew his true self. Being a 13 year old on a college campus had been...awkward and alienating. Luckily he had made a friend in Rhodey, and the old Sourpatch hadn't been able to shake him since. Tony scratched the stubble on his jaw. Colonel Rhodes was not going to be happy when he got back from deployment and found out about Tony’s mating to Steve. He was out of the country  on a top secret mission. Blah blah blah. Something about a terrorist organization. Tony wasn’t worried for his friend, he was -after all-  rocking War Machine.
“Hey so, is it alright if I go outside for a little bit? Get some air? I’m starting to go a little stir crazy in here.” Tony rubbed the back of his neck, his stomach tight, as he waited for Steve’s response.
It would be about 20 minutes later that he would discover what Steve meant about aggressive wild life.
implied how Stark should make his apology. Chrissakes. Disgust soured his stomach. Disgust at himself. Stark had been about to, was about to… Jesus. It occurred to Steve, suddenly, how much control he had over Tony now. How much he could hurt Stark, the different ways he could…
Work that he had to keep his involvement in a complete secret. There were a few reasons, decided upon by both Howard and Obie years ago, but the fact of the matter was that Tony Stark was an Omega. Omegas, he had been told since the time he was knee high, had no business in weapons manufacturing. Nevermind that Tony was an absolute genius, whiz, and could even give Howard a run for his money at the age of 14. Pretty early on his path in life had been decided. To the world he would act the Alpha. His Omega orientation would be kept secret by conditioning and suppressants that would hide his scent and Omega urges. He was never to reveal his true nature to anyone, and any work he did on behalf of the company would be done in secret and under an alias lest his true orientation be discovered and his omega status ruin them all. Because Omegas simply did not build weapons. Who would trust a rocket launcher dreamt up by a soft hearted omega? It was bullshit. Omega rights had made great strides since Howard and Obie’s time, but they had both been stuck firmly in the past.
The press had a field day with that one. He had been raked over the coals. His every action when he had been CEO called into question. The merchant of death an Omega? Everywhere he turned his face was blasted across the media. The board of directors had been outraged. Even though it was the twenty-first century and Omega rights had come a long way from where they had once been, no one wanted an Omega in a position of power at a fortune 500 company. Omegas were supposed to be soft. They were teachers, nurses, artists, poets and creators. The only thing that Tony had created was death and destruction.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “I think you’ve been pretending to be someone for so long, you don’t know who you really are anymore. It’s one of those takes one to know one situations. So if you need to talk about anything, including Iron man, I’m all ears.”
“Hey buddy, we were worried about you. Glad Steve found you. Do you mind if we take off your shirt, I’d really like to check your ribs.”
“Nope.” Tony gently chucked his best friend on the chin. “Don’t worry about me Pep. I’m a Stark. We land on our feet.”
“Sure thing Rogers.” Tony said agreeably, flopping down onto the edge of his “bed”. “Say in,” he glanced down at his watch “an hour?”
“Get. Up. Now.” Steve bit out tersely. Tony had to swallow the lump of nerves that jangled like broken shards of glass in his throat. Had it worked? Smoothly he rolled to his feet, short strands of inky black hair still caught captive in Rogers' steely grip.
Steve’s smile grew broader, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he reached out a hand and mussed Tony's hair affectionately.
Tony froze as Steve leaned closer, their breaths mingling as one weighted moment bled into the next.
“Well, I’m going to take a shower and try to pretend this never happened. I just want to make it clear I know this was a set up.”
Steve took a fortifying breath. “I don't know what you've been through, or experienced in the past, but I’m not going to beat you Tony. I don't much care for bullies and…” Steve paused, his jaw tight. “I’m sorry I started that argument with you too. The things I said about Omegas… they weren't true and it wasn't fair of me.”
The next couple of days practically flew. There was much to be done, and many kinks to be worked out. Tony had to tie up loose ends, trusting in Pepper to finish whatever he couldn't get to in the span of 48 hours. He hired moving crews to pack up his homes in Malibu and New York, and sold  off the international villas and homesteads. He had a feeling with Captain America as his new mate there would be no need for lavish vacations. While he still had control of his accounts there were some things he had to take care of. Funds to be set up. Tony had to be very careful that those funds were no longer in his name and under his control. Off-shore accounts had to be opened and closed, money squirreled away for what Tony considered to be his most important charities.
“I suppose I'm going to have to go outside to find my clothes, yes? Somewhere up high? Ah, a tree, of course. I’d say clever but it’s a little cliche, don't you think?”
Tony shook his head. “Thanks for the help, boy wonder.” he muttered, “coulda used that super strength at any point to help me lug my pal up here. But no. Wouldn't want you to strain yourself.” Rhodey was going to have a massive hangover tomorrow. Hiding his smile Tony got to work on his friends boots and was startled when Steve joined him. Unlacing the boots and shucking them to the ground they studied Rhodes sleeping form.
Tony was jerked out of his dark thoughts by a brutal hand in his hair, craning his neck farther to the side. His startled eyes flew up to the hard face of Steven Rogers, cheeks tinged just-so-slightly pink with discomfort. Tony snorted mentally at that. It was his idea after all. Did he think Tony wasn't sincere? That he wouldn't abase himself in front of a room full of strangers. Public humiliation was a favorite past time of the young Tony Stark. He had six sex tapes to prove it. Not that he was counting. Nope. And he was still waiting for the seventh and eighth to drop. But again, not counting.
With that he pulled away, gave her a kiss on the cheek, and walked away. It was harder to do than he wanted to admit. He was leaving behind a life he knew, a life where he was in control of his own destiny, and putting himself into an old enemy’s hands.
“It’s just Stark, Steve. ‘Sides, that’s the least he deserves for all that stunts he pulled in high school. Can’t hide behind his Daddy’s name now.” Bucky muttered a lazy smirk curling on his lips, as his solemn and dark gaze turned toward the kitchen where Stark had disappeared to.
Tony snorted. She smiled, and it was one that held warmth and understanding.  “You know, SHIELD sent me to find out the identity of a mutual friend of ours. You might’ve met him. Bright red-”
Tony had ground his teeth together and asked for a tablet or laptop that did not have access to the internet. Something personal that he could just… use. For solitaire, e-reading, journaling or whatever.
“Hey there Spangles,” Tony gave a wink. “Nice place you got here. Got that ‘Cabin in the Woods’ vibe to it.” At Rogers’ blank stare, Tony continued. “You know, slasher film? Fine. Friday the 13th? Last house on the left?”
Natasha nodded, her lips curled. “We were able to get his name, this scientist of yours, but he disappeared off the grid. Could be that he found out we were on to him. Could be because he’s not real.”
“Cuz you’re a pretty great guy.” He hiccuped “And ya know… like only a handful of people know it. You’re special, Tony. You-“
Tony ran a dirty hand through his equally dirty hair, soft downy feathers jarred loose from the motion and drifted lazily to the floor.
like. Tony had only ever been a part of a very small pack, and his life under his father’s rule had been nothing short of terrible. Here… here with the avengers he felt almost a part of the team. They had certainly warmed up to him over the past couple of weeks. They even seemed to care about him, which was as surprising as it was refreshing.
Speaking of food, Tony eyed the fridge dubiously. It was his responsibility to make breakfast. His lips twerked upward in wry amusement as his gaze alighted on a small stack of cookbooks set out on the island. Cooking for Dummies. The Joy of Cooking. How to Cook Everything. The Flavor Bible. With a huff he turned his back to the stack of books and faced the coffee maker. Poured himself a cup and took that first glorious sip of coffee. He went from running a multi-billion dollar company, heading the R/D department, to being a glorified housekeep. He had left his work behind, all those unfinished formulas and prototypes, so that he could make Captain America breakfast and clean his tighty whities.
Hulk shrugged his giant shoulders. “Hulk smash,” his voice conversational and bland, before turning around and strutting back toward the cheering Alphas.
Confusion puckered his brow. “Well of course I...was I  supposed to peel them? I swear the recipe didn't call for that.” He turned, dripping water across the kitchen, water in the sink still running, as he grabbed the nearest cookbook.
Tony reached up, wrapped his hand lightly around her tapping fingertip and pulled it away from his chest.
Steve had given him an inscrutable look. “I’ll look into it for you. I don't have anything like that here, but maybe Bruce can come up with something. Or even the IT guys at SHIELD.”
Rhodey was strong armed into staying the night with the avengers. To say there were shenanigans was the understatement of the year. Clint and Rhodes found the moonshine that Tony had been brewing in the barn, Natasha ferreted out the vodka from her house, and the night turned into drunken debauchery and board games. They stuck to games like clue and uno because as it  turned out, Monopoly brought out the worst in everyone. The game had ended abruptly when Bruce had hulked out and “Hulk Smash!”ed the shit out of the board. That was, of course, after a steely eyed Nat had sent a couple of widow bites flying, pining Clint’s hand to the table and the other lodged into the chair between his parted legs after he had bought up park place out from under her.
“Thanks buddy, you’re a lifesaver. Literally.” Rhodey stumbled out of War machine, his dark umber skin flushed and covered with sweat.
“Some of the best meals I’ve ever had, to be honest. Your Dad had you trained by Michelin Star chefs, right?”
He flinched as the sound of his name echoed through the woods. He felt his heart stutter, and then he sighed. He had been gone too long...they were looking for him.
Clint looked up to see Steve pinching the bridge of his nose. “I appreciate what you guys are trying to do here, but if we could please not purposefully try to agitate my new Omega, that’d be swell.”
And that was how Tony found himself mated. The ceremony consisted of him, Rogers, Potts and an officiator. Tony was given a mating bite high up on his shoulder, near his neck. Their relationship was, of course, not consummated. Rogers could barely stand to be in the same room with Tony for more than 5 minutes at a time. The feeling was completely mutual.
The pack house was impressive. The ground floor consisted of a large family room with high, cathedral ceilings, complete with a couple of oversized plush sofas in beige and colorful blue and green pillows and a large screen TV and a gaming system set up that would make any gamer drool. The windows in this room were massive floor to ceiling monstrosities, framed by actual tree trunks. Tony couldn't help but run his fingers across the bark of the wood, impressed despite himself.  There was a pool table in the far corner and a dart board not too far from it that seemed to be well used. The interior wall of the living room was actually a vast stone fireplace that was made up of giant slabs of uneven, mismatched, stone and shared a wall with the kitchen.
Rhodey cocked his head to the side, gaze trailing from the group in the distance slowly back to Tony, “No, I don't think I do. Maybe you should use that big genius brain of yours and explain it to me.”
across the floor to Steve, his gaze lowered, movements almost feline in fluidity, and the line of his stubbled jaw tense. Slowly, Stark reached up towards Steve’s waist,  fingers brushing gently against his abdomen as they unknotched his belt with a skilled deftness that left Steve momentarily stunned. Steve didn't have time to react. It happened pretty quickly, and to be honest, he was floored that Stark. That Stark…
Tony clenched his jaw. He knew that Rogers could make him get on his knees and beg, and then simply walk away. It would be no less than he deserved, Tony acknowledged grudgingly. He hadn’t exactly been kind to the kid in highschool. In fact he had gone out of his way to make Rogers’ life a living hell. It wasn't something that he was proud of, but Tony couldn't change the past. Any apology he would make now would seem flat and false. Empty. So he wasn't going to waste his breath with that shit.
Steve glanced down at the slumbering Omega tucked next to him, his face lax with sleep. Soundlessly the team looked up and made eye contact with Steve. After everything they had been through together, the battles they had seen, they needed no words. Each and every one of them had been disgusted by the scars that littered Tony’s body. Evidence of the abuse he had sustained. Was it all from Afghanistan? Steve didn't know much about what had happened there, to be honest. He knew by Natasha’s pointed look that she was intent on finding out more than the barebones information they currently had. He knew that Tony had been kidnapped, that had certainly been all over the news, and had resurfaced months later in a suit made by a scientist named Yinsen that would become the framework for the Iron Man suit. What had Tony endured in those months of captivity? Was that what had put the wariness in his eyes, the flinching obedience? Had he ever received help or counseling?
“Tony! No! There was no “Bro Code” thing going on! Oh my gosh, Tony!” He dashed out of the dining room before he could acknowledge the laughing that the two left behind were doing at his expense.
“Tony,” Steve almost purred. “You said that you were the jealous type. Don’t avoid this topic. Do I have a reason to think you’d be jealous of me of all people...?” You could almost hear the smirk in his voice.
The man blushed (which, seriously? A man who looked to be in his thirties blushing at a nineteen year old? How innocent could this guy be?) and Tony smiled earnestly this time. A blush that red couldn’t possibly be faked.
He’d teased him when he learned his name was Steve Rogers (“an all American kind of man, huh?”), pretended to gasp in astonishment when Steve said he was 27 (“I could have sworn this old man was at least 30!”), pushed for more info on this Bucky friend of his (who hates their name so much that they’d choose THAT of all names as a nickname?), and listened whole heartedly to his stories of his mother Sarah (“she sounds like she was an amazing mother, Steve.”).
He sighed, and just about cried as he apologized to the cashier that he wouldn’t be able to purchase anything because he didn’t have his wallet. Just as he walked outside he heard someone calling out, “Hey!”
“Yeah, Peggy, I’m fine. Don’t worry about it,” he mumbled as he finally found his phone. He blinked his eyes a few times to clear them and squinted to look at the name.
Tony smiled at him, suddenly kind of shy as they stopped at the door to his dorm. “Umm... do you still wanna come up? I mean, it’s not gonna be for food but...uh, I mean, I think my roomate’s out right now, and...”
Getting to his room and closing the door, he sat on his bed and sighed once more. “Tony, there was no Bro Code, because honestly that’s one of the stupidest things I’ve ever had to learn about. I asked Peggy out, she told me I was sweet but she wasn’t attracted to me, and then Bucky admitted he’d had a thing for her but never said anything because he didn’t want me to get mad at him. I accepted that Peggy wasn’t attracted to me, so I tried hooking her up with Bucky. They hit it off really well, and I was happy for them. Peggy’s been hanging out a lot over here, but I don’t think they’ve really made it public yet.”
Lunch was nice. Steve took him to a burger joint (best burgers in town he’d said), and ordered him so much food that he’d have breakfast and dinner for the next day.
Steve almost choked on his coffee. “Wait, wait, Wait!” He cried out, almost flailing his arms mid cough. Bucky and Peggy looked alarmed at him. “What do you mean, sweet on her!?”
Looking back, an extremely tall, and quite attractive blonde held out a bag. Tony looked at it in confusion, then looked back up at the guy.
The blonde smiled at him. “Your company will be thank you enough, I promise.” Tony narrowed his eyes, skeptical, but accepted.
“Tony. I’d be happy to go to Prom with you, and not as just friends. I like you, a lot, and I think you like me too.”
“That’s very nice of you. If you’re really not expecting anything back, would you like to come over for a lunch of noodles and caffeine? I might be a bit young, but I promise I’m just offering a thank you.”
Steve heard a noise and blearily sat up. He flailed as he fell off the bed and groped around for whatever was making that god-awful sound.
Tony almost squawked on the other line. “I never said I was jealous! How did you get this ridiculous notion that I would be jealous about a girl you bring to prom! I’ve never said anything about any past instances or even ALLUDED to this notion! How dare you—“
“I, uh,” he coughed, and almost shoved the bag of food into Tony’s hands, who took it, shoulders shaking in silent laughter. “That’s very kind, but how about I take you out for lunch instead? I’m not a big fan of ramen noodles that much. Ate way too much growing up, and promised myself I’d avoid them at all means possible when I’d get older.”
“That’d defeat the purpose of a thank you though? You’d be doing twice for me, instead of me reciprocating.”
Bucky raised his brow and glanced at Peggy who was silently laughing so hard it looked like she might fall off her chair.
Tony couldn’t find it. WHY couldn’t he find it! He’d had literally just enough for some cheap ramen and strong coffee in his wallet, and now he had nothing. NOTHING! He couldn’t even afford the cheapest of the cheap, since he LOST HIS WALLET!!
The voice on the line was way to cheery for how few hours they’d slept. He kept the phone to his ear as he stumbled into the kitchen to see Bucky and Peggy cooking breakfast. She glanced over and motioned to a cup of coffee on the table for him. He almost threw himself down on the table, grabbed the cup and took a couple gulps as he listened.
Steve smiled as he blushed seemingly from head to toe, which made Tony want to see how far it really went. “How ‘bout we wait till date three?”
He told Steve so much, he was surprised at himself. He’d never talked this much in one sitting, even to Rhodey. He’d never trusted anyone this fast, always being wary about people who ask too many questions. But, there was something about Steve. He was different, and Tony couldn’t really even explain it. He trusted Steve, which almost always ended badly, but he Did, and it felt so nice. He just hoped that this man never gave him a reason to regret it.
He told him about how he didn’t have friends growing up because no one liked his smart ass attitude, and how Rhodey had been the only one that seemed to truly thrive off of it. He told him about his science buddy Bruce, how he was a self proclaimed mentor to Peter who was still in high school, stories about his mother teaching him the piano and Italian when he was younger (and before she started relying on pills and drinks to survive), how he’d given up on trying to make his father proud, and instead decided he wanted to build things to make the world a better place. He told Steve about Dum-E, who wasn’t very smart yet, but he was learning. He told him about how he was going to build a learning computer who’d be able to control almost anything you could think of at just a thought.
Steve started laughing and Tony immediately stopped talking. Peggy and Bucky put down plates of food, and she topped off his coffee and gave him his own plate.
Steve laughed. “No, Tony. There won’t be any maidens attacking you with torches and pitchforks. But I am curious about this statement you made about being jealous?”
Steve laughed so hard he almost fell off his chair. Bucky and Peggy just ignored him, talking amongst themselves.
“Yeah, well, I woke up. Few nightmares, blah blah, no big deal. Anyway, I had an idea and I needed to work on it, wanted to make one myself because all of the ones I found in the stores and online were just not the right look! So I called to check what color your tux was! I need to know so I can make sure that the flowers match, because I for sure am not gonna be the one wearing the corsage, and I know you probably only have one tux, so I’ll make sure that I wear matching colors for yours. I could totally have, like, 10 or 100 made for you but I know you wouldn’t like that, so I figured—“
Tony’s face flushed in shame. After almost his whole life of being used to having anything he could want whenever he wanted it, it seemed embarrassing to hear that he was eating a poor college lunch. But he squared his shoulders back, forced the flush down, hopefully the guy didn’t see it, and smiled politely.
The voice stopped immediately, and then Tony said, very slowly, “For the prom? I bought us tickets like months ago when they were selling them. You said you wanted to go so I said ok and then I got the tickets right after. Do you not remember this? Are you sick? Did you hit your head and have amnesia? You know, retrograde amnesia is a lot more common than people think. Do I need to take you to a doctor? Do—“
Bucky swiped at him with his fork, and when he wasn’t able to get Steve he went after Steve’s pancakes. Steve grabbed the plate away from his wandering fork, and laughed as Peggy filled Bucky’s plate again and she received a kiss on the cheek for thanks.
“Well, I mean, there’s no reason for you to think... I mean WHY would I be jealous when obviously you just think of me as a friend. I like to think of you as my best friend, but don’t you ever tell Rhodey that or he’ll kill both of us, and not in a nice way, we’re gonna probably wish we were dead to be honest, and I don’t think it’d be good PR—“
Tony’s smile dimmed as he understood. This man must not have had a lot when he was younger. He could understand, he’d never lived it, but he’d asked Rhodey all about being frugal. He’d had to learn tips when Howard had cut him off.
Steve walked him home after they were done. They’d been at the restaurant for so long they’d ended up being politely kicked out. Steve had left quite a generous tip though, so at least the waiter hadn’t had a table just taking up space.
The man blushed, but kept holding it out. “Well, everyone needs some help once in a while, and I’m not offering charity, I don’t want anything back, but this just looks like a college student’s lunch. I mean, it’s literally just ramen and coffee. What else can it be?”
And then there was Natasha. She was a sneaky one, sidling up to Tony as he was chopping cucumber for a lunch salad he was making about a week ago.
The next few days were a blur of activity. Tony found himself, once again, submerged in pack life. There was training, dinners, and movies with the pack. Picnics with the Barton clan where Tony and the kids built rockets and sent them hurtling up into the sky. More than once the rockets got trapped in the high branches of a tree, but luckily there were a few Alphas eager to help fish it down for them.
“Patience, young padawans.” Tony whispered, hands going to the remote control he had secreted away for just this occasion. With deft fingers, eyes never leaving the sky, he turned the controller on a devious smirk twisting his lips. The rockets they had been sending up for the better part of an hour had been simple home kit things. They went up and fell where they fell. The Gold rocket had been a fun project with two of his favorite minions. This particular rocket was remote controlled… and had a fun surprise in store for the Alphas waiting in the distance. As the rocket hurdled back into view Tony began maneuvering it toward the group of Alpha’s laughing and chatting in the distance.
It was then that Tony had learned of Rogers list of demands. Tony was not to leave the Avengers compound. He was not to leave the pack house without express permission from one of the Alphas. He was not allowed access to any of his funds (this Tony had already suspected) and any money that he was given permission to have access to Rogers would have to okay all purchases. There would be no more smoking, no more drinking (gee, thanks mom). Outside communication would stop. Tony would not be able to call up Pepper or Rhodey, or call in favors. He was not to embarrass the pack in any way. Rodgers wanted no bad press to paint his pack in a negative light. They were the up and coming heroes of America and having Tony stain their image with his usual antics was unacceptable. The only thing that Tony should be concerned with was staying out of the way and earning his keep.
. The animosity and bullying had only gotten worse after the injection of serum as a sophomore. He had shot up overnight, beefed out, and thought that Stark wouldn't dare to touch him then.
“Do you think for one second that I would be talking to you if I had another choice Rogers. Hey, no, listen to me.” He said, side stepping into Rogers’ path as the Captain once again tried to leave Tony behind. “Take a look around here Rogers. Realize who they have picked to partner me.” Tony said in a harsh whisper, his eyes tracing the mulish frown of the man who held the future of his world in the palm of his hands.
Turning from the window he rubbed at his burning eyes, fishing out a mug from the cabinet where he had found them earlier. Plain white, all of them, no funny catch phrases or irony here. No cartoon characters of puppy dogs or even a “I went to New York and all I got was this lousy mug”. As a matter of fact, the entire house was like those plain coffee mugs. Sure, it looked nice, but it almost seemed… unfinished. There were no personal touches, no framed photographs, nothing to give a clue into the psyche of the person who lived here. It was like bran cereal. Oatmeal.
Steve blew out an irritated breath before making his way toward him. A part of Tony wilted,  wanted to cower, to bear his neck in submission to the obviously agitated Alpha. Tony ruthlessly beat that part down and met Steve’s snapping blue eyes stare for stare. If he was going to get throttled he was going to do it while standing his ground.
Things had been going well, at least in his mind. With Potts at the helm of Stark Industries they had been able to steer the company away from weapons development and towards more humanitarian technologies.
“Why… why are you doing this?” Tony gritted out, cleaning the forest debris off of himself with quick efficient strokes.
Tony ground his teeth together until his jaw ached with the stress of it. He couldn't afford to go to prison or to be locked away in some Omega facility. There were things that he still had to do, people that needed him, and he could not put himself in a position to let them down. So Tony had swallowed his pride and taken the list of Bachelors.
“Well you know. Maybe just let them start to get to know the real you is all I’m saying.” Rhodey tapped Tony on the head, probably a little harder than he intended to. "Secrets don't make friends, Tones."
As a matter of fact, getting the rockets out of the tree branches became a game in itself to the alphas as they all took turns trying to out-do each other while the others jeered or called taunts from the sidelines. Nat had won for quickness as she all but ran up the tree, flitting from branch to branch before she grabbed the rocket and somersaulted to the ground, landing in an almost feline crouch. Clint had lost points when he tried to shoot the rocket out of the tree and instead ripped an almost irreparable hole through the parachute. His teammates had teased him for being lazy. When it was the winter soldiers turn the kids and Tony had watched with awe as he flipped from branch to branch, dangling upside down to free the trapped rocket before dropping down branch to branch before swinging to the ground. There had been stars in little Lila’s eyes as Bucky had placed the rocket in her outstretched hands. Bruce had hulked out, ripped the tree from the soil, and smashed both the tree and the rocket into pieces. At the end he had gingerly picked up what was left of the toy and placed it into Tony’s shocked hands. Tony had cocked his head to the side to stare up at the panting green Alpha.
“I see you’ve met the chickens. They’re feral. And a little mean. Try to avoid their territory the next time you go off adventuring.”
Tony threw his shoulders back and met the Captain eyes boldly as he sunk to his knees gracefully in front of him. Tony knew the move was fluid and languid, as if he had practiced it hundreds of times. Because he had. One hundred  times every night when he was growing up. He had been made to. Alpha in public but Omega at home. Tony was so fucked up it wasn't funny. It had gotten to the point where he didnt know what was a genuine facet of his personality or what had been ingrained there by Howard Stark.
“Get a room Romeo!” Clint’s holler snapped them both back to reality. Tony squirmed beneath Steve’s body as he tried in vain to free himself from the strong hands pining him to the ground.. Steve chuckled, those same strong hands coming down to frame Tony’s cheeks.
Rhodey told him he played the part of a self absorbed, none too bright, Alpha a little too well. Tony had a lot of practice over the years hiding who he was, his true self, from the public and acquaintances. He wasn't allowed to show the sharp and cutting intellect behind the facade his father had demanded he erect. The reasoning being that if anyone ever found out that he was an Omega, every project he had ever worked on would be questioned. They’d lose funding, supporters. It absolutely rankled that Howard had been right. Look at what had happened to him now, for chrissakes. He wasn't even CEO of the company anymore and that hadn't been enough to keep the sharks at bay. They had been out for blood.
“When have I ever been wrong, Pep?  Did you just snort? You snorted. My poor wounded ego.  I’ll talk to you when I can. Keep fighting the good fight.”
“Please help me understand,”Steve said with a measured patience in his voice that made Tony feel a little smaller. “Bruce is a doctor too, all I am saying is he could take a look-”
“For someone who doesn't want to be under my thumb, Stark,” Rogers drawled lazily, stance rigid “you do seem to be a little desperate. Afraid one of the other Alpha’s are going to give you the comeuppance you so richly deserve?” Tony almost wilted at the thinly veiled resentment in the Captain’s tone. He wasn't getting through to him.
Long story short, it looks like I probably wont be able to post as frequently as I have in the past. So my apologies for that!
Revenge. The towel before him resembled the American flag. The corner of his lip twitched upward in genuine amusement. Despite himself a guffaw escaped. Nearly twenty years ago he had done this very same thing to Steve Rogers.
Clenching his jaw he collapsed into his chair. He was ashamed of himself. Ashamed that he had spent the day cleaning out the storage closet and making Tony’s new bedroom as sparse and uncomfortable as possible without crossing the border of down right neglect. He just couldn't help it. There was too much history there. Too many memories. Steve tried to imagine how Tony felt, but it was hard.
Steve paused for a moment before he inclined his head. “Alright, fair point. Your body, your choice. Did you call and make an appointment? What time do we need to be there for?”
Except that there was a fine tremor working its way up from his knees to his belly. Steve blew right through his chicken guard, who scattered with what sounded like outraged hisses and clucks as he bowled through them. Did chickens hiss?
“Kinda far into the woods for you guys, don’t you think?” Tony murmured conversationally, glancing up at the darkening sky with concern. He was maybe a 5 minute hike from the entrance, 10 with his hobbled ankle. Dinner was usually on the table by now. He was so screwed. How was he going to hide a sprained ankle? It would work out, it wouldn't be the first time he had to cook with injuries, he reminded himself. If he could make a souffle with two black eyes he could barely see out of he was sure he could make a stir fry with a swollen ankle.  A brief glance at his clothes made him sigh again. It looked like he had been rolling around in mud.
“So how do you want to do this?” Stark spoke softly, meeting his eyes boldly for the first time and snapping Steve out of his brooding thoughts. There was a steely determination in those whiskey colored eyes. A challenging expectation in his gaze. For a second Stark looked at him as if he really knew him, and that he was greatly disappointed in him. Something smoldered unflinchingly there. “Shirt on? Shirt off? Do you want my hands over my head or bent over the table?”
Steve had started asking Tony to join them in the gym as they did training exercises as a pack. “It’s a bonding thing, keeps us sharp, you’re more than welcome to join us.” Tony politely declined. Getting beat on by the world's favorite team of superheroes wasn’t high on his to do list.
Tony’s eyes narrowed and despite himself he could feel his temper flare up hot and sharp and choking in his chest.
Rhodey pursed his lips and blew out a hard breath. His gaze narrowing on the group stalking up the road behind them. “You need me to get you out of here, Tones?” His voice was pitched soft, calm, but deadly serious. Tony loved him for it.
A gasp rolled through the crowd as Tony lolled his head to the side, jugular exposed. He knew that he was the textbook perfect picture of Omega submission. The curve of his neck, the cross of his ankles behind him, his hands palm up on his knees, legs spread just so.
But Tony had some demands of his own. Most of them Rogers shot down without a blink of those icy blue eyes. But there was one demand in particular that Tony refused to budge on.
“You have been considered Stark.” Steve’s hot breath fanned against his ear, making a shudder crawl involuntarily between his shoulder blades, tightening the skin there. “Have your contract on my desk tomorrow morning. You will deliver it yourself. We will go over my expectations then. Spoiler alert, Stark, you’re not going to like them.”
“You know what? I bet pizza would be good. Or Korean? We could order some shawarma, I have no idea what that is but I need to try it.”
There was more work to do now that everyone was in residence. More meals to cook, more dishes to clean, more messes to tidy. In those early days it seemed like some of the Avengers, Bucky and Clint really,  were purposefully making Tony’s life at the packhouse harder. It was Tony’s responsibility to clean the house, after all, and the house was suddenly filled with all sorts of things for him to pick up. On one such occasion, only last week,  Bucky had “accidentally” dropped the entire contents of a Wheaties box (because of course, what other type of cereal would Captain America eat?) all over the kitchen floor.
The next morning, after breakfast, Tony went out for another walk. This time with an eye out for any angry, evil, flightless birds. The air was clean and fresh, the grass wet and dewy (apparently it had rained last night), and Tony tried to force his mind from the dark thoughts that had been hovering in his brain since he woke up this morning. He felt like things had improved so far with Rogers, but he couldn't be sure. There was definitely less aggression directed toward him. He wouldn't say they were friends or even necessarily friendly, but something about what had taken place the other night - that shameful humiliating night - had changed the dynamic between them. This morning Steve had even given him a tight smile and thanked him for breakfast. Tony knew exactly how that breakfast had tasted, so it was actually a kind gesture. He turned toward the mountain range in the distance, following the dirt path that led up from the lush green valley where the pack house was situated to the sloping hills that seemed to be calling his name.
Maybe tomorrow. He was getting too comfortable. No sense in pushing his luck. He didn't know, yet, what Steve’s boundaries were and which lines couldn't be crossed. Tony was sure he was going to stumble across them eventually.
“I’ve got a mug set out on the table for you there. Wasn't sure how you took it though, so its just black but if you want cream or sugar-”
He had spent a couple of hours in the barn making his calls. When he walked outside into the fresh air and the bright light of the late summer afternoon, his eyes immediately lighted upon the strong and unmistakable form of Steve Rogers. Had Steve been out here waiting the whole time? The Alpha was leaning against the house, strong arms crossed over his broad chest,  his chin tucked downward as he stared at the grass that swayed gently by his feet. He seemed to be lost deep in thought. Tony felt the tight bands in his chest loosen at the sight of the strong Alpha, a begrudging smile tweaking the corners of his lips as he made his way over to Steve.
“No Stark. It’s not an option.” Rogers jerked his arm away, turning those broad shoulders away and giving Tony his back.
Shaking his head Tony grabbed the towel and dried off. He knew Rogers would never sink so low as to duplicate a highly embarrassing high school prank. Which could only mean one thing.
“We’re in here!” Steve called over his shoulder. Tony tensed, ready to get up, but Steve laid a firm hand on his shoulder, pinning him in place.
“Thanks, Alpha.” As soon as the words escaped him Tony mentally groaned. He had just called Steve Alpha. Which, of course, Steve technically was but to actually say it out loud...
“Bunch of ingrates.” Tony muttered. A moment later he was pelted with overcooked chicken from various pack members. Laughing, he ducked around the corner and back into the kitchen.
“Look, I like Brucey bear. And he is a doctor, sure,” Tony said with a tense shrug “but he is not a specialist in the Omega reproductive field. And although I’m sure he could figure it out  because he’s a smart guy, I’d rather stick with my own doctor who already knows everything there is” he waved a hand up and down his torso “there is to know about my body.”
Tony’s head snapped up from his submissive pose at Rogers feet. He would literally have to resort to begging. The once powerful billionaire CEO now at the feet of his high school nemesis begging for scraps… his father would roll over in his grave.
Steve sighed, that disapproving frown settling deeper and crinkling his brow, “come inside Stark. I will show you around.”
Tony’s eyes darted up, defiantly, to glance at Steve before meeting Bruce’s gaze. “They’re bruised, not broken.” Tony reaffirmed.
The tour continued. There was a good sized laundry room that was also the home of the majority of the cleaning supplies. A large dinning room that boasted a table large enough to fit a small nation. There were also 3 guest bedrooms downstairs which, Steve had pointedly told Tony he was not to enter, as well as a large meeting room chock full of all sorts of fun gadgets and gizmos. One wall was made up entirely of weapons for chrissakes, while the opposite was a slew of computer monitors. So far, it was Tony’s favorite room. Tony didn't miss the scanner on the door outside. It looked like a hand print would be needed to enter this room.
“Absolutely not,” Tony crossed his arms in a textbook defensive gesture over his chest as he tilted up a stubborn chin to meet Steve’s startlingly blue eyes stare for stare. Any warm, soft, feelings that had been percolating in his chest only a scant few hours ago had disappeared after the super soldier's latest suggestion.
The chickens of course, did not respond. What was he expecting? Bracing himself, Tony hobbled his way forward, surprised when they moved out of the way, and then astounded when they fanned out around him in a circle. He had an avian escort. Of sorts. Whatever, weirder things had happened in his life. He wasn't going to look askance at this one.
His musings were cut short when Bucky strode onto the room and deposited the clothes on the counter next to him before leaving. Tony wasted no time in getting dressed, he didn’t want Steve to start doing that for him too. He was done with being coddled. He wasn’t a baby, damnit.
Standing in a clear line across the path were the heath-hens. There were six of the little bastards, and they were all eyeing him with what Tony considered to be a malicious intent.
“The team is currently on a mission,” Steve was saying, finally something that caught Tony’s attention, his cheeks were starting to hurt from the polite interest he had schooled onto his features “and they should be back in a week or less. So that will give you time to acclimate to your new routine. When the pack is in residence it is your responsibility to cook and clean for them. Three square meals. Snacks they can take care of themselves.”
The waves sparkled in the sunlight and a soft breeze ruffled Tony’s hair. Steve surfaced from the warm, blue waters with a smile on his face. A few seagulls chattered away overhead, heedless of the drama playing out below.
Just as surprised, Steve attempts a turtle shrug and waves his flippers around to express his confusion. He doesn’t want Tony to think he’s doing this on purpose.
