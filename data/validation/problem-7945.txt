“Peter,” Tony tries to grab his hand, but Peter shakes him off again, walking away quickly down the hall.
“We used to have a fire place, in Brooklyn. When I was growing up. My mom worked long hours most of the time, so I always liked to have it going by the time she came home in winter.”  He stared into the fire, lost in the memory.
“Then stop doing dumb shit,” Natasha snapped. “Steve didn’t come back with us, you know that? He’s not at the compound Tony.”
“Tony, please,” Steve begs and Tony curls all the way around him, hands tangled in his hair and bites at his lip. He uses his knee to push Steve’s leg farther apart, weighing him down till there’s no space between them.
“This OK?” Tony asked as he unbuttoned Steve’s shirt, slipping his fingers briefly across Steve’s bare chest and stomach, giving him time to adjust to both of them touching him at once. They were taking it slow, as if any sudden change in speed or movement would have spooked him.
He wasn’t scared, or at least he didn’t think he was, but it felt like a massive leap to move his hands the final few inches and slip between her legs. Face heating up, he tried to pull away as Tony settled himself on the other side, bracketing Kara.
“It’s for his own good,” Tony said, defeated. “Trust me. You know me. I’m fucked up in a thousand different ways. Is that what you want for him?”
The weight isn’t the problem. Steve could carry him one-handed if he needed to, but one wrong jostle and his organs spill out.  As it is, he’s losing a lot of blood.  “I’m going to get you out of here, Tony. No matter what.”
“His memories,” Tony says, remembering Peter talking about his mother this morning. “His memories are coming back. In bits and spurts.”
“Medically induced coma, from what Bruce tells me. That’s different. It’s just so my body could heal faster.”
“Good,” he whispers almost to himself. “Very good. Do what I say, ok? I’ll get you there, but it’ll take just a little time.”
Across the playground, Peter’s dangling from the monkey bars, his legs swinging wildly as he tries to kick his body forward.
“Fuck,” Tony hissed. His hands went around Steve’s hips and he rocked against him, nuzzling into the curve of Steve’s neck.  Steve curled their fingers together and let out a soft little moan that made his dick jump.  In his sleepy haze, Tony lingered in the heat between them, physical sensation overwhelming any kind of reason.  He pushed his erection against the soft curve of Steve’s ass, and bit down on his neck, making Steve arch against him. With a curse, Steve took their clasped hands and shoved them down his pants, wrapping them around his own dick.
Steve doesn’t say anything, but his jaw twitches. He has been in Tony’s spot before. Waiting, watching in the medical wing.
“You’re good with Peter,” Steve says, sliding next to him in bed that night. They rarely ever go to sleep at the same time, one or the other of them either on a mission or stuck in the lab or simply not tired. “He’s a good kid,” Tony replies pulling Steve a little closer. This thing between them has been going on long enough that it is no longer new, but Steve’s stomach still flips as Tony slides a hand up his shirt and captures his mouth.
“Give me the eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That’s gonna take a second.” he said, observing the hologram in front of him.
His husband nodded, heading to the trunk with Tony. “Me too.”
Rhodey looked impressed. “Time travel suit? Not bad.”
“I’d like a Bloody Mary, thank you.” Thor said politely.
“Alright, alright. I’ll be in the living room if anyone needs me.” Steve surrendered.
The hero almost chuckled. “He destroyed the stones. He’s dead, but he’s smarter than we thought. The stones are gone. There’s nothing we could do.”
“Is he asleep?” Natasha asked skeptically.
). But then he looked. There was a blonde woman, light surrounding her form, pulling them from where they were stranded.
“According to my research, yes he does,” Tony answered, his eyes also teary.
He pulled her into a hug, and quickly pulled back to see her face. “You’re so big!”
“Only when your ego gets too high.” Natasha remarked, her teasing gaze turning soft when Peter started babbling to her.
When Steve walked in, he immediately took out his phone, struggling to unlock it a bit, before recording what was in front of him. His fiancé and baby boy were sitting on the ground, and Peter was simply babbling to Tony as he nodded, as if understanding every single thing that came out of their son’s mouth. He’d definitely show that to them years from now.
“Send that to Nat, FRIDAY.”
Steve looked up to see the talking raccoon, Rocket, silently comforting Nebula. He guessed they knew each other and lost someone important too. He also saw Natasha with a knowing smile on her face. "I'll say hi later," She mouthed to him.
“Was it juice pops?” the almost five year old asked cheekily.
He threw the baseball glove he had taken from his past and tossed it to Tony. “Yeah. It worked. It worked.”
As Tony turned to go up the porch, he stopped when he heard an engine.
After the devastating fact that they weren’t able to reverse the snap, Steve felt lost. He couldn’t bring back Bucky. He couldn’t avenge Tony and the people he was with on Titan. Thanos has won.
Tony put Peter on his mat and went to open the door. “You’re lucky I love you, Rogers.” When he opened the door, he beamed.
“Alright.” He nodded. “So five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like it’s own microscopic universe,” he explained, “so, to get in there you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she’s my- she was my… She was supposed to pull me out and then Thanos happened and I got stuck in there.”
Natasha felt her own eyes well up with tears, pushing them down, and apologizing. “I’m sorry I couldn’t give it to you sooner.”
?” Natasha asked incredulously.
Tony demanded that Steve’s genes would go to their future baby, saying how Steve was a much better person than he was, that Steve didn’t have addict behaviors, while Steve disagreed. He told Tony that he couldn’t risk giving a baby the effects of the serum. So after weeks of debating, they decided that Tony was the safest option. Tony was still wary about it, but he accepted.
“You first.”
“She contacted me a while ago. She wanted to see what we were up to. We haven’t talked to her in ages, so I thought maybe we could invite her over. She hasn’t met Peter yet, and he’s not sensitive to anything anymore, so…”
Scott finds himself five years into the future, and Natasha misses her best friend.
"Because it's always you."
His aunt smiled, picking him up and settling him on a chair to eat. “Yup, you found out the little secret. They’re going off to save the universe. And when they come back, your dad said he’d fly you to get ice cream.” As disapproving as she was about that, she knew it would make Peter happy for the time being. He had been missing his parents for a while. He had even, for the first time ever, refused to go to sleep because he didn’t know where his fathers were. “How did you connect the dots? You must be really smart.”
Steve kisses both of Peter’s cheeks and hugged him gently. “You are such a little miracle.”
in New York.”
“This is known.” Rhodey summarized.
“Will you find out where he’s going next?” she asked meekly.
Tony would be a blind to not see it. He’d be a fool to not feel it. After a FaceTime with Peter, Pepper, and Happy, he could tell they felt it too. His son wasn’t aware of it, but Pepper definitely had a “everything is already better” look.
Tony let out a sigh of relief. “Yeah, you’re right. Thanks Platypus.”
He posted it and hopped off the ride, offering Steve a hand down. “My image is that I’m a dumbass. The world is already aware. Let’s go get some snacks.”
Option two: go to the nearest book store, buy a copy of his book, and read it. That was also a no. He hadn’t read a book that wasn’t an engineering textbook since he was in high school and he wasn’t going to start now.
“Hurry!” Steve hissed, and Tony helped push, the scales smooth as glass against his palms. She rolled with a sad little noise and Tony crouched down to examine the wound in the dim light from the cart. The scales were torn away, leaving behind a huge gash that was leaking blood at an alarming rate. The dragon’s heart was visible, large and dark, pulsing weekly, slowing with every second.
“I said let it go!”
Steve punched him in the arm. Clint winced.
“Tell you what, I've got an easy solution!” Clint ran into the hall and yelled at the top of his lungs “TONY, HEY TONY! Steve just did something super embarrassing and you need to get up here right now if you want to make fun of him for it!”
Jan took no excuses. “You live on a ranch, you're going to have to learn to love them at some point. Go meet Dottie, we'll take care of dinner.” Jan said, shooing them out. She shoved Tony into the hallway, still holding his screwdriver and a part of the stove. Tony shrugged and looked over at him. “I guess we're going to go meet a cow then.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked back up. “I will go alone. The resistance cannot risk losing her captain.”
“Please don’t touch my foot. I think it’s already in the right spot. It’s fine.”
“Unfortunately falling tends to be part of the job. I'll let you in on a trade secret, superheroing is not as glamorous as it looks.” His gauntlet sparked again, almost to emphasize his point. He needed to fix that. And now the rest of the suit too. There went his weekend plans. He had really wanted to go with Steve to the Met too.
“You know enough to try, and that is all I ask. Remember what you have seen me do in the past few weeks, and do not waste your skills. Any of your skills.”
“Good. Now what can you feel?”
Steve grinned. “I am healed through your tender care. My thanks. I will have to find a way to repay you.”
A fake crowd roared and Tony sat up straighter in his chair. Was this it? Was this the actual interviews? Where was the crowd? In past years this event has always been with a live audience. Christine had said it was live, so what was going on?
“Hey!” Tony said. “You try walking around with a sprain. It’s hard.”
That was great because he was sorry too, so now they could be happy together again. They should get a puppy.
Tony didn't resist.
“Of a book you didn’t write and haven't read!”
Tony looked away and crossed his arms defensively. “It’s none of your business what my pack does.”
How much of their relationship had been a lie? Had it started as something innocent before rotting away into the twisted thing between them now? Had there been a point where Tony mattered as much to Obie as Obie did to him?
He had never had it for as long as they had been together, having gotten it removed shortly before he and Pepper broke up. Once he had started sleeping with Steve, he had kept his shirt on for the first six months of their relationship. When he finally let Steve see, he understood why Tony tried to hide it. Shrapnel scars dotted his torso from hip to the base of this throat, then his chest was a mess of gnarled snaking lines. He had had his first surgery in a cave, and it hadn’t been pretty. Then a second one three months later at a air force base, to clear out infections, reset and sterilize the metal casing, and to saw off part of a rib bone that was rubbing against the reactor. His final surgery had been to remove it completely, extremis helping to fill in the missing muscle and bone. It let Tony breathe normally and bend and stretch without hurting himself. He remembered Tony always tapping and pressing a hand to the glowing circle on his chest when he first met him, and hadn’t considered how much it would have hurt, all of the time, until he was staring at the delicate mess of scars and missing tissue that was Tony’s chest and hearing him explain how much
“No,” Peter says. He fills up another cup with water, this time throwing it in a wide semicircle and splashing Tony’s dress shirt. “Your job is Iron Man. You fight bad guys.”
“Fuck.” It sets Tony’s teeth on edge, his anger rising. Sam slams the coffee table in disgust.
“She’s going to go down on you,” Tony said, possibly whispered, against Steve’s mouth, as if giving Steve advance warning was necessary. “But only if you’re alright with it.”
“You had no idea what it was about,” Steve says quietly.
That elicits a louder shrike but Tony just kisses the side of his face, shushing him softly.
“Are you the emissary? Sent to get me to pay attention to reason?”
The words are sharper than anything Peter’s ever said to him, and Tony practically rears back in surprise.
“Good,” he says and leaves Steve alone with the thick stack of papers.
It would have been easier if Steve objected to Tony covering him like a blanket, but he had merely propped himself up on his elbows and seemed in no hurry to leave the bed.  “It’s nice,” he said almost shyly. “I don’t mind it, Tony.”
“Sometimes,” Steve says. “Sometimes I dream I’m falling out of the sky and sometimes I dream I’m looking for my friends and I can’t find them.” He meets Tony’s eyes, but for only a second before looking away.
“I brought a peace offering, OK?” He gave the pizza box a little shake. It was past 9 and neither of them had eaten. Reluctantly, Steve put down the binder and made space for Tony to sit.
“You like Bucky better because you think he's an assassin?” Steve asked, incredulous. She shook her head, tilting slightly off her stool.
“Don’t laugh, you’re next!”
“You were half dead yesterday, I beg your pardon for trying to keep you alive.”
“We have to find the queen.” Steve insisted.
“I know, I know. Knock it off with the peanuts.” Steve complained, rubbing his eye.
“We are where we are because we both made bad decisions.”
“The most cocky maybe-” Steve replied, but he was smiling, and Tony felt something inside his chest tighten. Steve needed to smile more. Today was the first time Tony had seen him something other than angry or scared, and it was a good feeling to know Tony had been the one to make him grin.
“A small mining camp on the northernmost border. This is where Loki sends everyone who will not swear fealty to him but might one day be useful, if only for mining him more riches. You arrived here this morning, and I’ve done my best to tend to you. My name is Tony.”
“Just peachy. Absolutely great.”
Tony was content to lay there while Steve slept, and he grumbled when Steve started to shift around as he woke up, letting in cool air. Steve tried to pull his arm away to stretch and Tony latched onto him, holding him tight.
“Why not? I looked extra stupid just for you. But if you don’t want to be in it, I’ll delete it.”
Clint picked first, pulling an arrow from the ground and sighing when it came up broken. He stepped back and Thor was the next to pull. His face stayed blank as the broken tip was revealed. Steve pulled the next arrow and his shoulders slumped in relief when it was broken.
“We’re adults. People would stare.”
“I certainly wouldn’t want any more paperwork. I guess you better stay.” Steve said, the corner of his mouth quirking up into a grin. Tony smiled back and held out his hand.
“No. Flirting is hard and Tony is scary.”
“Yeah.” Tony said quietly, an Steve felt guilt well up. Knowing Tony, he had probably spent hours in his BARF machine, running through scenarios, trying to figure out what he possibly could have done different, while on the other side of the globe Steve had been doing the same thing, lying in bed and thinking of scenario after scenario, long after it was too late. He wished he had told Tony everything the second he had found out, because at the end of the day, Tony wasn’t the one who should have done something different. Now all he could do was apologize and try to explain his reasoning.
“You bought me a $900 refrigerator because you were concerned that i didn't get leftovers last time? That’s not a good enough reason!”
It was fun, between the lights and the motion and the music. There was a kid absolutely losing his mind in enjoyment a few animals ahead and it was adding to the overall experience. As the ride ground to a halt, Tony snapped a picture of himself on the horse, Steve on his eagle in the background.
Steve bit him in the throat and tried to squirm away. “Stay away from my pack and my ranch!”
Someone had shifted, gone feral, and ripped his throat out during a drug test trial. I had talked to him just that morning. The last thing I had ever said to him was that he was a sentimental fool for switching divisions. The last thing he ever said to me was not to waste my life. Then two hours later he lost his.
He mumbled it back, and the next thing Steve knew it was morning and Tony was gone, and when he saw him in the kitchen he was back to his normal confident self. But now there was a new softness present in Tony's eyes when he looked at him, a warm hand holding his under the table, a gentle kiss before he left the house.
“I'm trying to keep you from breaking your favorite mug, Tony.”
Tony stared at him with wild eyes, his fist clenched tightly down at his sides. Steve patted the bed again. Tony sat on the edge and crossed his arms.
“I said enough, Clint. Give Tony back the parts so he can be on his way.”
“For saying you were a mermaid? We would never. That water’s freezing.” Clint said with an innocent expression. He poured four cups of cranberry juice and handed them out. They all took one, and Clint raised his cup. “To our magical mechanic mermaid!”
Tony looked to his left at Steve, who gave him an anxious smile. Tony put his hand over Steve's on the table, and Steve felt himself relax. This wasn't a schoolyard crush, this was
He dug in himself, enjoying the taste of good New York style pizza. Wakanda claimed to be the most advanced country in the world, but could they really be that advanced if they hadn't figured out how to top crust with tomato sauce, cheese, and two tablespoons of good old fashioned grease? Everything they had over there seemed to involve a lot of vegetables and not much else. Steve physically couldn’t die of heart disease, it would be a shame not to take advantage of that.
Steve looked through the bowls on the counter top. None of it looked like muffin batter. One was a bowl of screws, another of yarn, one of either frosting or glue. He picked up a bowl filled with carrots.
Steve stood up and examined the man. A claw came whirling towards them and they both stepped out of the way, Tony a half a second before Steve.
Clint patted him on the back consolingly. “So have you recovered? Do you think you're up to get back in there and give it another go? I promise I'll protect you if it looks like Tony's about to say something nice.”
Steve hugged him close, and that was how they stayed until they both drifted off to sleep.
“Tell me Steve, whatever happened to the perfect soldier? Disobeying orders, breaking laws, abandoning friends.You’re supposed to be a symbol for everything good and right in the world. Children have admired you for generations. Coulson held your trading cards. Tony looked up to you. You kept it secret that you found his box of old Cap comics, but what are secrets between you and me? Secrets between you and Tony on the other hand...Lots of lying going on for a national icon. Tsk tsk.”
“He met Liberty, and Liberty alone.” Steve insisted.
“Yes.”
"Is there anything I can do?" Rhodey asked.
Steve gently took his wrist and pressed the thin paper into his hand. “It’s your ranch too, and I don’t think I could stop your crazy if I wanted to. Let’s do this.”
Tony did his best to answer her question. “I was a little busy trying not to throw up or pass out on my feet, thank you very much. I did get his name, he goes by Brian, also known as Captain Britain. I had Jarvis look him up, he's like the British version of Steve, except he claims to have gotten his super strength and all that jazz from magic.” Tony made a face, and Steve met his eyes, acknowledging his hatred of magic and silently reminding him to stay on topic. Tony abandoned his perfectly reasonable tangent about the horrors of magic, and continued.
“You think that’s the craziest thing to happen during the war? Lemme tell ya…”
“And you really needed to come ask me this now?” Steve asked, a little put out. He had to be up by 5 tomorrow, for god’s sake. Through his sleep muddled haze Steve was trying to connect the dots of what exactly was going on. Before he could figure anything out, Tony was already up, leaving, making excuses.
He flew above the birds to where the skies were clearer and tried to peer through the birds for the man he had seen in the video.
Rhodey raised an eyebrow. “I know another man who possess those qualities in no small measure.”
He felt his heart speed up as the nurse got higher with the hose, and Tony grabbed his hand. He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, finger combing out the dust and small pieces of gravel. Steve jerked as Tony touched a tender part. Tony immediately pulled his hand away.
“To talk you out of your funk.”
It was meant to be a joke but it only made Steve’s face filled with concern.
“I’m cooking with love, I don’t need a recipe. I don’t like it when other people tell me what to do. I’ll make them my way, taste them, figure out what I did wrong, then make a new batch until they’re right.” He poked Steve in the chest. “Iterative-” poke, “design-” poke. Steve grabbed his hand before he could poke him again.
Steve ignored him. If he stopped to question Tony every time he did something weird, neither of them would ever get anything done. “Now we need to mix buttermilk, lemons, and the eggs.”
“My orders are to not let you see the boy from 12. Get up, or I will force you up.”
“So who were you? Before the coup against our rightful king?”
Steve frowned and followed him to the hanger bay, and handed him tools as Tony expertly stripped wires and soldered metal. Working with Tony felt natural. Their conversation flowed easily and Tony seemed to know where he would move before he did himself. By the end of the modifications, the suit was unrecognizable. The arms and legs were covered in gold plating, and Tony hammered a missile shell into a crude mask. Steve shivered as Tony slid it over his face, blue eyes peeking out through thick cut holes in the metal.
Tony startled violently, and half stood, before Steve tugged him back down. “So it is true? You can hear her?”
Tony was pounding ineffectively at the bird’s leg when it disappeared with a mournful wail. Tony had no time to celebrate before he realized that he was plummeting towards the ground. He kicked on the suit's rupulsors, and after a half second the lights in his hands flickered out. Then his boot jet went out too. Tony wasn’t surprised, it was just one of those days. He tried to stay in the air, but with only one boot and no hands he wasn't able to stabilize himself and was falling faster and faster.
Two days later, Steve was lying in bed, strategizing. Natasha called it moping, but what did she know.
, who had stuck with him through Hell and back, who had already seen him at his very lowest and still decided to stick around. He didn't need to worry.
“I don’t know. It still hurts.”
Warnings for this chapter: several deaths are described, I tried not to be too graphic.
Steve sat back in the chair. He could have ended the fight in Siberia with a few words. Hell, he could have deescalate things at the airport by dismantling the suit and setting Tony aside by the scruff of his neck.
“Sorry this whole thing didn’t work out.” Steve said, leaning against the doorway. Tony snorted.
“I don’t think an extra ten minutes is going to fix them. They didn’t rise at all. They look like soup. Did you decide to replace the salt with beef stock when I wasn't looking?”
Tony squinted at the small printed words on the name of the spoon.
“Try harder!”
Stern pawed through his papers furiously. “Actually, you still don’t have enough, there’s transfer charges, and a banker fee, and the interest-”
She made a wide gesture with her arms and almost fell off her stool. Steve reached out to steady her and she slapped his hand away.
Hammer continued on, oblivious. “Banner was next. Another small, thin boy. Then Barton and Odinson. Romanoff was last, and I made some good money on that. Everyone thought it would be Odinson because he was the largest but Romanoff has been a wily one from the start, and it gets so cold down in her district. You gotta watch the interviews carefully, that’s where you get the insider information. Rogers was too sick to interview, and he died first. Clear correlation.”
Steve started to pace. A lot could happen in a day. Without noticing Steve had clenched his hands into fists.  He was trying to stay calm, trying not to think about all the horrible things that could be happening to Tony, and how many enemies he had, and how without the suit Tony was a baseline human, and he had a weak heart and his ribs and lungs were messed up from the reactor. Natasha put a hand on his shoulder.
“A very long time ago, though I fear admitting that after seeing how you are on such bad terms with him.”
“So you can call me when you get a lead,” he said, but his cheeky grin and sparkling eyes told everyone that he hoped Tony would be calling for a different reason. Then he strode out of the restaurant confidently, showing no sign that he had been half carried in.
Steve felt his face heat up. That was embarrassing. He decided to drop it, Sam would think what he wanted and Steve denying it would only reinforce the idea that he was hiding something. He went into his room and came out in running shorts and shoes. They went outside and the guard at the gate refused to let them outside the fence for security reasons. Steve would talk to Carol about it later. For now he and Sam ran in circles, round and round, trapped inside the fence. Steve finished the run feeling more antsy and unsettled than when he started. They went back inside and ran into Tony in the hallway. Steve felt like a mess in his sweaty t-shirt and beaten up shoes, while Tony was in a fitted suit and red sunglasses. Tony only wore sunglasses indoors when he was feeling vulnerable. His actions were as transparent as the thin layer of red glass covering his eyes.
“I’m not always the most level headed person, but I wouldn’t have blown his arm off if I had heard from you, and not from watching a video as the finale of in an elaborate series of events set up by Zemo. By the way, he ever get that fixed?”
“Do you forgive me?” Steve asked. It echoed, like he was talking from all directions at once.
Or had Obie been distant from the start, viewing Tony in terms of how much usefulness he could squeeze out of him while plying him with false praise and honey words?
“Some nobody from 12,” Christine responded with a downward twist of her lips.  “His interview is going to be a disaster. Sit up straight, the camera’s are switching back to us.”
“Look, guys, I didn’t know it was like that. I just thought you were being mean or something, like you thought it would be funny to make me get all dirty trying to repair your shitty heater. If you actually need the help, I don’t mind. I’ve always had an affinity for fixing. I’ll put it back together today, and you can bring me home tomorrow, alright?”
Steve brought his team to the tower and ordered them to distract the monsters without killing them. He used the distraction to sneak inside the building and check out the monster. The tentacles were grotesque as he reached out to grab him. Steve cut it off with his shield. After running out of ammo hundreds of times, Steve had switched to a weapon he never needed to reload, and had become familiar enough with it to throw it and have it return to his hand.
Then a new thought struck Steve. “Wait, was that your first time shifting?”
“You called my home a dump!” Like Steve would forget
“We don't have enough people to take care of the cattle. They don't have to join our pack, they just have to help in the summers, and we'll give you a cut of the meat.”
Steve smiled, and joked back, “It's a date.” Then he turned serious, going into what Tony thought of as Captain mode. “I wasn't kidding Tony, if you fly off alone again I'm going to hurt you worse than the birds!”
“Cold builds character. We’ll find a way to survive without sacrificing our integrity.”
“It hurts,” Tony rasped, not sure if he meant his bruises, the loss of Yinsen, or the whole situation.
“Just peachy.”
Sam pushed himself away from the wall where he was leaning and crossed his arms, frowning. “Something wrong?”
“No!” Steve denied, eyes wide.
Why did he always have to go on the offensive? Everything he did wasn’t an attack.
“Thanks, but I think you guys already took care of the crazy guy. I don’t need an escort, I’ll just take my own car.”
And this next one, Sara didn’t have buttermilk so she used 2% milk and vinegar. That sort of makes sense, meanwhile Laurie replaced the buttermilk with strawberry cheesecake yogurt and vanilla pudding. Why? Who sees 'buttermilk' and thinks 'strawberry cheesecake yogurt'?
It was a small couch and Steve was a big guy, there wasn't a lot of extra room and even after Steve folded himself as small as he could onto his side of the cushions, they still would be touching. That wasn't a problem when he shared with Tony, who was more than willing to sit sideways with his legs in Steve's lap or his arm around his shoulders. Even if Clint had wanted to get that close to Steve, he was pretty sure Tony would kill him if he tried. Instead he stole a pillow from behind Thor (who was a huge pillow hog anyway) and sat on the floor. They all settled in to watch the movie. It was quiet for a few minutes, then they started laughing and joking like usual, and the morning was forgotten, except for Steve who sat alone in the love seat and single mindedly continued to eat popcorn by the fistful and ignore everyone else.
“Please Sir, let us know what it is, I don’t think Tony’s heart could bear another moment of this suspense.” He looked up at Stern with puppy eyes, Tony's limp hand clasped between his own.
“You couldn’t just agree with me for once in your life? You’re such a contrarian.”
“Thanks Pep.” Tony hung up, and texted Christine to let her down gently. He promised that if they ran into each other again he’d sign her book. With that taken care of, he needed to figure out what to do to win Steve over.
“Can you get him in for an xray?” Tony asked the doctor as he entered the room. He nodded. “Head and chest. Radiology is ready.”
Steve gave him a shake. “What are you doing to Bruce?”
On the other hand, the thought of watching Toy writhe on the ground like that while Steve stood by helpless was unbearable. It had been painful to watch as antagonists, now that Tony was
Tony let out a yelp and started the shift to wolf, the shift seeming to be a half involuntary reaction considering he hadn’t even got his clothes off. Tony fell to all fours and his limbs bent alarmingly and broke with sharp cracking sounds. Tony let out an otherworldly shriek as his jaw lengthened and teeth sharpened into deadly points. Steve winced back in alarm. That wasn’t how shifts were supposed to work. Steve had been shifting from man to wolf since he was four, easy as he breathed. Tony’s shift took over ten minutes and he screamed the entire time, a horrible wailing sound that deepened into a howl as he completed the change. If Steve had had a voice he would have asked what was wrong. Instead he nosed at Tony carefully. Now fully shifted, Tony was a sleek brown wolf, and he held his head down and panted roughly. When Steve approached Tony snapped at him and pushed himself to his feet, shaking off his clothes and standing surprisingly steady. Steve brushed off his concerns for his opponent and let out a gleeful howl. It was time to spar.
Clint kicked the tire of the truck. “I dunno what happened. Just a half an hour ago I drove into town just fine to get the heater part, no problem. And now the truck won’t start at all.”
“I better try anyway, so I know the best place to take Christine to when we come back later. Let’s go!”
And Steve would mumble “Yes, yes, yes,” into the downy soft fluff of Tony’s hair, and he would feel all on the broken parts inside him settle back into place like nothing had ever been broken.
He stood up and went back to pounding away at the rock, Steve helping when he could. Restlessness burned under his skin, and Tony caught himself shooting glances towards the exit of the tunnels as often as Steve did. The day stretched impossibly long, and when it was time to hung up their tools he sighed in relief. They were unlocked from the row and made their way back to the barracks where Tony checked over Steve’s bandages again. He unwrapped the layers, peeling off the last one cautiously. To his surprise, the cut was almost fully closed, the edges the faded pink of a new scar. Steve gave him a grin.
“It could be anywhere in the woods around here. It could be biding its time in the sky. You’ll never find it.” Pepper declared.
Things went blurry again for a while. Were they in a new room? Tony was still there and that was the important part. Tony had been gone for a while, and he had been so sad.
don’t even like me.”
Behind him he heard Jan slap a hand to her face, and Tony let out a snort. Why was he even doing this? He hated the guy yesterday and he still didn’t know how he felt today. Stupid Jan convincing him he should flirt. Steve felt his face heat, and he knew he was turning beet red. Tony decided to roll with it, thank god.
Clint trotted up to them. “Trouble in paradise?” He asked.
Steve didn’t bother to turn his head, his eyes still half closed and locked on the wall.
Tony looked over his shoulder, to make sure none of the guards were in the room. “Terrible. And you need to hire so new peacekeepers, these guys forced me here like some common criminal!”
“Deal!” Steve responded quickly, like he was afraid that if he hesitated then Tony would take it back. “When do we start?”
Steve put his other hand on top of Tony’s and looked up into his eyes, his blue eyes clear and calm. “I’m going to miss you. For what it’s worth, I was lying earlier, it’s been real for me.”
The crowd cheering sound played again.
“Brian? Nothing. Are you jealous of what we were doing?”
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and led him upstairs to his room. “C’mon, we’re going to practice.” He pushed Tony to the center of the room and sat down on his bed. “Close your eyes, and try to find your wolf.”
“Everyone gives me great favor tonight.”
Tony’s hands tightened on the armrests of the chair. “What?”
Steve punched him in the arm. “I’m your official guide, I wouldn’t lead you astray. Come on, look what they have over here.”
“It's just a saying big guy,” he explained, “to make an omelet you first gotta break a few eggs.” He punctuated his words with repulsor blasts into the teeming fog of ravens, turning them to smoke. He flew back near the jet, hit the birds with his repulsors a few more times then picked up Hawkeye and flew him to a better vantage point to shoot. It was good to have his suit back at full functionality, and he was ready for any tricks these birds might get up to.
Steve put the rag he was using in the backpack and handed Tony a piece of jerky. Tony gnawed on it halfheartedly. With everything hurting, it didn’t leave him with much of an appetite. Steve took some jerky too and finished it off in a few bites. They were going to need to find Natasha or Clint soon, their food was limited and neither of them were hunters. While Tony’s mind wandered Steve had moved closer. He swung a leg over Tony’s and sat so he was sitting across Tony’s thighs, his arms resting on his shoulders. Tony’s arms came up reflexively to rest on Steve’s hips. Oh, this was a blessing. Steve was relatively light and he helped to block some of the wind so it felt like a little cocoon of safety and warmth between them. Tony tried to subtly pull him closer, shifting him down his thighs into his lap. Steve allowed himself to be nudged, leaning forward until their chests were touching.
Then, Tony brought the idea to Steve: adoption. At first, Steve wasn’t sure. Wouldn’t it be better to have a surrogate? Most children up for adoption were children of the people who Thanos had turned to dust. Steve couldn’t handle doing that. He played with the idea of adoption and surrogacy in his head for a while until he decided to ask Tony. When Tony heard the idea of surrogacy, he came up with a question. Whose genes would go to the child?
Happy looked to a smiling, but tired Pepper, and an unfinished sandwich at the table. “You’ll see. But only if you finish your lunch.”
When they all agreed and left, Natasha looked at Rhodey, who hadn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And secondly, time doesn’t work that way. Changing the past
"Oh, thank god." Tony let a smile take over his features.
“Garage.” Peter answered innocently.
“Guess my approval isn’t important, right?” Tony raised his arms, away from his cereal bowl he was making for himself. “But if it is, I agree.”
When he woke up, his bed was empty and he smiled. If the music and the smell of pancakes coming from the kitchen was anything to go by, Tony had gotten Peter to help him make breakfast again. Steve let out a laugh when he heard a loud voice singing the song, and felt his heart swell when he heard Peter’s voice also attempt to sing.
“Alright, alright. That’s a good point. That’s a good point…” Rocket muttered.
Nebula nodded. "It was fun."
Pepper raised an eyebrow. “And would she agree?”
“Which ones?” Tony asked absentmindedly.
The news that the nurses and doctors brought them about their friend, the biological mother to their baby, was one of the worst things they heard that night. She had died after birth, and while trying to process it, they learned they would have to keep the baby there, for breathing problems and his time to develop.
“Did I mention that he started to imitate noises he hears about 2 weeks earlier than he’s supposed to? I’ve done my research, and he’s a little mastermind, so I think I have a right to be proud.” Tony pointed a finger at Natasha.
Her face was in shock and amazement, her belief that her father had vanished was gone. “Dad?”
Tony pulled apart to face Steve, his eyes full of unshed tears and shame. "I let them down. I lost."
“A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time,” Rhodey continued.
Steve smiled knowingly. “We both know that once you start you won’t stop. We have the chance to help people. You know what we have to do.”
“What I’m saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem right now, is we don’t have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can’t stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos, and navigate it? What if there was some way we could enter the Quantum Realm at one point in time and exit at another point in time? Like before Thanos.” he suggested.
Scott surely didn’t want to go there. “Not it.”
“Are you sure?” Natasha asked him.
After getting their juice pops, Tony had led the boy to his room, sitting him on the bed.
When they finally took Peter Anthony Stark-Rogers home, Tony was running around the house like a mad man.
Tony looked at the glove solemnly. He couldn’t imagine that pain.
“I’m sorry,” Natasha sympathized. “That must have been a very long five years.”
“What’s up, regular sized man?” Rhodey mocked, walking in the direction of Nebula.
“I’m being careful!” the other man argued.
“Depends. Are you Natalie or Natasha? There’s one that I prefer much more over the other.”
Tony tilted his head nonchalantly. “Well, I’d substitute the word encounter with damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.” Steve looked at Tony with sadness.
Scott opened the portal, and Natasha double checked everything around Bruce. A week after talking to Bruce, they had figured
“Nat, it’s an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.” Okoye reminded her.
“Hey, Nat… Are you okay?” Steve asked, having heard her broken voice.
She raised an eyebrow. “You
As the ship landed, Steve ran out of the compound, his face completely free of the beard that was once there, toward everyone else. There, Natasha was waiting for him, smiling as she beckoned him over. Everyone was looking up, and when Steve followed their eyes, he saw it. The ship was being carried by Carol Danvers, who Steve had contacted about Tony. He hadn't really spoken to her about anything else, but she was willing to help and she did it.
Steve carried Peter upstairs with Tony by his side, and he definitely didn’t smile at the way Tony was making sure they didn’t fall.
“Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged.” Rocket said.
Peter grunted, sometimes leaning on one side and almost falling, but then balancing himself again. He was almost there.
“So, what are you saying?”
After a while of talking, everyone was sitting around the table, still discussing the stones, while Rocket paced on the table.
ago. Never letting it go.” the woman snarked.
Steve pressed a kiss to his head, knowing what Tony was asking. "Not everyone."
Their 5 month old baby had started reacting to sounds a little early, and now he loved AC/DC as much as his dad. As small as he was, he could squeal pretty loud when he was excited.
“No problem. As long as you let me see the little bug every now and then, we’ll be on good terms,” she ordered.
“You’re just jealous. It’s not my fault he lost interest in that stuffed giraffe you got him three years ago.”
“Can you go call Peter in for lunch? I’ll set up the table.” Steve said to Tony.
“Time travel.” Tony cleared up.
“Hey, Tony Jr.” Happy called him, making Peter giggle. “How’s it going?”
“Awesome.” Tony sent him a smile. “Eggs? Breakfast?”
Tony put his hands up in surrender.
Clint gasped, taking deep breaths as quickly as he could as he came back to the Compound, tears finding their way to his eyes.
“Yes, please, I’m starving. I just dealt with a couple reporters.”
“And maybe not die trying will be nice.” Tony added, opening the trunk.
Tony tapped his helmet, causing the eyes to light that familiar shade of blue. "This thing on?" He sighed. He was thinner than when he came to space, and with everything that happened, it wasn't just the lack of food that caused him to look this way. "Hey Cap. Steve. If you find this recording, don't show it to anyone. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I'm not sure you'll get this message. I'm not even sure if you're still-" He couldn't finish that sentence. It would shatter the little hope he had left. "Oh god, I hope so. Today is day... 21. No, 22." He looked out into the darkness.
forgive him, but he would never stop loving the genius. For weeks he thought that Tony was dead. For weeks, he mourned him along with his friends. He had lost most of his hope, but this small part of him hung on to the fact that they didn't know for sure if he died. Then came the message. If you could call it that. Oh, the relief that Steve felt was exhilarating. It was almost as if the world hadn't practically ended, and all he knew was that Tony was out there, alive. He hadn't shared it with anyone, but simply lied and said the recording was gone, but made sure the team knew he was there.
“First of all, Pops doesn’t like that language, remember? Don’t make me call him down here.” Tony warned.
“Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?”
“Which means we have to pick our targets.” Clint nodded.
“Processing…”
“All right. We have a plan. Six stones, three teams. One shot.”
“You just have to stab me in the back, huh?” Tony shook his head, pretending to be disappointed. Steve laughed.
“That’s the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might’ve wound up pushing time through Lang. It’s tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should’ve cautioned you against it.” he said, ignoring her question and looking cocky.
Tony shook his head. “Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.”
you have a
“Time travel!” Bruce threw his arms up, grinning.
Rhodey held Tony’s shoulders, trying to steady him as Steve listened, but was ready to catch him if he fell. “Tony, you made your point, now sit down.”
“Hold on…” Bruce kept pushing different buttons, panicking.
“He’d like anything you give him.” Pepper scoffed.
“I think daddy and papa are going to be superheroes, like what they tell me at night. He was fixing his iron man suit last night, I saw. And he put papa’s shield in a box.” the child said excitedly.
“Ow! My back!” The old man groaned.
“Cassie?”
The hologram in front of the Avengers presented the Infinity Stones. Tony, Bruce and Steve found themselves pacing at the front of the table.
“Sure was. That’s extortion. There’s a new word for you. Great minds think alike.” He looked back at the model he was working on, then turned back to Peter. “Juice pops was exactly on my mind.”
“He’ll grow!”
“Quill said he stole the power stone from Morag.” he informed them.
I’m so sorry, I tried to get this out yesterday but I didn’t! I really need to get a laptop.
Clint shrugged. “Well, that’s what I heard.”
"Tony. Oh my god, Tony. You're okay. You're here." Steve muttered into Tony's hair, while the other man laid his head on Steve's shoulder.
Tony looked shocked. Last time, he was 1,208. “Wow,” he marveled silently, turning off the lamp. “3000… that’s crazy.” He pulled the door, almost closing it. “Go to bed. Or I’ll sell all your legos. Night night.”
“These are Pym Particles, alright?” Scott yelled, holding the red tube. “And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We’re not making any more!”
kidding, right?”
“Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski.” Tony called to Thor. He turned his attention to Rocket. “Ratchet, how’s it going?”
Natasha paused. “Wait, he lived in New York?” she asked, gathering all the information they had in her head quickly.
“But we gotta give him a name, ‘cause I want to be able to stop referring to him as ‘he.’” Tony pointed out.
“Yeah, I’m totally jealous, because it was
“Neither should you.”
Steve stared at the baby, thinking hard. They had thought of names before, but so far some of them didn’t seem to fit, and he’d forgotten some.
Tony hummed. “Really? Were you looking for it?”
“A planet? Like in outer space?”
I feel like this took too long, I’m so sorry! I was hoping I could’ve posted this yesterday but I didn’t have time. But here you go! Sorry if it’s a lot of time skips.
“Oof.” Peter fell on his knees and hands, sitting himself on the carpet, and when he looked up at his dads, his eyes were watery.
“Friday, you there?”
have everyone. We have an opportunity. And I would never put you or Peter in danger, god knows I don’t want to lose what I’ve been given, but this is bigger than the both of us. You know I lost people too.”
Steve looked at him. “Peter?” As he said the name, Steve realized how perfect it sounded and fit for the baby that was turning his head.
“Right,” the spy agreed. “Good job, Steve.”
“Shit.” Peter responded.
Tony turned off the helmet, the blue light diminishing. He really hoped it would send. He laid down, getting ready for his last sleep. This was probably one of the only times he could go to sleep peacefully since Steve left. His eyes slowly closed shut, and he felt himself letting go. He felt himself reach out for whatever came next, until a bright light forced his eyelids to open. Even when he was dying he only got about 5 hours of rest(maybe it was more time than that on Earth but
“Nevermind. You haven’t been spending too much time with Tony, you’ve been spending too much time with the kid.”
She ignored his question. “What was her name again?”
“Please, please, no.” He pushed himself through a young couple. “Sorry. Excuse me.”
“What, you gonna get another haircut?” Rocket teased.
Pepper shook her head, watching as Peter gobbled down his last bite, and patiently waited. He was passed the bag by Happy, and when he took out what was inside his jaw dropped.
And after months of fussing over the woman carrying their child, Mary Fitzpatrick (who was very kind, and willing to make sure the baby was healthy whenever he or she was in her care) the baby was born after eight months. It was frightening, especially when Tony had reminded Steve it hadn’t been nine months, but when they saw the baby’s tiny chest rise and heard the doctor tell them it was a boy, they felt more relief than before. The relief lasted until they were ushered out of the room when Mary had started having problems. To Tony, it was all a blur, but to Steve it was all too detailed.
Later on, Nebula told everyone about the Soul Stone while Natasha took notes. So far they knew the stone was found on Vormir. Nebula has described it as a “dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence.” It was the place Nebula’s sister had died by the hands of Thanos.
What’s left of the Avengers plan to try to reverse what Thanos did. Tony gets rest, and Steve is determined to reverse the snap for Tony and Bucky.
I wrote all of it on my phone, so there might be grammar mistakes, sorry! I’m also so pissed because I had started writing and it all got deleted so I had to redo it😤
His fiancé changed the topic before they could keep talking about Tony’s ego. “We still have some chicken, rice, and caesar salad if you’re hungry.”
“Is that a person?” Scott asked curiously.
“Wait, wait a second,” Rhodey interrupted. “Let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don’t we just find baby Thanos, you know, and…” the man trailed off, making a tying gesture with his hands around his neck.
Right before he fully closed the door, he couldn’t help but smile at the giggles that came from the room.
Tony then flicked the paper at her position. "That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win."
“Hello?” she couldn’t stop her voice from cracking, and at the sound, she winced.
“I just feel like I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of the lake and go to bed.” Tony confessed.
“Is this the reason I interrupted Rhodey’s mission last week?”
“If you’re about to tell me to look on the bright side, I will find out a way to virtually hit you with a peanut butter sandwich.” Natasha jokingly warns.
“Mr. Stark. You miss me?” Natasha smirked.
The kid looked at Scott, close to tears, and just shook his head and rode away.
It was a fucking miracle.
Steve groaned at being awakened at such a late time. He rubbed his eyes, sitting up slowly and focusing on the figure in front of him.
“See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren’t like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable.” He spotted the abandoned peanut butter sandwich. “Is that anybody’s sandwich? I’m starving.” He grabbed it and took a bite, while the woman in front of it processed the information.
“Can you tell me a bedtime story?” Peter begged, looking wide awake.
Clint leaned on the door frame, speaking up after staying quiet for a while. “I’m game. I’ll do it.”
“Excuse me?” Scott asked nervously.
“It’s alright.” He put his hand on her shoulder reassuringly. “He just loves me more than you.”
“That- who is that?” Natasha asked.
“Shit.” a young voice copied from behind him, giggling.
He shook his head. “No. But what about- we have everyone. We have Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Peter. I have you. What if we could pretend this never happened?”
“Exactly.” Nebula commented.
Bruce hummed. “Bleecker.”
She looked down to see a small baby on his bottom, staring up at her with big brown eyes that looked really familiar. Most likely because she had just looked into some that were just like them. His small tuft of hair was also a certain shade of brown. She smiled, and picked up the child gently. “And this is your spawn? I can tell he’s much more tolerable than you.”
“May…”
Valentine’s Day.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “We just thought we’d surprise you.”
“Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them- Thanos doesn’t have the stones. Problem solved.” Scott said easily.
He quickly scribbled the words “HELP” on a board he found, directing it to a camera he had seen while moving around. After he had been taken out, he decided to go find out what time it was. Really, what he had missed since time in the quantum realm could be different from time in reality.
“It’s a toolbox! Like daddy has!” He marveled at it, and realized that the bag was still heavy. His uncle grinned. “And colors and art! Like papa! And a-“ he narrowed his eyes at the label before slowly pronouncing the word, “chemistry set! Like the cool scientists! Thank you Uncle Hap!” Peter ran toward the man, embracing him and running back to his new supplies.
“Yeah, I know.”
“And… kill it!”
Tony walked toward the small tent that Peter and Steve built together because Peter had a sudden interest in pretending that he was camping outdoors since his fourth birthday.
Natasha sat near the Compound, and she would be lying if she said she wasn’t a bit disappointed by the outcome of the time travel experiment. She believes in Bruce, but he was probably right when he told them he wasn’t an expert in time travel or the science surrounding it.
“What are you drawing?” Tony questioned, fiddling with his hands.
“It’s perfect. Peter it is.”
The boy quickly ran to the table and started biting into his food, and Happy was worried for a bit that he might choke. He watched Peter for a bit, and until he was satisfied that the boy was eating carefully enough, he turned to the woman in front of him.
As the man called for anyone to let him in on the footage, Natasha told her friend on the phone, “I’ll call you later. I’ve got some things to manage.”
“Define lunch or crumble under my wrath!” Peter declared.
“Glad to know my little bug still loves me.” Natasha smiled at the thought of her nephew.
“I’m sure he misses you too. You can’t forget your best friend.” Steve knew she was still upset about Clint.
“Tractors engaged.” Bruce confirmed.
“I trust you two to not ruin the kitchen!” Steve said from the living room where he started watching television.
His face turned from confusion to worry when he saw all the missing posters, abandoned belongings on the streets, and homes that looked like nobody had stepped into them in years. Then, he saw a kid on a bike that seemed to be used to the environment around him pass by.
“No, no, Cassie, no. Please, please, please…” he trailed off, his eyes widening at shock at the name in front of him.
“Uncle Happy!” Peter squealed, running towards him. The man couldn’t help but let out a smile at seeing the kid.
Peter stared up at his father blankly, big brown eyes full of wonder, before he seemed to realize Tony was waiting. He gurgled, and started babbling while his dad listened intently.
Peter laughed. “
Peter looked up at him shyly. “You and daddy were fighting big monsters. And then…” he trailed off, sobs racking his body. “And then it ate you and I cried but you wouldn’t come back! Daddy was crying too and he wanted to save you.”
Rhodey nodded. “Hot Tub Time Machine, Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.”
“Yeah. Why not?”
While Tony and Steve waited to visit the baby, they slept. The hours they had been awake had taken a toll on them, even though it didn’t feel like very long at the time. So when the nurse came to tell them the baby was ready for visitors, but sensitive to touch, they practically raced to the room.
“In the count of three. Three… two...one!” He pressed the same button, but instead of Scott appearing in front of them, a teenager did.
“Sounds like a deal.” Natasha agreed, shaking their hands. She wouldn’t want to lose Peter either. She knew how hard it would be for Tony to try; he had gotten so lucky with the life he built after the Snap.
Tony grabbed a bag, and Steve pulled out a shield.
“Bah!” Peter mimicked.
?” Peter’s voice made Happy whip around to look at him.
“Oh, come on. I can jazz to a few tunes, as you’d probably say it. Right, Pete?” Tony pokes Peter’s belly, causing him to grab his finger and start shaking it around. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Pepper chuckled, smiling slyly. “I recall them telling me they tried you four times. You were probably asleep.” She turned to pour apple juice in a plastic blue cup. “Or,” she took the cup to the table and set it in front of Peter, then turning to Happy again, “you were busy with that nurse you met at the hospital.” Happy’s eyes widened, his cheeks going pink. It surprised Pepper, but she basked in his flustered state.
This should have been updated on Sunday or Saturday, so I’m so sorry! I had trouble writing this for some reason, and it might be bad. I need to start working on the next chapter ASAP.
“That’s my boy!” Steve said.
“Yeah, well, six months can be a lot of time for things to be forgotten.” Natasha sighed.
“Are you calling my kid a pest?” Tony asked, fixing the pillows on the couch where Peter was laying.
“Are you done?” he asked, wiping the sticky red substance on Peter’s lips away, and eating the rest of what was left on the stick. “Now you are.” He pushes the boy’s face with his whole hand down onto the bed. “That face goes there.”
“Clint, now you’re gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don’t worry about it.” Bruce reassured him as Clint stood on the platform.
“Just a moment.”
Peter slowly came out of the tent with an iron man helmet on his head and a glove that looked like a repulsor aimed at his dad.
Tony stood proudly. “Of course he is. Look at his father.”
“Right?” Scott agreed.
“Somebody peed my pants.” Scott cringed. “I don’t know if it was baby me, old me, or
Tony had promised him.
“And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out. I’m just kinda-“ he stopped, eyes wide at what he’d just discovered.
The younger version of Scott looked around and at his body. “Uh, this...this doesn’t feel right.”
She pulled down the lever, and the normal Scott came back out.
Then, Tony fell to his knees. Rhodey and Steve dive into catch him, but Tony waves their hands away. “I’m fine! I’m fine.” They decide to trust his words, until he collapsed.
A large ship landed in the yard, near the Compund. Once it had settled onto the ground, the door opened to reveal two members of the team.
“Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.” Tony said.
“Oh, look.” Rocket cooed mockingly. “It’s like a little puppy. All happy and everything. Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I’ll get you to space.”
“No.” the small boy defended. “I found it, though.”
Tony raised his arms up to mirror her movements, then put his arms down. "You don't need to do that. Because-uh, you're just holding position." Nebula flicked the paper at Tony's positioned hands, almost making it. "Yeah, that was close." Nebula flicked the paper two more times, making it the third time. "That was a goal. We're now one apiece."
Steve and Tony hugged and shared a kiss, and Steve picked up Peter, spinning him around, only stopping when he heard his son making noises.
Then they were on to the next step. Trust. It had taken two weeks for Tony to let Steve hug him out of nowhere, and they had spent time building the house together so they had taken some baby steps. A lot of baby steps. They planned that every night, they would talk about everything. Maybe what had gone through their minds that day, and they promised each other they wouldn’t hold back. Tears were spilled, hugs and kisses had occurred, and fights had too sometimes. But there were always apologies. They would work on that for a bit longer.
“Oh, thank you, thank you.” Tony slid over to where Steve was sitting with a huge smile on his face.
Steve was about to go on a rant about how when Peter could walk, he’d show him how to actually dance to music, when their doorbell rang. The baby had jumped slightly at the noise, his brown eyes widening in surprise. Tony sighed, thank the gods that the doorbell hadn’t scared Peter enough to start crying. He hated seeing his baby in distress, and getting him to calm down could prove to be difficult.
“Correct.”
“I knew he’d like it.” Happy said smugly.
“Bambino!” Tony called, clapping his hands. “It’s chow time!” He sat himself on a small chair near the tent. “Peter Anthony Stark-Rogers, want some lunch?”
“Nat?” A look of disbelief washed Tony’s defensive look away.
Thank you for the comments and kudos, I’ll try to write more chapters today but online work is piling up right now.
“Tony is one son of a bitch. Steve too. They could have called!” Happy sighed, rubbing a hand over his face.
“That’s a horrible story!” Peter laughed.
“Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?” Steve asked the god, who was sitting on a chair, sunglasses on and a can in hand.
“Can I get a little space here?” Bruce looked around wildly.
“God, we both need a therapist.”
Tony quickly interrupted. “Now, before we commence our mission, I’d just like to say that if this ends up not working and I come back to my kid as an angsty teenager that’s in a constant state of ‘nobody understands me’ it’s on you guys.” Everybody smiled at his joke, something the original six had oddly missed. Steve took Tony’s hand in his, reassuringly. “You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.”
“Well, you were closer,” she replied.
Natasha looked at him gratefully. “Tony-“
Rocket looked impressed. “He’s pretty good at that.”
The helmet on Peter’s head was removed, and Tony smoothed out Peter’s ruffled brown hair. “There you go. Thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.”
“Come on, baby. Come to Papa. I’m right here. It’s okay if you can’t do it, just try.” Steve encouraged.
“Huh? Peter? Are you alright?” Steve asked worriedly.
The genius took a second to think. He had spent so many years protecting the Earth. Protecting families not unlike his own. And now a majority of those families were torn apart by the Snap, and he couldn’t imagine the pain he’d go through if he had lost Peter like other parents lost their children. His husband, as happy as he seemed to be, was still grieving his friend, his family. He lived to see his love and his son happy.
“Indeed, I have, mini Captain Stark. One day I’ll take you away from the fossil and can man for a secret trip.” Natasha smiled deviously.
Tony and Steve choose to move on together and they seem to need an anchor to pull them back to Earth, and that happens to be Peter.
Tony stood up straight. “Wrong!”
“Intuitive.” Pepper chuckled. “You sure are. Do you want anything to-“
“Not that it’s a competition, but Peter loves me 3000. I think you were somewhere in the low 12 to 900 range.” He boasted.
Steve, Natasha, Tony, Rhodey, Bruce, and Nebula, and Scott stood near a control panel.
“Who told you that? I didn’t fight him. No. He wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the stone. That’s what happened. There was no fight.” Tony said. “He’s unbeatable.”
The boy’s eyes widened a bit at the mention of his father knowing he said the
Steve furrowed his eyebrows. “Are we talking about the same thing, or…”
“I’ve got a job to do.” He responded.
Tony quickly got up. “Did you get the stones? Can we bring them back? Is he dead? Please tell me the universe is free from him and his ballsack of a chin.”
He was so, so close. Just three more steps. And-
“Then it’s settled! As soon as your little man turns one, he’s going to have the time of his life with his new Aunt Natasha.” she crossed her arms.
“Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of places throughout history.” Bruce told everyone.
“Okay.” Rhodey sighed. He left the call.
“Did he really just say that? He means it, right?” Steve’s eyes filled with tears.
Natasha’s gaze turned from sympathetic to confused.
Peter nodded. “Don’t look!” He was sitting on the counter and holding a spatula, his shirt covered in batter.
“Yeah, and now we smell like garbage.”
“That’s not how it works.” Nebula corrected.
“I don’t know why everybody believes that, but that isn’t true. Think about it: if you travel to the past, the past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can’t be now changed by your new future.” Bruce explained.
He was even more confused now. They thought he was dead? Cassie thought he was dead? As quick as he could, he made it to his hometown and to the home he could only hope his daughter was still in. He knocks, and right when he doubts his peanut is still here, he sees a young woman walk to the door. When she opened the door and stepped out, Scott knew it was her. He could recognize that face anywhere.
Scott ran through the stones, searching and searching for familiar names.
"Here." Tony looked up from Steve's shoulder to see his best friend smiling at him, his eyes worried. Tony pulled him into a hug, and before he could even ask, Pepper ran up to them and joined in. Tony couldn't believe his luck. The three people that made him a better person, that made him feel like the luckiest person in the world.
“Just… it was a joke.” Bruce told her.
The day had gone just like any regular day. Peter and Tony played around, and Peter begged Tony to tell him more about science and math. He was always desperate to learn new things, just like his dad. Then, he and Steve went to go paint and watch the view they had from the porch. After that, Steve and Tony went to prepare lunch while Peter played around the house. They trusted him not to get hurt, everything was baby-proof even if he was almost five.
“Don’t what?”
Steve grinned.
“May!” Pepper laughed. “You’ve got to invite her over sometime. I’m surprised you haven’t told Tony. And you were going all off about him not telling you about leaving on his mission. Even though technically he tried to.”
The other man’s face fell immediately. “You’re kidding, right?” He studied Steve’s face. “You’re not kidding.”
“Of course not. I wouldn’t take that title away from you. He just seems like he’s very fond of crawling around.”
“I figured it out by the way.” he blurted.
“Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one.” Bruce turned to the other man. “Scott, fire up the, uh, van thing.” He gestured to the vehicle.
“Quantum Leap.” Scott added.
The older man raised his eyebrow, turning around to see his son sitting on the steps of the stairs and smiling at him.
“‘Cause I got some important shit going on here! What do you think?” Peter gave Tony a scolding look. “I just got something on my mind. Something on my mind.”
“Great!” Tony rubbed his hands together. “Reassemble our little band of misfits.”
When he heard Peter’s even breaths and it was quiet enough to hear Tony’s small snores, Steve fell back asleep himself.
“I was gonna ask you something. And I wanted to check up on my friend.”
“I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job… this family. And I was… I was better because of it. And even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be better.”
When Nebula made another goal, Tony said, "We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun." Nebula let a small smile sneak up on her face at her accomplishment.
So that’s when they talked about the life they wanted to have
“What? I see this as an absolute win!” Bruce said optimistically.
“Not likely.”
After a while, Tony had shown him the place he would build the home. It was beautiful, and Steve could already see the beautiful views that he could draw. When they both looked at the house in person, they shared a look of happiness, a look Steve wanted to see Tony have for the rest of his life.
“Hey, hey.” Natasha comforted him. “Look at me. You okay?”
“What do you mean?”
“You’re right. I do, Black Widow.”
“I thought that was obvious.” Tony moved to let his old friend in, but as she came through, she felt a tug on her pants.
Bruce then sent him back into the tunnel, and out came an old man- Scott.
Peter jumped, trying to peek inside. “What is it?” What is it?”
“Don’t give me hope.”
“That was my day.” Tony concluded. “Yours?”
“Calm down.”
“I know.”
“Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. Nothing sounds crazy anymore.” Natasha said dryly.
“A story…” Tony hummed. “I have a perfect story. Once upon a time, Bambino went to bed. The end.”
Still confused, Scott finds himself at a memorial-like place. A sign is in front of it labeled “The Vanished” and many rectangles of stone that had names. Scott started panicking- the names of people that died? That went missing?
“Thank you, Nat. It means a lot.” Steve nodded.
“No!” Peter made a face.
“I know,” she sniffled, “but maybe if I could still figure this out, he’ll come back.”
“Well, I can't help everybody.” Tony shrugged.
“You love that story!” Tony argued. He pulled the blanket up to Peter’s neck, and kissed his forehead. “I love you tons.”
“You shouldn’t be here.”
So they had part of the team assembled. There was still one person missing, though. Natasha had insisted on going after him. “Who else could?” was what she had said when the subject was brought up. It confirmed her doubts and worries when she caught him in the middle of a “mission.”
“Then it’s settled. Can you call Pep for me? She might have to take a day off and babysit.”
The noise made Bruce come out, heading toward Scott, and offering two tacos because of the dropped lunch.
It's short, I know. I didn't have that much time and I really wanted to get it out. I'll start working on the next one asap, I promise.
Steve shook his head, smiling amusedly. “He scoots.”
“Nat…”
It turns out Bruce and Rocket we’re going to New Asgard, in the countryside of Norway, to collect Thor and convince him to help them with their plan. Everything hadn’t gone exactly right, Thor had suffered greatly from the losses of the Snap and the destruction Thanos brought upon his home and his people. He had agreed to come because of alcohol apparently, but it was enough.
change the future.” Bruce firmly stated.
Steve knew Tony would never
“Oh, did I? Thank god I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it.” he joked, pulling out a device. “Fully functioning time space GPS. I just want peace.” He said nonchalantly, holding up a peace sign. “Turns out, resentment is corrosive and I hate it.”
Thor suddenly jolted awake, getting up. “Where to start? The Aether, first, is not a stone. Someone called it a stone before. It’s more of a...an angry sludge thing, so someone’s gonna need to amend that. Here’s an interesting story though…” Thor stumbled around, going on an adventurous rant that became pitiful at the end, mentioning black elves, Jane, his home, and his mother’s death. “-and oh, you know, Jane and I aren’t even dating anymore, these things happen though, you know, nothing lasts forever…” he seemed close to tears and Tony decided to guide him back to his chair. “No, I’m not done yet…” Thor argued. “The only thing permanent in life is impermanence!”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll do my best.” Clint replied.
In the first week of having Peter at home, Tony was constantly worrying. He didn’t stop until Steve convinced him that he was already a great dad and that Peter needed his dad to be able to have a good childhood. At this, Tony realized if he kept worrying about hurting Peter and avoiding touching him in case, he would become
“Like a time machine?” Natasha asked incredulously.
When Steve first laid eyes on his son, he let out a huge smile. He was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. The sight of his son made him feel like that scrawny kid from Brooklyn again, his dreams of a family life coming true. He had thought he found the love of his life when he met Peggy Carter, and when those dreams were crushed and he woke up to a new world, he told himself the family life wasn’t for him. He was destined to be the hero everyone knew him to be, and that only. All daydreams he had when he was younger would stay dreams. But now- now he had a man he loved so much by his side while he looked at his son for the first time. He knew he’d do everything and anything for the two loves of his life.
Steve couldn't calm his heart. He was pretty sure that if he stopped bouncing his leg, he would collapse. Tony would be arriving tonight, and for the first time in what felt like forever, he was excited. Scared, but excited. He hadn't seen Tony in, what, two years? Of course there were news reports about him, but on-screen Tony was never the same. He still regretted his actions- the punches he threw, to the man he loved. Whenever he thought back to it he was disgusted. Was this what Dr. Erskine wanted him to become? A hero gone rogue? A man who would hurt his own love?
“Yes, sir.”
Tony gasped dramatically, looking at Natasha with a betrayed look on his face.
Steve face palmed. “That’s what I forgot today!” Tony raised an eyebrow. “It’s Nat.”
“Where are you?” she asked.
“Good luck, Scott. You got this.” Natasha smiled.
He shook his head quickly. “No, no not a time machine. It’s more like an, uh… yeah, a time machine.” He gave up. “I know it sounds crazy. But I can’t stop thinking about it. There’s gotta be some way, it has to be possible. It’s crazy.”
Natasha took a breath, trying to hold in her tears when her phone rang. She looked at the contact, seeing the name Steve and collected herself.
a good parent. Peter will love you no matter what, and so will I. Now come with me to take him to the nursery, that he probably won’t hate because he’s a
“Oh, right. Tony and I were thinking of having a small get together with Rhodey, Pepper, Happy and you. A day to catch up. Tony has been dying to see everyone again, even though Pepper and Happy visited a week ago. Peter’s also been begging to see his Aunt.”
“I love you 3000.” Peter beamed.
“Sorry. Force of habit.”
Tony rethinks his decision, and the team fails at time travel.
“No need,” he interrupted. “Just had to get that out of the house before Peter decided to use it on one of his LEGO weapons. Keep it on the downlow, though okay? I didn’t bring presents for the whole team.” He paused. “We are getting the whole team, right?”
“Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.” Carol bristled.
“Just the-“
Steve looked up at her, immediately stopping his leg from moving. "Sorry."
A helmet quickly covers Clint’s head, and he was thrown into the Quantum. Everybody patiently waited for their teammate to be brought back, silently worried.
“Okay, when I say kill the power, kill the power.” Bruce told her, causing her to rapidly move toward the generator.
Peter let out an exaggerated gasp, his eyes lighting up, when he saw through the window a familiar car.
“I’m being very careful.” Bruce said.
“Breakers are set. Emergency generators are standby.”
Natasha pinched her nose, shaking her head.
She looks up when she hears an engine, and maybe it was because of the quiet environment, but it was unusually loud. She saw a surely expensive car zooming into the driveway and pulling up a little ahead of her. She smiled when it backed up and the window rolled down to reveal two friendly faces.
“No worries, we don’t!” Peter tried to reassure his father.
“No, I think he’s agreeing. Right, little bug?” Natasha cooed at the child.
She nodded, laughing with tears in her eyes as she embraced him again.
After changing, he walked back into the room in the suit Scott once wore. Bruce looked up at him.
“Nat!” Steve walked into the living room, his hands dry of the soap and water from the sink. “I’m so glad you came, and I see you’ve met Pete.”
“That's what you want.” He gestured to the iron man helmet. “Where’d you find this?”
“It was an infectious garbage scowl.” Nebula added.
“It’s Rocket.” the raccoon corrected, annoyed. “Take it easy. You’re only a genius on Earth, pal.”
“Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.” he answered.
Then they decided on the life they wanted to live. They both wanted quietness, that was for sure. The angry yells of people on the streets were too stressful. They wanted justice that couldn’t be given. With the other Avengers dealing with the press and telling the public what had happened, why their loved ones disintegrated, Steve and Tony realized they weren’t needed. Tony donated to some new charities and paid for damages, and Steve had a conference with the government, but after that, it was out of their hands. They were as stuck as everyone else.
Steve chuckled, pushing Tony’s shoulder teasingly and giving him a scolding look that looked eerily similar to the one their son had given him a few days earlier.
“What is this?” Natasha questioned.
Nebula looked away, speaking into her earpiece. “Rhodey, be careful on reentry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone.” She walked away confidently, and Scott shrugged. That's when he got startled by a figure landing right near him, making him drop his taco.
“The time heist they were talking about, yeah.” Tony said nervously.
“Why do I feel like you’ve been spending too much time with Tony?” Happy sighed, sitting at the table. “Old Pepper wouldn’t do this to me.”
“Please.” she begged.
Professor Hulk observed the suit, touching it and poking the red tube.
“We’re glad to have our best heroes back too.”
“Aunt Pep, do you know when daddy and papa are coming home?” Peter asked, his hands busy with his toys.
Peter giggled mischievously. “Okay.”
Now everyone was telling him to move on- but how could he? Everyone, every family, was on the streets, yelling for the Avengers to fix this. There were people mourning their children, their siblings, parents, friends, and even pets. How could he move on when every day he woke up he was reminded of his failure?
“It’s Scott!” Bruce claimed.
Before Steve could argue, she hung up, still watching the screen intently.
“It sounds like you can.”
“Hey, hey! Easy, easy!” Scott warned.
“Soon, Petey. You’ll blink and they’ll be right here again.” Pepper told him softly, cutting a sandwich into triangles.
“Papa?” Steve heard his son whimper.
He couldn’t hold back his tears at the thought of bringing the lights of his life back. “Don’t.”
“No, we’re just talking!”
Peter shrieked happily at the sound of his favorite song, and Tony laughed at his baby’s wiggling feet.
“But a lot of people didn’t.” Steve reminded him.
“Die Hard? No, it’s not one…” Scott shook his head.
“Model rendered.”
“Yes, sir,” the A.I. responded.
The father’s eyes widened. “Lila?” he murmured in disbelief. Suddenly, the watch-like time machine GPS started beeping. He had to go. “Lila!” Clint called desperately, trying to get to his daughter just one last time, before he went back to his present.
“Bring Scott back!” Natasha demanded.
“Bring back what we lost? We hope so.” Steve continued. “Keep what we have? We’ve got to, at all costs.”
When Natasha had sat down and started eating, she told them what had been happening with everyone.
“Guys,” Natasha came to a realization, “if you pick the right year, there are
“Oh, thank god.” She put a hand over her chest, relieved.
Steve sighed. “You’re not Howard, Tony. If you’re worried about being a good parent or not, you
Meanwhile, Clint observed his surroundings, and the memory of his loving family hit him painfully. The helmet retreated, and he noticed a baseball glove that he knew belonged to his son. He looked up when a noise came from the stairs. A familiar voice he loved followed.
“It’s only been 6 months since he last saw you. Of course he’d remember you.”
“They’re asking about you guys. They wanna know where their heroes went. Don’t worry, I told them you both are living your private lives, retired from the hero duty. Nothing about Peter.” Natasha assured them.
Pepper shrugged his hand off, standing up and taking out a tablet from a drawer. “I don’t have time for this. We have to call Tony and Steve or they’ll have a heart attack.”
“The plants in the garden.” Steve answered.
you can imagine. But the parts that still work are trying to take a census. It looks like he did what he said he was going to do.” Natasha added.
The woman turned to see what he was looking at, and when she saw she sighed tiredly. Getting the boy to stay in one place and eat was hard enough without his fathers there. Now there was one more distraction.
“That’s enough for me.”
word. Then he started questioning his dad. “Why are
. They wanted to be able to bond, and fix their relationship in peace. Tony had said he would talk to Pepper about their plans, and how she would be happy enough to take over without him there, as she was already the CEO. They talked about a lake house, a quiet life, a small, private wedding, and a child. Steve wished he could have recorded the look on Tony’s face when he mentioned a child. His face had lit up with a smile, his eyes already dreaming of it. It was a look Steve knew, a look of excitement, doubt, unsureness, and hope.
Rocket turned to Carol. “So, thanks for the hot tip.”
“What the hell?” the confused man grunted, standing up and deactivating his helmet. “Hope?”
“Are you okay?” Natasha asked after she brough Scott in, who was pacing around the room as if struggling to say something.
“That time stone,” Natasha brought up.
“No, you’re being very Hulky.” he disagreed.
“That’s terrifying.”
Before anyone could say anything more, someone interrupted. Camera footage suddenly popped up in front of Natasha, and she saw a man in front of her she swore had been declared one of the victims of the Snap.
Steve was speechless. Carol placed the ship on the ground, and when the small door opened, Steve felt his eyes water. There was Tony, looking weaker than he had ever seen him, leaning on a blue woman. Natasha shook her friend's shoulder lightly to snap him out of his shock, and when he realized it was all real, he ran up to the man he loved more than anything. The blue woman gave Tony to Steve, and he pulled the thin man into a tight embrace.
Natasha gave Steve a side hug, making sure she didn’t drop the baby in her arms. “I’m glad I could come too. He’s adorable, guys. Really.”
“First of all,” Bruce started, horrified, “that’s horrible.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.” He fiddled with his hands a bit. “Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?”
Steve took Peter out of Tony’s arms, nodding at Natasha. “That would actually be a good idea. Peter needs to see the city more often, seeing as how he’ll be there sometimes.”
Bruce sat up from his spot on the floor. “Shut the front door!”
“Among other things, yeah.” Natasha laughed. “What are you guys doing here?”
Scott put his helmet on, shaking off his nerves. “Perfectly not confusing.”
. I have a family now, an amazing husband, and a beautiful son, but I can’t help but feel like there’s still hope.”
“Yeah, dad?” Lila asked, surprised to find nobody there. “Dad?”
Bruce pressed the button to send him into the tunnel and counted.
Bruce nodded, pressing the side of a button pad and hoping for the best. The old man was sucked back in, and instead of what they wanted, they got a baby, again, Scott.
Steve pulled out his phone and dialed the number by memory, before putting it to his ear and listening to it ring. Then he heard his own voice on the line.
“Ah. Do you want to go back and put on a tighter shirt? We’ll wait for you.”
“Nice! Do you have an Instagram? I’ll tag you.”
“If you come, you will lose this home. You will lose your health, your peace of mind. You will lose people you love. That isn’t a guess, it’s a fact. Will you still follow me?”
Steve’s eyes locked on the door. Bucky? Bucky was here?
Thanks for reading!
“Hi guys, look who I found in the hallway. It's Steve, the most handsome and kind man in the whole world.”
Oblivious to his thoughts, Tony wiped his hands on a rag. “Um. Am I interrupting something? I heard my name.”
Steve reached out a cautious hand. Normally Tony didn’t like it when people touched his chest, he felt like a freak and weirdly vulnerable with his weakness on display. Somehow, Steve was different. He felt safe. It went deeper than knowing that this was the great man from the stories. It felt like trust tied to his very heart, and he knew in his bones that Steve was not intending to harm him.
They fell into an awkward silence. Jan gave him a nudge, and he looked at her helplessly. What was he supposed to do? Hop on the table and burst into song? She shook her head at him, and he could tell she was thinking he was hopeless. He had never learned to do much in the way of small talk, since Tony was the first nonpack member to ever stay at their ranch. They had a couple of neighbors that would stop by to talk to his Ma, then they would be gone in an hour or to. He didn’t usually notice, since he was busy with chores or hanging out with Bucky. Bucky was the one who was smooth with girls. He was quick witted and charismatic and handsome. That's what all the old ladies said, ‘What a handsome boy’. Neither of them took any note of it until the girls their age started saying it too, whispering it behind their hands, their cheeks blushing pink. While their Ma would be inside the supermarket selling the milk and eggs, they would stand out front by the soda machine and all the other kids would gather around Bucky. He always had a wild story to wow them with, and when he got older he switched to charming the people at the local bar without a hitch. Steve didn't appreciate going to town the same way. He liked the ranch, he liked his pack. Outside, there were rules about what you could say or do around the normal humans. When he was eight, His Ma had banned him from the supermarket for a month after he got on all fours to sniff a kid. And he always found himself pushed towards the outside of the group. Nobody was ever mean. Bucky wouldn't have stood for that, and everyone wanted to impress Bucky. He just was there, standing in the back, lost in his daydreams while everyone else fought to be the center of attention. His Ma told him he'd grow out of it, and he had never figured out exactly what he was supposed to grow out of. Ten years after their first visit to town, people were still drawn to Bucky's aura of danger and mystery, and Steve was still the kid brother they all tolerated because it made Bucky happy and Steve never caused any trouble anyways.
Tony nodded and fiddled with the IV bag and Steve felt the pain dull. The drugs Helen made really were something. They reduced pain even for his insane metabolism, with minimal side effects besides some drowsiness. They also took three days to synthesize and had a half life of a week, so the fact that there was a bag ready at the compound meant Tony had been prepared to help Steve before any of the negotiations.
Steve pushed some wrinkled out of the sheets with his hand, trying to figure out how to say this.
“Do either of you need any help?” he asked. Jan handed him the mayonnaise and the bread so he got out a knife and started spreading it on with even strokes. Tony didn’t bother to look up from his work. “Did you know that just about every appliance you own is broken?”
Tony turned on him. “What if you are the one threatening me?” he asked bitterly.
He shut the pad off before putting it back down on the table so all the others could see was a black screen.
The guard pushed Tony's head down and forced him in the car like he was some sort of criminal. He tried the door handle and it was locked. He pounded on the divider between him and the driver. “Let me out! Hey!”
“It was my choice to stay inside and learn the family business when I was young. And it was my choice to spend a few days settling in now.” Tony’s eyes were bright with rage. “Knock it off with this psychoanalysis bullshit, we both know you only passed ‘Intro To Psych’ because you were fucking the TA.”
Tony looked down at the can then back up at him in confusion. “Real soda? Diet Coke? You want a Pepsi?”
"Don't I know it." Steve said with a sigh and lead the team onto the jet. Soon they were in the air heading towards the city limits. When they got there, Tony was already standing next to Captain Britain, fiddling with a piece of machinery while the Captain fended off the birds. Steve hopped out of the jet before it was fully on the ground and stalked over.
“Maintenance? Nobody is allowed to touch those planes without express order from the king and while supervised by the chief engineer! Let me in this instant!”
Steve started to unlace Tony’s boot, and carefully pulled it off his foot. “That’s normal. A bad sprain can last for a week, even if you ice it and stay off it. I’m sure hiking around the woods all day today didn’t do it any good.”
She gave it to Tony with an exaggerated sigh. Tony moved the photo she took of him and Steve to the trash, then cleared the trash for good measure before handing it back.
Strange steepled his hands. “I can send one of you in, to try to convince him to return to the real world. You cannot drag him, he must return of his own volition. I must warn you that I have seen this spell cast twice before, and both times the afflicted never awoke, and in the second case the second person sent in was lost as well. If you spend too long in the dream world, it starts become more real and the spell adapts to include you as well. If people from your past start to show up, you must leave, whether you have convinced your friend to return or not. It is not a challenge for the faint of heart.”
Tony frowned and stopped inhaling the eggs. “Aww, baby. You’re actually upset.”
It cut to a close up shot of her face, the same way it had done for Tony’s redone lines in tonight’s broadcast. “Steve Rogers! Who graciously volunteered earlier this morning.”
“Jesus, Bucky. I can’t believe this is real.”
it go?
Tony swung a fist at him, and as Stane raised his arm to block the knife went skidding across the room. Stane lunged after it and Tony tackled him to the ground, feeling the knife skitter across his ribs as Stane slashed at him. Tony wrestled the knife away and held it to Stane’s throat, straddling his chest and keeping him pinned to the ground.
A chill ran through his body. The Capital could have decided that he was too much trouble and killed him off camera. Or they could have dumped him unconscious near another tribute who could have easily finished him off. Tony had no way of knowing if he was ok.
He had spent so many years trying to protect and care for Tony, maybe it was time to finally let down his shields enough to let Tony take care of him in return.
For a second something seemed to flash across Tony's face, before it was hidden behind a cocksure grin. “I'll take a dozen supermodels over you any day, birdbrain! You guys want to mope around while the party of the century happens the floor below, fine by me! DUM-E! Let's go, we've got chairs to move!” He strutted into the elevator with his robot following loyally, and with a whoosh they were gone again.
Steve sat up in bed, jolted awake. At first he thought he dreamt it, then it came again, louder. He hauled himself up from his bed and opened the door. It was too dark to see, but his wolf nose told him it was Tony. Once the door was open, Tony pushed past him to sit on his bed. He joined him, confused and disoriented. It didn’t help that Tony jumped into a question out of nowhere.
He had survived the fucking Hunger Games, like hell he was going to die back home from a knife an inch longer than his thumb. He advanced on Stane, fists raised.
“Less blood,” Steve said matter of fact, like he didn’t look absolutely wrecked.  “Last time your lip was split and you got blood in my mouth.”
“No!”
“I dyed it black too.”
“And you’re alright with it?” Bruce asked.
Tony passed his cell phone over and Steve started to dial from memory. “You remember how this all started? You trying to figure out what the symbol I drew was? It’s a shield. That’s the name of the rebellion, and I bet they’d like to know that you’re about to shut down all the Capital building’s defenses. They have people inside the city that could come help.”
Tony threw it as far as he could, curling up into a ball and covering his face. His clothes were soaked through, and his teeth were chattering so hard it hurt. Overhead there was another cannon blast. That made three. Tony forced himself back to his feet and kept searching through the woods, picking directions at random, lost in the blinding white. He stumbled upon the river. It was frozen solid, the only sign it was there a long dip in the height of the snow. Maybe Steve was in the cave? The one from the first day, where they had been safe and warm together. Tony waded through the snow upstream, searching for any dip or mound that might signal he was there. Another cannon sounded. Four. One left.
“No it doesn’t, don’t be a baby. We need to keep him, and more importantly, we want to keep him.” declared Clint.
“I didn’t say that,”
“Actually, that was the whole story. She still stops by in the summer when migrating. He's kind to animals, that's the point. I bet he's gotten Dottie out of that ditch a hundred times, easy. She's been getting in there every week since the fence broke.”
“Do you not want the jerky?”
Right now Tony was at his old place with Jan, having slept over at the Stark pack’s to avoid the bad luck of them seeing each other the morning before the wedding. Jan was there to make sure Tony made it there on time and presentable. If left to his own devices he quickly lost track of time and dates. Didn’t matter much on the ranch, not like the cows scheduled appointments. Steve knew he was gone on his fiancé because he found it charming that Tony got so invested in what he was doing he lost track of time, rather than annoying that he was always late for everything.
Over the next week Tony got the computer set up, and started working to develop his designs. He would sit at the table all day, and at nights when it was too dark to work on the ranch anymore, Steve would join him, sketching with his sweet sweet stolen bank pens.
“It wasn’t just you,” Steve interrupted.
“Might be,” Steve admitted, looking away.
“Steve! Are you ok? Hold tight, we’ll get you out.” Jan said. Hank grabbed the keys from the wall and unlocked the door to Steve’s cell. He moved to open Tony’s next and Steve stopped him.
“What did I say?” Steve smirked. Tony frowned down at the paper ball and Steve took pity on him. “Your feet are all wrong, that’s your problem.”
He collapsed to his hands and knees in the water, making desperate wheezing sounds. Tony watched from his cave, paralyzed. Outside the smoke grew thicker, filling the air with ashy grey haze. Inside the cave Tony was spared the worst of it, with entrance covered in sticks and the blanket keeping the smoke out, and clean cool air coming in through the inch wide gap over the water. Outside Steve climbed up the side of the stream bed like he was going to keep moving, then collapsed, his thin body wracked with coughs. The smoke was much worse higher up, and though Steve realized it, it was too late, and he didn’t have the breathe to climb back down. Within a few minutes he would be dead.
“What? Why not?”
“What if you did it in a new bowl, so if you mess up you won’t get egg shells everywhere?”
He put a hand on his shoulder and Steve welcomed the familiar weight, even if the concern was unnecessary. “Look, I'll start at the beginning. Things were a real mess for a while, with the bank. We were dead broke even before we had to get sell off half the cows and pay for repairs and funeral costs. We got pretty deep in the hole, and the bank was going to take the ranch. So, I made a deal with Obadiah Stane.”
“If you want to leave me, I’ll understand,” he offered.
Steve nodded and stepped back, gesturing Tony inside. It was a small room, with no furniture beyond a bed and dresser, so Tony sat on the bed and Steve joined him after closing the door. Tony half stood and sat down farther away, clearing his throat. Steve clasped his hands between his knees. Tony didn’t want to be close? That was fine. Not like they lived and slept together for four years or anything.
Steve took a deep breath. They had technically made it ten minutes this time, which was progress. But if he didn’t stop things here, he knew from experience that their conversation would continue to go further off the rails.
“You've never fed birds, Cap? I figured back in your day that was the only entertainment outside of watching paint dry.”
And an extra special thanks for everyone who has left me a comment or kudos! You guys are too sweet.
They all looked at him, confused. All four of them were werewolves, they knew this.
“A real underdog story, and a love story to boot. Our ratings were off the charts, people were tuning in every night to see you and Rogers.” Hammer jumped into his first question. “Tony, could you tell the crowd what your strategy was in the games?”
“Rebellion?”
Tony’s eyes shone with complete certainty. “I love you more for it.”
“Stop worrying then. And get over here, you can’t marry Tony with peanuts in your hair.”
“Jarvis?” Steve asked dumbly. Tony had a couple small photos pinned to a tactboard in the back of his lab alongside semantics for phones and planes. There was a picture cut from a magazine of a young Tony crouched near DUM-E, a picture of the two of them at a press event also cut from a magazine, and finally a tattered polaroid of this very man along with two women standing next to Tony at graduation.
Steve smiled. “Yeah. Me too. That doesn’t mean there’s not still room for you. Stay and sleep with me?”
When he got off the plane Pepper was not happy. She shook her phone at him. “I have received six calls from your public relations team because you are not picking up your phone.”
Steve frowned. Tony needed to shift. Now off the drugs, he was giving off all the signs, his nails and teeth unconsciously sharpening when he was upset, being more restless, more impatient.
“You haven't thought about whether you’re romantically interested in your smoking hot fiancé? Have you even noticed him? Do you even swing that way?”
Tony didn’t know if he’d go that far, he was still a Capital citizen in his mind, but he didn’t want to get stabbed so he nodded along with whatever Steve said. The group seemed to accept it and the tension bled out of the air, the matter was settled for the time being. Steve lead them forward to continue the search for Thor, and Tony took two steps forward and stumbled. His ankle was still hot and swollen, and had stiffened up overnight to the point of being almost useless. Steve caught his arm and lowered him to the ground, Tony trying and failing to hide his wince of pain. The group didn’t want him there as it was, if they thought he was going to slow them down then they would leave him, or worse, kill him. Steve felt around Tony’s ankle, leaving his boot on. Tony couldn’t hold in a small gasp of pain.
“Let him in.” Stane yelled through the door.
“Hmmm. That's nice to hear.”
And now he looked at Tony, and just knew. Knew that no matter what shit he got himself into, Tony’d be half a step behind pulling him out. He knew that on bad days he’d be the one beside him, coaxing and laughing and teasing until Steve could finally take a clear breath. And Steve realized that he could do the same thing for him, and was prepared to do it everyday for the rest of his life if necessary because he didn’t think he could ever bear to go a day without Tony’s smile. So he held him close as he chose, Tony's heart fluttering lightly under his arms, as he picked a ring. And as Steve got down on a knee, to slip a cherry ring pop onto Tony's finger in a supermarket parking lot, he finally labeled that feeling. The give and take, the trust, the knowing that this was Tony, his beautiful, impossible, perfectly imperfect Tony, the only thing he could call it was is love.
Steve kissed him and Tony responded eagerly, almost desperately, trying to bury himself in all the tiny mundane details that meant Steve was alive and real, the beat of his heart under Tony’s hand, Steve’s own hands dragging down Tony’s back. Blond eyelashes pale and fine resting against cheeks flushed pink and healthy.
“I'm fine, thank you for asking. How are you?” Steve responded. He always tried to be polite, no matter if Tony was wearing on his nerves.
“I never have regrets.” Tony laughed, and he tilted his head back to squirt the hot sauce sauce directly on his tongue. Immediately his mouth caught on fire and his eyes filled with tears. “Shit.”
“And secondly, I need a computer.”
Tony confirmed and ignored Steve to continue swiping away the birds. This wasn’t really engaging the enemy, right? He wasn't fighting, he was waving his arms around. No way Steve could blame him for that.
A sham of a wolf like Stane would walk away, ignoring the traditional wolf challenge. Tony hesitated, stiff as a board as he watched Steve pace back and forth in front of him. As a wolf Steve could smell his fear, hanging thick and bitter in the air. Tony backed up until he was trapped in the corner of the basement, hands held up defensively as he trembled. Maybe he was surprised by the size of Steve's wolf? Or maybe the city folk didn't shift as much, with no where to run around. Didn't matter. Steve growled at him, an inarticulate “Fight me!”
He spent the rest of the night with his eyes half closed, staring out through a gap in the branches for any movement. The haze of the smoke gradually cleared, and the world lightened with the artificial sun. Tony hadn’t realized that he had fallen asleep until he woke up to the sound of water splashing, and bright light hitting his face as the branches were ripped away from the entrance of the cave. It was the deadly knife girl.
This seemed familiar, though he couldn’t remember from where. He felt his head loll and Steve forced him to maintain eye contact. His eyes were wet. “Please, let us in.”
He squeezed him tight and let go, laying back down on his bed. To his surprise, Tony laid down with him, resting a hand on his chest.
Tony blinked at him. “Right, actually this might take a while, you better just go on without me.”
“I’m not back.”
“And that’s the problem, because I like you very much. More than I should.” Steve spoke so softly and earnestly, and Tony could hardly bear it.
“That is true for many here, and yet we still listen for your command. We all missed the rot festering under our very noses inside the castle. Loki is sly beyond the means of normal men, and it is no sin to assume the best of others.”
A few moments later Jan knocked on the window with gentle concern. He didn’t look up, and after a minute she went away. He sat in the car for what felt like hours, thinking in circles. There was no way to get the money in time. They were screwed. He had failed his family traditions, hundreds of years of legacies, his Ma, his pack. They had three weeks before they lost everything. Where would they go? What would they do? They had lived on the ranch their whole lives, they didn’t know how to do anything besides raise milk cows. None of them had a highschool education. They were home schooled before that, to limited success. Best thing to do would be to take ‘em out back and put ‘em down.
In this chapter, Steve mopes and tries to get his life together. Secrets are shared and a plan is made.
And Steve looked him over, and noticed that his normally neat clothes were all wrinkled up, and his hair was fluffy instead of slicked back and no one had seen his since the previous day. Last time they had talked Tony he had been going to spend time with Britain for a reason he wouldn’t say. Steve’s mind finally put it all together.
“Lost it.”
The next day they reached the outskirts of the city surrounding the caste. The rebels made camp, and Steve and Tony prepared themselves to enter the city. They both donned simple but well made clothes that would allow them to blend in as traveling sawbones, with Tony’s medicine bag clearly displayed. People were always in need of medical help, and as they approached the gate they had no problem being welcomed into the city through the large outer gates. Once inside they worked their way through the winding streets up to the secondary gates of the castle. Night had fallen, which allowed them to get close without the guards who paced the top of the gates seeing them. They stood underneath the eaves until the guard's footsteps faded, then Steve boosted Tony up so he could grab the top of the wall and pull himself up. Once on top he reached down and pulled Steve up beside him. They walked along the wall until they reached the first catapult, and Tony knelt down to loosen the bolts. Steve kept careful watch for approaching guards. Tony was done in minutes and they moved on to the next one. There were four in total, and they were on the last one before the guard finished his rounds of the back wall and made his way around to the front. Steve gestured at Tony to hurry, and stepped in front, blocking him from view as best as he could.
“There you are, thank God. I need you to keep your eyes open for me, alight?”
“Shush! Steven! Do you want to know the secret or not?”
Thank you for reading! I'm trying a new way of getting formatting so let me now if anything looks weird.
“I need to talk to Obie!”
Tony shifted and before Steve could stop him he jumped on his former guardian, snarling and biting. Stane let out a gurgling laugh and knocked Tony across the room, where he hit the wall with a thud and lay still. In a second Steve was shifted and his suit fell off him in tatters. He charged at Stane, Bucky right behind him, leaping up. Even the weight of two full grown wolves was not enough to bring Stane down as he continued to grow, and he swiped them off with a snarl. Steve rolled across the floor and quickly regained his feet. He saw Clint and Jan preparing to shift and he ran over to them, grabbing Jan’s sleeve in his teeth and dragging her towards Tony. They got the idea and ran to help the downed wolf, which kept them safely out of Stane’s path.
“They’re gone. He has an aunt and he says she’s supportive of it, as long as it doesn’t affect his school work or get him into any situation he can’t get out of. I made him a kevlar version of his spider suit and put something in there to alert me if he’s in trouble so he’s safer now than he was before.”
“Sir does as he pleases, Captain.”
“And what if you do? It’ll eat you!”
“Hey Tony, since you took it apart and all, is there any chance that you could fix it yourself?”
“I might be able to fix that.”
“She's exploring the ditch first. You can't go straight from the ranch to somewhere like Paris, you gotta start small. She's setting realistic goals for herself, that's commendable.”
The ride back to the ranch was dead silent. Jan and Tony sat in the truck, Jan driving with her usual careful regard for speed limits and the rules of the road in general. Tony was sulking. There was no other word for it, it was just a good old, straight out sulk. Steve and Clint sat in the bed, holding down the eight massive suitcases Tony had insisted on bringing. Clint kept his head down, watching the yellow dashes on the road tick by. And Steve… Steve wanted to cry, but that sure wasn't an option, so instead he shoved it all down, until all that was left was small angry part of him yelling that this wasn't fair, he didn't want this. Then he shoved that down too. It didn't matter if he was happy or not. This would help his pack, so he had to do it. He had made an agreement with Stane that Tony would stay with him from now on, to get used to things before they tied the knot. The wedding would be in a few months, which was the soonest they could have it while maintaining the level of opulence and class associated with the Stark pack. Steve’s ma had gotten married under the grapevine trellis out back in her Sunday best, but apparently that wasn't good enough for the Starks’. They needed ‘venues’ and special wedding specific dresses and three tier cakes, and those things took time. Steve just wanted to get it over and done with. His pack needed this, therefore he would do it. He had no clue what Tony's motivations were. After he had raged at him for a few minutes while he hid inside the car like a frightened pup and Clint laughed his ass off in the back, Stane had come outside and pulled Tony aside to talk. They talked for about a half hour, Tony with his arms tightly crossed. Jan was right, crossed arms did look hostile. For being maybe 5’6”, Tony radiated a whole lot of menace. Finally whatever Stane said convinced Tony, because he marched back inside, and returned an hour later with eight enormous suitcases.
“Thanks for the save, Cap,” he coughed, trying to get his breath back.
Steve was pleased and unsurprised to be getting his way, that jerk. “Let's get a move on before these birds destroy every window in the city.”
“I’m sorry I touched your mini versions, the rule is no touching, I get the picture, now let me go!” Tony struggled against the talons as the bird flew high into the sky.
Steve had been in the room for thirty seconds and was already ready to throw down with Tony again. Patience, he told himself. Don’t fight.
Another shot barely missed him and hit a car which violently exploded, sending civilians screaming and covering as Natasha tried to usher them away while fighting off more men. The sound made his ears ring, and he barely missed being hit again. He threw a man into another man and punched the third. The fourth slammed the barrel of his gun into Steve’s back and he fell. As soon as he hit the ground he swept a leg out, knocking the man down before bouncing back to his feet and finishing him with a blow to the head. He fought his way forward, trying to keep the militia away from the innocents, and inadvertently separating himself from the rest of the team. Natasha tried to yell something at him over the noise of the battle. Even with his enhanced hearing, she wasn’t getting through.
