Tony’s knees hit the ground with a sick-sounding
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay,” Rhodey says, smirking.
Tony sways, even with Steve holding him, and Steve ushers him to the couch and sits him down before turning towards the kitchen.
“Picked her myself,” Natasha says.
“Nope,” Tony says, laughs. “First time for everything. Thanks for sharing this moment with me.”
Sam’s looking at him now, and he's still smiling, but it’s a little sad too.
And he means it.
“So sweet of you,” Tony said and didn’t bother telling Steve it really wasn’t necessary. Steve grabbed one and herded Tony into the elevator ahead of him.
Because, yes, he really does read the transcripts FRIDAY puts together of Peter’s “reports” to Happy.
“I’m—”
Scott got to the scene first, and then Tony only seconds later.  The rest of the Avengers are still a few minutes out, so Scott and Tony do a flyover and start relaying observations to everyone. They look frankly disgusting, but that information isn’t particularly helpful. He sees what looks like a National Guard member caught in an alien’s grip, trashing and struggling, and Tony’s about to swoop in when the man goes still and limp—only for the alien to go down, hard, loosening its grip as it starts to writhe in pain. There, across the street, the cop that just shot the thing cleanly in the eye. The National Guard officer rolls swiftly away from the dying alien.
“Sleep,” Tony tells him, calm and soft.
Tony takes a deep breath, holds it.
“Christ on a bike,” Steve says.
“Mostly to go to bed,” he says, “but also to make sure you’re alright.”
“FRIDAY, what’ve we got?”
It’s a reassurance, though, that Tony’s not the only one a little invested here, not the only one taking a series of tiny leaps of faith, hoping he’s not getting it wrong.
The reply takes a couple minutes this time:
“Steve,” he says gently, brushing his fingers through his hair again. “Hey, hey, easy.”
“Did I die?” Tony asks. He means it as a joke, but, “Sorry, that’s not funny. But seriously, you look like you’re planning a funeral all the way over there.”
It’s not that he’s not trying hard enough, it’s just that nothing works.
“This isn’t a therapy session and I’m not looking to turn it into one. The results of that were a lot of pointing fingers and blame and vindication, and I think we’ve come to find that that’s not how this team survives.”
“Copy,” Steve says, and he sounds grim, like he understands the implications of what Tony just said.
“Tony,” Steve says again, jaw clenched and shoulders square like he’s ready for a fight, and Tony tells himself it’s not a physical fight, calm down a little maybe, “what’s going on?”
“Night, guys,” Tony says to the living room. Natasha smiles like she’s in on the biggest joke in history and Clint pulls his beer bottle away from his mouth so he can offer a silent
He sets up camp down in the shop. There’s a couch, new but stained in places, and while he doesn’t sleep in his bed, he does sleep. And eat. But mostly he works. And talks. When Sam texts him, he texts back. When Clint calls, he picks up and tells the Barton children very seriously that, yes, he and Daddy have made up, that they’re friends again, that they can probably let Dad into the house now. Steve sends a text that reads
Bucky just watches him in response. After another couple minutes of discomfort and Steve trying not to squirm, Bucky looks up at something above Steve’s head. The nurse, if he had to guess.
Steve steps forward, sweetly smirking, and it’s the kind of idiotic contradiction—
“Sit down,” Natasha says, and moves him to a seat with a good view of everyone and everything.
Tony’s opening his mouth to say more—probably to explain the ambulance and where they’re going—when they turn out of the park and onto a real street, and Steve’s entire face screws up. He swallows two, three times, and then one of the paramedics is pulling Tony away and she and another maneuver Steve onto his side in time for him to not choke on his own puke.
The thought’s like a shot of espresso. He needs to see everything, catalogue it, not waste this—second, third, eighty-sixth—chance.
“Yeah,” he sighs. “We’re gonna need to take the suit off carefully.”
“Done.”
“Latverian design, in the robotics and the clothing,” Tony pants, firing a repulsor. “And they keep mentioning Doom. I thought they meant the concept, but it’s the name—”
haha if y'all thought i wasn't going to address the Issue Of Wanda or tony's health re: chest pains then you were sadly mistaken
“I’m going to fuck it up,” Tony had told him, eyes big and scared and hopeful. “I’m going to be gone too much for business and forget to come to bed and I’ll talk during the best parts of movies and—well, I probably won’t forget your birthday. Or, maybe I will, but c’mon, the Fourth of July? God, I’m probably going to forget your
Tony scoff-laughs, and Sam just looks thoughtful.
Tony snorts because they both know this song and dance by now.
He feels—a lot of things, saying those words out loud. Vindicated, ashamed, righteous,
Instead, that night, Howard had talked softly about how sometimes you have to do unpleasant things or deal with unpleasant people, and no amount of preparation will make you any more ready. About how sleep doesn’t always feel right or seem feasible, and instead of honey tea he works on the cars. Any activity with idle contemplation of the mechanism that keeps his hands busy, really, but the cars work the best. All of this was confessed lowly as Howard made adjustments to the engine, and afterwards, he’d stared silently for a moment as Tony watched this strange nighttime version of his father, until Howard pulled over a stepstool—picking it up and moving it rather than his usual drag across the concrete floor to avoid the unnecessary noise lest Maria skin both their hides—to let Tony climb up and see the specifics.
The others come to join them. Sam stumbles when he lands, but peels the goggles off his head like he’s relieved to have them off, and leans against an overturned car. T’Challa flips over the back of the car, still light on his feet but hunched over ever so slightly. Sam side-eyes T’Challa but moves over so they can both lean. Wanda’s limping, has a black eye and a cut on her cheek, but she’s firmly upright. Clint’s trembling, just barely, holding himself stiffly. He’s taken hard hits, and Steve’s worried about the internal damage he might have. Tony still hasn’t lifted his faceplate, which is strange, but not the weirdest thing to happen today. He looks a little eerie when he lands, like he’s maybe holding himself unnaturally. He sure hadn’t sounded great when they’d been trapped under that building. Neither had Steve, though, he’s sure.
“’Course.”
The moment feels heavy, like they’re balancing on the edge of a precipice and neither of them makes that final step, but neither of them wants to go backwards. Or—Tony doesn’t. Maybe he’s just projecting.
Tony touches down next to Steve for a while; they fight as flawlessly as they ever have despite the haunted look on Steve’s face and the way Tony can’t stop shaking inside the armor, only overlapping adrenaline rushes keeping him upright. They don’t talk beyond strategy, but Tony thinks he can read some of his own conflicting feelings in Steve’s body language; the relief at being a united front again, the horror at having to kill things that used to be people, the trust to have each other’s backs.
FRIDAY would be okay with this too, Tony’s sure. She’ll have to know—there are things here that she’s going to have to help him with. They might even need to design a smarter armor if they want to pull this off, one that can not only analyze his fighting style but emulate it against hostiles. That’s the second step after he figures out the code and sets the parameters.
He never seriously considered that Steve might be the same way, not for anyone other than Bucky. Maybe that was wrong of him.
Instinct tells Tony to backtrack, to change the subject before they go too far down that road and someone says something stupid. But they’re here to talk.
“Fine,” Tony says, though he’s not happy about it.
“Yeah,” Steve says. They don’t have as much food as Steve could eat, as they always had at the tower or the compound, but it’s enough to keep him healthy. He thinks he might’ve lost some weight, but he doesn’t know how much of that is due to their lack of resources and how much is because he keeps forgetting to eat. “I’m okay. Sam’s with me, it’s just the two of us.”
His CEO, he tells himself. She doesn’t belong to him like That, not anymore.
“Uh,” Peter says, looking back and forth between Tony and the popped hood. “Theoretically? I mean—in a technical way, yeah, but I’ve never really…what kinda car is this? It’s amazing!”
“That’s promising. Can’t murder a man through the phone, far as I know.”
This all ends in him having a relatively low-key panic attack in the middle of the ‘shop.
Steve’s typing bubble disappears after that, pauses, and begins again for all of five seconds.
“It’s not so much density,” Bruce says thoughtfully. “Actually, based on some of the research, the space between my—the Hulks atoms gets bigger too when I’m—him. They’re just held together with gamma-addled bonds.”
“You’re dying,” she says bluntly.
Steve scoffs in a way that suggests actual offense at the statement.
He feels ill, and he finally understands why Pepper left him. It’s not at all a lack of love, which is what he’s always quietly suspected.
It’s not especially late, not even by normal human standards, meaning it’s obscenely early for Tony. Laying down here with Steve is nice, and the darkness around them is nice, of course, it’s all a blanket of security and reassurance and freedom, but even in the wake of his—outburst, he wouldn’t necessarily say he’s sleep ready. It was a bit of an abrupt shift, not that it’s exactly surprising, given the conversation that led them here, but he feels jarred nonetheless.
“Steve?” he whispers. “Steve, it’s okay, you’re okay.”
“So,” he says, sitting down with his own mug. “The plates in the shoulder are too wide, it’s gonna fuck the entire range of motion.”
The bustle of people everywhere is almost overwhelming with Extremis in play. Only nearly, though. He can tell it would be easier to become overwhelmed like this, that panic might be a certain percentage more intense, but he thinks he can learn to exist within it, the same way he has at the compound. It’ll take some getting used to, just another reason to come down to the city more. Exposure therapy, or something.
(Sue him, it’s the Fourth of July, okay?) In his head, a voice that sounds like both Tony and Bucky laughs at him, and isn’t that just depressing.
Vision’s smirk gets bigger and Tony suddenly has grand plans to deep clean the entire hangar.
“No, I.” Tony pauses, looks to the side and then back again. “Never mind, it’s nothing to worry about, but I’m not trying to be a dick about this. Really. Thanks for the ride.”
“It’s a long story, but I really am alive,” Tony says, and smiles when he catches Steve’s eye. “Promise. Just breathe, ’kay?”
“You latch on to the nearest redhead,” she says. “You wouldn't even be saying that if Pepper was here.”
baseline humans.”
"A little more than okay,” Steve echoes, and he’s smiling softly up at the sky when Tony glances over.
He’s got FRIDAY fully installed but not uploaded yet. All he has to do is flip a switch and she’ll be live, in his private space again. To keep him on an even keel, to hold him accountable. And Tony just…he’s not stupid and he knows it’s not a sustainable way to live, but he doesn’t really want to face anyone else yet. And he knows—he
“How much did you have to pay ‘em to sign, eh, Stark?” a man will say. Tony thinks they might’ve done business together at some point.
“Okay,” Tony says, and he can feel his brow scrunch up in confusion. “We feel what we feel, I guess. That’s—uh. Valid?”
“We weren’t, though,” he points out, suddenly adamant she understand that, believe it. “Not until—Chicago? Or. Maybe the Accords signing? No, definitely Chicago. But never while you and I—not even after, for a long time, I swear, I wouldn’t—”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, and it feels wrong, like battery acid in the back of his throat, like some combination of
“Hey, you don’t have to tell me twice,” Bruce says, already backing away. “Your doctor will be in shortly.”
“Is that even legal?” he says, but it’s musing rather than serious. God knows most of the things the Avengers get up to on a daily basis aren’t legal for the rest of the population, including parts of their existence (hence the Accords, but that’s not the point).
“We’ll escort the remaining Brood back down and through their portal,” Steve says. “Does anyone need—?”
“After Loki,” Steve says, “I thought I finally had you nailed down, but I honestly. I really don’t know how I came to the conclusion that your weight was so much more than anyone else’s. Than mine, even when I thought I was the natural leader of the group.”
“I keep thinking,” Bruce says, and that’s a sentence that never ends well for Tony, so he sighs and, to hide the way his shoulders slump, he rides the movement and sits on the edge of the bed, by Bruce’s hip, his elbows on his knees and his eyes on the ground. “If I’d been here when the Accords were proposed—and I just keep goin’ in circles, Tony. I don’t know what I would’ve done.”
It seems so out of left field that Tony has to take a minute to untangle the meaning of the words, and even after he’s done that he still feels like he’s taken a wrong turn somewhere.
“You keep saying that,” Steve says, still just as sad but with a raised eyebrow. Part of it grates on Tony, but mostly it reassures him that he’s not fucking up this whole communication thing too badly. There’s an edge to his voice now, pushing, demanding, but not necessarily angry.
DUM-E whirs his claw from the far side of the workshop (where he’s been wisely avoiding Tony and his jittery energy for the better part of an hour now), and starts rolling over.
“Okay,” she says.
“Clint,” Steve says, low and forcibly calm, “let him speak.”
like their friendship. Probably both, maybe something else entirely.
There’s really nowhere left to sit by the time he and Steve get everything distributed, so they sit cross-legged in front of the coffee table, and it’s surprising to Tony how little it physically hurts (as in: not at all). His joints don't ache when he folds himself down onto the floor, and maybe it’s not the most comfortable place, but it’s so incredibly easy.
“A natural leader,” Steve says again, quietly. There’s less acid in the words, but he still looks mad, just—deflated too.
“What, exactly, was I right about?” Bruce asks again.
Everyone’s getting therapy. They’ve got eight solid finalists in the running, and everyone can meet with any of the eight. (Plus a few more options on the backburner, just in case.) Doctor-patient confidentiality exists still, and will only be waived if and only if an Avenger becomes a danger to themselves or others or are deemed unfit for combat. (In which case, one of the original members will be notified—only of the change of status from field ready to unfit for combat, not why.)
“Food,” Rhodey says.
“No, no, no,” Scott’s saying. “It’s the concentration of mass that makes me stronger the smaller I get. The absolute density of my atoms jacks them up, but the Hulk—”
Tony agrees with her still, distantly and bitterly, though his ears ring slightly when she gives voice to it. There’s enough bitterness in the room already, he’s half afraid bringing theirs into the fold will really start a fire.
“We’re gonna put on a movie, I think,” Steve says with his stupidly sad eyes, looking like Tony’s just hurt him or some shit. It makes him want to growl and hiss, but he can see the effort Steve’s putting in here. Why now, he wants to ask. Why put in so much effort now when he put in barely any before the Accords? When Tony’s mouth opens again, it’s just as automatic as the last reply.
Steve gets Tony leaning against him and puts a hand in his boyfriend’s hair, combing out the knots and working out the clumps of what might be motor oil, even if it is a little gross. Tony picks a piece of pineapple off the pizza and pops it in his mouth after drinking half the first bottle of Gatorade. Steve really, really hopes he plans to eat more than just the pineapple, but he’s not going to press the issue right now.
Sam looks back down at the tablet before balancing it on the arm of his chair.
“No,” Tony says, “there’s no green. Just blue, I swear to God. And my vision has recently improved by a factor of about ten. I’m a color
“Yeah, well,” Tony says, and he’s tense now, too, even though neither of them seem to be on the verge of yelling anymore. Tenser for it, probably. “I don’t actually want to murder any of my friends or coworkers.”
This, unfortunately, is the thing that captures her attention. Wanda’s head whips around and she stares, hot and fiery, at Tony, who’s frozen on the spot.
“Not without your tag team partner we’re not,” Tony says. Steve blinks hard—close, open—like a flinch. “I’m not looking for a fight. Just leave.”
Steve blinks. He registers that Hulk’s growling before he can register who he’s growling at, and for a moment he thinks they’re going to have to start fighting all over again because Hulk offended their queen. But it’s not the alien he’s glaring at; it’s Tony.
“I know,” Steve says. “And I’m not—being rash about this. I really do know. It has to be different or this is never going to work.”
She tames her expression as she looks down at her phone, typing, a closed-mouth curl of lips that looks no less like that cat that got the canary.
“Christ, what are we? Five years old?”
“Great.”
“Technically, I suppose. That depends on how you look at it.” Tony rolls his eyes at the superior smile on Vision’s face. Who gave this guy so much confidence in the first place? He sure as hell doesn’t get it from Tony.
“Yeah,” she says, sounding a little dazed, “okay.”
He opens his mouth, pauses. Blinks twice, snaps his jaw shut.
“Yeah,” Tony admitted, and he struggled to sit up on his own, but this chair really wasn’t meant for two people. He really must’ve been out; the rest of the team was already gone. “Sorry about decimating team night. I tried.”
“Sounds like a pretty good gift, coming from Stark,” Sam says.
“Please,” Sam says. “Steve’s not the only one who regrets the way things went down.”
“That’s the idea,” Steve says.
Tony rolls and performs a half-acrobatic move that frees the sheets. He lands underneath them, on his side facing Steve, one arm folded underneath his head. Still smiling and looking like he’s trying not to, Steve picks up one of the pillows from where they’re both stacked and flips it so it falls on Tony’s face as he crawls under the covers. By the time Tony has the pillow in place Steve’s settled. They’re facing each other, barely a foot between them.
“I’m not trying to—this isn’t some sort of designed punishment,” Tony says, and it comes out stern, almost confident.
Don’t get used to it, he tells himself. Keep watch.
“I—feel good,” Tony says, meeting her eyes again and wondering why that sentence makes him feel so guilty. “Extremis is nothing short of lovely.”
“Fri, snap a pic of this,” he says.
“Huh,” he says. Then, shaking himself out a little, “Yeah, I suppose.”
“Technically,” Steve says, “you made the right call. That doesn’t mean it didn’t make me sick to learn about it, or that the worry hasn’t been eating me alive.”
“Hey, my sweet little cherubs,” Clint says, “we’ve got some strays at the northwest corner of the street. One of you wanna wrangle ‘em back in?”
“So what you’re saying is,” Tony wrinkles his nose, “there’s nothing for me to do, right now, immediately at this moment, to fix everything.”
And then the questions had started, and isn’t that where it always goes to shit?
“This part’s beyond me,” Bruce says. “I’ve told them everything they’ll need for the Extremis. All I’m doing is making the doctors nervous.”
“I was just…after how you left, when I woke up. I wasn’t sure, you needed to know…”
“Yeah,” Tony says, which—eloquent. When he speaks again, his voice comes out soft, only loud enough to travel the distance it needs to go to get to Steve’s ears. “Don’t think we’d get much say, anyway. There’s a lot we can do, but biblical locales might be the hard limit there.”
“Technically, yes, that’s all I called for,” Steve says in a rush. “But now I’m trying to say something else so please don’t hang up.”
in there, something about how Tony refuses to be the Kate Winslet in this scenario, or, hell, even something about how that would just be a bonus for Clint if he really were to jump, but none of the words are coming out, and the silence has gone on for too long and now he’s not even sure if he—
“What did you tell him?” Steve asks, leaning forward so that he can see Natasha around Sam. Natasha smiles at him, but it’s more sardonic than amused.
Maybe he imagines her faintly glowing too. (He doesn’t think so.)
thanks are in order, as always, to the solid, fantastic, lovely
“Jesus Christ,” Clint says, hushed but not a whisper. Annoyed? Exasperated. And then, as an afterthought, “Hey.”
A little while later Tony gets an idea for a new comm interface from an insult hurled onscreen and starts to multitasks. He flips the HUD glasses down from where they’re resting on top of his head and uses the visual tracking to make notes while still watching middle-aged women throw drinks on each other.
He breathes, seeks out Steve’s gaze, holds both eyes and air, for just a moment.
They order Thai food and drink root beer because Rhodey’s a normal human being like that.
The point is that Barnes decides he will come to America, to New York, to the Avengers compound. Barnes has decided that the BARF tech might help him in the future, but it’s too soon for him to try that yet (Tony grudgingly agrees with him). He’s starting with sit-down-and-talk therapy, and Tony has to admit he’s rather impressed by that choice. Stupidly, Tony hopes this is the final push that convinces Steve to get his own shrink.
He’d forgotten to grab the HUD glasses on his way out of his room, and his mind definitely wanders, but with most of the floor still dark and most people in the compound either asleep or too far away for him to hear, he manages to follow the plot of the movie and, even more miraculous still, to relax against Steve’s side. Half the movie passes and they only move to readjust their positions, Tony kicking his socked feet up onto the couch, leaning his head back against Steve’s chest, and Steve moving his hand to rest lightly on Tony’s chest. The weight of it, of them, Steve-and-Tony, of Sokovia and Leipzig and Siberia and Chicago, of the Tower and Malibu and the apple orchard, they all press down around Tony as he feels Steve’s hand pressing so carefully against his own chest.
“Okay,” he says, “I’ll bite. What am I, then?”
And Tony is, quite frankly, sick of this. Frustrated and angry, even if he gets it a little bit. This is not a logical argument from Bruce, and it’s barely masquerading as one. His anger is probably just overlaying fear. There’s a lot Bruce does to cope with the reality of his life, and a lot of it would be deemed terrifying by a mental health professional.
He grins, she raises an eyebrow, and Tony feels like they’re solidly back on their feet. They order at the counter—cappuccino, a cup of sweet potato soup, and spring salad for Pepper, and some sandwich with onions and apples for Tony.
“Morning,” Tony chirps and, holy shit, did this technovirus make him into a
“Wonderful,” Sam says.
“Whatever,” Clint said. “You don’t get any food.”
“I wanna be,” he says. He’s not looking Tony in the eyes and that, more than anything, convinces Tony that he’s being sincere. Steve’s almost as shit at emotions as Tony himself. “We were, for a while there. Or we were on our way. And.” Steve leans a hand on the counter and his eyes flicker to Tony. “I miss it—you. I miss you being around.”
“Kid?” he says. “Talk to me.”
“Guys,” Clint says, right as the thunder sounds, just about drowning him out. Tony tunes in, though. There’s something about Clint’s tone, something different. Still cautious and weary and pained, but there’s an urgency to it, a hope they haven’t heard in hours. Clint doesn’t say anything else, though.
Steve walks through the living area and is angled like he’s going to bypass the kitchen too, so Tony reaches out and grabs the back of his suit jacket. Steve pauses, so Tony tugs firmly, and Steve turns. Tony lets go and steps back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And…mark!” he says. The red energy dissipates, and Tony steps forward as quickly as he can. He gets his arms around its torso and suddenly has the thing in a full nelson. Wanda takes a faltering step towards them, holds her outstretched hands closer together, and starts spooling out energy that wisps towards the thing’s head. It throws its head back, but it doesn’t connect, just narrowly missing Tony’s nose. The tail reaches up, but it’s not designed to reach its own back, probably a defense against sticking itself with the stinger. It takes a few seconds, but the tentacles start snaking backwards, alien flesh and ribbons of human arms clinging on. They wind up around Tony’s arms, around his neck. He knows Wanda’s working as fast as she can, that begging her to hurry up will only slow her down, but then the tentacles start squeezing like a python, and alerts start flashing red on the HUD.
“Only if you’re already making some,” Bucky says, and Tony nods, taking a route to the kitchen that lets him keep Bucky in his periphery almost the whole time.
Steve grins, and it hurts. He’s just spilling his guts down the line, no big deal. He will admit, it’s easier when they’re not face-to-face
“Sure,” Tony says, “of course you do. That’s the problem.”
“Wait,” Scott says, “you have smoothie-making robots here?”
Tony does, however, angle his body slightly toward Wanda and Vision.
“Really?” Tony asks, squinting. Bruce grins.
“Are you okay?” Tony asks. “What’s going on? What’s wrong?”
“I’m not keeping anyone here,” Tony says to the room at large, taking a pointed look around. Natasha and Clint, for now looking relaxed and watchful, unbothered; Wanda, ramrod straight in her seat, meets his eyes with her head mostly ducked before glancing back at Clint; Sam, tenser than Clint or Nat, mouth set and determined; Vision, serene and contemplative; Rhodey, hand resting over his mouth, brow creased as things play out; Peter, the most visibly freaked-out, looking distinctly like he wants to help somehow but is hopelessly out of his depth; Steve, strung tight enough to snap between his jaw and shoulders, fists clenched, disappointment distinct in the twitching of the vein in his forehead; Bucky, awkwardly trying to hunch over like it’ll somehow make him smaller; Thor, who’s sometimes hard to read and who’s been almost astonishingly quiet so far in the meeting, frowning thoughtfully; and Scott, mildly twitchy and doing his best to hide it. Tony lets his mind catalogue even as he continues speaking.
“Right,” Sam says, “meeting. Ugh. Just another reason I should be asleep right now.”
“Well, you see,” Steve says, the frown disappearing under an unsure smile, “I don’t sleep as often as most people. Which I suppose you don’t either, now. But. Three days without feeling tired is pushing it, even for me.”
“Yeah, hi. The kid from Queens, right?”
“No,” Steve says quietly. “I don’t protect people any more than you do. And you know it.”
It’s so nice to have Clint on his side again he can almost forget to pretend to resent it.
The issue is—what, exactly? The fact that Steve needed months and hundreds of thousands of miles between them and the Accords to admit he might not have handled it perfectly? Does Tony really think Steve’s going to default back to cruelty and secrets the second that’s more convenient?
“Breakfast.”
But Tony’s already doubled over, vomiting onto the ground between his sneakers. He has enough sense to hold the phone away from his face while he pukes, down by his hip. He spits when he’s done (whatever, he’s going to have to clean the floor anyway), moves the phone back to his ear, and stumbles a couple steps back from the mess.
This is—the opposite. Only a few seconds pass before Sam walks by, leaving a full box of Margherita in his hands with a comment about ‘babysitting payment’ on his way to sit with Clint and Vision.
Exactly one month after the pardons have been issued (because of course he goes through with it), the world almost ends again. This is when the rest of the (no longer technically rogue) Avengers show up and they kick ass and take names and it’s glorious up until they’ve actually won and then it’s just…horrendously awkward.
“You’ll never win if you always bet on Natasha,” Steve points out, like it’s been written into a script for him. Tony smiles, easy. This is always the easy stuff, the lighthearted words that make him feel like he belongs. He knows better now—
That isn't, strictly speaking, ideal. There are some non-original members of the team—Sam and Rhodey, maybe even Scott—that Tony thinks deserve to get turns as acting chairperson, but this was an easier line to draw, more natural and less exclusionary. Besides, Rhodey’s still a military man, technically, and busy more often than not.
With one last, forlorn look at the clock, Steve flings the blankets off his legs, gets out of bed, and stretches.
is Steve’s immediate reply. Tony just stares at it, and then he stares at it some more. Tony wouldn’t love to. In fact, the idea of meeting up specifically to talk fills him with absolute dread. Then again, so does the idea of never talking to Steve again. And the idea of continuing like this, faking friendship until it’s real for fleeting moments just to feel it all shatter all over again? He can’t do that.
Steve watches him evenly for a few seconds, and then tilts his head.
“What’s that supposed to—” Peter says, loud and panicked.
Steve even proposes a forum now, to get them caught up. A setting in which the “core members,” referring to the original six, could discuss the standing membership of everyone who’s been added to the roster. Tony shoots that down pretty fast. He sees where Steve’s coming from, but that would do nothing except freak everyone out.
There are aliens in Chicago. The aliens have apparently been working with humans on the ground to gain inside intel for months. And by “humans on the ground” he means gang members and all of their corrupt friends in high places. And, Christ, Chicago’s a mess. A horribly cliche, predictable mess somebody should’ve seen coming. But that’s not a problem for the Avengers; their problem is the giant bug alien things who’ve already started killing people on the ground, even as they try to take over the city. They’re a parasitic species, according the brief Maria Hill sent over, and they lay their eggs in human-sized hosts. The term “raping and pillaging” comes to mind.
“Alright.”
“Man, I knew Captain America would be a jackass,” Rhodey tells him. They’re eating in the living room, watching reality TV because apparently that’s what Rhodey’s up to these days. (Tony’s never going to let him live it down, never.)
“Where’s Mr. Stark?” she asks Iron Man. No response comes from the suit, and a ball of dread settles heavily in Steve’s gut. “Open the armor!”
Then the arm around his waist spasms and he thinks, ah.
The realization hits him eventually. First, it’s the sound: the ping of a tablet sending a message gets his attention, but it’s a short, staccato noise, and it’s gone quickly enough that Tony’s attention hasn’t yet faded, so he hears the incessant beep-beep-beeping underneath it all. It takes him a few seconds too long to place it as medical equipment, but what else could it be?
The man’s lips don’t even twitch. Tony’s respect for him skyrockets, and he kind of wishes he’d bothered to hear the man’s name.
Steve remembers Extremis. It was part of the whole Mandarin mess that first Christmas they all knew one another. Mostly, Steve remembers seeing Tony’s house being bombed on the news and hearing
Scott makes that sound significant, but Tony has no idea why. He’s right, though. The bug things have jaws that open up and down instead of the sideways jaws of ants.
They take Scott off to another room to deal with his injured shoulder, but nobody else from that group seems too badly off, so Bucky and Vision round up some more chairs to line up close to the wall as medics make their way down the row. T’Challa exchanges all of five words with a doctor before waving him off. He stays long enough to ask after the injured and promise to be in touch, but that’s it. Natasha offers him a room to rest in for a while, or a shower, but he gracefully declines and disappears shortly after.
“Kay.”
“I’ll take that bet,” Tony says. They stand for a beat, saying nothing.
Catch me this time, Tony thinks, and closes his eyes.
is the very least we’re going to have to do if we want to be effective at dealing with the shit the world keeps throwing in our faces.”
Not an explanation, he knows. Clenching his jaw, Tony blows out a breath through his nose. When a few more seconds pass in silence, Steve tries to detach himself, to pull away. Tony clings tighter.
Steve still thinks he’s losing Tony, that Tony’s trying to leave his life for good because Tony hasn’t said or done anything to contradict that theory. And since he’s realized it, he’s only become more and more acutely aware of how he just doesn’t know anything else about what’s going on in Steve’s life. He supposes Steve’s been at the compound this entire time, but what he’s doing is anyone’s guess. Training Wanda? Keeping busy? Being upset? The only thing Tony knows for certain is that Steve’s emailed their lawyers a couple times about the amendment proceedings, and he only knows that because Steve’s cc-ing him.
“Then you should probably leave,” Tony says. “You’ve got that whole reputation to worry about. Can’t be seen with the riffraff.”
Steve looks beyond Tony’s shoulder for a couple seconds like he’s scanning the room for someone else. When he focuses back on Tony, he braces his arms in the door frame and slumps a bit.
“Okay,” Tony says. He turns forward again, resting his arm against Steve’s and raising his head before he does something truly humiliating. “Any suggestions?”
“I’m fine,” Tony says.
“Will do,” FRIDAY says.
“What movie?” he asks. Steve shrugs, even as his shoulders unwind the tiniest bit.
“Mr. Stark,” he says, “you’re free to wait h—”
“Betcha ten bucks he’s just as frustrated as us about it,” Steve dares. They’re standing there still, facing the door and not each other.
“Tony.” Clint’s voice. “You still in the city?”
“Stark’s been
“Great,” Tony says, “so I guess I can look forward to all the new and exciting ways he’s gonna find to crush my spirit.”
“Fantastic,” Tony says. “Cap? Plan B?”
So much for recon, he thinks to himself.
It isn’t fair. And he’s not five, whining about how unfair life is won’t help him now, but it just—isn’t. His team is back, everyone’s alive and fighting together, on the same side even. If ever there was a time Tony wanted to live, it’s now. His thoughts are getting increasingly sluggish, though. He’s cagey and unraveling. It’s now or never, Tony knows, and he blinks his tears away.
And that was good, positive social interaction. Steve looked proud and relieved in that strange way he did sometimes these days and Tony could feel the knot of stress loosening around his entire being until Wanda and Clint came in.
“What’s his condition?” Steve asks, because he has to, because it’s Clint, his friend and teammate, one of the only ones of them to have a family depending on him.
Tony pauses, briefly, inches from Steve’s face. He just stops and looks, because this can’t be right, what kind of reality is this? Steve just looks back, smiling like he does when he’s overwhelmed, when they’ve won a battle and he doesn’t quite trust the victory yet.
Bucky’s watching him steadily, eyes sympathetic.
“I would never,” Steve says. “Tony, you know—you have to know that wasn’t intentional. I would never hurt you.”
“No?”
and Bruce isn’t his
And then he feels a little jolt of panic, swallows it down. He finishes his drink, sets it on the floor, and forces himself to tune back in to the competition unfolding in front of him. Clint and Vis have decided that standard shots aren’t working as a measurement of their skill because it’s just too easy for the both of them, and have moved on to increasingly ridiculous trick shots.
“But then who would spread the gospel!” Tony shouts back, holding up his own phone displaying the picture of Bucky that is, on closer inspection, actually pretty funny. FRIDAY’s got an eye for angles, go figure.
Rhodey’s hand squeezes his arm once more and then withdraws.
Tony gets that familiar shock of
He frames Steve’s face in his hands to keep him in place, and pulls away.
Steve’s intimately familiar with this feeling, and sends Sam what he hopes is a reassuring smile. “I’m sorry.”
“No,” she says, low and vehement.
“Have you been drinking?”
Rhodey doesn’t answer for a minute, instead walking laboriously over to a chair and using his arms to help lower himself into it. He starts unhooking the braces and is halfway done before he speaks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know things got bad there with the Accords,” Steve continues, “and they’re still bad because of it, but I didn’t design any of it. Christ, I’m so sorry I hurt you. I’m sorry I made you think I would ever do it on purpose.”
This is what Tony’s wanted this entire time, this was the possible reality Steve’s betrayal and refusal to compromise took away from them. The lightness of the situation suddenly weighs a ton, hanging over the both of them and reminding Tony the cost he paid to get to this point. He doesn’t know what to think about it, so he just presses slightly more into Steve where they’re already touching without letting Steve know what he’s up to.
“I know,” Steve says, and he uses one hand to brush back Tony’s hair, comforting and checking for head injuries. “A med team’s on their way. I’m right here,” he says again.
Very abruptly, Tony changes his mind. This isn’t what he wants.
“What,” Bruce says.
Steve’s movements stutter, so Tony thinks he understands.
“Scratch that,” Tony says. Steve’s hand comes up to rest over Tony’s, though he looks wary. “The last couple minutes, just, cross that out. Temporary insanity or—something.”
“T’Challa’s not here,” Natasha says, not even pretending to comfort him.
“I’ll call it in and make my way over. You fly,” Clint says. His eyes are dark and solemn, his chin lowered.
“Listen, twinkletoes,” Bruce says and Tony’s gaze flickers up to catch the glee in Bruce’s eyes. “I’m still not a therapist, but this…hesitance? Not a good look on you.”
“Er,” Scott says, obviously still working to keep the conversation light, “yes? Since when does telling some asshat in glasses
Before Bruce can say anything, Tony’s up and fleeing the room altogether.
“I broke the last one,” he says, just in case Bucky forgot.
He stops to listen. Steve’s breathing is harsh, uneven. His arm twitches around Tony’s waist, wrapping around the curve of his ribs and squeezing. The movement isn’t conscious, not carried out with any kind of awareness of Tony’s presence, and he can feel the pure tension coming from Steve’s muscles
“Maximoff,” he says sharply. Her eyes close tightly and she lets out a pained noise on the exhale. He shouts when the rerebrace folds in over his bicep. The pauldron goes a few seconds later, and he doesn’t scream this time; the air feels like it’s been sucked from his lungs. That’s my collarbone, he thinks helplessly.
Or worse. But Tony doesn’t say that either. He’s at peace with his anger during that time, and it was well-documented. But the sadness, the sense of abandonment, the tears that weighed him to his bed on those days when he felt like giving up, those are another beast entirely. He thinks everybody probably knows—he knows he’s not a huge mystery—but that doesn’t mean he has to admit to it.
“Anytime,” Steve says. He’s not sure if Tony hears him or not, but when he checks a few seconds later, Tony’s out like a light.
Tony’s mouth snaps shut because he remembers a nightmare, he remembers ending up crouched on the ground with Vision’s arms around him, clinging, and he remembers not being able to remember if it was real. Now, hearing Steve’s voice, he thinks it must’ve happened.
What he does say: “Something like that.”
“Trust me,” Rhodey says, “it’s too late for my reputation. How long have we been friends?”
“Am I?” Tony asks, sharp and fast. “Am I what?”
“Okay,” Steve says, "so it took some extreme measures for her to change her mind. Are you saying you think we shouldn’t have let her help us when she realized the extent of Ultron’s plans?”
“Oh,” Steve says, “I.”
“I try not to,” Tony says wryly. When he opens his mouth again, he hopes he’s striking a good balance between honesty and not-cruelty. “A few times I did, after that first try with the Accords, but it wasn’t usually the fun or relaxing kind.”
“Oh, save it,” Wanda says. “There’s a learning curve to these things.”
“Mr. Stark,” Vision says, pulling his gaze back. Tony gasps as another spasm ripples through his torso.
“No more loud movies or smelly food tonight,” Steve agreed.
Fuck, Tony thinks. He’s been here for not quite an entire hour, and knows at least another hour’s expected of him. It’s not a hard thing; he can do this in his sleep, with his hands tied behind his back, blind drunk—and, hey, maybe that’s the problem here. He takes a deep breath in and tells himself to hold it until he comes to his senses.
“Come on,” the first voice laughs. It’s Wanda, and there’s only one set of footsteps, so Tony knows Vision’s there before he even turns far enough to see. “It wasn’t that bad.”
“Just a few what?” Steve asked, the words accompanied by the press of his hands into Tony’s shoulder blades.
He fishes for his phone again when he thinks he’s done and finds it on the floor.
It takes a few minutes for Wanda to pull back. In that time, Steve’s taken a slight blow to the head but swears he’s fine, and Redwing’s found an injured woman in a stairwell, so Natasha takes off to retrieve her. Sam starts flying lower after that, firing on the aliens in clever little dive-bombs.
“Hey there, Shellhead,” Steve says. “All done saving your company?”
“Fair,” Tony says, and wonders what Steve might’ve sent him in the past two days before jumping on a plane and booking it to Tony’s front door. He wonders what might be going on in Steve’s head besides guilt and realizes he has no idea.
By the time he’s done down in the gym, it’s fairly late, which means it’s past midnight in New York anyway, he couldn’t call even if he wanted to now.
Tony, Steve, Wanda, Clint, Sam, and the Hulk are staying behind to keep fighting and keep the way clear for the others. Tony knows it’s a different kind of portal, there’s no nuke, hell, this isn’t even New York, but he’s never been happier to be one of the least stealthy Avengers. Happy pings to ask if they need the spider kid, but Tony gives him a firm negative, tells him to get the kid back home. There are so many reasons Tony could end up in hell, but bringing Peter into this fight isn’t going to be one of them.
“Stane, right? Obadiah?”
Sam sends a thumbs-up emoji and that’s the end of that.
“Wrong billionaire, I’m afraid,” Tony says.
“Wait,” Steve says, “we’re pinned. I think we need Wanda over here.”
“Good talk,” he says, and Tony’s grin spreads about as wide as it can.
Steve just nods.
“Welcome back to consciousness,” Tony says without looking up.
“Buck,” he says, and tries to smile.
“Bruce went to catch some sleep,” he says, “and Pepper went for a walk.”
“Okay.”
“S’not,” he slurred. Anger and frustration ripped through him at that and he bit his tongue, hard. He thought it might be bleeding, but he was rewarded with the clarity of pain for about .2 seconds. “Not that,” he tried again. Talking was hard. Finding his goddamn mouth through the mess of neurons was hard. Sam paused. The air in front of him shifted again. Tony opened his eyes and it was Natasha in front of him.
When Tony starts walking between two rows of apple trees, Steve follows, even though Tony’s never been to this part of the compound before.
“Everything.” Steve’s hand moved so that two of his fingers rested against Tony’s pulse point for the barest of moments, and then he was walking away. “Goodnight.”
“Right,” Steve says dryly. He thinks of Tony screaming in pain, and of Clint in surgery, Bruce’s return, and Steve’s own freakout that lasted the entire way here. He doesn’t think he’s seen Natasha sit down since they touched down in Chicago. “You seen a doctor yet?”
“What about it?” he prompted.
“Morning, Sleeping Beauty,” he singsongs.
Your best friend lost his legs, and for what? Because you couldn’t talk about your feelings with Captain America?”
“I didn’t even know the RAFT existed,” he admits in a rush of breath. “I didn’t have a finger in that pie, V, I didn’t even know the goddamn pie was there.”
One hand still playing in Steve’s hair, Tony smirks and says, “Hey, Fri? Let’s get the ball rolling, yeah?”
“ETA on help?” Steve asks.
“Huh, what?” Tony says.
“Back to Malibu, I think,” Tony says. “After breakfast.”
“Ideas for the armor plating, a way to make the seals tighter while expanding range of motion,” he says instead. “Just have to make sure the joints’ll be strong enough to provide full support too. My elbows only bend one way and that’s how I’d like to keep ‘em.”
The advice had followed him. By the time he met Rhodey, Tony was firmly in the habit of shoving his anxiety down and using the residual jitters to move, to work, to
Two kisses, three of them, and Tony can hear with perfect recall the sound Steve’s skull made against the tree, how still he was, how terrible everything had seemed when he was hazy and hurting.
“Sorry," Tony echoes. “If you can’t manage to talk about feelings and trauma with a licensed professional, should you really be allowed on a team of superheroes though.”
“Pretty sure red was Cap’s first,” Scott says. Cassie scoffs outright at her dad.
Tony stares at Steve for a moment, until he blinks. He blinks twice before Steve blinks once, and only then does he realize that he’s having a stare-down with Captain America.
“Is this about the fridge again? I’ll have food delivered by morning, I promise. Just, nobody attack the delivery person in the middle of the night.”
Tony says again and—fuck, no, wait, those are actual tears in Tony’s eyes. Steve doesn’t know anything about vectors, but he knows that messing up the calculations is going to make Tony cry real tears in about four seconds. Steve is definitely not equipped to deal with this.
question.
“Then,” Tony says, and he holds up his hands in an exaggerated shrug, “I don’t think you get to be mad at me about it.”
“Have you talked to Steve about this?” Sam asks then, which. Not as hostile as it could’ve been. In fact, it’s downright generous considering—well, considering.
A shiver rips its way though Tony’s frame, even though physically he’s perfectly warm and the most comfortable he’s maybe ever been. Steve shifts behind him, against him, and Tony makes himself stay still and just breathe for a little while.
“How could I have gotten you out?” Tony says, raising his voice to match hers and cursing himself as he does it. It’s not that he doesn’t think he has a right to be angry—he well and truly believes he’s entitled to his share of bitterness here—but more just that he wants to live, and yelling at Wanda is not a good way to ensure his own continued safety. But
They don’t say anything after that. Steve seems to be trying to regulate his breathing and Tony’s focusing on staying awake. There’s nothing to say anyway. After a few minutes, Steve starts talking again, telling the others where he thinks they are.
“So you’ve said,” Bruce says slowly.
“Sweet dreams!” Clint calls after them as the elevator door slides shut.
“Friday?” he says.
“Can’t be me. I’d say ‘he trusts me about as far as he can throw me,’ but he can throw me pretty damn far.”
Tony knows that’s an exaggeration, but Bucky obviously doesn’t.
“Uh, yeah, sure. Thanks.”
“I don’t think so,” he says, raising his hands in an exaggerated shrug. “I am intimately familiar with guilt-as-motivator, Pep. That’s not what this is. It’s just not.”
“Why didn’t he have his body dropped off with those medics that were on call right outside the perimeter?” Steve asks helplessly; the heat in his voice doesn’t disappear, but it does sound more like desperation. “The suit still could’ve come back and he could’ve gotten help half an hour sooner!”
“All due respect, Boss,” she says, “let’s make sure your upgrade isn’t buggy before we mess around with my programming.”
“Nice look,” Rhodey says, and Tony remembers he’s wearing two t-shirts, his boxers, and mismatched socks.
Tony has the sudden urge to overturn the carton of eggs onto Steve’s head. Instead, he snorts, and Steve’s frown twists, the side of his mouth turns sour.
“I know.” And Tony doesn’t know why he sounds so soft all of a sudden, like he’s letting Steve down easy. Earlier he’d wanted to scream the words in his face, stuff them down his throat, give him a taste of his own medicine. “But it’s not a scale, Steve.”
The brief also says that once the embryos grow, the host will become “effectively dead.” Tony doesn’t want to find out what that means, but he has a feeling he won’t be so lucky.
“Holy role reversal, Batman,” Bruce mutters, watching Tony’s mug through narrowed eyes as the liquid at the bottom gets closer and closer to spilling onto the bench.
And then Steve’s typing again, and Tony waits. He swings his feet up even farther until he’s upside down, hair nearly brushing the floor and, wow, he needs a haircut maybe.
They’re almost at the compound when Steve finally rolls up the window. Tony kind of wants to roll it back down just to be petty, and he kind of wants to jump out of the moving vehicle to avoid Steve.
Steve maneuvered Tony until he was sitting up with firm touches, not tickling, ghosting touches, and Tony was glad he didn’t have to walk Steve through this. He didn’t have the verbal capacity for it at the moment. They ended up in Steve’s chair with Steve sitting and Tony in his lap, one knee on each side of Steve’s hips, which in any other situation would’ve been Tony’s every teenage fantasy come to life, but as it was his face was smushed into Steve’s neck, the hood pulled up protectively over his hair, his fingers in Steve’s hair, and Steve’s fingers on his back.
“My sweet little what now?” Sam says, but he’s already heading in that direction, so Tony just laughs. He feels high on adrenaline, and like he’s home, like he’s alive and engaged in the world, like the gang’s back together. And he just might commission a massive, renaissance-esque painting of a cherub rodeo for Clint’s birthday.
Never again, if he can help it.
“None of the above,” Tony says.
The armor catches up with him then, and he gets away from his table to let it wrap around him. So much for invisibility, but it never lasts anyway.
"Not really.” Steve puts his hand out and trails his hand across the leaves of a nearby branch as they pass. “Ever since we officially became a team, it’s been you dealing with insurance claims and holding press conferences and answering phone calls from D.C. at all hours of the night. And I thought…”
“Yeah… okay,” Tony says, squinting. “I think I see it.”
Bucky grunts in what Steve guesses is acknowledgment.
“They’re liable to fly off the handle,” Sam concedes. “Possible, though I really did expect more...hierarchy.”
Debrief goes well aside from the mention of Bucky. Steve participates just as much as he did in SHIELD debriefs, everyone is thorough in their recounts, and Mrs. Young is exceptionally diplomatic, asking the nitty gritty questions without sounding condescending and directing the conversation expertly.
Tony scoffs to himself, considers the ramp well and truly covered, and swoops around to land near Clint, who smiles cheekily at him, raises his bow, and fires at something over Tony’s shoulder without breaking eye contact.
“Boss,” FRIDAY says.
“Lang—” Steve says, but he’s gone already, back through the portal.
“Whaddaya mean you—” Steve starts to say, and Tony interrupts because he can’t let Steve finish that sentence, he can’t, because he’s looking at Tony like Tony’s as dumb as he feels.
“I’ve been sitting in my office for days,” Tony says, “and even then, Wilson’s the only one who comes to see me.”
There’s a beat of silence, two. Three and a half before Bucky opens his mouth.
“And it’s no one person’s decision,” Steve says placatingly. “That’s what the rubric’s for. It’s a matter of safety, for new and existing members.”
“A touching sentiment,” Steve says, but he’s smirking. Tony hums, and Steve lets go of his leg to reach up and take Tony’s hand instead, and they end up holding hands over Steve’s heart. Tony’s arm is stretched so it’s awkward, and if they stay like this long it’ll be asleep. “I want you to be happy too.”
“Take me,” Steve says right away.
“I guarantee he paid more,” Tony will say.
“After Ultron everyone was still sore about your lie of omission and Wanda was taking cheap shots at you every time you showed your face,” Steve interrupts. “Most of us were.”
“That’s not—”
It is horrendously, exceptionally bright in this room. Tony blinks, scrunches his nose up again because it makes his eyes water, and blinks some more. He rolls his head to the other side and, holy shit, that really is Bruce, not Tony’s imagination, Bruce is right in front of him.
“Steve,” Tony says, and Steve is so, so quiet on the other end, “what I need from you right now is for you to leave me alone. Unless the world starts to end again. Capiche?”
The look on Steve’s face is horrible. It’s like Tony’s kicked Barnes in the face (again) but also like Steve’s trying to make light of it or something, like the smile people always get right before they burst into tears. Tony takes a long sip from his coffee, temperature be damned. He burns his entire tongue, but obviously is in need of the caffeine.
Tony sighs and starts propping the tablets up around him.
“Think you can sleep?” Steve asks, and it jars something in Tony.
“He hasn’t been down yet, at least,” Steve says. Tony hums from behind his mug. “It’s a little early,” he says pointedly.
It takes a few seconds, but the kiss shifts. Steve’s fingernails scratch along his scalp as his fingers curl into the too-long hair there, his tongue enters the equation, and it feels insistent. In response, Tony lets his own mouth become more desperate—
“Reports of a small fleet of weaponized robots on 57th,” Bruce says.
“Oh, don’t give me those eyes, Cap,” Tony said. “I’m trying to be—whatever, reassuring, here. If you start crying your fairy godmother’s gonna show up and give me the disappointed look and I am too tired for this nonsense, Rogers, cut me some slack.”
The things explode like they speak, not quite simultaneous, but in a cascade. Tony does what he does best—he calculates. He’s on the ground now, Thor a solid ten yards to the north-north-west, Natasha just over twenty yards straight east. He turns towards her and propels himself, ignoring the sounds of the bots exploding around him and his teammates shouting, and manages to bowl into her right as her bot detonates. The blast knocks them off-course so they skip across the ground, taking small divots out of the grass as they go, reminding Tony distinctly of some of his worst botched golf games.
There’s a bit of resignation, then. Probably nobody puts any of the blame on Rhodey’s shoulders; he did, after all, pay for the whole ordeal more permanently than anyone. There aren’t many people to be considered faultless in the fiasco—even Bruce and Thor carry the burden of not having so much as witnessed the whole thing. Certain people, though, hold much less culpability than others: Peter, who’s legally a child; Bucky, under mind control and doing his best to stay under the radar; and, to a certain extent, Rhodey, whose views and loyalties have always kept him firmly in a chain of command. None of whom have raised complaints about the supposed necessity of therapy to stay on the team.
Rhodey puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder and tries to get him to lay back with gentle nudging.
“Listen,” Clint says, “that’s not us.”
on his flesh.
“What?” Tony asks. “You just like to hang out in medical now? What’re you doing here?”
“Doesn't matter as long as he’s okay,” Steve says.
“Thank you, o, diplomat extraordinaire.” Steve smiles at her, pained and small but real. She grins back tiredly.
word, sugarplum—”
Tony leans back on his hand so he can look up more comfortably. It’s obvious that Steve at least believes he’s being truthful.
“Yeah, whatever. Glad to have you back,” Sam calls as the doors close again and take him away.
“Of course I am,” Steve says. Quieter, “Of course I am.”
“I’m always busy,” he throws back, more as a sad imitation of their old verbal sparring than any kind of truth. Steve sighs and gives Tony a once over that makes his skin prickle uncomfortably.
These days, though, Tony almost laughs, and he thinks, a little maniacally:
“Just say it,” Wanda snaps, and she looks miserable. After a glance Clint’s way, she looks straight into Tony’s eyes. “Why is this so—necessary? Why make this rule?”
“Of course, Captain.”
The thing about that is that they’re still effectively pinned under God-knows-how-many-tons of concrete and glass and steel beams. They can’t move, even as their enemy picks their way slowly towards them. Tony looks down at Steve, at the fear he can see on the other man’s face.
“Of course,” Vision says wryly. He floats up to standing, and there’s a power Tony’s jealous of.
“Couldn’t sleep?” Tony asks. Bucky shrugs and goes back to looking at the blank screen. Tony’s about to leave when Bucky sneaks a glance at him.
“Bruce,” Steve snaps.
Tony takes a moment to absorb the question. It’s neither blind forgiveness nor accusation. His first instinct is to retreat, to say nothing happened, to keep the truth of it close to his chest.
“Amen to that,” Tony says, and they both lean forward enough to clink their bottles together.
i'll level with you guys: historically, i suck at writing action scenes. if something's unclear, i can almost guarantee it's because my writing is unclear. let me know so i can fix it! (once again, this entire fic is un-beta'd. i'm bound to miss something every now and again, and i'm very grateful for people who take the time to save me from that embarrassment.)
He thinks he might be at the point in healing where he’s past being bitter and angry and ready to snap all the time. Everything seems normal and calm and better for the most part, and then reminders jump out of the water and he’s blinded with it. They’ve shown (some more than others) that they’re willing to stand beside him, that they’re on the same team, that they care. Which makes things simply confusing. Why did they go through all of that if it was pointless and they’re back anyway? Why the assumptions and the knee-jerk anger and the distrust?
“Okay,” Tony says just as Steve rounds the corner and leans a hip against the counter, eyebrow raised. “Listen, ’kay? I’m fine. I’m dandy, and I’m not just saying that this time. What did Ned hear?”
The longer they stay online, the better they get at coordinating with one another, too. A couple have managed to stay in the game for nearly the entire time, and they’re getting to be a problem.
“That was before she met—”
“Tony?” Steve says quietly. “Tony, it’s me, okay, you’re going to be okay. I’m here.”
Happy’s eyes dance over to Peter and Steve. “Nothin’ I’m gonna say in front of a minor. Come visit sometime, maybe I’ll tell ya.”
“I think I should be offended,” Scott says easily as he reaches for a fork, not sounding offended at all.
“Yeah,” Tony says, proud when his voice comes out clear, if a little breathless. “I’m just gonna—hang out here for a hot second if you don’t mind.”
he thinks, a little hysterically. It’s the same code from before the Accords, before Siberia. And Tony hasn’t changed it. But that’s…something to look at later. Not now.
“You just sounded kind of ou—you know what? Never mind. No reason. What can I do ya for, my man?”
“You stretch yourself too thin,” Steve tells him. Tony’s almost amused by the sentiment, even though he knows he should be annoyed with Steve for thinking he knows anything about Tony’s life. Actually, he is sort of annoyed. The smell of the coffee is starting to reach his brain.
Tony squares his shoulders and wishes they were having this conversation in the kitchen or in a board room, somewhere he could storm out of, but he’s not even wearing shoes and Steve’s blocking the door because Tony’s an inhospitable jerk who didn’t invite his guest in.
Of course, he knows he hasn’t been talking much. It’s not something that’s exactly easy to miss from him, after all. He just hadn’t quite understood, before, that he’s stopped talking completely. And, okay, it’s not like there’s anyone around for him to talk
for the beta!
Tony hangs up, and he breathes.
“It’ll be fine. We’ll work on it, together.”
“You didn’t have to,” Steve says, more awkward than anything else.
“Rogers, Cap, Mon Capitan,” Tony says, throwing a nickname in there because what he really means is
“Salt-cured boar,” Thor says. “Beyond that I’m impartial.”
“Pick a tree, any tree,” Tony says, moving to pick him up by the quiver strap.
Steve paces, because he can’t get into a physical fight with Pepper, and he can’t leave to go to the gym, not now, and because if he doesn’t move he thinks he might fall asleep, even standing. He’s cold and everything itches at this point in the healing process, and he feels like everything is two inches to the left. It’s a feeling he’s been getting since he woke up from the ice, or maybe since Bucky fell, he doesn’t know which. But it echoes inside of him in moments like this:
“I didn’t want to fight him,” Steve says.
“Our rooms are the same as we left them,” he finally says. It sounds like an accusation.
He doesn’t have to look to know Steve’s frowning at him. He looks anyway and—yep, right there. Steve’s given up pretending to watch the road, and he’s looking at Tony like he’s trying to parse his words.
“The guy with seemingly endless money and just as much power. If there’s a problem, why haven’t you fixed it already?”
“Would you have?” Tony asks, and maybe he shouldn’t be interrupting so much. He probably shouldn’t be interrupting so much. Steve raises an eyebrow.
“I—” Peter conveys an expression of wide-eyed surprise even through his mask (it’s really no wonder he wants to keep his face covered as Spider-Man, secret identities aside). “Good! Good—I mean. I’m usually not so great at history—dates are the worst, I have an alright memory for just about everything but dates—but there was. Uh, this study group, and it helped.”
“So,” Rhodey says, “just hangin’ out?”
“What—?”
Clint shrugs.
And then there’s a plate in front of him, syrup and butter at his elbow. Tony pokes at the french toast with his fork, flips it over, but it smells good at the very least. It might not be cooked very evenly, but it all seems cooked enough. He scoops up his plate and mug and makes a strategic retreat to the table when Cassie starts telling her dad why Sam gets to be gold and why Scott himself should be pink. He sits with his back to the kitchen after going back for the syrup and butter, facing Clint.
“Oh,” Pepper says, and she sounds genuinely surprised. Even at the height of their relationship, there are certain things they failed at. Problem solving being chief among them.
He wakes up every morning (in the actual, AM morning), goes through The Routine, drinks at least two cups of coffee leisurely before even touching a tool, goes to work for a few hours on FRIDAY’s hardware, and then alternates between working on Rhodey’s legs and projects for SI while he orders food. He listens to his usual music while he works, and the rest of the time he either has the TV on or the sliding glass doors open to let in the sound and smell of the sea. It’s sappy and a little romantic, but Malibu has always been Tony’s place. Even if it feels incongruous right now, it’s still his coast the same way it was when he was twenty-one and unable to feel like his own person in New York, standing in front of Howard’s old desk in Howard’s old office. Malibu is his and sunny and glitz and glam and, more importantly, not Howard’s, not Fury’s, not Steve’s. This is his life, and nobody, not old ghosts or new monsters, is going to tell him how to live it right.
Laying with his head in the scanner sets off a hard case of the spins for Steve, so much so that he almost jumps out of this seat. He gasps, and Tony can see the sweat breaking out on his face.
He finally reaches up, touches his hands to Tony’s jaw. He’s burning up, and he gasps in a breath at the contact, and sobs it out. His eyes look like they’re struggling to open past the impulse to scrunch them closed.
There’s a series of agreements from the entire team, and then they all quiet down and focus on getting there, Tony in the suit, Scott on an ant (and yes, he actually makes good time doing that, go figure, but that doesn’t mean Tony’s going to stop teasing him about it), the rest in a Quinjet. Tony switches over to a private comm channel and pings Steve.
“I’m good. I’ve got a couple things downstairs I wanna get to today. Really shouldn’t have slept so long.”
“Very diplomatic,” Bruce says dryly.
Steve stopped carrying the phone with him about four months in; it’s bulky and awkwardly shaped and is way too obvious, but if he misses this call he’s going to do something drastic. Something that Tony would do. Have T’Challa build a receiver and implant it under his skin, right next to his ear, so he can never miss Tony’s call. He thinks Tony might already have one of those things—God, he can’t believe he just left the phone in his room like that—
Mayhaps, Tony concedes. He remembers Steve’s face pressed against the pillow, his eyes reflecting light in the apple orchard, and the pain in his voice there. He genuinely doesn’t think so.
“No,” Tony had said, “I’m going to lock myself in my lab and disappear for days at a time, but sometimes that’s what I have to do, that’s just how I am and—”
“About an hour,” Rhodey says. He’s picked himself up and has his hands braced on the back of the chair Sam’s using for his ankle.
“Steve?” Tony says, sounding slightly panicked over his backdrop of general stress.
They stare each other down for a good minute before Rhodey sighs.
Peter’s eyes jump around the room, bemused and loosening up by the second.
Of Bruce, in the weeks after the invasion, who would prod at Tony wherever he fell asleep in the lab, steering him to the couch and sighing like the most put-out man in all the world.
So Rhodey gets to know that Tony’s alive and kickin’ and Tony gets to be reminded that someone out there cares enough to check in on him without demanding anything at the same time.
Wanda’s not awake yet, so Vision is on the couch in a semicircle with Clint and Natasha. He’s wearing the perturbed expression he usually adopts when human nature doesn’t follow logic, so Tony decides to leave them be.
“FRIDAY did,” Natasha says. “Her and Rhodes. They’re making their way to the compound already.”
Tony sends back,
“Hey there, honey bear,” Tony says when the elevator slides open. He flashes a quick grin when Rhodey just looks him up and down critically.
“Sir?” one of the paramedics says, laying a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “we need to—”
“Oh, well. When you put it like that.”
The kid hangs up then, and Tony’s almost proud of him for it. At this rate, maybe he’ll be able to kick the kid of that weird “Mr. Stark” habit in the next couple years.
Steve’s bed smells like him, vaguely like his shampoo, earthy and light. Tony imagines never smelling it again, of having gotten to this point and then leaving it behind. Moreover, Steve’s right to ask. He’s being fair and opening yet another channel of communication between them in the process, or trying to. Uncomfortable though it may be, Tony knows talking—and being honest about it—is the thing that needs to be done here.
“Come on, lay down, close your eyes,” Tony says. Bruce shuffles down on the bed, still in his lab clothes, and wiggles around enough to get the covers out from underneath him.
He’ll deal with it, he swears. As long as they’re both alive, he’ll deal with everything else. Tony just has to live, just has to hear Steve out, once and for all.
“I had a helicopter!” He gestures excessively, desperately. “The five of us on a chopper? We never would’ve outrun their aircraft!”
“How d’you know?”
He goes through the files, adding his own notes here and there, and resolutely pretends that going back to the West Coast feels like going home.
So he turns all the lights down by 20% and sketches out a plan for FRIDAY to follow if Tony were to go berserk. The buzzing settles into his skin until he’s resigned to it as his new normal, his body being just as hyperaware as his brain, and it makes him wish for a drink.
and Tony descends to attach his lips to Steve’s jaw before he can get overwhelmed.
“Humble abode,” Bucky echoes with an amused huff. His focus isn’t even on Tony, but the ’shop around them, eyes flitting from bench to bench, pausing on the Iron Man armor in its case before moving on to the rest. Tony realizes all at once that this is Bucky’s first time down here, ever. He’s never seen this part of Tony before. He lets the silence stretch on a few more seconds than he normally would as Bucky takes it in.
“I really think you’d be more comfortable out in the waiting room, and we can come get you when Captain Rogers is moved to a room.”
“Oh!” Peter says, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “You know who was behind the crazy robots?”
Tony’d been planning on lying insofar as he’d been planning on saying anything. Watching Sam fall on the other end of the couch, though, like his strings have been cut, like he’s exhausted, pulls the truth from him.
how come no one thought of them? Why wouldn’t Sam himself bring them up? “You remember having any turns in the rota? On
“I’m sorry that’s what you think,” Steve says, head held much higher than the insult calls for. “I assure you it’s not the reality. The Avengers are fully committed to our continued mission, and we’ve only learned from the past few months.”
Not in so many words, Steve thinks. He remembers the blackening puncture wound on Tony’s hip, though, remembers asking himself what else that could be. He’d been blindly hoping by not asking for confirmation. A lie of omission he told himself, but he wasn’t clueless. He’d described the injury to the medical team on the Quinjet, just hadn’t put a name to it.
There’s a second, two, where nobody says anything. Wanda opens her mouth like she’s going to argue, but Tony’s still wrapped up nice and tight in alien tentacles, thank you very much, and he does not have time for this.
“Already done, Boss.”
(Another part of him thinks Steve might not have gone so entirely off the rails if he hadn’t had his closest friend backing his every decision but, really, Sam
“Talk to me,” he says lowly.
“I solemnly swear,” he says, “to stay out of your hair.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, and as the humor quiets down, taking the dregs of his energy down with it. The elevator door slides open on the communal level and Tony waves Steve off.
Tony thinks of Bruce’s new lab, of the room he’s kept for Bruce at the compound even though the man himself was long gone.
It lunges. Tony tilt his wrists just enough to fire the repulsors, more out of reflex than anything. It only burns some of the human skin over the thing’s armored chest, but otherwise glances off. The alien collides with Tony, then, sending him back into and halfway through the wall of the office. He shakes his head to clear it, but then the alien’s on him, screaming and gripping the shoulders of the armor. His shoulder screams and he feels something deep inside him grind at the rough movement.
“That’s the spirit,” Tony says, clapping him on the shoulder. The kid squirms, and it’s sort of like the way Bruce shifts his weight when he has something to add, so he cocks his head and stays quiet. Sure enough, it’s only a few seconds before Spider-Man opens his mouth again.
He flicks his gaze back to Wanda, who’s now standing straight up, but hasn’t lowered her hands. He remembers the men and women they had to fight, had to
The realization hits suddenly, crashing like a wave: he can’t lay here anymore, alone, thinking about it, or he thinks he really will go insane. He’s always been skilled at actualizing self-fulfilling prophecies.
Natasha snorts.
“Hey, man,” Sam will say, “how much you pay to get in here tonight, huh?”
“Sounds good,” Happy says. “Need anything from the city before I come back up on Sunday?”
“You’re tired,” he says before he’s even registered the words, and he realizes it’s true. “Oh.”
“You’re both ridiculous,” Steve says.
“I think it's time,” Tony says. “We need to start taking some initiative with team members’ mental health, Steve. I think the best plan is regular, Avenger-mandated therapy to, one, decide if people are combat ready and, two, if they’re not, get them the help they need without making it feel like some sort of punishment.”
He lays there for a few minutes, just listening and relishing in the warmth Steve’s giving off, surprised Steve hasn’t woken up yet. He stays where he is even when he hears someone—Natasha—approaching, cranes his neck and smiles at her when her head pops over the back of the couch. She smiles back, raises her phone and snaps a picture. He’s very, very certain in the knowledge that it’s not the first photo she’s gotten this morning.
“That is,” Tony shakes his head, “oddly reassuring coming from you. Thanks.”
and Tony simply can’t fathom the thought of him being in trouble and not helping), but in the end, he can’t do it. They all deserve to live because they’re people and because they’re his teammates, and it stings too much to try and boil it down to a few variables. It’s cowardly, is what it is, but he also thinks it may be the right way to handle this. The priority here is whoever’s closest and in the most need of help. That is, unless someone happens to be key in finishing the mission and saving the world (or at least a good chunk of it). Then, depending on just how big of chunk of the world they’re talking here, they key teammate could even take priority over civilians.
“Reality TV’s fuckin’ crazy,” Bucky says in conclusion. On screen, a blonde woman just showed up uninvited to the brunette’s lunch gathering. Tony can feel the tension from his chair and he makes note of which women at the table make meaningful eye contact with one another like ‘oh Jesus, not again’ and which look like they want to start chanting for a fight. Tony’s been to his fair share of these kinds of get togethers, but this is normally the point he starts drinking seriously, with intent, or otherwise finds a way to excuse himself. It’s admittedly much more amusing with the screen in between him and the drama. Natasha breezes through sometime during the second episode to make herself some tea.
“Whoops,” Scott says when he tips his bottle up only to find it empty. “I need another beer. Want one?”
“Sam Wilson,” Sam says. “A pleasure.”
Think, Tony tells himself. If Bruce is here and Tony himself is in a hospital—or in medical at the compound, now that he’s looking—then something exciting definitely happened.
He’s never going to let that happen again. Not now that he has them, here, with him.
“I know,” Tony says instead. “We’ll work it out. I’ll start coming down to the city once or twice a week to the office. Or for board meetings. And you know you’re welcome upstate anytime, right? Because you have probably more security clearance than even I do, y’know.”
“Tony,” Steve says, stepping forward with his hands out, palms up like a beggar. “It’s not a problem, I mean it—what do you need to feel safe at the compound? I’ll make it happen.”
Steve gasps then, at the awful sharp pressure against his back. His eyes shut tightly against the pain and by the time he opens them he’s just tired.
So, Tony starts out in one corner of the house, in a smallish living room—he doesn’t know what to call it, a sun room maybe?—and knocks out parts of the wall to install receivers and sensor panels. Most of the cameras are already in place; he thinks he’ll just have to add more in the larger rooms.
He feels like he’s going to be sick. He ignores it, pushes it down, because he and Tony are having coffee in the morning. They have plans. Tony agreed. The back of his throat still burns, but he steps forward.
“Stark,” he says, “it’s good to see you looking well.”
“Ah,” Steve says.
“Hey, doc,” Tony says, going for casual. “You requested a second opinion?”
It’s another ten minutes before the Quinjet shows up, and Tony thinks they must’ve pushed it on the speed front. It definitely hasn’t been twenty minutes yet, but he doesn’t bring it up out of sheer gratitude. He’s a little beat up, but fine for the most part. Steve comes careening out of the ‘jet before it even sets down, and Tony can tell he’s pissed. It’s all in the ultra-tight coil of his somersault and the ferocity with which he flings his shield at the nearest bot.
He gets a good deal of the plating constructed and halfway assembled. It’s good. Overall very tedious work, but he gets to use his hands a lot. There’s a new rhythm to his workshop that involves multiple projects—tonight it’s the various aspects of Bucky’s arm and putting the finishing touches on Redwing’s updated code—and a lot of mileage on Tony’s rolly chair. At some point he adds in circuitry work for the arm too, which is trickier, more detailed work, and there’s no room in his head for anything else, and that’s pure bliss.
There’s almost an entire ten seconds of silence as Steve takes tiny sips and Clint watches the both of them.
“And the circumstances where we’re in conflict or not alone have yielded…somewhat different results, historically speaking,” Steve agrees easily enough, but his smile has mostly vanished.
Steve takes that last half step closer and brings a hand up to Tony’s jaw, and Tony leans into it. Tony’s entire being fuzzes around the edges, soft and warm.
He takes a moment to picture the scene.
“Hey, toss me a hoodie?” Tony asks, reaching a hand out without making a move to get out of bed, and Steve rifles around in a drawer before throwing a hoodie over his shoulder where it lands perfectly on Tony’s face.
Turns out Steve hates root beer. They have to pause the movie two minutes in when Steve takes a swig without looking and then struggles not to spit it out in the popcorn. Tony watches in horrified silence as Steve bolts to the kitchen to spit it in the sink and wash out his mouth, and then he laughs for ten minutes straight, even after they turn the movie back on and Steve drinks three cokes to get rid of the taste in his mouth.
“Tony,” Wanda says. This might be the first time she’s called him by his given name, this horror show must really be bringing them closer together. It makes Tony hate himself all the more for what he has to ask.
Evacuations are the only thing they’re keeping up with. Wanda and Vision have come back to the fight after the direct perimeter was cleared. Now the police are evacuating people in a wider and wider diameter. Tony feels slightly better with the buffer zone, but it doesn’t mean anything if they can’t get this under control.
” Pepper says somewhere off to the side. She’s talking to Natasha, maybe. It doesn’t matter.
Steve sweeps his gaze around the small balcony and his eyes end up back on Tony’s face. He’s not sure what Steve finds there, but a moment later he slides his back against the door and ends up sitting criss-cross opposite Tony.
It’s the truth anyway, even if it doesn’t explain what Tony’s doing standing in front of Steve’s bedroom like an idiot. Steve’s brow furrows.
Sam drops onto the armchair, tablet lighting up his face in a cool white light. Tony lapses into silence as Sam reads.
“No!” Tony yells. He feels just as manic as Steve looked a minute ago, but now Steve just seems kind of worried. Tony makes himself take a deep breath that doesn’t help at all, but he’s not screaming when he opens his mouth this time. “Look, it’s already in place, mostly. I’m making Barnes a new arm, T’Challa and I have been talking about different therapy techniques he can try. Just—call His Royal Kittiness and give the go ahead.”
“It’s 3 PM,” Steve says.
“Tony,” Steve snaps, like his name is a curse.
“Certainly not,” Tony says, scandalized. “Technically speaking, anyway. Though I appreciate the poetic sentiment. Actually…Dummy might count, but even that’s a bit of a stretch.”
His luck, his contentedness.
“You left us there,” she accuses him, her voice low and dangerous, but it wobbles at the end.
“Oh, don’t give me that,” Tony laughed. He actually liked Bucky, it turned out. And all of that murderous rage Tony felt in Siberia washed away when Steve wasn’t talking in his ear about how innocent his friend was. “He probably learned that from you, back in the day.”
They end up on the common floor couch, watching a movie about paintings in the 1950’s with Amy Adams because apparently they’re becoming the kind of friends who watch movies alone together in the dead of night. He doesn’t even have to bully Steve into physical contact this time around. In fact, when Tony rests his head on Steve’s shoulder, Steve rolls with it, tossing an arm over Tony’s shoulders, grounding him.
Peter’s eyes are wide, and Vision has stopped pretending to breathe, still as a statue as he watches.
Tony hisses a breath through his teeth.
“Gimme a sign here, FRI,” he says eventually, still staring at the mug. There’s a pause where FRIDAY presumably scans the coffee.
There are at least 25 bots in the clearing around him by now, and he’s not entirely sure where they’re coming from.
Steve and Vis greet him, Bruce grumbles something from his spot at the counter, but Tony knows not to be offended; that’s just how Bruce is in the mornings.
“I…you’re sure?” Peter says. “I mean, with everybody there?”
“—to be a team and a united front—”
“But I mean it,” Steve says.
The errant thought
What a leader, Rogers.
“Done.”
The thing is, away from Steve, alone, Tony doesn’t know which perception he should believe, which he should be basing his actions on. They’re both real, in their own ways, Tony knows. Steve’s no villain, but he really did those things; he hurt Tony; he drove the team apart. He did those things, but that doesn’t mean that the version of Steve from last night and this morning—the one who listened, and reassured, and stayed with Tony until he fell asleep, the one who smiled at Tony with his mouth full of sesame seed bagel—he’s not any less real for all the pain he’s caused in the past.
So he knows he can’t fuck off to Malibu forever like he wants, can’t just disappear from the world stage no matter how tired he is. At this point, the Avengers are his consequence. A dozen books, countless podcasts, and half the population of the US have uttered the words “since Tony Stark put on that metal suit…” Like it or not, he was a major catalyst for the entire shitstorm of the Avengers Initiative. Not to mention, he funded the Avengers fully after the fall of SHIELD. He held charity fundraisers and employed an entire team of PR gods to ensure people kept their faith in world’s mightiest heroes.
“Steve,” he says, and runs his fingernails over Steve’s scalp. Some of the tension eases, but he still sounds steely, if less dejected, when he speaks again.
“Why now?” Tony throws one hand in the air for emphasis Steve can’t see anyway. (It still makes Tony feel better though.) “Why couldn’t we ‘have a conversation’ when there was still something left for us to salvage! What makes you care now!”
“The rest of the plan is just to wait, I’m afraid,” Steve says, though he doesn’t sound apologetic in the least. “Patience and exposure.”
“You knew about this?” Steve says, and it comes out much angrier than he probably means it, but this whole experience is grating Steve down to his bones. Tony had been in so much pain, just lying in a back alley on the dirty ground, close to choking on his own vomit, alone. Bruce takes a step, a widening of his feet that’s moving neither forwards nor backwards.
“Fuck,” Tony says eloquently, and Vision’s eyes roam methodically, taking in everything there is to see before settling firmly on Tony’s face. The vice grip around his heart releases all at once and it hurts anew, in a much less worrisome but still sharp way, like the pins and needles of moving a limb after it’s fallen asleep.
“Howdy,” he says.
“Okay,” Sam says slowly. “And, what, you think that if I float the idea he’ll be any more receptive to it? Please.”
Steve gets close enough to Thor and the Hulk that his comm starts picking up what they’re saying and transmitting it to the rest.
“What?” he asks, voice dropping to match in volume.
“I stopped talking,” Tony says all in a rush. Steve scoffs again, but with less of an edge this time.
“We won’t have any more problems?” Steve asks. Thor meets the queen’s eyes briefly before looking back to Steve and shaking his head. Steve could scream, really. All of this, the bloodshed and death and horror, and they’re just going to leave? Not that he wants them to stay, but why even start this crusade in the first place if they’re just going to give up?
Tony’s quiet for another couple of minutes, and Steve thinks he’s definitely nodded off this time, his breathing deep and even, but he breaks the silence once more, sounding at least half asleep.
“Steve,” Tony says, and turns finally. He makes sure he has eye contact, locked and loaded, before he continues. “What we’re doing, you and me, is all fine and dandy. Maybe even good.” Steve’s lips curl up at one side, an unwilling smile. “It doesn’t change me, though. And it doesn’t change you. Whatever’s about to come out of your mouth sounds like it’s gonna be at least slightly hypocritical, so maybe—don’t.”
Steve looks thoughtful as he reaches up to cover Tony’s hands with his own. Less sad, and Tony will take that as a win.
“’Course not,” Sam says easily, and at least he’s loosening up a little. “Must be thinking of the other bundle of nerves leading this team.”
It takes Tony a second too long to realize what Steve’s doing, and when it finally clicks he rolls his eyes skyward.
“—not even Rhodey knew until pretty recently, so I hardly think I can be blamed for not knowing, because Rhodey always catches on before me somehow—”
“Ouch,” he says, all faux cool, “but true.”
“Always,” he says easily, knowing it’s a bit of a dick move. Thankfully, Steve barrels on like he hasn’t heard Tony at all.
“He—” Tony takes a deep breath, shrugs helplessly. “Has a nasty headache. But he’ll definitely live and is probably fine. He’s only here so they can review the scans.”
We’re here now, Tony thinks. That’s gotta be worth something, after everything that’s happened, right?
“Yeah, of course, just gimme, like. An hour. Two hours,” Tony says. Rhodey snorts. “Debrief went well though? I was half thinking they’d try to drag their feet on some of Steve’s protocol changes they already agreed to. And I swear to Odin if we lose all the progress we’ve made with Rogers I will personally fight the entire UN again—”
“Oh,” Sam says, “I’d pay to see that.”
There’s a murmur in the crowd, and another reporter asks how the Avengers are to be trusted with snap decisions if they take months to agree on anything. Thankfully, though, Natasha steps in to answer.
She does, but there’s
There are so many of them now, Tony can’t help but wonder at as he looks around. They’re in one of the more casual conference rooms—the one with carpet and the plush wheely chairs and a coffee maker on the counter by the wall.
Steve blinks up at him and, after a moment, it looks like he’s trying to shake his head.
“That’s a lot of power to give someone over the team,” Steve says, and—there we go, Tony thinks. Steve’s back in problem-solving mode, out of crisis territory. “We’d have to pick psychologists carefully.”
“As an accent color, at most,” she says indignantly, flapping her small hand at Scott. “Red was Iron Man’s first.”
Steve opens his mouth, but can’t get any words out. He nods instead. Bruce may or may not be shrinking off to the side, but Steve can’t muster the energy to turn. And then the armor grabs him up in a hug-and-fly so swiftly that Steve’s eyes are burning. If anyone asks it’ll be from windburn.
Steve bumped into him again, but didn’t move away, didn’t stutter through an apology. His index finger arched to brush the back of Tony’s wrist. Tony stared at it, too afraid to look up at Steve himself.
He still looks freaked out, but Tony’s immensely glad his name comes out clearly. He moves around the doctor and grabs onto Steve’s hand, sweeping his thumb back and forth.
“Good,” Tony says. “You should go hang out with him, okay?”
Tony snorts and accidentally knocks his head back into some pointy part of Steve’s face.
“That bad?” Sam asked, and he looks more serious now, so Tony shrugs.
Steve’s torso-deep in the fridge, probably looking for something specific that’s already been eaten, when he speaks again.
“Go on to the rest of the building, keep the evacuation going.”
“You paid the others to sign?” Sam will ask in mock offense. “I see how it is.”
“That’s one way to put it,” Tony says. He leans his hip against the island counter and sizes Steve up. He looks…really fucking uncomfortable, actually. His posture is stiff and he’s looking straight into Tony’s eyes like he’s bracing himself.
“I’m going to make a coffee hot tub,” Tony declares, “with a gallon of sugar poured in.”
“Captain America’s bullying me,” Tony says. “Didn’t you do a PSA about bullying? You should really know better.”
Tony remembers, suddenly, the first debrief after they came back to the compound. T’Challa had been there at the time, but not Bruce, Bucky, Thor, Rhodey, or Peter. He remembers that first fight, too, standing around Loki, the original six of them, a united front for the first time. Even earlier than that, Tony thinks as he accidentally catches Steve’s eye from across the table, when they were on the Helicarrier, just the two of them, Fury throwing the bloody cards across the surface.
It’s gotten particularly bad since Siberia. He doesn’t feel like he’s seated in his own skin properly, and there’s an aching in his chest even though he knows better than to think it’s his old asthma, but damn if it doesn’t hurt just the same.
“Don’t know if anyone told you,” Tony says, and his voice should really be cracking right now, but maybe he wasn’t out of it for as long as he thinks, “but I don’t really do substances anymore.”
“You heard the girl,” he says. “Let’s get this over with.”
“Alright then, Cap,” he says, “what’s the game plan?”
“Building 1480, south end of the street,” she says.
“Funny,” Tony says. “That was Nat’s reaction.”
And that’s really what it comes down to, isn’t it?
at this point. He’s tried to stop before; it’s no kind of life he can justify.
“I guess so,” he says.
“Well you sure as hell didn’t fight very hard to stay, now, did you?” Tony spits. His hands are balled into fists, he realizes.
“—told you—”
“Right,” he says. “‘Course not.”
bounces around in Tony’s skull. Does Steve mean the team? Probably. It could also be a more personal
Tony just has to live.
During their talk, the fighting continues. Everyone’s splitting their attention to hear what Thor’s saying—except the Hulk, who doesn’t seem to care—and Steve stays close enough to pick up his every word. The pauses are too long between one person speaking and another starting, they’re all switching focus from their surroundings, their enemies, back towards their strategy.
“I—” Bucky says, and DUM-E decides to investigate the newcomer. “What’s—its name?”
“Oh, the pleasure’s all mine,” Rachel Lee assures him. Her eyes are piercing, first on Tony, then on Sam, and back again. “And how are you boys tonight?”
But Vision’s feet don’t need to touch the floor and he doesn’t need to breathe.
“Hold up,” Tony says, because Sam seems honest most of the time and open right now. Sam looks back at him, head tilted, and he leans in the elevator’s doorway so it doesn’t close him in or out. (It wouldn’t anyway, because FRIDAY’s running it, but the habit’s familiar to most people and hard to break.)
“Thanks, doll.”
Thor calls the aliens the Brood, and he talks about them as if they’re pests. According to him, the only way to stop this attack is to either kill every single alien present or to find the queen and either kill her or force her to order them to stand down. Steve explains what they’ve surmised about the the queen not being on planet.
Eventually, Tony takes a deep breath and reasons with himself. Steve has been doing so much better, he’s got the right idea lately even if his execution doesn’t exactly match up, or that’s the perception Tony thinks he has when he’s not in the middle of losing his shit.
Tony can barely believe this Steve Rogers is the same man he’s known for years now, the one who politely (if a little tersely) refused Tony’s offer of a room in the Tower. (The fact that Tony gave him one anyway is irrelevant; it’s not like he ever pressured Steve or the others to use the accommodations.)
“Arm?” Clint says. “I was talking about Steve.”
“Yes, obviously,” he whispers. And at full volume, “That’s not really an answer to the question though, is it?”
“Okay,” Steve says on a rough exhale. “Right.”
“And he got along with Howard,” Rhodey says.
Rhodes, I’m serious. That’s not for you to know.”
“Tony,” Steve says, just as kind, “hi.”
Steve takes another step toward Tony and Tony triggers the signal for the armor.
He catches Nat’s eye then, and she’s sitting next to Bucky, their bodies angled toward one another, and she smiles at him, not soft or sympathetic, but
He does neither. He moves back half a step to let her in, she doesn’t apologize but she does enter, and they dance around each other for four days before Natasha decides enough is enough. It’s well after midnight and well before dawn when she shows up in the workshop, eyes growing wide when her old codes still get her in (Tony knows, there’s video proof, he’s seen it). Tony turns to meet her and she’s brought coffee, doesn’t even try to hand it to him, just sets it on the nearest workbench, and Tony’s heart warms despite himself. Probably because he’s had no other human interaction in those four days, but still.
“Yeah,” Steve said softly. “Just…overload, or something.”
“Point number two for the post-Accords Avengers,” Tony says. “One more and I might actually believe it.”
and it just reminds him of the devil.
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches Sam’s wicked grin.
“I’m just being melodramatic,” Tony says.
Tony tosses an elbow Steve’s way and rolls his eyes.
“Apologies. Are you referring to the Avengers or the bots?”
“You know,” Steve says, “I don’t actually mind the fighting if at the end we’ve cleared things up or reached a compromise or, I don’t know, something.”
“Get in line,” Tony and Bruce chorus.
“Oh,” he says, and blinks. “Where’s Sam?”
“I know, Steve,” she says, squeezes his arm. “Believe me. I do. You need help, though, and it’s Extremis. It’ll take time to…run its course.”
“How long until you leave again?” Tony hisses, almost a whisper. Steve blinks hard, once, like a flinch. His lips press into a thin line, the expression he usually gets before he starts yelling, so Tony keeps talking, quickly. “Last time you took damn near the entire team. You really think it’s a good idea to make you integral to my ability to sleep?”
Tony shrugs.
The fighting grows less heated as Thor and the queen make their way to the epicenter of what now could be called a small war zone. They’ve all fizzled down to halfhearted swings and defensive blocks by the time anyone speaks.
“Okay but why does it sound like you’re about to ask me to murder a man?” Sam says, and he still sounds lighthearted about it, but suspicious, and rightfully so.
Tony’s throat makes a clicking sound when he tries to swallow. He shakes his head. Bruce laughs for real this time, sounding like he can’t control it, like it’s bubbling over, and he shakes his head back at Tony.
“The trial where we’re alone and emotionally vulnerable has been—overdone,” Tony says slowly, more carefully.
He doesn’t stop until Tony focuses on him.
“You definitely missed your coffee date,” Rhodey says.
“I never said I’d keep you from fighting killer robots in the future,” Tony reminds him. “In fact—enabling. The suit upgrades count as me helping you do exactly that. You can’t work against me here, Cap, you gotta work with me.”
“Oh.”
“Uh,” Bucky says. “Yeah."
3. Steve cites the World Security Council and thinks they should have one active duty team member on the UN committee that discusses and ultimately decides where the Avengers go and don’t go. (Tony nominates Natasha.)
“I don’t believe you,” she says. She’s downright
He goes up to his room and wonders after his freakout in the shop the day before. Things are better now, or at least pointed in the right direction, but there’s still a disconnect buried in there somewhere for Tony, an uncertainty lurking around, nipping at his ankles. He doesn’t know if there’s anything he can do to get it to go away entirely, but he’s tired of the way it keeps knocking him on his ass.
Steve hummed and it took over Tony’s senses again. He snuggled into the man. He was aware enough to notice when Natasha arrived, draping his blanket over the both of them. She took the plate of food and disposed of it and then sat in Tony’s spot on the couch.
“Yeah, hi. Um, good morning,” Tony says.
“Ugh, yeah, whatever—
"Team breakfast," Steve says after a beat.
“Just your pride.”
when she opens the channel.
“Our ETA’s 20 minutes,” Bruce says. “Report when you’re on-site.”
definitely isn’t a verb and the fact that there’s definitely an existing word for what he means because fuckit, Steve will understand either way. “But most people would if faced with the reality that your side's fixin’ to commit genocide.”
Fuck what you feel, he tells himself, and walks right up to his reflection, bracing his hands on the sink. Fuck it, if this makes you more efficient, helps you live longer, then just don’t waste it.
“But,” Steve continues, “when Tony Stark comes up to you and goes ‘hey, guys, Captain America’s birthday is on the Fourth of July’ everyone thought he was full of shit. Except Natasha, because she already knew it was true, it’s right there in my file. But my birthday comes and we’re all staying in the tower then, because SHIELD HQ is worse for wear, and my apartment got destroyed—but it’s my birthday and Tony comes in for some coffee and wishes me a happy birthday. And, seeing as it is my birthday and that’s not an unusual thing to say, I thanked him.” Sam’s smile seems a little more genuine now, like he sees where the story’s going. And it is a happy memory. It is.
“She is either a child who needs your protection,” he says, looking straight at Wanda, “or she is a sister-in-arms who must answer for her own actions.”
Tony grins.
“How did you choose these ones?” he asks and, okay, Bucky’s last session with an unknown therapist didn’t go exactly according to plan for anyone except Zemo. Tony’s throat loosens and he becomes just aware enough to feel the sweat dripping down his back, glad he’s in a suit dark enough to hide his sweat.
“Coffee’s a viable breakfast, but thanks,” Tony says. Clint puts the box back down and takes a quick drink of his own coffee.
“Steve, back off,” Sam said, voice low and insistent. Tony swore he was going to rip them apart too if they didn't knock it off. The air shifted in front of him then, and Tony thought
“Aw, shit,” he says, and opens the comm line up again, just as he gets smacked into a tree.
“I—That’s not true,” Steve tells him firmly.
There’s a pause on the other side of the line that definitely does not bode well for Tony. Even straining, he can’t hear Steve breathing or anything. He’s just about to pull the phone away from his face to see if Steve had actually just hung up on him when Steve responds, hesitantly.
“FRIDAY, lights, please.”
“You didn’t need to do that,” Steve says quietly. He takes a step forward and Tony takes three back.
“So,” Tony says, and wills it to come out casual, easy, patented Tony Stark quality, “you still like making rash promises that you’d never break, right? Who am I kidding, that, that’s a pillar of your personality, of course you do.”
Instead, he sends,
Steve’s smile has shrunk, and he looks sad, but not overly so. Tony doesn’t know if this means he struck the balance or not.
“Fuck,” he says, flying up and away, twisting at the same time to look behind him. Two more, bringing the count up to twenty.
Tony lingers in the city, wandering around on foot, unwilling to give up the familiarity of the streets. It’s nice out, chilly, but with a warmth to the sun.
“Oh,” Steve says. And then, “Dear God.”
The tablet lies where Sam left it, and Tony watches it for a few minutes until the screen turns dark to signal its being locked. There are tablets all over the compound and they’re basically universal, fingerprint-locked things. Anybody can use any tablet—there’s generally a couple scattered through every room, in addition to the ones people have claimed as their own—but the information is private to each person. Still, it never hurts to watch the things until they’re asleep, even if FRIDAY’s generally keeping an eye out too. Eventually he does get up, takes the stairs at a slow trudge, and slides into bed with Steve, settling with his hip against Steve’s.
“If you honestly think I didn’t have a problem with that,” Steve says, shoulders rigid, arms uncrossed now as he stands up straight in the doorway, “then having a building dropped on your head must’ve given you brain damage after all.”
“Again,” he says, “this isn’t me trying to pass judgement, and while I’m not looking to open this up as group therapy—I don’t think a single one of us wouldn’t benefit from professional help.” Tony leans back in his chair, crosses his arms. “Everyone’s getting therapy.”
“And I should definitely take this SI trip off of Pepper’s plate and run off to Japan for a week and a half. Or until I forget everything about Steve.”
“Yeah but her perspective might be a little skewed, don’t you think?” Rhodey glances toward one of FRIDAY’s sensors. “No offense, Fri.”
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says quietly. Tony wants to take his name from Steve, wants to tell Steve that he doesn’t get to have it like that anymore, soft and insecure, like a friend.
Steve holds out a hand to help Natasha up. She takes it, but lets go the moment she’s upright under her own power again.
“That you did,” Bruce says. “Which is why I really need you to answer my questions here.”
Howard had said, looking down into the half-dissected guts of his Ford Flathead Roadster. He’d looked, to Tony’s brain then, unhappy. Feelings he now understands as a mix between exhaustion, overwhelmed, and anxious.
Bruce just stares at him for a moment, an amused tilt to his mouth that’s basically a laugh coming from him. Tony flaps a hand in his direction and gets up off the bed.
That lights something in Steve. It’s not anger, not really, but some kind of vicious hurt.
“Tell me?” Steve says, soft and gentle, like he knows how hard this is for Tony despite the fact that it shouldn’t be hard at all.
They both hit the target, of course. Clint actually does end up winning the competition, but only barely, and Tony suspects the victory rests squarely on Clint’s sheer level of experience with and intimate knowledge of the laws of physics, something Vision forgets from time to time since they only sporadically apply to him. Sam had gotten bored at some point and wandered off, but Bruce and Thor had been drawn in by the cheering and booing.
of work
In short, HYDRA’s been ruining Tony’s life since he was 21 at least. And he didn’t even go looking for a fight with them, not like Steve did, across enemy lines wearing a target on his chest. And here Tony is anyway, giving Bucky permission to come to the compound. Because he understands that Bucky was used, was just a tool in all of this. Steve can’t ask any more from Tony, can’t take advantage of his kindness without realizing what it cost him. So Rhodey’s right, and Steve can’t expect them to be in the same room together, not now and maybe not ever. He’s going to have to be okay with that, because the situation isn’t fair to any of them.
Steve’s eyebrows draw together as he concentrates.
“And then there were two,” Tony says.
“Tony,” Steve had said, a hand on Tony’s jaw and a smile on his face, big a dopey. God, he never thought he could be so happy in this new century, never thought he could look at another person and think,
“That usually depends on what the promise is,” Steve says, but he looks more amused than suspicious. His eyes flick a couple times to different parts of Tony’s body, and Tony can’t quite clearly remember where all of his injuries were—after a while it stops being individual points of pain and blurs together—but he thinks Steve might be cataloguing all the places Tony was hurt. Tony grins, easy peasy, and puts his hands in his pockets.
He totters up, uncoordinated from sleep and keeping his one hand occupied wiping at his chin, and goes to look at Sam’s phone where Steve’s holding it (Sam passed it off as he slowly crumpled to the floor, out of breath from laughing at something Tony doesn’t think is really all that funny).
“Nope.”
Natasha makes her excuses and heads farther into medical to see a man about Clint’s stitches. It doesn’t sound serious so Tony doesn’t ask. Sam falls into step with Tony.
“Which part?” Steve asks wryly. “Wanda flying the Quinjet?”
and not from the direction of the elevators (Tony’s almost afraid it’s going to be the Tower or the Triskellion all over again, both places Clint had the ventilation system memorized and utilized like convenient shortcuts despite being a full grown man). Clint laughs the carefree laugh he had before the Accords, before Ultron, and he starts to grab food without bothering with a plate.
“They have jaws like humans,” Scott says, “instead of mandibles.”
“Well—yeah,” Bucky says. “He kind of is these days.”
All in all, it’s a sensible list. It was probably a good thing that Steve sat with the lawyers first, so that someone other than Tony could explain why they can’t do certain things and why certain restrictions have to be in place. They even seem to have made Steve understand the ‘sign now, amend later’ part of the process, which Tony should really give them all raises for. He tells himself that it’s good they’re on the same page now, at least, even as part of him sets up a pity-party in a not-so-far-off corner of his mind, asking why Steve couldn’t have just asked Tony about this from the start, why Steve always assumes that Tony’s just trying to piss him off.
“I’cn hear y’,” Bruce says, mouth smushed into his pillow.
“That’s kind of the problem,” he says. “Believe it or not.”
“Until—Hercules saves him, right? In the end?”
“Yeah, man, this is a living room, not a barnyard. Cool it.”
“What do you need?” Steve asks, and now he’s talking slowly too, hesitantly, like he’s wading into water he knows is piranha infested.
“It’s still true,” Tony says, and he shrugs, telling himself not to tense up. “I got used to relying on you. I don’t know if it would’ve been simpler or more complicated with you here for everything, but I wish you’d been there anyway.”
“Listen, okay?” Rhodey says, and Tony was, thank you very much. “I’d say something corny like ‘the second Steve even thinks about screwing you over again, I’ll pull his dick out through his ear,’ but we both know you’d beat me to it.”
“Professionally, anyway,” he says. “Personally, the two of us were never really close, and he’s been nice enough about the whole me-disappearing-for-a-couple-years-unexplained thing. But the way he conducted himself as a leader of this team? Deplorable.”
“They won't let me see Tony,” he says. Natasha pauses, and then looks him very firmly in the eyes.
“And you’re the one who saved their sorry asses from exile,” Steve says. He appreciates that Steve doesn’t tell him he’s wrong, or contradict him at all. And Steve’s right, too—Tony and Natasha were the driving force that made it possible for everyone to come home. It shouldn’t be such a stretch to think they’ll all at least work with them to make this team work, but. But that’s exactly what Tony thought before, on the first go around with the Accords. Look where that got him.
“Well, thanks,” Tony says eventually. “You’ve officially been no help whatsoever.”
“Shall we?” Tony asks, nodding toward the door.
Tony doesn’t say.
“Oh, my God,” Bruce says, chuckles humorously. He slips his forefinger and thumb under his glasses to pinch the corners of his eyes.
Despite all jokes to the contrary, Tony’s not that small of a man. He’s not super tall, true, but he’s got enough bulk to him that he’s never worried much about it. And he’s been in a bed with men before, of course, but Steve is—different. Rather large, solidly built, exceptionally powerful, even in rest. Tony feels downright wrapped up. Held.
above fixing armor but below vital equipment repair for the rest of the team.
The reality is closer to this: that feelings aren’t always justified or rational and that, no matter how much reassurance he has, sometimes he needs more.
“Um, yeah, okay. For sure.”
“The Brood has a standing treaty with Asgard, apparently,” Vision says. “Neither party seems overly eager to breach it.”
“No,” Bruce moans, and for a terrible second Tony thinks he’s having some sort of nightmare, but then he follows it up with, “I was listening, I promise. Jus’ resting m’eyes.”
Bucky stays just as quiet, only answering the occasional question Tony throws his way (he always answers promptly, though, no lag in his responses to indicate that he’s freaking out), and doing exactly the movements Tony instructs him to do, and only those movements.
“Right,” Natasha says, and she sounds like herself now, if tired. After a moment, when it becomes clear that most people in the room are too shamefaced to speak in the wake of Rhodey, she continues, “It’s about teamwork and accepting responsibility for yourself. Even if most of us could be persuaded to opt for therapy, all it takes is one stubborn asshole not and flying off the handle to ruin the months and
“He’s really gonna help?” Bucky asks.
Reality’s still split in half, and he sees both Steves in front of him, the one who cares and the one who can’t be bothered. It’s driving him mad.
He grins to himself and reaches for the bottle of Dr. Pepper by the leg of the coffee table. It only takes a couple of minutes for Sam to text him again.
“Pretty good, all things considered,” he says, grimacing at Tony’s plate. “Dude, that is unnecessary and hurtful. I promise it’s edible.”
“Not at all,” he says immediately.
Tony hadn’t slept a whole bunch the night before. A couple hours, but then he was awake again, a little restless, and so he’d slipped out of bed hours before Steve, snagging a coffee and heading for the workshop. Bucky’s arm is more or less done and ready for him (unless any other problems arise) and Tony’s doing suit redesigns, making sure everyone’s got a reinforced, stabilizing collar, with thick, reinforced Kevlar. The trick is making sure it doesn’t hinder mobility or visuals too much. A balancing act, the way he’s doing it now. He feels, distinctly, that there’s a better way to approach the problem. Maybe someone else will have a better idea. Maybe he’ll bring it up later, depending on who’s at dinner. Maybe he’ll email Shuri, see if she has any viable suggestions.
“You know what else?”
The hand is back on Tony’s shoulder, and he lets himself be pulled to standing and shuffles around to give them room.
“I can’t believe,” Tony says. “I grew up in Manhattan. I only moved coasts when my parents died, oh, my God, for an entire year after we met I thought that was why you didn’t like me.”
“I’m definitely offended,” Steve says, though his growing grin says otherwise. “And I’d argue if it were any less true. Man, I used to drive my ma up the wall. Bucky, too.”
Tony blinks.
Bruce sighs.
“Yeah, so? I’ve got dibs, I’m calling it. As in: before Pym. God, please don’t let her work for Pym.”
“Or, I mean, at least the prototype for it. But this is about as far as I can get without you trying it on and answering some questions about it. Got the scans from T'Challa and some input from Shuri, so everything should be pretty up-to-date, but obviously neither one of them can tell me whether it'll be comfortable or shift your center of balance, and so.”
Tony gets it, okay, he gets that this is maybe a sore subject. As someone who made it onto the team by the skin of his teeth—Iron Man, yes; Tony Stark, not recommended—he can sympathize with the flash of fear some people in the room must be feeling. Wanda, for one. Bruce too, probably, with how little self-worth the man carries around.
“Ah,” Steve says. “So. You said he tested out the Hulk room already?”
Tony’s thigh feels like it’s burning from the surface down by the time Wanda comes over and lifts a huge hunk of wall off their lower legs. They’re on their feet now, under their own power, and Tony’s rather impressed with himself. He’s restless and twitchy, and he wishes he could keep still, or that he could make it not hurt. He reaches a hand up to run through his hair and is met with the dull
“G’morning,” he mumbles to the room at large.
“You should eat something,” Steve told him.
And Steve’s standing bare meters away. Tony watches in slow motion as Steve’s eyes widen and he starts to put up the shield like that’s going to help at all. Too slow, Tony thinks, but fires up the repulsors anyway.
“Oh, Jesus fuck,” Tony hisses. This is not what he came here for. He didn’t even mean to come here. What happened to that resolution he made about thinking things through? He was supposed to go to his ’shop, to run some more tests on himself or distract himself until he restored some kind of equilibrium.
Tony’s throat itches like his gears aren’t meshing. There’s a hollow grinding somewhere deep inside, deeper than his weak heart and ruined ribs. Psychosomatic, he knows, so he keeps drinking coffee, cup after cup. It doesn’t stop the itch but it keeps his hands busy, keeps him from taking the Audi to the nearest liquor store, so he keeps drinking.
And that’s about the last thing he wants, so he turns on his heel and continues along. Natasha, out of either mercy or apathy (and, really, Tony’s occupying two realities right now; either one is just as likely as the other), doesn’t say a word as he turns to leave.
No more eggs means no more french toast, no more omelets, no more pancakes, no more quiche.
“I’m on 42nd,” Tony reports, already calling the armor from the trunk of his car. “I can be there in two minutes.”
“As I was saying,” Steve says, looking amused, “Tony’s been tweaking this car as long as I’ve known him.”
Today, they just couldn’t protect the people they needed to protect. Hopefully they did well enough.
“Evening,” Tony says, dipping his head in Sam’s direction before looking back at the tablet, like he’s doing very important, very engrossing work.
Bruce doesn’t answer and Tony takes a breath. It’s not like he expected an answer. It's not like there’s any answer Bruce could give that would make Tony feel better about it.
“Okay,” Steve says again. “We all need a break. Some food, a shower, a nap. Rhodey and I can stay and keep an eye on things, and FRIDAY can always let you know if anything changes.”
Tony sighs heavily, and figures he might not actually get out of this conversation with some flowery bullshit.
“Viz,” Tony says easily. “Nat keeps showing up and leaving again. We have breakfast together about once a week. The spider-kid’s down in the city, so I’ve seen him around.”
“Right,” Tony says, and he sounds fully back in sarcastic mode. “For that to happen I think we need a threat I can’t handle on my own.”
Good, Tony thinks, even though it’s not. He hates how much control he doesn’t have here, how helpless he seems to always be in the face of this man, this haunting come to life, preserved in the ice for decades just to come back and torment him, obviously. Because the universe can’t give him any kind of break. (Narcissist, his brain sings in his own ear. That ego again.)
“I’ll just get Pep to tell me,” Tony says threateningly. Happy scoffs.
FRIDAY lands them, then, and Tony might just remember what Alpha-6 is.
It’s easy to admit this to himself as he lays in Steve’s bed, the both of them covered in a clean darkness. He can feel Steve’s warmth this way, knows that this must be the warm Steve here with him, though he feels more like a small forest fire when the stimulus is limited like this.
“Where’s Steve?” he asks. He remembers— “The building, fell on us—”
“Sorry," Tony says, but he’s smiling and Steve’s laughing, so it’s not a big deal.
“Wanda,” Clint’s saying, “move around to the northeast for—”
Even then, he works his way up the ladder: press duty in pairs on a rotation. Nobody objects, though they look annoyed, until the implication that, historically (barring the signing of the Accords), nobody but Tony and Natasha have put out statements since the fall of SHIELD—thrown out there in a snide comment from Rhodey—sinks in a little bit. Still annoyed, they agree relatively easily.
“You declared,” Tony said. “Petulantly.”
“Uh, well—”
“You’re right,” Tony says, interrupting.
He spent a good twenty-odd years actively, forcibly
“Christ, Nat,” he says, settling his hands on her spine and shoulder blade. Sam is coming forward too at a more sedate pace. “I thought you were gonna backhand me.”
“Your mouth’s bleeding,” she told him quietly, even toned. “It’s going to get all over your favorite shirt.”
“It was,” Steve echoes. “And I blamed you for that too.”
“It looks like the alien is wearing him as a second skin,” Wanda says. She sounds ill, like she’s trying to detach herself from the situation. Nobody quite knows what to say to that.
1. Steve’s fine with the idea of making Avengers complete a training regimen before being considered field ready, but he wants the Avengers to be in charge of both the training and the decision as to who’s fit for field work. (Tony thinks they can swing this if they can come up with a standardized rubric for the training and actually stick to it.)
The living room’s empty when he gets there, a tablet under one arm and the HUD glasses on, but he’s not sure he should’ve expected anything else. It’s awfully late at this point, but with a whole compound’s worth of people sticking around these days, it’s never uncommon to run into at least someone, no matter the time of day.
There are things that need to be dealt with. The others need to sign the Accords or there are going to be problems. He should tell them that their rooms are still intact. He should ask T’Challa if he can stay until tomorrow or if he needs to get back to running his country. He should call to tell Rhodey he’s okay. He should sit Steve down and explain the changes in the Accords, the safeguards in place. But, for God’s sake, he’s still in the suit sans the helmet, and there are a couple of plates bent inwards and jabbing at his fucked ribs, so he turns on his heel as smoothly as he can and gets in the elevator.
Soon enough, they’re calling out any feature they can think of, Tony throwing in specs when something catches at the corner of his brain and Steve offering simulation scenarios as they go.
He thinks Bruce knows all this anyway.
"Breakfast," Tony says.
He tries to roll out from under it, but he’s still in the middle of a half-demolished wall. Bits of the hybrid fall onto him, and he has to use both arms to push the bulk of it off, yelling as he does so. He uses the repulsors to propel himself to standing again, instead of putting any more weight on his arms.
Tony looks up, smiles, slings the grease rag over his shoulder, and wipes his hands on his jeans.
“Yeah, buddy,” Tony says, oil can in hand, “I know.”
“On my mark, I want you to release it,” Tony says. Wanda looks at him like he’s lost his mind. “I’ll hold it while you get a look. ’Kay?”
Even so tired she’s about to pass out, Natasha finds the energy to look smug.
This is, thankfully, one thing Tony’s been thinking about for a little while now. He’s glad they’re facing the same direction so all Tony has to think about are his words and the tone he uses.
“We’ll see,” he says, even though he knows she’s right. If they end up giving away reactors it should be to people or cities who can’t afford it. (See? He knows how running a company works.)
Clint’s moved back onto a rooftop, lower to the street this time, a perfunctory precaution against the lightning lighting up the sky, but things go smoother with his voice in their ears. He catches patterns first and describes them best. Tony thinks he might’ve broken a couple ribs, too, but nobody says it outright.
He thinks of his teammates, too, once he’s desperate and melancholy enough. Of Nat, while she was undercover as Natalie Rushman, how she always seemed to know which times of night were the worst for the pain, when he would slump onto the couch in the workshop and feel it in every inch of his blood, heavy, like his bone marrow had made a deal with gravity for some extra attention, when it felt like a million tiny anchors were tied to his blood vessels dragging him deeper and deeper into his own head with the knowledge that one night, it would take him all the way down, until he’d drown for real, until the night when he suddenly wouldn’t make it till morning—and Natasha would come in wearing something tight and low cut, brandishing tea, and she’d stare at him and say slightly unnerving things until Tony took it and drained the entire mug.
He sees his opening to leave and takes it, striding toward the elevator only to be stopped by Steve’s hand on his shoulder. Or, Steve’s hand in front of his shoulder. Tony more runs into the flat of Steve’s palm than he’s actually grabbed by the man. It knocks the breath out of him ever-so-slightly, but it gets his attention.
“Hit it then, babycakes,” Tony says, and tries to pretend he remembers which subprotocol Alpha-6 is. FRIDAY probably knows best, though. He trusts his girl.
He’s overwhelmed, and he shouldn’t be, can’t be. He still has teammates in the field for Christ’s sake.
And then people were back and talking but they had strong smelling food, too. Tony blinked at his screen. He was reading the words, and some level of his brain was retaining information, but he felt a little like he was floating.
He can even hear her footsteps echoing in the entryway. She sounds hesitant, but Tony knows she’s just trying not to spook him.
Steve snorts like the dork he is and Tony grins in response.
“Don’t care,” Wanda says. “I’m going to kill him.”
People filter in shortly after that, and Steve pinches his own thigh
“Copy that,” Clint says.
“It’s a good starting point,” Steve says. “The psychologist, the forums for new members.” When he trails off, it seems thoughtful. “None of that fixes the—imbalance of day-to-day operations though.”
There’s a moment of absolute stillness, leaden with awkward anticipation, so foreign and strange yet safe that Tony has to appreciate it. Here he is, laying in Steve’s bed, having early-night conversations in a dome of privacy and darkness—and he honestly has butterflies in his stomach. It’s a pure, clean feeling, opposite the chaotic way reality split earlier.
get to decide—” Wanda says.
Tony wishes he knew the right thing to do. He wants one of them to show up and tell him what to do. Ultron was a complete failure. If he hadn’t been brought online too soon, maybe it would’ve worked out, but nobody cares about how great Ultron almost was. Vision comes close, he certainly is astounding, but not the shield around the world Tony was going for. Vision’s a person, a being, and that certainly is a miracle, but an entirely different kind. Tony’s getting older, no matter how well he takes care of himself, and he needs a solution, several solutions, he needs to know they’ll be okay. This is only one contingency, a stopgap at best, but it’s all he’s got so far.
“What made Rogers lose his mind? Any idea?” Rhodey says.
Steve’s close now. They’re both holding on to the same branch of the same tree. The sun, still climbing in the sky, is bathing Steve in warm light. He looks younger than when the team first reunited, Tony thinks. More like the version of Steve who came fresh out of the ice, but softer, more familiar with the world around him. He wonders where the hell Steve’s frown lines went. Does the serum just smooth them over when his face isn’t being held like that constantly?
“It’s Iron Man!” she shrieks. “Iron Man! Hi! I’m glad you’re not a zombie!”
“Hm?” Tony says, curious despite himself, hoping Steve takes it as encouragement.
“Captain Rogers appears to be at the door, Boss,” FRIDAY says.
Steve sends back right away. It lets Tony breathe, think, right choice, Stark. And then,
“Steve, you’re asleep,” Tony says, and lets his vocal cords carry the words this time. It’s not much louder than his whisper, really, but it carries the sound of his voice. “It’s just a dream…albeit a very bad one.”
Steve’s room feels more like a universe. He can’t fathom the idea of space beyond the walls here, the grounds of the compound, the vastness of the upstate sky, the terrifying reality of space-space beyond that. This, Steve at his back and the blanket over him, the slight hum of the controlled climate keeping the building warm. There’s so much here, an entire landscape. He could stay here all night, wide awake as he is, and not run out of things to experience.
They chat for a while longer, about the American incarceration system, frisbee golf, using superheroing as an extracurricular activity. They’re not up for a very long time, though they somehow move through topics in a sincere, rapidfire kind of way lent to the unfiltered thoughts people have in the middle of the night. Soon enough, Sam makes himself some hot chocolate and heads back to his room, telling Tony to get some rest.
called me up, remember?”
Steve looks—confused, maybe. Concerned? Definitely vulnerable. Tony can’t tell, and his heart is starting to pick up the pace again.
“Understood, Boss.”
“You don’t…do you cook?”
And then he turns resolutely and walks into his own room, shutting the door firmly behind him and leaning against it for a second, reminding himself to breathe.
“It’s another thing I said not-so-nicely,” he admits. “But I’ve been talking with Helen Cho and T’Challa already, we’ve got a few treatment plans outlined. T’Challa just doesn’t wanna thaw the guy out on my word alone.”
“So, what—did you just nap all day long down in your workshop?” he asks. “Or did you just wake up?”
Bruce leans his shoulders back against the wall and crosses his arms.
“Eh,” Tony says after a few seconds of thoughtful silence. “Team full of gods and assassins—you hold the reins too tight…”
“You’re bleeding," Steve says. He sounds hurt and Tony, for the life of him, can’t figure out why.
“Nat?” Steve says, gasping around the sharp flare of pain. It takes a few laborious seconds to get them all untangled, but they do, and then Steve helps Natasha scoot back so that her shoulders are up against one of Sam’s chairs. She leans her head back against his hip and huffs out a breath. Steve crouches in front of her.
They do get up eventually, a couple minutes later when the coffee machine chimes (a sound that’s usually muted, but Natasha appears to be in rare form today), and Steve smiles at him as Tony grabs his hands and hauls him to his feet. Bruce watches them drearily when they come into the kitchen, and Thor’s eyes twinkle as he hands off a mug of steaming coffee to Tony, but nobody says anything about it. Wanda wanders in a couple minutes later, and it’s nothing more than a normal morning, but the feeling stays with Tony, flares up every time he catches Steve’s eye and gets a smile from him. He smiles back, heart hammering in his chest.
“Hellohihey,” Tony says. “You particularly busy right now?”
thank you TREMENDOUSLY to anyone who's still reading (or to anyone who's just found this fic for the first time). i believe we're nearing the end here, and i'm so very bad at endings, but i've been writing this for too long to simply abandon it, and i couldn't let myself do that to y'all. so, even if it's taking a while, thank you so so much for bearing with me, and i hope you all enjoyed this chapter.
“I’ll walk with you,” Tony says. She doesn’t object and it’s only a few blocks back to the main SI offices. Tony revels in the feeling of the city; he’s been a rather impressive hermit this year. Probably not good for the company image that he’s been MIA. Pepper must really have been worried about him to not have brought it up at all. He resolves to do better, now that he’s not afraid in his own home and doesn’t think he’s going to drop dead or lose his mind.
“Hang…out,” Tony echoes.
“He is now,” Steve says, smiling back at Tony.
“Tony,” he says.
“I’m gonna go downstairs now,” Tony says. Steve blinks at him and Tony turns to look at Steve’s hand where it’s somehow still touching him, though it’s slid down to rest against Tony’s bicep.
alone; this isn’t the martyr version of him who designed the AVALON protocol, who anticipated scorn for being wounded or unable to fix everything; this isn’t the ghost of himself who’d haunted the new Malibu house for weeks, unable and unwilling to utter a word.
“God, yes,” Rhodey groans. “It was awful. And I think we need to reimagine the coolant system because it started overheating again, and maybe that’s a nice feature in the middle of winter when I’m stranded outside, but mostly it’s just going to give me some wicked burns.”
“Part of listening to you is asking,” Steve says, and Tony supposes that does explain it; Steve’s nothing if not the most all-in, stubborn bastard Tony’s ever met. If he said he would listen he’s at least going to try. “Historically, we’ve danced around these conversations and let each other get away with it. That obviously hasn’t worked for us.”
Tony choked on his own laugh for that. “What on earth for?”
They settle into a silence that’s only mostly awkward, and Tony turns to his food and focuses on pretending that it doesn’t bother him at all. He’s halfway through his second slice when Bucky talks again.
“Not really,” Tony says. “I stopped answering his messages a couple days ago.”
“I know,” Pepper says, cutting him off. “God, Tony…For all the world likes to pretend otherwise, you’re the most ridiculously loyal person I know. The thought never even occurred to me.”
He breathes through his instinctual response—
Very, very suddenly, Wanda’s standing, her hands curled into claws and her hair floating just the tiniest bit.
Tony’s definitely not watching out of the corner of his eye when Sam claps a hand to Bucky’s shoulder and pushes him all the way inside the kitchen.
Tony walks into the kitchen wearing some designer t-shirt with a pug on it and a blazer over top. It’s too early for even Steve and Sam to be awake, but Clint’s sitting, fully dressed, at the island with an open box of cereal.
“Get out of my house,” Tony says, not yelling, not yelling, low and tired and fierce. He knows he’s the one who brought up Bucky, but it makes him ill to hear Steve calling the man by his nickname, which is ridiculous, Tony’s being ridiculous, but this is his home, his safe space, and Steve just flew all the way to Malibu to say Bucky’s name in his voice inside of Tony’s living room, just to ruin everything.
“Breakfast?”
“Just as much as anyone else in this room,” Sam says loudly, “yeah, I did.”
True to form, the common floor was a dance of people and light and noise. Tony strode in and sat in a corner of the couch, next to Vision.
“Yeah,” Steve says, one shoulder ticking up in a lazy shrug. “We could…watch a movie. Or something.”
“Let’s have a Hawaiian pizza waiting at the house when I get there.” He picks up a tablet and starts looking around at the in-progress projects and which ones he can work on in the Malibu workshop. “And some soda.”
“Get in line,” Tony says, voice a little harder than he means for it to be. “If you think I was getting any kind of joy or fulfillment out of the setup then—then I don’t know what to tell you. We thought you were gone, and Ross is the Secretary of State. We can’t not communicate with him, and it’s not like the Accords were his brain baby, not by a—”
“Shut up,” Natasha says, putting on a bored tone even though everyone here knows her better than that. “We talked about this, boys. If you’re going to jump out of a plane, use the buddy system. Let someone know.”
Cons: it dwarfs Tony’s not insubstantial frame, and has a SHIELD logo on the front.
Tony’s never felt more like he belonged somewhere, like he was wanted and not just tolerated. (Valued. The word for this: valued.)
“Nope,” Tony said, clipped, only then realizing that his eyes were, in fact, closed.
He brushes his teeth when he gets out, and then pauses, eyeing his pill bottles. His scars are MIA, sure, but Tony doesn’t know what other parts of his physicality have changed. Does he even need the heart medication still? If he doesn’t, and he takes it anyway, will that fuck something up? But what if he does need it? That’ll be the first thing he figures out when he gets down to the lab, he decides, and quickly swallows a couple pills just in case.
And this isn’t out of left field or uncalled for. Tony asked about three weeks ago, while he was still in New York, if Scott wanted to see the workshop. Because, here’s the thing, Scott Lang is incredibly smart. And not only that, but he’s creative too. Kind of a dolt in social situations but, then again, some people would say the same about Tony, and they’ve exchanged enough emails by now for Tony to see what a good guy Lang is. The man’s in this for all the right reasons, and he wants to make his daughter proud of him, and each time Tony hears another story he gets that now-familiar flare of anger for Steve.
Sam drags his eyes away from Tony to shoot his disbelief at Steve. This time, Tony takes pity on him by pouring another cup of coffee and handing it off.
“Oh, you go for angel-women,” Rhodey allows, “but the men? Do I need to remind you about Tiberius Stone? He exists, he was a thing.”
my eternal gratitude once again to
Third is any allies they may have acquired for the fight. Same rule applies if there are any key players. Fourth is any enemies they can save. It doesn’t happen often and when it does it’s mostly goons surrendering when they know they’re outnumbered. The parameter is mostly there for the sake of thoroughness.
“Will you listen to me?” Tony snaps back.
“Lang,” he says, “that is the last kind of appliance you’ll find in the compound. Rule of thumb: consider every Sherlockian possibility before you assume magic.”
No medication allergies. Yes, he does have a history of head trauma (they all do at this point). He’s not on any medications. No pre-existing conditions.
“They’re gonna want to run some tests,” Rhodey says. “Maybe monitor you for a couple more days.”
“Scarlet Witch,” Wanda says. “Minor injuries. I can stay behind.”
“Me too,” she says, squeezes him tighter. “What the hell.”
“Tony,” he says, sounding like he’s in pain.
“No,” he says, and Steve lowers himself from his elbows and lays properly on the concrete of the roof. Tony does the same, resting his hands on his stomach.
“Tony?” Steve says, and the shoulder rotates as Steve reaches around, putting a hand on Tony’s back and, oh, hey, isn’t that pleasant? Nice and kind and warm and soft? A tear slips through the inside corner of his eye, off the bridge of his nose, and splashes onto the rock he’s sitting on. It’s insane, but with Extremis, he can actually hear it.
but if he were any less science-oriented in his worldview, he might say his earlier anxiety attack was a gut instinct because things had been going too well and he just knew something had to give.
“Please, Tony. T’Challa is sufficient. I’m no God.”
“Not if—” Scott starts.
Steve’s eyes are wide, watchful, and his shoulders are almost up to his ears. He looks afraid, ready for Tony to laugh in his face, but maybe genuine, too.
“Did I—miss something here?” Scott asks eventually. Steve’s settled himself against the arm of the couch where Tony’s sitting, arms crossed, visibly trying to look innocent. Tony can’t help but smirk at him. (The thought creeps up on him, that Steve’s apparently only good at lying when he’s got the time to plan it out, but—Jesus, he needs to chill out, because at the same time it’s incredibly endearing and so very Steve.)
Steve grabs a handful of Tony’s shirt, then, and makes this
“Hey, Friday,” he says, then pauses. “What time is it?”
Steve turns and there’s Bucky, standing in the middle of the corridor in jeans and a t-shirt with one of the sleeves pinned up where his arm is still missing. His entire field of vision swims for an extended moment before he manages to lean back against the wall. Distantly, his back flares with pain, and he needs to get that looked at, it’s more than road rash.
“This isn’t a lecture,” Tony says, motioning for them to put their hand down, “please, God, don’t do that.”
“Can’t sleep, then?” Bucky says, and he’s carefully only half looking at Tony.
“Like a rock,” Tony says, letting the weight of his head flop forward onto Steve’s chest. Steve removes his unpinned arm and stretches again, humming low in his throat.
Then he catches sight of Pepper. She’s pale, rigid against the wall, staring at some place right over Tony’s bed, and he replays what Bruce just said in his head.
