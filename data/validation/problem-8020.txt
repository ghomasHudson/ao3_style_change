"I will see what I can do, Captain," T'Challa said. "But, if I may, I do believe I am already aware of the theory your friend here is about to postulate."
"My main function is to monitor the transfer of energy from the tesseract to the individual satellites, and then from the satellites to the various national power plants," JARVIS replied. "But Master Peter created me with a virtually infinite capacity for expansion, so the possibilities are theoretically limitless."
"Thanks," Liz answered. She jerked her head towards a rather grand staircase that led to the second floor, the bottom three steps covered in a massive pile of coats and jackets. "Um, you guys can put your jackets there, and there's pizza and drinks in the kitchen. Most of the team is in there, so…"
As soon as everyone had filtered out of the room, Steve took Tony's hand, placing it in the crook of his elbow as they stepped over to Peter's bed. He had been trying to prepare himself for what Peter might look like ever since Colonel Phillips had told them what had happened, but as soon as he was truly able to lay eyes on him, all of Steve's mental preparation flew right out the window.
Steve swallowed hard as he glanced over at Bruce, who gave him a nod.
Pym Particles. Tony had heard Howard whining about them so many times as a teenager that he still occasionally heard him in his sleep. The fact that Howard was never able to replicate the formula that Hank used to create his magic shrinking particles had nearly driven him mad with jealousy and resentment, only adding to the gargantuan pile of shit that Howard had carried around with him like some kind of ratty security blanket. His entire career Howard had surrounded himself with other scientists, anyone who he considered as smart or smarter than he was, in an attempt to keep his enemies closer, so to speak. Anyone who Howard felt he could learn from—or steal from—was fair game, no matter where their true loyalties fell.
Steve stepped out of the bathroom then, proceeding to strip out of his clothes and into a pair of the loose pyjama pants that he usually wore to bed. Tony had gotten him a few new pairs for Christmas, including a pair designed after Tony's Iron Man armour which were Tony's new favourites. Steve always looked amazing in blue, but he looked pretty damn good in the Iron Man red too.
"But Peter doesn't, Tony!" Steve insisted. "He just doesn't, and especially not like this, so something must've happened that lured him out here!"
If Tony thought that the fully-clothed, almost lumberjack-like Steve Rogers he met earlier that day was so good-looking that he managed to awaken even Tony’s stone-cold heart, then he’s positively
thought Tony, a question he quickly answered with a resounding
"Actually, I don't think we're gonna be able to," Peter said. He glanced down at the panel he'd been trying to decipher for over an hour. "'Cause if I've been able to figure this out correctly, which I think I have—"
Minus Peter's months-long coma, of course, there at least was that. But Peter was having a hard time shaking the thought that the lake incident was his fault. He'd been the one begging Papa and Dad for that last round of waterskiing, trying to master dropping a ski, and then…
Tony smiles, sending another bolt of warmth down Steve’s spine.
They took a three day break after that trip at Tony's suggestion, allowing Steve some time to rest and recoup—and punch a few punching bags into oblivion, with Tony's permission—while Tony tinkered around some more with the compass, using the data they had already collected to try and further narrow their area of focus.
“Tony—”
Tony winced. He'd noticed lately that Steve had been finding Tony's frequent jokes about his perfection less and less amusing, and so had been trying to cut back on them. But it'd been a lot harder than he'd thought since to him, Steve really
"Lorne here, Captain."
"Are you sure?" asked Steve. "'Cause I'm sure that we could—"
"Oh, and I have just received an incoming text message from Master Peter," added JARVIS. "He is very politely requesting that you feed his fish for him."
"Huh?" Scott said, his shoulders dropping less than a second later. "Oh, geez, I am so sorry. You probably think that I'm just… um… yeah. Yeah, I'd love to come inside. That'd be—that'd be great. Thanks."
“Ah, JARVIS?  How the hell’d this thing get… like this?” Tony asked, gesturing towards the monitor.  “‘Cause this sure as hell isn't what it looked like the last time I saw it.”
"C'mon, Steve," Tony muttered as he turned on his heel, knocking one of his hovering holograms aside as he retraced his steps. He'd had JARVIS run another diagnostic on his new nanite suit design after he hung up with Fury, and based on how well it had performed, he was planning on getting started on his actual suit as soon as he got off the phone with Steve.
"Yeah," Peter said, awkwardly rubbing his nose. Dad had given him permission a long time ago to just take whatever equipment he needed from the Stark Industries stockrooms as long as it wasn't a prototype or on backorder or something, but since Pepper took over as CEO he had always asked her first before taking anything. He didn't want some poor stockroom person getting fired if the meticulous records that Pepper kept didn't balance out.
"Well… no, not from outside the team," said Peter. He'd never actually thought of it like that. "I guess my papa's the oversight."
"That's what I'm thinking," Steve agreed. "This place used to be a prison decades ago based on the intel from Clint and Natasha, so it would make sense for there to be a guard tower stationed close to the entrance."
"There's four guards right outside this door, and four more at the bottom of the stairs," added Phillips. "I shouldn't be gone longer than a half hour or so."
came Papa's voice, a bit more level in tone but just as worried underneath. "
"It was because he was really, really small, Captain," Pietro cut in, just as Tony noticed that he was holding some kind of clear container in his hands, the kind that Steve liked to store his leftovers in. "I only noticed him because we were still outside, and I saw the snowflakes jump."
"Um, we don't do that here, Dr Banner," he said.
"Very well, Captain. Mr Stark has been warned."
Uncle Bucky's lips twitched into a smile. "Yeah, I have. Some of the guys in my Army squadron liked to say it when they thought someone was bullshittin' 'em. Why?"
Since the nose of Joseph's aircraft was facing the mountain he allowed Chester and Tomis to peel off first, intending to fly around the mountain before falling into position since the slingshot manoeuvre required less fuel than a direct about-face.
Tony quickly kicked off his pyjama pants and tapped Steve on the shoulder, indicating for him to lie back. He then slid Steve's pyjamas down his legs and climbed on top of him, his eyes fluttering closed when Steve grabbed onto his hips and rocked up against him.
"Good," said Tony. "JARVIS, what time is Steve's appointment with Sam?"
He had little doubt that HYDRA was watching them. In fact, they most likely had teams of agents assigned to monitor not only the Tower, but also the Compound and the D.C. building, as well as each individual Avengers' team member.
Tony nodded, biting his lip as he tipped his head against Steve's chest. As long as the drones were online and functional, things should be okay until the morning.
"Okay there, buddy?" Tony asked as Peter attempted to swing his backpack over his shoulder, nearly knocking himself off-balance in the process.
"Better not tell it like that to my dad," Peter warned. Dad had told both Peter and Papa that after his flight through the portal and the massive army he saw amassed there, he had no desire to ever go into space again.
“Ahh, Colonel Rhodes!” Obie said as he jumped to his feet, nearly tripping over the leg of his chair in his haste to set down his cigar.  “I wasn’t expecting to see you here this morning, Tony must’ve forgotten to tell me you were stopping by!”  He stepped around his desk, his upper lip curling into a sneer as he noticed Tony’s close proximity to Steve.  “And it seems like you’ve brought some of your Army buddies with ya, hmm?  I guess I always thought you weren't too friendly with the Army folks.  Something ‘bout an interbranch rivalry?  Or am I just making that up?”
"Yeah," agreed Rhodey. "The only problem is that I'm pretty much out of ammo now."
And it still worked even now, apparently, because barely a minute later Peter felt himself start to drift off. He forced one eye open, glancing up at Dad to find him with his eyes closed and his head tipped back against the headboard. He wasn't completely relaxed, with his tight jawline and stiff shoulders, but it was the closest he'd been since Papa was taken away, and Peter knew it was probably the best that he would get until Papa came home again.
Even bringing people back from the dead.
Grinning, Steve reached for his notebook and pencil. "I sure did," he said as he flipped to a clean page. "Would you like to draw something with me?"
"I'm sorry I wasn't there," Tony murmured into his neck.
"My dad doesn't get paid to run the Department of Damage Control," Peter said firmly. "The government and Stark Industries pays the rest of the employees, but my dad doesn't accept a cent for it. And the Avengers have never taken any outside support from anyone. Anything they have, they've either built or bought for themselves. They're a completely private organisation."
And then, the problems only get worse.  Because of his shoulder injury, Steve was forced to alter his stroke slightly to take some of the pressure off of it.  But as soon as it hits him that he’s already behind, he instinctively reverts back to his old stroke style, the very one that caused all of his shoulder problems in the first place.
"No, thank you. Um… can you start at the northernmost point and just move south along the coast, please? And go slow?"
Peter thought as he headed down the centre aisle, which just happened to be the Sci-Fi and Fantasy aisle, two of his very favourite genres.  He grinned as he noticed a complete boxed set of the
"JARVIS, can you please delete that news footage?" Steve asked. "I won't be needing it after all."
"Please!" he pleaded. "This is all happening because of me, so I need to make it right! You can help coordinate the first responders out there, but just make sure that Gwen's all right first, okay?"
"He has a theory regarding the purpose behind the initial attack on Wakanda," answered Steve. "And if he's right, then we'll need to make that our main focus for the time being."
"No!" Peter exclaimed, his eyes wide as he shook his head. "Papa, you don't understand! Thanos, he's gonna—!"
"Yeah, hon, I can give it a try," Tony said softly. "But it's anyone's guess if he'll actually give me an answer. He seems to enjoy the whole 'all-knowing' part of his job a bit too much, if you know what I mean."
"Peter," said Sharon. She tucked the chart to her chest and leaned forward, lowering her voice. "He's got a pretty bad heart, poor little guy. The night nurse said that she'd never seen a kid's face that blue before."
"Babe, how many times do I have to tell you that you don't need to apologise?" Tony said, kissing the top of his head. "And especially not to me. Believe me, I understand."
"Got another one, Стиви," he said. "And I'm pretty sure that's all of 'em in this section."
"What the hell?" he gasped, his heart thudding madly as he glanced around the room, attempting to search for the offensive item so he could pitch it against the wall or something. A second later Steve raised his arm from where it was draped across Tony's waist and proceeded to whack the alarm clock sitting on the bedside table with such accurate precision that Tony's jaw dropped open.
"No kidding, Mr Optimistic," said Natasha as she got to her feet a few metres away from Steve, brushing dirt from her uniform. "Now, let's finish this!"
“I… um… I’d—I think I’d like to—”
"I'm afraid I am no longer registering Master Peter's location, Captain," JARVIS said softly.
"So why don't you let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good," added Quill.
Colonel Phillips shot Howard a scathing frown. "As I was saying, whoever the scientist was in charge over there thought that instead of choosing some sickly guy on the verge of death to be their super-soldier, that he'd be extra smart and choose someone who was already proven to be strong. Well… what the scientist didn't take into account was the fact that the guy they ended up choosing was already half-mad, and—"
Besides that, Tony and Bruce had been on the verge of what Bruce was calling a pretty major breakthrough when they were getting ready to leave, and Steve hadn't wanted to interrupt him. It had been far too long since they'd had some good news.
And no longer was he in any of it alone.
"All right, Captain, in ya go," said Colonel Rhodes as he opened the car door, holding out his hand for Steve's arm. Tony quickly jumped out, hurrying around to help Steve into the wheelchair. With his poor vision he hadn't realised that Colonel Rhodes had brought him around to the special emergency entrance reserved for military personnel, so at least any of the people who saw Steve would know why he was there. As soon as Tony wheeled him inside three doctors sprang into action, setting up a solution to soak the gloves from his hands and cutting the boots from his feet as an ophthalmology specialist was called in to examine his eyes.
So he pushed his feelings aside, filing them in his mental compartment titled "Later", and kept his focus purely on Tony. Bathing him, dressing him, cajoling him to eat and then feeding him when he flat-out refused to eat on his own, Steve cared for his husband as though he were an invalid, because in many ways, he was. His overwhelming grief for Peter had him locked so tightly in its iron cage that not even Steve, with all of his serum-induced strength, could manage to break through.
"I had a great time tonight, Steve," Tony said as they arrived outside his office door.
"At your service, Captain," JARVIS replied softly. Even he seemed to be in mourning.
nonsense again?"
And that was something that Steve couldn't allow. He simply could not allow himself to fall into the same abyss as Tony, or there would be no one left to pull them back out again.
A reality where he had no son, and no husband.
"Tony got word that one of the defence drones fired about fifteen minutes before they were gonna leave to come pick you up, милая ошибка," said Auntie Nat. "And since JARVIS couldn't give them a concrete explanation of what the drone tried to fire at, Steve decided that they should go and check it out in person."
"I know that, young Peter," Grandma said gently. "And you shouldn't. Because if your father is even half the man that Steven tells me he is, then I am very proud to know him. And you as well. You're both quite remarkable."
"Well, that's correct, corpsman…"
"Okay, so—"
“But what could possibly be more important than Steve?” Peter shot back.  “What?”
“Tony?” Steve asks around the metal stuck in his mouth.  “Uhh, are you waiting for me to do something?”
"And that's because, let me guess, it can alter reality?" Tony asked.
"You can be that and still be an asshole, Steve," Sam cut in. "You're a damn brilliant strategist too, but I'd never call you an asshole. Stubborn as a mule, yeah. A bit on the cheeky side every now and then too, especially when you don't like to admit that I'm a better cook than you, but never an asshole. There's a big difference there."
"And if he happened to join the Avengers, sir?" he asked.
With a final surge forward, Steve lunges for the touchpad, hitting it square in the centre with the very tip of his middle finger.  As his momentum carries the rest of his body in, he curls his fingers over the gutter, sucking in a lungful of air as he turns to look at the clock.  He blinks several times as the results come into focus, at first too afraid to actually believe them.
"Sir, I have Captain Rogers on the li—"
Breathing in a deep breath, Papa pursed his lips and glanced over Peter's head at Dad, who gave him a single nod.
But it wasn't. It was very, very real.
"Just wish it didn't feel so… heavy," added Clint.
"Yeah. So?" answered Tony. He bit down on his bottom lip as Steve's deft artist's fingers worked their way underneath the pants and Tony's boxer briefs, still deliberately avoiding his already straining erection.
"Please allow me to introduce the rest of our team, if you don't mind," Steve quickly said. He introduced each of the rest of them in turn, explaining once he was done that Bruce was currently working with Thor and his people in New Asgard and had been unable to attend.
Gwen halted him with a harsh look. "Okay, now you're just being a bit over the top, don't you think? Peter, Dr Banner is the foremost expert—"
But since Steve didn't do any of those things, then he’s not truly brave.  He’s just a pretender.  An actor in a tight spangly suit prancing around a stage who for the last three years couldn’t even afford to continue paying his coach.
"My numbers are matching right up with JARVIS's," Steve said a moment later. "Looks like we're good."
"Yes, yes, we are," Steve said quickly. He gestured towards Carol. "Ladies first, Captain."
"It's nice to see you, Gwen," said Papa. "Be sure and tell your parents thank you from us, okay?"
"Pretty sure I've told you that more than once, honeybunch," Tony said. "And I'm also pretty sure that Pete will riot if his dinner gets delayed any longer than absolutely necessary, so we should probably get going on it."
“Oh, I can’t remember the exact name of it off the top of my head,” said Obie.  “You know, some Chief of the Army who’s gettin’ some award, or something like that.  Lots of brass’ll be there, though, so you’re gonna have to be on your A-game for schmoozing.  I’d recommend a blonde this time, they always seem to compliment you better than brunettes.  Maybe you can take that chick from
"Mmm," Tony grumbled, his eyebrows knitting together. He made an attempt to pull his hand away from Steve's grip, but Steve held firm, refusing to let go. "You shouldn't've bothered."
Of course, he hadn’t counted on Peter Stark setting foot inside it either, but that was already so beside the point it was almost laughable.  Steve had been aware that the infamous CEO of Stark Industries had a son, but what he looked like or how old he was wasn’t common knowledge even amongst his former commanding officers who regularly interacted with the man.  Steve supposed that right there should’ve been a pretty big clue as to how protective Tony Stark was of his only child, but given that Steve had never before been inclined to think anything positive about him, he simply hadn’t made that connection.
"Oh. Well, I suppose whatever works for them is okay."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you are right now in this classroom because you are in the top one percent of all Air Corps aviators. You are the elite, the best of the best. But, as I'm certain that you're all aware of by now, our great nation cannot afford to just sit comfortably on the fact that you are the best of the best because we must always be striving to be better." Colonel Phillips grimaced, as though he'd just tasted something unpleasant. "On that note, we do, on occasion, call in certain civilians who we have found to have a particular knack for predicting the trajectory of the enemy, both technology-wise and strategy-wise, and this right here just happens to be one of those civilians." He paused then, clearing his throat as he indicated the man standing next to him. "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your instructor, Mr Anthony Stark."
He also had a strong feeling that Tony was itching to poke around Shuri's lab a bit more, which was also not at all surprising.
For the first time in Steve’s life, everything seems to be going his way.
"Okay," he managed as he brought Peter's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it and then pressing it to his cheek. "Okay."
"Just rest a bit then, okay?" he whispered. "And maybe you'll fall asleep in spite of yourself."
Steve gave a nod, his jaw already clenched into his Captain America
"All right, buddy," Tony said, ruffling Peter's hair. "Then just sit back and try to relax, I'm sure Uncle Bruce'll be ready soon."
"Hey, Carol," Steve said as Tony gave her a short nod. "How's… ah, how's—?"
"Ah. Then I suppose it's okay as long as he doesn't throw a dart at your head," Gwen said, her eyes going wide as she looked around the massive suite, taking in the expertly laid out platters piled high with all sorts of yummy appetizers that Uncle Thor and Uncle Clint were already busy sampling.
"Huh?" said Papa, his eyebrows wrinkling behind his goofy glasses. "You two know that you tend to speak in code sometimes, right?"
"Peter—"
"Yes, it is," Shuri said, smiling as she held up her hand in a perfect imitation of the traditional Vulcan salute. "I assume you understand what this means, do you not, Peter Stark-Rogers?"
"I'm ready too, Tony," Steve said as he too leaned back in the water. "One more run just like last time."
"Well, I think you might be a bit biased," Steve said, the dimple on his right cheek making an appearance as he smiled. Tony was such a sucker for that dimple. If he'd’ve been a poet he would've written sonnets for that dimple. "But I'll admit I wouldn't mind getting to see that art collection sometime."
"This is a tactical
“You goddamn sick son of a bitch,” he said quietly.  “You don't have one.”
close, all he'd need to do is dip his head a bit, and—
"Is he—is he—?"
"Hey, Tony," Pepper said as soon as she appeared on the monitor. She looked just as elegant as ever, if not a bit more harried than usual. "What's going on?"
But Tony only shook his head. There was no way he could sleep with the way his mind was swirling, and especially not with Peter whimpering like he was being beaten every couple of minutes.
He felt Tony's lips press against his forehead. "All right, then tell you what. If you let me help you up so you can take care of what you need to take care of, I'll rub your head some more once we get back into bed. Sound good?"
talking anymore about that now," Dad warned, tossing Uncle Clint his
Steve’s eyes had been there, in the dim light of the Quinjet.  Since Peter was born, Tony hadn’t dated much, and it had been so long—years, really—since he’d had any real inkling of actual sexual desire that he had almost forgotten what it felt like.
"Oh gods, Tony," Steve murmured into Tony's neck. "That feels incredible!"
"Oh, really?" Tony snapped as he turned his back on the insufferable doctor/wizard, heading to what he assumed was the bridge. "And you don't happen to find that the least bit ironic, considering that goddamn rock you're wearing around your neck?"
"Where the hell is my son?" Tony demanded, finally finding his voice. "JARVIS says he's still at the school, but he's supposed to be with you."
Peter cringed.
"But you said that shouldn't be a problem," said Phillips. "That the new power sources wouldn't need to be swapped out."
"There was a very good reason why that drug was set to be destroyed, Mr Beck," Tony said evenly. "And I don't appreciate the fact that it wasn't."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, I guess," Peter said with a shrug. "I also think that I popped a couple stitches in my pyjama shirt when I put it on, so…"
"Just don't let it go to your head, okay Barnes?" added Lorne. "Gods know it's big enough already."
"At minimum," answered Bruce. "And that'll just be to stabilise it enough so we don't lose anything in the transfer. The data itself will still be encrypted. This is some pretty high-tech stuff here, and I'm assuming we want as much as we can get our hands on."
"Oh now, Captain, or may I call you, Steven?" said Hammer. "I actually think that's more appropriate given the current charges levied against you, don't you?"
Stepping inside Peter's sauna-like bedroom, Steve breathed out a short sigh of relief as he saw that yes, his little guy was in fact sleeping peacefully. A lump rose in Steve's throat as his eyes swept across his precious son, huddled down underneath his many layers of blankets with his stuffed polar bear clutched to his chest. Carefully, so as not to wake him, Steve brushed a stray curl from Peter's forehead before leaning down to kiss him, patting him gently on the shoulder once he'd stood back up.
"I can't imagine ever getting used to seeing your child like this, sweetheart," Steve said, draping his arm across Tony's shoulders. "I know I'm sure not."
"What?" asked Gamora.
“Yeah, okay, but Steve’s told me he used to run missions there all the time,” Peter interrupted.  “He was Special Forces, but Special Forces are still Army, aren't they?”
"Don't mention it, hon," Tony said as he skidded to a stop above Steve's head. He attempted to repulse the alien away, swearing when the thing deflected the repulsor beam off to the side with a simple flick of his wrist. "Goddamnit! Where's a spaceship when you need one, hmm?"
“Oh, shut up, you goddamn idiotic savant!” Obie shouted, stepping forward into Steve’s personal space.  He poked Steve hard in the chest, his eyes nearly popping out when Steve didn't move a single muscle.  “You can stand there and spout all of the fucking dates that you want, but you still have no fucking
Tony was married to a super soldier, a blond, blue-eyed living legend with a nearly perfect—
Peter stirred slightly, breathing in deeply as he opened one sleepy eye, his eyebrows furrowing in confusion as he focused in on Steve.
"Yes, that seems to be a common trait among geniuses. Or at least among the geniuses that I know," Steve said, curling his arm around Tony's shoulders. "It was nice to see you again, Mr Stacy, I hope you have a nice rest of your day."
"Oh, yeah," said Dr Strange from his perch at the top of a stone staircase, about ten or so metres away. "You're much more of a Thanos."
"That's my boy," Dad said proudly. "'Cause hell knows whenever I found myself at some pretty girl's house when I was sixteen, the last thing on my mind was studying."
"See ya, Dad!" Peter called from the lake, waving as Steve steered their small fishing boat away from the dock.
"I'll do you one better than that," Peter said. "I think I've finished all the coding."
As soon as he was settled Grandma set down the tray, stepping back with a satisfied smile as Peter quickly dug in. She had made him biscuits and gravy, along with what seemed to be actual, real-life freshly-squeezed orange juice, something that Peter hadn't had in years. It all tasted so incredibly yummy that for the briefest of moments, Peter actually forgot that he was sick.
"Well, I hope you're right." Steve got to his feet and placed his hand on Peter's shoulder, squeezing it gently. "You try to get some good rest tonight, okay?"
"Uhh, did I say something wrong?"
"Uhh… what just happened?" Bruce exclaimed. "How did you—?"
The fact that Peter seemed to have magically disappeared as soon as Doctor List and Wanda left his cell only served to prove that the edges of Steve's sanity were being slowly chipped away, leaving nothing but his demons behind.
"Oh, you think so?" said Papa. "Is that a threat or a promise?"
"But it's not worth more than
"Tony!" Steve exclaimed as his belly gave a violent swoop. "Sweetheart, what're you doing?"
"But—" Tony sputtered, huffing out a frustrated breath. "Honey, I just… I gotta make sure that nothing can jeopardise Pete's chances of getting his surgery. He's—he's almost at the end of his rope, and because of that there's just a lot of pieces that need to fall into place, and—"
"I am absolutely certain, Captain," JARVIS said firmly. "My upgraded systems have detected no anomalies since the incident at the Tower."
"Well… how 'bout how you were sitting when I first got in here? he said. "When you were being all contemplate-y and stuff? That's how I got Papa too."
"Oh, just go ahead and kiss already, will ya?" said the colonel. "'Cause I'm sure as hell not gonna kiss you."
"Tony, I swear I don't know what you're talking—!" Steve broke off as his eyes flicked over to the abandoned sketchbook. Almost instantly his shoulders sagged, his cheeks completely draining of colour as he squeezed his eyes closed, shaking his head.
"Well, I'm up for it either way," Tony continued. "Just let me know the dates once you have them so I can tell Pepper when we'll be gone."
of heavy metal footsteps against the concrete floor.
Finally, it was time for the vows, with Steve clearing his throat as he looked deep into Tony's eyes. Through his peripheral vision he could see Peter, his smile so wide that it threatened to split his sweet face.
“Yeah, sure sounded like it,” Tony said.  He pressed a quick kiss to Peter’s forehead.  “C’mon, bud.  I think a good night’s sleep will help you feel a lot better.”
"Well, that's as good of a place as any," Tony muttered as he came to a stop at what he hoped was a safe distance away. He sucked in a deep breath as he zoomed in on the location, flinching as Sam's guns began firing somewhere behind him. The Chitauri were on to them.
This time it had almost seemed as though his two separate timelines, pre-ice and post-ice, had somehow become merged together into one semi-coherent series of events, something that Steve was absolutely certain he had no desire to ever experience. He had flown the
Now wasn't really the time to ask such a question, though. Not when the force shield was preparing to open, allowing Thanos' war dogs free reign to enter Wakanda.
"Given the time required to construct the containment device for the tesseract and satellites and train the pilots for their extra-atmospheric activity, I'm estimating that Project Phoenix could be ready for implementation in as few as three months, give or take."
Steve leaned back against the elevator wall as it began its ascent up to the topmost floor of the Tower. He hadn't wanted to get into it with Sam right after their run, but he was really starting to worry about Tony. Ever since they'd returned from their late summer vacation to Ireland, Steve had noticed that Tony's sleep was getting worse. It didn't help that his own sleep still wasn't all that great, often filled with horrifying images of him battling Tony hand-to-hand as Tony mercilessly taunted him, images he knew were the result of his torture at HYDRA's hands. Sam had told him multiple times that it would take some time for those images to fade, and perhaps even longer due to his eidetic memory, but Steve wasn't concerned about himself. As much as Tony tried to deny it, he was suffering, and Steve was at a loss as to how to help him. As it was, Tony had spent a good portion of their sleeping time working in his lab after being awoken by yet another bad dream, only returning to the bed after Steve had begged him, telling him that he couldn't sleep well without him. It was the truth; Steve never slept well without Tony next to him, but he still felt guilty about it. Both he and Tony had fallen into some pretty bad coping habits following the battle in the Miami bunker, and Steve was afraid that he and Tony were starting to slip right back into those patterns.
snapped Uncle Bucky.
"Yeah, okay," said Peter. "JARVIS?"
“Well, yeah,” Tony says with a shrug.  “Why would he risk getting captured?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"At your service, Captain."
Auntie Nat would've been very proud of her cute little bug, or whatever the hell her little Russian nickname meant. All Tony knew is that Peter practically melted into a puddle of goo every time she said it, complete with the dewy heart eyes that Tony wouldn't have believed were possible from the former Red Room assassin if he hadn't personally seen them multiple times. Natasha didn't allow too many people to see her softer side, but Peter had been granted the privilege from pretty much the first time Natasha laid eyes on him.
entire future—was at stake.
"Well… at least there's that," Tony grumbled. "Look, Pete, I don't know what you and Grandpa have talked about and honestly I don't really want to know. But if he tries to tell you anything negative or doomsday about your… condition, then I want you to tell me about it right away. Is that clear?"
Rain was beating against the windshield like a runaway snare drum as Tony pulled his ancient car into the hospital parking lot, turning to Steve as soon as he cut the engine. He'd been trying hard to keep a lid on his near-frantic worry ever since he'd watched Steve get dressed in his dress uniform at oh dark thirty that morning, and had managed to do a fairly decent job of it, if he did say so himself. But after staying silent all through Steve's harrowing patrol—the rain had kicked in only a couple of minutes after Steve was airborne—and through dinner in the crowded mess hall, Tony was practically vibrating out of his skin, the stormy grey clouds and pouring rain only amplifying his restlessness.
Peter thought, his belly swooping in fear.
"More than enough," said Phillips. "And built to your new specs."
"I should've gone with you," Steve said. "I know how much you hate—"
"Okay, so…" Gwen said. "Do you think—?"
"JARVIS, do you know where my phone is?" he asked as he grabbed one of the blankets on his bed, giving it a hard shake. He cringed as his phone suddenly shot out from somewhere deep within the blanket's depths, aiming directly for the wall.
He reached into his backpack for yet another snack, trying to both distract himself and keep his strength up at the same time. He had loaded up on as many packaged cookies, Little Debbie cupcakes, and bottles of Powerade as he could fit into his backpack with all of the other stuff he'd crammed inside, and had already gone through over half of it, knowing full well that the chances to eat again once he got to the prison would be few and far between.
"Стиви, I think we're good here."
"Our energy crisis would be gone!" Steve exclaimed. "No more curfews, no more blackouts, no more—"
"Yeah—yes, ma'am. I will," Peter muttered. He slouched down into his chair, wishing he could somehow disappear into his oversized hoodie as Ms Warren turned her attention back to the whiteboard. At the moment all he wanted was for school to be over so he could go home, so ten more minutes may as well have been ten more hours.
"Here you are, young man. I hope you have fun at your prom!" the cashier said as she handed Peter the plastic box containing Gwen's corsage, a bright pink tulip accented with baby's breath and some green fern-looking plant that would coordinate with Gwen's emerald green dress beautifully.
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the X-302." An excited murmur rose up from the assembled pilots, and Tony's grin widened as Mr Muscles in the front row actually licked his lips.
And so far, aside from one gym class where Peter had forgotten that he had only packed a short-sleeved shirt, and therefore had to dig through the very smelly and gross lost and found for a long-sleeved gym uniform, it had worked out just fine.
The pause that followed seemed to stretch on interminably, each passing second punctuated by a thud of Joseph's heart against his ribcage.
He really should've known better. His heart was so weak now that even the simple act of walking to his bathroom was enough to cause it to flip out, beating so fast and so inefficiently that he could barely stay upright against the dizziness. The doctors had increased the dose of the medicines that pulled fluid from his lungs just a few days ago, but that was only yet another stopgap. Yet another temporary fix to the inevitable problem that was going to end up terminating his life.
Case in point, why he was even there in the first place.
"We were able to find out who the first two names are," said Natasha. "Or, were, I guess. From what we can tell they're both dead now."
"We'll go home just as soon as we get you fixed up again, okay?" Tony said. "Helen and Bruce are already on their way, so it won't be too long."
Right?
"Huh?" Tony rasped, his lungs rumbling with each jagged inhale. "Steve? What the hell is wrong with you?"
I’d love to hear any and all theories on what Steve’s thinking at the end here 😉 😎 Don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! ♥️
Which, he realised, could be both good and bad.
Steve winced, squeezing Tony's hand. Tony had told him a little about his life before Peter was born, about how different he'd been back then, but not all that much, and Steve had never really felt like asking for more specifics than Tony had offered.
" Steve gasped as he crossed the rest of the distance in only three strides. He instinctively reached a hand down to help Tony to his feet, his heart leaping when Tony grasped onto it.
With a nod, Tony downed the rest of the coffee in his mug and grabbed his glasses.  It was already a few minutes after six, and while Peter probably wasn’t bored hanging out with Steve, he sure as hell had to be getting hungry.
"They are killing themselves!" gasped General Okoye.
"I see," Beck said as he picked up his tablet, his jaw clenched tight with anger. "Thank you for your time, Mr Stark."
"Yes, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions for the Captain." Davis licked his lips, rearranging the pile of papers in front of him and shifting in his chair, and in general forcing Tony to bite his lip to avoid laughing out loud. Steve's nearly impeccable poise through Davis's disgusting questions had rattled the man, and Tony was so proud of his husband that he was nearly bursting with it.
Steve rapped his knuckles on the door three times, then stepped back, his belly swooping when Carol opened the door.
"Something's—!" Peter broke off, gasping as the bolts started coming so fast they were nearly continuous. His heart, already pounding from confusion and fatigue combined with adrenaline, began to thud even harder, making his head swim.
"Are you okay, bud?" Tony asked as he slid his arm around Peter's shoulders, tucking him close.
"Whoa!" Peter piped up from behind Tony. "That's really a guy? That's so cool!"
"Ah, yes, shows!" Thor exclaimed as he tossed his axe towards Steve, who slammed it with his shield right into another alien, slicing it completely in half. "In fact, I seem to recall Young Starkson mentioning something about attending a show in your city, on a street called Broadway? Something about a man who wears a mask and enjoys singing?"
There really was no way for Steve to know, and since he wasn't able to make in-tunnel adjustments to his compass, there was no way he could attempt to go back a bit further to see exactly what had happened.
"Ahh, who's she got reading it?" Dad asked. "'Cause it better not be someone that Steve and I don't know."
"Peter?" Gwen said as they reached the doors leading to the parking lot. "Is everything all right?"
It took Steve about three seconds for it to fully sink in, his heart thudding so erratically that he felt lightheaded. It all made perfect sense now. Peter's eyes and hair were the very same shade of brown as Anthony's, his nose was the same shape, and, now that he thought about it, Steve had even noticed a few similar mannerisms.
"Yeah, honey, I love it," Tony whispered as he looked down at the shiny band encircling his finger. He smoothed Steve's too-long hair from his eyes, cupping his stubbled cheek. "Almost as much as I love you."
"All right, Tony, all right," Steve said. He let out a heavy sigh, pressing another kiss to his temple. "Then we'll both go, okay?"
Steve blinked. He had heard O'Brien use that term before, in one of his televised speeches way back when he was still a boy around Peter's age. Something about how the Air Corps was developing technology in order to create an army of "perfect soldiers" with which to take on the Meridians after suffering a series of rather embarrassing defeats. Steve supposed that O'Brien had meant the speech to convey an element of protection and hope to a country filled with frightened civilians, but now it almost seemed more like a threat, and a shiver raced down Steve's spine at the thought of who else might've been in line to get the serum.
"Shh!" Steve said as he reached for a sandwich, biting off nearly half of it in a single bite. "That's still a secret, Buck!"
"Yeah, tell Uncle Bucky it's okay, JARVIS," Peter answered as he bent over to retrieve the pen, rapidly flipping it around his thumb as he reread the paragraph he'd just written on his Decathlon essay. The essay was already clocking in at over twenty-one pages, but as usual whenever Peter found himself fascinated with a topic, he now couldn't seem to stop. He had already exhausted the discussion on the development of the two polio vaccines and had moved onto discussing the testing of vaccines on the nation's military during wartime, something both Papa and Uncle Bucky had experience with.
Pursing his lips, Steve checked his compass—another gift from Tony—and adjusted his stance, leaning a bit more forward to hopefully keep from slipping again.  His pace, although brisk, was still far slower than his usual due to the need to keep an eye out for traps, and as the sun began to dip further and further behind the tall, pointed trees, Steve found himself almost tiptoeing, crouched low behind his shield as he carefully took each measured step.
"You—he
It was treason, pure and simple, and it was enough to make Steve want to find a wall somewhere to punch through.  Just like he had down at the VA hospital in D.C., the day he’d found out Bucky was going to lose his arm.
“Here you go, buddy,” he said as he set the bowl of popcorn and a big glass of orange juice on a tray next to Peter.  “Eat up now, okay?  Don't want you getting sick to your stomach.”
"This is the last part, sweetheart," Steve said. He suppressed a shudder at the memory of being sealed up inside that scary metal thing that had felt way too much like a coffin for his comfort.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, sure," Peter muttered. "I'll come back in here when I'm done, see if you need anything else."
"Most of the afternoon, yeah," answered Tony. "Darn Bruce ended up drinking the rest of my coffee too. Papa had to run out and get me more."
Both times.
Tony let out a chuckle as Steve gently rolled him onto his back, pressing a light kiss to his forehead before easing off the bed. He watched through half-lidded eyes as Steve sauntered into the bathroom, returning a few minutes later with freshly washed and towel-dried hair and a warm washcloth that he used to clean Tony's body, pressing another kiss to his lips once he was done.
Sarah pursed her lips as she shook Tony's hand, her grip plenty firm despite her pained knuckles.
“P-Pete?” Tony manages as Steve struggles to move him closer to Thor.  “Wh—what’s he—he can’t—it’s not—”
"All right," Peter said glumly. "Then I guess I'll see you tomorrow?"
"Yeah," Steve murmured. "I was determined to rid the world of HYDRA, even if it meant sacrificing myself."
"Yes!" exclaimed Peter. "As soon as I get home from school!"
"Shh, buddy, it's okay now," Tony soothed, brushing his son's tears away with his thumbs as Steve's arms tightened around them both. "No one's gonna get you, we promise."
"What the hell was all that about?" he hissed as they made their way towards the hangar. "If I didn't know any better I could've sworn that you we're trying to flirt, but—"
"Huh?" Tony said, snapping his gaping jaw closed. "Um… yeah, honey. I'm good."
"Okay, hold on. At the, whatchamacallit?" Tony asked. "What did you say this place was?"
"Hello, Mr Stacy!" Peter called back, grateful that at least his voice didn't crack or something. The third degree from Gwen had been bad enough, he didn't need her father to start barking questions at him too.
He was cut off as his climax slammed into him like a missile, the intensity of it stealing his breath as he came all over his stomach, barely aware of Tony's lips peppering kisses across his neck and chest.
"What're you doing here?" Tony asked, so devoid of emotion that it sent Steve's belly plummeting to his knees.
"And once again, you're still here," Sharon said to Steve as she swept into the room with Peter's dinner. Steve couldn't help but notice the way Peter's face fell when he saw her, having likely lost track of time himself, and his heart gave a lurch as he realised it likely meant that Peter's father wouldn't be able to make it to see him before the curfew.
"Yeah, he does," said Tony. "Steve taught it to him."
"Is there a problem, Captain Rogers?" asked the colonel, and Steve jumped, internally kicking himself for being so transparent. So much for not drawing his attention.
Peter rolled his eyes as he opened the door. "Well, it's not like I'm not gonna ask," he said as he stepped inside, stopping short when he saw Dad sitting on the edge of the comfy armchair in the corner. He at least was wearing his dress shirt and pants, but his purple tie was loose around his neck and his suit jacket was still carefully laid out on the bed. He was leaning forward, his elbows resting on his knees, and rocking slightly back and forth.
Steve grinned.  He could definitely think of a few things Tony could do with him, beginning that very night once they tucked Peter into bed.
Plus, he figured that sometimes Papa just needed a break from being in charge all the time. While the whole 'with great power comes great responsibility' thing definitely sounded cool, in reality it was sometimes just a heck of a lot of weight on a person's shoulders. Weight that not even a super soldier should have to constantly carry.
liked to drive fast."
“Hey!” Peter yelped, his heart in his throat.  “Um… I was just… researching?”
Both times when Steve could only watch in horror, completely helpless to do anything to save his beloved.
"Copy that!" said Sam as he and James fell in behind Tony, taking up position behind Thanos' lines. "It's time to take this asshole down some notches!"
Tony bobbed his head. "Well… I was gonna suggest that all you enhanced types could draw straws or something, but if you're volunteering—"
"So, you said you had something you needed to ask me?" he prompted after a few seconds of awkward silence. Rogers' face immediately flushed pink, his blue eyes flicking nervously around the cramped office.
“Oh, holy
“Humour me!”
"Love you, honey," Tony whispered into the empty lab. Then he sucked in a deep breath, pinching the bridge of his nose. He'd run out of coffee just before the first explosion hit, and it was far past the time for a refill.
Clint pursed his lips, his eyes shiny. "Thank you, Cap," he whispered. "Thank you."
"He's not gonna think any less of you, so you can let go of that dumb idea right the hell now," Tony said firmly. "Pete's not shallow, babe. Not in the least."
"Okay, so I'll just go and sit with him for awhile then," said Uncle Bucky. "See if I can distract him."
“Yeah,” Tony forced out.  Then he raised his shaking right hand and knocked three times on Obie’s door.
"Well, I know I don't know him very well, or even at all," said Steve. "But even the fact that he tried to coerce Scott Lang into trying to steal from us doesn't sit well with me. From what you've told me, Pym's pretty wealthy, so why couldn't he have done for Scott what you did for him?"
"Oh God, Pete," he sobbed into Peter's wild curls. Peter let out a grunt as Tony tucked his head under his chin, gliding his palms up and down his boy's back.
"Oh, and I'm thankful," continued Thanos, his grin widening into a leer. "Because now, I know what I must do. Once I locate that final stone, I will shred this universe down to its last atom. And then I will create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe."
Tony's eyebrows twitched, his expression vacillating between rage and anguish. "Bruce? Everything okay out there?"
"Eh, I'd say more like infamous, as it were," Cam said with a smirk. "Let's just say that we heard quite a bit about a certain person's looks, size, stamina—"
Otherwise known as BARF.
"Stane?" Peter whispered, the very name hitting him like a suckerpunch to the gut. "But why in the hell would—I can't believe—Dad would
Tony groaned, scrubbing at his eyes with his palm. "And you didn't tell me about this, why, exactly?"
he thinks as he closes his eyes again, shivering as a single tear drips down the side of his nose.  He wants to tell Tony how sorry he is.  He wants to blurt out everything he’s been bottling up inside for over two years simply because he’s “stubborn as hell”, as Tony would say.
"That means, 'do you comply?'" whispered Natasha.
Yeah.
"Goddamnit!" Dad exclaimed, slamming his fist down onto the panel as a bright red light began flashing. Peter jumped at the sound, letting out a hard shiver as the blow resonated along the long panel over to where he was standing.
"Yeah, yeah, I know," Tony muttered, rather grudgingly. "But still—"
The chance to win an Olympic gold medal is a gift, and one that Steve does not intend to waste.  Not now.  Not ever.
"I know you didn't," he said. "But since I'm here anyway, we may as well enjoy it."
"To be honest, sir, at the time I wasn't really prepared to deal with choices. It was quite a shock, being suddenly thrust into the twenty-first century, and I honestly wasn't in the right frame of mind to make any life-altering decisions at the time."
"Um…" Peter said as his eyebrows knitted together. "We're still over the Atlantic, dude. We won't reach land again for another five hours, depending on the wind speeds."
"That seems to be resolved, sir, at least for the moment."
"That's just 'cause you got stuck with a name like Tomis," said Chester, followed by one of his characteristically loud guffaws that was thankfully muffled by the underlying buzz of the X-101's engines. "That'd be enough to make anyone wish they had more time to think of something."
Little Steve whispered as his fingertips made contact with the crisp white paper, so much nicer than the rejected newsprint and old package wrapping he'd been using. A knot rose in Steve's throat as he watched his little boy self pick up one of the sketchbooks like it was made of glass, turning it carefully over in his hands before clutching it possessively to his chest. Next, he picked up a box of five pencils, one red, one black, and the remaining three in varying shades of grey.
name is on that list, Tony," Steve insisted. "So I don't care if it's personal or not to them, it is to
"Steve, please," Natasha said softly. "You can't keep doing this to yourself. Tony—"
"Nah, just giving you a hard time, J," he said with a chuckle. "Not like you'd actually make a mistake, right?"
As he swung closer to the ship, which was hovering over a street littered with destroyed cars and small fires, the HUD in Peter's mask started to focus in on what appeared to be two aliens facing off against both of Peter's dads and three other men, two of which were holding something that looked like glowing golden shields in their hands.
"Yeah," replied Tony, rather uneasily.
All the better to poke around with.
"Who—?"
Tony nodded, his throat so tight he could barely speak.
"Yeah, okay." Tony jumped as yet another barrage of machine gun fire erupted from the speaker, followed directly by an ear-splitting
He was so tired of dying. All he wanted to do was sleep.
Both of which made him very happy. Because despite his best efforts to tell himself to tread slowly, he was already so protective of both of the Starks that it scared him.
"Well, I'm not sure if 'interrogate' is the word I would use, but yes, we do have some questions for him," Papa said firmly. "Mainly, why he felt the need to try and break into our home rather than simply ask us for help."
"It better not be," Tony said with an exaggerated sigh of relief. "'Cause I am getting really sick and tired of just laying here."
"Listen to Эем, he knows what he's talking about," Bucky said. "Птер has to do this himself, that's the only way he'll be free of it."
"It is?" Peter asked, with such a childish hope that Tony's heart fluttered. Leave it to Steve to find just the perfect words to turn Peter's mood around.
"'Bout time. Is Pete doing okay?"
"What the fuck is this shit made of?" Clint yelled.
"JARVIS, pull up the footage from the defence drone that fired at the Compound, will ya?"
"Yeah, pretty much," Tony said with a shrug. "At least until I turned thirteen and got tested. I still mostly taught myself after that though."
"Oh. They know when they're gonna be back yet?"
“Ahh, why don't we hold off on the battle stories till after we take the bunker, ‘kay there, Thor?” Clint says.  “‘Sides, they always sound better after a few beers.”
"Yeah. I've never had it before, or at least, not that I can remember." He dropped his forehead against Tony's shoulder as his arms slipped around his waist, tugging him closer so he could feel Tony's heart beating against him. Being close to Tony could always chase the demons away, if only for a little while, and Steve needed him now.
Breathing in deeply through his nose, Tony squared his shoulders, facing Obie head-on.
Without waiting for a response Joseph pressed down on the trigger, holding his breath as the missile launched from its spot on the right wing, his eyes trained on the missile's fiery trail as it flew towards the bomb.
shouldn't be forced to suffer with a broken heart. Not if there was a perfectly good way to to fix it.
"Right," Bruce said. "So that would involve us going back in time, wouldn't it? And also involve us having to deal with all of the possible ramifications of going back in time?"
"Because I—" Steve started, then immediately paused, fighting the urge to clap his hand over his mouth. "I was just wondering, sir. Nothing more."
When I made JARVIS I made sure that no one would be able to mess with him except me, my dad, or my grandpa, so how—?" He broke off as the tears spilled over, rolling down his cheeks. "Oh gods, Uncle Bucky, this is all my fault! I'm the one who wrote JARVIS's program, so if there was a problem with him, then—then—!"
Steve propped himself up on his elbow and gently turned Tony's face towards him, the lustful gleam in his blue eyes apparent even in the dim light of their bedroom. "Is that an invitation?"
But he’d no sooner taken three steps towards the door when his intercom buzzed, followed by the chagrined voice of Pepper Potts. “I’m very sorry, Mr Stark, but Mr Stane is on the line, and he says it’s urgent.”
Phillips gave a nod, his face softening slightly. "Then I suggest you try and get some rest while I go check on some things and see how our prisoners are doing. We're gonna be here awhile."
"The penthouse is clear of all known designs of listening devices, sir," said JARVIS a few seconds later.
Especially the government, who as soon as Peter's prognosis was made official, proceeded to demand so much work from Tony it was as if he were in some kind of sick and twisted study on how far you could push another human being before they completely cracked, right down the middle.
And something about that just didn't sit right with Steve.
They also had begun identifying the various questionable SHIELD installations across the globe, with Steve already putting together plans to raid them once Thor, Clint, and Natasha all returned from their other assignments.
"JARVIS, are Peter and Tony awake yet?" Steve asked as the elevator continued its climb. Tony had been sound asleep when Steve's alarm had gone off ninety minutes earlier, so Steve had taken extra care not to disturb him as he readied for his run. Steve also knew that Peter had his own schedule of alarms to wake him up, but he always felt it prudent to check up on him anyway. With how fast Peter had been growing lately he'd been sleeping like a rock at night, and was often pretty difficult to rouse.
Tony let out a soft groan as he zipped up his suitcase, hefting it up off the couch. Despite the freezing-cold winter weather, the week spent in their Irish cottage had been so relaxing and peaceful that he wasn't ready to head home just yet, back to the harsh reality that awaited them in New York.
"But that's exactly what you think!" Peter snapped, squashing his polar bear into a lumpy ball. "You both think she's just inviting me over so her dad can ask me a bunch of questions about you and the team, don't you! Because it just couldn't be because she thinks I'm cool and wants to hang out, no, it has to be all about you guys!"
Tony looked up at him, bathed in the blue and yellow glow from the hologram a few metres away, with his beautiful face flushed and eager and his striking brown eyes staring up at him with such intense love and desire that Steve felt his heart stutter.
"Come in?"
Peter swallowed a sigh. That was exactly what he'd been worrying about Dad worrying about.
"Aw, man! I told you no front row seats!" Bucky groaned as he stepped into the classroom, sliding into the seat next to Steve. "Why'd you gotta pick the front row?"
As soon as the door to Peter's room clicked shut, the composure Steve had been fighting to maintain melted away, and he dropped his head, bringing Peter's limp hand to his lips.
Steve rushed out.  Then he cupped Tony’s cheek and dipped his head, brushing his lips across Tony’s in a soft, tentative kiss.  The warmth that had been simmering under the surface of Steve’s skin for the entire evening quickly roared into a conflagration as he drew back to catch a glimpse of Tony’s eyes before diving right back in, capturing his luscious bottom lip between his own.  Steve let out a soft whimper as Tony’s hands slid up his arms and shoulders to his neck, his fingers trailing along the patch of skin just above Steve’s shirt collar.
But even through all of those difficult times, Steve had never once believed that Tony had lost interest in being intimate with him. Their sex life had been limited only by their circumstances.
“I have no doubt,” Steve said, shifting slightly as Peter arranged the pieces on the board.  “Is there a reason why you don't want to do that, Peter?”
"Like another attack from space?" Tony said.
"Bucky—!"
"Can you please have Tony meet us at this location?" Steve asked. "Tell him to fly, it's urgent."
"Very good, Captain. You do the same."
but anyway—and I've gotta say, it's not exactly what I would call up to snuff, if you know what I mean."
And now—now HYDRA had him, and who knows what they'd been doing to him all this time. And where was Peter? Was he still safe, or did—
"Probably 'cause of that whole indescribable power thing that he just mentioned, Сэм," Bucky said.
"And I respectfully decline," Howard stated. "As I just stated, my son is still recovering from surgery and in case you hadn't noticed, we are currently in the middle of a blackout."
"But you can't promise that, honey. No one can," Tony whispered. "Which is why I'm gonna make sure that when that space army does finally come knocking on our door, we're as ready as possible."
“And so are a lot of other people,” Tony finished.  “Including Pete.”
"Soon, buddy," Dad said quickly. "There's a ton of data here that we're transferring over to the Tower and it's been pretty slow-going, but as soon as JARVIS is done then we'll be heading right home."
"Oh no!" Gwen exclaimed as one of Peter's favourite characters in the whole movie, Chirrut, bravely made his way through a barrage of enemy fire to flip the switch that Bodhi needed to activate the communications array. Peter gave her hand a reassuring squeeze, biting his lip to brace himself for what he knew was coming.
Since he had already seen the movie two previous times, Peter was able to anticipate most of the explosions and brace himself against the noise. Uncle Sam had suggested that he try to wean his dependence on his earplugs during one of their recent talks, thinking that if Peter was better able to keep his senses under control during normal daytime activities that it would maybe help with the severity of his nightmares, and so far it actually seemed to be working. Whether it was due to the fact that maintaining his focus without the extra help was so exhausting that he was simply too tired to dream or he was actually getting better Peter hadn't yet figured out, but he was pretty much to the point where he didn't care
"Thanks, J," Tony said.
"Pete—"
“Steve,” he started.  “Christ, honey, I’m—I’m—”
Dad and Papa would be proud.
"Oh, sure." Peter opened his notebook, skipping over several pages until he came across an impressive drawing of a squirrel sitting on a windowsill.
But Bartlett just ignored him as one of his partners stepped behind Steve, grabbing onto his upper arms. "Steve Rogers, you're under arrest for the falsification of information on your Army enlistment form. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be—"
Including the capture and torture of Steve, which, in Tony's opinion, was all the motivation that he needed to want to kill him.
And, peering more closely at Image Papa’s face, Peter could see that he was just on the verge of one of his breakdowns, and was trying desperately to keep it contained long enough for the group counselling session to end.
"Yeah," Tony whispered, his upper lip curling into a sneer at the mention of Justin Hammer. "I'm pretty sure we can count that asshole Davis as one of 'em, and the dude who sponsored the bill that Pete found, and most likely the president too, but as for hard evidence, that's probably gonna be pretty scarce, babe. HYDRA's done a pretty damn good job of hiding its tracks so far, and I don't see that changing until they want it to change."
"And specifically, to California," said Davis. "Isn't that correct?"
“Hmph,” Tony says without looking up.  “Me too, Cap.  Me too.”
"That's right," said Steve.
"There's still one more down inside it," Bucky said as he yanked Steve back just in time to avoid his foot getting caught in the hatch as it slammed shut. "Actually, make that two."
He only had to pull himself together, and complete the mission.
"Goddamnit," muttered Tony as he turned away, pinching the bridge of his nose. As much as he hated to admit it, the kid was probably right. Back when he was designing rockets he always had to consider that the velocity the rocket was travelling would inversely impact its manoeuvrability, and while out in space wind shear wasn't a thing, there was still the whole "folding of space" and "warp corridor" things that were at the very core of warp theory.
But Ned had barely made a turning-like move before he whipped back around, resting his chin on the back of his seat.
"Shh. I want to," whispered Steve. He tightened his arm around Tony, breathing in the glorious scent of his hair. "Please, sweetheart. I just—I just need to hold you."
"Oohh," Steve whispered as he looked Peter up and down, his throat tightening as he realised that the procedure had actually worked.
He was Spider-Man, and thus had earned his place with the team.
of the bell with each answer rubbing against Peter's already fried nerves like a cheese grater. JARVIS had informed him about an hour ago that his dads had finally gotten home and would be able to pick him up from school, and he just knew that they were going to figure out that something was very wrong the second they laid eyes on him.
One person vs. twenty million. It didn't take a genius to know that the math just didn't add up.
look, a look that Peter had had perfected ever since he could walk.
He broke off then, swallowing back tears. "I could never stand to see him cry, Steve, not
"Okay, so… you met Pete
"Nah, it's okay buddy," Tony said, ruffling Peter's hair. "As long as you do your homework after dinner."
Tony thought with a frown. The first time he had caught Peter tampering with JARVIS had been when he was eight, when he reprogrammed his television curfew so he could watch movies late at night while he was supposed to be sleeping. And Tony had to admit that he had done it so well that it had taken him awhile to catch on, not thinking to investigate anything until Peter did a literal faceplant into his Lucky Charms one morning because he was so tired.
Making his way down to his and Steve's bedroom, Tony stepped inside to find him just starting to stir. He quickly crawled onto the bed next to him, gathering his tall, broad husband into his arms as Steve's gorgeous blue eyes fluttered open.
"I think that's fine, sweetheart," said Steve. "And then if it comes down to it, I'll—I'd like to talk to him personally again before—"
As a matter of fact, Steve distinctly remembered even seeing Carol cry a couple of times, when she'd thought no one else was around. Most of the time Carol was as tough as they came, one of the strongest people that Steve had ever seen, but she had confessed to him once Colonel Rhodes had "recovered" that not being able to be there for him when he'd needed her had been one of the hardest things she'd ever endured in her life.
Ned, of course, had bombarded Peter with questions from practically the very second he set foot inside the school, fuelled by a bunch of stupid conspiracy theories being passed around at his mother's book club. Peter had tried to answer a few of them as best as he could, but since he didn't really understand a lot of it himself, he'd ended up clamming up after a few minutes and just telling Ned that he'd been sworn to secrecy.
“No promises,” Dad said with a wink.  Then he sat down on a small chair next to Papa and took his hand.  “JARVIS?  We good to go?”
Somehow, even though this race was only about three months after the first, Steve managed to get even hotter.  His arms and shoulders are even more well-defined, and his pale skin is absolutely flawless, like he’s had one of those full-body polish treatments that Tony’s mother used to love so much.
"Ohh," Steve murmured as a second firework shot up over the tall trees, starbursting into dazzling lines of green, white, and orange. Tony's breath hitched as he glanced over at his husband, and the way the bright colours reflected against his snow-sprinkled blond hair, making the strands almost sparkle.
“Look, bud, how ‘bout this,” Dad said before Peter could say anything else.  “How ‘bout you give me one more hour, and then I promise I’ll have JARVIS turn off all calls from the office for the entire weekend.  Hmm?  That sound okay?”
"I don't know the whys, Captain, I just deliver the subpoenas," she said. "And now that you've been served, I'll be on my way."
Incredible moodboard created by @adoctoraday, thank you so much!!  💖
"Bucky, you can't be saying stuff like that!" Steve said as they made their way to the locker room. "I can't risk Tony getting into trouble just because you can't seem to resist trying to tease us!"
Or even weirder than usual. Is it because you had to go in that witness protection thingy last winter when your dads were gone on that long mission?"
"Yeah, that's better," he said. "Think you can clean it up some more before we have to use it?"
Hopefully he wouldn't scare Tony once he finally woke up.
"Okay, but in the meantime, what're we supposed to tell him, hmm?" asked Uncle Sam. "'Cause I'm not lying to him. Not about this. You break a kid's trust once over something like this and you'll never get it back."
"Uh huh."
"Good," said Gwen, just as Mr Stacy pulled into the parking lot in his police car. She nudged Peter with her elbow, giving him a soft smile. "I guess I'll see you guys tomorrow?"
"It's okay, Петр," Uncle Bucky said gently, and a stab of pain pierced Peter's heart at the deep sadness in his eyes. "I'm… it's okay."
"Well… yeah," Peter said carefully. "That's what they do when people are out after curfew, Grandpa. You know that."
"Yeah, maybe. Back then all it would've taken was a single shot to pretty much get me plastered, but anyway… I ended up asking him why I had been chosen, since all of the other guys in the program were a lot bigger and stronger than I was."
He was carrying the tesseract. If its container was breached… there'd be no way any of them would survive a direct hit—
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Steve finally says.  He clears his throat, gesturing towards Peter’s duffel bag.  “Are you ready to get started?”
"I'm not going to acknowledge something when it's not inevitable," he replied. Then he turned the knob and stepped through the door, slamming it closed behind him.
"Well, then, you know what I mean."
“You can, Tony,” Steve says.  Gritting his teeth, he reaches for Tony’s wrist, curling his fingers around it.  “I know you can.  I've watched you tinker with plenty of stuff a lot smaller than my leg, so I know you can do it.”
Not even a second later a massive blast shook the complex just as the first Hammer suit became airborne. Tony immediately took off in the direction of the blast, and was about three metres or so away from the ceiling when the second blast hit, opening an entire spider-web of cracks in the thick concrete that looked on quick glance to be deep enough for him to break open.
Peter let out a heavy sigh. "Yeah. And… he got kinda loud at one point and Ms Sharon had to ask him to leave, so… I'm not sure when he's gonna be back."
"Watch your step as you go inside, Peter," Ms Sharon said as she guided him into his tiny bathroom. "Don't want you to trip."
Steve thought as they stepped out onto the bright and sunny yard, such a stark contrast to his roiling emotional state.
Stepping over Thor's sprawled-out legs, Steve made his way towards the rear of the Quinjet, shaking out his arms and rolling his head to try and stretch out the tight muscles in his neck and shoulders. Natasha looked up as he passed, giving him a quick nod from where she and Bucky were huddled together on the bigger couch, watching a movie on her tablet. It was one of Peter's Star Wars movies from the looks of it, which Peter had introduced to Bucky while Steve and Tony were on their honeymoon. That was back when Bucky could still barely look Steve in the eye—or really anyone besides Peter and Sam—and Steve smiled as he realised that Bucky was probably missing Peter now almost as much as he was.
"Tony," Steve said as he tilted his head up to meet Tony's lips, his fingers threading through Tony's hair to hold him in place as Tony let out a soft whimper. As a matter of fact, a big part of the reason for Steve's impatience with his healing injuries was because he wanted Tony so badly that at times he could barely concentrate on anything else, but absolutely did not feel comfortable with Tony doing all the work since he was hurt as well.
"Um… what's going on? Are you guys okay?"
"Uh, yeah," he said. "You're the smart one, remember?"
Twenty minutes later, panting and sweating, Peter dropped down into the small lab, relieved to find that Dad hadn't ever gotten around to cleaning it out. He quickly opened his laptop and got to work, inputting the same suit parameters that Dad had used for his old Spider-Man suit, and also adding two additional slots in his waistband for more web fluid vials and one of the locator chips that Dad always installed in Papa's uniforms, which would allow him to send out a signal once he was ready for backup.
who'd just happened to look out their window while he was stuck sliding behind the runaway weapons van and bouncing off trash cans, 'cause, why the hell
"Nah, I wouldn't've called that a palace," scoffed Quill. "Ego's place was a palace. Knowhere was just… kinda like a nice house. A big nice house."
“Yeah, it’s been pretty steady in here today,” answered Steve.  “But are you all right?  You sound… upset.”
"Yeah, One, I copy," Carol answered a second later. "And I'm ready."
"Well, like I said, I don't really know what it is or what it's for," Lang said with a shrug. "Just that Hank said that he needed it."
"Ohh," Peter whispered as he slid his arms into the hoodie and pulled it over his head, hugging his arms across his front once he was set. How could he have forgotten that he used to swipe these all the time when he was little, and especially whenever Dad was out of town?
I wouldn't be able to survive, not without them, so…" He paused, scrubbing at his eyes with his palm. "I was so used to being alone, to handling everything on my own, but now… now I know I couldn't live without them. I just couldn't. And after Miami, and everything that's been happening lately, it's just… it's like someone's trying to tell me that I don't deserve them or something, and I just—"
“Pete?” Dad calls from the living room.  “We’re on the clock here, buddy, let’s go!”
"Well, I think that went about as well as it could have," said Rhodey. "I swear that Davis is a special kind of asshole, though."
Tony frowned, but nodded as he sat down on Peter's bed, curling his arm around his son's skinny shoulders as Sharon took a datapad from Bucky's lap and tapped it several times.
Which either meant that some enemy of the United States had somehow managed to do an end-around every single intelligence source on the planet and secretly come up with new space-faring weapons technology, or it was the Chitauri.
"What do you think's going on?" Peter asked.
"Mmm," Tony agreed, burrowing further into Steve's side. "Whatever it takes."
, for Christ's sake!" Tony exclaimed. "He's my
have to remember to text you.”
“Sounds like we have a plan,” he says.  “I’ll see you both at 5pm tomorrow.”
Howard glanced over at Phillips, who gave him an encouraging nod.
"Buddy—" Dad started.
Rhodey let out a sigh as he checked his timepiece. "Look, I gotta get going. Do you need anything before I go?"
Peter gave a nod, running his tongue across his chapped lips.
"At your service, sir."
"I'm—I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm so sorry. I'm—I'm just—I never meant to make you think that—I mean, you know how much I love you, and—I never, ever want you to think that I'd—that I would—"
“Please!” he cried into the frigid night air, barely audible over the bloodcurdling groan.  “Please, make it stop!”
“I’m saying you're beautiful, Tony,” Steve says again.  He pushes himself up to a sitting position, reaching for Tony’s hand.  “I’m saying that you’re wonderful, and brilliant, and unbelievably handsome, and… I—I’m in love with you.”
Steve shook his head, his tears dripping down to wet Tony's shirt. He attempted to curl his hands into fists, letting out a sharp hiss of pain when he couldn't. "That beam… it would've killed us. It would've killed Bucky and me, and—Tony, I couldn't—I couldn't
Tony’s so entranced by the sheer perfection displayed on the screen in front of him that at least three minutes go by before he realises that Steve has won his race and the video is over.  Swallowing against his dry mouth, Tony clicks on the third video, his heart giving a hard lurch at the razor-sharp contrast in Steve’s demeanour.  Gone is the cheery, kind of
"Well, Steve, I'm not quite sure how I'll be able to match up to that, but I guess I'll give it a try anyway," he began, his melodic voice sending shivers down Steve's spine. "I know I've told you this before, but since we've got all these people gathered together here at our new home, I'm thinking that it bears repeating. All my life, people have known my name, but that was pretty much it. That was it, because I was too afraid to let anyone get any closer. I was too afraid that if anyone got close enough to actually
"When?" Steve asked.
"Oh, like that's anything new," Tony said, his eyes going wide as Peter practically lunged for the nearest platter of turkey, grabbing two of the four drumsticks. The entire table fell into pleasant conversations as they ate, listening to James recap how things were going down in D.C. with the ongoing trials of the former HYDRA operatives, along with Clint and Pietro's banter over who was likely to win the football games being played later that day. Clint had even taken it upon himself to purchase season tickets to the Buffalo Bills, braving the heavy snows and piercing cold every other Sunday to spend quality time with his surrogate son, something that Steve found incredibly heartwarming. Natasha had told Steve at the beginning of the school year that Clint had never expressed any interest in children or being a father until he met Peter, and that it was his relationship with Peter that had given him the confidence he needed to agree to take in the twins.
He couldn't afford to worry about that now, though. Peter was strong, despite Tony's uncanny ability to forget that particular fact, and clever enough to help defend himself if the need would so arise. Tony just had to trust in his son, and try to focus on the task at hand.
"Please," Nebula insisted. "The three of us need to fix the ship and get off of this rock. Quickly."
Perfection that for some reason seemed to really like Tony.
"All right, guys, let's get started," Liz said, clapping her hands to get the team's attention. It was their first practise back from Christmas break, which meant that the big competition was only about four months away, and Liz would be cracking the whip even harder.
"Thanos is coming," Bruce interrupted, his voice practically squeaking in fear. "He's been out there, searching for the infinity gems over the past few years, and now he's coming here!"
"I won't, Tony," Steve said firmly. "We're going to grow old together, remember? You and me, sitting in our rocking chairs up at the Compound, long after we've passed down our shields and suits of armour to the next generation of heroes."
But now, hope, in all of its delicate glory, was all that they had.
Instead of answering, Steve twisted his fingers, finding the magic spot inside Tony that made the pleasure shoot so hard across his body that he felt he might short-circuit.
Once again, silence fell across the panic room as Peter collapsed back against Bucky, with Tony practically vibrating in Steve's arms as Bucky looked back at them, a wide smile stretched across his face.
"Yeah, he's pretty sweet," Peter said as he turned another page, this time showing Cashew nibbling on what looked like a crust of bread. "I like to feed him sometimes too, but don't tell my grandpa, 'kay? He'd think it's a waste of food."
Then again, there’s never been this much riding on winning.
"Oh, that's awesome," Gwen said. "And it's good that your dad realises that kind of stuff. A lot of people with his kind of money don't."
"Oh, that's good," Peter said. "Just in time to leave again."
"Yes, but right now that doesn't matter," said Nebula. "We must get the human back to his people. See how many of them are left."
"Well, pardon me if I don't feel like taking your word for it," muttered Tony. "Especially after you wouldn't even come down and take a peek at Pete when we asked."
"I don't really want to leave you alone," Gwen said quietly. "When are your dads supposed to get here?"
"Nice flying there, Tony," said Sam. "Barton, you, Nat and Bucky coordinate with Stacy's team to take out the rest of the personnel inside the prison. Once they're all secured, you guys find Steve and Peter and then get the hell outta there."
"No, Dad, you don't understand! I need—"
With a heavy sigh, Steve settled himself down onto the remaining couch and tipped his head back, briefly closing his eyes. He knew he should take Sam's advice and try to get some sleep, but he also knew that the attempt would be futile. With the way his mind was already racing in a million different directions, there'd be no way he'd be able to dial it back enough to relax.
Not that Obie would’ve ever allowed him to anyway.  The first time that Tony ever got caught in a compromising position with another guy, back when he was in college, Obie ended up throwing an even bigger tantrum about it than Howard.  And that was saying something.
"I know that already, Papa," Peter said evenly. "But it doesn't really matter anymore, does it? I'm here now."
Steve nodded, scrubbing his palm down his face. "And Tony?"
It was yet another beautiful spring in Langara. Steve donned his sunglasses as he sped towards the hospital, the crisp wind whipping past his cheeks invigorating him almost as much as his morning run.
"No!" Peter gasped, ducking his head against his knees in a futile attempt to block out the memories suddenly flooding his mind. A graveyard with Dad and Papa's gravestones crumbling into dust. Auntie Nat's broken, lifeless body. Uncle Clint losing control.
the doctor said a few minutes—
"And so far we can't figure out why, Pete," Dad said firmly. "Which means it was probably just a glitch."
"So," Tony said once Peter had finished polishing off three servings of Sam's homemade gumbo and drank about a litre of Powerade. "You feel like telling us why you felt the need to go after Toomes' lackeys all by yourself?"
"Tony, please," Steve said, far too calmly for Tony's taste. "Beating yourself up over something that you can't control won't help anything."
And since Peter's eyes were just like Tony's, Steve had always been able to read them too.
the weirdest thing going on right now? The fact that I'm in the boys' bathroom, and not that you're trying to sneak off to go and find your papa?"
"Mmm, yeah, that sounds good," Tony said, winking. "Even better if you'll let me blow you."
"Well, if it's that bad, I'm surprised that you don't wear one of those medical alert bracelets or something," said Gwen. "'Cause you really should, you never know when you might get exposed, and… I gotta say, I've never seen anyone else's face lose all of its colour that fast."
About fifty seconds later, it becomes apparent exactly why Steve was so nervous.  Tony’s heart skips a beat as he watches Steve touch the wall in a heartbreaking fourth place, leaving him out of the medals.  As Steve pulls himself out of the pool, Tony can tell by his expression that he’s absolutely stunned, even as he graciously congratulates all three of the medalers.
Tony's hands immediately froze in place. "Steve," he said, and Steve's heart skittered at the catch in his voice. "Honey, you were gone for a
Which, Steve realised as he took off, was likely the very reason why Peter had never been granted such a chance.
"I don't know, Buck," Steve answered. "But I'm sure it doesn't do any good to whine about it."
"Yeah, well, apparently Pete could visualise it," Tony muttered. He scrubbed a palm down his face, his heart already thudding a staccato beat against his ribcage. "All right. What's yours and Nat's ETA?"
"More like starving," Peter answered with wide eyes. "But I wanna try one more time first. Please?"
"Steve, we were all affected by that sceptre," Bruce piped up from his chair next to James. "So even though Loki didn't use it on all of us directly, we were all still vulnerable to its effects."
If Rumlow was indeed responsible for Steve’s abduction, then he’d better damn well watch his back.  Because once Tony got his hands on him, there would be no level of hell, Hel, or any other form of underworld deep enough to protect him.
"You have my word, Your Highness" said Steve. "Once this is all over."
In the span of six years, Tony had gone from being a single dad who manufactured weapons and lived under the shadow of an overbearing asshole to a married superhero who was now literally attempting to save the universe.
"And do you understand the credit requirements for such a transport?" asked the dispatcher.
"Rogers here," replied Steve as he clicked his safety belts into place.

cool.
"Yeah, that's her, she's our team Captain," Peter answered. "You've both met her, and I'm pretty sure you've met her mom too, or at least seen her a few times. And her dad's on one of the Damage Control crews in the city."
Peter let out a heavy sigh. "All right."
"No, I'm not," Dad stated, his jaw doing that funky twitching thing that it always did when he was extra mad. "Howard's had way too many chances to not screw up over the years, and he's wasted every single one of 'em. I'm not giving him anymore."
"Not in this case," Tony said through clenched teeth.
"Mr Stark?" Steve said again. "If we're going to allow you to run this procedure on our son, I'd appreciate an answer to my question."
"All right, but we still want you to take it easy, little guy, okay?" said Steve. "Just let us take care of you."
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. "It's nothing to be embarrassed about. My dad likes—or at least, liked—both girls and guys, and he's not embarrassed about it."
I hope you're able to—"
"Yeah, it is," Steve said, grunting as he quickly lunged to the left, his speed dropping down as he skimmed right along the upper atmospheric border. "Just stay on my wing, okay? It'll be just like that one time…"
Tony’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, which he quickly tried to cover with a salacious grin.  “Oh, really?” he said as he kissed the underside of Steve’s jaw, sending a delicious shudder down his front.  “That’s a pretty unusual request, honey.  Are you sure?”
"Oh no!" Gwen screamed as the monster swung its fiery arm, hitting the wall near the ceiling and causing it and the ceiling to come crumbling down, completely blocking the exit door. Uncle Bucky jumped back, shielding Gwen with his body as Peter leapt onto what remained of the wall, attempting to stabilise it so the rest of the ceiling didn't collapse as well. He could hear the screams of the rest of the panicked moviegoers who were now trapped inside the auditorium, with the main doors completely engulfed in flames and the emergency exit blocked by mountains of smoldering wood and drywall.
"Of course, Captain," answered JARVIS. The screen went blank a few seconds later, with the sound of a chugging van filling Steve's ears shortly thereafter. He and Natasha were silent as they headed towards the residence's entryway, his heart thudding a staccato beat against his ribcage.
Arriving at their favourite coffee shop, Steve made pleasant small talk with the barista as she prepared their drinks and chocolate croissants, then led Tony over to their usual table in the corner, right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out onto the bustling street.
It was on the tip of Steve's tongue to ask why. Why they absolutely needed to trust some holier-than-thou doctor who hadn't even had the courtesy to consult on Peter when he and Tony had feared that their son's mind might've been lost for good.
"Yeah, and I honestly didn't feel all that comfortable leaving him, even when he got older. Used to drive Obie nuts when I'd bring him to the office. I had an entire section of it cordoned off for him to play in, and he never bothered anyone 'cause all my employees were just in love with him, but all Obie did was complain about his toys scratching up the floor." He scoffed, shaking his head as the guilt welled up inside his belly. "Jesus, Steve. I was such a goddamn
"Okay, stop," Gwen said, shaky and low. "Please, just… you don't have to say it, okay? I get it."
Thanos had thrown the entire planet into chaos, and had had the gall to call it mercy.
he said with a relieved smile, his precious voice sending electric shivers down Steve's spine. "
"That's how it's gonna be, buddy," Tony said firmly. "There are risks that come with using this thing that we need to make sure everyone understands before anyone goes near it, okay? And I'm not sure if I'm willing to allow you to take that risk. Not yet, not until we all talk it through first."
Tony thought as he pressed down on Steve's scalp again. Steve moaned as Tony hit the particularly sensitive spot that almost functioned like his own personal off button, massaging his fingertips over it until Steve's tired moans grew quieter and his breathing more even.
And when they woke up the next morning, sticky and sweaty and still curled up together, Steve found that aside from some slight residual soreness, most of his pain was gone.
Steve glanced over at Tony, his expression tentative. "As soon as our son gets his heart fixed and we can take him home," he said. "Then I'll be happy to."
Tony was just about to point out that coffee was a perfectly acceptable alternative to lunch when Steve chuckled, giving him a knowing look.
"It would mean that my papa was killed by a Langaran weapon instead of a Meridian one," Steve said, almost spitting the words. "And it also would mean that the Langaran military deliberately attacked our own power plant, which then threw the entire country into chaos."
“Ah, sorry, but you're gonna have to do a lot better than that,” snapped Tony.  “If this place is as unstable as you say, then who’s to say that this agent’s even still yours?”
Of course, incredible food hadn't been the only way Steve had been spoiling Tony. In fact, if his math was correct, Tony was certain that he and Steve had had more sex in the last three weeks than they had on their own honeymoon, when it had just been the two of them. From sleepy morning handjobs and blowjobs and the occasional afternoon quickie to hours spent exploring each other's bodies after Peter went to bed, the two of them had probably spent more time getting each other out of their clothing than they had actually wearing any.
"One o'clock," Steve said. "And are we still on for our run in the morning?"
Like Lorriane said, the name sounds familiar, although Steve wouldn't know from where exactly, and for some reason he doesn’t feel comfortable googling it to find out more.  His initial impression that Stark is some super-rich guy was kind of quashed when Lorriane mentioned that his son took swimming lessons at the Y, since the Y isn’t exactly where all of the rich kids tend to hang out.
"He's told me some," Tony said softly. "Mainly about how his ma managed to keep him alive for eighteen years on sheer determination, and a bit about how much the procedure hurt, but… no. He hasn't told me much about how he was before."
"I just mean… from what I've seen of him, he hasn't left you alone for a single minute since you got hurt, so I just don't see why he'd leave you alone now, unless… you made him leave."
"He's right, Steve," Sam said firmly. "The doctors told me that they weren't sure if he was even breathing when his aircraft landed, so if you hadn't gotten him out when you did there's no telling what could've happened. He could've been left with brain damage, or—or—" Sam broke off, swiping at his nose. "He's still alive, and that's all that matters."
"Somehow I doubt it," he managed to croak past his parched throat. He blinked his swollen eyes, his jaw tightening even more as he recognised the man as Justin Hammer.
"I know, Dad. I miss him too," Peter murmured as more tears leaked from beneath his closed eyelids. "But that's what I've been trying to tell you. What I found tonight… it's—it's pretty bad, and now… now I don't know if we'll ever be able to find Papa."
The man smiled.  “Ah, yeah, that one is pretty rare.  I found it on a quick jaunt that I took over to Ireland about five years ago.”
After taking a shower that was so burning hot he could barely stand it, Steve shuffled his way into the kitchen, quickly whipping up a half a dozen scrambled eggs and a large stack of homemade pancakes. His notes from the night before were still scattered across the kitchen table as he sat down, pouring syrup over his steaming hot pancakes as he shuffled through the various pages that, according to Bucky, closely resembled football play diagrams.
"This is my best attempt, sir," said JARVIS. "However, without any reference to go by, I cannot promise that—"
"Ohh, but you are ready for me, aren't you?" Tony whispered, pulling another guttural grown from Steve's throat as his long fingers finally curled around his aching cock. He slowly stroked him as his free hand glided across his collarbones and down his pecs to his abdomen, contracting with every single touch. "Fuck, Steve, you're just too goddamn pretty!"
"Together," Steve said as his eyes locked with Tony's again, nearly blown black as his strokes slowly gained speed. "You're so beautiful, mo grá, and I love you so much. Please don't ever think you need to hide your body from me."
expression, which only made Tony angrier.
Peter’s bottom lip shook as he shrugged.  “Uh huh, I guess,” he said softly.  “Popcorn’s fine.”
"And you know damn well that there's no possible way that I would ever leave you alone," Tony snapped. "If it comes down to it Thor can take Pete, but I'm not leaving you to fend for yourself. That's not what we do."
"Clint and I have got him, Tony," answered Natasha. "He's secure."
Otherwise, the bad guys would win. And that was something he simply could not allow.
Which meant that he had to sneak into Dad's lab, grab his extra bottles of web fluid, then sneak downstairs to the lab and get it up and running again all before he was supposed to wake up for school.
"All right. John, Cam, and Majors Lorne and Kowalski are planning on coming too, as long as there's enough space," said Sam. "Figure it can't hurt to have as many people cheering Peter on as possible."
Instead, he'd felt as though he'd been broadsided. Shot with a missile from his left flank at point-blank range with absolutely no warning.
"I'm sure, Papa. I'm just ready to get this over with."
a child, why can't you see that?" Peter snapped, pushing against papa's chest and almost knocking him over. "I'm a teenager, and I'm even stronger than you! Papa, you
"Eh, that's what people tell me," Peter said with a not-quite-modest shrug. "But I did ace my History final today, so…"
"Yes, yes, Captain. I do apologise," said Thor. "Now then. Prior to the creation of this universe, there existed six singularities. After the universe exploded into existence, the remnants of these six systems were forged into concentrated ingots—er, gems, as you would call them. The six infinity stones. Now, these stones are powerful, as you can imagine, and therefore can only be manipulated by beings of extraordinary strength. You may recall that I personally played witness to the immense power of one of these stones when the Dark Elves attempted to use the convergence of the nine realms to unleash the Aether, otherwise known as the Reality Stone. This Aether was not only used to lay waste to the area of your planet that you call Greenwich, but it also caused my… companion at the time, Jane, to fall seriously ill."
"All right, honey," he finally said. "Then let's do it."
"And where did that bring you?" Thanos continued. "Right back to me."
"Oh, they are still coming, Sir Buchanan," Thor said as an entire squadron of Chitauri took off towards them. With a rather evil grin, he raised his axe, summoning a series of lightning bolts that he brought directly down on their heads, knocking them flat.
"Perhaps," said General Okoye. "But you are referring to an object that is absolutely sacred to our people. An object that under no circumstances would we want to see damaged."
"No, he's not," Tony cut in. "Steve adopted him, but they don't share any blood. You wouldn't know it, though. Pete's so much like Steve it's almost scary."
"If I may, Mr Chairman, Captain," said Davis, leaning forward against the table. "I do have one more question that I believe to be of relevance."
“Okay, JARVIS,” Tony said as he crossed his arms, stepping back two paces.  “Go ahead and give that a try, yeah?”
Even if they could locate Thanos, he had beaten them once already, and beaten them badly.
, Tony thought as he typed in the opening commands, letting out a heavy sigh as he reached for the framed photograph of Peter. It had been taken on a beautiful sunny summer day about a week after his third birthday, only a few days before the severe hypoxic episode that landed him in the hospital and eventually led to the diagnosis of his heart defect. Tony had already begun to notice certain things that were odd, like Peter's lips turning a funky colour after he'd been running around and the fact that his little hands and feet were always freezing cold no matter how warm it was outside, but it wasn't until the lead doctor ordered the expensive-as-hell scan of Peter's heart that they'd discovered how bad it really was.
“It’s just for the prep, hon,” said Tony.  “We can switch again once you're ready.”
Steve breathed out a shaky breath, his lower lip quivering as he gave a short nod, burrowing back into Tony's side.
And then Schmidt turns his back on Steve and lifts himself out of the pool, shaking his head and muttering as the announcer comes over the loudspeakers to announce the winners.
"But that's—that's
"Master Peter is currently sleeping comfortably, Captain," JARVIS said gently. "However, I am afraid that I cannot say the same for you."
"Hold on, hon, just wait, okay? I think we do need to talk about this. I mean it, 'cause babe, you don't look so good, and—"
"Sometimes," Wanda answered, obviously confused. "But I don't see how—?"
"Oh, and now you suddenly need our help? What the hell for?" demanded Sam. The golden circle was still spinning and throwing off sparks, and, as Steve looked past Dr Strange, he could've sworn that he saw the inside some kind of building behind him, as though he'd simply stepped through the circle from his home directly into the park.
Steve thought as he tore his gaze away.
"State your business here, sir," the woman on the right side said, rather firmly.
"We're gonna get him back, Pete, I promise," Dad had said. "You just gotta hang in there for us, okay?"
"Thank you, Sharon," Steve said softly, gently squeezing Sharon's shoulder. "For everything."
Steve's head was spinning, his stomach so clenched he felt like he might be sick as he forced himself to look at the computer screen again, wishing he could read Russian and at the same time grateful that he couldn't.
“It’s all right, honey,” Tony whispered as he gave his hand a squeeze.  “Keep going.”
Steve tipped his head, briefly closing his eyes as Anthony continued on, listening carefully to the sound of his voice as he instructed them on the proper takeoff procedures for a space launch. His voice was so unique, low and melodic, with a slightly raspy quality that Steve had noticed in Peter as well. He had also noticed that both Peter and Anthony tended to speak faster the more excited or passionate they were about something.
"Oh," Peter said as his shoulders sagged. "Well, yeah, but does that mean you can't come tomorrow?"
"At the moment pretty much anything out of the ordinary worries me," answered Tony. "But since my anxiety level is already close to bumping up against the atmospheric barrier, then I s'pose this'll just slam it right up against it."
"Dad?" Peter said as he frantically scanned the barren, dusty rock where his father had stood literally seconds before. He let out a hard shiver as the all-too-familiar ice bolt raced down his spine, telling him that something was very, very wrong.
"All right, buddy," Dad murmured. "Then that's where we'll go."
"Oh, I
"You've never had a crush before, have you," said Uncle Bucky.
"Really?" Tony asked, wrinkling his nose. Even after over three years together, he still wasn't quite used to the compliments that Steve showered him with on a daily basis. He had quite a bit of experience with flattery, both somewhat sincere and some not-so-much, especially during his playboy days before Peter came along, but he'd never really experienced much in the way of being complimented.
Breathing in as deep a breath as he could manage, Steve attempted to relax his arms and legs, using the biofeedback method he had researched the morning after his first bad nightmare.  Since those nightmares had seen fit to begin tormenting him more and more often lately, he had actually become fairly proficient at the method, and soon found himself actually drifting off again as he tried to refocus the pain burning through his body as a means to stay warm instead of harm.
"Oh, and one bag of gummy worms," Peter added as he reached for his wallet, praying Gwen hadn't noticed that his hands were shaking. He somehow managed to pay for everything without dropping his card on the sticky floor, and even managed to pull up their electronic tickets without spilling anything.
"Well, that sure won't be anything new," answered Dad. "The man is about as perfect as they come."
Pulling back his right hand again, Steve had just stepped into his swing when something grabbed his arm, yanking him backwards so hard that he tripped, flopping down onto the mat in an undignified heap.
"C'mon, sweetheart," he said, offering Tony his arm. "Let's make our final rounds, shall we?"
A short pause followed, one where Tony could almost picture the UI tilting his head as he thought.
"Okay, but… then what?" Scott asked after a short pause. "No offence, but how does that help anything?"
"Hill reported a few bumps and bruises, but other than that it was mainly just property damage." Natasha paused, giving Steve a knowing smile. "And she also told me that the Stark Relief Foundation has already pledged to replace all of the destroyed vendor stalls and any lost merchandise, so…"
And he looked positively
a good night for the Mets.
Steve's lips twitched into one of his lopsided, goofy grins that Tony adored.
"That was so yummy. Thank you," Peter said once he was done, smacking his lips as he downed the last of his orange juice. The whole time he'd been eating, Grandma had sat in her chair across the room, a pair of glasses perched on her nose and reading a dog-eared novel. "But you didn't need to sit in here with me. I know you probably have a lot of other things that you'd rather be doing."
"Yeah, I might know a bit of what that's like," Natasha said with a slight smile. "And then you started your HYDRA campaigns."
"Dad—"
"Once I build it," said Tony. "And I still have to build and test mine first, so it's probably gonna be awhile."
Steve thought as he began a rough sketch of the nice log cabin sitting about twenty-five metres away.
"Well, then he probably won't miss these too much," said Tony. He looked over at his husband, attempting to bat his eyelashes without being too obvious. "Are we done here?"
“Well, then I’ll be looking forward to it,” Steve said, his grip on his belt loosening slightly.  “Now, would you happen to need any bookmarks to go with your new books?”
And then a few lines later, a sentence that practically jumped from the screen and bit Steve on the nose.
Steve yelled.
"Oh, thank you!" Gwen exclaimed. "Thank you, I really appreciate it. Um… I guess I'll… um…"
"Good afternoon, sir," JARVIS said once he was up and running. "How may I be of assistance?"
It doesn’t matter to Steve.  He knows his loudest fans aren’t even in the stands at all.
Steve gave a nod. "Sounds good."
The king nodded, clasping his hands in front of him as Steve gestured to Tony and Peter. "This is my husband and son, Tony Stark and Peter Stark-Rogers. You may better know Tony as—"
The file containing Beck's proposal arrived about ten seconds after the monitor went blank, titled Illusion Technology: A Revolutionary Breakthrough with Limitless Applications. Tony smirked as he tapped it open, thinking that it was painfully obvious that Beck had gone to Stanford instead of Tony's alma mater of MIT. In Tony's experience, Stanford engineers had always had an extra flair for the dramatic.
"No, no, I shouldn't've said that, honey," Tony murmured. "You know how I am."
“This is when I usually get in, Obie,” Tony finally replied.  “The only weird part about it is you being here in my office before I get here.”
Peter chuckled, punctuated by another cough. "Yeah, that's the one. I'll show it to you the next time you come."
Tony thought.  Of course he’d forgotten all about it.
Mr Rogers chuckles.  “The front crawl will do fine, little guy.  Can you go down and back for me please?”
Suddenly the entire screen of Tony's workstation lit up, with numbers scrolling by so quickly that he almost couldn't keep up.
"Okay. That's good."
Steve drew in a deep breath, his eyes already fuzzy with unshed tears at the looks of awe from his teammates. "No longer am I going to be just another piece in someone’s game. From this day forward, our world will be going forward! This is the fight of our lives, and we're gonna win it!"
Tony huffed, wishing so badly that he could confide in Steve. But they had only been together for two weeks, and Tony wasn't quite sure if he was ready to pull him into his whole let's-take-down-the-government plan just yet.
"Very well. Then I am estimating it would take one week's time to complete the upgrade on all units, if in fact it is your desire to not deactivate them while they are being upgraded."
"To her house?" Uncle Bucky cut in, looking confused. "To meet her parents?"
"Oh, yeah?" Sam laughed. "So then, what is close enough?"
“Ahh,” Peter said with a nod.  “Yeah, I guess that makes more sense.”  He snuck a glance at the man, noting that the nametag pinned to his denim button-down shirt said “Steve”, written in the same block-like font used for the aisle labels.
special edition sets took up the prominent space on his top shelf, but he had a feeling that the
Only this time, they would actually be guilty.
And then the gifts, well… Tony had to admit that the team had outdone themselves. He was positive that Peter had never before been as spoiled as he was on that morning, opening gift after gift of everything from more geeky, science-nerd t-shirts—a favourite thing for Bruce to give him—to his very own new car—from Tony and Steve, although Bucky had chosen the colours for it—to his very own fish tank and accessories from Bucky and Sam, complete with a cute little blue and gold betta that he promptly named Finley.
"All right," Tony said with a nod. "You catch that, JARVIS?"
"The Avengers!" exclaimed Peter. "Will my dad be there?"
"Wakanda?" demanded Quill. "What the hell's in Wakanda?"
"Okay, that's good," Tony said as he tweaked the knee joint of his newest suit design, one that he had dubbed Igor. "About how many tons can he hold now?"
"All right," Steve answered. He wasn't the least bit hungry, but he knew if he didn't eat something that Tony would worry about him, and the last thing that Tony needed was even more worry added to his already overburdened mind.
"I don't—I don't—" he muttered, dragging his eyes over to where Quill's ship sat. It was listing badly to the left, and featured a still-smoking hole in what he suspected was one of the engines, which meant it had likely lost a good amount of its fuel. Nothing too surprising, really. After Thanos had pulled a goddamn
O'Brien was
And if he has his way, he’ll be doing it with Tony by his side.  Which is why, thirty minutes later when they’re both safely back on the Quinjet and tucked under warming blankets with IV fluids flowing into their veins, Steve extends his hand towards Tony, gasping in relief when Tony doesn’t hesitate to take it.
He would either be chosen to receive the serum, or he would die. It was as simple as that.
"Huh?" Clint said, as if on cue, prompting Natasha to jab an elbow into his leg. "Ow! Why's everyone picking on me all of a sudden?"
In the middle of another giant sip of milkshake, Peter could only nod his head, squeezing his eyes closed when a brain freeze suddenly attacked. After finishing the
Steve heaved out a sigh, pecking Tony on the nose. "I hate how paranoid I've gotten lately."
"Well, maybe once you buy the ring it'll just come to you," Steve said. He peeked at his timepiece, his belly swooping when he saw it was already 2045. "Um… I've gotta get going so… you still think I look okay?"
Steve gave a grim nod. "When it's quiet, yes. I think we'll still be okay while the music's playing though. From my experience the communications equipment doesn't enjoy a lot of background noise."
but it's not working. Like, not at
“Mmm,” mutters Tony.  “You should probably try and sleep a little, yeah?  Let the serum go to work on you?”
"Oh, sorry, Papa!" Peter said, barely breaking stride. "Uncle Sam said we've still got twenty minutes till the food's ready, so Pietro and I are gonna go play frisbee golf."
“I sure am, little guy,” Steve said.  He tossed Peter a smile across the shelf, relieved when Peter returned it without hesitation.  He’d been looking forward to this Friday evening all week, and was even more grateful that the anticipation had seemed to quell his nightmares a bit.  Tony’s insistence on pleading with him to get some help had led to their first bad argument a few days ago, an argument that had no doubt also been fuelled by some stressful issues that Tony was dealing with at work.  And while they had both since apologised, and had absolutely incredible makeup sex, Steve was still a bit on edge from it.
He’s not doing anything here that he hasn’t done hundreds of times, so his fear can just go fuck itself.
A nervous smile stretched across Peter's full lips. "Is that a good thing?"
“Pretty sure I don't need to pardon you for that,” Steve replied, relieved when his voice didn't break.  It was bad enough he hadn’t even been able to stop his fingers from shaking long enough to tie his own stupid tie.
And Steve had been only too happy to oblige, especially since despite being able to fall asleep rather easily, he had been plagued by nightmares too. Horrible dreams of Langaran soldiers dressed in enemy uniforms breaking into his ma's house to steal Peter away, or renegade missiles embossed with the crest of the Langaran Air Corps but launched from the Meridian border, all aiming directly for Tony.
"All night, which is what's worrying me," Maria answered. "And the batteries for the handlamps are so expensive, so it's not really feasible to keep Tony's on while he's sleeping, and yet—"
"Oh," Steve said, allowing himself a genuine smile. Of course Tony would already be thinking of something like that. "That'll hopefully be better press for us than another destroyed building."
By four one-hundredths of a second.
Gathering up his books and computer, Peter quickly checked his phone as he waited for Gwen, making note of the text from Papa that he'd be arriving to pick him up in about ten minutes. That likely meant that Dad was still working on the SHIELD data with Uncle Bruce, which also meant that Peter might even get to see some of it. Aside from the fact that he really enjoyed working with Dad and Uncle Bruce—he especially loved to listen to them bicker in their "science-speak", as Papa called it—Peter was already fascinated by Wakanda and was very eager to learn more about it.
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
When Steve realised that while Tony had made it home, Peter had not.
"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure we're already beyond that point," Tony said. "We've gotta tell him something, hon. He deserves to know what's going on."
"A job running errands for a scientist," Maria finished, quirking an impatient eyebrow. "Who then—"
He broke off, but Tony caught his unspoken words anyway. "
And then, as Steve watched, his eyes burning with tears just as flaming hot as the immense power coursing through Tony's makeshift nanite gauntlet, his husband, none other than Iron Man himself and the strongest person that Steve had ever seen in his life, looked Thanos straight in the eye, his lips pursed in defiant determination.
something Peter would wish on anyone. Even now, sitting in his classroom, Peter could recall the crushing terror and overwhelming pain threatening to steal his breath just as easily as if he were back up there, on that barren rock of a planet.
It just didn't make any sense.
"And they are, Tony," Fury stated. "But pardon me if I'm trying to be just a bit more cautious with the king of a formerly very reclusive country."
"Peter, I'm right here," she murmured. "You saved me, remember?"
Tony had always called Steve a terrible liar, because he was. Both he and Peter, their eyes were simply incapable of perpetuating any type of falsehood. But apparently Tony's once-proficient ability to spin stories to his advantage had slipped badly in the last few years when Steve shifted up onto his elbow, tilting Tony's chin up to look at him.
Shifting his gaze back to the man, Steve narrowed his eyes and pursed his lips, begging his body to keep his rising panic contained.  While his serum procedure—and his subsequent dancing monkey time with the USO—had precluded the usual survival training the WWII Army soldiers had been required to complete, Steve had learned enough from the Army manuals and from leading his HYDRA missions to know that he absolutely could not show even a dram of weakness to his captors.
Padding back to his lab, Tony set down his mug, tapping his monitors to life. He leaned back in his chair, studying the mockup of the nanite Captain America uniform he'd had JARVIS get started on while he was waiting for Steve's call.
"Aahh, did you guys just hear that?" Tomis said, his jaw hanging open so wide it looked unhinged. "'Cause with all the missiles we were firing earlier I'm thinking that my ears must've got messed up, so—"
Peter waved as Papa exited the parking lot, then went inside, dodging the boisterous upperclassmen as he headed for his locker which was thankfully in the same hallway as it had been the previous year. He had just managed to get it unlocked and opened when Ned suddenly appeared behind him, shoving a magazine right in front of his nose.
A few seconds later the three faces appeared on Tony's dashboard screen, all looking confused.
All the better to sneak up on a possible enemy, he supposed.
"Tony," Tony cut in. "Call me Tony."
"I will, Captain," replied Wanda. "Thank you."
Bucky's eyes went wide. "Actually, I have, when I got fitted for this," he said, indicating his brand-new prosthetic arm. Tony had constructed it using Peter's design, building it from the very same metal that he used to build the container for the tesseract. "They were talking so fast that I could barely understand every third word they were saying!"
Tony nodded, pulling off his glasses so he could tuck in closer. "Steve, you just gotta promise me that you'll be careful, okay? After what happened today I have to admit that I'm starting to get a lot more twitchy about things, and now with Rhodey saying that you've gotta meet with the general, I'm just—"
He had just turned the page a bit beyond halfway through the book when a particular drawing caught his eye, one of a bird perched on the side of a large nest while three small chicks poked their heads out, eagerly awaiting the fat worm caught in the mother bird's beak. As he studied it Tony's heart began to thud, his belly swooping violently as he realised where he'd seen it before.
"Yeah, I'm not surprised," said Tony. "Pete's about as smart as they come."
"Thanks." Tony turned back to Lang, narrowing his eyes. "Now, am I correct in assuming that since you were able to hack into the bank records of those idiots that you stole from, that you're pretty good with cyber security?"
being such an open book all the time. No matter how hard he tried to hide stuff, both Dad and Papa were able to pretty much read him perfectly with just a brief glance, and his aunt and uncles only took a few seconds longer.
Steve reached for Tony's hand, holding it as though it were a delicate piece of porcelain. "I don't quite have all of the facts yet, mainly because it's too dangerous to be asking the kinds of questions I would need to ask. But based on what I've been able to find out so far, there's a pretty specific reason why my ma wasn't given any compensation or government benefits after my father's death. From the very moment that Colonel Phillips knocked on her door and told her that Papa was dead, she was cut off from all of his pay and other military benefits. And then, when I was only a couple weeks old she was served an eviction notice, stating that if she didn't find a job within the next two weeks that both of us would be kicked out of the house."
"Helen's scheduled another set of x-rays for your hands day after tomorrow, buddy," Dad said quietly once they were all settled on the couch, with Peter in his usual spot between his dads and Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam on the loveseat opposite them. "And once the splints are off, I'm gonna need your help with some stuff in the lab, okay? I was gonna wait on it until we got back to the city, but now…"
A proposition that would now have to wait until Steve got back, in two to three weeks’ time.
"Oh gods, yes," Sharon said, nodding swiftly. "That, and they don't complain about stuff nearly as much as adults do." She gave her keyboard a tap and grabbed another chart off the counter, one so thick that its binding was starting to fray. "There is another kid who just came in early this morning, though, and I'd wager that he would really appreciate some company. Especially from a hotshot pilot like yourself."
“Um…”
"Sergeant Barnes reports all is well in the movie theatre, sir, Captain."
"I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but I don't agree," said Gamora.
Hearing Peter call Steve ‘Papa’ like it was the most natural thing in the world, as if Steve had been there from the very beginning, only cemented the deal.
"Mmm, more like he taught me," said Tony. He huffed out a sharp breath. "But what's all this got to do with your ma?"
And failing so completely that he then almost laughed.
"Nearly dying," Pym suddenly spoke up, his tone icy enough to freeze the blood in Howard's veins. "
"I am grateful, Captain," T'Challa said, glancing around him as Peter, Shuri, and the twins came bursting out of a side palace entrance, their laughter echoing across the yard. "And in more ways than one. It is not often that my sister is able to enjoy being the teenager that she is, so spending this week with your younger team members has been good for her as well. She was very close to our father, and mourning him has not been easy for her."
"Which is really all that matters, when it comes down to it," said Ma. "My parents never gave me their blessing to marry Joseph, but that didn't mean we weren't happy."
He was living, breathing proof of Stane’s crimes.
"Was that her leaving in the police car with her father?" Papa asked. "He waved at us when we pulled in."
But it still fucking
"Oh, and like you haven't been spending most of your free time with Betty lately?" Peter shot back. "You're with her every day after school!"
"Yes. All right," answered Steve. He'd only been introduced to the tall, broad warrior right before the battle began, but he supposed if King T'Challa had trusted him enough to have him close to his side on the front lines, then he must be okay.
But not today. Today, all Peter wanted was to cuddle with his beautiful girlfriend while they watched a movie about one of his very favourite fictional characters before she got on an airplane to fly halfway across the world early the next morning.
And I also can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
“That sounds great, buddy,” he said into Peter’s hair.  “Just promise me one thing, yeah?”
Tony watched as Steve's throat bobbed as he struggled to swallow, his tight jaw twitching. "Yes, I know," he said softly, clearing his throat. "So, if this theory is true, then have we identified the water monster yet?"
Which was all par for the course with Peter. Aside from a few psychopathic criminals and a couple of schoolyard bullies, Tony hadn't met a single person who didn't absolutely adore his sweet boy.
Welcome to my new superfamily story!  New chapters will post weekly until the story concludes.  😊
"Indeed she has, Captain," JARVIS said. "I will also of course inform you if there are any changes in Master Peter's condition."
"Goddamn idiots," he muttered under his breath as he called up the schematic of his latest suit, one he was planning to keep stored in the Stark Industries chopper in case of an emergency. He had already stored two suits in the SI jet, a spare one in the Quinjet, and was in the process of building another to keep in Steve's truck stowed under the passenger seat. With new villains literally popping up every couple of months he figured he couldn't be too careful, and Steve had agreed.
Instantly the image shifted, the millions of pixels rearranging themselves into a picture of the main square of the Miami bunker. Fires burned in nearly all directions as the horrible sounds of the battle filled the panic room, explosions and gunshots and repulsor blasts interspersed with Hulk's terrifying roars. Steve gasped as his eyes landed on Image Peter dangling from one of the upper-level railings, his frightened face covered in dust and soot.
“Maybe this weekend, Papa?” Peter asked as he and Tony stepped into the living room.  Steve’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of them, his two beloved boys that looked and acted so much alike, and who he loved beyond reason.
"No, I'm not really sure that it will," Peter mumbled. He leaned forward, reaching for his tablet on the coffee table. "I—we—um… we got a new assignment in our Government class yesterday, we're supposed to choose one of the bills that are pending debate in the Senate and write about it… and when I went looking through them, I—I found—I found—"
Slowly, Peter released his grip on the table, flexing his stiff fingers. "Um… well, that's a bit surprising I guess, seeing as how adamant he was that the Spider-Man was some kind of menace to society."
"Yeah. That's exactly what it is," Steve whispered back. He brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing it over his ring. "But does that make it any less likely to work? I mean, if anyone could even attempt to figure this stuff out, it's you and Bruce."
Steve thinks, drawing in a deep breath.
"That
"Oh no!" Peter yelped as the panel began to close behind him. "Um, I don't think I have a choice anymore."
"Really?" Peter squawked, which made Tony's eyebrows shoot up. "What's he look like?"
"Did Papa tell you all of his plans for you once you're all healed up?" he asked, forcing the words past the lump in his throat.
"I guess," Peter said with a shrug. "I'm gonna take it that way, anyway." He gathered up his backpack, pulling his glasses out from one of the side pockets and slipping them on. It had been getting harder and harder for him to keep his vision focused as the practise wore on, and he was starting to get a headache.
but—I gotta talk to my dads first before I say anything, okay?"
"We love you, Peter," added Papa. "Sleep well."
anniversary. Yeah, I guess it's kinda important, isn't it?" Tony said, his attempt at humour thwarted by the trembling in his lower lip as he reached for Steve's left hand, and the ring that sat on his third finger. Unlike Tony's, which hadn't left his finger since Steve placed it there almost three—
Peter rolled his eyes.
For a moment Steve could only gape at his friend, knowing that he was absolutely right, but wishing like hell that he wasn't.
"Oh yeah, I did," said Peter. He gave Tony a sheepish look. "That okay? I know we were supposed to work some more on the repulsors later, but—"
He'd wait until they got back from their vacation to bring it up. No sense in him trying to push things while everyone was still extra twitchy.
"That's a pretty diplomatic response for someone who could be completely justified in hating the man's very name," O'Brien said with a rather sinister smile. "Very noble of you, Captain. Not that I would expect anything less, of course, but it is still quite admirable."
Hence their argument.
Steve's reply got caught in his throat as Tony's hand slipped beneath the elastic of his pants, his nimble fingers curling around his already aching erection as he caught Steve's lips again, his tongue slipping into Steve's mouth to taste him. Sensation flooded Steve's body like a wave as he met Tony's tongue with his own, chasing away the throbbing, fiery pain, and he wrapped his arms around Tony's middle, shifting him so he was straddling Steve's waist.
Pressing his lips to the back of Peter's hand, Steve sucked in a shaky breath, swiping the tears from his cheeks as he glanced up at the wall clock. It was already 0730, which meant that Tony would likely be waking up soon. Dr Cho had given him something to help him sleep around three in the morning, after she had assured him that Peter was stabilised, but Steve highly doubted that Tony would be able to last the entire eight hours the sleep aid was supposed to give him. He had first tried to refuse it, only relenting after Steve literally begged him to take it, promising he would wake him if anything else happened. The last thing that Steve needed at the moment was more of Tony's second-guessing and self-hatred, neither of which helped with anything besides making Steve even more anxious and upset.
It took Steve's muddled mind at least three heartbeats to process Sam's words.
"Yeah, I know, 'cause the Mets suck," grumbled Bucky, folding his arms across his chest. "Hmph. Our ole Dodgers wouldn't've treated me like this."
“Yeah,” says Tony.
"Oh, that's good," Peter breathed. "That's really,
Another slow song began once the first one was over, and Peter breathed a slight sigh of relief, tucking Gwen as close as he could without being creepy, not wanting the warmth to end.
"He didn't try and hurt you, did he?" Dad asked. "'Cause if he did, then—"
"Steve," Bruce suddenly said over the comm. "Helen and I are on our way, we're just a couple minutes out. Try and keep him as warm as possible until we get there, okay? Skin to skin contact would be best if you can do it."
"Yep," said Quill. "He's wearing 'em in some big, fancy golden glove on his left hand, like they're his trophies or something."
"Well, all right then," said Sam. "If we're really gonna do this, what're our orders?"
Tony sniffed, trying very hard to keep his expression neutral. With Steve acting as his military escort Tony wouldn't have to worry about having to leave the hospital before curfew began, which would alleviate about eighty-three point nine nine percent of his stress.
to. If he gave up now, then that would be it.
Sleep could wait.
The sergeant shook his head. "No, sir," he replied. "I'm so sorry, I was in here prepping to receive your aircraft, and… all I saw was a bright flash of yellow."
of the ground beneath his boots causing a mild shiver to race up his spine. He had to admit that the Gobi desert was a fairly decent hiding place for a HYDRA base since it was so sparsely populated, even if he wished it was anywhere other than yet another frozen tundra.
"I will," Peter said, attempting a smile. Then he reached for the open bus window, trying to calculate if it was wide enough for him to slip through when Ned's head suddenly whipped around, his eyes going so wide that they nearly popped out of his head.
Silence fell across the gym as the entire team gave a collective shudder, with Gwen finally clearing her throat.
Tony nodded, tapping his chin. "All right. And if we did that, and I just happened to meet Hulk's fist with mine head-on, then—?"
"You're going bonkers, is what you're doing," Peter said. "And yeah, I know I'm not eighteen yet, like eighteen is some magical number when suddenly everything's gonna make sense or something, but I can still see that you're not good, Dad. And you haven't been good for a long time now, and it—it scares me. And it scares Papa too, he's just gotten better at hiding it."
"Uhh, you sure you got enough fuel to be doing that, Joe?" asked Tomis. "Thought you said you were getting low!"
" he said again. He pressed a light kiss to Tony's lips, his thumb brushing across his cheekbone. "I need to say this, and I need you to hear it. Please?"
Steve smiled as he brushed his lips across Tony's. "I can't wait."
Thor shook his head, staring down at the ground, where his axe had fallen once Thanos disappeared. Steve took another step towards him, preparing to shake an answer out of him if necessary when he heard Bucky's voice behind him.
Peter huffed, but nodded anyway. "Uh huh."
"Yep," Tony said. "Go for it."
"I'm just informing you, Stark, that Thanos will be a more difficult challenge than even the technomage who brought us here," said Dr Strange. "Which means we must be prepared."
"Yeah, they seem good too. No harm done."
Sigh... 😞
"Yeah, and when he did go he was bored out of his skull," Tony grumbled. "None of the goddamn teachers could even attempt to keep up with him, so they just labelled him a problem and didn't even try."
"Ah, don't worry about it. I'm keeping a tab."
“That's my man,” Dad said, smiling widely.  “C’mon, honey.  Let’s kick this monster’s ass.”
But this… this was no joke. What they were going to attempt to do would literally alter the course of their entire universe.
Steve shook his head, frowning. "Yeah, but still—wait, what? Who's everyone?"
"Yeah, but… you don't—you only just met me?"
Peter shrugged. "You're my papa's best friend, so… that means you're our family."
"Yeah, I heard about it," Tony said casually, even as his grip tightened on the tablet. "That's too bad for your friend."
"C'mon, babe," he added, pressing another kiss to Steve's forehead. "Let's just try and go to sleep, yeah? Nothing we can do about anything now."
"Uh huh. Bye."
Steve clung tightly to Tony's hand while Happy wheeled him down the hall to the operating room, with Peter giving Tony a sheepish look over his surgical mask once he got inside.
The monitor blinked as lines of text appeared, with Tony's grip on Steve's hand getting tighter as they read a transcript of Peter and his friends discussing the colour of Steve's eyes and the shape of Tony's facial hair and then playing a few rounds of Clue. Steve's jaw involuntarily clenched as he read several sentences of what appeared to be a not-so-friendly exchange between Peter and his classmate Flash regarding the battle in Miami, followed directly by Peter saying that he needed some air.
Tony grimaced as the ornate wooden doors opened into the Senate Armed Forces Committee's chambers, the nearly overwhelming smell of the place hitting him like a brick wall, a bad combination of old Cuban cigar smoke and verbal bullshit. He had always hated this particular room, the very same room where that old fucker Senator Stern had tried to drag him through the mud over three years ago, trying to force him into turning over his Iron Man armour to the government, or more specifically, to HYDRA. Nick Fury had accompanied Tony to those hearings, eventually proposing a deal with the Joint Chiefs that allowed Rhodey access to one armoured suit—aptly named War Machine—under the condition that he and only he would have access to it.
They found Papa and Dad waiting in Papa's truck in the parking lot, where Peter's gaze was drawn to the unmarked police car just exiting the school's property, with Gwen riding in the front seat.
“Uh huh, I won’t,” Peter said with a rather triumphant smile.  “Thanks.”
"We're just gonna work on homework and eat dinner," Peter said a few seconds later. "It's not that big of a deal."
Steve had not only scared Peter, he had
And all too soon he'd be sixteen, and driving, and then off to college not too long after that, and then—
Steve smiled, curling his arm around Tony's waist. "That's great, little guy. You should probably send a few pictures to Gwen, don't you think?"
"I appreciate it," O'Brien said as he grabbed a crystal highball glass, pouring himself a generous shot of the whisky. He took a sip, swirling the amber liquid around in his mouth before swallowing, his eyes glued to Steve the entire time.
He just wished so badly that it didn't have to be that way. That somehow all the demons would suddenly just get tired of tormenting him and his family, and up and leave.
His lungs burning for air and his legs screaming for mercy, Steve slowed his pace as he approached the training dome, allowing himself a courtesy glance at the building that had been all but abandoned since the snap. He supposed if one could possibly find a silver lining in the last few months, it was that Thanos either managed to snap all of the potential Avenger villains out of existence, or they were all simply too scared to try something in the still-chaotic aftermath.
"Nah, it's okay," Tony said quickly. "I'll be the first to admit that Pete's unique abilities have come in pretty handy lately, and you know he likes to feel useful, so…"
"Will ya just let me help you?" she said as she grabbed the cup, holding it so he could drink from the straw. "You've got two really messed up hands, Steve, so according to Bruce, you shouldn't be grabbing much of anything for a least the next three to five days."
"Really?" Desire was already coursing through Steve's body at MACH-1, and he was cursing the fact that he still had to drive them home. "I'll—there's room in my footlocker, so you could store some of your clothes in there if you want. And I could bring you into the locker room with me to shower in the mornings, and—"
me, I only thought that you did.  And that's gonna be something I’ll have to live with for the rest of my life.”  He stepped forward, eyeing Obie up and down.  “But at least the rest of my life will no longer include you.”
Pepper let out a sigh, hugging her clipboard to her chest.  “Pardon me if this seems out of line, Mr Stark, but… I’ve noticed a difference in you recently.  You’ve been… I don't know… happier?  Like you're not carrying so much weight around on your shoulders?”
"Really," Steve answered as he pressed a kiss to Tony's scalp. "It's one of the first things I noticed about you."
And maybe, just maybe, Steve would now be able to let go of some of the guilt he'd been carrying ever since the Miami battle.
Steve was quiet for a moment, his jaw twitching slightly as he thought. "You know Bucky would do it," he finally said. "Especially if he thought it would help Peter as well."
Tony thought, rolling his eyes as he peeked over the edge of the platform. He was busily studying the shimmering spikes when he suddenly felt something odd tap him on the shoulder. Whipping around, Tony raised his repulsor to find the wizard's long maroon cloak hovering in midair, almost like it was awaiting orders or something.
"We've just—we've just gotta get him inside, little guy, then—"
“Um…”
"Well, yeah, it is, but… no one's ever called me by the whole thing except my grandma, and she died when I was ten." He sucked in a deep breath as he looked over at Steve. "Your ma took care of her when she got sick, remember?"
"Hmm…" Tony muttered as he walked slowly around the hologram, tweaking a few things here and there. Fifty million Newtons would probably be enough to withstand Hulk if he was just standing still, but since Tony could not actually imagine Hulk just standing still—and even less so if he was going bonkers—then it wasn't going to be enough.
It’s like Tony has just up and vanished.
Plunking himself down onto his chair, Tony reached for the phone, his left hand slowly curling into a tight fist as he not-so-patiently listened to the five messages left by various members of the Air Corps leadership, all requesting—
"I hope you're right, kiddo," Uncle Bucky said. He tipped his head back, rubbing at his closed eyes and looking so downtrodden that a knot rose in Peter's throat.
Twenty minutes later, Peter curled his frozen hands into fists and grabbed his glasses, sliding them on so he could read what he had just finished typing out.
"No, I think I'll just stay here for awhile, if that's okay," she said. She patted Peter's shoulder, and Peter practically melted at her kind, gentle touch, one that reminded him a lot of Ms Sharon. Maybe staying there wouldn't be so bad after all. He was in Papa's old room, after all.
"Steve? You okay back there?" Sam asked, glancing through the rearview mirror.
"I think what they're saying is that it might be possible for Tony and Bruce to use the Quantum Realm as a kind of a spyglass," Steve said. "A way to view all of the possible outcomes without actually changing them."
"Pietro, what's in the container?" Steve asked. "What did you find?"
And there, on that barren, desolate planet, it took everything.
Tony shoots Steve a look that might’ve been kind of funny if it weren’t so downright miserable.  “You are seriously pulling rank on me right now?  Down here, where we have no idea where the hell we are, and—?”
And why shouldn't it be, really?
“Um… yeah,” he says quickly.  He clears his throat as he indicates the mounted guns.  “These here look a lot like the pulse cannons that Johann Schmidt built back during the war, using energy he channelled from the Tesseract.  They’re definitely a HYDRA design, and they pack quite a wallop, so we’ll have to make sure we all stay on our toes.”
Sam had said.
It was several heartbeats before Dad could answer.
Steve gulped at the boy's suspicious tone, the way his brown eyes swept across his uniform in only partially-concealed disgust. It was definitely not something that Steve was used to experiencing.
And after having to watch in horror as that light almost flickered into nothingness following Tony's self-sacrificing flight into space, Steve had grown even more attached to it. The way it shone through the thin, ratty t-shirts Tony often wore, its ever-present hum that Steve could hear in place of a heartbeat, and the warmth it radiated whenever Steve touched it with his hands or lips while they made love.
"Well, Sam and I went on a lot of picnics back in the beginning," answered Bucky. "There's a nice spot east of the ball field that's great for stargazing, if you're into that kinda thing."
"I—I, you've—" Carol sputtered. "Okay, that is
"Ah, he'll be up for it," Carol said as she elbowed James in the arm. "He's pretty good at smooth-talking."
“How ‘bout you let Steve and I talk about it while I drive him back, yeah, bud?” Tony said as he stood up from the couch, with Steve quickly following suit.  “Think you can get yourself ready for bed while I’m gone?”
"Good," said Sam as he raised his arms over his head, trying to stifle a yawn as he stretched. "'Cause I gotta say, it hasn't been easy on me to watch you like this either, and I don't even like you as much as Tony does, so…"
If he did, then they likely had a new and very big problem.
"Dad," Peter said, in that dragged-out, whiny voice he always used when he thought Tony was being too unfun. "It's not like that. He's been helping me with some of the code and designs for the project and then he usually naps for a while in the chair. It's really no big deal."
