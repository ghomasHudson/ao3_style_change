Steve seemed hesitant, “I still think this is a awful idea, the guy has problems…there’s no way we can take this. There is a lot of evil in the world but monsters? That’s just not real.”
The scratch of the alphas facial hair against his cheek, neck and chest. The smoky scent of cologne and oil that balanced into something so comforting. It felt like home. “Tony…”
“As one would expect Sir.”
The asset looked at the metallic sounding growl. It was the one in the Iron suit,  Tony Stark ..Stark…Mission incomplete?
Wendy made indignant little squalls while her brother laughed.
Stark gasp scandalized, holing a hand over the reactor, “ye of little faith, I’m a changed man Steve. I’ll have you know I had no intention of skirt chasing, unless you feel up to doing a lap in that backless number they’ve got you in.”
Loki let out a shaking breath in the darkness and rolled close to his side. For the first time in what felt like weeks, Loki was warm as he pressed against his chest. Warm, plait and just...beautiful. “You have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that.”
“Twins Steve, two…two babies. Not one but two so there’s…twins. Oh god I need a drink…do I get two drinks? I feel like that is fair right? One scotch per fetus?“ Tony finally shot out of the seat and Steve was really confused when the alpha grabbed his face and kissed him full on the mouth with everything he had.  When they parted, Simmons was just standing there red in the face trying to avert her eyes and Bruce was just standing off to the side, as all of this was completely normal.
The Widow.
“Let's hope it doesn't come to that then.” he smiled back
“Are you ok?”  His alpha asked, allowing him to take shelter against his chest.
Maybe that’s what made the decision to stay so much easier for him.
Steve was having a full on panic attack, gasping for are on his hands and knees. The thick bulletproof/ hulk testing glass - Tony ‘barrowed’ from Bruce’s lab to set up the prank. Now sported a huge crack, although judging by the blood smears on Steve’s carpet; the super soldier’s fists took the majority of the damage.
Then he tilted his head, glancing over Happy's shoulder as Bruce picked up Peter and cast him and look of... Pity? Why... what was this...
James smiled at the memory then shook his head and wondered why he thought today would be any different. The alpha wasn't very upset though, what were a few moments extra if it helped his mate feel a bit more confident?
“How ya feelin?”  The soldier’s voice rumbled behind him, punctuated by a kiss on the gods shoulder.
Anything was possible; the omega welfare council probably published it. He should really look into that. There could be some sort of nefarious plots in the works there. Alternatively, maybe it was his sleep-addled brain just trying to make sense   of why he was awake at a time like this. Especially when tiny knees in the ribs or sty fingers on his eyelids were not waking them up.
Phil said he didn‘t know much other than Fury had left Shield with out a word. Considering Maria was planning to kick him out anyway was moot.
She smiled thoughtfully, “No, but that doesn't mean you can't pick up a phone. We all should have made that clearer to you. Don't do this alone Loki, it won't end well and I don't want to see you or James suffer for that.”
It's never just words not when you're already broken. They just fall on top and for into you slowly- bringing up other words from your head.
“Ok, this will be a little cold.” The doctor said before applying the transmission gel to his lower stomach. She must have noticed the slight unease and smiled brightly. “Would you like to know how it works? It’s quite interesting.”
“So what does this all mean, will I need to take some kind of supplements to…balance?”
The ravenette let out an appreciative hum. "Hello darling."
Sure… rumors said the alpha was promiscuous in his youth, taking to bed anything he fancied. Maybe Steve was just some sort of oddity, the best of both worlds, Tony had been curious and now that curiosity was filled. That made sense; the billionaire could add ‘captain America’ to the notched on his bedpost.
Steve smirked, “As I recall there wasn’t much talking, and my coms are on and I don’t thing Tasha and Clint need to know the details.”
“This is the way I wanted to do it. As much as I trust Jarvis, we don't always have to do things at light speed ya know. It's good to take time for the little things like any other couple.”
As I look back on this week, with the loss of Marvel creator Stan Lee, I look to these characters and what they have meant to my life. I can't say enough about how I have connected with this fandom and its vast universe of wonderful stories. All the lessons I have learned and the lives I have seen that in so many ways have mirrored the pain and isolation I have felt in different parts of my past and present. Marvel has been a way for so many people to find strength to move on from the hurts in their lives and onto something greater. We have read or watched characters who haven't always been 'good' or 'bad' find a way to be Better. Seen how friends, honor, integrity and kindness can shape the world and improve it. For that I can not say Thank you enough to all of the artists and creators who brought these tales to life. Mr. Lee, the fans will never forget you.
Barnes didn't want him to lose that part of himself, and right now...right now there wasn't even a shadow of the man that James knew.
“He’s right Buck.” Steve said, quietly placing a hand on his friends back. “We trust Bruce and anything that happens here in the tower will stay here. Loki won’t have to go to shield or see anyone he doesn’t know. “
Bruce reflected on how advanced Thor claimed his people to be and yet it seemed even the most advanced civilizations were still victims to prejudice. When Jemma inquired on if there wasn't one of Loki's kind that might be able to shed some light on the complex subject – Thor hesitated and mentioned an old jotun priestess who originally helped Loki.
“Stark...”The man growled and leveled a glare. “ I've heard you have Loki in the tower and he'll be receiving medical attention. I want an approved SHIELD personal in the room. We need to know what that maniac is capable of for the next time he tries that world domination shtick.”
Pepper slipped away with an offer to listen when Steve was ready.  Her gentle voice whispering a goodnight before disappearing into the elevator.
“Whatever man just take the cash, fuck take the bitch! Please!”
"Damn it Tony!"  The good doctor shouted, "Jarvis who can see this!"
Loki sincerely wished he could still muster up the fortitude to hide behind snide remarks but he couldn't. All that time he spent carefully packing away his guilt and anger had only crippled him in the long run.
Tony kept watching though, it seemed the tower stereo system still worked judging by the woman’s voice crooning some spooky voodoo Esq. hymn. He watched the raven draped in a robe step onto a stone pavilion in the forests center. A gathering of green energy began at his feet and circled its wielder. That’s when the robe dropped.
The merchant’s hall was a noisy place filled with old men who drank far too much ale and boasted of deeds far grander in their own minds than reality itself. Steve was directed to a back room of the hall, lead down a narrow walkway where the sound from the main parlor was muffled into silence the farther he walked, and to a meeting room.
“Always the Diva, good thing that’s exactly what I’m looking for. Center stage performance at a Hydra base in Serbia.”
He’d seen him after one of Eir’s treatments and maybe that’s when he knew, or perhaps when he realized there was someone who wanted to be cared for. Someone too proud to ask for it, someone who needed but would never ask.  He gave Bucky back his purpose.
The crew cheered enthusiastically when they saw Steve bobbing on the surface. That was until the Captain and his cargo was surrounded by glowing light.
Yet here he was, standing tall and looking 10 years younger and stronger than ever.
These thoughts and feelings were even more clear the farther the group delved into the documents from the golden realm. Finally, after sifting through what was little more than old wives tales and hearsay, Bruce happened upon what appeared to be a scholarly journal on the frost giants. The official style of the text was much more fact based observation than emotional opinions on what should be done about 'beasts'. Included among the writings was an especially interesting section on the social habits of the Jotun.
"I have made several shows of gifts with, less that positive results. I felt perhaps a mortal woman such as yourself may have a better insight." His morning gift of a beautiful white stallion had been accepted but as the Tower had no stables the animal had to be sent to the avengers training facility upstate. Though...she had accepted it.  "I have made some progress, however i had hoped to speed along the process."
“Loki...I know in shiny god land you all lay around on silk pillows and eat grapes, but here on earth we like meat and processed sugar. So yes I am going to eat this. I am going to eat the hell out of this and enjoy every moment of it.” Tony said placing the bacon and cheese covered beef patties between two frosted doughnuts.
Steve had to stop, eyes trickling tears as he looked up in the cold blue sky. A shaky exhale leaving his lips, "oh..why..why." He sniffled and looked back at the monument. "I am so sorry, I want you to know that never picked Bucky over you. That wasn't about that, I know I told you that but i was always so afraid that you didn't believe me. I loved you..no.. I do love you, I will always love you."
“Be sure you finish before you kick the bucket.”
He wished he hadn't cause Loki and those damn leather pants, some things never change. If anything they got worse because now the kid wore them low rise with a fishnet shirt and were those...nipple rings? Who let that happen!
Despite how Loki felt about Odin taking him in and the secret surrounding his origins he's sure he would never do that. Perhaps there was a child as Kurt has said...just waiting.
The next date was announced when Steve opened his gym locker and found a single yellow rose with red tipped petals. The flower had a bow tied hallway down the thorn-less stem where two movie tickets nestled.
Stark shakes his head and chuckles humorlessly. “That's just it, I'm pretty sure I have all new organs. Don't ask me how I know that other than the mess I left on that warehouse floor. As for the reactor...” He pauses and taps at his chest. “It seems to like it, smoothed out the scars...not sure about inside. I'm ...I'm not sure about anything right now.” His hands shake as they did those first few months after New York.
"It..It's adequate."
“I don’t know how I’m gonna get through this Steve. I’m suppose to have all the answer but I don’t not for this.”
James turned away from the tender moment, his head ringing with the last argument he'd had with his own omega.  So many words he wanted to take back right now, because in his heart of hearts when James closed his eyes he couldn't help but see curious green eyes and sly smiles. His heart could paint the picture from memory and guide his unskilled hands even if he should go blind.
The memory sent a shiver through the solider.  Tony reached out and steadied him, it was a good sign. The brunette could always tell when he was thinking about the ice.
Clint….and your not Lara…fuck my life and fuck you stark phone ..
There was no holding in this pain, he felt like he couldn't breathe. "No I...Why..How did it happen?"
Tony didn’t reply to the AI, in his mind they were all against him now. He was just trying to do something right, to do what he needed to. Why couldn’t they see that?
“I was letting you have a head start like the gentleman I am Bucky-boo.”
The box of baked goods in the passenger seat and the false smile would get her through the door. “I know how much James loved Steve's cookies. Ya know with Tony being away the big guy kind over goes overboard. We're up to our eyes in snicker doodles.”
"Do you think papa will like it?" Peter asked craning his head back against his father's chest.
“I can set that up with Jarvis, normal procedure would say in a month but if you feel a change of any kind feel free to contact me. Again it’s been wonderful meeting you and best of luck” She offered a hand that Steve shook with a smile and equal thanks of his own.
Peter didn't go to the tower; he didn't want to talk to his dad in the workshop near any explosive materials. He knew his Pop would be at the mansion, their home away from the city, Steve liked to go there to think and paint when he wasn't on call for a mission.
Clint Barton is a strange creature.
Suddenly, Steve was reminded why he hated hospitals, being shot had been a walk in the park compared to this. Then he had to write down everything he remembered about his medical history. that took eleven pages, and by the end when Tony read it over, the alpha looked white as a sheet and asked him why he ever left the house.
As loathes as he was to admit it perhaps that had its merit. "Fine, go on then go and play with your chemicals and compounds. Try not to melt off anything i may require use of."  Loki shooed the man off with a small kiss and settled in for the task at hand.
Coming home to find Bruce and Pepper working on a baby book in bed was adorable. Who knew Bruce Banner's hobbies also included scrap booking. 'It's calming' was the excuse, not that they asked for one.
The other Alpha cut him off with a glance, “She’s pregnant not dying and I’m well aware.”
Maria believed in things like that, fairies, angles, and all the good stories that mothers tell their children. She painted wild flowers on the walls and intricate butterflies. Howard can still remember that day coming up from the workshop.
“Oh god. Don’t take snack tips from Barton. You see how he turned out. That’s what happens when you’re raised on Carney food and gas station burritos.”
“What are you doing to my heir..”
The bathroom door opened and Tony was faced with his omega now griping the sink hard enough that the marble had cracked across the vanity. Steve’s face was twisted up and his shoulders hunched over as he took several harsh breaths.
The brunnette smirked and tugged their bodies closer. “It says I've finally corrupted you after all these years. Somewhere a poster of Uncle Sam is weeping.” he said nipping playfully at the blondes ear.
Stark managed to maneuver both of them under the duvet and himself on top of the soldier, giving into the urge to return Steve's earlier scenting. Yes, omegas did purr and Steve sounded wonderful when he did.
Beck had been arrested a week later fleeing from a burglary a few blocks over. While they could not pin him for the shooting it self he claimed he might ‘know a guy who was bragging about it.’ That turned out to be false and Beck had since skipped town.
Between Loki’s physical and mental state, Bruce was at a loss. He or someone, needed to examine the omega properly if they had any hope to get ahead of the mans suffering.
Maybe they were cutting their losses and just bombing the place. Maybe he was going to be buried here under the ruble -left to die. It felt like such an unfair end. At least he knew he would die with his honor, he did not give them anything to use against the people he cared about. At least Tony was somewhere safe. The only thing Steve regretted…was that he wasn’t able to do right by Tony. These last few years they had been together, fought both beside and against each other at times. Tony meant something to him, something so special that the soldier could scarcely breath when he thought about it.
Bruce gestured to the pan as Steve looked down at the mess as well. “The meat, I think it's ready to add to the pasta now, unless you are making a puree of some kind. Are you okay?”
Then…she realized what she had to do, she needed a new plan and perhaps this little trinket could help her. If she could but siphon off a fraction of this energy, this pure power… Maybe she could do something with it.
Tony chuckled and kisses his jaw, “Yeah you were. Seriously though sugar buns, we'll wait and see and if not then there's next time. No pressure you know that right? These things can take time, even with superior genetics in play.”
Mighty big of them.
You had me from "Bacon"
“We've got him Yashka. Don't worry.” The red haired alpha spoke kindly, grounding him as he followed Bruce to the guest floor. “You did the right thing.” She assured. But somehow, James wasn't sure, part of him just felt like a failure.
Coulson looked over at the pair, noting the way the former mad prince was draping himself close to Hydras former Asset, clearly the choice to send Barnes to Asgard for treatment had some… unforeseen consequences. “So you two…”
The bag crunched in the soldier’s hands, “All that’s left are cheap chips and me! Soon you’re not even going to want me around; I’m a lab rat Stark, a fat lab rat eating pickle chips on the toilet!”  Big crocodile tears slid down the blonds red face, it was one of those horrible ugly cries too, equipped with wobbling chin and stuffy nose. This just went from bad to horrible in record time.
He knew coming back that people might not understand, he just hoped Steve did. That if one person understood; it would be his best friend.
Watching as his omega slid soundlessly back into bed, turning to face the wall. That was a little different, Loki usually was a back sleeper or more often a *this whole bed is my kingdom and your body only resides here at my pleasure. NOW warm my icy feet or become my pillow...the choice is yours* sleeper. Not that he had any problems with that, he loved waking up with arms full of soft sleepy sorcerer.
“Phil, I think you need to see this.” Melinda Mays voice hummed over the com lines.
Peggy snorted watching Stane leave. “Creeping like a snake in a hen house. God I hate that man.”
Stark rolled his eyes, “About if I’m staying with him through the heat? He is a grown man Bruce, older than both of us are if you wanna get technical. Therefore, I think he can handle how far he wants this to go, if he wants me to go I’ll go. If he wants me to stay I’ll stay.”
“Sorry? You’re sorry?” The inventor’s voice came distorted through the speakers; it pitched low and metallic like a demon. “Her husband had to bury her, her kid will never know her and you’re sorry?”
Barnes wasn’t typically a worrier, though something about becoming a father had given him a healthy addition of caution. So far, the first few months had been easy for his omega, not much had changed in Loki’s habits - save for lessening in his use of siedr for common activities. There had been no sign of illness of fatigue in his alien lover up to then.  “Ok, go back to sleep baby doll.”
That single action flared something in Tony.
Jemma shook her head, “No, my mate Leo … he is very sweet but the last few years have been Difficult, shortly before we bonded he was injured during a mission. He is getting better though, maybe in a year or two we may talk about it.”
Fury's leather coat flutters as he stands from the table, James briefly wonders if that damn thing was tailored just to do that or if their some floor vents that Nick has on a remote to provide maximum badassery at any given moment. “We pull back for now and monitor them from CCTV and satellite. Mallen's paranoid so we don’t want him to feel the heat. Once he's comfortable he'll no doubt make his move and we'll be ready to intercept the package.”
So he played the good son, if a bit difficult at times, he carried on as if everything was fine. That's what you do when it's all about appearances. Unfortunately, nothing can be beautiful and clean forever, eventually the cracks start to show. His carefully crafted walls could only take so much abuse, after years of feeling less than - he broke.
Maybe it was a touch too pessimistic a view, he would not argue that. However, when you find that the things you have always wanted are consistently dangled just out of reach – you tend to gain a less than Pollyannaish perspective on the world around you. You become accustom to disappointment and maybe that was Loki's greatest strength, he knew not to hope for too much. Having gleaned so early that he never was quite as deserving.
Tony knew what that meant; Steve’s file had said the Shield Psychologist had diagnosed the old soldier with PTSD and Depression. It was understandable given Steve’s background; even so, the captain never really sought help.
“Don't start with me I'm not calling you that.”
“Thank you Loki, now run along.” She said instead patting his cheek playfully. “I have work to do and of course I will have to show off this beautiful treasure you have given me. I’m sure all of my friends will be positively beside themselves with jealously.”
There wasn’t much talking after that, Steve found himself bent over the foot of the bed and Buckys metal fingers probing him from behind. He knew what they would find, another part of their play was Steve getting himself ready. Making sure he was slick and open for his lover.
There had been other firsts in those days.
“I know..” Her voice strained and it broke him into a thousand pieces. “I saw the news...their calling you a traitor.”
For good or bad, this wasn't like the Loki Coulson had seen before.
“What!” Tony flushed and looked away. “I’m sexy; adorable is for small fluffy animals and children.”
“Sit down! Sit Down! How can I do that Tony!” Steve’s eyes flashed and his jaw clicked, “Schmitt was dead! I saw it! I saw the fucking cube zap him into nothing! Now he’s back and he had Bucky!”
It was the one good memory that Tony had, one of only a few.
Thankfully, when they did reach the tower the garage wasn't empty. The worst thing in the world would have been to come all this way to find everyone had gone out to dinner or that Stark had packed everyone up to head to the coast for a weekend. Tony had been known to do things like that in the past after a hard fight.
While Tony's health, both physical and mental seems to be stable for now. Thanks to Steve and Tony's renewed bond there were still so many variables that they didn't understand.
"I don't think it's misguided." Bruce started as he took a few tentative steps closer. "I think he merely wants to be sure you'll be okay. And...well, none of us want you to suffer..."
The door to the penthouse opens and Steve feels guilty for wanting to get up and leave. This is his Alpha, his love, his husband and yet...he doesn't feel Tony at all. It's as if all they have built is broken. Like this man, walking down the hall with such familiar footsteps is someone all together different.
“Oh god.” Bruce couldn’t take it anymore, so with the maturity level fallen to 0. Banner had to have a special talk with Thor, Loki and Steve.
“Can you give us a second?” Tony interrupted.
“So Tasha pulled my baby Hb, that’s nostalgic of you. “ Stark commented as he fired rockets, Heartbreaker was armor specialized for intensive firefights.  From top to bottom, 17 had been designed to withstand firepower and mass amounts of damage. Not to mention the over-sized repulsor output in the armors chest.
The driver side door cracked open then the back door. Steve came around the car with the carrier in one hand, walking fast through the fallen leaves. It was like a blur when strong arms wrapped around his back.
Around six hours; the sun were shining in the penthouse and they had visitors.  Pepper had come by to make a light breakfast and see how they were doing, around noon Phil and Clint came up with lunch. Now it seemed like everyone was there.
“No Sir.”
Logic worked even with little Steve, he nodded and toddled over to where Tony was laying a changing pad on the bed. Reluctantly dropping his robe and laying down.
The soldier woke up at his usual time, leaving the welcoming warmth and comfort of his bed to dress for the day. He looked over his shoulder as Tony snatched up his now vacant pillow and crushed his face into the fabric. It was oddly cute to watch the unconscious alpha fidget and breathe in deeply the scent he left on the pillow before settling back into a deep sleep. It was one of those little things that made Steve feel truly wanted.
Stark let out a harsh laugh, “no, see you used to be there Pep. I loved you remember - but it wasn’t enough. It was enough for Steve; it was always enough for him. He was the one that was there when things went to shit after you left, he was the one that picked me up off the floor - literally and forced me to get my shit together. I’m not saying this is your fault, hell you are one of the few blameless people in this. What I am saying is don’t you dare presume to know me like you used to.” Tony turned away moving his hands over the suit specs, “ I don’t even know myself anymore, so just do me this one favor and keep my boy safe, even if its from me.”
Sitting alone in the living area of the guest floor, he couldn't help but think about his mother, about Steve, Pepper. The thought of Pepper in such a state unsettled him the most. Even if he wasn't the most perceptive of people he wanted to believe that he would notice if someone he loved was struggling like that right before his eyes. Then again...isn't that the nature of things like this? Hind sight is 20/20 and it's all those little things we dismiss.
Steve… no the …not-Steve, cringed. “You’re not crazy, You were lied to. I was lied to.”
The sea rumbled and the sky darkened above the once still glassy surface began to churn with unrest. Amora cackled and screamed as her former pallid flesh began to tint and change. Gone was her smooth milk skin as ever inch inked darker than the depths below. Her scales changing from their glorious hues of crimson and emerald to a muddled mix of black and brown. The Mers slender body lengthened and expanded, her muscle bulging grotesquely as they reformed with new mass and shape. All the while more magic surrounded her; flowing from the sky above and the sea floor below.
The texts described the race as '
Loki wanted to feel more like the rest of the Midgardian so Darcy suggested that in order to fit in he learn a bit more about the culture of earth. In her opinion the best way to do that was ‘friggin tunes, if you have a soul you will like music, though the jury is out if you do.. have a soul.”
Left alone with his thoughts, Steve knew this wouldn’t be over until all the cards had been played. He had heard the heavy locks on the door fall into place when Fury left. Nick was not a stupid man; he wouldn’t go to the trouble of locking doors that Steve could simply yank of the hinges.
Tony thought it over as the elevator let him out in the penthouse, tugging off his stained tank top. “Yeah those sound good, oh and send him a message that I want to see him later but make it sound like a good thing. Oh and…buy Pep some shoes, something expensive and send her a thank you note.”
“Get me Coulson, time to bring in the team for welcome wagon day.”
He knew what it was the second he hit the door, a cloying scent turning sour. Loki's heat was early. “Doll, I'm here ok…I'm here.”
Witnessing Captain America throw up in house plant was less than inspiring or patriotic.
Stepping out of the shower the solider heard the soft playing of the piano in the foyer. Curiosity piqued he pulled on a pair of shorts and headed down the hallway. The nursery was empty, not that he thought Tony would ever leave peter alone. This though…he hadn’t expected.
“Yeah me. Oh and Steve helps too and all the rest of our action packed squad. Remember?” Tony said as the armor faded from view once again. “If Barnes and his Bae want to share info they will, until then you an the MIB there can kindly go fly a kite. K?”
Steve had thought about it, a lot recently if he was being honest with himself. “ Yeah, and… I think I’m ready to tell people. When the kids were young I didn’t realize how much it hurt to have people look at us and think it was strange that two Alpha’s were raising pups. I guess I put it out of my mind because we had other things going on. Peter is getting older and I don’t want him to be ashamed about being an omega.”
Green eyes glanced up softening even if only slightly. "Plotting world domination and demise of my enemies. And no, i should say not. Some rather unflattering things have been said by your midgardian reporters seemed to find it sporting to insult my leathers.  MY LEATHERS, which by the way, were hand crafted by the finest makers in all the nine realms and are not in anyway reminiscent of your.....FETISH catalogs!!"
Logically, one would think so. To simply avoid this struggle from the start. Somehow forgo the tribulations that this road has shown him. Yet, there is another part. The part that was a curious child with his nose in biology books. The part that remembers the people and place he's met along the way.
“Kroyak, ring any bells Nick?” Stark turned, his face look gaunt in the over head lights. Shadows falling in the hallow of his cheeks and the shade of his brow.
What if they were both already gone?
The idea of that made me feel sick all over again, as if by instinct I press my palm against the still flat expanse of my stomach. I needed to think about this. It’s not just me anymore, like it or not there’s someone else or an almost someone… Almost? No that sounds odd. That’s like saying I’m just a little pregnant. Pretty sure this is one of those all or nothing kinda things.
Too late.
“You don’t have to forgive her my darling.” Frigga said as she wrapped her arms around the man who was once a child in her arms, and the child that was now in his. “Look into his eyes, they are not hers because they are not cold, they grow warmer each day that he lives, each day he smiles at you.”
High polished black jackboots clicked over the concrete floor. The sound followed by a steadier paced modern combat boot. The pair stopped before a mass of soldiers, faces obscured by masks.
So when Jarvis pinged him with the announcement of ‘unusual energy levels on Mr. Laufeyson’s floor.’ Stark jumped at the chance.
If this was the cost of their lives, had he been right to let Tony pay that price?
Pepper it headed for the door and she doesn't really even look sad about it, angry yes annoyed absolutely, but not sad.
Loki frowned, “You've spent too much time with Thor haven't you?”
Inspired by I'm already there by Westlife
Today’s exam was over, there had been a routine weigh in and measurements with a blood draw. Simmons and Bruce were keeping a close eye to be sure that Steve’s nutritional needs were being met -despite the soldier’s high metabolism. It seemed the prenatal shakes were doing the trick, though Simmons mused that they may want to tweak the formula soon as Steve entered the later portion of pregnancy.
“Tell me what you want sweetheart.” Barnes fondled his lover through the lace with his metal hand watching the goose flesh prickle over Steve’s skin. “Tell me or you won’t get it.”
Loki looked away to hide the sudden shine in his eyes. “This is why I wed you James Barnes.”
“Steve! No, no you don’t do this not now. Come on!”
"Ow." Steve grumbled slightly through a moan from the pinch, glancing back at Tony. "Sorry, I'm not used to this. It took me by surprise..."
"You're such a dweeb," Tony grumbled, a grin on his lips, "Alright, alright. You can expose me to more romance-y things. But any comments over how shy I get, and I'll go abstinate for a week."
Steve looked around with a slightly lost expression on his face, nothing clicking yet.
He smooched Peter's forehead, tightly hugging the boy.
"Just better, sweets. Not betterer," Tony corrected gently, straightening out Peter's sweater, "Y'look good, kid. Let's go find Papa, okay?"
Tony laughed and let up a little, giving Steve a teary smile.
"Sorry. Firefly starts at seven. I watch it with Bruce, Its sort of a 'roommate bonding' type thing. I'll see you tomorrow?".
"Let’s head up to the studio then. And brainstorm." He hummed, leading them upstairs.
He ignored the familiar throb in his temple, successfully pushing the urge away.
"Make me," Tony growled, a tiny smirk on his lips.
"Please, baby, I can take it, please," he moaned, "Don't need much prep--"
"I can kiss my husband as much as I want, Pep," Tony hummed back, stealing another kiss from Steve, "It's Christmas Eve, after all. Time for merry making, and all that jazz."
"There, right there--
"Maybe it's because I've had my sexcapades, but I really can't see how it’s awkward," Tony murmured, gently kissing Steve back, "I'm glad you're starting to get out of that shell, though."
"Sore, but no bleeding," he murmured, bringing Steve's clothes over to him.
"So-- so how do we do this?" He asked, sitting cross-legged on the bed.
The blond's sleep was a bit fitful during the night, various nightmares trying to rack his brain throughout. He managed to make it through without incident, waking up slowly with Tony still in his arms and Peter still in his.
"It’s alright. You're learning. Just know not to talk while you're chewing food." Steve confirmed. "Don't want to have manners like Uncle Clint."
"Yes, Sir--" he said back playfully.
"He's....." Natasha sighed, opening the door more to let them in, "Does he like to paint to draw attention to himself?"
He slid down onto the couch next to Steve, drawing his legs up while he waited for everyone to get settled.
"I'll let you touch my tail if I can see your light." He offered, crossing his arms seriously.
The room fell silent, Tony able to feel the burn of Howard's glare.
"Oh, fuck, Steve," Tony moaned, sighing happily as Steve worked, "That feels amazing, you have
He took a careful breath, grabbing a pillow so he could lay down on Steve's lap.
Peter gasped and climbed off Tony, laying on Steve's chest on the floor.
Peter sighed softly, leaning back in his seat.
"You should. Lists are good things to have with you for stuff." He murmured, eyes locking with Tony's as the finger traced his lips. He took Tony's hand instead, kissing lightly along the man's knuckles.
"Here, Pete, lemme give him back to Ms. Sharon, he's probably hungry," Tony murmured, letting Steve pick the baby up so Peter could get down.
Steve grinned up at Tony almost bashfully, pushing feeling through the bond. He brushed his nose lovingly against Tony's inner thigh, humming in affection.
"I'm gonna go check on Pete," he murmured, standing and kissing Steve's knuckles, "I'll be back."
Bruce looked back at Tony as he hung up the phone.
"You miss it, Rogers. You miss it and leave myself and several important neighboring tribe officals to sit here without so much as a clue when you are going to show up." Fury said cooly, his obsidian tail however twitching in clear irritation. "I know you're young and need your own time now and again, but you have never been one to bail on something important business-wise."
dork I know," Tony laughed, letting himself fall onto the bed so Steve could crawl over him, "I mean, if you don't want me to stay, I can most certainly leave--"
Steve nodded, getting up from the bed.
Steve hurried after Tony when he ran off, sympathy running through his chest as he heard Tony. He ran a hand along Tony's back carefully. "I gotcha, babe. It's alright."
He put on some cologne of his own and messed with his slight bangs a bit in the mirror, until he felt they were just right. Steve slipped on his sneakers, grabbed his wallet, phone, and keys in case they took the motorcycle, and headed back over to Tony's.
Steve rubbed at Tony's back softly, kissing at his temple.
"Mornin', sunshine."
, Steve, I can't exactly--oh
Tony snuggled under his sheets, sighing at the warmth. "I know, I know, but when I get a train of thought I gotta go with it," he grumbled, immediately sucking up to Steve's warmth.
He leaning up to lick and bite at Steve's soulmate tattoo, trailing his tongue down to the blond's nipple. Steve let out a small groan as Tony worked at his chest, moving a hand up to rake through his husband's hair.
"Shhh," Tony soothed, putting his hand over Steve's, "It's okay, sweetie. It's alright. No use worrying about it now."
"I know, Munchkin. It’s almost done." Steve assured, making the boy's bowl. "I wish we could have stayed, too. But we'll get him tomorrow and we'll have him with us for good."
"Hi, peaches, you done sleepin'?" He cooed at Sammy, picking the baby up, "Miss yer Papa?"
"Me, I'm so old," Tony wheezed, laughing, "You might have to carry me back if my knees give out." He took Steve's hand, leaning into his warmth as they trotted down the sidewalk.
"Rather. Women are much stronger than men when it comes to things like that." The blond clarified. "It takes a
"Alw'ys good f'you," he slurred, still coming down from his high, "Good f'you sir--"
He smiled and kissed Steve's cheek, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. "You okay?"
"Ba," Sammy babbled, making spit bubbles at Steve.
"Sammy hurt his nose I guess." Steve said worriedly. "He was sitting up by himself and so happy, but he raised his hands and fell down on me."
"I don't know, am I?" Tony could only grin smugly as he opened the top drawer desk, pulling out his glasses and slipping them on, giving Steve a look.
"Nuh uh," Peter chimed in.
"Meanies!" He yelled, wiping the spit off his face, "M'all sticky--"
Tony snorted at that, sitting up to crack his back.
Steve headed towards the bed, getting in this time to curl up around Tony instead of Peter. He wrapped arms around his husband's waist, leaving light, tender kisses along the back of his neck. He whispered small praises he felt about Tony each and every day, continuing until he managed to drift to sleep.
"Come with me, cutie. We are going ta' up your game!"
"When he is being sweet, sure. But not when he acts up and throws a tantrums." Steve pointed out. "Honestly not sure where that part comes from. The smart mouth is aaaall you though."
"'kay, babe." The blond hummed, lifting Tony's face to peck his lips.
"--prescription for four epipens," He continued, "I'll also send a memo to Peter's regular physician, so he or she will be able to regularly prescribe it in case it arises again."
"He'll be crawling and sitting up in no time," he grinned, wiggling his fingers at Sammy.
Natasha stared between the three men's standoff, standing up to give Tony a water bottle.
"Did Papa give you
Steve cleared his throat nervously, looking at the two of them. "I'm gonna go change and then we can head out, Petey, okay?" He said quickly, heading out of the room to go change.
"What're you painting there, Petey?" Steve asked with a smile, looking at the paper curiously.
Steve next woke up to being squashed repeatedly by his husband who was in turn being squashed by a six year old.
"You have a deal, Johann."
"Jealous, kiddo?" He teased, smooching Pete's cheek, "How was the aquarium? I see you've got a new little fella, there."
He kissed at Tony's hipbone, starting to nibble lightly at the underwear a bit.
"Mmm, 'kay," Peter mumbled, sticking his thumb in his mouth. He was asleep in seconds, quietly snoring against Steve's chest.
"He likes chewin' on ya, Papa," he smirked, "Y'tastes good."
"...mmnh...?"
Tony took a quick breath before pulling the box out of his pocket, setting it on his chest over the scars across his breastbone. Steve's heart skipped a beat for a moment, eyes fixated on the little, black box on Tony's chest then glancing at brown eyes.
have the weird fetishes, Mr. Crosswords."
Tony pulled back to kiss in the center of Steve's chest, looking up with a raised eyebrow.
"Gra'ma was a nurse?" Peter spoke around his toothbrush, looking at Steve through the mirror, "Can she take care'a Daddy?"
"Steve, you-- how did you find this?" He said, pulling out an old Teddy bear.
The boy nodded, and Tony turned to Steve, nodding his head toward the door.
Tony nodded and sniffled, slowly sitting up as not to get dizzy. He leaned on Steve and sucked up his warmth while trudging up to the kitchen, stomach rolling at the thought of food.
"Mmhm. Shush. Sleep," Tony chuckled, "You'll feel better when you wake up, okay? I'm right over there if you need me."
He whined up at Steve, nuzzling into his crotch from his sitting position.
"M'ma, I want Maria," Tony whispered, barely able to speak, "I want my m'ma b-back--"
"Traitor!" Peter yelled, squealing even louder at Tony.
"We are definitely getting you a teething ring very soon." He chuckled lightly.
"Hey," he whispered, grabbing Steve's collar and tugging him into the bedroom, "We need to put Pete's gifts out, then we're done."
"You look just like your Papa, Samwich," Tony chuckled, watching the baby chew on his fist.
"I think he's good for you, but you really need to hold onto him," he continued, "He's a rocket, but-- god, you know all this, but if what the media says is true, he's way worse off than what he's shared with you."
Steve smiled fondly as Tony fell asleep, tucking them in under the blankets warmly. He kissed the top of Tony's head before closing his own eyes, comfortably falling asleep with his husband in his arms.
"Drink,
"I'll be alright."
"Are you sure you don't want me to push you, sweetheart?" He asked softly, watching the boy struggle to kick off, "I don't think your feetsies can reach the ground, bubba."
"Hey." Steve greeted softly, running his hands along Tony's stomach lightly. "You feel okay?"
"Don't worry about him, he's okay," Tony chuckled, turning his attention back to Steve, "And I'm talking to my robots. Great."
"Steeeeve," Tony whined, trailing after him anyway, "It's too
Steve nodded.
"Love that I can make you sound so great, Tony. Love making you feel good, baby." He preened, kissing carefully at Tony's face.
." Steve chuckled. "It’s a little weird, but it works out. Efficient, I suppose. We don't have to if you don't want to."
"Sure thing, bud. I'll let Daddy know." He answered with a smooch, walking over to the stairs. "Tony! Peter wants to pack his Batman pajamas!"
"All right. Your’s is done. And when you get done, we'll leave the light on for a little bit then see if it glows in the dark." He hummed happily.
"De advenchas of Cap'n 'Merica, Iwon Man, and Spidahman," He announced, opening the graphic novel, "Storwy an' art by Steeb Stark-Wogers."
While Tony worked in his workshop, Steve and the boys started to play in the living room on the floor. Sammy was crawling around like crazy, using Steve as an obstacle from time to time as the man laid on his back.
"Ooo. Then I could have me a sundae, couldn't I?" Steve purred, setting his hands along Tony's hips.  "I think that could wait, though. Don't want you to leave just yet. You just got here." He said playfully.
"Well, maybe it had something to do with that too.".
"Papa, why are your cheeks going pink?"
"Thank you, Peter," Tony chuckled, taking the boy up into his arms and grabbing his backpack.
"I'm sorry. I never meant that like that, hon." Steve answered when Tony came back. "I don't ever want you to feel like you are forced or pressured to have sex with me at specific times."
Steve looked over at Tony, moving a little nervously.
“Tattoo Parlor? I want in," Tony grinned, sitting down with Sammy in his lap, "I want a beaker on my shoulder."
"I wouldn't suppose you would have. I don't exactly show myself around." Steve panted, lips slightly red from the kiss. "And you never touched before either to know."
"No more making yourself bleed," he ordered, "No. Never. Never ever or--or I'm putting the toys away for a week."
"He's Mr. Big and Bad Dean Stark.".
Post-engagement, Red Light, and a surprising revelation about Bucky Barnes.
TW: None
Bucky gave a faint smile at Tony's reassurance, silently thanking him.
"You are so over the moon with him, Tony. You love 'em, I know you do." He smiled sweetly. "He's got you hooked.”
"You aren't allowed to depreciate yourself, either." Steve said with a soft smile as he observed the finished frame. "Time to get the mattresses on now? Is it sturdy enough?"
"Your turn, Tony."
"I'm glad y'here," he whispered weakly, closing his eyes and curling into Steve's warmth. Tony sniffled again, trying to stop himself from crying too hard; Steve's shirt was wet enough, as it was.
Peter let Steve ruffle his hair dry, managing to get his undies and pajamas on by himself.
Tony seemed confused on why the concept was so hard to grasp.
"Yeah," Peter replied sleepily, almost falling asleep on Steve's chest.
Tony was standing in Steve's doorway, looking a lot like a little kid asking to sleep with his parents after having a nightmare. Then it hit Steve. Nightmares. Right...
He could feel Steve while their hips were pressed together, the blond's interest nearly hard beneath him and clearly present by touch. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but this wasn't something he had explained to Steve yet. This would be something new and confusing to the merman, and while it is flattering, the thought of having to explain this Steve and show him how to handle it made Tony nervous.
He rolled his eyes, puffing his smoke at Steve again. He paused mid-blow, mouth widening slightly before he stood and crossed the room, immediately leafing through a stack of books in the back left of his office. Steve smirked unashamedly, standing up and following Tony towards his office.
"Thank you," he mumbled, feeling Steve's come leak down his leg, "I feel better."
"Peter, please chew before you talk. You can end up choking. That, and its bad table manners."
He tugged his boxers off and tossed them aside, reaching down to palm Steve through his briefs.
'What?
"Uh huh," Peter giggled, hugging Tony's legs back before scooping up his backpack to dash off for the car.
"No! No, no. Steve you didn't do anything wrong, trust me! You are reacting beautifully to me, its wonderful." Tony assured, making a small test roll of his hips against Steve's and earning a pleasant moan from the other in return. "This. This guy is why I stopped. It's sort of something that leads to some more intimate stuff that I didn't want to rush you into, but uh..."
"Tony? You did say that more of this was okay, right?"
He took a deep breath and clenched his fists, anger and protectiveness thrumming through every nerve in his body.
"She's a good woman," Rhodey agreed, crossing his leg over the other.
?! Out of all the years we've lived together-- it's a sin, Steven, and a damn shame," Tony gasped in mock horror, scratching Steve's neck, "We're definitely having wine. I think I have a moscato somewhere we can have. Pretty light, fruity, for the early beginner drinkers."
"Doubt you would've recognized, anyway. It’s been ages since I've had a picture, let alone a recent one for Steve." She explained softly, finally picking up Peter carefully. "Steve was still a bit scrawny last time I had saw or even
Tony still had a pout on his face, but did offer the other a small nod.
Steve rolled his hips and thrusted in a careful rhythm, focusing on making sure Tony felt good. He bent over the man as he moved, kissing sweetly along the brunet's neck and spine, trailing down nice and slow.
He dug out bandaids and neosporin, quickly cleaning up the scrape and smoothing the band-aid over it. Tony dropped a kiss onto his knee, moving up to blow a raspberry on Sammy's tummy.
He watched Steve go up the steps, shutting off the movie and going around the clean the house a little before heading for their bedroom. Steve stopped in front of Peter's bedroom door, finding it locked. He knocked on the door gently, pressing his ear to the door.
"I think you're just saying that, Stevie boy," Tony hummed, still not pressing his finger in, "I think you like to misbehave, don't you?"
"So, what about you? What's the story of Tony Stark?".
"G'night again, Daddy." He said softly, waving gently as they went up the stairs.
"Alright, whenever you wanna go, then." Tony returned his attention to his tablet, typing away furiously at his code.
"You get so excited for the simplest things. I love it." Steve grinned, pulling out of the driveway and heading to the local ice cream shop. "I'm thinking about a cookie dough shake myself."
He smacked his fist on the table, glaring at the broken machinery in front of him, not aware of how loud he actually was.
"Toooony--" he called out in sing-song, slowly opening their bedroom door.
"...I can't believe I never noticed those. I'm sorry." Steve said sincerely, reaching to pet at Tony's hair. "You don't... You don't still do that, do you?"
"By the way, I just remembered; our Christmas gift from Bucky is an unlimited babysitting pass." He grinned. "Any time we want or need some 'extensive alone time', we can just call him up and send the kids over. Isn't that nice?"
"I don't mind if it scars," Tony replied quietly, effectively ending the conversation. He curled up more tightly on himself, picking at his nails.
Steve grinned. "Well, if you don't feel good, then it'll be with a lot of TLC." He chuckled, snuggling Tony back. "And cold medicine."
"Tony, that's not--" Steve sighed, running a hand through his hair. He turned the stove off so he didn't cause something bad to happen, going after Tony up the stairs.
"Okay!" Tony announced.
"Warm," Tony replied, voice slightly muffled, "That too."
"Mmm, you made me into a sap," Tony happily returned the kiss, reaching up the brush away the wetness at the corner of Steve's eyes, "But it's all worth it, y'know."
," Peter scolded, exasperated, "
He paused and bust out into giggles, eventually dissolving into raucous laughter.
He smiled warmly, nuzzling at Steve's cheek.
The sound of Tony's phone going off interrupted him; he reached over and got it off the nightstand.
"Speaking of?" Steve reiterated, grinning up at Tony. "What's on your mind there, Stark?"
"Well, of course." Steve laughed softly, starting to relax a bit. "Depending on the number of spare sheet sets, we are definitely going to have to do laundry often." He smirked, laying back in his seat. "Just hope we remembered everything."
Tony turned to look back at the stranger, but he seemed to be gone out of thin air. He looked at the bot again, and his tools, giving a sigh.
"Tony?" Steve said with a slight worry. "Tony, breathe honey." He tried to say in a soothing tone.
"I'm sorry!" Steve tried not to laugh, "He's very charming and persuasive... I love him and he loves me back. And you don't let me see him after school."
"No, really. Take control. Power me, Steve." Tony switched their positions, needy as he grabbed at the blond, "Please, please--"
"Such a mess, you are." The blond grinned, going to throw the trash away.
"I love you too, sweetheart." Steve hummed, handing him a glass of orange juice. He kissed Tony sweetly, reaching up and stroking his face gently before going to start dinner up again to finish.
"Fine, fine," Tony sighed, ruffling his hair, "No junk food, though."
Once Tony was satisfied with the lineup, he went back to Steve.
"He is very focused on his job." Steve chuckled, admiring Peter's work. "Looks good, Pete. Might come back for a sleeve."
"Hold on, baby," Tony replied, finishing his signature before standing and going to Steve's bedside, "Morning, sickly. Er, night. Morning. It's almost midnight."
"Fuck," Tony grunted, digging his nails into Steve's back, "Gonna make me come from sayin' stuff like that, babe." He moaned softly, taking one hand off Steve's back to jerk himself off in tune with his thrusts.
"He's gonna be stubborn as all hell," Tony snorted, kissing Steve back, "I know you are, honey. I am too."
“I spat in your face. This isn’t exactly an attack.”
“According to whom? Oh yeah: You.”
“N-No. No. No, you’re- It’s just a rule. In the cl- In the environment, I lived in. I, uh… What are the rules
After he’d ensured Tony was fast asleep, he locked the door of their guest room and went back to the party. Mr. Hammer and his Omega had returned by now. The boy -
“We could buy you a book with some problems so you have something to do while I am gone.”
But he wouldn’t stand up anymore, he was way too far into his heat.
“Thank god.” he looked at her and then back at his stomach. “Can I dress again?”
“Mute.”
He frantically shook his head. “Heat inducers are- are illegal.”
“Wanna bet?” he asked. “Because I am pretty good at winning those.” With that, he activated the repulsor and aimed for Steve’s arm. It wasn’t anything deadly or remotely serious; merely a warning shot that would hurt like a bitch.
“I, uh, like solving problems.”
“Yes, I got that,” he said.
He remembered how angry Howard had been that his son didn’t speak a word of English. it was telling, however, that it had taken five years to figure out Tony talked french non-stop. it was beyond him how Howard could ignore his “Je peux avoir l’eau, s’il te plaît?” or the usual “Je n’veux pas aller au lit!”
The first morning
“Oh, I can tell you what the hell he has to say.”
Tony was scared he might be mad at him but as soon as Steve saw the pups every anger seemed to vanish.
“Breadwinner. I know. And I’ll make sure everything else is running smoothly. That sounds like a… that makes sense.”
Tony earns his first punishment.
Rhodey was taken aback for a second “Wait, really?”
At least he had had something to do, now that Steve treated every entry to the lab as a felony. The room looked neat, in the end and the nest as well, if he was honest. Not that he would ever use it, of course. But it was neat. And commanding people around was the only thing he could do with a belly as big as Texas.
When he saw Steve flinch he knew it had worked. “If you excuse me now; I am tired of your bullshit!”
“I’ve got you.” He realized it was Steve’s voice. He realized that bastard really took advantage of this shitty situation. But at the moment he didn’t have the strength to fight back, to tell him to leave. His biology didn’t care about the circumstances. In this very moment, Steve was a tool for it. A tool to achieve what it wanted, what it needed. He was not a colleague anymore, he was a partner, an-
“That’s how it generally works, yes. If we do have pups, I would appreciate you taking care of them or us taking terms. We can split the chores if you want to. I’ll just be at work sometimes and-”

Again, Steve was stunned and didn’t know how to reply properly. How could he reply to something like this, really? He wondered if Tony had ever spent time outside his household, if he had been lucky enough to receive schooling as an omega or if he had only left the house rarely, maybe to be paraded around, like a possession. Sadly, Steve was sure it was the latter. “Did you have a rulebook at home?”
"Is your boyfriend looking at your panties on school campus?" Tony shot back, eyebrow raised, "That's another rule you've broken, I imagine.
"I love you too, mi amoré," Tony murmured, reaching up to scratch Steve's scalp, "My soulmate." He got a dazed look on his face, a tiny smile on his lips. "Wow," he breathed, laughing weakly, "I still can't believe you're mine."
"Let's go meet Sharon," Tony smiled, going up on his tiptoes to give Steve a kiss.
"We can work on that tonight, if you want. Get it done and ready since Christmas is the day after tomorrow." He hummed quietly, kissing Tony's face gently. "He'll be happy with everything for sure."
"Wittle..." Peter murmured, making a small gesture with his hand. "Buh you 'n Papa dun use 'em. So I'll be 'kay...".
"Then, pray tell, if you know the lad was bludgeoned, why seek me out?" Stark asked, pouring himself a finger of whiskey.
"Holy shit," Clint whispered, grunting as Tony elbowed him.
Tony scoffed at the blonde in disbelief.
Tony nodded as he scanned the papers, eyes flicking over the familiar sheet.
"You willing to do this?"
"That 'lady' is my friend Peggy. We've been friends since middle school." Steve explained, slightly a jab at Tony for assuming. "And yes, I would love for you to meet her. She hasn't seen me in years and I would like her to meet my family."
"Yeah, yeah, m'fine," The boy grumbled, more embarrassed than anything else.
Peter gasped softly, hurriedly shoving his food in his mouth.
Peter grinned from behind Tony's arm, mischief dancing on his face.
Tony glanced up from his cookie-arranging at the tune, a tiny smirk coming to his lips.
Steve gave a small growl and started his movements, slow but deep.
that?
"Hey, little spider. How've you been?"
"Already brainstorming," Tony muttered under his breath, "I'm gonna grab blueprint paper and a coffee, love."
She laughed and brushed her blonde curls aside, a warm smile on her lips.
Tony flicked his eyes between the two of them, slightly lost.
Steve looked at the brunette questioningly.
"Well excuse
There was a faint murmur on the other end, to which Tony's eyes grew wide.
"Uh-huh. He's sleepin'," Peter whispered, "Can I go to bed now, Papa? Daddy gave me ano'der paper t'wead an' m'almost done it."
"Already texted her," Tony laughed into his cup, putting his phone on the table, "She's meeting us there in two hours and some."
The baby whined from his chair, tossing his empty bottle to the floor.
Tony beamed happily and gave Steve a quick kiss before sliding down into his seat, buckling happily.
"Is it okay if I pick them up tomorrow? I wanna get him home," Tony asked, gently taking Peter into his arms.
"Fuck," Tony muttered, pulling back from his work to bandage up some of the self (and tool) inflicted slits up and down his hands and arms.
"Of course you won't. We'll make sure you won't, sweetheart--" he purred, kissing at the back of Tony's neck as he tied off in a neat little ribbon.
Tony smiled fondly and took his own lunch out of the basket, not surprised to see one of the sandwiches marked with his name.
"Fine. If you wanna feed me, I want lots of bread. White bread. Toasted. With butter. Sick toast," he muttered, sighing at the knock on the door, "I'll get it."
"Please, call me Sharon." She said warmly. "I suspect we'll be getting to know each other quite a bit, so best to be on a first name basis."
"Good. I'm already planning things, so after Christmas, Clint and I'll go bear the crowds and get some stuff. Do you prefer champagne or white wine?"
"Returning? I never knew it left." Steve teased, crinkling his nose playfully.
“Never said I was happy about it. Just happens to be the only option for now.” Steve admitted, huffing out a soft breath in response. “Best thing to do is try and deal with it as calmly as we can. Stressing about it isn’t going to help, y’know.”
He then wrapped an arm around Tony's waist and pulled him to his side protectively. "And this is my husband and soulmate. Peggy, this is Tony. Tony, Peggy."
"You're welcome, but don't talk with your mouth full, baby bear." Steve murmured, setting his and Tony's bowl on the table as well. "Just think. Eventually we will have four eating at the table."
Tony put the finished papers back, grinning over at Steve. "I'm kidding, sickly," he laughed, getting up to go back over to the bed, "About the mean part."
Steve just smiled back warmly at the name calling. "What can I say? I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic." He chuckled, turning slightly once their food and drinks arrived. "Dig in." He grinned, setting a few slices and breadsticks on his plate.
"Love you too." Steve said back tiredly, kissing the nape of Tony neck lazily. "I meant all that I said early, by the way. Every word."
"Tony... What is all of this? Why-- how did--?" The blond was so surprised and a bit lost that he couldn't get out a straightforward thought in the process.
"Yeah, yeah--"
Tony snuck back into his room of the house, packing up a case full of tools, schematic paper, and different odds and ends to take with him and work with. He also put in a couple changes of clothes, just in case they managed to let him stay. It'd would be better with Blondie than here with--
. By that time, I'd met Clint, and he saw the scars all over me. I used to have purple hips from how bruised they were. When I turned eleven, Clint and I made a plan to escape, and I'd live with him till I could go to college."
"Not at all, hon. You're not that much of a handful at all." The blond hummed, smooching Tony's lips once more. "Get some rest. That's what vacations are for, right?"
Tony squeezed Steve's hand, leaning over to kiss his cheek.
Sharon laughed and nodded, careful to tip the bottle back so Sammy wouldn't take too much at once.
Tony waited to hear the door close before launching into his sexy-as-hell routine; he dried himself off, including his hair, before slipping on lacy panties he'd promised Steve he'd wear. Tony frowned at his closet before tugging on those black skinny jeans Bruce said make him look like a heathen, followed by a red muscle shirt and a tiny gold necklace. He hummed appreciatively at his dress before starting the agonizingly long process or drying and gelling his hair to make it look like sex-bed-hair rather than plain homelessness.
Tony pulled out of Steve and kissed his spine, moving to grab another condom and roll it onto Steve after removing the cock ring. He took his time to treasure how red and swollen Steve's cock was, then reached to fondle his balls.
"No, no, it's wonderful," Tony breathed, preening under Steve's touch, "Best birthday gift. Ever. Ever-ever. Can you believe we've only been together for seven months? I can't. It feels like a day's gone by since you brought over my mail."
"Peter? Petey, can I come in, munchkin?" He asked softly behind the door.
Almost on command, Steve lasted only a few pumps before he came. He tried to control his volume, but his moan as he hit his high came out louder than he planned it to.
Steve decided that pizza was the best thing he had ever tasted that night.
Tony kept his legs apart while he nosed at Steve's crotch, mouthing at his cock through his briefs.
As his hair was cut, Steve went through the normal chatter that came with the routine. Tatianna had asked where he was from, being foreign from what she gathered from Tony. When he supplied 'The ocean', Tony clarified it with "Oceania. He's from New Zealand, originally.". Steve supposed that would be a bit more believable. Telling people he was a merfolk seemed to be met with insanity, if Pepper's reaction earlier was an accurate one to the situation.
"Someone's a little grumpy." Bucky said softly. "You got up early, so that might be why." He stated carefully. "Sorry, Pete. We're just talking. Not something your dad and I do one-on-one often. I bet its quieter here than upstairs, though."
--" Steve clenched his mouth shut to keep in the moans as Tony found his sweet spot already.
Peter shook his head slightly, covering his eyes with his hands.
He grinned over at Steve, leaning up on his elbow.
"Okay, okay. I'll stop. Let you rest, love." Steve said warmly, kissing him gently. "Get you some rest."
The boy barely glanced back up at Tony as he hummed in agreement, too invested in a chemistry book.
"I love you two. Always remember that." He grinned before he finally leaned up. "I'm checking dinner then I'll join you both."
Sammy teared up and his bottom lip wobbled, whining around his binky.
"You'd look hot in spandex, too," he added.
"So here's what I'm thinking."
"Its only because I'm a terrible liar, so I figure its just better to be open and honest with people instead of getting caught up in a lie. And you seem pretty open when you're talking with me.".
"Fuck," he growled, easily slipping in a third finger, "Fuck, Steve, please, I need your big fucking cock in me--"
"JARVIS?! Where's Steve?!" He called as he ran toward the smell "Why wasn't I notified of a--?!"
"He was in the service when I was little, so I didn't get to see him much anyway. But something happened, an explosion they told us, and he never came back home.".
"Is that a robot? Looks pretty neat." A unfamiliar voice hummed, causing Tony to turn and have his eyes met with a Mr. Tall, Blond, and Handsome. And holy cow, was he just a vision.
"And this is your floor. Right below mine." Tony explained, leading Steve into the apartment area that served as the man's living space.
"Peter is swelling up, Tony. I think he's allergic to shrimp!" Steve nervously, rushing out his chair and over to Peter to check him out. "We'll probably need to take him to the hospital, because this doesn't look minor."
He moaned loudly, bucking his hips up to try and gain some friction.
He gently washed the lather out of Peter's hair, grabbing the washcloth to start scrubbing him down.
"Steve? Are you even listening?"
"James Monroe," Tony breathed, toes curling at the sight of lace, "Definitely Monroe."
Steve hummed at the kisses softly, just snuggling up to Tony. "I wouldn't want you getting too hot though." He explained, but the thought was nice.  "You're so good to me... Thank you. Usually I would keep someone from helping me with this stuff, but thank you."
"Really? Weird," Tony grinned, gently petting Steve, "We'll get the cherry ones and see what they're like. If you like these."
He poured Peter a glass of milk and a bowl of cereal, sprinkling sugar on it the way he liked. Steve sighed softly because Tony was the one supposed to bring it up. But it didn't matter now, he supposed.
"Mm, you shaved a bit. Face is smooth--" he said with a chuckle, running hands over Tony's cheeks playfully. "Smooooth."
Peter pouted, eventually hopping off his seat and going over to Steve so he could clean his face.
Tony laughed softly, leaning over to smooch Steve's lips.
"Jay? Send me a text if something goes on," Tony said to the ceiling, placing his phone on the table, "Although, no work interruptions. Good? Great."
He faltered for a moment, then shrugged.
"That's good then." Steve said, handing Tony the screwdriver and holding a piece in place. "Now you have some extra tools to work with, too. Y'know, when you do your engineer-y stuff." He hummed.
Sammy looked at Tony curiously as he chewed, noising softly as he waited for his formula. He smacked gently at his highchair table in wait, almost as if impatiently.
good for a first time meal, good job!"
." Steve purred back, running his hands along Tony's sides. "My goodness, 'm speechless, babe. You're gorgeous.”
"Hey gorgeous," he murmured, kissing Steve's jaw.
He tugged him down to kiss him, tugging on his shirt and pulling back.
the responsible ones?" The blond said with a quiet chuckle, kissing Tony back.
"Papa, come color with me!" he whined, blinking doe eyes over at Steve.
"You just have to be asleep in a little while before he comes." Bucky stated, grabbing a slice of pizza and a bit of Chinese food.
"I bet ya could. I have faith." Steve laughed as he stretched and headed towards the bathroom, grabbing aspirin and a glass of water. "Glad to know you enjoyed yourself, though." He grinned cheekily, handing over the goods.
Tony nodded, taking Steve's hand and following him up to the painting room, staring lovingly at their nearly finished mural. "What do you want me to do?"
"Cross my heart," Tony replied quietly, rubbing Peter's back, "We never will, sweetheart."
"Alright, alright, sheesh. Tony, control your small child there," Clint teased, setting his gift aside.
Done up to his satisfaction, Tony grabbed his welding mask and put it on, taking a second to attempt to completely block Steve out.
As he starting storming back to his dorm room, Tony heard a familiar voice down the hallway.
"Gotta get Daddy a Chwismas gift," Peter explained, "I 'ave an idea, buh I dunno where t'get it."
"Then sleep a little, love. Take a catnap." Steve replied, giving Tony an eskimo kiss. "I'll hold down the fort until you wake up."
Peter grunted in his sleep, to which Tony grinned.
"Smart boy! They are bioluminescent." Steve praised, kissing the top of Peter's head. "Daddy is able to teach you all sorts of science-y things. I've never been that great with math and science. He probably could teach me a lot, too." He hummed as they moved on to see the tropical fish.
t'use bad words," he grumbled.
Steve ignored Peter's protests and happily kissed back a bit longer before pulling away.
Bruce barely batted an eyelash at the exchange, rolling his eyes fondly. "If you need anything else from the store, gimmie a ring and I'll have someone bring it over," he offered, "Thank you for the hospitality, Steve."
"Beat who up?"
Peter cheered, causing Tony to put his hands over his ears, groaning loudly at the high-pitched yell. Pepper laughed, pulling Tony into a hug before smooching his forehead, still laughing on her way out the door.
"That answers my question." Tony chuckled. "Then first thing, we'll get you introduced to human food. I'm assuming fish is out of the question, so I'll order us some pizzas. One of my favorites, and I don't have to cook." The man explained, pulling out his phone to call in the order.
He ate more of his food, shrugging.
Bucky paused at the look on Steve's face.
“I know, that's why I am worried.” Tony murmured, sighing when Steve laid a reassuring hand on his shoulder.
"Alright, alright, fine. We'll save PDA for later," Tony muttered, making grabby hands for the whiskey, "But I don't want to get buzzed tonight. Only one more shot for me."
The baby took the teether happily, chewing on it like crazy as they headed towards the kitchen for his breakfast.
wish I was up for sex right now. I'd make you call me that all night."
A little catch-up with the adorable Stark-Rogers' children.
"More fun. Then we can have shower sex," Tony deadpanned, tugging Steve up, "I also want to be fucked on the kitchen counters. Just sayin'."
Steve glanced up to Tony, giving him the 'Eyebrow Raise of Judgment' after hearing that, then glancing at Peter again.
He laughed breathlessly, sitting up.
things to me, darlin'," Tony drawled.
"God, baby, yes," Tony breathed, shaking as he felt Steve coat his insides.
"Okay, Peter. We are gonna get you a cookie, brush your teeth and get you ready for bed, okay?" Steve said quickly, petting Peter's hair and shooting a look at Bucky and Clint. "It'll be past your bedtime soon."
"Mmm, you know I could never leave you like this," Tony teased, leaning down to kiss up Steve's cock, "You're too pretty, bambi."
'"Yeah. Yes, I am. Very much. Which is why I am concerned that you stopped." Steve pointed out, flush clearly evident on his cheeks from the previous heated actions between the two of them. "Did I do something wrong?"
"Steve? Pete? Everything okay?"
"Make it work for
"Wall," Tony grinned, "Then counter. Then shower, and hopefully, desk, if we're not completely spent."
"God, Ste-eve--" he laughed, tears coming to his eyes, unable to get anymore words out.
"Pete, watch your language," Tony added, raising his eyebrow at the boy.
"Yeah, he did, and he's in trouble for it," Tony sighed, still petting Peter, "Papa and I are gonna sit down with Auntie Tasha and Uncle Bruce to talk about them being the responsible ones while we're away."
“If you do find something, relay it to Bruce and I, too. That way we can compare it with our own findings while we’ve got Wolf-Cap under observation.” Tony requested, earning a nod from Natasha and Bucky simultaneously.
"What exactly is it I'm asking for, Tony?" The blond grunted softly, a smirk still on his lips. "Am I not allowed to play with you a little?"
"Yeah, bubba. We'll let you sleep with us tonight. And we'll get you cuddled with both us and Wade." He hummed, kissing Peter's forehead.
--------
Triggers do begin at this point of the story.
Steve looked back with a sympathetic look, reaching out for Tony. "It was that bad, huh?"
"He found screamo music, Steve," Tony wheezed, having to put his hands on his knees to keep himself upright, "He legitimately googled 'adults yelling' and got to rock music."
Steve chuckled at the petname, moving back to kiss Tony's lips gently.
As Tony worked on the other stockings, Steve set to stuffing Tony's. He slipped in a few different candies near the bottom and some coupons to the bakery down a few blocks where he knew Tony like their donuts. The blond had also managed to model a miniature DUM-E out of clay and had it fired and glazed, topping it with a few sketch pages he had drawn of the man careful rolled and stuck into the stocking.
"It's all fair in love and war. You've gotta eat to keep up your strength to hold
He tied it around himself before cleaning off the island, going to set out flour, cookie sheets and the cookie cutters.
"Hm? Oh. Yeah." Tony chuckled softly, feeling himself relax in Steve's arms.
"Yeah. Jus' readin'. You guys still talkin' grown up stuffs?" He asked softly, wriggling in his hammock gently.
After snapping out of his stupor, Steve offered to help Bruce put Tony into his bed and clean up. When they set Tony on his mattress, he reflexively grabbed onto his pillow and nuzzled up against it. Steve stifled back a chuckle at the sight. It was adorable. Steve stopped and shook that last thought from his head as he help Bruce finish cleaning up.
“Well, teddy bear's don't make good officers, and by the look of the clock--" Tony laughed, a dopey smile on his face, "--I think you're runnin' a bit late."
"You liked it, don't lie," Tony scolded, a grin on his lips, "You're being a spoiled brat, Steve."
Peter sniffled and settled down in between them, shivering slightly.
He stopped once he realize he was wet. "Oh, Pete. Did ya have a bad dream?".Steve picked the boy up, careful to avoid any more wetness. "Let’s go get us a shower and some new clothes, okay? It’s alright, bubba."
"Excellent....
"But you do lots of good stuffs." Peter explained, looking at his father surprised. "And you do it all really good. I've never see ya mess up."
"So Papa is like your own Capt'n 'Merica." Peter grinned into the touch. "He keeps ya safe from bad peoples."
Everybody talks, Peter's worried, Christmas is coming.
"Wait for dinner, and that's okay, baby. I'm fine."
Peter stumbled to the bathroom, barely able to hold himself up against the counter.
"Alright, alright. End our wedding night with making love," he promised, a smile on his lips, "If your libido can keep going, that is."
"It’s only because I tried to keep in shape for so long. I've slowed down a little bit." He admitted softly.
"Munchkin, we haven't even seen the worst of it yet." The blond explained. "Messy is the first thing on a baby's checklist."
"Yes, Steve. Like land swimming." He grinned.
"Don't be too loud, we don't want the other students to hear," Tony whispered, still stretching Steve out, "I'm going to give you the best fucking of your life, understand?"
it's a good place."
a year goes!" Peter cried in exaggeration, smacking his tiny hands on the table.
"Made it here just fine, thanks. Jarvis let me in so I didn't disturb you guys." Bruce hummed quietly, coming to sit down near the end of a couch.
Steve grinned back, lightly shaking his head.
He kissed the boy's temple again before standing, going back down to the living room where the tree and garlands were mostly back in place, with a much frazzled Steve on the couch. Peter wiggled out of Tony's arms and went over to him, immediately curling up in his lap. Steve jumped a bit, feeling a little boy suddenly in his lap. He reached down slowly to pet at Peter's hair softly.
Peter sniffled slightly, nodding and nuzzling gently into Tony's chest.
The soul bond enhances libido, shenanigans ensue.
The bathroom door creaked, followed by an 'oh shit' and a scrambling of feet on tile.
"Artificial Intelligence. Like a butler, only hella smart. His name's JARVIS, Jay for short. He’s in prototype stage, and can only do basic things, but I like having the company."
"You want
(See the end of the chapter for
"Can we watch a movie aftah dinnah? Jus' us?" He asked softly, tucking his face into Steve's neck.
"I didn't mean it that way, love." He said quietly. "I meant... Just the specialness behind it. It happens a lot with married couples. Especially with kids. It’s just a rut that happens in marriages. Doesn't mean it can't be brought back. We'd just need to shake things up a little. Make it special again instead of a routine."
"...Can I ask you something?"
"Or boyfriend. Either way."
"Fuck, Steve," he moaned, "God, y'feel s-so good--"
He sunk to his knees to press gentle kisses on the inside of Steve's thighs, nudging his cock through the panties.
"Good." Tony slithered out from under Steve, pulling him up to his feet. "Bedroom," he growled.
"He might be saving those things. Tony did say we were going to try some stuff on our honey--" Steve covered his mouth and said no more, hiding his grin from Clint's prying face.
am going to be baby-obsessed, you are going to be the fussy mother-hen," Tony grinned, taking Steve's hand as they set off for home, "God, Steve, we get to start looking for baby things, and we get to paint-- I was thinking a really soft yellow, and we can do accents in light blues and purples, maybe do a mural on one wall--We have to learn how to change diapers, Jesus
"I don't think there could be a better family for him," she replied softly, tussling Peter's hair, "Take care, guys. I'll see you in the morning."
"Eager?" Tony teased, turning his cheek to nudge Steve's cock, "Poor thing, having to suffer through being loved on."
Tony grunted at him, but smiled anyway, kissing him back. "You're the adorable one, babe," he chuckled, "Not me. Promise."
It took a couple days to get everything sorted and packed, but they were ready by Friday afternoon, car packed and ready to go.
"Things will turn out good. I know it..."
"Tony! You have to calm down. Its okay."
"Tell me how much you know about it, please." The blond said sternly.
"Then we can take it out for now and heat it up later. Because it’s already been cooking." The blond chuckled, patting the man's arm. "If it’s too early to eat, then what is it a good time to do, then?"
"Compromise is better than nothing, bubba." Steve answered softly, laying back on the couch with Peter. "JARVIS? Queue up Terminator for us, please. But can you sort through some violence, please?"
"That's what you get from it?" Tony asked back, looking to Steve softly and trying to keep his chest from fluttering hopefully. But if this Steve that didn't remember could point out that the drawings meant he actually had feelings for Tony, then couldn't that be the possibility? He sighed. Maybe he could tell the blond? He probably wouldn't remember it when he got his actual memories back, so what the hell.
Sammy gurgled back at Steve, reaching out to grab his formula. Peter skipped into the kitchen and went up on his tiptoes, looking up at Steve.
"Oh my god, Steve," Tony groaned, picking Steve's hips up to thrust deeper, "Y'feel so good, baby, all loose f'me--"
"Look how cute you are, Samwich," Tony gasped, tickling the squealing baby.
"I do. My sex drive is
size?" He laughed, smooching the boy's cheek, "You wait here, and I’ll go get a pair."
"If I hafta," he muttered.
, Tony. He's precious." The blond enthused.
Steve gave him a small look.
Tony hummed back, smooching Steve's cheek before heading upstairs. He grabbed one of Steve's hoodies first, to cover the bandages. Tiptoeing into Peter's room, Tony sat on the edge of the boy's bed, gently shaking him.
He sighed when he realized he couldn't drag his Papa, opting to hop down the stairs and cling onto Tony instead.
"Mmm. I know why," Tony replied with a hum, brushing his fingertips over the nape of Steve's neck, "I'll explain once we return to the flat."
"Just a lil ouchie, baby, you're okay," he murmured, bouncing Sammy.
"Is it only my eyes?" He grinned, kissing up Steve's jaw.
He grinned again, tongue poking out of his mouth while he worked.
"You son of a bitch, you made me laugh on purpose to break character," Tony grumbled, leaning up to smooch Steve's lips, "Fine,
"Okay." Steve whispered, leaning up carefully to give Tony a quick kiss. "We'll be here."
would be hard enough. I'm surprised that he married you, let alone had a kid with you, Stevie."
Tony woke much later in the afternoon, happily pressed up against Steve's warm figure. He moved slightly, relishing in the dull ache Steve had left him with; popping open his eyes, Tony ran a finger over the palm-shaped prints, nearly making himself hard at the thought of Steve leaving those prints in welts on his ass.
"Not bad. Mischievous." Steve smirked back, grabbing ahold of Tony's wrists and slapping the cuffs on them. "But even mischievous boys get taught lessons. To the desk. Now."
They would come randomly, drifting down into the water from the world above. When Steve wasn't busy with his more serious military duties, he would go to investigate the objects. They fascinated him. They were so different from the objects they had in the ocean. He started to go looking for these objects any chance he got and had started to collect the ones that fascinated him the most. One object he found sparked his interest in particular one day.
"Just as I thought," he breathed, "A true Adonis on earth."
"Yeah. I thought it would be cool, y'know. For Peter, especially. I mean, what kid wouldn't want to know there was a superhero made specifically after them?" He explained.
Steve found a bench to sit down, letting Peter sleep against him as he messed around on his phone for a while. He noticed some endearing eyes from some mothers walking by, offering them all a small smile as they did.
"Now try to be polite when we meet Ms. Rushman in here." Steve warned. "With her reputation, she may have put half the bodies in the morgue herself..."
"We're gonna have a lot of fun when we get home, Stevie," Tony breathed, "Lots of fun."
Peter nodded seriously as he worked on Steve's 'tattoo', tongue poking out of his mouth.
Tony was up and about already; Clint's screaming had done its trick to wake him up. He was showered and dressed, bed made, room picked up--with a sigh, Tony sat down at his desk chair, putting his feet up.
He gently grinded Steve's lap, looking back at him with a cheeky grin. Steve let out a small groan as Tony ground against him.
." He grumbled. "Don't just leave me like this."
"Right there with ya..." Steve said through a moan, rolling his hips with Tony's thrusts. "'Ya feel
Tony sat on the bed and pulled his legs up, tapping the comforter for a minute.
"Oh, Steven, Steven,
"Good their food is filling, then." Steve said carefully, squeezing Tony's hand back as they entered.
"Mmm, I love you so much." Steve whispered happily as he wrapped himself around Tony sweetly, latching on like a limpet. "My perfect man. So perfect to me."
"Papaaa," Peter whined, tears prickling in his eyes, "S'
He bucked his hips up into Steve's mouth, pushing his bangs to the side.
"M'good, pwomise," Peter muttered.
He sighed happily, kissing Steve back.
"Happy Birthday, by the way." He whispered sweetly before pulling away and stripping down to get in the shower with Tony. "You don't get your bit of a present until later tonight, though. Got stuff planned." He hummed.
He reached over and took Tony's hand carefully, gently kissing the man's knuckles.
Steve blushed up at the brunet, turning his gaze away with an unintentional pout to his lips.
"Mmm, make up for it at the cabin," Tony chuckled, wrapping his arms around Steve, "C'mon. Sleep before munchkin gets here."
"Nuh uh." Peter mumbled in protest. "I's be a good boy. Pwomise, Daddy."
"Fair enough. Alright, its back to you.".
Steve gasped softly as he sunk down, trying to get used to this position. "Ah, god..." He breathed, laying his head into the crook of Tony's neck. "So full, baby--"
He stumbled lightly towards the bathroom, taking care of his morning business before he would head out to find Tony. Before he left the bathroom however, Steve stopped as he caught his new reflection.
Steve had plates in his hands to carry to the dining room, stopping and giving a fond smile at the new weight on his back.
He swayed his hips while he walked to the kitchen, dancing Peter around the room till he set him on his booster seat.
Tony waved at the retreating duo, laughing quietly as he dried his hair off.
The Oceania/ New Zealand joke is thanks to Renee, my IRL Tony :3
"We're gonna pack you some stuff to be all set over at your Auntie and Uncles', okay? You're gonna visit them for a little bit, okay cutie?"
The red mer scowled, “Yeah way to back me up guys. Sup pop! You’re looking extra pissy today. Is that a record? Did Unk eat all your shrimp again? Jor poop on the floor? I let him out by the way so it’s not my fault if he likes shitting under your desk so much.”
James stepped closer and wrapped his arms around Loki, “You ok babe?” He had to admit it now that the evidence was staring him in the face, Loki was not his usual self; there was unrest around the taller mans shoulders.
“I..I can handle it please..”
"Hows the food?"
He stood and did as he was told, movements easy with the alphas unspoken direction- unbuckle the belt, unbutton and unzip, pull them down now take them off. He could almost hear the words in his head, Fold the pants now the shirt, and put them both on that chair - Good.
Steve shook his head and smiled at the thought of the little girls eyes sparkling at the sight of the midnight blue vehicle. So much like her father when it came to cars, Tony's rule fell by the way side on nights when Wendy had been fussy and only a trip around the city that never sleeps- was the only thing that would sooth the pup.
“How could she do that?” Fitz carefully questioned, the omega inching a bit closer to his alpha. “I mean, a broken bond would be even worse right?”
“Serious who makes a robot of their dead friend? That’s just some shit, nick needs to have a serious talk with his little bro.” Tony said blasting one of the many versions of Capricorn.
“What the hell does that mean for us?” Barnes said, looking around the corner to see Mallen standing up – his body regenerating.
He remembered those times in flashes and painful dreams, he remember a lot that he wished he could forget. Lady Eir had said it was the only way to defeat the darkness in his head.
“Clint take Bucky down to medical. Jarvis has a room set up for him.” Bruce said quietly before turning his attention to his friend. “Pepper is with the kids and Natasha took Steve up to the penthouse a while ago, she‘s probably on the coms with Phil about now .“ He paused for a moment really looking at his friend. “Tony...damn it. Look I don't even know how you're standing here right now. Loki told us…”
Stark leaned in pressing their lips together softly. He felt Steve reach up tangling his large hands into his tank top as he pulled away. “See big guy? That grade A USDA Stark, no imitations.”
He didn't have friends, not really. Loki simply found himself in the orbit of Thor's friends. The only lengthy conversations he may have had, had been with chambermaids or the occasional chatty palace guard. However, that wasn't the same as having a friend.
The group exchanged skeptical looks, perhaps Stark hid his crazy a little better than most. Sure, they had heard tales of things like sirens and every other fairy tale that children and the superstitious may believe. However, they had been from one side of the world to the other fighting from land to sea and never saw anything that they couldn't explain. If such tales had been true then surly someone other than the desperate or inebriated would be there to bear witness to it?
“Sorry Sir but I do not  believe that wise.”
Finally, she said something. She did the one thing he needed right then. She gave him a mission, something he could do to end the cycle of what ifs in his head.
Duchess bumped her massive head against his hip in greeting before finding a spot in front of the fire to stretch out. He watched her for a moment before waving a hand at the cupboards- summoning a cup and saucer. Lazy - maybe, effective - yes.
The snowfall was already starting to cover over the remnants of the base. Blankets of white disguising the blood and ash with every frozen flake. Steve suspected that by morning nature would have already reclaimed the area entirely. He of course would not be here to see it. With the adrenaline of the fight beginning to drain away from his muscles, the cold felt more pronounced. Alternatively, perhaps it was simply old memories trying to claw at the back of mind.  Whatever the case there were more pressing matters.
It was somewhere rural and unsuspecting and they touched down outside of a wooded area and then…then it was fuzzy.
Hank considered his first opinion of Loki when Xavier had initially told him of the mage joining their academy. He'd been resistant, having little knowledge of Loki outside what he had seen on the news during the invasion. At the moment, Hank felt like his eyes had been opened. Over the last few years he had seen Loki for more than what he had expected. He'd seen a man marked by his past fighting to prove himself. Now... now he saw a young man who had been broken by his very roots.
Tony gasps placing a hand over his chest in mock horror, “Such language! I know someone who would wash your mouth out with soap for that. Come on, we both have extremis; well...you have the bootleg sad beta tester. I have the future. We both know how this is going to end.”
It's not like the internet was going to be anymore knowledgeable about his omega...or that he'd tried that already back on the shampoo isle.  Yeah...he didn't do that at all. He took it like a man and just smelled about 30 bottles until something seemed familiar.  Loki shouldn't have just written down “shampoo” if he had a preference.
Steve sniffled, “I feel stupid…I’m crying over chips. I hate this.”
“Copy that”
One golden eyebrow crept up, “Stark if you’re going to try and lecture me about anything, just don’t.” Steve really thought this was going to be Tony’s way of telling him he shouldn’t have trusted Bucky. That he should not have let his old friend get the better of him because of sentiment. Steve didn’t want to hear that.  Even now, even after everything that had happened he wanted to believe that James Barnes was still in there somewhere.
This was only the first step if what the doctor and midwife said was true. Anthony's heart and lungs were weak and even if he survived the next few nights - that would be a miracle.
Jane clears her throat and smiles warmly when the other omegas turn to look keenly at her. She holds up the bakery box happily. “Hey guys brought you some treat but looks like you have me beat by the smell of things.”
The young woman snorted back a laugh and then quickly composed herself. “No Sir nothing like that, actually… I would like to order one more test to be sure.”
Clint : hey sweetie I said I wanted to get in your pants what do you think :P
Even now, driving out of the city as the lights and buildings grew farther and farther apart, he could still see the look in his loves eyes. Just like the fading city behind him, the glow in Loki's eyes had begun to fade with every ounce of bad news. Perhaps it was easier at the time to just file that information away. It was simpler to say 'he'll be okay...he's always okay.'
“What do we do Cap!” Sam Shouted from the controls.
Title: Fuckin with loki
I I like all of my suits to be a little too shiney
Tony had managed to cobble together certain set of rules for when he returned form long business trips. The idea for doing this hadn't actually been his – he will renounce the origin of the rules if you ask, because they are nothing like Howard's Rules. Even so, there was a need for them as Pepper pointed out “If you don't take care of yourself then how can you take care of anyone else.”
The alpha slid his arm around his mates back and looked up into those clear blue eyes he loved. “I don't know but I don't want to risk anything and I know you wouldn't want that either. You have to leave this one to me babe.”
Anger and irritation dissolving like sand in the wind, Loki turned away, now he felt nothing but sadness. “I think perhaps you try too hard to see the good in others. It blinds you to their obvious defect.”
Someone didn't get the 'sassy independent Steve memo' because when Bucky just showed up the day after they brought Tony home- a duffle bag full of clothes over one shoulder and a shaving kit under his arm, Steve didn't say a word.
Back at the tower, Steve was about to have his first ultra sound. The twins were naturally excited see their baby brother or sister. Having woken up early that morning and felt the need to let everyone in the tower know what a wonder big brother and big sister they were going to be. It had been too cute for words, Tony of course captured much of this on the towers security feeds and was having it all saved in a family file.
“Completed Sir, I think you will be pleased with the results. Shall I include these ..additional measures in your suit or send them to Director Fury?”
Or maybe he just needed a drink.
Change that dated ass thinking, Howard and the old alphas club had.
As if he did not expect to have much of a future left.
How could he resist that?
This was not the best time for the team to be overwhelmed, there other heavy hitter was off world and the back up members like Sam and Scott were out on separate missions. Steve would be handicapped should something happen to Tony. That last thought wasn't something that Phil wanted to touch with a 10ft pole.
Date number three, Tony showed up to the common floor and set a simple white box in Steve’s lap before slipping off to the kitchen whistling innocently.
“Well blame biology; a guy can get awful defensive after having his house blown up.”
This is why he can't have nice things, Tony wanted to say no, go to voice mail but who was he kidding. There is only so many reason fellow geniuses called him and it was rarely ever anything good.
“This what you want?” Tony asked, gently slipping his hand around Steve’s wrist under the table.
Blue eyes shot up meeting the face of the former SHIELD director, Nick Fury.  As much as Steve hated to admit it he was glad to see his former boss that meant it had not been 70years.  It meant there was still a chance that everything was fine.
“Sit down Loki.” She says simply and the man looks surprised to find himself standing. “Sit. Down.” Natasha didn't want to have to do it; she detested pushing her own scent to kow omegas. Sometimes you had to use the tools you had, in Loki's case – physical strength would have been useless, biology however was something he couldn't fight. So the redhead lifted her chin and locked eyes with him, the sharp scent of command laces the air.
Tony leaning over and kissed the side of the omega head. “Just a while ago, Tasha was getting sick of my handsome face. Can you believe that? Like Wilson is a better roomie…”
The soldier thought about their son, Peter had already lost a family once, now thinking that his father was dead and now his other father angry and distant. That’s not what either man wanted for their child. Steve knew how it felt to grow up without a father; while there was no deny he loved his mother and Sarah had don’t everything to care for and protect him, Steve always felt different. He knew Tony had not had the best upbringing where Howard was concerned and they had both been so adamant about things being better for Peter.
Steve spit a line of blood and struggled to his feet. “We can walk outta here Buck, we can fix you. Ya remember me, just think about it. I used to come to your ma’s house on Wednesday nights for dinner. Your sister Irene, she taught me how to sew so my ma wouldn’t have to keep mendin my clothes for me.”
By the time Steve was undressed Tony was already in bed with the covers  turned down. The brown-eyed Alpha was striped to a pair of boxers and tank top. Tony was laying there with one arm extended across the bed just…watching him.  With a single glance to the pillow, Steve took it at his next order, climbing in and pulling the blanket up.  For a moment, they just lay there sharing space, sharing breath. It was so intimate despite how non-physical it was.
“Tell me I can see…” Sam muttered.
Once Steve was settled in, Tony ordered out and had a stack of pizzas on the common room table by the time Steve finished changing into something more suitable.
Wendy looked over at him momentarily and he held a finger to his lips. She smirked and placed both hands to her moth with a nod, pigtails bobbing in agreement. She looked every bit of Steve but all that personality was his. They were going to have their hands full with her that was going to be sure. Tony wouldn't change her for the world.
The solder had taken a lot of those lately, between guilt and anxiety  - Lust seemed to be a new emotion entering the mix.
Howard needed to come up with something better if hoped to prolong his son’s life. What that something was he didn’t know. Everything was dependent on something else and with the millions of moving parts, something could fail. Something could cause his boy’s death in an instant. One error and he would be powerless to save the only good thing he had left in this world.
"We'll be back," Tony told Steve, kissing his cheek before letting Peter lead him over to the public restrooms.
Tony sighed and nodded, slouching down in his seat.
"Gotcha, munchkin!"
"Oh, how could I forget that?" Steve as he remembered. "I was so surprised by it. It was amazing."
Steve blinked for a moment, looking away a bit.
"Don't talk like that, baby." Steve said soothingly, shushing Tony softly. "You are so wonderful and brilliant, I honestly don't deserve
"Does he? Gee, can't imagine why." Steve teased, getting everything set up for now and migrating towards Tony and the baby.
"And it’s not like I should call you Tony in front of the boys. To them, you're not Tony. You're Daddy." Steve stated, setting the table with a smirk. "Besides, when Sammy starts talking, do you want him to call you Daddy or Tony?"
"Wait," Tony called, hearing Steve's footsteps, "Close your eyes."
"Yes, Peter. Dinner and cuddles." Steve laughed, petting the boy's hair. "Did Auntie Pepper give you sugar or something?"
Tony blushed, nibbling on his bottom lip before nodding.
"Tony... You--ah--you okay?"
"Steve Rogers." He said with a light smile.
"I highly doubt you've gained anything, baby," Tony murmured gently, "Really. Pete doesn't know better, when he's older he'll have
"That's what
, sir!" Steve said with a playful scoff. "I'll have you know Tony thoroughly enjoys our escapades. And I'm quick to go whatever speed he wants me to." He preened, setting up another piece and screwing it in.
Sammy gurgled up at Steve curiously, wiggling his little fingers up at his face.
"Very nice, thank you." Steve hummed, settling in the position with a content hum. He wrapped one hand under his pillow and rested his other on top of Tony's that were around his waist. He let his eyes drift close as he relaxed, finding comfort at the other being with him. "Goodnight, Tony."
Steve twitched out of sleep feeling hands rake through his hair, looking up with a soft smile at his husband.
"I was hoping to break off whatever we had started before we got too involved. I thought it would make it easier for both of us when it came for me to leave. But you make it damn near impossible.".
Tony just began to smirk.
"Stan? Like, grey on the sides, dark on top, Stan?" Bruce interrupted, "That guy's a genius, Steve. No way could he have messed it up."
"Understandable. With what he did, it’s horrible to say, but he doesn't deserve your tears." Steve grunted softly, kissing at Tony's face. "No one who hurts you terribly deserves them."
"Shh-shh-shhhh, hey, it’s alright. You didn't ruin anything, Tony." Steve soothed, running his hand along Tony's back. "You
"Yeah, well y'know. Car troubles.".
"Yes, do you want seconds?" Tony laughed, pulling his bowl back.
"Stay right by me please? Or I'll probably get all sweaty palmed and everything."
"Fuck," he whispered, eyes fluttering.
Steve tucked the blankets up around Peter carefully, letting the boy snuggle his penguin. He rubbed the boy's back soothingly to put Peter to sleep, humming a soft lullaby.
"When you said I would see you again, I didn't think you meant like this." The dark haired human said with worry in his voice, exhaling in relief when he saw the other man stir awake. "Oh, thank God, you're breathing."
"Ewwww,
They lay together in silence for a few minutes, until Steve spoke again.
Tony went quiet and cast his gaze downward, nodding.
Tony let out a breathy laugh, thrusting faster into Steve.
"I can
With a tiny growl, Peter cursed under his breath, stomping away. Tony watched him leave with a sigh, turning to Steve.
"Yeah, yes, please--"
He grinned up at Steve, making kissy noises up at him. Steve made noises back, heading up to their room and settling Tony in their bed gently and joining him under the covers. He pulled Tony comfortably on top of him nuzzling his cheek.
Steve's face dropped. He had forgotten. He covered his face with his hand and groaned.
Peter whined, putting his hands on his face to hide his embarrassed flush. Tony laughed softly and tugged the boy to his chest, rubbing circles in his back.
Steve had overheard as he headed back in with his family, smiling warmly at Peter's proclamation. He sat down and gently pulled Peter onto his lap on the couch, smooching his cheek.
Sammy screeched back in response, managing not to cry but giving them all a freaked out look.
Tony looked over at Steve, making kissy noises at him. Steve noised back, still laying on the floor relaxed as he looked up at Tony and Peter on the couch.
"I know, but I know now and there isn't anything to change that." Steve said softly. "It happened in the past and we'll get through it. I'll help you, I promise."
"Later? Where are you going to be?" He asked curiously.
away. We'll worry when we get there. And by that time, who knows? The kid might wanna go to school again," Tony replied, petting Steve's hair, "Let's take each year at a time, okay?"
"Daddyyyy," Peter complained.
"Art room should be fine. It’s closer." Steve responded. "And with the play blanket, there is less chance of this one hurting himself if he tries to sit up again." He chuckled lightly.
Tony's breath hitched, but he kept a straight face, slowly tugging off is jeans to reveal the panties with garters and stockings. "It's not all I wear well," he murmured, his cock achingly obvious in the lacy material.
"I can't each much, I'll throw up," he mumbled sadly, tucking his face into Steve's chest, "m'sorry."
"Correction.
'splosion, buh that was Daddy's fault--"
Today was meant to be a good day, but somehow managed to fall to pieces. He forced himself to sleep, waiting until he would wake to Sammy's first cries of the night...
"I'll cut you up some peanut butter and jelly, okay? Then you can go do whatcha want until dinner, since all the adults will be talking in the living room," Tony murmured, reaching up to pet Peter's hair.
"Sleepy," the boy puffed, eyes hazy, "Arm huwts."
"Mh hm, standing there thinking of what you're gonna do next. I know that look. I see it on your daddy too much." Steve explained, keeping his eye on Peter.
"Here, I'll give ya a boost." Steve grinned as he hefted the boy up to where he could grab the flour. "Got a good hold of it? Cuz we're going down."
He made a quick whine as he felt Tony flick his tongue along the slit. "And you're a pro with that mouth, good lord."
"Big peoples are weird..." Peter hummed, letting Tony scrub as he played with his ducky. "Weird kissies, yellin' at 'chother at night-nights cuz you love 'chother. Weird."
Sammy had calmed down for now, watching again as the others colored. On Steve's page, the baby smacked lightly at an uncolored area, to which Steve chuckled.
"He always does the good stuff when I'm not around," Tony grumbled, eyeing Peter before grinning, bringing out his other hand from behind him to show the boy his treat.
Peter hugged at Tony's leg bashfully, a smile on his face.
"Thank you very much, Doctor Blake. That takes a lot of worry away if this happens again, God forbid." Steve sighed, reaching to take the paper and shake the man's hand.
"I'm surrounded by kissers." Peter groan, putting a hand over his face which Sammy mimicked.
Tony practically broke down, clutching at Steve's back and neck; he curled himself up into Steve's warmth, years of pent-up emotion flooding over his carefully constructed dam.
science experiments. And don't try to pull another fast one on me, I made sure I took the answers out of the back of the book."
He was cut off by a shrill scream, quickly scrambling off the futon with a pained wheezed as he dashed up to the first floor. Peter sat in the middle of the living room, clutching at his knee.
"So manly." Steve chuckled, snuggling Peter back warmly. "Well, now all us men can do our manly juice bonding together until the others get here. Because we're men."
He kissed the head of his cock before taking him in his mouth, scraping his teeth down Steve's length. Steve mewled gently, hand shooting down to rake through Tony's hair.
"And what exactly is the point of this?" He asked curiously, looking at the ceiling as well.
Tony huffed another laugh, bringing Steve's hands up to kiss his knuckles.
"We'll do this again in the morning and again that night. Let it heal." Steve murmured, petting gently at Tony's face. "What am I gonna do with you?" He sighed with a fond smile, sooner turning relieved as he nuzzled into Tony's neck.
"Well, at least she is doing it with good intentions." Steve hummed, making his plate, “What do you think’ll happen if she
“As long as we try to get ahold of him. If I end up stuck like this for just a little while or… long term, I’d like to at least know how to handle it.” Steve said back, a soft sadness hidden in his tone. “There is still tonight and tomorrow night in this go round of changes, and I’d like some advice if this is something I’ll be forced biologically to do.”
"Well thank you for getting it. It's adorable." Steve grinned, finishing rolling out the dough and greasing up the pans.
"You make a good point." Steve panted lightly, running a hand under Tony's shirt and along his chest. "I just want it nice and sweet. Nothing too wild. Save that for the trip."
"Oh jeez, Fury
"Alright," he breathed, clunking over to his testing pad, "Jay, gimmie a fifteen percent boost."
"Bad," he scolded, undoing his pants himself and stepping out of them.
"I hope to God you don't have pneumonia, Tony." Steve hummed, reaching and stroking Tony's face gently. "But why did Bucky yell at you?"
"Oh my god. Shush, you," Tony playfully smacked his hand away, raising an eyebrow at Steve, "You need to get up once the medicine kicks in to work out the ache. You know that, right?"
"You're gonna spoil me. And I'm not sure how I feel about that." Steve grinned back, wiggling closer to Tony on the bed.
" A voice resonated into the room, making Steve jump and be on the alert.
"Well, that's good you don't ache as much." Steve hummed, walking over and smooching Tony's cheek. "Speaking of aches though, Bucky was the one hobbling around this morning. Which I found hilarious." Steve chuckled, hugging Tony from behind the chair.
"Yes we do. And this human's name is Tony." He admitted with a small smile.
"If you wanna wait, that's okay," Tony smirked, sliding onto the back of the bike, "Let's go, sweetheart. I want to hear your screams. You know, outside the bedroom."
The next morning, Tony was woken up by small scuffling noises from somewhere in the room. He cracked an eye open and fumbled for his glasses, rolling his eyes at the bear raiding his sock drawer.
"They're nice to
He grinned, rolling one of the beads around between his fingers.
"Stark-Rogers' residence."
"I thought we was gonna be in you 'n Papa's bed?" Peter said pitifully, Steve nodding gently in reply.
Steve took him in deeper still, starting to bob and hollow his cheeks. He hummed low to send vibrations up through Tony's body, not planning to stop until the other would come.
Peter shifted and yawned, blinking his eyes sleepily as he woke up.
"God, Steve, I don't know what to do other than go in and talk to the teacher, or pull Pete out and homeschool him. He needs the social groups, but he's getting teased and I can almost guarantee it's because he has two fathers."
"You know this guy?" Metal Arm questioned, raising a brow at the man.
"M'gonna sweep aaaaaall nite," Peter proclaimed around his pizza, "No yellin's gonna wake me up, neither!"
recognizable after all this time.
Tony nodded, moaning softly into his kisses.
"Right. Stitches," Tony muttered, already planning to take them out, "Oh my god, your hand feels
!' Steve responded with a chuckle to his words 'I am a merperson, not half fish, despite us looking so. There technically is a difference. And we're omnivores, so this is normal. We just usually save the bigger fish than krill or shrimp for special occasions.'
"Steeeve," Tony grumbled, voice a pitch higher than intended, "You know I don't like being embarrassed."
He nuzzled at Steve's chest, blinking puppy dog eyes up at him.
"Thank you, bubba. It’s not your fault but that means a lot." He said with a small smooch to the boy's head.
He grinned, nipping at Steve's bottom lip.
He nodded and took the finished bottle from Sammy, letting Steve take him from his lap.
"Okay, Papa," Peter hummed, hopping off his chair to follow Tony.
Tony was quiet for a moment before a smiled,
"I want this. Oh
Steve's ears perked up, then he slightly pursed his lips.
Steve nodded softly, understanding perfectly. He leaned in and gave Tony a gentle kiss.
Steve smooched his forehead, looking to both brunets. "I think some apologies would be nice from you both, don't you think?"
"Fine, fine, sheesh," Clint grumbled, "As soon as your dads--"
He set Peter down so he could turn the tap on, crouching down to Peter's level.
?" Tony whined, trying to wriggle out from Steve's grasp, "That--we didn't get caught, nobody--"
"But you don't doubt the possibility." Fury finished in a low tone. "The only ones I have ever seemed to encounter are nothing but barbarians. So I don't doubt the bulk majority of them are the same. The odds of finding a decent one are too low to risk the loss of one of my best men."
The boy put his hands up over his eyes, to which Tony felt a little piece of his heart chip. With a sigh, he scooped the boy up, rubbing his back.
"Here, munchkin. This isn't fizzy."
"Hey--" Steve grinned, kissing him back and wrapping arms around his waist. "Sheets are in the wash, dinner's in the oven, and we have about 45 minutes to spend until it’s done. What would you like to do?"
"The adventures will be in development, but the three origins are all here in this book." He explained quietly. "Just figured one would be enough for tonight since Peter wanted to hear about Spiderman."
Hey! Not dead. I know it seemed so.
panic rose inside of him. He wanted to hide, to activate the suit, to disappear through a hole but his mind was even more clouded when he smelled the scent of an Alpha. His biology worked for him now, no matter how much his mind protested. He was panting, supporting himself on the wall. He needed and needed and needed and he felt like he was fainting soon.
. Anything. He needed friction needed to- Needed-

he growled and he didn't even need to check, Tony was already wet and open. He pressed his length against Tony’s hole, still finding the self-control to stay still for a bit longer. “I want you to beg for it, Tony. I want that there will be no misunderstandings that you
“Shh, Tony, look at me”
“I see.”
Still not dead although it definitely looked like it! Thank you very much for all the comments, they're what keeps me going tbh.
“You’re a lifesaver. Literally. I just… I can’t go through this again.”
Tony took a deep breath. “Yes, Alpha.”
not to mention as an adult.
“Enough. If you fail to do this, your punishment will even be harsher.”
He had never been scared of Steve before. But then again, he had never hit him without provocation. He needed to tell him that he was dreaming, that this had not been on purpose. But he was still trying not to cry. Stupid damn Omega biology. He had been more than glad that this over-emotionality had been locked away alongside the other aspects of his biology with the suppressants. Well, not anymore. He knew he probably only consisted out of distress pheromones right now. "I am so sorry, please, I am sorry, I didn't mean to, please, believe me, please, I just… I thought you..." his voice cracked.
He got pressed underneath the water again. He couldn’t breathe, his lungs hurt so much, the pressure was building up, slowly, slowly, he had to breathe, had to breathe, he needed to, to-
Hello strangers... So, it's been a month but I just couldn't get myself to write. Now I did though so have fun with the new chapter!
into his bedroom.
The stock markets would fall, all the publicity for the Omega Rights Movement would be in vain. No, he wouldn’t have any of that. So it would be option one.
Tony goes into labor.
“They are,” Tony nodded and was stunned himself.
“Goddamnit, Tony!” He hissed as soon as Steve had closed the door. “You are an Omega?”
Steve clenched his jaw. “Stand up.”
The room was silent and Fury made sure to keep the eye contact until he had calmed. Even fucking Fury was using his biology to his advantage, Tony thought bitterly as he broke it at some point, looking down.
He sighed and carried him to the bed. Tony let out a keen sound in his sleep and pressed against him, his heartbeat slowing down. Yes, that was what being an Alpha had to feel like; Good, like you were protecting the most important thing in the entire world.
Thank you for all the nice comments and encouragements you guys are giving me. You rock, folks!
“Now you’ll go on the bed, your position is on your hands and knees.”
Hey guys, I know a short chapter. I just wanted to highlight Steve's opinion for a change. he isn't as vicious as one might think and I think his thinking makes sense... somehow.
If anyone else would have told him about the signs, he would have laughed. He would have told them what was going on and probably made fun of them for suppressing the only logical explanation. But right now he was way too oblivious to see them.
“Didn’t we? No, we didn’t,” he sighed. During the pregnancy, he had tried to avoid looking for names. He knew Steve wanted to give them names of family members, their parents maybe. But Tony knew all too well that this was a legacy they didn’t want. He had only gotten the second name of his father and it had been enough for years of self doubt.
“Don’t worry, you’re body will get pregnant again as soon as it’s ready to. You don’t have to be afraid.”
“Bidding?”
opinion,” Tony said. “I don’t wanna know. I am freaking out enough as it is. I don’t need to know if it’s twins, triplets or quadruplets.”
“Thank you, last time I checked I wasn’t four.” He took the fruit and bit inside it, trying to come up with a plan. Any plan. This man would not stay here long enough to knock him up, this much was clear.
to know. He had just said this because he knew Steve wanted to know it desperately (he didn’t know why - probably because the fact you
Steven frowned and did so, probably just because of the shock Rhodey would ask something like that of him in his own house. “Do we have a problem, Lieutenant Colonel?”
“I am leaving. Keep the fucking penthouse.” He balled his fists and went towards the door. Steve was not having any of it and caught up with him, squeezing his wrist.
“You will not go anywhere!”
His head got put underwater again. By the time he finally got to breathe again, he couldn’t form a single thought.
“You can throw up as much as you want. You will eat.”
“So? It’s
“I was talking to you.”
Ah, there it was again. The omegist view that Omegas couldn’t do shit. Tony sighed internally. Steven seemed to notice that and promptly continued.
He was startled when Steve’s hand was on his backside again, this time to soothe him. “Shh, it is over and you are forgiven. I am proud of you. You took your punishment so well, Omega.”
The other obeyed after some time, his whole body still trembling.
“Shhh, I know. I am gonna help you, Tony.” Steve pushed a second finger into Tony, then a third. He wasn’t sure if preparing him was even necessary. But he wouldn’t risk something to tear. Who knew how long Tony hadn’t done this - the fact it hadn’t shown, that Steve had never found out told him Tony had taken illegal suppressants. He knew their risks - after all, there was a reason why they were prohibited.
Steve had never seen him like this before. No cocky smile anymore, no restrain, just utter desperation and distress. He slowly put his arms around him and let him cry on his shoulder. “Shh, that’s right. Let it all out. Can you tell me what happened?”
Now, this was a random boost of energy. 2200 words within an hour. I have a job interview now, wish me luck!
“And that’s bad because...?”
Tony did. He had tried to struggle at first but really; the consequences weren’t to his liking. It was better to avoid handcuffs or even worse. It seemed like they would go to the OPP if he wanted or not. And it seemed the night wouldn’t turn out like he had wanted it to turn out anyway.
When Steve came back, Tony had calmed down enough not to get a panic attack by his sight. Rhodey had tried to comfort him and to tell him to calm down. After all, he had several options in that matter. Not all of them were legal but his friend had assured him he would gladly break the law if it benefited his mental health.
“Jup.”
“What are
“You make sure I am mush, yeah, got that.”
“Well, I do. Now fuck off.” he moved the other way but Ford was already determined not to let him move an inch. He pressed him against the wall. It seemed he’d had too much to drink as well. “Last chance.”
“Tones….” he set Jamie down. “Look, I am also glad you sleep more but what he does is not right. he might not break any laws as your Alpha, but if he wasn’t, you’d press charges, right?”
“The first is obedience. You will do as you are told or-”
(Also thank you to google docs, making it possible to write /everywhere/ and Grammarly that shows my swiss ass how to write properly in English)
It was like something inside of him was released he hadn’t known he even possessed. Not for a long time, at least. “What, are you gonna kick me into my stomach now, Rogers? Is that how you guys did it back in the forties?”
Steve learns how wrong he's been
“For… for… I don’t know, Steve. I don’t know. I am too stupid to know. Please, just tell me.” the words came out just like that, he frantically fisted his Alpha’s shirt to have something to hold onto.
“I see.” he didn’t. Not even in the least. “So… you… what’s my role here? I mean… I don’t know what do do, what will make you happy. I just want to make you happy. I am
Steve's face went red hearing that, letting out a nervous chuckle.
"Oh." Tony bit his lip.
"Then don't look in the spray, silly," Tony laughed, turning Pete so he faced away from the water.
"Twenty-five--"
"That was easy, knock on wood," Tony whispered.
"Jeez. All this for wanting to kiss you?" Steve said with a pout. "S'not very nice, Mr. Stark-Rogers. Not very nice at all."
"It's barely eight. If you wanna surprise me with candles and shit when I'm asleep, be my guest," Tony laughed, leaning over to press a kiss to Steve's lips, "Actually, I'm getting up to get out of this and clean myself up before we get started."
"C'mere, lay down," Tony grinned, scooting back against Steve's chest once he sat down.
"I'm gonna give him a bath, then you're giving him art lessons and we'll go get him his own sketchbook," Tony hummed, taking the baby bag from Steve, "We'll have a movie after, and I'll make some pasta for us. Good?"
"This is gonna be fun," he chuckled to himself, heading off to change into slacks and a button down.
"Papaaaa," he whined, arms stuck in his shirt.
Once the elevator binged open, Tony went over to sign them out, still holding a fast asleep Peter.
"Nyah!" Steve shouted in surprise, flinching forward a bit.
Steve looked to all of them with a tired but thankful smile, sending them a nod in response.
"Like-- do that to me? I mean, I have a higher pain tolerance," Tony continued quickly, feeling his face heat up, "But-- yeah, I mean, if you don't want to, that's okay--"
," Pete chimed in.
"Like heaven. Oh, yea, we're getting you one," He purred, striding off towards the aisle after tossing cuffs into the cart.
"Yeah yeah yeah!" Peter said excitedly, bouncing in Tony's arms. "Does Papa like da science museum?" He asked curiously.
"Don't run, kid, that's how things get broken," he teased softly.
He shrugged, scuffing his shoe on the floor.
Tony couldn't reply, too busy controlling his whines. He rocked his hips slowly before starting to move, hands on Steve's chest as he bounced up and down.
Tony beckoned to Steve and had him lay down, easily scooting back into his chest so they could both watch Peter.
"A-ah--" Steve voiced out, rolling his hips back. "Jeez... Ya fill me up. Feels good--" he praised, starting to move his hips up then back down in slow, short thrusts to start.
“I love you too, cheeseball," Tony laughed, "Sleep, sickly. You need to get better in case I get sick." He snuggled up to Steve, easily falling asleep.
"Yes, my little pygmy goat?" Tony laughed, still holding Peter in his lap, "What's got you excited, sweetheart?"
--!" Clint enthused, making a 'yum' noise. "No words. None at all."
"Bad," he grinned, pulling back.
Tony silently thanked Steve, leaning over to nuzzle at his arm before sitting back again.
"And me? What do you mean?"
Pete's cheeks flushed and he ducked his head shyly.
He looked around for something else to look at, spotting the tag on the man's scarf.
“Steve," Tony wheezed, laughing breathily, "Honey, Y'twice my weight, oh my god--"
Peter squealed in surprise, wiggling around in the blanket as Tony smooched him.
"Pete's already like me," Tony smiled softly, "He's my mini me. And then we can have a mini you. That, and there's no way in hell my sperm is leaving this house. I would die of embarrassment in that office."
Steve broke from his nostalgia and actually looked around, eyes meeting the genius standing in the corner. Tony had a grin on his lips, hands in his pockets, and was wearing a uniform similar to Steve's. All it missed were the pins and medals that adorned the soldier's own.
Steve looked at his roommate in a way that told him to explain. Steve was very confused right now.
Tony sighed and put a hand on his face.
Tony nodded. "I'll meet you up there," he kissed Steve's cheek, grabbing his favorite blanket before heading up the stairs, nesting himself down close to Steve's easel.
"I'm always careful," Tony laughed, kissing him back, "Be good for Papa, you two."
is what I didn't want to happen," Tony muttered, gently rubbing Steve's back, "It was a long time ago, Stevie. It's-- well, it's not alright, but I'm slightly better equipped to deal with it. Kinda. Not really."
Steve laughed softly at that, helping Bucky with the hammock.
, thank you very much Steven." Clint grumbled, hands on his hips matter-of-factly.
"The original thirteen colonies," Tony replied easily, "May I request your shirt first, Sir?"
"I'll tell you what." Tony said carefully, looking Steve in the eyes. "If you come to visit me here each day unless I say otherwise, I will show you and teach you about different human things. In return, I ask you about merman stuff and you satiate my curiosity. Deal?"
"I'm glad you asked." Tony hummed happily, standing from his workstool. "It measures the vibrations from your vocal chords and projects it almost like a voice box would normally. The way it sounds almost identical to your voice? It has to do with the vibrations as well." He explained.
"If you need anything, we're a phonecall away," Tony added, rolling his eyes at Bruce's glance, "Alright, alright. We're going. Jeeze."
Once Steve left the room, they all turned eyes to him expectantly.
Peter let out a shrieking giggle at the kisses, wriggling in Tony's arms. "Daaaaaddy! Quit!" He squeaked.
'Aye Aye, Sir.' Steve said, a playful salute and a smirk on his lips. 'Now go before you're late and Pepper fillets ya.'
"Jealousy doesn't look good on a seven year old," he laughed, "But we need to move the bassinet, and we can't exactly tell Sammy to play by himself while we do that, so..."
He grinned, moving his hands up to gently play with Steve's nipples. Steve purred gently at Tony's touch, trailing his hands along the other's sides and resting on his hips.
"Doing what?" He asked, gently stroking Steve's abdomen.
Steve hummed in thought for a moment as he tried for questions. "We'll start off simple; what did the thirteen stars stand for on the first America flag?"
"Ah-ah-ah!" Steve scolded, grabbing Tony's hand.
"Good trip?" He asked, not mentioning the very dark hickey on Steve's neck.
"Mmhm," Tony grumbled, reaching for the pillow, but getting too tired to try anymore, he dropped his hand, "What time is it?"
She smiled and shook his hand, tilting her head to the side.
"Never knew you had such an observant and wandering eye, Mr. Stark." He stated carefully.
Peter rolled his eyes at his fathers, finishing up his sandwich and eating on his carrots.
Steve gasped. "What a meanie." He teased lightly, leaning to smooch both Peter and Tony. "I won't let Daddy be mean to ya, munchkin."
A deep blush was present on the blond's cheek from his lover's words, feeling so damn grateful to have a man like Tony in his life.
Steve slept heavily for a good five hours before snuffling awake, breathing tiredly through his mouth.
“I know who you’re talking about, and I hate it.” Tony groaned, running his hand over his face in exasperation. “Why is it he’s the only one we can go to when weird shit like this happens? He’s kind of— scratch that, not ‘kind of’— is a dick.”
He shook his head, pinching his thigh before starting his spanking. Steve mewled softly when he started to be spanked, lowering his head at the slight sting.
All of it finally clicked in the soldier's mind. The room looking like the Stork Club, date night was Saturday, the note...
He continued this as he moved down, working deeply into Tony's lower back.
"Did I say it was Gwen?" Tony replied, laughing when the boy's face reddened.
"Just a little cleaning," he replied vaguely.
He shrugged, putting the lid on the cake pan and pushing it to the side of the counter.
"Mmm, love your sounds, Tony. Love hearing you moan from what I do. Love making you feel good--" he purred, making his thrusts harder and quicker with a soft groan.
"100 degrees F." He hummed, feeling Tony's face. "I'm calling Bucky over and taking you to the hospital. We can't have you sick or the baby
"Are you sure?" Steve asked softly, waiting as the phone rang. "You sure you'd be okay over there without us?"
Once the question clicked in his mind, Bucky nodded with a pleased smile on his face.
"And I definitely wanna talk about this business of potentially being a superhero." Clint chimed in. "I have some serious idea inputs for sure."
wearing this more often."
"Never expected you to be forward like this." He voiced quietly, face growing warmer against his wishes.
Steve looked over towards the woman, who smiled softly back at him. He then looked over to Tony who was close by, the brunet nodding back in assurance before going to sit nearby. The water spray on his hair surprised him at first, the blond soon settling under the warm spray. He may have made a small hum of contentment when the beautician started to wash and massage his scalp, because man did it feel good.
Steve grabbed the baby bag and then Sammy, swaddled up in his blanket as they headed to the door.
"And?" Tony grinned, trailing his hand down to Steve's abs. "It can wait."
He leaned down and smooched Peter's face before going to Sammy. "You be good and have fun too, okay Samwich?" Steve whispered with a smooch on the top of the baby's head. "Love you, boys."
Tony latched onto Steve, unaware of his erection pressing into Steve's side. He sighed happily, nuzzling at his neck. Steve blushed slightly, feeling Tony against him
Steve swam back home towards his secret little cavern, clutching tightly to his new souvenir and hoping no one would notice him. He quickly moved the rock covering the entrance and sneaked inside of his cavern. He was about to uncover his souvenir to study it closer, but stopped in his tracks as he heard someone clear their throat.
"But no one ever said it was my true love. My non-living, breathing, object love maybe. But not my true love." Steve grinned. "My true love is much more special."
"Would it be weird if I was your assistant? I don't even know the first thing of what to do." Steve asked curiously, being careful with his tone because damn. He usually didn't like other people fighting his battles for him, but Tony was hot when he was mad at other people like that.
Steve nodded as they walked into the kitchen, sitting down at the table with a sniffle. “Good. The sooner whatever this is is gone, the better. And a movie sounds great."
"You didn't do nothing, munchkin." Steve let Peter know. "Babies are just fussy real easy. He's just hungry. Plus he's still getting used to being in the outside world."
He crawled under Steve's arm and snuggled up to his chest, humming in content.
"Noooo that’s no fun." Steve whined playfully, rolling over carefully.
He opened the door, eyes comically widening at the disarray and disaster that used to be their living room; the tree was on the floor, garlands knocked down, and a suspicious face peeked out from the steps before darting back up.
"Yea, I know," he mumbled, picking at the buttons on Steve's shirt, "I jus' wish dat Sammy weren't so needy. I miss you an' Daddy."
." Tony grinned, stopping Steve once he got down to his boxers. "You're so gorgeous. I don't even know how I landed you. Like, really." He pushed Steve towards the bedroom, shutting that door closed.
Tony was quiet for a second before nodding, a soft smile on his lips.
He scribbled something on a purple notepad, tearing it off and handing it to Steve.
, Santy's been here an' we gots gifties!"
"Honey, I'm thinking you're forgetting I'm a billionaire. You never have to work again, if you don't want to," Tony replied gently, drawing circles onto Steve's chest, "But that's up to you. As soon as I get some stuff settled, we can go house looking. I know a place I've been looking at that's a bit out of the main city, big neighborhood, three story Tudor with a basement--"
"I'm sorry, Pete, but that's the way it is," he murmured, giving Steve a sad look, "We're gonna have to take your computer away for a little bit until we can help you get this under control, alright?"
Steve hazily rolled out of bed, off to give whoever was knocking on it a good what-for for waking him up around 3:00 AM. As he opened the door, Steve was surprised when he discovered this specific person at his door.
Steve gave the boy a soft smile, petting at his hair. "They're angels, baby. My daddy's been one since before I was born and my mommy's been one for eight years now."
Tony never broke focus from his machine.
"Wrench, screwdriver. That's pretty much it," Tony mumbled around a screw between his teeth, "Stupid thing comes
TW: talks of past self-harm/self-abuse
"There will be sleepless nights, no doubt about that, but you'll love him regardless." Sharon added. "May not seem like you will just yet, but it'll be there. And he'll love you back."
Steve gave an appreciative smile back, a light blush to his face. Tony did this just so they could still communicate. Who knows how long the man had been awake to make it.
Steve came back in with toast and tea for everyone, setting it on the coffee table. "Thank you guys for coming. It really means a lot right now."
"Peter will have someone he can hang out with and teach things to. At least when the baby gets older. And it'll have someone to look up to." Steve hummed happily in thought. "At least I hope. We never had siblings to know what it’s like to have siblings."
"Thank you, Steve," Sharon smiled, taking the bottle from him.
"Everyone else was well wide awake after a while and got a little antsy. So I brought you up to bed. It got late though, so they're asleep in the guest room now, I think. It’s a little before midnight, now." Steve explained all with a yawn.
Steve hummed in affirmation, glancing up at Tony then back at their boys. "As ready as I am able to be. We've got this." He assured confidently.
"That's adorable." Bucky chimed, finally getting away from the kitchen and bringing in the cookie tray for the others.
Tony sort of snorted in reply.
He ran his tongue along the underside a few times before sinking further, reaching down to cup Tony's balls carefully as he continued.
"No, no, life's not bad, I've-- I've never had a better family, but Steve, I have a photographic memory," Tony replied in a cracked voice, gently scooping up Peter and cuddling him close, hoping to soothe his anxiety, "I can tell every time-- every single thing that happened to me since I was five years old. I can tell you in
"If he still feels bad tomorrow, I'm taking him to the doctor." Steve sighed softly. "I have a feeling we are in for a long night with him. I hate seeing him so sick and miserable..."
"So now what? We just let him off the hook orrr," he asked Steve, voice low, "I mean, that explains why Sammy's been having trouble taking naps."
He hugged Tony back tightly, sniffling lightly against his shirt, but trying not to tear up. "'M sowwy, Daddy. Pwomise. I didn't mean ta hurt ya feelin's..."
"Steve? Are you... Look, I didn't do it to upset you. I swear I didn't, I--"
"Mhm,
"Hey Peter? Would you want to go over and spend the night Uncle Bucky and Natasha tonight?"
"I'm sure I'd like a surprise more." Steve grinned, picking out his clothes for the day. "I always prefer those surprises--" he purred, kissing Tony's cheek as he dressed.
"I must say, Rogers, you certainly are comfortable," Tony hummed, tucking his head under the blond's chin.
"....And in other breaking news, Weapons Designer Howard Stark and wife Maria Stark were involved in a combusted pile-up out on route 17. Authorities have not pulled a survivor from the pile up; though there has not been an official statement, it is obvious that no one could have lived through the blaze that engulfed the automobiles. Their son, Anthony Stark, is expected to take over the company---"
"Then you'll just have to stay in mine till I can get you a more comfy one," Tony replied, carefully stroking Steve's hair.
"Yeah! Dang right!" Bucky yelled, "Hand it over, Barton, merry Christmas to
"God, Steve, I've been so selfish, I can't-- fuck it, we're starting over, completely new-- we can get married again," Tony babbled, relaxing at Steve's bubbly laugh, "Yeah-- yeah, god, I love you, and I'm so sorry--"
Steve smiled softly to him as he got up. "All right. Guess I'll clean things up in here, then." He sighed wistfully, grabbing up the sheets.
"Nah. If it doesn't stop bleeding,
"I'm gettin' hungry anyway," Tony forced a smile, sitting down next to Pete, "Besides, the kid's too cute. Can't resist."
"Even
"Because you'll confuse him. He is at an impressionable age and he just might believe you." Steve pointed out, petting Peter's head as they watched SpongeBob.
"Mmhmmm," Tony hummed around his muffin, swallowing it, "Poor thing. We'll get you baby food soon, sweetie, just as soon as the Doc okays it."
He leaned down to capture Tony's lips, flicking his tongue gently at the seam of Tony's lips playfully.
Tony whined softly, gently nipping at Steve's neck. Steve hummed at the nips happily, wriggling under Tony slightly.
"Very well actually. The food coma has set in, so half of them are out and the other are relaxing." Steve whispered with a smile, heading toward his fellas. "That picture's gonna be my new background, by the way."
"Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. Who's passing out gifts?" Tony laughed, slipping down beside Steve.
Steve nodded. "Sure thing. Then we'll read to you, all right munchkin?"
"Lookit you, boy," he purred, taking Steve's legs and propping them up on the desk, "So nice and spread for me, hm?"
Steve ground back with a groan, his pants starting to get tighter. Not yet, though. Not yet. He moved down Tony's body, kissing at the bare skin until he faced the black lace. Steve brushed against the bulge lightly, tugging the panties down to free Tony's cock and start taking it into his mouth.
"I think he tried to stand up in his crib and fell over," he explained.
Steve chuckled after Tony, getting back in the car with a grin.
particular term of endearment from you around the kids.”
"I'm one thousand percent sure. I've thought about it, and I want him--or her-- to be partially you," Tony murmured, kissing Steve back, "Okay?"
"Uh huh, sure thing, kiddo," he teased.
Peter gasped and turned so he was back up against Steve, pouting at Tony.
"I won't block the bond," he mumbled, "But I don't want you getting all worked up, Stevie."
"Well, hot stuff, must be your lucky day. Actually, it's mine, considering I'm
detail, and-- and it's getting too much. I'm moving too fast, and I need to slow down."
"Show me." He asked, gazing up at Tony from where he was sitting. "If you show me somehow, I'll believe. And I'll keep my job with you."
Dummy whirred in a slightly disgusted sound, eliciting a laugh from Tony.
"Nope, nope," he gasped, heaving in a breath once he got off of Steve.
He went on to explain about how the teen got his powers, how he decided to become Spiderman, an eventually reached how he met up with Iron Man and Captain America.
"Kitchen? Work our way upstairs?" Tony suggested, "I put an order in for a king size bed and special delivery, so it should be here by tonight. We can go out and get sheets and stuff. Blankets."
"That is
He sniffled, rubbing his nose into the arm of his ducky jammies.
"I dunno." Purple Shirt shrugged. "He was hanging by the fence and then followed me over."
"Yep, can do," Tony whistled, nabbing his apron off a hook in the pantry.
Erin spoke matter-of-factly. A smile rose on her face.
He carried Sammy down with him outside of the workshop, Peter following behind. He knocked on the door and called gently.
-- and looking around quickly for the first aid kit.
"Peter, now that's enough." Steve spoke firmly. "You want us to treat you like a big boy, but you have to act like a big boy. It’s this how big boys act?" He asked the boy carefully.
Steve looked around to make sure nobody paid attention to his out burst. He continued the conversation in a more hushed tone.
Peter whipped his head around and spotted Steve, immediately snapping the book shut and tossing aside. He scooped Sammy up and climbed up into the hammock, hoping they were hidden from Steve.
Peter sighed and put his book down, reaching out for the baby. He settled Sammy on his chest, smooching the baby's cheek before starting to gently rock the hammock.
Tony yelped and rubbed his already sore ass, trooping down to the living room. He smooched Peter's forehead, gently tucking a blanket around the sleeping child before trudging back upstairs to his bathroom, more than happy to see Steve already in the steaming water. He stripped of his boxers again, sighing happily as he stepped into the warm spray.
haven't let yourself. Because you are better than the piece of shit I've heard Howard being."
Tony backed away from Steve for a second, grinning when the phone picked up.
"Steve," he groaned, tugging on his hair, "Please--"
That only made Peter cry more, because he knew he really was, and Daddy sounded so
"Oh please, Clint. You like to cuddle, too." Natasha smirked back at Clint's gasp.
"Clint!" Tony shouted, running out of the house towards the slightly taller blond. He jumped onto the man, not surprised that Clint swung him around before dumping him on his feet.
"Can I come up for snuggles?" He asked quietly.
"Maybe I like being in trouble, sir," Tony replied, blinking innocently at Steve, "Or I'm just a bad boy."
"Good. Good..." Steve hummed, running his hands along Tony's chest and bringing him into a kiss.
Tony smiled and bumped shoulders with Steve, raising his hand to knock on Peter's door.
"Hell yes." Steve said excitedly, padding over to the mattress with Tony. He stretched onto the blankets, curling into Tony and getting them comfortable, eyes raking over the other.
Steve leaned down to Peter's level, nodding gently. "While you get cleaned up, I'll go wrap it for you. And when you're done in the bath, I'll let you put on the name tag and the ribbon, okay?" He whispered back
you aren't." Steve said with an anxious laugh from the current surprise of what Peter found. "We are having Daddy up the security on your computer and internet. There are things out there that you do not need to stumble upon yet, Peter. As a punishment for you sneaking to find things."
Thank you for being so patient! Please continue to leave comments! :)
"Night, Peter. Sleep tight." Steve said softly, settling with his boys. He got comfortable and let his eyes droop until they closed, falling into a deep and comfortable sleep.
He smiled and ran the pad of his thumb over Steve's bottom lip, ghosting his fingertips over the darkening shade.
Iron Man, right? Actually, that suit looks pretty buildable. I don't know if iron would be the best choice, though. I'd go with a titanium alloy of some sorts. More aerodynamic."
"Yeah, yeah, aspirin," he wheezed, laughing into his pillow, "God, Steve. Wish I could fuck you into oblivion like that."
He waited for Steve to walk off toward the kitchen before scurrying by, hiding the gift under his bed. With his penguin still clutched to chest, Peter toddled back down to the kitchen, walking in on his dads kissing.
"Tooonnneeeee" Steve whined back playfully, finally uncovering his prize with his teeth. "Just playing a bit, darlin'." He grinned, mouthing gently at the tip of Tony's cock before taking him in.
"Nope. Not yet." Tony smirked, tapping Steve's chin away from his leg. "If you behave today, I'll show you. But you have to be on best behavior," He teased, ruffling Steve's hair.
Peter sipped at his coffee, going to lay back down in front of his math.
Steve could hear Tony coming down the stairs as he usually did right after he turned on the coffee pot, turning to kiss his husband's lips happily.
"You make it sound like I'm a piece of meat." Steve said with a slight smirk, working on washing himself down. "Now I have to be careful cleaning myself because someone made things sensitive."
She squeezed his hand, giving him a fond smile.
"I know
"So you enjoy your spankings?" Tony teased, "You're such a naughty boy, Stevie. Bet your boyfriend loves it."
Steve hummed appreciatively at that, running a hand down Tony's back.  "That's a good pet, love." He smiled softly, reaching around to Tony's front. "Now, stay behaved, and I'll show you why you need not touch yourself."
"Hey, I'm not gonna pluck. I just wanted to feel." He admitted. "I won't if you don't want me to."
Tony just shrugged, walking out of Steve's arm length.
The brunet held a hand carefully to his chest over the arc reactor, letting out a breath of relief that he didn't know he'd been holding. He did however notice the look on Steve's face drop a bit, embarrassment on the blond's features.
"Ste--" Tony shrieked in laughter, trying to wriggle away from the stronger man.
He sat at the head of the table, groaning as they started to chorus
It took Tony a second before he had to suppress a sputter.
"I am doing nothing of the sort. I am simply reading the spaces in no particular order." Steve explained, quirking a brow at the other. "Now then, are we yet to the point of you tell me what you know of our case?"
"Yeah, yeah." Steve said with a smirk, kissing Tony's cheek as they walked back to the house. "What all do you want to start unpacking first?"
"Your dad works here?" Steve asked curiously.
I promise I didn't take another few year hiatus from the story! X,D
"--it's hard to be strong for Peter, when I can barely be strong for myself," he whispered.
Steve kissed Tony's lips softly with a happy hum. "I'm excited too, you have no idea. But it’s not certain the baby will completely be a mini-me." He sighed. "But I can't wait to have all that again. And some things we haven't gotten to do yet. It'll be so great."
Steve drifted off into a light sleep soon after, enjoying the comfort Tony always gives him.
"Hey, Sharon," Tony murmured, going over to brush a sweaty bang back, "Hangin' in there?"
"The reaction is there, and if its not taken care of it can be really uncomfortable. And I don't want you to have to feel that, y'know? Wanna keep you feeling good." Tony continued. "So I'll need to help you get through it, show you how to handle it, but its usually a private or intimate thing, like I said. So it'll be sort of embarrassing, honestly."
"Tony, that's great!" Natasha said happily. "You guys get to have a baby."
"You lived that close and what made you finally meet was a mistake in the post?" Peggy said, surprised.
me?!"
"Mmm. I have coconut balm you should use," Tony murmured, a smirk tugging on his lips, "There's other ways to keep them from getting dry, though."
"Sit," he pointed at the hammock, dragging over the boy's desk chair to sit down in.
"Yeah, well I used to not be. In fact, I was completely confused when I got my tattoo." He replied, glancing down at Tony. "I was so skinny and short, it was terrible. Then my tattoo appeared and I couldn't think why anyone would call me handsome. Thankfully, puberty eventually contributed." He chuckled soft.
"He probably thought Tony needed to actually talk to someone and that you needed to get laid." Clint said bluntly, Natasha smacking him as he took a drink.
"All right, all right. C'mon guys. Breakfast." Steve stated, calling everyone to the kitchen. "The sooner we eat, the sooner we'll get the show on the road."
Tony nodded in understanding, a small smile back down at the merman as he continued his touches.
Tony chuckled at that, standing up to put his and Peter's plates in the dishwasher.
He shifted slightly so he could reach down to pump Steve in time with his thrusts.
Steve huffed a small chuckle. "Your feeling is correct, kiddo. See, Daddy and I are something call soulmates. And that basically means that before we were even born, the universe made us perfect just for each other. It’s a strong bond that nothing else compares to." He explained.
"What you liked or didn't like, other things you want to try," Tony hummed, leaning up on his elbows.
"I know you don't, bambi, but I
"I feel pretty lucky myself." He continued. "An amazing husband, two incredible sons; I couldn't ask for more."
," he whined, hopping off his chair to pad over to the sink anyway.
Tony groaned loudly, gasping as pain and pleasure skyrocketed up his spine; his breath was short, but he managed to whine at Steve, turning his head to nip at the pulse on Steve's neck.
"And what do we do art on if we wanna draw or paint?" Steve asked the boy.
Steve gave him a slight look, giving him a pair of his puppy dog eyes.
"Hey there, gorgeous," he purred, nipping Tony's earlobe.
"Hey. Bruce Banner." the man introduced himself in a mellow tone of voice.
He flicked it undone, slowly snaking it out of his belt loops before flicking it against his own leg, gasping and moaning at the tingle of pain and pleasure.
He stroked a hand over his goatee, taking another puff before nodding.
Howard pointed to the chair directly in front of his desk.
Hung upside down from the ceiling in a tangle of cords, the engineer grinned sheepishly, still trying to kick off his rocket boots.
"Of course. I'll go build us all up a big blanket nest in there, I guess." Steve hummed, going towards the guest room to get things started.
Once the redness had dulled, Steve had reached over to grab lube from the drawer, slicking up his fingers and prodding one at Tony's entrance.
He grinned and leaned up on his elbows, running the pads of his fingers over Steve's chest.
"Aw, Tony." Steve said with a warm chuckle, wiping at the tears at the corners of his husband's eyes. "It's going to be a step up from what we had to do with Peter, but we will be damn
He shifted a bit and groaned slightly, feeling the trickle increase.
It took him a few minutes, but Peter eventually wore himself out, slumping tiredly against Steve's chest with small hiccups. "I feel bettah," he mumbled, wiping his nose on Steve's shirt.
Tonight may be his second shift, but Steve could already tell tonight would be a long night.
"Noooo!" Peter pounded his tiny fists on Steve's back, trying to wiggle off.
"Right. Cuz dere's ladies in da house." The boy stated simply, wriggling into his shark pajamas with a hum. "I was just 'cited cuz I love 'seppe's pizza.".
"He's so affectionate," Tony hummed, breaking off soft bits of the muffin to feed Sammy, "And he likes chewy muffin."
Tony looked to Steve, the other's blue eyes staring at him wide in askance from under the sheets. With these sort of things, Tony was used to either himself leaving soon after or his partners leaving. It wasn't normal for his partners to ask him to stay. Granted, this wasn't just any old fling, this was Steve. And they technically were going to be starting to date each other, so staying would be normal. Besides, Tony wasn't going to deny that he missed having a body next to him since he and Pepper had split. So maybe this would be a good thing.
Tony made a raspberry noise with his mouth and waved off Steve's remark.
"Oooh, make me baby," Tony grinned, "You know I like it when you make me."
"M'wittle enough," Peter grumbled, hunkering down next to Steve, "Daddy, m'
Tony rolled his eyes heavenward, smiling at Steve's giggle.
Steve knocked softly on the bathroom door, having set the cookies on the nightstand before.
"He's been on Clint, and I used to fantasize over
"Bludgeoned? My, that is always a terrible way to go..." Steve murmured solemnly.
"I can see you limping," Tony pointed out, grabbing one of Steve's hoodies and throwing it on as a second thought, "But if you don't feel good, we don't have to do that anymore."
Tony wrung his hands and bowed his head, fingering his wedding ring. He opened his mouth to continue when tiny sobs were heard, not from him or Steve.
"Five
"I know," Tony replied cheekily, giving Steve a cheesy grin.
He motioned his head towards the erection still between Steve's legs, reaching over to gently take Steve's hand in his.
Tony leaned up to capture Steve's lips, stilling his fingers in Steve.
Tony quickly smooched Steve back before heading to his car, driving the few short blocks to Bucky, Natasha, and Clint's apartment. He quickly walked up to the door, not surprised to find it unlocked.
"Silly." Steve said with a small grin.
"He's gonna be such a good brother," Tony murmured, smooching the skin behind Steve's ear, "He'll be a good babysitter when he's older, too."
"She's gorgeous, Steve. I've always wanted to ride a bike with a hot man," Tony grinned, sliding on behind Steve, "Come on, come on. I'm hungry and I wish I could have you."
Steve raised a brow and turned back to the eggs. "I'm not sure what of the things he just did makes him like me."
"When do you plan on telling us the situation that led to our little pow-wow here? Because I'm sure we all would like to know what led our friend- or I could even go to say brother, we've been that close- to having to see a therapist so suddenly. The 'incident' that led to it."
Tony looked up at Steve, an unbelievable smile on his face.
"I was, but he didn't, so shush," Tony hummed, tucking Steve back in his pajamas before crawling back up. "And that's just
"You believe me yet, kid?" He breathed, shucking his own shirt aside and stepping out of his jeans, "Or y'still need convincing?"
"You're alright, it's just--" Tony closed his eyes for a second, waiting for the dizzy spell to pass. "We
“Alright, cheeseball," Tony laughed, turning his head to kiss Steve's cheek, "You better go back to your place and get ready. It's bad luck to see the dateé right before the date."
"You do that just by being with me.". Steve rubbed along Tony's back, feeling the man shake slightly as he did.
, really, we didn't hurt anyone--"
"Take him with you, will you? Just in case it gets serious, I don't want him to get upset," Tony murmured, helping Steve to his feet, "Call us when dinner's ready?"
"Thank you so much for this.".
"But?" Tony asked, raising a brow.
"Love gettin' all pretty for you, babe," Tony purred, ripping Steve's boxers off, "Love your cock in my ass, fillin' me up--" He gathered the precome from his own cock to open himself up, gasping and whining as he sunk down onto Steve.
Steve blinked at him for a split second. First he takes the lead being all angry, then he totally flips it? Didn't make much sense to him sometimes, but that's how Tony operated. He used one hand to pin Tony's arms above his head as he worked at the man's jawline. His other hand slipped under Tony's shirt to play with the nipple rings gently.
"Looks okay. A bit nauseous, but that's expected," Tony murmured, picking up his cup, "We're in for a long night, though. Especially if he throws up on the bed."
He grinned, tugging Steve out of Sammy's nursery and back to their own room, fingers slipping up into his shirt.
Peter squirmed out of Tony's arms and handed him the penguin, dashing off the find their bag of goodies. He returned with the hammerhead shark plushie in his hands, exchanging it for the penguin.
"Oh my god," Tony rolled his eyes heavenward, shaking his head, "I regret showing you that movie, I regret Bucky
"Tony, you're looking at me like a hungry shark. How else am I supposed to look?" Steve admitted, noticing an embarrassed expression quickly flash passed in the brunet's eyes.
"Dork. I love you though..." He whispered sweetly. Steve continued to pet at his hair, staying beside and later dozing off.
"I wanna make him happy," Tony murmured, "I wanna be able to do what Howard never did."
"At least I know who the favorite is," he teased, handing Peter a sponge.
Tony swallowed his sobs, worming into Steve's warmth. He whimpered softly, acid-like guilt making his cuts throb on his legs.
The baby babbled at Steve, squeezing the blond's fingers with a squeal of delight.
doing up so early, munchkin?"
“Ooh, you turn me on, Stevie," Tony growled, nibbling on the blond's neck, "Let's go see this movie before I jump you in the parking lot."
"I love you," he murmured, kissing down Steve's neck.
"God, I hope not. I think he'll be to over the moon over what I installed to be mad," Tony grinned, "You get to wait for that surprise, too. It's pretty cool."
Nodding, Tony finished looking over the packet, satisfied with the fine print. He signed his name at the appropriate areas, putting the final tick on
times, but that was willingly."
"Well I'd hate to step on your feet. I could take them clean off, and you need every height advantage you can get, babe." He teased playfully, earning him a smack in the arm.
Peter gasped and nodded, happy to look back at the little fluff balls waddling around.
"Yep," Tony hummed, sitting down in Steve's lap, "They aren't giving you trouble, are they?" "Nuh-uh!" Peter replied haughtily, "M'bein' perfect."
"Why not? Does it embarrass you? Then I think I'll say that as often as I can." He teased, mouthing at Tony's collarbone.
Peter made a disgusted face, quickly retracting his hand from Sammy.
"Oh bubba..." Steve said sympathetically. He sat on the bed (thankfully Peter hadn't thrown up on there), rubbing the boy's back gently.
"You know he'll still gravitate towards them." The other said more as a statement than a question.
"Mhmmmm. If so, I'll have to give you harder questions next time," Tony grinned.
, it’s so dumb. I don't even
Tony beamed up at Steve, rocking on his heels.
"But?" Steve echoed "But I find human stuff... interesting. So different than what I am used to. It floats down sometimes and I collect it and just... I find joy and peace in it, y'know?"
"Love you, Daddy." Peter said softly, leaning in the touch. "Love you too, Papa." He added gently, looking up at Steve.
, let alone reply to Steve. Instead, he flopped his head down onto Steve's shoulder, clawing at his back to try and get purchase.
Tony glanced up at the man, shifting minutely closer to Steve.
"It would be too simple to take an
"I texted Pep to make the arrangements that she's been nagging me to make," Tony looked over at Clint, eyes slightly distant, "I couldn't-- I didn't want to be a burden on anyone else. I was already putting a lot on Steve with my insane mood swings."
