Deciding no for the former, and yes for the latter, Steve wiggled into thick wool of the uniform. It was a much tighter fit than he had expected, having lost some of the bulk required to carry the 60-pound equipment. He trailed down with his fingers the row of golden buttons.
“Neither can he, but to compensate, I am offering some supplementary assistance. Twenty years ago, I constructed a vest, shot and ball proof, so that people are enabled to return fire. It was miles away from Stark’s technology. Then the war started and suddenly the one thing that mattered was to find more and more intricate ways to kill and harm each other. It appeared the world was not ready.”
At the valley’s far mouth, opened a view of a limestone French château, almost out of place with its grandeur in the middle of nothing. Its walls were so dazzlingly white reflecting the sun rising behind their backs that Steve’s eyes all but begun to water just regarding it. At a wooden sign, Steve looked at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read:
They pressed on. If the men did see them, catching movement while wiping their stained foreheads on their sleeve, they turned their heads away. The room narrowed into a corridor and the noise quieted with each step added between, until they ran into a yellow, heavy-duty door, which had a very familiar name … it was the entrance to Sector 16.
Steve looked away, rubbing at his chest. Resentment and hopelessness battled inside him, fighting for their place on his face. Steve wanted the truth; why was it so hard to come by?
“Well, put it on.” Tony’s hands were suddenly warm upon Steve’s. “Gotta claim my man—there’s no doubt been lots of interest back home.”
The dog streaked away: nails scratched on polished parquet, her barks bounced off the walls and windows, and soon she had disappeared around the corner.
“What a curious coincidence,” said Clint, who, Steve couldn’t help but observe, looked to be rather enjoying himself.
When he ran his thumb around the scar on his back, which Steve knew to be matching the one he had at his front, at first touch, Tony tensed but eventually relaxed into—and within half an hour, the familiar slight snores were heard, but Steve felt wide awake—wide awake and worried.
“Does that really help you focus?” he asked, looking doubtful. Tony had a sudden suspicion he may have been there, watching him, for a while.
Trashing, suffocating, Tony clawed at the arm at his throat; it was pressing his bowtie into his windpipe, a ball of silky fabric that did not feel so soft anymore, inches from crushing his airway, and his brain was flooding with white-hot light, all perception waning: his erratic heartbeat drowned, distant shouting, everything fading…
“Steel,” Fury sneered. “It’s like they’ve forgotten that our best metalworker is missing in action.”
Somehow, this show of pride served as a point in his favour, instead of a point of irritation to Tony. It was, perhaps, the fact that despite all his poise, he had a fault.
It smelled of freshly cut roses, damp soil and the perfume of the woman bustling from the counter to a confused customer and back. As he took a step in, a head popped up from behind the assortment of bouquets.
They thus carried four chairs to his bedside in one of the holding cells and positioned themselves comfortably. Steve hesitated to give him Tony’s photo—if this was to protect himself or Jarvis, Steve did not care to explore.
“So, this is a test?” Steve asked, and thought of stubby Ms. Althea being a secret agent. “Are all of the town in on this?”
“No, the town’s. Apparently, I’m likely to go on a murder spree when unrestrained,” he said, and witnessed Rhodey’s face darken as Tony retold the story of the past forty-eight hours he had already recounted what felt like a hundred times to Jarvis, to the Constables and to Inspector Rogers.
On their right side, Coulson seemed to be attempting to bang his club through his mahogany dais. The questions came to an end after that, and the man was, by common vote, found guilty. By Strucker’s last parting look as he slunk back to his seat, though, Steve figured getting the man free had never been his goal. A man sitting at the back, leaned forward, as the conversation roused, to say something to the front before, who said something to the rows before that, the news spreading like wildfire. A man got up, left. A second gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.
Unbidden, a smile tugged at the corners of Steve’s mouth. He felt played, but he didn’t feel sore about it.
It was all on the table now. Maybe that was better. Steve didn’t do well with ambiguous communication. He would rather know the score.
“We—we have a lead?” asked Steve, hardly able to stop the hope swelling inside his chest like a balloon.
“You can’t just pick a fight with them about the treatment of their property after we just shot said property,” Bucky said with painful restraint.
“That’s different,” Tony said quickly, and when Steve looked at him blankly, he went on: “You don’t know when to stop. And I care about you too much.”
“Our tickets around this factory,” told Clint, shimmying his hips inside the leather apron and worn jeans. “Like it?”
Steve acknowledged they had all been extremely lucky: Sam had been clipped by a shot across his back that nicked one shoulder blade; Scott had also been grazed by a bullet; Natasha’s worst injury was a buckshot that had shred three holes through her hat’s crown. The worst of them, discounting Tony, remained Bucky, who, rather airily, proclaimed he finally had something show off to the ladies back in town, should they finally warm up to him. Cheered by this visible recovery, Steve felt he would not be missed and sat up, brushing at his creased pants.
“We are a bit bigger than some private snoop. The government is part of us, and we are part of the government.” Fury set onto Steve’s lap a stack of papers, on which Steve discovered the mysterious eagled logo.
He cradled Tony’s face in his hands, feeling the familiar prickling of facial hair under his thumbs as he moved them over his face, then down his arms, across his chest. Here, his hands met something hard, cold and unforgiving; was he chained after all?
With that, he took the thief by the armpit. He stomped off, the dumbfounded rustler struggling in his hold, his boots digging grooves into the dry street in their wake.
Still smiling, Coulson had dismissed Steve with a cheerful goodbye, and turned to his desk to finish some more papers piled there. Steve had stood outside his office afterwards, quite motionless, and swore he would never, as long as he worked there, become a disappointment in the face of such open admiration.
Tiberius gave a rather mirthless chuckle and choked slightly on his next drag. “Takes one to know one, sweetheart.”
“Maybe,” suggested Tony, “he realized last time he only needs to graze someone’s temple to have everyone jump at the chance to tie the noose themselves?”
Steve took several embarrassed steps back from Tony, feeling his face heat up. There were now two very awkward men facing each other.
Steve quieted. Tony was starting to think that Steve found his modesty suspicious; he was prodding at it, as if to find something lurking beneath.
He made to kneel before the rustler, who looked very reluctant to be showcased as proof and was looking around, hoping somebody would intervene.
He did not think much about the request as they wound their way through the hedges and beds to emerge in a part of the property where the trees grew wilder, denser, less nurtured. Even if he had, he would have not come up with the answer. It was so unlikely that it simply didn’t occur to him — until he saw it with his own eyes: there on the muddy, leaf-strewn ground was a line of round impressions.
He had probably meant it as a mood-lightener, but the statement fell flat for Steve, whose gaze brushed, in self-hatred, over all the sharper than usual angles of Tony.
“That was a confidential conversation,” said Happy, sounding slightly upset. “I felt mean just voicing it—blimey!”
Steve and Scott jogged back to the horses. The black, gleaming locomotive pulling up looked much taller from where Steve now stood than it had when he’d been glancing at its approach from afar. As tall as two of him, it came to a rest with a chest-rattling grinding of its horse-sized wheels.
Tony didn’t like the idea of Rhodey knowing that he, Tony Stark, was getting jumpy about a little conflict. Rhodey would fuss worse than Jarvis, and he didn’t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his bruises.
Tony slumped against the foot of the stairs, breathing hard. Bitterly, Stane let the gun clatter to the ground. To preserve his dignity, he straightened up laboriously under Steve’s judging eye.
“Tony represented much to you that you had not known before. But,” said Bucky, and with every word, he jabbed the star on Steve’s chest; pressing down so hard Steve feared its points were going to imprint on his skin, “… you ought to relax your self-criticism in favor of your mental state.”
“The explosion was—not scaled. It tore through everything. The carriage shaft was found a hundred-and-fifty feet from the site of the accident. It had pierced trough the two walls of the carriage. There—there was blood on it. No one could tell whose—”
“Didn’t Tony break into that to steal the designs on our gas-fueled lamps for his pet project?” he asked slyly, disregarding Steve’s look that plainly said ‘you’re pushing your luck’, a feeling apparently shared by Sam, who shuffled his feet as though quite eager to put a bit of distance between himself and Clint.
“I’m thorough, not desperate. What kind of man goes to such lengths to frame you, have you tried and hanged. First for one, then for two. Now, for a
“There’s nothing to forgive. Look,” he said at Steve’s no doubt constipated expression, “let’s just agree to disagree, all right?”
Nobody noticed their return to the horses; the factory had emptied itself. The six of them rushed quickly though the echoing halls, but by the time they gained the street, Stane had disappeared just as quickly as Tony.
But Tony … Tony would have solved these murders, Steve knew. Tony would have known who had shot them and why because Tony always had the answers; he had fixed guns, gas lamps, built amazing things from scrap in his forge … but Tony, like the forge, was gone…
Over on the other seats, three heads turned, but Steve did not meet their looks, nor could he think of anything else to say except, “There, uh, is a scar.”
“Not when I’m the only one skilled enough to do these things. I feel—I feel this is what I was meant to do—there’s things that just need to be done. What I need is to build a suit of armor around us.”
“It was war, Tony. It has always been fought with weapons.” Steve looked down at his lap, where his own hands looked large but clean. “Your hands are no dirtier than that of those who wielded them.”
Everything was chaos: the screams of the occasional onlooker mixed with the grunts and shouts of the scuffle; Steve jumped over the unconscious forms of men he didn’t stay to identify, someone’s fallen glasses crunched under his boot, and suddenly, a patch of red seeping over the chest of the man he was just about to hit—and Steve, following its trajectory with his astonished gaze, saw a black shape on the rooftop nearby, rifle braced against a hunched shoulder. Clint, thought Steve, with a rush of relief. Panting, he pushed himself away from the shot men, and ran, hard, to the shadows of the next building over, looking out for Tony. Here, he heard something in the street running parallel to him which made him slow down.
In front of him, Tony noted with satisfaction the at once unnerved air about Inspector Rogers as the tinny voice of the Superintended went on through the round earpiece, harried in the way one was when squeezed between a rock and a hard place: attempting to please two important members of the gentry at the same time;  the principal magistrate of the district, whose dead son had just been extracted from Tony’s Persian rug; and the son of the generous patron of the police department, and whom they very much wished to hold onto the tradition.
Tony had forgotten all about his soreness; the lucky placement of the hand only increased the impression of sensuality the unfortunate position gave, and despite himself, Tony felt the first hardening between his legs, under the shifting fabric, as he straightened when the hold was hastily released.
He then glanced at Rhodey, half-hopeful he might soften at this small instance of humour, but his eyes remained focused on the solicitor now fretting with a crisply white envelope. When Murdoc spoke again, his tone changed.
The Town Court echoed with voices as Steve made his way past its icy windows; winter was approaching fast. People unwrapped themselves from their protective layers as they sought for seats among the six rows of spectator seating, which faced the ungated judge’s dais, flanked by the witness table and the jury. Large groups of women tended to converge along the middle aisle, chattering excitedly, which caused blockages on Steve’s way to his seat among the witnesses; fortunately, however, very little people had gathered by the drafty windows, so that Steve was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate his way along the left wall.
“There you are,” sighed Sam. There was a sheen of sweat gleaming on his features. “Better call Doc to check that hand of yours.”
“Avoid touching it—guess that’s the least I can hope for, given your profession.” He stirred his tea. “You know, modern medicine is headed to being less about the
“Remember that time Pym called Tony a second-rate engineer?” Bucky said. “Is this a payback? They were just moving cattle to higher ground. They couldn’t have told you some were missing. It’s a big fuss given the sheer volume of animals you need to transfer from one place to another. There’s obviously been a small theft they’ve just noticed during their fall inspection—”
The others had apparently reached the ends of their letters some time ago and listened in. Fury glowered before turning his back on them.
“I’m trying to say,” Steve spoke very calmly, “that I fear we’re dealing with someone who’s motives are far more concealed. Whatever happened in Hammer Hall, and whoever attacked the son, they did not have time to finish it … not with all of you present…”
Awkwardly, Tony’s hands not releasing their grip, Jarvis reached out a hand to trail a finger down Tony’s cheek.
There was a warning there. A request to let it go, yet Steve couldn’t. “I thought we told each other everything,” he said.
Steve had lost count of the time, but the sky showed no sign of daybreak when they arrived at his house, hands groping for the switch Tony had taught him to light their new lamp with—only, after clicking it several times on and off, on and off, the room remained unlit.
“Sam,” Steve warned; he hated the idea they were all imagining him to have some special power to match his repute.
Mr. Stone walked slowly around Obie to come to a stop next to Tony, looking down at Hammer’s unconscious form. Obie’s voice seemed to echo as if coming through a significant distance — instead of merely ten feet.
Steve’s insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell them the truth. They would find soon enough, too soon… He toed off a day-old chunk of caked mud from the side of his boot to avoid answering. In the corner of his vision, he saw the two share a long glance.
Steve suppressed a wave of disappointment, for he granted his expectations had been too high; these were things Tony had kept from him as well.
Obie hesitated — but recognized the dismissal. He lifted up both his hands in a placating gesture, eyeing Tony in somewhat calculating fashion, before saying, “Hurry back home, all right? You’re looking peaky … are you sure you slept this morning? Go to bed, I’ll handle this.”
“This,” he explained with the patience of the truly suffering, “is me taking charge of my life. Turning a new page, and so forth, and so forth. Starting with going through the stuff. I considered selling the place — would have — if it wasn’t for moving—” He hesitated. “Mum wanted to be here. Close to her roots, to dad’s great displeasure.”
Tony saw everything as though it was a very vivid, highly detailed dream. There were dozens of faces staring at him from the sides of the rooms with grim, avenged faces. They were making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Tony could not listen. He seemed to be sensing all of it as though through a transparent sheet, like a heat haze, which caused the rooms and the people in them swim strangely…
“Your wife?” said Steve at once, reaching into his pocket while staring avidly at the gardener. “What’s her name?”
Steve still had not seen his chest. The bulb was gone, and so were the wires—several feet of thin metal tubes snaking up and down his arms—they removed before surgery at the hospital. Steve could see little red marks left by them on Tony’s exposed forearms. Though, catching Steve’s look Tony, perhaps accidentally, shifted them away.
“As I said, before I retired to bed at nine, I saw Mr. Stark leave to the cellar, where I presume he stayed, up until he was seen in the hall by a housemaid at four thirty in the morning.”
“I do, sir. But, with all due respect,” Steve said, “I still don’t see how we could possibly find something that these …
Dispirited, Steve chugged back the rest of his tea, now bitter and lukewarm. The familiar feeling of unease was back in his stomach. He had been so sure answers would have alleviated his worries rather than increasing them.
Tony crumbled the leaf to shreds in his fist, walked up to Rhodey and placed a hand, cautiously, on the small of his back. He took it as a good sign the body underneath was not shaking.
Steve was on the main street, where people were just starting to gather with pails, standing between Sam and Bucky, who had tied his wet pillowslip tight around the lower half of his face. There were smudges of black soot where his eyes were uncovered. They looked furious.
“Oh, I’ve heard all right,” replied Obie. “I’ve busted my back day and night to keep it from spreading beyond the society pages. Why do you think the Hammers got Reed? By skill?” He scoffed and his eyes fell into the corner by the door. “Nice toy.”
“With your permission, sir,” Steve said, slipping into parade rest, “I’d like a leave of absence to take care of a personal matter.”
Creeping after Jarvis and Steve’s steps, Tony found the console table and, subsequently, the landline vacant. However, next to them, the dining room door stood ajar and through it, Tony could hear steady clicking … typing.
As the weeks had crept on, Steve could not help but notice, even through the haze of his new misery, that Bucky seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having put Steve through the torturous night of dance; perhaps because of Steve’s descent into torpidity stimulated his dormant knack for leadership, Bucky was now the one at the head of investigation.
“Believe what you want,” said Pym shrewdly, “but it would be no good when the people firing at you would be wearing the very same vest. Oh, yes,” he said, taking great pleasure in their expressions. “Howard Stark wanted to mass-produce it. That was the day I gave up on humanity and retreated here with my—with my family.”
Ross had been one of the men he had stumbled into during all the stiff, decorative formalities that had followed his obtaining the medal for valor. As a former Senator and a Republican, he had been very vocal about advanced social justice. Had he angered the wrong people?
Tony did, though whatever had made that noise—whatever was hidden under his shirtsleeves—evidently made his movements clunky and jerky. Supporting himself on the side of a house, then on a lamp, he proceeded uphill while Stane kept up a constant stream of verbal abuse.
Whatever Roger’s answer to that might have been, Tony did not hear it, for at that exact moment, the telephone rang. Rogers startled; a bit of tea drippled onto his dish.
Steve snapped out of his despair as quickly as he had let it take him, and came to, clutching the wooden support of the porch. Bruce had snuck up to his side and was carrying a bag of groceries.
“Should complete the set nicely, then,” Steve said but broke off with a curse: Bruce had just poured alcohol into the cut, which, stung and shocked him.
“A Mr. Rhodes called upon you while you were asleep, sir,” said Jarvis, and before Tony could swallow his enormous bite, he went on with, “He told me to tell you he is glad you are no longer stretching the limits of human endurance, but would appreciate if you also remembered to take equal care of your friendships.”
A flurry of exclamations rose from the hall they had left behind where, judging from the shouts, they had just been told the town hadn’t got the money to build a modern steel bridge, and wouldn’t receive any help from near towns.
“Look,” said Fury, “I do feel obliged to try and save your life since you are so determined to risk it. And I think, at this point, it may have come to your attention that something’s a bit fishy here.” Fury gestured at the chair next to Clint. “Have a seat.”
“It seems a little, ‘all is well, look how much we have to be thankful for.’ During the war, it was to distract us from the rising body count. Now, who knows. Genocide?”
“Everyone knows the household routine. It’s been the same for thirty years now. Jarvis is pedantic like that.”
The man lived up to his letter, seeming large and commanding in his bowler hat and broad-collared coat as he prowled along the passage like a caged wild cat, sucking on a fat cigar. A sudden turn obstructed him from Steve’s visual by another walkway, and Steve could not see what was going on above him. He tilted his head back, trying to see…
“Sorry, sir,” he apologized. “I just couldn’t help but notice today was far more fruitful for you than it was for us.”
“It’s late,” Steve said instead. “I should leave.” Tony’s eyes snapped to meet his. “I’ll be back tomorrow.”
“We—” Steve begun, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter: Tony strutted forward, one hand in a pocket, one gesturing airily as he spoke.
Steve scowled and took off his hat. He placed it over Tony, shielding his face from the others’ gazes. Beside Steve, Tony twitched again.
In the following silence, they circled each other. And for a moment, Steve saw Tony’s face, looking at Stane with hatred that could burn a lesser man, and Steve finally understood what Jarvis had meant by a severely set mouth.
Tony listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half expecting to hear the creak of a window, or the drag of a body on tiled floor? And then he jumped slightly as the door to the cellar opened.
It was just before dusk that they reached a cabin by the tracks and settled for the night, and by then their shoulders and hat brims were wet with fresh snow.
The result was instant; Rogers’ serious countenance gave away to something young and foreign on a face like his, and as Tony reflected on this, the wide-eyed look deepened into a blush that bloomed across Roger’s cheeks, his ears and, at length, down his throat.
That was hours ago. It only served to make Steve more uneasy. What if they were mistaken? Was Tony in the forge after all, beyond their help? If not, where had he gone? Not home. The saloons? Should he ask Natasha if Tony had taken a room there? Or, thought Steve, recalling Tony’s presence at dinner, would he more likely be housed at Thor’s?
He thought of the trip he had turned down. Was Tony hurt by it? Would his boredom overcome their relationship completely, given time?
Tony’s warm brown eyes were boring into Steve’s, who met his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he might find there, unsaid—
All at once, Stark Industries appeared—not as a structure seen from far, but a mammoth, emerging behind another factory. It’s vast Victorian red-brick façade covered almost two city blocks on its own. Above this, in the immensity of the towering structure, it was all ambition, competition, domination, even lust—for size, power and, always, money.
“The man arrived at Julesburg by rail today," Bucky panted. "Happy has gone to pick him up in his stage right now. It’s gonna take a week, though ... lots of stagecoach stopovers on the way, the guy is apparently in bad shape…”
“I think we’re done here today. Sorry if we’ve reminded you of things you’d rather forget,” he said, drawing back his seat and rising to his feet. “You must be tired. We’ve put you up at the saloon.”
Tony glanced back repeatedly at the landing, half-expecting to find a bank of Police-Constables stomping up the stairs to arrest him. Tony, who did not feel as carefree as he had pretended when reassuring Jarvis to call the police, was silent in his observing of the crowded drive. A Constable and Doctor Banner had pulled up minutes ago, tailed by another black car bearing a plain-clothed man with a camera, and an ambulance.
“I’m not dead?” Tony finished astutely. “Don’t look at me like that—like I’m a … supreme human. It was luck, a mad stroke of luck, a second chance at life. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t escape unscratched—” his fingers stilled on his chest “—I had my fair share of health problems, but … there was a man.”
“Has it really been so long,” said a voice that was most familiar, “that you no longer recognize a friend.”
“Aren’t they all, open carry is legal. But a Sharp’s carbine, though. What do you think? Our quota for weapon thieves is thirty-one this year, Coulson’s about to sprain a wrist.”
Somewhere behind Scott, a hand raised and waved energetically through the air. Quickly translating the message, Steve tugged an oblivious Scott with him as the six of them ran for the end of the hall around the spillage, following the puckered tracks of a factory wagon to a storeroom where they saw a dreadful scene: the dark passage had led them to room filled with rows upon rows of canons, stockpiled and ready for delivery.
Thee quick, one long … a pause … one quick, one long again. All this went unbeknownst to Stane, who looked over at them less the further he backed, and the more confidence he gained.
This time they had not been taken for granted—the men Stane had set after them knew what to expect, had been warned; in the following close-range shootout, though, the most any of them succeeded were several wild potshots that only served to empty their revolvers.
“When Obie found out where I lived … A part of me told to scatter the mail into the river and continue this new life … but…”
They all sipped their waters in the following silence as the appreciation rippled amongst them. Then came the dreaded question.
Bucky, who might once have found the necessity of this detour a cause of irritation rather than relief, simply settled to shoot deadly glares at the defense. Although Steve appreciated this show of support, he was slowly, at the sight of Bucky’s squarely clenched jaw, becoming to regret not taking Sam instead. Firstly, Bucky was more aggressive in his protection of Steve, who remained stubborn about the unnecessity of this; and secondly, Steve found sitting next to Bucky akin to being close to a dynamite with a lit fuse.
“I find I quite like them already,” said Steve, smiling wide and gave Tony’s hand a squeeze. Tony looked back, still wondering at being looked like this.
Perhaps it was the tone or the way in which the name had been spoken, that had Tony’s head snapping back to her.
“It was because of the little beings, who worked hidden from the apex predator in the metaphorical grassroots. Too small to detect, too small to cause a threat, but armed with a pair of big round ears—” Fury flicked his. “You, Rogers, have always been the harshest critic on authority. If you came out as an advocate, people would trust you. Although removed, you are a symbol. People
“Yikes,” said Tony with feeling, finally walking into the room, having left the sword leaning against the jamb. “Did Jarvis let you in? This room’s out of bounds, I’m not sure if you’ve heard—?”
Steve swiveled round. Now that the big fire had fed itself to its end, he, too, was able to distinguish a subtler, pinkish glow at the distant boundary of the town, burning brighter than the gaslights. Another fire, near…
When he laid down his knife to blow off some of the dust, however, he caught the reflection of a figure, distorted though it was by the rippling water, and looked up. Steve might have startled, but there was no one else to see. He was perfectly composed by the time the figure revealed itself to be Tony, who was finally, impossibly, at home.
“If it’s of any comfort, the death was quick,” he said, consulting his notes, which he had taken out of a coat pocket. “He was shot here between two and four in the morning. Bullet pierced liver and was found during autopsy. Including enough Benzedrine sulphate to knock out a horse — not lethal, but enough to have you climbing up walls for a long, long time.”
However, Steve, who hadn’t lifted his head from his lap for longer than what it took to exchange polite greetings, was still immersed in whatever trail of thought the presence of the Scotland Yard had out him hours before when Tony strolled into the drawing room.
Tony was a good liar, but a rehearsed one. Eventually, if one paid attention, they were able to follow the patterns of it. Like how Tony’s eyes flicked past him and then back. If they held secrets, they were buried deep within. But there was also wariness in him, as if he was waiting or watching for something. It was the look he had had ever since June, when their marriage had suddenly, unalterably, started to careen towards the metaphorical rocks. Perhaps it was only the awareness of their uncharted future.
“Your ongoing indignation? So you’ll hunt down the truth and let him know it when you go to prove him wrong. He doesn’t know shit, Steve. They just act like they do.”
“Well, well,” said Stern, and Tony could hear a note of trepidation, and knew Stern was wondering whether he had indeed verbally assaulted a friend of the host. Tony’s palm was sweating under the cool glass of the martini; he would not have been surprised to know Stern, as a politician, could smell fraud. But, at last, he let Tony in, grudgingly.
“I have never called things off with anyone before,” Steve said and looked down at his lap, then swallowed with difficulty. “Is this how it usually goes?”
you knew him,” he mocked. “Him and the two things he was good at. One of the two lead him to crash his car into an English oak.” Tony, hand shaking, straightened the fountain pens by his knuckles into a neat row, and spoke, “You’ve been here for twenty minutes, so I’ll give you another fifteen to hash out what you need. After that, I’m going to continue my day as it was, that is, with or without you.”
“I shall keep an eye on you,” the third chuckled, brandishing a pink fist in a parody of boxing. “No sudden movements, I’ve got a mean right hook.”
“Sheriff?” The hallway door opened and bumped into Steve’s shoulder. A harried-looking man apologized, and continued, “A fight has broken out, we need you at the courtroom.”
They sat, shivering now, for the train was speeding much faster on a plain and the wind whipped their fringes ruthlessly. For a few minutes, the only sound was the howl of the draught. But then Tony shimmied up the window and, when even that noise was cut off, the pressing need to say something became too much for Steve.
Steve, who had never heard Clint stutter, found a fear surfacing in himself—of power-rushed men, the great rumble of war and fields of bodies.
A murmur rose around the benches. Some of the gathered crowd were eyeing Strucker with pronounced outrage, others with mild interest. Then Steve heard, quite distinctly, from Bucky’s other side, a muttered voice saying, “Bastard.”
“Forget indifference, I’m officially livid right now. You need to hold yourself in higher esteem than jumping at the first sign of a pretty pair of pleated pants.”
Tony threw himself into the panicked crowd. People were shouting for torches and candles; many ran out the door to find them; in the darkness it was hard to tell a man from another.
Out in the street, Tony examined his sunlit surroundings to check whether the coast was clear. Yes, the car belonging to Hammer was still parked … nothing else seemed to be moving apart from a dark vehicle that had just taken off from in front of the bakery … Tony had taken his first step back towards his Cadillac, when he felt something was off … something distinctly odd…
Suddenly, for the first time that night, Steve found himself the recipient of Tony’s full, undivided focus.
And though Tony would have rather jumped off the study window than admit it, by the time the shadows had lengthened and the night came his chivalrous decision to have Rhodey removed out of harm’s way was rapidly losing its glory.
“Fury likes to delegate tasks to break up the facts into pieces so small it makes piecing them together impossible,” he said. “I see he has not given up on the tradition. Still the only one who knows the full truth … is him.”
The voices became louder, but the echoing halls made their speech impossible to follow. Steve counted that the three owners of the footsteps were just about level with them now, and tucked his hand closer to his chest in preparation, and—the footsteps, miraculously, unbelievably, passed their covert, with very familiar gaits…
hide the scar from us. You, with your medals and honor, you who have let your man hooraw you around—here’s what I think of
Tony’s face was expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between Steve’s, as though trying to catch a trap in one of them.
“Can I offer you anything,” asked Steve, who could empathize with what Jarvis must have been feeling right then.
Rainwater created a steady dripping sound in the background of Steve’s whittling. Wood shavings fell onto his feet after every rough scratch of his knife, turning dark in the muddy puddles pooling by his boots.
“Are they all quite so airheaded?” remarked Rhodey as they had trundled up the stairs at hovered by the mouth of Rhodey’s room. “You’d think it’s all a plot of some radio drama.”
The morning of the day after dawned clear. Steve observed this with mild pleasure through the cabin’s window and blew aside a strand of hair which had, out of neglect, grown long enough to dangle over his eyes in blond wisps. Through the thick glass, he could see what felt like the whole of West Coast spreading along the central valley. If he squinted, he imagined he could all the way to San Francisco—but that was merely a fantasy. Not even Clint’s eyes could have seen that far.
“Oh, and Rogers,” Fury spoke to Steve’s retreating back, “now that you don’t have your usual engagements, you wouldn’t mind dipping your toes into something big? I’ve heard some rumors about the man who killed Thaddeus Ross.”
The passage stretched before him as far as he could see, fifty feet long, like an oblong tunnel. Tony was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern the right door through the darkness … and then, without warning, something banged downstairs.
And why was the entry forced if there was a key? For that was definitely his; Tony had given it to Ty several years previously. It was all becoming tangled; Tony braced fingers against his temples, blocking out the current sunlit state of the room, trying to hold onto the moonlit window frame, but it was like trying to bottle smoke; the details were dispersing and thinning as fast as he tried to gather them … Tiberius had been shot from close range, and fallen backwards … away from the window …
“And what kind of man would let a paranoiac Mayor lure him into his megalomaniac schemes to protect the town he lives in?”
hissed Tony franticly, having shot over his shoulder a glance at Stane, who was swaying on the cusp of moving away from where they wanted him.
Steve asked and looked down in fear of seeing a hole ripped into the hand-sawn floorboards under his feet.
got you extra,” put in Scott, who indeed pulled three extra aprons from his bag, which Steve, Bucky and Natasha started to put on quickly on top of their clothes.
Tony twisted in his seat to shoot a smirk at the cousins of his mother’s, who had waited with bated breath for Howard to kick the bucket for decades.
Stane moved around: Steve lost sight of him for a while behind the pillars of the theater’s entry as Stane prowled while speaking in a measured tone.
“So, how do we tell apart a spy?” asked Sam as they neared the open iron gates of a side entrance. “I mean, isn’t blending in the whole point?”
On instinct, Steve looked down at his hip where his Colt Dragoon laid in its holster. “It’s served me well,” he defended.
“Thank you,” said Rogers and made another note in his crisp black notebook. “Did you see or hear anything unusual at night between one and five?”
Around the corner of the hardware store, though, a somewhat unexpected sight opened in front of his eyes: standing in the middle of the narrowed street, were Steve and Bucky, staring anxiously down at the body of a dead cow laying at their feet. Bucky’s gun was still smoking.
Steve had the strangest feeling that there was something he had forgotten, which only strengthened when the train took off, pistons hissing, from the platform. He stared at it, reflecting back to a time when a pile of plain coffins filled with reinterred bodies was a normal sight under its roof, until the windows became obscured with steam.
Clothes were dropped on the floor on his way to bed. It dipped and Steve caught the smell of cigarettes and distilled malt—the saloon.
Tony was, in fact, not paying attention, for he had seen across the room a lone woman lingering by the windows. In a red, belted dress with a cape collar, held together by a brooch so large it must have been a calculated risk, she appeared to be looking outside, but then — Tony’s stomach swooped — their eyes met on the reflection upon the dark panels.
because of where he is! He’s a thousand miles from here. Inside the surely most armed factory in the country. They make war their business, they’ll recognize you before you get past the lobby. What are you gonna do when they start shooting at you?”
Tony did. “Huh,” he said as his eyes skimmed along the lines. “Yup, piece of cake … the bullet went in sideways. It’s been known to happen with poor rifling. If I were them, I would concentrate my efforts on anyone buying Hammer’s products.” He threw the paper into the corner of the table, away from the plates. “Who was the poor bastard?”
“I saw, well, this is terribly awkward.” She was wringing her hands. “I saw how Mr. Rogers—your husband—locked the door and left. Then, later, after I had slept very little because I was so troubled, I happened to pass by the window again. It was open so I could get some air, but the smell! Why, I thought it would burn my nose right off! Then I saw
Tony blinked at the high ceiling, no doubt confused about his whereabouts and blinded by the sudden harsh whiteness of the room. His chest was raising under the covers a bit faster. His hand went to his throat, grabbing only air.
“Do you have any idea how stupid you are?” Bucky thundered. “If Tony had kept gunpowder in there, your ass would have been blown up sky high.”
“That’s a good reference,” said Rogers, looking boyish. The daylight was as flattering to him as the artificial kind and allowed Tony to see that the tips of his fingers resting on his book were strained with ink. “I’m aware that he’s—”
Rogers looked up when the fabric rustled. “Your cheek’s looking better,” he said. “How’s the throat?”
He shouldered his way inside and burned his hand on the padlock but continued forward with single-minded focus.
Something had chipped the post into splinters, but neither of the cleaner grooves cutting it diagonally, nor the slight blackened gunpowder residue confirmed Steve’s theory. Feeling disappointed, he threw sideways glances left and right, put on his hat with a twirl and, with last parting glower at the fence, walked off to finish some more paperwork.
He left, muttering rather distinctly, “Unwashed dishes … that’s what happens when I’m not there to look after things … gossiping and blessing themselves, I’ll show them!”
“Good,” said Hammer Sr. with finality; he seemed as reluctant to catch Tony’s eyes as Tony was to catch his.
So that was where Tony had been … tucked away in this dim, remote closet of a space. Had he really preferred it to their house? Had he simply been too ashamed to face Steve or had he, like Steve, wanted to pretend just a little longer?
The towering buildings cast shadows on their path, and, whether because of the mist or because of the hard surfaces of their surroundings, sounds echoed eerily as they walked. Steve felt as if he was underwater; after the noisy factory, the air pressed on their ears and buzzed.
“By which you mean Howard Stark’s only heir?” Bucky said relentlessly, for he was, as they all were, determined to know the full story. “Anthony Stark, wasn’t he?”
And then, halfway to his Cadillac, not watching where he was going, not concentrating on anything but the strange actions of Mr. Stone, Tony came across a dark figure intercepting his path, and the bouquet, suddenly slippery in his sweating hands, slipped from under his arm — he lurched forward, caught it, and raised his gaze to the man before him.
Steve could not understand why Sam looked so shocked. It was so obvious, so clear to Steve: he knew that the evidence was not enough for a warrant, but the idea of Stane’s involvement, of having kidnapped Tony, was the first thing that finally made sense in months.
“Are you all right, mister?” Sam asked Jarvis, who looked as though he had forgotten how to breathe.
“You,” Steve said slowly, “are fine because Bruce studied at Harvard and had a friend in a new, special branch of medicine they call neuroscience. To tell the truth, it sounds a little shaky to me.”
“If Fury received the wire of our delay in time, he should be waiting us here,” spoke Steve, scanning the crowd behind the gates.
It opened barely a half an inch. Steve took Tony to another cluster of free seats and tried that window. It slid down with a squeak, cold air swooping in and ruffling both their lengthened hair. Tony breathed in deep and leaned his forehead against the window. Steve sat by his side, taking a hold of his hand.
“He hasn’t let go of that naïve … idealistic, eighteen-year-old little kid with a weak chest. Since we joined the war by Lincoln’s draft, since us enlisted were swept off by the recruitment parade outside the court-house to the sound of its drums, since we fought together, he’s been my priority.”
As the horror of the discovery crept down his spine like scuttling ants, his mind registered sounds of the real world: a shuffle of fabric next to him as someone leaned past him to the window.
“Then so be it, jerk!” Steve yelled back, and let the front door bang shut after him, leaving Bucky to find his own way out of Tony and his house; Steve desired nothing more than to get away from him.
“Really? That must have left you out of several, significant stages of development,” said Pepper wryly, “which would explain how
He did not return for the next twenty minutes. Tony, who was getting antsy, felt the reality of his whereabouts rest heavy on his shoulders. They both knew Steve had covered for him, told God knows what to keep Tony out of custody. So here Tony was in his debt, unable to even things up —
“I fear poor Mr. Jarvis will wear himself thin in an attempt to side-track him … a devoted man, Jarvis, a very devoted man…” She faltered and the colour of her cheeks, always pinked by the Victorian kitchen range, deepened as she defended, “I am asking this not as a cook but a woman; can you do something to ease his mind? I suppose he won’t stop otherwise. He’s so very taken in with you, treats you as if you were his own flesh and — oh, goodness sake! The
“Is it actually the time?” he asked Jarvis, who had remained obediently still in waiting. “Or did you come save me?”
Footsteps pounded down to them from the still swinging door, and Steve fought to focus his gaze on Bucky’s exited, glowing face.
“Any guest that’s been to the house in the past weeks and during the wake have had all the opportunity to put their hands all over the property, no questions asked.”
“You’re under stress, Tony. I get it, and I forgive you. That’s what friends are for,” said Rhodey in a tone that implied he was attempting to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings. “I’m surprised, though … I rather thought there’d be more of them.”
Tony sucked in his cheeks; finding it very hard to hold Steve’s gaze just then. “Well, yeah, it’s … it’s … it’s good to be alive.”
“Buck, get hammer and nails,” Steve said, even as his heart plummeted. The vision he had been promising himself—solitude, comfort, the warm body of his husband and a house void of sand—disappeared, spiraled into the late afternoon sky.
“We came here as a team. Agreed, we picked up a couple of strays on the way…” Sam ignored Scott’s indignant yelp — “but in case you didn’t know, Nat, that means there can’t be a team inside the team—”
“Take it,” he mouthed at Steve from the lower steps, and stretched his left hand out. On it was the bulb.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” he said. “You can ask Tony later. You live together, after all. What’s the rush?”
Stane heard him. For a moment, he looked right at Steve. Then he pocketed the bulb inside his vest and returned his attention to Tony.
It was with heavy heart that Steve packed the fresh eggs that morning. Their chickens, that had held their tails down for days, letting rainwater drip down their brown backs, now clucked at him with their tails held high as they watched him pick up barely half a dozen eggs, as though priding themselves upon being able to count to two.
invited,” Tony lied, addressing the collar faced in wide grosgrain silk. He knew his story would collapse with the slightest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until Hammers recalled his rejection before the game was up in any case. “I’m a good friend of Justin’s.”
“The two people capable of running this place are at large,” hissed Natasha poisonously, “so I would be a little more concerned about the future of this country if I were you.”
Tony seemed a bit worse to wear, but despite his messy hair and the now slightly improved pallor that had worried Steve, Tony appeared to be in one of his animated, outgoing moods. Steve took that to mean he had slept, and was glad until the realization it hadn’t been on their bed—but where, then?
“You’ve at least taken a good look of the unfinished blueprints?” asked Obie, poorly hiding his keenness.
“Jarvis, you up?” Tony shouted into the seemingly empty house at large, eyes sun-dazzled. “The prodigal son has returned!”
“Of course not, Tony,” he replied, not raising his gaze. “I wasn’t … hold on.” Steve had just seen Tony back away from him from the corner of his vision. “Can we … wait, don’t go. Tony? We’re just worried about you.”
“No more than usual,” answered Natasha diplomatically, then she eyed him. “You think one of them is a possible suspect? You’ll have to tread carefully, Steve, our economy suffered big enough a hit when the bridge went down—we can’t afford to lose more visitors.”
“With a face like Pierce’s?” said Bucky, a corner of his lips twitching, “I wouldn’t have trusted him with a copy, either.”
Finally, after several minutes of Bucky’s continuing disapproval, an inconspicuous door in the back opened and Coulson stepped in and slid behind the dais.
With no other choice but to head down themselves, they descended the stairs. On the floor level, the noise of the steam engine-run cogs became almost unbearable and cut down their communication to nothing but hand signals. They weaved through rows of steel pipe columns as thick one’s thigh holding up the walkways half a story higher.
There was a pause that Steve would have described as awkward and embarrassed had he not known Fury better. With an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, Fury said, “I will neither deny nor confirm those claims.”
It took them a little over fifteen minutes to get off the train with their possessions; at last, beaten by wind that whipped their watering eyes, they managed to traipse over to the boxcar to cinch their gear back onto the saddles. Their horses slipped in the straw-littered planking as they walked them outside, where Steve’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimate. Then, their boots knee-deep in the crunching snowbanks, they heaved the door shut and made their way onwards over the tunnel on foot.
It missed him by a foot; a stroke of undeserved luck for Stane which left none for Tony; the beam sprung on its tip, now heading for him.
“If we prepare for him,” was Bucky’s constant justification, “we’ll get the information faster, and have Stane eating water and crackers quicker.”
He had just come from his swearing in at the townhall where he had accepted the tin star, savoring the triumph of finding a home after becoming adrift following war, when he had—just like today—sat down in front of a balding man.
“New York calls,” he soldiered on as he toed forward the stool, which kept snagging on the carpet. “The lighter the cargo, the cheaper the bill — hey!” He paused mid-step. “Here’s an idea! You can have this.”
“Tsk,” said Bruce, when the steaming cups had been laid to cool on the table, and he had gotten around to unwrapping the old bloody dressings. “It’s definitely going to scar now.”
It was all very well done, thought Tony, the tilt of her head, the careful demureness, none of it overdone. He, Tony, had had too much experience of playing nice with the crème de la crème not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that she wanted to slip into the anthill very, very much; perhaps even more so than Tony himself.
Suddenly, there was an agonized shout. Tony and Steve looked out to the open door, through which they could hear scolding: “No, drop that! No! Drop —
It was ajar; Tony could not remember Jarvis leaving it unlocked last evening, nor having seen a pale strip of light pooling under the gap minutes ago. Tony crept closer to the door and pressed his ear against it. It was impossible to pick up a sound. He quietly pushed open the door.
“They aren’t,” Clint said. “They are scared off their wits and this happens to be the juiciest piece of gossip in years—oh, and that reminds me, Steve.” Clint shot a look towards the open font door. “Fury’s been trying to fish information out of Bucky and me. About Tony’s whereabouts. He’ll try Sam or you next. Coulson came snooping as well but when he realized you’re the one with the answers, he dropped it. Not Fury, though … I think he lost all tact along with that eye of his.”
Again, for just a moment, the line between dream and reality became blurred, pulling Steve back to where he sat, surrounded by Sam, Bucky and Natasha, who were listening to Scott talk.
“Here,” said Sam, shrugging off his jacket; Steve didn’t know where he had lost his. “I better not see you run into any more fires with that on.”
“Yeah?” said Rogers, and there was no trace of outrage, deserved or otherwise, on his face now. “I’m sure you could have dissembled it to scrap faster than the Constables sent to retrieve the weapons could park.”
“You’re standing in front of my lilies,” said Tony, who had taken an impatient look over Hammer’s shoulders.
With this, he leaned over the desk to hand over his copy of the safe key; Tony felt rather than saw every eye in the room chase its path into his arms.
Jarvis gazed into space for a moment or two: he seemed to be gathering courage. As the four of them regarded him eagerly, Jarvis screwed up his eyes and started to speak.
“The question was not targeted to the Chief Deputy, Mr. Barnes. Let’s restrict it to ‘trialed’ so we may have a manageable number.”
a certain group of people who have been monitoring a lot of potential threats closely. As of now, I can only reach them by mail. Whoever burned that bridge has made me a
“Magnificent,” said Tony, sparing the ceiling a glance before peering at the guests. Now, Hammer was obviously in high good humour. His desire to invite Tony had been, Tony suspected, a mere whim. He may have been highly amused, as a child might be amused, by doing something unapproved. But no, the undercurrents that Tony sensed were nothing to do with Justin Hammer. In what direction did they lie, then?
“You’ll be glad to have work on your hands, then?” Fury’s good eye was peering at Steve passively. “Some of it is right in front of you.”
Steve mourned this until he heard soft footsteps heading for the bedroom. He glanced over at the dark shape of the door.
Inside, Steve found Clint and Sam sat close together at the same desk. Clint was manfully assaulting a piece of chewy salt pork; Sam was staring resolutely at the desk. Both seemed a little forced in their conversation with him; Steve suspected he had interrupted them in private talk. They sat there, with only the sound of Clint’s meat snapping off in chunks, until Steve couldn’t take it anymore.
Steve didn’t hear the rest, for he was staring at the bottom of the industrial table. Its legs had been
This was a rather enormous breach of etiquette, brought on, no doubt, by walking in on Rhodey and Tony discussing the case over dinner.
“Then uncomplicate it,” said Tony and glanced at the silver-framed table clock on the edge of the desk. “Fourteen and counting…”
At this, she glared at the dog; a big, scraggly-looking thing, laid in the middle of the corridor at the best advantage point. It looked up from under its brow so that the whites of its eyes showed when it sensed two pairs of eyes on it.
“Not against the law, is it?” said Tiberius, who was looking at Tony over his cigarette rather short-sightedly in his drunkenness.
In the end, Tony fetched a drink. The scotch seared Tony’s throat: it appeared to burn feeling back into his body, dispelling the sense of numbness and unreality, firing him with something that felt like courage.
Tony sighed. Steve felt this both in the movement of his jaw against his shoulder, and in the breath that stirred his own long hair. As if following an identic thought process, a curious finger started to play with a strand of it. Steve suppressed a shiver.
“Come on, Anthony,” Hammer lamented, although he did step away from the white, fragrant flowers. “Is this how you treat a friend of family?”
, then Steve’s look of outward gratitude. “It’s … it’s nothing—I—” his stutters ground to a halt. “That one’s new.”
The smoke was hardly stirring in the still air of the night; it was floating in wisps over the river, only moving once a charred piece of bridge broke off and fell into the black water. People in their robes and jackets thrown over nightclothes fluttered anxiously to and fro; figures briefly illuminated by the streetlamps. They heard a snatch of a sob or a sigh from detached conversations around them; then those quieted, too.
When he looked back, even months later, Steve found he had little memories of the Monday after. It was as though his life had turned over one time too many to keep count. The collections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the absence of Tony that took place right after his return to the empty house, and the untouched side of their bed that kept drawing his gaze like a dead body.
He had been stewing his resentment at Howard for so long — prepared to never let the happy memories outweigh the bad — that now when he suddenly found some more of the good, he did not know where he stood. Was it love — or something he’d always taken to be affection? What did love
“What about Hammer?” he asked Steve, fighting off a fidget. “Either, really. Both have got a smile like a slit in a letter box. I wouldn’t be surprised if he — them, either — planned to turn this into a Reichenbach.”
“That’s not the interest I’m here to protect,” she told Tony. “Walked past the hall to see a dozen of them skitter thought like they were making mental notes to mark off furniture.”
Then he thought of his reoccurring nightmare about Tony burning, arriving too late, only to hug his badly burned, lifeless body against his chest: they did not need to know the details.
Where was the killer and what was he doing? Tony had caught sight of Barnes only twice during the past days. Rogers rarely appeared anymore, and Tony was sure Jarvis was right in thinking that Rogers was only leaving the station to collect statements from where they were readily given. Had there been enough new evidence to save Tony? Or had, as he feared they would, the killed while wearing the face of a witness spun the web of lies thicker, more elaborate, and harder for Tony to escape? Barnes had said the case was proceeding; Tony had felt comforted, bolstered; and now he felt slightly apprehensive.
“Too busy.” He shot Bucky a look from under his brow and found him visibly skeptical. “Don’t you think it’s a little … soon?”
“Hey, hey, Tony,” he said, rising up as Tony started to back away, closing off. “Tony, we gotta look up for each other. All right? It’s just you and me now.”
The library had filled gradually around them over the half hour. Jarvis kept showing in people. Tony sunk deeper into his chair upon each arrival, pushing his sunglasses higher and higher until they pressed painfully against the bridge of his nose.
Tony searched Rogers’ eyes; he seemed genuinely regretful, but not regretful enough for the specific words of,
Steve bared his teeth at him and thrust the barrel flush with Stane’s sweaty forehead. He was sure the pressure put on it would leave a red mark, but that would be nothing compared to the ring-shaped burn if he pulled the trigger now…
The finger stopped, and Tony’s weight shifted. Last, Steve registered something was being pressed to his balled hand: Tony’s ring, now clinking next to its twin.
“Typical of the old man, really,” he said from behind the frame, which, true to Jarvis’ aborted pursuit, was dust-free. “Under several pounds of stone and he’s still managing to lecture me about idleness. If I didn’t know better, I’d say he’s dissembling this house himself to make me work for it.”
Tony settled under the covers, looked to his right and saw the sunrise reflected in Steve’s open eyes.
,” Tony asked. "‘Cause usually, about now, you would be lecturing me about situational appropriateness and tact?”
The air in the room was chilly and dry in his mouth. He looked around, realizing they were in the drawing room, where the fire from last night had cooled hours ago — no trace of embers to be seen in the blackened heart to his left, nor, thankfully, any bodies on the carpet that Jarvis had successfully cleaned with soda.
Steve looked down as well. There was a scarlet slash in the shape of a padlock burnt across the width of his palm. He could also see where parts of his body hair had been singed off as Bruce slathered his hand in oil and put dressing on it.
“What? Seen the amount of license you get?” Sam said, sounding half-affronted, half-awed. “Caught the guy looking at that star of yours like it was the medal for valor, which I know you
But Steve was impervious to this amendment. Rounding his desk, he plucked the card from Bucky’s hands pointedly. “See you tonight.”
From his position in front of the group, Steve looked at from one man to another. There was a noise behind him, and Steve turned. His suspicion grew: Tony was standing feet from him and gave Steve a beaming smile; Steve had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful he was, but he had never been quite so uneager to lock himself in a confined space with Tony for a couple days.
Indeed, by the time the dinner was finished, they found the dark-uniformed Police-Constables talking to two of the housemaids in the hall outside.
“The—the inquest?” Tony got out, observing blearily the thin strip of light coming through the unopened shutters.
He had the distinct impression of a bullet emerge from the cylinder of the revolver, fly towards his chest … piercing his jacket … he felt as though a fist had hit his middlemost rib. And only then did he hear the shot.
“Oh, great,” said Tony. “Let’s invite them back, march up to their doorstep with a warrant in hand. Bet they’d love it.”
“You know, I knew your father. I was sad to learn of his death,” he said, frowning. “He was too young to go.”
Tony did not answer. Steve could not see his face: he wondered whether Tony sensed Stane’s plan, was trying to lead them backwards into someplace safe, away from wherever Stane shepherded them.
Tony, despite himself, felt his muscles relax. His fingers toyed with a short string that had broken loose from the silk-lining of his pocket.
Steve thought, and watched Tony’s eyes fixate on his lips, watched him smile in a way that made him fear anything might happen now. If Tony came any closer, he would hear Steve’s heart agreeing hungrily with this plan; he was already close enough Steve could count each individual lash.
It’s almost clumsy … badly put together … as thought the goal was never to see you hang, but to point the focus on someplace else, away from something they do not wish us to see?”
“Standard procedure, huh? Okay, just put your foot under the other. Like climbing down a tree. Did your father ever teach you how?”
believe you. This is — this is the worst of your irresponsible decisions — and there’s a lot of them—"
. Just for the record, imprisoned in his house with just a box of scraps for company until my father’s legacy was officially transferred to his name was about as fun as it sounds. On my twelfth birthday, he had me transferred to the New York factory. I think he told me to ‘think of it as a nice fieldtrip.’ Very nice sense of humor, that man had.
To his horror, after climbing from a long sunlit stretch into third misty peak, the train slowed to a jerky crawl and stopped completely with a whining lurch. Around the compartment people craned their becks to look around. Moments later, a man came from another cart through the door at the front. Straining their ears, they caught a word here and there.
Before he could even wipe his chin, though, the man was seized by the front of his suit by Bucky, who one-handedly lifted Strucker in air and looked equally enraged. The courtroom gave a collective gasp.
Steve turned to look at Natasha, who had not spoken in the past ten minutes. She was standing next to the window with her hip cocked, observing the three of them silently. Catching Steve’s eye, she nudged her chin toward the window.
The nurse came to extinguish the dripping candle on Tony’s bedside and in its soon-to-be-lost light, Steve quickly read the missing page of Obadiah Stane’s letter, which held only a few lines:
Bucky, who had been taking a sip of water, choked. Sam banged him on the back as Bucky couched, shooting a wet-eyed, alarmed glance at Steve, who now knew the old man’s tale had won over another.
They packed up their dishes and quilts after breakfast and moved down the mountainside in slippery snow, which turned to slush by the time the sun climbed over the peaks behind their back. It pursued them to the wooded valley, and persisted all day, through ridges and plains. They rode overnight. It was as though a flame had been lit inside them, urging them to catch lost time. And the fiercer the wish to find Tony burned inside Steve, the less joyful the undisguised circuit of the sun made him.
“When I need it to be,” Tony said absently, and then he processed Rogers’ tone and realized he had, impossibly, proven to be in possession of a sense of humour.
There was a series of relieved exclamations at the news and Tony allowed his panic to recede. He straightened a little higher. The old Hammer in front of him strode over to his son, carded his knobby fingers through the bloodied hair, and spoke, “Is the doctor on the way?”
“Just passed Carson City,” said Bucky, and sure enough, at that moment the train hit an upward slope and the chugging of the engine grew louder while the grinding slowed.
Stone, who had allowed this argument to develop, now with a slight gesture indicated that it should cease. All pairs of eyes fell on him; a long, impenetrable silence fell as they observed him feel Hammer’s neck.
Half across the square, the two men of startlingly different size were caught in a standstill: Stane was too wary of Tony to fire and kept his distance, while Tony had taken the role of the intimidator; their steps bringing them further away from the theater, and nearer the construction site of a Victorian high Gothic church at the opposing side of the square.
“Sorry, boys. It’s a busy day,” said Nat, striding to their table, and sitting down on what little bench space there was next to Steve. Through their clothes, their legs met from hip to ankle. “Comfortable?” she asked wryly.
Here, the Windsor-loving cousin jumped up like a jack-in-the-box. Highly embarrassed, she sat back down slowly, and thereafter remained in her seat. Tony, leaning back on his rear chair legs, gazed through his lashes at the attaché case in disguised avidness, and as Murdoc walked to it, every eye tracked his movements. At the back of the room, books had stopped shuffling.
When they passed through them into a sort of entry yard, their eyes fell upon queues formed in front of three arches housing as many entrances to the factory. They had barely dismounted and joined the nearest one when Steve observed a superior checking his watch by the grilles at the front. Feeling eyes on his person, he lifted his gaze; it glittered with recognition.
“Planning?” he asked, stepping under the porch, laying a casual hand on the rail. “Nope, I’m not planning on anything. There’s been a, uh, significant rise in jammed guns.”
He had tried to sound casual, as though these were merely throwaway what-if’s of no real importance, but he was sure he had fallen far off the mark; Natasha’s eyes were a little too understanding. As a burning sensation swelled in his throat, something wet slid down the side of his nose, and they sat there, looking at each other in dim ambient light, and from the expression on Natasha’s face, he felt as though he had stepped into a trap.
“Excuse me,” said Obie, though he addressed not Tony, but the lawyer, “Mr. Murdoc, if it’s not against professional etiquette, how usual is this change of Will?”
Tony, who had just been lifting a plate, fumbled. The plate shattered on the wooden floorboards. Steve jumped up with a cry of, “Tony?”
A housemaid with a dustpan and a brush breezed past him, and behind him, quite distinctly, he heard a muttered, “Scared isn’t the word I’d use.”
Tony gestured toward a sofa group, which Rogers paid no heed to; instead, he walked about the room, inspecting the thirty-foot long and ceiling-high bookshelves in interest, as though the gilded-lettered spines might reveal to him a sensible explanation of the night’s events.
“They may try,” said Clint, sounding morose as he swallowed. “But the day I’m killed taking a squat will be the day hell freezes over.”
At his father’s study, at the opening of the left wing, Tony crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a roof, a thin, glittering ribbon of rooftop windows just above the canopy. He was high up; a bird flew past the window to the eaves above him as he stared in the direction of the limestone mausoleum, invisible behind an ancient chestnut. His father laid over there. Since the funeral they had been closer to each other than they had ever been during his childhood, but his father could not have known his son was gazing towards him now, thinking of him. He supposed this was his father’s way of securing himself the standing last word; either the constant sight of it would chase him out in less than three months, or it could, after years and years of closure, bring him comfort.
In the second row, a square-jawed man leaned closer to his neighbor, a thin man, and whispered something to his ear. The friend smirked and nodded.
“Sorry? Hey, see, this is progress. I could go as far as say you’ve ceased exercising blindness to everything but your own judgement.”
Steve looked back at the empty passage spreading behind them, then to the door. Bucky seemed to latch onto his thoughts and tugged Natasha close to the wall as Steve took a couple steps away from the door and brought his body forward. The frame groaned; the latch had sprung loose of its bent cavity and Steve pried it open further by hand, the other side of which revealed to be a lavish, mahogany-paneled room.
And then he trailed off; his eyes had seen Steve, truly seen him, and it looked as if a lightbulb had gone off in his head.
“Perhaps you already know what it is? Clever boy such as yourself must have put two and two together.”
Steve felt flushed in the already hot, crowded Town Court. He also felt as if he was floating; every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there in the shadows of the wall feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of Sam and Bucky’s presence next to him.
. “He has an innate ability to scent pretense like a bloodhound, no doubt because of his past. Took us years to track him down to a run-down log cabin in upstate New York.”
Pepper’s smile, once Tony had set down the art and had an undisturbed view of her freckled face, was a little too understanding.
The door banged shut on Tony’s face, leaving him to glower at the world beyond it through the eyelets of its mesh screen. A lock clicked, the door was rattled experimentally, and then footsteps retreated. A door opened and closed, and Tony was left behind to massage his sore throat.
Steve, who couldn’t help but notice the girl looked at his father with the amount of awe Scott bestowed upon Steve, smiled. While he wondered at the proof of a generation that had not known war, Tony had joined him by his elbow, staring at the scene himself with an unreadable expression.
“My boy,” rumbled Obie, and set the round cap back on the decanter, “I did not expect anyone to be up at this hour.”
“Heroes are out of fashion, don’t you think,” said Stane as he observed the wreckage with blank and pitiless eyes, equally uncaring of the barrel pointed at him. “In this new age of war, there is no place for the lone gunslinger.”
There were sounds of several traded shots, nearly drowned by Clint’s fire behind Steve’s back—and then, suddenly, it became silent in the way nature quieted before a storm; and then—nothing could have prepared Steve for this—the air was full of Bucky’s yells. Horrified, Steve backtracked, and dashed over to Bucky, who was kneeling on the ground, face pale and clutching his shoulder. Blood swelled between his fingers and dripped down the back of his hand. Standing over him, sneering at his own work, was Rumlow.
The tapping stilled. “I don’t care about the close-knit community idyll anymore,” Tony confessed in a rush. “It’s … it’s dull. This is me trying to revive myself.”
Pym rose from behind his desk, on top of which were several fallen items. He still looked rather flushed from anger from his lined forehead to his silvery beard as he straightened to greet them.
He wished he had asked more questions while Howard had been alive. There were so many days wasted, hours he could have used to find out more about how to be the man Howard was…
“You know, he had a similar idea as your jacket.” He picked at the lapels of it. “Tony, I owe you my life. Things like these … it’s unfathomable.”
“Well, it isn’t too bad, considering,” Bucky said. “No one lives on a bridge. I say this is done by someone who thought it would be quite the joke to see—
Gradually, they moved from behind the stacks. Steve glanced up into the ceiling where the foggy sky was darkening. Oddly, one of the glass panels there was broken and before he had time to send a warning, its remains crunched under Scott’s feet. They froze; the hall became deathly quiet.
Rogers, as though wishing nothing more than to see him squirm some more, gave his permission with visible reluctance.
Steve hesitated; it might not be casework related. But he was bored … and then his curiosity got the better of him. He got moving and set off towards the townhall. He was going to see what new information was available.
“Let me guess,” floated in Sam’s concerned voice, “we’re heading toward the swirling white hell in the west?”
If this happened, they had no other choice: the moment anyone entered the corridor and saw the breach, an alarm would sound out. And Tony could be moved to someplace else…
“We only need one proof,” he kept saying. “Just a document about a paid murder signed up by him, a sworn word by a witness, a whistleblower—
Feeling more than a small amount of irritation towards Pym, Steve had half a mind to turn around and refuse to receive his help, and he would have, had the safety of four others not been on stake. Instead, he watched Pym walk around the room in grim silence. From a drawer of his desk, he drew a key.
“The worst things in the world have been done on good intentions,” Steve said, starting to really get irritated with every attempt at shifting the blame off him, and onto Tony.
Upon these words, two more men, bruised and limping, dragged themselves out of the valley and into the square.
“Not directly. It was not my place. I know only what I happened to overhear while serving Mr. Stark. There were some words we exchanged as I let him in the house, but I do not see how inquiries on whether the master was home would be of any consequence to you.”
Steve looked overt the table, too. Where Stane was supposed to be, all but lifelessly sprawled on the cemented floor, was now just a couple pieces of what looked to be a broken pocket watch. As they cursed colorfully, the mindset of leadership was slowly taking hold of Steve.
“If your goal was to save lives, how come you’re still running,” Steve asked coolly from the back of Pym’s fancy, embroidered waistcoat. “War ended fifteen years ago.”
The last was said in a reluctant rush as though he had wished to taste to words a little longer on their way out. Under Hammer’s half-frustrated, half-affronted gaze, Tony felt that small prickle of alarm in his spine grow into a sense of foreboding. It did strike a memory; he had heard it from Obie’s mouth. Now, hearing the name again, he rather wished SS France would take a detour, preferably around Greenland, to stall Obie’s no doubt stormy arrival…
He did not stop until his boots sunk into the mud of the riverbank, where burrs stuck to his light brown pants: the yellowed hay swayed in wind; the swift, rushing current sped around the bend created by their town, and the water looked very grey reflecting the skies overhead. Despite all this, there lingered a silence and stillness, as shivers stared to rock up and down Steve’s body, as his hair and clothes got wetter and wetter until he did not know whether the moisture dripping from his chin was from the rain or his tears.
“I faked it. Figured it would hit you were it hurt Sorry ‘bout that.” … “In my defense, I thought it would be done and dusted sooner. Stane’s letters kept getting more and more frequent and I just … waited and
Tony swallowed; the previous warmth leaked out as though he had been pierced by something sharp. Suddenly, although he knew it was nothing Pepper hadn’t already voiced, a wave of strong hatred surged inside him; at this moment, he hated everything about Obie, right down to the way Obie’s suit jacket was stretched tight over his back, where a crease made prominent several pounds of weight gain that had not been there since they’d last seen each other.
[2] It might take longer for the next bit ... but since you clicked on a story with a [2/?], you knew what you might be getting into, you brave, brave soul.
I didn't have time to edit it because I wrote 6K of a How to Train Your dragon AU--which, I swear, is writing itself. The blond Bulky Viking Steve vs. Scrawny Inventor and Dragon-lover Tony was too much for me to resist. Just to clarify, it usually takes me 12 months to write a fic (this here took 18 r.i.p.) but this ... this is absolutely blowing up. I just returned from a 10-mile walk and I walked like a teenagers with my nose in my phone because I couldn't put the Notes App down, THAT'S how strong my 48h brainstorm was!
“Well, you offered me a nightcap. Then made a pass or two. And dropped like a light around two. Figured I’d let you rest.”
“Oh, I see,” she said. “But what do I know? I have too much time in my hands, that’s all. Way too much. And a migraine. That can really do a woman’s head in.”
She finished this on a rather happy note, and looked over her shoulder as they passed. The look lingered. It left an unpleasant taste in Tony’s mouth.
“I don’t know,” said Steve, frowning at the picture of Tony, whose chest was just cropped out by the picture frame. “Sir, when you said a piece of wood flied through the wagon…”
Then Tony paused; he looked like he wished to go back in time and unsay one, if not several, of his last sentences.
“See, this is why we always bicker,” he said. “We’re both stubborn by fault and somehow take it upon ourselves to try and out-stubborn one another.” He shook his head and gave Steve a onceover. “It’s like raving at a brick wall.”
“I frequently oversee hangings in Denver. I’m afraid its romantic potential is lost on me,” Steve said, dryly.
“Thanks,” said Hammer, visibly upset now that his sensational news had not gained its preferred effect. “I mean, I felt bad, of course I did. My heart bled at taking advantage of such a time, but —” Hammer shrugged, a small smirk playing at the edges of his mouth “— early bird
“San Fran—?” he started, but the rest of the city was drowned by a voice not unlike a cannon fire, and Steve instinctively ducked his head, expecting to find the roof collapsing upon them.
He brushed past Steve, his scowl emphasizing the scar on his brow which cast a severe shadow upon his forehead. Steve clung tighter onto the eggs. One pace, two, three, and then on fourth, the man glanced back, and at being caught looking, hastily turned away.
“I heard you met Rogers,” said Peggy, rather out of the blue, when her voice filtered to Tony’s right, desk-facing ear.
Suspicion risen, Steve observed his retreating back with squinted eyes. Looking back where the man came from, there were shallow impressions on the ground from his boots. Steve trailed them backwards; the little lane along which he was walking curved and joined the main street where the trail disappeared.
He felt as each of them had reached an understanding to wait for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside Leigh’s Creek—and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew for certain.
In reply, Sharon extended both her arms and left Steve no choice but to take them and escort her into the throng of dancers. Her real intention, however, was to talk to Steve away from the rest of the deputies. She waited until they were positioned in the middle of the floor and the band and the ruckus of steps drowned them out, then took Steve by the hand and said, very seriously, “No word of Tony?”
Steve’s work was, according to him, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on the concealed carrying of weapons to keeping the occasional brawling wanted man in control (Steve remembered painfully clutching his pointy star at this point). Philips had then patted Steve’s shoulder in a rather fatherly manner and sent him to his right hand, Coulson, who would draft the required paperwork and background research.
Tony let out a laugh that was somewhat unhinged. “Like that would keep you out. I had a plan and you—you know what, you lack all finesse. Should’ve known you’d just bust your way here singing
Steve made his way into the kitchen blindly to unearth their old oil lamp from the back of a cupboard; he lit a match and opened the burner. In the new light glowing through the shade, he observed his surroundings. Nothing was amiss.
“Huh,” said Tony in recognition. “Here to scrape off the skim from the milk before the rest have the chance, Aunt Peggy?”
“Steady thy laden head across a brook, or by a cyder-press with a patent look, thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.”
Directly opposite him, Natasha, dressed as a man, red hair tied in a knot under her cowboy hat, leaned closer.
“Isn’t that Tony’s forge—?” Bucky didn’t get to finish. Steve was already running, deaf to Bucky’s cries of, “Steve, wait—God damn it!”
Something crashed. A burning shelf had collapsed. It sent a bottle careening towards the floor where it shattered; tiny fragments of glass and a shower of sharp-smelling liquid spread about; the fire almost looked like it danced as it hungrily licked its way up the airborne droplets. Heat burned at his side, smoke stung in his eyes and his vision swum. The flames, eating up the curtains of the alcove, were too tall to see if the bed was vacant or not.
Fury followed his gaze to the letters on his hands, looked up and grinned. It did something funny to the shape of his mouth, not helped by the fact Steve had never seen such expression on him.
Steve swallowed and shied from Tony’s furiously squinted eyes. The walls of their home, and the still pale clay in between the thick logs, proved a good substitute. He had done the seal himself, not knowing the married bliss that had spurred him forward would expire before the clay had had the chance to darken with age and wear.
Steve saw similar realizations cross the faces of his friends. It did not promise anything good about the origin of the explosion.
“Yeah, you know what? I’m just gonna … go to the snacks, work off some hunger,” Tony explained, already drifting away, and for a moment, he thought he saw a shadow pass over Hammer’s face, saw that foolish smile falter.
Steve was breathing deep; there was a stitch in his side under his bruised chest that felt as though he had a blade between his ribs. Despite this, his arm stayed level as he pulled the hammer slowly back, using its heavy pull for emphasis, until they both heard it notch.
It had happened a few times in the past two weeks, Steve going to bed alone but waking up to noises from the kitchen, and, upon stumbling towards it, finding Tony there.
In a synchronous movement, both Steve and Fury swiveled to look out onto the street where Happy’s wagon stood not hundred yards from them, left front wheel twisted, wagon tongue nearly buried in the sand, and all this fronted by a visibly distressed mule. Scott Lang appeared to be attempting to split himself into two and was trying to simultaneously keep the limp but lofty form of Moolissa on the listed wagon bed while calming down the panicky mix-breed.
The town was quiet, too. No carriages on the streets, not a soul crossing through the shades of the porches. The flat-faced public houses were silent. The rope, on the other end of which the thief had been dragged by a bull, lay frayed a hundred yards off, beside the man’s hat.
Steve bolted upright on the bed. Blindly throwing on clothes over his linen nightshirt, he pinpointed the noise to the river nearby, and soon was sprinting towards it, gun at the ready. He hurtled around the last building between him and the water, and there he saw his bullets were for naught; he couldn’t shoot his way out of this one.
Tony blinked — Obie and Hammer Sr. were poised chest to chest — the others, Stone and his partners, knelt by the body, which, as Tony now saw, was heavily bruised at the head, a rivulet of half-dried blood trickling down a temple. The glasses, that had minutes ago glinted in light, laid crooked and cracked at the end of a broken nose.
“I trust him,” Tony said defensively, giving no room for arguments. “What can I say, I’m a giver. And you’re welcome, by the way. I just solved your loose end.”
Shaking off excess droplets, he looked back into the mirror, examining the dark circles under his eyes with clinical interest. He had to admit to himself, though, that he had continued work with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the strain of it, for every hour not slept and every new scar in his body felt like a promise of aptitude to the people that he served.
“Yeah … all right,” stammered Hammer, gesturing vaguely about, “treat yourself with something from the spread.”
But someone had, someone had succeeded in killing him and had not got caught. The men who had killed Lincoln were supposed to be locked away, if not dead … having acted alone, and without a country-shaking masterplan to destroy America…
“Good,” said Sam although he looked dubious. “Just making sure the town gossip isn’t what’s keeping you up.”
Steve thought, not for the first time. It had created what looked like neither liquid nor air—if it had any substance at all. Where did it come from? What would it drain?
“You weren’t kidding about the rot,” said Tony with decisiveness as his fist clenched upon the key on his palm. “You’d be more comfortable at the King’s Arms. Rhodey says it’s cosy.”
started Scott but was cut off as Sam and Bucky elbowed their way to Steve’s side. Irrationally, Steve thought that this had not helped in making his newest friend less starstruck; his adrenaline released its hold in the form of a hysteric giggle.
Tony peered into the room, his heart pumping ever faster. Two shadows moved … of two men, whose stretched-out figures gestured agitatedly on the library floor.
Tony only hummed, noncommittal. Peggy lingered, then left to find a seat as Matthew Murdoc, the solicitor himself, arrived through the walnut doors.
“Healed but stubborn as an ox,” answered the man, Dr. Strange. “Had he been standing, the voltage difference between each point of contact with ground would have caused the current to arch up one foot and exit the other.”
At the corner of the room, the band started on the next song and a dancing coupled bumped into them. Ms. Althea made a displeased sound at the back of her throat and tugged Steve out of the room, stating a wish to speak with him privately. Here, he found himself, again, cornered in a corridor outside the Courtroom, and found his captor equally determined, although about a foot shorter and wearing a golden ballgown.
“Much,” Steve admitted sheepishly, voice hoarse. He knocked back the new glass; it burned less the second time around. “Sorry I, uh, took it out on you.”
“Er—well, the bull is probably halfway to Kremmlin by now,” said Sam who had seen the bull disappear into the horizon just before his last encounter with the thief. “Last I saw him he was banking the corner ‘round the saloon as fast as his hooves carried him. Nearly impaled old Lee.”
Steve had visited the office once when it had been inhabited by its previous occupant. In Mayor Philips’ days, the walls had been covered with thick, gilded-framed portraits of former mayors, frilled brocade curtains, and on the wall behind an enormous desk, had been a painting of his son. Now, however, the office was bare of any personal touches, and trying to build a character from this space that was more stripped than a monk’s cell, was akin to trying to catch smoke with bare hands.
, you dirty dog,” said Hammer, who had read from Tony’s troubles a suggestive gesture that wasn’t there. “Which one?”
“Take it. Just take it,” Tony said sharply. “Unless you’ve changed your mind about letting me take a look at your gun. I may even have something better in stock.”
How many ghosts of the past would he run into during his stay in England, he thought on his way to peruse the left wing. And if he would … how many of them would turn out to be malevolent, as the memories responsible hardy encouraged the makings of a good one?
Steve heard a noise start; slowly, and then all at once; suddenly so unbearable they clapped their hands over their ears—then, once the high pitch had seemingly filled the whole hall, it reached what sounded like a breaking point—and it gave away to a yowling
In answer, Coulson walked up to the desk and spread before their eyes a Sanborn fire insurance map of San Francisco, which was colored in pinks, yellows and greens to relate the locations and use of each building as well as its construction material. Stark Industries spread in the right corner of it, far larger than any other house. The map showed its main halls, balconies, main entrances, and barracks.
“I have grown rather fond of you,” Stane muttered quietly. “But, alas, if you insist to be selfish, you leave me no other choice.”
“Look at that,” Sam made known to the others, out of sight back in the alley. At his call, Steve and Bucky came jogging to join him.
Steve shrugged, but arduously so, because Tony had started to make little noises in his sleep. His body twitched.
Bucky whistled, and wandered to it. “Someone’s unhappy.” He picked up one and straightened it, “’Progress stalled … cannot deliver … blah, blah … will not recur…’” Bucky balled the letter back and sounded impressed as he continued, “Huh, never heard of Tony being stalled in anything. Sounds like your boy is fighting back, Steve.”
He took them though the house, and in a far-flung room behind a locked door, he dug up five of what looked like thin breastplates—but not of any metal Steve knew. They looked light as Pym handled them, handing them over to the five of them.
“Pity,” said Tony, rather carelessly pocketing the key. “Just when I’d planned to hold a séance by the stain.”
Jarvis did not move or speak as he took in the blotch of blood on the body, and then the matching stains spread over Tony’s hands. Tony kept staring at him unblinkingly. For a few seconds, Jarvis seemed transfixed, his eyes wide as he stared down at Tiberius. Then he appeared to come to life again.
“You know,” said Obie, looking down at the keyboard, unaware of Tony’s struggle, “you could show a little enthusiasm. It will be your face that’s expected at the board meetings by this time tomorrow.”
It was an odd moment. He and Tony had been briefly united against Stane—now the fact they used to be lovers came back to them both. Neither spoke, but there seemed to be an unwritten rule that one could look only when the other’s attention was elsewhere. Steve took full advantage of this, letting his eyes sweep over Tony’s bruised features once again; Steve felt the hit from the beam resonate in each of his own injuries.
Steve looked down at the sketched illustration of the city hall and the surrounding square where it had happened. Something didn’t fit about the distances, thought Steve, and tried to find a chapter on the weapon used.
“Seriously? Still hovering? I feel like I’m going to spontaneously wreck the house just by breathing with you watching over me like that. What, you’re not allowed to leave without my say so?”
“I have half the mind to refuse,” he said, wiping his chin. “I did regret his death, but … I never got along with that bastard. You could say we represented two different sides of the same coin, old money and new.”
“One is an army man like you, but I don’t know if he’s still … anyway. Pepper’s fierce—and I mean Natasha-level spitfire, just not as red. You’d like them.”
“No one knows,” Steve read from the paper. “The cartridge didn’t match any known caliber and, according to the autopsy, the wound was shaped weird.”
Two figures were walking slowly ahead. One big and wide, one short and stiffly moving: Stane had caught up to Tony, whose movements were sluggish—
A ferry’s horn sounded heavily out in the shallower water, but they couldn’t see its source. Noon had turned to afternoon when they descended the hill.
Steve felt sickened and angry: at this moment Tony could be poring over designs meant to destroy instead of fix, could be forced to be part of a system that was the reason the technology of warfare had surpassed the technology of health care during the last war. If Stane, with the help of Tony, was to come up with something
Steve looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought Bucky had already left the room, and then he found him, sitting casually atop Stane’s messy desk, passing a brass paper weight from hand to hand, throwing it higher and higher.
Catching sight of his forlorn reflection, Steve made to turn away from the glass but froze, his heart leaping. Right across the courtyard Stane’s office was facing, stood the furthest wing of the factory. Its chimneys spewed smoke, there were lights on, yet, as Steve continued his silent observing, no one went in or out. There should have been hundreds of workers in a hall of that size. Surely one of them had to leave or return some time…
“Is it possible someone, an outsider, had pulled Anthony away from the carnage?” Steve asked, feeling mildly sick.
“Imagine how many lives it would have saved!” cried Bucky, equally incensed. “Imagine if Lincoln had worn it.”
Bucky jogged to a nearest pile of wooden boxes and tore its lid off. From inside, he lifted a rifle that had a strange shape to its barrel, which was very short and awkward-looking, given the black second handle in front of the trigger. Its function was revealed, though, once Bucky tried to take it off. It was full of ammunition.
A snow shed had failed and released its fresh, snowy burden above a summit tunnel that had collapsed under the weight, and their only way through the mountain range was now buried under a several dozen feet of snow.
“If you insist on badmouthing my business, you can leave,” Natasha said, and smirked at him over her own, much emptier glass. “Your star-spangled chest is bad enough on its own.”
Barnes was staring again. Then he seemed to pull himself together and said with slight effort, “It’s been a few weeks. Unfortunately, I can’t say the circumstances have changed much.”
From all of these things, Steve had drawn the conclusion that business was booming in the West Coast for Stane. This scant news made Steve wish for one more, this time incriminating, fact so badly it felt like a headache; yet it also reminded him of the lack of progress made on the case of the arsons. Indeed, as the driver shared little anecdotes of life outside, Steve for a mad moment entertained himself with the thought of what would happen if he surrendered to the fatigue: to drop his mask, and to catch a breath, and to have other people in charge seemed all but irresistible at that moment. But then he remembered that it would be a cruel thing to do for the people who trusted him, and who looked up to him in trying times such as this. Indeed, this point was inadvertently emphasized by the townsmen who slipped leading questions about their progress into daily conversation.
“Obadiah Stane used to starve,” scoffed Pym. “Fat lot of good has his acquired wealth done to us. Railways, guns … things that blow up.”
Tony pulled the dish of sandwiches closer and helped himself to seconds. His stomach, that had never gotten anything to eat yesterday, was lurching less and less unpleasantly by every hungry bite.
Steve wasn’t sure whether he liked Pym or not. He supposed he had been ready to help when needed, but he had always seemed somewhat vain and much too critical of Tony without any discernible cause.
“Oh, surely I shouldn’t—but if you insist—thank you, dear,” she simpered. “Do you have time? I’ve bought a new tea set since the last time we met. It’s of course not as fine as yours—” she sighed somewhat wistfully. “Finest china I’ve ever seen. Never quite got Mr. Rogers to divulge their origin. Oh! Speaking of which … you should ask him to come, too, sometime. I have it on very good authority that honey and ginger are good for us insomniacs,” she said and nodded meaningfully at Steve. “All that smoke coming out of that chimney day and night…”
Sharon looked sharply from left to right. But the fiddle was playing rather shrilly, and even the stomping foot of its player was drowned under the dozens of dancing feet on the floorboards; they had not been overheard.
“I’ll leave you to eat,” said Rogers, looking rather relieved as he started to walk towards the driveway. Tony remained standing in the shadow of the trees, gaze fixed on the back of a retreating blond head that was infuriatingly not to blame for this.
Provoked, Steve crossed the final distance; Steve had only time to reflect that if he were Tony, he would have had something clever to say before he tackled Stane by his middle, causing both of them to fall hard onto the stones.
With a rattle, the stage was pulling up, horses’ hooves kicking up clumps of snow when it skidded to a slushy halt, snow spilling off the roof and platting, startlingly white, onto the colored snow at their feet. As they watched Happy climb down the vehicle, anticipation thickened amidst them.
“Imagine this,” he said. “A man creates dissension on purpose to antagonize the country that is still divided—to the bitter losers who are neck-deep in debt, and the rich winners, who feel validated by their cause. It is easy, too easy, to stage the murders of several politicians with significant northern ideals of equality. Conflict made, this man is one murder away from starting a full-blown war. So, I ask you, Sheriff, what kind of man will profit from this? What could this man own that will make him a rich man when human nature becomes a casualty of war?”
“There’s a lot you don’t know,” said Pym, staring deeply into the bottom of his glass. “Do you know your target?”
Down below, Tony had merely glimpsed a dark thin-brimmed hat, and wide shoulders. Now, he had the chance to take in all of him — fair skin, straw-blond hair, plain pants, and an open overcoat coat that did no favours to what appeared to be a
Jarvis blinked rapidly. “Yes, I—yes, I am quite all right,” he said, and even managed a self-depreciating, little laugh. “My old mind must have done tricks to me after all this reminiscing.”
A dark pool of blood, almost black in the monochrome of night, was spread across Ty’s chest, and which Tony had mistakenly taken to be a spill of wine; Tony wrenched back his hands in horror, but too late: they were already stained and sticky with cool blood.
Rogers’s answering blush was blurred due to Tony’s watering eyes; he blinked, trying to get them to focus.
But the moment he touched her, Natasha swung herself at him. Suspended by her thighs on his shoulders, she twisted in the air and brought Rumlow down with a satisfying thud. Quicker than a blink, she snatched his gun and notched it expertly, arms braced on her kneeling leg.
Bucky’s expression of outrage was perfectly predictable; but why, Steve wondered, watching him, did Clint look almost equally invested? And why was Sam looking at Steve as though both angry and … was it possible? … a little pitying?
At last, curiosity unquenched he suspected the rest of the letter had been accidentally grabbed by one of the others. But none of them were looking at their laps in baffled fashion: their eyes were still moving quickly along the lines of what looked to be much more satisfying, long letters.
But when Tony skipped down the two stone steps, lilies in hand, it was to find Constable Lang by the pavement. Tony looked at him, startled; he had not counted for this, he had prepared to only evade the fish wives.
Tony, now on the stool, tugged it off the wall. It was heavier than it looked. His arms strained and below his rolled-up sleeves he saw a muscle bulge.
And, indeed, as the saloon door creaked open before them, Tony was revealed, seated at a table, clutching a coffee between his hands.
The old floor under him creaked and cracked. Once or twice he thought he heard something move nearby, but when he paused, he found it to be nothing but a floorboard springing back or work of his guilt-induced paranoia. There was no sign of housemaids, ghosts, evil spirits — nor, thankfully, Jarvis.
“You kinda did,” Steve said coolly, and ducked out the door into the sunlit street, where, now that today’s incident was over, people had started to trickle back outside.
If he had wished this to gain Steve’s sympathies, he was sorely disappointed, for next to Tony, Steve looked as steely as before.
Steve twisted his limbs free to grab his gun, just as Stane lunged and picked up his own from below the scaffolding. Observing the barrel pointed at his forehead, Stane looked amused.
A nurse in long, starched apron walked past with a rattling tray of instruments to one of the ten beds but Steve paid it no mind. He sat there, on a white rickety chair that dug into his vertebra when leaned against, like he had done for the past twenty hours, glancing from Tony’s sleeping form to the blood-caked ring. It had been scarlet and gold when his watch started but was now browning and flaky.
“What do you mean?” Steve said hurriedly, having to raise his voice over Clint’s indignant voice going, ‘What, should we hold off until after lunch? The employee benefits must be out of this world.’
Obie, at last, lifted his gaze and met Tony’s eyes; his looked almost black, deep in the shadow of his brow.
Ms. Althea had seized the pause and was striding the distance between them with a shuffle of silks. Beside Steve, Sharon narrowed her eyes at him one last time before departing into the opposite direction.
Tony felt rather than saw Steve lean close as he, too, peered out of the suddenly very narrow window.
They squeezed through an alley breaking the line, and for a moment they could see nothing but dark walls and the strip of light they were heading towards. It grew as they got closer until, at last, a view of the bay lined with massive factories spread before their eyes that had widened in awe.
“I didn’t grow up with much,” said Steve, now with a feeling of calmness settling into him. “Why should I need more things now?”
“Let’s leave the speculation to a time when we’re better informed,” said Stone, whose glasses glittered in the light trickling in from the hall; the electricity was back.
“I was told you were in need of a ride,” panted Happy, as he reached them, hovering on the cusp of what seemed to be an impulsive hug. “There’s room for four.”
“I’ve been busy, that’s all,” said Steve. “The people are rather distressed at a time like this and it is my duty to help.”
Steve, taken aback by the directness of his speech, took a while to register the last part. “What do you mean ‘no matter what happens?’”
“Mind your step,” he warned, coming upon the glimmering of a Brunswick star at the stairs; a helmeted Constable was inspecting the rope-twist spindles, knelt on the carpet, and moved aside as they passed.
“No need to raise your voice,” said Tony who did not bother to correct her false assumption of his hyper, sleep-deprived state. “I not only hear you, I can see both of you.”
Coulson made a pronounced checkmark against one of his lines. Steve saw his ink pen move four times, twice in one direction and twice in the other. Then he asked, “Unit?”
Never once, in the three years they had been married, had Steve asked where the scars had come from. Why? Had he deep down known it would go unanswered, unconsciously keeping the walls of his badly-put-together marriage up before they came crumbling down on their own in the worst way possible? And why did this lie in particular hurt so much? Steve stared ahead of him without seeing what was going around him and did not notice Sam had gotten up to fetch more water before he set a glass on both Bucky and his hands.
“Fair enough,” Tony said and sat back. He let his raised hands go limp, slapping them against his thighs as they came to rest there. “A week. Done. Agreed.”
“You know,” she started and licked her lips while looking at the eggs, “my poor little Geraldine hasn’t been the same since Gwyneth died. Only nine this month.”
“I got held up giving the police a helping hand,” said Tony, braving a sip of his drink, but got an elbow to his side; liquid dripped onto his fingers, which he sucked on impatiently.
The picture was matt, round-edged and black-bordered, and slightly worn at the corners from being moved in and out of jacket pockets before he had saved the money for an actual frame. From the photograph, Tony’s face stared back at Steve seriously; the glare of the contrasting monochrome had drained him of color and turned his eyes into two dull, black holes.
“Just look at who got what he had always wanted,” Bucky said, standing up again and starting to pace on the corridor outside the cells. “The position as one of the most powerful men in this country … the biggest weapons factory on the western hemisphere … finally feeling as important as he wants!”
They lifted the corona restrictions where I live and I finally was able to spend the midsummer holiday with my family (grandma included), and we got that house sold last Monday! I was busy at calling the bank, printing and copying papers and whatnot the whole week, too.
And, for the first time in what felt like months, Steve laughed. It felt both awkward and absolutely wonderful bubbling up his throat.
“That’s the thing with metal, you’ve got to strike it while it’s—right, I confess,” Tony went on after catching Steve’s look. “I’m overdoing it. We’ve known that. But, honey, I’m
They were standing at the top of a hill sloping steeply down to the water. The sky got bluer further at the sea that glittered in the daylight, occasionally disrupted by a ferry plying the waters. In the middle of the bay stood a large island.
“Oh, I see. What I need,” said Tony, gesturing about the room, “is to get her and I reacquainted. Full cavity search. Top to bottom.”
Here, Rhodey, who had been looking gradually more and more uncomfortable at being waited on, took the plunge, and said, “What if I took—”
“Actually,” he said slowly, “I came here to give you the go ahead to clean the drawing room. We’ve cleared as much as we can from the scene.”
As if thrown by an invisible force, not unlike a heat mirage above hot ground, Stane went airborne—two hundred pounds of limbs and body were lifted in the air like a kite and got flown sixty feet backwards, along with a heavy industrial table. The clatter of it, Steve could have sworn, caused the floor underneath him quake.
In the end, they settled to send forward an invitation to meet at Thor’s, a far-flung saloon belonging to a tall, Scandinavian man, whose place gave the air of an ancient stave church, with its dark wood floor, high arched ceiling and painted murals on all walls.
Steve let the hallway door slip from his grip. Action was all he had wanted these past days, to fill this desire to do something desperate and risky; now, it was being offered to him on a silver platter.
When the door closed again, Rogers’ eyes were flying over the tea-things. He didn’t seem to be taken in with the Old Worcester porcelain so thin one could see the shadow of one’s finger on the other side. In fact, he appeared to be working himself up to something; a muscle slid in his jaw and he started:
It was hard to describe the feelings that rattled across Jarvis’ face right then. Disappointment would not quite be adequate. Shame had Steve’s insides clenching even tighter.
And there were hands reaching towards him: Obie took Tony gently by the armpit; the others were not so courteous: he was pushed and tugged, yanked and hauled by so many arms he could not tell which belonged to whom, nor a word of what was whispered, wondered, by the bystanders at both sides of the rooms he was half-carried through —and, at last, was released at the door of a pantry, only to be violently shoved, with a parting, “Get in, vermin.”
He strode for the mantelpiece, where a pair of binoculars leaned against its marble façade, and through it, took a closer look of the opposing wing. Natasha snapped closed a folder; when she found its proper place, she shoved it in, and turned her shining face to Steve.
“Then I’m sorry to tell you,” Steve told them, looking into Scott’s earnest face, framed in a thin-brimmed brown hat, and wished that he could return a different sentiment. “We lost the heifer in the scuffle. The bull got startled by gunfire.”
Tony felt the shock of both surprise and pleasure. The moment stretched out. Perhaps if he could keep Rogers in a good mood … perhaps if they got through enough of brandy without the head start Tony had had last night…
“Taking a smoke?” repeated Coulson, incredulously. “I’m asked here for a trial from behind a, frankly, monstrous pile of paperwork and all I get is a bunch of no-shows? Now, you will fetch him here, or the next sentence I give, will come very much faster.”
[3] I'm having way too much fun with describing Tony having arguments from elevated places. It's a pattern. I blame Favreau and RDJ afkdkksidkf
“It’d love to sit and chat,” Tony said quickly, emptying his mug and pulling his jacket around his shoulders.  “But work waits for no man. Hey, thanks for the coffee and compassion, Varangian.”
, he said. I have no idea to whom or what there was to tell, but neither knew Stone, from the sound of it.”
The dark car moved slowly — too slowly, for merely trying to gain momentum and get the engine to warm up. It seemed as though it was reluctant to pass Tony, frozen at the pavement, for he had recognized the model … it belonged to Ty’s father.
“Are you doubting my word,” said a man, a livid red flush on his face, walking backwards from the open gate.
Sam blinked at Bucky until, quite suddenly, his bemused expression cleared. “Oh, yes. Big spiders.” He said conversationally, “Remember that saucer-sized wolf spider we had to wrestle out of our kettle last May?”
As soon as the cool metal touched his palm, the room broke into disarray: there were cacophonous cries of discontent and, amidst it all, somebody was laughing rather maniacally; Tony, staring at the key, felt a raising sense of unreality crash upon him. Howard had written that? Tony was still fighting off the mad urge to grab the codicil and see for himself when a chair next to him creaked, and a large hand came to rest, heavily, on his shoulder.
Tony picked up the ring, seemingly just to have something, anything, to do with his hands, even if it meant bringing attention to such a controversial object. He started to clinically chip away the thin crusting of blood with a fingernail, almost uncaring of its origin.
The walls of the room had all been covered in crimson hangings, and the rows of benches had vanished; instead, they lay pushed against the walls and provided seats for the hundred-odd masquerade guests, men, women, and children, who currently mingled at the center of the room.
When the door swung open, Rogers let Tony walk out by himself; however, his eyes followed Tony’s every movement. He had no further comments to offer; he had apparently, incredibly, divested himself of scrupulousness.
pouring that liquid all over the cornerstones,” she finished and looked expectantly up at Steve. “What do you think?”
“Poor Sheriff,” Steve heard one of them whisper as they passed by him in the court hallway. “He must still love him dearly … imagine having to arrest your own husband.”
“Well…” Steve began, watching Tony strut away, but Tony had undergone a startling return to his animated, rambling self.
“Is this a toy, too, my boy?” he asked. “How can you look at yourself and deny that this is anything but the most powerful weapon the world has ever seen?”
“Women in this town just aren’t as cheap as Steve,” Bucky scoffed. “And I refuse to lose to a pint-sized city slicker.”
Naturally, he had thought, with their businesses being so tightly linked, that they would come to work very closely in the upcoming years. He had been impressed to find the sleepy town already under such capable hands, though this had been nothing to how he had felt meeting the taciturn, grey-haired late Mayor Philips.
“Yes, and mostly unhurt,” answered Bruce as he took Steve’s burnt hand in his, and shot a disapproving look down at Steve, “but not for a lack of trying.”
“Sorry, ma’am,” Steve apologized as he pushed past her desk, his steps taking him to the polished dark door, on the other side of which, he could hear voices talking. His fist hovered inches from the door, hesitant.
It hit. Although blunt-edged, its mass was enough to send Tony crashing down on the ground as the beam performed its last ricochet and succeeded in turning in a way that had it connecting with Tony’s terror-struck face as a final insult.
“And she ain’t only one,” said Sam, and started to count with his fingers. “There’s been three fat men, four tall men with mustache, and one bearded cripple, all seen near the bridge around twilight and all wearing a sinister expression.”
Tony trailed off and stared off into nothingness past the sunlit windows. And although Steve saw it, the mad idea that lit Tony’s eyes, he was too late in opening his mouth to stop his husband from saying the next four words:
“Yesterday,” answered Tony in a similar tone. “I caught him trespassing around noon, kicked him out by two. Ask Happy, he’s the chauffer, by the way. Good with faces, if you need to ask about those, too.”
“You’re in good shape,” Tony complimented conversationally as they climbed upstairs. “You still doing those half-day recreations once a week?”
“A dog?” exclaimed Obie, who had just paused mid-bending over the desk in order to snatch a cigar from the malachite box. He scratched at his bald and sighed. “I’ll look into it, but, well—”
In the bedroom, all was well—until he opened the wardrobe and noticed what he in his hurry had missed: half its contents were gone.
The passage outside looked exactly as a respectable manor’s quarters of not usually seen by guests would be expected to look. It was plain, worn and practical. All the staff were out. As far as Tony could see there wasn’t a living soul in sight, not even a rat.
All at once, the fact that the bridge had been burned (and the forge possibly still ablaze), so sorely troubling only a quarter of an hour ago, recurred to Steve now with a disconcerting novelty. The urgency of the situation waved at him like a salvation—a distraction.
Steve turned over the second page of the report, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head and popping his back, he looked around the room for a distraction. It was deserted; even the three cells lined along the corridor on the room out back were empty, and the front door was shut against the late November chill. Suppressing a shiver, Steve let down his arms. It was then, as his forearms came to rest on the desk again, that he came face to face with Tony.
“You’re not a United States marshal,” Bucky said. “Your job is tied to this town. If you leave, there’s gonna be an election—”
“For this bruise?” Steve couldn’t help but ask, part of him enjoying the stupefied looks on their faces. “Did we get them all?”
“Even more reason for you to get out. Thank you, bye-bye. When I want to be saved by a colonist, I now know who to call.”
“I’m afraid that’s impossible,” said Sam in a mollifying tone. “That is, we don’t know where he is.”
“Why the constipated expression?” asked Tony over his shoulder, walking ahead of Rogers along the hall. “Scared of a little banter?”
However, no sooner had he reached the main street than he came to a halt, having spied movement in the distance. Two riders were covering the wild-grass strewn desert floor between them at rapid gallop.
In the end, they left to take their chance at the large hall, trusting the amount of people to turn them invisible. Steve’s mind grappled with the possibilities as they crept back down: they still had the keys which guaranteed that further violation of property could be minimalized. Of course, they did not know whether Pierce was sufficiently important to own keys to Sector 16, and even if he did, the broken door of Stane’s room might trigger a search before they were clear of the factory.
The shadows were already long with sunset by the time Tony walked through the large front doors of Hammer Hall.
An older woman was rushing to him with a rustle of skirts, her bonnet staying atop her silvery hair just by the bow under her chin. She was already speaking, full steam ahead, before she had reached him.
“A state-of-the-art carbon-filament bulb,” Tony explained. “You’re welcome. It runs on a hydro-pneumatic accumulator, which I put under the flooring.”
“Want to try again or should we talk about it?” Steve asked quietly, rubbing a circle into Tony’s palm.
They sipped their teas. An itch was starting under the dressing on Steve’s palm and he fought the urge to scratch it. Bruce’s sharp gaze caught this.
He came to a halt — for a split second, he thought he was seeing a robber inspecting their loot under a table lamp — and then, he slung the blunt sword over his shoulder, clicked the switch on the wall, and said, “Burning the midnight oil, Obie?”
Their investigation had so far lead to the conclusion that both fires had been lit on purpose. And his fury at this faceless pyromaniac broke over him now, like a flood, drowning out every other feeling. Out of naivety they had thought they were on top of everything that happened in this small town and convinced themselves the suspect would be caught within a week; but three days in, there were no clues, no witnesses, no evidence. Whoever did it had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and unseen threats alone and unaided: nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, and now, the town was making a suspect out of Tony.
Then, a hand clamped on his shoulder, remarkably high up the junction of his neck and shoulder, and an oppressive breath misted his ear.
How could he have dreamed of staying in America? Jarvis’ delight at having the house inhabited, and especially at having Tony back, was infectious. He was no longer the grieving man from the funeral; now he seemed determined that Tony and Rhodey should enjoy as much, if not more than they would have done had the body not been found, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Obie’s arrival. Everything metallic was polished into high gleam; the winter dessert service was replaced by a more seasonally appropriate Spode in the bull cabinet of the dining room, and, at last, the door to the master bedroom was opened to air it out for the first time in weeks. The only room that remained untouched by this one-man pursuit to pretend nothing was amiss was the drawing room.
—always with an indefinite date in mind to postpone it and take it off his mind for the time being. Steve wondered if Tony had sensed that continuing thigs as they were had always seemed easiest to him. Had Tony become frustrated by his lack of decisiveness?
“I saw death,” he said. “Sometimes I dreamt of losing you. I felt it. It was my fault, I knew it. I dreamed of war. I dreamed of you fighting in it and of you dying from my weapons. It was easier to not sleep.”
“Something I’ve worked on,” Tony told him as he opened the folds to reveal the dark blue jacket. “It was … it was supposed to be an anniversary present, but, uh … yeah,” Tony trailed off. “Throw it away, tear it to shreds … I don’t care. Sentimentality isn’t part of my winning personality, but it just might be yours.”
As the cries faded, Stane, with a sneer, backed up onto the steps of the church. Both kept their guns targeted on one another, and Steve, who had just survived what should have been a fatal shot, followed. The closer he got, the more astonished and almost fearful Stane became, and the higher he climbed—until his feet ran out of steps and met with the even surface of the landing…
“Did I?” Tony’s voice still held that hysteric note. “I suppose so. I hated both of you, but I won’t forgive you for the murder of my mama.”
“One more thing,” hissed Stern’s voice. “It’s an awkward position you’ve driven us in. One has to treat you as usual out of loyalty to your father, of course, but hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at treating something to eat to a murderer.”
“No, not without you. Tony, these people,” Steve started slowly, “are akin to thieves and murderers. You’re nothing like them—”
“Funny you should ask that,” Steve said, and sat down by their trestle table. A kettle whistled in the kitchen. While Tony disappeared behind the corner, Steve placed the newspaper next to him as a reminder of what he wanted to ask. However, when Tony returned to set the table with their plain, casual dinner set, it turned out Steve didn’t have to bring it up after all.
“Me,” she replied simply. “And I am frankly astonished I’ve not been heard earlier. You see, I had trouble sleeping on the night of the fires. There had been such a horrible racket coming from the forge—more than usual. I… happened to be at the window, the one overseeing the front door of the forge, and I saw something.”
He handed Fury back the ‘report’ that they were supposed to be discussing, which was merely a copy of the new bridge’s costs in the meticulous handwriting of Ms. Hill. Fury accepted it with a rather unnerving return to his earlier casualness as he watched Steve make his way back to the meeting.
“Natasha will be cross now that her cover’s blown,” said Rogers, seemingly finding humour in something.
“Correct, sir, in a week. It’s when I often bring flowers to the mausoleum, so you must forgive me for not writing back right away. I was at first unwilling to break the tradition.”
At home, he began to stride blindly around the rooms, opening half-empty wardrobes and chests and picking up clothes only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Jarvis echoed in his head:
“She’s out of your league,” said Sam. “Anyway, see that dent the guy made on the street once I knocked him down? I could show you the bruise on his face.”
The men in question looked up when caught, standing by the showcase of the floral shop. It wasn’t Hammer, or Stone — it was, however, something almost as abominable. With a familiar expression of dark-lashed dislike, Inspector Rogers took in the streets spreading around him in either direction, until finally meeting Tony’s eyes, that narrowed behind his shades; even his occupied mind
Tony stared out of the window at the inky, blue-black sky. It had been enough of a shock to be strangled; it was even more disconcerting to find out a group of angry old men might murder him in his bed tonight if he wasn’t behind bars. He doubted very much that his being free would stay a secret long in the town. As he well knew, the only thing connecting the first death and the second attempted one was
be ringing your Sheriff-y sense. I want you to swear to me you won’t let him drag you into his madness, no matter what happens.”
Down a set of stairs, they came to a hot, low-ceilinged engine room, where coal was being burned to keep the engines running. Just the heat had them abandon their aprons at the entry. The cogs of the hall above had been nothing compared to this: the great hum of machines was so loud they could feel it churn inside their chests like a heartbeat.
“Then where’s that purple-toned collar around your throat from?” asked Rhodey, finger pointing at the general direction of Tony’s neck.
“We’re all full of electricity, Steve. It’s how the human body works,” Tony started but became sheepish as he observed on Steve’s face a mixture of grief and accumulating fury.
He could ask none them. Instead, Tony tucked himself silently in the backseat, and they took off. Yet, after having driven for barely half a mile, the car slowed to a crawl and stopped. Steve, bent low over the wheel, bit his lip, staring at the dark night encompassing them. His straw-blond locks had fallen over his forehead.
“It’s cutting edge,” Bruce continued to gush, and Steve watched him bend down and pick up a bottle from his medical bag, all the while Bruce kept up a seamless dialogue on scar tissue.
The following expression was the more terrible because Steve had never expected or dreamed that he could ever see such a look on Tony’s face: being hit by a beam, getting struck by electricity, none of it had left Tony looking this vulnerable.
The Sheriff’s Office was lit by a lone orange-colored gaslight that started swinging wildly in the ceiling once they opened the door and brought in both the rustler and the risen gusts of westerly. The wind tore through the front room into the back towards the holding cells, and from behind a flapping copy of today’s newspaper peeked two spurred boots. As they frog marched the rustler into the back towards the holding cells, a corner of it folded down to reveal Clint’s quizzical face.
Next, something worse carried to them: a giggle. It was the first time Steve had heard the voice in months; he had almost forgotten how inopportune it can be.
Steve had been expecting the topic to come up ever since Clint warned him, but he found himself tensing as he forced himself to look Fury directly in the eyes, noticing as he did so that the patch was definitely Tony’s handiwork, from the quality of the leather to the neat stitching. This did not help.
Steve looked around. Happy Hogan was hurrying past the lingering people. Beyond him, far across the grounds, Steve could see Ms. Pym chase a little girl hurtling through the crowds at full speed.
Tony’s heart was pumping rather fast again as he bent closer, his head almost inside the safe: yellowing papers of various sizes lay in listing stacks, money was tucked at the furthermost corner and — Tony’s insides felt suddenly loose and watery — his mother’s jewellery occupied the shelf closest to him.
Tony endured this stoically, reaching to grab a salmon sandwich as soon as they were set down on the spindle-legged side table.
“You know, when you’ve got a lot of time to think, it’s funny what you remember. It’s the moments that you skated over,” he said, addressing his drink. “I told Tony I was scared of what he did. The look on his face … I don’t think he got what I meant, which part of it I truly was afraid of. Plenty people know what my father did, why I never step a foot in here, and Tony … you don’t think he thought I’d become afraid of
“It’s because you’re scaring me,” Steve said; the truth felt raw. “I know where the story ends if you don’t stop.”
“What’s to come of this?” said Bucky. “What are they going to say to people? I imagine it’s going to be hard to shrug everything off as just an earthquake, given the amount of witnesses.”
“Yes,” said Fury, who stopped rooting through his safe right when the door of the room opened. “As a matter of fact, I already took the liberty of inviting them here.”
“The president-elect? Wasn’t he born in Brooklyn?” Sam asked, walking over to look at the paper over Steve’s shoulder. He met Steve’s gaze. “You’re from there. Any idea what he did to deserve it?”
Steve felt his chest swell so quickly he was surprised to find his feet still firmly on the floor: Tony had laid on the table his left hand, which had previously been held out of sight, and Steve spied the ring still in its usual place. Incredibly, impossibly, hope surged inside him.
Steve bit his lip, then snatched the envelope. He flipped it open, took out the folded letter and one-handedly shook it open. Unsigned, unaddressed, it only contained one line:
And sure enough, Justin Hammer and his smarmy smile swept over impetuously past the glass vases brimming with roses.
Tony could no longer stay still with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he walked around his untouched bag, slipping out of the room and strode along the panelled passage outside.
Ten to one, though, the walnut doors swung open on their own accord and in walked a woman, whose hard-soled heels clicked as she approached, slowly and purposefully, to the desk surrounded by walls and walls of volumes.
“I hate to see you like this,” Rhodey said, voice respectfully soft, but echoing bleakly. “You’re my best friend, Tony.”
It was Stern. He and several others were closing in on Tony, who tried to pull his tuxedo closed as he faced them. Stern’s face was taut with glee.
Their horses were saddled; tied to the back of a stage. Steve and Tony were waiting in the crowded station yard of Julesburg with the rest of the company for a promised ride that would take them back home. It was a beautiful December’s day. Steve supposed the weather would remain so, when they arrived there in a day’s time. The thought of clear snow and glittered sun gave him much more pleasure than it would have a week ago.
Hours later, after gaining several blisters from shaving an old board to replace the broken axel and hammering back together the bent wheel; grimy from wiping heir sweaty foreheads on their dusty sleeves, they were able to send off Scott and his borrowed mule-driven wagon on their journey northwards to home.
Steve got a shock to find himself at the top. From there, he walked along a short passage, at the very end of which a door stood ajar and cast a long strip of gold across the carpeted floor.
Silence fell between the two of them as they looked up at the house. There was no sign of movement; the windows stared back, gleaming in the reflected daylight.
“During his last days here, Tony received a lot of letters,” Bruce went on. “I didn’t know he was in contact with people from his past.”
“Now,” Pierce said, “whoever is in charge, I have two conditions. Nothing is to be touched. Nothing. And you must not leave this spot right here until I return for you. Understood?”
“Well,” said Pym, looking unblinkingly at Steve, “let the man have his wish. Come on then, I’ll give you a tour.”
“I swear you won’t,” said Steve, both chilled and elated at such an open expression of love from his husband. “I won’t let him.”
By the car, unseen by them, Barnes opened and shut the door. The bang, however, awoke them to his presence. Roger’s flustered expression cleared. He ripped a page from his booklet, on which spelled a line of instructions.
“That expression you have when you oversee the usual burials … I could only imagine what it would be like if it were me in that coffin. Sometimes lying awake at night I imagined what you’d write on the stone. Something tear-jerking and romantic, as is your usual style—only a little bit tacky.”
“Women,” scoffed Clint, but adopted a visibly less scornful look at Natasha’s withering glare. “I think the stagecoach driver is going to string us up by his reins next time he passes through.”
“’Suppose I should ask Bruce whether his surgical spirit repertory had experienced any shortfall as of late?” Steve said before he could bite his tongue.
As Jarvis set the tray on the desk, Tony sensed Rogers stealing looks at him, which both thrilled and unnerved Tony. He lifted his eyes to Roger’s. This was a mistake; they gazed at each other as the atmosphere, already tense, became stifling.
“But, hey,” said Tony in a changed tone, “there’s actually two people you could meet now that the threat is over. Maybe I’ll send them mail someday, ask them how they are,” Tony mused, and Steve wondered either of these were behind the penmanship of the date at the back of the photograph.
