He peeked out from Tony’s shoulder. Upon seeing his papa, Peter put his arms out. Steve was all too willing to oblige. Tony wrapped his arms around both Peter and Steve, making a sandwich out of Peter. Until Peter lifted his head so quickly that he almost broke Tony’s nose.
Laura just laughed from her spot on the couch. Nathaniel was just settling down for a nap or else she would have been right next to her husband.
In the years that followed, nothing was ever perfect. Not that their lives had ever been close to perfect in the first place, everyone made it perfectly clear to Peggy that none of this was her fault. Nothing was perfect but they were getting there. The nightmares were less and less frequent, only really showing up if something had triggering had happened that day.
“Peter Parker Stark-Rogers. Did you really think you could get out of here? I must admit though, seeing your spider skills was most impressive. We may just have to test those later.” He paused, Peter wasn’t sure why, “For now though, we shall wait for your sister to wake up. I do hope she doesn’t have anymore of those pesky nightmares.”
Steve laughed up until he heard her sharp intake of air. He looked down at his wife. Her eyes were as big as the shield, staring at the stick in her hands. He waited for Toni to look up.
A look of pure relief washed over Steve’s face, “Well, there’s a lot of movies on my catch up list that I haven’t watched yet. We could pick one from there?”
Sharon was still desperately trying to calm Peggy down. She and Pepper had tried everything. You name it, they had tried it over the course of the last 14 hours. Peggy had taken a short nap right after the team had called to say they were on their way home, but other than that, Peggy had cried almost non-stop. Usually, Peggy just cried, there weren’t words or anything to go along with the crying. Now though? The crying was constantly interspersed with Peggy’s heartbreaking pleas.
At that, Thor broke open the doors. They had been surprised to find no guards outside, but figured there’d be plenty to do once they got inside. Steve stepped in front with the shield as the bullets started to fly.
Steve was the first to speak up, “What do you ‘if something happens’ bud? Can you help us understand a little bit?”
Natasha was about to speak when Bucky’s frantic voice came over the speakers, “Steve! You need to get up here, right now! I don’t mean in five minutes punk, I mean now!”
“Peter, Peggy, I want you to go to the living room. Mickey Mouse is on. Stay there for now, okay?” Steve was looking directly at Tony as he said this.
Peggy woke up. Peggy woke up and she was warm and in a bed. Peggy woke up and didn’t know if she was actually home, or if this was another nightmare. It looked like home, but so had the dreams. It smelt like home, but so had the dreams. But daddy and papa had never been in the dreams and they were both here. She was in daddy and papa’s bed, snuggled between them. But how was she supposed to know if she was really home or not?
Steve didn’t even wait to ask JARVIS for entrance, he just started banging on the shop doors, begging Tony to let him in.
Of course, Steve made his way over to her and tipped her chin up to look him in the eye. When Toni met his eyes, she almost gasped. The baby blue eyes that had always held so much love were looking straight into her soul. There was a feeling of deja vu; these were the eyes that she had fallen in love with. These eyes that were so centered but simultaneously everywhere at once.
“What happened? Where did we go wrong Steve? What could I have done better? They can’t be gone Steve, they just can’t !”
Steve sat down on the bed and wrapped an arm around Peter’s shoulders, “I’m sorry, Peter. She didn’t make it. The baby’s gone.”
Peggy was happy with Tony, but saw Steve and immediately reached out for him. It probably helped that Steve was also carrying Peter, who was on the verge of crying again. Steve sat down on the couch with both of the kids snuggled on top of him. He motioned for Tony to go talk to Pepper and Sharon, he could handle them both for a bit.
Peggy was crying, not like she usually did. Usually, when Peggy cried, everyone knew about it, she was loud. Now though, she just had tears running down her face. Peter scrambled over to her, knowing there had to be a way to wake her up.
JARVIS’s response was the same that it had been for the last three hours, “Sir has instructed me to not let calls through that do not detail a world ending catastrophe. You are welcome to leave a message, which I can relay at a later time.”
Peggy remembered her principal coming into the room with someone she didn’t recognize. She was called out of class, and went with the principal. Papa always told her to listen to her teachers. They went out of the classroom, and then the new man knocked out the principal. He picked Peggy off and started running. Peggy was going to scream for help, but then the needle plunged into her neck. After that, she thought she remembered being thrown into a van. But she definitely remembered the darkness.
He was still sifting through his thoughts, when the elevator doors opened. Natasha walked out, took one look at him, and had him in a hug in the next five seconds.
It had to be a dream. This whole thing had to be a dream. There was no way dad could have been in Afghanistan. He hadn’t been,there’d been no beatings in Afghanistan, just the water. Obie couldn’t have been in space, the arc reactor wasn’t gone when he was in space, he just couldn’t breathe. He wasn’t paralyzed in space either. There was no way this was real.  This feeling was familiar, but Tony couldn’t quite place it. He knew what he was seeing wasn’t real, but couldn’t find a way out. He felt the cold sweat of terror running down his neck. He felt the familiar shakes in his hands. He felt the air leaving his lungs for the last time.
Peggy’s biological parents? Not so much luck. He didn’t have anything to go off of. There hadn’t been cameras on the fire station where Peggy had been left and other than the clothes on her back, Peggy had been left with nothing. But hell would freeze over before Tony would stop looking. Those pieces of shit had hurt his little girl and they were gonna pay, no matter what the cost.
It didn’t even begin to prepare Toni for seeing Steve. Because when she walked into that hospital room? She almost started crying all over again. Her husband, her Steve, the man who had always seemed so invincible was laying in a hospital bed. His face was almost as white as his sheets, he was hooked up to a ventilator, and was to so many other machines, that Toni didn’t even want to count them all.
down the door. Stepping inside, he almost wanted to step right back out. There were traces of Peter everywhere in this room and not in a good way.
The twins were housed on the floor under all the teams’. It kept them fairly close to people Tony and Steve trusted, but not so close that it would make anyone twitchy. JARVIS had the floor on lockdown, ensuring that neither of them could get out and there were SHIELD agents patrolling the exterior of the building 24/7 now.
JARVIS responded immediately, “I believe Sir has woken from a night terror, I believe it to be safe to touch him, although I advise proceeding with caution.”
Wanda stomped off, fuming, planning, and not being able to believe how naïve her brother was being. The next person that came through the elevator doors was hers, her brother could go fuck himself.
“I just want to sleep Steve. According to JARVIS, I’ve been awake for 72 hours and counting. I need some sleep and then everything will be right as rain. Right, J?”
The couple didn’t wake up until afternoon the next day. But the important thing? They woke up together. They woke up together for the first time in almost two months. They woke up together with smiles on their faces and lazy good morning kisses. They woke up together and JARVIS notified them that Bucky had taken the kids to his floor for the day. They woke up together and ate together and talked together. For an entire day, they did absolutely everything together. It was like being on their honeymoon all over again.
,” Peter blurted out, fast and acute, balled his fists in courage, and that shut Tony up. “When I agreed to come over here, I didn’t think we were going to do
At that, Steve took a stool nearby, sat on it in front of Tony with seriousness. “There was a desk, full of things.”
He left him standing in the space, surrounded by the tables, impacted by a soldered hole in his chest where his curiosity lie.
In the evenings, mainly towards the end of the week, Fury would allow Tony to work until a later time. This benefited him greatly; he could put more effort into his own situation, as his days had evidently been preoccupied with the others he chose to allocate his focus to. Amongst all the chaos, his blue and
Tony believed he had communicated enough to Peter, who stood timid and equally ashamed and a bit wobbly from all the exertion and intimidation. Satisfied, he nodded, began to back out in the same way he did before to retrieve the football, but this time now towards the adjoining hallway and to the exit.
“It’s okay.” He glanced down again, pouted as though he were checking a watch for the time. “Colour's quite nice.”
about seeing someone voluntarily repeat an action of pain, as opposed to falling onto soft grass and hobbling off without injury. It plagued in them a deeper concern, and it was one that had to be grown, rather than being smacked upon them at the release of adrenaline.
“I could cough right now, and Yale would come knocking.” He tipped his head. “I’d prefer to go elsewhere, though. You happened to get MIT in on your little deal, by any chance?”
“Neither am I,” Tony said, shrugged off his blazer, “but I feel like the machinery in here will suffice.”
. His entire demeanour was solid and odd; Steve had always acted at his most politest and naïve, and that didn’t include whatever removed scowl he happened to be projecting straight at Tony.
Tony looked down at his chest, felt around the smooth metal edge. "Makes me a little more experienced than the average teenager, apparently.”
Peter said nothing. He looked frantically around on the floor, and then at the thing he had just halted. His eyes broadened in a realisation personal to him: he hadn’t passed out.
“It isn’t,” he said, and breathed into proper explanation. “I attend this school on scholarship. All those clubs and sports and activities... I… I just do them to keep up appearances. If they—if
“He’s gotten stuck, hasn’t he?” Bruce scoffed, looked away in incredulity. He took proper hold of his folder lab coat, put it over his own forearm, and gave an apologetic, frustrated expression before attempting to skirt around Peter. “I’m sorry. I’m not getting into this again.”
And Tony examined Bruce for the first time in a while. He was tired, sad at the sight of him, with eyes of umber that were now just
through association, nevertheless—and be locked within its grasp to be considered statured. He was, already, a Stark. Why he’d need a leg-up in the manner his principal was suggesting seemed… ill-fitting. Suspicious, almost. Tony could sense it.
While a few students managed to look up at him from the potency of their concentration, none of them gave him any particular thought, which definitely didn’t help Peter’s case. He gulped in a questioning stasis of what he had to do next. Peter looked around, nervously. What was he looking for, again?
When he had decided to approach Tony and Steve in the facility, an existence of relatability seemed to have been waiting for him.
Steve underwent unsmiling reflection. “Judging from the state of my surroundings as I start to remember things, that’s my best guess.”
And after a moment or so of gaping at the back of Tony’s head, wondering where the conversation wilted—waiting for
Coulson joined his hands again. “Tony, after your…incident, it occurred to us that it is indeed a pertinent issue many students, with ample talent, are being preoccupied by lesser ventures.”
meet, and at least two sports. Tony swore there was a third, but he gave up trying to figure that one out.
Tony swung his backpack around to the front of him, fished between the open zipper for his missing book. Steve examined him, noticed something he recognised. “You look very familiar,” he blurted out. “I’ve seen you around before, haven’t I?”
bulbous chest had been waiting patiently for an opening in his time. It was thanks to Fury’s compassion that it could find one.
before. Are you implying that, at this point, you’d be awake and moving around without your knowledge?
, guys,” Peter said, looked around apologetically at his chorus, gripped his lyrics folder nervously. “But I just
His principal ceased his explanation. “Well, are you working on an extended project, by any chance?”
“Then why does something tell me that my involvement would work purely on your advantage?” Tony, now, interlaced his fingers to compete formality, quirked an eyebrow too. “Prove me wrong."
“Could you at least try?” Steve asked. He put his hand flat on the table next to the stool. “And if he doesn’t pick up, then so be it.”
They had been home a week when Steve popped the question. Thinking back on it, Toni should have suspected all along, but in her defense, she needed to upgrade Steve’s suit and get that facial recognition software done. It was only when she finished and went up to the penthouse that she realized something was up.
Peggy mumbled something in her sleep but otherwise, was dead to the world. Peter knew he wasn’t going to get any help from her. He just hoped papa and daddy realized they were gone. He didn’t know how to get out by himself. The first thing he tried was the vent in the ceiling, but couldn’t manage to pry it off and keep himself up. That escape route was out. He thought Peggy might be able to fit through the bars, but what good would that do? They didn’t know where they were and Peggy wouldn’t know how to call anyone if she could find a phone. He was still busy thinking when the man in black came back. Peter pulled Peggy and himself against the wall at the back of the cell, in an effort to protect them. The man just laughed.
When Steve finally made it to the kitchen, he couldn’t help but smile. Tony was making pancakes and the kids were “helping”. More than anything, they were making a mess with the flour and chocolate chips and blueberries, but they were happy and Tony was laughing and Steve thought it might have been the most wonderful thing he had seen or heard in a while.
Tony looked at the ceiling (damn it Steve!) with annoyance, “Okay fine you tattletale! You’re going to the nearest community college ASAP!”
When the homing beacon went off, the team was loaded in the QuinJet in under two minutes. There were looks of grim determination on all of their faces. Peter had somehow managed to activate the beacon, but at what cost? They knew HYDRA wasn’t opposed to torturing Peter. And if Peter had somehow made contact with JARVIS, there would be hell to pay. Nobody talked, but they were all thinking the same thing, would he be alive?
Minutes later, Tony and Steve were peeling out of the garage. The idiots had been stupid enough to have their unwanted daughter in a hospital. A hospital which had DNA records. Records that could be traced back to their origins.
“His brain activity indicates that it’s entirely possible, Mrs. Stark. As of right now, it’s a waiting game.” The doctor was fiddling with a pen while he talked. If he was nervous, that couldn’t be a good thing.
Ten minutes later, they were all piled in the limo, just a few minutes off of the meticulous schedule that Pepper had put together for today. Honestly, Steve was surprised they made it out of the tower at all. Every time they were about to leave, someone forgot something. Commanding a battlefield was easy. Herding a bunch of people into the car on time, now that was a completely different situation.
When they broke apart, Steve was crying again, and Tony was thinking about joining him. Tony pulled Steve back into his arms, partially because Steve was crying again, but partially to hide his tears.
“Alright Cap, I know I’m not getting out of this conversation anytime soon, so what do you want to know? Actually, I should say, what do I need to say to get you to leave?” Tony really didn’t want to talk about it, now or ever really, but he knew that it was inevitable now.
Throwing the covers off, Tony got up. He threw Peggy over his shoulder, she squealed in delight. Peter tried to get away, but not before Tony had him under one arm, carrying them both towards the kitchen, the air filled with joyous squeals.
Without an answer, Tony just interlaced his fingers with Steve’s, dropping a gentle kiss on his lips.
Steve had stopped pacing and was now looking out the windows, “I understand when you get busy, it’s happened before. But never in the seven years we’ve been married have you been ‘live in the shop for six weeks’ kind of busy.”
“Tony, couldn’t you make a phony version of the suit? Make it look and feel the same, but not give it any of the weapons systems? Don’t give them anything important, but give them what they want at the same time? If JARVIS is running the suit, we’d be able to track where they take it and maybe find Peter.”
“Where have you guys been?!? Nat said that you went on a two week vacation and didn’t tell anyone anything! I’ve been worried sick! You guys can’t just run off on me, what if something happened?”
Meanwhile, Nick Fury was trying to contact anyone currently residing in Avengers Tower. Much to his chagrin, JARVIS was blocking all calls that didn’t pertain to a world ending catastrophe.
Steve was busy setting up detonators while Tony worked, “Nope, we’ll sort it later. Just get everything. We’re gonna blow this place skyhigh in a few minutes.”
“Actually, that’s how she got my attention. She asked me if we had ever considered finding Peggy a therapist. She started the conversation with it and we never came back to the subject.
And then of course, Peggy picked that minute to come flying into their bedroom as well. She joined her brother in jumping on the bed, continuously trying to wake up their parents.
They were laying in bed, just being together, when Steve started talking, “Promise me you’ll talk to me?”
“Yeah, I think so. I don’t think it can get any better than this.” Toni was leaning on her husband, in serious danger of falling asleep.
The man started laughing, “Your parents aren’t coming for you little girl. They’ve left you, just like your first parents. None of them wanted you, nobody will ever want you. Nobody is coming for you.”
The grin on Tony’s face outweighed his sassy, sarcastic tone, “Glad we could get that worked out, babe.”
In unison, Tony and Steve groaned, the kids whined, but they all got up from the table. Bucky and Pepper had already been notified. They were in the penthouse within the next five minutes.
His eyes looked down and then met hers for half a second. That was all the time Toni needed to recognize the look in Steve’s eyes. She was already sobbing by the time Steve lifted her into his arms, making his way towards the garage.
Steve shuddered at his words, “Please don’t say that, because I know you mean it. I can’t lose you too, not after everyone else.”
The captors hadn’t said anything. They showed Peggy and Peter, locked in the same cell. Peggy looked relatively unscathed, but Peter? Peter looked like he had been through hell and back. He was shirtless, and there were scars up and down his chest and back. Clearly, they had been much worse earlier, but due to his heightened healing abilities, they were just beginning to scar over. Surprisingly, Peter didn’t look frightened, in fact, he looked almost defiant. Like he was daring his captors to try anything more. He knew exactly who his family was, and knew they would find him, he just had to hold on. The video had one more thing to say, there was a sign at the end of the video. It demanded that Tony turn over the armor by the next day. If it was dropped off in the locker at Grand Central Station tomorrow by noon, Peggy would be returned by 6 pm. The sign made no mention of Peter or the captors wanting money or anything from Steve.
It was surprising that Peter hadn’t woken up when he heard Peggy crying. The boy was an oddly light sleeper. Bruce thought that it might have to do with his spider powers, but no one knew for sure. Tony just carried Peter to his room. After tucking him into bed, he returned to the living room, wanting to help Steve with Peggy.
Peter stopped laughing, knowing he couldn’t very well tell them that they had been given a phony. More than likely though, JARVIS was still in the suit. If JARVIS was there, Peter had a chance of getting home. He only hoped that the man was telling the truth, that Peggy was home. Refusing to talk was probably a bad idea, but it wasn’t like he had another choice. He couldn’t tell them that the suit was a fake, that would give away any chance he had of getting to JARVIS. Surely daddy hadn’t sent the suit without some form of JARVIS in it, right?
Peter continued to talk through his sobbing, “But I don’t want you to go! I don’t want to be by myself! Please don’t go!”
Tony was muttering to himself about facial recognition programs, finally having cracked all of the encryptions on the HYDRA files. JARVIS interrupted him.
The cravings were the weirdest fucking thing ever though. Because instead of wanting normal food things, Toni would wake up in the middle of the night, craving things like Clif bars topped with ice cream. Steve, being the absolute angel he was, would dutifully get up and go get or make the food. Toni didn’t think she had ever loved her husband more.
“Oh sweetheart,” Tony walked over and picked Peggy up out of bed, “let’s get you cleaned up huh?” He walked towards the bathroom where JARVIS already had the bath running. Peggy’s clothes were wet and stained with puke. Tony just peeled them off and checked the water. Not too hot but not too cold either. He put Peggy in the tub just as Steve walked in with Peter. Peter looked just as bad as Peggy did, if not worse. Both of the kids were still crying, but they also desperately needed baths. Steve and Tony did their best to calm them down while getting them clean, hoping that they wouldn’t throw up again until after they were out of the bath.
Pietro had Peter in his arms in a split second, dashing them both over to the open workbench where Steve was putting out the food. Tony followed behind them at a normal pace, laughing at the boys’ eagerness to get to food. Steve leaned down to kiss his husband and then his daughter, who was tugging on the bottom shirt impatiently. Eventually, the family settled around the workbench, eating, talking, and laughing about their day.
The speedster’s head was buried in the fridge, so his response was mumbled, “No, but it’s really not so bad, is it? I mean, we get our own floor, unlimited access to just about anything we could want,
Peggy just whined, not wanting to let go, but knowing that she had to. “Don’t want you or daddy to go, papa. Want you to stay here.”
Steve got the blanket, wrapping Tony as best he could. He ended up just tucking Tony into his side, trying his best to warm him up. Steve knew that Tony had issues, the whole team did. They tried not to ask questions about the past unless it was absolutely necessary, knowing memories could dredge up painful feelings that no one wanted to remember. Asking questions wasn’t always a good idea. However, in this situation, Steve felt like he had no other choice. Tony was visibly shaken by his nightmare, enough that he couldn’t really talk. And if Tony Stark wasn’t talking? That was the biggest red flag you could get.
“How the hell did they get from here to New York in six hours? The Quin’s top of the line and we just barely got here in seven. What kind of technology do these bastards have now?” Tony was griping, mostly to mask the fear that was coursing through him.
Sam and Natasha had both tried questioning him, after they had found that he wasn’t going to attack anyone. They had gotten no response. Sam had gone first and gotten blank stares. Natasha took a turn, thinking that maybe if they tried a different language he might respond differently. She had gotten a different kind of stare, but no verbal or physical response.
“Oh, thank god you’re all here! I thought you weren’t going to make it! Steve, we had a Pepper designed schedule! What happened?”
He was met with silence for a moment before Rhodey stepped forward, “Tones, the man was with HYDRA. We thought Nat had him on the ropes, and then he popped a cyanide pill before anyone could do anything. I’m sorry.”
Finally, Tony just thought, “Fuck it,” and hugged Steve as best he could. Considering Steve was slightly taller, and much more muscular, it was harder than he expected. Tony continued breathing deeply, hoping that with the closer contact, Steve would start breathing easier.
It was a unspoken rule in the tower that no one talked about their pasts, and no one asked. Nobody had ever said anything about this being a rule, it had never been written down either, but no one ever had to. The team was smart enough to know that asking would lead to doors no one wanted to open, and they all realized that asking was unnecessary. So no one ever did.
Tony looked like he could see straight through what Cap was trying to do, “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing here Rogers. But. I’ll indulge you, only because we get stuck watching Titanic later.” After a pause, he added, “What movie were you thinking?”
Tony didn’t have much to offer Steve. Sure, he was rich, but Steve wasn’t interested in money. He knew what they had going was good, but just wasn’t’ entirely sure Steve wanted to be with him more than Barnes. So excuse him for being slightly apprehensive about welcoming the guy into his home with open arms. Especially considering the guy had tried to
Tony rolled over in bed and groaned. Steve just laughed at him, “You know you make the better pancakes, babe. They haven’t had them in ages.”
A few rooms over, their captors had cameras on Grand Central Station. Specifically on locker 12B. They saw Sam and Rhodey putting the suit inside.
Tony thought he was getting better. At first with the team moving in, his anxiety was worse. But he soon figured out that he trusted these people, to a point. He figured out that having other people around was helpful sometimes, and other times annoying but that was besides the point. It was nice to have Bruce to bounce ideas off of. It was nice to be able to call Thor or Steve if an extra hand was needed in the shop, because let’s be honest, DUM-E wasn’t super dependable.
Rhodey and Sam were with her when the machines changed tune just a bit. The whole team had been hearing the same steady, slow beeping pattern for the entire week. They were all intimately aware of any and all changes in the rhythms.
When the two finally came out of the kitchen with their coffee, they almost busted out laughing. Their children were both sitting by their truly
popped up. One second, they were wading through dozens of HYDRA goons and the next second there was guy with a metal arm. Which admittedly, was pretty cool, but Tony wanted to get to his son. Even tag teaming him, Steve and he weren’t getting anywhere. He sent Peter’s location to Rhodey, briefing him on the situation. Steve added on,
That single word had the weight of the last year crashing down around Toni and with that weight came her walls. Toni started crying with Peter and soon, the whole team was wrapped around them. All of them together as they hadn’t been in forever.
Would anyone be opposed to me jumping forward to them trying to find a solution to Peggy's nightmares? I don't know that I could write enough to get to that filler. Just leave me a comment with your opinion? Thanks!
It turned out that Pepper did have work to talk about. There was a company in Estonia (of all places!) that had something to offer to SI. They wanted both Pepper and Tony to fly out and meet with them next week. They were both on the fence about it. On top of that, SHIELD was trying to get some tech updated but they didn’t necessarily want to pay fees. Tony promised to sic Steve on Fury.
Peter just huffed, but he did turn around to walk into the building. He turned back around after a few steps though.
That night though, the unthinkable happened. Toni woke up, a sense of absolute dread spreading through her at the damp feeling in between her legs and the agonizing pain spreading through her belly. She didn’t need to look down to see the red spreading over the white sheets of the bed.
Steve took one look at Peggy’s puppy eyes and agreed. It was hard to withstand those things, they were irresistible.
Somehow, an hour and a half later, Tony and Steve were flying back to the tower. With a SHIELD convoy driving below them, driving the Maximoff twins to the tower. Steve wasn’t entirely sure
Tony looked at Nat, Nat looked at Bruce and they all just knew. Steve would need everyone today. Which meant that no one was leaving. It meant that they weren’t leaving Steve alone at all today. Because SHIELD might have thought he was fine, but they all knew better.
The family piled into the car, driving along to the sounds of Peter telling everyone about his fantastic first day at school.
not four hours ago. Since then I’ve been trying to get a hold of any member of the team. That’s all I want to do, talk!”
Pietro ran to get it. Coming back, he was slightly slower, given that the basket was a special order from Wakanda. The thing was truly the biggest basket that any of them had ever seen. When Pietro finally managed to drag it out to the living room, he and his siblings started going through the baskets. Steve and Tony settled back on the couch, both of them with massive grins on their faces at the joy radiating around the room.
“And think about what Tony would want you to be doing right now. Would he want you beating your hands to a bloody pulp on the punching bag, or would he want you to find a way to help?”
The door opened again, revealing several more men. They were dragging with them what they thought was the Iron Man suit.
The next three weeks were filled with Steve showing Toni everything he had found to put in the nursery. They didn’t actually order anything, Nat had demanded that she and Pepper get to throw them a baby shower. Toni didn’t doubt that all they’d have to buy was the furniture.
Peter was the first to speak up, ‘Yeah daddy! Lots of fun! Aunty Tasha came over and then Uncle Clint came over and then we made volcanoes from soap and vinegar and this weird white stuff.” Peter paused to breathe, “But daddy, we haven’t seen you in ages! Where have you been?”
The adults received eager nods from all of the kids. Steve blew the whistle and they were all off like a shot. Pietro had Peter on his back and Wanda was making the other three fly. The younger four were all laughing their heads off.
“I-I’m sorry I called you mom earlier. I k-know that you’re n-not. But I haven’t seen you in ages and a-all Pepper could tell us w-was that you were alive and I d-didn’t know if I’d ever see you again and I just-”
Both Tony and Steve rolled over to face each other in the middle of their bed. Neither of them liked getting up early, but they had both stayed up particularly late getting Easter set up for today. And then they had some fun of their own before they had gone to bed the night before. They gave each other knowing looks before they simultaneously rolled out of bed, making both of their children squeal in glee and delight.
Tears were still streaming down Steve’s face, “I’m not leaving, Tony. Not now, not ever. Til death do us part, remember?”
If they could have read each other’s minds at that moment, there would have been mirrored thoughts. Because they were thinking the same thing. “Is this what love feels like?”
And then came the most beautiful little cry that Toni had ever heard. The pain stopped and all she could hear was her baby crying. When they laid him on her chest, he was covered in Thor only knows what, but he was still the most beautiful thing either of them had ever seen.
One thing that hadn’t occurred to Tony however, was that, by being away from his little girl this much, he was also hurting her. He and Steve had told her that neither of them were leaving, but Tony left, as soon as Peggy fell asleep. He couldn’t bear to stand there and face Steve, lying to his face, all because he was scared. Scared that Steve would finally realize that Tony wasn’t good enough, that they didn’t belong together, that Steve could do so much better than Tony. Tony wasn’t going to just wait around to have his heart broken.
When the bell rang, Peter practically flew out the door, his mouth running at a thousand miles a minute.
Tony walked in with more pancakes. He took one look between Peter and Steve, groaned once, and then started laughing right along with Steve. Peggy soon joined in and then Peter was on the verge of tears.
A week later, Steve and Tony were taking Peggy to preschool. They both thought they’d have to pry her off of them to get her to stay. In reality, Peggy saw the toys and took off without so much as a hug goodbye. Tony and Steve stood there gaping in disbelief before the teacher finally shooed them out.
labor until after my water breaks, which could be hours yet. I really need to get this stuff done, going upstairs can wait.” She had been working on these projects for weeks, double time, as she knew that once the baby was here, there wouldn’t be much time for work.
The man just laughed, “Who I am is not important young spider. As for what I want, I want to see the downfall of the Avengers. I want to take what your parents hold most near and dear to their hearts ripped away. God knows they’ve done it to enough people.”
They tried IVF. Toni went through three rounds. Her doctor recommended that with everything her body had gone through that they wait for a cycle in between tries. When the third cycle wasn’t successful, they had decided to wait. No point in getting their hopes up again.
This prompted a fairly loud sigh from the scientist, “I don’t know much, Steve. I’m hoping we’ll have more information when we go through the files Tony managed to get. The theory I have right now though, is that Bucky was given some version of the serum when HYDRA had him the first time. It probably enabled him to survive the fall, where he was re-recovered by HYDRA. I don’t have much else to go off of.”
“Hear ya loud and clear, Cap. Staying with Peter.” Rhodey was slightly reluctant, but Peter didn’t look like he wanted to be left by anyone, anytime soon anyhow.
The elevators doors opened, and Peggy and Peter were literally sitting on top of him. Tony couldn’t help but smile.
Nat was already in the driver’s seat when they got there, Toni whispering, “I killed her. I killed her. My baby. My baby. My baby,” over and over, the whole way to the hospital, Steve’s tears falling into her hair.
He was still huffing over it while they were getting ready for bed. Steve just chuckled, “If it makes you feel any better, Peter wasn’t any easier. He just kept building those new Lego sets you got him.”
Toni’s OB/GYN told them the next day that Toni was around six weeks along. Certainly not out of the woods yet, but they’d get there soon. She showed them the ultrasound. Steve panicked a little because there wasn’t a heartbeat, but both Toni and the doctor assured him that it was normal not to have a heartbeat this early in the pregnancy. The doctor printed them a picture, they scheduled another appointment two weeks out, and they were out the door.
All of a sudden, all the lightbulbs went off in Steve’s brain, “Holy shit. He thinks I’m gonna leave him. He thinks I’m in love with you. Oh god, Bucky.” Steve got up and started pacing, “How do I fix this? How do I convince him?” He turned to look at Bucky on the couch, “How do I do this? I fucked everything up. How do I fix this?”
Steve gave another sigh, this one in frustration, “Tony, you know you can talk to me. I’m not gonna tell anyone anything you don’t want told.”
Clint ran over and scooped up his daughter, tossing her in the air as she laughed, “Daddy! Put me down!”
Tony was drowning himself in work. Peggy and Peter were still sleeping with him and Steve, but Tony ended up waking up before any of them, allowing him to escape to the shop. He knew it wasn’t fair to the kids to just run, it had only been a few weeks, but they were starting to notice how much more they had seen Steve recently.
Peter and Peggy were over the moon to have a new brother, and a big brother at that. Peggy already had Peter, but Peter was absolutely thrilled to have a big brother. The two bonded over the fact that they had powers and it turned out that Pietro was very intelligent. He and Peter were down in the shop almost everyday with Tony.
“There’s nothing wrong,” the words burned coming out of Tony’s mouth, “I was just working on cracking all the encryptions on the HYDRA files. And you know me, once I get started on one thing, I find something else to do. So I worked on Nat’s Widow Bites and that led to working on Clint’s arrows. And then I got to thinking about Barnes’ arm and that led into putting together prosthetic designs. And then the encryptions were finally decrypted so then I started running worldwide facial rec programs but then those had to be updated. And I’ve just been really busy. I swear, as soon as those bastards are found I’ll be upstairs more.”
They had left the suit in the room. Peter knew there had to be cameras, he couldn’t just start talking to the suit in the hopes that JARVIS would respond, he’d never get out that way. But there had to be a way to get a message to daddy through the suit, there just had to be. Daddy wouldn’t have given the bad men his suit if there wasn’t a way to get Peter home too. Peter just had to be smart enough to figure it out.
It wasn’t like Peter hadn’t heard other comments like this before. Papa and daddy had told him that he might. The first time he did, he got sent to the principal’s office. After that, Uncle Bruce had taught him some breathing exercises to control the violent urges.
Next to him, Steve woke up, much in the same state Tony was in. He was sweating and breathing hard, taking a minute to separate the dreams from reality. Tony didn’t know what Steve had been dreaming about, they hadn’t been sharing nightmares for the past few days, they were just too much.
“You know those HYDRA files you shared with us a while back? The personnel files that your programs couldn’t handle on their own?”
“But Steve? I’m pregnant. That night before I left? Apparently that was enough. I’m six months along and I found out last week that it’s a boy. Did you hear that, baby? Peter’s gonna have a little brother in a few months. But he’s gonna need a dad. So please, Steve, you have to wake up. You just have to wake up!
The couple managed to get a few more hours of sleep, wrapped in each other’s arms, finding comfort where they could, worried sick about their children.
Little bit more of the twins in this chapter. I just want to say right now that this fic holds none of my opinions on any of the characters. There are some that I like more than others, but I withhold judgement within this fic. Also, there might be a few less chapters in this fic than I was intending. The next few chapters just kind of took on a life of their own. Just warning you. If it goes the way I think it's going, there may not be another work in this series either. I'm not too sure about anything right now though. Thanks for reading!
She finally did and the smile that spread across her face was huge. Toni’s voice came out in a whisper, “I’m pregnant!”
Fury stormed into the conference room, there was a look on his face that none of them had ever seen before. It certainly didn’t bode good things. The group had been frantically trying to think of a way to fool the plan to get Peggy back. Honestly, Tony was ready to sacrifice anything to get his daughter back. Clearly though, they couldn’t just let anyone have the Iron Man suits. There had to be a better solution.
“There is a small house on Prince Edward Island in Canada, miss. To my knowledge, its existence has never been divulged to Captain Rogers.”
Steve took over from here, “Your first middle name? Sarah? That was my mom. Let me tell you, Peggy, my mom was a saint. And one of the strongest women I’ve ever known. She’d be proud that you have her name. I’ll tell you all about her as you grow up.”
That got his attention. After the first few weeks, Steve had given up trying to get him to talk, seeming to resign himself to the fact that Tony was going to lock himself in the workshop. In a way, Tony was glad. It would make the inevitable rejection that much easier. On the other hand, it only served to prove Tony’s point. Steve would fall in love with Barnes all over again and leave him in the dust.
“WHY DID I MARRY YOU WITH YOUR STUPID FUCKING SUPER SOLDIER SPERM? I SWEAR WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE I’M PUTTING YOU BACK ON ICE JUST SO THAT I DON’T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS AGAIN. THIS FUCKING HURTS YOU DICK DON’T FUCKING LAUGH AT ME!”
“Papa, it w-was so s-scary. I-I thought that t-they had taken P-peggy. A-and that y-you were n-never gonna f-find me!”
Tony looked up from his phone, “Oh yeah, no problem. JARVIS and I’ll strip down one of the older marks, update the outside, and modify JARVIS’s programming. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.”
Peggy just giggled while he zipped up her dress and led her off to find some different shoes. Converse were fine for the first grade, but not so much high school graduations.
Steve woke up before the kids, which wasn’t surprising. He usually didn’t sleep for very long, the serum and his years of military service making him a morning person. He just wasn’t expecting to wake up with his arms full of Peter and Peggy. Steve almost dropped Peggy before he realized what he was holding. He quickly recovered and looked to his left. Tony was curled around Peter in his sleep, still holding the tablet he had inevitably been working on before passing out. Steve just smiled, Tony hadn’t been getting anywhere near the amount of sleep he should have. With the kids missing, neither of them had slept very well, but Tony never slept well to begin with.
“Are you sure you don’t want to watch a movie or something? Considering that somehow Clint always gets the movie he wants on movie night? Maybe we could watch something now to make up for Titanic?”
As it turned out, preschool did wonders for Peggy. She was talking now, not very much, and not very often, but she did say more than papa and daddy and Peter. Another plus of starting preschool was that the nightmares came less often. Now, instead of every night, they happened two or three nights a week. Nat thought that maybe she was just tired and therefore sleeping better, and Tony and Steve were inclined to believe her. Unfortunately, making friends at preschool meant sharing, which meant that any number of germs were being exchanged at any given time. And with two small kids in the house, when one got sick, so did the other.
Steve had his uniform on already and was strapping the shield to his back. Tony had his flight suit on and the platform was primed and ready.
Clint and Nat were handling all the interrogations themselves. It slowed down the process just slightly, but no one was going to say anything. Those two had murder in their eyes, reserved for the people that had taken their niece and nephew.
Slowly, Steve started unwrapping his hands. He picked the broken bags up and piled them in the corner, maybe they could be repaired. Steve picked up his gym bag and headed for the elevators, only glancing over his shoulder when he didn’t see Sam.
Sam took a deep breath, “I don’t know man, but I just know that if we have to fight our way out of this one? You’re gonna need to be at the top of your game, all of us are. If we’re not, we might as well just surrender.
Fury was clearly mocking them, “Bingo! That’s why you two aren’t allowed. You’re related. You both know the rules.
By the time Sam and Rhodey got back, Tony had been pacing for what seemed like hours, while Steve sat on the couch with his head in his hands. Eventually, he stood up.
Fury just rolled his eye, “Loud and clear, Stark. You two lovebirds get back to your kids, huh? Let us do our jobs?”
Tony’s voice started out in almost a whisper, “My gosh, I thought you’d never ask. I thought I had been imagining it for the longest time.”
The barrage of questions started immediately, “How long have these been going on? Why didn’t I know sooner? What causes your panic attacks? How can I help in the future? Does anyone else know about them?” Steve looked like he had more, but Tony cut him off there.
He was spread out on the couch, while the superhusbands were curled together on the loveseat. They sat up while he was stretching.
“Rhodes, if you’re still out, stay out. The more people with Peter, the better. We’ll be out in a few minutes.”
Tony set the plate of pancakes on the table and scooped Peter into his arms, uncaring of the maple syrup that was steadily getting everywhere, “Okay, Petey. Let’s get you a bath and then a change of clothes, huh, squirt?”
Tony was walking towards the elevators, “No, J. God no. I don’t know what I’d even say to him at this point.”
“From our intel,” Sharon threw the tablet at Tony, “it appears that originally, the twins signed on willingly for the experiment. However, we also think they were given false information to begin with. After this, there were several documentations of escape attempts that were unsuccessful. You rescuing Peter was their chance to get out. Why they came to us we don’t know.”
After Peter and Peggy got over their initial excitement at having Pietro home, their oldest looked up at Steve and Tony, “So where’s mine?”
So Steve dragged Tony upstairs for lunch. Tony grumbled through the whole thing, despite the fact that his stomach had been growling the whole time Steve had been in the shop.
“Oh sweetheart,” Toni was pulled tighter into the solid warmth of Steve’s chest, “you are good enough. You were good enough then too. Losing our little girl wasn’t your fault, it wasn’t anyone’s fault. You. Are. Good. Enough. You’re more than enough for me and you’ll be the best mother to this baby too, right?”
Taking a risk, Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s head, “If that’s how long you want me, then yes, forever.”
Steve was speechless, so Dr. Evans printed them a photo and gave them some instructions, “Take it easy for the next few weeks, alright? You’re only eight weeks along. If there’s any morning sickness, that’s normal but if you get dehydrated, call me immediately, okay? Do you have any other questions?”
Bruce pressed the buzzer, signaling that Natasha should back off for now. She looked at the window reluctantly, but knew that they weren’t going to get much out of him anyhow. They were all hoping that seeing Steve when Bucky wasn’t the Winter Soldier would jog his memory enough to start talking. It was practically grasping at straws, but hope was hope, no matter what form it took.
reason we’re doing this one is because it’s your daughter. If you push your luck, I’ll turn this over to the normal authorities, are we clear?”
“Miss, Captain Rogers has been injured. From what I have discerned, his injuries may be life threatening. Ms. Romanov is demanding to speak to you. Shall I put her through?”
Tony spoke up right away, “Well, if I’m leaving the suit in a locker, someone has to come pick it up right? Just send in some agents in disguise and catch the sucker red handed.”
It had only been about an hour when Peter started to stir again. The men were intrigued, in testing, that serum had taken a normal man hours to get through. Peter was still a child, so comparing his test results would be difficult, but not impossible. They would just have to keep watching and waiting for the right time.
There was a chuckle from Tony, “Well, as oblivious as you can be sometimes Steve, this wasn’t you being oblivious. This is me not sleeping in bed because it causes nights like this. I’m assuming you’re the one that brought me up to bed from the shop?”
Peggy was still crying after Steve and Tony left. She hadn’t said anything before they left, other than her plaintive cries of papa and daddy. Sharon figured she would calm down quickly. Pepper was inclined to agree with her. But when Peggy was still screaming and sobbing ten minutes after the team had left, they weren’t so sure. They just did their best to comfort the girl. Five minutes later, the proverbial alarm bells went off when Peggy started screaming words.
Natasha and Clint were making their way deeper and deeper into the bunker, picking off HYDRA agents as they went. Originally, Thor had been with them, but then Rhodey had been called away and Sam had been left without a partner. It was fairly easy going, she wasn’t going to lie,
The others checked in on them periodically, making sure they were eating and drinking, but for the most part, they were doing their best to find the littles that had captured everybody’s hearts.
Toni worked and lived in the little house on PEI for six months before JARVIS paged through a 911 emergency.
Peter was still thinking it through when the door opened again. This time, Peter moved before the dart could hit him. There was a pause before someone new came in. Peter didn’t know this person. It wasn’t the usual man in black, but a man with long hair. His arm was metal, how cool was that?
Thankfully, the elevator opened and Bucky walked out. Tony hadn’t been wrong about Bucky an Nat, they had gotten together. Unfortunately, by the time everyone had found out, Steve and Tony’s bet had escalated. Details are unnecessary, but there were a few nights that Steve didn’t get much sleep and not in the good way.
Tony looked around the room once, before stepping straight back into the elevator, needing to see Steve immediately.
He burst in, expecting to find that someone had broken in. Expecting to see Tony being tortured. Expected to see blood. Expected to have to fight his way through.
“Please! I know you love me! Please don’t leave me! Don’t hurt me anymore! Please! Mommy, make him stop! Please! Mommy, make him stop!”
“I knew it was gonna catch up with him eventually.” Steve thought to himself as he approached the bench. “Tony?”
They both just sat and stared at him until Steve plucked Peggy off, prompting Peter to also scramble away.
“You’ve been ignoring everything I’ve been saying all night, sweetheart. I feel like I should be asking
That was as far as Peter got before the door opened. He opened his mouth to speak before he saw the dart flying towards him. He wasn’t fast enough to jump aside before it stuck in his leg. He felt himself collapsing, and then darkness was all he knew.
“Maybe,” Pepper took a deep breath, “maybe she’s ready to talk? Or maybe something happened to her while HYDRA had her. She mentioned a mommy a few times. It scared the shit out of us, Tony. Sometimes, it didn’t seem like she knew where she was. When she’d mention mommy, she’d beg for her to stop.” Pepper paused and pinched her lips, “I think you should ask JARVIS to show you the tapes of when you were gone. I can’t even begin to explain it.”
Steve had been down earlier, just sitting and drawing. Also occasionally distracting DUM-E but that wasn’t the point. The point was it was now almost 8 AM, and Tony had said he was going to bed around 9 the previous night.
Surprisingly, Peter and Peggy thought the boy was a hoot. Steve and Tony had been reluctant to let Pietro around the kids, but once they knew him? Wild horses couldn’t have kept them away. He’d run around the floor and they’d laugh like hyenas at the streaks he left behind. Peggy had nearly puked the first time she was given a piggy back, but Peter just demanded another.
Pietro didn’t come home very often, despite the fact that he could be with them in minutes if he really wanted to be. Tony had also given the kid a car, not that he really needed it. Peter and Peggy both missed their older brother something fierce when he was gone. They were happier than clams in high tide when he came home.
Again, Tony heard JARVIS saying something. Again, he felt it getting unbearably warm when the temperature hadn’t changed. Again, breathing felt like the hardest thing in the world. Also, again, Tony was severely tired, he probably hadn’t slept in at least three days.
Sharon rounded the corner. She had apparently heard their conversation, because she was laughing at them. Why they didn’t know, but Tony certainly wasn’t afraid to ask.
They fell asleep, dead to the world. Wild horses couldn’t have disturbed their sleep. When Peter and Peggy woke up, JARVIS called Clint and Natasha, knowing that Steve and Tony had 6 hours of sleep combined in the last 72 hours.
Suffice to say, there was enough security surrounding their potential criminals for the family to remake the pancakes that had been abandoned earlier. The kitchen, and the kids, was once again a mess, but it just made Tony and Steve smile all the more. They hadn’t been together like this, with the kids, since Peter had first come home. They were all relearning how to react and act around each other. But it was good. They were good. Life was good.
“It appears Sir is in need of assistance, his vital readings are not in alignment with his normal vital signs.” Steve thought the AI sounded rather concerned, and to be honest, he was too.
“Hey sweetheart. It’s okay. Daddy’s here, so is papa. And guess who we brought home? We found Peter, baby. Papa has him, Peter’s home.”
Bruce, Tony wasn’t sure about. Maybe something went wrong and he needed to take a walk. Maybe he got called to SHIELD. Maybe he had a girlfriend again. Tony didn’t know. All he knew was that none of them were supposed to leave, and yet, he was the only one that had followed the rule. Go figure.
It started just like every other day. Steve got up for a run and Tony stumbled into the shower. JARVIS already had coffee waiting in the kitchen. Tony got the kids up after coffee, and Steve was making breakfast. Steve went to get Peggy ready and Tony took Peter. There were kisses goodbye all around and then Steve took the kids to school on his way to SHIELD. Everything was normal. Until JARVIS set off the alarm.
He made his way down to the shop, immediately getting to work on the HYDRA files and facial recognition programs.
Peggy was the next to wake up. Steve felt her stirring in her sleep. At first, he was smiling, seeing her wake up. But Peggy’s movement were suddenly jerky and she started whimpering. Nightmares weren’t uncommon, but they hadn’t been happening very often as of late. Steve tried to calm her down before it got too out of hand, not wanting Peter or Tony to wake up before they were ready. Soon though, that became impossible.
Rhodey came back with the doctor and they were all escorted out of the room. She waited until they reached the waiting area. And then Toni broke down, just like she had a week ago, only this time? It was so much worse. She had seen the look in his eyes when they had landed on her. There was none of the light that she had always known. Steve was physically there, but emotionally, he was so far away Toni may as well have been on Asgard.
Toni had sent Nat a text, telling her that she was in charge for the next two weeks. After that, she had JARVIS filter out all unnecessary communication. Which meant that anything that wasn’t a 911, was blocked. After that she fell asleep on the couch.
Toni thought that she might be breaking Steve’s hand with how hard she was squeezing but at this point? It’d honestly be payback.
"This one may be tired of war." T'Challa replied, referring to James Buchanan Barnes AKA the former Winter Soldier, who the director called Winnie. "But the White Wolf has rested long enough." And so, the Soldier was offered a new arm made of vibranium.
"I have chosen the Warrior," the Shining Lord announced without prompting or waiting a moment longer than he deemed fair. A great silence spilled across the great hall, though the High Priest's groan was the last noise to echo. The Moon Prince was tempted to let loose a smile, for the Lord's confidence was all that his heart had been missing before the ruler's arrival. The young boy looked astounded as if he could not believe the High King had called his name. Great discourse followed the decision's announcement and, for a moment, the Moon Prince's breath caught at the horrible flames that stormed in rage across the Shining Lord's face. The King had not lost his temper, not once, but a great urging rose inside him at the disrespect shown to his chosen partner.
"No, we have to destroy it." Vision said softly. "I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail."
Each stone lit up as Strange began naming them. "Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind..." He then opened the Eye Of Agamotto, revealing the green Time Stone. "And Time."
Meanwhile, Ebony Maw was interrogating Dr. Strange. He was floating horizontally, face down, surrounded by dozens of glassy needles, each about two feet long. "In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement." said Maw, as the needles moved, dangerously close to Strange's face. "Give me the Stone."
Palpatine:So be it. I thought we'd start a dead pool on how many heroes Thanos is officially going to kill.
Tony(Shining Lord), Steve(Fire Star Warrior), Ronan(Moon Prince), Star-Lord(Sun Soldier) and Ultron(Ion, the god of blood, flame and destruction) are the only ones reincarnated into this age, and everything that happened in the Celestial Kingdom are merely coincidences.
Red Skull:Put me down for Drei. I think it's going to be Captain America, Captain America, and Captain America.
"He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard." Meanwhile, Wong and Strange fought Maw. Maw lifted several bricks from the ground and turned them into sharp points. He sent them towards Wong and Strange. The two made portals and boomeranged them back towards Maw. Maw moved a car to protect himself, but one spike still hit his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw used a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious. Strange snapped a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanked, but Maw flew forward with the pull and pinned Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme.
"I'll tell the guys at the deli." replied Dr. Strange. "Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye."
But, let's just put it aside, when the news of the Star Warrior and the Apple Princess reached the Shining Lord, he got bent out of shape. Hell-bent on winning the Warrior's love back, the Shining Lord created a powerful being to teach the Apple Princess a lesson she'll never forget. His name was Ion, the God of Destruction. He would later be known to a certain amount of people as Shiva. Rebellious and daring, Ion dared to supplant his creator as the High King of the Celestials until he came face-to-face with the One Above All, who told him about his true duties. Ion did not believe at first, but he knew that the One Above All was unable to tell a lie, so he finally came to his senses and used all his powers to conjure up a magical path separating the Star Warrior and the Apple Princess, the Milky Way.
Thanos found himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opened his hand and saw that he now has the orange Soul Stone.
"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry." said Peter.
"Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos." said Strange.
"I'm gonna make a call." said Bruce. Wong nodded in understanding and closed the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of this arc. Bruce held Steve Rogers' cell phone and made a call.
Yesterday, the nation celebrated as the bombing of Nagasaki brought about what has so long been desired: peace. Today, we mourn as the true cost becomes clear. There are no figures from the fronts yet as to the number of dead, but speculation can only be placed in the millions. Among all those heroes that gave their life to defend freedom and democracy, we honor one in particular. Captain Steven Grant "America" Rogers was revealed today to have been killed in action on March 4th 1945, while stopping a German bomber from reaching New York.
"But it should." said Steve. He then turned to Vision and said "We don't trade lives, my friend. If the director knew about this, what would she say?"
"This night, our Shining Lord shall select a warrior to be his guardian and his most loyal companion. A Guardian must be prepared to sacrifice their life—their very soul—for the survival of the One Above All's son. The Winner must hold him dear to their hearts—as if the loss of the Lord would directly be a loss of themselves." The High Priest's boots were quiet along the tile as he walked, stepping forward to begin the festival. A sword gleamed in his hands, the symbol of success, for whoever was chosen would be given only the finest weapon. Boys, men, and elders stood at the ready, watching the powerful celestial with both fierce and hesitant eyes.
Well, almost every solar system, almost every world, almost every species, almost every life, and definitely not every universe. There are few universes—and lives—in which her silent song is paused, the music forever ringing on the last note played. In these worlds, to all that are miniature and grand, immortality is a haunting tone. I have heard its concertos and symphonies, listened to the notes fall only to never end, stuck forever as I wait, agonized, for the next unending measure.
"That was a mistake." sneered Thanos. He borrowed Corvus's glaive then stabbed Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound.
Wanda cast a bolt of magic which threw Corvus back through the wall and down a shaft, then flew the two of them away again. Proxima, who has recovered, shot a bolt from her weapon, causing them to fall from the air and down through the roof of Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Wanda crawled over to Vision, who cannot muster the strength to stand. "Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go." said Wanda.
"Almighty Thanos, I...Loki...Prince of Asgard...Odinson...The rightful King of Jotunheim...God of Mischief...do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity."
Meanwhile, Thanos and Gamora were on Vormir. "The stone had better be up there...for your sister's sake." said Thanos. The walk up the mountain seemed to be long, but not difficult. Paths worn by centuries or more of feet led up to the summit, where Thanos and Gamora encountered a floating hooded figure.
"You'll know when we're there. Nidavellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star." declared Thor, nostalgia in his voice. "It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome."
Tony walked towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect. "And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening." he said, irritably.
"It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost." Eitri replied.
The Titan walked over and dropped Loki's dead body in front of Thor. "No resurrections this time." he said, then raised the gauntlet, sent violet Power fire through the remains of the Statesman, and used the Space Stone to teleport away with the Black Order.
"Thanks, Director!" Peter said, and immediately added "I'm trying to say that...something is coming."
"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?" Rhodey retaliated.
"Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another...We have a Hulk." Thanos looked to his right just as a green and very angry mass slammed into him. Loki dove for Thor, pulling both of them out of the way as the Tesseract skittered across the floor, and the Hulk charged at Thanos. He pummeled Thanos, forcing him backwards and shoving him into the wall of the ship. Maw stopped Black Dwarf from interfering.
"Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamed, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?"
On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stood up. He looked out the window and saw the ship, then tapped on his best friend in the seat in front of him. "Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction."
Gamora reached out and and picked up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps. "It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers."
Clint nodded, like this happened often, taking a few steps towards the little girl. "Why, she having a date tonight?"
Meanwhile, Tony was snapping out orders. "FRIDAY, evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
His hand was all-powerful, pulling from within His pocket a grain of existential matter—the very materials of which life is born. With these tools, the creator laid down on upon the Celestial ground a gift. It was rumored to be greater than all—a direct descendant of the great One's strength and self. Thousands of colors danced against the windows, casting shadows and rays of brilliance, and the Celestials, who were used to such splendorous kind of wonders, stood in awe. It was a magical scene, prompting wild tales that would never cease to hold a curious ear and the interest of those who see much more than what is. Even the production, herself, would find her attention arrested by the stories told of her making.
"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop." said Gamora.
he was now letting her take over. "You slutty, nasty, bossy high-maintenance—" she cursed, only to be cut short by Tony.
"I don't...I don't know. But something..." The stone trilled again and Vision flinched. Wanda took his face in her hands. Vision turned his head so he can kiss her left palm, then pressed Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone. "Tell me what
said Leyenar. Everyone thinks that Tony Stark wanted a huge ass union ceremony with all the bells and whistles, and the young director was no exception. And then she would think of Tony Stark & Steve Rogers:Co-Mayors Of Leyenarville, and would go giddy with laughter. But Irah had chosen Pepper, despite his connection to Cap. And every time she thought of it, she felt the hellfire rising up in her once again. However, to top it all, the Avengers were ripped up and torn apart, and there was no way anyone could restore them.
The light gave way, slipping into soft tendrils of shimmering gold until it revealed a beautiful figure standing beneath the rays. The Shining Lord was, in appearance, of 20 years—his midnight blue eyes, however, even as they dropped in child-like tiredness, held an infinite wisdom, his golden skin shining and black hair tied back from his face. The Shining Lord was a vision, a picture of the power and infinite ability belonging to the One Above All.
"There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan." said Thanos.
"It's okay. Hey, stand down." said Tony, then he turned to Wong and said "Keep an eye on him. Thank you.".
"NOOOOO! You're gonna pay for that!" cried Thor, only to have his mouth shut by Maw, who picked up the Tesseract and handed it to Thanos. "My humble personage…bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp."
"Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you're trespassing in this city and on this planet." said Strange, ready to engage, Wong by his side.
"You see it as well?" The head of the Celestial military leaned toward the Moon Prince for privacy. The older nodded, glancing at his friend's charge. They had often spoken of this boy, the Fire Star Warrior, for the Prince had noticed that rare flame in his brother's eyes—the one that often sparked inside the Shining Lord. The boy had the skill of a fine fighter.
Every moment of free time the Moon Prince had, he spent with his best friend, and the time he spent with his family was spent missing him. It didn't matter that the entire multiverse was all in a tizzy about a grand event, the wedding of the Dawn Bringer, a beautiful princess who set the solar cycles of the planets and the patron goddess of the green people who called themselves the Zen-Whoberi. When the Prince should have been swept up in go picking out outfits, all he could think about was what the Sun Soldier was doing without him.
"Stop massaging his muscles." Star-Lord said snidely, then told Mantis "Wake him up." Mantis did so.
Black Dwarf grunted out two untranslated syllables, and Maw ordered, "Bring me the Stone, before they can give it to her!" Black Dwarf spat three untranslated syllables, and dropped his huge alien hammer and dragged it along as he obeyed his brethren.
"Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells." Star-Lord grumbled.
"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty..." Peter murmured. Tony, Leyenar and the Cloak turned to face him, dropping down from above.
"Yes!" cheered Peter. "Wait, what are those?!" Spider-Man crouched with his new spider-legs, and made a mighty leap to pull them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprayed nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hit the floor. Ebony Maw was left floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man landed on his new legs, retracts them, and found the Cloak Of Levitation "standing" next to him.
I have crushed planets. I have abolished whole populations. I have breathed life into unborn beings and watched as their lives grew pitiable until only I could save them—I have wielded such mastery over the limited agency of my inferiors. But none of these displays satisfy me, not even the adrenaline that comes with the eradication of half a peoples' existence.
"Or not. If I'm overstepping…" said Vision, suddenly sounding very uncertain. Wanda stepped over to get a better view of the TV in the kebab shop at which they had stopped, drawing Vision with her. It showed coverage of the invasion of New York, the alien antagonists, and the disappearance of Tony Stark.
"Happy trails, kid. FRIDAY, send him home." Tony said. A large parachute extended from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth.
"There were a lot of others chasing after Nat, wanting to marry her as well." replied Lyla. "But Rex ate them all up, 'cause the best things in life are worth fighting for."
Palpatine, Joker, Voldemort, Zod, and every Marvel villain are celebrating because Thanos is finally leaving to actually do something other than sit in his chair.
"They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes." said Thor. "Of course, the director can go on for ages bragging about 'em, and..."
"Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection." the Titan growled. Star-Lord stopped, and held up a fist meaning 'halt' in the silent language of soldiers. Everybody walked quietly past him. "I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering." said Thanos, then pressed his heavy boot into the Collector's chest.
"Why the long face, buddy?" he asked. "I could see you frowning all the way across the galaxies." The Sun Soldier just wept, burying his face in the Moon Prince's shoulder. After so many centuries of being alone, he'd finally found someone who loved him for what he was, caring for his flaws and celebrating his triumphs. A friend, something more than a friend. A partner. A love. An equal. His face scrunched, losing his composure and sobbing as the Prince tried desperately to sooth him. "I can't be with you anymore, I promised to marry the Dawn Bringer."
feel." he said to her. Wanda gestured, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seemed confused.
When the ruler of Earth heard of the news, he raged against the heavens for his daughter to be returned, for without her and the apples she grew, the festival could not happen each year. But to the shock of all, the Princess declared that she too loved the Warrior, and refused to return. Grudgingly, the rulers of Heaven and Earth both gave the two permission to stay together, providing they did not shun their duties.
"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?" asked Thanos. Meanwhile, Drax was ready to strike, eager to avenge his family. However, Star-Lord stopped him, saying "He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah."
In Shuri's lab, Shuri scanned the Stone with her kimoyo beads while Vision lay on the examination table. She flipped her hand over and studied the hologram projected over her palm. "Whoa. The structure is polymorphic." exclaimed the young princess.
"Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's
After the Sokovia incident, Leyenar chose to stay at the Avengers Mansion. She dared not go back to her parents, since they were no good to her. They didn't even try to understand her opinion on same-sex pairings! Plus, FRIDAY was a really good cook, better than her mom. Once the dust had settled, the heroes threw a raging party for her, during of which Leyenar gave each and every one of them lovely gifts. The Avengers presented her with a buncha beautiful flowers in return.
This had been Leyenar Oh's mantra for 3 years, when she came up with something that began with "It all began on a day that was exactly like any other, and what made that day so special for the two leaders of the Avengers was a li'l something that bore the label "Keep Your Hands Off". It all began when that THING exploded in the halls of the Avengers Mansion...", and ended with "And so, Captain America and Iron Man became the official "Keep Your Hands Off" couple in the Avengers.". And now, Leyenar was heartbroken, because of
Loki stood with the Black Order. He watched Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette. "I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right...yet to fail, nonetheless." said the Titan, as he lifted Thor by the neck of his breastplate. Thor struggled feebly. "It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say...
"Of course you can!" squealed Lyla. "Let me down, daddy!" she yelled, though she was really more laughing, her little body swaying from side to side as the two of them walked up the stairs.
"Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?" asked Tony, and Pepper replied with a yes.
Soul-bonding was a rare occurrence with only 3500 bonding confirmation in America since the early seventeenth century. The rarest and ultimate bond of soul-bonding was called the Twin-Flame, they claimed to have spent many past reincarnations together.
The Guardians nodded or waved farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot departed. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers, watching them from afar, murmured "Don't you dare interfere unless told otherwise, report immediately to the Director and the Supreme Accuser when you notice romantic interactions between Star-Lord and Gamora. Keep a safe distance."
The conversation with Stark had gone off without a hitch. The details she had given had held up to cursory scrutiny.
"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts." Bruce insisted.
The skin beneath his forearms were flared, red, hived. Towards the lower joint—in the middle of each one’s dipped path—was a small but raised laceration that poked through the skin like a vein, existing on the
“Oh, I don’t know,” Tony said, thought about it. "I come from a well-seasoned family of scientists, can tell when things aren’t right. You could call it a
“Actually, uh, through here,” he said behind him, and pointed towards an empty corridor that branched from the path.
“Well, we’re not talking. He’d never listen if I showed up and started making unwarranted demands.” Tony crumpled his expression, scolded Peter with preliminary warning. “Don’t make unwarranted demands.”
Peter focused a moment more, heaved his shoulders and closed his eyes. He brought out his right wrist to the table, and with great pain came the web, white and strong, onto the surface for what seemed like the millionth time to Peter. Bruce pierced acutely the instrument, with its sharp head, into a spot on the fibrous lattice, and with similar immediacy Peter retracted the web again and fell forward onto the table. He had managed to catch himself with his forearms, and he hung his head in the space he left between himself and the wood. Peter breathed deeply.
From the field, he made his way over to the bleachers. Crossing over the first one, the student stared up at Tony and fidgeted. Tony mentally prepared his impression.
about helping your case.” And though he was talking to Steve, Tony said it to the split wire in his hand.
It was a matter of him being frightened, and he knew it. He refused to look up at that which scrutinised down at him. He denied the buildings that sounded back to him his choking at the foot of Clint Barton’s unjustified wrath, and wouldn’t let them penetrate him with the memory. Tony’s eyes, instead, raced about his pant thighs in quick calculation, in which he tried to put the pieces together.
Steve breathed. “Down at the pond, before I went off, Peter had said a string of words, I think, and—“
“Through our school, of course. In conjunction with their endorsement, we want to present the wider world with a team of justified young leaders who will, inevitably, go on to become globally-distinguished examples.” Coulson locked his hands again, stared at Tony attentively. “And I think it would be
Steve blinked out of his stare, promptly picked up a stool nearby so as not to leave Tony waiting. He brought it over and sat. “Do you know much about psychology?”
Trodding down the concrete halls, backpack strap in hand—hearing hard, fast steps hit flatly against external, wet patter—and, through the shoal of students, meeting eyes with
It was one particularly lonesome afternoon—much to his favour—where, standing topless ahead the mirror in his disorderly dorm, Tony realised properly the extent of his condition of being.
wasn’t enough for you to keep one contribution pool to dip your feet in,” Tony deduced, interrupted Coulson’s bullshit. He let his bag down. "One very
He was heaving and frustrated, and had managed to give himself multiple tours of the entire school again, when he realised approach was the next step.
And at the tone of both defeat and undaunted resolution, Peter could tell he had lost. It was one thing to argue assistance, but to request Bruce to neglect something like
Again, he stifled an incredulous chuckle. “Name a peer jumping at the opportunity to protect me.” Tony outstretched his arms, gesturing to no one. “Maybe Clint knocked the sight out of me too, but I don’t see anyone here."
Without warning, Steve surged towards Tony, used his big arms to shove all the tables outwards of his path with enormous power. They landed like an arrow indicating Tony, spilling the rest of his clutter onto the floor in chaos. Acting quick, and almost in reflex—like it was natural,
for him to do so—Tony held the hand with the beam pad up in defence and mashed his left palm on his laptop in which the wiring accruing simulation detached.
But then he looked over, saw the solemn extent of Steve's expression, saw the sink of his hulking figure towards the stool, and Tony's diffracted laughing subsided. He flashed a look of his own severe bafflement. Steve laced his fingers together, let them hang in waiting.
The warmed light of the headlamps burned sweetly into the darkened space later that day, shone with bronze tint Tony’s tools and wires and the lot of his other objects. He had been working on a brace—a simple, austere skeleton—to fit atop his chest and make easier his working, insertion, and the extraneous holdings of wires that came with his configuration. The beam pads once upon his palms he restricted spatially to his right hand, and carrying it was Tony’s best attempt at a makeshift, substandard (on Stark terms, that is) gauntlet. He desperately wanted to create another, for his left, but was low on materials, and couldn’t even properly build the one he had managed into existence. He had told Fury that he needed this metal and this tool, for the sake of his genius. Fury asked him
Bruce straightened himself out again, gave a few blinks in effort to understand, and swallowed. “Does… Does that hurt?”
Then, without a warning of better conviction, Tony used his might and hurled the football at Peter’s head. For a solid item, it propelled linearly and strongly, without curvature or immediate dip.
early in the day to begin the inevitable, never-ending, walking panel of speculation that came with what that meant. At least after settling back into his dorm he’d feel more ready to relay the same dismissive, monotonous answer he had prepared for them all.
And Steve now felt he was properly displaced in the comfort of alliance, finally, and could not contain his contentment. He shook his head at the remark, put his head down and focus elsewhere to choke out the enjoyable
It was more so a metaphorical hand—a beam of light plunging through him like the punch of a giant—but
“God, I’m really not cutout for this, am I?” Tony asked no one in particularly, though maybe himself, and took the fingers that tapped and pulled on his lip in thought, let his leg bounce.
—menacing with all his darkened burl but no immediate threat—and then had suddenly recked the room with a swipe of otherworldly strength, charged
, equipped with a turbulent device he knows nothing about, run loose in a standardised engineering lab.”
Tony looked up, and it was as though he had swallowed dutifully a spoonful of pride and let it flush through his face. He knocked at the dark wood surface of the table beneath a balled hand, displayed pursed lips and a surrendered, dropped stare. “I need you to find someone for me.”
And Tony tweaked his work a bit more, though no real progression came from the action. Steve sat there, like he always did. He chose not to speak until Tony indicated, which he did a moment or so later.
—to even attempt conciliation without equal context—in favour of his own reasons, was something Peter wasn’t able, in his heart, to do. He found himself nodding at this, didn’t even have to make it verbal.
Bruce found himself plagued with disbelief, with a sort of gloom that a friend has for another’s misfortune. “What the
Bruce had Peter sat on a stool at one of the tables, hands held firmly on the edge of the surface, with an odd-looking drink beneath his dipped, weary head. A chemistry set—something small, not too extravagant—was set up to the right of him, with a row of small instruments placed routinely next to the case. Bruce was attending to it with great focus.
Coulson continued. “In saying that, I wanted—while you were here—to discuss something with you very much aside from your situation with Mr. Barton—"
Steve raised his expression at the flurry of muted spiel that proceeded from the opposite end of the call. Tony nodded to the speech, kept his stare at Steve to show he was
Coulson exhaled into a more optimistic demeanour. “With Mr. Barton off your back, we’re hopeful you can put your dispensed energy back into the things that matter. You’re a very intelligent student, Mr. Stark."
Tony looked up, then immediately returned pensive at his own book. He narrowed his eyes in concentration, held his pencil in paused action and let the led balance it. Desperately, he wanted to hear what they had to say.
“I’m not saying it is,” Coulson said. Then, he sorted through a shallow stack of paper to his right, examined it. “While we’re on the topic of extracurriculars, however, I’d like to run something by you.”
When he had heard a group of peers in his class discuss Tony Stark’s whereabouts—a topic that dipped in and out of popularity in the whispers—Steve ensured he listened. Whilst most of it concerned his past, in which Steve heard conjectures about
They stood in silence for a period or so of thought. Bruce couldn’t find the words to proceed with, and Tony refused to for the sake of the unspoken sincerity between them. It was—more so that a re-meeting—a moment of two friends comprehending the barren lives of the other without speech, without comment, and he thought it needed to be savoured. Bruce played with his pants, looked down. Tony held a hand on his backpack strap, like an anchor of the present. After a minute more, he put his hands in his pocket.
know that,” he then said, unfastened his seatbelt, “but something tells me my opinion differs to everyone else's.”
And, just as Tony—after noticing the truth of Steve’s denseness—was to explain the jest of his question, the both of them were drawn out of their conversation by the notice of a swaying figure to the side of their focus.
at Tony to do the same to him. Stuck deep within the clamminess of his shock, Tony realised his chest had saved him once again. In this instance, it had let out enough energy to propel his aggressor into the wall behind him.
“Well, when I wire it up to,” Tony said. Then he exhaled, put his hands on his hips, stared straight at Peter. “Being like everyone else, especially
And throughout the rest of the hour-and-a-half—until Fury came to both kick him out and take his rightful muffin—Tony was
“Stark?” The student in front of him then asked, squinted at Tony. His eyes broadened in realisation, eyebrows raised in wonder. Yes, it was
, and the sight of a ultramarine light—a blue eye—reminding him of a heartache Tony experienced at his absence, prompted him to want to give something in return.
“Would you like me to escort you inside?” Tony’s driver asked, turned around frailly to face him seated at the back of the car.
, as equally thick in consistency as it was the muted colour of the sun the students at the school had surely forgotten. Peter picked it up with great struggle, managed to look at it through drooping eyes.
Tony walked back, gold football in hand, and stood a further distance away from Peter. His eyes were ticking, ruminating, and Peter's seemed unsuspecting. Tony had
“What are you inferring happens once you black out?” Tony continued again, tipped his head in brooding and crossed his arms.
At this point, the tension in the room had calmed to a slow murmur of comrades in banter, and it slowed even further to silence, again, with Tony and Bruce staring at each other. Something unstated in the moment called for further sentiment. Bruce was not indebted such, and so Tony dipped his head, thought about it, and spoke finally.
They went quiet again. After a while, though Steve didn’t think himself good it, he tried to lighten the mood.
Tony to leave him alone. The same hairstyle he had kept since they’d fallen out had his hewn face sat underneath, expression folded in frustration. He wore just the school shirt, no overwear, with the white fabric split into two halves by his long tie. And, really, nothing had outwardly changed. Bruce was still Bruce.
rather than it usually did in. Peter held his arms upright. Steve blinked at the condition of them. So did Tony.
“And you remembered something.” Tony placed his tool down, put the gauntlet hand on his hip. “Spill it, Rogers. I’m officially on a need-to-know basis.”
Tony went croaky, held the probe with both hands, lurched a bit. He blinked at an odd feeling. “Jesus. Why does this sort of hurt?"
Steve wiped his hands on his school pants, tried to think of how to explain it. “Say, for example, you start to get angry."
Tony felt a few ghost kicks just below the dip of his abdomen. He touched the spot that instinctively gave off an apparitional ache, swallowed at the twinge that came with remembrance. “You get
you wouldn't,” Tony scoffed. He then looked out, got caught in a distant meditation of thought and lost knowledge and innovation and new things. “But neither do I.”
, eventually. Bruce and Tony said it themselves: I’m losing blood.” Peter hushed dismally. "There’s only so much they can do before I’m going to need an actual doctor.”
Two, was to proceed to the facility in a brisk trudge. No stopping for any other misplaced figures he may or may not come across.
Peter fell forward onto his knees and then into the grass, face-down, unconscious. The last he saw was the school’s embellished structure fly atop him. The soft rain continued on.
And the student, sat unaffected by the insinuation (as though it bore no relevance), was missing his left arm. The space, nevertheless, was left respected by the adjustment of his jacket’s sleeve. In any manner, it did not dim his threat.
There was something about his expression that matched the day outside, something dark under which the yellow lights of the facility shadowed his acute, detached
Steve tugged Tony down until they were both sitting on the floor of the shop, curled into each other’s arms, “Just about everything Tony. He doesn’t know how I like my coffee in the mornings. He also doesn’t know that I absolutely
And that was it. They got in separate elevators, went to separate floors, and only saw each other when Steve came up from the gym, not looking anymore relaxed than before. Tony on the other hand, had a smile on his face that JARVIS hadn’t seen in weeks. Probably because Tony hadn’t hardly seen his kids in weeks.
Steve looked up from cutting Peggy’s pancakes and started laughing. Peter, somehow, had managed to absolutely
Both of them were whispering to Peggy, desperately hoping that she would stop crying. They just didn’t know what to do.
There was a chorus of whines from both the children, but Tony gave them the look and off they went. He rubbed the back of his neck before looking up,
Peggy and Peter were already scrambling off the bed, “We want breakfast! Pancakes, daddy! Pancakes!”
As they got closer, Tony noticed the tears gathering in Pepper’s eyes and immediately began thinking of the worst case scenario, “Pep! What’s wrong? Where’s Peggy?”
“Peter! Peggy! We’re gonna be late! C’mon guys, your father will kill me if we’re late.” Steve was tugging down the sleeves of his suit jacket when his two youngest spilled out of the hallway. He couldn’t decide whether to laugh or to coo at the cuteness. Peggy was six now and learning what went with what fashion wise. Apparently, she had been in the middle of trying on another outfit because her dress was only half zipped.  Peter had parts of his suit on, but the jacket was trailing behind him and his shirt was only half buttoned.
Tony realized he was still curled around Peter. Steve was awake, trying to calm Peggy down, but having little luck, not being able to properly hug her with Peter in the other arm. Tony looked at Steve, trying to pry Peter off. After a few moments, Peter was finally lose enough that Tony could take Peter, letting Steve fully hug Peggy.
“If you’re waiting for me to climb the walls, you’re gonna be waiting a while, because I don’t plan on doing that anytime soon.”
Instead, he popped the face mask up, “Yeah buddy, it’s me. Can you step back so I can get the door open?”
This is it guys! It's finally finished! I did add another part to this series. Some of you were asking about what happened to Wanda and that one shot explains. You should probably go read that before reading this epilogue. I really appreciate all of you! You guys don't even know how much. As always, thanks for reading!
“Sweetheart, I was angry. And I’m sorry for what I said when I was angry. I wish I could go back in time and take back what I said. Good lord do I ever wish I could. I’m not saying that either of us are blame free in the last few months, but I’m willing to move on from the past.” Dear Lord, they were both crying now, “Please come home? We can fix all this. Just come home, please?”
“And I’m gonna cut you off there Cap. I’ve got work to do.” He also started berating JARVIS with the typical, “I’m going to reprogram you and give you to a community
The man stared at Peter for a while longer before turning around and leaving the room, just as quietly as before.
Tony looked up, which Steve thought meant he could hear him, but didn’t seem to be capable of talking. Steve kept talking, but that didn’t seem to help. Eventually, he just thought, “fuck it” and picked Tony up in a hug.
When they finally opened, Steve was running in at full speed, expecting blood or possible hostiles but only saw Tony. A Tony who looked like he was panicking and having trouble breathing, but Steve just couldn’t figure out why.
After a while, it started working. It took a few minutes, but Tony could tell Steve was actually breathing. The sobs were still pretty bad, but at least he was breathing.
He really wanted to argue with his husband more on this, he really did. But Steve couldn’t find fault with any of his reasoning. He just sighed and went along with it all. Maybe Tony was right and maybe something good might come out of this. Tony usually wasn’t wrong.
It took him a second to even formulate the sentence, “It’s Peter and Peggy. They’ve been kidnapped.”
“Uncle Clint will probably bring food. Doesn’t that sound good, Peggy? Uncle Clint always has the best food, not like the fruits and veggies like papa. But don’t tell him I said that.”
“Sweetheart, you can call me whatever you want. I’m yours, head over heels in love with you, for as long as you want.”
Peter spat on the floor and sat up, “Daddy would never give you his suit. And even if you did send Peggy home, my papa will find you. He won’t let any of you get away with this.”
For some reason, Tony was the only one left in the tower. Apparently Phil and Clint couldn’t handle whatever mission they were on. Originally they had requested Steve but Nat said that was out of the question. So she went.
A few weeks later (Tony’s lawyers worked their magic again), Pietro Maximoff officially became Pietro Maximoff Stark-Rogers. They had discussed it at length and Pietro had wanted to take the same last name as his new siblings. Other than Wanda, the boy hadn’t had a family in almost four years, sharing the last name made him feel more like family and like he belonged there.
“Are we sure this is the right thing to do right now, Tony?” The last part of the question went unspoken between them. The part where they were just beginning to repair their relationship and put their family back together. Yeah, that part.
He scrambled to his feet, trying to figure out where she went. There wasn’t another cell in the room, so he doubted that she had been moved. Oh, but what if they were hurting Peggy this time, and not him? The man had promised they weren’t going to touch Peggy, but Peter didn’t think that the bad man would keep promises very well. Where else could she be? Daddy and papa clearly weren’t here yet, so she hadn’t been rescued, but that still didn’t answer his question. Finally, he just started talking.
Steve remembered being sick as a kid back in the 40’s. It had been miserable, but there wasn’t a whole lot they could do about it. Even with modern medicine, there wasn’t a whole lot to be done for the stomach flu. Steve would have gladly taken on both Peggy and Peter’s sickness if he could have, but he knew that was impossible. Peter’s crying continued and all Steve could do was be there for him.
Tony turned around and Rhodey almost gasped. His best friend looked awful. He had seen Tony after days long binges in the workshop before, but this wasn’t even similar to that. There was crazed, driven look in those tired eyes that Rhodey hoped to never see again. The man looked like he had lost ten pounds overnight, the clothes he was wearing hanging off of his usually muscular frame. His voice didn’t sound the same either,
In all honesty though, after Steve showed up, Toni’s mind was otherwise occupied. Despite the quarrels on the helicarrier, there was no denying that the man was insanely attractive. The things she could imagine doing with that man....
Tony stared back at him, flickered rapidly his stare over the heap of his flopped, big figure. He could see that the foregoing darkness in Steve had been percolated through his eyes, left them floundering beneath something else.
“Well, I don’t think I’ll manage on muffins,” Steve said. He took hold of his sweater, which was folded on the edge of the table. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Parker!” Coach Hill yelled out to him. She signalled his prompt return by tapping an invisible watch.
Tony stored mentally aspects of what he overheard from those students conversing in class, and it was all quite grand in theory. The facility was a standing building, an old structure at the fore of the school’s turbid pond hidden behind a dividing hill. It came set with modernised equipment and ample space and, that which was most absorbing of the information, a
The webbing emerged quickly, hit a spot on the corridor's tiles in front of him, and he let it go on no longer than a second. Peter managed to retract it before the wailing came, and lurched in the weariness of short, but strenuous labour. Bruce staggered back, had his eyes broad, and Peter was still breathing heavy when he had managed to quiver a lip, hand pointing the spot of the webbing’s mark in
.” Tony sorted through an array of bits on his desk, picked up the wire he had let down in contemplation. “This… wiring is still showing interrupted communication. I’m not leaving here ’till it’s fixed.” Then, he gestured to the leftmost bench of him at the side of the room, in which stood two fist-size cakes. “Plus, I have muffins from lunch.
Peter straightened again his sleeve mouths, let them oddly envelope his orange wrist bands, and fixed promptly his vest. His lower right forearm, from which his webbing had come, throbbed lightly. Peter ran a hand atop his hair, smoothened it, and proceeded weakly for the chapel’s interior again.
Steve sighed, looked at him with that same concern he was entrapped by when they had seen him push himself into a near collapse. He waited, could see a want to explain in the narrow of Peter’s stare. And, as expected, he fulfilled it promptly.
Again, Steve exhaled them both into quiet. He thought about it, looked down into his own crossed legs. “Guess the same goes for me too.”
Back in the facility, Fury had finally gotten Peter on a stool, made him stay there until he amply recuperated under a scale of his own discretion. Peter had pleaded with Fury not to call the school nurse (and for very good reason, he had told him, but not
me out. Just a little bit. And… and I know it’s because you need something from me. But…” Peter tried to be stern, but it didn’t suit him. “I can’t do your homework.”
to give Steve loitering privileges, so long as he didn’t ask too many questions and let him work and think at his own pace. Steve was, also, as new to the school as the fresh few tears of the day were to that afternoon, and Tony evoked some sense of routine pity. He was
The soft, unbroken flicker of enclosed blue was seated symmetrically between his rib cage, and showcased a flat face that dissipated whitened teal into small divisions. The idea that he was a teenager with an exposed device lodged in the crook of his chest, at that moment in time, had become less of a consideration to Tony, as rare as it was abnormal.
Tony walked around Coulson, opened the large oak doors behind him, and disappeared at once. He left his principal staring out at the rounded driveway, as lonesome as he must’ve been before Tony had arrived.
Tony—without expecting it—exhaled. He softened his tensed shoulders, almost drooped into a collapse himself to match. “Alright, I get it.
Tony stood. “You know, if this thing in my heart was as volatile as you're insinuating it is, my father wouldn’t have allowed it in the first place.”
“Shouldn’t be much of a surprise.” Tony shook a deducing finger. “Weren’t you anticipating me a minute ago?”
And the liquid in the vial, between Bruce’s fingers, morphed presently into a fire; a red swirled around the lighter existence of orange smoke. He put it back onto a wooden stand next to other small glass cylinders, similarly with instruments of the same type inside of them. He wrote something down on the notepad he had opened, pointed to it with a tapping finger. Tony came over to look.
Tony stared at his principal, thought about it a moment.
