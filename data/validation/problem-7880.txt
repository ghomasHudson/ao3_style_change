“December 16, yeah. I thought maybe you and I should take a little trip together. Come on, get bundled up.”
So instead of doing anything useful, Peter snooped. Because he might be older and more jaded than when he’d first imagined living amongst superheroes, but that didn’t mean he was entirely unaffected by suddenly bunking with the likes of people he’d dressed up as when he was a kid. That wasn’t to say all the rooms were interesting. It was clear that some of them, like the Winter Soldier’s, hadn’t been used at all since the compound had been rebuilt. Others, like Colonel Rhodes and Falcon’s, were so compulsively neat that even though Peter knew both men had been around, he would have had to be way more willing to really violate their privacy to learn anything of value. Dr. Banner’s room, recognizable from several feet away by the widened doorway he’d clearly installed to accommodate his shared Hulk/Bruce frame, was littered with a few interesting looking scientific journals, and it smelled faintly like a spicy kind of tea. Next to him was The Scarlet Witch. Peter almost didn’t venture inside. No one had seen Wanda since the service for Tony. He’d heard snippets of enough conversations to know that several members of the team were looking, and others (particularly Clint) seemed to feel that if Wanda wished to grieve her loss privately, that was her right.
“It’s supposed to signify purity of intentions,” Steve added.
“What, that’s all it takes to knock me off my mantle?” Tony clutched his chest as if mortally wounded.
“It’s a good thing that no one knows I’m seeing you as a patient. Otherwise I would be fielding a lot of questions about what on Earth I said to you in our sessions to make you resign as Director of SHIELD.”
“So he’s not saying no,” Clint summarized, “he’s just saying he doesn’t know what exactly his ‘yes’ is going to entail just yet.” Natasha stood up for a drink refill Coulson was certain she didn’t really need in order to drop a kiss on Clint’s head on her way by. It had taken Clint so long to start speaking up during conversations like this, whether at SHIELD or in their home. He had been so used to being looked down on or dismissed that he’d opted either to play the role of class clown, or to stay silent altogether. Slowly, though, as Phil and the others had put the work in to show him how valuable his insights were, he’d started to speak up more and more. Phil loved him fiercely then, and felt grateful to remember that even with the future with Tony so uncertain.
Before he’d delivered the last of his worries into Natasha’s hands for safe-keeping, Phil had hesitated. Not for long, but enough of a break from the almost musical rhythm of the exchange to be noticeable; quickly, Tony had attempted to feign interest in the medical drama playing out on the screen in front of him.
“I neglected to teach you about something pretty important during our lesson earlier. Could I maybe have a do-over?”
,” Phil had ranted, forgetting momentarily that as Bucky’s handler it was his job to be listening, not adding to the other man’s stress. “And it’s not like I expected him to drop his life story at our feet, but getting it in bits and pieces like this just makes it all the more challenging to put it all together into something coherent. Steve texted me something from Wakanda the other day about watching that no one makes any gestures or comments that would suggest a willingness to try to
“I’m not saying I think you’re wrong,” she said carefully. (He didn’t even care that her feet were up on the table again, not if someone was finally going to listen to him.) “The change in him has seemed sudden, and since you said something I have noticed that he’s been avoiding being with any of us one-on-one. It’s always as a group. But I’m also not convinced this is anything more than a new submissive trying a little too hard to please his Dominants. He loves you, Steve, he adores you, and unlike in his own world you actually love and value him back. That’s a powerful thing, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this behaviour started after your first scene together.”
“Officers!” Steve called, stepping forward shield-hand first, leaving no doubt as to who he was. “Everything under control? Do you need any support?” The ensuing delay was brief, but it gave Spiderman the time he needed to slip out off the bodega and take to the air, swinging smoothly from building to building with a speed that would have made Steve nauseous to even look at in his pre-serum days.
Steve and Bruce had spent the morning together, reading
Steve’s every muscle ached pleasantly. Even with all of the EDITH-led solo missions he'd taken on lately, it had been ages since he’d felt truly challenged on a physical level. He’d forgotten what it was to get enough of a workout that he felt tired—actually tired—rather than simply taking the edge off the overfull energy stores the serum had gifted and cursed him with. But Bucky and Sam, who between them had super-soldier enhancements, military training, and intimate familiarity with Steve’s fighting techniques? They’d been more than a match for Steve on several occasions, especially when they’d put aside their snarky competitiveness to work together.
“Go use the washroom before we get settled.”
“Oh don’t mind him. He’s just pissed that he had to fly here with a warmed-up behind, that’s all. Tried to take off on me last night so he could get here sooner.” It was clear that Tony had sustained no real damage, and that he bore no actual ill-will towards Rhodes; indeed, he emerged from the kitchen bearing two steaming mugs, one of which he handed off with a smile he couldn’t quite turn into a frown despite his best efforts. It was still a surprise, though, to hear Rhodes speak so casually of punishing Tony, whom Steve had thus far found to be almost rigidly well-behaved as a submissive. (Maybe he felt safer, somehow, bratting with Rhodes? Something to keep an eye on. It wasn’t like Steve wanted to punish Tony, but he wanted him to feel safe seeking out more minor corrections if and when he needed them.)
“Poker game in Dublin,” Pepper finished. “God how many times do I have to tell him that was
He and Bruce talked for a couple more hours after that. Bruce discussed switches (who made up most of the population, and who, Bruce stressed, were not essentially baseline; they needed elements of both Dominance and submission intensely); he detailed the ways in which Orientation testing had shifted in recent years to allow for social factors to also play a role; and he noted some of the biological and anatomical impacts of orientation (submissives, for instance, had knee-joints with enhanced flexibility that made it possible for them to kneel for long periods with no negative effects). The latter made Tony’s mind flash back to a purple pillow on the floor of the penthouse living room, and he grinned.
Well, that was more porn that I've ever written and I'm dying. But, even though it's a bit later in the day than usual, I'm back for the second week in a row! Yay!
“Pleasepleaseplease.” They were the first coherent words he’d spoken for close to an hour, yet Tony’s voice sounded as raw as if he’d spent the entire time screaming. Natasha’s breasts bounced as her pace began to speed up ever so slightly.
“Self…you have got to be kidding me. He’s going to stop me from harming myself by killing me? How does this make sense? And what the hell do you mean anyway, access denied? They’re
“That was…I mean, it’s not like it’s easy to forget you’re a God or whatever, because have you seen your arms? But it’s different to actually see it used for something like that. You fought a
Peter held Steve there and screamed until he was hoarse. He shouted accusations and curses and pleas, jumping from one of Steve’s faults to the next with little in the way of logical transition. None of it was anything Steve hadn’t thought of himself in the last several days, but there was still something particularly horrifying about hearing it all laid out by a desperate, broken teenager. (
“What?”
“You can’t touch anything for SI. When the board finds out about all of this they’re going to search for any sign at all that I knew before they did and didn’t inform them; there’s still a few members of the old guard who will never forgive me for not going back to weapons production and are always looking for opportunities to oust me now that y—he’s gone. A sudden increase in projects from R&D that could only have been made by you…I can’t chance it, I’m sorry.”
“Bruce, Bruce, it’s, please, I—I—mmmf, Bruuuuuce.”
“I guess it’ll be good training for college dorms, right? I mean, if you can negotiate a chore chart with literal superheroes, a 19 year old who hogs the common area and eats all the good chips is going to be a snap.”
A sensible question about two people I happen to respect a great deal. Allow me to show you (this scene takes place in chapter 42, in between the conversation between Tony, Rhodey, Pepper, and the team and the following morning where we see Tony waking up) :
“Let’s start with the…less good news. I know that all of us were anxious to find out to what extent these recent submissive episodes of Tony’s look to be signifiers of a pattern. The contract he sent over doesn’t contain enough information for me to feel comfortable making a call either way on that. Tony lacks experience and knowledge in many or most areas related to both sexual and non-sexual submission. He doesn’t seem to have any sense at all how he’ll respond to pain, for instance, or to what degree he’d be interested in practicing submission outside of isolated scenes.” The team deflated just slightly, as Phil had known they would. They all so desperately wanted some kind of evidence that they weren't forcing Tony into a mold that truly didn’t fit him that anything but decisive proof that he was a born submissive was always going to be a let down. “But he’s expressing a willingness to experiment with a wide range of options. His only current hard limits are scat, breathplay, and harsh humiliation. There are several other soft limits that you can review, and I’ve made a few notes about other scenarios I think we should avoid for the time being.”
“Tony, I don’t
“Oh. I. No, I just thought having a prop would make me feel less foolish. Also they never give me enough ketchup for how much food I order at these places.”
By the time he finally stepped into the shop to meet Dr. Chimva, it felt like a physical presence surrounding him, slowly growing more and more present and separating him from the rest of the world. Even the fact of Rhodey’s presence, solid and constant and comforting, could barely penetrate the barrier. He managed a half-smile in his friend’s direction.
Tony made a jagged, broken noise. But he didn’t voice a single word of argument, and that was all the confirmation Steve really required. (He wanted Tony, would always want Tony, but he wasn’t who or what Tony needed now.) Rhodes tightened his grip on his friend and nodded just once. If Steve wasn’t mistaken there was a respect in the man’s expression that he’d never earned from Rhodes before.
didn’t sound like a kid of Tony’s, Steve thought with a slightly hysterical laugh, he didn’t know what would.
Other than the occasional escaped boomerang arrows and bursts of conversation, Tony’s presence faded into the background with shocking ease. It wasn’t that Peter ever forgot the other man was there. (Was such a thing even possible when it came to a personality as big and loud as Tony Stark’s?) It was more like the kind of not-uneasy quiet that could descend in a room when people understood one another well enough to not need to remain constantly aware of and engaged with one another. In a way, it was almost like being with Ned. Except where the two of them could fall back on all the comfort and familiarity of a long-held friendship, here Tony was allowing the shared language of science and dedication to the weird work of superheroing to achieve a similar effect. It was somehow both less and more than Peter had anticipated, and he was almost more at ease than he’d felt in a long time. Almost.
“Not this time, sugar cookie. Let’s just get you back in bed and we’ll talk more tomorrow, alright?”
“Tony?” Pepper’s voice had taken on a slightly higher pitch, which he was entirely too familiar with. She was repeating herself, likely not for the first time, and growing increasingly displeased about it. “I’m heading into my office. And I love you, but when you camp out in there you break things and provide inappropriate commentary whenever I’m on the phone, neither of which I find as charming as Steve does.”
“I am fine, thank you Captain Rogers.”
good. You worry so much about being good for us, being submissive enough, when the truth of it is we can barely keep up with you. That’s…Tony, waiting to orgasm like that, denying yourself that way while you wait for your Dominants’ approval, that’s deeper submissive behaviour than I would have dreamed of expecting from you at this point. But we can’t just…we need to talk about this, okay? How did it make you feel, that kind of submission?”
Domen had been so pleased by how the journalling had worked that she had Steve doing it regularly. Last session she’d told him to reflect a bit more on something he’d said in the first entry—the bit about how the version of Steve that had loved Tony had been his best self, and how he saw that person as distinct from who he was now. It had been a damn hard task, and he’d lost a good chunk of the notebook he was using by scribbling a few lines and then promptly tearing the page out, unable to even look at the thing. He’d wound up with something far less composed and fleshed-out than the previous entry, and he instinctively pressed the notebook tighter against himself. (It wasn’t as if she would insist on reading it, Domen had promised never to do that unless he volunteered the information, but he still felt ashamed that the signs of his struggling with the relatively minor job he'd been asked to do were everywhere.)
“So anyway, I was trying to take a look at whatever paperwork the other version of me had drawn up. I mean, we gotta be similar, right? And he at least knew what the hell he was doing. Only…”
He returned several minutes later, assessed Tony with a quick glance, and nodded.
Tony, and the thought of allowing this new version to take his place as if he’d never been there didn’t sit right with Steve.
“Sorry sweetheart. If it’s any consolation, I’m thinking about you.”
“You start, Peter, since you’re the newb.”
E. Yudkowsky, “Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk.” In
“Why did it have to be with minimal public attention? He’s a bad guy, a really bad guy.”
“it takes”
“I…I couldn’t do much, obviously. But JARVIS gave me some suggestions, and I tried my best. He seemed a little more stable by the time he finally dropped off to sleep, but I can’t be sure.” The frustration drained slowly from Nat’s expression and posture, leaving her standing in the middle of the room looking suddenly tired and small. (Natasha almost never actually looked even half as tiny as she was. It was one of the things Tony had always admired about her.)
“You got almost all of them right, you know. You could stand to brush up on your postcolonial literature, sure, but it was a pretty respectable showing on the whole. No need to run out of the place like your ass is on fire.”
The thing that Tony had learned about starvation was that after a while, your body didn’t feel like it
“It would be extremely difficult, and I would have to consult with my counterpart as to the consequences. It is challenging enough magic to explore the potential futures of my own universe; doing so in another is difficult enough to debilitate me for weeks. However, I do know that there are futures where you depart this universe for your home, and while I think you many things, Stark, I do not believe you would be so irresponsible as to make such a choice if the risk it posed to that world was too great.” Everything and everyone he had tried desperately not to think of since he’d tumbled into this universe all surfaced with crushing ferocity. Pepper would pretend not to have been crying, just as she always did; Rhodey, by contrast, would unashamedly cry like a baby while holding onto Tony so tightly it would border on strangulation. Peter…god, he had no idea what Peter would do, probably make a terrible movie reference and then awkwardly try to decide whether or not to hug Tony, until Tony took the decision out of the kid’s hands and held him, longer and tighter than he’d been able to do on the battlefield. “It would, however, be a one-way trip,” Strange added.
“Participants,” JARVIS said, in that same flat tone from before, “will need to extract the ring from the maze to continue.”
“When?” Rhodey asked, and everyone who forgot Rhodey was a literal rocket scientist and the farthest thing in the world from stupid deserved a kick in the face, because he was apparently already caught up. “Afghanistan?”
“So, I’m going to get this part out of the way first, so that there’s no unnecessary drama later,” Rhodey declares. “I knew about Tony. And before you get in a snit about it, Rogers, I’d ask you to remember that Tony himself gave Peter permission to tell anyone he wished. He chose to inform Pepper and myself, and given that we are his oldest friends, I certainly hope that’s something you can understand.” Steve nods stiffly.    “Good. You should also know that it was Tony’s suggestion that Peter not tell you he was still alive, and that when he asked me I totally agreed with him.”
“This was a big, emotional scene for both of you. I’m not remotely surprised that you did. I’ll admit to being a little eager to hear the details,” he confessed, and they both laughed a little when this made Tony whine low in his throat. (Such an exhibitionist, their boy, except it was also something sweeter than that. Oh from reports Tony did get off on being watched, but Steve suspect it was also that he was happy to know how much the team thought and talked about him.) “You’ve both done well this morning. Tony, you did exactly the right thing by calling for me so we could help make sure you and Steve were both alright. I’m very proud of you, and we can negotiate a reward the next time we scene. Steve,” he continued, not giving Tony the chance to resist the praise, “I can only imagine what it took for you to ask for another Dominant right now. Thank you for trusting me with you and yours.”
With Coulson’s departure for SHIELD, Tony found himself entirely alone in the Tower for the first time since arriving in this universe. It was the best chance he was probably going to get to leave undetected, and he gave the possibility real consideration as he wandered down to the shop. If he stuck around much longer, he was going to start getting attached to this version of the team, who was so close to his own and yet nothing like them at all. As Tony didn’t really have anything to work on down here (he’d completed his repairs and upgrades to Rhodey’s armour several days prior), he ended up perched on one of the benches, patting absently at Butterfingers.
“No,” he repeated, drawing his hands back and away. Unable to witness the hurt that he knew would be drawing her face into tight lines now, he stood and began to pace. “I’m not…I can’t be who you want, alright? I’m leaving today. All I need from you is for you tell me if your Stark had any kind of provisions in his will for this kind of situation.”
“Not being on holiday sucks,” Clint was complaining. “New York is like Eeyore personified right now, I’m already losing my tan I swear. And I miss James, and the ocean, and that really good pizza place by the Malibu house that always delivers for us.”
The ageplay verse is of course a kind of happy AU where no one dies and Tony gets all the best parts of Hamilton. I also used that one to think through Steve/Eliza parallels; it’s so easy to read Steve as one of the other major male characters in Hamilton, but canonically Steve seems so often to define himself and his actions based on loving others, so I really wanted to take that up here and think about what it would be like if the world actually let him do that instead of tragically ripping it away.
The words set off a chain-reaction that brought every ongoing process to a stuttering halt, everything now devoted to processing a confusing string of mixed reactions—fear, arousal, and confusion all vied for top billing.
“I think we should probably talk, sweetheart. Is that alright with you? Did you get what you needed from your quiet time yesterday?”
“If the derivative of a function f(x) is given by f’(x)=x²-3x-10, on what interval does f(x) decrease?”
“Alright, so JARVIS has registered his vote. Now, Dummy, I was impressed by your style, but I gotta take off some points for the fact that you tried to Fury Road it. And Butterfingers, you know that if you break your brother, You is just gonna make you do all the extra work, right?” You, the only one not to receive a reprimand, chirped hopefully. “See, but you went and tried to tattle, and that’s just not cool either, buddy. I think I gotta give this one to Dummy. Barnes, you’re the tiebreaker.” Barnes surveyed the bots with a furrowed brow, even had JARVIS replay the footage like it was fuckin’ Sports Centre, which…yeah, he was definitely getting into the spirit of the thing, Tony could give him that.
“That is difficult to say, and I would like Mr. Stark’s permission to monitor his levels on a fairly regular basis for the next six months at least. If I were going to speculate right now, however…his numbers truly are extremely low given how long you’ve told me he’s been here. It is still possible, of course, that they may spike more dramatically at some point—that is why I think it crucial to track them over a more extended period—however, current data suggests it will likely be years, maybe even decades, before they reach normal levels for a submissive. They may never, in fact; it’s possible they will plateau at a certain point.”
“I fucking wish.”
The second Steve was just like that, so ruined deep beneath the surface that trying to even mark the space of the loss, let alone heal it, felt hopeless. He had barely started mourning the loss—the
After that, he and Bucky had done the whole thing right. They’d gone on a date first, just like Tony had with the others. They’d packed what was supposed to be a small basket of food with the intention of taking it out onto the beach for a picnic. This had quickly turned into a truly massive spread, mostly on account of Steve and Rhodey’s joint meddling; Steve had carefully reminded Tony that even the bastardized version of the serum running in Bucky’s veins still meant an increased metabolic demand that left him pretty constantly hungry. Rhodey, meanwhile, had made a similar play with Bucky, reminding him of how hard Tony was working to get his body accustomed to getting enough food in the course of a day. (They’d only thought to compare notes afterward, once their respective best friends were long gone and probably toasting to the success of their plans.)
“Tony, there are hundreds of people in this building, maybe into the low thousands if no one is working from home today. We’d need to rent a conference space, or—“
have him!” the man growled. “I just took Stark down in the penthouse. God, whoever recommended you idiots is going to have some serious explaining to do when this is all over. Now whichever of you haven’t been taken down out by the weird indoor tornadoes and whatever other nonsense Stark cooked up, get your asses up here and deal with the rest of the armour that’s up here. I’d like to get out of here before Captain America realizes we’ve killed his boyfriend. Again.”
“You have no idea how sorry I am to disturb you both, Tony, truly.”
Two members of the team also practice some elements of their relationship in front of Tony. It is discussed first, and Tony is (offscreen) given a safeword as well as the explicit invitation to leave if anything is uncomfortable for him to witness. This would be a hard one to skip since, well, it's a D/s universe so stuff like this will happen, but I can still help redact the chapter if needed.
There was no arguing against Community Day, something the team had long ago learned and (mostly) accepted, so they all departed for their own floors without much of a production. Someone did mutter something disparaging about ‘that damn
(See the end of the chapter for
Those of you who are excited to see Steve and Tony get a move on things, I hope you enjoyed this! Also remember that they have a long way to go. Tony was acting out of kindness in what he believed to be a medical emergency. He is nowhere near ready to be submitting to Steve for real, and vice versa. (But don't let me totally rain on your parade! It's still a step. Hell, they're in the same space for the first time in ages, so that's a step all on its own...)
Fortunately for both of them, when Peter was actually conscious—hungover and heartbroken and just waiting for Steve to turn on him—Steve just couldn’t make himself confirm the worst of what the boy expected. Instead, he hauled the television down from his bedroom and got it balanced on some boxes so that they could watch a weird but charming show about an American football coach moving to the UK to coach soccer. When Peter’s friend MJ made her way downstairs with Sam and Bucky, they got another couple of the hospital beds set up and watched together. Peter even endured MJ’s teasing with relatively good grace, even when she dangled macaroni and cheese slathered in hot sauce (apparently Sam’s creation) under his nose.
“Good to hear your voice on here again, Iron Man.”
“You don’t have to—”
Tony also wanted it known that he overcame a lot of temptation when he’d finally managed to break in. Howard’s notes on his contributions to the super-solider project were there, for fuck’s sake. Tony could have finally figured out what the hell Vita-Rays were, or whether St—Rogers had been pulling his leg about that portion of the experiments all along. And Tony had walked by them, determined to stay focused and avoid any of the catastrophes that tended to be the result of allowing his curiosity free reign.
“We can always try to help him sort that out after Tony and his aunt take care of the bigger stuff,” Clint suggested with a shrug. Natasha shook her head decisively.
“So your Aunt and Mr. Hogan, they’re getting on alright then?”
“Mine T—I, that is, Mine
“Yeah, actually. I mean we haven’t scened together so I can’t speak from a Dom’s perspective, but I don’t feel any less satisfied or reassured than I would if I were cuddled up with one of the others. Is that somethin’ you been worried about?” Tony shrugged, then petted Bucky’s hair in apology when the gesture jostled his head.
These days, the trickle had turned into more of a steady flow. Several days after Tony dropped the bomb about the Soul Stone and its use in both universes, Coulson hijacked their usual complaining-about-their-alternative-selves session to recap it all.
“I really don’t want—”
Following FRIDAY’s directions, he found the three men in the gym. By now it was not a remotely unfamiliar sight to watch Steve training—the guy worked out more than anyone Peter had ever known—but it was a highly unwelcome surprise to realize that the man wielding the shield was not in fact Steve Rogers at all. Steve was not even in his suit. He sat in the same khakis and button down shirt he’d been wearing that morning, shouting out instructions and encouragement to Sam Wilson who appeared to be attempting to hit Bucky with the shield.
Word traveled quickly after that. Tony, who loved being around the team but who was also unused to having constant company, usually took one day a week to spend on his own. This quickly became the team’s time to gather on Phil’s floor and rant about themselves. Sometimes the complaints were funny, such as when Natasha threw a less-than-dignified drunken fit over learning her other self had been blonde for the end of the world.
“Yeah you try that one out on Rhodes or Stevie, okay? In the meantime, I’m gonna get out of here so that Bruce can come do your check-in, and so you can spend your usual time with Phil. But I’d like…would it be okay if we have lunch together? I find myself not really wanting to be far from you today.”
“JARVIS, unlock storage vault 19B and have it brought up from the sub-basement to the workshop level ASAP. Key its access to P. Coulson, override code 9204112. And have it delivered by one of the service bots, we can’t have anyone knowing he’s here. In fact, Blackout conditions for all but the team, please.” Coulson moved through this workshop with maybe even more ease than Tony himself, ordering JARVIS around and digging tools out of the wrong damn places, and was Phony some kind of neat-freak or had the team
“There never was a child. Wanda was…no one, including us,
“I didn’t mean to,” Bucky said miserably, and Tony would be damned if even his embarrassment was going to undo all the hard work he’d done to bring them to that point. He tipped his head, exposing the length of his neck the way all the Doms in the house seemed to love, and looked up at Bucky through slightly hooded eyes.
“Does it bother you, that I’ve been hanging with your friend? I’m not trying to steal her away or something, she’s just really cool. It’s been a while since I worked with someone in the lab that could keep up with both the science and the snark at the same time.” Steve chuckled as he collected the pile of wrappers, bottles, cans, and other detritus that was the inevitable outcome of the team staying still for any real length of time. Most of them worked intensely physical jobs, plus many of them had physiological enhancements that had correspondingly high caloric demands; snacking was simply a fact of life in the Tower.
“Why?”
“I’m not your absolution. You don’t get to feel better—”
“Sir, the person in question was making private contact in order to warn the team in advance that Captain Rogers is in moderately severe Dominant deprivation.” Well that…that changed things. Tony glanced at the screen, desperately seeking any evidence at all that the battle appeared to be wrapping up. But the remaining owls were now capable of reproducing and triggering some kind of rapid growth cycle; several of them were now large enough that they were capable of teaming up to lift Thor off his feet by his cape, causing him to bellow in outrage. “Sir? I can contact Ms. Potts. I’m sure under the circumstances she would agree that the slight risk of your exposure to the public is outweighed by the discomfort it may cause you to attend to Captain Rogers in such a state.”
“I had quite forgotten how merciless you can be when in the correct mood, mine Steve. I am torn between joy at seeing you thus and fear for my own prospects.”
“Is this a decommissioned base? Seriously? You missin’ work that much, buddy?” Tony teased. “And don’t the Air Force and Army kind of hate each other, isn’t that like a thing?” Rhodey drew back his faceplate, smirking.
“I’m doin’ fine, Tony. It’s nice of you to come by; you’re a good friend. Do you want anything to eat or drink?”
Yet another uncharacteristic pause from the AI, but Steve was too impatient and excited to try to parse out its meaning. He tapped his foot on the ground, then stood up to pace.
In many ways, it felt exactly like the loving chaos he remembered from the little time he’d spent with the Avengers. Clint was running across the bar, dodging peanuts being thrown at him with impressive accuracy by Natasha and yells directed at him by Phil Coulson. Steve was in the kitchen and had his back to all of them, though his shoulders were shaking suspiciously with what Peter was sure was laughter. Next to him, Bruce was leaning against the counter and stirring something in a pot with one hand while he used his chin to turn the page of a book he was reading in the other. Thor was in the living room, where he appeared to be experimenting with attaching various objects to his hammer and then summoning it. Judging by the spilled pile of sour patch kids and broken pop tarts on the floor, many of them had been unsuccessful trials. Tony, who Peter would have expected to be right in the middle of the action, sat smiling but quiet on one of the big lounge chairs. He looked even more worn down than the last time Peter had seen him, though he definitely perked up when he looked Peter’s way. He hugged May, which appeared to be a regular thing between the two of them, and after only a brief moment of hesitation, he brought his hand down on Peter’s shoulder.
Several members of the team had been in favour of making the collar entirely on their own. They probably had enough skills between them to do it, but they were unevenly distributed enough that some people would likely have felt far more included and involved than others. Phil had been the one to veto that particular plan after finding an exhausted Clint trying to read up on the basics of leatherworking in the vents at SHIELD.
“Kidding!” he almost shouted, then shoved a heavy box of books at her. “Help me re-alphabetize these as we shelve? No matter what he says, Happy was not respecting my system.”
.”  The harsh words weren’t surprising, there were plenty of those to go around these days. But the fact that it was Natasha barking them while jumping off the piece of wrecked lab-bench she had been sitting on to get right in Barton’s face, that was shocking to pretty much everyone, particularly Clint himself. Tony graced her with a nod and even a small quirk of his lips. (Even in the midst of all of this, Steve spared a heartbeat or two to acknowledge that he was achingly jealous of Nat for that exchange.)
Tony wondered suddenly whether or not the name Ty Stone would be familiar to the Rhodey of this world. Had he, like the other version of himself, seen Tony at his lowest romantically as well as in other contexts? Was this where the protective streak came from? Or was it the submission thing? Or both? Whatever it was, that particular tone in Rhodey’s voice, the one that promised to rain fire down on anyone who so much as looked at Tony the wrong way, made him inappropriately giddy for a couple of seconds.
“You’re on, Potts.”
Natasha came a few days later. She’d insisted on reviewing the information Phil had already compiled, keen eyes roving over the screen seeking out patterns and connections that just weren’t there to make yet. He could feel her frustration, felt it himself every time Tony responded differently than they expected or said something that just didn’t quite make sense.
“You won’t…you won’t leave, will you?” Tony asked. Steve’s heart clenched even as a part of him wanted to laugh at the irony. If Tony had any idea of just how many people it would take to force Steve from this room right now…
Peter doesn’t know how to begin to digest this. Rhodey at least doesn’t force him to try to do it quickly, or in front of him. He turns instead to Steve, who has apparently been watching this entire scene play out with a horribly blank expression that’s worse than what Peter’s heard Bucky call his ‘kicked puppy’ look.
She flinched as soon as she registered the expression on Peter’s face. He remembered that even in the haze of the days that followed. But MJ, while brilliant and thoughtful in so many instances, becomes stubbornly defiant when truly brought to anger. Instead of uttering the apology that would have ended the entire matter right there with nothing but a few awkward moments of recovery, she crossed her arms over her chest and said nothing.
Tony had answered ‘no’ to experience with about seventy-five percent of the list, but except for a couple of hard nos, most of the ‘willingness’ category was currently blank. He scanned the table again. The stuff around pain was kind of intriguing, but without any context beyond playful hand-spankings, imagining how he would respond in any kind of detail was next to impossible. How was he supposed to know if he’d prefer crops or whips or canes? How much would be too much? He thought fleetingly about trying to order some of this stuff and experimenting on himself, but he suspected pretty strongly that trying to hide that kind of experimentation would be way more difficult than hiding the kneeling had been.
“Hello?” Sam sounded out of breath, and Steve grinned.
Around hour twelve, Tony stirred and mumbled,
He thought, very seriously, about begging Pepper to let him leave. It wasn’t as if he’d never done the incognito thing, he could go to one of his most remote properties and start over, maybe open up a little mechanic shop and live out his days fixing broken things. And there was little doubt in his mind that was how this would end, if he was lucky. But for now, he had made Pepper a promise. So he took a long, deep breath and strolled over to the bar. The ritual of making a cocktail was oddly comforting, given his relative disinterest in the booze itself. The sound of the ice tinkling against the glass, the colour of the bourbon, syrup and bitters swirling together in the mixing glass, it was exactly the same as it had always been. Well, almost exactly; there wasn’t any orange in the mini-fridge to garnish it, which made sense when he thought about it. If they hadn’t been using the penthouse much since Phony had died, of course they had kept perishables out of the fridge.
“…uh, Cap? What the hell are you doing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sure, but he didn’t
“This is mine to hold for now.”
Which was what was making the sight of them laconically draped over various pieces of penthouse furniture almost unbearable. Clint hadn’t moved for so long that Steve was genuinely confused about how he’d managed to avoid the need for bathroom breaks; some of the others were slightly more mobile, though rarely for any longer than it took to make a phone call or retrieve more snacks.
Headlines blaming Sam for seducing Steve away from the recent memory of his lost True love had topped every tabloid, blog, and social media feed. Sam had been followed everywhere for months, called every name in the book including several racist epithets that had had Steve wondering why he’d ever bothered to save the United States in the first place. The Avengers PR team had put out statements unequivocally denouncing both the rumoured romance and the harassment and threats that were being directed toward Sam. But gradually, the whole thing grew into yet another area of Steve’s life that provoked a whole host of negative feelings—guilt, anger, regret—and the time in between calls and visits grew longer and longer.
“And yet look at how deeply and completely you care for your son, after not but a few years. You defeated fate for him, Tony Stark, stood against Gods and men and the forces of the universe itself. How could you still then wonder if the pain of the loss is worth what it is to be loved in such a way?”
“Well, Sir, as you would not permit the entrance of any of the other members of the team, I was forced to get more creative.” JARVIS didn’t sound remotely apologetic, and Steve decided to take the AI’s almost business-like tone as inspiration for how to proceed.
My feelings about my own role…well, as one would imagine, they’re complicated. There was little love lost between Stark and I, but I still regretted that this was the only possible ending to his story. He deserved better from this universe.
“Turn us around and take us through again.”
“Huh. Sounds like the other Steve might have finally made a single right call after all,” he opined. Sam’s head whipped around to face him so quickly that it would have been hilarious had it not been equally heartbreaking to see Sam so surprised at having his value recognized. Tony snickered.
“You’re going to give it everything you’ve got, Cap,” he said firmly. “Until you do you’re not really going to believe it, and you’ll never sleep. Come on.”
for these people while still somehow under the impression that he was little more than an inconvenience to them.) “They were my first attempts at real modularity, and auto-piloting. None of it was enough to save Pep. She woulda died if it wasn’t for Extremis,” Bruce jerked almost violently in his seat next to Steve, but didn’t interrupt, “and I don’t know how many suits he had on hand or anything, but the things you’ve told me about Taskmaster…I think it could really work.”
“No, you’re fine. I just didn’t get much of a break this morning; the team that was in Italy just got back and pretty much all of them needed some immediate care.” The last Steve had heard the mission in Turin had been going along swimmingly; what had happened to change that drastically enough that everyone involved needed psychological support as part of their debrief? “Put your SHIELD hat away, Director Rogers. Agent Romanov is handling it. I shouldn’t have brought it up at all and I apologize.” She finished the last bite of her bar (the high-protein, high-energy ones that SHIELD bought by the case and kept available throughout the building), wiped her hands on her pants to dislodge crumbs, and then began to rifle through the dark green briefcase next to her. “I assume you did your homework?”
“I like you,” he said simply. “I want to be more than friends with you, have for a long time now. There were reasons it needed to wait, some of them pretty legitimate. Others, Bucky has repeatedly informed me, are bullshit. And I'll probably have more screw-ups like that. This is so complicated, both our histories with other people and with each other, but I’m done letting that stop me. If I’ve read things wrong and you aren’t interested, or you need to think about it, then there’s no pressure, I don’t mean that. But from my side of things, I’m thoroughly sick of the whole ‘out of time’ thing. For once I want to just be right where I am, with exactly who I’m with, and I’d really like it if that included you.”
His resolve was put to the test mere seconds after he exited the elevator. The rest of the team was absent; now that he thought about it, Steve vaguely remembered something about an inter-galactic diplomacy training session at SHIELD that Nat was taking the lead on, and which Clint, Phil, and Thor were all attending. He wasn’t sure about Bruce or Bucky, though he knew the latter had lately expressed some interest in getting to know at least the basics of the team’s most commonly used medical procedures so that he could help out if Bruce was Hulked out and unavailable. Perhaps they were spending the day working on that together.
His confidence had, admittedly, faltered when they had pulled up to a mall of all places, but as usual Bucky managed to be amused rather than hurt or angered by Steve’s skepticism.
As he watched Phil’s fingers trace reverently over the gleaming white keys of the piano that Obie had been the last to touch (at least in Tony’s own universe), he considered that maybe it wasn’t his presence here that felt odd, but rather the team’s. Unlike the Tower and the Compound, the Malibu home had only ever been his. Yes, he’d cemented his role as Iron Man here, but it had also been the last place in the world except for a cave in Afghanistan that he’d been just Tony Stark. After it had been destroyed he’d never bothered to rebuild, turning his attention instead to the team, and to defending the Earth alongside them. It hadn’t even felt like much of a loss, not at first, not until everything had fallen apart and there was nowhere left to go that wasn’t linked to one bittersweet (or just plain bitter) memory or another. And now the team was
Natasha, who had been absent from the Tower that morning, was the only one who met Tony’s eyes. But where the others appeared defeated, Natasha was in intel-gathering mode. It was the same as Tony had always known it to be, a hint of seduction (plump lips, slightly hooded eyes, open posture) masking the sharp way she studied every inch of her target. The only difference was the hint of a frown playing at her lips; unlike his Natasha, she didn’t seem to want to be looking at Tony this way.
Tony was flying. He was sore, too, but the ache in his ass and thighs was a part of that, not a detriment or an inhibitor; every time he moved enough to awaken the edges of pain, he soared just a little higher. He spent several glorious moments stretching out into various configurations around the bodies beside him in bed just to feel the pull of sore skin over muscle and bone, and to feel the clarity of mind that accompanied it. Subspace was normally something fuzzy and slow, and that was pleasant in its own way, but this, it was like he was entirely himself but just
“Good,” he said again, a hint of a smirk playing at the corners of his lips. “You’ve eaten?” Recalling the item on the checklist about honorifics, Tony faltered, unsure how to address the man in front of him. He settled for avoiding the matter altogether and replied only with a jerky nod. “Excellent. Then why don’t you go get yourself comfortable in the living room, alright? I’ll be in in just a second.”
And yet, the mythos is not entirely a fiction. It derives from something deeply real, a way in which the biological and social components of True Dominants and submissive are in near perfect alignment. Perhaps, nauseating though I may find it personally, it is better that I show you…
I'm catching up on a few weeks of Asks here, so if by any chance I missed yours, please let me know! The Doctor may have an ego on him, but he'd never leave anyone out intentionally.
He wanted to say no. It was terrifying to face the prospect of actually acknowledging what had happened between them when all Tony had tried to do all day was erase it from his mind. But then, it wasn’t like that had really worked, was it?
“Cap has done far worse than yell at me, Frosty, don’t worry about it.” Barnes still seemed skeptical, even downright worried. But after an evaluative look that lingered too long on Tony’s shaking left hand, he placed the bag Steve had shoved at him carefully in Dummy’s claw.
“Rhodes said, and everything we’ve learned seems to confirm, that other than orientation, everything with the team seems to have been pretty much the same in his universe up to and including the Battle of New York,” she recited. Coulson nodded.
“SI does not do unpaid internships. Sorry kid, but Pepper has very strong feelings on this topic. If it’ll make you feel better, though, I’ll send you on coffee runs every once in a while. Really demeaning, lots of modifiers on the drinks and plenty of yelling if anything in the order is wrong.” While Peter frowned at the news that he wouldn’t be forced to work for a billionaire for free, Tony pressed forward, hoping the last of what he had to say wouldn’t be too far, too fast. “At some point, you gotta pick someone to trust, kid. SHIELD has resources, and a lot of legal and social apparatuses designed to protect people like us if things go wrong. If you end up deciding to go in that direction, because you probably will see Steve around at some point and he is kind of annoyingly likeable, I don’t blame you. But if you want to play the free agent game a while longer, it might be a good idea to have someone on your side.”
“Give me one reason. One damn good reason that you’d send this to my office without notice for explanation. For why you’d lie to your Dominants, your friends, and hole up down here without the slightest regard for your safety or basic hygiene, from the smell of things down here. Convince me so that I don’t use this very handy suit to just haul you up to them right now, Tony, because so help me—”
“But?”
“Clint and I got a little too ambitious with a particularly intricate bit of bondage, that’s all.” The airiness in her tone was the polar opposite of the hard lines that suddenly formed on Bruce’s face.
“Mount Sinai,” Natasha said after consulting her phone. (And who the hell were her sources, anyway? Steve apparently still did not have half the intel she did.)
Steve couldn’t take not touching Thor for another second. He turned in his spot and wrapped a bracing arm around the width of his partner's chest. For several seconds they clung to one another in silence.
“What’s the point? You’re not going to listen to me without Jay’s confirmation anyway.” He’d expected a slap on the ass, or maybe a harsh tug at his hair, but instead Bruce’s hands had withdrawn entirely, and he’d waited with his usual unnerving calm for Tony to meet his eyes.
There were pages and pages of experiments that grew increasingly desperate. And then Howard had apparently cracked the case…by taking a nap.
“And that,” Clint concluded with a flourish, sending paint flying from his rollerbrush and into Thor’s long golden hair, “is why Steve is not allowed to see Tony on Thursdays.”
“Excluding Stark Industries staff, maintenance workers, and others not on a need to know basis regarding your presence here: Dr. Banner, or rather his green companion, is in the playroom in the sub-basement. Captain Rogers is due to return shortly, though he has a scheduled appointment that I would not suggest interrupting. And Agent Coulson is working from his office in the Tower today.”
“But the problem is most of those options are portals only to specific dimensions. So if Tony’s in the one we happen to pick then great, but if not then we’re worse off than we started. Plus some of them, like the Mirror Dimension, still require that Sling Ring thing to get back.” “And stealing one of those really isn’t an option?” Harley asked for at least the tenth time.
And there's some excellent questions awaiting the Doctor, so keep an eye out for those over the next couple of days, too!
“And the guy he was going after?”
“Shall we, what exactly? You have a thing, remember?”
Of all the Avengers, Clint was the one she would have expected such a cool welcome from the least. He always seemed so easy-going and calm, particularly when compared to the many higher strung members of the team. But there was nothing relaxed about the way he towered over Pepper, leaving her just enough room to step out of the elevator without getting caught in the doors. The use of physical intimidation, even if unintentional, was galling, especially given the garbage she was facing at SI. She deliberately stepped into his space, crossing her arms.
Thank you so, so much for reading and commenting! I'm having a blast writing this.
“What if I do it?”
Content Notes: Canon-typical violence, though nothing overly graphic.
“Yeah yeah, you were right.”
By the time it was over, Harley was sniffling, and not at all delicately or quietly.
“…perhaps.” Steve rearranged them so that they sat back to back. It felt a little absurd, but not being able to see Thor sort of had the effect Steve had heard sometimes happened when one of a person’s senses was removed: the others became hyperaware, as if to compensate. He felt intensely conscious of the pace and sound of Thor’s breathing, the delicate sniffs that indicated he might be near tears. Steve felt Thor’s shoulders shake as his partner murmured,
They went several rounds like that, Natasha trying to calm him and redirect his attention and Tony focused on the only thing that felt like it might actually help. Seeming to realize her efforts were pointless, Natasha’s look of frustration morphed into the calculating, thoughtful expression Tony recognized from missions.
Taskmaster stood over the prone form of the Iron Man suit. He wore the same white, skeletal mask as always, but he’d never bothered to fix it after Steve’s brutal beat-down weeks prior. It was cracked in several places and outright shattered in others, revealing a series of barely-healed fractures and abrasions in the early stages of scarring. Somehow the sight of the man’s skin made him look less human than when he wore the full mask, particularly when he leaned down close enough the cool blue of the arc reactor that the light mixed with the angry red of the marks to create a sickly, unnatural hue.
“Pep—Pep needs to be safe.”
“It is 2018, Sir. Excuse me, Avengers, but per security protocol 731-B, I performed a full body analysis when the new arrival entered the Tower. There are some crucial variations in Sir and the previous Mr. Stark’s anatomy, which I can review with you on a holoscreen. However, I can say with great certainty that this is some version of Anthony Edward Stark.”
“Best I can figure, Taskmaster’s backers are starting to get antsy. Tony put them on watch last week. He told them that he knows what they’ve been doing, and that he’s going to expose them one way or another as soon as he can.”
In less than two minutes he had logged into the SI systems and was gleefully slicing his way through the various firewalls and protections around Fletcher’s personal server. His calendar listed him as in a meeting with Melissa Collins, the current director of CNOW. (Hold on, Tony had made fun of that acronym before, somewhere in Steve’s files…)
“Nine Inch Nails? Seriously? I didn’t even know you could get their stuff on vinyl.” The corners of Coulson’s mouth twitched just slightly.
The reminder that Tony was asking for this, that he had actively chosen pain over the prospect of further pleasure was somehow both humiliating and reassuring.
“Now? Really, Doc? You couldn’t wait one damn day—”
Kissing this Steve was everything and nothing like that. It was possession and desperation and lust, of course it was. Steve parted Tony’s lips and licked his way into his mouth with brutal insistence, a dizzying dance of teeth and tongue that refused to modulate its intensity even for a second. Steve gorged himself as if he would never get enough, coming up for air only when one or both of them were gasping for it, and diving back in the second he could as if it had been millennia since they’d had the chance to touch. When he decided he wasn’t in possession of enough of Tony’s mouth, Steve growled and tipped Tony’s head backward so that the base of his skull was pressed right against his own back, and then deepened the kiss unimaginably further.
“A bit late to be offering help now, isn’t it?” The words bit; they had jagged, sharp, cutting edges that reminded Steve so much of the other version of Tony that he rocked back onto his heels as the attempt to absorb them almost bowed him over.
have, brought him to his knees and made him feel not only like his friend and teammate was pissed at him, but like he’d been a bad submissive.” Steve had known all of this already, of course had. But there was always something about hearing his mistakes methodically laid out in front of him like that that made them real, let him feel their weight and effects in a way that his self-righteous tendencies often shielded him from. Again his only reply to Bucky was silence, but the other man seemed to realize it was a very different kind of quiet this time. “If you can’t be around him we would all understand. But Stevie, you don’t get to make that choice for the rest of us. You don’t get to drive him off when we
“It’s a bit of a long story, and a lot of it isn’t mine to tell.”
Phil and the rest of the team support Steve in the aftermath of his intensive therapy session. Tony and Clint enjoy their first scene together.
It was always a little unclear which version of the man he should expect on any particular day. Given that Peter’s own feelings toward Tony Stark’s sudden presence in his life ranged from annoyance to something dangerously close to the hero-worship he’d felt as a child, he was mostly fine with living in this contradiction. On his first day as an official Stark Industries intern, though, he hadn’t really expected to enter the workshop to find it blaring with deafeningly-loud boomer rock (Zepplin, maybe?) Tony shooting arrows that, rather than hitting the wall, made U-turns midway across the room and shot back in his direction was also rather a surprise.
“Pickle juice ice cream, jerk.”
Over time, Natasha had learned the value of open and honest communication. Oh it didn’t come easy to her, certainly not the way it did to someone like Steve who would practically flay himself open for anyone who asked nicely. She would always be at home in the shadows, in the carefully woven tapestry of truth and fiction that living a life like hers so often required.
“Kinda,” he shrugged. “The other me, I guess his issues with alcohol were a lot worse than mine. There’s still a bar upstairs, but it’s mostly a show piece. He either never put in a wine cellar down here, or he took it out a long time ago.”
. If he’s starting to take on some of the biochemical characteristics of a submissive, he doesn’t want to wonder if that’s the only thing that made you want him. And if he’s not, then he worries he’ll be disappointing you all, especially you because of your classification. You can tell him that none of that is true until you’re blue in the face, but you’ve seen how empty words can be in our circles. Take this one night, before the bloodwork and the media and any of the rest of it, and show him that you’re choosing him just as much as he’s choosing you. Get dressed up, bring him flowers, hold him inappropriately close on the dance floor, the whole works. I’ll handle everything else.”
He did in fact clutch at the three of them again pretty much the second Thor had finished wiping Tony and Phil down. And he kept clinging, even once the crying was over and every touch stopped feeling like a shock on his over-sensitive skin. He made a couple of attempts to do something about Phil and Thor’s hard-ons, but was not all that surprised to find his attentions gently refused. The team clearly had an agenda today, and unless any part of it put Tony into actual distress, he was pretty sure they wouldn’t be deviating.
“Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that. This seems like as good a time as any.” It took Tony a few long seconds to catch up with this, and even longer to realize with mingled relief and disappointment that Clint had pulled away from his groin and was lying on his side next to Tony.
Those days were supposedly behind him now. He’d told May about Spider-Man, and not only had he miraculously survived that conversation, but Peter had also somehow managed to find himself officially committed to some kind of mentor/mentee thing with Tony Stark. (Who, it turned out, was not the Tony Stark of this world, but Peter tried pretty hard not to think about that very often because the whole thing was weird enough without any kind of multiverse shenanigans to consider. Plus whenever he let his mind linger too long on the other universe it sort of made him hate the other Peter, which was pretty outrageous given that Peter wasn’t even totally sure he wanted Stark around.)
are already so busy, and it’s been almost two weeks of this! We’re so close,
“Uh, well yeah I think there probably was room on the door—” Clint whooped, while Nat groaned and chucked a pillow at his head. Thor’s booming voice declared something about the almighty weight of the ‘excellent Leonardo’ being relevant, “—but of course none of that would have mattered if they’d actually brought enough lifeboats and regarded the poor folks in Third Class as humans.”
“That’s not how this goes, Tony. You don’t play us against each other like that. If you have a concern with something Clint is doing, you take it up with Clint. You only go to someone else if your Dominant is doing something dangerous like refusing to respect your safe words or hear your concerns. Is anything like that happening right now?” Chastened, Tony shook his head, though stubborn defiance still ran through every line of his body. Whatever they were struggling over, Clint was going to have a hell of a fight on his hands.
“Not sure that’ll be necessary, Dr. Domen. No offense, but I really don’t think grief counselling is necessary at this point. I need to figure out how to deal with the new Tony, not…” Domen peered down at the tablet in her lap, scrolling through a text-document. Something about it rubbed Steve the wrong way. It felt too similar to the way the first round of SHIELD doctors that he’d seen right after he’d been pulled out of the ice had looked more at their computers than at Steve himself.
“…never thought he’d be into cock warming, really.”
“Tomorrow?” he proposed. “I’d say tonight, but there’s…I have to do something, first. Is that okay?” Thor smiled, the one that illuminated all his features. (Maybe it made sense that the watch so often made Tony feel warm, given that this particular expression had always done the same, heating Tony from the inside out.) Then, telegraphing his moves widely and giving Tony plenty of chances to refuse, Thor lifted his hand and pressed a gentle kiss to the back of it.
Everyone on the team had noticed the intermittent tremors that shook Tony’s left hand, and had taken to quietly experimenting with how to prevent them, or at least reduce their intensity. When Steve made a breakthrough in the area, though, it had been entirely accidental. He’d been in bed next to Tony, who had started exhibiting early signs of disturbed sleep. Steve had started rubbing soothing circles onto the nearest part of Tony he could reach, which had happened to be his left elbow, and had been happily stunned to see his partner immediately begin calming. The trick wasn’t foolproof, but it seemed to help the tremors and other minor upsets; the touches also had the side effect of drawing contented little grunts and sighs from the submissive, as well as information if he was awake. The latter was mostly what Steve was after, and the gambit paid off.
But even if that kind of avoidance had been possible before, it simply wasn’t an option any longer. Not with subtonin now in Tony’s system, making his body as well as his mind feel the stress and guilt of unresolved issues. He took one last, long drink of his coffee and turned his attention to his submissive, who sat up straighter as if his body, at least, anticipated what was coming.
Tony touched down in Malibu just after 8:00. He was filled with a prickling, uneasy energy that crept underneath his skin, and the thought of facing the team en masse with their questions and their concern was too daunting a prospect. Evening in December really was not the ideal time to wander the seaside; the wind was constant assault, one that felt all the colder for its juxtaposition with the sand under Tony’s bare toes. But he stayed there anyway, with only the water’s indifferent regard for company. That same vaguely threatening inattention had once made Tony fear water—between the waterboarding in Afghanistan and then nearly drowning after the destruction of the Malibu house he’d had plenty of cause—but surrounded as Tony now was by ample evidence of the love and care others had for him, and by proof of his own impact on them, it was oddly comforting to feel irrelevant.
“Everything is alright, okay? This was coming, we all knew it was. I think we had just hoped it would be…well, with us.”
have gone insane. Even people whose levels have stabilized, when they’re denied access to the things they need to access their headspace, they lose the will to live. Most of them stop eating and drinking within a couple of months.” Starvation and dehydration were way too recently familiar to Tony (
Thor’s surprise at the invitation was evident, and even if it sort of broke Steve’s heart a bit he couldn’t really blame the guy. He was just starting to realize now how much his relationship with his teammates had been on autopilot while he’d mourned Tony. It would take time before they really believed that they had Steve back.
“Why would we do that? It was supposed to be a gift, Tones.” Tony had in fact financed plenty of his own gifts before, and was about to point this out to Rhodey. “We all make good money, and gift-giving is kind of a big thing for Doms. If that’s something you think you might need practice with, though, we could always take over more of the financial stuff for a while.” This was nothing less than a horrifying prospect (seriously, what was the use of being a billionaire if the people around you still felt the need to pay for stuff?), and Tony shut his mouth with an audible clack of his teeth.
“Watch the video, Mr. Parker. I have agreed to stay until it has concluded to answer any questions the two of you have, but there is no use my repeating its contents beforehand.” Peter would probably have argued this point further, but then the space between he and Harley was filled by a projection, an image Peter couldn’t have looked away from if he tried. Tony sat on an unfamiliar chair. He looked a little sad, the way he’d basically always looked in the time Peter had known him best, but all traces of the physical damage he’d endured in the fight against Thanos were done. Even his arm, the one he’d used to snap away Thanos and his army forever, appeared gloriously whole and healed.
“Well, if you want this because you feel you have something to make up for with regards to the safeword, for instance, I’m going to say no.”
“It’s been fine. Some bumps, like there always is when administration gets involved in anything, but everyone’s settling now.”
“Oh please. I lived with this dude in Wakanda for months. Ain’t nothin’ interesting about his brooding act, trust me.”
, you don’t control a single thing. You’re not Tony fuckin’ Stark here. I’m not your employee, or some government lackey you can push around. As long as we’re here like this, as long as you are consenting to be mine and as long as I’m operating within the limits we’ve established together, you don’t get a say. You don’t decide how I’ll bind you, or what what I’ll do with you when you’re there.”  Clint paused, and this lips curled into a smirk. “Unless you want to beg real pretty for something, of course, in which case I’ll consider it.”
“You don’t need to worry about that, sweetheart, I’ll take care of all the complicated stuff. You just sit there and enjoy, hmm?” There was just enough of that Steve-specific resistance still active in Tony that he hesitated for a moment, apparently unsure whether he wanted to fight the frankly ludicrous idea that a mind as complex as his couldn’t handle riding Steve’s cock. Steve heaved a put-upon sigh and glanced in Thor’s direction.
For both the third and fourth responses, you will also want to be up to date on the last update to the main verse to avoid some spoilers.
, Tony. To a Dominant that’s everything. To watch a submissive start to thrive and heal under your care, it’s way headier than the best drug. I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
“Yeah, well you didn’t ask, did you?” Tony’s eyes were on the floor, so he didn’t see whatever silent exchange took place between Pepper and Steve, but a few seconds later he grudgingly added, “Sorry.”
There's a pretty important #AskStrange response coming later this week, so keep an eye out for that too!
need the submission, Tony. You’ve responded to it strongly since basically the very beginning, when I would imagine the levels of subtonin in your system were all but insignificant.”
The boy looked exactly how Steve felt: as if he had given up. Except while Steve’s approach to hopelessness had been to languish, Peter was just as full of rage and denial as he had been the day of the battle. Steve caught him by the wrists, but Peter was almost wild in his fury, and he struggled with every bit of his enhance strength. They rolled onto the floor, Steve’s head glancing off the corner of the night-table.
He can’t remember the last time he was so excited.
The next morning’s meeting with all of the SHIELD department heads was a decidedly rough one. Steve cornered him after it was over to demand to know where Phil’s head had been at and why he hadn’t been able to recall the exact number of agents in Western Europe when asked. Phil had disabled all active monitoring in Steve’s office and then confessed.
The team went through the same checks, asked the same kinds of questions Rhodey had and more until the anticipation was damn near killing Tony. He was very close to snapping at them to just get the fuck on with it already (which was probably not the best move for someone in his position) when Steve placed a large hand across his lower back and started to speak in that low, precise tone that practically screamed Dominance.
There's also an extended scene between Tony and Clint in this chapter. Clint is, as he warns, an intense and demanding Dominant. However, a huge portion of the scene is negotiation, and everything he does is 100% consensual.
There do seem to be a few characters from what the Author refers to as the ‘comics-canon’ floating around. While most will not have major influences over the plot, I do anticipate their being mentioned and occasionally cropping up.
Tony wanted it on the record that he tried to avoid that particular conversation. It wasn’t exactly hard to get at least the bare-bones facts of what had happened, and while learning about the so-called Scarlet War had been a bit of a shock, it also had ended up making sense surprisingly quickly. Tony had come to care for Wanda in his own universe, but even there she had never been entirely stable. In this universe, where Mark II had never created the flawed version of Ultron, Sokovia had never fallen, and Wanda had never learned to see past her grudge against Tony and joined the Avengers, it made sense that all of her darker impulses had grown stronger and more deadly. Though it was a little disconcerting to realize how directly their fates seemed to be intertwined; Mark II’s relationship with his team had flourished at Wanda’s indirect expense, and in return she had taken Mark II from all of them.
“Rogers? The hell—JARVIS, what the hell? What the fuck is Cap gonna do, huh?” Steve hadn’t heard Tony that drunk in years, probably not since the immediate aftermath of him being outed as a sub. It triggered nearly ever Dominant instinct he had to protect and soothe and support; with no potential outlet for any of those compulsions, his skin immediately felt too tight around his bones and muscle.
“Mmm. I think you should go shopping.”
“I’m not a fortune teller, Stark. I can tell you the outcomes of any particular path, but even now there are a multitude of ways this conversation might play out, all of which have various benching webs of consequences that follow.”
“I’m fine,” Peter repeated. “We have what we were after. We know he’s safe and healthy and—and not coming back. Nothing else to discuss, really. So I’m fine.”
This will of course include standardized mitochondrial DNA testing, which focuses on regions of DNA referred to as micro- or mini-satellites and compares repeating sequences within those regions. This process is commonly referred to as creating a ‘DNA fingerprint.’ While Wakanda still chooses to keep most of the details of the practice a secret, their identity-testing is considered second to none because they also utilize a procedure involving the exposure of human genetic materials to small quantities of vibranium. Each unique sample supposedly responds to this process in ways that are slightly but measurably distinct, allowing for a more precise analysis.
“Put on something mindless, JARVIS. That hilarious rom-com with the guy who looks like Bruce, maybe?” Watching
“I—infinity, but—”
“I got it,” Steve volunteered, jogging to the basket and not caring remotely about the amusement he could hear his eagerness causing the rest of the team. Tony settled in front of Natasha with a quiet sigh. He was still in his suit from work, and Steve took a long moment to admire the sight, which was one he’d never seen before; the other version of Tony had needed strict boundaries between his job and his submission, which had always included changing out his suits before doing anything like kneeling. Boundaries were important and Steve had never begrudged him this, but the juxtaposition of the power and authority of Tony wearing an expensive and perfectly tailored suit while on his knees for them made Steve shiver.
Phil released, and pressed down again. On the third time, Tony came, and then promptly burst into tears. Loud, noisy, uncontrollable tears that came out of nowhere. His arms flailed, grabbing for Phil and Thor who quickly moved to bracket him on either side while Clint pressed himself right up against Tony’s back.
“I know, Tony. I understand.” Clint almost never called him by name; especially when Tony was anywhere near subspace, it was Sugar Cookie or some other absurd endearment that Tony despised almost as much as he loved. What felt like a formality from Clint was enough to signal that whatever this was, it was something else. Something different. “Way back at the beginning, we discussed giving you the opportunity to experiment with Domination. But at that point we had so much other stuff going on, and since you didn’t seem to feel particularly urgently about trying your hand at Domming, we put it on the back burner. You seem like you need
He really considered Coulson next. Phil’s dual role as his partner and the team’s handler was certainly a potential benefit, but it also meant that if he wasn’t convinced by what Steve was saying, it could backfire on Steve on multiple levels. Too risky. The previous night he had begun to give up on all of it, resigned to letting the situation just explode in their faces and dealing with the fallout when they were at least all on the same side again. That night, though, as he watched Tony eat garlic knots from Thor’s hand, it hit Steve fully why it was that he’d started to feel so scared.
“Look, some space sounds like it might be the right call for both of you. We’ll get you set up in one of the guest rooms here—but just for the night. Tomorrow you and I are going to go see your Aunt together. We’ll give her an Intro to Spiderman, and before she can get too upset about you having kept her in the dark on all of that, we’ll tell her about the internship. We’ll let her know that you won’t be working alone anymore, which is undoubtedly going to result in way fewer emergency room visits and a generally higher standard of living for both of you. Compared to what you both have been through recently, it’ll probably sound like heaven to her.”
“Tell him to stop fucking babying me,” he demanded. Steve frowned as he set the heaving bag full of food from the deli on the floor. He was surprised that Tony would try something this blatantly manipulative, but then Tony hadn’t been confronted much with the reality of a poly relationship with multiple Doms and Switches up to this point. He’d dated and scened with most of the team of course, but rarely more than one of them at once, and never in a context where he’d ended up disagreeing with one of his Dominants.
Ah, yes. I recall the revelation of Stark’s orientation being rather a scandal at the time. Let me show you…
And yes, btw, the identity of Peter's frenemy in Decathalon is supposed to be somewhat of a mystery. Gotta keep y'all on your toes!
Tony stared out at the crates, sucking in a gulp of air so large he didn’t even know his shitty, post-Afghanistan, post-Siberia lungs were capable of it. Rhodey had found them, found them
“And what do you think, Widow?” Natasha flinched at the use of her code-name, but she didn’t take her hand away. (It felt like Natalie Rushman all over again, like he was dying and she was the only one who could see.)
“Well if we’re taking responsibility for things, I had a hand in the whole not letting you leave part of the evening,” Pepper said. And how out of it was Tony that he hadn’t even seen her? True, she was sitting kind of off to the side, her barstool halfway between the kitchen the living room, but that was no excuse for just not noticing the presence of one of his closest friends. She looked tired, Tony realized with a guilty flush; she had never bothered to remove the makeup she’d been wearing the day before, and the SI hoodie she had on had a coffee stain near the left pocket. Like always, cleaning up Tony’s messes appeared to be taking a toll on Pepper.
“Mmm.  Aftercare can take all kinds of forms, some ‘floofier’ than others. Can we give a few a try, see if they work for us?”
Content Notes: Warnings for canon-typical violence for the first half of the chapter, especially the first section. (Specifically descriptions of blood/bleeding, broken bones, and threats of more intensive violence which are not realized.) Some fairly important things happen around those events, so if you want to avoid maybe drop me a line so we can sort out a redacted version.
“Mr. Stark regrets he cannot join you this evening. He has ordered specialty popcorn and candy in apology, and he hopes you enjoy your evening.”
“Stop backseat shooting and toss your damn frisbee!” Before Tony’s brain could really register everything that was utterly bizarre about this scenario, a version of Steve’s shield (lighter than the original—a vibranium alloy rather than the real thing) went flying past his head and collided with Thor. It actually managed to connect with the demigod, less, Tony suspected, because Clint had really mastered throwing the thing and more because Thor was busy attempting to make the Widow’s Bites on his wrist function.He had the gloves and gauntlets on correctly (though the gloves looked about a second from tearing at the seams), but Thor couldn’t seem to sort out how to charge the weapons.
“He’s not a Dom. Or a switch. He’s not actually classified at all. His world, it didn’t…work like that.” Steve had seen Natasha work enough by now to recognize the strategy, the way she dropped the most explosive information upfront to simultaneously gain trust and knock her target off-balance. This knowledge did not make him feel any less like his world had just imploded and then been put back together wrong for the second time in three days. “I’m your second, here at SHIELD and at the team. And after he died, I never made demands of you in that capacity. Forcing you to Dom before you went into dep, making you eat and drink and spend time outside his room, all of that I did solely as your partner without ever pulling rank.” Natasha Romanov Interrogation/Negotiation Strategy #2: follow up the information-drop with a seemingly unrelated claim. How was this still so effective when it felt like he was reading it out of a playbook he already knew cover to cover? “I’m pulling it now.” #3: Make the demand. Clear, short sentences; no room for misinterpretation. “I’m swapping you in to Talia’s upcoming op. You’ll go, clear your head, get some space from the Tower. And when you get back you’ll start working with a therapist. Not that hack you hired last time because you knew he’d never push you. Someone of my choosing.”
Steve liked May Parker a lot. It was obvious that whatever their recent difficulties had been she absolutely adored her nephew, and she was unimpressed by both her setting and the company in a way he really respected. She also didn’t mince words, a quality he normally loved in people but which became rather more complicated when the tough questions were being directed at his submissive.
to be involved in some of this. But I do get not wanting to screw anything up in terms of the asking, given that we’re kind of flying blind here.”
With a feeling akin to a rush of ice cold water down his spine, Steve realized that maybe none of that would be true of the man in the other room. This wasn’t his Tony, and he had no right to stand here, hearing this. He wouldn’t have the right until he was sure it was the current and not the former occupant of that room he wanted to kiss and hold and make love to. (And, of course, until he was sure this version of Tony wanted him, too, which might never come to pass even if Steve’s grief eventually stopped feeling so acute.) He took a long, steadying breath, and allowed himself to press his palm against the closed door for just a couple of seconds, long enough to feel the wood begin to heat beneath his fingers.
“The…the flexible containment matrix. It was…plasma, right?”
The only thing that kept him going were the nights he spent with Rhodey. At first he hid out on Rhodey’s floor mainly because it was the one place he could avoid the team (especially Steve, who seemed to be cluing in to the fact that Tony was not himself) and not have to put on any kind of act. Sure, he had to endure Rhodey’s relentless harassment about when exactly he planned to read the team in to these latest developments, but it was worth it.
“Sword?” Tony tilted his head, squinting his eyes. “That doesn’t look like—oh no. Coulson, no.” This time, Phil outright laughed. (Tony realized with a start and a warm feeling of accomplishment that he’d never had the chance to see his Coulson laugh before. He liked the sound very much, and he liked even more the way it sometimes felt like he really belonged in this universe.)
“I’m sure I’ll be taking you up on that, Daryl.”
“It’s not really your fault, you know,” he rasped. There were no notes in SHIELD’s records of Steve also having tried to choke the guy out all those weeks ago, Natasha had made sure of it, but it would be obvious to anyone who knew what they were listening for when they heard the man Taskmaster speak. (
“So Peter, who do you think would win in a fight? Darth Vader or Stitch?” Clint demanded, with the seriousness of someone asking if he would consider being an organ donor.
There was no way he’d be allowed in R&D now, but Pepper and Rhodey were probably the only two people left that Tony would follow anywhere without question. So Tony did as he’d been instructed, sliding clumsily into a pear of nondescript grey sweats and a zip-up hoodie that matched Pepper’s. (He didn’t even bother to put a shirt on under the latter, though, a crime against fashion so severe that his own Pepper likely would have refused to be seen with him if she received advanced warning.)
Tony could hardly formulate an argument to that when his brain was syrup-thick with submission and contentment and
“I have no idea what you mean, Sir. And you have now used one of your three allotted questions.”
Ahhh I'm so glad that even after such a long break, folks are still interested in the next part of this journey! I'm so grateful for your kudos, questions, and comments. <3
“It’s just, usually when people date they do it in the evening, when their hair is washed, and they’re dressed, and…” Tony trailed off as he took in his surroundings. They were in the media room that Tony had used to view footage of Mark II, but alongside one wall were mounted a series of clear dispensers containing what looked to be breakfast cereals. He recognized a couple, like Apple Jacks and Captain Crunch, from his childhood; others, like one that looked to be chocolate-chip cookies in cereal form, promised brand new transports of sugar, preservatives and other delightfully dubious ingredients. The massive screen at the front of the room was playing an old episode of Scooby Doo. “Okay, is this some kind of body-swapping scenario? Clint, if it’s you in there you can tell me.” Phil laughed.
He got there just in time to see, or rather not really see, a blur of motion.And a generic kind of New York dude gone slightly to seed, standing on the sidewalk and yelling. His hair had once been a stylish undercut but looked to have grown out awkwardly in recent weeks, and he wore a suit that bagged at the arms and thighs, suggesting a sudden loss of muscle mass. The guy still wasn’t making a huge amount of noise, but Peter guessed that had far more to do with fear than anything else, because his eyes were wide and he was visibly trembling. Every few seconds, he emitted a fearful kind of groan as the air around him blurred and shifted. A couple seconds afterward, a new wound would appear somewhere on his body. A shoe about thirty feet from where he stood indicated he had probably tried to escape his near-invisible attacker, but now he stood frozen in place, anticipating the next attack with an acceptance that couldn’t be called grim or stoic, but rather borne from an utter lack of comprehension. The crowd that was gathering around the man seemed to mirror his reaction, dozens of people stopped and stared with an eerie and weighty silence. It was far, far worse than the kinds of screaming Peter was used to, and his Spidey-senses were going absolutely haywire. They hadn’t been this intense since the day when he’d landed himself half-dead in hospital, and in the path of Tony Stark.
“Why would I want to be naked if we’re just talking?”
There was only one person on Earth who had ever been capable of making Steve look like that.
No warnings I can think of for this set of responses. I do have a nagging feeling, though, that I'm missing a question someone submitted over the past week. I do keep a running list, but I think one may have gotten lost in the shuffle somehow. If that's your question, please do feel free to resubmit it.
Replies to last chapter might be delayed due to the timing of the AO3 downtime today (it falls exactly when I usually post and comment), but they’re coming, I promise!
It felt wrong, in some ways, the idea that Bucky was proposing. They were treating Tony like a mission or a mark about whom they needed to secretly gather intel. Even if the methods were similar, though, the goal wasn’t the same. None of them were in this to force Tony to share more than he wanted, or to somehow hurt him with this information; just the opposite. If they didn’t want to risk unnecessarily triggering Tony, or force the man to constantly repeat memories that were at times deeply painful, then everyone needed to have access to the same information at the same time.
“In that way it is different,” Steve agreed readily. “But he also wasn’t really ours to begin with. If he decides he wants to be then that should be his choice, not just something he accepts by default. And if he doesn’t then it is way kinder to all of us to let him go. In the meantime, it’s about time we all got off our asses.”
“Talk about
And oh but how he wanted to run then. Even though he didn’t fully understand it, Tony knew (or at least suspected) enough to realize that he’d just dropped a bomb on them, shaken something they considered immovable and permanent. Once he had striven for these kinds of reactions in people, had delighted in witnessing the exact moment where they realized how incomplete and narrow their perspectives were. But now…now, Tony was tired. So fucking tired. And the last thing he wanted was to watch the way both Natasha and Clint immediately turned to Coulson, seeking guidance that, from the way Phil seemed to have frozen in place in his spot near the fireplace, Coulson couldn’t offer. Or the way Thor took several cautious steps toward Bruce, preparing to have to contain the Hulk if it became necessary. (For very different reasons, Tony didn’t hazard glances towards Rhodey or Barnes at all.)
“Yes, Clint. Sorry.”
Too many of you are loyal enough to Stark that I am choosing not to answer questions about my current location. What I will say, as it pertains to seeking Stark out, is that I have reviewed the possibilities and will intervene if and when my presence will aid rather than regress his progress in his new universe.
Clearly they had been in a hurry last night. The thought was enough to pierce through the veil of self-pity covering Peter, leaving behind the sour taste of shame instead. How could he have done this? As if they all didn’t have enough going on without dealing with an enhanced, drunken teenager? How was he ever going to be able to look any of them in the face again?
The dildo was small enough that Tony honestly didn’t think it required lube at all, but one glance was enough to confirm that Steve would not be bending on this point. So Tony coated the peach-coloured glass with a layer of slick.
“A bit. Kinda hard not to be conscious of the things I’ll never be able to offer no matter how hard I try. Especially when it’s not like the comparison is just in my head.”
He was of half a mind to see if Thor wanted to join him for another meal. But even more than that, Steve wanted to capitalize on the Dominin high by spending the morning with his entire team, the way he hadn’t done in weeks. Tony would almost certainly be there, but even that didn’t feel like such a fraught dynamic to manage this morning. Steve could be polite, the same way they were in training or on the rare occasions they ran into each other in the Tower.
While the peacekeeping efforts were officially being led by the UN, it became clear very quickly that the small force from Wakanda was effectively in command. This not only made sense, given that they were tracking a band of rebel troops who had stolen loaned Wakandan technology and were attempting to sell it on the black market, it also meant that Steve mostly got to stand back and listen rather than stepping into a leadership role himself. Again, not his usual preference, but right now taking orders instead of giving them felt like a godsend.
The news that the other Steve had selected Sam rather than Bucky as his successor didn’t shake Steve the way he might have assumed it would’ve. Bucky was a wonderful man, but he had fought long and hard to emerge both from Steve’s shadow and from the equally weighty legacy of the acts he had been forced to commit as the Soldier. Sam, though…Sam embodied so much of what the Captain America mythos valued. He was brave and kind and moral without being inflexible; he’d loved his country enough to keep fighting for it after it had claimed the life of his Dominant,  but when his personal belief in Steve had conflicted with SHIELD’s messaging, he’d made his own choice. He forgave, he offered support to anyone who needed it, and he still seemed to have an endless well of optimism, humour, and faith to draw from.
, powers. One of them had a damn dinosaur! Even in his most fevered fantasies of what it might be like not to be alone with the secret of Spider-Man, Peter could never have dared imagine something like this.
“Shibari is best with natural fibres—they have more grip, and they hold tension better. If it hasn’t been pretreated then you also need to condition that kind of material to make it soft enough, and to prevent it from drying out. You don’t have to do that with the Asgardian stuff, it mostly seems to take care of itself somehow, but it’s good to keep in kind for other kinds of materials.” Tony nodded, alternating between staring at Bucky with rapt attention and toying with the rope he’d been handed. Thor shuddered, gaze fixed on Tony’s absurdly capable hands.
He shivered, wishing he’d taken the suggestion to put on one of the other Tony’s old flight suits that he usually wore under the armour. To be fair, when JARVIS had sounded a localized alert not for the Avengers but specifically for Thor, Tony had reasonably assumed their date was on hold. Instead, the demigod had beamed.
“Oh Stark, you don’t even know crazy.” Steve watched this disfunctional, self-loathing exchange play out, entirely unsure whether to halt it or let it continue in the hopes of the two of them getting somewhere productive. He looked to Natasha, who aside from Steve was probably the most intimately familiar with both personalities. She shrugged and popped a strawberry in her mouth.
“Tony asked me to look out for him shortly after he arrived in our universe, and requested that I keep this information private between he and I. So I will not permit his being punished for anything that comes out of this.”
Tony's first day of his new vacation routine is everything and nothing like he expects.
Not that I envy them. Discussing emotions with Tony Stark? Ugh.
“Now is not the time to be vague. Are you alive or are you dead?”
“So do you—I mean, I guess with Mr. Stark you don’t really need a guy in the chair. He’s gotta be like—
“I hand fed him lunch today.” Steve jolted in his seat like a shock had gone through him. That had been theirs, Tony had
“I do apologize, Sir, but Agent Coulson has used his override codes. I am therefore required to inform you immediately that he requires further corrections to your mission report regarding Taskmaster’s assault on the Tower.” Tony groaned, forgetting that he was holding a beta attempt at Clint’s ill-advised boomerang arrows until he hucked the thing at the wall and was forced to duck as it careened back toward him, arrowhead first. Butterfingers caught it in her claw and wheeled over to hand it back off to Tony with a self-satisfied hum.
“Alright sweetheart. I can see we have a ways to go.” And then Tony knew nothing at all beyond the white-hot streak of pain where the strap connected with his ass for the first time.
it, so it was a matter of waiting until the moment was right.
The next day, Steve ran several miles above his average to work out some of his anxiety through sheer physical exhaustion. Then he showered, ordered the dishes JARVIS said had were Tony’s favourites from the Korean place on 51st, and made his way to the media room where the AI informed him Tony had been all afternoon. It seemed uncharacteristic of Tony to have spent the day watching movies when they had a time sensitive problem on their hands—and why not just stay in the penthouse instead of the theatre-style space they never used unless they had company that included small children?
Steve didn’t know why the answer mattered quite so much to him. He liked Talia, of course, and wanted the best possible life for her. It was more than that, though, something bigger than this one junior agent that had him gripping the edge of his kitchen island with white knuckles as he waited for her answer.
If the team were here, Tony thought, they would also be doing all the things that were wonderful about them like holding his hand during the blood draw (as if that kind of pain even registered anymore) and attempting to assure him that they would be there no matter what the results were. He envisioned it with no small amount of longing: Bruce, quizzing Dr. Chimva on the procedures she was using and stealing Tony’s chart to read for himself; Clint and Thor keeping things light with jokes and stories; Natasha and Phil’s support would be quieter, but they would be the reason a perfectly-sweetened cup of coffee or Tony’s favourite granola bar would suddenly appear as if from thin air. And of course, there would be Steve; Steve would be everywhere, the immensity of his frame matched only by the force and intensity of his affection, which he wore so openly that it was difficult, sometimes, to even look at him.
“Thor can tell you more about what he likes when it’s his turn, but suffice to say bondage is a pretty big part of this whole thing for him. He wears wrist cuffs during the day when he doesn’t have time to go down but needs something to anchor him.” Clint buckled them around Tony’s wrists with the competent ease of someone who knows his tools inside and out. But then, rather than securing them to anything else, he set Tony’s hands back against his thighs.
“Well, Spiderman—”
The elevator doors had just barely closed when Natasha declared,
Tony peered up again and groaned in realization. Agent was going to murder them both.
“Think you that sleep might find you now?”
Talking to a demi-god by text was decidedly odd, but even the jarring dissonance between the form and Thor’s diction didn’t mar his clear enthusiasm. No matter how many times he encountered Thor, Rhodey thought he might never get used to the way that someone who had lived for so long could remain so wholeheartedly enthusiastic about everything he did. (His Momma, he thought, would love Thor the most. After Tony, of course. Tony was everyone’s favourite.)
It turned out, however, that flying Tony and himself to a site only a few miles away from an active and intense forest fire was somehow a part of Thor’s date plans. (To be fair, customs might be different on Asgard, but it still seemed like a weird choice.) The heat, even from this far away, was unbelievable, and Tony was fitted with a breathing mask as a precaution the second they landed. Thor, as a demigod, apparently could be trusted when he assured the team of firefighters that he did not require it.
“Kid, get down to the shop and stay there until I arrive. Remain in the suit with the taser webs active. JARVIS, nobody in or out; defend with extreme force.”
To be fair, Rhodey had tried numerous times to avoid punishing Tony. He’d given him several reminders to get out of bed, had gone through everything they’d already covered about the importance and value of sticking to the schedule. Except where that conversation had initially left Tony feeling warm and safe and cared for, today it had just left him pissed off. He barely acknowledged his body’s other basic needs like sleep and food, and now he had this whole other set of needs that everyone kept insisting had to be met. It was infuriating and embarrassing and Tony just hadn’t wanted to deal with them today. He’d told Rhodey as much, though there had been a lot of swearing mixed in there, along with vows that Tony wouldn’t be putting up with any more of this shit for the duration of his stay. When he’d finally finished ranting at his friend, Rhodey had stood there staring at him for several long beats, then sighed heavily.
The MCU version of Tony, the team agrees, enjoys being touched at least as much, maybe more, than his counterpart, but is far less likely to instigate such exchanges. He also demonstrates greater sensitivity toward most stimuli, including light, sound, and smell.
Tony.”
lose him again.” By the end, Bruce’s calm had evaporated, the grief they all tried to keep hidden from Tony suddenly so raw and exposed that even watching the footage felt like a profound violation.
Tony had promised Natasha no more hiding, and despite his reputation to the contrary he took his promises seriously damn it. So when he woke up the morning after the floofy Bruce incident curled up in the other man’s arms, fuzzy socks still on his feet and mouth still tasting faintly of artificial fruit flavouring and sugar, he didn’t bolt. He’d even agreed to make an appearance at dinner later that week to talk with the team about potentially re-negotiating boundaries and ‘exploring submission in a more experiential way.’ (When he thought too much about that one, Tony always wound up functionally useless for at least an hour while his system struggled between an anxiety and arousal responses, so he had shoved that into a deep vault in his mind.)
“So. You’ve gone a bit nuts then, that’s cool,” Bucky drawled. “At least you look good in yellow.” Steve glared down at the bright elbow-length rubber gloves on his hands, then back up at Bucky. He hucked a second pair of gloves at the other man, raising his eyebrows when Bucky opened his mouth to protest.
“What…
Tony’s nostrils flared. Which was especially hilarious because Peter knew how ridiculous Tony had thought they were even when he was making them. Apparently, though, the rules were entirely different when it came to other people insulting his partner’s weapon of choice.
“Here. Yeah. That’s maybe a good place to start. What made you sure, apparently correctly, that if you ran to Tony Stark after fighting with me that he’d let you have a sleepover?”
“Yeah probably.” There was a quiet shuffling around that Tony didn’t bother paying much attention to as he rooted around in the fridge. (Was the leftover pizza in here three or five days old?) Then a claw nudged him in the side. “Hey, buddy. Just gimme a second.” Another nudge, this time accompanied by a very irritated beep. “Dummy, what—” He spun, midway through composing a mental rant promising to banish the bot to the island of misfit toys. Then he saw the box.
“J, I don’t care what the environmental system scans say, they’ve gotta be buggy or something. It’s freezing down here. Raise temperature another 5 percent.” His AI did as he’d been instructed without commentary, for once, and Tony wasn’t sure if the silence was comforting or if it made him feel even more lonely. Either way, he had to get the hell out of here.
It took Pepper nearly two hours to emerge from the workshop, pulling a protesting Tony into the penthouse by his left ear. He appeared drawn and beyond exhausted. Any weight that he had put on since arriving in this universe had vanished and there were dark bruises under his eyes. The beautiful hint of wavy curls that his hair fell into when it was longer like this were flat and greasy. Dummy rolled behind them, beeping his disapproval and concern and jostling for position with the armour that was still stalking Pepper. When Dummy’s camera found Steve, he zoomed over and began relaying his frustration in even more high-pitched and frequent exclamations. Steve could hardly blame the bot; everything in him ached to feed Tony, get him into a bath, and then put him warm and sated into a bed.
“I’d give quite a lot to know what you’re thinking about right now.”
“No sleeve,” Phil grunted immediately. No surprise there, though Steve suspected the choice would be taken out of Phil’s hands. Whoever had prepped him (Natasha, probably, she loved giving teased, desperate subs to other Doms to play with) had sent Phil to Steve already on a hair-trigger. And Steve wasn’t planning on going easy enough to let Coulson calm himself down any. “One, Sir.”
He could easily have stayed there most of the night, soaking in the quiet comfort of knowing that Peter was there with a belly full of food and a warm bed, but that was only half of what needed doing. With a quiet sigh, he turned and made his way into his own bedroom.
“To be able to answer that I have to tell you both something that very few people know. I’m not who we’ve been telling people I am.”
“Active SHIELD—why would…nevermind, JARVIS, just tell them I’ll be there in five.”
come, to avoid the truth of Clint’s words and all the recognition and insight that were wrapped up in them. Clint’s face gentled for just a second, just long enough for disappointed hope to surge in Tony as he wondered if he’d managed to get himself out of this conversation. Then Clint’s hand wrapped itself around his cock, tighter and more deliberately, and he came to a straddling position atop Tony. (Even in the middle of a scene, he was mindful of the limits of Tony’s body, careful to never rest any weight higher than Tony’s hips.)
“Milking, sir.”
Steve carried the feeling of bone-deep warmth and contentment that had seeped through him during their first dinner into the fundraiser. He was far more comfortable with these kinds of events than it sounded like the other version of Steve would had been, but there was still an intense performativity to them that sometimes reminded him unpleasantly of his days as a propaganda tool.
“It’s Tony,” she reported with a grin. “He slept for six hours, which Thor confirms, and now he’s demanding to know about something in Peter’s file.” The sleep, at least, came as a relief. Steve wished it had been longer, but he knew damn well they were lucky to get that much out of a Tony in crisis-mode. The latter piece of news didn’t seem worth smiling over, however, and he arched a questioning brow in Natasha’s direction. “This is good, Steve. He’s had access to all my intel on Peter since he first asked me to keep an eye on him, and he never once accessed it. He might not be ready to actually see him, but he can’t seem to go back to pretending he doesn’t exist either. It’s a step.”
(I would say more, and perhaps offer a vision, but I would suggest that the chapter immediately coming up will likely highlight these exact areas. Non-sexual submission has a very particular way of illustrating to Stark how much his life has fundamentally changed, and how much the team’s knowledge of him extends beyond just what occurs in the bedroom.)
But when he heard Tony Stark’s voice with perfect clarity over the compound’s sound system, Steve was forced to consider that perhaps something inside of him had snapped. Maybe, faced with yet another unthinkable loss, he had simply retreated somewhere else, somewhere inside himself where he finally got to not just love people, but
“I don’t…I mean, he’s him but he’s not, and I don’t want to screw this up.”
Bucky had emerged from HYDRA as someone who not only liked, but sometimes needed brutal forms of domination, particularly intense impact play. The first time Bucky had limped his way out of Natasha’s bedroom after moving into the tower, covered from head to toe in bruises and marks and bites, Steve had lost it at her; Bucky, in turn, had screamed at Steve, reminding him that people’s needs and desires changed, and that if Steve was gonna be an asshole about it then ‘he didn’t have to fuckin’ be there.’ Terrified of losing Bucky, and the fledgling bonds the team had just been starting to build by that point, Steve had sworn to keep his mouth shut. (It wasn’t like he was against whatever forms of submission worked for all parties, anyway; it had just been hard to see Bucky
“Well, you know that instinct you have right now, to hide yourself away from the whole world because you’re toxic and dangerous as hell to be around, and the least you can do is minimize the collateral damage? You tell that voice to shut the ever-loving fuck up.” This startled a laugh out of Peter, who met Tony’s eyes for the first time since Tony had entered the room. “After that, you go to the person you don’t want to see right now. The one you’re hiding from because it’s impossible not to be honest around them, and you’re terrified to be honest with anyone right now because, well, it’s a nightmare? You go to them, and tell them everything or nothing and you stay there until you start to remember how to treat yourself like a human being again.” Tony paused, unsure about leaving it there. Then he decided that fuck it, if he was demanding that his kid be brave, the least Tony could do was make the same demand of himself. “And if by some chance you don’t know who that is right now then you stay here at the Tower with me, and we watch terrible movies in the media room and eat food that would make Steve give us disapproving stare number seven.”
So SI and SHIELD's intertwined corporate drama is about as far from the smut as last time as it gets, but I hope it was fun to dig back into some of the plotty stuff, too.
Then Natasha took over. Rhodey been hesitant at first, when most of the team had wanted to involve themselves in punishing Tony. Poly relationships were great and all, but when it came to punishments ‘too many cooks’ was still a genuine risk. It would be incredibly easy for the scene to become monotonous, or for Tony to become overwhelmed by the guilt and pain before he could reach true release. Rhodey needn’t have worried. On the battlefield the Avengers were famous for their unity and cohesion; they were studied by every combat force Rhodey had ever heard of. But that was
“Look, I know you and I aren’t good at talkin’ about this kinda shit, but I need you to know I wasn’t trying to pressure or rush you the other night. Or maybe I was, but I shouldn’ta been. I just…got scared, I guess. Felt like you were like, doing the usual self-sacrificing bullshit and giving us permission to leave you for him or something.”
“Including myself,” JARVIS added. As one, everyone else in the room froze and looked up at the nearest camera. “He has not spoken extensively of the details, but during his recent time in the workshop he grew tired enough that he seemed temporarily unaware I was not his original creation. He apologized for not saving the other me from Ultron.”
“It’s attention-seeking. Submissive 101, really,” Natasha finished thoughtfully. “I should have seen it sooner…the punishment I gave him during our scene, it was very obviously helpful. He responded just like every other sub I’ve ever had who finds release that way: sincere apologies, catharsis through crying, followed by intense contentment. But the second he was up out of headspace even a little he was insisting he would never need that kind of attention from a Dominant again. He’s fairly comfortable admitting he likes and maybe even needs the sexual submission, but he’s not ready to consciously admit that it’s not enough.”
starving. No one knew why, exactly, it happened; some felt it was mainly an effect of adrenaline, which convinced the body that dealing with whatever was inhibiting its access to food was more important than actually eating, while others argued it was the fault of gluconeogenesis, the process by which the body deals with falling blood sugars by metabolizing fat (thereby temporarily elevating blood glucose levels while the body slowly consumes itself.) Whichever it was, there had come a point during his aimless drift through space with Nebula where Tony stopped fantasizing about cheeseburgers and fruit salads and shrimp cocktails the way he had when the food had first run out. The thought of food had felt repugnant, and even though he’d known intellectually that this was a bad sign, it had come as such a relief to just not feel hungry for a while that he hadn’t felt anything but a grim kind of gratitude.
“I’m gonna go deal with him. But it’s real good to see your face, sugar.”
“I mean, you do need a janky suit to fly, Tony,” America grinned.
to know him, and when he might
It was no small part of Steve that wanted to keep putting this off, to just keep watching Tony sunbathing naked and content next to Bruce and deal with everything else another time. They did, after all, have weeks.
“Well, I filtered out some of the other stuff—things about whether or not I can suck you again, because that just seems needy, and a question about whether or not people in this universe get married, and this weird request that I can’t even believe crossed my mind about you maybe picking out my clothes for today, because I swore up and down to Rhodey that that did nothing for me but it turns out kind of did. And thinking about clothes got me thinking about the plan for the day and then I remembered Sam was coming.”
the overly permissive parent?” Clint protested. He sounded substantially less pissed off than he had an hour or so ago, for which Tony found himself deeply grateful. Having a Dominant be pissed at you when you were still in any degree of subspace felt, it turned out, fucking horrible.
With every step that brought them closer to the heart of the house, the more the memories forced their way to the surface. Those first, disastrous tests of the armour, leaving him covered in bruises and fire extinguisher foam; the shattered glass crunching under his feet after he’d blown out the walls with the repulsors; Pepper, aptly predicting that being Iron Man would eventually kill Tony; Tony, begging her to understand just how broken he was in the wake of New York…
“I…isn’t one way we’re trying to keep the romantic stuff and the submission stuff separate supposed to be that you don’t date the same person you scene with in a week?”
“Access denied.”
“What…” Steve started, then stopped mid-sentence. Because really, there was no point in asking what was going on. The ‘what’ wasn’t the issue here, it was the ‘how’ that mattered, but Tony wasn’t the only one struggling with his words just now.
“Three, ma’am.” She’d kept the request number of spheres, slid the others back into the box, and then placed the remaining ones into Coulson’s cupped palms with a reverant, ritualistic air. Clint watched avidly, and occasionally reached out to toy with the collar around Coulson’s neck, but otherwise remained silent.
The point is, Tony came to consciousness aware that he wasn’t quite where he should be. Cautious extensions of his legs and arms brought about aches and pops more severe than the usual symptoms of his aging and battle-weary body, and a spark of pain down his neck revealed that he wasn’t lying flat, or with his head on a pillow. It was propped against something, probably the arm of a piece of furniture.
The team battles Taskmaster, and Tony learns that skipping the subsequent medical check and debrief is not an option.
Steve didn’t trust himself to be in the room any longer, not without either embracing this man or screaming at him for being so fucking close to what Steve had wished for all these years but
“You have this. You can do this. Whatever’s going on, whatever this is, he needs you to be calm and steady for him just like you always are. His controlled variable, didn’t he used to say?” Bruce smiled weakly, even as his heart thudded a rapid beat in his chest.
“Nothing for SHIELD, or the Avengers, or SI,” Steve had explained, handing him a tablet. “Just something fun. We can send Dummy down to the shop for any supplies that you need.”
“Steve’s mission. There’s something we’re not seeing yet.” Each time, Natasha’s reply was the same.
It had taken what was probably an inappropriate length of time for Tony to remember that before fighting Thanos had taken over his entire life, he’d actually had other jobs. Several of them (like consulting for SHIELD) weren’t viable options now, but surely there was some way he could help SI out on the sly? Make up for years of putting Pepper off and refusing to sign the things he was supposed to?
Masdee was still making the appearance of being somewhat distracted by the food. After extracting a promise from Steve that he wouldn’t rat her out to Shuri, she even ordered a replacement dessert from the kitchens. But something about Masdee’s tone had been far too…knowing. Reflexively, Steve eyed the door.

[Mario Kart 8, Nintendo Switch]
“Steve, you need to see him.” Steve didn’t bother responding at all to that heart-stoppingly cruel demand, but this didn’t stop Bucky from reaching down and pulling Steve to his feet. As soon as he was level Steve took a swing at the other man, and not the careful, restrained blows he hit the team with during training. He put nearly all of his strength behind it—but he hadn’t counted on the impact of this much pain combined with its physical symptoms (especially dehydration.) He swung wide, overbalancing to try to keep himself steady, and Bucky made easy work of catching Steve’s arm, pressing it against his back and shoving him against a wall. “We done with this now or you wanna go another coupla rounds, Stevie?”
The fatalism of that sounded entirely too familiar, and Steve growled, protective Dominance rising to the surface with such sudden force it took even him by surprise. He wanted to scoop Tony up and barricade them away from the world, shield Tony even from himself. (If he was feeling this low Steve would find him help, he would get the best professionals in the world in the Tower by tomorrow…)
(See the end of the chapter for
know that high level Dominants often ended up in caregiving work, but he betrayed no signs of surprise. He did, however, let his body lean ever so slightly backward against Steve’s as he and mogul-guy (Steve wanted to call him Chad, but he wanted to mentally call a lot of the men here Chad) kept chatting.
“Afraid he’s right, sweetheart. You were non-verbal for pretty much the entire day of the scene, and some of the next morning. You came up part way through breakfast mainly because you felt a very desperate urge to tell Thor his hair was pretty. ”
“Congratulations are in order I see.”
“Aww, no need to be shy, Cap,” he teased, shifting his angle on Steve’s lap so that his hip jutted and his back arched. “I don’t bite unless specifically asked, I promise.”
These people would never, ever make sense.
For once, it was a boon that there was a permanent gaggle of reporters camped outside SI’s headquarters. He made small talk with them for a couple of moments, answering mostly inane questions about Steve and how he and Tony were ‘settling in.’
, Stevie. This is the same thing I’ve been telling you for weeks now. The two of you are like fucking magnets, can’t stay away from each other even when you’re running your mouth about distance and being ‘just friends.’ Look at right now! You’re telling us you want to stay out of that part of our lives with him, yet you’re constantly giving us input about how to be better Doms for Tony. You couldn’t mind your own business about it if you tried.”
While the Author is, in many cases, wildly fanciful, on this particular topic she is correct. Submissives, particularly True submissives, are generally very highly regarded. Howard Stark, however…well, perhaps showing you would be more expedient.
“Would it really
“Ooh, I didn’t realize that meant I couldn’t have a will or an agenda separate from his. Good to know.” Peter snorted an unwilling laugh.
The concern, however, was that if the hormone didn’t leave his system, or even continued to rise for a short time after his departure, then the effects on Stark would have been unpredictable and potentially quite severe. It is possible, for instance, that being Dominated by someone in his own universe who lacks the biochemical and physiological aspects of the identity would not be enough to lower his cortisol levels, and Dr. Banner explained the significant risks involved with that kind of elevation over the long term.
“Yessir,” Tony said, but before the honorific was even fully out of his mouth, Tony’s jaw was tightening. He looked quickly away from all of them, staring at the gentle rolling waves of the sea instead. “Sorry. I’m—sorry.”
After the bath, he slathered Tony in expensive moisturizer and some kind of oil. He was fairly sure he’d heard Clint mention using something similar on Bucky when he’d seen the two of them after a particularly intense scene, but given that there wasn’t a mark on Tony, Steve was undoubtedly being overcautious. (Tony’s pointing this out was greeted with a calm agreement on Steve’s part, even as he squeezed another helping of oil into his palms.) There were also a lot of…well they weren’t quite orders, but directions on Steve’s part. They were incredibly simple things, stuff that it would have been irritating to be directed to do if he were at baseline.
“Uh, so, thanks for everything man.”
Then Thor took up the strap. He delivered a single blow, and even though Tony was familiar enough with Thor’s other-worldly strength to know he probably wasn’t using even a third of it, the force was still enough to punch out a scream that felt like it came right from Tony’s soul.
It's so exciting to really be digging into things now. Thank you so much for your comments and encouragement thus far, I love hearing from you! And you can, as always, feel free to #AskStrange if you have specific questions you want him to cover.
“What the f—Dummy? What are you doing out of the shop? Did—you brought a fire extinguisher. Fucking hell you beautiful, ridiculous hunk of circuits.” The bot spun in rapid circles, emitting a series of beeps that could only be described as robotic squeals. Then he dropped the fire extinguisher with a loud clang and used his claw to yank the blankets unceremoniously from Tony’s body, leaving him in nothing but a pair of green silk boxers that weren’t his own.
And Tony did, almost before Steve had even finished giving the instruction. He very nearly made a crack about this being the first order he’d given all day that Tony had actually listened to, but something (he’d later hope it was intuition, that some part of him had reached out to recognize Tony even that early on) made the words die on his tongue.
I continue to live for your comments, kudos, and questions. You're all wonderful, and I absolutely adore hearing your thoughts on where the story is heading! There will also be Dr. Strange responses posted tomorrow, so let me know if you have questions you want me to pass on to the Doc!
“Shit. I’m sorry. I’ve done this, I mean with like, dates and chocolate strawberries and stuff, but on most of those occasions I was pretty drunk, and I don’t—”
“Yeah, Bruce mentioned you had a few misguided ideas about how sexism and orientational discrimination might intersect,” Natasha said. Her voice was oddly gentle, not a hint of anger even though what Tony was implying was probably considered deeply offensive. “It’s not all hearts and flowers over here, but you have to realize that about 70 percent of the population requires some degree of submission in their lives to function properly. It’s not considered a weakness. Arrangements like ours, where a Dom or dominant-inclined Switch works directly under their sub or sub-inclined Switch during the day might be more rare, but still no one would ever question Phil’s ability to do his job simply because he needs to be at our feet sometimes.”
“Clint was too far down himself last night to be Domming you. If he suggested otherwise then that’s something we all need to discus. Immediately.”
The quote she reads aloud is from a real book (and it's wonderful!)
“I can tell this is really difficult for you, Tony, and I’m very proud that you made it through today without snarking or shutting down. You also really let your body relax and open up during the exam, don’t think I didn’t notice. Since you did so well, I wanted to give you some options about how we proceed.” Tony lost the battle against grinning like a total fool. Praise hit him hard enough on its own; now Bruce was combining that with the team’s tendency to give Tony choices, laying out a clear array of options and explaining them so that he got to participate in decision-making without doing all the work of analysis. Tony had done that kind of thing for other people before, mostly to help them keep up with the particularities of how his brain worked in what Pepper had always called ‘genius mode,’ but no one had ever done such a thing for him until he’d stumbled his way into this universe.”We can continue conducting check-ins with JARVIS’s help for the next week. Presuming you can avoid lying to me or holding back anything major in that time, I’ll be satisfied enough to trust you again. Alternatively, there’s some assessments I’ve been wanting to run to get a better sense of how the rise in subtonin is affecting you both physically and mentally. I know that’s a sensitive topic for you, and if you need or want to wait on that for a while more than we can. But if you’re up to completing some of them over the next few days, I’d be willing to cut the punishment down to three days.”
“Maybe I’ll just come with you?”
“I don’t think that’s a great idea just yet.”
“Just some insurance to help you stay good, sweetheart,” he soothed as Tony shifted uneasily, unsure what he’d done wrong. “I want you to be allowed to come, and I’m not certain you have enough self-control just now to avoid touching yourself.”
The prospect of his first dinner with Stark and the rest of the Avengers, to be held that evening after May’s shift ended, was daunting enough. To make matters worse, the whole thing wreaked of some kind of after-school-special domesticity. While Peter wasn’t so jaded as to be able to pretend that hanging with some of the most famous superheroes in the world wasn’t appealing on some level, building anything beyond a professional relationship with the lot of them was ultimately a child’s dream. Besides, if Peter had learned one thing in the past few years, it was that his childhood had effectively ended at the same moment he’d accepted the full reality of his transformation. (Great power, great responsibility…sometimes he really hated how well-spoken Uncle Ben had been. Couldn’t the guy have left a bit of wiggle room in there? Like with great power comes great responsibility…except during SAT season?)
He regretted it pretty much the second the words spilled from his mouth, but May was devious, and she knew him better than just about anyone. She rushed them out the door without even putting on the fancy dress she had laid out on the couch. By the time Peter could have mustered a real panic attack, they were already stepping out of the elevator and into the penthouse.
“Clint, this is ridiculous.” One of the callouses on Clint’s absurdly clever hands scraped over him in exactly the right way and Tony’s muscles felt like they seized as one with the effort of trying not to come. “Nonononono, please, please—”
“You can tell me anything you need to without that, Tony. You’re just confused, I think; maybe I pushed things farther than I should have last night, hmm? How about I go get us some food and water, maybe your heavy blanket, and—” He shook his head violently, wincing as his neck cracked in protest.
“Not sure what you mean, Cap. This is who I am. Shouldn’t have signed on the dotted line if you weren’t up for the whole package, you know?” There was a hint of a snarl in Tony’s voice, and a curl in his lip, and he hated himself so fucking much, why would he do this now, right when he was about get everything he had wanted since…god, fucking forever?
