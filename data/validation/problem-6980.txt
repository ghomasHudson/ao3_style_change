Bruce and Tony had become close over the last decade. Bruce had been a scientist in his former life and since Tony still had a tendency to tinker and invent things for a company he no longer officially owned or worked for, they naturally hit it off.
“Something like that, son.” Howard stabbed his filet. “I don’t expect your mother to understand. What, Maria, didn’t you just go to finishing school?” The barb struck home, and Tony watched as his mother wilted.
Tony growls under his breath. With a curse he leaves Steve in the hospital room and finds his way up to his penthouse. He should stay at Steve’s side, but he doesn’t know if that’s the correct protocol. They haven’t even been going out for a month. Should he stand vigil? He wanders through his penthouse, ignoring the lights and goes directly to his bedroom.
“So, considering the prince’s current state and my profession that includes de-stressing people, do you think I would be under the definition of a temporary assistant to the prince?” Steve waits. He hopes he didn’t happen to befuddle the AI too much.
Orchestra music swells in the room as Tony stretches his arms widely as if to embrace the stars themselves. “Dancing is the air we breathe, the stars we long for, the essence of life, Steve. How can you not dance?”
Steve gathers up his shirt, hat, and gun, slips on his boots. He thinks he’ll go out back and have a wash, get the stink of the night terrors off of him. “Where to?”
“I suggest, Stane, that you consider how you refer to your intended to others. While you may say you respect Sir Stark, your actions do not show it.” He moves to leave, but Tiberius stops him.
Not safe. Nothing about life is safe. Nothing can be safe. It knows this small fact. Survival was not assured. Survival should not be the plan.
Steve stops and nods. He’s never done anything like this for Tony. They never played these types of games, though Tony taught him all of the positions
Bucky lets out a pent up breath. He paces around in a small circle in the wide open area of Steve’s office. It’s empty – the office – too empty for Steve’s liking, and it’s far too big. He only wanted a desk and a console to work on, he even offered to do his work on the Howling Commando, his ship, but the nascent government and governors disagreed. The hero of the rebellion should have the best.
Steve nods knowing that with their current connection Scott won’t be able to see him. That’s fine with him, the glossy tears that run down his face are no one’s business but his own. “Thanks, Scott.”
Steve screws up his face and he props himself up on his elbows. “That doesn’t seem right. He’s getting your protection but he’s not sharing the responsibility.”
Tony furrowed his brows, his interest in getting a communication to the outside world temporarily forgotten. “What? That has to be wrong.” He leaned down as Pepper showed him the files. Folders on physiological studies, anatomical studies, behavioral studies, psychological studies, stress studies, extreme environment studies, pain studies, isolation studies filled the screen. There were even more files that she hadn’t opened.
“Fuck this is giving me a headache. I’m going to get something to eat,” Logan says and walks toward the kitchen. Tony should worry about how he knows where to go and how he just makes himself comfortable, but Richards pulls him back into the conversation.
Steve got into the elevator and asked for the med-bay floor. He leaned against the back of the car as the lift closed. His shoulders slumped and he let out a long exhale. “Well, that didn’t go well,” he murmured and clutched his arms around his chest. He hadn’t done that in years, decades really. When he was younger and smaller, after he confronted another bully in an alleyway, he always end up with blood stains on his shirt. In order to hide them he would fold his arms around his chest so his mother wouldn’t see. She knew. She always knew regardless of how much he tried to hide his failings. Only thing was Tony wasn’t a bully in an alleyway. He was Steve’s Beloved and he was hurting – a lot. Steve felt the reverberations of Tony’s reaction to the news. How it both horrified and sickened Tony in one breath. The shock upset the bond until it quaked and threatened the pack.
A stupid sentence. What the hell? He cursed but he repeated the words. “The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.” He swallowed down the need to vomit as if the words poisoned him. The terror clenched his belly but then it just ricocheted with pain from Steve. Steve was in so much pain Tony’s eyes burned with it.
“What some alien coming down to beat on India now?” Tony wasn’t stupid. He’d hacked into enough of SHIELD to know what went down in New Mexico.
He thought about Pepper, about her beauty and brilliance. Mostly, he grappled with how unfairly he treated her over the intervening months since the holiday, since the last of his armor exploded. He wrapped himself in a façade, brittle but glimmering, as shiny as any of his suit of armor. He pretended with the best of them; he knew how to walk through life putting up the showman while slowly creeping into a dark, dank place like a worm into a rotting stump. He shivered, because something in his core shriveled and dried.
The first almost positive reaction – a blush colors the man’s cheeks. He looks down at the food in front of him rather than at Tony. “You don’t want me. You shouldn’t. I was bonded with another alpha. It didn’t turn out well, as you know.”
The dog failed at that, and Tony doesn’t like to think about what happened to old Rusty. Now, as he stares at the ghost lion, he thinks of Rusty. How he would lie with his head between his paws and stare up at Tony with this mournful look in his eyes. There had been a silent conversation between the two of them. Both of them knew their bonding would never last, but both of them hoped they would be able to fight the forces that would tear them apart. Tony wasn’t strong enough then.
“No, I – no but,” Steve stutters and blanks out for a moment. It’s an odd look, as if he’s completely zoned out before he snaps back into place. “My mom she named me after him.”
“Are those black cherries?” Steve says and swallows as his mouth waters. He puts his hand to his mouth, embarrassed.
“I never wanted you to be hurting. I wrote you a letter,” Steve replies. “And whether or not you think that letter was worthy, or you thought it was shit, it came from the heart.”
Tony swallowed and nodded. Steve waited a moment and then bent down. This time he licked his lips right before he touched Tony, the smoothness, the tenderness shook Tony to the core. But what moved him to near tears was the passion beneath it.  The yearning for a connection clear through the kiss. Steve pursued and Tony followed his lead, knowing that the connection though built by an inscrutable energy between them still remained frail and nascent. When Steve came away from the kiss, the room seemed brighter to Tony. So bright and warm. Steve smiled and ran a hand in a caress down Tony’s cheek.
Tony inhales deeply and then exhales with a measured pace. “It’s all okay, Steve. We’re okay. You’re just – it was rough for you. I wanted to tell you, but it wasn’t a good time. We had a hard time getting you out. A very hard time. We almost lost you.”
Something stiffens in Steven, but he relaxes after a second. “Natalia wasn’t supportive of it. She thinks that it will cause more trouble. Trying to keep that many omegas under control would be difficult.”
“Seems to me we just take the stone and book it, run for it. There’s no reason to exchange Steve now,” Tony says. He licks his lips as if hungry for the resolution, the stone is so close.
Part of him might be horrified by his own actions, by his own words. But as an alpha - especially a prime alpha – to deny his nature would be to deny self. The omega only hints at understanding with a fine tremor of his shoulders. Tony lets him go and the man goes to his toes, a hard maneuver considering the spreader bar. He holds back the orgasm though and Tony’s pleased with it. One boundary forged.
Tony snapped his attention to Strange. “I came to you because you were supposed to be the expert here. You were supposed to help us figure this shit out.”
“Thank you.” He brings it toward his chest, cradling the toy against him like a babe. “And I do know it, Tony. That wasn’t the first time I died as a lion.”
“No,” Steven says again and yanks the bottle right out of his hand. “You don’t need a devil to get you through this. You need me.”
Bruce, Logan, and Tony form a semi-circle around the couch, standing over Steve as he picks up the pen. He scrunches up his nose and says, “It’s kind of hard to do this with an audience.”
“Tony, Mister Stark was my father,” Tony says and catches the towel hanging on the hook near the door. He tosses it to Steve, who catches it easily. “I know where you were during those seven months the great Captain of the Union Army disappeared.”
It’s over an hour later when Tony’s randomly reading one of the books that Wong brought – it’s a boring period book – when Friday announces, “Incoming text from Steve.”
“That’s all dancing has to be sometimes.” Tony must suddenly come to himself, because he drops Steve’s hands and steps away. “Hopefully, we’re not going to dance off the cliff.”
Wanda puts her finger to her lips. “Thor. He went a little ballistic the other day. You know one of the reasons he’s here other than his brother’s insistence is Jane. He’s followed her halfway across the galaxy.”
Tony inches forward, he doesn’t want to see it, but it’s like a car wreck. He has to look, there’s no stopping him from gaping at the collision.  Everything does collide in his brain – the images sketched out in front of him slot into place like pieces in a circuit board. It’s so easy to see, he knows it all. “Shit. Fuck. God damn.” He picks up one of the papers and sees the drawing of Steve perched over him in a tent. “We were on our way to meet them. The Ornari,” Tony mumbles. “We stopped to rest. We-.” Tony swallows down the rest because he can feel the lasting impression of making love to Steve. Tears prickle in the corners of his eyes. “This doesn’t make sense. None of this happened.”
A shadow moves close to his little circle of light. Tony startles but then Blu re-appears. He pads over to Tony and drops a mouthful of branches next to him.
Taking it as a cue, Tony jumps to his feet and flicks his hands a few times. “I’m sorry I don’t know how to sign. I just- I wanted to know.” He looks back at Steve and says, “I wanted to know if you had any first aid supplies.”
Steve hurries away from the workshop, squeezing his eyes closed and fighting the impending hell that wants to take over his consciousness. He’s not going to let it happen this time. The demon waiting in the wings is not going to crawl over his brain matter and seize it. He gets to the elevator and mutters to JARVIS to take him to his floor. He should just head down to the lobby, but he needs to clear his head – force the demon away – if only for a little while. He wants one day free of it, one day he can look at Tony and not see afterimages of a life before.
“But it wasn’t SHIELD. It was Hydra,” Steve said and sighed. The tension in his shoulders and back increased and Tony reached over and touched his arm. Hill noted his action with a raised brow but kept up the impromptu briefing.
Blowing up his mansion in Malibu hadn’t been on the list of priorities during the holidays (even if he didn’t technically launch the rockets at his residence, he’d been stupid enough to antagonize a terrorist). When it came to his suits? All of his armors created lovingly but in a fit of post-traumatic stress, those he blew up voluntarily because it was supposed to symbolize his love for Pepper and the next step on his recovery. It worked – to a degree. For a few blissful months he found a certain peace with leaving Iron Man behind him, leaving the mission of the world’s protection behind him. It helped to dissuade him from pressing too deep, from worrying about what might lie within. It helped to think about himself, but then images of his past haunted him – the past where he profited from war and death.  He tried to live a different life now, removing the armor and the glamour and become a more sedate mature version of himself. The media hounded him when he moved back to New York, looking for home. SHIELD called on him. More than once he had JARVIS turn their agents away. Tony wasn’t bound to them in any way even when Natasha appeared at his Tower in New York. His big ugly Tower with its empty Avenger floors that he needed to renovate again and make all of those memories and hopes disappear into the distant past.
He tries to swallow but there’s too much, so he takes an inelegant swig of the wine, coughs, and says, “Because I made a promise.”
“Steve, come on, you know I can feel you. Even with the Mantra you’ve been saying twenty four seven it’s leaking through. What happened at that dinner you had with Tony?” Natasha watched him, eyeing him with not the softest look, but still kindness.
Those words sunk Tony’s heart. Natasha always seemed so distant and cold, like steel and ice. Yet, her words, the way to offered to shield him from the responsibility thawed her in his eyes.
Natasha clasps her arms around herself as a cold shivers through her. They’re on their own now. In there. With a homicidal robot.
“I understand,” Samantha says. “Now I’m going to give you my tablet and you can go through all of the options and select your limit.” She stands and Steve goes to follow her, but she gestures for him to stay seated. “I am going to go and pull a few files for you. You will then be able to select-.”
While he doesn’t know a ton about medicine or seizures, he’s pretty sure that valium is old school and a crappy option for treatment. Tony only eats any words he wants to say, because what can he say? “Is he going to be okay?”
“Does that mean I’ll drink Steve dry?” Because if that was the case, Tony needed to leave – right now. He wouldn’t put Steve in any further danger.
“Seriously, you weren’t worried that it would mutate you or kill you?” Tony scrapes the bottom of the bowl with his spoon, not realizing that he consumed the stew in record time. “This was really good.”
“Don’t say it, Steve. I don’t want to hear it,” Tony says and his hand tenses against Steve’s cheek.
Steve trails behind him, scanning the horizon for anything untoward, but what would that be in a virtual reality existence? Ultron is brilliant Steve must remember that, he knows what Tony knows and probably more because of his vast control of the internet. The AI would hide as much of his wicked plans as possible, in the best places possible – like a family having a picnic out in the fields.
Before Steve can protest, Tony has him in the jacuzzi bath with bubbles frothing above the rim of the tub. Luckily for him, Steve wasn’t abashed about disrobing in front of Tony. He simply took off his clothes and hopped in when Tony told him the water was ready. He doesn’t know if the lack of modesty is due to his years as a member of the military and essentially bunking out with a bunch of guys for weeks on end or if it’s a result of living the life of a wild animal where clothes are a foreign concept.
“Give me a break. I am not suicidal,” Steve retorts and the numbness he felt before all but fades away. He’s vibrating with energy, with raw emotion that he’s bottled up for months since the last time he saw Tony, really saw him.
It’s cruel to even think, brutal. So he swallows down the darkness creeping inside and shudders at his fragility.
Laura returned with a first aid kit and then rounded up the children who had been hanging on the bannister of the staircase trying to eavesdrop on their conversation. She shared a look with Clint and then brought their children upstairs much to their whispered protests. Steve waited until they left and then gathered up the supplies. He came and sat next to Tony and gestured for him to lift up his tattered shirt.
Thankfully, Tony spends most of his time working the crowd. He talks with Pierce as well as Odin with Stane closely by his side. They converse with the Syns and even Hammer. There’s a lot of small groups meeting and whispering with one another – Steve’s not sure why they decided to have this event at the Gravity bowl. Seems like a waste of time and energy to him, but it might be to show teamwork or something. As Steve tries to work out the different factions and how they group together, the shame dissipates and only a lingering despair remains.
He studied the cage below and then he saw it, what had stricken Pepper mute. Fuck. It was like The Man in the Iron Mask by Alexander Dumas. A metal alloy covered the man’s upper face and shaved head– obscuring his eyes from sight. His mouth and the bottom of his nose was free from the mask but not from restraint. His mouth had something protruding from it that seemed bolted -
Stopping for gas a second time, Tony noted it was near dawn. They’d get to the safe house just on time. He pumped the gas and went to the store to pay since the pumps were old fashion and required payment inside of the store. The cashier eyed him and kept furtively looking under his counter. He must have a wooden stake. Just ridiculous. Like a wooden stake through the heart wouldn’t mistakenly kill a human as well. Just to be a dick, he loaded the counter with all kinds of candy from Snickers bars to jelly beans. The cashier screwed up his pimply face and made the sale. For shits and giggles after the kid finished stashing all of the candy in a bag, Tony grabbed it, tossed the cash on the counter, and then snarled at him showing his fangs. The kid nearly fainted. Tony laughed all the way to the SUV. He tossed the candy to the passenger seat and said to Bruce, “You okay back there?”
Rumlow shrieked out something unintelligible, sounding like the injured animal he was. He drew himself up, keeping his hand held closely to his chest. Licking his lips, he glowered at Steve and then advanced. “You’re gonna pay for that.” He pulled out his shocker stick, put it on full charge, and slammed it against Steve’s temple.
Steve grabs for the rag and gently pushes Tony away. “Go, do what you need to do. I don’t need a nursemaid.”
Instead of confronting him, Sam sidestepped the issue. “You sure we don’t need the big guy?” Sam asked as he went through the wings to ensure no damage had been done to them by the Hydra Strike Team. Hill had known where to retrieve them from the bed of the armored truck transport. The wings and Steve’s shield.  “Might be nice to have the big guy for intimidation purposes.”
“Yes, sir,” Steve says. He can’t believe he’s allowing a butler to intimidate him.  He was a Captain in the Army; he went to war. He’s smelled the tang of blood in the air, the acrid odor of fear, and the horrid stench of bodies blown apart. Still, this thin rail of a man manages to intimidate Steve. It’s probably his devotion to Stark – that must be it.
“I need, I need,” he says and then just sinks to the floor, curling over his knees and wrapping his arms around himself.
. He forces it down like a spoiled piece of meat and says, “Sure.” He swings his arms. “I’d like that.”
He slid a hand under Steve’s jaw and kissed him lightly on the lips. “Home?” The dizzying spell of looking into Steve’s eyes, those blue eyes that played with a touch of green, spun through Tony – tightening his gut and flushing his cheeks.
“You have to tell me,” Tony had said, floating a little on the pleasure. “You’re a sub, but you never told me what you like. I’ve used the rack, but not-.” He stopped as Steven slipped his tongue back towards his entrance. Groaning he shuddered, but held back any other type of reaction. He wouldn’t allow an omega to penetrate him. It just wasn’t done. Coming back to himself, he asked, “What, what is it that you like?”
“I don’t know when it happened. Before you found out about your parents but after you got back together with Pepper. I knew I loved you then. I had no recourse. Then everything happened and I lived on the run.” He touches his forehead to Tony’s. “I ran away from everything I wanted, because I knew I never deserved it.”
That strikes Steve like a slap to the face. “I’m not sure that’s any of your business.” Tony’s rod straight as he glares at Ross. “I’m not answering,” Steve says.
Steve kissed Tony’s hair. “I don’t know. It was a defense, maybe? Give you a nightmare and try and get away?”
“Why do you do it?” They are standing at the grand double doors to the Stark Family mansion. The butler and footmen hover, but Tony ignores them. “Why?”
He struggles to keep standing. Steve nearly died today. When the building fell and the rumble came down, Tony thought for sure he’d seen the love of his life extinguished. When they had been able to clean away the tonnage piled on top of him, Tony celebrated to find his husband, his alpha still in one piece. The celebration had been short lived because of his condition. Rebars through the lower gut and legs. The shield protected his head and his chest, but he must have slipped because of mortar striking him since he was found not in his curled up position behind the shield.  The blood pooled beneath him, forming a sort of strange image of a damaged angel. Even as the EMT’s gathered around Steve and Tony stood paralyzed to the side, he couldn’t get the idea out of his head. A damaged angel. His damaged and dying angel.
It seemed like an age until they were fully disrobed. They took their time, Tony slowly removed each article of clothing from Steve, then Steve doing the same for Tony. They paused at each moment, kissing and exploring. Anytime Steve shuddered with hesitation and fear, Tony strung their souls together and it relaxed them both – Steve brought Tony down to the bed. It wasn’t too uncomfortable but having Tony laying on top of him helped. To feel body to body, the heat, increased Steve’s need.
“Shit,” Steve says and quickly removes it. He gets his robes back on and brings the uniform back to Pepper. “Here you go.”
With that pronouncement the entire room floods with a projection of a starry field. Steve feels like he’s dropped into an ancient’s classical painting. It’s a little vertigo inducing, and he needs to shut his eyes in order to steady his balance. “Okay can we tone it down a little?”
It was then everything changed for all of them. Bruce took one look at Steve –in the astral dimension or the real one Steve did not know – and a green flash hinted across his eyes and face. He smirked and then turned back to the rebellious soul. An image of Bruce and the Hulk superimposed against one another and then the Hulk howled out his anger and the energies trembled, the chords shifting together in a tight knot with the pack.
“No, it would happen for anyone injured in the pack. It’s just especially hard because he’s the fulcrum. Which I realize is the center, but you'll learn that each of us play a role and are equal. Just because he has the leader wrist mark doesn't make him the dominant person,” Natasha said and she sighed. Her purpose had moved on. “I need to go and talk to Wong. He’s coming in and I need to see if he can help us with Steve. Can you?” She thumbed it over her shoulder.
Natasha glared at him, grabbed his arm, and said through clenched teeth, “Don’t you think I know that? But do you want me to blame him for trying to protect his family?”
The thick revolting liquid gurgled down his throat as he fought to keep it down. Steve shuddered, and his vision hazed and pixelated. Gooseflesh rose on his body and even the charred skin on his mid-section went cold. He downed the drink and let the tears flow. The evilness of the place he used to work hit him – a place he once thought redeemable. It wasn’t – never was. It had been infected with a parasite inside of it. The V-Corps could have served as a conduit, a go between to the two different communities, but men – men like Ross and Pierce disrupted it and infested with evil ideals.
Tony yanks away and groans. “You are distracting me now. We need to eat, and you need some electrolytes and some rest.” He starts to stand, the soapy foam running rivulets down his chest, over his navel and to his half hard cock. “JARVIS, how’s that meal-.”
“I know. Who says I’m not doing what I want to do?” he replies and those blue eyes that pierced him through as a wild beast, strike at Tony’s heart again. “I’ve been doing what I wanted to do since I was three years old. You should have asked my Ma.”
“No, no,” Tony muttered and then raised his hands to Barnes who had once again brought the rifle to bear. Tony couldn’t deny the look of dread, of mourning, of isolation in Barnes’ expression. Yet, the echo of his mother’s death beat through the bond like an everlasting curse. He activated the repulsors. “You killed her.”
“I could.” Admitting that felt like he’d lifted a boulder up a mountain. “I can’t say that it would be easy for me. But I would. You have to give me room to figure it out and to stop with the teasing.” Steve fixed his eyes on the fire. He didn’t want to show his shame at the pain he felt when Tony used that sharp wit.
“What is it? Did I say something wrong?” A look crossed over Tony’s face as if he’s blaming himself. It is so blatant – the expression of self-disgust and revulsion that Steve needs to rectify the situation immediately.
Thor glances over Tony’s shoulder to where Steven is standing. A look of recognition crosses Thor’s face and he smiles. “It cannot be. Steven of the Carbonelli clan? We were great friends of the day. I missed you these many years. I had understood that you perished along with all of the Carbonelli family.”
“God, you’re like a kid at Christmas.” Steve relents because he has no other choice, really. He takes the lead down the stairs and guides Tony to the kitchen instead of the ground floor laboratory. “First, we eat.”
“It’s okay, Bruce,” Steve said. “Tony’s got a lot on his mind. I’m sorry I interrupted you. But I really do need to help Clint. We were in the middle of bonding when the train was attacked. And now-.” Steve shuddered. “I don’t know. It actually feels like Clint’s soul is trying to leave his body.”
Steve listens and stops on time to avert a calamity. “Right! Let’s go out the door to the laundry room.”
As if he reads Tony’s mind, Steve pulls away and then gently pushes his legs open. He kneels next to the bed and heaves Tony toward him. Folding Tony’s legs up to his chest but keeping them open, Steve bends down and laps at Tony’s balls and then works further back, licking at his ass and tantalizing his hole. The brush of his tongue and beard leave Tony panting and crying out. He wants more, he needs more. His hole is hungry for Steve, wanting the full girth of Steve in him. Steve slides his tongue inward and then flicks a little so that Tony sees nothing but the stars. He groans out and grapples on the bed for purchase.
Steven arches a brow and considers him. “I’m not too sure I should celebrate. I don’t know if that’s a good thing or not.”
Hiring Clint was one of the best things they did once they’d decided that Steve had too much on his plate – what with him helping Tony out in the lab, working on his bestselling comic book under Asgardian Comics, plus his continued focus on his fine arts portfolio. Luckily, Sam and Bucky directed Clint to them from the Rehab center they ran in D.C.. Clint had been looking to relocate to New York City. It worked out for the best.
“Yeah, I did.” Steve falls silent, closing away the explanation, but Tony chases after it like he’s skipping through a dark and shadowy meadow trying to capture butterflies.
Tony laughs and drags Steve into the room. “Glasses, please?” When Steve doesn’t immediately respond, Tony taps his shirt. “Glasses.”
Steve remains perfectly still in the anteroom of the prince’s workshop. In this room, Steve cleaned the instruments of his trade, now he hides from Stane instead of being of service to Tony during his time of need. Circumstances force Steve to sit on the sidelines while Obie and Tony discuss the current state of affairs. If Steve had been five minutes faster, then he would be safely tucked under Tony’s desk, cock in mouth, being useful and satiated at the same time. Part of Steve wants to escape through the other door and slip silently to his quarters or to the prince’s, but then curiosity rouses him to stay put and listen to two of the most powerful men in the Conclave talk of war, factions, and the possibilities of a coup.
“I know.” It seems like he wants to say more, but he stops himself. He changes topics again. “Time for a ride back?”
“I’m not sure I’m following you,” he replied. It was true. He wasn’t following her because he had the distinct impression that she wasn’t actually talking to him. But maybe some other version of him. How did she know where she was, or when she was? How did she not go insane?
“I assure you; Tony is in no immediate danger. I’ve started him on an anti-seizure medication and he’s resting. It’s what he needs right now.” Even though Strange sounds incredibly pompous and arrogant, Steve believes him.
“Jesus, yes,” Tony said and brought Steve back to his cock. Steve answered Tony’s unspoken words by bringing him all in at once. Tony nearly shot right then, but he cringed and held back. “Move, please, Steve move.”
He doesn’t particularly like it that the artificial intelligence calls him Tony’s nickname but he figures it must be the way that Tony originally programmed it when he decided what he might bring with him – mentally – in this virtual world.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said again. He didn’t know what else to say. He felt cursed by the universe. It was ironic. Considering his physique, Steve had transformed into a kind of Quasimodo. Who would want him with such a deformity?
“Interesting,” Steve said. He never was a good profiler, but he believed in people and had faith in them. “And where does one clandestine boss who may or may not be dead get the funds?”
"Please."  Tony had only managed the sweet begging gasp before Steve dropped to his knees and pulled away the zipped pants and boxers to wrap those magnificent lips around his half hard cock. His knees nearly gave out, his mouth went dry, and he threw his head back as Steve braced him to suck him off. It was too much and not enough. He wanted to know about this god at his feet, kneeling and supplicating before him. But he had let the emotions of the moment take over him and he pounded like a fiend into that perfect mouth, not thinking he'd be able to get off but his orgasm surprised him, overtaking him in seconds and he flooded Steve’s mouth for the second time in as many hours.
Tony hadn’t asked what any of it meant, but now he teetered between worlds. His vampire self – crucified and tormented – balancing between life and death, and his newly spirited wraith form. He couldn’t leave. He was sentenced to stay with his body, anchored to his suffering. The vampire near him moaned and cried. The anguish had all but defined her now. In his insubstantial form he peered at the world around him, but it wasn’t daylight that greeted him. The whole of the Earth throbbed and oscillated with the lost figures of the dead. Were they all wraiths like him, trapped between life and death?
Steve hears a clacking behind him and then the duchess sidles up to him. Pepper is all business and professional. “Agent Rumlow, the Avengers’ Crew does not need you to sweep for bombs. We have our own security and therefore you are not permitted on Prince Stark’s ship.” She turns briefly to Steve. “Thank you. You can go back to your quarters now.”
“Look at you, just put your thumbs in your belt and you would be the perfect model of Captain America again,” Tony says. “I thought you grew old and forgot about that kind of thing.”
Part of Tony envies Steve’s solemn respect for his father. He should feel the same way about his own, considering dear old dad is dead too. But Tony can’t. His father drove drunk resulting in his death and the death of Tony’s mother . Tony can’t ever forgive him for that little factoid. “I’m sorry to hear that. But you joined the Army to respect him, I think.”
The last night with Tony helped. It shifted his view. A bit. But miracles were fantasy, and recovery was a process. He knew that. He saw enough of his father’s generation come home from World War I mad with shell shock. It took time, a commodity that none of them had to spend these days.
Dealing with what Bucky may think of his status can wait another day or two. He checks the time and figures he doesn’t have a lot of it before Pepper returns and he’ll be expected to accompany Tony to the luncheon. His stomach growls and that just won’t do.
When Steve peers over his shoulder, he spots Tony staring and turning bright red and considers his mission a resounding success. “Come, I’ll show you to The Cage.” He throws a beckoning lilt to his voice and it works like a charm. He thinks he’s getting the hang of this flirting thing.
“He accepts you, they all do,” Steve says and finds a comfort in his own words. Here in this sanctuary, he’s found acceptance and belief that he can be happy in his skin.
Steve closes his eyes and Tony is there, edged and uncomfortable with Steve’s hands on him, shifting away, but allowing Steve to touch him. “He tried to remember, he did.”
Prince Anthony crinkles his eyes into a fake smile, notes the man’s name badge and says, “I see your pronouns are he/him. Well.” He points to Steve. “You wouldn’t wait on my friend the last time he was in this store, so this time you’re going to with a most genuine smile you can muster.”
When he takes off, he ignores JARVIS’ warning that the flight stabilizers are still not rotating correctly. He manually forces the stabilization; there’s no time for dallying. It takes him a little over 30 minutes to make it across the ocean and he puts it into overdrive to zero in on his destination. Asia is a blur and then he’s finally focused on Afghanistan’s outer regions where there’s little signs of civilization and only warlords rule.
Steve nods and then addresses Tony again. “Are you ready?” With a curt nod, Tony agrees. Steve presses forward and they go down the steps as he narrates the path. He bends Tony downward as they go under the helicopter’s blades and the wind whips around them. It’s raining out now, the storm’s finally hit the island. He hopes the ride won’t be too choppy.
“I’ll make real hot chocolate,” Steve states. By the looks of him, he needs this so Tony acquiesces. Sometimes a menial task helps right the mind. Tony’s done enough simple re-wires to verify that little fact.
On shaking arms, Steve gathers himself and manages getting to his hands and knees. He drags the chains as the wings attached to his back flop and flap. “I-I, Tony?”
He taps the glass topped desk that still has nothing on it. “Yes, very official.” He rarely works in his office. He prefers his laboratory, two floors down.
“I’m not doing it, Obie. I’m not here to be galactic emperor. Do you hear how silly that even sounds? I’m only here to take care of my systems and to support the others. This isn’t an empire.”
It takes a moment before Tony says, “It felt like a betrayal. Like you picked protecting him over telling me the truth.”
“I thought Sam and Natasha were working on that with you.” Tony leans his arm on the back of the chair.
Sam laughed. “More complicated than being in a soul pack? It might not feel right because of when you grew up, but it probably fits better than trying to pretend, doesn’t it?”
“That’s all you got to say, Stark?” Natasha groused and Clint flinched. He stayed clear of Steve as Bruce wrapped his arms around himself and climbed to his feet, his torn pants not providing much modesty.
"So he made you just to damn you?" Tony asks and picks up his wineglass. "Seems like a very shitty thing to do."
“Step over me but face me. Put your feet on either side of the shield.” Steve thumps the packed snow around them.
“The – it- he was, is an experiment, sir,” Sawyer said and Rumlow scowled at him. “He’s special. We gotta take samples every couple of days for experiments.”
“Hot chocolate. My mom’s recipe,” Coulson said and placed the tray on the worktable. Tony had no idea where he’d conjured up the ingredients in the mansion to make hot chocolate but it looked enticing. The tall mug was topped with whipped cream with chocolate syrup drizzled over it.
He got onto his hands and knees, ignoring his own wounds and crawled over to Steve. “You need to lie down.”
“I guess that’s a yes.” Tony raises a brow. “Look I gotta do my business. So, you stay here and I’ll go over that way.” He thumbs it over his shoulder. The lion drops onto his side and closes his eyes. “Okay then.”
“You are mine and destined for greater things now,” Tony whispers. He slides the dildo into the omega’s ass – the slick hot and wet. To help the omega, he clamps the cock ring on him to ensure he doesn’t come. He’s not allowed to – at all. Tony controls and owns his orgasms for the rest of his days. Steven groans through Tony’s work, his arms already shaking from the effort.
“Stay with me?” Tony asked, and he bowed his head against Steve’s chest. While Steve wanted to beg off, so he could investigate the possibilities of the vision, he nodded in reply.
Sam tweets twice behind him and Redwing flies past Bucky’s head to land on his master’s shoulder. Bucky peers over his shoulder to find out if Sam has any intel. The bird does a little bob or two and Sam holds up his open hand twice to Bucky. Sam gestures outward and Redwing squaws once and then takes off to perch in a tree not a dozen meters from their position. Sam taps his face and then points to the tree.
The blush of excitement colored Steven’s chest and cheeks. “Something more?” His adam’s apple bobbed and he swallowed.
Steve closed down and that’s when Tony placed his hand over Steve’s and said, “Contact Sam. Find out what he knows. We’ll travel to DC or wherever the funeral takes place.” London. He thought Steve had said something about Peggy being moved to London by her children. “All of us together. Bruce, could you work with JARVIS and get the jet ready to go?”
“Fuck!” Tony said and sat up. “Do we have a fucking chance or not? Is he going to do this split off and die thing? Is that what he’s trying to do?”
Steve shrugged but didn’t take his hand away. After so long with little contact with anyone else that wasn’t in a battle, he basked and enjoyed it. “I think. I do it with Bruce, Nat, and Sam a bit. Not much. I don’t want to burden them.”
“All of us,” Tony said and swallowed. He hated to kick a team mate when he was down but the fact remained that Steve snuck out and left him to deal with the revelation. Truth be told, Steve may have concluded that he’d spent enough time and that it handling the rest of the pack had been in order, but Tony resented the fact that he’d left with nary a word. Tony pressed his fingers into his eyes. Since when did he say nary? Thor was getting into his head.
“The Blood Den,” he said. He started away, with no intention of going in with them. He walked a few paces with his head down and then turned. “Don’t go in. It’s nothing you need to see, and everything you desire. Don’t go in.”
“Oh sweetheart,” Tony said and noticed how Steve beamed at the endearment. “I just want you to be comfortable. We take it as slow as you want, as slow as you need.”
Bruce finishes detangling all the wires and looks over the lenses of his glasses at Tony. “Maybe you should call up Reed Richards.”
“Soul packs are all different. Some soul packs function with the ability to communicate without spoken words. The secrecy of how soul packs work has led to myths and fairy tales about them. This has led to some nations conscripting these packs into service of the country’s needs. Other soul packs are more intimately involved with understanding emotions and supporting one another.” That would be nice, but then again, Steve wasn’t sure he liked the idea of anyone in his head. At least not these days. His head mixed emotions so fast he felt like he was on the rollercoaster at Coney Island again. “The rarest soul pack shares all communication and emotion. The more soul packs are in contact with one another, the stronger the bonds.”
“So the nanites from the Steve trapped in the singularity are the reason that Steve is having these seizures,” Logan asks.
Several missteps and he smacks into a Strike Team that’s just entered the ship. He recognizes the lead of the Strike Team, Brock Rumlow. From everything he’s heard from the different Brothel’s – Brock’s a bastard. Natasha won’t even allow him in the Widow Brothel at all.
Wanda shrugs. “Nat is a killer when it comes to contracts. She wants to make sure that the prince is engaged.”
“Your Soul Keeper is the one who should be stopped. He’s keeping souls here to feast on. He’s captured the souls so that they cannot move on, cannot find peace, cannot be reborn. You don’t know it because you’re not the Silver Knight. You never were. This isn’t the world you were born to.” He lifts his hand and clamps an armored gauntlet around the tip of the Silver Knight’s sword. “You know this. You’ve laid in bed at night and have the nightmares and dreams. And when you wake up you wonder if everything you know is a lie.”
“I’m in need of fresh air for my health.” He points to Banner. “Ask Bruce, my doctor, there. He wants me to get out of the shop, get away from the forge, and breathe the fresh air. So, will you?”
“JARVIS updated me,” Tony said. “Some of it is still encrypted though. It will take ages to go through it all.”
"When I was growing up there was a lady who lived in the tenement across the street. You know, she didn't have much and she had a baby to feed. She did it."  Steve doesn't elaborate on what
At that admission, Tony slips his arm around Steve’s waist and brings him closer. He clasps his other hand and gazes at him as if he’s the only human being in the universe. “Let’s see exactly what that means, shall we?”
“Nothing, I didn’t do anything,” Tony says and turns back to the painting. He’s going to blame it on that thing in his living room. He has to have a serious conversation with Pepper.
“That’s a strategy, which I can tell you the Lord Stark favors. He understands that if we are to do this – it isn’t a game. That we do this as a team, as a construct of the new future with Lord Stark, Prime Alpha at our head. We do this, together. A team. We assembled the best and the brightest for this. Lord Stark didn’t just invite you because he liked your looks. He invited you because you hold the power and he knows you’re intelligent enough to know that power flows to him.” Steven’s words strike to the heart of Tony’s claim and future hopes.
When he wrote the letter he wanted to explain to Tony why he had to cut out his bonding gland. His purpose seemed clear enough to him, but he thought it might confuse other people, especially Tony. He didn’t want to seem like a basket case, though he thought at some points in time he might be dissembling into one. The letter became his cornerstone, the foundation of his new status. He had hoped the letter would help to explain his reasons and his wishes.
But how could he without damaging everything? He’d chosen not to in order to let the past stay where it was – in the past. Everyone had told him to let the past be – that he needed to grow into the future. The present. No one warned him that the past would hunt him like an animal for the rest of his days. His split mind about his past, about everything that happened in his past, in Bucky’s past, froze him into paralysis. He couldn’t fathom how to deal with it, so the easiest thing had been to ignore it, pretend it didn’t exist. Or let it lie.
“No kissing,” she repeats and picks up the tablet. She types as she talks. “Rack, no kissing. You’ll need to go through the list of limitations. Once you do that, we can prepare a room and you can select the alpha that fits your nee-.”
He went to the middle of the room where pillows and cushions lined a sloping cradle. Pepper had always called it his crib, but he could lie in it for hours and stare up at the projections around him, surrounding him and lose himself in thought. When he settled on the cushions he asked, “JARVIS, project the latest data on the networking of soul packs.”
Tony tightens his lips and shakes his head. “No. Not at all. She’s cookies and thick Eastern European sauces and candles burning down to their end.”
Steve drops the spoon. He isn’t happy that Yinsen’s life was forfeit so that Steve could join Tony here. He’s going to have to take that up with Fury the next time he sees him. “I’m sorry.”
Pillows and blankets bundled in his arms, Steve lifted a shoulder. “I’m not saying I can immediately come out to the world, but I can come out to those I trust.” The words flowed like the rapids of a river. Stopping them, stopping the possibilities might be like trying to halt that river. No dam would do it.
“What do you mean, where was I?” Steve had said. A red blur of color heated his face and the slightest tremor tainted his voice. “I’m right here with you. Let’s just get the job done.”
Here everything glows and sparkles with shine and chrome and it’s beautiful. Where he used to live, life consisted of dust and dirt and a whole lot of hunger. Why humans ever journeyed out to the stars, Steve will never know. Seems a pretty stupid proposition to him, considering not many planets were Earth like – or so they say – Steve will never know. He’s only heard the tall tales of Earth. It’s just a legend.
“It’s at a boiling point. They’re cleaning house. This can’t be good. This new procedure is going to go to hell on them,” Natasha said. “We have to make plans.”
As sure as he asserts that he’ll accept the assignment, Steve instantly thinks everything in his life is about to change.
When they disembarked, Steve gravitated to Tony’s side and they ended up sharing a car together to get to the hotel that JARVIS had booked. Steve only mumbled a few words now and again, and once they were checked in, he said his goodnights and went to his room without a further word.
“I understand he was your colleague. You were on his team, took direct orders from him. But you do know the punishment for betraying your own species, for putting humans at risk of contamination. Agent Barton, you know what’s at stake.”
He meets the gaze of the omega and somewhere deep inside of Tony, he feels a pulse, a throb as if something new and alien awakens within him. “I’m deadly serious, Pep. It’s him or no one.”
Tony stops in his tracks. “Oh Captain, this would have been so much more fun if you hadn’t used that shriveled raisin of a brain of yours.” The armor pivots and the right hand repulsor fires, but Steve snaps the shield up in time to ward it off.
“That is not part of my pack. That is a monstrosity,” Tony said and pointed at Bucky over Steve’s shoulder.
“Once we get to the outer boundary of Ultron’s programming it won’t be so intense. What you’re not sure of is the exit Door. Or one of them. I programmed them in. This is the most obvious Door that there will be. Other Doors won’t be. We have to stick together so that you know what’s a Door and what’s an illusion.” Tony bends down and picks up a backpack.
“Well then that’s within range.” It is but it doesn’t mean much. Tony still needs to hunt down a lion in territory he neither knows nor has been able to build up any goodwill.
Tony sweeps his hands aside and the images of Captain America disappear in favor of the propulsion systems on the weapon in question. He feels like a three year old caught red handed trying to feed his spinach to the dog. "Good as ever."
Confused, Tony wavered as if he might snatch his hand away from Steve, but he tentatively allowed his touch.  The hum of energy running through Tony vibrated like a racecar engine. More than a car, it throttled through Steve, galloping with unbridled need and yearning to break free. Steve became the conduit of that energy; it flowed through him, finding ground within Sam’s horrific injuries. Before him, the organs pinked up, losing their graying color, the blood pumped through repaired vessels, the heart beat with a strong, steady rhythm. The pulse of energy strumming through Steve increased the rate of his own heart beat until he nearly had to gasp for breath as if he’d walked back in time and suffered from asthma again. But he never relented. He kept his hand on Sam, following the course of the wounds, the energy sewing them back together, giving over what he drank from Tony to mend what had been damaged.
Steve forces his concentration to shift from the physical to mental sparing with the prince. “You’re adequate.”
“How would you like me, my lord?” His blue eyes are shot with darkness and their crystalline nature glimmer against the hyper-scape shining around them through the windows. They are sharp as shards, piercing in their anger. Though Tony has to admit, he’s breathtaking – his muscles have filled out and his shoulders are a masterpiece. His waist small and tight and his Adonis belt something that makes Tony’s mouth water with anticipation.
The bigger man rubs Steve’s shoulder and jostles him a bit. “No worries, Steve. This isn’t my first rodeo, but it is yours. Watch how it’s done.”
“Sawyer, sir. We’ve been waiting for you. All of us. For years now.” He sniffled against the harsh winds from the east and then smiled.
Tony jerks his hand away. “You can’t be with me.” He folds his hands on his lap. He can’t help it, but his shoulders curl in. He wants to be strong, arrogant, self-confident but it hits too closely to home. The music on the radio turns to only static. “You can’t be with me because you can’t deal with it. I get it. I understand.” He doesn’t, of course. How could he? He’s been living with this impairment for a decade. The shadows of his life are all he has now. Nothing left. Not even music.
“I know Stark requested you, and only you. He won’t participate in the Peace Conference unless you are assigned as his personal bodyguard.”
“Bucky? He said something about Bucky?” Natasha asked. Her wide eyes spoke volumes but it sounded like a rattle of noise to him.
“Thrust level 3,” he commands and the dildo thrums to life. Immediately it’s obvious that Steven’s surprised and turned on by the fake cock in his ass. He tries to shove back on it, but of course it’s already deeply embedded.
Steve heard the shivering fear in Tony’s voice. “No. No, it doesn’t matter. I just want to understand.” He grasped Tony’s hands in his and brought the pulsating light to his lips. Steve found he needed Tony’s strength and support. After all this time, the weakness latched onto him. He kissed each of Tony’s palms and a sliver of heat with the tingle of electricity went through him. “I just want to know you’re all right.”
“He’s leaving for DC?” Bruce said and stood up. He avoided the glass shards on the floor like an expert. Tony figured he must have a lot of experience in the field of dealing with Hulk-related outcomes.
Cho cringes at the thrown out nickname. “I’m not your sister and I know how to read your interface monitor. If the threat to the Captain gets into the red zone, we’ll pull him out.”
Steve ducks into the shuttle only to be impressed by its size inside; the fear of claustrophobia melts away. It’s not large by any means but it is open and sleek like everything else Tony’s designed. He touches the side of the vehicle and his hands slides over the surface. It’s well crafted and thoughtful in its form and function, Steve can already see that fact. Its artistry causes an ache deep inside Steve like he’s missing a limb.
“Whose side are you on?” Sometimes, Natasha is like a blur – vague and pixelated against the background. He can never quite pin her down.
“Beloved is just between you and me. The rest of the pack respects your place. They circle around us. The two of us.” Steve kept his voice low, almost reverent. “Beloved not only means the connotations that you keep going back to, Tony. It’s the culmination of all of the other possible labels from Family to Confidant to Companion.”
“I am. Maybe it’s the soul thing, or those dreams.” Steve’s soul sounded a beat, strong and steady, so different than his quiet tentative voice.
Steve eyes him, weighing his response but Tony chimes in. “The deal was that he is in my custody and I am allowing you to debrief him.”
“The Purge refers to when those who rebelled against that order were cast out. They migrated to the rim and people started calling it the Purge Rim,” Steven says. “The rebels were all sorts, from alpha all the way down to the lowest omega.”
“You’ve kept all of your clients very happy, Steve. General Fury was raving about you this morning.”
“Okay, so maybe not blind.” Blu shifts his gaze back to Tony. “I still think you’re a crappy lion. Why haven’t you eaten those guys? I mean between you and me they aren’t treating you very well. Just – you know – bite them.” Tony mimes biting and the lion opens his mouth making a sound that melds a yawn with a growl. “Okay, so maybe you don’t like terrorist snacks.”
Tony had huddled away from his father, sobbing quiet tears. It had been Jarvis who appeared at his bedroom door when his father left. He collected Tony and gave him an ice pack for his bruised cheek.
“Not sure this is the best bedtime story, old man.” They’ve gotten into a habit of whispering either a memory or a bit of a book as a way to sign off for the night. It helps them both sleep. They suffer night terrors. Even the lion seems to enjoy the stories. Tony notices that at night he tugs against his chain to sidle up as close as possible to listen to their whispers.
Before he realizes it, Steve’s pulling over and Tony can hear the crunch of gravel beneath the tires of the bike. “Little roadside dinner.”
He peers over his shoulder, to the unseen and far distant town. Sam will take care of his people, he’s sure of it. But he wonders if he’s been manipulated into a trap.
“It’s fantastic. It’s so much better than the outside. Outside is so ugl-.” He gulps back the rest of the word.
He stops and looks at her. They are in his workshop and he’s playing with a new version of the repulsor. He thinks he can get it to have differing degrees of fire power. “What do you mean?”
“You got a big ass number of issues to deal with. I need you to focus on the big three players, not all these little ones.” Fury steps up to the display. He still hasn’t replaced his computerized eye, it had once been enhanced, a vulnerability that the artificial intelligence of Ultron tried to hijack. He wears a black eye patch that matches his long leather coat.
Tony’s fingers dance over the keys, measure after measure while Steve stands to the side, listening in awe and in empathy. The prince pours out his pain, his haunted agony that continues to plague him as he touches the keys, his eyes closed, his face tense with worry. The music comes to a close as he fumbles on a note and then he pounds on the keys, looking up almost startled to see them.
He waves at the animal in the cave corner and forces himself to his feet. Blu only growls and then shifts his gaze away from Tony to stare at the wall. Tony has no idea why the big animal didn’t chomp down and eat him, seems like it would have been the best thing to do for its own self-preservation. The lion even seems to grumble as Tony goes to the little soup pot that Yinsen has on the single burner.
“Not sure,” Jamison says. “I’m getting most of my intel from Natalie. She says he’s aligning with An’Rossi.”
It brought back memories of the Howling Commandoes. Of his life before and how it faded farther and farther away every day. Though to this day, he still felt weak and small and alone. Taking Sam’s advice on several levels, Steve decided it was time to face Tony. It had been weeks since the fall of SHIELD. They hadn’t seen one another. All he felt through the bond had been a vibrant nervousness that only set him on edge when he concentrated on it.  While he was in New York he decided it would be best to visit Wong again. Denying the soul pack when it was growing so much now was fool’s play. He admitted that Sam knew what he was talking about – Steve was playing with fire. He couldn’t do that to other people. He needed to get everyone’s buy in, but especially Tony’s in more ways than one.
“We could get a new omega,” Pep says. “It’s not too late.  We could look somewhere else instead of here on Nod.”
While JARVIS searching for Blu, Tony surveils the countryside. This northern region is far from the metropolitan areas where cities blossom and little can be distinguished from other populous areas of the world. Here large regions of poppies grow to feed the ever-increasing desires of addicts across the developed world. No one can command farmers to plant wheat and other foodstuffs when the products of poppies offer a better paycheck, especially in poorer countries of the world.
“Indefinitely. I can power the engines, believe it or not.” Tony pulled away and smiled. “I just need to be exposed to the night sky and I can power them.” He touched his chest.
“God! A day?” Tony jumped up. “How long did you let me sleep, JARVIS? Jesus Christ!” JARVIS had the good sense not to answer Tony. “A day. No change?”
Tony kissed his chest and rubbed his hard cock against Steve’s fleshy erection. The difference in texture sent a wild rush through Tony and Steve reflected it, a shudder running through him in response. He knew Steve loved to take him just as he ached for Steve. But there wasn’t time and they both needed the connection. Delaying his satisfaction no more, Tony bit down with a sharp stab of Steve’s pectoral sending his mate into full blow orgasm. It only took one full gulp of heated blood to cause Tony’s body to answer. The pulse of life blasted through him more like the heart of an explosion than a wave. His whole body juddered. Every neuron he’d had as a mortal came alive and sang out, pulsating and hot with the memory of living. His brain burst into white stars and the night faded as he became the sun. He floated there, bathing in the aftermath until he felt a slight caress on his cheek and he realized he’d hung on a little too long. He disengaged his fangs and slipped off Steve. They still lay there, entangled and quaking from their dual climaxes.
Tony crosses the room when Steve doesn’t take his hand. Even as Steve moves slightly away from him, he brushes past him and taps the wall near the pinned drawings. “Who did these?” He points to the three quarters profile of a woman with her face in her hand and her tender eyes gazing at the viewer. “Who is this? Your mother, Sarah?”
“There wasn’t much left for me back in New York City. The place is a mess anyhow, with the gang wars.”
Howard placed his chin in his hand as he studied Tony. “I have no idea. We just don’t have the proper technology to do it.”
“I know,” she returned but didn’t promise anything. A fresh wound hurt too much if it didn’t heal. She needed to recover before she could come back to him and be his friend. He understood it, with the logical part of his brain, but the rest, the rest felt like those stray loose ends in the core of who he was, aching and yearning for an anchor and finding none.
Good information. He nods but then switches the subject again. “Don’t tell me you’re here with Vision.”
He wants Steve to be his, only his. And this is the way to do it. He’s breaking down walls and limits and he doesn’t care as he caresses and gives and enters Steve. As they come together in some shuddering embrace with Steve’s legs grappling around him and Tony clutching his arms. It’s more than he hoped for that night so many months ago when he picked up a hooker looking for a good time. He loses all sense of self and falls into Steve, fucking and pounding until they are both crying out, until he blanks as his vision whites out and his breath is stolen from his lungs.
“God, Sheriff, I said-.” He howls as Steve downs his entire length, suckling. He’s hungry for it, he laps and rings his tongue along the underneath until Tony’s gripping the arms of the chair he’s sitting in. He jerks up into Steve’s mouth. Encouraging, Steve pushes his hands under Tony to support him, allowing him to thrust into Steve’s mouth with abandon.
“Yes, okay. I’ll have Jarvis set Steve up in the suite next to yours. I also placed the phone, tablet, and computer for him in the room as well.”
“No! Of course not! In fact, Steve made a promise never to act on his quote unquote homosexual tendencies to Doctor Erskine. So, he hasn’t.” He breathes out through his mouth and then says as quickly as possible, “I did. I did exactly what you said, and he ran scared. Accusing me of taking what I wanted like my father.” Tony groans and closes his eyes. “What do I do, Nat?”
“Difficult day?” Steve says and his expression aches through him. It is so very obvious that he’s trying, that he wants Tony to like him. He feels the connection too; it’s undeniable.
Tony exhales a sigh of relief and turns to Steve. “That went extremely well. Did you enjoy the game?”
“A little less than a month,” Tony says and then touches the frame of his glasses. He’s worn them too long over the last few days. The headaches pound a beat in his whole skull. “And I won’t be sighted during the time I’ll be here. Ensure that we have minimal staff and the staff we have are under the Non-disclosure agreement with background checks.”
“I didn’t know other than a quick reference.” Anger rages through him. This was supposed to be a fair fight. A fight of fist-to-cuffs, not a mind game. But then again, Natasha learned mind games in her training. This would be what to expect from this rim. “Ultron, you know Natasha – Natasha saw the same thing I did. She knows exactly what I know.”
Never a heavy drinker, Steve takes it anyway and downs the burning liquid in one swallow. “I don’t have a choice.”
Once again, Tony waves him off. “Locomotives will be things of the past. The future lies in privatization of transportation. Look at this fine country, the long pastures and fields. We cannot crisis cross it with the iron monster, the train. No, it will be something greater, more versatile.”
“Morning,” Tony says and sits on the side of the bed. Well, at least he doesn’t have to lie about sleeping with his new husband. He laughs inwardly. “I’m going to shower and dress. I think JARVIS has some clothes for you in the guest bedroom.” He gets up and heads to the ensuite, not looking back, hoping that Steve understand the unspoken request to leave.
He finds tears streaming down his face. It motivates him to move, to crash through the pain binding him in the cold. Tony blinks away the tears and then has his phone in his hand before he can stop himself. He has connected to a number with the phone at his ear.
“How the hell old is Ross?” Tony had asked but then he turned back to the point of the conversation. “So it wasn’t just the disease?”
It makes no sense to Steve; Ultron had been trying to use it as a strategy to knock Steve out of the battle. Steve hesitates. Can Ultron construct Tony? Would Steve know the difference?
Inside his core, in his chest his heart throbbed a battle beat like he fought the legions of the Red Skull again. He marched onward toward the fields of corn and barley. He ignored the whipping of the stalks as he trampled through the rows of corn. He thought of nothing but the need to go, to flee, to disappear. He refused the images of home, of the Tower, of his soul pack. His chest drained of hope and he ached. He could cover miles, he could keep going. No one would find him. He could cut himself off and never see another soul again.
Rhodey paused before he answered. “Yeah. I can swing it. I’m here as a trainer, anyhow. Let me get out of my next class of the conference.”
Steven smiles, and it is rueful and touched with melancholy. “I’m just an omega from the old world, sir.”
With so many out in the field, Steve had to keep the Soul Mantra in his head otherwise the sheer spread of their energies while working on the same task might cause chaos along the lines. The Mantra assisted in their concentration. He heard a flash of thunder and saw lightning up head. “Thor?”
“Like it’s October. It’s an Autumn sky. That’s the way it is here in August. Beautiful, forbidding. It reminds me of Norway in some ways,” Tony says as he clutches the railing.
“It’s okay, Bucky, you can rest,” Steve reassures him and he hears movement behind him and peers over his shoulder to find Tony standing in the doorway. It centers him and he rests his hand on Bucky. “It’s okay.”
“Go through the door, to the right, then take the main corridor to the elevators to the lower section. You’re assigned to the Widow’s Brothel. She’ll treat you well.”
“Language my ass, I’m fucking cold,” Steve says and this time the match strikes true. The flare of the flame startles him and he stares at it entranced for a second before Tony’s quaking jolt him back to reality. Turning to the fireplace, he starts the kindling and it bursts into flames easily enough. It’s a little smoky because of how wet it is, but it will do.
“Did you know I used to do this a lot when I was at MIT. Became quite the expert. All the grad students would come to me when they broke their nose,” Tony says as he feels along the bridge. “You’d be surprised at how many grad students break their noses.”
Tony swallows down the fear. He can’t play this as easily as he thought. But he has the suit and can rocket away at any time he wants. “I’m here to save him.”
Ever since that stupid dinner he’d had with Tony, things had gone wrong. He found it harder and harder to keep his head on straight. It wouldn’t do, not with tons of missions coming up. Fury, Natasha, even Rumlow and the Strike Team depended on him. He needed to get his head in the game. He smashed a fist into the bag and it flew off the chain, striking the brick wall, and exploding all over the floor. It joined the three others – sacrifices to Steve’s mental instability.
He clears his throat. “There’s a towel on the rack. Switch next to the tub there to turn it off.” He pulls out his phone and shakes it. “I gotta go.” He has no idea if Steve will understand his ruse, that he needs to go to take a call – which is false – but he doesn’t care. He can’t think of Steve that way. Sure, it’s okay to appreciate the man’s perfection, but to dissolve into him, to long for it. No. There is no way.
All he can think of is his first time with Tony. How professional and distant Tony was that time. How it felt more like a contract than a first date. Or anything like that. He loved Tony. He still does. But sometimes love isn’t met to mean happily ever after. He’s learned that now.
“This sounds like a lot of hogwash,” Tony said and ruffled his hands through his hair. “Is anyone else really listening to this crap?”
Steve agrees and slips away, thankful that Rumlow hadn’t recognized him as one of the Station’s Escorts. He scurries back to his quarters making a few wrong turns but manages to find his way without much trouble. He dumps all his clothes in the closet and worries about washing them later. First things, first, he needs his meds, and he needs a shower. Pulling out his bag he digs through it and finds the small daily patches. He puts them aside and then looks for something to wear for the day. A simple tunic and drawstring pants will do. He doesn’t imagine he’ll be doing much of anything. He grabs for his soaps and shampoo and heads to the bathroom.
It's audacious. Steve has a feeling that Tony lives by a creed of audacity, stupidity, and a little bit of pluck. He cannot believe how such an intelligent man can be so confounding. “There’ll be none of that on this trip. We can't risk it.” He doesn’t confess that he believes Schmidt won’t allow him in the main house at all.
Immediately Tony cradled his arm against his chest. The damage had been done; at the very least Bruce had seen it. Clear as day. Even as he concealed the markings, Tony burned with pain. Not the brand, not the fucking soul bond mark that he’d wished for and hoped for all along, but from the shared agony from his bonded – from Steve. When he looked around the group, everyone except for Hill had a haunted, almost gaunt look to their eyes. They felt it, too. Is this what it meant to be part of the pack? They shared everything. The joy and the pain?
“They’re about to do a psych eval on Steve. That can’t happen,” Tony replies and follows Happy’s silent directions on where to go next. They end up waiting at the elevator.
Tony furrows his brow and says, “I wonder – you called me Tony at one point. Now it’s back to formalities.”
“Then come with us,” Tony said and even as he spoke the scene around him dissolved like warm water against a frozen windshield.
If it is not to be, if the gland has not been primed for him by the knot and Tony’s own scent – then the lack of synchronicity of their hormones would taint the taste. It would be bitter, acidic, and burn Tony’s tongue. It would sicken, even poison him to the brink of illness.  The flow bursts into his mouth and it is the elixir of life. It’s sweet and honeyed, so fulfilling that it feels as if something basic, something integral to his life that he’d been missing all along snaps into place. He needs more than this. He reaches down and unlocks the spreader bar, casting it away. Fumbling with his zipper, he pulls out his heavy cock and pushes the omega’s legs apart. With the cock cage in the way, it’s awkward, but Tony rams home and shudders with release. He pumps into the omega, fucking him with a wild fervor. He moans into the bite, the flood of elixir hits his tongue and Tony nearly swoons with its taste.
Steve smiles as Tony points to an area on the map. “Last intel, he’s in this area. Do you think you could make it there and back without too much trouble?”
“It is if you’re making it 10 degrees cooler with your fucking broad shoulders. Now move. I have work to do.” Tony feels the sun shift on his face again and mutters a thank you as he stuffs the earbuds in. He needs to concentrate; normally he uses the virtual goggles interface and without that he’s stick with either using the gloves alone or nothing at all. Since he didn’t unpack his gloves yet, he just closes his eyes, lays back, and works with Friday over the next few hours. It takes all his memory power to go through the codes. He’s trained fairly extensively on memory techniques. Nothing like that stupid ‘mind palace’ shit but using his mathematical skills he’s fashioned ways to memorize lines of code as he works.
The lion rumbles louder but sounds like the old men Tony used to see at the park when he was a child. They’d sit there playing chess, complaining about the noise, the current politicians, and very often the children at play around them.
Maybe, just maybe when Strange told them to follow him through the golden portal again, a tiny wisp of regret hit Steve. While Strange spoke of their progress and the rest of the day included multiple trials and lessons with the rest of the pack, Steve longed for the cabin again. A do over – they called it these days. He missed his chance. He’d given Tony the wrong impression. For once in his life, the door to romance and something more opened, and Steve closed it.
The endearment – Captain my Captain – sounded forced, rang false somehow when Tony whispered it into his ear after his brush with Ultron, death by Mjolnir, resurrection, and resulting loss of memories. Steve ignored it, or tried to but it became more and more evident that Tony was groping around, searching for purchase, for some link to his former life and failing.
“I’m his best friend, and I happen to be an omega. You know that – so does he.” Steve didn’t like to broadcast his status. He hadn’t gone through presentation yet, not really. Not with anyone. If it hadn’t been for Erskine he would have been auctioned to the highest bidder at a Mating Block and on the end of a leash. Displayed and abused. Who knows what would have happened to him. “I’d like to do this for him. If it’s necessary.”
Tony insists on walking down to the helicopter. The medics glare at him, but it’s not going to stop him. They lift the empty gurney and carry it down the stairs as Tony follows them. Steve brings up the rear with the bag slung over his shoulders. Tony has the good sense not to say anything more. He has his walking cane and taps out the stairs until he gets to the door that leads the way to where the helicopter landed at the rear of the house where the deliveries from the docks are usually off loaded from the small trucks that are housed in the garage. The helicopter barely fits and the blades as sluicing through the air with a chopping beat. Tony takes him by the arm, but Steve’s not comfortable with it.
“Whoa, you’re calling me by my name. What the hell is happening,” Rhodey said. Tony detected the stress and caring in his voice.
Steve only shrugged at Tony’s question. He wasn’t about to reveal that he’d spent the last few years having distressingly realistic dreams about Tony, and that they were not of a Puritan variety.
He clenches his gauntleted hand and heads toward the water. The path through the stream is usually Blu’s first route to find food. There’s a possibility Tony might be able to find footprints by the stream or some other evidence of a big prey animal like a lion. His heart hammers in his chest. Today was the day he was going to test the HUD out, finally get out of this place, but now he’s petrified that Blu is gone, dead somewhere and Tony only thought of himself last night. He calls out several times as he approaches the water.
Steve huffs. “Of course not. So you can parade me around and show off that I’m not your class. No thank you.”
The expression, the light, the joy in Tony’s face breaks everything for Steve. He wants so much to kiss this man, to hold him and to rejoice. But that is not his place. Not at all. There’s a skip in time, a moment when a yearning passes over Tony’s face and then it’s gone and he’s clearing his throat and stepping away from Steve, breaking their handhold.
“It could be days, or weeks, or years. Since the Captain doesn’t know a lot of people now, I would suspect it will take some time for his pack to settle.” Strange looked as if he was figuring out the puzzle as he spoke.
“That seems universally fucked up,” Tony said. While it still stung that his astral projection or whatever the hell it was didn’t connect up with Rogers’, the idea that the man would have this promised wrist band that came to nothing – well, that had to hurt a lot more than being left out of some stupid pack. “I wonder if Rogers knows this?” That was supposed to be non-verbal, but unfortunately when in the midst of thought Tony had a tendency to babble.
Tony tightened his grip on the wheel; few used the term disease anymore. It was just accepted now that the vampire species of humans was just that a species. Not a regular one – not one that could be defined by the norms of biology, but something outside the natural. Disease wasn’t used, hadn’t been used for decades, but here Bruce was confessing to the fact that in the few decades, he was part of an experiment to reverse the disease, using the term disease.
“I became friends, comrades in arms with Steven first before I knew who Captain America was,” Thor added.
He swipes away the current iteration of the implant and sighs. Dropping onto a stool, Tony calls out, “Steve, you there?”
Grimacing, Steve dons the boots. His journey to Prime Station gave him quite enough experience with low gravity and high gravity fluctuations. He doesn’t want to vomit in front of the prince.
Tony grins and it hurts because everything hurts. The insidious beast implanted in his breast eats him from the inside out. “Whatever you say, Ghost-doctor.”
“Stark,” Natasha said and walked straight to the lounge pit where Pepper already sat. They greeted one another with a hug and a kiss.
“But I know, god, I’m smart enough to know what they did to him. I’m not angry with him anymore. Not about that. Am I angry with you for not telling me?” He stops, breathes out, and then says, “Yes, I am. I will be for a while. Not enough not to ask you to forgive my recklessness when I found out about Barnes. I’m angry and it will take a while for me to get over it. But I’m not angry enough to not love you.” He shifts and says, “I can’t see you die, Steve. I can’t. God, when you nearly died after the whole SHIELD thing, I thought I might never breathe again. Just thinking about it, I hyperventilate. When Natasha called and told me – about this. I don’t think I saw anything but red for days. I don’t care about some bonding gland or whatever. I’m still bonded to you. I want to try this again. Somehow, please.”
Steve leans back and slides down the wall. The problem with hating Stane is that he’s right. The factions represent a collection of mismatched puzzle pieces forced together. Without a head or a leader to figure out what goes where and how to craft the pieces to the perfect place, the Conclave will fall. Steve hangs his head as he listens to the argument.
Steve had shifted, fallen to his knees in front of Tony. He groaned, and it sent shivered through Tony, like electrical kisses to his nerve endings. It grew in intensity and he attempted to halt it, to stop the greedy need. Tony surrendered to the bond, to the pulsating of hunger within it, and he gripped their cocks, as smears of pre-come dripped down his hand. His body and soul combined into one famished insistent energy and he lost control of it. Together they worked. Tony noted the pulse of life between them, the soul bond seemed to glow and shine around them. Tony followed it, enhancing the thrill of the moment but also tightening and strengthening the bond between them. Tony gasped at the reality of the bond, as it wove around and through them. The markings along Steve’s chest and Tony’s reflected one another, images that mirrored one another and these markings burned brightly. They become less the physical beings and more the ethereal as Tony threaded the bonds together. Steve stretched out with his free hand and brought Tony to him, holding him to his shoulder as they pumped their cock together. He wept as Tony wrapped one hand around him, felt the heat of the moment as well as their souls’ etching on their chests burst with warmth and connection. It only expanded as Steve came in a great flood over their hands. He yelled out and Tony swore to heaven and back again that he felt the shock wave, that his own soul vibrated with the ecstasy and the joy, and the yearning all at once. The room around him with its bright blue stars and darker shadows of reality whited out and Tony threw his head back as he yelled out his completion. He shuddered and then Steve collapsed into him.
“I don’t know if I’m the guy to talk to about this – but all I can say is that you gotta stop. It hurts too much to get too involved. I did it once and -.” Scott stops.
Steve colors bright red and looks away. He runs a hand through his hair. “What do I need to go?” he asks without meeting her gaze.
“Let’s go,” Steve said. They couldn’t take the metro into the city because of the weapons, so they needed to get there on foot or somehow find a vehicle. They hadn’t been walking more than three minutes when they ended up near a mechanic’s shop. The rain soaked them, but it did empty out the yard of the shop. Steve pulled his shield off his shoulders. He cracked the lock with one swing and watched as a man at the woman at the corner waiting for a bus spotted them. He only shrugged, and she turned back to waiting under her umbrella. Clint hissed, and Steve opened up the gate. He handed Clint his shield and slipped into the yard. Puddles splashed as he went to the back to the yard where the cars and trucks were parked. Shoving all thoughts aside, Steve found an old pick-up truck and yanked open the door. It only took a few wires and sparks to get the thing running again. He drove it to the fence and Clint opened the gate. All the while the woman stood there, shaking her head but not interfering at all. Steve hit the latch and opened the door for the truck. Clint jumped inside, and Steve saluted to the woman as they took off down the street.
“Oh, you want to be a hero,” Tony says and pats Steve on the shoulder. “Good luck with that. I just want to get the fuck out of here.”
“Tony. For fuck’s sake, call me Tony when we’re alone. That prince stuff makes me have the heebie jeebies.”
“Everything you need is in the pod.” With that she leads him out of his private room back up to the main level of the brothel to the working pods.
“Don’t worry. He knows it’s a fake date,” Tony says. While Steve didn’t seem eager to play the part of his date at first, he conceded to it. Over the last few days, Tony hadn’t noticed any big changes in Steve, a few more questions about Tony’s general interests and his life. While they were working on the upgrade codes late into the night, Steve struck a line of questioning that struck Tony as both insightful and earnest in his interest.
“Sure did,” Howard said, and Tony detected a swell of pride in his father’s voice that deflated as he added, “Now it doesn’t matter because we don’t have the formula for the serum.”
Tony left Bruce in his laboratory. Guilt like a rotten tomato soured his tongue. He would have talked to Bruce, but it would have just been that – talking, not threading the needle and sewing the complicated knots of their souls. He needed it to be soul deep. As he walked over to the elevator, rode it, and then started down the hallway to search for Natasha in the common areas of the Tower’s residence for the Avengers, he couldn’t help but allow the soul bond energy to wash over him. He marveled at it, much like he marveled at his father’s message to him through a model of a city. The soul bonds entwining and supporting him now were second nature. The idea of Steve at the center, the nucleus slotted into place like he belonged there. Yet, maybe it wasn’t just Steve at the center and, as Tony rounded the corner to the living room, the flash hit him. Steve was the nucleus but only part of it. He might be the leader, the nucleus, but Tony – Tony was the electron in the s shell – closest to the center. Charged and ready to go.
“Well, they really don’t consider themselves part of the human worlds. With all of their mythology and their different biology-.”
It turns out that Alpha Privilege only gets them so far. Tony doesn’t admit it to Steve, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out one of the reasons it takes so long for them to leave Korea is because of the negotiations. Steve wants to warn Tony against playing the cat and mouse game with Secretary Ross, but that ship sailed ages ago and neither one of them fared well.
“Probably more than we planned.” Tony screws up his face in a disgruntled expression; a telltale sign he’s internally angry with himself for not adjusting for every scenario.
Tony smiles, and something soft and tender comes over his expression. He touches Steve’s hair. “It wasn’t three days for you. It was for us.”
When he climbed back to consciousness again, someone stood over him. He couldn’t figure out who it was. The pain blinded him. He heard whispered words of concern and the sounds solidified until he recognized the doctors’ hurried commands, and then nurses touching him and moving him. Even though the fog of pain, he knew the comfort of familiarity. The one who’d picked him up from the riverbank, the one who’d brought him away from the smoke and death of the waters stood by him, held onto him. Steve sought that one figure, that one person to stay close to him. Steve reached out, his soul aching with need and yearning, and hands clasped.
“I can’t get anything by you,” Tony says and picks up his hand, kissing the knuckles. “Now try a cherry.” He picks it up by the stem and dangles it in front of Steve. “My chef is amazingly brilliant. Try it.” Every word is ordinary, plain, but every word seduces with his tone.
“Not a lot of people know. That’s correct,” Tony says. He wipes his hands on his napkin again and easily reaches for his cup of coffee. “The first few years were the easiest in some regards because I was young and outside the spotlight. I was still in school, and I had a TBI – traumatic brain injury – and so I was able to work from my home, doing most of my studies at the Stark Mansion. I had to go in for certain things, but there were deals made and people paid generously and non-disclosures signed.”
“He was not responsible, it was I.”  A different voice, a female voice. Wanda – the chef. The interruption takes him aback and he flails mentally trying to catch up as she continues to speak. “Pietro is my brother and I should have asked for permissions. But I did not. Vision was kind enough to allow my brother to learn from him and to teach him. Pietro will not disclosure your secrets. He will sign the same forms I have.”
The Alternate Steve flickers and for a second Steve glimpses the outline of Ultron’s skull. The façade falls into place again. “You know what has to be done. He’s been playing you the entire time.” As Alternate Steve talks his uniform darkens and turns black. A familiar horrifying insignia appears on his chest to replace the star. “He made have taken down Hydra in truth, but he always wanted the power it possessed. Always. He’s just waiting for his chance. Do you wonder what else he’s hiding?”
Tony stops in the corridor, taps the glasses, and each lens becomes a haze, showing him the compromised systems. Jo-Jo’s always been thorough and the fact that Steven has recognized the utility of the AI demonstrates his comprehension of the tactical significance of the Carbonelli history.  Part of Tony’s claim to the chair happens to rest on his mother. The Carbonelli family might not have weighed heavily in the Council, but her relationship with the Elders of Shield along with the heroic actions of the Carbonelli family strengthen Tony’s position. The information Steven collected includes not only hierarchy data but also information on Tony’s worth and his businesses. It’s a strange hodge-podge. To Tony he can’t make heads or tails of what the man is focusing on, but it’s still an invasion of Tony’s private server that no servant should have access to.
Both Nat and Clint followed orders without question as Steve went to work on the three remaining Legion at the creek.  Two shot into the air and fired on him immediately. He arced the shield to deflect the fire and it ricocheted to hit one of the other Legion robots. As The last Legion robot on the ground shot at him but Steve raced at it, kicked it in the chest to disable it and then, as he tumbled to the ground, threw his shield to take out the last Legion robot.
“Why do you think you have to do it alone?” Bucky stepped up to Steve. “You always think you have to do it alone.”
“Different better?” Steve realizes he’s rigid with anticipation, shock. He doesn’t know. If this hadn’t worked, what would he have done?
“All the best security. No one can get in. I have to allow it. JARVIS is not the only defense we have,” Tony said. “The whole place would have to be undermined in order for anyone to get in and crack the defenses. We’re very safe. The tech that Ross has is decades behind this, I can tell you that.”
Tony locates the table based on Steve’s signal and instruction that it’s a booth. He slides onto the seat. Steve takes the bench seat across from him. The waitress comes over and hands them both menu until she figures out that Tony’s blind.
“Pretty well. He’s worn the glasses for well over five hours and no migraine. The resolution is fantastic according to his reports. It’s good. Very good.”
“The girl and her brother. The ones who attacked,” Steve said, licked his lips, and then finished. “The ones who attacked the train.”
Through the chaos ripping apart his brain, a serenity flows through him like the first summer day warming his soul. He leans hard into that feeling, allowing it to suffuse his consciousness, while at the same time releasing his hold on the power within him. The power doesn’t come from the serum. It never did.
When he wakes up it feels like his tongue is stuck to the roof of his mouth. He smacks his lips and groans as he rolls over. He feels like shit, and tries to remember just what happened. Images – fleeting like butterflies on the wind – flit away from him. He chases after them but they are too insubstantial to grasp. He opens his eyes but they stick like he’s been sleeping for far too long.
Instinctively, Steve knew that Tony’s inert form lay behind him. Maybe it was the soul waves or the pulse of the energy through his own neurons, but he knew, and he understood that his broken body shielded Tony against an onslaught attack by a bereaved Winter Soldier.
“Oh, sorry.” And Steve sat back and waved at the camera. Tony bit his tongue. Steve looked good. He wasn’t in that hideous spangled costume anymore, but a dark navy blue outfit with a silver star in the center of his chest. His hair style showed a more modern cut. He sported a relaxed, almost pleasant look – not haunted or angry like the last time Tony saw him over a year ago – or more. It was more. The Battle of New York took place nearly two years ago. A million years and the repercussions still ate at him.   “Good to see you, – T-. Mister Stark.”
She just shivers as a cold whip of wind hits them. He grabs hold of her elbow and steers her toward the round building in the center of the dock. It’s massive in structure and all alone. It serves as the main gate to the world as well as everything the planet has to offer.
“I was married, had kids.” Clint fell silent and then sighed. “Shit. I haven’t talked about Laura and the kids in years.”
He fumbles for his keys and thinks about Bucky, always there to help him dig them out, or retrieve one from one of his hidey holes. But Bucky and Sam are in Washington DC, living the happily ever after life. Steve never would have thought they would have made a good couple, but somehow, they found each other and the smart remarks and sharps barbs turned into long walks and dates until they could no deny it any longer. Steve is happy for them. He really is, but he misses them something fierce. He can’t begrudge them their happiness or the opportunity they received when Phil Coulson called for them to start one of the rehab centers in DC. The veteran organization that ran the rehab center had one in New York – Brooklyn Heights no less – but now the grant Coulson won allowed them to branch out and include new sites. It was a dream come true for Sam.
“Together,” Tony whispered. His heart wanted to explode out of his chest. He panted and cried out as Steve’s cock literally throbbed against his own.
“People want to help. It’s not that they all assume you can’t get by, it’s that most people have a good streak in them,” Steve says and reaches out to Tony. He clasps Tony’s hand. “Now what would you like?”
“Rogers had another seizure. It’s all over the internet,” Reed says. JARVIS plops down a holograph interface with Reed standing in what looks like his lab in the Baxter building. He doesn’t look arrogant, just contrite and a little sad. “I talked to him a little about realities. Different realities.”
“Maybe it’s the movie,” Clint says and tosses popcorn at Natasha who casually catches it with her mouth.
Steve closes his eyes and keys into the sounds. The crash is easily discerned but the smaller waves, the trickle of water, the receding ebb of the ocean subtler, quieter. Beautiful. “Yeah. That’s.”
“So you get memories from him. Does he get stuff from you?” Tony asked and rolled a stool over the glass to a clear space on the floor. He settled on it. “Like do you see him taking a shower?”
“People are loyal to you even without being paid to do it, Tony. I don’t think you get that. Pepper, Happy, myself. I would never leak your secret.”
Steve tried to force the issue but when they quizzed him about whether or not he could guarantee that he was seizure free, Steve couldn’t promise anything. While he doesn’t bring them on anymore – or at least he hasn’t since Tony told him that it was dangerous and his brain was actually taking a beating with each event, Steve doesn’t know if they will come on spontaneously like they did in the diner. He doesn’t want another incident, not one that can be plastered all over the internet. So he agreed to stay where they could monitor him while the doctors took tests and checked his vitals. It leaves him completely bored and anxious at the same time. It makes for very frustrated days.
It was then he recognized him – Bucky Barnes – weeping for Tony’s loss. Stunned, Tony sat up with his hand to his chest. For long minutes, he was glad that Barnes hadn’t been in the room when Tony found out the truth. He shivered. For the rest of the day, the horror and sorrow streaming through the bond from a distant Brother plagued him, a phantom lingering in the distance waiting to ruin him.
But it can’t be true, can it? If everything Steven has said is true – then the strong urge of an omega to bend to the will of the alpha, to want to submit, to need to submit has been exaggerated and bent. How much is natural and how much isn’t? His world tilts on its axis.
“Here take some water,” Tony says. He offers Steve the glass, and though his hands tremble, he grasps it and brings the straw to his lips. He remembers drinking before, he remembers how it washed over him like a baptismal of safety.
Tony doesn’t look up at Estane, doesn’t offer him a response. His brain races as he watches the assailants swarm Steven like a horde of hungry locusts.
He immediately thinks of Tony – he can’t help it. His life, though lonely, always centers on Tony. He denies revealing it to Ultron’s portrayal of Bucky.
“Yeah, I see you little man. That’s cool.” She led them to another section in the library, her shell beaded necklace clattering as she walked. She pointed out several selections, but one was an overlarge book about that last days of World War II. “If I recall, the lion appeared at the very end around 1945.” She handed Jarvis the heavy book that looked like what his mother called a
“Didn’t know vampires could feel motion sick,” Tony called. “Working on getting access to the perimeter boundaries at least. If you could hold it steady, I might be able to read something on my phone.”
When he stepped away from Steve, Tony glimpsed terror in his eyes. What he feared, Tony could only guess. Steve cleared his throat and straightened his shoulders as if he wanted his shield to be there on his back. “Thank you.” It was formal, it was polite, and it was not right on any level.
Late one night, Steve climbed up to the loft room in the barn to find that Tony had all the vests spread out on the floor. He had a connection to JARVIS through his phone. “Can you adjust the interface?” Steve cocked a brow at Tony, trying to quietly ask him what he was doing. He only raised a finger and then said to JARVIS. “If you adjust it to give a little jolt, a shock, that would surprise the participant-.”
Steve tightened his grasp. “You’re not the only one. I think about Bucky falling, about how he took up the shield and tried to protect me. What did he get for it? Seventy years of torture and being forced to be an assassin for Hydra. Hydra, an enemy we both fought. It was our mission.”
“To be my hands and my eyes. I need someone to help me draft the new implant and the new phase of the glasses. I have to have everything ready in less than three months.” Tony moves through the lounge, the data streaming through the glasses navigates for him and he follows. The delay is minor, and he’s learned to move in certain ways and at a certain pace not to be hindered by delays or glitches. “Drink?”
That was all Tony had said and it really had been their last truly civil words to one another. Everything else had been a moot point. Tony knew the Accords were riddled with issues and problems. In the end they would never stand. Tony and Steve may have been circling around one another about how to handle the Accords, but the truth was the Accords did not tear them apart.
“Not in the least,” Strange said and settled to sit down next to Steve at the conference table. His eyes were like gems, faceted, sharp, almost cruel in their intent. He glanced around the room as if scrutinizing them all. “None of you were set aside outside the time loop so you would not know. The world is different, so very different now.”
He let Steve’s hand slip away and the absence of it hurt. What was he doing? He wanted this, he needed this. But did he deserve it? The burn in his throat, the sting in his eyes, the rap of his shattered heart answered him.
“We don’t have a choice.” Tony hits the arc reactor and the entire armor drains into his chest plate and then into small circle of light. Steve yanks off his backpack and gives Tony his jacket.
“If it matters, I do care,” Steve says. She had offered him kindness once, when Tiberius’ father only offered cruelty. She’s part of the reason he survived. He often thinks of her fondly, but does not call up any memories of what happened when they were both tortured by Ultron.
“Don’t try and compliment me and expect me to forget the rest of the afternoon,” Tony says but the insults already fade away. Logically, Tony knows that Steve had wanted to help, but no one ever taught him how to assist someone blind. It’s a learning process, Tony recognizes that – from experience. Jarvis and Ana had to pick their way through a mind field of his self-pity and denial, his anger and his depression before they all settled into a rhythm.
“There’s more to be dealt with than your transgression, Bruce,” Natasha said. Her intensity filled the room with darkness – even with the large picture windows it filled the room like sudden storm clouds. “I need you to find out what’s happening with your human – as soon as possible.” She focused on Tony. “He probably knows more now or, if he doesn’t, we can glean what he knows from how they’ve gone after him.”
From the dark shadows to the cell, a hose was pulled from the wall. Before Steve finished shuddering, the water blasted him. The cold shot at him and tore away at his flesh. His wounds started to bleed again. The agent pointed the nozzle at his face and Steve braced himself, but the rush of water pounded at him and he gasped for breath. Water got into his mouth and nose. He battled for air as the water cascaded over him. He raised his head, looking straight up at his shackled hands only to have the hose directed at his face. He turned away as much as he could. His body instinctively tried to curl in on itself, but the bindings imprisoned him and let the water slam into his frame. The frigid liquid ate away at his resolve, poured over him, an unwanted memory freezing him in time. He quaked and begged the Almighty to stop, to save him. A long time ago, a different life time, Steve witnessed the worst of human beings in a war that ravaged the lands. It also killed off what faith and hope Steve had had at time, but he always came around, he always believed. Now as he swung on the adamantium chains and the water’s violent torrent jetted over him, his hopes dissipated, and his mind latched on to the only comfort he knew in these new and horrible times.
“What’s going on?” Bucky strolled into the room. Even when he was angry, Bucky kept a certain swagger to his step. “I’ll tell you what’s going on.” He plucked the cigarette from his lips and pulled out his match book. “I’ll tell you. That is a man in your bed. You got fucking hickeys all over your neck and chest. And you been fucking a guy or should I assume you’re the little woman in this relationship?”
After a heady weekend in Steve’s cramped studio apartment, Tony dressed and asked one more time for contact information. He straightened his tie as he looked down on Steve; he lie debauched and filthy in the too tiny bed. Tony didn't fail to notice how the marks upon his body faded away - nearly gone when they should have stayed for days and days. Somehow that hurt Tony. "Give me something. I hate trolling around looking for you."
What Strange kept saying about naming and branding and picking just felt like a mush of confusion to Steve. “What? So I just pick them out?”
“No, no.” Tony grabbed his hand and placed it right on his nipple. “It’s hot as in sexy hot. Jesus you feel so good.”
“I don’t know,” Steve mumbles but Tony can tell he’s leaning into the kisses, his words are a little slurred. “Maybe I should watch another you tube instructional video.”
She stops him before he gets to self-denigrating. “Tony, don’t talk like that about one of my favorite people in the world.”
“We train every day, Cap,” Clint said as he finished off his second sandwich. He’d re-appeared at the Tower about a week ago. He came and went a lot. No one, except maybe Natasha, knew where he went. SHIELD was gone, but he seemed to have something that took him away from the pack.
“That was like better than sex,” Tony said and then swayed forward back into Steve’s arms. He shivered against Steve.
“No. For not saying what you’re thinking in front of Pepper and Rhodey.” Strange may be an arrogant son of a bitch of a doctor but he respects Tony’s privacy and his autonomy. For all their hearts of gold, both Pepper and Rhodey are far too overprotective. Sometimes he feels as if they treat him more like a toddler than a grown man.
Steve takes several deep breaths and forces himself to go lax. His legs tremble a bit, but he manages. He releases a large breath of air and Tony pushes in. A gasp erupts out of him but then he opens and closes his eyes several times.
“Well, we can’t hang out here.” With a quick look at the windscreen again, he says, “We need to find the Passage. Any ideas from the novel?”
“What’s going on?” Tony asked, arms crossed tightly over his chest. The sting of the burns had faded but the heat of the soul mark remained.
“Seriously, that’s how you say thank you to someone who’s just offered you a place to live?” Tony went to his bar and Steve tagged along. “So you’re just going to skedaddle – see I know oldie grandpa talk, too. Forget about the pack, about your team, about those Hydra agents you invited to invade everything that’s sacred.” He cringed. Why? Why was he baiting Steve?
Tiberius pulls Steve aside as he’s about to introduce the members of the party to the accommodations of the suite.  Tiberius tries to use his height to intimidate, Steve knows the type, but they are equally matched. Instead, Stane steps into Steve’s personal space.
Tony went to the toy drawer and brought out what Steve could only describe as a large hook with a steel ball at the end. The ball looked to be about five to six inches in circumference and the straight handle of the hook was at least ten inches. “Do you know what this is?”
It occurs to him that the reason behind the government’s cover up might very well be their view of who Tony is (or was), and their decision not to let the public know they spent a great deal of money to try and find their favorite weapons’ manufacturer only to have that same man spit in their face and walk away from the weapons’ industry.
“N-no,” Steve stutters and moans. He wants Tony to move, not just hold him next to his cock. “No, God, please.”
The room smells like death, like pus and festering wounds. He glimpses the thick poison seeping from the wound and it looks like pus, like an infection. How fast could it go bad? It's only been hours.
Rhodey shifts in the chair – he’s sitting next to Tony at the computer going over the code and the core programming to restore the previous version of the software to the implant and the glasses.
“Very much so. There’s a lot of down time. A lot of time to think. Sometimes I don’t want to think or remember,” Steve said and wondered how he could lie in bed, naked and hold a man. Everything about it in his learned brain told him that he was breaking norms, but the fact was that he enjoyed the closeness. He enjoyed Tony. “Sam once asked me what I would do if I got out, stopped serving. And I couldn’t answer. I didn’t know. For me, I want to know. It’s one of the things I think that’s missing in me.”
“Sometimes it’s best to learn from the past,” Steve commented as he watched the two older men. They were deciding something – about him. How precarious his position was and what they intended to do about it would determine his future at the Corps. “The Corps are filled with good men and women. I hope I can continue.”
Everything he offered now, only emphasized his inadequacies. He kissed Steve’s knuckles and then placed his beloved’s hand back on the cool white sheets of the bed. “Why are you there. Wherever you are? Why?” Tony choked back the rest of the questions, the accusations. One of the things he learned while mourning his parents had been the tendency to get angry, to accuse the dead of leaving. But Steve wasn’t dead, yet the curling and drying of their bond scared him enough that it roiled his defensiveness. He needed to walk away, to get some fresh air.
Pepper had said that Steve was good for him, is good for him. Tony respects Pepper’s opinion. Over the years she’s been on the side of right more often than not. She knows him better than nearly everyone, but probably Rhodey. But then again, he doesn’t interact with Rhodey as often these days as he does with Pepper.
“It is when you get thirteen of the most ruthless groups together vying for power in the same place asking them to negotiate a new government, especially when the first try failed so spectacularly.” He sweeps his hand over the map and the geography changes showing the setting of the Peace Conference.
Tony only frowns but concedes. Grasping his hand, Steve tows him to the bedroom while he tells JARVIS to dim the lights Tony interrupts him, “Not all the way. I want to see you when you come inside of me.”
“Call me curious? Call me attracted? Call me someone not willing to wait any longer, someone who cannot wait any longer.”
He shook his head and didn’t want her sympathy. Not after what happened. This was his fault. He should have been able to reach Bucky even through the hazy of alpha fugue. “B-Bucky?”
“What? No, Steve, you have to keep the helmet on. I can hear you through the little microphone I installed.” Tony yanks at Steve’s hands to keep him from the latches.
It takes all of his willpower to tear away and focus on their Souls playing and nuzzling. But it’s Bucky who brings him back to face him again with a finger to his chin. “Paired.”
He slid his other thumbnail into the bloody one, carving out more skin. “I wanted to kill them.” Did she know everything? Had anyone told her what they’d done to him? “I wanted to kill them, the vampires that fed off me, when I was – when I was capture. I knew they were being forced to-forced to do those things to me.”
In the alcove under the trellis of vines they press against one another, knowing how the other feels without even voicing it. There is no physical here because they are something different from bone and flesh. As part of the soul realm, they’ve become their most elementary particles. They are light, they are photons, they are energy. Their pairing transforms them from singletons to paired; entangled and interwoven by the basics of physics and metaphysics. As Tony’s light shines through him, Steve knows he touches the very essence of the sun. He welcomes every atom and subatomic particle; they dance together in this shaded trellis in a place that has no existence.
“I know,” Tony says. “But we have the whole day to get ready for my meeting tomorrow. I think asking you to shepherd him around is just asking for trouble. He needs to learn this from me. Anyway, I’m hungry. I’m sure Jarvis has something prepared for lunch.”
The moment lost, Tony asks for iced coffee. He spends the rest of the day working with Friday and Steve on the artificial intelligence upgrades and the smart street applications. Later, when dinner is done and they are sitting in front of the fireplace, Tony relaxes with a brandy.
The backpack Tony’s slings on his shoulder is fairly pedestrian. It can’t possibly hold the armor. “You’re not bringing the armor?” Steve asks.
“Did you think it might be because you don’t show anything or anyone else to them?” Tony sat up. He didn’t take his focus off Steve. “In this dream space I think I’ve gotten to know you better than I ever have in the real world.” Tony winked at him as he glanced over Steve’s body. “Well in more ways than one, but I am trying to make a point here.”
As a vampire he’d roamed the streets looking for signs of the illegal dens so that he might get a taste of human blood rather than the cold pig’s blood in the coven fridge. He shouldn’t think about blood and food; it just made the wild hunger that grew more distracting and worse. Tony should have confessed his state to Natasha, though Thor recognized it. He’d suspected something was up with Tony’s maturity as a vampire because of the serum. From Tony’s readings and his father’s notes, the serum not only perfected Steve’s metabolism but also sped it up. That was one of the reasons Tony drank more often than other vampires.
Steve leans forward, tentatively brushing his lips against Tony’s mouth. It’s an exploration, an invitation but a tenuous one. Tony pursues the kiss with singlemindedness, pushing the envelope beyond the fragile hope into a full and brilliant acceptance. Before Tony knows what is happening, Steve’s guided them up to their feet and then he’s slipping a hand and arm under his legs and lifting him. “I want you, Tony. You’re mine.” There is a low pitched growl to his voice, an almost animalistic look to his features. He is all Steve, but there’s the ever present danger that rings through him, that surrounds him, that protects Tony.
When Tony opens the door with a wave of his ring, he finds Steven on his knees waiting for him. While it pleases Tony that Steven has taken to protocol something about it irks him as well. He snaps, “You forgot to undo your collar.”
“I know that,” Tony said – maybe a little too fast, a little too sharp. He closed his eyes for a moment and then nodded again. “I do get it. I do. It’s just.” He halted and ran a hand through his hair. The silence swallowed up the room before Tony started again. “I need you.” He looked away. “I need you to be with me, to -. I need to know we’re going to be okay. After- after all that happened, I can’t take this.” He slammed a fisted hand into his chest. “I can’t take this if you’re not at my side. I’m not ready for this. I don’t want it. I’d rather have died on that rooftop if I can’t have you.”
“We’ll manage, Steve. Don’t worry about it. Just-.” She stops and he knows she wants him to stay in his lane.
“This is interesting,” Estane says as he observes the fight. “Do you know they’re all my omegas. From my Stall. I bet you thought I came with no one, no Omega at my side. You come here with one omega, one worthless omega, and think it means anything at all.” Estane clutches Tony’s face in his big hand. “You fucking don’t know what it means to be an alpha.”
“Brucy bear, been waiting for you to wake up. What’s the word on the serum samples?” Tony says as he pours another cup of coffee in the penthouse kitchen.
Natasha studied both of them and then shrugged. “I suppose not. So then a warning. Stay out of international and national defense affairs from now on. If you’re not part of the Avengers, you really are just a private citizen.” She tilted her head and raised a brow, surely the picture of a spy assassin. “If you’re not part of the team, you’re part of the problem.”
Before Tony can even say goodbye, the connections cuts out. If this works, Tony might lose Steve forever. Steve will still remember the memories of someone else, but it will be like a movie he’s seen, slowly fading into the distance of time. Logan walks back into the living room with a massive sandwich in hand. He chews it like a cow and then chugs some beer.
Steve finds his bag and peels off the old patches, applies new ones, finishes drying, dresses in a simple tunic and drawstring pants, and then styles his hair. He needs to put on makeup but at that moment, Tony choses to knock on the door.
“These weird ass  vibes from the soul pack are the problem. And who is the other one. You know, the one that gives only like broken chords through the bond?” Tony asked as he pushed his lunch away.
Natasha stepped through the dimension, surveyed the damage he’d done, and then came directly to him. “I see you’ve transformed.”
“Obie, I’m so glad you could make it. I was sure you would be off to the fleet by now,” Tony says though his tone to Steve’s trained ear sounds strained.
They break apart and then Frigga grabs hold of Steve. “It will be painful, my boy. Hold steady, hold on. You will only see darkness and only feel pain. But if Tony is able to tear the bond that Red Skull has to all of the lost souls in the Chambers Below, then the Soul Keeper will not be able to hold you. He won’t be able to hold any of us.”
“Standard years here at an ancient 45. Good to meet you, Mer Steve.” Tony smiles with a glint in his eyes. He sticks out his hand.
He wants the man to put him on the rack, to fill him up, to plug him and force him to hold it in. Steve moans around the thick cock in his mouth and as he does he feels the weight of it shift, the size of it grow and he’s barely breathing as it expands and swells. It feels like a ball gag in his mouth, but so much more as come pumps down his throat and he teeters near falling unconscious from the lack of air. He tries to swallow but the flush of come floods down his throat. There’s nothing he can do. The knot stretches his mouth, his lips split over it. He feels the bubble of come seeping over the ball of the knot, knows it must be glistening on his lips. The alpha’s grip on his hair intensifies as the rhythm of the man picks up.
He finds himself walking toward Steve’s room on the medical floor. The doctors aren’t as anxious as they see him. It’s been days with no change. He thinks they should be bowing to him and begging his forgiveness for not getting anywhere with Steve’s prognosis. But truly they have no power over it. None of them really do. He does. He knows he does, but right now, he wants to apologize and say his piece before he finishes the project to disentangle Steve.
She watches him, her head slightly tilted to get a better view of his face since he’s bowed his head.
“Is that what happened?” Did he have some bad drugs? He hasn’t tripped on drugs in ages. “What the hell? JARVIS?”
“Let me tell you the story of how Steve and I met.” He tells it all, in excruciating detail. From the moments he woke up in a cold cave in Afghanistan to the last moments embracing a dying Blu in his arms to the ocean of stars and the tesseract effect that Steve claims to be responsible for the transformation.  By the time he finishes, his breath is spent and his sanity hangs by a thread.
By the time Steve climbs the gantry and gets to the ship, it’s the middle of the night. He must have spent more time in the Brothel than he intended. He’s hungry and tired and all he wants to do is go home and to bed. It frightens him that the thought of home brings Tony’s face to mind. He needs to apologize to Tony first. Running out on him without an explanation was wrong and he has to face the music. No one stops him from entering the ship, so Steve takes this as a good sign. The prince still welcomes him.
He’s halfway through wrapping his art supplies that he intends to leave with Bucky and Sam, when someone raps on his door. Steve stops and stands up straight, bashing his head on the beam. Cursing, he rubs at the bump and waits. They must have gotten the wrong apartment. The knock comes again. He places his sketchpad down that he had been debating bringing with him on his trip and weaves his way through the mess. Opening the door, he jerks at the sight of Doctor Strange.
“No,” Tony said as he looked down at their hands entangled. “No, we can’t. It’s hard enough to deal with our anger.”
“Or when the train was attacked and you called out,” Tony said and nodded. He pointed to Steve. “I get it. But you instigated all of that. Does that mean only you can do it?”
The first few days at the cabin end up being difficult, but Steve keeps telling himself that Tony needs time to adjust, to accept himself. Without the glasses, Tony becomes almost sullen, even angry at times. There were many days in the past that Tony didn’t use the glasses, mainly due to their detrimental effects on his health. Steve discovers that this is different, Tony’s processing something he’d never given himself to deal with in all the years since the accident. Even trying to contemplate the idea of being in denial for that long doesn’t compute with Steve, but then he’s not the one to deal with it. He shouldn’t judge.
“Another Stark, actually another Tony Stark,” Steven says as a wash of sadness overcomes him. “It’s said that his omega sacrificed his gland to free him.”
With the new tactic in mind, Steve reached out to find the identity of Clint in the pack. He needed to finish the bond. He didn’t know exactly how to repair a bond, nor did he know how to fix a bond that never really was, but he pursued its tangles. He sought them. The energy turned from cold and foreboding to hot and dangerous. It sparked and burnt within them. He could see how it seeped into Clint, how it devoured his mind. Like tentacles it slithered through Clint, consuming him as he fought to get away, but he couldn’t because the viper was inside of him, inside his being. For one bright moment, Steve understood that their souls existed not as part of them, but as their spirits trapped onto the physical plane. At this moment, Clint’s soul struggled to gain its freedom, to disembark these Earthly bindings. So Steve became the pursuer.
might be the right track. Steve knew nothing about meditation, but the documents referred to other altering and calming activities as well. It included more physical activities. Running, jogging, swimming. All of these he could do. He would need to get this under control sooner rather than later because SHIELD would not allow him on missions if he was a liability. Plus he needed to ensure that SHIELD would not intrude on Bruce’s life. That was not going to happen.
The rope jostles and Steve hangs on as the Hulk bashes it against the rocks. Steve growls and adjusts his handgrip then braces against the rock wall with his feet and shoves off. It’s enough to swing the rope free – for now. With every bit of strength and power he possesses, Steve grapples up the rope. Thankfully his burden stays quiet and doesn’t throw him off balance.
Steve mulls over what Stane wants from the prince, also the other players at the luncheon. The Syns were there, that funny little doctor – Erskine – was there for some strange reason. He recognized but didn’t talk to the Wakanda Black Panther, T’Challa, then there was Captain Marvel. She has a lot of experience with the Kree and has been invaluable with information especially about the Supreme Intelligence. Of course, Steve met Justin Hammer who totes himself as a faction leader, though Steve knows for certain that the systems under his control refuse to acknowledge his direct leadership. The Conclave is a complex system holding together with tape and glue. A sneeze could blow it apart. In some ways, Stane is right, the Conclave needs a single leader. Tony is the best candidate, but would the others accept it?
“Do you often get drunk?” Tony knows he’s treading on territory that’s questionable for an employer. The wind blows over the table, rattling the umbrella.
“How do I know it won’t happen again?” Steve shivers under his touch. “How do I know I won’t lose this, this being and become a lion again. Or something much worse.”
Sitting in the cockpit chair, Steve leans back and watches the storm. His mind turns to the problem at hand. Ultron wants to keep them pinned down. He doesn’t want them to make progress traversing his brain. The possibility occurs to him that they aren’t fighting a separate enemy but an alter ego of Tony’s. How brilliant Tony is might lead them to dance around in a virtual match of chess without end. Ultron though holds the upper hand. While Tony’s intelligent beyond anything that Steve can compare, Ultron has the internet at the tips of his virtual fingers. Doesn’t matter what super genius Tony is – there is a limit to his knowledge.
Steve squeezes him tightly. “Did I tell you that I’m all of 163 centimeters from the tip of my head to my toes and I am all wrapped around you for as long as you need.”
Steve glared at him. He concentrated on the excruciating pain at his mid-section, how it throbbed with each beat of his heart.
Tony doesn’t listen, he hurries out of the bedroom and disappears down the hallway. Steve hears him calling her, and she must stop out of pity or medical obligation. They share a whispered conversation that Steve cannot hear.
. How the hell could anyone think with that noise? Din and clatter at the same time with little defined sounds or words or anything! He flinched and closed his eyes even as they prickled with tears. The pain Steve suffered topped all of the noise, ached in Tony’s own gut. “How the hell do you handle all the noise?”
His face ashen and gray, Steve lay unmoving like a corpse in the bed. The entire pack stood only a few feet away from the metal framed bed. All the other beds in the ward were empty. Tony heard the rustling of nurses in the distance but didn’t catch sight of them at all. He saw shadows in the distance, down the long dark hallway as if someone, not part of the pack, watched. He wondered if it was Wong and Strange – but something told him it wasn’t. It was someone else.
The driver side car door opened and Rumlow stood there, his face twisted in a sneer yet his words were softer than Steve expected. “Come on, Captain. Out of the car. We’ll take care of him if you surrender without a fight.” Helicopters flew overhead, cutting the air with their blades.
“Somewhat, it isn’t as simple as it sounds, but I’m giving you the five minute version because I’m not certain I can stay awake longer than that, right now,” Steve replies.
Steve tries to refute her but the words garble and clog in his mouth as if he’s chewing on marbles. Instead a flood of vomit and blood comes out. Sam eases him to the side.
“What are you doing awake? It’s the middle of the day,” Steve said, admonishing his charge but taking Tony into his arms at the same time. He noticed that Natasha and Clint shared a quick hug and kiss. He didn’t shorten his greeting, just held Tony close and let him listen to the beat of his heart.
“Steve did this?” Tony screwed up his mouth. He knew Steve didn’t do this. Hell, Steve wouldn’t have been able to get here faster than Tony had.
“Both of you have been altered by a serum. Both of you have sought out ways to help humanity because of your alternations. The astral plane and your projections on it were similar enough for the energy waves to synchronize.”
The cold and blank face of the helmet turns to Steve. “Backpacks?” He pauses. “Ah, yes. I left them at the exit.”
Bruce searches for something, but then Pepper has his bag and shoves it in his hands. Pepper and Bruce follow him out with a call from Jarvis to take care of Tony. It’s a strange household to be sure.
“The crack was horrific. Brock Rumlow. Part of the Strike Team,” Steve answers. “Not sure you can do anything about it. He’s one of Pierce’s lackeys.”
“Anything at all. Take me for a ride, Steve. Get me out of here before they find me and the hell that’s breaking loose up there becomes my life. Show me that this was the right thing to do today,” Tony says, and his words are said with heated despair. “Give me a brief moment.” He doesn’t have to voice the rest of his thoughts, Steve already knows – a brief moment of happiness.
“I am sorry I missed the service for your loved one,” Thor said. He wore civilian clothes, a black suit with a dark maroon shirt. Mjolnir was nowhere to be seen.
“I know as much as you do with the new memories plopped in my head. And like I said I thought only kooks thought it was real.” Tony watched him for a few seconds and then pulled out his phone. “Here. Let me pull up some information for you.” He tapped on the phone and then handled it to Steve. “This is one of those conspiracy sites about it. Apparently the governments of the world have kept this pretty close to the vest.”
“Now yours,” Tony says and tugs Steve onto the bed. He explores the width of his shoulders before going to unbutton the shirt and vest. He glides his hands down to the small of Steve’s waist and there’s a little puff of air that Steve release in response. Tony goes to the buttons, the vest and shirt are taken away and he’s left with a t-shirt. “What are you trying to do to me?” He laughs a little and yanks the shirt off over Steve’s head.
They timed it just right, like he would have done as a Captain of the V-Corps. The perimeter was at least a half mile off but he spotted helicopters – a fleet of them headed toward the safe house. Just as he turned to leave the room, Tony slammed open the door and then dropped to the floor to avoid the splash of sun light from the window. Steve struck the switch again and the windows grayed out.
“I need to know where your inhaler is. Is it in your backpack?” Steve nods again. Black dots appear before his eyes and he struggles to breathe. Tony frowns. “I’m going to run down a list of where the backpack could be. You need to nod when I get to it. In the lab?” A nod. “Thank God. Okay, now by the door?” A shake. “Okay on the bench by the door?” Another shake. “Fuck. Okay. Did you fucking put it on the lab bench like I told you not to?” A nod. “Thank God. It’s close.”
