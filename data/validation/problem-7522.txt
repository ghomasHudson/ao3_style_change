“Tony–” Steve said.
“You know you like the view.” Steve smirked.
Then it clicked and Tony’s eyes went wide.
Steve locked onto Tony. He was squirming under one of the big grunts grasp. He was trying to figure out what was happening. This hasn’t happened before. They had always had the decency to come in after they had woken up.
Justin Hammer laughed. It was that thick airy laugh full of so much fakeness it made tony sick. He wasn’t expecting to get a call past two in the morning nor did he think he would be Hammer of all people. And although he’d very happily hang up on the man, it wasn’t very often that Hammer lied about safety. At least his own safety and somehow Tony’s wellbeing is now connected to Hammers.
“I’m going to take a nap.” Tony said.
“Let me finish.” Tony said. “Then I’ll request the equipment I supposedly need to make whatever the fuck they want. But in reality I’ll be making an arc reactor. I saw the blueprints in my dad's office once and this is a whole story but I have an idea and I think this should be the plan unless you have something better.”
“Jarvis always reminds me of important events. I was just a bit dazed. Being in the lab disoriented me.” Tony huffed.
“I appreciate what you said Tony.” Steve said. “Just so you know.”
“Now this is something. Steve fucking Rogers.” Ty smiled.
It hurt. His chest was on fire, but how could he say that to Steve without causing concern?
Natasha was silent. Steve saw that her body was stiff and he if didn’t know better he would’ve thought she was being defensive towards their teammates. But he saw who her eyes were tracking. A tall lanky man with smooth blonde hair. He was dressed in a clean suit and a smile was plastered on his face, showing all this teeth clearly.
“No...no...you just...never mind. I got big news.” Tony said. “I realized that it might be beneficial if we, The Avengers, had a place we could all stay at. So you know, just in case something happens we’re all close by.”
And that’s true. Although a good majority of his time is spent in his lab lots of it is purely for his team. Sure he works on R&D a lot. But those are mostly the binging nights where he stays up for days because of deadlines. But he’s 21 and his brain still wants him to have fun so he screws off work until Pepper calls him and chews him out for not doing what the stockholders want.
“I don’t think you know what I’m capable of.” Rumlow said.
“My suits are already programmed to form to my body so this isn’t that different.” Tony said.
Then admitting to the world he’s Iron Man.
But Steve wanted a medical kit for Tony. He knew about the waterboarding and the occasional hit. But Tony was hiding something from him. He could tell by the way he stops talking when Steve tries to bring up Rumlow. Steve worries that there was an injury that he couldn’t see, something that could fester with an infection.
“Rogers, breath. You need to focus.” Thor said.
“We were kidnapped. I guess that’s what you get for pestering me.”
“Weird.”
“This isn’t healthy.” Natasha said.
Steve’s cheeks heated up and he squirmed in his seat. He wanted thing just to be better with him and Tony. Sure he’s thought about it. He’s had dreams at night that left him all hot and bothered in the morning and made him avoid Tony for part of the day. But they were...lustful. And Steve didn’t follow things like that.
“Let’s moved.” Tony said.
“You’ll have to talk to Officer Coulson at five since I’ll be off for the night.” She said.
He knew that voice.
“Of course I care about the battles! I don’t want you getting hurt worse or somehow someone getting hurt because of your injury! Tony, your a mess and I just want to help.” Steve said.
He’s heard that name. He knows he has. The man was walking right for Tony. Open arms and he was talking. He was too far away to hear, but the look on Tony’s face was enough for Steve to realize that he’s no good. Tony looked pale and his shoulders were pulled back.
“Tony do you know who I am?” The man said.
“Tony said...he thought-”
“Keep it moving.” One of the grunts said pushing Steve forward.
“What did they do to you?” Steve said.
Tony turned on the faucet and started to scrub his hands together. They were calloused from the rough use.
Steve rested his hands on his hips and sighed.
Every word vibrated his lungs. He wanted to cry.
Tony looked up at Brock and smiled. It was small and forced and Tony knew there was no way it looked real. But Brock didn’t seem to notice. The grunts took Tony back to the room, shoving him in and shutting the door quickly behind him.
Natasha pushed around the fruit in her bowl. Her hand slowly moving circles as her eyes bore into Tony. A small smile formed in her face.
Ty laughed and it made Tony feel sick. How many times has he heard that laugh and waited, dreaded what came after it? Tony’s heart was in his throat. He wanted to talk. He wanted to say what has been on his mind the past four years, but he couldn’t. He’s never been good at speaking for himself in front of Ty.
“What are you doing?” Steve said.
“I wouldn’t have minded the crowds.” Steve said.
“You know I never cared who saw us.” Steve winked.
“I got you daisies and I was going to give them to you and tell you that I would buy you daisies everyday if it meant I got to be with you.” Steve said.
“Can we just talk?” Steve said.
“Nothing important.” Steve mumbled.
“Clint, with me.” Nat said.
“Just a little shop injury.” Tony said.
They entered a room with a video camera and a security monitor. They were watching them the whole time. Tony felt himself deflate. He should’ve supposed that was happening...but that changes everything.
“I don’t see how this is my problem.” Tony said.
Steve’s mouth dropped open, gapping on what to say or probably more likely on how to control what he was going to say.
“Of course I’m worried about that. But I think I should be equally concerned that he’s–“
“No can do.” Steve said.
“I’d make you a bow even if it wasn’t your birthday.” Tony said.
And called.
And he knew they would only be more concerned if they saw him. He was pale and sweating up a storm. His breathing sounds labored and he couldn’t stop himself from shaking.
“Yeah, it does.”
And called.
“Of course dear.” Brock said.
“I am trying to help you Steve. But if your going to talk to me the same way you did to Tony two weeks ago I don’t see the point.” Nat said.
The duo went off running, the direction Ty walked off towards. He wanted to follow, but Tony stumbled and Steve caught him before he hit the ground.
“You’ve gained weight because Steve made you eat.”
“I haven’t seen anyone in awhile.” Tony mumbled.
“It’s just too bad you don’t actually know what an arc reactor is capable of.” Tony said.
The man was always calling the group “them” and it bothered Tony. They were more than just nameless soldiers and he made sure that was known.
He felt something prick his neck and went limp.
“Oh...ok. There’s nothing I can do?”
He missed holding his hand.
Natasha quickly followed after him while Clint stood at the door.
“You should really be heading out.” Tony said.
Steve smiled and it was bright and warm and so different from Ty. It felt safe and loving and he wanted to hug him.
They both heard footsteps approaching. Tony felt his heart start to race and he could see Steve become rigid.
Steve was staring at the ground to nervous to look Tony in the eyes, but when no response came, he looked up. Tony was clutching at his chest, face white like a sheet.
“A stabilizer. We, well, you should’ve been learning about it in our science class. I already knew about it.” Tony said.
“Are those...daisies?” Tony said.
“Toast.”
“I don’t know.” Tony said. “Based on what I know about tranquilizers we were out around six to seven hours. Which means we can be as far as London if they took us by plane or somewhere in the Midwest if it was by car. Also possible that we are still in New York. I’ll know more once I see who took us.”
“Do you?” Steve said.
“What’s the fucking big deal?” Tony yelled.
“It doesn’t really hurt so it’s not that bad.” Tony said.
Tony’s who body was in pain. Any movement he made caused his lungs to seize and his heart to ache. He wanted nothing more to rip the arc reactor right out of his chest.
“I’m sure he does.” Tony mumbled.
“Kinda sounded like you forget his birthday actually.” Natasha said.
“You’re overreacting! Of course I didn’t tell you.” Tony said.
“Doesn’t matter.” Tony said.
Then he noticed it. Rumlow took his hand, squeezed Tony’s shoulder and then slowly moved it to the small of Tony’s back. Steve froze.
Tony stood up cradling his hand to his chest. The arc reactor heated to temperatures that at the time he didn’t account for. The bandages irritated his skin. The salve put on the burns now already soaked into the skin allowed for the gauze for rub at the wound. The doctors informed him to call for a new dressing but he’s been manhandled enough the past month and a half. He wanted to do things on his own terms.
“I learned how to take a joke.” Steve said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He didn’t teach me a lot actually. I’m a self starter.” Tony said.
“I was just saying...god I had this all planned out, you know? Before that dick showed up and ruined it all.” Steve huffed out.
Steve patted the bed he sat on. Tony took a few trembling steps and took a spot on the edge of the bed. He waited hours for Steve to get out of surgery and it was relieving to see that he’s fine. But Tony didn’t know if that was true. Because what would be fine after this?
The men’s grip only tightened and Tony hissed out a breath of pain. Steve sat stalk still as he watched it happen. He felt paralyzed. Right before the door was closing Steve made himself react.
“Well...maybe I don’t like crowds.” Tony said.
“Don’t worry. Everything should go by smoothly now. You won’t even have to worry over me when I come back.”
If Tony had to explain his life he would say it was like a puzzle. He was always trying to fit in, find his place, his people, his reason for still being alive. He always wanted perfection. He wanted that finished puzzle so he could show himself that his life makes sense. But he can’t seem to ever make sense of the world he lives in. Tony just doesn’t work into his own puzzle.
And then having to kill said man.
She walked up to him, holding her arms out. He pulled her into a hug. She was working on being more affectionate with everyone and Steve cling to her, loving her for trusting him and for caring for him.
Steve’s head snapped to the side, seeing Rumlow in the corner of the room. He was slowly walking to the center of the room where they were.
“I’m sure it’ll go over all of your guys heads but I’ll have Jarvis send a document explaining the detailed structure and how to change out the core if that must be done.” Tony said. “And I stress must because it really is an unpleasant operation all around.”
“The stuff I said about his dad-“
“He told me he really likes daisies. So this is a good idea right?” Steve said.
Tony pulled a wrapped gift out from his desk and slid it over to Clint. The man fumbled with paper, hands shaking with excitement.
He sat and listened, to see if someone was in the room with him.
“And?” Bruce said.
“So grand gesture?” Thor smiled.
“You know what I mean.” Nat said.
“You have to meet him.” Howard said.
Clint for a moment was about to mention that he said five. As in Tony was including himself in the group. But there was something in the way the man stood right now that Clint thought it was better to not. They were a team and with each passing day Tony felt more like it and he wanted to keep it that way.
Steve’s eyes were huge as the gazed over his floor. The furniture was exactly to his liking, the appliances weren’t too complicated for him and the view over the city was stunning. Something Steve could do multiple color studies of.
It was only supposed to be a little cold. So that’s what Tony will tell them when he emerges from his lab five days later. They’ll laugh and say he’s really the dramatic one and he’ll agree and he’ll remind himself that they are all just joking. But Tony wants this life more than anything. He wants friends, he wants a family. He doesn’t know how those things work so he’s learning. And maybe he won’t reach out for awhile and maybe all the jokes will hurt, but he’ll get used to this because he wants it more than anything.
Rumlow gestured for Tony to walk with him. Tony gave Steve one last look before walking in line with Rumlow.
“Not like you didn’t.” Clint said. “And not like you haven’t done worse.”
“You need to get out of the house.” Clint said.
“This would be your floor. The living room and kitchen are small because I thought we should have a communal floor so we can do stuff together. I got you a queen size bed because you might have company. I don’t know what your into. There’s also some work out equipment here in case you want to do that alone instead of going to the gym in the tower...I also added a studio to your floor. You mentioned you liked drawing so I thought you’d enjoy having a space you can dirty up.” Tony said.
“Clint. Birthday. They happen every year. His is today. He’s 21 now.” Natasha said.
The men grabbed him and he struggled. Pushing and shoving and using each bit of energy he had to get out of their grip. Tony also knew he was yelling, saying anything to get himself out but it was pointless. He was shoved under the water.
Because maybe a part of him still misses Ty.
“Tony what the fuck did you do.”
“Huh?” Tony mumbled.
“I can explain everything for you. Summer before Steve and Tony enter their junior year of high school, surprisingly Tony’s father was able to actually get him early acceptance into Boston University. Tony gladly accepts and tells Steve how excited he is. Steve seems happy for Tony but never comes up any weekend and ignores Tony when he comes home during holidays. Starts to ignore calls then out of nowhere sends a break up text.” Tony snapped. “There. Explained. Now I’m going to get into my car and email you everything you’ll need for the paper. Then, we never talk again.”
Things just can't seem to go Steve and Tony's way.
“We’re like some messed up puzzle, the moment you think it’s done, someone comes and breaks the corner.” Tony said.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest. He was a smart guy. In fact, one of the smartest in the world. He knew they left the tower oddly close to the same time Steve, Natasha and Thor did. He knew that these two wouldn’t bring him there if there wasn’t a reason. Bruce didn’t care much for public places and Clint rather they go somewhere like an arcade or laser tag. This was adding up to a skeam.
“Alright, flowers, bad idea. I should’ve thought of something more romantic.” Steve said. “Tony, I’m trying to say, I like you and I want-”
Tony wondered if he was really that readable. Wondered if he was going to have to change some of his defenses. Bruce wasn’t even a spy and he knew his plan.
Thanks for the comments! I have most of the story done so be ready for lots of updates.
He was rubbing the bridge of his nose. It would’ve been almost comical to see Steve trying to figure everything out if the situation wasn’t so serious.
They had rehearsed a script together. To add the cherry on the top of the cake.
“Everything special about you came out of a bottle.”
Something cold and heavy pushed against his thigh. He dropped his gaze to see a gun pushing into his pant leg.
“I think I would be an expert on what you look like when you think. I was your boyfriend for two years after all.” Steve said.
“This has a 67.54% chance of failure.” Jarvis said.
“I want to explain myself.” Steve said.
And this time Tony laughed. He’s walked around Death so much already, why not one more time.
“I’m a busy man Rogers. This is the only time I could spare.” Tony smiled.
And then he remembers. The pain that radiated from his chest.
“I’m saving us.” Tony said.
“Thanks...for checking up.”
“I wish I did so I could yell at your for doing this.” Steve said.
Tony wanted to call. But he didn’t feel like he had a right to. Steve has a better relationship with Howard than Tony ever would. And although Howard was getting better, it didn’t mean anything. Eighteen years of resenting his son and a few months of liking him would never add up to the years Steve and Howard shared.
He raised himself up and kissed the top of Tony’s head.
He didn’t know. But he felt like he was missing something.
Steve turned his head to look at Tony. He was still lying on his side, looking like death.
“I’m going to tell you something. It’s going to be very untony like. No quips or jabs or jokes. Nothing. Complete honesty. Ok?” Tony said.
“So know we have to look for a staircase or really any door because both ways they’ve taken me don’t have rooms that lead anywhere. So follow me. We’re taking a left at our cell.” Tony said.
“We’re making a video for your parents right now.” The man said. “Also for the other kids family but they aren’t really a concern for us.”
“Bruce, we need to alert Pepper and Happy of the situation. I would say I could carry Tony to the tower, but I don’t think the movement would be good for his heart.” Steve said. “And...by chance did you guys pack an each reactor before leaving the tower?”
“Its ok, just call them.”
It could go wrong, it was going to go wrong. But this is how trust is built.
That’s what hit the most. How long they had been gone. He knew it was longer than he was telling Steve, but he would’ve never guessed they missed the whole second half of fall semester. Their classes had been wavered luckily. But it was more than them just missing school. They had missed a significant part of their life. That would eat away at Tony for the rest of his life. Wondering what they missed by being kidnapped.
“I’m the one who asked you out.” Steve said.
“It was really advanced stuff. At least that’s what Bruce said.” Steve said. “Nat and Clint took care of him. Currently at Shield, Thor said he would watch him.”
“No...it’s all perfect.” Steve said.
And it was all teeth. He remembered how often he use to talk about Steve when he was younger. He remembered telling Ty all about him.
“They videotaped it so you’ll eventually see it.”
“He hasn’t.”
“He’ll probably wake up, but we don’t know if there will be any lasting damage to his brain.”
“Would you like me to patch you through to Captain Rogers?” Jarvis said.
Bruce closed the final cut, the air in the room was tense. Both men glaring at each other.
“Is your health in check?” Thor said.
“Well...that’s better than I thought it was going to be.” Tony said.
“I don’t let freaks like you touch me.” Ty said pushing Bruce away. “Your looking a bit green Dr. Banner. I think you should go calm down somewhere.”
“Tony-“
It was too much.
The faucet turned on.
“So that’s actually the problem. I haven’t found anything that could replace palladium in the arc reactor so currently I’m still stuck with this pace maker.” Tony said tapping his chest. “Also why it’s perfect for the bombs I’m making. You know. Long term effects in case the bombs don’t actually kill them.”
“I’m glad to hear.” Rumlow said. “I came so I could escort Tony to his first day of work. But your pleasantries are refreshing compared to Tony’s yapping mouth. Would you like to join us in the workshop today?”
“Buck told me I was overreacting, but you know once I have something in my head it’s hard to change my mind.”
“Tell me.”
“Your saying I like attention?” Tony frowned.
“Art education but-“
“I was thinking-“
“If you tell the guards that Tony Stark is in danger you can kinda get a lot of leeway actually.”
“I know.”
Tony raised his head and pushed forward. The kiss was chaste. He knew it wasn’t how they use to kiss. Full of need and heat and passion. Instead this was full of hope. It was Tony holding out a second chance and Steve welcoming it. Steve pulled back after a few seconds. He was smiling and Tony reciprocated.
Tony bit his bottom lip.
Tony swirled his spoon around. He didn’t think Steve would even remember that day. It wasn’t anything special. It was Steve’s first time meeting Dum-E and the robot was stupidly protective. But once he got Dum-E to start playing catch he fell in love with Steve. Sure Tony could throw a ball, but not like Steve. And his robot sure as hell knew that.
Tony hung up. He fell back onto his bed and looked at the ceiling. He needed sleep. He needed a new day. He needed Steve. And maybe he’ll work on that instead of thinking about that phone call.
It was vast. It was beyond his wildest dreams. It was amazing.
“And to think I was going to offer help.” Clint moaned. “You two are gross.”
“So I’m just some soldier to you? Because Rogers I think you should specifically remember me saying I’m a damn human.” Tony hissed.
“Sorry, but he seemed real focused.” Clint frowned.
“Let’s get you back to the room then. Tony will probably focus better anyways if we let him be.” Rumlow said.
Tony turned his head to Steve, glaring daggers at him. They agreed after Steve was thrown to the wall that he would stop interfering.
Therapist have said it was a form of emotional abuse, but Tony wouldn’t say that. Even if it was true. He couldn’t. Because although what he did was unforgivable he wouldn’t label it evil.
“Hey bud, were not here to fight but I sure as hell will.” Clint snapped.
“Hey! We’re at an elevator. Ok? Once we get to the top there will probably be a car somewhere and I’ll hot wire it and I’ll drive us...well somewhere to get you help. You just need to stay awake so you can get into the car.” Tony said.
“There are six of you, all below the age of thirty. You are the only one who has money to sustain living in this area. Sure, they could live in Shield but you’ve seen the rooms. People like Rogers weren’t put in mind when shaping the room. No big air ducts for Clint to feel cozy in. Natasha wouldn’t be able to modify the place to her liking. We both know Bruce wouldn’t be comfortable here. And Thor...we can’t afford fixing the place whenever he breaks something.” Fury said. “They don’t have the money. You do.”
“Joke? Do you think this is a joke to you?” Steve snapped.
“So...daisies are supposed to help mend our friendship?” Tony said.
“I think I’ll mourn a bit longer than that.” Steve said. “Tony...I lo-“
“So I turn on my computer and then wham! I’m in the wasteland. I’m carrying a Remington and killing radroaches. And no one else has this! It’s just mine?” Clint said.
The hit came. It was hard and jarring and made Tony’s ears ring. He blinked his eyes open and found himself lying on the ground and the two hulking men looming over him. Did he just pass out from that little hit?
Tony looked up and dropped his gaze again. Steve wanted to yell at him.
“You still do?” Tony said.
Pepper and Rhodey obviously came to see him. A bubble of worry but also smiles. Something he’d welcomed with open arms. He’s gotten phone calls from Clint and Bruce as well. It all made him relax more into the fact that he is safe now.
“Sorry...I’ll get us out of this Rogers. Just trust me on this.” Tony said.
“So is this patched up or are you going to bog me down with a million more questions?” Tony sighed.
“I did get your something.” Tony said.
Fluorescent lights blared up above, four gray walls and a large metal door. There was a bed pushed into a corner and a small space corner off that Tony guessed to be a possible bathroom. Nothing else was in the room except–
“Do you really mean it Tony.” Brock said.
Steve knew he would love Tony no matter what happened. If he woke up and he wasn’t...he couldn’t...it didn’t matter to Steve. But he knew Tony. If he couldn’t be himself, fly the suit and work in the lab and control the holograms and run and fight and yell and laugh just like the old days, that would kill him.
Steve followed close behind and the two grunts close on Steve’s tail. The walk was quiet and their footsteps echoed throughout the hall way. Steve cataloged each turn they made. He knew tony was doing the same. But he thought he’d at least try to be a little help if he can.
“Tony...please...do it for your Capsicle.”
Steve laughed. “There’s nothing you like more than crowds.”
“I miss him.” Steve groaned into a throw pillow on the couch.
“Sometimes it just felt like I was holding you back. We would talk for hours on the phone and I couldn’t help but think about what you could be doing if you weren’t stuck talking to me. All the friends you could be making, parties you could be going to, things you could be learning.” Steve said. “You were in college and I was still some dumb high school kid.”
“They are sending a video to our families, asking for a ransom. Or I could make them weapons. Or they could torture me. I think that’s going to happen anyways. But we’ll deal with that later. We need to make a plan. So far I think I should hold off for a couple days. Act like I’m not going to make their weapons. Then finally break and say I will. Then–“
“Thor never thought he would get sick of listening to our “midgardian stories” but if he hears the one about you playing catch with Dum-E one more time he threatened to poison you guys with some truth serum.” Bruce said.
Probably tell Tony died. But he pushed that thought away because it was game time. He had to act his life away to convince Brock Rumlow that he would make him weapons.
“I’m free tomorrow if you want someone to go with.” Tony said casually.
“You’re asking me out?” Tony said.
“Obviously all of you guys are trying to corner me and Steve so we can reconcile our differences and become all buddy buddy again.” Tony said. “Good effort. And I guess since I’m here we should talk. It’s a nice neutral area.”
“Nope.”
“So...what’d ya get me for my birthday Stark?” Clint smirked.
“Rhodey said the same thing when I told him. It’s hard to explain why. It just makes me feel...safe.” Tony said.
Steve thinks about time Tony understands him.
“I just...all of this is new to me. I’m not used to a family or really friends that much. I’ve never had a proper relationship in my life. And on top of all of that I’m the biggest talk in the media. What we have isn’t ours, its everyones and I need you to know what your getting into before it gets too serious.” Tony said.
“Genius.” Steve said. “I’ll sleep on the floor tonight.”
“Oh, I see, you two are just pining. I guess that’ll just make my experiment just the more heartbreaking.” Ty said.
“The one and only.” Tony said rubbing at his chest.
Steve paused, grabbing the bag and holding it in place. His breathing was strained. He looked over at Nat. Most days he couldn’t read her. That’s how she wanted it. But he knew it was getting easier with each day that passed in the tower. They all had walls to climb over and she was finally opening up. He knew that. And he could see in her face that it was softening.
“Whenever Jarvis reminds me.” Steve said.
“Yeah, grand gesture.” Steve said.
“So he’s going to what? Come to my tower? He won’t even get through the front door.” Tony said.
Bruce was hunched over Tony’s arm, putting in the final stitches and he wished he could disappear. The look on Steve’s face could make full grown adults cry.
Tony saw the flicker of pain in the older man's eyes. This certainly wasn’t the place for his quips. But god Tony barely remembers the last time he was kidnapped. He was feeling just as disoriented as Steve was.
“Admit to me right now that this.” She waved her hand around. “Isn’t healthy.”
“Hey now–“ Tony struggled in their grip.
“No problem.” Tony said.
Tony blinked, eyes unchanging at the statement. He rubbed at his chest
His boy- ex boyfriend knew how to hotwire cars. His vision was blurring but he could see Tony cocking his head. Steve thought he always looked like a puppy when he did that.
“It’s less than-“
He’d kept Steve up to date. Explains that Brock Rumlow was the worst person they could’ve gotten stuck with inside of Hydra. Although he wasn’t the man running the show he was the loose wheel. He would do anything to get them to do what he wanted. He’d read the emails that had been sent to his father when they first refused to work together. The descriptions on torture still vivid in Tony’s mind. In some fucked up way Tony was glad he was only being waterboarded.
“Loving?” Tony ground out. “You were anything but loving.”
Double fuck.
“How can’t I? We agreed on honesty and you on purpose left that out.” Steve said.
He stumbled over his feet, eyes only fixated on Rumlow. The duo didn’t stop walking. It felt like hours that he was staring. He was upset with Tony. They were suppose to be telling each other everything. And it seemed like they were finally talking like they used to.
“I want my bombs Tony. Someone’s life is at stake.” Rumlow said.
So Tony dug himself into his work. He built bigger and better things. He built weapons the military has never heard about. He created prosthetics that worked almost like real limbs. He started making an energy source he hoped would change the world.
“Your just upset because your not the youngest like you thought.”
“You want the detectives walking in on us sleeping together.” Tony said.
Tony leans against the workbench as Bruce fiddled with the equation on the holograph. He crossed his arms over his chest, easing his breath.
Tony looked over to see the tips of a Steve’s ears start to go red. He missed seeing that and being able to make Steve do that. It was cute on him, the pigment glowing on his light skin as he squirmed from each one of Tony’s taunts or compliments.
“I’m fine.”
“Sorry Nat.” Steve said.
“He sounded pretty confident Tony. I would be concerned.”
“Guys-”
Ty took a side step so he could look at Steve, but still be facing Tony. He didn’t realize how close they were. Ty could left his hand and touch his shoulder if he wanted. He started to scan the area they were in, the closest escape route if they needed one.
“My room here. I think we should reinforce the doors because of the Hulk but other than that it’s good.”
He had spent a week in the lab. In one more week he’d have everything ready. The outline he made for Rumlow predicted a product in three weeks so they would be working on the elimination of surprise.
“I guess that’s just another reason for me not to like him.”
Clint held the thing above his head, looking at it now like it’s a piece of artwork. He smiled, teeth and everything.
He’s dying.
“Back home?” Tony said.
“You're the one thing I have never second guessed. There has never been a moment I didn’t trust you.” Tony said. “Even after you broke my heart.”
“That way I’ll still continue to be a random nobody in your life.” Tony said.
They have a plan, but sometimes you need more than that.
Tony wanted to give him a lesson on midgardian speech some days. He found it wonderful to bring Thor to galas and parties because of his ol timely speak but from day to day it took a bit of sanity out of Tony.
“Brock Rumlow.”
He heard Bruce and Clint groan. He looked to see that Thor was staring at him wide eyed and Nat...she was watching the street.
“Yes yes. Very good soup. But still. Just soup.” Thor said. “On Asgard we do more grand gestures when we try to woo someone.”
“So dying wasn’t an option.”
“I always felt safer when you were around. I was scared when I moved to college and I got stuck in this dorm room with a stranger and my boyfriend was a couple hours away from me and my family even further. I felt like if I had that drawing up that you were there protecting me.” Tony said. “Weirdly enough my roommate wasn’t the person I needed protecting from. Rhodey’s great. But to move back to my point is that...I know I could handle this hostage situation by myself. It would probably be easier honestly. But I just feel like they can’t really hurt me because you’re here protecting me. Even if you feel like your doing nothing, Steve.”
“Hey! Hey Steve nope. We can’t do that because I can’t carry you.” Tony said. “Wow yes you are shot. Fuck. Fuck!”
“You want to make them wait?” Steve whispered.
He didn’t or wouldn’t take the bait that Nat was laying out. Talking to Steve was like pulling nails at times. It was because he grew up during the depression. It was easier to just keep everything in because why complain when nothing could be fixed? But most times Steve doesn’t realize it’s the 21st century. Being open, at least with your team...with your family was important.
He rolled over to his side, facing the wall. He still felt Steve watching him. But ignored it knowing he needed to get his energy back for tomorrow.
“Also a group shopping list would be a good idea. I’m sure you can make Jarvis a program to deal with that.” Bruce chuckled. “God, has Steve met an AI before? He’s going to lose his shit.”
Truthfully, no.
He felt like he drank a liter of vodka and took a gateway drug and ended up sleeping in the alleyway by his apartment. His body was aching all over. He groaned, lifting his body off the cold cement floor. Rubbed his hand into his eyes, blinking away the blurriness.
“That’s what friends are for.”
“Hmm?” Tony murmured into his coffee.
Steve thought about everything they said that night. It had been private and intimate. A conversation Steve had imagined multiple times. Something he never thought he’d share with the mob. But still. It wasn’t anything that could cause this response.
The lanky man smiled, all his front teeth showing. Tony didn’t risk looking at Steve, but he could sense that Steve knew how serious this was. Hydra was only the biggest mob in New York, probably the country. They had tried to become contacts with SI for years. But Howard wasn’t afraid of saying no. After all they were contracted with the US Military. It wouldn’t look good for the company associate themselves with a mob like Hydra.
“Where are we?” Steve said.
After listening to Tony’s ragged breathing for a half hour Steve stood up. He had searched the room while Tony was out for the past two hours. The room didn’t have much to it other than the bed and the spare room with the toilet and sink. He walked over to the spare room and turned the skin on, wanting to splash some water on his face.
“Clint, please.”
He knows what his voice sounds like. Scratchy, rough and broken.
He was about to snap. He’s done it before to get his team off his ass. A bit of yelling usually got him what he wanted. But he knew he couldn’t. It would be too much for his body and Jarvis would see it as an emergency and let Steve in. No way in hell would that happen.
Actually he missed sunlight.
“I wouldn’t judge my work if I were you.” Tony said.
He put his hand on Steve shoulder making Steve jerk away.
Howard seemed to snap out of his trance and look at his son with a determination Tony has never seen before. Or at least has never been directed towards him.
Steve’s opinion about how long they’ve been here differed from Tony’s. He knew that Tony was trying to stay positive for him, so he didn’t think it was as bad as it was. Steve thought they’d been here at least three weeks. And now they’ve left them in the room for two days. Only stopping in to leave food and clean water.
“No way...so how does it work?” Clint said.
“Yes, Tony. Romantically.” Steve said. “I want to do sappy stuff with you and wake up in the morning with you and kind of just live the rest of my life with you.”
Dinner was being put away and part of the team was filing into the living room to start movie night. Tony was strictly forbidden from helping with anything since he currently has a new version of an arc reactor sitting in his chest. Steve knew it hurt, he could see it all over Tony’s face. But he also knew Tony would never admit that.
“You came down here not because you care about me but because you care about how I’m going to perform in battle. Nice just brilliant actually. Your a great team leader.” Tony said. “And I thought...I don’t know what I thought actually. Funny really, I’m at a loss.”
Last, and of course he was last, was Tony. He tried his hardest to stay away from the sickness. He stayed in his lab for days just to avoid it. He only allowed Steve in to make sure he wasn’t dead. And Tony for some reason forgot to think that although Steve can’t get sick, doesn’t mean he can’t carry the virus.
Steve looked at the flowers. He knew it was corny. He knew that girls in the 40s would be all over him for doing this. He knew that Tony liked big events. He didn’t know though if this was big or if tony would even find this romantic. Steve sighed, pushing his hand through his hair.
“Hey now. I knew the moment I became your friend I was a target.” Steve said. “But that didn’t scare me because I love you.”
“No, I mean yes, but I thought it would be more than that. Because I kind of like you.” Steve said.
“I don’t like the odds.” Bruce said.
“I just thought I’d let you know I’ve been working on something pretty cool. Like it’s wicked. Do people even say wicked anymore. Forgot I said that actually. I’ve been working on the Tower and I thought why not make some room for the team? So...if you're ever in New York and want a place to stay you got a room. Well a whole floor actually. Won’t lie, it’s pretty nice. So come by maybe? You're welcomed to stay as long as you want and so yeah. That’s it. See you around.”
“Officer Hill.”
“Tonight?”
“I wouldn’t bother with Rogers.” Tony said.
“We’re not talking–“
“Dum-E misses him.” Tony said.
That tower was his home. His safety net. His security blanket.
Way less tony. The thing was black and purple and was more domed shaped. It looked the way that Clint would like a helmet to look, but he didn’t know what it was for.
If Steve could see the fear that covered Tony’s body he didn’t mention it. He let Tony storm out of the room. Nothing else said between them.
“I have recorded this conversation in case I need remind you, sir.” Jarvis said.
“I think it would be wicked if-“
“I don’t like sleeping alone.” Tony whispered.
This means Tony took it upon himself to call the museum and get them in after hours.
Clit pulled out a helmet, at least that’s what he thinks it is. He stares, a bit confused.
“Thanks?” Clint said.
But either way Tony spent the rest of the day with a smile resting on his face. It was becoming normal for him to actually be...happy.
“Hey Nat.” Tony said.
“Well, yeah. It wasn’t too hard. Natasha’s place is kinda spare though because she’s a bit hard to read. And I see her being very per-“
He was guiding Tony around the room as Steve stood by the entrance with the grunts. Rumlows hand moved to clasp around Tony’s. Steve felt his stomach twist.
“Steve, seriously everything is going to be alright.” Tony said. “Now turn off the tap of water and let’s try and get some rest before they come back.”
“Anything that can kill me I usually remember.” Steve said.
“You did all of this.” Steve said. “Everyone’s floor is specialized. For them. You did this.”
“How long?”
“Mhmmm.” Tony mumbled.
“But? There's a but, there always is.”
Silence passed over the two. Tony had so much going on in his head. He had so much he wanted to tell Steve. But it was better this way. If nothing came out before the end.
“I’m being serious Tony. I was scared that I was going to hold you back. That something would come up while you were over in Boston and you would have to pick between me and whatever that was. I wanted you to be able to do whatever you can.” Steve said. “And I know you Tony. Nine times out of ten you always picked me.”
Steve huffed and shoved the flowers into Thor’s hands.
“And how much talking do you do Nat? How open are you?” Steve ground out.
“What were you telling me before Ty got trigger happy?” Tony said.
“We did. We’re also on lock down, but the bigger concern is what happens next. You can’t stay in here-”
“Sorry, feeling a bit sick actually.” Steve mumbled.
“Ty...you should leave.” Tony said.
“Hey, what’s wrong?” Steve said.
But Steve was also busy Tony had come to learn after he almost died to palladium poisoning.
Tony knew that he knew that name. But he couldn’t think about that. Instead he’s eyes have finally focused and he saw the tank of water in the room. He knew what that meant.
“Putting it together is the part everyone likes anyways, who cares about it when it’s done?”
Steve could count on his hands the number of times he heard Tony speak like that. As if he has now power within and there was no point in his life anymore. Usually he would hold Tony, stroke his hair and tell him they would figure everything out. But that was when they were dating. When they were still friends.
There were words unspoken about being young and having no one there to guide you. About losing all your family and having nothing to rely on. Because when it really came down to it, none of the team had much of a family. But they had each other now and maybe Tony made them a home. A place where life could flourish and a family could be made.
But Clint didn’t pull away. If anything he pulled Toby closer and he couldn’t figure out why.
“Plans change.” Rumlow said.
He was escorted back to his room where he sat by the toilet feeling his stomach roll.
It wasn’t clear to Clint what he was trying to say. It was all mashed together and was choked up. But he didn’t need to know, at least not now. So instead he just rubbed small circles into Tony’s back and told him they would figure it out.
“And I’ll be your faithful housewife and make sure the room is clean each night you come home.” Steve smirked.
“You’d rather I sneak into your tower and do my experiment instead? I thought you liked attention.” Ty said.
Steve turned the faucet off and stomped over to Tony.
If his life wasn’t at risk he would’ve scoffed. A bomb and a missile are two completely different weapons. But he would say anything Brock wanted to hear.
The lanky man smiled and flicked his hand lazily. He turned to leave the room as the two hunking men grabbed Tony by his arms.
“The one and only.” Tony said.
“Woah now, Let’s keep things civil.” Bruce said about to say a hand on Ty’s shoulder.
He stood in the doorway, arms pulled across his chest, face scrunched up dramatically.
“Thanks Tony. This was...well it was thoughtful.” Clint said.
“How old did you think he was?” She said.
He pulled up his shirt to look. The reactor still sat snuggly in his sternum. It was the same model too. He knew, there was a dent on the left side where he got hit during a battle.
“Steve, after this, once we get out I want us to be friends again.” Tony said.
Steve turned off the faucet and came to sit next to Tony on the floor. Tony felt him look over his shoulder.
“So...not work related. Ok, that narrows it down.” Clint said.
They had to go to the medbay. Bruce had to take X-rays to know exactly the type of damage done to Tony’s muscles. Bruce had to stitch up the cuts. Jarvis altered the team to Tony’s condition. Steve was at the bay in minutes.
Tony was quickly walking down the sidewalk, making his way to the parking lot on campus. Both him and Steve had spent the past hour in class being corral into lab groups and being forced to figure out what they would study. Tony was pissed. He shouldn’t be in a 100 level science class. How was it possible that he’d made it so far into his bio-mechanic major without already taking the class or something equal to it? The oversight at the college was blowing his mind. And on top of it all he couldn’t believe his luck with somehow getting stuck in the same class as Steve Rogers.
“Tony that’s insane.” Steve said. “You never wanted to–“
“Hey, you Tony Stark?”
Tony didn’t leave his lad for a week after that.
“Steve...if he was actually doing something to me I would tell you.” Tony said.
“There a block away.” Clint mumbled.
Rumlow gazed over at Steve. His eyes looked dead, unfocused on him.
“I think this one is pretty neat.” Tony said.
Steve watched Rumlow. He had started to circle him. One hand was resting on his hip. The man's eyes never left Tony. There was a darkness in them. Not the odd adoring one that he had seen in the past. This was going to turn south soon.
“Hey.” Tony said.
“We’re looking for a place for them to stay.” Fury said.
“Ten minutes ago you were saying, and I quote ‘thee couple of the decade I am quaking’.” Tony said.
Ty turned and started walking away. Tony sighed and then smiled. Maybe he should be embarrassed that his ex boyfriend made a scene in front of all his friends, but it felt...good. He’s never had people stand up for him like that. Sure at times Pepper was there to talk someone off or Happy could help direct him away from conflict and Rhodey was always there to help him afterwards. But these people were here and now. It was nice.
“We have to do this now?” Tony mumbled.
“Woah, language!” Tony giggled.
It was almost a year to the date when Tony was captured. He came home with a hole in his chest and a light radiating out of it. Pepper cried, Happy held it together, Obie tired to know what happened and...Steve had called.
“He believed you?” Steve said.
“Might as well.” Tony said.
“They waterboarded me.”
He let go of Tony’s hand and started walking over to Steve. Tony had sat down at the bench, pulling things out and started looking over his schematics.
“It’s lovely to see you again Anthony.” Ty smiled.
Steve sat up when he saw Tony. He looked sheepish and tired. He hadn’t been drilled by the detectives yet. Tony didn’t want to think about that. What it would feel like to Steve to relive the moments they were in captivity.
It was only by the luck of whatever higher being was out there that they had been located in the deep forested part of New York where the populate plummeted but the health care system was still adequate. He didn’t have to drive far to find a hospital. They fixed Steve up real quick. The muscle in his leg would be healing for up to a year, but the flesh wound would be healed in two months. And Steve would be realised once he can put direct pressure on his leg.
All of them laughed. Yes, this felt good.
“Steve?” Tony said walking back into the room.
The police officer closed her notebook and took off her hat.
“Is he…”
Tony sighed. He hadn’t talked to Ty in five years and he’d prefer to keep it that way.
“You said you would come.” Bruce said. “And Clint, you said you’d make Tony go.”
“I can’t really go back to 1945.” Steve said. “Anyways...I’m hoping...that this could be my new home. And the team? They could be my new family.”
“You...you said you liked them?” Steve said.
Tony’s arms laid at his side for a moment. He didn’t want this. He didn’t want the team and he didn’t want the family and he sure as hell didn’t want Steve. But there was Clint looking for him, seeking him out, asking if he’s ok. And Tony knew that he always wanted this.
“The same as you! Your joined at the hip so I kinda assume that your both 25.” Tony said.
“Bruce.”
But maybe he didn’t mind being so open with the team. The thought was almost comforting.
“We can’t-“
Steve laughed. It was light and hopeful. Tony rubbed at his eyes.
“I was thinking about going to the museum of modern art.” Steve said over breakfast.
“He’s worse than that.” Nat said.
“I need you to just be honest with me.”
He also started drinking. And it forced him to hire Pepper Potts because he couldn’t control his own life anymore. She had her work cut out for her.
“This prison isn’t so great. Honestly, I feel like those mob bosses in GoodFellas because I can basically do what I want.” Hammer said. “But this is an issue for another day. Ty told me to send the message your way and you have to tell him I did or he’s going to get someone to rough me up. And I’m starting to think it’s a bit more of a rough up.”
“He doesn’t scare me.”
“Science isn’t really my skill set.” Steve smiled.
Tony looked up. He didn’t know the guy, but it was a frequently asked question on campus.
“Tony?” Steve mumbled.
“We can help you. We’re a team. We help each other when we need to.”
Tony took a hold of Steve’s hand and squeezed it. He took in a deep breath, his chest shaking and eyes gathering mist.
“You’re back early.” Steve said. “Tony, what did you do?
Tony was dying and Steve just sat there, hoping that his teammates could figure something out.
Tony knew he wasn’t like the others. In their own ways they were all enhanced and he was just a civilian. He was weak. He wouldn’t mix well with them off the battlefield. He would also be so defenseless to them.
“Is this a game to you boys?” Rumlow said.
“Tony, I know there is going to be hard days. Days were you don’t want to leave the lab or days were the media might bombard us or days were I just want to go to the gym and destroy punching bags. No relationship is perfect and I know ours won’t be. But I love you and I love us because of our flaws. Perfect isn’t fun, but us? We are something to be desired and no news reporter or your self esteem issue, which by the way I’m going to work on or any of my character flaws are going to stop me from loving you.” Steve said. “You got that? You showed me how to live in the 21st century, you gave me a home and you gave me a family. I’ll show you how to make this place feel like home and I’ll show you how a family functions.”
Steve felt tingles erupt throughout his body as the room he was in burst with light. He staggered around. A guiding force pulling him forward until he just decided that he’d rather sleep.
A small part of him yelled that he was going into shock so of course he wasn’t feeling any pain. But instead he just focused on holding Tony’s hand. God he loved holding his hand.
“I think I’m shot.” Steve said.
“You’ve been drinking underage. I don’t know if you deserve a present.” Tony snipped.
His eyes finally adjusted and he looked at Steve. He looked rough.
Date? He’s been in the twenty first century for three years now, he has to know what that means right? Or maybe it was just a slip of the tongue. Steve still uses slang from the 40s so anything was possible.
“We have two options here. Either someone, I don’t care who, pays me the sum I am asking for or we make Tony here build us the weapons that you, Howard, have declined to make us.” The man said.
“You like?” Rumlow said.
“Silly thing is that I don’t feel too lucky.” Tony said. “And even worse is that I got to cut this chat short. I was meeting some friends-“
“I’ve been living here on and off for a week now. You haven’t asked when I was leaving and not to be rude, but your rather blunt without meaning to. And I know that would’ve come up if you wanted me out.” Bruce said. “Then yesterday when I came here I saw you had blue prints up for Thor’s room. I kinda pieced it together.”
“Sounds about right.”
The man walked up to Tony and held his hand out, holding his chin in place and staring into his eyes. Tony felt his stomach twist.
Tony had come to the conclusion half way through the day that was why Steve left. He hadn’t even noticed the slight touched anymore. It was something he could easily block out especially now since they were so close to finishing their plan.
“He sits around in the living room all the time now.”
“So chipper earlier today. Cat got your tongue?” Rumlow said.
Tony’s eyes were wet and if Steve said anything else so sappy he knows he would be crying.
Bruce took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He looked over at Tony.
If it wasn’t for the long nights Tony spent idolizing the man, worshipping the man, loving the man, hating the man, loathing everything the man is, Tony would’ve asked to come the moment he heard Rogers was alive. Tony was all messed up inside about Steve Rogers because he couldn’t be him no matter how hard he tried. But his father had never spoken to him with so much...love in his life. And Tony, even at the age of 19 would take anything he could get from his father.
“A grand gesture!” Thor boomed.
“Steve you never held me back. You always pushed me forward.” Tony said. “If it wasn’t for you I would still be Howards little puppy, doing whatever he asks just so I can please him.”
“Tell us what we need to get for you to make a Jericho missile. But we would love if you could minimize them so they are more like bombs. That’s possible. Right?” Brock said.
“I’ve regretted each moment of my life that hasn’t been spent with you.” Steve said. “I need you to know Tony that I didn’t break up with you because I stopped loving you. I broke up with you because I was scared.”
Tony needed him, he needed to control himself. He took in a deep breath. He needed to be Captain America right now.
“I’m good.”
“He was on a show a month ago. Tony called him a “lying bastard” and shut off the television.” Thor said.
Tony wasn’t moving. Steve hung on to him, a hand resting over the reactor. The file never said what to do if they couldn’t replace it. He wished it did, he wanted to do something, anything other than hold his still body. But he knew...that there were no rules on what to do if they couldn’t replace it because that was the end. No reactor meant no beating heart.
“You just have to Steve.”
A young blonde man in a flyers uniform held hands with a young brunette in an army uniform. The pilot was in his plan, hand dropped out the window to cling to his lover. His eyes were glistening. The face of the brunette could not be seen. But there was so much life in the brunettes shoulders that Tony had no doubt that he was smiling up at the blonde, handing him as much courage as he could.
“I can help put away dinner.” Tony said.
“Sorry, working on the suit.” Tony said.
“This is amazing.” Steve said.
Tony stalled. The only people to know the details of the reactor were Pepper, Happy and Rhodey. It was a safety protocol to keep everything under the table. Such a complicated piece of machinery couldn’t just be handed out.
“Five days.”
He was pushed to the ground. Hit his shoulder hard onto the concrete. He groaned but lifted himself into a sitting position. The lanky man strides towards him, hands pulled behind his back. He smiled.
Tony cocked his head and gave Bruce the look that said “I don’t understand and I always understand. I’m a certified genius.” He couldn’t bother to tell Tony what everyone already knew. Tony saw what he wanted and it was very unlikely to get through to him when he didn’t want to know the truth.
“I thought palladium was poisonous.” Steve said.
Steve stood in the bathroom running cold water over his hands. Tony walked back into the room, the door locking behind him. He didn’t realise how much time had passed.
Tony knew he was rambling. But his nervousness would’ve been picked up by her anyways. She could read him like a book after watching him for those couple of months when he was dying.
“I’m not.” Tony said.
But he liked Bruce. He already came over regularly to the tower. And Natasha feels like a sister half the time and although she’s blunt she trusts him and he trust there. And Steve...he’d spent weeks with him before. Why would it be any different now?
“I’m just-I’m not-I.” Tony mumbled.
He walked out of the room. Looking Tony up and down. Wishing that there was someway he could help him. But knowing all he could do now was wait.
“Well, it’s a bit of a long story. Remember my heart condition?” Tony said.
“Don’t talk unless they speak to you. Ok? I’ll handle this.” Tony whispered.
“What’s going on Honey?” Maria said.
Tony laughed weakly.
His face was just millimeters apart. They’ve kissed in the past week. A lot. The both loved every moment of it.
Steve stomped into the bathroom. Tony wrote down the intensive list of items that he required along with other items that would be needed to make it look like he was actually make the bombs Brock wanted.
“Shut up.” Tony whispered.
“Jesus Steve don’t make it obvious we’re talking.” Tony hissed.
“And right now I’m going to trust that you’re telling me the truth.” Steve said.
Steve took as many missions as he could from Shield.
Steve took off towards Tony.
“They’re knocked out. But I don’t know for how long. You see that explosions wasn’t what I was hoping we’d be working with but it had to do because obviously he was going to shoot you.” Tony said.
Tony and Steve escaped, but what's left of them now?
Help? He thought. You’re currently dying.
“I’m smitten with him.” Steve said.
“Kind of looks like us.” Steve said acknowledging Tony’s fleeting tactics.
Steve was shaking. They always talked about this happening, the arc reactor failing, but it wasn’t actually a possibility. And he just got him back, spent the better of two weeks hating each other and then the week after that avoiding each other. He can’t let this happen, not when things weren’t fixed between them.
“I wouldn’t hope so. It’s an original.” Tony said.
“Hey, you should probably get some sleep.” Steve said.
“Awesome. So your room? Any other requested?” Tony said.
The younger boy was still shivering. It looked like it took everything he had to get into the bed. It made Steve’s heartbreak and his hope dissipate. Tony’s plan was flawed because Steve didn’t know how Tony could survive another day of what they did to him.
“I like you too bud. So let’s put this all behind us.” Tony said.
“Tony-“
Tony’s head popped up. He didn’t take...at least because he’s from...well this is interesting news.
The man shoved Tony out of the room and Steve was close behind. His grunt being just as rough. Their pace was quick. They didn’t give him time to look over the hallways, count the turns and doors.
Tony chuckled, laying himself down with Steve on the small hospital bed. He knew that things wouldn’t be easy after this. Possibly everything will actually be harder for the rest of their lives. But Steve wants him to be here and Tony will make sure that they’ll stay together this time. Even if it’s just friends. Tony needs to heal and he wants to do that with Steve.
Tony didn’t hear what came next. He felt immense pain radiating from his chest. He clutched at the arc reactor. It shouldn’t be doing this, he checked it this morning. His eyesight was blurring, but he saw Nat and Clint start off running. He needed to know what they were doing, if he could help.
“I get it. Why trust Justin Hammer? Crazy. But I mean it. If he comes, tell him I warned you.” Justin said.
Steve took him by the waist and lifted him onto the island in the kitchen. Tony wiggled in the grip, but didn’t make any real effort to escape.
“Hmm.”
Jokes.
Steve jerked awake. The slight pressure against his chest the whole night being removed and a rustling sound triggering his ears. He felt something grab his shoulders and yanked him from the bed. He blinked his eyes a few times, whisking away the blurriness.
“It would never. Do you know me?” Tony laughed.
Tony thought about how much time had passed since he last saw him. Three years since their falling out. Two years since Steve called him.
“He’s just turning 21? What the hell? I’ve been letting him drink with me for weeks now.” Tony said.
“Stop thinking so much.” Steve said.
Steve felt the water start to run cold against his hands and threw it against his face. There was no good plan for this situation.
“Don’t tempt me.” The man whispered in Tony’s ear.
“No...well yes. Your a bit complicated. Sometimes you really want attention. But I think you plan for that kind of stuff. Other than that, I guess you like to stay out of everyone’s sights.” Steve said.
Tony looked over to the lawyer in the room. His hands hovered over the keyboard waiting for Tony to give the ok. Who else would he give all this power to? There was no one else he trusted like Obie. No one who knew the business like that man did.
“Why’d you say all that man?” Clint whisperer.
“Do you think I like babysitting you? I have my own life. I have events I’m suppose to go to, dates with girls and shit I’m suppose to make for SI and you’re kind of holding me up.” Tony said.
“You know you’re tired.”
“You don’t know what it is, do you?” Tony said.
“Are you sure about this?”
“Let’s go.”
The call went straight to voicemail. His stomach dropped at this because his brain made him think she declined his call. Of course he knew there were other reasons why it would go straight to voicemail. He was a genius after all.
One more chapter guys!! Hope you like the cliff hanger!
Tony day down on the bed, pulling his legs up to his chest. This was what he was trying to avoid.
“Have you slept?” Tony said.
“And we’re basically home free after that. I got us out like I said I would.” Tony said
“For the report it would-“
“Don’t blame yourself. I’m a hard person to deal with. Ask anyone.” Tony said. “Just promise me that you’ll mourn me for a couple months. Make everyone eat cheeseburgers at my funeral and that you donate Jarvis to the local community college.”
Tony thought about their kiss and if it meant anything now. Although it had felt real to him he would understand if Steve didn’t want that anymore. People do so many things they normally wouldn’t when their put into situations they aren’t used to.
And that hurt. Because Steve never did anything wrong. Tony motioned for Jarvis to open up a link between the two rooms.
“I think I just need to change the reactor soon.” Tony said.
“Not bad. Thought it would be longer.”
Everything felt heavy. He wanted to lift his hands.
“So he’s touching you?” Steve said.
“At least mine are entertaining to watch.” Tony said.
Thor nodded, pushing out his hand and calling Mjlorton. A few seconds past and it slammed into his hand. He jumped into the air and watched from the sky.
“Now tell me all about your day.” Steve smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony who is this fool?” Clint said.
Steve nodded his head just as the door swung open. In came three men. Two of them were large overly muscled men obviously there to intimidate. The other man was tall and lanky. Black hair greased back, eyes a piercing blue. Skin was pale and the suit was finely pressed. But it was the ring on his right hand that tipped Tony off. Sliver band with a large letter H at the base.
“Wait.” Steve said.
“I heard that!” Bruce and Steve yelled from the kitchen.
Jokes. It was jokes. Tony reminded himself. Clint was a master at the snide remark and often came level to level with Tony on sarcasm.
Tony never found the time to respond. Not with learning how to perfect his suit and revenge Yusin and stop firearms production and focus on arc reactor energy and learn that Obie was the one who sold him out to the terrorist and get his heart pulled out of his chest by one of the few me he trust.
“I know this is hard for you. You’re so young and you were just starting to get along with Howard. Who knows what the future held for you two.” Obie said placing a hand of Tony’s shoulder. “But your parents wouldn’t want anything happening to this company they spent so long creating.”
Steve jumped up from his seat on the bed when the grunts finally came back with Tony. He was thrown into the room and rolled into himself. The grunts left without giving him a look.
Tony shifted in his seat, looking at each one of his team mates. He’s always been able to read people. The little tweaks that come out in people when they intend to hide something. Tony was an expert at studying humans so he could protect himself. Even with Natasha he could see the lines starting to soften. They looked at him in a way he wasn’t quite used to.
“Whatever the fuck your working on, I’m going to trash it and you’re going to finish the bombs I want by tonight.” Rumlow said.
“I’ll be gone for longer sessions I’m guessing. You can only torture someone for so long before they become useless. But they probably know how long I can effectively work for.” Tony said.
“Scare tactics don’t really work.” Tony mumbled.
He tried to open his eyes, but he just didn’t have the strength and he was also a tad bit scared the lights might blind him.
Nothing would bring more attention to the duo if they went to the museum of modern art in the middle of the day with that exhibit. For one Tony was well...Tony. His history of partners is long and delves into anyone and everyone. Being seventeen was not a good age for him, but really good for the media. Especially for the Bugle when they got a sex tape of Tony with a man. So if Steve Rogers was seen with Tony at this exhibit than people were going to talk and Steve didn’t need that.
“You should listen to him more. He’s usually right.” Tony said.
“I know. He’s also told me that.” Steve laughed. “I went to Boston because I knew you were there.”
“Steve.”
“Hey.” Steve said.
“Steve.”
Tony spooned the brothy liquid and smiled. Steve made it. He could tell. It was too salty and the vegetables weren’t fully cooked. He never got the recipe quite right. It was from Peggy and Tony knew exactly how Peggy made it. Somehow Steve couldn’t get it.
Tony stood up from his seat and wondered if this was the right choice.
The door creaked open and Rumlow entered with this grunts. Steve hasn’t seen Rumlow since he first woke up. He had that same snide smile as he did before.
“Come on-“
Tony melted in relief. He knew it was possibly to be shot down and he was preparing himself for it. But Clint saying yes...that was a perfect start.
“Connecting.”
“It’s a date than.” Steve said and left the room for his morning run.
But something didn’t feel right. And maybe it was what he saw up there in the wormhole or maybe it was the fact that he thought he was going to die. Tony felt all kinds of different. And he didn’t know if different meant good.
“What else is he doing to you? Huh?”
“Bruce, fuck, what-”
“He misses me?” Tony said.
“Anyways! I came to tell you that we’re ready when you guys are. So...be quick.” Clint said. “And quiet!”
The faucet turned on.
His voice was wet and pleading. Tony was dying and all he could do was plead.
They were always teaching each other, showing each other the way. It was the base on which the meet and although it was rough, Tony couldn’t be more grateful.
“How could I forget? You gave me quite a few scares.” Steve said.
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn’t actually call Thor. The guy was currently in Asgard and no one really knew how to get in contact with him. Tony had heard the guy had a thing with a girl named Jane from New Mexico. So he sent her an email hoping that she could get the message to him as soon as possible.
“Tony, your the embodiment of the future. There’s no one more perfect to show him the world.”
“I saw you and Clint setting up a prank to scare Nat. I don’t think your as busy as you say.” Steve said.
He’s suffocating.
“Alright, flowers, bad idea. I should’ve thought of something more romantic.” Steve said. “Tony, I'm trying to say, I like you and I want to take you on a date.”
Bruce knew Tony understand nano tech better than him. But he saw the pieces of metal and how they shifted and this wasn’t like his other suits. But he could never say no to Tony. There was something about the way that the man stood his ground that said that Tony has heard no enough in his life and a little encouragement would go a long way.
“God Tony I don’t want you to feel bad.” Steve said pushing his hand through his hair. “I just want you to trust me again.”
“And why should I believe you?”
“That’s a low blow-“
The two sat in silence for awhile. Steve fiddled with the sleeves of his shirt, glancing up to look at Tony.
“He will.”
Clint, Natasha, Thor and Bruce all walked around the tower with concern. What do you do when both of them are in the wrong?
“We can sit here all day and think about the should’ve could’ve would’ve. That isn’t going to help anyone.” Steve said. “We just need to heal and grow. And Tony, I want us to do it together because I can’t imagine doing this without you.”
It’s been one week. At least that was what Tony calculated based on the number of meals and rude awakenings that have happened. They didn’t match up but he guessed seven days would make the most sense. More than likely both their parents are talking to the authorities right now. Howard is refusing to pay and Maria and Sarah are freaking out at him. He’d seen Howard refuse to pay Tony for his blueprints on prosthetics for six months just because he asked for the money in cash instead of it going into his bank account. That was a small disagreement, he couldn’t even guess how long Howard could hold out on this.
“No...it kind of looks like your iron man helmet, but less...you.” Clint said.
“He’ll forgive you.”
“I’ll do it.” He mumbled.
“Cat got your tongue buddy?” Clint said.
“Your father was right about you. You’re ungrateful and I can’t believe I wasted so much time on you. Fuck you Stark.” Steve said and stormed out of the room.
“Where else would I go?” Steve whispered.
“I didn’t mean it.” Tony cling to Clint’s shirt.
He’s dying.
It was still deep enough to bleed. A lot. Cuts races around his whole wrist and Bruce had to pull the nano tech out of Tony’s wrist himself because they wouldn’t retract. If Bruce wasn’t so concerned he would’ve been fascinated at the state of Tony’s wrist. The nano tech slowly made its way into Tony’s arm by cutting thinly into the skin, little by little going deeper and deeper. Bruce had never anything like it before.
“Have you two enjoyed your time off?” Rumlow said.
“And we won’t. At least that’s the current plan.”
He needed an aspirin, or if he's guessing right he's in the medbay and they can get him morphine.
Steve cupped Tony’s face with his hands and quickly kissed him.
“Who is that.” Steve said.
“I don’t understand and that says a lot because I am a certified genius.” Tony said.
What else hasn’t Tony told him?
“Oh.”
“Fuck if I really care.”
“They’re watching us. I don’t know if they are also listening to us but just in case we should only talk when one of us is using the sink. It’ll block out our voices.” Tony said.
“No, really, I’m fine.” Tony grabbed at the pot of pasta.
“I’ll make the damn weapons.” Tony said.
“I passed with flying colors.”
There was a slight twitching to Tony’s shoulder. It was almost undetectable. But Steve was accustomed to Tony. It was necessary if you planned on knowing him at all. The man was one of slights.
“I love that you did this for us.” Steve said.
“It’s alright.”
“Jarvis informed me that you won’t be able to use that arm properly for at least two weeks.” Steve said. “What if we get called to action? We can’t afford for you to stay home.”
Everyone knows about Ty. At least to an extent. It was Tony Stark’s mysterious ex boyfriend. When Ty leaked those photos he was clever enough to block his face out of them. Tony hid in his parents house for weeks avoiding the media, trying to get the company back on even ground. But it took years to cover up what he did. And sure now the world is almost ok with Tony Stark being gay. They probably wouldn’t care if he was but since he’s Tony they find anything they can to hate.
Bruce went to speak, lifted his head to see that Nat and Clint were currently standing at the entrance of the room. Both of them shaking their heads no. He shouldn’t interfere.
“Tony.”
“I’m sure your craftsmanship is the best there is, but I would feel better if I knew what to do if...you know.” Steve said.
“He’s never going to forgive me.” Steve mumbles.
“But my father did and I will not disappoint him.” Tony said.
“I would say yes but Dum-E would just get jealous.” Tony said.
“You know...we all kind of you miss you or whatever.” Clint said.
“I don’t think it’s fun enough.” Thor said.
“I’m sorry.” Tony whispered.
“You’ve made friends? Gosh darn I’m proud of you.” Ty said.
“I’m starting to think he should’ve taught you to make explosives as well because what you’re making me isn’t what I asked for.” Rumlow said.
“For being such a good boy I’m going to let you have the rest of the day off. You can take this paper and pencil with you. Write down what we need to get for you and in two days we’ll be making magic together.” Brock said.
Tony heard Steve banging against the door. But he pushed that aside as he tried to memorize the layout of the building he was being presented to. The walls were the same cement as the cell and the ground the same gay slab. They must be in some sort of warehouse facility. Or an old abandoned factory. That helped Tony narrow down their possible whereabouts. But it was more helpful for an escape plan. If that was even feasible.
“That really sucks because I don’t want you here. Go and tell Howard you failed. I want someone else.” Steve said.
Clint groaned in pain from the quick jab Natasha gave to his ribs. Tony chuckled. He’s safe here.
Tony threw him the blanket and Steve wrapped himself in it, sitting against the wall furthest from Tony. He watched him for awhile. He watched as Tony relaxed enough to sleep. He watched as Tony started to shiver and he laid the blanket back on him. He watched until he got to tried and he also slept. Fearing the moment he woke up.
“Tiberius Stone.” Nat said.
“Stopped taking on so many missions from Shield.”
“Truthfully? No. But I have gained some weight over the past couple of months so I think I’m fine.”
“Steve.”
The call came early in the morning. The house was asleep, but the loud ringing of the emergency phone woke everyone up. Tony was out of bed, hot on the heels of his parents. Howard answered the phone, a smile spreading across his face.
Clint got closer to Tony, only a single work table sat between them. Clint saw it now, the slight tremble in Tony’s left hand. Clint whispered a quiet “oh tones” and walked around the table to hug him.
He pushed himself off the ground and scurried to the door. He tried to grab at Tony but it was no use. The door closed before he could even get a grip on the younger boys shirt.
Steve sat up and moved over to Tony. He remembered when the use to just spend time together. Him and Steve at his lab or at the movies or making dinner with Sarah. He remembered Bucky tagging along sometimes. He remembered Bucky hating him until Steve confused he loved him. Tony missed Steve more than anything.
She looked at Tony. He eyes moving over to the door that would lead to Steve’s hospital room. Her face softened.
He opened his eyes. Yes the light was blinding, he groaned.
“Please.” Steve said.
“I’ve been sleeping for the past week.” Tony said.
Tony laughed. “Oh I know. I’ve found your skills to be more...physical.”
“Thank you.” Tony said.
“I’m going to pass out.” Steve said.
“What do you think Steve?” Rumlow said.
“It’s more like a declaration of love instead of...fun?” Steve said.
“Tony is more of a man than you could ever be.” Steve said.
Tony rubbed his eyes. Tears stung his eyes and slid down his cheeks.
“Need a hand?” Clint said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve moved a bit closer to Tony, their shoulders pressed up to each other. He looked down at the list, folded it up and put it into his back pocket. It just dawned on him to wonder what he looked like. There wasn’t a mirror in the room and for good reason. Either him or Steve would’ve broken it long ago and tried to us it as a weapon. But it also made Tony aware that he probably looked worse than he felt. And that was definitely putting Steve on edge.
“Adorable.” Steve murmured.
“Just because we’re lab partners doesn’t mean we actually have to work together.” Tony said. “I figured it out. I can do all the experiments and research because I mean, obviously why wouldn’t I do that in the first place? Then you can write the paper. You’re an English major, right?”
He before he could even focus on that he was out.
Tony pulled his sunglasses out of his pocket and slipped them on. He started walking towards the way Clint gestured to. The duo followed him, quietly.
It had been a long 48 hours. He thought he was getting somewhere with upgrades to the suit, but the reactor wasn’t taking and he didn’t know why. His mind felt slow and he knew he should sleep, but lunch was in twenty minutes and he didn’t want to miss Bruce’s cooking.
“I’ve been thinking much about that arc in your chest. I’ve never seen anything like it.” Thor said.
“How did you know?” Tony mumbled.
“It’s not a little injury.” Steve said.
“Ok, Thor I need you to make sure no civilians get too close. Tony would hate if this got all over the news.” Steve said.
Clint pulled his legs to his chest, resting his head on his knees. Tony waved away his holograms and sat down on his chair. The door to the lab opened and Bruce came in holding two bowls. He passed one to Tony and the other to Clint.
Not that Tony wasn’t either. His parents had come. They paid for everything, even Steve’s bills. Got extra security for the hospital tell the both of them were given leave. He was given strict rules to come home the moment Steve was healthy. Future precautions were to be put in place.
“Not going to lie anymore?” Rumlow hissed.
“So he did call, what a good boy. Much better than you.” Ty said.
“I hope no one kissed me.”
Steve felt sick. He looked at the water pooling in his hands and started to shake. It was real. This was all too real. He wished he was back at college. At that side walk arguing with Tony about there stupid school project. They shouldn’t be here. They were both still just kids.
Brock got up and moved to the other side of the room, throwing a towel for Tony to dry himself with. Tony patted the towel over his neck, scanning the room. The grunts were still hovering over him. But they were reserved. It’s working.
Tony didn’t have much going through his head when he was sending that nuke into the wormhole. He knew that if he was going to die it would be alright. He’s Tony Stark. He’s a screw up, bad shit follows him everywhere, no one ever sticks around him, he’s bad voodoo. If he can close this wormhole and save New York than he’s done one thing right in life.
Calling Clint was weird for Tony. On the field, Clint was a machine. But his whole demeanor changed over the phone.
“Well...that was…” Tony rubbed the back of his neck.
Tony felt light. It couldn’t be true? None of it should be possible. The science doesn’t add up. Tony would know. He’d spent countless hours trying to pin it all together.
He hid in his lab. It was supposed to just be a simple cold. Everyone else rebounded quickly. After five days Steve came down demanding to see him. Tony didn’t let him in. He had Jarvis lock the doors and darken the glass. It was easier this way.
But god he did. The name made his skin crawl and the memories enveloped his head and all he could think about was the pain he brought him. Heartbreak and betrayal.
He coughed up water as he watched Brock walk across the room and kneeled in front of him. Brock took Tony’s face in his hands. The touching hadn’t stopped. It was all to add to Tony’s discomfort. He knew that. He knew he shouldn’t let it bother him. He’d had people be more grabby with him in the past. But it felt so much more vile coming from him.
His hand tapped at his side. Steve was acutely away that Rumlow had stopped walking and stood uncomfortably close to him.
Tony wanted to say this was all precautionary. Because the what if’s are huge.
“Aren’t you in prison? How are we currently talking?” Tony said.
“I’m begging Tony. I just want to make sure I didn’t do anything wrong.” Steve said.
“Nice to finally meet you.” The man said.
He did though.
And in that moment Steve felt something. It was like nothing he’s ever felt before. He looked at Tony, wide eyed and entranced by the photo. The person who introduced him into the modern  world, the person who made him a home, the person he makes time just for him. He thought that Tony was his best friend...but maybe it was more than that.
“What do you possibly mean?” Bruce said.
“That’s not-“
“That’s so hot.” Steve giggled.
“I’ll be right over.” Howard said.
“Very much sir. Tony and I appreciated it.” Steve said.
“I’ve been working on a sort of magnet. It reflects EMPs, but doesn’t affect the charge the reactor is making. It just hasn’t been a priority, but I guess it is now.”
Tony almost laughed. He didn’t. He knew that could only cause unbearable amounts of pain. The team didn’t even know he was sick.
They entered a large room. It wasn’t anything like the workshop Tony had in his house or the one he used at college. It was low in supplies and the walls were barren. There was only one workbench. Equipment was piled around the room.
Steve looked at him with a crooked smile and pale skin and a body that has lost muscle definition. But Tony felt himself melt.
His lands hit the boxing bag at a quick pass and if Nat wasn’t the woman that she is she would’ve been scared. But she knew Steve and she knew herself even better. There was no threat here.
“Just talk to me. Please. Have Jarvis set up a comm link or something.” Steve said.
“Where are they?” Tony said.
“Now, I’m tired and I don’t like sleeping alone.” Steve said.
It failed. The nanotechnology slid around and started to look like a perfectly fitting gauntlet until it reached Tony’s wrist on his left hand. It was mentioned earlier that his left arm often tenses up when he is entering the suit but the nanotechnology should be able to adjust to the slight changes in his muscles since the other armors were programmed to do so. But it seemed that Jarvis was right when he said it would fail. The tiny bits of metal cut quickly into Tony’s skin. Lucky with Bruce’s quick acting he stalled the nanotechnology before it could get fatally deep into Tony.
“So...your staying?” Tony said.
“We have two days off now.” Tony said. “They shouldn’t bother us until they come to get me to make the bombs.”
“What’d you get me than? Arrows? New game controller? No...your Tony Stark. This is got to be big.” Clint said.
“You told me you wouldn’t hurt him.” Tony said.
“I’m just training.” Steve grunted.
Because Tony deflected instead of admitting to anything. He would never tell Steve why he made everything into a joke. It was just easier to push the man away than to explain the truth.
“Would’ve liked some sort of entertainment actually.” Tony said.
“He’s waterboarding me for god sack! I think that’s something we should be more worried about.”
“Fuck.” Steve whispered.
“Thank god. For a moment on that ship I thought you still had that stick up your ass.” Tony said.
They got brought into the lab. Tony was dragged to his stool behind his workbench and demanded to sit. Steve has held in place a meter in front of Tony.
He was a few inches from Tony’s face. He looked at the old man's eyes. The dark lifeless eyes staring at him. The blue was engulfing. Suffocating. It looked in the cold still water that he was forcefully shoved under multiple times the past couple days.
“Your the only thing he talks about.” Clint moaned. “Natasha wants to slap the poor man.”
He was sitting on top of one of Tony’s work benches. His legs dangling off the edge with his head tilted up to inspect the vents. Tony had told him multiple times over the past couple weeks that he was forbidden from climbing through those ones. He was more than happy to supply the layout off all the vents so he could avoid these ones, but Clint denied with a smug smile.
“The Avengers. You know that.” Fury said.
Steve was smiling at him. Everything was going to be alright. That smile could cure cancer.
Tony turned the corner and started walking away. He let out a sigh of relief. He’d been wanting to say that for awhile.
Tony smiled. Yeah. He thought he did pretty good this time.
Steve took Tony into his arms and slowly laid down on the bed. He felt the rise and fall of Steve’s chest. The steady breathing becoming heavy. He could always tell when he was sleeping. He became a heavy weight. Tony snuggled up to him and closed his eyes. For the first time in weeks welcoming sleep.
Again he didn’t respond so Steve took a seat back on the bed, pulling his legs to his chest and resting his head on his knees. He remembered when they were younger, entering the eighth grade and Tony told him that it was possible that this could happen someday. That Steve was a target because he was Tony Stark's best friend. He never thought too much of it. He loved Tony and it didn’t make sense to worry over maybes. And they weren’t even friends anymore and it’s happening. In some future where they survive this it could be funny.
“I made the soup. The soup! I thought that was going to get him.” Steve said.
He didn’t knock on the door, instead letting himself into the hospital room. He’d watch Bucky and Sarah leave a half hour ago. Watched as Rhodey gave him a quick visit and a few unfamiliar faces walk through the door. He’s a popular man.
Steve felt himself grinning at Tony. Then came the all too familiar tapping of shoes on cement. Steve moved quickly away from Tony, sitting down on the bed, back straight up. Tony stood from his spot, body rigid.
Tony everted his eyes.
“Then we don’t have to coordinate time together. Because I know how hard it is for you to make time for people.” Tony said.
“I should’ve-“
“It’s in the lab? So you made it? New bow? I needed one for awhile-“
“What was that?” Brock said.
“You, taking all these missions. You, avoiding Tony. You spending all your time in your personal gym. You, not talking to any of us.” Nat said.
“No way! Tony Stark is asking me to live in his tower! How big is the room? Does take out go to the tower? Is there anywhere I can practice my archery?” Clint said.
Something grabbed his hand as his ears rang. Soon he was running. He felt out of place. Not knowing what was going on.
The line started to break. He was through the wormhole. He was in space.
Because he saw all those folders on Fury’s desk when he talked to him about the Avengers Enessative. Who else would be more worthy of this than Steve Rogers.
“Your parents were murdered Tony. You might be next and although we have Happy looking after you and Rhodey seems to be by your side when you need him most, it could still happen.” Obie said. “We have to have a successor in place.”
Tony sighed. Steve weakly moved his body into a sitting position. His eyes were straining and his face was pinched. He didn’t have any visible marking of an injury. At least there was that.
Tony took in a deep breath and slowly released it. He looked at Steve’s eyes. The soft blue that reminded him of summer sky’s between the hours of five and six. They were fresh, clear and welcoming. Beckoning him to open up and be himself. It was a different blue than Brocks. It was a blue that Tony thought he was falling in love with again.
“Well just look where that got us.” Tony mumbled.
“Captain Rogers?” Tony whispered.
Tony’s head slowly raised up, a pinched smile on his face. He put down the soldering iron, body stiff from the position he’d definitely been in for hours. His beard wasn’t trimmed and his hair was greasy. There were dark bags under his eyes and cloths so rumbled it looks like he’s never changed.
Tony felt himself start to shake and a lump start to form in his throat. Steve had looked like death in the car. He thought he’d die before he could get help. He should’ve been better. Done better.
“Are you going to wake up this time?”
He also didn’t dare to tell Steve. He couldn’t even imagine how Steve would react to it.
Steve turned off the faucet and stood by the skin for a moment. That wasn’t a lie. He could never lie to Tony.
“So tell me what the plan is. Maybe we can find an agreement without my parents.”
“I’m pretty sure Howard already told you Stark Industries doesn’t association with Hydra.” Tony said.
“You’ll be amazed at how fast I can work when I’m determined.”
“So...shawarma?”
“Yeah but do you need it now? For god sacks I don’t see you harassing Rogers.” Tony said.
“This is so fucking cool.” Clint yelled, pulling Tony into a hug.
He felt Tony tug him along the hallway. The lights overhead blaring down on him and the walls moving and sloshing in his vision. He only thanked whatever god was out there that he wasn’t in pain.
“Dad likes you Obie. He’d want you in charge if something happened to me.” Tony said.
“I’ll...be going then.”
Clint laughed, rubbing the back of his neck.
They were supposed to be looking at pictures shoot on .33 cameras that are incredibly graining but still beautiful in quality. That tell stories people weren’t supposed to know. But instead here they stand in these empty halls looking at each other like they were openbooks and Tony wanted to shrink. He’s never felt so broadcasted before. Not even when he learned that Tiberise had made several sex tapes and sold them all the separate media circuits.
“I’m a loving ex boyfriend.” Ty said.
Steve turned back to the sink, filling his hands with water and throwing it on his face.
“I can have more than one.” Steve said.
“Fuck break my arm while you’re at it.” Tony said.
“I’m being serious. If it was bad I would tell you. I know you don’t think that, but it’s true.” Tony said.
Tony had never seen him so angry. Not when they had their fight three weeks ago and not when they were so young and Tony had to mentor him about the modern world. His eyebrows were furrowed and his shoulders were stiff, he looked like he wanted to grab Ty and do who knows what. Tony’s chest fluttered with what he would say is love. He hasn’t felt it often and usually only for Pepper, Rhodey or Happy. But Tony guessed...that these people are also his family now. And it was ok to feel love for them and feel loved when they do stuff for him.
“Yeah yeah. I’ll try and remember.”
“He shot me with an EMP of some sort.” Tony mumbled.
“I wish were talked about this. I could’ve changed you mind.” Tony said.
He thought Steve had stopped following him a while ago. After all he was basically running at this point. He felt Steve grab his shoulder and Tony jerked away from the touch.
“I guess I’ll just sit here and watch you do all the work.” Tony sighed.
A moment flicked in Steve’s eyes. Tony didn’t know what it was, but it was quickly replaced with anger.
He moved over to Tony, laying a hand on the man's shoulder. Tony jerked back, turning away from Steve.
“Tony.” Steve whispered.
Steve shoved his hands into his pockets. A large smile gracing his face.
“I’m actually trying to help you.”
He didn’t see it coming. He wasn’t good at physical affection. He could feel the casing of the arc reactor sitting flush with Clint’s chest. This was wrong. He shouldn’t be allowing this. The thing in his chest is his issue. They shouldn’t have to touch it or really even see it. Sure as hell won’t talk about it.
