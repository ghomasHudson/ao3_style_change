The man behind the counter laughs before he holds out his hand. “Sam,” he says with an easy smile. “What do you want done?”
“Of course I do,” Tony says. “I don’t—I wouldn’t get rid of him. Ever. That’s not who I am. I thought you knew that, even given the way I was, I—”
“Interesting,” the man says as Tony grits his teeth and tries not to show a reaction. “You’ll break. Eventually.”
Steve lines himself up against Tony’s hole, dragging the head of his cock teasingly against it and laughing when Tony kicks him with his heel. “Rude,” Steve says as he pushes inside, watching as Tony’s eyes flutter shut, his eyelashes brushing against his flushed cheeks. As much as Steve wants to bend Tony in half and fuck him until he’s screaming, there’s something about slowly sliding inside Tony that’s making his entire body ache. Knowing that, as far as Tony’s body is concerned, this is the first time Tony’s ever taken a cock is making Steve want to stretch this out for as long as possible, to watch Tony take every single inch of him like it’s the first time all over again.
“Good,” Tony slurs, exhaustion coming over him, and he feels his body sinking into the bed. “Steve?” he says, jerking himself awake.
Tony unconsciously runs his left hand along the scars he still has on his right arm from the gauntlet, and notices the way Steve’s eyes follow his movements. “I knew you were next door,” he says quietly. “I just—I didn’t know what to say to you.”
“Yes, I’m well known for agreeing with you when I don’t have to,” Tony says. He shifts on the couch until he’s sitting next to Steve, one hand resting between Steve’s shoulder blades. “Steve, we can change the shoot if you don’t like it. Just say the word and we’ll re-do it, get this one pulled.”
“I’ll nap on the plane,” he says, taking the mug from Steve. “I’ll be fully conscious for Peg, don’t worry.”
Lowering his head, Steve catches Tony’s mouth in a quick kiss before he brushes their noses together. “Sure,” he says quietly, blinking against the water running over his face.
Tony shifts as he feels his cock reacting to the feel of Steve’s warm hands on his skin. “What, uh, what did you mean?”
Steve’s already exhausted at the thought of it. He sits back and watches the city pass him by, wondering how the hell he ended up in this position.
“Don’t talk about yourself like that,” Steve says, draining the wine from his own glass before putting it down. He grabs Tony’s hands, squeezing once before letting go. “Tony—”
Steve’s attention is caught by someone yelling over at him, and he rolls his eyes, waving a hand in the air before he looks back at Tony. “Apparently I’m behind schedule,” he says. “But I—if I’m presuming, could I come over tonight?”
It doesn’t take long before Tony’s coming, his hips jerking, and a strangled groan slipping from his mouth as Steve swallows it all down. Pulling off, Steve wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and looks at Tony. There’s sweat pooling in the dip of his throat, his chest rising and falling with every breath, and Steve surges up to kiss him, covering his body with his own.
“You don’t have to be him if you don’t want,” Tony says, taking Steve’s hand and squeezing. “We saved the world again, I think that gives you permission to retire. Figure out what you want to do.”
The grip in his hair goes, and then he feels Steve gently wiping his face with his hand, followed by what feels like a tissue. “Okay,” Steve says, pressing a thumb against Tony’s bottom lip for a moment. “You’re good.”
Steve takes in the hunch of Tony’s shoulders, the exhaustion etched in his muscles, and he makes up his mind. “You’re really going to make me do this?”
There’s a low hum of music as Tony walks into the shop with his idea stuffed in his pocket. He’s a little nervous, but Natasha told him this was the best studio she’s been to and, well, if he’s going to get a needle jabbed into his skin, he wants it to be from the best. The flash sheets on the wall are certainly impressive, and he does trust Natasha, he’s just never been in this situation before.
“Then we’ll find out more,” Tony says easily. “We can even go back to where your Ma came from, if you want.”
“I don’t mind,” Steve says, smiling at Dum-E before throwing the ball again. He feels Tony’s eyes on him and he shrugs. “Gives me something to do.”
“The words that come out of your mouth,” Tony says. “Moms everywhere would have conniptions if they knew.”
“I don’t want to let you go,” Tony says quietly. Some of the fuzziness in his brain is clearing up, and he hates how weak he sounds. How clingy. Steve always says he loves Tony like this, but. Well. Tony doesn’t want to know if today’s the day he’s tired of it.
Taking the praise happily, Tony pulls off for a moment before he gets back to work, the weight of Steve’s cock in his mouth making his own cock impossibly hard. Ignoring the pressure in his pants, he swallows Steve down and concentrates on finding all the ways to make Steve fall apart. Tony quickly picks up on the fact Steve’s got a sensitive spot on the underside of his cock that makes him squirm when Tony presses his tongue against it, and he gets a drawn out noise from Steve when he lightly trails a finger along his balls that makes Tony proud.
“I’m Katie,” she says with a smile. “He was born with a heart defect,” she says, nodding towards her son as she wraps her arms around herself. “He’ll be fine, but no one ever prepares you for your kid having to have operations before he can hold his head up.”
That’s the last thing he manages to get out before Steve’s kissing him under the moonlight. The heat of Steve’s mouth is a stark contrast with the coolness of the water surrounding them, and Tony tightens his legs around Steve’s waist, wishing he could get closer. Steve nips at his bottom lip as he breaks the kiss, and Tony rests his forehead against Steve’s, closing his eyes.
Steve’s got Tony’s legs hooked up over his shoulders as he fucks him, trying to get deeper with every thrust, wanting to make sure Tony remembers this when he’s older again. He needs Tony to remember this, for Steve to be the one Tony thinks of when he remembers being fucked for the first time, and Steve’s only slightly ashamed of that. If he could overwrite all of Tony’s previous partners, he would. Steve doesn’t know what that makes him, but right now, with Tony taking his cock like he was made for it, he doesn’t care.
Steve laughs, stepping forward and resting his arms on Tony’s shoulders, leaning down and resting their foreheads together. “Stay,” he says. “Let me look after that tattoo.”
“How young?” Steve asks, lifting his arm up as Tony curls in against him, soaking in the comfort that having Tony near him gives.
“Yeah,” Steve says, reaching and tugging the goggles out of Tony’s hair, laying them on the counter. “Obvious.”
“Appreciate it,” Tony says, a weight lifting from his shoulders. “Really.” He taps his fingers against the counter. “Okay, so, who will have the honour of stabbing me with a needle?”
“Because—” Tony pauses, all the excuses running through his mind. It’s been too long, they don’t know each other anymore, Tony’s barely set up his life here, Steve’s still carrying around the hurt from before, Tony’s still working on his recovery, and they’re good reasons. All of them. They make sense, and Tony knows why he should listen to them, why he should be wary of jumping into this, but—.
“Yeah,” Steve says, cutting off Tony’s awkward ramblings. “Yes. I mean I always—” He stops, trying to find the words for what he wants to say. “I loved Peggy, I did, but I—”
“I want to shower,” Steve says. “After that, I feel—” he breaks off and shrugs. “Like they’re on me.”
So Steve’s left to find ways to occupy his days, and there’s only so many times he can visit the gym to test new equipment for Tony. There’s things he wants to catch up on, but movies are a little less interesting without Tony by his side making comments, and he’s too restless to sit and read a book. JARVIS makes a comment about his pacing wearing a hole in the carpet and Steve laughs, realising he’s being ridiculous. Taking it as a hint to burn off some energy, Steve grabs a jacket and heads out of the tower.
“Yeah,” Steve says as he slides off the couch, joining Tony on the floor. “You’ve been so good for me,” he continues, fumbling with the waistband to Tony’s sweatpants, not even bothering to push them down, just shoving his hand inside. “So good.”
“You’re not gonna be able to sit down for days, Tony,” Steve says, his rhythm not even stuttering as he continues fucking him. “You’re going to be feeling me for so long after this.”
Tony groans at the movement, Steve’s cock still buried inside him, and he rubs his face with one hand, wiping the tears and drool off his skin. “Fuck,” he says, leaning back against Steve, taking comfort from the length of Steve’s body behind him, Steve’s cock still nestled inside him.
Steve can’t risk Bucky catching the shield and managing to keep it, so he switches to hand to hand instead. Bucky’s goddamn fast, evenly matched with Steve, and if it weren’t for Tony distracting him with blasts, Steve’s not sure he’d be holding his own. He sees Clint out of the corner of his eye aiming for Bucky, and Steve ducks, but so does Bucky and the arrow misses him entirely.
Steve hasn’t said a word since Tony took his shirt off, his head tilted as he looks at Tony’s skin, and the longer the silence goes on, the more Tony wants to pull his shirt back on and leave.
“Just wanted you to know that me not wanting to push you to get this finished in one session isn’t to do with you,” Steve says, peeling back the stencil. “It’s personal.”
“You can afford to fix it,” Steve says, meeting Tony’s gaze, the corners of his mouth turning up in a smile.
Tony shakes his head and takes the pills, dry swallowing them. Making a face, he points at the cabinet next to the mirror. “If you really want to help, there’s a med kit in there.” He watches as Steve follows his directions, pulling down a bag that Tony knows is stuffed with creams and bandages and dressings. Tony’s patched himself up more often than he cares to think about, and he doesn’t really know what to think about the fact he’s going to let Steve do it.
“It is when he doesn’t want you,” Tony says, finding it hard to get the words out. Rubbing a hand over his face, Tony shakes his head and sighs. “I’ve embarrassed myself enough, I think you should go.”
“Good,” Steve says, resting one hand at the base of Tony’s spine, holding him still. “God, Tony, you look so good like this,” he says, running his other hand over Tony’s ass. “Just waiting for me.”
“I’m meant to be here figuring out what to do next,” Steve says. “But I don’t know what that is. I don’t know what I want.”
The next morning, Steve gets woken up by Tony’s hand in his face, poking his nose, and he bats it away. “S’rude,” he mutters against the pillow. “Nicer ways to wake me up.”
Still, there’s a question on his mind that’s making him feel like a teenager, which he hates, but it’s nagging at him to the point where he needs an answer if he and Steve are going to do whatever it is they're doing. Tony’s not even sure he knows what they’re doing, if maybe one kiss is too soon to start putting labels and definitions on things.
The door opens slowly, and Steve sticks his head in like he’s not sure if Tony meant it. “Jesus, Tony,” he says when he looks at Tony’s chest, quickly walking in, the door closing behind him. “Have you—is there some cream I could—”
“Hydra,” Tony says abruptly, interrupting Steve’s thoughts. “We—you have no idea how much I’d rather do whatever it is that’s got your face looking like that, but—”
“Slut,” Steve says with a grin before tracing a drop of sweat running down Tony’s face with his tongue.
It doesn’t take much to distract the robot long enough for Tony to get a good hit in, and it falls to the ground, taking another several trees with it that has Tony muttering under his breath about the cost of horticulture. Steve can’t help but laugh, and he’s about to call for them all to wrap it up when he suddenly hears Natasha yell out in pain over the comms.
Steve’s grip tightens a little, and Tony smiles to himself as Steve pulls him even closer, one hand cupping the back of Tony’s head. “Hey,” Steve says. “Look at me.”
Tony huffs and rubs a hand over his hair. “Yeah, you’re probably right,” he says. “But, hey, dinner? Tomorrow evening?”
“I shouldn’t really be showing you this without an NDA, but Natasha trusts you all here, so—” Tony shrugs his jacket off and lays it on the chair before he grips the bottom of his t-shirt. “Long story short, when I was kidnapped, I—it wasn’t pretty, and I had to do something to stay alive. I understand if you don’t want to tattoo me after seeing it, but—”
Steve looks at Tony and finds there’s a set to Tony’s jaw Steve’s never seen before, a steely determination in his eyes. “You really believe that?” Steve asks quietly.
“I can understand that,” Steve says. “I didn’t know you’d be here, if that helps. When I saw you on the balcony I thought—” he pauses and shakes his head. “It’s stupid.”
“So,” Steve says when he breaks the kiss, one of his hands curving around Tony’s hip gently to avoid the bruises. “Here’s the plan. You’re going to call off the press conference, we’re going to get some food, and you can tell me about your mom. If you want.”
“Thank you super soldier appetite,” Tony says with a roll of his eyes. “I mean. You’ve done Christmas before, right? A real Christmas.”
“Is everyone—” Steve cuts himself off and backs away enough to meet Tony’s eyes, his hands resting on Tony’s hips. “I can’t see them like this.”
The thing Steve has always appreciated about New York is how easy it is to get lost in the crowd. There’s a few people who look at him curiously, a couple nods of recognition, but for the most part people leave him alone now. Even the paparazzi got bored once they realised Steve really didn’t do anything worth reporting on, he can’t imagine that photos of him walking the streets with Starbucks in his hand are worth much money after the first thirty.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, one hand coming up and cupping the back of Steve’s head. “Hey, let's get you upstairs.”
Eyeing the security, Steve walks through the scanner, a flood of relief flowing through him when he passes. Pierce doesn’t take his eyes off him and Steve raises an eyebrow. “Something to say?”
“No sweet talk, huh? I see how it is.” Stripping his jacket off, he hangs it up on the peg he noticed earlier, before he takes his top off. Steve points at where Tony can leave it, and Tony nods in acknowledgement, dropping it on the chair in the corner. Standing there Tony’s keenly aware of the fact he’s shirtless in front of Steve again. And his nipples. He’s more aware of his nipples than he’s ever been before in his life.
Steve huffs out a laugh and looks at Tony. “I think at the very least I should figure out if I want to be Captain America anymore.”
Tony shakes his head before he finishes his coffee, putting the mug on the ground. “Enough reminiscing,” he says, getting up. “Gifts.”
Steve nods. “If they ask me to do something I won’t do, my cover gets blown and everyone I know is in danger.”
“Quick question,” Tony says. “What do you think the possibility of Hydra having a super soldier of their own is?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve interrupts. “Tony, I know that’s not who you are, please don’t think that I—” Steve pauses and shakes his head, a sad smile on his face. “You know, when I found you, that time in the bathroom, I’d never been so scared in my entire life.”
Not that Tony makes a habit of associating with kidnappers, but he’s painfully aware he’s glad handed with some unsavoury characters in the past.
Steve smiles and uses his other hand to pull him close, firmly resting on Tony’s waist. “Hi,” he says when they’re face to face. “Not as bad as you thought?”
“How long will it take?” Tony asks, glancing back at the stencil. “Not that I’m in a rush, but this is... big.”
“It’s frustrating,” Tony says, rubbing his eyes before he straightens up. “They’re all ‘how do you know Thor’s not going to try and invade like his brother did?’ I don’t know, Senator, maybe because he helped save the world at least twice that we know of? Which is a damn sight more times than you’ve ever done? Asshole. Bet he’s Hydra.”
“You always were your best in here,” Steve says, still looking around. “I used to love—is that DUM-E?”
“They’re not our kids,” Steve says. “And they were fine. Clint left on a mission with SHIELD, Bruce has been in his lab, and Natasha isn’t comfortable with the idea of Bucky coming here if we find him.”
,” Steve groans, not entirely sure where he wants to put his hands first, but quickly settling on grabbing Tony’s ass, his fingers massaging the soft skin as he meets Tony’s mouth in a desperate kiss. It’s different without Tony’s facial hair, and Steve slides a hand up Tony’s back until he can cup the back of his head, holding him in place as Steve takes his fill. The noises Tony’s making go straight to Steve’s cock, and he stands up while still holding onto Tony, smiling into the kiss when Tony instinctively wraps his legs around Steve’s hips.
Tony pulls off and wraps his hand around Steve’s cock, not dropping his gaze as he works him. “Do it,” he says, running his tongue along the underside of Steve’s shaft. “You already put a permanent mark on me, I want more.”
“I wasn’t sure at first, but you were there every morning, and I just—I knew,” Steve says with a shrug. “Look, I can go if you really want me to, but I—it seemed like an opportunity.”
“Not like I’m much of a role model,” Tony says with a shrug. “You deserve to make your own choices. Actually, if you want to leave then—”
“Of course we’re not,” Tony says, hands gripping Steve’s shoulders. “Tried it once, not that great. But you could kiss me a little.”
Steve waits until she’s out of view before he rubs a hand over his face and ducks back into his room. Tugging on a sweater, Steve wonders what he’s doing before shaking his head and heading to the kitchen on the communal floor. It’s a large room, bright and airy, with every kitchen gadget known to man and, knowing Tony, probably ones that aren’t. There’s a heavy wooden table for them all to sit at that Steve happens to know Tony’s reinforced to stand up to Steve and Thor’s strength, and that’s where he finds Tony. There’s a mug in front of him with some holographic blueprints in the air, and for a moment Steve just stands there and watches the way Tony’s hands move as he works.
“I don’t want you to think that—” Steve breaks off and looks down at where their hands are intertwined for a moment before looking back up and meeting Tony’s soft gaze. “You know, SHIELD gave me all kinds of pamphlets, but there isn’t one for this. There’s nothing that tells me what to do when I wake up and think I can still smell my mom’s cooking. There’s nothing that tells me how to cope when I wake up freezing from a nightmare about being back under the ice. I can’t wave a wand and have any of this vanish, no one can.”
There’s the rustle of Steve’s pants being pushed down, the familiar sound of the lube being flicked open, then Tony’s being hauled up on his knees. He goes with it willingly, and finally there’s the slow drag of Steve’s cock against his ass. Any other day, Tony would push Steve on his back and take what he needs, but today he doesn’t want to do that. His head is swimming happily in the realm of submission, and all he wants is for Steve to take care of him in the way that only Steve can.
“That’s either brave or stupid, and I’m not sure which one. Kind of leaning towards stupid, though.”
It’s like a never ending pleasure cycle, and Tony sinks into it more with every kiss Steve gives him, with every scrape of Steve’s nails down his back, with every shift of their bodies against each other and Tony—Tony just
Steve smiles before tentatively moving his hips, his gaze fixed on how Tony’s eyes widen. “Yeah,” Steve says, shifting for a better angle, his own eyes fluttering closed for a moment as he feels Tony tighten around him. “Mine,” he says, leaning down and kissing Tony as he slowly moves his hips, pulling almost all the way out before slamming back in.
“For the two seconds it took to have the photo taken,” Steve says, huffing out a laugh. “Then they just kept crying.”
“Not gonna happen,” Tony says, smiling at Steve before he nudges him with his knee. “Now tattoo me, Mr Rogers.”
“You’re doing so good, Tony,” Steve says quietly as he moved over a particularly sensitive spot. “We’re almost there.”
“Love you like this,” Steve says, nudging Tony’s face with his own, placing a soft kiss against Tony’s cheek, the corner of his mouth. “Love you in all your ways, but like this you’re so blissed out I can see it on your face. Beautiful.”
Giving in, Tony pushes up on his toes, closing the negligible gap between them and kissing Steve. It’s slow and soft, the kind of kiss that Tony’s missed, and he drops Steve’s hand in favour of holding onto Steve’s waist as tight as he dares. Neither of them go to deepen the kiss, to push this fragile moment into something more, and Tony finds himself wanting to cry because he never thought he’d have this kind of touch from anyone again, let alone Steve.
“Not exactly subtle with the Stark Industries logo across it,” she says with a small smile as they walk out of the building, Steve following her lead.
“Get Natasha down here, if she’s not too busy sapping men of their will to live.” Tony hops back on his stool and leans forward, elbows resting on his thighs as he looks at Steve. “We do this, you might not like what we find.”
“Tony, I’ve seen you snoring with your mouth open after falling asleep on the couch, I’ve seen you mistake motor oil for coffee, and I once made you jump for a coffee pot by holding it over my head,” Steve says. “What image do you think Peggy is going to ruin?”
“Wouldn’t even want to take them off you,” Steve says, his hand trailing up Tony’s thigh and resting against Tony’s crotch. “Would you be mad if I ripped the lace off you? Fucked you in your stockings? Just made a mess of you while you were all dressed up?”
Tony shifts on the sand and sighs, crossing his arms over his chest wondering why he can’t just stay on the beach by the fire making s’mores while Steve gets his nightswimming on. It’s a perfectly acceptable thing to be doing. “Steve, I—”
“I didn’t know you’d rip it from my body and tie me up,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow. “That was all you.”
“I want you to have a life, Steve,” Peggy says softly. “I did, you deserve one as well. Take that look off your face, you don’t have to be so dramatic.”
Steve scrambles to sit up, not entirely sure how to react to the enormous amount of faith Tony’s put in him, so he just stares at him, mouth slightly parted as he processes what Tony’s saying. It’s not that he didn’t know Tony was supporting him in this, Steve wouldn’t have been able to get as far as he has without Tony being behind him, but to hear it put into words makes the uncomfortable churning in his gut vanish, only to be replaced with something else. Something that makes Steve want to lay Tony out on the bed and take his fill of him.
They join the queue for hot chocolate as Steve ponders what exactly he’s going to give Tony for Christmas. There’s nothing he can really think to buy him, though he’ll look as they walk around the market, and there’s nothing Tony ever really says he wants. He could—there’s a painting he’s been working on that he could give to Tony, but it’s—it’s personal. Raw in a way Steve doesn’t know if he’s comfortable showing right now. Putting it out of his mind for the moment, Steve orders them hot chocolates with marshmallows, and steps back to wait for them to be ready.
“I’ll talk to Tony about it,” Steve says absently as he looks down at what he has left of his food. “He’ll have some ideas.”
Steve offers her a sheepish smile before he heads out in search of Tony. When he gets off the elevator, he can make out Tony’s voice underneath the general noise of the hospital, and he follows the sound until he sees him behind the glass in the PICU.
. Then again, if it weren’t for Steve, he might not have known about Obie’s double dealing, and he’d—. Well, Tony knows what he’d be doing instead, and a lot of it revolves around that little collection of pills in his bathroom drawer.
“So,” Tony says, pressing a kiss against Steve’s neck. “I’m not gonna ask if you’re okay because I don’t know how you can be, but can I—let me take care of you?”
And, fuck, that hits Tony in the chest. He trails his fingers down Steve’s beard, enjoying the surprisingly soft textures of it against his fingertips. “Stay tonight,” he says. “My bed is big if you’re worried about—”
“It’s okay,” Steve says, ducking his head, a light flush on his cheeks. “I kind of, uh, started drinking it black after we broke up. It was comforting.”
“What is it?” Steve asks, getting out of bed and pulling out a dresser drawer before realising he doesn’t have any clothes in Tony’s room. Rolling his eyes at the laugh Tony smothers, he takes the robe Tony hands him and tugs it on, the fabric skimming the middle of his thighs. “Director?”
“She had a good life, if that helps,” Tony says. “And I’m sure she can’t wait to tell you stories about me as a child, so that’ll cover a lot of time, Aunt Peg loves to embarrass me.”
Tony’s cheeks flush, and he waves a hand. “Go, get some clothes on. Bring back coffee. And something sweet.”
Morgan’s face flashes up on the screen and Tony darts a look at Steve before he answers, smiling when Morgan’s face appears. “Hey kiddo,” he says softly, resting his free hand against Steve’s hair, idly playing with it as Morgan greets him.
“I didn’t know we had to,” Tony says, having wrapped the towel around himself. “Steve, I just—you’re the one who said you didn’t want to rush things.”
“Then we try again,” Tony says. “Steve, you can’t put this much pressure on yourself. All you have to do is convince Pierce that you’re Hydra, and no one knows Hydra better than you.”
Steve stops by a hot dog cart and buys some street meat, wolfing it down as he continues walking, taking in the ways that Manhattan has changed, and the ways that it hasn’t. Sometimes when he walks he heads down to the LES and crosses over the bridge to Brooklyn, but not today. He’s all too aware of how easy it is for him to get lost in his head when he’s in Brooklyn, the memories hitting him a little harder some days, and he doesn’t want to be distracted when he meets Tony for dinner later.
“It’s okay,” Steve says, enjoying the fact that Tony isn’t pulling away, and is instead almost curling in closer to Steve. “It’s not like you haven’t watched this before.”
Christmas Day sees Steve waking up with Tony’s head nestled on his chest, a comforting warm weight as he slowly opens his eyes. He sighs, pulling Tony a little closer, enjoying the slide of Tony’s thigh against his legs.
Steve cups the side of Tony’s face and drags him in for a quick kiss. “Still cheating?” he asks, thumb stroking Tony’s cheekbone.
“All American,” Steve says with a huff. “It’s like everyone forgets about my parents.” Putting his book down on the floor, Steve swings his legs round to the ground and sits up. “If they meant all American as what I think it should mean, then that would be one thing, but they don’t.” Rubbing his hand over his face, Steve shakes his head. “It doesn’t matter, I’m being—”
It’s chaos in the wake of losing the Tesseract, but Steve mostly misses it, instead waking up on the ground with the sceptre beside him and a scribbled note in his own handwriting that tells him to trust himself, to trust Tony, and offers up proof in the form of what his mom used to make for him on his birthday. To say Steve’s a little confused would be the understatement of the year, and he hasn’t even been awake for most of it.
“Shut the fuck up,” Clint says, the front legs of his chair slamming into the ground. “Did you—my mission, was that?”
Steve lifts an arm up as Tony leans in against his side, and smiles when Tony makes a satisfied noise as Steve pulls him in close. “Hi,” Steve says. “What about next week?”
Keeping his face neutral as he stares at the back of Rumlow’s head, Steve swallows. “I’ll be there,” he says.
“I—” Tony’s at a loss for a response and he sighs, dropping his arms to his sides. “That’s a hard question to answer.”
“Your secret’s safe with me,” Steve says with a smile. “I’m just happy you didn’t take me somewhere I’d have to work out what fork to use with which dish.”
Tony steadies himself on his feet, cock pressed up against the mattress as he grabs onto the sheets. He’s still not ready for the first blow on his abused skin, and Tony lets out a broken sob at the feel of it. It hurts so fucking good, and by the time Steve hits him again, Tony’s cock is leaking pre-come and he’s not even aware of the words coming out of his mouth.
There’s a swoosh as the doors to the workshop open, Natasha walking in wearing a hoodie and clutching a mug of coffee. “What’s going on?”
Tony meets Steve’s gaze, the fierceness he sees there going straight to his cock. “I can do it,” he says with a small smile. “If you kiss me.”
The mug warms his hands as he breathes in the scent of it. There’s a hint of cinnamon in the mix, and Steve needs to remember to ask Sam where he got it so he can stock up for the rest of winter. Tony’s done, pouring his drink into a mug, and Steve is suddenly hit with a panic that Tony’s going to walk away.
“We do,” Pierce says, clapping Steve on the back. “The world is changing, Captain. Ever since Tony Stark didn’t die in that cave and came back with a mission, Hydra knew that a day of reckoning would come. That we’d have to be ready. Your pal there, he’s been part of our biggest missions.”
“Am I not meant to?” Steve asks, and Tony smiles, big and unselfconscious, and Steve can’t help but return it. “I want you.”
Tony snorts. “Don’t be mean, Aunt Peg,” he says, leaning back in his chair and smiling over at Steve. “Aliens happened.”
Wrapping his arms around Tony’s wet frame, Steve lifts him up slightly and kisses him. He’s exhausted, but there’s a level of comfort from having Tony’s body against his that can’t be duplicated by anything. Tony’s hands are scrabbling for a grip on Steve’s skin, and Steve smiles into the kiss, pressing their mouths together one more time before he lowers Tony back down. “We should finish up in here,” he says. “Then we can see what happens.”
,” Tony bites out as Steve runs a hand across his rapidly hardening cock through the sheets, the fabric sliding against his skin. “Okay, okay,” Tony says. “Can you do something while you’re down there?”
Tony hums happily, soaking up the praise as Steve’s fingers trail over his ass, his touch lighting up Tony’s abused skin. “
“We’re not entirely sure,” Fury says. “But it’s robotic and breathing fire in Central Park, so I’d consider it a personal favour if you’d all get your asses in gear.”
Steve groans as Natasha throws him on the mat, his hands automatically coming up to block her strike to his face before he pushes her off him. When he gets to his feet, he faces off with her, and Steve would swear there’s almost a smile on Natasha’s face.
“You’re acting like I’ve never held a baby before,” Tony says in a sing-song voice. “Relax, Cynthia, I’ve probably held more babies than you.”
“Not unless you feel you need to,” Steve raises an eyebrow. “What have you been doing since you got out? I know you said you retired, but—”
“That’s not what I was going to say,” Steve says, watching Tony drain his coffee before he tries to steal Steve’s mug. “You can’t have my coffee.”
“Might have to make an appointment,” Sam says. “Trust me, if we could fit you in today, I would, but this will take some time.”
Steve presses his lips together, trying to figure out how to say it. “The other me? That note he left me? He told me to trust you.”
Tony tilts his head and looks at Steve, sees how he’s slightly hunched over, the sun turning his hair golden, and his gaze fixed on the sand. “You did, didn’t you?” Tony suddenly realises. “And you never would’ve said a word about it.”
Steve nods in acknowledgement. “We’ll plan for that,” he says. “As for Bucky, can you call in some more favours? Get your hands on any files on him from anyone you know, the more we know, the more prepared we’ll be for when we get him out.”
“Like it,” Tony mumbles, his head feeling pleasantly fuzzy. “When you use it on me when m’already sore. Feels g—oh
“Ah yes,” Peggy says, her hands smoothing the quilt over her lap. “I heard about that, wondered if I was losing my mind, given everything.”
“I don’t even know the things he’s done,” Steve says in a small voice. “What if—” He breaks off and swallows, looking down at Tony’s hand, his mind cataloguing all the small scars he can see on Tony’s skin.
“Shh,” Steve says, standing up and running a hand over Tony’s hair. “I love you too,” he says, pressing a kiss against Tony’s hairline. “Sleep, Tony,” he says, settling back in the chair. “I’ll be here.”
Their eyes meet, and Tony sees the pain that’s still there under the surface. The painting on the wall doesn’t even come close to what Steve went through, Tony knows that. He gets it, some of it, the fear that comes from no longer knowing your body, of your entire world being turned upside down because of something you couldn’t control. “Okay,” Tony says, finally, breaking eye contact with Steve reluctantly. “That was awkward.”
“You said you could come without being touched,” Steve says, letting Tony’s legs slide down from his shoulders as he leans over him, Tony’s legs instinctively wrapping around Steve’s torso. “Were you lying?”
Tony feels Steve passing over his ribs and he takes the direction Steve gave him, breathing out as steadily as he can as Steve works rhythmically, the needles sending vibrations over Tony’s chest.
Lifting his legs up so Tony can sit down, Steve pulls himself up into a seat, his back resting against the arm of the couch and his socked feet pressing lightly against Tony’s thigh. “So what does Reed mean by that?”
“My mom’s name was Maria,” Tony starts, secure in the knowledge that Steve will be listening to every word he says. He kind of thinks he could get used to it.
“If you’re looking for gratitude you’ll be in for a long wait,” Steve says when they reach the elevator.
“Relax,” Tony says, joining Steve on the couch and kissing him. “Hi. Guess the boxes got sent over?”
They easily fall into step with each other as they walk towards the market, shoulders brushing together. “What do you want?” Steve asks, the snow crunching beneath his feet.
“That’s what I thought.” Letting go, Steve reaches over Tony’s body to grab the lube from the bedside table. Kneeling on the bed, he nudges Tony’s legs apart, watching the way the lighting in their bedroom makes the gold on Tony’s body shine. “God, Tony, you look incredible,” he says, slicking up his fingers and pressing them against Tony’s hole.
Pierce makes a thoughtful noise and leans back in his chair. “Right. Well. This was enlightening. I’ll be in contact.”
“Guess it would depend on the book,” Tony says, meeting Steve’s eyes. They’re ridiculously blue, and Tony finds himself struggling to look away before it gets awkward. “So,” he says, clearing his throat. “Friday?”
“Chicken parm,” Tony says, letting go of the chair and walking over to the stove. “I need to get the spaghetti on, if you still eat carbs, but otherwise—”
. If I wanted a twenty two year old to fuck, I could go and get a twenty two year old to fuck. But I don’t want that, I want you. However old you are, whatever you look like, it’s always going to be you.”
That evening, Tony doesn’t get home until late, and Steve’s still awake when Tony walks onto the main floor from the elevator. Turning his head to greet him, Steve notices how exhausted Tony looks, his tie loose around his neck and his suit jacket crumpled in his hands.
When the doors open again, Steve sees Tony laid out on the bar with his vitals being taken by a machine, and before Steve really knows what he’s doing he’s right by Tony’s side, dropping the case and his cowl on the floor. “What happened?” he asks, hand hovering over Tony’s chest.
to, because he knows that he wouldn’t be risking their friendship, their team, if he weren’t sure, and Tony is the same way. Steve knows because—because both of them have already sacrificed so much in their personal lives for the good of the world. They have to be sure, Steve thinks as he sips his hot chocolate, Tony leaning against his side. It's too damn dangerous if they’re not.
“That better be Steve because I’m not having anyone else’s mouth on me,” Tony says, lifting his head off the table and unconsciously leaning towards Steve.
“Ever the tease,” Tony says, a smile creeping on his face. “Sure, sign me up for five, I’ll send them to Rhodey.”
“Yeah,” Steve says nonsensically, reaching down and easily lifting Tony up, smiling against Tony’s mouth as Tony winds his legs around Steve’s hips. Walking them out of the bathroom, Steve stumbles a little when Tony’s teeth graze against his neck, and he almost drops Tony on the bed as he goes to lower him on the mattress. Straightening up, Steve looks at Tony sprawled out on the sheets in a pair of sweatpants which Tony quickly kicks off. “Beautiful,” Steve says as he loses his boxers before climbing on the bed, his body covering Tony’s form. “You’re so—”
“You said ‘were’,” Tony says, his cheeks heating up as he rocks back on his heels. “And I don’t want to be pushy—”
Tony returns the smile, his hair a fucked out mess. “Yours,” he says, mouth forming a soft pout. “Always.”
“I don’t want to do any of this,” Tony says, ignoring Steve’s question because he can’t think about talking about his mom to anyone, not today. “I don’t want to put on a suit, I don’t want to talk to reporters, I don’t want to talk about my dad, I don’t—
Steve opens his eyes, tilting his head so the water is running down his back instead of his face. “I’m not okay,” he says. “Today was hard.”
The compound is quiet as Steve pads through the hallways to the kitchen, and he almost asks FRIDAY if Tony’s asleep but doesn’t want to risk the temptation of seeking him out if he’s not asleep. Steve doesn’t even know what he would say.
Tony’s fucking floating by the time Steve’s finished, and he gladly sinks into the bed when Steve’s body covers him, Steve whispering in his ear how proud he is of him. “One more,” Tony mumbles. He can feel Steve’s body still on top of him. “Please?”
“Okay,” Steve says, a flush of colour high on his cheekbones almost hidden by his beard. “Good. I mean, thank you.”
Tony eyes him in a way that makes Steve want to crawl inside his skin, but he holds Tony’s gaze instead, and when Tony looks away there’s a satisfied smile on his face. “Okay,” Tony says. “Steve. Look, we’re still going for lunch, but after that, come back here with me and we can talk.” Slipping down from the bar, Tony looks around at the mess that was his penthouse. “Lot of work to do,” he says with a sigh. “Pepper is already working out funding to clean up the city, and I’m sure she’ll be chasing me for my signature soon. Thor is panicking about Loki, and to be honest I’m not exactly enamoured with the fact that the tesseract has gone missing, but that’s the hand we’ve been dealt, I guess.”
“I was gonna say you can stay,” Steve says, not looking at him. “I could throw your pants in the machine, they’d be clean for the morning.”
“I never would’ve rejected you,” Steve says, taking a few steps towards Tony. “I mean, I was angry, I couldn't help that after—” Steve breaks off, his hands clenched in loose fists by his side. “There were so many times I wanted to call you. When Ma started going downhill, when I was thinking of leaving the city. When I moved here and didn’t know anyone and was terrified of the extra responsibility. Tony, you were the
“Three years in September,” Tony says, not pretending like he doesn’t know what Steve is asking. “Sometimes it feels like forever, sometimes it feels like no time at all.”
“Well,” Peggy says, looking at Tony who waves a hand in the air in resignation. “I’d stopped by in the morning, I was going to be away for his party and I wanted to make sure I saw him. Maria and I were having tea when Tony came running into the room, make up smeared all over his face.”
“It’s fine,” Steve says, looking down at where Tony’s hand is squeezing his leg. “Every other year I’ve been on a mission. This is the first year I’ve had to just experience Christmas.”
“Sorry,” Steve says, walking over and tilting Tony’s head to check he hasn’t seriously injured himself. “No blood, you’re good.”
Steve smiles as he ends the call, slipping his phone back in his pocket. Holding the bag out, he shrugs. “Better than me,” he says. “Have a muffin.”
“It’s fine,” Tony says with a tight smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “Ticking off something else on the list, right?”
A few weeks later, Steve’s on the couch in Tony’s workshop when his phone goes off. “Shit,” he says, putting down the tablet he’s been working on. “Tony?”
Steve leans back against the couch and sighs. “I don’t know,” he says. “If I say no, he’ll lock me out of everything and we lose our one lead.”
Steve shrugs, hand coming up and touching Tony’s chin as he leans down and kisses him, humming happily when Tony responds by deepening the kiss. He lets himself have this, the intimacy he never thought he’d have when he was younger, that he thought he’d missed out on as he got older. The day he realised he could have Tony, that Tony wanted him back and that they could build something together, was the best day Steve had had since he got out of the ice. “I like you however you look,” Steve says when he breaks away. “And I wouldn’t say no to seeing you all gussied up.”
“I thought maybe it was a sign from Natasha. That maybe, wherever she is, she was telling us to sort our shit out,” Steve shrugs, a self conscious smile on his face. “I told you it was stupid.”
“I can’t have the team on standby,” Steve says. “But if I have the watch, then I have you. Anything that sounds wrong, or—I don’t think I’d be able to give you a signal, but if—”
“No, nothing like that,” Pierce says with a small chuckle. “I think even our security would baulk at doing a cavity search on you.”
Tony falls asleep before the body hits Al’s cop car, and Steve watches the rest of the movie ever so painfully aware of Tony’s body curled up next to him. Tony’s head is resting against Steve’s chest, and at some point Steve ended up with his arm draped around Tony’s shoulders. The thing is that this isn’t new, Tony’s fallen asleep on him before, most memorably when Steve had already been napping on the couch and Tony had apparently decided he looked comfortable enough to sleep on, but there’d always been other people in the compound.
“Blackout drunk,” Tony says. He rubs a hand over his face and lets out a hiss at the sudden pain. “That thudding in my brain isn’t just a hangover, is it?”
“Yep,” Tony says, catching Steve’s mouth in a slightly sloppy kiss, exhaustion starting to hit him. “I want a bath,” he says, mouth moving against Steve’s lips. “Bubbles. You can wash my hair.”
A smile breaks out on Steve’s face and he nods, his eyes lighting up. “That does sound exactly like what you need,” he says. “I’m glad, Tony, I really am.”
Sinking further into Tony’s body, Steve lets out a groan at the feel of Tony around him, and he leans down for a kiss. “You’re so good to me,” he mumbles against Tony’s mouth. “Whatever I want, you’re always—”
Tony tries to catch his breath as he watches Steve wipe his hand on the sheets. “Good?” Steve asks, resting his chin on Tony’s thigh and looking up at him.
“I trust you,” Steve interrupts. “I just—I think your theory might be right. Rumlow followed me into the elevator and told me I have to meet with Pierce tonight, but protocol would be for Fury to tell me that. Fury didn’t even mention Pierce still being in New York.”
It feels like being pushed under water over and over again, like not being able to catch his breath, and it’s only the fear of sending himself into a panic attack and choking on his own damn tongue that gets him to calm down.
“I know. You were convulsing so violently, I thought you were going to crack your head open, and—” Steve breaks off, his free hand coming up and touching Tony’s chin gently like he wants to make sure Tony’s actually there and alive. “All I could think was ‘I love him. He’s going to die in front of me, and I love him’.”
Tony can’t help the smile that crosses his face at Steve’s words, and he pushes past the urge to turn away, instead holding the look Steve’s giving him. “Yeah,” he says quietly, inching a little closer to Steve, ignoring the pull of his freshly tattooed skin as he reaches over and rests a hand on Steve’s thigh. “Think I’ll have to as well.” Tony runs his fingers up and down Steve’s jean clad thigh, watching as Steve licks his lips, his mouth dropping open slightly when Tony’s fingers graze over his crotch.
“Something like that,” Tony says with a sigh before he turns to look at Steve, a soft smile on his face that somehow is inescapably Tony, whatever age he’s at. “Okay.”
“That’s something that’s never been said about me before,” Tony says, taking Steve’s hands in his. “I didn’t do anything special, Steve. You—” Tony breaks off and sighs. “You know I’m not okay, I have nightmares about too many things that have happened in my life, and it’s—maybe it’s selfish, but having you here makes life better.”
“You could, uh—” Steve breaks off and shakes his head. “Sorry,” he says, reaching for the box of tissues on the coffee table. Wiping himself clean, he drops the used tissues on the floor and stands up, refastening his jeans.
There’s a clang, and Tony feels the metal cuffs fall from his wrists, scraping against his skin, and if that—. Lifting his head, Tony concentrates on opening his eyes.
“Some days are better than others,” Tony says with a half smile as he watches Steve dry his hands with a dishcloth. “I don’t have any milk for the coffee.”
Steve smiles, looking down at Tony holding his hands, Tony’s sleep warm skin a comforting balm. “I guess we need a plan other than blowing stuff up,” Steve says. “If we’re going to get this done.”
“If not then I really need to call my driver before my sweatpants stick to my skin,” Tony interrupts, raising his eyebrows. “Because it’s starting to feel like I’m fifteen again.”
“I’ve seen how government works, I’m not taking that bet,” Steve says as he watches the shower of Tony’s eyelashes fall over his cheekbones, taking note of the dark circles under his eyes that he could mistake for bruises. “Were you in DC all day?”
“A holiday romance?” Steve asks as he steps out of the shower and grabs a towel, fastening it around his waist.
When Tony finally needs to catch his breath, he pulls away, and watches as Steve’s face breaks into a smile.
“As long as there’s no rubber gloves involved, I’ll be fine,” Steve says as they step into the elevator.
“Yeah,” Tony says, looking up and taking a sip of coffee. “And too many people who knew where to find me, including all the people I didn’t want to see. Instead, I went back to Massachusetts, hunkered down in a small town and kept to myself for a year or so.”
“Since he fell from the train,” Pierce says. “On and off, you understand. He’s kept in cryo until we need him. He has a certain skill set that has been very useful over the years. Changed history, one might say.”
Whatever Steve would say is cut off by Tony laughing, and Steve’s taken aback by how free he looks, how relaxed and happy he is, and the realisation that Steve would do anything to make Tony laugh like that again. “Yeah,” he says hoarsely, not taking his eyes off Tony. “You might be right about that.”
Tony catches a glimpse of the smile on Steve’s face before, finally, their mouths meet in a soft kiss. It’s ridiculously innocent, the simple play of Steve’s mouth against his, but it’s got Tony’s head spinning in a way that’s got nothing to do with the fact he got hit last night.
“Yeah,” Tony says, tilting his face until their mouths are brushing together. “Please, I want—please.”
“Oh,” Steve says, his fingers catching on a piece of loose thread on Tony’s t-shirt. “That’s really soon.”
“It was simple,” Tony says. “I woke up one day and I hated myself. Realised that I had no one I could call who would just be there for me.” He pauses, not entirely sure how to say what he wants to say. “My last weekend high was really bad. I still don’t know what happened, or what I did. It’s—there’s hazy flashes but—. Honestly, half of me expects to get hit with an arrest warrant still because I just don’t remember anything.”
“You sure? Because I’m killing it on Angry Birds right now.” Tony looks up, his brow furrowing. “And also you still look like you’re about to face a firing squad.”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Steve says as he gets the stencil onto Tony’s skin. “I don’t do this job to hurt people, I did enough of that in the army.”
“Your father helped develop our intellicrops,” Tony says. “He’s done more for people around the world than I have, I would’ve been a fool not to hire him.”
“Sure,” Tony says, his fingers playing with the short strands of hair at the back of Steve’s head. “On one condition.”
“I want to shower with you,” Steve says, opening his eyes and looking straight at Tony. “If that’s okay.”
Steve looks at the bags on the breakfast bar, realising where they must’ve come from. “Sounds like your plan worked out,” he says. “They smell good.”
Steve wakes up early enough to head down to the gym before his meeting, there’s no one else there, and he gets to work trying to build up a sweat. Tony’s been working on getting the equipment up to scratch, but it’s not quite there yet and the punching bag breaks off in the middle of a set. He tells JARVIS to let Tony know how long that one lasted and switches to suicide runs before ending on push up variations until his muscles start to feel an ache. It’s not ideal, but the attention still hasn’t died down yet and Steve doesn’t want to risk going for a run.
The garage has a car service on call for their use, and Steve settles into the back seat of one of the cars. He doesn’t know what to expect from SHIELD now. If Tony’s suspicions are right, then he’s going to have to be on guard constantly, and that—.
“It’s not really an arc reactor,” Tony says. “I mean it is, it’s the last design that I had in my chest, but I made it specifically to be a nightlight. There’s a button on it, or you can ask FRIDAY and she’ll light it for you if you can’t—”
It’s not that Steve doesn’t enjoy spending time with the kids at the children’s hospital, he’s always happy to, but it’s been a long damn day. Lunch with Tony got cancelled because of an emergency at one of Tony’s manufacturing plants, and then the hospital asked if Steve could come earlier than planned, so Steve didn’t get to see him before he left. If it had been any other week, Steve wouldn’t be so irritated, but they’ve both been so busy that they’ve barely been able to spend any time together.
They’re a little blurry, like whoever was taking them had a hard time staying steady, but he can see the black stockings all the way up Tony’s legs, the little gold clips attaching them to the garter belt, and—and the underwear. The lacy black underwear that’s barely covering anything of Tony.
Natasha pauses on the second to last step. “I’ve learnt to be comfortable with a lot of things, Steve, don’t worry about me.”
“I like it,” Steve says, just before he gently puts Tony down on the bed and quickly strips his own clothes off, not giving a care where they fall. Grabbing the lube from the nightstand, Steve gets on the bed and focuses on Tony. The late day sun is streaming through the windows, casting a golden light over Tony’s skin, and Steve can’t help but stare and catalogue all the ways in which Tony’s body is different now.
Steve’s hand cups Tony’s face firmly, pulling him closer, and Tony can only go with it. Wants to go with it, point of fact, wants nothing more than for Steve to take control of this moment. And Steve does, his mouth softly pressing against Tony’s lips, coaxing them open as he kisses Tony with an urgency Tony didn’t expect but is all too happy to be on the receiving end of. Gripping Steve’s thigh harder, Tony resists the urge to climb in Steve’s lap, but only barely, wanting to be surrounded by Steve as much as humanly possible.
“No,” Tony says. “I mean nothing’s foolproof, but it’s a prototype for the next generation of StarkPhones, even if someone took it from you, they wouldn’t be able to get in. If you’re worried, I can—”
Steve tells him about a cover up he’s doing on a client who got his kid’s birthdate wrong, and Tony erupts into laughter during a meeting with Pepper. One evening he sends Steve a photo of the sunset from the top of Stark Tower and four days later his phone pings with a photo of a painting of that same sunset.
“I told you,” Tony says, shifting his ass back into Steve’s touch. “Just fuck me.” Tony’s barely got the words out before Steve’s slipping his thumb inside him, and he can just picture the smug smile on Steve’s face. “
The quiet strains of Dean Martin’s voice starts playing, and Steve sips his coffee, perfectly content with his Christmas morning.
“I never have to say anything, but I do anyway,” Tony says, putting his fork down and reaching across the table to take Steve’s hand. “Steve, I can’t tell you the amount of people who have tried to date me because I’m Tony Stark, and I mean that literally because I can’t be bothered to do the math. For the record, you were hot before the serum. The muscles are great, sure, not going to complain, but I’m more interested in Steve Rogers than Captain America. And you’ve always been Steve Rogers.”
“Very much,” Steve says. “Or you could wear your colours, bet you’d look real good with a gold garter belt.”
The problem with dating another superhero is that your dates inevitably eventually get interrupted by something terrible. And so it goes that they’re having burgers at a diner, being what Clint would call ‘incredibly gross’, when Steve hears an explosion a few blocks away. By the time he’s turned to Tony, the suit is already crawling up Tony’s body, and Steve throws some cash on the table before they head out.
“What was the point of this?” Steve asks as they walk out of the room, making sure not to give Bucky another look as he leaves. “Was this supposed to shock me? Make me punch you? Disavow Hydra?”
Tony has a sleepy smile on his face, lines on his face from Steve’s sweater, and it’s all Steve can do to stop himself from leaning in and kissing him the way he wants to.
“I—” Tony breaks off, aware he’s still resting a hand on Steve’s arm, and he pulls it away, sticking it back in his pocket. “No one’s ever said that before.”
Tony’s about to start begging when he suddenly feels Steve’s cock start to slide inside him, thick and unyielding. “Fuck,” he gasps, feeling like the air is being punched out of him with every inch of Steve’s cock. “You—
“No, it’s not,” Tony says, swallowing around the lump in his throat. “You should—” he steps back and gestures extravagantly with a smile. “Come in.”
“I’m not the same person I was before the war,” Steve interrupts, like he’s trying to get all the words out at once. “I haven’t—there hasn’t been anyone for more than a night, and if you—if we—I’d want you for more than a night.”
“Okay,” Tony sighs, tangling their fingers together. “But if a shark eats me, you’re explaining it to Morgan.”
Tony’s staring up at him, his face flushed as he comes, spilling all over his stomach, and Steve feels him tighten around his cock. Swearing as Tony pulls him down into a desperate kiss, Steve’s hips jerk as he pushes into Tony again and again, chasing his own orgasm, a slow steady build that has his vision whiting out as it hits.
Tony burrows deeper in his blankets, squeezing his eyes shut and trying to forget the last year. Taking control of Stark Industries was one thing, even if it had been a shock to Obie and the rest of the board when Tony came of age and started dispensing of all his dad’s old cronies, but SI’s exploration team actually finding Steve? Tony deciding Steve should come live with him? Tony has regrets.
“I think I’m safe with you,” Tony says, wondering if he’s responsible for the flush on Steve’s cheeks. “I’m not making you work late, am I?”
Everyone expects Captain America to be good with kids. And he is, kind of. Give him a kid who can speak in full sentences, who wants to run their fingers along the shield, or be given high fives, and Steve can cope. He can. At least, he knows that kids that age aren’t completely breakable, that he’s not going to accidentally hold them too tight and break their bones.
“I don’t exactly have any loyalty to SHIELD,” Bruce says, a small smile crossing his face. “I’m in.”
“Yep,” Tony says, listening to the bottles rattle in the drawer as Steve closes it again. “I might need you to hang onto them for me.”
“Captain Rogers, I am sorry to interrupt,” JARVIS interjects. “But Director Fury is on the line, and he’s quite insistent.”
Steve smiles, kissing him again before he moves, gently pulling out of Tony even as Tony complains about it. Gathering him up in his arms, Steve rolls onto his back, holding Tony close. “Can’t say I ever expected to do that,” he says, his fingers tracing a lazy pattern over Tony’s skin. “Fucking you at this age, I mean.”
Natasha shoots him looks whenever he turns down a mission from Fury, and Steve wonders if she suspects that he’s keeping something from her. It’s not that he doesn’t trust her, or Clint, but nothing’s confirmed and the more people who know about it, the more they risk it getting out and Steve doesn’t want to know how Hydra would react to that.
“You’re right,” Tony says. “It’s weird that they think you’re Hydra. Do you think your alternate universe double was Hydra?”
There’s a light flush over Tony’s cheekbones, and all Steve wants is to press him back against the couch and waste the rest of the day kissing him, running his hands all over Tony’s body, and finding all the ways to make him gasp in pleasure, but—.
Tony’s shivering by the time they make it out of the water and he doesn’t wait as Steve douses the fire, instead heading inside and jumping in the shower to warm up. He’s just finished washing himself when he hears a movement behind him and turns to see Steve joining him in the shower.
“Okay,” Sam says, looking down at the paper with a slight frown before glancing at Tony. “Sure, you got an idea of where you want it?”
“Loving exploring Australia with her mom,” Tony says. “So, I guess so. I wanted them out of New York for a while until everything dies down.”
“That interesting, am I?” Steve asks, watching as Tony walks over quickly. “Needed to hunt me down instead of doing anything productive?”
“You’d think they’d have had their fill of this by now, but no, five years later and I still have to go out there and talk about my dead parents. Talk about Howard, really. No one wants to hear about—” Tony’s voice cracks and he rolls back onto his side, using everything in his arsenal to stop himself from crying. “She was better than either of us, but no one wants to hear about her.”
Tony’s not exactly a fan of waking up sticky and gross with come stuck to him in awkward places, but given that he also gets to wake up with Steve in his bed again, he’ll take it.
“My bed is really big,” Tony says in a rush. “If you want to—if you’d sleep better with someone there, then—”
And that wasn’t anywhere in the realm of what Tony expected. “Tell me,” he says. “Steve, let me help you. Is it—”
Steve doesn’t say anything to that, just waits for Tony to put the pan on the stove. There’s no way to avoid being close to Tony like this, and for the first time in a long time, Steve wishes he was the old him, or at least that he could stand there without his shoulders bumping into Tony each time he stirs the hot chocolate.
“Your stubbornness will be the death of me,” Tony says, a smile on his face that Steve’s never seen before. “I’m too tired to argue with you. Dinner, tomorrow?”
“Now I’m worried,” Steve says, laughing when Tony smacks his leg lightly. “Okay, okay,” he says. “We can try and figure it out together.”
Steve laughs, the atmosphere in the room turning a little lighter, and Tony relaxes, letting himself enjoy the drag of the needle against his skin. They lull back into an easy quiet, music from Steve’s phone low in the background, and Tony would swear he could fall asleep like this. The pain doesn’t even feel like pain anymore, it’s almost euphoric, and there’s a familiar buzz in Tony’s mind that he’s resisting sinking into. He swallows, wondering if what he’s feeling is unusual.
The door closes before Steve can think of how to respond, and he shakes his head, fond smile still on his face. “JARVIS?”
“That’s not very specific,” Steve says, tugging at the sheets until Tony’s cock is exposed. “There’s all kinds of things I could do.”
Steve shifts awkwardly, feeling his cock twitch at the thought of holding Tony’s slim hips tightly as Tony bounces on his cock. He can picture it in his mind, how gorgeous Tony would look above him, how Steve could leave bruises on his skin from holding him firm, and—. “Jesus, Tony,” Steve says, dragging him into a kiss as he slides a hand down to Tony’s ass and squeezes.
