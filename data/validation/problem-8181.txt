Steve smiles warmly at her, glancing over at Tony’s who’s looking mortally embarrassed. “Will do.”
Tony pushes around the pasta on his plate, not looking up. “It was fine,” he evades.
“This was a last minute decision,” Natasha starts slowly, pressing her fingers into her temple. “Janet has been going back and forth with Pepper Potts since November. Tony apparently wanted to leave the Irons for another Triple-A team and both Fury and Van Dyne saw it as an opportunity. The kid wanted to keep it on the down low, and his old man and Fury go way back or something. Fury did it as a favor to Howard Stark.”
An augury of dread immediately settles over him, a chill striking through his entire body at the unsettling serenity in her tone. “Y-Yes,” he clears his throat in the hopes of stabilizing his shaking voice. “Who is this?”
Steve sits a little straighter in his seat as she addresses him directly.
Tony stands by the bench press, arms crossed, looking as uncomfortable as Steve has ever seen him. He continues to stand there with furrowed brow until Thor takes his cue to leave, only speaking again once he can tell everyone else in their hotel’s gym is out of earshot. "What were you doing just then, three hundred?"
"Yes, actually. Steve used to play for the Stars, Darling, surely you know that."
“Yeah I get that a lot, unfortunately,” Tony glances over to where the rest of his team is waiting. Steve keeps casting curious glances their way, mouth pressed in a tight line as he worriedly looks between him and Fury. “Will that be all, sir?”
He ends up having his fair share to drink that night, along with most of his teammates. Drinking in excess is a rarity for Steve, which makes him a bit of a lightweight despite his size and stature. He finds himself feeling all bubbly and rosy-cheeked, needing to excuse himself to the bathroom so he can splash himself with cold water and take a few moments to gather himself and sober up.
“Aw, your boyfriend defending you now, Stark? That’s cute,” Hammer sneers, pushing Steve’s hand off of him. “I remember what it was like sharing a locker room with him,
“What? Janet told me you’ve gotten offers from them,” Steve says, naturally dropping into a whisper. “You’ve never even considered it?”
The mental preparation for this game has been on par with the physical as far as Tony’s been concerned. He’s done his best to heed Steve’s advice and ignore the media, but it hasn’t been easy. The general public seems to be rallying behind support of the Irons to be respectful to the fact that their founder and team owner had died earlier this year, however, his only son being on the other team has some empathetic people in his corner as well. It’s certainly a dilemma to be in, especially when there seems to be a particularly nasty rumor that if the Avengers lose today, Tony will be going back to his old team. He wouldn’t dream of it in a million years, but of course the media just wants to amp up the drama of the entire situation. Some people even claim that the Avengers winning would be disgraceful, but what would they have the team do? Give the Irons a pity win just to honor Howard’s memory? Tony hates the hypocrisy of it all, not caring what kind of backlash they might receive if--
Steve scoffs and knocks their knees together. “Hardly. I’m more worried you’ll die without me to look out for you.”
“That’s bullshit, Steve!” Bucky interrupts, the right hand of his fist clenching. “Do you know how many people in the world get the chance to play in the World Series? Hell, not even that many Major League assholes get to make it to that game. And you’re just going to throw all that away for- for what?! For me?! Do you think that’s what I want for you?” Steve is shocked into silence by his best friend’s outburst, watching as angry tears well up in his eyes. He can’t remember the last time he saw Bucky cry. “The only reason I’m sitting here with my arm all blown to hell is because
I’ve seen that spark in this kid since day one and just know that every recruiter in the MLB better be trying to get Peter Parker on their roster for next season now that he’s back in action.”
"Nope," Tony sits back down and takes a long drag from his cigarette. He blows the smoke out of the corner of his mouth, in Steve's direction. "You have a game to get to
Tony passes out as soon as they get back from dinner (on his own bed this time) and manages to sleep soundly until Steve’s alarm rouses him for Game Day. They have to get down to the field bright and early for the pre-game interviews, but then it’s go time.
The room is packed full of reporters, overflowing from the seats to sitting on the floor in the main aisle and standing near the back of the room. People immediately start to stand and throw out questions, cameras snapping feverishly as he steps up to the podium. He stares straight ahead, face a blank wall of indifference. He waits until Hill and Coulson quiet the crowd, stepping back to stand behind Tony alongside Pierce, and now, Carol too.
"Goodness, Tony, you drive like such a maniac. You're going to kill yourself one of these days," Steve can hear Peggy saying as the two walk to the doors. Tony holds the door open for the woman before letting it swing shut right as Steve walks up. He rolls his eyes at the childish act, wrenching the door open himself.
Tony smirks, but there’s no humor in his eyes. “Are you saying you would drop me just to teach me a lesson?”
“You don’t have to be a model, just let me take your damn picture,” Tony shifts closer, not making a grab for the camera, but just holding his hand out in request. Steve eventually relents, passing the camera to him. He can already feel the alcohol hitting his system. He isn’t a lightweight by any means, but he also doesn’t drink often enough beyond a beer or two to get that used to it. Tony had mixed in so many unfamiliar spirits and liquors that his system isn’t equipped to handle, and all it took was that one mug before he’s already feeling tipsy.
For once, Tony blocks out the rest of the world. Where he normally lets the environment fuel him, the sound of the fans pumping him up, the attention from the commentators raising his chin higher, his teammates and rivals alike driving him to play harder— it all falls away.
Steve knows the friendly hustle is coming, but it still makes him stumble. “You’re a great player, Buck. I bet you could make it into the rookies with one arm tied behind your back but your parents want you to join the army as soon as you’re done with school.”
. Your Daddy isn't here now to give you any special treatment. You're on my field now, Stark. Tuck in your shirt,” Natasha orders. She’s normally this harsh on new blood, but the malice in her voice seems oddly personal.
“Yes you do. I heard you at your parents’ house.”
“Do you like it?” Steve asks as they walk back towards his new home, ice cream cones they picked up down the street in hand.
Steve’s heart sinks. As complicated as Tony’s relationship had been with his parents, this would be the first year he would be spending the holidays with absolutely no family around him. “You’re spending Christmas by yourself?”
“Yessir,” Peter nods and quickly darts off camera, turning around to throw a haste thank you to the interviewer before rushing off into the stadium.
They end up losing the game against Dallas, but it’s only their second loss during all of Spring Training. The team all crowds around Victor’s portable radio at the airport later that night to hear how the standings are and where the predictions for the coming seasons lie. There are still a handful of exhibition games to be had for other teams, but the Avengers have already proved that this season they aren’t a team to be trifled with.
Steve just hums in reply, twirling spaghetti noodles around in the sauce before shoving a forkful into his mouth. They eat in silence for the next few minutes. Tony can feel the apprehensiveness, thick and cloying in the air between them.
He stares at the drink, surprised by Steve’s forethought. He isn’t drunk by any means from the rum he treated himself to a couple of hours ago, but if he is unfortunate enough to experience a hangover in the middle of the day because of it, this will certainly take the edge off. “Thanks,” he mumbles against the rim of the glass as he takes a few long drinks.
The pitcher presents his middle finger, lips curving into the hint of a smile as the flash goes off. Steve watches as the film develops, plucking the square photo from the bottom of the camera once it’s finished. He gently waves it back and forth for a few seconds, helping the ink develop and dry before holding it out between them so Tony can watch it develop as well. The clarity of the image begins to sharpen, blobs of dark and light eventually shaping into the image of Tony. Steve looks down fondly at it. There’s hardly anything artistic or profound about the shot, but Tony’s personality shines through in it and Steve can’t help but smile.
Steve can’t quite believe it himself. They’re the #1 team in the entire International League, and will soon be facing off against the best team for the PCL to determine the top team of the Minor League as a whole. The PCL’s Champion has not been established yet, their top performers gridlocked into a much tighter race. It’s between four teams as of right now, who each have a handful of games left in the league, leaving things up in the air for at least a couple more days. One of these teams, of course, is the Malibu Irons, who are currently tied for first with games won and only up by one run overall according to Tony— who somehow always knew
Steve wants to trust that Tony would never say a bunch of stuff to anyone from the media "off the record". If a beautiful woman was seducing
"The art you have hanging up is amazing," Steve compliments as the rest of them start on their salads. "Was that a genuine Klimt I saw in the foyer?"
Carol echoes his sigh, tucking her short hair beneath her cap and slapping Steve on the arm. “We better just get out there then. Can’t keep the new blood waiting.”
For a brief moment, there’s a flicker of doubt. “Don’t swing?”
Steve groans in frustration. “Why The Avengers though? Why
Tony’s head snaps back over to Steve, still standing a good few feet away in anticipation for one of his batters to actually follow through with a play. “You know who I am?” He asks, immediately feeling foolish.
Tony’s still making a face like he’s not thrilled about this idea either, or maybe that face is because he’s tasting round two of his breakfast again. “Fine,” he deflates, throwing too much cash down on the table and dragging himself out of the booth, heavily gripping onto anything within arms reach. Steve takes pity on him and wraps an arm around his shoulders to help keep him upright, waving politely at the hostess as he helps Tony hobble back to his car.
Steve sets down his empty mug and moves Tony’s feet off of him to fetch the camera. He pulls it out of the box, letting the strap hang loosely as he walks back over to the couch and points the camera at a stone-faced Tony who has shifted into a lax sitting position, a throw blanket pulled off the back of the couch and into his lap. “Smile, Tony,” he chides.
“Tony can I please go first?” Steve interrupted.
“Hey, look at me. I’m here. I’m safe. And so are you. I won’t let anything bad happen to you, Steve,” Tony said. The declaration was almost laughable considering the profession they were in, but he knew Tony meant it. He could almost hear the echo of Ma and Bucky in the promise and the thought made him smile.
“Hey J,” he said after a slight pause where he contemplated the amount of effort it would take to get out of his clothes. “What was the probability that you mentioned of Steve actually liking me back?”
“Based on my calculation, it would be 77% Sir.”
“Okay look. I know I said it but you have to know by now that was the repressed daddy issues at play Steve. I didn't mean it. I could never mean it.”
“No Tony,” Steve said, shaking his head in fond amusement. “I meant the kids at the children’s hospital in Brooklyn. I’ve been visiting them about once every month or so since I moved to the tower. I picked up gifts for most of them but I called ahead to check and they have a couple of more kids so I need to pick up a few more gifts. Honestly a mission is probably easier. Gift shopping for kids is so much harder than you’d think it would be. I have everything for the younger kids but I need to buy stuff for the older ones tomorrow before I visit in the afternoon.”
“Me and Karl,” she said, gesturing to a small boy, peeking out from behind the bookshelf in the corner. “Karl’s shy. And he doesn’t talk in front of adults.”
Jesus. Steve loved this man so much, he could burst with it. Sometimes it felt like he couldn’t contain all the love he had for Tony. Who wouldn’t love him less if he lost the serum. Who cared more about Steve than Captain America. Who wanted to
“Ava first,” Steve mumbled.
Steve tried to focus on the feeling of Tony’s warm calloused hand in his.
“Will you tell me more about them?” Tony asked and Steve looked at him with such a fragile and hopeful look in his eyes, before he nodded.
“Uh huh. So how many times have you designed and redesigned my suit in the past two days?” Steve asked with a small smile.
“That is true.” Steve had said. “You know I don’t think it really counts as a date when the other party doesn’t know it is one. So maybe we should do something about that. Want to go out with me today?” Steve had asked, feeling almost giddy with happiness and excitement.
“Yeah, yeah. Stop being such mother hens, both of you.“ he said as he got out of bed. He grimaced at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. It was certainly going to be an interesting day.
“Baby,” Tony said, looking strangely as if he was trying not to cry. “Look at me for a minute,” he said as he gently tilted Steve’s chin towards him. “I want you to listen to me carefully, okay?” he asked and Steve nodded.
“I get it Tony. That’s exactly how I feel when you get hurt. Or when you put yourself in danger doing something reckless,” Steve said.
“Happy birthday to America’s ass,” Tony whispered in his ear as he pinched Steve’s butt and Steve drifted off with a smile on his face. It was going to be a good day.
“I guess I just know what it's like. Hospitals can make you feel helpless. Like you have no control over what's happening to you. Most conversations you have center around your health and how you’re feeling. I just like to come in and distract them with something. So for a couple of hours they’re not constantly reminded about being sick and can just be kids.”
“Well I didn’t think we were officially exclusively dating or anything. But I was pretty sure we were going out on dates. Now I’m not sure what those even were. For God’s sake Steve we were cuddling on the couch every night! I got you a bouquet of roses the other day. What did you think was happening?” Tony had asked.
“Okay so are we ready?” Tony asked the team a few days later. They had assembled on the common floor before they had to leave for the annual Christmas party and they all looked mostly dressed.
The kid’s jaw dropped open in surprise as he immediately tried to fix his bed head.
“Yeah, you and literally no one else.”
“You know what Tony?” Steve laughed. “I can do this
Natasha shot him a glare that could cut glass as she finally looked up at him. She looked exhausted. There were dark circles on her pale face and a small cut on her cheek.
“I will,” Rhodey said and Tony cut the call. Both of them were superstitious about saying goodbyes.
“We were already struggling for money before then. But we had just enough to scrape by. Ma was working double shifts at the hospital and we were okay. We were getting by. But when the depression hit its lowest point around 1933, things had gotten much worse. Ma’s salary was cut but the worst part was that I got really sick with pneumonia around that time. The hospital used to help us out with the bill before because Ma worked there but they couldn’t afford to do that any longer. She had to borrow money from friends and neighbours just to pay the bill. She started sewing at night to help earn some more money. All the while I’d just be there, too sick to go to school, completely useless while she worked her fingers to the bone. She often had to make the choice of food for herself or medicines for me and she always, unfailingly chose me. I’d pretend to have a stomach bug sometimes and claim I couldn’t stomach any food just so she would eat something. Bucky and his family tried to help as much as they could. But everybody was struggling. When Ma passed away, I didn’t -“ his voice cracked, overcome with a sorrow he was so used to burying deep inside.
“You underestimate me Steve. We knew we needed to get back. Figuring out how wasn’t really that hard. If it leads to a higher than expected kill count, well that’s just to be expected,” she smirked.“I’m kidding!” she clarified at Steve’s horrified look and Steve huffed out a laugh.
“-- Sir, I just wanted to inform you that Captain Rogers has entered the building. He is currently headed to the gym. Current parameters indicate a state of agitation. Do you want me to make a note in the file?” JARVIS announced as Tony frantically tried to mute him.
“I just need to send a quick message. I'll join you in a minute,” Tony said as he got out his phone to text Happy as Steve knocked twice and entered the room.
“Not really,” Steve said, suddenly self conscious.
“Steeeeve. That’s enough emotional talk for now. I think I’ll actually combust if we express any more heartfelt emotions,” Tony joked but Steve could tell he was touched. Tony put up a front for the media and for the outside world as a self-centred playboy but when anybody came close to expressing genuine gratitude and affection, he’d always deflect with humour. But that was okay. Steve had the rest of their lives to convince him.
“You have no idea what you do to me do you?” Steve said, shaking his head. “You help me be more me Tony. It’s like everything is so much better when you’re with me.  It’s brighter like somebody increased the resolution. And you have the biggest heart Tony. Your - “
“Look, it's not a big deal. It’ll be fine. It’s not like I’m planning to do something about it. It’ll just fade away on its own. And then we can go back to being whatever the heck we are.”
“Tony, this party has been planned for months. The press is going to be there. I’m pretty sure the Defense Secretary is going to be there too, not to mention half of SHIELD. And more importantly, what about Pepper?” Steve said.
“I was about to mention it when you gave me your gift. And then when I saw what it was, well mine just seemed so pale and cheap in comparison. I should have gotten over myself and got you something nice. Something classy.” Steve said.
“Hey,” Tony said as he gently stroked Steve’s back, “you’re okay.”
The first date they had been on, Steve hadn’t even known it was a date. In his defense they’d had dinner and watched a movie on the common floor. Steve had just assumed that Tony had invited the rest of the team and they had been busy. They had watched Toy Story because Tony loved animated movies and Steve loved the art they involved. It was the first time spending time with Tony had felt easy.
“Steve you’re the kindest, bravest person I’ve ever met. But I’m not talking about killing Nazis or fighting aliens. I’m not talking about Captain America. I’m talking about Steve Rogers,” Tony said gently tapping his finger on Steve’s chest.
“You are actually. You just like to pretend you’re not,” Steve interrupted.
“Like the life I had before the serum was real. Like the people I loved were real. And like the people who loved me were too,” Steve said and Tony’s heart ached.
“Tony,” Steve interrupted, shaking his head in amusement. “Were you scared?” he asked, gently.
“So then what did you mean Steve? That I’m an irresponsible person who doesn’t know how to spend his money? That I don’t actually deserve all this money I have? What did you mean exactly? Why don’t you share with the class Steve?” Tony added viciously. He was using that tone he used only when he was really hurt but was pretending to be angry instead. Alarm bells were ringing in Steve’s head. He knew he should say something. He needed to explain that that wasn’t what he had meant at all. But he couldn’t entirely tell Tony what he had meant. Because he didn’t really understand it himself.
“Okay I cannot express how much that doesn't make me feel better Steve. You know this. We’ve been through this,” Tony said as he gently tugged Steve to the shelves in the corner of the gym where they kept all the first aid supplies.
“Hey, you love my ass,” Steve replied with a mock affront.
!” Steve had exclaimed.
She nodded and Steve quickly picked her up. He started running as fast as he could and was almost at the entryway when the whole building creaked and chunks of debris started falling down rapidly. The exit was blocked and there was no way they were going to get out of there quickly. He quickly lay Ava down on the floor and lay down on top of her to protect her while using the shield to protect their heads as the building started coming down around them.
“Oh yeah, I forgot Sam is on the Avengers roster now,” Steve realised.
“Yeah?” Tony said, prompting Steve to continue.
“Steve please don’t tell me you’re running into a building that could collapse any time. Just hold on for 5 more minutes okay? I’m almost there.” Tony said, his voice pleading.
Tony Stark had a problem. Well, maybe it's not so much a problem as a minor inconvenience. A small deviation from the expected reality. It’s miniscule really, or as miniscule as it could get when it involves a 6ft 2 supersoldier. The thing is: Tony has a problem with Steve Rogers. More specifically Tony Stark has a teeny-tiny crush on Steve Rogers. Honestly, it’s fine. There’s nothing to freak out about. This was  Steve Rogers for God’s sake. It was  a perfectly acceptable and normal reaction. It would be abnormal to not have a crush on him right?
“Did you or did you not text Happy to get a bucket full of green legos because you know for some reason Karl only plays with the green ones and you know he’s going to run out soon?”
“I know Nat,“ he said with a tired sigh.
“Because that’s the movie we watched on our first not-date” Tony said, his mouth quirking up at the realisation.
This feeling of anxiety and dread had crept up on him in the afternoon, when he’d realised that today was the 3rd of July. He’d spent his birthday last year in his sparse SHIELD issued apartment hiding under the bed, palms glued to his ears as fireworks burst outside. He’d accepted Tony’s offer of living at the tower the next day. He knew things were different now, that he wasn’t alone anymore. He had a team of people who supported him, who understood him and everything he had been through more than anyone else on Earth could. And, most importantly, he had Tony, his boyfriend of 6 months who was probably waiting for him in bed wondering why Steve was taking so long.
“And what exactly is it that you want to do instead of going to this party?”
“Never mind. I’ll see you later Tony,” Steve said as the doors opened to his floor.
“Hey, it’s okay Steve. I forgive you. I know you didn’t mean to be hurtful. But can we talk about this? I want to know where you’re coming from. I want to understand your perspective,” Tony said.
Steve scoffed. “For God’s sake, Tony. I am trying to protect you, my pack, everyone. That’s my job. I signed up for this. You never did. You don’t have to do this, I do.”
He laughs. It’s soft and dies quickly – joy withering on the vine. “Wonky is that the technical term?”
Steve wipes the snow from his face and says, “You’re becoming a philosopher on me, Tony.”
Tony snarls at her. “Do you even know what he’s talking about? The token? That’s him. Red Skull is going to be pissed to the gills that his prize, Captain America and his nemesis, is enlightened, has gone through the Revelation.”
“Very.” Coulson flicks his attention to the monitor. “You’re launching soon. Good luck, Commander. See you on the Lemurian Star.”
Peter shrieks as Steve cringes and then the boy races out of the house, throwing a goodbye to the house residents as he leaves. For a wonderful moment, Steve shares a smile with Tony until he remembers himself, and he straightens his face to neutral.
“Glad to see you up, champ.” Tony smiles. It’s one of those plastic smiles he uses for the press.
Steve closes his eyes and clamps a hand over his face. “Yeah. Not anymore. I can’t feel it. Not the pathway. It’s gone. Feels like someone cut off my limbs.”
Jarvis announces Pepper’s arrival and leads her into the kitchen where Tony’s already seated at the island counter. He wants it to be informal. Pepper’s clicking heels and the light scent of her perfume are a presence like no other to him. She always reminds him of Spring, inviting like a promise. It’s a shame she’s always been allergic to strawberries because in so many ways she’s like that fruit. A Springtime delight, delicious and sweet right off the vine.
The edge of panic curls around Tony like whispers of darkness at the periphery of his sight. He knows what it feels like to be on the verge. He understands it more intimately than he wants to admit. Carefully, he reaches out and grasps Steve’s hand. “Hey now. I’m here. You don’t have to worry about protecting me anymore.”
“This is Steve Rogers talking not Captain America,” Steve added. He needed Sam (of all people) to differentiate the two.
Tony stumbled back from the kiss, a look of pure excitement and astonishment on his face. “You really go for something when you decide, don’t you?”
“No, thank you, Doctor Banner-.”
“Sometimes,” Steve says. He doesn’t mentioned that if he had been traveling alone, he would have done the trek in one go, not stopping for anything but his bladder and a chew on some jerky. His horse, Shield, is a good one and has a balance that allows Steve to push the animal farther than others would manage. “We should get there by tomorrow evening, if we push it.”
He knocks the big oaf away. “Stop. Gotta- gotta ca-catch my -.” He stops as his lung rebel. Blu pushes him down to lean forward and then gently and rhythmically licks his back. Tony follows the rhythm and his lung and diaphragm relax. He can take a breath. It still hurts just not as bad. He waves Blu away. “Good. I got this now. Thanks.”
With a halfcocked smile, Natasha said, “Both. Plus I’m worried. Bruce is not the kind of person that you need SHIELD playing around with. So keep that in mind.”
Pierce walked up to him. “Swallow it, my dear Captain. Swallow it or his child dies in front of you.”
“Seriously, that’s how you say thank you to someone who’s just offered you a place to live?” Tony went to his bar and Steve tagged along. “So you’re just going to skedaddle – see I know oldie grandpa talk, too. Forget about the pack, about your team, about those Hydra agents you invited to invade everything that’s sacred.” He cringed. Why? Why was he baiting Steve?
Steve chewed on his lower lip. His hand still touched Tony’s cheek and jaw. His hands were so big, and strong. “I’m fine. Don’t stop. Don’t stop now.”  He leaned into Tony, holding him, bringing his forehead to touch Tony’s. “I just don’t want to be a disappointment to you. You mean too much to me.”
“Because we need all the help we can get, and the advertisement looked pretty convincing.”
It never was.
“I didn’t intend anything,” Steve spoke and it was true. If this nightmare future would just go away and maybe Steve could slip back into a dreamless (or not so dreamless) sleep he’d be fine.
“Yes, we are.”
“Bucky, you can call me, Bucky,” he says and there’s something powerful and potent in his gaze.
He spins on his heel, suddenly angry and defiant all at once. “I’m fine. You can’t make this easier or nicer for me, Bucky. Running away to play games at the Rails isn’t going to help me. I can handle Sir Stark, I don’t have a proble-.”
Steve stands up to allow the doctor access to Bucky. “You still think we could do something if we had Loki here?”
It promised and offered. When Tony shifted to move away, Steve grasped Tony to him, not letting him go, prolonging the kiss so that he could taste this new thing, the transformation of who they were together. Each of them had changed in their individual way, and their pairing evolved as well. The very energy streaming between them became a thing itself – an entity of life pulsing between them. Just moments ago, Steve had given up hope, had dissolved the relationship in his head. He’d almost toppled and fell, crushed by the profundity of their potential, what they could be, what they had become. Love did that – scared and terrified. It wasn’t a happily ever after. Happiness and love weren’t romantic comedies or fairy tales. Instead it was this thing – an almost a living being that had the weight life. It lived between them and in them.
“I’m glad you had someone, Tony.”
“Maybe we should talk,” Tony says. Every fiber in his body wants to rebel. His nerves are screaming as if he’s in pain. He doesn’t want to lose Steve. Not like this. Sure, he can fuck up the best relationship all on his own, but this – this is just evil forces of doom playing with him.
“He also told me to do this.”
“It’s not a big deal,” Tony said and then his sight went fuzzy at the edges. Sign number one he had gone too long without blood. He really needed a drink – a good long one too. He stared at Steve’s pulse point at his throat.
He needs to figure out which building to go to and do it fast. If he figured it correctly either Steve hasn't arrived just yet or he's just appeared on the scene. It's been well over the hour he estimated. With bag in hand, he crosses the gravel parking lot, trying not to acknowledge the sweat dripping down his temples or the running of it down his back. He slips on his sun glasses and surveys the first building. It's falling apart, a mere shell of its former manufacturing glory. Probably a great buy with good access to the water. He frowns and keeps searching around and as he crunches the stones under his too expensive shoes. He sees a black SUV and a motorcycle parked behind the second trash heap of a building. It shouldn't bother him, but it does and he shouldn't investigate but he does. He checks out the bike. There's nothing about it that should set off alarm bells except for the fact there's a little (faded) A painted on the seat as if someone wanted to show it but decided displaying it anywhere else would be too recognizable.
“What do you mean?” Tony doesn’t really need to ask. Over the last few days he’s had the same thought, the same fear.
in his direction stared with orbless eyes at him. He turned away, as much as he could considering the collar around his neck, fixing him to the cross.
“Steve?” He hurries to the stricken man’s side, and orders the faceplate lifted. “Damn it, I knew you were alive, I knew you were real.”
“You need an AI. Artificial Intelligence. It should be fairly simple to use the AI to run the computer based learning for the particles and have the AI change it up. I could write you a program, probably in an afternoon.” He stops. “But I think we have to get lawyers involved. It’s Pym’s IP and my AI designs.”
“He’s right,” Bruce says stopping Tony from denying the truth. “If you’re remembering it as well, you’re in both realities too. It’s only a matter of time before you-.”
JARVIS has minded his business throughout the flight. Probably, the AI went through all the data, Tony’s vital signs and reactions then decided it wasn’t worth trying to tear him away from his destination and his single minded pursuit.
“I don’t get it. You two seem pretty close,” Steve said. He squeezed the steering wheel. They tensed in response to the flash of headlights from an approaching car. It continued on its way down the country road.
“It looks fairly close to the truth though,” Maria said. She clutched a tablet in her hand and went directly to Tony. She placed it on the table in front of him and then took a seat to the side and not in the main circle.
Steve and take care of him.
“Well clearly, I have to go,” Tony said. “I won’t be home for lunch. I’ll see you for dinner. Probably.” And with that he stalked off, his leather shoes echoing on the floor. Leaving Steve holding a half full mug of lukewarm coffee and wondering how things had gone so wrong so fast.
“About 8 hours,” Steve replied.
“You wound me Steve. Of course I remembered. Well fine, Jarvis reminded me. And Pepper. And Rhodey. Come to think of it I'm sensing a pattern here of people who don’t trust me and I’m offended, ” he said and Steve laughed.
“Oh you don’t know what it could be? Are you sure about that?” Steve asked. He was angry. He was feeling a lot of things but anger was the easiest one to distinguish at the moment. And wasn’t that the story of his life. Shield hadn’t had to stretch their budget to accommodate for more punching bags for nothing after all.
“Because I know you. And I know anniversaries mean a lot to you. So there’s no way you didn’t get me anything. So spill.” Tony said.
“Oh God Tony you didn't see me today. It was just - it was bad. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Like all the air had been sucked out of the world. It just felt so damn real. I can never go back to that cafe again. Captain America reduced to a gasping mess because of some stupid fireworks.”
“Tony where are you? The meeting is about to start. The board members are already here. Don’t tell me you forgot Ton-”
“Hey you,” Tony said, gently squeezing Steve’s hand to get his attention. “Let’s just sit down for a while yeah?” He collected his supplies and led Steve to sit on the floor with their backs to the wall.
“I’m not talking about the Avengers, you idiot. I’m talking about you. We both have a vested interest in keeping you happy,” Tony clarified.
“Nothing’s wrong with the serum,” Tony reassured him.
“Uh hello? Rhodey? Platypus? Rhodes, you’re breaking up. I can’t hear you. I’ll talk to you later,” Tony said.
“Wait, what?” Clint asked, surprised and Bruce looked this was the best thing he’d heard all week.
“As much as I hate to agree with anything coming out of Clint’’s mouth, I have to agree. Let’s just get this over with,” Natasha said as she slipped into her heels.
“Okay let’s fix that then,” Tony had said. And that’s how they had had their first kiss. With brilliant sunlight streaming in through the kitchen windows on an ordinary Sunday morning and the whole team watching on in poorly-disguised amusement. Steve wouldn’t have it any other way.
“It was nothing,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his neck, self consciously. “We better get going. We have a few more kids to meet,” Steve said as he hugged her goodbye and they stepped into the corridor.
“Thanks Jarvis. And could you just tell Ton - never mind. I’ll talk to him later.”
“So … Mandy huh,” teased Tony and Steve turned to look at him with a frown. “What?” Tony asked when he noticed Steve’s expression.
“Hey what is that supposed to mean?” Tony asked.
Steve turned and smiled at him, small but true. “You know you were wrong earlier, Somehow you do know the right thing to say. Good night Tony.”
“So, what have we got here?” he asked, examining the lego tower the girl was painstakingly putting together with only one arm.
“That’s perfectly fine Steve. Please don’t apologise. I’ve been here waiting for you to wake up for two days straight. Figures you’d wake up in the one minute I left to visit the washroom,” Tony said, shaking his head fondly.
Steve’s face flushed a bright pink and honestly how was Tony supposed to get over this adorable specimen of a human being?
“I’m fine,” he said.
“Are you laughing at my pain, young lady,” Tony said in mock affront as the little girl nodded, smiling cheekily.
Steve felt exhausted. But the thought of going to sleep was scary somehow. He didn’t really want to examine why. “Will you be here when I wake up?” he blurted out. He immediately felt embarrassment heat up his cheeks. That wasn’t what he’d meant to say. It sounded so childish.
“That he does,” Amanda agreed, amused. “Most of the kids are in the playroom at the moment, although Nick and a few of the older kids are in their rooms. We have a couple of new faces this time,” she informed them as she handed them visitor badges.
“I will Steve. Good luck on your mission.” Jarvis replied.
“Why do you love me? I mean you’re you. You could have anybody.”
“I’m sorry I don’t mean to laugh but it's just so absurd. You can’t be in love with me.”
“You,” Steve had replied.
“Oh wait, I got you a Christmas present,” Steve remembered suddenly as he picked up the bag he had kept at the foot of the bed.
“Yes I know babe, we’re going to get her out okay? Tony said. “Just don’t go to sleep.”
He finally locked eyes with Tony and felt some of the pressure around his heart lessen. “Sorry, I just - there was a plane - the plane, I mean, and it was just so much worse than usual because you were in it and I just -”
“There must be,” Steve said urgently. Why was Tony not understanding? “I haven’t had an asthma attack in years Tony. The serum cured me of all my lung problems,” he added.
The last thing he remembered was the sound of the repulsors before everything went black.
Steve looked away from him. It was impossible to say no when Tony turned on the full power of his puppy-dog eyes on you.
“Well I thought we were taking it slow. Not what you’d expect from me I know but I didn’t want to scare him away.” Tony had said. “This means a lot to me okay? I just wanted to do it right.”
Steve shouts out a long cry and then curls up, holding the arm to his chest. He bends away from Tony and vomits up his lunch, the pain strikes. He spits out the last of it and curses.
“You seemed to like that, too,” Steve said but kept his focus on the task at hand as he opened the dishwasher and started to stack the dishes.
Tony laughs. “Yeah, like I have wings.”
“You’ll have to be careful when you pick him up not to dislodge anything,” Cho remarks and she has a tablet in her one hand and a stylus in the other. “We should be ready in a few minutes. Can you place Captain Rogers in the cradle?”
“I don’t know why you think I’m one of these Divini,” Steve said. Denying her assertation seemed like the best thing to do. He wanted to deny it all. He just wanted to be human. Yet, it seemed he wanted the impossible and the world conspired against him.
As the fire flickered in the center of their group, the buzz from their soul bonds grew and wrapped them all, even the ones not bonded into a security shield. With his eyes closed Steve could feel each energy signature. The last days had taught him the resonance and vibrancy of each of their souls. Now as he found his way through the thicket to the creek, he reached out to each soul to enhance the data that JARVIS streamed through the comms.
It doesn’t start with once upon a time, but instead with the hardship and tenacity of Irish immigrants with their young but sickly son. A war to end all wars takes the father far too soon leaving the mother with a boy who might not make it to manhood because of his illnesses. Beyond all odds, the boy fights to survive and learns from his mother to always stand up.
Steve has no words so busies himself with the water. Tony studies him and, with his hands in his pockets, says, “Cho said it went better than expected.”
He left the private quarters and headed back to the main area of the underground bunker. As he approached the command center he heard Hill speaking. “I don’t know. Wilson said to be on the look out – that Tony took off and was headed here.”
Still, Tony got why Peggy would be Steve’s Guide. It made perfect sense. At first, he could put the logical blocks together and figure out how Bruce made it into the inner circle. It made perfect sense if Bruce was designated the Healer of their team. Bruce had some medical background, he could be the medic – it worked. But then Tony hadn’t been chosen – Tony had been rejected. So it wasn’t about their team. It wasn’t about the Avengers. At all.
“Ana is a genius. I don’t ask questions. She had my head when I tried to make the duchess an omelet once and nearly burned down the kitchen.”
“That’s not the point,” Natasha said and Tony swore to hell and back he saw red vibrate around her like a halo. That on top of the other noise in his head rammed the headache starting at the base of his skull to full intensity.
“There seems to be six, sir,” JARVIS says.
“No. Prince Anthony is in the lounge on the station now.”
“I’m not sure that’d be a good idea,” Steve says.  “You need your rest-.”
“Steve, yes. Bring him back on Thursday. Let’s get the non-disclosure ready for him to sign. Also, bring in the best biochemist in the States, and see if he can impart Steve with some knowledge. Also bring in a stats person, too. He’ll need to do some heavy studying if he’s going to help with the project.” Tony stops then because even talking causes his head to throb in percussion to his voice. He closes his eyes and takes off the glasses, a slight hum issues from the frames. “How long was it?”
“You know they selected him for the project because they thought he’d die. Figured it wasn’t a big deal if some mutant of nature died. And then he didn’t. And they didn’t know what the hell to do with him,” Barnes says. “Lucky for me too. In so many ways.” He looks off into the distance before he concentrates his focus on Tony again. “He loves you.”
Tony inhales deeply and then exhales with a measured pace. “It’s all okay, Steve. We’re okay. You’re just – it was rough for you. I wanted to tell you, but it wasn’t a good time. We had a hard time getting you out. A very hard time. We almost lost you.”
The shocks sent jitters through Steve and his teeth knocked together so hard he thought they might crack. As Rumlow advanced, Steve blocked only to suffer another arc of lightning to his torso. Rumlow panted, sweat pouring down his brow.
“Come?”
Fits of weakness tremored through him but he scratched his way back to fighting them, gathering what strength he had,, not letting them get their way. He tried to speak but it only came out as a growl. He stumbled up to his feet again and another blow hit him in the face, the spike going through his cheek and he tasted the wood. He crumpled.
He chews on his lower lip. “I did say days. I didn’t want you to get upset. He did things to you Steve – he used you. You thought – you thought I had feelings for you. It made you believe that you were in your happily ever after.”
“You are very much a sub that you would react so well to the rack even in these circumstances. Of course, learned compliance isn’t actual consent. But for you, you are made this way, aren’t you?” Even as Tony watches the omega’s cock jumps. “Yes, you are.” Tony reaches around to the man’s buttocks and slides a finger into his ass. The slick drips heavily down the man’s leg. Tony scoops some up and rubs it along his right hand. Wrapping a hand around the man’s waist, he glides it and grips the man’s cock. All the while the omega tenses under his hand, tight and firm as if he might explode in a fury of action and pain at the same time.
“You don’t have to use that next time, if you don’t want to. I don’t mind.”
It hurts when he leaves the room. It hurts when he sits in his own room listening to the winds howl and rattle. It hurts in the dark.
“When we get our powers, we transform. Not all vampires get powers or transform. Most don’t, actually.” She looked down at her hand that stayed close to him on the bed without touching him. “Most vampires expire long before they transform. The process starts long before the transformation happens. But the final stages of the transformation process actually require that a vampire expire and then be revived. That’s what happened to Tony.”
It’s been a long time since someone held him. They danced and Tony held him. It’s been a long, long time since he wanted to sink into someone’s arms. This fake date – perhaps it’s an opportunity for something more. Something special. Something real.
“Can I help you?” The woman behind the desk smiles at him. She has a brilliant smile and he fumbles for words. “Okay, this is your first time?”
He’d bonded to Tony.
“I’d usually spit fire at you for trying to placate me, but I have a feeling you’re not doing that at all,” Tony replies. “Because it’s not in your nature.”
But he had no recollection as to how he had ended up here - in this room in SHIELD medical. The room was vaguely familiar because of how many times he’d visited the rest of the team here when they were injured.
“Thanks  Mandy, I’ll see you later,” Steve replied as they set off down the hallway.
“Your worth as a person isn’t tied to Captain America, love. We don’t love you because you’re our leader or because you can lop a man’s head off with your shield.” Tony said, soothingly. “Although not going to lie, that is pretty useful to have,” he added with a rueful smile. “To me, being Captain America is like your job. It’s a part of your life but it's not what makes you you. It doesn’t change anything about the person you are underneath. I’m in love with Steve.” he said.
“Tony, if you stop whining, I’ll buy you a milkshake from your favourite place down the street from here after this.”
“Oh God Nat. Why would you jeopardise your mission just to get here? I would have been fine” Steve said.
“Steve,” Tony said. “We don’t have to talk about this now. Just forget I said anything.”
Shit, the kid was probably going to cry. Tony felt panic rising. He had to fix this somehow but he had no idea what to say. He didn’t need to worry though because Steve appeared to have got it covered.
“What's the worst that could happen?” Tony exclaimed. “Well he could reject my lov- ahem, my affections and then I would have to change my name, grow out my goatee and live as a recluse on some remote island. There is literally a 0 percent chance of him returning any feeling I may or may not have. Trust me, I’m a genius. It's just not going to happen.”
“That’s okay. We don’t really need to talk to build something,” Tony replied, talking louder in the hopes it would prompt Karl out of hiding.
“Because, well because I’m in love with you” Tony exclaimed. And as much as Tony would like to pretend that that had come from nowhere, he knew deep down that it was true. He was in love with Steve. He had been in love with Steve. Kind, funny, brave Steve who made Tony want to be the best version of himself.  And who apparently was in love with Tony. Huh.
“Sounds like a plan,” Tony replied as he set off behind Steve, wondering why if this was just a crush then why does his heart feel like it had grown three sizes.
Tony glanced around and then asked, “JARVIS, could you pull the data on soul packs? Answer Bruce’s question.”
“I just.” Steve searches for the right words, but nothing comes to mind. “I just-.”
“You let someone else knot you.” The words stated so plainly render him. Steve shudders and gulps. He can’t help it. The sob comes out of him, loud and hoarse. Arms curl around his shoulders and pull him into an awkward embrace. “God, Steve.” Tony’s voice scratches through the pain. Steve doesn’t know if the pain is his or Tony’s. “What did you do?” Tony kisses the crown of his head. “Why didn’t you come to me?”
Through gritted teeth, Steve says, “No, I suppose you didn’t.”
“Cold.”
“I can’t build a missile,” Steve says and he rubs a little too hard as his mind runs in circles trying to find a way out of his situation. Fury truly did fuck him over this time.
A breath and then, “Of course it is. See you tomorrow, Tony.”
The words start whizzing around and he grapples to stay conscious but he finds her hands on him, injecting him with something and he’s falling again and doesn’t want to go there. He calls out.  A name, a stranger, a friend.
He doesn’t believe in fate, or magic. But this is damn near close to it.
Tony reaches in and squeezes his hand. “Be safe, Steve.”
“What?”
“Neither can I,” Tony said and they both exited the elevator. Tony glanced around the corridor of the hospital. It had quieted in the short time Tony had been gone, and Clint waved for him to follow. Since Tony had no idea where Steve might be now, he said nothing and allowed Clint to lead.
“Will do,” Steve says, and they hug quickly and part. Turning to the gateway guards, Steve exposes his implant, and the scanner reads it. The tired guard waves him through without a word. No one cares about his suitcase, Royal Escort or not. Steve shrugs and grabs it.
Before Steve can protest, Tony has him in the jacuzzi bath with bubbles frothing above the rim of the tub. Luckily for him, Steve wasn’t abashed about disrobing in front of Tony. He simply took off his clothes and hopped in when Tony told him the water was ready. He doesn’t know if the lack of modesty is due to his years as a member of the military and essentially bunking out with a bunch of guys for weeks on end or if it’s a result of living the life of a wild animal where clothes are a foreign concept.
Steve huffs at Tony. “Thanos. You know full well what his name was.”
Tony watched how Steve petted him, never let go of him. “Now you’re being philosophical.”
“I know,” Tony says and nods. Blu saved him more than once.
“We’re having lunch, perhaps you’d like some?” Tony settles at the head of the table while Steve takes the chair directly to his left.
As Steve rouses, the woman peers over her shoulder at Tony and grimaces. “No, I’m not here for you. I shouldn’t even be here for him. But the whole place has gone down in flames. Can you remember something to tell him?”
Steve hesitates only for a fraction of a minute, but it’s enough to telegraph his indecision to Tony and Jarvis. The servant only clears his throat and steps back into the house. Tony grabs Steve’s hand and pulls him in for a lingering, drawn out kiss that Steve doesn’t have time for but wants, and sinks in to nonetheless. He welcomes Tony and braces his hand against his shoulder, holding on as if Tony is quickly becoming his anchor, keeping him moored and tethered to hope.
His face ashen and gray, Steve lay unmoving like a corpse in the bed. The entire pack stood only a few feet away from the metal framed bed. All the other beds in the ward were empty. Tony heard the rustling of nurses in the distance but didn’t catch sight of them at all. He saw shadows in the distance, down the long dark hallway as if someone, not part of the pack, watched. He wondered if it was Wong and Strange – but something told him it wasn’t. It was someone else.
Dropping the skinner, he picks up the sharpest blade he has and prepares himself. He closes his eyes to the mess of blood. He holds onto the gland even though the pain coils in his stomach and he wants to vomit. The shivers come over him and he knows he’s losing his nerve. He needs to do it, now. Now. Opening his eyes he glimpses himself in the mirror, his pupils are blown wide and black, only a thin ring of blue is visible. There’s blood in the whites of his eyes. He quakes but he forces his focus back to the gland he holds in his hand.
“My, you know your stories about blind and deaf people.” Tony’s expression remains frozen, hard to read.
Steve knows that Odin is trying to make amends for his offhanded insult, but his attempt makes things worse. He decides to ignore Odin’s gaff. “No bother, sir. I’m just surprised you know anything about the Beyonds. I didn’t think that Asgardians paid much heed to human affairs.”
There were not many Padawans at all so Bucky never felt out of place. His parents were part of the Sentinel Guard – a newly established order that vowed to keep the last remnants of the Jedi and their library safe. As Steve learned the ways of the Force, Bucky took the Sentinel Guard’s Oath. Steven came to his ceremony and smiled that lovely, slightly abashed smile and congratulated Bucky. It had been one of the best moments of his life.
“Hey, hey, we don’t have to-.”
“To the rack,” he rasps out.
“Yes.” Steve’s grateful his voice is stronger now.
Salivating, Tony swallows. Pepper never let him have bacon. “Yeah. That. I want that.”
He jerked to the side, nearly slipping and falling on the wet leaves. Bucky stood to the side of the cabin. His eyes looked bruised as if he’d been crying. At that moment, Steve saw so many things superimposed over Bucky. He saw the soldier who walked by his side and protected him all the years of the war, he witnessed the rage of the Winter Soldier as he slammed a fist into Steve’s face, he saw a lost soul wandering Europe and beyond looking for harbor, he saw a man who became all these things at once. None of them could be dismissed. Bucky was a good man and an assassin. Steve had to come to terms with those truths.
“Oh sweetheart,” Tony said and noticed how Steve beamed at the endearment. “I just want you to be comfortable. We take it as slow as you want, as slow as you need.”
“What the fuck, Obie! That armor has been a lifesaver and you know it.” Tony throws down the handful of components he holds. “I’ve modified it so that we can use it for others. I’m not sure what else you want me to do with that.”
Everything hurts.
“I think it’s a great idea,” Rhodey says. “You need to get out there more. You’ve been hiding out for weeks. The press doesn’t like it.”
“You are nothing!”
“Yes,” the vampire said. “I hated the cafeteria food, too.”
“I hope it does. It’s a lot like losing family when you lose a soul bond,” she returned. “So, now I have to ask – what are you going to do?”
He watches the two items bubble and bump around in the pot and then thinks about the nanite solution. It would be so much easier. He taps his implant and whispers the contact registration number. In seconds he’s connected.
He takes out a fork and stabs each potato with gusto. “We just got to this place. This place we’re exploring and I’m not sure how fast we’re going to go and -.”
Shivers run through his body as he stares at the face with scars along the right side that seem almost faded, almost gone. The eyes are kind but glimmering red.  That’s wrong, the Silver Knight thinks. That’s not the right color. He knows this as clearly as he knows his purpose in life.
“You might want to come downstairs and look at this.”
“Like I said, I’m not who and what you think I am.” She lifts her chin to indicate they should continue forward.
“The very definition of life includes the ability to procreate. Omegas do not procreate. They are made to be almost symbiotic to the alpha. You are there to protect me and my progeny. That is all.” Tony wipes away the blemishes on the man’s shoulders. His wounds are long gone, faded and healed.
“During the day, the sun still weakens me,” Tony said.
Tony whistles, gets a tin cup, fills it and brings it back to Steve. He half sits on a stool. “I don’t want to surprise you or anything. But I think I might be going insane. Right now, see, I think you’re actually talking to someone I cannot see. I would say you were crazy, but then I’m the one that just interacted with one of your hallucinations.”
The words echoed in the large domed room. As he looked up to see a bald woman with milky white eyes and arthritic fingers standing next to the table. Dust motes float around her. “Excuse me?”
“Yeah. I’ll be back. Don’t take out any of the wires or tubing, okay?” Bruce lumbers out of the room.
He’s not telling Steve anything he already doesn’t know.
“Whatever you say, doc.”
Steve arched into his kiss, his bite. Tony looked up and saw the bliss of love and something more over Steve’s face. The blush of life drowned out the paleness of his skin and he quaked under Tony’s hands, as if Steve’s strength failed him and he succumbed to Tony’s unnatural strength. Crawling up to meet Steve’s gaze, Tony searched his sparkling blue eyes like the days of sun and clear skies he still remembered, though they faded with each passing year. He licked away the droplets of blood. “Of course, I love you. I love you like I love the dawn. I would risk everything for you. Don’t you know that, Steve? Don’t you get it?”
After four days he’s bone tired and they still have the main event to deal with in the next twenty four hours. The dinner slowly breaks up and Tony can only thank Thor’s gods for that. The Asgardian has stood by Tony and pledged that the realms under Asgardian rule would ally with Tony’s coalition. When he announced it, Rossi and Estane objected, saying that Asgard should stay neutral. They weren’t, after all, humans. Luckily, a powerful beta corporation stood up for the Asgardian alliance. It silenced the protest, but it didn’t wipe it away. Thankfully, the rest of Tony’s coalition remained solid.
“I’ll go check on Sarah.”
Again the tie-fighters target him and he only just clears another bolt as he gets up the ladder. Finally, the ladder starts to automatically retract, dragging him into the ship and to safety. Above him he sees Sam kneeling at the hatch and he hauls Bucky clear before slamming his palm on the switch to close it. Sam yells, “Get us out of here!”
“Don’t know if that’s a compliment or not.” He’s still shivering under Tony’s touch.
“I will. I plan to.”
He did – for the most part during his imprisonment. Yet, he knows, deep inside, that he failed that test of faith in the system, in the Legion. When they strung him up, and beat him, when they took the sharp knives and sliced away at the growing wings, when they fractured the wings with clubs – he yelled, and screamed, and told them they were all cursed. He blurted out that he was a demon from Hell and their sins would burn them all. They hurt him for that, they threw gasoline on him and set his wings afire. Like a holy mantle they crackled and flared to life. He writhed in agony, cried out so loud and so long for help that he thought the blood vessels in his throat would pulsate and explode from the stress.
“Yes, yes, I mean that. What the hell does belay mean anyhow?” His handshakes as he holds onto the arm of the glasses. “Tell Jami he should belay the punishment order.”
Although she’s an adult, there was something desperate about her, something wounded that makes him think she’s younger than she looks. The way Steve talked to her, and about someone named Clint.
Tony stood in front of him, just inches away. “Let me show you. Let me just hold you for a second. For a breath.” Tony shook, quaked as he waited for Steve to answer. His fear struck the room into another silence.
“Our what?” Sam screwed up his face.
“What’s that?”
Natasha chuckles a little and sighs. When Steve raises a brow at her, she shrugs. “I mean I knew you two were staring into one another’s eyes all the time.”
“Whatever for?”
“But you didn’t know?” Sam prodded, but it was gentle and not intrusive.
Steve can’t help but snicker inwardly. He leads Tony over to the table with the different food, but before the prince picks anything to eat, Stane joins them.
“You didn’t need to use your cane. You just walked right to the cabin and locked the door.” Steve doesn’t move any further into the room.
Tony pats his chest. “Red and gold have always looked best on me.” He preens. Tony’s uniform has more gold threaded through it. The panels on the legs are gold as are the panels on the lower arms, almost mimicking gauntlets. A strip of fabric covers his palms and laces around to the back of his hand. Instead of a star on his chest there is a blue symbol that Steve doesn’t recognize.
“I never really wanted to forget my responsibilities,” Steven states. “Why did you embrace your responsibilities?” He says it almost like a threat or a challenge.
“What the fuck,” he mutters.
“Now, Captain, feel me,” he says and he lies down on top of Steve, their erections against one another, hard, heavy. The velvet hardness against him is almost too much to bear and he cries out to hold back his climax.
“I missed you too, Buck.” Logically Steve knows he’s talking to a phantom, but stopping, walking away – he can’t do it. “I want to find you. Bring you home.”
Tony doesn’t listen, he hurries out of the bedroom and disappears down the hallway. Steve hears him calling her, and she must stop out of pity or medical obligation. They share a whispered conversation that Steve cannot hear.
“Don’t have to tell me twice, Captain,” he replies. He knots the ropes onto the freshly made grappling hook. Once done he hands the entire ensemble over to Steve. “You’ll need to climb up first. I need to close up the armor. I can’t climb in it.”
Tony turns away from the crew and he’s only centimeters from Jamison. “Say it.”
Steve shifted in the shackles. He wanted Ross gone, he wanted to close his eyes and dream of Tony. He didn’t want to listen to the confessions of a madman.
Steve lies down on the bed; eyes closed. “Doesn’t matter. I should listen to Bucky and not drink.” He hears a snicker in the background. “Tell Bucky he’s a jerk.”
“Well, Shuri seems to know her stuff,” Tony remarked but left it there. Steve appreciated the non-confrontational way Tony brought up the facts. It helped. So much had happened that adjusting to the changes wouldn’t be easy.
“It says here that telling anyone including family anything that pertains to Mister Stark directly leads to termination of the contract and injunction.”
Off to the kitchen. Tony races up the stairs and slides into the kitchen only to find Steve with his face nearly pressed up against the microwave watching the popcorn bag expand. “Whoa there nelly, get your face away from that. You’ll go blind.”
“He knows you’re blind, right?” Going for the stupid smart remark to impress the boss Steve cringes again. He’s going to get fired.
“Well, things are nasty here, bud. You will not believe it, but after the Swarm Offensive failed, they pulled the entire fleet back from the secondary boundary. I’m worried if we’ll be able to defend the sector. But lucky me, I got assigned to the same regiment as the Captain! You know, Sam Wilson. We’re gonna be working together. Can you fucking believe it? The Captain and the Wolf. We’re gonna be a legend.”
“Before I go, I wanted you to know that they really hoped you would do it, that you would go and get him back.” He gave Tony that half smile that rounded his already round face. “Maybe if you had looked at the data on the drive.”
“No. I’m good.”
“Sure is. Don’t expect this for August.”
Steve wasn’t lying when he said he was good with his hands. He weaves the wire through the slots and works it into the core as Tony directs. Their foreheads are nearly touching as they work. It takes time to get every wire in place. Tony tells him where each belong, and then he’s able to sew the wires to the right housing. After, he twists each into place and finally, that task is complete. By the time they are finished, Tony settles back on his stool and looks wan, and quakes a bit.
Tony snickers. “But trouble is your middle name.”
Steve doesn’t resist, only rests on the edge of the bed, testing the movement of his wings. He studies them for the first time. During his imprisonment, his wings had been scorched, broken, mutilated. Now, the days have allowed his wings to begin their transcendence. Feathers, white with golden highlights, sprout. They are soft and the slightest touch sends lovely shivers up Steve’s spine. He would very much like Tony to touch his wings again. He tries to push away those thoughts, he shouldn’t have those thoughts. Not now when a Collapsing Event is upon them.
Tony vows to always be there for Steve. Always hold him steady. Because he knows if Steve has to be the strong one, always holding the world on his shoulders like Atlas, then he’s going to break. He’s not going to be anchored where and when he needs to be - the here and now. If Tony ever fails him, ever leaves him, Steve will be unmoored. Lost within the sea of time and space. He’ll have nowhere to go, because Tony is his anchor. If Tony’s gone, Steve is lost. Tony promises himself to never leave Steve, never let that happen. He promises.
“Yeah, yeah, but listen, you gotta think about it. You need to let Stark go,” Bucky says.
When he asked what else happened, her face paled and she shifted her gaze away from him to the floor. “You don’t want to know, Sentinel. There’s been a lot of things I’ve done in my life, a lot of red in my ledger, but that – what he was doing to your Jedi it shouldn’t be done to anyone.”
Bruce only shook his head. “Just feelings.” He pressed his lips into a tight line and then said, “You know you aren’t alone.”
Steve jolts to find Loki standing in full regalia behind him. His horned helmet glitters in what looks like early morning fog. The dew drops glisten as if in some mocking poetry. He’s holding his staff – the same staff they harvested the mind stone. He tilts the staff, and the chains fall free. Part of his mind rebels at the sight, the other part remains curious. Loki had always been a strange villain of the story if Steve had to confess. A character of mischief but cruelty all the same.
“But he wasn’t, was he?” Tony says and he strokes his hand through Steve’s hair.
Natasha held up her hand as if to ward off a barge of questions. “We want to tell you Tony, but you have to give Doctor Strange a chance to explain.”
When they enter the front doors, Steven pauses and then asks, “If you don’t mind, I’d like to have a few minutes. Alone.”
“I do. I loved being with you.” Even as the words tumbled out of his mouth he realized what he’d said.
"I've got responsibilities."
“Yes, sir, I do,” Clint said and never took his eye off Steve.
“Sir, I must remind you that much of that is fantasy and not truth.”
As he works on prying the thing off, he speaks in low tones to Steve. "It's gonna be okay. I'm here now. You're going to survive this. We'll go to our old hang outs. You know get Dumdum some booze and watch him fall over backwards into the ravine."  The words jumble in his throat as he becomes more and more desperate to get the metal cage off of Steve. It isn't budging even a tiny bit. Under him as he struggles, Steve shudders with every movement and twist of the vile metal cage. Cursing, Bucky looks for the straps, or buckles, or locking mechanism. What he finds sends him to the bucket in the corner to vomit.
“That’s tricky,” Steve replies, deciding to go with the flow rather than against it. “Ultron might have more working knowledge than we do in some cases.”
It takes some doing. Tony sends a letter of introduction to Schmidt's ranch, something that Steve couldn't conceive of, even though Tony told him that it would be disrespectful for Schmidt not to entertain one of the wealthiest men in America at his home - regardless of what he thought of Tony's lifestyle. Once Schmidt receives the letter, delivered by express post from Doom's office, he immediately replies that he would be greatly pleased to invite Tony and his party to the ranch for an extended stay. Tony only smiles and raises his eyebrow when he sees the invitation, and kisses Steve on the cheek while he takes his afternoon rest on the back porch. Tony winks and immediately swings into action. Of course, Steve would be one of his entourage.
Stunned, Steve stands back. He watches as the ambulance is loaded and Tony fights on the gurney. It’s the first flush of emotion that Steve’s witnessed from Tony since the doctor gave him the medication. It gives him a touch of hope. Strange heads to the ambulance to ride to his clinic while Pepper and Happy go to a car parked on the tarmac. Happy waves for Steve to tag along and directs him to sit in front with him. Steve does, but he’s on pins and needles after Pepper’s accusation.
“It depends on what the truth is. It is not generally believed that Icarus flew too close to the sun in reality.”
“I need antibiotics to keep this clean and to clear out the infection.”
“Oh fun, more shopping.” Steve groans while Tony unties his drawstrings and loosens his pants.
“No,” he says and he’s not sure he has the strength to continue this conversation. “Bucky?”
“I don’t get Howard. Yeah, he was a cad when I knew him, but he turned into such a-.” Steve stops like he’s at a loss for words.
Luke laughs and shakes Tony’s shoulder -which startles him and the guards, but their tense reaction means nothing to the big man at all. “You are going to be a great customer. I have a backroom you might be interested in.”
“Hello, Tony,” he parrots back and something inside of him bursts open. It isn’t an ember of hope, but a conflagration.
Over the course of the next days, Steve successfully avoids Bucky. The business of full delegations of officials from all of the major Corporations, Guilds, and Territories keeps him overwhelmed, as well as gives him a good excuse to use when Bucky beats down his door looking for him.
Tony looked up then after faceplanting on the roof and saw a glimmer of someone else. Not too distant another figure, a person materialized out of the steaming haze around him. The person – no, the skeleton – hung on the cross, crucified. Some ragged flesh hung like dirty clothes off the boney frame. The hair blew in the light breeze and then the thing – it moved. It turned its head toward Tony. No eyes, no nose, no lips, but long fangs identified it as a vampire. Somehow, some supernatural force helped it make a noise, so inhuman and pitiful – sounding so much like prey being devoured by a vicious predator that Tony shrank away from it.
Tony stared blankly into the darkened room. He saw nothing, but the pain cleaved in his chest. “You go, who will come back?”
His gland.
“In your bed?” Steven asks as if he thinks that Tony means to have him sleep on the floor. It wouldn’t be the first time. Any time Tony sleeps in the presentation room, Steven has a pile of blankets on the floor at the foot of the bed to curl up on and sleep – like a dog. Tony flinches at the thought. He never meant to be cruel – or did he? He learned everything, how to act, what to do – all from Estane.
Someone hustles Tony to his feet and forces him to dress as they chain Steven. Pants and a shirt is all they allow Tony – no shoes. Tony tries to resist but he gets a punch in the face for his efforts which are meager at best.
Steve presses his lips together, biting back a response that would only serve to depreciate himself.
“Very good!” Pepper says. “Now let’s work on-.”
Steve presses fingers into his eyes until he sees stars. “I am. In Canada on an island off the coast of Newfoundland.”
“It’s Admiral Jamison An’Rhodes.” He offers Steven a hand. “Please to meet you, finally.”
Tony stopped him with a finger to his lips. “We do have shared life experiences, Steve. We do. I’ve wanted that connection too. Every damned day. I wanted it.”
Steve agrees with Tony. He clasps on, though it’s not in a physical sense. They arrive at the Hub and it’s plainly
A slow smile curved over Tony’s mouth. “Okay, I get it. Don’t have to overdo it.”
He was still angry. The horror of what he’d learned lingered. It was a bad taste forever marring his feelings surrounding Bucky Barnes. One thing he could admit. “I can’t have him here. Not here. Not now. I have to process this.”
A shadow moves close to him and Blu stands there, dropping two hares on top of Tony.
“I have a feeling it’s his love life.” That’s Bucky, always straight to the point.
Steve smiles. He remembers a time that Peggy once said that to him. He went to his doom knowing it was the best thing to do. He’s  always tried to do the right thing. And now he’s not sure what that is anymore. Right now, he’s going to do what is best – again. What is best for everyone – and entanglements is not one of them. “This is for the best.”
The leader tilts his head and then Steve tries again in pigeon Farsi. It comes out broken and unintelligible as far as he can tell, but the leader waltzes over to Tony. He shakes him once but Tony doesn’t respond. It alarms Steve, he hadn’t realized how far gone Tony is or that his health is in jeopardy.
“No. No, not at all.” Tony hears him lick his lips.
“Why didn’t you know?”
The engines screamed to life and then their conversation ended. Tony heard Steve talking into the comm-link. “Meet at the rendezvous point in three hours. We take Strucker tonight.”
When Steve acknowledged Bucky this time, he recognized a fear in his friend’s expression that he’d only seen on infrequent occasions – those times married up with events that happened to be when Steve was sick. With a nod of his own, Steve agreed. “Where can we talk in private?” He didn’t want an audience for this – not for this at all.
“Yes, sent it like you told me.”
“Well, he always likes to make a big deal about donating. It’s a way to get his money for the Foundation. Oh and the Odinsons from Norway. They are big on clean energy,” Pepper finishes.
“Did you love Dany Carbonelli so much that he was forced to send you away? Is that what really happened? Why he sent you to the Omega Uprising? You loved him and his wife couldn’t handle it. He loved you back, your alpha loved you,” Tony says and thinks about how many traditions that sentence breaks in modern society. It isn’t like others haven’t had feelings for their omegas, but it isn’t a relationship like that – it isn’t about love. He’s been told that a thousand times. “Tell me.”
“What the fuck for?” Over the line Tony hears a scrambling and then a huff and panting. Barnes is running. “I’m coming over there.”
“But dimensions aren’t other realities.”
“Just a few minutes. Lucky you were right outside the city. It took me no time to get there once the call went out.” Tony must have signaled the armor to open because he stepped out of it and stood next to the bed. Close but not close enough to touch.
Ross chuckles at Steve’s words. He’s reclining in the chair, not sitting forward and not confronting them. “I’m not here to make this more difficult than it needs to be.”
He needed time to process. “I just need some time to process.” A deep ache filled him and he pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Take care of him, okay?” Tony said as he dropped his hand. “I need to go.”
“Shit,” Steve says. He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes. If the Captain reported Bucky’s status as MIA, it means it’s serious. It also means that while Steve’s been literally fucking around, Bucky’s dead or worse. He finds hot tears streaming down his face and he wipes them violently away. If he’d been a better man, a stronger man, not a weak sickly man, then maybe, just maybe Bucky would be safe.
Steve tentatively places his hand in Tony’s hair. “If we didn’t have this bond then-.”
“No, not like a two year old, but like my omega.”
“Turkey please.”
Tony peers into the boiling pot of thin broth. “I’m sorry to break it to you but that’s not a nice Bordelaise.”
“About your omega or the chair?”
“Okay,” she said, and Tony knew she didn’t believe him.
In between bouts of the blinding white light and the tugging on his soul that turns to thorns netted under his sternum, Steve listens to the story of a life that seems foreign but familiar.
“I don’t want you to go,” Tony said, not realizing he’d spoken out loud until his voice echoed in their bedroom.
JARVIS projects the sea around him and the main table where Steve and the prince ate breakfast a few short hours ago. The water looks like a living thing and JARVIS has it so that it isn’t mid-day but near sunset on some foreign planet. The planet’s sun melts into the horizon line of the water and the ripples around him move with his motions. The blues and oranges remind him of the nebula, but it is so much richer. “Where is this JARVIS?”
“I can’t get anything by you,” Tony says and picks up his hand, kissing the knuckles. “Now try a cherry.” He picks it up by the stem and dangles it in front of Steve. “My chef is amazingly brilliant. Try it.” Every word is ordinary, plain, but every word seduces with his tone.
Tony wasn’t sure they succeeded, because Steve stood up and moved away from their touches, their embrace of him. His soul was shut and distant. He walked to the window and stared out. “Okay.” It sounded cold, bereft of feeling.
“Oh, we know about the Falcon!” Cooper said. “Is it hard landing, because I don’t see how that bird suit is aerodynamic.” His eyes glittered with enthusiasm and Steve could see Sam having a hard time keeping himself in check. It was adorable to see Sam on the other end of the adoration.
The slight pulse from Bucky reminded Tony how alone and desperate he must be – Tony considered Steve – thrust into the 21st century, told to fight aliens, joined up with an agency that ended up being his darkest enemy, and then forced to finally face his own orientation. How fucking messed up would that make anyone? On top of all of that he ended up the leader of a band of misfits in a soul pack.
“Yeah,” Steve said and sniffled as he looked at the brand on Bucky’s flesh. “Sorry, I-.” He hissed. “Nat keeps telling me to not apologize, but I feel like I should every time it happens without the other person’s consent.”
Ross ignores him. “Steven Rogers you are stripped of your military rank and will be remanded into the custody of the Department of Defense for questioning.”
“What?”
“Who?” Something in the back of Tony’s soul prickles and hurts. “Who?”
“I feel spectacular, Captain,” Tony says and claps his hands, then spreads them out as he spans the view behind the house. “Look at this, how gorgeous this is.”
“You’re surrounded, Silver. It’s time to lay down your weapons and surrender.”
“There’s nothing to be done,” the doctor says.
“Well not technically. It’s called the vivarium. But us guards we have our own lingo.” He gave them a toothy smile and Tony clenched his jaw. Just what the hell had his father been experimenting with. Tony knew of his fascination with the super soldier serum, and his quest to replicate it. Did he actually do it? Did his collaborations with the Soviets lead to some hybrid animal pumped up full with super soldier serum and blasted with vita rays.
Gently, Steve cups Tony’s hand, eases the drink out of his grasp and then drains it himself. He grimaces at the burn. He never liked hard liquor. “Now I’m your little bit of poison.”
“We could try and get the Quin Jet to fly,” Steve suggests.
Steve and Tony grow closer. Tony feels like he's finally figured out the pack and what it means to be Beloved. Of course, that only works if there aren't unknowns to be considered....
“Let’s sit on the pier for a little while. I just want to listen to the waves,” Tony says, and Steve agrees. They sit down on the edge of the pier. Tony closes his eyes and feels the pelt of the cold air on his face. “It’s amazing how much we can lose and how much we can gain.” He knows he’s being oblique. Maybe Steve will see through him. “Sometimes, it’s hard to see the good through the bad.”
“This isn’t a battlefield, Cap,” Fury says.
“Okay, now enough,” Laura ended the discussion on purple aliens.
“You can’t say that,” Natasha replied. Her eyes fiercely dark – almost black. “His powers will grow over the years and he won’t know it. He could lash out and hurt you.”
“What? You mean through telepathy?” Tony crossed his arms over his chest as if to protect himself. “You said it didn’t work that way.”
Before Steve knows what’s happening, they’re kissing. He’s not sure who moved first or initiated it, but something deep inside releases as if all this time he’d been carrying around a weight inside and now it’s gone, allowing him to breath.
“You’re nothing else but your biology as well. You’re nothing but a playboy. I read the file. I know what you are.”
“Kill their enemies, of course.”
“That’s true. I should tell you that I informed him of everything I knew about your relationship and what transpired. He knows.”
“The original episode had images from Earth’s history, this-.”
“Sometimes. Later today, we’re taking the boat out just to tool around. It’s his day off, and I think he’s getting a little cabin fever. You can take the boy out of New York City, but you can’t take the New York City out of the boy.” While boating isn’t his favorite thing to do since he went blind, he’s willing to give it a try. He’ll take his motion sickness meds just in case. Having no frame of visual reference makes boating especially hard for him.
While it is odd for the system to not update about a certain person due to distance and time, it’s especially off for the notification system to actually send an alert about it. He frowns and taps his implant a second time.
“You ran them or did someone else?” Steve asks.
Once through those massively thick and ornately carved doors, Steve finds a waiting room with plush leather chairs and a few dark wood tables. There aren’t any magazines to read but a few textbooks on neurology and other biomedical sciences are on display. Steve wonders if the good doctor expects them to want to sit and wait and read graduate level textbooks. He frowns but then a woman appears from a side door and ushers them to an examining room. He has no idea how she knew they were there and then spies the small cameras embedded in the walls. The place is creepier than he assumed.
Now, Tony’s sitting up straighter. “Nanites.” This is his kind of territory, he understands nanotechnology.
“Must have been terrible,” Tony says and his words gentle Steve’s throbbing nerves. “You can mourn, Steve.”
“What does that mean?” Bruce says and he’s getting a little green around the gills.
Steve fell onto the bed. “I feel like something inside of me is fighting to get out. It’s taking all of my strength away.” His shoulders and arms, his legs, everything loosened and slumped as he sat there on the bed.
And in the center of the light, focusing it all – is Ultron.
None of it makes sense. What Pepper confessed to him – Tony’s nightmares, Tony’s memories being tainted with Ultron’s version of events, Tiberius as Tony’s intended, Tony requesting Steve as his bodyguard. It all plays into a complicated mess that Steve needs to tease apart. He thinks if he’s unable to do it, more than just a former Courtesan’s marital status will be at stake, maybe even his life.
“Oh yeah, like the last time when you got knifed and ended up in bed for three weeks with a raging fever. I’ve been at your bedside enough when we were just young’uns to know that you need your rest.”
“Having a party! End of the summer, gonna be a big smash hit.”
Steve thinks about it, about how Tony said something about exclusivity early on, but never brought it up again. “I don’t know. It really hasn’t come up. I’m not trying to push it. I still have like 5 days left including today.” He really should dig for more information on Loki and Thor. Tony needs it especially since the Conclave is desperate for strong allies. “Are Thor and Loki leaving?”
“Our great man of iron has been captured by the past,” Thor said and clenched his fist as if he held Mjolnir. “We must ease the blow and help him accept what has happened.”
He needs Bruce to tell him to settle down and take his punish for inventing a killer robot. He needs Pepper to show him there’s something redeemable about his soul. He needs JARVIS to tell him when to sleep, when to eat, when to breathe.
Working night and day hadn’t saved his mother but he picked a different career choice now after he saw what happened to her. Steve tried everything to earn enough money to pay for the augmented lungs for his mother, but in the end, he’d only managed to save enough for the flight. His mother died and he left – left behind the Brooklyn Regional settlement and ventured further into the center of human civilization.
This revelation stopped Tony in his tracks and he asked, "Who?  I thought you were a free agent."
“You know what they say about good intentions, right?” Tony says but his words are light and soft like the breezes kissing the trees. He squeezes Steve’s hand. “I know, Steve. I’m sorry too. I overreacted the first day. I shouldn’t have. This is a big adjustment for me.”
“Why you think your life will be over if you cannot see, I don’t know.” Jarvis squeezes his shoulder. “You are a remarkable man, Anthony. One who the world looks up to and asks to lead. You are much more than your sight.”
Steve grimaces. Ultron’s not keeping up the charade, not like before so he must be getting nervous. Or whatever the equivalent might be for an artificial intelligence. It must be based on algorithms and scenarios evaluation. The probability of Steve and Tony getting out of this thing and shutting Ultron down has to be increasing to have the AI showing his face. He’s trying to off balance Steve. The cat and mouse game of hiding Tony on this rim shows it. Steve’s sure of it.  He wishes Tony was here.
Tony leans down and, before he tastes and kisses, he murmurs, “I do.”
“Nice,” Steve says, quelling Tony’s fears. “Even with the skulls.”
“Do you think someone in the factions is plotting against him?” Steve asks as they enter the lift to the lounge.
“That’s what people assume,” Steve mutters but keeps at it.
“Don’t worry I thought of that, too.”
“My omega, Steven,” Tony says.
Blu muffles his disdain as he settles into the water, shaking his head to scatter the water droplets.
“But Ana? Isn’t she your chef?”
“Yes, you do.”
WARNING – this chapter contains graphic depictions of self-harm.
“What do you mean? Not a free man?” Steve furrowed his brows as he glanced at Clint.
Fumbling, grappling for purchase he grasped the side of the window frame, feeling the raw edges of the glass bite into his hands, but it didn’t matter. He dragged his body upward, throwing his weight forward to get his center of gravity into the room and not pointed down toward the pavement below in the alley way. He juddered as he got back into the room; his legs wobbled and he couldn’t stay upright as he took in the scene.
The glamour, now always part of Steve, focused his attention to Tony. Steve worried he’d lost his free will to Tony, but then again, Tony constantly fretted over it. Though, as Steve drove toward the safe house and mulled over the story Clint related to him, Steve weighed what he knew and what he believed about Tony.  Trying on the doubts tightened his shoulders and strung his chest into fits. He loved Tony, they’d shared so many secrets and hopes. They even talked about a time in the future where mates were accepted. Where they could live out in the open. Natasha warned him
He turns to the man. "My help? No one needs my help, doctor."
He sighs, and then goes to the door across the hallway. He hits the buzzer that flashes the lights. Clint opens the door almost immediately.
“I’m fine. A little mortified that I couldn’t keep us on our feet, but otherwise just a little wounded pride.”
“I have a feeling I didn’t help much.”
“If you say so, sir.”
“Well, considering the latest I needed something to calm down and reflect.”
Steve pushes himself back up to a sitting position. It costs him but he fumbles to sit up. “I’m not human.”
“Suit can handle that, right?” He doesn’t wait for an answer. He veers downward as Hunter aims directly at the cat. Tony impacts with the lion’s back. His shoulder panels open and he spreads a suppressing fire in the direction of the hunter at the same time he gets arms around his magnificent mane. “Lift us off, J!”
Upon his father’s death, Tony Stark became the leader of the Western Clan. His first order of business? To find the ultimate stock, to feed on the frozen body of Captain America, Steve Rogers, for the rest of his unnaturally long life.
He nodded.
“What are we doing here, Steve? What’s going on?” Sam asked.
“I mean this isn’t the worse place to get stuck. It’s gorgeous and look at the view!” Steve points to the wide sliding glass doors that open to the wooden deck. Beyond the deck rolling hills and pine trees dot the landscape. It’s a veritable winter wonder land and Tony hates it. Meanwhile Steve’s digging in his duffle bag and bringing out sketchbooks and graphite pencils. “I haven’t sketched in an age. This is perfect for it.”
Bruce stared ahead and the violet blue sky with the glimmering lights. Even now Tony still marveled at the sights, the beauty of the night that blind humans could not see. Tony waited for an answer and Bruce offered none. So Tony tried a different tactic. “Are you going to stay with me or someplace else?”
The Red Knight drops down from his unheavenly perch in the skies. The Outriders shuffle and move aside for him. He wears a red helmet that covers his hideous face. Gold and red metallic accents flicker in the harsh light of the Realm. His chest plate glows blue.
“Not bad,” Tony said. “Wish it was a little more romantic.” He dropped his bag. “I would have liked to make your first time more memorable.”
When Steve returns, Tony’s already in bed with a tumbler of amber liquid in his hand and a book laying on his lap. “A little tonic to ease my worried mind.”
“Oh, yes, very secretive, the large – what is it twelve, fifteen foot wing span you got going on there?” Tony says and holds Steve upright. “Tell me soldier boy, can you fold them?”
“A lot of the old world was plagued with falsehoods and exaggerations. You should know better,” Tony says and he tires of the ridiculous conversations. “On your knees, Omega.”
The prince shakes his head. “Why don’t we both sit, and we serve each other?”
Steve leaned down as Tony opened his jeans. When he released his cock, Tony sighed as the tension race through him. Steve met Tony’s eyes and then tentatively swept downward, kissing along the way, setting Tony on fire. Steve teased Tony with a simple lick as if attempting to figure out what to do next. He licked again and again until Tony had his hands planted on the bed and his hips rising to meet Steve.
The enormity hits Tony like a plasma laser to the chest. “Steve, no. No, why have you denied yourself? All this time. Surely, Doctor Erskine couldn’t have foreseen everything that’s happened in the world. Wouldn’t he have been open to new things, learning new thoughts on the subject?”
It turns out that Alpha Privilege only gets them so far. Tony doesn’t admit it to Steve, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out one of the reasons it takes so long for them to leave Korea is because of the negotiations. Steve wants to warn Tony against playing the cat and mouse game with Secretary Ross, but that ship sailed ages ago and neither one of them fared well.
“I don’t think so,” Tony says, his eyes hold a dark mystery to them as if he understands pain and horror. “Look, I am sorry for bringing it up.”
Steve directs his attention to the ridge where they first identified a potential safe haven.  The wind stirs up the lightly powdered snow cover over the icier sheets below it. It’s difficult to make out the details. “Do you see something?”
“Shouldn’t you be resting, sir?”
Steve scoffs at Fury and then pulls up the assignment list once more. “What can I do for you, director?”
name them, or you will suffer immeasurable pain as will they.”
If he cuts the entire thing out, he’ll never go into heat again, never bond again, never want anyone ever again. He flexes his hands, itching for a knife. If it’s the only way, he’ll do it.  That will be the end of it, he’ll no longer ache for the knot, for the heat, for Tony.
“It seems that the vest malfunctioned when he was hit and delivered a shock twice the normal setting. Minor burns to the chest, though. He is unconscious.”
They eat in silence, that Tony cannot say is companionable, but at least it’s not adversarial. After he finishes the broth, Tony puts the bowl aside and picks the bread apart, eating it. “Tell me, the story of Captain Steve Rogers.”
“If you insist on being ignorant, then I suppose I will have to teach you a lesson.” Even as he spoke, Strange put his one hand out and started a circular motion with his other hand. Sparks of gold fanned out. “Wong, if you please?”
Tony saw the sketches that Steve did before, so the words are on the tip of his tongue, but he sucks back -
“Well, you have to understand it if you want to watch the next one.” Tony sees the ring on Steve’s finger. Tony’s wearing his as well, but that’s only because he went out in public. “You know you don’t have to wear it all the time.” He indicates the wedding ring.
Racing down the nearest trail, Steve longs for his backpack. He’d have more options for defense and offense. Another shot comes dangerous close to his head, the spray of the stone peppers his already injured cheek and he nearly loses his footing due to the pain. He battles for balance and throws the shield at the same time, knowing full well it won’t hit its target. The Iron Man armor bashes the shield away and blasts Steve with the unibeam. It hits him full in the gut, stealing his breath and hurling him into the wall. The answering electric shock doubles the pain, and he tastes blood in his mouth. He collapses to the ground, hand pinned to his bleeding gut. The Iron Man armor stalks him. His vision blinks in and out. He fights for consciousness. Ultron raises his arm and Steve knows nothing more.
Tony interrupted Bruce to ask, “So what makes it not work?”
“I don’t know, Secretary,” said the tall, bald scientist.
“No sir, he went with Master Jamison and Administrator Harry without a word or battle.”
White lightning streaked across his vision and then he saw Tony, hanging on the cross on the roof of the Triskelion. Light radiated from the metal skewer in his chest as he bowed his head. Steve approached him. He was dressed as if he was an honored member of the V-Corps. He crouched down low and studied Tony. He reached for the skewer, touching the warmth of the light. It felt like the rays of the sun on a summer day. He smiled and then met Tony’s gaze as he lifted his head.
Tony grumbles. “I’m not asking you where it’s kept, I’m asking where it came from?”
“Not going to debate it, glad to be alive.”
“They weren’t hurting me,” Steve muttered and went to the side table and picked up his track pants. He slipped them on and then pulled on a t-shirt. He had a large burn across his chest. It hurt like hell, but he only cringed as the shirt’s fabric touched it. He’d turned around to dress since he still wasn’t comfortable with sharing changing rooms with women, but that’s how they did it at SHIELD these days.
Tony shifts and abruptly is at Steve's feet, kneeling, hands on his knees. "I live an unconventional life, Captain, because I've seen what it means to come close to death. So have you, you've seen death, you've smelt the terror of it. So tell me Captain, tell me, will you continue on in your charade or will you follow down my path and lift the mask of convention."
“Yeah,” Steve says and looks to the side because he has a feeling Fury might have listed Bucky as one of the Howling Commandos on his rewrite of history. Bucky probably died in the fire fight.
If Tony is right and this is Captain America, then someone powerful is hunting him – that’s what it sounds like. “Your friends across the hall – they were in the Army or something with you?”
While he doesn’t know a ton about medicine or seizures, he’s pretty sure that valium is old school and a crappy option for treatment. Tony only eats any words he wants to say, because what can he say? “Is he going to be okay?”
“How do you create a pocket universe?” Bruce asks.
“How you doing, cowboy?” Tony asks. His voice is slightly louder. Gratefully, Steve notes it doesn’t pierce through his brain this time.
“Role playing?”
“Really?” Her smile made it all worth it. That and the idea that he didn’t have to face the stupid team that would probably become a soul pack without him.  Pepper’s smile reminded him of the sun over the Pacific as it set, her hair like the melting of the sun into the water’s horizon. Everything was better with Pepper. Why did he always have to try and undermine his own happiness by looking elsewhere?
It does.
“Are we so different?” Tony asked and there was a longing in his voice that mimicked the ache in Steve’s chest.
"Summer."
Tony pats Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t worry. It’s part of the deal.” He turns in the direction of Pepper. “Just go. Leave us boys to have some fun.”
“There’s a gas station across the road,” Steve says. “We should probably fill up.”
“You’re amazing, you know that. No one is ever going to believe me on this one.” Tony says and collects the rest of the armor. “Thanks. This will help me out.”
Intuitively, Steve reached out with one hand while keeping his other firmly on Sam’s torso. He grasped Tony’s hand and said, “I need more.”
“The opportunity to live freely. It’s a sad state of affairs when a nation built on the idea of individual’s freedom doesn’t actually live up to its perfect union idea.”
“Really?” Tony says and stops. “You weren’t with him since his first urgency?”
Steve rips his attention away from the beauty and focuses on Natasha. “I’m not a virgin if that’s what you’re asking.”
One thing that Tony’s learned over the years is that there are very few people he can trust. Rhodey and Pepper are two of the people he trusts the most, but at the same time two of the people who try and shield him from his own vulnerabilities and the outside world. While he takes it as a sign that they both love him and want nothing horrible to befall him, it frustrates him to no end because sometimes, he feels like they are plotting behind his back.  He’s not insulted by it at all; their actions are those of people who love him and fear for him. Truly, he’s surprised that Pepper even let him get a new personal assistant. If she could have, she would have doubled up as his assistant and the CEO of the company. But that wasn’t going to work at all.
Steve nods into the kiss and then steps back, to rip away Tony’s clothes. He’s not sure where the strength comes from, but he savages zippers, tosses away fabric and ravages his own clothes until they are both naked. The shower is already running when they step into it, Steve assumes JARVIS warmed it for them.
“And now?” Tony asked. He trespassed. Somehow he trespassed into secrets he shouldn’t know. Though the strange room he found himself in was small, he felt like the expanse of the universe opened up around him.
“I didn’t have a choice.” Clint rubbed at his eyes and turned away, not facing Tony.
Clint turned to Steve as he picked up his bow. “Just got a call from my better half. We better get our asses in gear because we have a job to do.”
The elevator across from the parking spot rang and both Steve and Clint turned to it. JARVIS announced the arrival. “Captain Rogers, it is good to see you. Sir is on his way.”
“Happy.” He hums a little. “Happy I always picture as a nervous Santa Claus. Lord, please don’t tell him. Please. He would be mortified.”
Steve drops his gaze, feels the warm ball of heat deep inside. He smiles and wishes he could bear better news. “I won’t be able to, I have a commitment to go out and find Loki and Clint, my deputy.”
“The only question is,” Natasha said. “Are we going in to neutralize the Hydra base or are we going in to get out pack mates?”
“Please, please. Touch me.”
“Maybe,” Natasha picked up her fries but left the rest of the burger. “You want?” He only raised an eyebrow. “Of course you do. Does your whole salary go for food?” She stood up, readying to leave.
“Do you even know who your competition might be?” Stane’s gaze hardens.
“So not to change the subject at all, but do you have any plans for today?” He plucks a strip of bacon from his plate and bites it.
Steve doesn't reply but goes to the door and waits as the thugs blast through the door. Tony doesn't remember blocking it, but then again this day has been strange; he assumes their female visitor had something to do with it. He hears a long scream in Farsi and then a round of gunfire hitting the locking mechanism on the door. Steve crouches near the door, as if in his wounded state he'll be able to do anything.
He dreams. The images flash and promise. In waking hours, he thinks of them as nightmares but in truth he longs for these dreams, these hopes and prayers of a different time. In the dreams he has a family – of warriors against an evil with a red skull for a face. He’s a leader, a hero in these times, but he also dies in tidal wave of cold.  Sometimes he dreams of a different family. Sometimes he dreams he’s an outlaw, fighting against the injustice in the system. But mostly he dreams of the family – he might call them warriors but in the dream the family – his team – calls themselves the Avengers. He thinks it might be a silly name. What are they avenging he asks, but his team – the team he calls a family and he’s never seen their faces – doesn’t answer.
“What did you do to me? What did you do?” he mutters and lashes at Steve, though this time it’s weak and pathetic. His eyes close as the pain takes him to unconsciousness again.
“Nothing, just not that hungry,” Steve says and convulsively swallows.
Steve gives him a bashful grin. “Sorry I didn’t know the formula of the Pym particles. I did try and infiltrate Thanos’ fortress but that didn’t go so well. I figured he must know how to do Pym particles since he got his whole army here from 2014.”
“He used a milk bottle on you,” Tony says and there’s malice in his tone but also misery. “It shattered; it broke inside of you.”
“Sometimes it’s best to learn from the past,” Steve commented as he watched the two older men. They were deciding something – about him. How precarious his position was and what they intended to do about it would determine his future at the Corps. “The Corps are filled with good men and women. I hope I can continue.”
“I would,” Steve said and headed to the examination table only to stop, to pause in horror, too stunned with despair to make a sound. What lay on the table wasn’t human – not anymore – but the remnants of what had been his friend. Like a marionette puppet his limbs were barely attached to his torso – strings of ligaments, frail and thin, held them to Sam’s body. There was a hole in his chest – deep and wide. Someone had tried to patch it, but even the best medicine would never heal the wounds riddling his body. Half of his face – Steve cringed and turned away. It was a miracle that Sam still lived at all. Steve’s whole body shivered in sorrow and anguish.
“Whatever the link is,” Steve agreed. “Do you have an idea?”
“Less fun,” Bucky says and taps his metal finger along the polished console of Steve’s commander’s desk.
Tony steps in the path of the guards. “No. None of that. He won’t try and escape. You have my word.”
Pepper stood up next to her and said, “We don’t like to discuss-.”
He rubs at his head to cover his mistake and nods a little, though he stretches out of the way to make sure his charge, Tony Stark, can’t look for a bump. “I’m okay. Where’s my shirt?”
Stane turns on his heel and leaves the workshop, only the distant rumble of the ship’s internal engines fills the airwaves. Steve sits slouched against the wall, stunned, paralyzed, and a little angry. He tells himself he’s not ashamed of what he does. He’s doing it for a reason, and he’s good at it. Someday he’ll be free of having to use his body as a means to an end. There’s an honesty to the work he’s doing, he knows this – he accepts this, but right now, he feels dirty.
“What?” Bruce perked up. “I don’t know how to get there. I’ve never been there. How would I know.”
“We might not solve the riddle of the implant, but I can tell you I am not interested in getting rid of you. You’ve helped me with the migraines, you’ve been there with the panics attacks I get. You’re a good PA. I get that dealing with the media can make you run at the mouth and you didn’t mean what you said.”
“No shit. But that’s not going to do us a world of good against Ultron and his army.”
“My data files identify it as the Caribbean Sea on Earth. It is one of the last files before the planet was abandon due to environmental catastrophe.”
Tony paces the floor, hands on hips. “No. There is. There’s a lot I can do and I’m just not. I don’t want to become my father, but fuck if I’m not damned to do it. Why is it like this? Why do people do this kind of shit.” He rants on, talking as if to the air instead of Steve. “How long are we as a people going to treat each other like commodities instead of precious living beings?” He twists a lock of that beautiful hair so tightly Steve cringes. “I told you I spent time in The Cat’s Run.” He doesn’t wait for Steve to answer, just forges ahead like a train on broken tracks. “Fuck, I saw things there. People doing things to other people for profit. It disgusted me. I nearly fucking died there. And here we are at the most advanced station in the whole of the Conclave, and we can’t get over the class system. At all.” He grumbles, then seems to see Steve for the first time. “Get ready. We’re going shopping.”
“Good, Natalie is a good place to start,” Tony says. “How about Asgard? Have we heard from them?”
“Just me, Steve, we have a problem. Bucky’s back and.” Natasha stops, and clears his throat as if it is difficult to say the next words. Without thought, Steve sits up and Tony rolls off to the other side of the bed. “Clint didn’t make it.”
“What? What’s happening?” Tony asks.
“I do, I do!” Steve snapped and then closed his eyes. “Sorry.” He opened his eyes and placed his untouched glass on the table as well. Staring down at his hands, hands that had only just healed – miraculously healed – Sam. “If I could place these hands on the whole of my nation, the world, I would. If I knew how to heal it, I would.”
“We have a problem, a big one,” Steve said. “We have to get back to the site of the crash. Now, immediately.”
Clothes selected, Steve heads back to the bathroom. He showers and cleans himself, checking to shave here and there. He shaves his face and puts on the special lotion Natasha made him purchase. His skin feels silky smooth yet with enough roughness that it’s no mistaken he’s a man. He fills the plug with the allotted lube and then considers Tony’s offer of the nanites. It’s intriguing, but tonight is not supposed to be about him, his needs, or technology. It’s about unwinding a stressed man and showing him that he’s cared for.
“You do,” Tony said. He could have thrown a flippant remark but he didn’t. He kept his hand touching Steve, and then leaned down to meet his gaze as he opened his eyes. “You’re not alone.”
Tony shifted and sat up on top of Steve. The way he moved showed not only his own comfort with his body but also with Steve’s as well. Steve envied that ease. Tony ran his hands down Steve’s chest. “Let me tell you something. Sex isn’t about what to put where, not if you want it to mean something. It isn’t about putting your leg here or your hand there, or if I want to touch you like this.” He caressed his hand along Steve’s side and down to his groin, lightly stroking his hardening erection. “It’s about what we both want. It’s about what you think feels good and what I think feels good and if we can give that to one another.”
He stroked a gentle hand through Steve’s hair as he knelt at Tony’s side. The chaos of the scene around him exploded, but Tony kept his fingers tangled in his Submissive’s hair. Up until this moment in time, no one guessed that Captain America was a Submissive, especially not the fact that Captain America – the paragon of virtue – was Tony Stark’s Submissive.
There’s a clean towel by the side of the basin and Steve washes off the dust from the road and the stink of the horses. In the small room there’s also a tub that’s large enough for a man. The water from the well is cold and Steve wonders if Stark bathes in the frigid mountain waters that supply the underground aquifers for their in town wells and irrigation system.
“Water.”
Talk of the Brothel and their business ethic doesn’t faze Tony. “That’s the reason why I only use the Widow. Natasha is a smart businesswoman. She keeps everyone in line, even the clients. Swear that woman has her own secret assassins.” For a second, Steve can’t tell if the prince is joking or not, but then he winks at Steve again and it relieves the tension.
“Questions about who you were?”
“Hey? What’s going on?” Tony murmured.
Steve frowns. It makes no sense. Why here? Why now? And then he studies Tony – is it really Tony? Could it be another mirage of Ultron’s? Steve leans over and grunts for the effort, but he reaches out all the same, reaches out to touch Tony. “You?”
“Yeah?” Tony asks and his eyes get a dreamy look. He jerks away from his thoughts and then points to where Steve left the folded towel on the opposite counter. “Jarvis hates when people fold a wet towel. Put it in the laundry bin or hang it up.”
Doubt flitters over the prince’s expression, but Steve remains stoic. Clearing his throat, Tony shifts his attention to Obie. “Listen, Obie, I think I’m going to call it. Pepper and Rhodey can represent me during the lunch. Would you please tell everyone that I’m ill and need the afternoon to rest?” He doesn’t wait for Obie to respond, instead he returns to Steve. “Let’s go. I think I need some help.”
The world came crashing down.
Steve feels the heat rush to his face and he can’t keep eye contact with his host, regardless of how humiliated it makes him feel to look away.
“Knew?” He focused completely on her. Her exuberance lit the room.
Tony stopped and stared at Steve as if the acquiescence stunned him. He scratched at his head, messing his perfectly coifed hair a bit. Clearing his throat, he cocked an eyebrow and then said, “Okay then. Let me see the brand thing.”
He jerked and closed his eyes. They burned. “What? What?” He didn’t look at Bruce.
The high glass doors that line the one wall of the ballroom were open and Steven had ushered Tony to the balcony of the Council building. The groomed gardens below looked like shadows in the rectangular reflecting pool below them. Two moons were rising while a third was setting. Their pale light glimmered on the reflecting pools below, but Steven commanded attention.
“Most of the time,” Tony said. “I learned much of what I know today as an alpha from him. If the man wasn’t so obstinate and arrogant I would have a place in my house for him. He’s even the one who encouraged me to find out what it really meant to be an alpha on the loose.”
It made sense. Full time medical staff wouldn’t have lot to do on a daily basis. Steve pointed behind him. “If that’s research staff, how does it work with this being a med-bay?”
“How long have you been without a bond?”
“Steve Rogers made Captain America who he is, I don’t think anyone else could do that,” Tony said as the doors to the elevator slid open. “It’s amazing.”
“Are we here for an Avengers meeting or for a meeting of the soul pack?” Strange jumped in, his irritation tainting his voice.
“Sorry, but there’s a lot to be done now. Peggy – she’s a close friend of mine – and her brother Michael work every damned day trying to feed the kids and the families. The guardsman compound closed down when the war came through – leaving no source of income, no food, no nothing. Brooklyn doesn’t grow enough or can’t grow enough to feed itself. The war is starvin’ everyone to death.” Steve bites back his words. He bows his head. “I’m sorry, my prince, I didn’t mean to speak out of turn.”
“It’s what they said.”
He jumps up, slamming the back of his head on the armor plating. “Shit! What?”
“Are you? Are you Tony Stark?” Steve asks because he doesn’t remember anything about wires from the dossier he read.
She leaves after he smiles and tells her he'd like to sleep now. He lies on his bed and stares at the ceiling. He counts the little dots on the ceiling tiles. He doesn't respond to them when they come in the room. He ignores the doctors and tries to drill down into his own head, searching for himself. He finds nothing. They move him to a private room in the psychiatric ward. He should be insulted, but he's anything but insulted. They allow him to wear thick robes and shuffle about in his slippers all day. He watches the television incessantly. He's hungry for it. There are so many wonders he's forgotten. The injury took away. He eats and sleeps the television. He reads magazines front to back even the advertisements. The doctors seem curious and observant. Lots of doctors shuffle by him, asking him questions, probing him. He feels like their lab rat. He ignores them for the most part.
“Better.” Steve assesses his condition. His voice is hoarse. “Surprised it took me so hard. I haven’t had an attack in months.”
“So many times, when I was next to you in the lab, listening to your ideas, trying to keep up with you to capture you were inventing, I would think about touching. Having the ability to touch you anywhere, everywhere,” Steve whispers, his voice shakes as if he’s unsure that Tony would welcome these words, this intimacy. He gently nudges the jacket off Tony’s shoulders and then takes it away. Tony hears it drop to the floor.  He reaches for Steve’s hand and finds it easily.
The press of Tony’s body over him, pushes his cock and his brain toward madness. He rubs his body against Tony’s trying to get the friction he needs, but then the prince pulls upward and hold them apart. Steve moans in protest. Tony rakes his hands down Steve’s chest, scraping nails against his nipples, running sharp callused hands against his ribs, toward his flank and making him squirm with need. Tilting his hips, Tony shoves and hits home. It sends Steve into the heavens and he screams out, wanting more. He’s greedy and hungry and filled at the same time. He grips Tony’s biceps and demands more. Tony fills his wish and thrusts with more power, his arms flexing under Steve’s hands. He moves with a sinuous strength that’s awe inspiring, thrilling, and terrifying. It coils deep in Steve’s groin and then that energy, that need spreads out into every nerve of his body until he’s vibrating with it.
“Jesus fucking Christ!” Every nerve in Tony’s body vibrated with horror and anger. “What the fuck! That’s a god damned human being!” He whipped around to face Rumlow and Sawyer. “That’s a man.” It was obvious the ‘creature’ was a man since he hadn’t been afforded any clothing.
“It would be good if we had some opponents, but since we do not, I think we must work in pairs and over a distance. In this way we may be able to coordinate and do these war games you wish,” Thor said and scooped up another bowl of pasta. Clint flinched and then stood up.
Steve stops before he leaves. “Brucie Bear?” Does Tony have a boyfriend that Steve never heard about? Steve swallows down the thickness in his throat and blames it on being exhausted.
He considered the answer and his heart throbbed in his chest. He couldn’t parse why and he swallowed it down. Steve had seemed open to the idea of bonding with Tony, had agreed but the universe found him lacking. Found Tony Stark, the genius and hero of the Battle of New York wanting. He wasn’t good enough. He brushed his thoughts aside though it left him with a cold chill in his bones., “So learning all his secrets?” Part of Tony wished that the answer would be no, that she would never know his failing, that Steve had rejected him and he couldn’t be part of their little clique.
Tony taps his way out of the suite of rooms. Steve waits a good five minutes to ensure that Tony doesn’t back track for anything. He jumps up and finds his phone in the backpack that someone must have dropped in the corner of the bedroom. He presses the icon for Sam.
“Yeah,,” Steve whispered, and Tony heard the crack in his voice at the same time that the reverberations from his soul wavered. “I have to save him, Tony. You know that, right?”
Steve smiles. “Sure you would, like you would like someone to steal your dog.”
Tony’s not sure who moves first but they both end up in Steve’s shower, slowly cleaning one another and eventually, Tony’s pressed up against the tiled wall and Steve’s exploring him with his tongue. It’s sends Tony into a blissful space – he’s never been in subspace but he’s not that far under as far as he can tell. His body longs for Steve’s touches, his tongue, his hands, his lips. It’s as if they were made for one another.
“Yes. Blu means the world to me. Helped me feel safe.” He touches Steve’s shoulder. “But now I think someone else needs him. I want you to have him.”
Tony leaned up to Steve and whispered, “Think it would be okay if we leave? Just for a bit?”
Scoffing, Jamison replies, “And you believed him? He’s not from Earth. Not from any Earth I know. There’s something strange about him. The way he talks, the way he looks at people. Like he’s seeing through you. I don’t know. He might have a mental problem. You should have him tested when we get to Council.”
The one time Steve met General Fury as a client, the man had been reticent and dour. He hadn’t been one for small talk, but he booked the entire night with Steve. It had been exhausting and taxing because he couldn’t get the man to talk much at all. “Is General Fury a difficult man?”
“Hmm. Let me put my cup down.” He does and then stills. “Do you want me to face you?”
“I think I did a little of that yesterday, but what do you have in mind?” Steve settles at his place at the table. He thanks Wanda as she serves him breakfast.
What the hell was he coming to?
Tiberius glowers at Tony. “Now, Tones, we already talked about letting the Commander do his job.”
“Where does he go?” Steve asks.
“Tesseract, yeah, I thought so,” Steve says and stands. “I’m gonna have a wash, then I’ll meet you at Darcy’s and we can talk with Thor. He still hanging out over there?”
Steve frowns. “Three days?” That doesn’t sound right. “You weren’t there. It wasn’t three days.”
“Hate you?” Tony said as he sat up and nuzzled against Steve’s throat, licking and kissing.
She wouldn’t tell Bucky and his dread heightened until he could barely stand it. After that, he’d confronted the Jedi Scholars and begged them to allow him to save Steve. Only Peggy had supported him. Even now this trip, this mission was not sanctioned.
On the more personal side, Steve’s learned that the prince is partial to cats which might be a bad thing since Steve’s terribly allergic. The prince also plays piano and invents constantly. He used to drink to excess but rarely part takes anymore. But more interestingly, the prince refuses to marry for politics. Instead, he vows to marry for love. Part of Steve thinks that’s a fairy tale – a good yarn woven by his spin doctors to manage the media-vids and put a good face on who the prince is. All over the Conclave people sworn with hope of one day capturing the Lonely Prince – he’s been called that for a few years in the media-vids that Steve read.
“Now, are you ready for your assignment?”
The hot water beat down on him and he froze. His body trembled and that same odd ache in the center of his chest, his core, plagued him. Like an opened wound it throbbed and he placed a hand against his scarred sternum. Tony swore he could feel it bleeding. He needed something. What happened to him? He was fine.
“Star Trek and Star Wars are mutually exclusive. You can love both,” Tony says. Star Wars always held a soft space in his heart. He’s seen the original saga as a boy and his mother loved it, so he naturally took to it as well. Even with it’s perchance for leaning on a magical Force, Tony still enjoyed it. He only came to loving Star Trek later in life when he was a college student and Rhodey introduce him to that, Babylon 5 and the Doctor.
“Some don’t. Your mate is a stoic one.” Thor turned his gaze to Tony. “Your powers may develop yet, Young One. It may not be powers, but you may be turning more vicious as a vampire, more needy. It could doom your relationship and your mate. Or the powers are settling in your preternatural bones. Once that mystic seed is planted it cannot be stopped. It will grow.”
Steve met Bucky’s gaze. “How is it possible you’re in our pack and not just soul mates. How does that work? I never heard of that before.” Not in all the studies he spent hours doing. They’d bonded before the soul pack. They should not have been able to link with him if they were already a bonded pair.
“That is not one of those awe inspiring speeches that Wilson is always talking about,” Tony says as Steve unlocks the laundry room door to the garage and the outside.
“Not all of them. I made sure they didn’t all die,” the omega says in tone that seeks defiance but falls just short of it.
“Yes, sir,” Steve says. He can’t believe he’s allowing a butler to intimidate him.  He was a Captain in the Army; he went to war. He’s smelled the tang of blood in the air, the acrid odor of fear, and the horrid stench of bodies blown apart. Still, this thin rail of a man manages to intimidate Steve. It’s probably his devotion to Stark – that must be it.
“Hey Sam.”
He hopes she’s not going to play coy but he might not be able to stop it. He presses his lips together in a thin line. “Please.”
“Are you just going to lurk or are you going to sit down here.” He pats the empty side of the bed.
“We’re one and the same. Feel it.”
“How long can a lion go without food?”
Tony peers over his shoulder and notes that Pep is still engrossed, accessing the Viz (as they call the visual computer net for short). He keys on the lights in the cell and the small enclosed space brightens. The room is sparse – a cot, a toilet, a sink, a steel table. Not like the other cells for Omega warriors – where they’ve made it a home. There’s nothing personal here, no access to decorations or trinkets of a long lost home like the others. It is more like a prison cell than somewhere to house a human being, even a low caste human.
