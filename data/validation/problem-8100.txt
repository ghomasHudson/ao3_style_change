The morning came with light through the window and the smell of coffee brewing. Tony was never up before him, which meant that he'd never gone to sleep. Probably up all night. Steve smiled and stretched… and saw Pepper's shoes lying next to the bed. It came crashing back down so hard and so fast that Steve found himself reaching for his inhaler to have even a chance to catch his breath.
"Creepy. Upside is that by comparison Stark looks pretty well adjusted." He was enjoying the companionable warmth of Clint against his side. It seemed like a shame to move. Reluctantly Phil rose from the seat and stretched. "We should do this again sometime when the world isn't ending." Realizing belatedly that it sounded a lot like he was asking Clint out, he hurried to add, "With the team, I mean."
It was a satisfying sight to see Creed bleeding out on the floor, but Logan was right - it would take more to kill him, and they were supposed to be the good guys. Coulson snapped on some cuffs and let Natasha do the same with the man's ankles. It wouldn't stop him entirely, but it would make any major bouts of resistance uncomfortable at best. He flashed Natasha a quick smile. "I'll make sure you get ten minutes in a room alone with him."
"Don't worry, none of us trust him further than we can throw him. Well, I don't. Cap's good at following orders, and Bruce just sort of keeps his head in the books. Thor doesn't really have an opinion. Maybe because he views us all as overdeveloped insects." Tony paused. "Okay, so maybe I'm the only one who has the paranoia, but that means you and I have something in common."
"Slept through my alarm," Tony explained quickly. He leaned up for a kiss, then paused and gave Steve a sheepish look. "Sorry. Okay, to be honest, I got caught up analyzing the molecular decay of a couple of samples of that chitauri ore we recovered and there were some isotopes-" He cut himself off when Steve gave him that 'speak English' look he knew so well. Instead, he went with his previously intended action and stole a quick kiss from the other man. "Sorry."
Coulson couldn't help it. He blushed faintly. The truth was actually something he wanted to talk about even less, but the image had still sprung unbidden into his mind. He found himself rather resenting Darien's presence in the mental picture. "I just want you to not take the heat for this, Barton. If you can alibi out with someone else do it, but Steve's a terrible liar, and since he saw the two of you together, he'd be able to blush and stammer enough to make that one sound true." There were a dozen new things a day that Coulson found out Captain America was good at: lying was not among them. The man couldn't have played a successful hand of poker if his life depended on it. "Or you can just have a private meeting and bitch session with the director and I. Up to you."
"Out a bit late, aren't you?" Natasha couldn't help but smile. She always found it fascinating to see what sort of toys Clint brought home when left to his own devices. Sometimes his choices were questionable at best, but from time to time he found someone genuinely intriguing.
"Couple days off has me rusty," Nat protested, the words a statement of fact, not a dismissal of his complement. "I don't like taking breaks."
Tony was positively trying to kill Bruce with his mind as Steve protested, obviously starting to panic. //I will kill him.// Tony put his arm around his lover and pulled him into a hard kiss, to hell with everyone's discomfort. "Babe, look... it's like the backup for the backup. The plan is to make sure Logan does this. Or that we find a way to make this thing not kill people. One or the other. Or both."
"We kinda figured that when the little shitbird showed up on Earth and started wreckin' things without you comin' to help," Logan noted, crossing his arms over his chest. He glanced back at Hulk, glad to note he seemed to be calming down a little, though he was still glowering at a few of their prior opponents.
Clint gave Tony a death stare. "Stark..."
“Yes, Sir.”
Any chance at real entertainment in the form of breaking his neck gone, Nat snorted and zipped up her uniform. "Trust me, I haven't been missing anything."
"No, it didn't. I recall it was distinctly painful in the end. As it turns out, having a Hulk may indeed trump having an army." Even an army of mutants, judging by how well their encounters had gone so far. Loki reclined back on the bed, making himself comfortable, and then looked over at Stark still seated in his chair. "It's interesting: you obviously don't like me, you're angry with me, but you don't seem to hate me. I'm fairly certain that you should." Certainly everyone else seemed to. What made Stark an exception?
The intonation was a familiar one, and Tony gasped as Loki's hips slammed home once again, his toes curling as he felt his peak nearing. His fingers dug into the god's back, blunt fingernails raking over his skin. Short, choked gasps escaped him, a few of which sounded like Steve's name. With a low cry, Tony finally came undone, his body arching up into Loki's as he spilled himself between them. It was perfect.
Bruce sighed, glancing back to Steve in obvious hopes of finding someone to share his frustration.
Phil paled and managed in a calm if slightly strained tone, "Then we may have a problem." The idea that after everything, the stupid hammer, picking it up once, could be the thing that unraveled Clint... he couldn't really even think it. He couldn't bring himself to look at Clint and try to see what the archer was thinking.
Phil sighed and nodded slowly. "I don't either. We just have to remember that Nat's stronger than she seems - which is kind of a scary thought." The joke fell flat, but it had helped to attempt the humor. Straightening, he couldn't resist putting a hand on Clint's shoulder. They both needed the comfort. "She's a survivor. Can you really picture Natasha Romanov letting herself get taken down by this?" Dangerous as all their lives were, Clint and Nat were the pair he would put his money on outliving the lot of them. They were both too smart and too determined to do anything else. At least he hoped they were. "Right now we see what Director Fury can find out. If we can find out where whatever Loki's looking for is, we can head him off at the pass. It's our best play right now."
Thor immediately rushed Steve upon catching sight of the man. "Friend Rogers!" He threw massive arms around the blonde, then drew back as he noticed that Steve seemed smaller. His brow furrowed with concern. "Have you been eating well, my friend? You seem to have taken ill."
"Who the hell wouldn't wanna watch?" he asked, then remembered Scott was right next to him. "So you two and Coulson haven't had a game o' round robin, then? Kinda surprised, actually," Logan admitted.
"Not as often as you'd think. Some days this," he pointed to himself, "still feels like a loaner." Steve grinned and easily lifted Tony up to straddle his lap. "Now how about you tell me where the lube is - and don't even try to tell me Tony Stark doesn't have lube stashed in his car - and I'll see about getting you just as ready as you've got me." As he spoke Steve began almost absently nibbling at Tony's neck. The man smelled heavenly. Steve was sure there was some sort of expensive cologne involved, but even beneath any chemical enhancement, Tony just plain smelled good. He tasted good. The heat of his body felt good. More than with anybody he'd been with in a long time, being with Tony felt strangely easy - the very last word he would have ever associated with a relationship of any kind involving Stark. //Calm before the storm,// a less optimistic voice sounded in his mind.
"I hope she's not the jealous type. I think she has a few pounds on me," Clint said, relaxing a little. Humor was easy enough. He edged a little closer to Phil, looking him over. "I think I'll definitely be pestering you to unwind more often. The glasses kinda look good on you. Not that the suit isn't hot as hell, but you in jeans and a t-shirt's pretty damned endearing, too. And you look less like you do when you're yelling at me," he added with a mischievous grin as he took another sip of coffee.
"J, I ain't here for the usual crap. You know I got money... Show me somethin' special or I'm takin' my business elsewhere."
Tony shivered and whimpered softly, and he wasn't sure if it was the thought that he was playing right into Loki's hand or the sensation of Loki's hips moving so fluidly against his own. He wanted to rebel, to tell Loki he could go to hell or whatever passed for it in Asgard, but he had nothing to lose by doing what he was told and pleasure to gain, as well as the vague recollection that he had to do what he was told to protect Barton and Coulson. If he was honest with himself, that was becoming a secondary motivation at best. "Feels good," he murmured, voice rough with arousal as he worked a second digit into Loki's body. The god had perfect control, opening up easily and then squeezing down around Tony's digits in a way that made him feel certain Loki could make him lose his mind with pleasure if he chose to.
Darien stroked himself slowly along with Clint's desperate moans. He'd never actually jerked off live to one of his lovers fucking someone else. It was hotter than he would've expected.
Just as they pulled into the parking lot and began the trek in to get Tony a room, Steve's phone buzzed. He lifted the device up and slowly and deliberately brought up the message. Thanks to the phone's design and Tony's enhancements to it, the image Pepper had sent came through almost immediately, and Steve went pale all over again. "No..."
Natasha reached out and rubbed a hand over the man's back. "It's okay. We've all been doing it the past few days," she offered quietly, knowing the tears were coming long before they actually did. Tony Stark was not the kind of man who was easy to like, but once he was under your skin, he stayed there. Over the years she'd known him, even Natasha had grown strangely fond of Stark. So slipping into a seat next to Steve and holding him in a loose hug felt perfectly natural even though some of the others at the table looked at her in obvious surprise. Natasha didn't mind bucking people's expectations. In fact she rather enjoyed it.
"Fair enough," Logan said, unable to keep from rolling his eyes when a car that looked like it was worth two houses worth of money rolled up.
Logan smirked. "Just consider it turnabout for the rude awakenin' this morning, and be glad you didn't lose an everything in the process." He turned his attention back to Coulson. "So... Phil. Steve tells me you've got all the info I could ever want about what it is I'll be doing here."
"You know, I'm pretty sure he's a couple of triggers from 'homicidal maniac'," Tony remarked without any apparent concern. He grudgingly moved his gaze to Coulson. "So... What'm I supposed to say? 'I kissed a boy, and I liked it'?"
"Eighteen. Since I like you."
Tony drew back to look into Steve's bright blue eyes and grinned a little. "Wow," he said with his usual lopsided grin. "That... wow." It wasn't often that Tony found himself at a loss for words, or at least without the ability to produce something like speech. //Well, not using my mouth for anything else...// He leaned in, pressed a quick kiss to Steve's lips, and then nibbled at the man's neck. There was a faint hint of stubble there, and Tony nipped at the skin, his breathing slow but forceful as he felt his arousal steadily increasing. He knew he should probably back off, confident that even if he didn't have any such compunctions, Steve probably wouldn't care to get too graphic in the middle of a large crowd. He couldn't resist a little bit of teasing before he let off some.
"STARK!"
Natasha and Sif flanked the woman, facing outward, ready for any of the guards to try to interrupt. Though a few of them looked as if they dearly wanted to, it took most of them a little too long to work off the shock. By the time the first man started forward, they were already being met by Hogun and Volstagg. Natasha and Sif met the next wave to think they were good enough to interfere. Natasha smiled grimly as she brought an elbow down onto the neck of an Asgardian. She spared only a glance toward Frigga and Thor to determine that the woman wasn't being inhibited before her attention went back fully to the massive, armored foes.
"We don't know. Tony said his dad thought it was pretty bad. Pretty powerful. He used the word 'evil,' which for someone who used to sell weapons for a living..." Steve took a deep breath and met Logan's gaze. "I'm not asking you to get yourself committed to a nuthouse, but we need to know whatever you know about this thing." He paused. "We need to know what Loki knows."
Off in a world of his own, Tony jolted at the sound of his own name. Tony hated jumping at shadows. His attempts at mustering some of his trademark cool and witty demeanor failed miserably. He did not want to see anyone, let alone talk to them. "I'm fine, Natasha," came his murmured reply. "You don't have to keep checking on me." Tony's body betrayed him, giving an involuntary shiver. He felt like a helpless kitten left out in the rain for far too long, and that made him feel even worse about everything that had happened.
Tony grinned as Logan made a small sound of arousal. Or maybe it was a warning growl. Tony really wasn't going anywhere, either way. "Time to get those instincts revved up, eh, Cap?" His gaze met Steve's, and he gave the blonde his best seductive grin as he leaned in to nip at Logan's neck. If Tony were honest with himself, he knew he couldn't possibly withstand an unbridled fucking from either of the two men, but that just made it more interesting.
Bonding, dancing, a little making out. Tony Stark isn't good at subtle.
"Aye, it would be a truly great challenge for so fine a hunter!"
"Mm hm," Steve agreed, rolling onto his side so that he could look at Tony. Reality was slowly creeping into his carefully constructed bubble of happiness, but it was still wonderful to be tangled up in bed with Tony. "This is the best night I've had since the last night I spent with you." Despite the sappiness of the words, Steve meant every single one, and he followed them with a gentle kiss. "Just keep in mind that I fully intend to spend all my nights like this or some close variation thereof."
Natasha breathed a sigh of relief when the cell closed. Creed wasn't showing any signs of waking, and she frankly didn't care if he ever did, but she wanted him under lock and key when and if it happened. "For the record, no one cares whose brother he is. He's insane, and that's his own problem, not yours." She didn't want Logan thinking that behind his back anyone was saying anything else. She studied him a moment longer. "You know what he did?"
Tony moaned, then remembered that that didn't count as words. "Thanks.... got a haircut this morning," he said, managing a faint smirk before another shift on Steve's part completely obliterated the look of amusement. Tony arched into the larger man, his lips parted, eyes rolled back and partially closed as internal muscles gripped at the hot shaft inside him. He moaned, long and low, as his hand grasped Steve's muscular ass, pulling him in with each thrust as if he couldn't get enough.
The move caught Loki entirely by surprise. He actually froze for the briefest of moments, utterly baffled as Stark's lips collided with his own. He had expected a fight, resistance to the end. Instead he found himself kissing an apparently willing Tony Stark. The man's lips softened against his own. Stark was kissing him. It was unmistakable but still startling enough to take even him by surprise. Loki didn't let his shock stop him from pressing into Tony's personal space and taking advantage, however, his cool fingers rising to trace Stark's jawline.
Logan quickly dove into the fray after shedding his jeans, pressing himself against Steve's back. He slid a hand over one powerful thigh before his hand roamed upwards, fingers tracing the outline of Steve's cock as his breath puffed against the man's ear.
“It might not be helping,” Coulson finally allowed, “though we haven’t found signs of any malicious technology. Once we have a proper replacement that will work on at least a temporary basis, we’ll do more extensive testing.” He’d seen the way Bucky flinched at the sound of the man’s name and left off the fact that he hoped Tony would be the one heading up the examination. Hopefully his excitement over the tech would overwhelm his distaste for the man the arm belonged to. “I was thinking that it might help if you saw someone in the mirror who was a little more familiar. Once you’re cleared, a haircut and some new clothes might do you a world of good. Looking like the you that you remember might make you feel more like him too.”
"Don't worry, we'll ask Thor to take us up on vacation sometime," Natasha assured. She felt at ease the second Bruce was Bruce again. From inside one of the pockets on her belt, she passed the man his glasses. "Thought you might need these unbroken." They found Thor and Sif, both grim-faced, waiting with a bound and gagged Magneto at the bridge. "You really should learn to pick better allies." From what she'd seen in his file, Magneto wasn't an idiot. He also wasn't a garden variety villain. He just had a really screwed up idea of what qualified as helping. "The guy you hitched your star to? He's a certifiable nut job."
In which Bruce & Jemma finally go on that coffee date.
Clint shook his head. "He's in for a shock, sir. Loki's the type that'd convince you that you could, then turn the tables. He's really good at manipulating people just by talking."
"As long as it's not Up. That is not trauma-proof." Scott caught Logan's raised eyebrow and shrugged. "I cried. Like a baby. Multiple times. I can't help it if you're made out of stone." He curled into Logan's side despite his griping and used the man's shoulder as a convenient pillow. "And Toy Story. Still love those, though. Just... this is a good choice. Nemo. Despite the dead mom thing. What is it with Disney and dead parents?"
"A date? Hmm... with cocktails and roses? That could be cute. Don't forget the makeup for all those photos that're gonna get snapped." When Steve glanced down at him, he gave the man's hand a squeeze. "I like it. Somewhere fancy with real tablecloths, or more in the steakhouse or greasy spoon arena?" He paused. "Also, I feel it's important to note that I was the only one drunk. I had a designated dancer. Technically only half of that dance was drunk."
When he finally opened his eyes again, the illumination behind the curtains told him that it was morning. Scott shifted, panicked for only a moment before he spotted Logan sitting not far away. His whole body sagged. "Hey. How long was I out?"
"Mm... I like the way you think. We can save slow for the whole pickin' out drapes together part. I kind think some other things need to happen on the faster scale."
Coulson hit his comm and murmured, "Romanov, we could use your help up here. Logan, get Creed to the jet. We'll be there soon with more company than anticipated. I want him secured in the least comfortable part of the cargo hold."
Tony listened intently even as the drugs pumping through his system threatened to steal his consciousness away. He had no reason to doubt Steve, even if his assertion that a dead man had tried to assassinate him was fantastic. "Okay, so your best friend is back from the dead and he's gunning for me." Tony set his jaw, mulling over the possibilities. "Jealousy issues? Otherwise, I can't even begin to imagine why I'm his target." He was only mildly teasing, hoping to lighten Steve's mood. It was abundantly clear the other man was deeply troubled over this development, and rightly so.
When they arrived, Steve insisted on carrying Tony's bag and holding doors for him. The gestures were old fashioned and perhaps unnecessary, but Steve still felt responsible for Tony getting hurt at all. If he could help in any small way, he intended to. While Tony got himself settled in his bedroom for the night, Steve fetched a pillow and comforter from his own room and began making up a bed for himself on the small couch in the room's sitting area, unwilling to leave Tony unprotected during the night.
"Welcome back again, Cap."
Thor gave the archer an approving thump on the back. "That is the spirit, Hawk!" he decided, though he couldn't help the unease he felt at the strange bloodlust in Clint's eyes when the man looked up at him.
Scott wanted to debate the issue, but, jaw tight, he nodded instead. At the sound of the door, he tensed but found Coulson taking his hand again and managed to look only slightly startled.
Bruce rolled his eyes. Leave it to Tony to troll people even in that moment. Speaking of uncomfortable... Bruce cleared his throat. "Uh, Tony, have you and the good Captain considered investing in some concealer?" He was pretty sure that Steve hadn't bitten himself shaving that morning. Four times.
It was absolutely overwhelming in the best sense of the word. Steve reached down and gave his own cock a few quick jerks. The oversensitive flesh protested but not enough to keep him from coming again as he sucked down the evidence of Tony's release. Steve was thankful for the harsh grip of Logan's hands keeping him from collapsing unceremoniously onto the mattress. As it was, he cursed softly but appreciatively and pressed a lazy kiss to Tony's hip.
"You can fight in your tighty whities if that's what makes you feel better," Steve answered, too relieved to really care what demands Logan made. As long as what he wanted was legal, he definitely seemed like a guy it was best not to fight with. Deciding it might not be a bad idea to change the subject for a moment while the tension slowly flowed out of the room, Steve nodded toward Logan's drink. "So does it do anything for you?" From what he'd read, Logan's metabolism was on par with his own. There were days when he hated being entirely unable to get drunk, and frankly meeting Logan ranked right up there.
"Uh, yes, sir, but-"
Steve's fingers clutched at the leather of the couch. It was probably a good thing he was without his enhanced strength or Tony would have been in the market for some serious repairs to the upholstery. "Do that again, please, Tony." It was becoming easier and easier to beg with each passing moment, and Steve found that he actually couldn't help it the more worked up he got. He supposed it was mostly easy because when he looked back at Tony, he could see how turned on his lover was. Knowing that Tony got off on it was enough to get him to do a whole hell of a lot of things.
"Right."
Logan chuckled a little, the comment having caught him off guard. He watched a little too intently as the other man stripped to the waist, reaching out without a thought to steady Scott as the man teetered to one side. Scott's lean-muscled shoulder felt good under his hand, and Logan couldn't help but feel a little disappointed as he made himself let go once Scott had his balance. Logan wordlessly went about stripping down to his own boxers. It was rare The Wolverine found himself feeling awkward in a situation, but this was definitely one of those times. Not sure of what else to do, Logan settled into his side of the bed, surreptitiously catching glances at Scott as the man prepared for bed.
Fitz nodded his eager agreement. "The gun will work. There's no question about that. Sir. Mr. Stark is right, it should be foolproof." The only question - and the one they all knew was hanging freely in the air - was whether the gun working would also be enough to kill Loki.
Logan's relief at seeing Scott alive was tempered by Fury's presence. "She's not. He said he was gonna send her back. He didn't say when." Logan left out the reason he'd been returned. It was none of SHIELD's business in his mind.
Thor nodded. "We will. This act of cowardice will not stand. And the Son of Coul and the Hawk will not be left to my brother's whims." He said the words softly, though. Even with Loki's most recent crimes, it was difficult to wrap his head around killing his brother. "The Lady Sif will accompany us. I... I do not wish to involve more of our friends in this grim task, necessary though it may be." He moved toward the door. "Let us go now. There is no reason for delay."
It didn't take long to get to their drop zone, and Tony flew himself over. As they gathered up, Tony noted that Bruce was still Bruce. "You gonna suit up?"
"Yeah, I would."
"We have a couple friends who need a hand too. Thor's would be preferred." Natasha smiled faintly and then followed Sif out onto a bridge that looked like it was made of light and air and echoed like it had metal running through it. She looked over to Bruce and raised an eyebrow. "So how are you liking alien worlds so far, Dr. Banner?"
"Not a word," she hissed. Simmons raised a finger in warning when Fitz' mouth opened again. "You should get sleep. I'll take the first shift waiting for Captain Rogers. I'll run the simulation a few more times. Sleep. Before you say something I'll be forced to make you regret, Fitz."
Clint grinned impishly. "Well, it'd be the most hilarious incident report you ever had to write to Fury, at least," he pointed out, peeling off his hoodie and t-shirt before kicking off sneakers and shimmying out of his pants. He made no effort to preserve any sort of modesty as he worked; he had assumed that Coulson catching him fooling around in the kitchen had to have been more upsetting. Lean, wiry muscle flexed as he moved with practiced ease, taking only a couple of minutes to get suited up. Clint double-checked his bow and quiver before settling back in the seat and propping one booted foot on the dashboard. "Alright, let's go."
Steve couldn't help enjoying the closeness. He knew Tony was just trying to make Coulson uncomfortable, but his hand rose, and he found himself unconsciously stroking the hair at the nape of Tony's neck just the same. The whole thing might be a mess, but that didn't stop him from kind of liking it. "He's on our side, remember?"
Loki made no effort to hold back. He let Stark guide things, let him take charge, but didn't stop moving or clutching his muscles around Tony's cock to milk every last shudder of pleasure he could from the mortal. Even if the man got back to his lover, Loki wanted to be sure that the encounter was one that would remain embedded in his mind. Finally he guided one of Stark's hands to his cock and rocked back harder into his each thrust. It felt like it took no time at all before he came hard over the mortal's chest, though the burning of his thigh muscles suggested otherwise. "Your turn." Loki held fast to Stark and managed to flip their positions with surprising grace, leaving Tony on top. "Give me everything you have."
Steve couldn’t remember ever having spent quite so much time staring at his closet. He made it a point to look nice whenever possible, but it was different wanting to look good but not too good, casual but not too casual. Finally Steve chose a pair of dark jeans that Natasha had insisted he buy in the store in addition to his usual slacks and paired it with a blue button down. Knots of nervous energy twisted in his stomach, but Steve made his way to the kitchen on mostly steady legs. Finding it still empty, Steve took a moment to start getting some ingredients together. The more he had to do, the less he would think of how terrified he was that Tony might not even show up.
Logan shifted, grinding his cock against Steve's perfect ass as his fingers dove down the front of the man's boxers, wrapping around the more than impressive length inside. The feral mutant groaned his appreciation, his teeth and tongue working at Steve's ear and neck as he stroked the weeping shaft.
Jemma's hand closed tightly over Bruce's, and she gave a decisive shake of her head. "No, you're grieving for your friend. You two were obviously close. I'd be a bit worried if you weren't thinking about it." She smiled slightly and squeezed his hand again. "I'm here because I'd like to get to know you. Knowing who you care about is definitely part of that."
Logan, meanwhile, was busy trying to ignore the guy next to him that was doing a lot of work to get his attention. "You're drunk, kiddo; go home," he finally growled. The very delicate-looking, barely-legal young man flounced off, and Logan turned his attention back to Tony and Steve on the dancefloor. It made his blood boil to see how close Stark was getting to Steve. //Yeah, and is that protective instinct, or jealousy? Stark's got a headstart if you're thinkin' o' takin' a guy home for the first time you can remember.// "Archie? Danny? Whatever... bring me another beer."
"I would like to check everything, make sure that Agent Barton is as okay as he seems to be. Not that I don't trust our newest addition, but I... well, I prefer to trust him with reason instead of blindly. Informed trust." She shrugged slim shoulders. "I'm afraid Fitz is right. We need to hide out here for a bit longer, but if you have Jarvis send the invitations around, we'll both be there with bells on for movie night." Badly as she wanted to play hookey, Simmons knew that there was a lot riding on the team being safe and well and ready for action - which meant seeing that they really were all of those things.
"I know they could," Steve agreed, "and that's why I'm not letting you out of my sight." He had no idea which of Tony's enemies - or the Avengers' - might be behind the attack. "Pepper'll make sure they go over the security footage." He even had his phone with him, though Steve still found being attached to a virtual string at all times more than slightly invasive. Tony had picked the thing out, though, and even found an American flag case for it to try to make it more personal, so he carried the phone and tried to keep it charged. Suddenly he felt glad for the habit since it meant Pepper could get in touch with him whenever she found something and vice versa. "We'll find whoever did this. I promise."
Scott have in to the wild, almost frantic action unreservedly. He couldn't explain the desperation as anything but a probably unhealthy response to Logan's upcoming incarceration. Not that it mattered. "I need you." Scott meant it in more than just the immediate sense. He didn't want to go forward into a strange new life alone no matter how codependent that made him.
While Scott watched, a dark shape slammed fully into the silver-haired mutant's back from behind. Natasha rolled away and held up one wrist, and before even Piotr had a chance to recover, she sent electricity zinging through his body until he was shaking and trembling on the ground. "Don't touch," she cautioned Hulk firmly, voice all business. "He's not gonna be much fun to play with for awhile. How about you give him," she jerked her head toward Loki, "something to sink his teeth into."
"Oh, we'll have this all sorted in no time at all," Simmons assured with more confidence than she felt. Her phone buzzed, and she looked suddenly terrified. "Director Fury would like to have a progress meeting later this afternoon with all of us."
"I guess not. Not that I expected to be. It's not their fault," he pointed out almost reflexively. "I left. They need every person they can get to help and to teach the kids, and I left. That's not easy to overlook. I was mad at you when you left. I can't expect them not to be mad at me." Scott shrugged as if pushing the thought away. He took a long pull from the beer and offered Logan a ghost of a smile. "I guess maybe we have more in common than we thought."
Natasha smiled slowly. "Okay." As much as she didn't trust Stark when it came to being a practical, functioning adult, she knew that together he and Bruce could accomplish damn near anything they needed to, especially with SHIELD resources behind them. "Things will be fine, then. Everybody came through okay?"
For the first time, Scott felt he'd seen a flash of what Barton was talking about, and the thought of it made his blood run cold. Logan on a good day was dangerous. Logan out of control could mean a whole lot of bodies. He rubbed his wrist and broke eye contact, not sure how much he trusted himself to speak. "Did I act any differently when I was in charge? No matter how pissed off you might've been, I don't think you would have made another call. I don't think you really would here either. If you thought your people were in danger, you'd do what it took to protect them. That's all this is. It would be stupid not to ask questions." //And I've been pretty willfully stupid the past couple days…//
//Phil?// The guy looked somewhere between badass and someone who should be trading comic books in his mom's basement. All the same, Logan shook hands. "You can drop the 'mister' part, Coulson. I ain't much for titles."
"What about Thor?"
"Inside, ma'am. Please," Steve added. He let Fury lead the charge back inside. The stares that met them on the way in were in equal parts shock and blank awe. Certainly Sif had the presence to inspire both. She was terrifying but also striking.
"Does that mean that Thor's back too?" Steve asked, feeling a surge of hope.
Tony felt himself tense a little. He knew Loki didn't like hearing about his brother. The fact that Thor was now a topic of conversation didn't seem like something that would end well. "That you're of Asgard. And his brother." He took a deep breath. "And that you were adopted." Tony didn't need 20/20 vision to see Loki twitch a little at that last part. "Is it... is it weird to be adopted in Asgard? I mean, that's pretty normal on Earth." Tony hesitated. The idea that Loki could potentially be even more unpleasant was a chilling one. "What do you mean, beneath the face you’ve shown us?" he asked carefully.
Logan nodded his understanding. He could relate, in a way. Sometimes even a shithole apartment was better than having to see the same damned people every day even on your day off. He really wanted Scott in his bed every night, but he was able to tolerate having him a few doors down. The idea of Scott being a half hour away or on the other side of town made Logan uncomfortable. He wasn't going to protest, though. He could understand Scott's need for privacy. "I'm sure SHIELD would pay ya enough to get a decent place," he said, deciding on his order and then setting the menu aside.
"Hundred bucks says you weren't watchin' episodes o' Jersey Shore," Logan returned, scarfing down the last of his eggs. He sat still for a moment, looking a little lost, before he returned to the fridge and withdrew a beer. He grinned sheepishly at Scott. "Six o'clock somewhere, right?" He put their dishes away then glanced at his companion. "Get you anything? Coffee? Decaf tea?"
Logan shook his head. "No interrogations about it, Slim. You can talk to me when you're ready. They're kosher with that, as long as you stick around a day or two so they can relay any of their follow-up questions through me." He reached out and gently squeezed the man's shoulder. "You need to rest. Then I wanna know what happened." //And a few answers on what drove you away from Westchester... but that can come later.// "Don't think I'm gonna turn you over to a buncha government suits just 'cause they tell me to." He offered a faint grin. "You know how good I am at doin' what I'm told."
In which we catch up with Tony and Loki. The situation is - as one would expect - pretty bad.
"Barton, start us off. You were out of the vent first."
Bruce nodded at Steve, then took a deep breath as he felt the plane dip as it went into VSTOL mode. "Looks like it's showtime," he muttered as the cargo gate dropped.
Steve laughed and held Tony tight for a few seconds more. "I love you." He drew himself up to full height - not exactly an impressive thing anymore - and took Tony's hand as they walked down the hall. People were going to stare anyway. He saw no reason not to give them the full show. Steve's fingers twisted up with the other man's, and that helped. It helped to have Tony still by his side and still looking at him like he mattered. Entering the conference room took his breath away for a minute, but Steve managed to return Coulson's warm smile. He was suddenly glad that the man had been there in medical. Coulson already knew, had already seen, and was passing him a file with a few forms needing signatures like it was any other meeting. "Thank you," he said with genuine gratitude as he took his usual seat next to Tony and tried to avoid Fury's gaze for the most part.
"So that's what you do," Clint muttered, looking with renewed vigor. "I was wondering."
"For him to get Tony." Steve swung his legs off the bed and glared at Coulson as the man put a hand on his chest. "It was Bucky. It-"
"Well, now you won't be able to get away from it." Steve managed a smile as he held on tighter. "Pretty soon I'll be back to regular shape, and I can pick you up and actually keep you from leaving the bedroom again." He blushed and ducked before resting his forehead against Tony's. "Sorry. I'm guessing that I'm not the only one who could use a shower, and you probably need rest. Y'know, what with recovering from being dead and all. That has to be tiring." //It sure was for me.//
"But never to love me either." It was his turn to flinch, and Loki hated that he felt so exposed, so ragged after his time with Stark. It was usual for him to get under the skin of those around him. It was unusual for someone to get so deeply under his. "Nevermind. We both know the answer to that. I'd rather not hear more. If you wish to see me live through this, speak for me. Stark will, as much as he is able. Do the same, and perhaps I may yet live to see another day despite Agent Barton's strong conviction that I should be breathing far less than I am currently."
Natasha slid a third finger home, stretching Scott wider and still licking at his hips, his thighs, whatever she could reach. It was delicious to see Scott's hips rising and falling with the stimulation. His bruises were fading, and his body seemed ready for more.
"I don't have anywhere I need to go. Especially if we're goin' wherever this Natasha-in-leather is."
Logan nodded his agreement. "Her 'n' Coulson both. Not so sure about Barton. Not so sure he actually has a mind."
Scott's shoulders slumped with relief. He'd been ready for rejection, and he frankly wouldn't have blamed Logan if he did feel too strange about it for them to share the same bed again. The ground they stood on had shifted. Everything was strange. In the harsh light of day, they might both regret the whole thing, but Scott didn't really think so. He forced himself up off the couch and drank two glasses of water in quick succession. "There. Now hopefully my head will only mostly be killing me in the morning." The man stumbled somewhat as he made his way back toward Logan's room. "No complaining to me about blue balls in the morning," Scott proclaimed as he stripped his shirt off and kicked off his shoes.
Clint flopped back into the cushy couch and sighed. He could tell that the second he stopped moving he was going to pass out. He grabbed a throw pillow  and started to lay down, then grunted. With Nat and everything else that had gone down, he still hadn't had a chance to put on civilian clothes. "One day, I'll get to wear real people stuff again," he grumbled, unzipping his best and tossing it to the floor with a solid "thud." The archer stretched and yawned, relaxing into the cushions and falling asleep almost the second his eyes were closed.
Steve had been scowling alternately at the wall clock and his watch for the better part of ten minutes when Tony finally rounded the corner. He found himself torn between wanting to strangle the man, or grab him and throw him up against the wall. Maybe both. Steve sighed instead and tilted his head, silently asking for an explanation that he knew wouldn't make him feel much better about the lateness. Tony Stark was never on time. He tried not to let his mind start listing all the other things he knew about Tony that were nothing he wanted to think about when they were just starting to date.
"When you put it that way, it sounds so romantic," Scott answered with a chuckle. Logan would never be a poet, but he was a good guy. They spotted a likely bench with no hobos clustered on it, and he sat down, dragging Logan with him. He barely let the man's solid bulk settle before leaning in for a kiss. They both tasted like wings and beer and smelled like stale cigarettes, but it didn't matter. Scott let the light rush of touching Logan where anyone could come across them flush the rest of the concerns from his system.
Clint flinched involuntarily at the sudden touch, but it did help ground him more firmly back into reality. Eyes still a little wild and heart still racing, he shook his head. "Just... just a nightmare," he murmured, finally pushing himself up from the floor. "We were taking care of the thing with Scott, and Logan..." He trailed off. Coulson was a good friend. The image of him getting brutally murdered was hard enough to get out of Clint's head; talking about the dream seemed too much like inviting it to become reality. Trying to change the subject, he asked, "How long was I out?"
Clint looked up at the sound of his last name and Phil's commanding tone. It seemed to have clicked something over in his mind. Panicking wouldn't do them any good, much as he wanted to have a total meltdown. It felt better to have Phil's hands on him, to be pulled in close, to know that they were together at least. They'd held each other similarly the night before, in Phil's bed, and it hurt all over again to think about it. "Okay." He swallowed and took another, deeper breath as he sat up a little, pressing himself more fully against Coulson. "Alright, we get out together." He sighed and looked around the cell. It was bare, save for a rough-looking toilet, a scuzzy sink, and some mats that were obviously intended as a place to sleep. "Not the best options to get us out of this mess."
Some mild violence in this chapter. Please avoid it if you're bothered by such things. Though why you would be reading this story in that case is somewhat beyond me.
"Who says I wasn't?" Phil challenged with a flicker of a smile. "My dirty thoughts just happened to involve you." Which had, naturally, made the situation a few extra billion times more awkward. Also a little more pleasant. It had evened out in his mind on some sort of karmic scale. They'd survived, he'd managed to not embarrass himself any more fully than necessary, and Clint hadn't brought it up again. Until he did. "Hopefully now that you have more information on the make and model, I'm just going to assume you're happy with what you're buying into since you're still here." Phil looped his arms around Clint's chest. "Not that I'd let you go just at the moment either way."
"Or the log cabin and the elevator," Steve mused with a hint of a smile. "I mean, we have to get downstairs to start the vacation, right? Elevator rides can run a little long when there are technical issues that I'm sure you and Jarvis is more than capable of creating." He sounded entirely earnest and not in the least bit devious, but the light in Steve's eyes said otherwise. "And I almost didn't say nice. I almost said 'swell,' but the last time I did, Clint didn't stop teasing me for two weeks."
"Mr. Barton, I think it best you find other ways of flirting with danger," Hank suggested, glancing back as a series of explosions rattled the walls. He glanced at Coulson. "This structure is solid, I hope?"
Clint was grateful that Steve was absorbed in the paperwork Coulson had handed him because the archer couldn't help but stare a little more than was decent at the now-diminutive blonde. //No wonder he was picked on so much before the serum,// Clint thought to himself. He made a point to put his eyes forward, no doubt helped a little by the elbow to the ribs that Nat gave him. He felt bad for Steve. He really did. But he was also pretty terrible at handling things like this with the apparent grace of his fellow Avengers.
Tony could feel the barely-contained power behind Steve's every move. It was a thrill in and of itself, and that combined with the feel of Steve's cock sliding home over and over again left Tony cumming between them only moments before his partner. He cried out without restraint, overwhelmed by the power of his orgasm. Finally partially catching his breath, Tony offered Steve a cocky smirk. "You're definitely America's superso-"
"Not too fast," Phil cautioned. He couldn't look away. He couldn't do anything but watch Clint's beautiful lips parting to take him in like he didn't have the slightest bit of hesitation. It struck him that Clint had probably been a porn star in a past life to look so beautiful on his knees. "But don't stop." Stopping would have resulted at best in him losing what was left of his mind. Clint looked as dazed and stunned by the whole situation as he felt, and that was comforting to see. "You are so incredibly hot..."
The boys get home. Things get weird. In a good way... mostly.
Simmons was startled to see that Tony's eyes were red, and he honest-to-god looked as if he'd been crying. She felt her blood run cold but tried to smile brightly. "Right, then!" She offered Fury an even shakier smile, nerves taking over from more specific worry as she and Fitz went back and forth. Somehow even when they should have been tripping over each other, it all flowed into a flawless if often too specific presentation of precisely what the gun could do. "There you have it, sir. Of course, there... well, there is the back up plan." Simmons looked to Tony, her expression suddenly strained.
"Anger management issues. Maybe you could tell him some secrets," Tony snarked as he fiddled with his sleeves. The MK XII wristbands were in place. The suit was still a little eccentric, but Tony wasn't in the habit of waiting until something was perfected before he used it. //Hopefully, Loki just wants to talk about his mommy issues, anyway.//
Out in the hallway, Clint took a step back as the door opened, giving him enough room to fire if he needed to. He nimbly dodged when Logan tried to shove him. "Don't push it, hairball." In spite of himself, Clint flinched slightly at the metal rasp of Logan's claws being bared. He knew he ultimately didn't stand a chance against the feral mutant. Not at this range.
Loki returned to the man's grasp readily. He wanted to be touched, found himself aching for it when he caught sight of the desire in Tony's eyes. Mortal or not, Tony was lovely and pleasantly distracting. He groaned as he straddled Tony's lap again and their bare cocks rubbed together. "There's plenty of oil in that bottle on the night stand. I suspect you know precisely what to do with it." Their roles had been reversed before to accommodate what he presumed were Steve Rogers' preferences. Loki had other ideas, ideas that involved riding Stark until he screamed.
"First off, you're wrong about that," Steve answered evenly. He had reluctantly let go of Tony to enter the cell and wished like hell for the warmth of the man's touch as he moved toward Natasha. "Secondly, I can survive this. If anyone can, I can."
Phil watched Steve go and felt a surge of gratitude. "I'm sorry," he said as soon as Steve was clear of the table. "About earlier. I know you didn't mean it that way, and you're thinking the way you should be thinking. The way we both should be thinking. I guess maybe this whole thing's under my skin more than I realized."
The door closed and Steve groaned. "We need to remember to lock the door next time, not just close it. Would've given us a few seconds more of a head start."
Clint more or less purred, a content sort of murmur as Phil's lips brushed reassuringly against his palm. He leaned up to gently kiss the man's neck before letting his fingers tangle around Phil's, idly tracing the shapes of his lover's hand, his knuckles, his fingers. He was only half tuned into the movie, enjoying instead the security and quiet he was feeling with Nat and Phil pressed securely against him. His free hand idly stroked through the woman's red locks without his realizing it, and he almost stopped before changing his mind. The few times they'd had to reassure one another, Clint had usually found himself doing the same thing. He figured if either she or Phil had an objection, they could voice it, but the contact was calming for the archer too.
"I think I could probably be alright with that," Phil agreed. He couldn't quite bring himself to let go of Clint's cock right away. Only when he realized that Clint had other plans, that he'd clearly stated those plans, and that if he didn't let go Clint couldn't move forward with the plans did Phil finally manage to loose his grip. "Be happy to return the favor, just for the record." He savored the thought, actually, the idea of watching Clint fall apart.
Beneath the table, Phil let his hand stray over to give Clint's a quick squeeze. He felt his shoulders relax at the touch, at the gentle reminder of Clint's presence. That was all it took. "I think it will definitely be a fitting tribute," he agreed quietly.
"Yeah, I guess that takes some getting used to. It's funny to me sometimes. I know the PR machine... it was all pretty squeaky clean, and I try to be a good guy, don't get me wrong, but I've never been what everybody thinks I am." Steve shrugged at the idea. He knew that helping people was too deeply entrenched in him to do anything else. "The calm, normal life wasn't ever an option. I wish it had been. Anyway, the more people get to know me, the more they're gonna notice. Might as well show 'em with hickeys."
"We're all here for you," Coulson offered quietly. "However this turns out, SHIELD still needs you." It didn't matter what Steve's body looked like, the mind and spirit inside it were the same ones that had brought the more victories than he could count already. "The rest can work itself out."
Clint grunted and nodded as if he'd expected the response. He pushed himself away from the bar and stood with a sigh. "I tried," he said, placing himself between the bruiser and Darien. "Fuck off."
Tony nodded, taking in Steve's expression, mannerisms and the way his skin flushed warmly. The temptation to tease the other man even further proved impossible to ignore. "Well, that's a shame," he decided, giving Steve a friendly nudge, "great-looking guy like you going to waste. Doesn't seem right to me." Shifting closer, Tony's dark eyes burned as he added conversationally, "Pepper and I have what I'd call an open relationship." He noted the frown which shadowed Steve's gaze. //Time to elaborate and gauge his reaction.// "Neither one of us minds if the other takes an interest in someone else."
"You don't deserve it." She let her thumb stroke over the back of Bruce's hand in a gentle, soothing gesture. "Or we all do. It's better that we remember that we did our best." Jemma knew that if the same situation presented itself again in the same way, they would all make the same calls, or ones close enough to them that nothing would change. They had done their best with what they had. "With any luck - and I believe we've earned a bit of that - it won't be a problem for much longer."
Feeling slightly better for having showered, Tony stepped out of the bathroom with a fairly ragged-looking towel wrapped around his waist. He was starting to feel hungry again, but pride kept him from asking for food. Knowing Loki had far less leverage on him was serving quite well to give him more of his old defiance back. Instead of asking for clothing, Tony settled in the ragged wing-backed chair that was obviously for Loki and casually propped his ankle on his knee. "Figure out how to convince them you're really not an asshole yet?" He smirked at the glare he got. "I mean, giving me back's a start. Alive. And saving Barton from the hammer. You might also want to apologize to Phil."
Tony grinned, piling onto the couch next to Steve and immediately throwing an arm around his shoulders. "I think you've had enough cold, Capsicle," he decided, pressing his lips to the blonde's forehead before taking another sip of wine. "Which is why, when we're done saving the world for at least a few minutes, we're going to a cabin in the mountains of Colorado, where I'm keeping a fire going and you're not leaving until spring."
Tony smiled, actually enjoying the simple cuddling. He toyed with Steve's hair, running his other hand over Steve's shoulder. "Me, too. They kept bringing me cafeteria food," he complained. He was silent for a long moment before he spoke again. "I worried. I mean, I know you're a lot more durable than I am, but it was pretty hard for me to sit here and listen in over the comms center and not be able to do a damn thing to help."
"Good. I'd hate to have to kill you after all that bonding." Phil relaxed more the longer they drove. Even in times of stress, Lola had become something of a safe space. Being inside her and driving down the road felt very close to freedom. Normally he preferred alone time, but it was oddly comforting to have Clint slouched in the passenger seat. "Your taste in music isn't completely awful."
"You too!" Even being back on the plane didn't make Steve feel much better. He couldn't help looking with suspicion at the hammer still clutched in Clint's hand. "You should put that down," he finally said softly.
Steve sat stunned in the wake of the request. Thor and Tony pulling for the idea was bizarre. Hearing Loki genuinely asking for their help in his own roundabout way was enough to leave him feeling like he was having a stroke. "Sir, I don't see... I..." He shook his head, rubbing his fingers over his forehead to ward off an impending headache, and finally tried again, "I don't see how we could trust him, Sir."
"Tomorrow." They'd already sewn some chaos - a few issues in crowded areas, a few scenes. It was just a warning to SHIELD that they were bloodied but unbowed. Loki smiled coldly. He was done playing nicely with the Avengers. He didn't want to see them dead, necessarily, he wanted to see them well and truly broken. "Apparently taking away their Captain wasn't enough. They have a new leader now. I think we should give him a proper welcome." He turned his piercing gaze to Victor, and the smile widened. "The Iron Man is mine, but he isn't alone in needing to be taught a lesson. You will collect the archer and his handler. It seems I didn't kill him thoroughly enough last time. Perhaps you could take care of that for me?"
It was impossible to stifle the soft gasp that the squeeze and the mental image inspired. "You are way less innocent than everyone thinks. You might even be downright dirty," he murmured, sliding his hand down Steve's chest and between his legs to stroke the blonde's cock. He licked his way back up to Steve's ear, his voice dropping to a low growl. "Which just makes me want to fuck you harder, use you like I know you want me to." As if to prove his point, he drew slowly back and slammed his hips forward.
Scott blinked slowly. His mind was dimmed, awash with alcohol, which let him think in an entirely different - and ultimately less effective - way. Logan was still talking about them sleeping together. He hadn't gone running in the other direction at the mention of other guys. He'd just been worried about Scott picking up the wrong one. He'd been complimentary. He'd been nice. He was barely able to meet Scott's gaze, which normally wouldn't have been that strange but considering he wasn't wearing his shades for once was noteworthy. It all tumbled together while Scott sat silently staring. He knew he was probably making Logan uncomfortable, but it didn't matter for the moment. He needed to put it all together before he did anything. In the end, Scott gave up on thinking. Instead he darted forward with speed and coordination surprising for someone who could hardly sit up straight in his chair and grabbed the front of Logan's shirt. The kiss wasn't kind or gentle, and it was more sloppy than sweet, but Scott needed to know one way or another whether the pieces had all fallen together right.
"The outskirts of Calcutta," Bruce said, still looking amused. "Hiding from myself." He sighed. "You know, I always figured that I should run and hide from people, that that was the safest way for me to... well." He fiddled with his mug a little self consciously. "I almost left again after New York." He glanced out the window. It was starting to rain a little. He huffed a soft laugh. "It's a little crazy, but... it was Tony that kept me around. He's such an ass, but he doesn't treat me like a hand grenade someone lost the pin to." Bruce caught himself a moment later. "Didn't." He swallowed around the sudden lump in his throat, looking away and biting his bottom lip. "Sorry. Sorry, I'm kind of killing the mood, aren't I?" he said, his voice shaking a little.
"Sit," Phil ordered simply before grabbing one of Clint's belt loops and dragging him back to his stool.
Normally Phil might have objected. Normally he wouldn't have reached over and put a hand on Clint's thigh just to feel the additional point of contact. The night wasn't normal and neither was the situation. He returned Ward's gaze, silently challenging the flicker of surprise in the agent's eyes. It was gratifying that Ward glanced away first. Phil let the tension seep from his body and closed his eyes, trusting May to get them back safely.
Logan had to think for a moment. There was a lot he wanted to say, and he hated the idea of not being able to look into Scott's eyes and hold his hands while he said it. But he wasn't sure when or even if he'd be getting out of the cage. "Tell 'im I miss 'im, and that I'm sorry." He hesitated a moment. His gaze flicked to the floor, then back up to Steve's face. "And that I love 'im."
"Nah, not at all," Logan said, watching Steve's bright blue eyes closely as his hand rose to cover Steve's. "He found out about us. Wasn't too happy." Logan didn't sound the least bit upset, though, instead edging a little closer to Steve. "I told him it was just fun, but..."
"We do, sir. It's a little late, though--"
Coulson laughed along with him, glad that Clint was amused by the fact instead of put off. He knew that plenty of people in SHIELD considered his geekier pursuits to be ridiculous and embarrassing. Phil considered them a part of his life he wasn't willing to change simply because some people didn't know how to enjoy themselves. "Good. You should be. I'm very picky." Coulson sipped at the coffee and felt his faculties slowly returning to normal. "I'm fairly certain that without caffeine I might actually stop being able to get up in the morning. Ever."
"Too bad he’s so fucking indestructible," Clint growled. The blow Creed had taken, Clint was sure, would have killed Loki. Considering the mutant's regenerative powers, it was impressive that he was still unconscious.
Tony nodded, well pleased. He looked the files over, looking honestly impressed. "Fitz. You're actually a scientist, then," he remarked.
Tony smiled. It felt good to know his lover was going to stay close that afternoon. He hated the idea of being separated all day, and quiet companionship was something he could definitely enjoy. "I'm alright with that as long as we're not doing nudes. I don't think I can handle seeing Fitz naked," Tony decided around a mouthful of pizza. "Not to mention, these plastic chairs really stick to bare skin."
"He's like a big blue teddy bear," a voice agreed from over Hank's shoulder. Holding out a hand, the young man smiled. "Bobby Drake, otherwise known as Iceman." He shook Bruce's hand, then did the round of introductions with the group at large. "I'm sorry we couldn't spare more people. Things have been messy all over."
Clint relaxed a little, too, and nodded, worry creasing his brow. "She's... awake. Coherent. But... She's afraid she's been compromised. She seems alright to me, but... she's in a lot of pain, and the docs say there's nothing physically wrong with her." He was terrified when he thought that they might not be able to undo whatever Loki had done. Nat had obviously been in a lot of pain.
At that moment the doors burst open, and a very angry Thor charged into the room. "Where is he?" he thundered. "Where is the scum that took our comrade? He shall be nothing more than a nasty stain once I am through with him!"
Tony remained lucid enough to understand the ramifications of such a question. If it was known how he truly felt for Steve, then it could be used to hurt him. Gritting his teeth, he fought against the effect of the drug as he answered, "We're friends... Steve lives with me... because he needed help... getting..." Tony closed his eyes shut tight, feeling his resolve beginning to slip. "He's... my... friend..." He strained against his bonds, feeling the pain from his fractured ribs. It helped him to focus, and Tony kept pushing himself.
Logan managed to make a few of the guards hesitate just by showing them the claws, but they didn't pause for long, flinging themselves at him. Not particularly wanting to kill folks who were more than likely just misled, Logan retracted the claws and settled for pure fury and adamantium-laced punches, grinning more broadly than was at all healthy as he fought. He paused at the sound of an enraged roar, though, and he and his assailants turned their eyes toward the other side of the fracas as the Hulk loomed up and flung a few guards across the room. "And that's why you don't start with the little guy," he said, breaking the jaw of one of the distracted guards. Gentlemen's rules were for friendly barroom brawls.
"Pretty s-sure that if I do, the doc's just gonna... gonna have to stitch me back up... a few times," Tony replied, shuddering as pleasure slowly overwhelmed his ability to speak coherently. Steve moved against him perfectly, felt perfect inside and out. Unable to hold back anymore, Tony began thrusting more steadily, nipping and licking at Steve's throat, his collarbone, anything he could get his mouth on. As he felt his peak nearing, Tony rested his forehead on the sheets next to Steve's head, hooking his arms under Steve's shoulders as if to get more leverage.
"I am disappointed by the lack of Brittany Spears," Clint deadpanned. He managed to hold out for a few seconds when Coulson looked at him like he'd just confessed to having a crush on Loki, then grinned a little. "Nope, can't do it. Can't even pretend that I'm serious." He sighed. "Well, no need for this anymore." He shucked off his glove and forearm guard, tossing them in his bag before unzipping his vest most of the way. "Cooler than some armor I've worn, but still too damn hot."
Logan nodded, leading the charge out of the building. Not having wheels of his own in the garage, they settled for a cab ride and some friendly locals to tell them where the best place to eat was. As they settled at a table, Logan looked over the menu. "Not bad." He glanced at Scott. It was the first time they'd been out of the tower together. "You good?" It was asked casually. Logan didn't want to treat Scott like he was made of spun glass, but he also didn't want the man putting too much pressure on himself for the sake of a simple outing or trying to normalize things again.
Clint, clearly pleased with the praise, stroked Darien steadily. "Like getting me off that much, hm? Could do with more of that later. Love feeling those lips wrapped around my cock, using your throat..." he purred, giving Darien's cock a good squeeze as if to drive the point home.
Hank, ever difficult to offend, laughed heartily. "I am Henry McCoy. You can call me Hank. Or Beast," he said, offering a hand.
Steve groaned but still rewarded Tony with a kiss. "I think I need to take you up on that policy. For reasons of scrubbing my mind clean. You think you can help me out with that? At least give me more attractive dirty things to picture?" He smirked and let one hand slide down to Tony's hip. "We have a whole day before we have to have to face the world. I want to spend it with you." Steve dove in for a kiss, knowing Tony wasn't likely to mind.
The archer looked more shocked than angry, but his expression leveled out a moment later, and he looked at Coulson. "If this is what it takes. I do want to see her. You game?"
That brought a smile to Steve’s face, and he nodded. “I guess it’s a hard habit to shake. SHIELD gave me a chance to keep helping people, and that seemed like the thing to do. It’s all I wanted to do in the first place.” Though he knew it wasn’t really his place to make the offer, he added, “Maybe when you’re feeling more like yourself again... maybe we can find something for you to do around here. Somebody has to make the coffee,” Steve deadpanned.
“You okay?” Bucky asked as he rounded the corner. He could see the anxiety bunched in Steve’s muscles through the white T-shirt his friend was wearing. It did not take a rocket scientist to work out what was troubling Steve; Tony Stark seemed to be all the other man could talk or think about. Bucky felt an irrational stab of jealousy whenever the topic had been brought up. Something had happened to Tony, something awful that no one wanted to talk about. It was as if everyone - including Steve - was walking on eggshells around him. It didn’t help that he was starting to remember things. Vague images crept into his mind, brief and blinding like the flash bulb of a camera. Bucky had no idea what they meant or how it connected, but he didn’t care for the implications. “Only reason I ask,” he continued, keeping his tone light despite his dark thoughts, “is because I’m worried you’re gonna mess up that pretty face with all that frowning.”
Outside the door, Clint clenched his jaw, drawing his bow. He didn't like the tone in Logan's voice. The cadence was just the same as when the mutant had threatened Clint earlier.
The uncomfortable truth hung in the air until Coulson spoke a few orders to a waiting agent. The man looked startled but unlocked a cell for them just the same. Phil gave Natasha's hand a final squeeze as she stepped into the cell. "We'll both be here. I'll keep you in the loop as much as we're able to."
Scott, who had suited up for the occasion though he'd warned Fury it might be the last time for a long while, shook his head. He didn't want to talk. He wanted to find Loki and kill the god, preferably painfully. It was a grudge match, and he also wasn't about to let Logan go and get himself killed - even temporarily - without being by his side. He felt for Steve, who would be grounded for the mission and stuck listening in. "I always thought Grand Central looks better with a skylight anyway. Let's do this."
The archer had the decency to blush, worrying the bag of chips in his hands. "Uh, thanks." He was surprised the woman didn't want to know what had happened to them, but then if she'd seen Coulson in action, she'd probably already assumed it was something utterly insane.
Clint tilted his head at the pair. "I'm sorry, are you two even old enough to drive?" he asked, already feeling overwhelmed by Simmons' bubbly enthusiasm. He'd heard of the two in passing, had assumed indeed that they were one entity and that that entity was at least Tony's age given the accomplishments he’d heard along with the name.
"I can make sandwiches. And toast. Bacon and eggs," Clint said in his own half-hearted defense. "But you should know that if you feed me, you'll never get rid of me. I'm like a stray cat." He settled at the island bar, watching Clint work for a few moments before offering, "I could help, if you like. Cut veggies or something. I mean, it can't be that different from precisely eviscerating someone, right?" he asked, tone and expression leaving it unclear how serious he was.
Coulson snapped to his feet the second the doors opened. The doctor looked exhausted, which was a terrible sign considering it had been less than ten minutes. A sick feeling of fear washed through him. "Status?"
"You'll get them," he answered quietly. "Whichever ones you desire, Captain."
"You... are going... to give me a heart attack," Tony murmured as he pressed a few kisses to whatever part of Steve he could reach without really moving too much. "Or brain damage. I'm not sure how long I'm supposed to be able to live with this much blood below my neckline." It was frustrating, sure, but the teasing was also rather endearing. In a maddening way. "Damn you and your discipline."
The god seemed to think on it a moment, then tilted his head. "Would that not fuel your rage toward your enemy and make you that much more mighty?"
Steve wasn't quite so sure about that. He was fairly certain that the greatest danger when it came to Loki was from his words not his actions, but he sighed heavily. It was a big decision. It was a terrible decision. He could turn away a man who by all appearances genuinely needed and wanted a second chance, or he could give him a death sentence. From the sound of things, Loki wasn't particularly interested in the idea of a life without purpose, and that twanged more than a few warnings signals along the way for Steve. He finally turned to Tony. "I need to know if you really think this is something that could work. You heard more than we have, and I won't ask you to tell me, but with what you know... can this work? Can we trust him?"
"Is it weird that I get goosebumps when you do that?" Tony asked, giving Steve a look that made it completely unclear as to whether he was serious.
Phil woke immediately at the slightest motion from Clint. He tensed and then relaxed. He was still lying by Clint's side, and he could see the tangle of Natasha's hair against Clint's other shoulder. He shifted just enough to kiss Clint's cheek. "Morning." Even if they did have to go be heroes all too soon, for the moment they were curled up in bed. It was just them. Well, the three of the, but he didn't exactly consider Natasha an intrusive presence. "You ready?"
"At least it's enough time to shower."
"I think if I knew that, I'd be a lot less of a mess," Scott answered with a snort, "but maybe. I just know I should figure it out." He knew how it sounded, how it was. He was talking about walking away from the only thing he really knew how to do. "I should learn to tend bar or something. I don't think SHIELD will appreciate me hanging out here if I'm not doing field work." He paused. "I guess there's paperwork. I can probably file things, maintain the motor pool or something."
In which Asgard finally joins the action.
"And what degree of commitment are you planning to - "
Simmons added, "It's honestly quite a thrill to be able to work so closely with the original blueprints. The ones we worked with before... well, of course, they weren't official. This is far more detailed." There was no sense of bravado in the words, as if it never occurred to either of them that someone might not be able to put together the puzzle of the arc reactor. She pulled the schematic up on the holographic board and gazed at it lovingly. "Beautiful."
Tony grinned, squirming a little to shift and unzip Steve's pants sufficiently to let him slide his hand in. "Good enough," he agreed, leaning down for a long, slow kiss. "Hope you're as flexible as you are ripped, or this's gonna be awkward as hell." After all, neither of the men were exactly short. Tony had managed to get in a good fuck or two in much more cramped spaces. Deciding they'd worry about it one step at a time, Tony lightly trailed his fingers over Steve's cock before leaning down to give one of the man's nipples a few light licks and beginning to suckle at it.
Clint's phone had gone off a moment after Phil's - a sure sign it was work-related - and he looked up from his attempts to retrieve his own copy of the message. "Well... I guess that's not the worst news we've had lately," he decided, relaxing back into his lover. He still held a bit of tension in his spine, though, as he leaned against Phil. "Dammit, can't someone else save the world for once?" he groused, trying to focus on anything else and failing miserably. "I vote we build a blanket fort and refuse to come out until this blows over."
Tony swallowed another mouthful, and then reached for a piece of garlic bread. "True. But, if I didn't know you and you cooked a meal like this, I'd hire you as my personal chef." It took a hell of a lot to impress Tony, and he appreciated Steve's effort more than he could ever hope to express. Cleaning his plate was a good place to start. "Tell you what: you keep pampering me like this, Captain Rogers, and I might never want to leave."
Natasha whispered back, "Not much farther. We can drop down just outside the main room up here. Should give us the advantage of not being seen right away."
"Don't get too excited, Hairy. I think Clint might take exception to your interest," Tony remarked, putting down his paper and gathering up his few belongings to toss into his suitcase. "Don't think he could kill you, but an arrow in the eye socket might kinda ruin your cheerful disposition."
"We'll probably do the sticking for them. As a courtesy," Clint said with a nod. From what he knew, the "Agency" was barely better than the dead thugs laying around the factory, and he had a feeling SHIELD would be making a very convincing argument for them to stay the hell away from Fawkes. "For the record, we're not in the habit of pressing people into service. I have a feeling that the Director will give you options on whether you stick with us and how closely, but right now, it won't be good for either one of us if you decide to run away." He glanced at a small device from his belt before putting it away again. "Looks like your handlers are moving in to see what's going on. If you want out of this mess, I strongly recommend you follow me. Otherwise, I have orders to put you down." He knew it sent a mixed message; threatening Darien with his life while simultaneously promising him the option of freedom, but those were his orders, and he'd given up a long time ago trying to figure out what made Fury tick.
At first Darien couldn't reply. He couldn't think. Frankly he wasn't sure he was awake. It struck him then that kinky as his dreams were, this went above and beyond. Swallowing hard and using the stinging in his ass to remind him that he needed to react appropriately, Darien managed, "You." He hadn't even known Clint two days before. It was surreal to be tied up in front of strangers professing that the man held some kind of ownership over him, temporary or not. It wasn't bad, though. It wasn't bad at all. The way his cock strained for attention was a testament to that even if Darien had no idea what the hell was going on. "Belong to you," he clarified in case his first dazed response wasn't good enough.
Coulson found himself looking down, unable to watch the intimacy in front of him. It had nothing to do with the kissing and everything to do with the quiver in Tony's voice and the way the two men looked at each other. He wondered why it has taken them so long to notice that they fit together so well it was a little disturbing.
"The more you work the less you think."
Fitz took the station next to hers, and the two of them started in, continually leaning over to tap something on one another's screens. "Jemma! That was- oh, you're right. I didn't carry the two."
It was a tease, but they both knew it, and that was just fine. A little teasing could be very nice when well applied. "I should probably note that the expansive permissions in regard to touching also extend to undressing. Again, with the provision that it not be done at the office unless there's a locked door between us and the world." He'd never been more thankful for having a private office. Never. With the shirt partially undone, the scar across his chest was clearly visible, and he caught Clint’s gaze lingering on it. "I guess there are worse ways to pick up new scars than being skewered by a deity from another world."
Logan had to fight not to smirk at that a little. //Don't encourage 'im.// "So, Steve, what about this demi-god o' yours? We talkin' about something like Magneto, or is this one o' those deals where I'm gonna get turned inside-out a few times before we win?"
//So he can hear really well on top of the whole healing thing. I really need to start reading briefs.// Trying to salvage some of his pride, Clint focused his attention back on Coulson. "They need to hurry up and tell us something." It wasn't a rational expectation, but he couldn't quite suppress the thought.
Tony poked at one of the files, brow furrowed as he paged through its contents. "Yeah, speaking of Thor, where is he? Shouldn't he already be here to put the little shit in time-out?"
"And close," Scott reminded him with a hint of a smile. "I meant what I said about not rushing things, but I mean, if I did end up living 'off campus,' so to speak, and you happened to have a drawer for your stuff and stay over sometimes, I don't think that would be awful." He nudged Logan's foot under the table. "I kind of think that would be perfect." When the waiter came, Scott gave his order and then waited for Logan to do the same. He'd never actually dated a guy, and he had no idea what Logan was like in a relationship, so he asked, "Can I hold your hand? I dunno how you feel about PDA."
"Good point." Steve smiled and kissed Tony's shoulder, then his neck. "In that case, I'd better take care of your heart instead." It was a loaded statement and a cheesy one to boot, but Steve didn't really care. He'd been accused of being ridiculously old fashioned and far too nice. Tony needed a little of both from time to time. "So we talked about a vacation. Where exactly do billionaire playboys go on a romantic vacation? And if you start telling me about all the girls you took someplace, you're gonna be surprised how fast I forget you have stitches and push you out of bed."
It was a dream come true - a dream he'd fought very hard not to think about or remember in waking hours. It was dangerous to let himself remember. It was dangerous to let himself think about how much he wanted Clint when there was no way.... but there was, apparently. Clint was right there. Phil knew he hadn't drunk enough to be so far gone. He was drunk on something else, on the sight of Clint on his knees looking sexy as hell and licking his cock. Though one of his hands moved to Clint's hair, Phil didn't force anything. He didn't want to rush or risk doing anything to break the spell that kept them there together in that moment.
Scott was still busy staring at Logan like he was speaking Greek, but finally he snorted and took the shot that Natasha had handed him. "I think I'm flattered. You slept with Iron Man and Captain America, and you still thought I was worth picking up." He shrugged and made sure they all had something to drink in hand. "That's worth drinking to."
Natasha stared back at the man before finally smiling. "Why don't you come in and let me show you how I like to play?" She even tugged down the zipper on her uniform. "C'mon... not scared, are you?"
"You don't really do PC, do you?" Jean asked, quirking an eyebrow.
“Tony?” Bucky asked, glancing down at his hand in Steve’s. “Oh, right... they mentioned something about a Tony, but I really didn’t understand.” He gave another slight shake of his head, only to wish he hadn’t a moment later. The drugs had left his head swimming despite his good moon, and a soft groan pressed his lips apart as he fought against an impending migraine. “We were found together... or rescued... or something.” Bucky peered at Steve as if he had the answers to everything. “None of it makes any sense to me.”
Phil squeezed the hand so carefully entwined with his own. "Then it was only to my friends. I'd graduated college before I told my mom. She spent a long time being really angry, but not really with me. With the universe, I guess. Eventually she realized that she wasn't going to have grandchildren whether I dated a man or a woman. She kind of gave up, really, but it made life easier for both of us." He gave Clint a quick smile. "Or did you want the more explicit version?"
"Forget? No." Logan seemed to consider for a moment, then offered, "I'd be willin' to keep it to myself in exchange for beer, though."
Not entirely convinced of the plan considering the fact that Bruce had obviously given recent and very intense thought to killing Tony, Natasha frowned. Looking especially at Bruce, she asked, "You sure you boys can play nicely without supervision?"
Clint smiled grimly even though he knew Phil wouldn't see it with his head pressed to the man's shoulder. He held onto his lover tight, trying to give comfort as much as take it. Years of experience had taught his mind and body to take sleep where they could, and the archer soon managed to drift off.
Steve tried not to look as annoyed by the remark as he felt and instead nodded his acceptance of the advice before veering down the hallway toward the room where they had Bucky sequestered. Bruce looked up and offered Steve a smile a beat before Bucky turned as well. Bucky managed a quick, flickering smile. “Nice to know some things never do change - some of us haven’t aged a day.”
"You know, it might be slightly less insulting if you didn't say 'babysitting' to my face," Tony pointed out, though he didn't actually seem offended. "I'd take some coffee and pastries for breakfast. That means after ten because you're not Steve. And not from the chow hall. I don't know what I'm paying those chefs for, but it's apparently not good food."
"Let's make this interesting. We play a round of I've Never Ever. I say something I've done, and if either of you have, you do a shot, then you say something... basically until we're too drunk to remember how to form sentences," Natasha explained. She got a nod of approval from Scott and thought it through. "I've never fought in an actual war."
"It's only gonna get better," Steve promised. He used Tony's distraction as the perfect moment to slide a third finger inside his body. The more Tony groaned and writhed, the more impatient he grew, but waiting would be worth it when he finally slid home. Just the thought of that tight, hot ass around his cock and Tony's muscular legs wrapped around him drew a groan from Steve. He was kissing the man's neck aimlessly just to keep some sort of focus on the moment. Shifting so that his lips were against Tony's ear, he murmured, "I can't wait to be inside you."
"So, you need us to keep a lower profile?"
Logan couldn't help the faint smirk tugging at his lips. They were adorable, really. Oddly right for one another. He briefly wondered about the age difference before remembering he had a couple centuries on his own boyfriend. "You might want her to step back, unless you're plannin' to just bring 'er with us," he remarked, smirking faintly.
"Not a word," Fury admitted. He paused when Melinda May swept into the room. She took a seat without a word. "Agent May has agreed to help us out for the duration. We need warm bodies, and her skills should be a strong addition."
"Huh. Well, good luck to him." On the scale of unlikely matches, that sounded way up there. Scott smiled faintly to himself.
Victor smirked up at Phil. "Drop the gun," he growled. His fingers tightened on Clint's neck, claws drawing pinpricks of blood. "I mean it."
The look on Logan's face was perfect. The fact that he was letting Scott drive the bus was even better. Scott knew how much Logan liked being in control, but he didn't act the least bit put out or frustrated at the fact that Scott was setting the pace. Of course Scott didn't push the advantage either. He wanted to let Logan lose himself in the moment, not torture him. Knowing that Logan wouldn't take anything he wasn't giving made Scott even keener to pay attention to every little thing that told him when it felt especially good so that he could do those things again and again until he could make Logan fall apart.
"Okay," Clint said, letting himself melt against Phil's form. He tried to keep it out of his head, but there was little to distract him, and the archer finally started to shake with silent sobs, clinging to his handler. After several long minutes, he finally pulled himself together, sniffling quietly. Taking a deep breath, he muttered, "Be right back," thickly and moved to the sink to wash his face off. Feeling vaguely more together if not necessarily better, Clint settled against Coulson, all but adhering himself to the other man once more. "Thank you," he murmured. "For being here. For always being there." Remembering when they'd thought Phil dead, he hesitated. "Well, as much as you could be."
The arch expression softened into something warmer. "You weren't figuring it out on your own. Boys are stupid," Natasha answered as though it was the most obvious thing in the world. "This one," she poked behind her at the chest she was leaning against, "hadn't even realized how often he was leering at you. It was time to make a move or end up in HR with a sexual harassment tag on his file. You too, Phil, so stop looking so smug. Honestly, the two of you are ridiculous."
Tony, his defenses broken, was unable to do anything except submit. A thick haze covered his mind, and he found himself hallucinating. Steve appeared before him, taunting and teasing him. The hand touching him was Steve's, and Tony nearly fell apart at the sensual stroke. "I... I want to grab you," he believed he was telling Steve, "kiss you... rip your clothes off..." Groaning deep in his throat, he shifted his hips in a desperate attempt for more contact. "Throw you down... and fuck you..."
Steve covered his face with his hands and groaned. "Tony..." He couldn't bring himself to really scold the man when it was ultimately the reporter's fault for invading their privacy. He sighed and fixed his date with a level stare. "So is she really?" Steve broke into a smile and  looked up at the sound of yelling. "I guess that's a yes. People in glass houses need to learn to stop throwing so many stones." It was frustrating that they were the subject of so much scrutiny simply by virtue of being attracted to each other and wanting to explore it. He felt sure that there had to be more important things going on in the world. "You're an awful influence. Really. I should care that his marriage is falling apart on the phone in a middle of a restaurant... and instead I'm kind of thinking he deserves it."
"Translation is that apparently Tony thinks he and the suit just weren't close enough," Bruce answered, still giving Tony his most judgmental stare.
At Scott's question, Clint gave Logan a faint, triumphant smirk. It was met with a glower before Logan replied, "Yeah. First thing we do when this is over is dinner. Even if it's six in the mornin'," he agreed as his gaze shifted back to Scott. He'd noted Scott grabbing the shades and it pained him to think that he might be losing the opportunity to see Scott's eyes for their first time together.
"That seems dangerous. Or is Stark's reputation as a lush just bad press?" Scott followed just the same. If the team really was getting to know Logan, they already knew better than to steal the man's booze - or would soon. It was a good way to end up with adamantium jammed through your eye socket. As much as he wasn't sure he was ready to fall in with any kind of team again, Scott had to admit that the Avengers had pretty posh digs. The place looked like a million bucks. With Stark's budget, he suspected it had cost a whole lot more than that. "What are they like? Outside all the press, what are the Avengers really like?"
"Logan! Wait!" Clint felt his heart sink as the man charged forward. He was struck with fear and indecision: chase Logan and make sure the man wasn't alone, or risk the possibility it was a ploy to separate them from one another?
"Ultimatums. Very unfair. You play a tough game, Cap." Tony's own pulse was definitely hammering in his veins, though, and ignoring the strong arms around him and the warm body pressed against his own was just too much to ask. "I think I'll take the tall drink I've already got," he decided, his arms wrapping around Steve's waist and pulling their bodies together as he closed the last little distance for a kiss. It was as good as he'd always imagined. Steve felt as strong and gentle as he had always seemed.
"Coulson, you tell me I'm bad at following directions," Clint grunted, managing to back away from Victor a bit further. He'd lost a few of the arrow heads in the scuffle, including the acid rounds that were most effective against Creed. The hulking mutant stood between Hawkeye and a decent escape route, and with his handler backed in there with him, just leaving wasn't an option, anyway.
That one movement was enough to destroy any lingering doubts Coulson might have had about what they were doing. He grabbed the back of Clint's head and crushed their lips together. He let adrenaline take over. It was like being on a mission. For a brief moment, everything but the man against him disappeared. With his other hand on Clint's hip, Coulson couldn't help wondering if it would all be real once he sobered up.
In which Tony and Steve meet the press and go on a proper(ish) date.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're very well preserved, Mr. Rogers," Tony grinned, "if you don't mind my saying so." The easy banter and the warm atmosphere of being in Steve's company made Tony feel more alive than he had in ages. He could not imagine returning to his room and drowning himself in misery. Not after tonight. Tony Stark was officially back in the game. He would bear the scars of what had happened for the rest of his life, but he refused to let the painful memories rule him any longer.
Tony wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and grinned, gingerly moving back to Steve's side. "I think I could get on board with that," he decided. Much as he enjoyed having Steve fuck him senseless, he was very interested to try the other side of equation. He sagged against his lover. "Maybe we could talk to medical tomorrow, find out for sure when they can unstitch me. I mean, it's gonna be hard to step on Creed's throat if they won't let me out of a wheelchair." He paused, cocking his head to one side. "Maybe I could make a wheelchair version of the suit...."
"I'll build myself a new one if it falls off," Tony decided, but wiggled a little to get his arm into a position that would allow some blood flow.
"Doctor's orders. You're in the chair until you're up to Tony's room. Then I pretend that I haven't seen you doing anything at all that you shouldn't be doing," Coulson assured. "Just play along for a few minutes."
