While an analysis of the goop was going, he did some more physical tests of his body. If his muscle mass had risen, could he lift more? Could he aim the goop? Was it possible to shoot strings of it? Could he stick and unstick to things?
“Scans for…?”
“Not sorry,” Wade laughed. “Just had to good a time to care.”
Tony gaped, looking between Steve and Barnes in total confusion. Barnes didn't look ready to help him, just watching and looking equally confused. Maybe he shouldn't have fixed Barnes arm if the bastard was going to be like this.
“Since you’ve fired the nannies,” Jarvis drawled. “Should I wake you when Young Sir awakens?”
“Right,” Tony yawned, moving instead to the kitchen as Peter ran ahead of him, jumping up onto a bar stool. “Start the bath. Jay, is the coffee ready?”
“I nearly died during birth, and I probably would have. But, thankfully, I didn't. I've just been released from the hospital, last week, and I'm sure Thanatos is waiting for me. So, I leave Peter to you. Hopefully, you keep him.
The author is questioning their life choices, and is regretting taking so much time on this chapter.
They all laughed, but Steve turned to him almost shyly. He held up the ring, and Tony rolled his eyes, putting it on. He gave Steve the one he had, and watched as the blond slipped it on. Well, it hadn’t gone as planned, but it still worked out in the end.
He hung up and tried not to get back to work. It didn't work. He was just to excited.
“This would apply to Spiderman and Deadpool,” Pepper insisted. He knew she hated that he was associated with the ‘Merc with a Mouth’ Deadpool, even under the radar, but Tony had always pushed the concern away. But as she said that, Tony found a new interest in the letter in his hands.
After a moment of smiling at the picture, taking in Wade smiling back at him, Peter set the picture on his bedside table, and finally drifted off to sleep.
“No no no no no,” Rhodey said quickly. “The less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?”
“Dad?” the insane mercenary asked.
“It's hard to run facial recognition on a child when no child has ever been to the house, sir.”
Harry had asked him on several occasions if they'd met before, and Peter always said no. He didn't want Harry to know that he was really Peter Stark, since Harry was sort of an attention hog. If he knew, he'd flaunt being the Bestest Friend of
STARK: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.
Tony had just a second to see her hit the button, and run before the first wave pushed him out of the way, and into a wall. Stane, heavier, didn’t move, and was caught in the second wave of the blast, his suit over powered as the entire factory went out, and he fell into the large reactor.
"Couldn't see you hurt. I saw Peter die, and I couldn't… I couldn't risk you. I love you. So much… And I just- I couldn't risk you too."
“It works,” Tony said, shifting his hold on Peter.
It was clear that Bucky was uncomfortable being the one Peter was having this talk with. He looked about ready to just back up into the elevator and leave. But Peter needed advice, and with his dad and pops gone, Bucky was the only one to give it.
The cadets were all snickering, and one looked just about to die from his red face. Tony smiled, though Peter seemed confused.
“What?” the mercenary gasps, turning to Tony in a gasp that can only be defined as betrayal. “No, seriously? None of these guys were good, and this guy-” Deadpool gesture wildly to the pinned man behind him. “-is the one i’ve been looking for! Trust me, that wheezing bag of dick tips had it coming!”
“Well…” He started to squirm. “I wanted… to know about my mom.”
They were cleaning up the streets, slowly working their way through Queens, and getting everything into some sense of order.
“What happened?” Wade asked, his voice slurred as he blinked himself to wakefulness.
team. Call me old fashioned.”
Since his escape, Thanos had been collecting the Stones, one by one, at a rapid pace. Somehow, maybe the same way Wade had, Thanos was masking the energy signature of the Stones as he traveled between them. It was impossible to track him, and impossible to figure out where he would be next.
And Tony just hugged him, because Rhodey had to deal with so much of his fucking crap. They went back to the states after that. And, God, when the plane's ramp finally lowered, showing him everyone standing there, waiting for him… Pepper, with her red eyes and serious face, stood with the one person Tony needed right now, hands on Peter’s shoulders, as the body stood frozen in place.
“Dr. Conners?” Gwen asks, blinking in surprise. “You mean Curtis Connors? I red one of his papers. It was really, really cool.”
“Uh,” he said, glancing at the guards and police officers gathered around. “I hid on the roof?”
So, with a cry of rage, Wade charged down the hill, drawing his katanas and ready to kill a titan.
“Same drill,” Tony said simple. “They’ve been dealing under the table, and I’m going to stop them. I’m going to find my weapons and destroy them.”
“So,” Rhodey said, humming. “No Pepper or Peter? She’s not bringing him?”
Tony and Peter deal with some shit, and the Mandarin happens.
If Tony didn’t want to die from a bunch of red and white carnations growing in his chest, eventually suffocating him to death, he could go to a special surgeon, who happened to live in New York, and get them removed. There was, however, a side effect that made the treatment undesirable. If the flowers were surgically removed, every feeling every memory, of the person the feelings were aimed for would be gone. Tony would lose every memory of Steve. Another option would be for Steve to return the feelings, and kiss Tony to prove it like in some fairy tale.
“You forgot your birthday.”
“You and I have never seen eye to eye, but I know that you can be better then this. You can be better then the crazy mercenary. You can be a hero. Start training to join the team. You just need to make the right decision-!”
“Tony will take care of it,” Steve said, frowning at them. God, they looked like they were just kids…
“They will be,” his dad said, only for Pops to shoot him a look.
Tony blinked. “What? You…? You never graduated?”
Turning, Wade took in the sight of the younger man standing in the hallway behind him. He took in the sight of familiar brown eyes, and that wonderful mess of brown hair. While the suit he wore was metalic and unfamiliar, it was recognizable as one Wade had seen him in so often during their nightly patrols.
XxXXxX
“Who are you?” Steve demanded. “How did you get in here?”
“Uh, maybe not start with that.”
Peter wailed louder, burying his face in Tony’s shoulder. Mumblings came out, incoherent words that Tony really didn’t care what they meant. With a deep breath, Tony hefted Peter up, holding him to his chest as he smiled at Pepper.
Nearly three months passed of this, Steve venting to Bucky all the while.
“My dad is out of country,” Peter says before principal Morita can say anything. “You’ll have to call my aunt, or my uncle. Probably my uncle. My aunt is probably in a meeting.”
It went about as well as Wade had expected. Steve asked him tense questions, eyeing him like a patriotic eagle, and Tony mostly just talked with Peter. It was still weird to think that Peter was the son of Tony Stark, billionaire and Iron Man, and now the stepson of Steve Rogers, World War Two vet and Captain America. And here he was, mercenary for hire, Wade Wilson.
“The team’s gathering for a movie night,” Steve replied. It was always something about the team. ‘The team was having a game day’ or ‘Team breakfast’. It was never just Steve… “Do you think you’re alright enough to come join us?”
A pained look spread across Tony's face. The rest of the team in the room quickly vacated the room, Natasha carefully placing Susan in Tony's lap. Tony turned to look down at their little girl, soothing her little head of blond locks.
“Breaking news,” the reporter said as Steve took his bowl to the sink. “A multi car collision turns shots fired out on the freeway. The assailant appears to be wearing what looks like a red suit, and wielding both guns and swords.”
“I’m sorry,” he said with Jarvis voice, “That was… odd. Thank you.”
Peter chewed his lip, and nodded as he swiped the holograms out of existence. He could look at it later, but his Dad couldn’t wait. “Thanks, Friday.”
Taking a deep breath, he soldiers on. "If you can, please take this tape to the Avengers Tower in New York City on Earth. The Avengers need to know. One of the men that I was fighting alongside, a Doctor Strange, he looked into the future. He looked into every possible outcome of our fights, everything that could be done to stop Thanos. And he said that there was only one way we won. And it's this. We had to lose, we had to fail. Because Thanos was ready to take us down at every turn while on his mission to get the stones. But now that he's won? He won't be ready for us to come back and Avenge the ones who were lost.
Knowing that he wouldn't get anything done, Tony made his way down stairs to the basement. Just as he had been hours ago, Steve was pacing in front of Wade's cell, clearly near the end of his rope.
Quickly, Tony gathered up the bits and prices of the arm, and scurried off to the elevator to get to the lab.
“Put that on the table over there. It’s irrelevant. I want you to reach in, and you’re just going to gently lift the wire out.”
about it.
“Someone seemed to have cut power, temporarily, to the network,” the AI said quickly. “However, there is something, or rather, someone at the door.”
But as the words came out of his mouth, Steve knew what she meant. Tony would do anything to fix his Ultron mistake. Even if it meant making a bigger, badder Ultron that would kill the first one.
This time… he wasn't the only one leaning in. Tony's eyes darted back and forth between Steve's eyes and his lips, as Steve was taking in every little speck of detail in Tony's face. He could feel Tony's breath on his lips, and he moved to close the last few inches between them and kiss him like he should have.
“It’s not that simple.”
*Edit, like, five seconds after posting* There are still tags missing! I only just finished chapter 3! And no, I do not want to panic you! I will not be killing off Peter in the future! I think.
“Are those bullet holes?”
In an instant, Weasel froze. Wade watched as he blinked, turning with wide eyed. He set down his drink mixer, coming out from behind the bar as he looked to where Wade was hiding in the shadows.
and they were going to get married! They were going to get married, and oh boy was Peter going to be upset that he missed this!
“It would, of course, have been easier if I had put him up for adoption, I know, and you just might, but I wanted to do my best to prevent that. I was in the foster system myself, since I was three, and the living conditions at so many of the foster homes and orphanages are terrible. Older kids, at all the places I went to, usually beat of the younger ones, since they had a better chance of adoption. But because of my condition, Peter would never get a chance.
“So Thor didn’t say where he was going?” Tony asked, deciding that it was a much safer topic.
“I know it’s been a busy day,” Tony said, chuckling as he led Wade down. “But I figured that I would give you your merc gear now. I was thinking about making you a body suit, to help keep bullets off you and stuff, but I didn’t have your measurements so I just made a pair of pistols and had a pair of swords specially made. Katana’s, even. You’re favorite, right?”
“Would you look at that,” Francis chuckled. “Breathless already.”
“-what was his name? Wasn’t it Ian?”
“Right. Later…”
“Yeah,” he agreed breathily, and watched as Steve nodded, gave him a smile, and then walked off.
Surging forward, Wade wrapped his arms around Peter, pulling him against him. He held on, refusing to let go, and ready to hold onto the messy brunette for the rest of their lives.
For a minute or so, they sat in tense silence. Tony's mind kept realing, trying to come up with a solution, for if Steve wasn't going to heal. Captain America was a good symbol. Even after the Accords, he was still held as a symbol of peace, strength, and victory. He was a war hero, one kids looked up to, and adults were willing to listen to, when the going got tough. They could never truly replace Steve, but if they were lucky, they could find someone who would at least have the potential to fill the gap. Iron Man wouldn't be as missed, with Peter having the Iron Spider, and Tony able to pilot remotely.
Bucky didn’t say anything to that, and after a while of Bucky kinda just… watching them play card games, they decided to let Bucky get used to his new floor. Steve led Sam up to the floor above Bucky’s, just below the penthouse and Tony’s lab, which Steve knew was his floor. He didn’t mind the idea of sharing it with Sam. In fact, it would probably be fun to share a living space with someone again.
"Tony," Steve tried. "That's not-"
“Tony-”
Wade laughed. He full on laughed, a true and genuine laugh. It was refreshing, a weight lifted from his shoulders, now that Peter was there to stand by his side. Tears pricked at the corner of his eyes, and he took a deep breath, blinking them away.
“He’s insane, Tony! He needs to be brought in before-” His pops cut off, noticing him in the door. “Oh, hey Pete. You’re home early… Why aren’t you at the skatepark with your friends?”
The rash, now that he had noticed it, was starting to itch horribly. So, so terribly itchy. Once he got his phone unstuck from his hand, he started scratching, going to look for some ointment to put on it. He stretched and bend his wrist, rubbing it with one hand, until he heard a soft
"Wade?" Tony asked. He was surprised to see the young man there. Steve had told him, when he was filling Tony in, that Wade had snapped, started talking crazy about things Steve didn't understand. And now, Wade had an Infinity Stone in his possession. If he really had gone crazy, then this was cause for concern.
But, for whatever reason, nothing did happen. No baddies or training, no meetings or random muggings. Nothing. And it actually put Steve more on edge as he actually met Tony at eleven.
"Peter?" Steve asked anyway, voice shaking.
STARK: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
"Jesus, Cap," Clint said, shaking his head. "That the hell did you do?"
“Speed bump, what does that mean?”
With a sigh, Wade finally went down the stairs that would take him back to the bar, ready for the howls of laughter that would come when everyone saw him. He took it in stride, ignoring most of it, and was quick to be on his way. No need to keep hearing the laughter if he didn’t have to.
“People change.” His voice was a heavy deadpan, and he wanted this guy to just get to the point already. What did he want? Why was he here? Did he have something to help him or not?
“I never said that you were a superhero.”
“What?”
“This one is important,” she told him. “I really think you should take a look at it.
They were spit up into three different groups, with one three person group and one four person group merging together to do a rotation around the different facilities. Peter didn't know any of the people in the three person group that joined them, though he was more interested in what they saw.
“Breathe,” the sickeningly familiar voice said as stared at the device in Obadiah’s hands. “Easy, easy… You remember this one, right? It’s a shame the government didn’t approve it. There’s so many applications for causing short-term paralysis.”
When they reached the gate, Wade pulled it open. They stepped inside the park, walking into the table area to look as teens and young adults all bustle around. Wades eyes went to the skate area, scanning each area for Peter. They needed to find him fast, before Francis did.
But, the lights were out, and a man stood at the far end of the living room, looking out of the floor to wall.
As Steve moved to stand before his table, which now included Pietro and Wanda, who were sort of just there to hang out with Clint, they all looked up at him expectantly. Clearly, they’d been filling Wanda and Pietro in on what was happening.
“Heard that too!”
STARK:  Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.
“Let’s see them,” he said quickly. “Show me your hands, before Peter comes down and ends up seeing.” She lifts her hands, staring. “Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite indeed. I just need your help for a sec.”
“Dad!”
“I’m fine,” Tony said as he hid the flowers in the cloth. “Just a chest cold. Did you need something, Steve?”
“It is currently six eighteen, Sir,” Jarvis said rather chipperly. “And the coffee machine has already started. It is currently 62 degrees outside, with a supposed high of 82 degrees. High tide has already passed, though there is a fair chance of higher waves this evening.”
Steve did his best to stay focused. He led his team, tried to keep them all together and calm. Wilson wasn’t helping, starting to talk to himself again. Steve thought about making him be quiet, but… The man was a good fighter. They could need him.
Peter jumped, eyes wide as he covered his mouth with one hand to keep from making any noise. Bucky wanted to… leave? Leave what? The team? The Tower? The country? Why?
Steve frowned, turning to look at the mercenary. Much to is his horror, Deadpool was sawing off his own arm, using a serrated knife. Steve’s face screwed up in disgust and when he pulled up to try and get the maniac to stop, a spurt of blood caught him in the face. He turned, feeling the bile rising in his throat before a pair of feet were pressing into his side, knocking him off balance as Deadpool back flipped off the side of the bridge. Steve took a deep breath, dropped the arm, and turned to Tony.
“A lot of mercenaries have someone that they leave instructions for if they don’t come back from a job,” Weasel was saying, his hands stuffed into his pockets as he stood awkwardly. “I was… Well, I’m that guy for a lot of the mercs that come into the bar, but I’m supposed to do it for Wade, to. He had this box set up for months, just told me that if he was two weeks late to come back, that I bring it here. Don’t really know what’s in it, didn’t really look, but I’m pretty sure it’s for Peter, so…”
Tony beamed at the wall. “Perfect~ See you then, Capsicle.”
After testing came more building. Flight stabilizer this time. Peter was let out of his space during this time, and clung to his leg as as he did the 3D hologram modeling. By the time he was on to second building stage, it was dinner time, and Pepper was coming down to get him.
He supposed that was a good thing, though. If he ever did get close enough to touch Peter, Wade would probably grab him and just… stay there. Never letting go, and never moving.
Steve could only stare, watching as the boy rolled the old man away. Peter… It couldn’t be. It couldn’t be Peter! The man had to be at least in his nineties. It couldn’t be his Peter. It wasn’t possible! He watched them go, and turned to look at the tombstone that sat before him. At the inscription, Steve nearly let out a wail.
For the first time in years, Peter heard his aunt heave a sigh. She placed her head in her hands, rubbing her temples with her fingers. She looked absolutely exhausted…
“Dysprosium,” Mrs. Warren corrected gently. “You like to go by Ned?”
Steve looked up, eyes wide as if he hadn’t been expecting that. “Really?”
For a moment, Tony had been touched, loving the way that Steve seemed to draw every little detail of the armor. Sure, Steve probably had drawings of the other Avengers to, but this one was of Tony. It made him feel… special.
In the end, he had to move to get on the suit, ready to head to Sokovia to face Ultron. He sat in the back as he finalized Friday’s full installation into the suit, while Steve gave everyone a speech. It was Steve’s thing, what he did to help work everything out. He was a good leader that way.
“I’m fine. How are-”
“Healing-factor?” Ned said skeptically.
"I'm not en engineer," Bruce said. "That's Tony, remember? But, I still remember what we did to find the Tesseract when the team first formed. It should be done tomorrow morning."
“I’m the reason he was taken, Captain Rogers,” Wade said, swallowing as he looked up at Steve. “It’s- It’s me, Wade Wilson, and I’ll explain later, but we only have until ten. Please, you need to call the Avengers and-”
"I always knew you were insane," Steve snapped, arms crossed as he grit his teeth. "Never should have trusted you. You're nothing but trouble!"
“Got family?”
He ended up in the back yard with an axe and a massive stack of wood. It was August, but the Barton family apparently needed it all chopped by November. So he swung, feeling so old as his arms ached. He had a small pile of chopped wood set up, but he thought that it was a pretty good amount.
"Bruce says its backlash from the Stones power," Steve explained as he rewrapped his arm. "The bones in my arm were broken in several places, too. He said that much power, even with the gauntlet to channel it, left a mark. The serum, somehow, saved me. If I were normal, like Clint or Natasha, I'd probably be dead."
“Well, Weasel… You might want to sit down.”
“Olives,” Peter said, nodding his head sagely.
Once all the rioting was put to an end, and the UN able to meet, the Accords were quickly abolished, stating his Pops, Uncle Buck, and everyone that fought on their side, were free to go. Clint was relieved of his house arrest, Natasha got to keep all her knives, and Bucky got to reunite with Darcy. Not to mention that, with the Stones safely in Doctor Strange’s custody, they were able to bring Vision back.
"Wade?" A voice said from behind him, making him freeze. "What are you…?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do I?” Steve asked with a slight cringe. “Well… I guess. He’s just… He’s just something else, you know?”
They rescheduled for the next weekend. Only, Pepper apparently hadn't known about the date and Tony ended up spending the weekend in Tokyo with Peter doing business things Steve didn't understand.
“Dude,” Weasel eventually said. “You’re starting to creep people out.”
He had meant to ask when they got back from their fun day, but the other Avengers had spent the day getting everything ready, and he'd been swept up in it.
Rhodey snorted. “Only you, Tony. Only you.”
“You fainted,” Doctor ‘I obey confidentiality’ replied, checking on Wade’s vitals. “But the important thing is why. But maybe that should wait-”
“Where to, sir?” Happy asked.
“Nick Fury,” he said, stepping out of the shadows.“Director of SHIELD. And I’m here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.”
“I don't get separation anxiety,” Tony gasped. “Honey Bear, I'm hurt you would even think that! I worry about Peter, so much, and he's just so small and I worry about having to protect him!”
STARK: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here.
Bucky only blinked. “There’s no pain…”
With a sigh, Pepper put a hand to her forehead. “Fine… Just, don’t take to long to get back to them… It looked really important.”
Holding out a hand, summoned a gauntlet to him, walking around the scepter until he could swipe the dark artifact off of its pedestal. He had work to do… He had to do more…
When the metal arm finally came off with a click, Barnes went limp, voice gone and body unmoving. Steve got off him, looking concerned and worried and about a hundred other things, and glanced at Tony. “You said it wasn't supposed to hurt him.”
“Peter,” Aunt Pepper said with a bright smile. “What a pleasant surprise! I haven't heard from you in a while. Happy said you were sick, but I never got the chance to check on you. Things have just been so busy.”
That caught Tony's attention. Strange had said there was only one timeline that they won. Now Wade was saying this was the only way? He set his jaw, stepping forward.
As soon as Tony saw his son, saw the moment his son grew teary eyed and stiff, he forced himself to stand. He walked down the ramp, Rhodey trying to help him, then broke into a jog, and finally a run. As soon as he was close enough, Tony dropped to his knees on the cement, reaching out and pulling Peter into his arms.
“Friday,” he said, looking up at the camera that had a blinking red light above the door. “Unlock the door.”
Tony took it as a ‘thank you’. “Of course it doesn't hurt. While the old arm was a marvel for its time and creators, there were a few serious flaws. Just that fact that it was missing some key components, particularly the dampeners, should have been driving you crazy with agony. With nothing to lull the nerves at the shoulder until it was taken as a part of you, the neural receptors in your brain would have been firing rapidly even after attachment to tell your brain that it was painful. On a normal person, that would mean the neuron that was reviving and sending that message would eventually be so used and worn, the message would become a background constant in your mind until something brought your attention directly to it. And-”
There was of course Kate, or rather, Sharron. He’d met her towards the end, and had learned a bit more about women from her. Women, now, could be as tough and badass as Peggy. Though that could have just been because Tony knew her. The woman Tony knew all seemed to be tough badasses. Steve had also met a few others, who he continued talking with online: Gale Monroe, Ava Stone, Magnolia Ross, Henry Scott, Maria LaRue. They were all good people, but the one man that had left the greatest impression on him was Oliver Quinn.
STARK: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea.
Though he still looked confused, Steve went off to the bathroom, and Tony turned helplessly to Pepper and Rhodey. They looked tired and like they very much wanted to throttle him.
XxXXxX
He remained silent, watching for any sign of the Mad Titan, or for the frontal assault team to give the signal. They remained at the top of the ridge for what seemed like hours, just watching, waiting. They knew that Thanos had to be here. This was the only place energy waves matching the stones was coming from. Had there been a mistake? Was it a trap?
“Yeah,” Steve said as he pushed himself off the wall into a standing position. “I'm going to head down to Bucky's floor. Sam said that he had a movie he wants us to watch.”
“Wade?”
“Okay,” she said, as Tony turned to look at what Stane was doing. “I’m going in now.”
Steve eventually came out, and Tony looked up to glance at him. Out of all the teammates who got mind magic’d by Maximoff, Steve looked the least shaken. Hell, if anything, he looked calmer then he had in years. Tony wondered if Steve hadn’t seen anything. If Steve hadn’t seen what Tony had…
"Look," the man said, glaring down the street. "I got out of there for a reason. They're crazy and I don't want to blow myself and destroy such a beautiful place. It's not worth it."
“”The genetic coding tower’s at ninety-seven percent,” Bruce warned. “You have to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.”
“Service animal,” Clint said, snickering.
Tony blinked. "Friday, you do know what that will do to you, right? You'll get merged with the circuitry. You might not be able to come back out."
The first week was mostly going to be team building things. Getting to know the others and making friends was an important part of what this camp was trying to do, aside from bring back people's love for science. The second week was going to mostly be them doing actual sciencey things. Like building tower structures, potato batteries, and other easy sort of introductory stuff that that they would do later in high school.
Steve was immensely grateful for Coulson's and Bruce's offers. Without that worry, it didn't take to long after that for them to have their groups sorted. Steve would lead a frontal assault team made of Thor and Natasha, since Thanos knew about them already. If Rhodes arrived in time, he'd join then, while the others split into two flanking teams.
“Mr. Wilson,” he said, a creepy smile on his face. “Have a seat. I understand you’ve recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.”
"He's had a traumatic experience," Natasha countered, and Steve silently thanked her. "After what happened, it's probably better that he stay here, take care of his kids."
Then he took Natasha, Clint, and Bucky- Tony liked to call the three of them the ‘assassin squad’ -and went to find Dr. Cho. They ended up finding her dead, and Ultron running off with her cradle machine. He ended up fighting with the Maximoff’s against Ultron, as in the twins were on his side, and he was just very, very, confused. Then they lost Natasha.
With the cup of coffee downed, Tony turned to look up at Steve again. He was a bit confused. He didn't remember exactly what had happened. The last thing he really remembered was going into fight Thanos. There was the vague memory of pushing Steve out of the way of an attack, but… not much after that.
XxXXxX
“Pepper,” Tony managed. “Help…”
“Access denied,” the AI said again. “Emergency Lockdown in progress. Proper key required.”
Crossing his arms, Bruce leaned back. "Lucky for you, Tony's already taken care of that. When I saw him earlier, he told me Friday recorded the energy output of the Stones. We can use that information to make a sort of Infinity Stone geiger counter. We can follow the output straight to the stones."
“He built a suit.”
Peter squinted at his teacher, lifting up his head. “And if my dad’s fighting Hydra, or Loki, or some crazy mutant that could destroy the world?”
“Steve,” he said, dark spots dancing at the edge of his vision. “There’s one last thing. I’ve been… I’ve been looking. For Peter’s mother. It took me a while, since there are so many cliffs like the one in that video out in that canyon, but I think I found her. Please. When you reverse the snap… ask Friday to tell you where, and pull her out. Peter… If he can’t be there for my funeral, then maybe being there for her’s will make up for it.”
Frozen, Steve watched as Coulson and Bruce were charging down the hill towards them. But it didn't take long before the rage was back. He turned before they could pull Tony off the spike, and picked up the blue stone at his feet. With it held tight in his fist, he let out a cry and charged at the man who might have just killed the love of his life.
“Still want to,” Wade grumbled as he went to his room, dropping onto the bed. “Miss him so much. Didn’t even have him for a year before we were torn apart. Author will barely let anyone be happy for more then two seconds before she just… rips them apart.”
Thankfully, Steve actually looked to startled to speak. Tony took a deep breath, and made a quick decision. He knew he shouldn’t make this decision without thinking it through but he needed to do it. It had to be done.
And with a blink, it was all gone. He was back in the secret room, the Chitauri Leviathan was still dead, and he could hear the light ideal chatter over the comms. But he had an idea now… An idea that he need to try.
“Daddy!” Peter wailed, and Tony reached up to grab him.
That was the last thing Wade heard before he passed out.
“Calling, Sir.”
“Yeah Daddy,” Peter giggled. “Look silly!”
“Like olives,” Peter insisted, though he followed when he walked towards a small time with spreads of crackers and cheese.
He was a little round, but he seemed like the over excited sort, though he looked a bit nervous. “Uh… Nitrogen, Europium, D?”
, and he may have been a playboy in the past, but he isn’t anymore. He never ‘coerced’ Steve into anything. And if you’re here just to spread false rumors, then you can get out!”
“My child,” Tony corrected, making Pepper turn to him in surprise. “I want you to call for a press conference now.”
Stant, thankfully, followed. As they reached where ice had begun to build up the first time, suit now at 7% power, Stane reached out, grabbing hold of Tony’s bot and pulling him down by the throat to look at him.
“I can’t tell you until he get there,” Peter snickered, excited and nervous. “It’s supposed to be a secret and my dad was still kinda hesitant to let you guys come over. Harry in particular.”
Yensin helped him, in so many ways. He translated, was his lab assistant, and helped him install the mini arc reactor. They ate together, came up with a plan to escape, and worked together to build the suit.
XxXXxX
“I wanted to ask you something before we head back,” Steve said, shifting for foot to foot. “Back at the mall, when we kissed… Did you…?”
And that had gone on for
After telling Rhodey and Natasha that the wedding was back on, Tony asked Wade if we’d like to come. They’d kept in contact after all the help Wade gave, what with the Hydra stuff, and Tony occasionally went down to Weasel’s bar to fix a thing or two, just to check in on the kid. Sure, Wade was eighteen now, but he was still a kid in Tony’s book.
“Friday,” he said slowly. “Please tell me you got that on camera.”
It took a second, but Steve eventually left, and Tony leaned back in his chair.
In high school, she'd played tennis, ran track, and had been very healthy up until the cancer. She had eyes so much like Peter's that when Tony had found a picture of her, he'd seen only Peter. Everyone said that Peter looked so much like him, but Mary Parker… God, Peter looked so much like her that Tony couldn't see himself in Peter.
“Yeah,” Tony said, catching Thor leaving out the corner of his eye. Steve followed after him, and Tony grit his teeth. “What can I do?”
Testing came after eating, and dear god. It was bad. So bad. He hit the ceiling. And Dummy doused him with the fire extinguisher. And Peter started crying. That was the worst part. Being mildly concussed and having Peter crying. Tony felt like he was getting his heart ripped out.
“I'm fine now,” Peter said, maybe a little to quickly. “But what do you mean your busy? I mean, you normally are, but what makes this week so bad?”
Tony was kind of… lonely with Peter gone. Sure, he had Steve, who was sharing his room, and Bruce and Jane who he talked science with, but they weren't Peter.
"It's a long story," Wade said, voice thick with a swarm of emotions he couldn't name. "I'll explain later."
Tony couldn’t help it, he broke out into laughter. “Wow, Coulson. You are the last person I’d expect something like that from.
Peter glanced at the others, finding Harry frowning at him. Peter couldn't tell if it was a ‘you look familiar’ frown or a ‘you look smarter then me and I don't like it’ frown.
In an instant, Peter was off, running back to his room. Tony went down to the lab, going over to the cars. He stepped on something as he went, looking down at it. It was Peter’s toys. One was a bag of marbles, and another was a box of what looked to be legos. The last one, however, was a plushie. A Captain America plushie.
“-but he has not eaten a full meal since Young Master Peter's departure this morning and has not slept since before his return to the Tower.”
“But he said he’d would be back last week,” Peter grumbled, definitely not pouting as he slouched in his seat, only half heartedly playing the game. “I haven’t seen him since his graduation party three weeks ago…”
He moved to backpedaled, only to feel something bang on the back of his head. Grabbing the back of his head, Steve blinked as he looked up to find Bucky standing before him.
“Okay,” Tony said, giving the cadets an apologetic shrug that made Peter giggle. “Sorry guys. He’s right. It was me. Ian and I still text, though.”
“Whoa,” Sam whistled. “This place is nice.”
“I don’t know if I should have told my friends,” Peter admitted. “They're… Well, Harry, Gwen, and Liz all seem really uncomfortable. I don’t know, maybe we should have done the usual family only party and then the public gala like we have every other year…”
He fell, slowly, thanks to emergency power, and thrusters jumping in and out. Eventually, he stumbled into a land on the roof, calling Pepper again.
“Well, I’m not my company.”
“What about Darcy?” Steve asked. “You and her have gotten pretty close. Yeah, I noticed. So what about her? You’re just gonna leave her?”
XxXXxX
Then, without further delay, Tony pulled on the suit and took off.
“You’re dad is Tony Stark,” Ned suddenly gasps. “You’re family is the the Avengers! You’re-!”
Barney looked unimpressed. “Well, my wife Laura and the kids are asleep upstairs, so if you guys don’t have anything to do, I’ve got some chores that we need done before winter.”
At the end of the night, Peter took a selfie with Wade, grinning as they stood side by side on the balcony, the evening New York skyline behind them.
XxXXxX
“Aside from the no names that no one cared about, that’s one every three weeks, just so you know,” Wade explained, shrugging. “Haven’t really doing much killing in the last year.”
"Our parents are gone," Mary Jane said, biting her lip. "We didn't know what to do, so we gathered everything we might need and step the last three days trying to get here. We… We thought Mr. Stark could help us."
Slowly, he went to Mrs. Warren, tugging on her sleeve like a child to get her attention. She took one look at him at went wide eyed.
“They’re not here,” Steve said, dropping Wade as he stepped out of the elevator. “There was a call to assemble an hour ago to be in eastern Asia. Coulson said that Tony and I are on probation until we got what happened this morning sorted out, so Tony’s in a meeting in DC to explain.”
The next day, Tony sat in a room with a newspaper, Pepper, and Peter, as Rhodey spoke to the press outside.
"You fucking
. Never before had Steve's urge to hit someone been so strong. Once again, Wilson had foiled their one chance at fixing everything.
“Tony,” she started, then sighed. “You know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you’re going to start all of this again.”
And just like that, Tony felt his brain kick into gear. Cancer. Wade had fucking
Slowly, Bucky nodded, though he didn’t lose his glare. Steve really couldn’t blame him. Everything had to be strange for him right now. And while Steve was going to help, he couldn’t let that control his life. He had learned a lot on his road trip.
"Tony," Steve said, lifting his arm to reach out, only to hiss as sharp pin pricks of pain flared up from his elbow to his fingertips. "Tony. Is he…?"
“Ned,” Friday’s voice said, no longer monotone, and sounding very concerned. “And Mary Jane. You have returned. Are Boss and Baby Boss with you?”
Peter nodded, rather sagely for a five year old. “It’s pretty.”
XxXXxX
“You’ll die!”
When he went home, he felt to good to really go on a job, even if it was the weekend. He stayed with Weasel and Bob in the bar, mixing crappy drinks and trying to get some sitting mercs to fight. But everyone could see his never ending grin.
“Tony?” his friend called. “Tony? Peter?”
“Okay,” Tony said, snagging the kid right out of the air before he could get another pair of knees to his ribs. “That’s enough of that. Daddy needs coffee. Jarvis, time.”
When he crashed, he climbed his way out of the suit, and began to walk. He walked for hours, hoping to find help, or shade, or for help to find him. And when Rhodey flew overhead with a helicopter, Tony fell to his knees, screaming with joy.
“I’m not a good guy, Tony. Seriously, I’m a really bad dude. In the span of three years as a mercenary, I killed at least one person every three weeks. And that's just the confirmed kills that I can take credit for without debate. I do things that Peter would volunteer to do, like protecting someone who doesn’t deserve to die or getting stalkers to back off, for money. You guys, the Avengers, are the family that Peter has, and you have no idea how hard it is feel… good enough for someone as perfect as your son.”
After a hassle with getting the car seat set up, Tony eventually got them on the road. Peter slept most the way, though only after asking what felt like a game of a million questions. Peter was… definitely a Stark. Only Stark men could ask that many questions without breathing.
“Mr. Stark?” a man in a fed suit asked. He sounded serious. “Agent Coulson.”
“Because I was referring to your companies involvement in this latest atrocity.”
Her brow creased, confused, eyes darting back to the screen for a second before back up at him. "I… can't. If I stop typing, we can't talk and I'll have to summarize in your next POV segment."
A wry came to Tony's lips, blood dribbling down the corner of his mouth. "Steve," he rasped, coughing again.
“Uh, I kinda dropped out?”
As if expecting his quick denile, Sam snorted and rolled his eyes, leaning back against a bookcase that was already filled with the tons of history and popular modern texts. “Cool it, Steve. I don’t mind, the whole man on man thing. If that’s your cup of tea, then it’s not my place to say no. Besides, I heard you ask him out before we left. You got it bad, man.”
“What’s that?” Peter asked, pointing to Butterfingers.
He was confused. Was Bruce talking to him? Had someone been stabbed? But why was Bruce telling him?
Steve swallowed. He felt sick, like he was going to throw up. Had he gone through time again? Had he missed another seventy years? Where was Tony? Where was Peter?
Peter sat in his little corner of his fathers lab, looking at the scans of the Winter Soldier’s metal arm and trying to get the kinks in the plans for Operation Stony worked out. He’d been working with Aunt Nat to try and make a plan to get Steve and his Dad together for the last few months. The official plan wouldn’t start until after they returned to the tower.
Suddenly, Francis was over him, grabbing him by the back of the shirt before tossing him aside. Peter did his best to roll into the landing, but as much as he had tried, his hands were still a little cut up. He landed with a thud, and only for the helicarrier to suddenly start to tilt. His spider powers let him stick to the floor, but he had to let go to jump out of the way before a rolling container could hit him.
“Excuse me,” he said, though he made sure to sound pretty chipper. “But I don’t think you’re weapons are very concealed.”
“On it, Boss.”
“You really should wear protective gear, Peter,” MJ said, snapping him out of his thoughts as she pulled her strawberry red hair into a ponytail. She kind of reminded him of Aunt Pepper when she was like that… “You could get really hurt with those stunts you and Harry do.”
The man, Clint’s brother, stepped out of a corner, wiping his hands on his pants. He turned to give Clint a loose hug, then turned to look at the team.
to much fuel in it and sorta made it… combust. He was used to explosions in his fathers lab, though, and had laughed it off while most of the other kids, and some of the adults, had freaked out about the fact that Peter had accidentally built a
“Wade,” he said, as Wade made a heart with his hands. “The knife-!”
"Tony," Steve said, hands shaking and the stone dropped on the ground at his feet. "Tony, hold on. You're going to be okay. Just, hold on!"
Wade breathed deeply for a moment, rubbing his face. “I need guns.”
The members of the original team that had been present thankfully survived. Bruce was helping hold Natasha up, even though the two still had so much left unsaid. Thor was there, with the racoon he had brought. Rhodes, thank god, had made it. If there was anyone that could find Tony and Peter, it would be him. Well, maybe Wade could find Peter, but he wasn’t exactly sane right now. Darcy also came, having come from the inner city to see what was happening.
Steve followed the movement with his eyes. Tony knew from the way that his breath caught, that Steve knew exactly what was in the bag.
"No," Clint said. "Steve, you have to get back in there!"
Peter grew tense, unsure of what to say, and decided that maybe he should just… run. So he climbed out the window, and crawled around to where Pepper couldn’t see him before going up to the roof. He could still hear her, calling out to him, but he ignored her and got redressed. Once he was sure that he was good, he headed back down, finding Pepper in the hall.
The boy giggled the entire time that Tony spent drying him off. He grinned at him, and Tony couldn’t help but smile back. Then, he sent him off the go get dressed, while Tony showered himself. He watched Peter scurry off, wrapped in a big, fuzzy towel three times his size, and then went to take a sip out of his coffee cup. Bad idea.
"He's grieving," Tony said, voice oddly soft. "After the weapon-x program, he's been different, sure, but he'll be back. He just… needs to work through his shit."
Ah, Peter thought as he and the three others joined the teacher at their designated area. Harry Osborn. Peter had met him a few times, when they were much younger. Norman Osborn, Harry's father, had asked Peter's father for some kind of help on several occasions, each time his dad saying no. His father always said no, and would make comments about how Norman Osborn was ‘a creep who cared more about money then his own family’. The meetings between them always ended with Aunt Pepper just barely keeping them from getting into fist fights. Harry, from the little time Peter had spent with him, wasn't a bad kid, but he never seemed to remember Peter.
“I could take us there,” Thor pipes up. “Stormbreaker can function as a bifrost. It will be a bit strange, transporting so many, but it should work.”
STARK: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.
The hooded man shook his head, once again glancing around to check if anyone was coming. The world was in chaos after the Calamity, the day half the world vanished, and at any time, someone desperate could appear and attack him.
Gah! This chapter had to be the hardest to write so far! Sorry it took so long!
“Funny how that works, huh?”
“So,” Tony said, the ring sitting in his hands. “I’ve decided… I don’t want to give this back.”
Peter swallowed, nodding and giving his father a hug before laying back to sleep.
“Still don’t trust me, Cap?” Tony said, eyes flying back and forth as his fingers fly. “Cuz I can’t stop it.”
Wade blinked, then grinned wide as he turned to look at the board. It was the perfect name for him. Super cool and badass. It was the perfect name! “
"Friday?" Mary Jane tried.
“Yeah,” Wade chuckled darkly. “I’m alive…”
“Oh god,” Tony gasped. “I… I do…”
The bullying started up again. Flash had been scared by Bucky, all those months ago, and then continued to be scared by Wade, but it was a new year, and Peter was coming to school alone. There was no big bad boyfriend to ‘protect’ him anymore, and Flash was more then eager to start the bullying again.
“It’s nothing, just a little snag.” He reached up, pulling out the original reactor. “There’s a loose wire under this device. And it’s contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short.” He snapped it out. He didn’t have much time before Peter came back.
There was the sound of a revving bike, and Steve opened his eyes to find that Deadpool’s prisoner had escaped. Damn, that guy had some pain tolerance… Steve definitely couldn’t ride a bike right after pulling a sword out of his own shoulder. The guy definitely wasn’t human. They should probably go after him.
“I know!” the teen snapped back. “I know he would love to know that I’m okay, but I doubt he’d be able to stomach looking at me. I’m hideous, Tony. I look like someone tried to make mashed potatoes, but only the outside got soft enough to smash. Even Weasel, who has seen some serious shit in his days, looked like he was going to throw up.
“Should have known.”
“Oh my god,” Pepper said, a hand over her mouth. “Tony!”
Steve spent the rest of the evening trying to keep from obsessing over the next day. He played video games with Clint and Thor, spared with Natasha, talked to Bruce, went and saw Bucky. It worked. Mostly.
Peter took a seat, leaning his head back for a moment as it began to throb heavily behind his eyelids. God, he hated feeling like this…
“Yeah,” Harry hummed. “Dr. Connors is head of that area. He’s doing some sort of thing with spiders and lizards. Not exactly sure what.”
What were your guys favorite parts? And what were your least favorite? Tell me in the comments, I want to KNOW!
“I heard that!”
Bruce came in next, but had to leave as soon as he saw Tony since he started going green. Thor got intercepted on the way down, and led the Hulk out so Tony didn’t accidentally die by green fist instead of, well, a chest full of carnations. Which left… Steve.
Tony gave up on talking with her, now having the factory in sight. He dived, as Stane opened fire on him. They crashed, through cement parking lot, then through the wall of the lab. They ended up on the street, cars blaring horns.
“I’m sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.”
“That’s enough of that. There’s a child-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony smiled, and turned to Steve. Steve looked back, smiled, and they went down the stairs together as Nat went to get some champagne.
“Clint?” a man's voice called from another room. “Are you still alive?”
When no one raised their hand, Peter tentivinly raised his hand, and started to list. “Palladium, Erbium, Thorium, Euphonium, Radium. Peter Parker, but my dad calls me Pete or Petey sometimes.”
"They're all safe," Steve said, voice shaking a little as the pain in his arm flared more. "If it worked, they're all safe in their beds."
Tony was tired.
It had been nearly 3 months since their original date night, and they still hadn't gone on that date. He was starting think they never would. With villains and meetings and the team gathering for ‘team bonding time’, they never had a moment alone with each other. It was maddening.
“Well,” Wade chuckled. “I… I didn’t think he’d want to see me like this.”
“Date?” Tony asked instead, his mouth moving on its own.
“He’s all yours,” he said, voice masked by a modifier.
Current movie order for the rest of the chapters is as follows: Iron Man 3, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron, Spiderman, Deadpool, and Civil War.
“You’re crazy,” Al replied. “But why not.”
“My son is a bit of a photographer,” Tony explained. “So he’ll be taking all the official wedding photos. Or most of them. But if you talk to him, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind some help. And since Peter is starting public school, I have to have it on a day where you wouldn’t miss class anyway, so you’ll be fine there.”
After the first test flight, and Tony’s mild concussion, they sat and talked about Peter getting one. Tony knew with every bone in his body that he couldn’t let Peter fly one yet. They made a deal that once it was totally finished, no kinks in it, they’d talk again.
“Performing scans now, sir. Should I call out Miss Potts?”
Tony frowned at that. "But…?"
“No, he won’t.
There were tons of reasons Wade could do better then him in terms of compatibility. Maybe he’d find a more mature girl. No, a woman. Really, Wade was an adult now, and Wade wouldn’t be dating ‘girls’, he’d be dating women and men. Not boys like Peter…
. Had none of them just… not noticed? “At long last…”
Quickly, Peter maneuvered out of the way, swinging himself and Pepper up to the window. He pushed Pepper deeper into the room, and twisted around to shoot a web down at Connors. The web shot down, latching onto the back of Connors coat, and Peter tried his best to pull him up. And then, for the first time, his webs began to fray, and snap, and Peter tried to shoot more, only for nothing to come out. He fell back, blinked, then rushed to look over the edge.
Finally, Thanos emerged from the little house. The purple giant walked, slowly, in simple farming clothes. Still, Tony could see the gauntlet on his hand, but it shone with the light of only one stone. He must have hidden the stones, to keep them safe. They'd have to find them later, but it would make this fight all the easier.
“Wow,” the guy says with a small grin. “You’re a talker too. You and Wade.”
“I am Iron Man,” the man said, rather disapprovingly. “You think you’re the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you’ve just become part of a bigger universe. You just don’t know it yet?”
They rode with Coulson on the Helicarrier, and Steve came to see Tony as soon as they were done with debrief in a private conference room. It was quiet, something Tony rarely wanted, but needed right now. Just a quiet, simple, talk. No yelling, no arguing. Just… talking.
“But then when I dropped him off back at the tower, I went back. I figured it wouldn't hurt to look, just see what there was, but then I saw this ring. Jeweler said it was one of a kind. Well, one of two. Designed by this guy who died recently and made only two of them. Sorta a twin set. Simple but beautiful, and I thought ‘Holy shit, I gotta have it’, and I asked if they were for sale, and he said one was. So I kinda threw logic out the window and bought it right then?”
Tony sighed, running a hand over his face. “Alright. I'll see you later then.”
Betrayal stung sharp in his gut, burning and twisting as he clenched his fists. The wolf had double crossed him. Maybe after he left, she had changed her notes, or had given him an old copy. It didn't matter what she did, though. She had tricked him.
"I know, Boss," Friday said. "But I'm just the offline copy of the original, remember? Let me do this for you."
Peter took it lying down, most of the time. Not bothering to put up much of a fight most days. Two weeks into school, and Peter eventually broke. Flash had shoved him against the lockers, spat something about no one to protect him, and Peter had just collapsed to the floor. Tears were streaming down his face as he buried his face in his hands.
“Oh yeah,” Tony said, thinking fast. “Pete and I are out, driving with the top down.”
“You came to my dad for tech,” he reminded Wade. “And, you know, he kind of stuck his neck out for you. Plus, I… Well, Spiderman…”
XxXXxX
"Just tell me what I want to know," the man said, voice tense. He had come a long way for this information, and he wasn't going to let it slip away now, just because this guy wanted to run from his past.
“You are to me,” Tony said, grinning as he walked towards the entrance. “Come on, Obie. Pete, can you grab me my other burger?”
Even though Steve had said they'd have a team meeting after Tony had rested, he called the team into the conference room as soon as Tony and the twins were asleep. He knew that he should let Tony join them, but… Steve had seen him after New York. Had seen Tony at his worst, and this… This was going to surpass all of that. Tony just wasn't in the right mind to be out on the field.
Tony was happy to say that by December, Peter was starting to act a little like himself again. His son was a little brighter, even smiling and going to the mall with his friends and helping him in the lab. He wasn’t getting as many calls from Peter’s school, saying he was with the psychologist again, and Peter started staying in the house more.
“Yeah, but they don’t really live lives where it’s easy to raise a kid,” Ned countered.
XxXXxX
“Sure thing, Boss.”
At some point during the exchange, the others had left, including Carol. Changing the subject, Tony explained how Carol had found him just in time. How she had gotten a signal from some old pager or something and found the ship he was on as he was on the brink of death. He owed Carol his life.
"Hook me up, Boss," Friday offered. "I can take control and take you home."
“Mr. Stark!” Deadpool cheered, jumping up and turning to look at them. “Oooh, and Captain Frowny-Face to!”
The suited man stopped, a loud gasp escaping him as he turned to Spiderman. For a minute, Peter thought he was going to run. Instead, he put his hands to his cheeks, gave inhaled sharply in shock, and started bouncing excitedly on his toes.
He didn't say anything, just kept running, past Mary Jane with the twins, the confused War Machine standing in the hallway. He burst up the steps, taking them two at a time, and breathing hard as he swerved to bolt down the hall with the master bedrooms.
“Time to hit the button!” Tony called down again, trying to move, but failing.
When Tony decided to start from scratch, he knew that it meant giving Jarvis up for good. But it had to be done. He needed to make this work this time, make it work for sure. There was no turning back. He had to do this.
“Right,” Steve breathed, shaking his head to clear it. “Let’s go.”
“Wait a second,” Weasel says as Wade shouts profanity as he paces his room at Al’s. “We can talk about what we’re gonna- Okay,” He says, taking a step back as Wade starts beating on a dummy. “Or you can hit stuff. Yeah yeah. Hey, hey. Relax, relax, okay? I think that’s a good start.”
He ended up in there for most of the day. Peter kind of hated it.
Steve felt his stomach churn, and gave Bucky a quick nod. “Yeah, Buck. Tony’s real good with tech. It’s not gonna hurt you anymore.”
So Tony agreed, and shooed Clint away to get back to the Widow Stings. They were almost done, but he couldn't focus. He needed to go set up his new date.
“Wow,” Peter said, frowning. “That sounds offle. Maybe I could go get you lunch? And we could eat?”
“What the hell is that noise?”
Friday ended up being canceled. Steve, as much as he had tried to make sure they had time to, failed to take into account that the Avengers were a legit team that could get called out any moment. Or that Hydra was still at large. And so was most of AIM. And then the run of the mill baddy.
“How long,” she asked. “Who?”
“So you are a man,” Yensin began slowly, “Who could have everything, but chose to have nothing.”
Once Wade was gone, Tony went back upstairs to Steve. His husband smiled, kissed him, and they sat down to finish the movie. Tony went back to his tablet, trying hard to not think of all the secrets he was already keeping again.
“None for Baby Boss either, Boss.”
Steve nodded. "We need a way to track him first."
“Pep,” he said, voice low and dark. “You know how much I hate reading the government stuff. Especially from senators.”
“Right.”
He planned on going after Connors. He kind of had to. If Connors went after Pepper again… Peter didn’t want to risk it. His aunt meant to much to him. He didn’t remember much of his early childhood, but he knew how his dad used to be. How he had been absent, detached from Peter entirely, until after Afghanistan. But Peter knew that Pepper had been there, always, especially during Afghanistan.
“About 14 years ago,” Bucky said, not looking up. “Mary Parker…”
XxXXxX
The two soldiers nodded, and laid Barned back on the couch. It was an awkward angle, but Tony could reach over the back of the couch and work on the nerve connectors. Jarvis had been running analysis for him since he'd scanned the thing, and (theoretically) there shouldn't be any pain if Tony took it off. There were a series of clicks, and a hiss as the mechanism started to release, before Barnes let out an ear splitting scream of agony.
And then, not like always, Jarvis went off line. Tony spent a few minutes working to get him back online, Pepper hiding in the safe room, until Jarvis was up again.
“You were droning on,” Wade defended, tossing the empty gun to one side. “I may look like swiss cheese, but at least numbnuts isn’t gonna heal from that. Besides, if being a hero means sparing the psychopath that put Peter in a death box, then maybe I don’t want to be one!” He paused, and took a deep breath. “But I’ll be on the lookout for the next four moments. Now, if you’ll grant it, I’m just a boy, about to stand in front of another boy, and tell him…
With planning done, they broke to get to bed early. They'd need their strength for the hard fight the next day.
And then, as Tony tucked Peter in on one side, and slid in on the other, Tony knew who’d been sleeping there. Who else but the little five year next to him? Tony winced, then looked down as Peter wriggled over to him. He sighed, and went to reach for his tablet, only to realise just how tired he was, and fall asleep.
Peter shrugged. “It was quite a while ago. Nothing to do about it now…”
“You’re right,” Tony told him, turning around only for Steve to pull him into a hot kiss. When they parted, Tony was actually a little winded, breathing a little heavily. He was just glad that they were the only ones up on the balcony, and sure the others could see them, but they weren’t creeps that would gauk at them. “What’s up with you today? Being all sexy. That’s not usually you’re thing.”
“It's how I was raised, why not him?”
“-I can’t believe that he would do that! Maybe he already knew you were missing? But then why didn’t he ask me for help? It’s totally uncool, and-”
He didn't wait to see what they did, instead flying out to go find the Jericho. And he did, only to get knocked from the sky. When he stood, he faced off with a tank. He dodged the first missile, and sent a little counter of his own, destroying the tank in one go. And, with men firing bullets at him, he rose, and destroyed the Jericho in one move.

on his
“I just need to know if he’s okay,” Tony said, eyes narrowed in a glare. “He’s dating my son, and he’ll want to know if Wade is alright.”
Here lies
“I’ll see you inside,” he said quickly, Peter reaching up to take his hand instead as they started to walk away from Obie.
“Talk,” Rhodey said. “You didn't say anything about a ring to me.”
As they sat in the lab, trying to figure out what to eat for dinner, the news playing in the background, Tony noticed the party. It was being held under his name…
“Yeah,” he said quickly. “It should be fine. It’s like Operation. You just don’t let it touch the socket wall or it goes beep.”
Tony blinked. He hadn't moved though. He didn't remember moving, at least. His limbs felt too heavy to move, like lead, and he should probably take a nap. But there was a nagging feeling in the back of his head. He'd been doing something. Something… important.
Tony's hand move to clutch the makeshift pouch around his neck. His chest hurt, and he was having trouble breathing as everything came flooding back, not for the first time. The way Peter tried so desperately to hold onto him, how he kept apologizing, even as he was suddenly gone from Tony's arms.
“Healing-factor,” Peter said, nodding without much care.
Bruce was the one that dropped him off, geared up with a backpack full of things he would need, a sleeping bag, and a camera.
“How about a suit? And an alias! Bitter Boy. Super Fist. Captain Never-Die.” Weasel blinks. “Oh right. I guess I should put you back on the board. Since, you know, you’re not dead? None of the guys you were betting on died, though.”
“Oh my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?”
“Do you recognize them?” Tony asked, moving towards the stairs. “And tell Pepper she can come out.”
“Guys,” Bruce called over comms. “Is this a Code Green?”
For now, he’d deal with moving the soldier.
He blinked, reached for the phone, then thought better of it. If everything was going to end, if his dad was that worried, he’d call. Like the last… three times? It was three now, right? Because there was the Mandarin, two years ago, then the Chitauri before that, and Whiplash before that. So three. If his dad was really in trouble, he’d call.
He continued to stare as Peter shot another web and was off once again. He felt great, knowing he had just helped someone. He had understood why his Dad and the other Avengers did what the do, but now he understood a bit more.
A teacher noticed them at that point, and they’d both been taken to the main office. Flash had to see Morita, but Peter had to go see the school psychologist.
“She’s fine. She’s with five agents. Their about to arrest Obadiah.”
?” Tony asked, eyes almost bugging out of his head. “What the hell happened to you?”
“Sounds like you're going to have a hard night.”
“How do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?”
“Considering the Avengers business,” Pepper mused, “I'm surprised you two didn't get married ages ago.”
Turning to look down the road, Steve blinked as two teens ran towards him. Well, one of them ran. The other was jogging and gasping like a fish out of water.
After a second, the man answered.
Wade was surprised when Peter called him to say his fathers were okay with them. He was suspicious. It was almost to good to be true. But they let him come over and have dinner with them.
“Then maybe I should kiss you, to make it even.”
Just as he reached for the scepter, the room seemed to rumble, a loud, monstrous roar coming from behind him. Tony whipped around, eyes wide with horror as the Chitauri Leviathan came to life. He stumbled backwards, chest growing tight as fear gripped him. It flew over his head, away from him, and he turned to watch it leave in shock.
Tony stared, unsure that what just happened even happened. He turned to sit back in his chair, hand reaching for his phone to tell Peter, but then stopped. No… He couldn't tell Peter. Not yet. It was… it was a mistake. This date. It had to be… a ‘thank you friend’ date or something. He'd get another date before he said anything. Didn't want to get Peter's hopes up for nothing.
Taking another deep breath to calm himself, Steve took the hand. He was going to take a long, long shower, and maybe got for a run. Or maybe he could just go to the gym and let his anger out on a bag. That sounded nice…
Noticing his pops getting up, Peter quickly tiptoed his way back to his room. It was summer, sure, and he didn’t really have a bedtime or a special time he needed to be up, but he did want to sleep tonight. Also, being caught eavesdropping by Pops was the last thing Peter wanted.
Stane got up first, picking up a car, before getting read to throw it at him. Collateral damage, Stane had called them. Tony gave shot at Stane through the chest piece, and caught the car, though power went down to 19%. Probably shouldn’t do that again!
“Tears of joy,” she said, glancing at Peter. “I hate babysitting.”
“Steve,” he rasped, throat tight. “Steve, if you’re listening to this, you have to know just how much I’ve missed you. These last few months, it hasn’t been the same. Our family, it hasn’t been right. I wish we could have done more, to stop the fighting before it began. I should have listened to you, about Barnes. I knew he didn’t blow up the meeting, and I knew what would happen if he was brought in. But I was just thinking of the kids. If I didn’t get in with the Accords, get the ones in charge to trust me, I wouldn’t be able to fix it before it got out of hand…”
They spent hours talking, until they got to the very last one. Once everything was finished, they put the ring back on Tony’s finger, and went to tell their respective main friends that everything was just fine.
“What happened to building the IKEA thing?” Wade countered. “Give up? I thought you were better then letting life’s imperfections get the better of you.”
“We're going to introduce ourselves in a very special way, if you three can handle that,” she said, smiling. “Does everyone know the periodic table?”
The two then went to the edge of the helicarrier, and Peter turned his attention to the ristrainsts. They had only strapped down his wrists and upper torso. It was more then amatur kidnappers did, but less then some others had tried. If he had his backpack, he could activate the legs to get out, but he didn’t. Giving the restraints an experimental tug, Peter realized that they were a lot stronger then most.
“I have to much on my plate already,” Tony groaned, moving from brooding to childish. “There’s dealing with SI inventions, Avengers upgrades, along with Branes leaving with Lewis and having to deal with a pouty Peter. No to mention dealing with Spiderman and Deadpool.”
Carefully, Steve reached down, popping the strap of the sling open, to slide it off his arm. It was covered in bandages, from fingertips to half way up his bicep. Tony watched as Steve started to unravel the bandage, going slow and careful, until his whole arm was visible. There was a bit of discoloration on the skin, with sharp white scars zigzagging all across the surface. What was more shocking was how Steve's arm shook violently, even just lifting it.
lost to a broken heart.
Taking a deep breath, Steve made a mental note to find a therapist for Thor. Whatever had happened to him must have done something to him. It would probably be wise to do the same for Bruce… He was already seeming a little off.
But what sucked more? Oh, just fighting Hulked out Bruce in the Hulkbuster armor. That sucked most. Because it hurt like a bitch, and Bruce is his friend, god damn it!
He set it up in fabrication, deciding on a lightweight material, thinner then Steve’s suit. It was more flexible, to, and while it didn’t have any extra pouches, he didn’t feel like he needed any aside from one for his phone and one for his wallet. Just incase.
“Friday,” Peter called, as the doors slid shut and they started upward. “News for the day, please?”
Anthony Edward Stark,
And then Steve’s shoulder’s tensed, and Tony realized that Steve was keeping his own vision a secret. Why wouldn’t Steve tell him? Steve was all about honesty! “Is that a problem?”
The nannies were set on a four person rotation, covering twelve hour shifts. Peter seemed to learn just as quick as he had, and Tony got biweekly reports on Peter's progress. There were times that Tony did see Peter, briefly, when one nanny was relieving another. Peter didn't seem to like the nannies as much as he liked Tony. Though, Tony had never even picked him up, even though Peter was nearly one.
Ned took one look at Peter, then nodded quickly, hurrying off to complete his task. Mrs. Warren led him to the principal’s office, knocking on the door before opening it. She led Peter inside and the Principal scowled.
“We need to get back to a base location to regroup,” Steve mused with a hand on his chin. “Where we can gather everyone that’s left. Friends, family… Anyone and everyone who might be able to help us, or who might need our help.”
“Is it safe?”
Tony swallowed, clearing his throat to keep his composure. God, Steve was going to be the death of him. “Can I fix it? I can make it leaps and bounds better then it is, make this thing look like two sticks put together. Hell, I'm probably gonna scrap this one and make him a brand new one! I should go to that.”
“Tony!” She cried. “Oh, my God, are you okay?”
Steve crossed his arms. “That’s bull, Tony, and you know it.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve breathed, wide eyed and confused as he looked around. All around him were strange tall buildings, taller then even the Tower, and all covered in bright lights. “I don’t… I don’t know how I got here.”
“Uh...who are you talking to?”
“How’d you solve the icing problem?” Tony asked, smirking behind his own, ice free, faceplate.
Steve smiled, almost sheepishly, but fond. "But I don't think I'll be picking up the shield again anytime soon. I've been fighting almost none stop since the 1940's, and it's about time I took a rest."
STARK: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…
“Tell you what,” Tony said, holding out a hand. “You got it. You’re absolutely right. Why don’t you go clear it up with my assistant, over there, while I get my kid some real food to eat with those olives?”
With that, Tony turned, walking pulling Peter with him to go find Obie- No, Obadiah. The man had been strange since he returned, and if Tony was right… He could never be Obie again. He was outside, still, with reporters pushing camera’s in his face.
Steve pursed his lips, nodding. He looked more worried then angry. “Tony, have been working on that arm for nearly 30 hours?”
“Where is he?” Wade asked, both girls snapping up to look at him. The new girl reeled back, face screwed up in surprise and disgust, and Gwen went wide eyed. “Where’s Peter?”
“Been awhile since I was in front of you,” he said, holding up to cards. “I figure I’ll stick to the cards this time.” They laughed, Tony cleared his throat. “There’s been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop-”
Sucking in breath, Tony choked back a sob. “You’re going be so amazing, both of you, no matter what you do. And you need to know that, no matter what you do, I’ll be proud of you. I wish I could be there to see you both grow up, but I can’t. I won’t be able to make it. But if Steve, if your dad, succeeds, you’ll at least get your big brother back. Peter- Pete will make sure you know just how special you both really are.
With all to much ease, Wade had appeared in the mansion basement, standing in front of Thanos' cell. Without a word, Wade had beamed under his mask, reached out, and pressed the release button for the cell door. Then, he'd waited for the titan to step out, and had just… handed over the Reality Stone. And with that, Thanos was gone once more, just seconds before they had arrived.
“Hold him!” Tony shouted, just barely holding on to the metal arm that seemed to spasm. “Something's wrong! This shouldn't hurt him!”
“Already done Baby Boss.”
“I… My son… He's five and I never… I've barely even spoken to him! I've never even picked him up!”
“But it is you’re parents we’re talking about,” Gwen hummed. “But MJ, did you think about how Peter would feel? Maybe he doesn’t want a baby sibling.”
“Steve, you’re not listening to me,” Tony said as he pulled out the ring. “I’m trying to tell you-”
“How long ago?” Steve asked. “Do you remember her name?”
needed his help! Was it because of what had happened that morning? Had Spiderman seen the news and decided he shouldn’t help Wade?
"Steve," Tony rasped again, eyes squinted shut in pain. "It's okay…"
“Oh my god,” Pepper breathed, tentatively moving to pear over the side with him. “He’s… gone…”
“See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Peter and me. Showing him the island.”
"I'll stay back, to," Bruce said, eyeing Steve. "With the Hulk… not around right now, it's better if I stay here with Tony."
“‘Earth's Mightiest Heroes’,” Steve scoffed. “Maximoff pulled us apart like cotton candy.”
He was god damned pissed.
With a sigh, Tony leaned his head back against the console by where his helmet was connected to the ship. His stomach growled, and he licked his dry lips to try and wet them. If there was any more food left on the ship, the Guardians had hidden it well. All Tony found in his extra search was an old walkman.
Steve chewed his lip, but took a seat in the bedside chair. "Well, after you took that hit, Coulson and Bruce arrived. They worked to do first aid on you, while I went back to the fight. With the Space Stone, I was able to avoid a lot of Thanos' attacks, get an upper hand as I improvised. Wade jumped in about that time, and it didn't take too long for the both of us, Carol, and the others to over power him. Even with the five other stones, Thanos couldn't predicted Wade's erratic fighting style. So when we got close enough…"
“Call for a press conference? What on earth for?”
Suddenly, a cassette tape slid across the long table, making most in the room jump. Steve held his children to his chest, eyes wide as he stood and turned to the door to the far right. Coulson had drawn his gun, Clint pulling his bow into the ready position. A blond woman in a red, blue, and gold suit was standing in the doorway, scowling at them.
Coulson did in fact go to Pepper, who was off on the dance floor. Tony got Peter some different crackers, some cheese, and picked him up as he ate. Peter was getting tired, Tony could see. Not that he could blame him. Events like this took a lot out of Tony, too.
"Just… look."
When Peter finally managed to get Pepper to let go of him, he hurried back to the Tower to work on the webs problem. Turns out, he only had so much in his body. And that wasn’t very much. So, if he used the organic webs as a base, and mixed it with some other chemicals, he could theoretically make stronger, finer, and longer lasting webs then what he now produced naturally.
“He wouldn’t take me back, not with this face. And you would agree if you saw.”
“Not really, but I can guess. So where are you going for your date?”
“Yes… You’ve spent the last year doing smaller jobs, and the occasional work with the Avengers.”
Aaanyway, read on and enjoy!
Steve put his hands in his pockets, scuffing a shoe on the floor. Barnes seemed to squint, tilting his head ever so slightly. What? What was Barnes privy to that Tony wasn't?!
19 Pages and 8113 words. Not to bad for a sorta half chapter.
“Oh god, that is so gnarly.”
Wade was the first to reach the Quinjet, and the first to get off when they finally landed back at the mansion. He didn't care that the others were trying to heal Tony and Steve, or that they shouted at him when he bolted out the hatch before it was fully open. There was only one thing on his mind as he ran.
“Yes,” he said simply. “And I will join them once we leave here.”
Tony’s first thought was ‘nice eye patch’. His second was ‘must have really pissed off SHIELD’. His last one, however, was ‘Why do I think of Captain America when he says Avenger?’
“Peter,” his best friend groaned. “Wade’s probably just busy. I mean, it’s not like he’s avoiding you or planning on breaking up with you.”
“Iron Man!” Peter said, holding up his arms to be picked up.
? God, it was going to be nerve racking.
They also played cards, but Steve had a pretty bad poker face.
“Uh,” Tony said dumbly, watching as Thor carried boxes for the two women he'd brought, and as Clint walked a golden retriever into the elevator. “You're in my Tower.”
Furious at Ultron, at Natasha, at the world. At himself.
The wind blew through the bare streets in a city in Russia. A hooded figure stands hidden in shadow, speaking in hushed tones to a young man that leaned on the wall around the corner.
They reached the skatepark, and headed inside the gate. It was built for all kinds of skaters, so there was an area meant for the more novice people, where Gwen, Ned, and MJ spent most of their time, just relaxing and having fun while Peter and Harry tried the harder stuff. But first, they got a picnic table to put all their extra stuff, and went to the incorporated food stand. Peter got his usual nachos, and sat down at the bench to eat some while the others were getting their pads and helmets on.
“Okay, Rhodey.” Glancing around, Tony picked up Peter, who shied away from Obie. “Pete, can you help me open up my shirt? I’ll show you my new heart, okay?”
“Boss,” Friday said, catching both men's attention. “There is someone here to see you.”
“I came to drop off my bag first,” Peter said, frowning as his fathers were still tense. “Is… Is everything okay?”
“Oh thank god,” Peter breathed, looking the guy right in the eye. “You have something in your teeth. It’s really distracting.”
“Oh, I’m Deadpool,” the guy, Deadpool, said with a grin. “But a lot of people call me the Merc with the Mouth.”
“Come on,” Steve said, carefully levering Bucky to his feet. “We'll get you some water, and we'll talk.”
. Right before Tony had proposed.
“That’s New York,” the boy said, laughing a little, but Steve felt his stomach drop. “You’ll get lost if you don’t know your way around.”
Steve was about to tell him no, that it was to risky. But then he saw the female Maximoff behind Thor. She lifted her hands, and Steve could see the spark of red mist at her fingertips.
Getting into her house, a little place out in the country, was also far to easy. The house was remote, so no one was around to see him going to the door. It was unlocked, and Wade couldn't help but chuckle. Clearly the wolf wasn't hiding. She was expecting him, and left her den open for him. This was going to be too easy.
At first, Barnes tenesed, and Tony realized that maybe he should have waited for Steve. Maybe Barnes wasn't as safe as they thought… but then Barnes did as he was told, and Tony excitedly moved forward. Time to test this puppy out!
But then Tony caught sight of him. That ridiculous blue suit, and the blond hair, all the same as it ever was. As strong and gorgeous as the day Tony met him. Everything seemed to melt away, as Tony thought about everything he and Steve had been through. He could practically hear his own teasing words from the first time he met Steve, or see the smile on Steve's face the day they brought Johnny and Susan home. He could see Peter, grinning like a fool, when he found out he and Steve were together. All the good things from their past was flooding over him now, and he choked a little at the wave of pure emotions that washed through him.
“Natasha is a super spy that likes to tell you things that you don't need to hear.”
“Engagement ring,” Tony said, squeezing his eyes shut. “It's an engagement ring.”
“Great,” Peter said as the doors opened again. He stepped out, his friends following as he took off his glasses and set them on the counter. “Tell Dad that we’ve arrived safe and sound.”
“But I told you,” he continued. “I told you, he couldn’t be trusted! He’s insane. He talks to himself. He
Peter instantly nodded, but as he glanced at the other three, they all looked somewhat uncertain. Even Harry looked a little confused.
Their tour guide, who clearly hadn't been expecting this, nodded. “Yes. Mr. Stark, I wasn't told you'd be meeting the group.”
Peter glanced at Obie, then unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt. There, in the center of his sternum, sat the mini arc reactor. Peter stared, Obie forgotten, and reached out to touch it. Obie seemed to dislike this, and quickly reached out to button Tony’s shirt back up.
“I always have to tell Bucky and Sam when Peter’s in the room,” Steve explained, casting a glance over his shoulder at said teammates. “Especially when they’re playing Mario Kart.”
“He said there was an old boyfriend waiting for you out back,” Gwen said, pursing her lips as his eyes went wide. “He didn’t say any specific names, but… I think you should check it out.”
Steve nodded. "How long would it take for you to make this geiger counter?"
“Who the hell are you?” Tony demanded, holding his son closer to him.
“We’re sorry for barging in,” Steve cut in. “We just need a few days to figure out what to do next.”
"Uh," Peter said, as eloquent as ever. "What happened? One minute I was on Titan, talking to my dad, and the next I was here in my bed."
Five years after becoming Iron Man, Tony is finally called in for the Avengers initiative.
“The civilians are not reacting well to the Iron Legion, Sir.”
They both knew that it was probably more then just a temporary babysitting, and he took off, heading for Stark Industries factories. He couldn’t stand waiting, and he eventually asked Jarvis.
As he went back to the sitting room, looking for more pizza and wondering about Pepper, the phone rang. He was tired, after such a long day, and walked slow, picking up a few pillows before he found it. Pepper calling… He answered, sitting down.
By the time Peter was two, walking and talking, Friday had become an essential part of Peter and Tony's lives. Tony was still drinking, and working in 72 hour shifts, so Friday kept Peter occupied with books and cartoons on holoscreans. The nannies were cut to two, only coming to clean, feed, and put Peter to bed.
He jumped, startled. “
“Peter’s been helping, so we already have everything,” Clint said, waving Tony off. “Nat's hiding it on her floor. But we need Steve distracted on the Fourth, at least until dusk, so we can set up everything.”
"Are you two alright?" Steve asked, as Natasha came back to eye the teens with him.
When they finally reached the base, Tony showed Peter around for a bit. He loved looking at the different planes, and somehow ended up sitting on Tony’s shoulders as he walked around, the Cap plush sitting on his head. When they found Rhodey, he was lecturing about pilotless planes.
They split up into little groups, doing their own things. Steve went with Sam and Bucky to the pool table, doing their secretive soldier boy talking, while Bruce wandered off to try and subtly find Natasha. Said red head was sitting with Clint and Coulson, her chair closest to the pool table where she kept whispering in Russian to Barnes. Tony hung out with Thor and Agent Hill for a while, listening to Rhodey tell a War Machine story. In terms of hero stories, it wasn’t all that interesting or funny, and they had a bit of a laugh about Thor’s not so clean save.
“Hydra,” Tony said. “Because this thing doesn't have any kind of dampener, and I'm guessing that may be partially why he got so aggressive.”
Peter decided to go to the obstical course in the training room to test it all out. There was a target in there, as well as some heavy weights he could play with to test everything out. He started with the weights, going to pick up the one he knew was a size to big. In the past, when he’d come down with Steve, he could just barely dead lift his own weight, and he didn’t really work out much, but he’d try one that was 20 lbs more.
Thanos hadn’t said anything so far, just laughed. He did, however, speak this time. “You’ll never find them,” Thanos said. “Not without that Stone.”
“There’s no pain,” Bucky said, rather slowly, like he wasn’t sure what else to say.
“How long was I out?”
When Steve saw Thanos, five stones in hand and reaching for the sixth, he panicked. He charged forward, rather blindly, punched the Titan in the face, and started to grapple desperately with him, trying to take the stone's from him. Adrenaline pumped through him, keeping him on his toes.
To say Peter was excited would be an understatement. It would the first time he was learning with kids his own again, and it was the first time he'd be away from home without his dad for more then a day. The summer camp was still in the city, but they were sleeping in tents at the Midtown High gymnasium instead of in nature for three weeks
He knew that this person was a sort of brownish-blonde, and studied computers and mythology, but not much else. He didn't really know anything about them. About her. About his mother.
It took him a few minutes to connect the entire thing and connect it to the shoulder. A series of clicks, a soft hum that soof faded away into nothing, and then they were set. The arm was attached and nothing had gone wrong. Tony sat back to admire his work, watching as Barnes slowly streached the fingers, rotated the wrist, and and bent the elbow.
Rhodey and Pepper would both get a third of the leftover fortune, while Rhodey would get all of Tony’s suits and get to share Jarvis with the Avengers. Pepper would also get all of Tony’s art collection, though it was pretty much hers anyways. The remaining third would be split between the many, many charity organizations Tony had been involved in. He just had to get everything else ready before his time was up.
Jumping up to his feet, Wade grinned down at the vans moving bellow. Show time~!
“Mother-
When they arrived, Tony was so on edge that he was starting to squirm. He never squirmed, but that could be because of the seventeen cups of coffee that he had before they arrived. They took one look at him, shared a look, then sat down on the couch.
“No. What you need is to get your mind right. I’m serious.”
Chest tight, Steve turned and ran down the streets. He stopped a few times to help up someone that was collapsed in the streets and redirect them to the Tower. He also knocked out a few people that tried to attack him, taking notes on where he left them. They weren’t his focus right now, but he’d come back to that issue later. For now, he’d just get to the mansion.
Wade stayed out of the way most of the night, not to interested in getting caught up in what the reporters were saying. But, eventually, someone seemed to get to close. Wade saw them before Peter did, and was on his way to intercept when the reporter asked the wrong thing.
He should say something, about how good a kisser Steve was. Maybe a joke?
Thinking fast, he managed to set off the flares, blinding Stane and ducking out of view. Think, he thought, though an idea came quickly.
Tony snorted, and he stepped out from where Steve was guarding him, and moved to observe the new machine. He ignored Steve, focusing on what this thing, the Vision, could do. He was absolutely amazed, and he found the way it moved and spoke absolutely fascinating.
"And chipper I am," the young man chuckled. "Because now I know what I need to find you, Wolfy~ Just need to make a quick trip home.”
Two jets came up behind him, and Tony did his best not to groan. Great. Just, fucking great. Turning, he gave a quick “That’s my exit,” and hung up.
“It would be best analyzed in the Lab. Take it there and I with run a scan of it. Should I contact the Boss?”
“I had my eyes opened,” Tony said, moving Peter off his lap so he could stand. He moved behind the podium, Peter following to cling to his leg. “I came to realise that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. I came to realise that that isn’t the legacy I want to leave behind for my son. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries-” Everyone one jumped to their feet, shouting for his attention, and making Peter cling painfully tight to his leg. “-until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be, what direction it should take, one that I’m comfortable with is consistent with the highest good with this country, as well.”
“Trophy,” Peter giggled, grinning widely. “Best heart in whole wide world!”
“And now Edward,” Mrs. Warren said, nodding to the last boy.
"Washington."
“From, the little blond hacker from California State University you met a year ago.’”
Tony was mostly helping him with gear. His katana specially made, the suit that was like a World War Two Captain America uniform with a red and black Spiderman color scheme. Seriously, Wade loved it. But he was worried about the tension that helping him would cause back home. After all, Tony hadn’t told Steve about who Deadpool is, and definitely didn’t tell Peter. Though, to be honest, when this was all over, Wade wanted no one to know he was Deadpool. He was probably already going to be on Steve’s shitlist again, and Peter would probably hate him a million times more if he ever found out. He didn’t need it getting any worse.
“Yes,” Thor sighed, sounding almost like a kicked puppy. “I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer. There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.”
Hey everyone! I'm so happy and sad to see this fic come to an end. It's been an amazing journey, over two years, of working on this. And I loved every minute of it! I loved every comment, good and bad, about my work and progress, and I'm really happy with how this turned out. Well, maybe not the ending. I always seem to drop the ball on endings.
“Now hold on,” his dad interrupted. “Me and Steve aren't, you know, together, so calm down. It was to keep from being discovered.”
“It can’t be
grieving, Steve," Tony sighed. "We all lost people in the snap. Friends, family. But Wade lost…" He trailed off, took a deep breath before continuing. "Wade lost Peter. The one person that he would do
Just as they were about to get the gauntlet, someone else swung in. Someone in a red and black suit, with katanas on his back and guns at his hips. Before anyone could stop him, Deadpool had snatched the red stone out of its holder in Thanos' gauntlet.
It was then that he caught sight of a flash of red from the corner of his eyes. He turned and went wide eyed when he didn’t see Maximoff, but instead saw Peter. He was in a red hood, walking away from Steve and around a corner. Quickly, he turned and ran towards Peter, shocked to find him there. Wasn’t he in New York? Wasn’t he safe at home?
"Tony, don't move," Bruce said, voice muffled, even though Tony could see the blurred outline of his face.
XxXXxX
A boy, held by his clearly terrified mother, pulled from her grip and ran to his father. They embraced, holding each other tightly. The boy looked at him, as he passed, going to grab the leader of the group. Tony pulled him through a wall, tossing him down in front of the crowd.
Obadiah said nothing for a moment, simply looking away. Then, he turned, looking out at the sea of reporters.
When they finally left, Peter started to feel a little homesick for the first time since reaching camp…
“8:17 in the evening, Sir,” Jarvis supplied from above their heads. Barnes jumped. “You started at approximately 3 in the afternoon yesterday. Young Master Peter visited you in your shop twice whilst you were working. Once before leaving for his private lessons and again a few hours ago when he returned.”
XxXXxX
“True, but I think Peter would make an awesome big brother,” MJ said, ignoring him as she grinned. “He’s such a big softy and remember when those little kids got hurt last week? Peter was so good with them, and they just seemed to like him instantly.”
And Tony decided to fuck it. Fuck telling Steve, because this was bullshit. “You seemed to walk away just fine.”
Stepping past Dummy and Butterfingers, Steve dropped down into the pile to pull the two children into his arms. They make little noises, Johnny squirming and Susan grabbing at his shoulder like she did when Steve picked her up. Steve laughed, squeezing them tighter to his chest, and just glad that they're okay. That his children are okay.
“Tony,” Steve sighed, sounding exasperated. “Do you not know how to take care of yourself? When was the last time you ate? When was the last time you
Peter nodded eagerly, holding the plush so hard that Tony could have sworn the head would pop off. It didn’t, thank god, but it looked like it would.
Steve wanted to thank her, but there wasn’t a word in existence that could convey his gratitude. What Wilson had said, about Jonathan and Susan… It had him worried. He needed to get to the mansion, see if Pepper and Happy had made it back with his kids. If his children had…
“Bucky?” Steve asked, once he finally noticed.
“Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division.”
"The Avengers will know what to do. Bruce can build something to track the energy signals of the Stones. Find the stone's and you'll find Thanos. Track him, ambush him if you have to, and take him down. Use the gauntlet to take him down, and bring everyone back. Strange, these guys called the Guardians… Peter… If you can get the gauntlet, you can save them all."
“What happened?” he asked, moving to rub at the banagages around his torso. They were starting to itch… “Why am I here? You know how much I hate hospitals.”
“And I thought that it had failed, but it didn’t, but it kind of did because it ate Jarvis.”
Tony was pissed.
The hanger was in complete disarray. Someone must have been trying to move one of the Wakanan planes when they disappeared, because there had been some kind of crash. The Quinjet lay in the rubble, useless.
“Access denied. Emergency Lockdown in progress. Proper key required.”
Peter watched as Bucky got up, heading for the elevator. So… His uncle had something on his mind… Wanted to get out and explore the world… Peter honestly couldn’t fault him for that, but he was really, really going to miss him. He was probably Peter’s favorite uncle. Who was he kidding, he was Peter’s favorite uncle. Sure, Clint used to take him to do dangerous things, and Phil had been around for, like, ever, and Thor and Bruce left, so Peter guessed he had a little bit of a grudge, but Bucky was totally his favorite. Sorry, Sam!
for. Wouldn't you do the same if you had lost-"
Coulson sighed. “They’re… new recruits. When the event happened, we lost a lot of good men. These four were at our wedding, and displayed quite a bit of skill in… an odd way, to say the least."
Sam and Clint cheered, and Bucky stood up to clap Steve on the back. His best friend, however, looked worried, and Steve knew exactly why. He slowly shook his head, just subtly enough that the others didn’t see. Steve hadn’t told Tony about Bucky and Peter’s mother. It was the one thing Steve couldn’t bring himself to tell Tony.
"On the stones?" Tony asked, doing his best to stay casual. "Where?"
Steve smiled at him, leaning in. At first, Tony thought that his husband, who had betrayed and beaten him all those months ago, was going to kiss him. Tony wasn't sure he was ready to fully forgive Steve yet, but he still loved him, missed him. He wanted them to be able to fix what had gone wrong between them. But at the last minute, Steve seemed to rethink his actions, and pressed a kiss to Tony's temple instead of his lips. It wasn't what Tony wanted, but it would be enough for now.
“You’ll meet them later,” Peter supplies. “During the party. But I could probably show you around the tower, if you want. I can't take you to anywhere anything classified is, like any of the Labs, but I could show you the common level and the training room. If anybody is training, you could see them in action.”
“And he’s-”
“It looked like they tried to propose to each other at the same time,” Clint snorted.
He had started coughing up to many flowers, no longer able to slow the flowers down by not thinking about Steve. Every few hours, he would descend into a coughing fit as petals and entire flowers spilled from his lips. They made piles under his feet that Dum-E would sweep up, and Tony would have to take a nap to regain some energy. He grew paler and paler, and he knew that the final stage of the sickness would be coming quick. He had to tell Pepper, Rhodey, the team… Soon, he wouldn’t be able to walk, and then not be able to talk, before he slipped into a coma for the remained of his time with the disease.
“No,” Tony said quickly, trying frantically to remember
“I need your help,” Wade pleaded, looking up at the man as he was literally on his knees. “Francis- The man that got away this morning… He has Peter and-”
"Already?" Wade snarled. "You're typing this out right now, aren't you? You knew I was coming. You knew the moment I walked through the door. That's why you left it open."
“Yeah,” Ned said quickly. “Ned Leeds. Only my mom calls me Edward, and only when she's really mad.”
“The whole world?” Tony asked, turning to lift Peter as high as he could, holding him under his armpits. “But the best one is in Daddy’s chest!”
Tony was suspended in air. From the ground was a massive spike, speared through the armor and Tony's side. The faceplate flicked up, revealing the tight features of Tony's face, and Steve scrambled toward him. His heart was pounding in his chest as Tony gave a wet cough.
“I put up with the Avengers ‘cuz they’re like family,” Wade said, standing up with a scowl. “The hero thing just isn’t my game. But if I ever reach ‘fuck it’, I’ll give you a call.”
“I don’t understand why-”
“That’s being handled. He’s on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.”
“Nothing,” Tony said, breathing hard as he glanced at the timer. “I’m just going into cardiac arrest just about a minute before my son comes running in here, ‘cause you yanked it out like a trout-”
“I have no record of an invitation, Sir.”
Steve hummed, smiling slightly against the nape of Tony’s neck. “Oh, that’s definitely me.”
“I can’t see any scenario where Peter wouldn’t take you ba-” Wade stepped out of the shadows, pulling his hood down only for Weasel to make a gagging sound. “Oh shit. You are… haunting. You look like an avocado had a baby with an older, wrinklier avocado… We might have to move our relationship to text and phone only.”
When Tony finally added the last bit of data to Peter's now massive file on his mother, he'd had one of Mary about the time that Tony had met her that he had framed for Peter's room. There were just so few pictures of her then, for some strange reason, but the picture that Tony had found was enough.
Clint shook his head. He seemed… angry. Which was entirely understandable. There had to have been people at that wedding that died in the snap. To have such a beautiful and hopeful day ruined by that?
Tony felt his neck heat, but he was trained since birth on how to control his expressions. He laughed, a friendly smile on his face. “Did I what, Cap?”
“Tony,” Wade managed to say, his voice sounding far off and muffled to his own ears. “Don’t tell Peter.”
“We’re almost to the bridges,” Natasha said as she stood to one side, giving him a briefing on their progress. “Thor has cleared a lot of the cars off our major travel roads, and Bruce is doing good on keeping all the data organized. They’re working faster then we thought. We should be able to start edging our way into Queens this evening.”
“For staying behind to keep helping? Or for building that unit for Bucky. Could be for those chips you built even though you didn't know you'd need to.” He shrugged. “Just… staying around to help me.”
“Both are true,” Wade called, laughing as he put his feet on the coffee table.
In the months that followed the defeat and death of Thanos, Peter was kept very busy.
Peter followed the others on the tour, studying everything and wondering what everything did and how it worked. Everything just looked so interesting, he wanted to know everything!
“What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours,” the guy that took him said, and holy shit, that meant this guy was Francis!
“I know,” Tony groaned again as the got closer, finding Deadpool leaning over a guy who was pinned to the bridge with one of the swords. “I’ll fix it. I will.”
When he got the chance, he took it. He reached out, his fingers reaching and brushing the stone with surprising ease, as he got the step up that they needed.
Tony frowned, but he helped Wade out of the hospital, leading him to his car. He could only guess why Wade wanted to go home so quick. He couldn’t blame the kid, but he figured that it would be better to just go along with it.
Steve spends an hour after Tony took the arm kinda just… waiting. Sam stayed, just to make sure Steve didn't get jumped if he let his guard down. Honestly, Steve thought he was overreacting. It didn't seem like Bucky was going to hurt anybody, though it could just be that his arm being removed had drained him.
“And finally,” the last teacher said. “I'm Mrs. Warren, the Physics teacher, and my group will be Gwen Stacy, Edward Leeds, Peter Parker, and Harry Osborn.”
“I tried to get a hold of Coulson and Clint, but…” She shakes her head, unsure. “Nothing has worked so far. They aren’t answering any phone that I know of. I tried to figure out where that Scott Lang guy Tony had teamed up with is, but I don’t have any way of tracking him down either. I think we’re on our own, Steve.”
Interests peaked, Tony went over to the door. “Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door…” He pressed on the wall, and beamed as it popped open. “Yay!”
Peter wanted to ask his dad what he was doing, but Peter didn't really care. Everyone else was excited, so he'd pretend to be to.
“Good to see you,” Tony said first to Obie.
When Peter’s fifteenth birthday rolled up, he made plans to tell his friends who his family really was.
Before he could even open his mouth to speak or turn around, something connected with the back of his head, and Peter was falling to the ground as the world faded to black.
“How was the funvee?” Rhodey had asked, grinning as tears welled in his eyes. “Next time… you ride with me.”
“It was a memory. Of one of the people I killed… it was a woman, who looked so much like Stark's kid. She had been working on something that Hydra wanted, and so they had me hunt her down. She'd been pregnant when I started, had the kid sometime while I was tracking her, and then I killed her. I killed a woman who just had a baby…”
“You need me to do anything else?” Rhodey asked, his own eyes watering.
With the twins save and within reach, Steve was able to start focusing on Avengers work again. He was out on the field less then he would have liked, only spending a few hours in the morning and afternoon getting everything under control while Ned and Mary Jane babysat. They had started sending people back to their homes in Manhattan, as spread out as they might be, and gotten most of them back to a mediocre regular routine.
Then the other shoe dropped.
“Uh, no? Kind of work full time as a merc?”
Steve, out of everyone, was probably the most on edge. His chest was tight, feeling instinctually on edge, as he dodged attacks and threw his own. He'd only felt this way maybe twice in his life, and both times had ended terribly. This first time had been on a train in 1945, and the other in a lab not too many months ago. He knew, in his gut, that someone wasn't going to leave with battlefield without a grave injury, if they left at all. And with Bucky, Peter, and Sam gone, there was only one person left that could give him this feeling now.
-and wrapped one hand around the back of his neck to pull him down.
Coulson hadn't been pleased. Well, the man never seemed to be. But he seemed to be channeling Nick Fury pretty well right now. Wade was a little offended, but shrugged it off. Coulson wasn't keen on trusting him. Oh well.
The Avengers are under wraps with 37 pages and 15106 words! Sorry again for Peter's shitty characterization. Hope you all enjoyed. Please, feel free to comment any questions or just random thoughts. I love responding to comments, as it often helps me think of more stuff to add to future chapters. Any questions that seem important, like the one on Peter's legs, will be in the beginning notes at the next chapter.
Okay. Okay, maybe he was just late? That happened sometimes. Spidey would run into trouble on the way and have to web up a guy that was trying to hack an ATM, or run into a mugger and have to save a woman. Everyone was later now and then!
“Yeah. Mine to, Pete… Now come on! Time to see Uncle Rhodey. Why don’t you bring Cap with us?”
“We’re supposed to be a team,” Tony said. “We’re supposed to be
Tony laughed. “Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. So… Now are you going to come by and see what I’m working on?”
Peter chewed his lip, thinking for a moment, before he picked up his board and ran to grab his bag. He slung it over his shoulder, saying something to Ned before hurrying to the back gate, turning into the alley to look around for Wade. It was a slim chance, it actually being Wade, but he had to at least try.
that Tony couldn't think of this as a friend date. There was just no way. This was a date date.
“No, you’re blind.” Wade sighed, looking up at the ceiling. “I would go jerk off, but this is a friendly fic. Want to play Connect Four?”
It was a small twinge of hope, but it was hope. Peter must still be thinking of him. That meant there was still a chance. If he could find Francis, get him to fix his face… He could make it back to Peter before it was to late.
. And all thanks to Captain ‘I was a soldier in World War Two, but I don't kill’ Hypocrite. And the guy is my only hope of getting my face back so I can rejoin with my dream boy who is just to perfect. Oh, and stop the same from happening to anyone else, but mostly so I can get my boy back.”
Not even five minutes later, the tub was nearly empty of water. He had lost the bar of soap somehow. And when the hell did a rubber duck get in his pants? Peter kept splashing, and Tony was wide awake now. God, he had been wrong. Not a piece of cake. Peter was a water
"Doesn't matter," Wade snapped. "I'm going to kill you for what you did to Peter. The story ends with me getting revenge for you messing with our lives. Because I'm
With a snort and a grin, Weasel grabbed a glass and filled it, holding it up to clink it against the bottle Wade was drinking from. “Deadpool… To you, Mr. Pool.”
said as he pointed his Katana at him. “I’m gonna get you out of that shit box.”
“Will do!” A slight pause. “I have to go. You’ll tell me about camp when I get back, okay?”
“Just do it, Tony,” Rhodey said. “He'll say yes.”
“Not here,” Bucky breathed, shaking his head. “Anywhere but here.”
Deadpool, on the other hand, seemed to have other ideas. He sucked in a breath of horror, and looked between the spot the guy had escaped from and Tony. His head whipped back and forth, and Steve wondered if his neck would snap. But, it wasn’t the neck that did.
“Why would your father be against Harry?” Gwen asked, frowning. “He’s never met him. He hasn’t met any of us.”
Peter nodded quickly, grinning, and hurried to the bathroom. Tony followed, finding the tub already filled, only halfway, and Peter already pulling of his clothes. He set his coffee cup on the counter, rolling up his sleeves. This would be easy. Piece of cake.
“Tony…”
of fun at camp. The first week have passed so quickly, Peter had barely noticed he wasn't at home. His group had become sort of fast friends, though Harry and Ned didn't seem to get along to well. They did a lot of team building sort of things, either playing card games or board games, and doing some simple science experiments.
The lab? Friday knew to only let a chosen few in there. People he put on a very specific list. But… why all the secrecy? Why not just tell him who it was? Setting aside his tablet, Tony gave a pouting Steve a quick kiss before hurrying to see who it was. Rhodey? No, he would have gone to the lounge. Bruce? Wishful thinking, having been missing for over a year.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can see that.”
Tony spent a while going some arriel scans and trying to figure out
So guest appearances from Strange AND Wade. And don't worry. Wade will make an appearance in all the chapters from here on out.
"They believe that the creator of the universe exists outside our reality," the hooded man said. "They think that if they can tear a hole in reality itself, they can join the creator. And they try to do that by setting off atomic bombs in their own faces. Never gotten the chance to try, but with the way the world is, it might only be a matter of time."
"We're
Peter's plot here is a little vague at parts, but like I've said before, I'm not that great at writing fight scene.
The second week rolled around and they started doing competitive projects. Each team made tower structures that went up against a device that stimulated an earthquake. They also made rockets that they launched outside on the track. The simplest one, the one that Peter actually had the most fun on because it was so simple, was the egg drop. They won most of the competitions, though they did mess up on the rocket, since Peter was more familiar with repulsor tech and put just a
When Wade finally made it to the event, the place was already crawling with reporters and Happy had to bring him inside. He found Peter quickly, taking notes on the differences between every day Peter and event Peter. Because they were different. Normally, Peter would be quiet, talk only when he felt like it, while Event Peter was casually talking with everyone, almost ever stopping. Event Peter also had his hair styled, which was shockingly different from the usual ruffled mess, and he was wearing sunglasses like his dad.
“Yeah,” Peter shrugged, picking up his board to follow them to the skating area. “Ever since Uncle Buck left, Pops has been pretty stressed. They were best friends, after all, and spent a lot of time together. Almost as much as Dad and Pops do. I think he’s getting bored and it’s making him tense. Though, it probably doesn’t help that Dad has been working on some kind of secret project that takes up most of his time.”
Sooo, I meant to get this out yesterday, on my birthday, but I ended up not having the full day to myself like I thought. So here it is! Hope you all enjoy, even though its super late.
“Oh…”
They called in chinese for dinner, and Tony found out that Peter loved egg drop soup. Noodles were his second favorite, and he was strangely delighted when he found brocoli. Didn’t kids hate brocoli? Once they finished, and after Peter had insisted he eat lots and lots of food to, they went back down to the lab so Tony could do a little bit of work, making plans for a new suit, and so Peter could play and watch.
XxXXxX
Peter helped as Spiderman whenever he could, but was quickly put back in school to finish his senior year. He'd have to take summer school, like a lot of his classmates, but it wouldn't affect his college applications to much.
“Maybe I just missed you,” Steve replied, his voice seductively low, as he pressed another kiss to Tony’s lip. “Haven’t seen you at all in nearly three days.”
Oh! Now Peter remembered. She was the daughter of one of the police officers that didn't like his dad… He seemed to like Steve, though, and had thanked Steve personally after the Battle of New York. It might have just been some hero worship, though… Mr. Stacy didn't seem to fond of other heroes…
“Jay, perform scans.”
“Yes!” Peter had cried, jumping up and down and high fiving Natasha.
“I need you to listen to me.”
Tony was annoyed. Really, he was very, very annoyed. He was currently standing outside Wade’s hospital room, grumbling as the doctor refused to tell him anything. It had been nearly three hours since Wade had suddenly fainted at the bottom of the stairs to the lab, and while he hadn’t gotten any texts from Steve, wondering what happened, he was sure they wouldn’t be much longer.
There was a pause, as they played for a bit longer. Then, Yensin looked up. Little did the man know, what he said next shook Tony's very being.
“Peter?” Steve asked, going tense as he reached down and grabbed Wade by the front of his suit. “What do you know about Peter?”
XxXXxX
“Well,” his dad sait in that voice that meant nothing good. “I kind to build it, using Loki’s scepter?”
It didn't matter what they could have done. Everyone made mistakes, and there was no point worrying about fixing it. All that mattered was moving forward, toward the future, and working for a better tomorrow.
“It works,” Peter said, rather insistently, glaring up at Obie from his hiding spot behind Tony’s legs.
Steve scowled as they landed a few yards away, and watched with his arms crossed as Tony walked over to Wade. And then face palmed as Deadpool pulled his hand back to punch the pinned man only to have his hand land square on the crotch of the Iron Man armor. Deadpool, crazy son of a bitch he was, tilted his head in what seemed to be confusion.
“Shit!” He hissed as he was forcefully bounced off the force field of the Hydra base they were going after in Russia. They were mostly sure that Loki's scepter was inside, somewhere, and they needed it back.
“Research that would affect the team.”
His stomach tight with dread, Peter rushed to the roof, dropping his pack on it and pulling out the suit. It was embarrassing, stripping down to his briefs on the roof before pulling on the suit, but it had to be done. Once he was changed, he left the pack on the roof and crawled down the side to pear through the window.
Rhodey didn’t let him say anything, though. They sat in forlorn, companionable silence for a while before Rhodey eventually gave him a hug and a salute, and let Natasha in. She didn’t say anything, but at least her expression changed when she saw him. He explained everything, and she eventually nodded and left. It could have just been his ding mind, but he could have sworn he saw tears in her eyes. She would tell Clint for him. After all, Clint didn’t do sad and dying well.
XxXXxX
“Nothing!” Tony did not squeak, no matter what Rhodey said.
“The guy in the booth,” Bob said, looking over his shoulder. “He wants to talk to you, Wade.”
Wade had just barely managed to convince Bruce to let him come along. And, really, Banner's hesitation was reasonable. The man had been gone for most of the time Wade had been around, and what Banner had seen was probably just a vague memory of him helping with Ultron and, well, betraying them earlier that day. Still, Banner was a bit soft, and it took just the right combination of pleas and begs to be let out.
XxXXxX
XxXXxX
Steve pursed his lips, frowning ever so slightly. “I've… seen better, actually.”
The idea for this fic came from something else I was working on, an original story I was doing about a boy who had abandonment and codependency issues. That was mainly from the boys perspective, but this will mostly be from Tony's perspective. In this chapter, I hope I set the way for their codependency, and portrayed the change in Tony correctly.
“Nah. He can come get me once he’s up,” Tony said as he made it towards Peter’s room, only just then realizing how far it was from his own.
He gave a mock salute, sitting down with Peter secured and buckled next to him. Happy drove them home, and Tony carried Peter all the way inside.
He watched the fight, his body slowly getting chills as he looked for Steve in the crowd. Where was the blond? Had he been hurt? Tony wasn't sure what he would do if he lost Steve. He… he wasn't sure he could raise the twins alone, after losing Peter.
When he came down, many people cheered and tried to grab at him, but he just did a backflip onto a light post- Thank you Aunt Nat for those gymnastic lessons -gave a little salute, and was gone. He was tired, smelled like crap, and really hungry. If he hurried, he could probably catch the tail end of the report on the news though.
But as he pulled back out of Thanos' reach, Steve saw his chance. The sixth stone was within reach. If he could just grab it, he could keep Thanos' attention. He could keep the Titan focused on him, give the others the opening they would need, and be the only one at risk.
“Alright,” Obie said. “Let’s get started. Uh…”
“This isn't up for debate,” Pepper snapped. “Now
“Whaaat?” Tony gasped, drawing out the a. “Psh! Pep, I'm offended you think I did something! What if I'm calling just to say hello, to see how the best Godmother in the world is?”
In his surprise, Tony nearly slammed on the break. He turned and stared at Wade with wide eyed horror. “You want me to
Steve was left in the center of the battlefield, panting and dazed, as the snap echoed around them. All around him, his friends and teammates were gaping in shock, mostly in the direction of his arm. He could hear their panicked voices, but ignored them.
Eventually the rest of the team showed up, and the party was underway. There were more games, and they sang Happy Birthday and had cake. After cake was presents, which resulted in a mixed back of gifts. From Ned, he'd gotten the new Lego Death Star set, which they would eventually build together, while Liz and Gwen had apparently pooled together money to buy him a brand new camera. His old one was fine, but it was still old, and he'd accidentally scratched the lense a while back. Wade had apparently bought him a helmet and pads, which didn't make sense, until his dad said that Wade had permission to take him to the skatepark to learn to ride Wade's skateboard every Monday and Thursday.
This is a sort of between chapter, to fill in what would be a two year gap between Winter Soldier chapter and the Age of Ultron Chapter. Have fun~
Peter sighed, running a hand over his face. God, his parents were so embarrassing… But they were his family, and he wouldn't change that for anything.
Picking up a USB, he held it out ot her. “This is a lock chip. This’ll get you in. It’s probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.”
Steve had the single saddest face Tony had ever seen. It was like it someone kicked a puppy into a basket of starving kittens that was held by a tiny crying Peter. Tony hadn't seen a sad face like this since Peter was 6 and thought Tony was going away again. God, it made Tony feel terrible and he didn't even know why!
“What is this place?” Steve asked beside him.
Tony sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. What had he gotten himself into?
Eventually, he found a way out of the box. Well, it was more accurate to say that he found a way to blow it up. With him inside. But he survived. Sort of. He had fought Francis, but couldn’t beat the bastard. He had gotten stabbed through the chest to die in the burning building, but his mutation brought him back, and he’d gone to find Peter. Well, the readers already saw how that had gone.
The AI said nothing, and Tony took off.
“Oh geez, Deadpool, gross!”
“No, no,” Tony said, glancing at the timer Friday had set up for estimated time. Peter would be leaving his room any second now. “You’re fine. You’re the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I’ve ever met. You’re gonna do great. Is it too much to of a problem to ask? Cause I’m sure Pete would-”
“I am not old,” Jarvis gasped, scandalized.
“Love is blind, kid.”
The second week eventually came to an end and they set out to see different science centers.
But soon, Peter was on his way to his Aunt's office. He waved to the guard at the front desk, and walked to the elevator. Going up and up, almost to the top, until Peter finally stepped out. Bouncing on his toes, Peter reached out, knocking soundly on the door before poking his head inside.
“What?!”
Tony pouted, but let Rhodey hang up. He didn't have much of a choice, now. He'd have to call Pepper to talk, and that was just… awkward. She'd almost been his girlfriend, before everything with Peter happened, and now to talk about
“You don't like it,” Tony said suddenly, making Steve jump. “You didn't mean something like this when you asked me out to dinner. You're- I mean, I didn't mean to assume you were interested in me like that, but I had hoped and-”
“I haven’t even heard of him,” Ned said, and Peter had to hold back a laugh. Ned was such a chill and laid back guy. It was pretty funny sometimes.
“This is… Not for the military. I’m not… It’s different.”
“Tony,” Pepper said slowly. “What kind of ring?”
“Hey,” Peter said, pointing at them. “Don’t bring me into this.”
He didn't understand why Wade would do it. He didn't understand what the younger man had been thinking. Surely, Wade wanted to see Peter again, just as much as Tony did. So why make it all the much harder?
“Are you leaving?” Peter asked, eyes seeming to somehow get bigger, as his lip seemed to quiver.
Peter goes to high school. And starts poking his nose in business he probably shouldn't.
“Don’t eat anything that he cooks.”
XxXXxX
“Well, yeah, say that’s a hot spot.” He was a little out of breath, now, taking in a deep gulp of air as he went. ‘Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?”
“Two percent,” Jarvis said, just as the thrusters cut momentarily.
Instantly, Steve looked up from the sink, turning to see a helicopter view of Deadpool on the freeway. We could see several unmoving bodies, and what looked like blood, strewn around the man. Why did Tony say they could trust this guy again?
“It’s okay,” Tony choked out, eyes squeezed shut. “I’m okay. Daddy’s here now…”
“They’ll believe it,” Rhodey sighed. “Don’t do that.”
It didn't take too long to find the Guardians ship. It was parked just over a nearby hill, and Tony had Friday's help with it. She didn't have all of her functions, but she was able to send out a sensor for him.
“What?” Bob and Weasel say together, and Wade only giggles. Oh, New York was going to be so much fun.
XxXXxX
Tony paused, taking a deep breath. There was a click, signalling that the cassette had stopped. He leaned his head back, thinking that maybe that would be enough. He was just… so hungry and thirsty and
Steve stood up straight, turning to Wade. "you know where the last stone is?"
“Access denied,” the AI said, sounding oddly… monotone. “Emergency Lockdown in progress. Proper key required.”
“Not here to be the smartest,” Peter said with a grin. “Here to make friends.”
“Of course,” Steve said as he stood up straight, stooping for just a second to press a kiss to Tony’s mouth. “We’ll talk later.”
When Wade got back home, his arm was already starting to grow back. He had landed in a garbage truck, and the driver was thankfully heading in the direction of Wade’s place anyway. Letting out a breath, Wade made his way inside, grabbing a heat pack to put on his wrist as the stump grew a new hand. Al was sitting in her chair, grumbling as the roomba zipped by, the pieces of a cabinet left forgotten on the floor.
“Sorry,” Tony said, smiling just a little. “I have to take this. It’s… It’s about Clint, so…”
Before anyone could move, Wade held the Stone up in the air. A pulse of light shot out, and when the light dimmed enough for Tony to see, Wade was gone.
“He went out back looking for you,” Gwen said as she blinked. “Some guy told me and MJ that you were waiting for him there and-”
“Not quite,” Tony said, though a bit more friendly and relaxed then Steve would have liked. “But that doesn’t mean you’re not still grounded for the mess you made.”
“It is a tight fit, sir,” Jarvis was saying. “Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.”
“I love you…”
"Step back," he hissed. "I called Phil and Bruce. They're almost here. I'll get him to them, but you need to get back into the fight."
He felt his mouth go dry, and his throat felt tight. Swallowing dryly, Peter nodded, and barely noticed Ned stand up.
“Loki’s scepter must be here,” Thor said over the comm, and sure, that was important info, but
"Emergency Lockdown in progress," the robotic voice said. "Proper key required."
. He had to sleep. Had to… lay down and wait it out.
“Not from what I saw,” Tony said, moving to set Peter down, but still have him close. “We’re not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We’re gonna do something else.”
When he got to the lab, though, he didn’t find anyone he immediately recognized. It was… a man? Tony couldn’t really tell. They were wearing a thick, baggy coat, with the hood pulled up to hide most of their scared and distorted face.
“I don’t know,” Sam said, “but if it was what it looked like…”
"My arm will heal," Steve finally said, snapping Tony from his thoughts. "And Stephen Strange said he knows a surgeon who can advance the healing process if need be."
“Yes, Tony. Let's eat.”
“Have you seen these pictures?” Tony demanded, practically waving them in Obadiah’s face. “What’s going on in Gulmira?”
XxXXxX
“Yup,” Tony said, yawning a bit. “Finished and now it’s bath time.”
Tony frowned, watching his son for a moment, picking up toys and taking them to his little area of the workshop.
STARK: Yes dear?
“Friday,” he said as he moved towards the door. “If I’m not back before Peter wakes up, tell him not to worry and go eat breakfast without me. I’ll be back later.”
Unable to hold them back anymore, the tears spilled from Peter’s eyes, and he hurried to his room. He ignored the calls on his fathers, their voices muffled once he was on the other side of the door. Crawling into bed, Peter pulled the hoodie on, wrapping it around himself like a cacoon in an attempt to keep is trembling body warm as he cried. But now? It only felt cold…
“I’m…” Peter blinked. “I’m just your friendly neighborhood Spiderman!”
“When were these taken?” Tony asked, deathly serious.
“Will do, Baby Boss.”
Bucky shrugged, looking down at his mug. “I was… thinking about leaving.”
“But,” Tony stammered as Steve started to lead him out of the room. “What about our date?”
“Friday, time,” Peter mimicked.
“Tony?” Steve said, voice sounding almost weak. “Say something…”
“Ow,” Peter whined, rubbing the back of his hand. “That hurt…”
“I like it,” Peter said, holding onto Tony with one arm and the Captain America plush with the other. “Superhero name. Like Cap’n ‘Merica…”
Suddenly, Peter looked up and it was like a spell had been broken. He turned slightly, as if to look at Wade, and he felt a sudden wave of dread. Wade hurried away towards the bathroom as Peter’s new girl friend said something.
Once more, Natasha shook her head. “Our comms weren’t designed to go all the way around the world. Bruce can’t connect to him. We’d send Thor back for him, but we need him for clearing out the roads and rebooting generators with a bit of lightning.” She paused. “You know I want to get in to check on those kids just as much as you do, but you have to remember. Tony would have built a panic room that’s packed with enough food for years. And Friday was built for the exact purpose of taking care of children, with or without the help of nannies. They’ll be fine until we can figure a way inside.”
Tony was agitated. Sure, he'd seen his son just a few hours before after two and a half weeks away from him, but he was still agitated. Annoyed. Irritated.
So why did he worry?
“Yeah,” Wade sighed, happy and breathless. “Yeah, let’s go home…”
“Helium, Aluminum, Radium, Radon…” He trailed off, and Mrs. Warren stepped in.
Stepping up to the bar, Peter took a deep breath, bent down, and wrapped his fingers around the bar. He closed his eyes, licked his lips, and lifted with all the strength he had. Only for his arms to end up going straight up into the air, feeling like he was lifting nothing at all. Peter blinked his eyes open, expecting that maybe the weights had fallen off the bar, but found them being held easily above his head. Okay. so he could lift more. A lot more.
“Keep the skies clear,” Tony said, then, in a much more serious tone after the faceplate snapped into place, “And watch Peter.”
“The mission is for Peter,” he said, causing her to stop, pause and turn to him. “I spent years, with you by my side, reaping the benefits of destruction, instead of caring for him, about how he saw me. And now, when I don’t want to be the Merchant of Death, to be a villain in his eyes, and trying to protect the people I put in harm's way, be the hero that Peter deserves, you’re just going to walk out?”
“No,” Wade said, voice a sharp contrast to what it was before. “I want to hear it. No big words. Just tell me.”
Eventually, Tony got Peter to go sit on the couch, to wait, while he got the suit off. It was hard, getting the suit off, and Peter was giggling as the bots tugged at the pieces.
“Not today,” Tony told the reporters. “It’s way past Pete’s bed time.” Turning back to Obadiah, he said “This isn’t over.” And then, he left.
Instantly, Steve lunged, practically laying on top of Barnes as the Soldier screamed and jerked. His hands were pressing hard on Barnes shoulders, shins twisted around to keep the man's legs from kicking up while Tony worked frantically. This thing was supposed to be connected to Barnes body, his mind, and even be removed regularly. Why the
They went out to do something together every other week, and Wade would come to the Tower once a month to have dinner with them. That was the plan, anyway. Sometimes, Wade would disappear on a job. Show up a few days later. Peter always worried.
Slowly, Wade put his gun away, and took the notebook. He wondered, thinking maybe it was a trick, that this woman planned to escape while he was distracted by whatever this was. But the author had just sat down again, both hands tapping away at the keys once more. So he flicked the notebook open.
"Of course I am," Tony snorted, giving a cocky smirk. "Is that coffee? Tell me that's coffee."
"Tony!" A call echoed through the room, making them practically jump apart, both of them holding a child like a lifeline as Bruce came thundering down the steps. "Tony, we got a hit!"
The man gave a glance around, and then leaned forward. “Mr. Wilson, I represent an organization that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what’s more, give you abilities most men only dream of? You've met the Avengers. The world needs extraordinary men like them. We won’t just make you better. We’ll make you
He trailed off, leaving Tony to raise a brow. Steve wasn't one to hesitate. He was good at acting on instinct, acting quick and fast, and saying what he meant when he meant it. Even though it had hurt, Tony knew that Steve hadn't even hesitated when he had slammed the shield into the Iron Man reactor. So why was he hesitating now?
He didn't hate Wade. Really, he didn't. He may not like Wade, but he didn't hate him. Steve just hated, that even with everything, Wade had been more devoted to Peter then Steve had been to Tony. He hated how, when the pressure was high, Wade had done everything he could to get back to Peter. Or to avenge him. And Steve… Steve hadn't been able to do that. When things had gone sour, Steve had clung to Bucky, the last reminder of his past, as went kicking and punching, instead of even trying to talk.
“Baby Boss,” Friday said, drawing his attention away from the holograms. “Boss is arriving via Iron Man. Touch down in the pent house in about two minutes.”
“That’s just-” Tony sighed, shaking his head. “Okay, let’s make a deal. You graduate, and I’ll make you gear that only you can use.”
"Tony? Tony, can you hear me?"
“Yeah,” Peter said, stepping forward into Wade’s space, their chests almost touching. “Now… let’s get that mask off.”
“Well, your company did.”
“Not an angel,” Peter said, pouting, but took the bag from Happy anyway.
“Hey,” he said as he answered, starting to look for the gloves of his suit. Where had he tossed them when he got home? “What’s up?”
But Tony did. He understood what Wade felt. He’d felt it for so long, so very long, after he got together with Steve. And again after Ultron. It had taken forever to feel even a smidge good enough to be with Steve, and sometimes, he still felt like he wasn’t. So he knew what Wade was going through, and as much as he wanted his son to know, he wasn’t going to tell him.

“Papa Juliet Sierra 18-1-1,” Steve tried, using the most basic of his old overrides.
“Colonel,” Tony said, as he walked up, holding onto Peter by his shins. “Why not a pilot without the plane?”
Before Steve could argue, Thor was opening the bifrost, and they were suddenly pulled through the universe and appearing in front of Avengers Tower in New York. For a moment, all Steve can do is stare. Even though the snap had happened just over an hour before, the city was in chaos. There were screams and gunfire, and people running through the streets.
“This isn’t working. We’re going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.”
One night, as they played a board game, Tony got a little chattier then normal.
XxXXxX
"Mary Jane?" Steve asked, his brow creasing with a frown. "Ned?"
“True, but I thought you would want to talk.”
His teammate came down slowly, his face already contorted with worry, and turned into absolute horror when he saw Tony. Tony closed his eye, trying to think of what to say. He couldn’t tell Steve about how he felt. Not right before he died. And he couldn’t tell Steve how much he really meant to him.
Before Peter could stop him, Wade had closed the top, and they were dangling over the edge of the listing platform.
“I know you,” Bucky said instead.
“That,” Tony said with a grin, “is one of my robots. His name is Butterfingers, and he cleans my workshop. Or he’s supposed to. Hey, Butterfingers! What’s all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That’s my phone, that’s a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.”
When he arrived, he had kind of expected Steve and Sam to still be there and the Soldier to still be out on the couch. HExcept, Sam and Steve weren't there, and Barnes was up and walking around, searching the kitchen for something.
His friend and ex-girlfriend jumped, looking up at him in surprise. “Tony,” she breathed. “Oh, god… You’re awake…”
“Hi!” His dad said with his usual grin, wearing jeans, a Metallica T-shirt, and sunglasses. “Midtown High science group right?”
He didn’t hear anything that doctor said, instead focused on coming up with a plan. Plans A, B, C, and all the way to Z. But he didn’t know anything about cancer. He knew computer viruses and how machine’s work. So what could he do? He couldn’t even think of one plan, much less back up ones.
“Hello?”
Now, with the chance of actually dying, Tony thought only of Peter. He thought only of his… of his son that he'd had since he was four months old, but had never held. He'd never even picked up his own son! He had become the one thing he had never wanted to be. He'd become his own father.
“Banana Bongo 4-52, Stark-Rogers, Steven, Yellow Fever Voltron?”
“Tony,” his pops chided, sighing.
“I don’t want to pressure Tony into telling them,” he explained as he watched the cursor on the screen flick between shows. “What are you looking for? What have you been watching?”
“Sorry Cap,” Wade giggled, and fuck! Steve forgot that the guy had already snapped! “But Wolfy seems to be trying to get me to go with you guys. And, well, I don’t really trust her right now. So, have fun with New York! Lets hope she didn’t do anything horrible to Johnny and Susie!”
“Really?” His interest now peeked, Tony moved to open it, only catching a glimpse at the title before he heard the door to the lab open.
Steve frowned. “Right…” He shook his head, pointing over his shoulder to the hallway that lead to the bedrooms. “I'm going to get cleaned up. Peter gone?”
Mrs. Warren nodded. “Alright. Well, today will be a bit of a slow day, since not all of our equipment is ready, but there are a few activities for you to do. Mainly board games. I have to go get the equipment prepared so feel free to check in our free time box.”
She sighs, and Wade reached out to gently stroke her cheek with the back of his tiny hand. Her face screwed up in confusion.
Dr. Connors was shouting at his aunt, while Pepper tried to talk him down. She remained tense in her chair, but looked calm to anyone unfamiliar with her. Maybe Peter wouldn't have to intervene?
The day before, when Tony had returned, Steve had been so overjoyed, he had wanted to kiss him. But it had been so long, and Tony had just gotten back… He had known Tony had been in a vulnerable state, and he hadn't wanted to take advantage of that.
“Can we talk about this once I’m out?”
“Aunty Peggy,” Peter said, as if he were getting scolded, though Tony was more surprised then anything. “She came to the house while you were… While you were gone and watched me for a while. She gave this to me when she left… Am I not supposed to have it.”
