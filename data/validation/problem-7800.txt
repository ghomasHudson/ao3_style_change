Rhodey, Bruce, Mantis and Peter nod. May looks a bit unsure, though she, too, gets out a nod eventually. It’s unspoken though already fact that she’ll be teamed up with Rhodey. To defend herself, Tony gives her a gun for stunning.
“Come on! I’m bored out of my mind in bed!” Tony complains, watching his bots hurry after him as they try to keep Tony inside. Though, by the time they’ve reached him, Steve has already closed the door between them.
“T’Challa is leaving again,” Tony says, voice a bit hard. The smiles they were all having drop immediately. Natasha and Wanda stand up, along with Peter. They hug him and give him a kiss on the cheek. Then after a quiet goodbye, they join Tony at the door.
“He told you all this?”
“Hey, alien-girl! You’re training with me today!” The voice pulled Yaël out of her thoughts and made her notice that she had almost put the fork, with spaghetti rolled around it, in her nose instead of her mouth. Yaël blinked a few times and stared at the red-haired woman, she needed a minute to let her words sink in.
“Shut up, asshole,” Johnny mutters towards him, giving Felicia a quick look before seemingly sobering up a little. “And hello to you.”
“My, uh… my wife?” Tony asks, now not following anymore at all. “Listen, man, I gotta run, I’m sorry.”
There’s a sadness in her eyes that Peter can’t place, and for a moment, he wonders if he should just ask her about it, but instead remaining quiet. He leans back on the couch then, in his mind already making up that he’s going home when the clock get to eleven, which is only about fifteen minutes more.
“Well, then you should think about which words to use when you’re going to apologize to him, because he surely didn’t deserve your shit-talk. Unless, he does because he’s a big douche bag, well?” Peter shook his head, straightening his backmade him looked taller than he was already all of a sudden.
Tony shakes his head before offering May a short smile. The woman nods in return. Then she makes her way to the door and leaves them for a little while.
“But we’re going to be fine; it’s going to be okay,” Tony assures him, even though he doesn’t really believe it himself. The idea of having to go on without Steve grounding him just feels like agony.
“Uh, you have any idea what I’m doing here?” Peter asks. Yaël frowns and passes her hand through her hair.
Apparently, his other friends were better than her. Whatever, right? But Yaël couldn’t help feeling angry about it. She felt like she wasn’t good enough for him. Yes, yes, the kid was busy, school and the internship with his fucking new father.
When he opens his eyes, he’s faced with shocked expressions from Natasha, Clint and Cho, who have all three of them taken a step back. Looking down at his own body, Tony sees that, indeed, he’s covered by the armor. He throws his friends a wide grin, proud of his creation.
Then he slams down.
Tony doesn’t answer. Instead, he puts his brains to work. Thinking back of Peter’s phone, the familiar tune of his ringtone. He was sure that he heard it before, and now he remembers. On the plane. On their way to Berlin.
Chapter warnings:
When Yaël woke up again, she saw Raido, Cem and Nilla standing in front of her bed. But they didn’t look alive at all. Raido’s throat was cut open, blood still streaming over his body, Cem looked pale with blood dripping from his lips and Nilla… Nilla looked unrecognizable, her skin and hair were burned away completely.
“Please, I’ve barely been on the field lately,” Tony mutters out, tapping on the table while he looks down at the puzzle-cube he had been toying with. Looks like he figured it out again. “A lot of new heroes around lately, Iron Man’s not needed as much, anymore.”
“Deadpool?!” Peter finds himself shouting. A loud moan escapes his mouth and he throws his head back, taking a few steps to the other side. “Out of all the people that have to stalk me, it has to be the one who would be able to send me to an early grave.”
“Say, Karen, anything interesting for me?” Peter asks.
with them all the time. It’s not that Peter’s glad to be rid of Harry, but it gives him at least a little bit of time to deal with his medication-issue. It wouldn’t do them any good if he’d get another panic attack when Harry makes a joke.
He jumps back on his feet, ignoring the stinging in his head. He needs to get to the guy before he can run off. With a strength in him that he’s not really used to, yet, he jumps up into the sky and lands right where the blast originated. The guy’s nowhere near here, but his eyes catches the footprints in the dust on the ground. Somebody ran off before anybody saw it.
The phone doesn’t ring. Not anymore. He turned it off, either way. As a precaution. He doesn’t know the PIN-code after all. Or he doesn’t remember it at least. If he gets back to the idea of calling Steve, it won’t work. Only Peter can put the device back on.
Peter did wonder why they threw the thing away before even getting home.
“But I also know that the Tony from this time wouldn’t be ready for that responsibility. And I could pretend that I would change for him, but I’ve seen how it would be and it wasn’t pretty.”
been trying to get me to try it out, but I have been hesitating between here and Oscorp,” he says. Tony raises an eyebrow at the mention of Oscorp, but he doesn’t take it personal at all; Oscorp is good for the
She looked back at the black-haired man and yelled “Hi!” but he didn’t seem to hear her. She yelled again and started knocking on the glass wall in front of her. The man finally looked up and froze as he met her eyes.
“No, I mean, you both live in the tower, together. He’s moved into the penthouse. You two are… happy? I don’t know, there are still arguments but…”
“No way!” he calls out, yanking the box out of the bag and looking it over. There it is, the newest phone with 1TB of storage memory, a killer camera and to put it shortly just the fastest thing out there so far.
“Dude, you’re skipping classes? Not cool,” Johnny mumbles at him. Peter flips him off without giving him a glance, reaching for his energy drink and taking a large swing. “Aren’t you like the biggest ball of energy around? Do you really need more than that?”
About a week after Tony’s admittance in the hospital Steve figures he’s had enough of it. He’s stronger than T’Challa’s guards, and they won’t shoot at him. At all. What makes him hesitate even more? Steve’s about ready to run out of his room and hurry to T’Challa’s plane when suddenly somebody knocks on his window. Steve turns around, finding Natasha standing there.
That evening, when Peter’s already safely at home and Tony is working on his latest armor, his phone rings in indication that he has a message. Tony doesn’t look at it immediately, only opening it once he goes to bed.
Trying to talk about his problems without telling Aunt May about being Spider-Man is pretty hard. He wishes he could have told her the entire story so that he could get
“Yeah, it was less fun to be in the middle of it, though,” he admits, pointing at one of the big guys Harry’s drawn rather perfectly how Peter remembers it. “That space-whale gave me nightmares long after it happened.”
“Whoa, Peter! What wat
Tony’s surprised by his own reaction. In the past, he would never have reacted that way to her, too in love to speak against her wishes. Now that he’s no longer head over heels for her he finds it’s kind of easy. A bit like talking to Pepper now.
“What’cha working on?” Tony asks. Peter doesn’t look up from what he’s doing, something he knows Tony does as well when he’s concentrating really hard.
“Let’s get you out,” Tony returns. He moves to pick Peter back up, but right as he starts moving, a woman starts screaming behind him. Startled, Tony turns around to figure out what’s happening. There, he sees Steve running towards something. There’s blood on the ground, glass scattered around them all. Even from where Tony is seated he can see the red spots on Steve’s clothes. Whatever just happened, Steve got hit.
“Just- you know the question I’m going to ask, Steve. Let’s not make this a cliché thing, alright?”
Yaël looked around. The cage was sealed with another glass plate that also looked like it was unbreakable due to its thickness.
Tony stays quiet then, and Peter dares to look up, seeing the man with his head turned to the side, eyes locked on the ground. There’s something in his expression that shows pain, in a way. After a few seconds of silence and long breathing, he speaks up again.
“It’s not like that, Tony. I don’t hold it against you,” Steve utters back, still holding on to his arms. “I need you with me, I want you, only you!”
“Merry Christmas everybody!” Sharon shouts the moment she’s opened the door. Holding presents in one hand, she offers everybody a wide smile, and gives Tony and Peter both a kiss on the cheek before going towards Pepper to hug her in a greeting.
Being recognized while being on watch on a roof, Peter can’t help but smirk. When the person asks him to do a backflip, he doesn’t question it but shows off his trick. All he gets is an enthusiastic shout in return.
know him?” Peter asks before he remembers that she didn’t know Fury and Professor X before, either. “The guy owns pretty much everything here, comes on the news practically every day.”
When she gained consciousness, Yaël tried to open her eyes, but she could only keep them open for a few seconds. Everything looked blurry, but she could distinguish the fire somewhere above her, coming from the hole in her wall, leading to the hallway next to her apartment. Something smelled awful, like burned flesh. She knew exactly where she was: the trash-alley. Her head felt too heavy to even think about the fact that she was laying in dirt, stench and months old thrash. The only thing that was filling her mind, was the pain she felt, so it didn’t take her long to go unconscious again.
"Don't you need to go say something to him?" Charles asked.
“He’s asleep, he has an early morning tomorrow.” She gestures for him to sit. “Want to drink anything? Water? A beer?”
Peter’s not too sure how the first, initial idea came to him. It’s been there for a few years now, perhaps. The first thought of it came up when he offered that money to the homeless woman, disguised as Spider-Man. He’d wanted to help, but he couldn’t because Spider-Man wasn’t supposed to be
A few minutes later, her phone made a single ring-sound, but it wasn’t Cap who had answered.
“Em,” Peter starts, but she shakes her head.
“Peter, I don’t really- what about your friends? Didn’t you all need help with-?”
Peter nods. Good that Tony already fixed the systems in Peter’s hearing aid.
“Uh, in forty minutes,” Peter says, looking down at his watch. Yaël’s eyebrows go up.
“Tony, what’s going on?” Gwen has returned with Steve, so it seems. Peter can see Tony tense up visibly upon hearing the Captain’s voice. The engineer turns his head back to his project, obviously refusing to look up at him.
He remembers Flash inviting him to the party if he would get Spider-Man to join. Wanda would be difficult – she’s not back yet – but Spider-Man is easier; Peter just has to go, put on the suit for an hour, and then he could stay.
Hilde gives him a long, inspecting look. “Are you sure?”
Now, Yaël was capable of using the elements at the same time, but her mind and body were broken, badly nourished, not maintained. So her own steering came back to her, not in a peaceful way, but more in an implosion kind of way. Her body sucked everything back up, the powers came running back to their owner like she was some sort of magnet, way quicker than Yaël had ever been able to steer the powers. Within only a split-second, she saw her creations dissolve. It felt like there was a big ball of energy forming in her body, way too big to even fit there. This wasn’t going well, Yaël realized, but she didn’t have the time to act against it.
“Wow, good morning, angry German bitch.” Wade cocked an eyebrow as he saw Yaël’s murderous looking face.
“Tony?” May asks.
Hulk stormed towards them and grabbed Thor, still holding Yaël, and Brunnhilde right before he jumped extremely high. Yaël closed her eyes, succumbing from the pain at last.
“So did I, until they found him in the Ice back in 2012.” Tony sighs when he thinks back of that time. Oh, how they just couldn’t stand each other back then. It’s almost criminal…
“Should we send some of this stuff to Shuri?” Bruce asks. Tony puts a finger on his chin while he quickly looks over the words on the page. “The more people are on this, the better. Maybe send some of this stuff to Reed as well…”
Wade rolled his eyes. “I took care of it, duh!” he said. “Jezus, are you coming or not?”
Peter yelled at Yaël to hold tight, warning her for a crash. So Yaël grabbed whatever she could, hoping they wouldn’t die in the car crash. Yaël felt a blow, pieces of glass were making cuts everywhere. The crash made noises that gave Yaël the feeling she’d get deaf. Was she seeing fireworks now? Holy shit, it was the roof scraping over the asphalt! Yaël heard Peter groan and looked around. They stopped moving, yet Yaël’s body felt like she was still in the middle of a turbulence. She looked at her hands and saw glass sticking out of the rug of her hand here and there. Everything hurt while trying to escape from the vehicle, but Yaël got so nervous, her hands trembled as she tried to click the seatbelt open, so it took a few attempts.
“Dum-E, Butterfingers, bring me the medical kit. Try and keep everything sterile, okay? These are my bones you’re going to be working with.”
FRIDAY answers in that usual dry way of hers. Tony doesn’t need to look at the screen to know the pictures are up. He hears it in the way Steve is reaching forward to scroll through them.
Tony nods. Of course, Steve is going to take care of him. He always does, that’s why Tony loves him so much.
“She’s going to get our special guests,” Tony explains. Bruce nods, keeping his eyes away from Natasha. Peter shifts in his seat, fumbling with the pen on the table. There’s a digital copy of the accords on a tablet in front of him. It’s all one mutual document; if anybody makes a note, everybody can read it and comment on it.
“I lost my comm-link,” Steve interrupts him, holding a hand to his ear. “I took it out after the fight was over. It must have fallen out of my hand.”
With his hood pulled over his head and his phone back into his pocket, Peter opens up the window and expertly climbs out of it.
?” Natasha asks with her arms crossed, her eyes serious. Peter shrugs.
“You should go,” Hope tells Scott. “I’ll go downstairs and see if I can help down at the lab.”
Tony closes his eyes and counts to ten, again. After that, he lets out a deep breath and continues on his work. He has no clue how late it is, but it can’t be
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Wade mutters against Steve’s chest.
“What’s wrong with Tony?” she asks, pulling a few strands of hair out of his face. Steve is grateful for her, she’s the first one to actually
Steve doesn’t know if Peter should know. He doesn’t want Tony to keep things hidden from him, but just knowing it…
in the room starts cheering and clapping, even louder than earlier. Especially the members of the Avengers all start making winning noises, while May and Pepper just stand at the sidelines with big smiles on their faces and clapping their hands. The kids look away in disgust.
“Nope,” she said instead. Stupid honesty. Jason’s eyes twinkled a bit.
“It’s okay, it wasn’t you,” he assures him.
"The girl’s our prisoner, I have no need for unicorn-related-bonding-moments. What do you want me to do? Polish her nails? Let her talk about her feelings?"
Peter then opens up the gauntlet again, putting his hand inside and holding his arm up. Then, with his left hand, Peter searches a bit for the switch on the arc reactor, suddenly hearing that familiar sound of the repulsor loading.
Without much grace Tony lands in front of the compound. He carries the journals all the way into Bruce’s lab, only to find that he’s not in there. He doesn’t bother to ask FRIDAY for where he’s hiding, instead heading towards the medical bay in the hopes to see Peter shortly before he gets to start the research.
“I need to go,” Peter mutters, clearing his throat before pulling his hood back up. Behind him, the doors burst open, surely with Tony storming outside.
Cap and Iron Man arrive together, the two of them ready to charge the moment they get there. They’re followed by Falcon and War Machine. Somehow, the Goblin seems to have pissed off enough of them to call out for so many Avengers. Which reminds him that he hasn’t seen Thor fly around for a long time.
- Cliffhanger because DUH you know me right ;-)
“Well, the guy’s wife of so many years is dead. He has no children, no more house, his life’s work has literally failed. I would be pretty upset to hear all that. I think we should be careful when we tell him.”
“Here, now the phone itself is dead! Can you just leave me the fuck alone now?”
“Why do you do that? Do you do it out of a stress-related habit, like those people who bite their nails?”
“I would have never guessed you’d become a teacher.”
Peter smiles and closes his eyes. Slowly but surely, he feels like his family is going to get back together at last. With a wide smile, he lets out a loud sigh.
“Oh, hi Mr. Stark! I just- I’m not-“ Peter starts, but he can’t find his words. He jumps back to his feet and starts walking away from the edge. “I was just getting some air, is all.”
“Your,” Peter corrects him. Tony frowns and gives him a questioning look. “You said ‘their,’ but what you mean is ‘your’ secrets, right?”
“The nuke?”
“Thor and Jane are getting married,” Steve explains then. “Jane is pregnant, and they want to get everything in order before the kid is born.”
The, suddenly one day, Tony’s aunt passed away and Peter, Tony and Steve had to go to the funeral. Apparently she had been a good friend (or girlfriend? She’s not sure what she heard) of Steve too. Afterwards, Yaël heard that Steve and Tony hadn’t even talked during the funeral. Heck, they hadn’t even been sitting near to each other. So, yes, Yaël felt things were going from bad to even worse.
Nothing inside this room indicates that it’s his
“My, uh… Aunty Peggy used to tell me about how she wanted to take you dancing, but she never got to do that.” Tony turns to look at Steve, grabbing now both of his hands. “I figured… I could take you, instead?”
“Understood, we’ll be there,” he says with a shaky voice. Then he sniffs his nose and clears his throat. “Tony, we need to move, Strange found a place we can regroup for a moment and think of a new plan.”
“That’s a problem, sir,” someone in front of her said. It wasn’t the king talking, it was the counselor…Shit!
He turns around the moment he hears Tony arrive, face softening only a little bit but immediately coming back to its stoic expression.
He takes his jeans from the ground, hurries out of the pajama and gets himself dressed completely. He avoids the mirror again now. Without looking, he grabs his bottle of pills, checks if it’s the right one before leaving the room again.
Peter rolls his eyes the moment he hears the question. It’s about the fifth time already that Tony’s asked, and so far he’s always gotten the same answer.
“I don’t-“ Tony starts, but he doesn’t finish that sentence. He takes in the kids in front of him. The girl with her hair neatly put up, wearing a dark blue vest with a white shirt underneath, accompanied by a knee-length skirt. On her chest, there’s a symbol, some sort of crest. A short look at Peter and the other boy, he realizes they’re wearing the same kind of thing. “Are those school uniforms?”
“Fine!” The Hulk clearly had a weak spot for the Valkyrie. What? What was going to happen?
“Nice to meet you,” he says calmly. “So you’ve been caring for this brat in the time that I’ve been gone?”
the words on the screen say, and Peter laughs a bit in amazement. Tony is really incredibly fast when it comes to all this!
“Of course. By the way, Steve wanted to see you,” Natasha says while taking Tony’s prototypes. Pepper notices immediately how Tony jumps up after she’s spoken.
As Flash speaks, his friends start laughing. He hears some hands clap together in high fives, and Peter feels his cheek redden. When he tries to stand up, there’s a sudden foot resting on his chest, keeping him down.
“Bruce, Sam, Vision and James are in the waiting room,” Natasha confirms. “Wanda went back to her floor to wash up for a bit. She’ll be back in a while.”
Peter snorts. “I think you misunderstood. Just because he’s clearing up floors, doesn’t mean you each get one. They’re big floors, after all.”
After getting a kiss of his own, Sharon walks off towards where Steve and Sam are standing and Peter tries desperately to get a look of recognition from Steve. It’s hopeless, though, when Steve doesn’t even turn around to see him.
I remember how fast suddenly the chapters seemed to rush out, while, when I started the story all the way last year I had only gotten about four chapters done until August 2017. It all went by so fast, I can't really comprehend it.
.” Wanda’s eyes grew a bit bigger, she had trouble hiding her proud little smile for being on the same line as THE professor X.
“To say the least…” he mutters back. Tony doesn’t respond, but puts his head on Steve’s shoulder. “Wanda’s been feeling horrible.”
“Honey,” Tony says to get Steve’s attention. As the super soldier looks up, he smiles once he sees what Tony’s trying to do. He quickly leans forward, putting his head right next to Tony’s, his arms going around Tony’s waist.
Already knowing how much of the suit works, he doesn’t need much time to figure out what exactly he needs to do.
The closer they get to the scene, the more police cars there are showing. They appear to have made a perimeter, and there are hundreds of people standing at the sidelines trying to catch a glimpse of what is happening.
After Dr. Cho and Maria arrive at last, Tony turns towards Peter’s Aunt. “I guess we can start warming up the food, then?” Tony suggests to her, and she nods. Putting down her glass, she heads towards the kitchenette. Ever the gentleman, Rhodey follows her to help her out. Tony then finally stands up, clearing his throat. “Guys, can I just… say something real quick?”
At least, as relaxed as he can be.
Yaël helped him to get dressed, guided him to her sofa and served him a hot coco. Leaning with her elbow on the table behind Peter, she stared at him, but he didn’t notice. She kept an eye on him because she was afraid he’d shatter in a million little pieces in front of her, she was afraid his mental health would be completely beaten down after all of this, but most of all, she was afraid to think about herself.
They roll over after a while. It’s time for Tony to return the favor. Tony rubs his face all over Steve’s beard, enjoying the feeling of it. He doesn’t do the same; doesn’t kiss him everywhere. Tony doesn’t want to pull away from Steve’s face. He uses his hands instead. Or just one of them. The other hand, the healthy hand, holds on to Steve’s wrists, copying the position he was in earlier.
“Tony, please, I know you’re not sleeping.”
“A hug? You’re not a hugger?” Tony asks. Natasha shrugs.
Yaël jumped up, which was a bad idea since the quick movement combined with the lack of food made her feel dizzy. She knew what she had to do.
A young nurse passed to check on Yaël. As soon as the nurse noticed Loki, she started blushing and bumped against the side of the bed. With that, she quickly looked at Yaël’s wounds and hurried away again.
“He’s already seen you do some pretty crazy stuff, Tony. I don’t think Peter is just going to leave you.”
“I need to do this,” he says. He pulls out of May’s arms and smiles at her. Then he leans forward, kissing her on the cheek. “I love you, May.”
Peter’s looking better, too. His hair is still thinned out and his cheeks still hollow. There are also dark circles under his eyes, but other than that he seems to be doing so much better. Nothing a few weeks at home can’t fix, after all.
Clint shakes his head, rolling his eyes. “Nu-uh, I think it would be great if the people would humanize us more, if anything.”
Gwen chuckles, patting Peter on the back. “I love you, too.”  They pull apart, and hand in hand they start walking towards the door of the workshop.
died.”
on him in the past. How’s that even possible. “Thank you, man… for being  honest.”
“It’s alright,” Tony assures him. “I’ll shut up about it.”
“Why would I want to go to briefing right away? If I arrive late, maybe it’ll already be finished when I get there.” He fishes out a piece of candy from his pocket and props it into his mouth. “So who was that Gwen he was talking about? A friend? A girlfriend?”
There’s surprised gasps before a thunderous applause rises up in the public. Peter freezes up on the spot, suddenly afraid to get on the stage. He looks back at Steve, who nods at him.
“So you think the suit has something to do with it?”
“I would say you deserve that. You’re kind of a dick,” Peter tells him. The guy doesn’t respond. “Now, uh, you better stay away from her, or you’ll get to see me more often.”
“C’mon, we’re losing time. We need to get to Stark Industries,” she told him. He was obviously still not liking the idea, but he quickly strapped on his seatbelt.
“I’ll warm up the leftovers. You good?”
Miles knows that ‘Mary-Jane’ is just MJ’s nickname. In her attempt to remain anonymous, she goes out as the journalist ‘Mary Jane Watson’ while in real life she stays Michelle Jones. Miles only knows this because he once heard her talk about it to Peter when the two of them thought they were alone.
“You two are like rabbits! It’s like I always seem to find you like this whenever I enter a room…”
“’m feeling fine. Time to take the stitches out, right?” Peter asks happily. He’s glad to be rid of them, since they itch a bit. His wound is literally too healed up to keep them in.
FRIDAY responds. Peter sighs again before pulling his hood back up. He doesn’t know why he does it, it’s not even that cold.
Remembering how everybody would be training outside when Peter arrived, Peter now feels something hollow coming across an empty field. There’s no Natasha to greet him. No Steve to slap him on his back and laugh at his stupid jokes. There’s no Clint, whose humor is even worse than Peter’s.
"They aren't real guns. If you see someone, shoot at them. There won't be an actual shot, but if the lazer comes in contact with the suit it'll be counted along." Then Tony holds up his tablet. "In the end, we'll see who's been shot at the most during this
Tony asks with a sigh. Peter just hopes he isn’t going to jump into his suit; he’s in
“You what?!”
“So, uh… you two are, uh, together?” Barnes asks, obviously trying to lighten the mood. He speaks in a hushed voice, but probably still loud enough for people to hear them. If his plan is to sneak up on them, he’s obviously not doing it right.
Next, there’s Sokovia; the city floating in the sky, buildings falling down. It’s a clear indication of Wanda’s strength to see her looking on as she sees her hometown being destroyed.
Peter lies back down after that, putting a hand on his eyes to filter out the light. Then he grunts, looking to the side.
“What do you want to know?” Steve asks. “My secret crush? I’m not telling.”
Yaël smirked. “Let’s move to another country.” Nilla looked a bit surprised, and then burst into laughter.
“I have a mild concussion, a couple of bruised ribs and a fractured leg. Nothing that can’t heal over time,” Strange grits out through his teeth.
“Uh, I’m sorry to hear that,” Peter tells her, truthfully. The Cat just shrugs.
“What is going on?” she asked Loki. His smile showed he knew exactly what was happening. Immediately after her question, Thor jumped down from the palace onto the Rainbow bridge and with that crushing down dozens of Völuspá’s zombie-army. “Wow, he’s in the zone, alright,” she mumbled as she watched Thor knock down enemy after enemy, using his lightning.
“Dunno,” Peter answers.
Peter looks up, eyes opening despite the heaviness in them. He smiles before he can even see any of the people he knows are around him. All the Avengers are here. All his friends are, too. Of course, they are; they had been here before they put Peter under, after all.
Peter had told him with a grin, glad that even Tony seems to understand that they’re not ready for the ‘dad’-card.
Despite Stark being the co-founder of the center, Miles has yet to meet the guy. He hadn’t been there when it opened, and after that the appearances of Stark have only happened the odd times he was in New York – which rarely matched up with Miles’ schedule.
Damage control, that’s what Tony needs to do now. He needs to talk to the people, assure them that it wasn’t a trap; that he hadn’t counted on Spider-Man being there when he alerted the authorities. But also to assure them that he’s underage, that he didn’t know any better.
,” she calls out.
Steve takes Peter over from him in such a gentle way, one would think he just doesn’t want to wake him. Making sure that his head doesn’t just hang there lifelessly, he makes sure that it’s resting against his shoulder as he stands up. Tony lets the suit surround him again, but it’s not much use anymore. He takes Steve’s shield, too, after he asks for it.
“You’ve got to be shitting me,” Clint complains.
Peter glares at her. She can’t see it.
Pepper laughs. Rhodey gives her a greeting hug when he finally turns to her. She kisses his cheek. Tony never minds; the guy is part of the family, after all.
Tony’s never really had everybody there for him at the same time. Or maybe he did? There used to be more people for a while, didn’t there? Where are they, now?
Tony rolls his eyes, because that’s not an answer to his question. Giving the house another last glance he suits up and gets in the air as quickly as possible.
“This is fucked up on many levels,” Peter mutters, finally shooting the web and deciding to get to somewhere he can actually see. The normally white web that comes out of his shooters is now jet black, and one short look at his invention makes him realize that there’s something else wrong.
Peter bites his lip, about ready to apologize to MJ about Johnny. She surprises him by putting her head on his shoulder and taking his hand into her own. He can’t help but let his mouth drop open in surprise. Peter blinks a few times, waiting for reality to kick back in.
“So, you
The Captain didn’t move or say anything for a second, completely flabbergasted, like he was staring at a ghost. So… Fury nor X had talked to him already. Did Yaël just accidentally mess up Fury’s plans?
“Mr. Parker, take a seat, please,” Principal Morita says, pointing towards the empty seat next to Mr. Stark – who isn’t looking all too happily at Peter. The teenagers tries to swallow away a sudden lump in his throat, but then obeys and drops himself down in the chair. He does his best not to look at Mr. Stark, keeping a straight posture as his eyes rest on Mr. Morita’s desk.
“I’ve been searching for you, kind of been stalking you with my AI because you’re kind of hard to find.”
And that makes Tony stand still. His mind wanders back to the Mary he met once in that alternate universe Mordo sent him to. The one where he married Mary before Peter was born. The one where his kids hated him, where he was a cheating husband who didn’t love his wife anymore, but didn’t want to get divorced because that would ruin his name.
“Peter, are you alright?”
“What?” Yaël asks, suddenly pulled away from whatever train of thought she was in. “Pffrt, no way! I’m fine.”
to be near him.
“Oooooh,” he says, sounding clearly drunk. “Good, don’t run off!”
Then the conversation falls quiet. A little drama has been averted, and Peter’s secret is once again safe. He slowly picks up the arc reactor again, looking at it in silence as he tries to figure out the next step. Dum-E then hands him a steamy cup of coffee. In the background, he hears his cellphone ring again. Another text-message.
Peter shakes his head. And so, Pepper starts explaining. And Peter listens, taking in every word. And after the call ends he starts working on it immediately.
surveillance, obviously (even at school there’s still somebody watching him) – and Natasha can’t say she dislikes the boy.
“I’ll be back,” he assures them. “Just going out for a walk, you two just… do whatever you need to do. But… please, buy a new couch afterwards.”
Well, at least she remembered the compound. Yaël gently put Steve on his side, with his head on a pillow she got out of her bed. Then she dug out a blanket from her closet and put it over him. He’d do the same for her, she thought as she put on her pajamas.
The door is open now. Steve or Barnes must have left it like that, not bothering to close it. It might be for the best, too, in case they need to make a quick exit.
Peter’s stretching his limbs the moment he walks out. Bruce takes a look at his cellphone and clears his throat after a few coughs. Is he getting sick? Or did he just accidentally choke on his own spit? Tony does that sometimes, and it’s really just the worst.
“Don’t worry, I’ll bring him around,” Peter assures him with a wink. Steve chuckles slightly, pulling Peter closer to him again into another hug. Looking over Steve’s shoulders, Peter can see that it’s dark already.
But she wasn’t.
Of course, this is Steve, so there’s no really any question.
Then he takes a deep breath.
“Yaël, you want another?” Yaël looked up and saw Wade hanging above her with a pint in his hands.
sound.
One instant she was still with Harry, the next she was admitting to Spider-Man that he’d been the reason why she broke it off in the first place. And then there’s Harry who has been nothing but supportive about it.
- Kind of everything back to normal but everybody is sad and missing
there.
“I’ve been taking breaks!” Yaël threw back.
“Where to?” Heimdall asked.
He’s starting to form a headache again. His thoughts are going much faster than before, and he finds that he can’t quite catch up to it after a while. With input coming from everywhere, he can understand what Peter meant when he said that the lenses on his suit help him focus more. It almost feels like Tony needs one of those of his own. Oh, shit, what has become of him…?
Steve is at his side in an instant, pulling him into his arms and keeping him in a tight hold. Tony grabs his shoulders, letting out a panicked sob while pressing his face against Steve’s chest.
“I can understand,” Tony says. Hearing that you suddenly have another living family-member
“Peter misses him, too,” Tony says. Then he stands up after all. He shouldn’t be here for too long, it’s not safe. “Tell, uh… tell him Peter’s doing okay.”
“It was just a figure of speech,” he counters.
“Hey, Steve!” Peter greets him. “You sleep enough? You look tired?”
“FRI, open up will you?” Tony asks with a low voice. The moment he’s said the word, the doors burst open with two sets of footsteps barging inside. Oh, crap, he’s really going to get it now…
He would then work some more, until it was time for lunch or dinner. Then he would go to the cafeteria a few floors below, and enjoy a good meal while scanning the whole room in search of Mr. Stark before returning back to his work.
“Hello?” Peter asks. The laughing stops, and immediately there’s fast shuffling noises until suddenly a bare-chested Steve jumps up from behind the couch, looking red all over his face.
Wade was right, she should call professor X, maybe he’d know where she came from. She could also wait until she slept again, but she didn’t always dream about the forest, so there was no certainty in getting more info via the dream within this week and she really, really wanted to know it as soon as possible. But Yaël didn’t want to bother or disturb X once again.
Yet he hesitates. He’s seen an infant-version of his son before – he has the eye of Agamotto to thank for that – but this is going to be something different. This is going to be the Peter he knows at a certain age where he doesn’t yet know about him. The Peter who is probably way too young to even know about Tony Stark in the first place.
“I totally get you there, Stark,” the Soldier says. “The days I can even
“I’ll try and stay away,” Peter returns. Then he kisses Tony on the cheek and runs into his room. He needs to let Ned know, immediately! But before he disappears, he turns back towards the table. “Oh, and by the way, Ned and Harry are coming over tomorrow evening, are you home then?”
“Yeah, because you were so extremely innocent,” Wade threw back sarcastically, holding the dress in front of him, like he was going to fit it.
Steve sighs and gets up, shaking Tony’s shoulder for a bit.
“Next time you’re not allowed to play,” she shouts back to him. The four of them then throw their guns on the ground as an indication that the game is officially over. With a nod to the left, Wanda indicates that they should get back to the living room. Peter agrees, following her out of the hallway.
“There are a whole lot of sub-classifications in our spectrum,” the young girl of Peter’s age – surprisingly enough, her name is Petra – says. Peter blinks in confusion. Should he look it up, perhaps? But what would he need to look up, in that case?
Tony nods, using the wipes to clean his hands before taking the needle between his fingers. He tries not to think too much about it, about how drawing blood isn’t that unfamiliar to him. Or rather, injecting something
That’s also probably why he’s never really punished for all the bullying he does. But… why does he do it?
Tony puts a hand on Steve’s mouth to make him stop talking. When Steve has calmed down a bit, Tony slides that hand to Steve’s cheeks, taking his face into his hands.
“Hey, if it involves kissing my man, I’m glad to do it,” Tony says happily, leaning against Steve while patting his chest lovingly. Steve just clears his throat, clearly still not the most comfortable here.
“No kidding,” Bruce complains, rubbing his forehead while letting out a sigh. “Just when you think it’s finally over…”
Tony returns. “
Tony bites his lower lip.
“That will depend on all of you,” Ross says. Sue nods, discontent with the answer. She won’t complain, though. Instead, she knocks Reed on the head in search for his attention.
“So, uh, how’s the food in-“ Peter can’t finish his sentence. His ear is suddenly filled with loud noises; an explosion, of sorts. He reaches for his ears, head feeling like it’s splitting apart. Meanwhile, under his feet, he’s pretty sure he can feel the ground shaking. Startled, he looks up to Harry who gives him the exact same worried expression.
In the complete darkness, someone managed to find her hand and pull her out. As soon as Yaël was somewhat freed from the mud, she looked into X’s eyes.
“And ignore Mr. Stark’s wishes? I should be ashamed of even considering it,” Peter jokes in return. Johnny lets out a laugh.
“You want proof, I can give you proof,” the guy says before fishing out his phone and searching along on it. Then he turns the device around and points it towards the two others in front of him. “See here, Mr. Parker handing his homework.”
“Whoa, how did you stumble upon him?” Peter’s eyes twinkled curiously.
“For who?” Natasha asked. Steve looked back up at her, his blue eyes meeting the greens of hers. At that moment, the shape of her eyes, the shape of her face… it reminded him much of Pepper Potts. He let out a shaky breath.
Oh, right, he’s not that much of an asshole.
“I don’t care. My son is currently busy getting his second and third degree at the same time. I’m not distracting him from his studies because the company wants ‘some youth brought back into it’.” Tony does the airquotes as he speaks.
Bruce looks away, embarrassed immediately. Tony recognizes that reaction on the spot.
“C’mon,” he says. “Let’s find that bastard.”
Okay, that last part is just added to tease him a bit. He knows Tony is going to get flustered after this, and he can already hear him sputter on the other side of the line.
“Something’s going on with me, Dad. And I don’t know what.” Peter’s voice sounds so broken, so vulnerable. Tony can’t help but walk up towards him, sit down on the bed and take Peter’s hand into his own.
Tony had been a bit sad when Steve admitted that he didn’t want kids. He’d thought he lost something before he even had it. He had been angry at Steve without ever telling him, pretended that everything was fine while, for a whole week, he was about ready to decide the relationship couldn’t work like this anymore before he came to his senses.
Peter tries to dial the switch back down, but it seems like he’s too late. Quickly turning to somewhere there isn’t any glass, a blast of energy escapes from the gauntlet, hitting the wall with a loud noise. From the sudden shock, Peter is once again thrown from his seat, finding himself on the floor again, looking up to find dust filling the room.
Fury doesn’t speak, instead giving him that usual glare of his. On his way out, he quickly fishes out the same little device he used the first time he was on the Helicarrier back in his world. Now, instead of letting JARVIS process the files, everything gets into his head immediately. Maybe not the best idea to start multitasking at this point, but if needed he can just put the whole thing on hold until further notice.
He shouldn’t have been too surprised that Tony would have invited Aunt May to come to Disneyland as well. The guy can arrange everything.
After that, Peter steps out of his father’s embrace and follows Yaël out of the hall. He’s aware people are looking at him in worry, afraid that he’ll collapse in any moment. But while his body might not completely feel like it, Peter’s pretty sure he can keep himself standing. Just one step at a time, Steve told him a few days ago. Keeping his eyes on the ground, he makes sure not to fall down on the ground.
Anyway, here you go, I hope it doesn't suck too much. I'm not the greatest at writing action sequences. I usually rather gloss over fights, but since it's the final boss I suppose I couldn't skip this one.
“You gonna ruin every birthday present like this from now on?” he asks jokingly. Steve just grins playfully before leaning forward and kissing Tony gently on his lips. It’s soft and slow, especially pleasant when Steve’s fingers slowly caress his skin. Tony gasps for breath in the short few seconds that they aren’t kissing, but other than that they never let go of each other.
Because he knows she’ll say yes.
“You, uh… you have a robot suit?” Steve asks in confusion. Tony raises an eyebrow, unbelieving that this is the first thing Steve would ask.
“I’m going to fix this now,” he says, trying to sound more assured than he feels. Steve just gives him a sad look while pressing his lips together.
“That kid in the middle? That’s our son. Peter. He has my eyes and your hair, he’s extremely smart but never skipped a grade because you were afraid he would end up like me.” He allows her to take the phone from him. The device is also something she’s never seen before, but that seems to be the least of her interests. “He keeps on going to school, about to get himself three diplomas. He has a girlfriend he avoids introducing to us even though we’ve already met her once shortly in the past.”
Peter nods. “I’m sure. I can’t- it’s all been too much already, today.”
“Oh…” Wade looked a bit disappointed at his bottle. Then he looked back at her with a wide grin “Let me try it!”
Peter hesitates for a few seconds more before nodding and letting go of the ceiling. In a swift motion, he drops down on the ground. When his hair keeps on sticking up, Shuri laughs and passes her hand through it to mess it up even more.
She hadn’t been heartbroken or anything, though, since she hadn’t been in love with him. That and he had warned her. It had been cozy and comfortable as long as it lasted. She missed that little, easy cocoon.
Peter wakes two hours later. He’s still quite groggy, unable to give a verbal answer to many of the questions asked to him, but he does seem to recognize the people around him. His hand reaches out in both directions, and Tony and May both automatically reach for them.
They talked a bit and then sat down on a few rocks behind them. Yaël couldn’t hear what they were saying, but she simply couldn’t look away. She hadn’t seen him in real life for such a long time... Did his hair actually grow even longer?
Yaël noticed the change of surroundings and looked up. They were standing inside of one of the dark hallways or the castle.
“Uh, no not the Iron Man suit. It’s something for a new guy, he said,” Peter answers then with a shrug. Then he gets a poke on the head from Michelle.
“I did what I had to do,” she says, no regret in her voice. “We went this the wrong way. There are other ways we can fix this. ”
“Why would you say that?” Peter asks in confusion.
“That’s what you get for pulling it off until the last thing,” Peter mutters to himself. “FRIDAY, can you explain to me what this ‘
“Natasha,” Pepper returns politely.
“Uh, she’s just- the Goblin- couldn’t… catch her,” the kid then stammers out, not really making any sense at all. But, the mention of the Goblin is enough for Tony to figure it out on his own. He did hear that one of the victims from the whole Goblin-affair half a year ago had been a teenage girl. Another person he had lost… poor kid.
But Peter can’t move, either. His arms are pressed against his ears; there’s no headphones to drown it out here. Nothing that can lower the effect of the sound for him. On the side, he can see Harry on the ground as well, protecting his ears.
“What the hell? How can anybody get the better of him? Isn’t he, like, the most powerful of us all?”
“This is awesome,” Peter mutters, taking another good look at what his father is creating. “That way you can protect yourself when you don’t have the suit near?”
Yaël turned back to Peter. “How do you plan to get to know him?” she asked. Peter’s story was kind of sensational. But she didn’t want to disrespect him, because for Peter it seemed to be only stressful, so she didn’t show him how excited she was.
“MJ? What’s going on?” Peter asks in confusion. MJ turns towards him, giving him a wide smile before shrugging.
“So he’s got brain damage?” Tony asks. Bruce sighs and sits down on the ground, passing a hand through his hair.
Somehow, during the movie, they’ve shifted on the couch until Peter is lying with his head on Tony’s lap, eyes closed as he’s falling asleep. He’s only vaguely aware of Tony’s fingers going through his hair, or Steve gently picking him up from the couch to bring him to the bedroom he actually still hasn’t seen.
“They’re not that bad,” Steve assured him. “Besides, you should be going to bed.”
Steve motions for Barnes to lower the gun, which he does, eyes still resting on Tony carefully, like he’s preparing himself for another attack.
To be fair, she’s aware that Tony never really got along with Steve. It’s partly because their personalities just clash, but also because of the way Tony has been raised. Thinking himself undeserving of Steve’s friendship, things have been tense, to say the least.
His phone starts ringing in his pocket. Peter quickly fishes it out, finding that his Dad is trying to reach him. Slowly, he gets on his feet, indicating to the others that he needs to take this call.
Yaël used all the energy she had leftto shoot fire to her sister. Luckily she didn’t have to move for that. Nilla dodged it, looking surprised. Of course, attacking a fire-steering woman with fire wasn’t the best tactic ever. So Yaël went over to water, but as there was no water nearby, she retracted water from her own body, which make her throat immediately feel dry. A string smacked Nilla against the wall and started freezing her. Of course, Nilla melted that down immediately.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Of course I can,” he objects. “Listen, this is nothing we can’t fix at home. I have a first-aid-kit back in the worksh-“
“If you don’t mind, might I at least, I don’t know, get the chance to take a shower and put on some… clothes? It’s a wonder that Tony’s pants didn’t completely rip when I changed into… the other guy. He likes to wear them tight, you know!”
As it turns out, I'm only getting sicker. I was about ready to head to bed until I realized I hadn't posted this one yet. So, here we go!
“You were angry,” he states. He doesn’t blame Peter, he would be angry at himself, too.
“No, he thought they were shit,” she laughs. “There was a long argument about it, but we’ve been out of action since then. I’m glad we’re here now.”
“No,” he says sternly, putting his hands on his hips. Clint just snorts.
arc reactor?”
So after a little while, Natasha started having conversations with the weird alien-girl. Nothing deep, but just light conversations which built up to, after Yaël had stayed in the compound for a little while back then, joking around and triggering other residents with their sarcasm. That didn’t make Tony like her more, though.
Peter’s mouth falls open as he fails to find a response. Tony clears his throat.
The best friend who is now about to kill him.
Mary seems to catch on as well as she grips the steering wheel tighter. “So, uh, where are you, currently? In this year, I mean?”
So Tony goes downstairs, gets to the lab and starts to get to work. JARVIS informs him of a few incoming calls, but Tony dismisses them all. He doesn’t stop until he gets JARVIS completely connected to the nanites, hearing his familiar and comforting voice inside his head.
Okay, now he’s really searching for it. He understands that the man before him build his first robot when he was even younger than Peter now is, so this all probably doesn’t sound impressive at all.
Natasha leads him through the hallway. She nods thankfully to the family that resides here, who have given her the permission to meet up at their house. Tony wonders how she came across them, but he decides he’s not going to ask. He’s not
“So, what? You just decide to throw my plates and start shooting at my floor to proof that this guy can swing from one building to another? There are other ways to do that, Wade!” Yaël barked, Wade flinched a bit.
“Hi, uh, I just- I wanted to ask- I’m having a party tonight; my parents aren’t home. Do you, maybe, want to come?”
“I’m not sure I want to know the answer to it,” Peter then answers to that. He then finally stands up, getting ready to leave.
“Tony, you’re awake! Good!”
And everybody looks in fascination as Thor gently puts Mjölnir down on her lap. She doesn’t seem too affected by it, though her eyes are staring right at the weapon, face slightly turned into a frown. Then, without a word, she reaches out her hand towards the hammer. When Thor wants to pull it back, she gently slaps his hand to the side.
“YOU GIVE ME MY SON BACK YOU ASSHOLE!” Tony shouts, punching him on the chest. Steve jumps behind him to pull him back, but Tony keeps on struggling. “YOU CAN BRING US BACK SO JUST DO IT SO I CAN KEEP HIM SAFE DAMN IT!”
. That’s why Peter just ignores the figure in the tree and hurries back home.
“-he doesn’t speak English!” Yaël interrupted him.
“I’m really sorry, Tony,” she admits.
Tony sighs, leaning his head to the side until it’s resting against Steve’s chest. Without speaking they start up the movie. It feels good, indeed almost as if they’re back to that first month together, where Peter still went to high school. That time where most of their troubles hadn’t happened yet.
“Obviously, I am,” MJ says smugly, slightly sticking her tongue out as she tries to outsmart Johnny. The latter just seems to have accepted the fact that he’s not going to win the moment he crashes against the wall and swings off the road.
his interview at Stark’s.
“You are a genius!” Tony says. He hurries back to the scientist, puts a hand behind his head and kisses him on the forehead. Bruce, of course, pulls away.
“Yeah, they do that sometimes,” Peter mutters out, not really knowing what else to say. He hasn’t really spoken to Michelle much since he’s known her. He doesn’t even know if he’s considered ‘friend’ enough to call her MJ, like she said.
“Listen, it’s normal that you feel panic right now,” Dr. Cho says after a long moment of silence. Peter finally looks back up at her, and only then feels that there are tears in his eyes. Tears of sadness or of joy, he doesn’t know, really. “You found out you have a living parent after thinking probably for years that they both are dead? That can only lead to a bit of shock.”
“Dude, I thought you couldn’t?” he asks, clearly confused. “You know, with your medication and all?”
“FRI, don’t tell them I’m leaving until they specifically ask for it, please?” Peter asks.
“Your boy found the eye of Agamotto,” Strange states. Tony gasps; Peter didn’t mess around with the infinity stone, did he?
“Who do you mean?” he asks. If Harry caught her staring, that means he knows who the other guy might be, right? To be fair, Peter never really noticed her doing that, but it’s not like he tries to pay attention to her all the time. That would be weird, after all.
He sighs when he feels his phone ring inside his jeans. Yeah, that’s another thing that’s changed since this week. Without looking at the screen, he picks it up.
“Then I expect you to sing a song on Steve’s next birthday, okay?” Sam suggests. Peter grins widely while Steve just turns redder by the second.
“Nah, I won’t be staying long, just headed for the workshop,” Peter returns. He takes off the mask and gives it another long look. It’s so weird in many ways.
“Planning on making it up to me after this?” he asks, letting his hand glide over Steve’s chest, smirking underneath the helmet. Steve clears his throat while starting up the bike.
Tony stirs next to Peter. The teenager jumps up, shifting in his seat until he’s leaning closer to Tony. His breath evens out again, but he seems agitated in his sleep.
Tony Stark tells Pepper and Peter that he went to India for Stark Industries business.
“And I love you, too,” Steve whispers to him. “I love you so, so much.” Tony pulls his hand away, instead opening up his arms as an indication for Steve to collect his hug. Steve kicks off his shoes, lowering himself down on the bed until he’s between Tony’s arms. Wrapping them around his partner, the two men close their eyes again, breathing in each other’s scent.
Tony asks when he runs the water to wash his hands.
“No, I don’t,” Steve admits. “Sometimes-“
“Can I help you, sir?” a friendly voice asks back at the lobby. Peter looks up and sees a young man smiling up at him from where he’s seated. He had one of those earbuds in his ears to call with, and the computer he’s using seems to be the latest of Stark’s design. The guy always seems up to date when it comes to his business.
Tony is rambling. He does that when he’s angry. And he’s literally
“It’s not right,” Steve suddenly says. “A kid your age shouldn’t have to take all these chemicals.”
Tony smiles lightly before closing his eyes again. This is far from a happy moment. Very far from it. But it’s a beginning, which is enough for Tony.
“Yeah, I would gladly pay up, how much do you want from me?” Tony mutters, pulling out his wallet from his back pocket. He doesn’t carry a lot of cash on him, but he’s got his cheques, which he can quickly write one of for him.
“You’re right. I should head out, as well,” Steve mutters. He, too, gets out of bed. Not bothering to head for the showers, he just puts on a few clothes near to him. “I’ll get the coffee ready.”
Steve stays quiet when Tony gets up and closes up the space between them. When he’s standing right next to him, Tony takes Steve’s hand into his own.
Peter frowns, for a moment wondering how late it is. When he looks at the clock, he sees that it’s one in the morning. How did Harry even get in?
As if on cue, Steve suddenly storms out of the hallway, wearing an apron and holding an empty glass in his hands along with a towel.
“Lighten up, lover-boy,” Tony calls out, patting him once on the stomach, much to Steve’s surprise. “This is not to let people in, it’s just to get me out.”
For the entire evening, he’s swarmed by journalists, students working on school projects or volunteers who finally want to meet the son of Tony Stark. And it was scary at first, being in such a big spotlight without wearing a mask, but he figures he’s grown used to it rather quickly.
“Okay, cool!” the girl quickly grinned before running out of the class to gossip about it.
“Come with me for a second, Peter?” Mr. Stark asks, and Peter wants to laugh it out. For the entire week Peter has been working his ass off here at an internship he only got to be near this exact man, and now, after-hours, the guy just invites him up for, what? A drink? As if.
But Peter doesn’t take that lightly. He finally turns, and gets himself off the ledge. Then he points towards the boat. The whole scrap of useless junk.
“We are not here to hear your son’s resume, Stark. Get more interns, figure this shit out. We want to be able to offer more to the public during this year.” Brown-glasses turns to Pepper and gives her a nod while he piles his papers. “Let’s just conclude this meeting and go on with our days, shall we?”
Peter nodded. “So you’d rather not talk about it?”
bad in here.
Some odd smell filled her nose as soon as she opened the door of her apartment. Yaël couldn’t really place the scent, though.
“How about dangerous?” Ross counters. Wanda tilts her head to the side, Vision lowers his hand again. A sudden uncomfortable vibe goes through all of the Avengers at the mention of it, with the happenings in Lagos still too recent to really be discussed openly. And as Ross starts to go on about a group of enhanced people traveling everywhere while ignoring the rules of foreign borders, Steve finally starts moving. Tony sees him turning his head to the left to share a look with Sam. From the way his shoulders are tensed up, it’s clear that he’s feeling everything but comfortable. That tension doesn’t leave when Ross moves to the side to start up the screen behind him. Immediately, a map is shown.
Suddenly, the old man lit up and turned into glowing dust, flying towards the sea. Yaël’s mouth fell open, did that dude just die? How? Wait a minute, she didn’t see Loki using any tricks to make the old man turn to dust. Maybe this man hadn’t been human at all...  Was this the Odin Loki used to tell her about? He surely could be, Yaël thought, suddenly noticing how much Thor looked like him.
Tony rolls his eyes. He puts a hand behind Steve’s head, and looks him deeply into the eyes.
about Gwen. Visiting her grave has become a monthly activity instead of a weekly one, and it has been hurting less and less to talk to her. Despite that, it feels like his heart has been ripped out on the spot at the idea that Eddie seems to be blaming
- more in the end notes
“Any of the X-Men?” Ben asks. Ross shakes his head.
“What are you planning to do?” Yaël jumped, she hadn’t heard Charles coming in. Of course, that man immediately noticed she was thinking about doing something not that smart. Could she tell him the truth? Or would he warn Stark?
“Oh, honey, remember that one time when I took you to the arcade as a date?” Tony suddenly asks, pulling on Steve’s hand to get his attention. Steve quickly turns to him, nodding in agreement.
She dialed Fury’s number and started raging as soon as she heard the cracking of someone picking up.
Peter sighs, for a moment wishing he would just have gone to Paris with him. He misses hanging out with Harry lately. Not that Johnny isn’t good company, but there’s not really anybody there who knows him from since he was a kid. Harry knew Uncle Ben, talked to him. Harry even remembers Peter’s parents a little bit. The others only met him afterwards. They’re good friends, too, but sometimes, Peter just needs that piece of the past with him.
Feeling a bit perplexed, Yaël walked to Peter’s bedroom door and knocked on it.
Tony wins the first game, followed by Clint in the second and, much surprising, Scott in the third. After what must be an hour and half of playing, Tony leans back in his chair and throws his hands up while scraping the seat back.
As soon as Yaël walked outside, a loud siren went off and red light started flashing around the building.
The guy’s voice suddenly changes mid-sentence, and Peter actually looks to the side to see the man’s face shift into someone else’s as he pulls of what seems like some sort of mask. The guy then pulls off the dark-blonde wig he was wearing, turning towards Peter to give him a smile.
“We’re off to school,” the girl says cheerfully, waving at Tony before Peter pulls her through the door. Tony barely even has time to wave back, too confused about everything that’s happened so far.
But then he surprises everyone by shaking his head.
Without thinking further of it, Tony opens up the journal and starts going through it. He realizes quickly that, once again, this one is dated way too early. He puts it aside and reaches for the next one. By the time Steve returns, Tony already discarded five journals. It seems like Mary really had a lot to write down. When he has time, he’d love to read through them if Peter’s okay with that, but now he just doesn’t have that time.
“Sorry, shouldn’t have said that,” she mutters. “But c’mon Steve, I can’t let Peter go there alone! Can’t you see how nervous he is?”
The two kids nod, Andrew still with the top of his hand rubbing over his face. Peter passes a hand through his hair to comfort him a bit. After that, he gets to work. He guides Toby at the window, helps him over it. Then with the web stuck to the kid’s arms, Peter slowly but surely lowers him down until he’s on the ground. In the background, he can see a woman shout in relief. She, while carrying another baby in her arms, starts making her way to the boy.
“How do I look?” Yaël replied.
Yaël and Wanda were playing checkers while Peter and Wade were looking at Wade’s suit. According to Peter, Wade’s Deadpool-suit wasn’t very complicated, but it was made of excellent materials.
But Peter knows he can’t do that; if Mr. Stark would go to Dr. Cho about it, she would recognize Peter’s altered blood immediately. Other doctors would be fascinated by it, and research it further. They would know that Peter isn’t exactly a hundred percent human, but slightly spider as well. He can’t have the secret spreading further.
“That sucks,” Yaël mutters out. Peter snorts.
Sitting at detention, Peter has his arms crossed in front of him and his head resting on the desk as he waits for the hour to pass. His homework is already finished, and his newspaper is read through completely.
“I didn’t know,” Toomes stammers out. Steve decides to be nice and loosens the grip on the wrist slightly.
“I’ll have a talk with the principal, maybe get his teachers to give him some extra work he can make while he’s at home,” Tony suggests, only to receive a long look from May. When he notices, he frowns for a moment, wondering if he did something wrong?
“This wasn’t his idea, Yaël. The UN made this decision.”
“But what if they won’t take me seriously anymore after this?” Peter asks. “They barely even know me…”
“You’re frowning, that doesn’t look pretty on you,” the man mumbled nonchalant while still hanging in the chair.
That morning, when Johnny asks Peter if he’s finally together with MJ, he finally says ‘yes’.
“Yeah, Peter’s set-up needs a little bit more preparation,” Chrissy explains, handing both Steve and Tony a bottle of water. “By the way, thank you for the picture!”
“We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center instead of a Wakandan prison.”
! You really couldn’t convince Harry to move in with you?” Tony continues, taking one of Peter’s sweaters out of the closet and adding it to the pile.
“Holy shit, it actually worked!” Tony mutters out.
“Uh, I don’t really know what
“Oh, what’s wrong, dear søster?” Nilla sounded even more crazy than before. Her wide grin didn’t help. But Yaël kept her arms crossed and leaned against the wall behind her.
Steve sighs next to him. “Right, I’m sorry,” he mutters, rubbing his forehead. “Normally, Stark and I get into each other’s hairs in just a matter of minutes… I guess it’s just a reflex.”
“Why are you sorry?” he asks. He pulls up the covers and throws them over Steve.
“What’s, uh… what…” he can’t get his words out, mouth too dry. The nurse hands him a cup of water and slowly lets him drink from it.
Fuck, it was even worse to know it was true!
“Excuse me, but talk to my son
“Eh, I’ve seen some horrible things in life. I’m sure this isn’t going to top that,” Clint disagrees. “If you’re all too chicken, I can just tell you the result in the end?”
? An instruction of Mr. Stark to just
“Peter, you better start dialing it down, or-“
“Yet the Vulture still managed to break into your quinjet?” Steve counters, unimpressed. Tony gives him a glare before rolling his eyes.
Followed by a street name and number. She didn’t notice all the spelling mistakes, as she was wasted herself. This was genius, she was still pissed off at him. She was so going to join him at this party, to tell him her thoughts about him and to run away before Charles was able to send someone to check on her. Who knows how long Peter had been laughing with her ignorance. He didn’t like her, she didn’t doubt that anymore. Who would like the girl that destroyed the city?
“Will do.”
“Stay safe, and good luck with that guy,” he jokes, though he’s only wishing himself luck with that. MJ winks at him.
“Please, your majesty. Tony will be fine,” Tony assures him. T’Challa laughs and then lets go to point towards a car.
“Shit, I love you so fucking much,” Tony says in return.
“Star Wars!”
all day, but to be honest – after the Lizard and Electro – Peter knows he can do more. Stopping a robbery might just be the thing that will make his Dad understand that he can do so much more.
I don't know"
“He’ll become the greatest hero I’ll ever know,” he then says truthfully, taking out his phone again to show her a picture of Spider-Man, followed by one with him wearing the suit but without the mask, standing next to Steve in his uniform. Mary falls quiet after that. A heavy breath escapes Tony’s lungs. He looks down at the brown couch, eyes going over the flowery pattern underneath him. On the table a bit further away are some magazines. One of them shows Tony’s face in a rather unfortunate picture as he was spotted drunk in public. He clears his throat and looks away quickly.
“You can help by getting your ass back home, young man!” Tony shouts at him before realizing it. Peter throws his hands up in the air.
“Oh, crap! I knew I shouldn’t have partied with Wade last night,” she mutters. Steve chuckles, then. “How long have you been here, by the way?” she then asks the other man, who in turn shrugs in response.
We know we messed a bit with canon here; we just didn't really like the idea of Clint abandoning his family to do some hero-work, but at the same time we really wanted him in the story more. We talked about it for a while, and agreed that, in here Clint never married Laura. Not that we dislike her character or their kids, but it just didn't feel right in the story.
“Thor late!” Hulk  grumbled.
“Had a misunderstanding in the past. He wanted something from me that I couldn’t give, and he took it personally,” Peter tries to keep it simple, but it hurts to just talk about it like this. Like Gwen’s… like it had just been an accident and not an attempt of Harry – The Goblin to get even.
“Well, okay, the tritium is alarmingly enough. I’ll, uh… I’ll give Dr. Octavius a call. Can you maybe give me some description of what the girl looked like?”
Tony turns back to Bruce, noticing only then that his own eyes are stinging. He wipes away a few tears and nods.
So after waking up too early and spending the entire day at the zoo trying to avoid the press and camera’s, Steve even came up with the bright idea to get dinner at a restaurant, to really spend the whole day together before Peter and MJ come to pick up their daughter again.
“No, it’s fine. It’s not like they can stop the aging process, right?”
“I still don’t understand why I can’t join. I’ve been a founding member of the Avengers!” Tony complains, not really
So, yeah, apparently he’s Liz’ father. Who knew?
The ultimate suit, the best of the best. That’s what he’s going to make here. And he
After confirming to her question on whether or not he’s coming for dinner in twenty minutes, Peter hides away in his room. His eyes are still stinging, and his throat is still burning.
“But we have the official documents and the DNA-tests?” Peter tries. Pepper shakes her head.
“Try asking me out next week. Maybe then I’ll say yes!”
“I- uh…” Steve mutters out, but then he shakes his head and follows after Tony. Whatever they say next, Peter has no clue. He’s just wondering what is going to happen here. Is he getting thrown out as Tony and Steve go hang out? Or is he allowed to go with them? Does he even want to go with them?
So Yaël explained to him that she was still trying to figure out how to make some sort of battle team or army out of her own powers. Of course, this time she didn’t waste herself completely in her training.  After that, Charles had to go to a meeting, so they said goodbye. They’d see or hear each other the next day anyways.
He’s not even halfway when he hears some cracking underneath his feet. A quick look down, he sees that it’s glass. There’s some liquid on the ground as well. The shards on the floor seem like… did somebody drop a bottle?
“Never mind! I know when I’m not wanted!” Tony eventually calls out, throwing his hand over his forehead. Peter rolls his eyes but still manages to smirk. The fact he’s joking around like this means that he must be doing better, right?
Dropping the keys in their designated spot, Steve shrugs off his coat and hangs it up on the coat rack. Meanwhile, Tony kicks off his shoes and heads for the kitchen, remembering that’s the last place he saw his glasses.
Chapter warnings in end notes
“PETER, IF YOU’RE THERE, HURRY BACK! STRANGE CAN’T KEEP THE PORTAL OPEN FOR MUCH LONGER!”
! No wonder they let us go!”
Great, so even her eye-color was a punishment. Who would think about that?
“Honey, you sure you’re alright?” Tony asks, sitting up for a bit. Peter stops in his tracks, putting a hand against the wall while the other reaches for his chest. His dull eyes turn to look at the two, though Tony’s not sure he can actually see them.
boyfriend when all the trouble has blown over, prints out t-shirts and makes them wear it when they go jogging the following week. With this, he stands corrected.)
“It’s mom’s journals, about the time she got to meet dad. Did you know that she and Mr. Stark were good friends?” Aunt May’s eyes open wide and she grabs the journal out of his hands to take a look at it herself.
Mary sobs a bit as she lowers the picture again. Then she rubs her eyes and looks away from the camera.
Whatever, coffee first, questions later.
“That’s the problem now, isn’t it?” Tony asks. Then, at last, he looks up. He gently removes Steve’s hands from his shoulders. Then he puts some distance between the two of them.
“Experimental training,” the Cat responds. When there’s suddenly a sharp sting in Peter’s legs, he lets go of the chokehold. The Cat gasps for breath before getting back on her feet, holding up her hands in very loose fists. “You have a girlfriend?”
them to catch you? You
He takes a deep breath.
But he isn’t moving at all. Tony gives him a long look before going to the nightstand, and grabbing the monstrous flip-phone to check on the caller.
“I don’t know what I was expecting, but I guess I shouldn’t be surprised,” she says lowly. Then, giving the Cat a murdering look, she turns around, heading back into the hallway that leads to the living room. Peter jumps up on his feet, feeling the Cat’s hands grab his arm.
Peter hums in understanding, looking back to the city and taking in all the lights. Each of them is a family, spending the evening together. Or a lonely person, probably curled up behind the TV. Or those individuals that are currently working, much like aunt May right now.
rebellious years. He remembers driving it all around town, picking up girls and impressing his friends. He wonders what became of that bike, not even remembering if he ever sold it or anything. Probably his father got rid of it while Tony was partying all night long.
“I mean, yeah! It was great being with her but now I’m reminded of how much I’ve missed being single and free again.” Harry lets out a laugh. “And the great thing; I don’t think it’ll be awkward being around her! We’re still friends. Proves how much in love we were, right?”
“But Mc Dreamy-“
“But an old man you love, right?”
As Peter sneaks into the bank, he quickly sees that the gadgets they’re using are
were to give Peter a
“Yes, what do you count in otherwise?” Raido asked him a bit sourly. It was obvious he didn’t like Yaël’s new friend.
Yaël never took her sandwich, she just turned around and ran out of the bar. She ran and kept running, she sprinted until she noticed a liquor store.
“Well, I don’t know… For now, I’d rather he didn’t know, but on the other hand I really
Hilde turned to the window and was quiet for a moment, sunken in her own thoughts and memories. “You know, it really saddens me to hear she passed away… I liked her a lot, she was a good friend of mine and was one of the last of us,” And with that, she poured down the rest of the bottle and gave Yaël another bottle to drink together.
As her hand reached the handle, she heard her sister mumble: “Just like mom…” Yaël quickly faced back to her sister while her hand was still resting on the handle.
Peter chuckles a bit, though keeping his eyes closed. He realizes he’s dressed in nothing but his underwear, but he doesn’t care. The suit is gone, and he feels like this dark cloud has been removed from his head. He’s no longer in conflict with himself.
“GUYS! STOP FIGHTING!” Peter throws in. When both Tony and Steve turn to look at him, Peter points towards Mordo, who is looking furious.
“I would love to,” he admits. Tony can feel his relieved breath on his skin. Automatically, he leans forward to steal a kiss, and instead of pulling away, Steve joins him. Lips pressed together, Steve still manages to speak when they part for those few milliseconds at a time. “We’ll start tomorrow, right? I just… I’ve missed you so much these past weeks and I really need you close now.”
Flash runs away from his post at the DJ-panel and runs up to Peter (or Spider-Man, more) and engulfs him in a strong hug. The stench of alcohol is strong on him.
“Hey, FRIDAY, is Vision here today?” Peter asks, knowing that FRIDAY is still linked up here.
“Yeah, I remember,” May returns, shuddering at the thought. She drops her bag at the nurse’s station and grabs a paper with the list of patients. Indeed, besides the new names that weren’t there before she left for the weekend, the still familiar name of ‘Otto Octavius’ is still written out neatly. “I can’t imagine how it’ll be for him to wake up,” she admits.
With a frown, he leans towards opened the FedEx-package, giving it a quick look and seeing that it’s addressed to Tony – taking aside the fact that Steve managed to make his ‘r’ look like an ‘n’ in his haste of writing. There’s an old, black phone inside of it, along with a letter with Tony’s name is written on. Peter frowns. Why is this here?
“Hilde went back to Asgard, didn’t she?” Peter asks, suddenly reminded of it. Steve nods.
“It’s alright, Peter. We can just be friends,” Felicia admits with a smile. Then she takes Peter’s arm and crosses hers with it. Starting up the pace again, Peter finds that Felicia seems to have a lot to talk about. She rattles on about the movies, some hot celebrities and so forth.
“He sounds confused, mostly,” Steve explains. “I can’t just stay here, guys.”
- sleepwalking
Spider-Man’s chest goes up when he breathes in, and then he pushes himself forward. Miles holds out his hand in a gesture to help it out. When Spidey sees it he nods at him and takes the help to get himself back on his feet.
“Actually, I would be very interested in reading those. It’s really fascinating. Does your strength come close to Steve’s?”
And Peter keeps on playing. FRIDAY, nor Karen, pass along any messages coming from Tony or Steve. Last weekend he went to see Aunt May, but she’s on leave right now, having followed Rhodey to Wakanda to guide him through his rehabilitation. Peter would have joined them on any other moment, but when May came to pass along the message, all he felt was relief.
“Ah, I’m an era older than you, cub!”
“Good, I love to play games. See you later, Yaël. Maybe then, I’ll be wearing your friends’ skins as a jacket.”
Peter turns towards Natasha, who nods.
And when Steve comes up on the screen along with all the other Avengers, shaking the host’s hand, he smiles. He can’t not; Steve is just too perfect.
Finding himself back in the tower with a hyperactive kid crawling around in the penthouse, Tony finds himself staring at his now eight-month-old-son along with Bruce, who seems interested in it all, too. It’s lucky, really, that he didn’t join in on the mission to Paris.
“You mean that guy you keep talking about? ‘He just never wants to join me! Why wouldn’t Peter come along?’ I tell you, man, it’s almost like this guy is actually secretly in love with you or something,” Davey slurs out, not even trying to be quiet about it. Johnny rolls his eyes again, pushing Davey even more to the side.
“He looks classy,” Tony mutters back at him, eyes stuck on the people at the front.
“My name is Peter,” he tells her, allowing the woman to put the palm of her hand onto his cheek. Automatically, he leans into the touch. Tony knows how that feels. Silently, he puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder. “I’m his son.”
“You’ve got to be kidding me, mom!” Peter calls out in annoyance, sitting in the park after getting the booklet back and taking his time to go through it again. He drops the journal down on the grass and leans his head back against the tree he was sitting in front of. Talk about cliffhangers, for crying out loud.
“We can go and warn Xandar and the Collector if it’s not too late,” Quill offers. Everybody nods, though nobody’s sure what the chances are that Thanos won’t have already been there. “Maybe we can try and use the orb like last time?”
“There hasn’t been a fight in Midtown today?” she admits. “Do you need me to call you a ride home perhaps?”
“Pretty impressive, Mr. Parker,” Mr. Stark says, pulling the bracelet off again before handing it back to Peter. “How long did it take you to make these?”
Hilde smiles despite her constant tough act. It’s obvious she’s containing most of her enthusiasm, keeping her distance from the group.
Once Mr. Delmar and his cat are out, Peter quickly coms to the realization that they’ve escaped. While still holding the cat, he hunches his shoulders a bit and sighs.
Peter’s heart jumps when he hears his name. With lots of hesitation inside of him but without showing it, Peter puts his stuff back into his bag and closes it before following the woman – he doesn’t even know her name – out of the detention room. The hallways are empty now; everybody is already back at home or still on their way.
“So, are you coming or what?”
“What happened to the Library-guards?” the other guard asked suspiciously. Yaël simply let her finger glide against her throat.
“No way, he’d freak! I think he’d already freak to find out he’s got a son, let alone to have said son fighting battles every day to keep New York safe.”
Thor gets married, and everybody is there to celebrate it with him!
," Steve had said. Peter had snorted.
“Something has happened to Peter,” Tony starts. Carefully, he explains everything he can to the woman, not even bothering to hide away the fact that a black Spider-Man suit is a part of it. She doesn’t ask about it, either, so it’s possible that she might have actually known. That, or she rather asks it in person.
“You know, at least we used protection,” she says dryly, swinging the thing in her hand around a bit before throwing it into the bin. Peter, once again, groans and throws his head back.
When she woke up again, the whole arena was filled with blood. The dust colored red and the walls had big spats on them. There was nothing left from the man that had been holding her head. Yaël felt like she had to puke, but she didn’t even get the chance. The audience, that had been quiet for a little, suddenly burst into screams and applause. They seemed to be happy with the result. Their noise drummed into Yaël’s ears.
"Uh, no, Polaroid is a brand. Besides, it's outdated as well," Tony mutters, sticking out his tongue when he tries to put two small wires together. He jumps back when it suddenly sparks. "That's not supposed to do that."
“We’ll see each other soon,” Mr. Stark says. When somebody knocks on the door, the man lets go of Peter’s hand and takes a step back. “Yes?”
He hears Steve sigh on the other side of the line. “
“Neither are a match. But we’re looking.”
“Uh, we’re losing time here? Cap, get dressed and I’ll fly you out there.”
“You’ve never been one to stay quiet, have you?” Steve asks jokingly. Tony sighs, nodding in agreement.
“Get inside!”
“Yeah, no shit, if you slip out that small bit about having a teenager in the house. No wonder they’re trying to get some bit of information.”
“You’re welcome,” he whispered out, feeling tired again all of the sudden. With a heavy breath, he closed his eyes, allowing his body to take all of his energy to heal him. He would be feeling better when he woke up again.
Tony rolls his eyes, looking up at Todd, or Ron, or whatever his name is. He’s a greasy little guy with half his black hair missing and extremely light blue eyes that makes Tony wonder if he’s just wearing contacts.
“But you’re a Stark, aren’t you! And you eff-in’ Starks seem to be really talented in freaking people out! What you said, was not cool, Peter!”
Something on the desk buzzed, so Yaël looked up and saw the screen of her phone turn on. Oh, someone texted her! She gratefully grabbed the device, thanking god for the distraction from the frustrated sounds Logan was making while aggressively drawing a flower. But as soon as Yaël read who send the text, she wanted to put her phone back.
Peter raises his head again. Does he look that tired?
“You look amazing,” he says, taking her hand and squeezing it shortly before letting go of it again. After that, he hurries in Tony’s direction. Once Loki starts speaking, Stephen gets up and starts heading back to where Wong is. Meanwhile, Bruce stays seated on the chair next to Tony’s. Steve goes to sit on his other side, kissing Tony’s cheek as a greeting.
Tony takes advantage of the opportunity to drink some of his water. Mary, who now has her hands on her legs and is staring at them intensely seems shocked. It’s probably too much information at once. Tony feels a bit bad for her that he has to tell her like this, but he can’t waste too much time here. He has no idea what exactly is going on in the present right now…
“If she loves you, she’ll understand,” Steve assured him, unknowingly holding out his hand until it was resting on Tony’s lower arm. Then the two men looked at it, staring right where their skins were touching. It lasted for a few seconds before Steve realized what he was doing, and he pulled back. “Sorry, still a bit groggy,” he lied.
I know nothing about engineering. My knowlegde mostly just goes to music and hospitals, and what I know about technology is limited to how not to break my computer. That said, I did all the research I could on Arc Reactor technology, and I didn't understand a single thing of whatever speculation was put online about it - since it literally DOESN'T exist, I didn't have much to go on. So I'm keeping the engineering scenes conciously vague on this matter.
FRIDAY is desperately trying to tell him something. Tony’s answer is automatic. Before he knows it, he’s punching back. Barnes is on the ground; who is he fighting with?
“Son, you don’t need a suit to make you stronger,” Tony mutters. “I thought you knew that since the whole Vulture-stuff?”
Natasha Romanoff is not the stoic person everybody thinks she is. Once in a while, she can make jokes, lighten the mood. She can laugh, have fun. It’s not like she’s been traumatized by her past, after all.
“Just leave it there, it’ll be taken care off tomorrow,” Tony assures him, but Steve shakes his head.
admits that he’s wrong.
“Idiot,” he responds. Peter snorts out a laugh but he, too, starts filling his plate. “Good morning, Peter.”
Then Tony puts a hand behind Peter’s shoulder and pulls him along into a slow walk.
Now where can the dude be hiding?
“You know you don’t need our permission. You come and go as you please,” MJ reminds him with a wink. Miles chuckles before grabbing his bag from the ground and heading towards the exit. As he nears the door, he sees it open, watching Mr. Li walking in in that usual suit of his.
“Uh, sure thing,” Peter responds. He waits for Steve to close the door again before he puts his head on his knees. He knows he’s going to get it now. With Tony’s constant fear over Peter getting hurt, he’s sure he’s going to get another speech from him, about him being uncareful.
“Yeah, I’d like that,” Steve returns. They pull out of their embrace, hands linked together. In just a matter of seconds, they’re back out in the hallway. They haven’t had breakfast yet – maybe they shouldn’t have put on their gowns, already? – and Steve has to admit that he’s feeling quite hungry. Arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulder, the two walk towards where they remember Peter’s room being.
Steve listens again, not knowing where this anger keeps on coming from. He’s never reacted this strongly to anything. But, at the same time, the idea of anybody hurting Peter… it makes Steve feel like he’s ready for murder. That’s not really okay…
“You recognize her, don’t you? She’s been in SHIELD’s custody for a while before. How she got on the ship is unclear since last we knew she was still on Earth.”
“Oh, jeez, Wade, please shut up for a second,” Yaël opened her eyes and turned to him with a wide grin. Next to her bed, professor X sighed.
“And that’s enough from you, drunk bastard,” Johnny returns. Peter doesn’t spend too much attention to it. Instead he takes a few steps to the side where he fishes out two beer bottles out of a cooler. Opening them, he hands one to Johnny.
“Honey, if not for these, you wouldn’t be here,” Tony counters. “I’m trying to… what do you call it? That’s an olive branch. Is that what you call it?” He sits down on a chair, a good distance away from Steve, but still close enough to be able to touch him if he would just reach out. He forces a smile on his lips, but he doesn’t really mean it, feeling his chest ache from everywhere just by looking at Steve.
Of course, the toys
FINALLY! “Steve! Shit, hi! Help! I just came home and there were shards everywhere and-“
Loki looked over his shoulder and sighed.
“Sei un fottuto stronzo,” Tony mutters at him. MJ snorts while all the others look at the man in confusion.
And she’s the one who ended up under the ground.
The spot where he and Steve had been standing before Tony pushed him aside is covered with rock-pieces, parts of the wall that has apparently been blown up. The little space they’re currently underneath… it looks like multiple parts of the wall collapsed. It doesn’t look stable, trying to shift it away could kill them instantly.
“Let’s take a walk, shall we?” Jason whispered, pulling her out of her admiration for his hair.
- Civil War but more from Peter's POV
Yaël thought. She remembered them chilling together in a sofa, just reading a bit. And him telling her she should eat more vegetables. She also remembered wandering around between some trees, fiddling with some leaves, as he passed her twenty times during his morning-jog. She also thought back about a small argument they had about one of his friends she had slept with. What was his name again... ?
Tony shrugs. “I just… I don’t want you to take care of him out of some sense of duty towards me,” he admits.
Her whole body stung and for a split-second, her whole vision went black. Luckily it came back right in time to steer away another fireball. With a hiss, Yaël stomped her foot against the ground, causing the concrete to sink Nilla’s feet in it and make her stuck. Nilla screamed out of frustration and fired the fireballs more and more quickly. Yaël send them back, but it took her a lot of effort to keep in focusing. A few of them, as she wasn’t always fast enough, burned her hands and her fingertips. Sometimes they even got to her stomach.
Peter who is looking at him groggily, held up by May who seems confused at what’s going on.
“And the Avengers?” Peter asks.
“I’m actually rather surprised it’s so calm right now,” she admits. Peter looks down at the suit, only realizing it now, really. But he can feel it, somehow… In a way. He can’t explain how it’s possible.
“I know that. I’m glad to be here, too,” Steve returns.
“Of course,” Steve says before Tony could even say what he means. “I’ll get his stuff. You need anything else?”
“You’re going to give your old man a heart-attack one day, Petey.”
“Don’t you ever dare to do that again…” he said softly.  She had no answers, she could only clench onto him as she felt like she was breaking down. “I was afraid you were going back into…the disease you had last time.”
With elegance she neared the lobby. The young boy that was typing vividly behind his laptop looked up when Yaël scraped her throat.
“I didn’t know back then that she peed on it.” Peter sighs before looking back at Tony. “Thanks for being honest with me, Dad.”
But then he disappears again, seemingly dissolving in a light blue smoke. Tony gapes at it with an open mouth, but then he clears his throat and blinks a few times. Surely, Steve will be back, he won’t just leave like that. Tony moves forward, reaching for another star. This time, he puts the little thing against his lips, suddenly feeling the need to give it comfort, to watch over it. He’s feeling very protective over this particular little star that he doesn’t really want to let go of it, either.
“I think you heard what I said. Or are you hard of hearing? I mean, I could try shouting it if you want?”
He can’t do it to this Tony. He holds up his ‘I’m fine-‘mask, but Peter has learned to read through it. He can see immediately that this Tony’s not doing fine. This is a Tony who still has alcohol on the table. A Tony who has this haunted look in his eyes, his shoulders sagged, his messy workspace… This is not a Tony that needs even more bad news.
“No, what did he say?” she gets out with a lot of effort.
"What counts is that you don't get shot at," Tony returns. "Besides, we pulled the names out of a goblet. Fate put the teams together."
Now, New York traffic isn’t at all made for a car chase. While Ned seems to find all the thrilling, exciting aspects of this whole business, Peter is fearing for his life with his phone pressed between his ear and shoulder as he dodges a bus. He’s breaking countless of traffic laws, but it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t even matter to him if he’s going to be in trouble again after this. He’ll sign those damn accords, for what it matters. He just needs to stop this guy, once and for all.
“Oh, you know, just interested about my best friend, is all,” Steve says casually. Even Peter can see the lifted brow from Natasha. “And I might probably just get you back for that time you tried to play matchmaker back at SHIELD?”
Aside for, maybe, the Iron Man and the Avengers-part.
Once Steve has reached Tony, the engineer can clearly see Steve’s cheeks redden from the admission. Tony tries to wave it off while chuckling.
“Dad, we got trouble! Liz’ dad is the Vulture-guy, and he threatened to kill me and everybody if I didn’t leave him alone, but he’s going after your plane loaded with all the Avengers-stuff that you were going to move so I have to stop him and-“
Okay, maybe that’s harsh. His mother did care. His father, in a way, did too. But… for a long time, Tony believed that carrying the name ‘Stark’ was meant for being incapable of love. Or… no, we’re explaining it wrong.
Because, to be fair, this room
Warnings:
Here comes the first official appearance of our original character, Yaël. She's a character created for the story we were originally writing. But as we were writing, inspiration came for a tie-in story about Peter. The two stories will be connected, but you don't particularly have to read one to understand the other (would be difficult, since we're still busy with writing the other story and it hasn't been posted anywhere yet).
“Uhm, it wasn’t, but I suppose I forgot to mention that as well,” she utters out. Tony gives her an unimpressed look and Pepper stops breathing for a second before rolling her eyes. “He asked me while we were cooking, both of us covered in tomato juice because we’re both not very good cooks. It wasn’t anything as spectacular as I suspect you would have done.”
“Tony, we’ve been arguing for hours. Can’t we just put this behind us and focus on the mission?” Steve tries.
“FRI, sweety, you’re so getting a raise,” Tony mutters.
“But wait, shouldn’t he have been vaccinated for it? Before he left?”
Okay! That's enough! God knows what the hell you're doing and where you are.
“Iron Daddy and his Wonderteam showed up to save the day!” Wade chattered happily, his eyes glued to the TV-screen.
“Steve, without you there’s no team. You’re the leader,” Tony counters. Steve just shrugs.
“Thanks pal, I should be on my way again,” the guy says, though he’s still hunched forward like he’s in pain.
Peter nodded.
“Oh, crap. I remember, taxi-drivers are crazy here,” Yaël mutters. Peter snorts.
dressed very soon.
? That’s rich, coming from you. After all, you’re the one who ran out on us, isn’t it?”
"This is a post-it note with my name on it," Steve states after that. Tony grins again, wiggling his eyebrows with a playful smirk. Steve's face turns bright red again after that. Peter feels shivers go through his entire body.
“In some cases, acute liver failure is treated without the need for transplant. In most cases, though, transplant
hidden from view from now on. Quickly he runs down the street, headed to the house that hosted the party. The fact that he can’t hear the music from the outside means that they must have put down the volume a bit. Peter knocks the door, not expecting an answer.
She’s right. Dick leaves quite a mess in his workspace, but Tony figures he’s quite the same on that part. It takes them about ten minutes to locate the set. There are needles, more vials, a clamping band and many more stuff.
“They’ll be back before you know it,” Harry assures him.
Did the guy actually even specifically say that he had the hots for her?
Peter doesn’t know why; he’s an outsider, nobody they know. How is it that they take him in so easily?
Steve gets a seat at another table, his chair next to Sam’s. The guard releases his right hand, but binds his left one to the chair. Sam looks at it disapprovingly, but nobody comments on it. Rhodey takes careful steps until he’s seated behind Tony. Next to him, Sharon starts making her way. Peter wonders why she’s here, since she’s not exactly enhanced? But, on the other hand, she’s also part of a secret organization that works with superheroes. She might as well be here.
“I’m fine,” he assures him. “As long as I have you, Peter and my friends I have everything I need.” He gives Steve a smile, puts his head against Steve’s shoulder and then pulls him towards the door opening. Sure this sucks, but he’ll bite through this. At least for now.
Tony shushes her, unable to concentrate with her talking like this. He just needs to find a connection with the network and after that things should be fine. He grits his teeth together in annoyance.
“That doesn’t look good?” Ned mutters. Michelle snorts before pulling up a French fry and dipping it in.
closely before you got all
A star-shaped tattoo, on his left wrist.
“No! What happened? I’m so sorry, Peter!” Harry says reaching out to him. Peter wants to say it’s his own fault, that he should have kept Gwen out of the Spider-Man business. But then he realizes Harry doesn’t remember. He doesn’t know about Peter being Spider-Man.
Steve lets go of him almost immediately after that. “Right, you should go.”
Chapter warnings:
“Language!” Steve hisses, tapping Tony on the head. Tony rolls his eyes.
So, my early christmas present to you: A chapter a day ^^ The waiting is over, here you'll have the whole thing in the following two weeks!
“Steve, I’m Spider-Man! I’m Spider-Man!” Peter almost shouts. On the other side, he can hear Ned instructing him to go right, so he listens. “And I’m in pursuit. I can do this, but I can’t be too late!”
Sure, Uncle Aaron has done some dumb stuff in the past, but he’s all changed now. Miles is sure of it.
“Sorry, man, I don’t know who that is,” Yaël tells him suddenly after finishing his story. If Peter would ever have the biggest shock of them all, this would be it. Tony Stark is one of the most famous people in the entire world, firstly because of his company but his popularity grew even more after revealing that he’s Iron Man! How could one
“And what about next week? Am I still on the schedule with Stark?” Yaël didn’t really see why Steve would put him on her schedule, unless he wants them to become friends or something. Because fighting and cursing at each other while bathing in sweat would stabilize their friendship, right? Idiot.
By the time he’s grabbed her hands to stop her, her lips are already pressed against his. She kisses him with heat, some sort of desire he can’t really understand. They barely know each other, and Peter’s never been one to just hook up with strangers unlike some of his peers (Johnny). Still, there’s a thrill going through him. His heart speeds up, feeling as if it’s about to jump out of his chest. Nothing inside of him tells him to pull away.
Feeling a strong urge to smash his head against the wall, Peter turns around in the bed until his face is pressed into the pillow. He lets out a frustrated shout, hating the way his head is working in the past few days. Weeks. Months.
Guess what: I'm sick AGAIN. I hate having colds... :'( Anyway, here's the next chapter
date, even!” Natasha just smirks at him. Sam and Rhodey look behind them towards Tony, both frowning.
“We’re doing great, thank you for asking,” LL returns with a chuckle. “So, uh, let’s not waste too much time, shall we? Cap, Peter, will you join me on the VIP deck for a little bit while Tony gets ready for his stuff?”
Tony shifts his head to the side slightly, until his lips are pressed against Steve’s. It’s not long, not longer than a second. After that, he’s looking back at his tablet. From what Tony can see, he’s looking over some sort of security footage. He wonders why Tony’s not watching that inside his own mind, but he figures he could ask and only get an explanation that he won’t understand. No, it’s better not to ask.
to know, just so he can settle his heart a little bit.
“What are you going to do?” Yaël grumbled.
“Good lord…”
- Let's just say Tony can handle a lot, but even ON medication he has his limits
FRIDAY tries to get him out. Peter ignores her.
When the fifth robber pulls out a device that brings over a massive shock wave over them, everything seems to break around them. Glass shatters, cars fly off the ground and actually crush a couple of agents to death. Peter is thrown back against a wall, quickly followed by Wanda. By the surprise, Vision, too, is blown away before he can protect Wanda.
“Oh, he was,” Michelle counters. She’s slowly walking up to him, her bag swinging over her shoulder. Her hair is messy as always, but Peter figures it’s just how she like to wear it. “But I could have stopped him easily.”
“Hey, I take that as an insult!” Wade shouted back. But Peter just ignored him with a hard face.
“Sorry! I couldn’t hold it back anymore!” Yaël answered over-dramatic. She forgot Peter for a second, who tried to get her attention, but she didn’t notice. “And the Winchesters are in trouble again…”
“Alright,” Harry returns. With his hands in his pockets, he walks beside Peter. They go on for a bit further until they get in the shopping district. It’s closed, of course, with it being evening. It’s dark out, the sun already low below the ground. It’s probably almost morning in New Asgard!
But that’s not a good idea. “He only just finished his latest edition of the Starkbucks. And before you mention the name, we all told him it wasn’t a good idea. He’s insistent.”
He’s not worried, because he timed it perfectly. In the corner of his eyes, with the limited sight he has left through his tears, he saw the three figures already nearing them. Which is why he took the chance to land that kick in the first place. That way, two can fly after the Goblin and hopefully
“It doesn’t matter,” Peter mutters, grabbing a white shirt and gently pulling it over his head. “By tomorrow they’ll mostly be gone anyway.”
Yaël woke up in her tent, which colored red by the sunlight… as usual. After wandering around in Oslo for a little while, she decided to buy a tent and some camping gear, so she’d be able to go wherever she wanted to. When she firstly arrived at the Lofoten Islands, she had cursed that poor life’s decision as the summer was the time of the year when the sun apparently didn’t go down around the Lofoten Islands. So the first few days, Yaël had to get used to fall asleep while the sunlight was still lightening her tent.
Should he ask Tony? Or maybe that’ll make the guy worry even more than before? It’s probably not such a good idea, after all. He might be getting a constant hovering Tony after that. Maybe a babysitter while Peter’s out on patrol. Nah, better to keep him in the dark.
“BONZAI!” Yaël thought she’d get a heart attack when Wade jumped from behind the sofa. She didn’t even get the time to think about how the heck he got in (afterwards she remembered he had made a spare key), before he pulled out something little from his pockets. That little thing happened to be a pull bomb.
Harry, on the other hand, while smart, also is lazy. Even when he was a kid he was always under the impression that he would succeed either way, mostly due to his father’s money. It seems like the habit stuck.
Peter nods eagerly before pulling away and lying down again. Then he grabs one of the books that must have been under his pillow, and he puts it into Tony’s hand.
Sam heads the others’ way, greeting Bruce and introducing himself to Brunnhilde. Before opening the door, Tony turns to Peter and Harry.
It takes another half hour for him to work on it. He feels sorry for Yaël, who’s still waiting for him downstairs. He’ll make it up to her, that he swears to himself. Eventually, after a lot of sweat and swearing, Peter manages to fix something together on the Arc Reactor. In any way, it starts glowing again in that bright blue color, meaning that at least he did
“You’re going to get it now,” he mutters. Tony turns around, clearing his throat, and waits for the woman who called after him to show herself.
“You put the gas open in my apartment!” Nilla’s smirk came back.
“Now, instead of asking me all these personal questions, just tell me what you need my help with.”
“Steve?” Tony breathes out, his voice suddenly cracking. Peter barely even reacts to it. Instead, he takes the moment of distraction as the exact thing he needs right now. He looks back at the window, figuring it might hurt a little bit. But it’s worth it. He takes a deep breath, waits for everybody to walk out a they search for Steve.
JARVIS stays quiet, which is fine enough. Tony scrapes his chair back, needing to stretch his legs. He takes a few steps towards the refrigerator where he takes out a bottle of water. He doesn’t tempt himself with the beer, knowing that if he starts again, he’s not going to be able to stop. He’s worked too hard, had too many therapy, to just start again like that.
“I, uh-“ Steve starts, but Peter holds up his hand to shut him up.
Peter and Harry give each other a look, figuring that they couldn’t know, of course.
Steve’s words keep on passing through Tony’s mind, no matter how much he tries to banish them out.
"How dare he?" he starts, putting a hand towards his mouth to empathize his shock. "
So that’s what Peter does. After school, he takes the cab to Stark Tower, going upstairs by the private elevator. He’s greeted by FRIDAY, and ends up spending the following ten minutes trying to pry Butterfingers, U and Dum-E off him. With the way they keep on greeting him, one would think he never spends any time with the two bots.
“I didn’t say you didn’t look good in it, though,” Jason threw her another smirk. The cheeky bastard! His smirks and flashes of arrogance kind of reminded her of…
“So, basically, I’m dying, aren’t I?” Peter asks seriously.
“As long as we can ship your ass all the way to Switzerland tomorrow, you can do whatever you want.”
Three hours into their date, they decide to head out. Tony pays the bill, guiding Steve out of the restaurant. After another short trip, Tony parks his car again in an empty parking lot. Before he can open up the door to help Steve out, the super soldier is already standing outside.
“Right,” Johnny returns, clearing his throat again. After a few more seconds of awkward silence – what is happening?! – Johnny pulls up another wide grin before grabbing Peter by the arm. “Oh, I can introduce you to some people I’ve been hanging out with! We can all hang out together!”
“Sure, thanks…” Yaël answered, then she turned to him. “Look, Vision, I would appreciate it a lot if you wouldn’t tell anyone about the wound. It would alarm them and that’s really not necessary.” He stared at her for a moment, then nodded, turned around and left her room again by going through the wall.
“I’ll go talk to him. But I’m glad you came, Tony,” Sharon says, quickly giving Tony a kiss on the cheek before turning to Peter. “And we’ll talk again, soon. I want to know everything about you.”
“Make it three,” he says shortly. Tony looks up shortly before nodding.
FRIDAY doesn’t answer, but Tony knows she’ll listen to him. That’s why she’s such a wonderful AI, after all. Tony quickly looks to the side to check the hour, finding that it’s almost eleven a.m., on a Monday. But that doesn’t mean much for traffic; it’s New York. There’s always traffic.
So Steve doesn’t say anything about it. It can’t be that bad that it’s a bit longer, right? Surely, Jane will enjoy every word of what Thor is talking about.
“The seconds. They remind me of the bell tower where Gwen-“ Peter starts, but he doesn’t finish the sentence. It’s probably clear enough, anyway. “I heard it ticking all the time, and it became too much.”
“No.”
“Look! I don’t know who you think Venom is, but it’s not me, alright?” Peter calls out, putting his hands on his chest. “I’m-“
Mrs. Thomas was sleeping against the opening of the elevator again. The woman had extremely long, black hair with a few grey locks here and there. She always wore glasses that were too big, looking like they might have been from the eighties. Yaël had never been able to put an age to that woman. She could be forty, but she also could be sixty. The woman didn't even move as Yaël passed, who decided to let her sleep. Mrs. Thomas clearly had a sleeping-problem.
“Exactly,” Loki finally turned around and walked down towards Yaël. “They are stuck on this spaceship, just like you and me. Yes, they are finally free, but they come from all different planets, some of those planets don’t even exist anymore. Many of them don’t have a family anymore. Besides, it’s not like I didn’t ask them.” He sounded a bit superciliously, as usual, while walking passed her.
“So, you’re hungover?” Yaël blinked a few times when she heard Peter’s voice, making a mental note she had to go to bed early that night.
“I’m glad I’m alright, too,” Peter admits with a joke. Pepper gives him another smile, and then looks up to Tony.
“Eddie, you can’t let him control you like this!”
“Anything triggered it, or…?” Harry asks vaguely. Peter panics, trying to think back about what they were talking about…
“YOU CAN’T KNOCK?! WHAT THE FUCK, CLINT!” Steve shouts. Tony snorts when he hears Steve curse for what must be the first time ever. When he gets a glare from Steve, he quickly pretends like he’s coughing, instead.
They don’t show it, never when there’s someone else around, but Peter knows what he saw. And he’s glad for it; because he knows this is something that might help Tony, a lot. They’ve all been sad for such a long time, but now they can start being happy again.
Shuri, who is by now back in Wakanda, says that she can try to help with it. Having brought a blood sample along before she returned home, she promised to every member of the Avengers that she would try to fix this. Tony can’t wait until she manages to find something.
“I’m not-“
Peter laughs when Johnny throws himself down on the couch after dropping his box on the table. The front door is still open, allowing for the others to come inside and carry more stuff Peter brought along.
Yaël turned the volume a bit down as the noise of her own yelling cut through her ears.
- Drunk people
“You could just follow Black Widow and take the stairs?” Peter suggests. The guy turns around to watch the door towards the stairwell, looking at it like it’s the first time he’s seen it. Then he shrugs shortly.
“Just sit down for a minute, Peter. I’ll get you a hot drink,” Mr. Stark says, pointing towards the couch before heading towards the kitchen. Peter would almost have expected Mr. Stark to have servants to do that for him, but he’s glad to see that Mr. Stark is pretty independent when it comes to that kind of thing.
“Your friends should know how you feel, Yaël.”
Peter doesn’t really know when it happens that a random girl takes him away. At one moment, they’re dancing together, and the other she drags him along to the stairs, pulling him inside a bedroom that clearly isn’t Flash’. A small part inside of Peter wonders if he should even be allowed in there, but the other part doesn’t care.
“Mr. Stark’s here?” Peter asks a little louder than he’d expected. His eyes are resting on the familiar figure standing in the hallway and currently talking to Cap. He’s a bit too far away to see it clearly, but he looks extremely tired. His hair’s messy, and the clothes he’s wearing look like he’s been sleeping in them.
“Oh, Peter! I was just going to say hello, see how you were doing? Johnny said you weren’t feeling too well?” she says. Peter takes in the bright blue eyes looking back at him. Just for a short second, he catches something weird about them. Like…
“We weren’t finished training,but… that doesn’t matter now,” Professor X turned his wheelchair towardsYaël “What does matter is that we can’t give you too much information about before you lost your memories. The doctors said that remembering things too quickly could cause trauma.”
“You. You survived that fall. That makes you quite a worthy candidate,” the woman said while walking around Yaël, looking at her from every angle. “You don’t have much muscle though, so they’ll probably put you in first rank or something.”
“Well, well, look who decided to finally show up!” she says. Then she turns towards the other woman, patting her on the shoulder. “I told you they’d beat the Guardians, Sif. Pay up.”
“The first one, I think, but all of that doesn’t matter. I don’t even get why she wants to use you instead of me. You aren’t even that powerful. Look at me, I’ve been training for eras!”  Nilla surely seemed frustrated. Only then it stroke what her little sister looked like. She went totally undercover, wearing some jeans and a comfortable, fluffy, blush-colored sweater. Nobody would think she’s an assassin with this ‘innocent’ look of hers. Her battle scars and muscles were all covered away, and she didn’t even wear the battle stripes on her face.
Oh great. As if his day hasn’t been crap enough already. Now he’s got the Goblin on his ass again.
But Peter… the thought that something would happen to Peter, AGAIN… Tony shudders in the bed. He turns on his back when the clock shows another minute has passed. He should probably continue on the new armor, but he can’t. Just getting out of bed is already the hardest task he can imagine today, so instead he just stays down, looking at the ceiling and resting his hand on his chest. When he catches himself rubbing his scar, he doesn’t even stop himself. After all, who is he hurting with it?
Chapter warnings
“Your Uncle never died, Peter. Though it was a close call. He got a heart-attack the day the police came to tell them you had died. It’s only lucky that he made it.”
Things were tense for a while. Tony had, of course, followed through on his promise to organize a celebratory party. It had been fun, and Steve hadn’t been able to relax that much in a long while. But after that, Ultron came.
The heart monitor beeps, but Tony doesn’t need to follow that to know how fast his heart is beating. 86 beats per minute. His breathing is to 16 per minute. His oxygen saturation in his blood is to a hundred percent. Blood pressure is thirteen over eight.
“If we can get a hold of Thor's Asgardian mead again, we could,” she offers. Then she walks towards a cabinet on the left side of the room, opening it up and taking four large bottles. “As it happens, I might have it here.”
“You’ve just died, Parker,” she whispers to him, pulling the trigger and getting the sucker planted on his skin. Holding on to him for just a little while longer, Natasha takes a few deep breaths, but eventually she does pull away. “Alright, exercise is over.”
The two laugh shortly. Peter lowers his shirt again before pulling the covers over them.
Peter goes to stand where Mr. Stark is pointing him to, and then he opens up his arms a little bit, biting his lip as he waits for what’s going to happen next.
It happens when they’re in the car, on their way to the mansion in Malibu, and Tony can’t seem to stop talking about this new, stronger magnet he made for Steve. Or the sketch he made of all the Avengers, and how he’s going to buy them from the guy and hang them up all over the tower.
that something happened; things feel a bit awkward here, somehow. Mr. Stark is incredibly quiet, and Aunt May seems to shoot quick glances at the man before focusing on Peter again.
Tony doesn’t want to keep secrets from Peter anymore. Nothing.
your father,” she says, not beating around the bush for it. Peter feels the air escaping from his lungs.
Steve clears his throat, pulling the glasses away from his face and toying with them nervously.
“Oh you got to be joking?” Peter mutters out. Laya, who passes him by with her own order, seems to have heard him.
Tony sighs.
Join him, as in, fighting against the other Avengers?
“You two had a fight?” Natasha asks. She comes to stand next to him and looks outside as well. By now, the whole window is filled with raindrops. Tony finds it calming himself, though the ache in his chest is not one that just goes away. The pain is also so completely different from the one he felt right after having the Arc Reactor placed; that one was constant, it hurts even to this day even now it’s gone.
Even after Harry’s asked the question, and though MJ hurried off right after she said ‘yes’, both Ned and Peter can’t but stare at their friend seated at their table with a surprised yet confused expression. After all; why
“I can’t help it, I’m not really one to like things everybody likes. Sheeran
“I found the pregnancy test in the trash and took it to school. When I later asked my teacher about it she told me what it was.”
“Yeah, well, uh, sadly, it seemed like as they were searching through the few historical artifacts they’ve managed to take along, one of them accidentally summoned multiple plagues on the city. Nothing too disastrous, nobody was going to die, but Thor wanted this solved before the wedding.”
“Their son is dead in this universe. I’m not going to break their hearts even more,” he admits. “I suppose we should get to Strange, get me back to my own world, huh?”
He can recognize more people from his class; there are Liz and her friends, a couple of other kids from the Decathlon-team – who would have thought that Flash would be a bit of a nerd himself? – and even Michelle is there, though she’s looking bored as hell. Those are about the only faces he can catch through the windows, but Peter is sure that, as soon as he gets inside, he’ll meet more of them.
Peter nods, not really thinking about how she can’t see him at all. Then he clears his throat. “Uh, yeah, uh, talk to me.”
This was no time for long introductions and telling each other about their lives, yet it was Brunhilde who frowned and said: “I feel like I’ve seen you before.”
“Wait, what the hell are you going to do with that?” Yaël nodded at the machine.
“JARVIS?”
“Aunt May?” Peter asks once he gets inside. He kicks the box into the hallway and starts taking off his shoes and jacket while he waits for an answer, but then he doesn’t get one. That’s okay, it can happen, it probably means she’s still running a few hours at the hospital.
“Listen, when he gets back in New York, just talk to him, alright?” Peter suggests. Tony shrugs, reaching out a hand and taking five of the waffles Peter is carrying along. Then he offers him a light smile.
“Wow, what?! He can’t fire you for being sick!” Peter sounded indignant.
Who could it possibly be?
“We both know he’ll be back,” he assures her. “So I probably heard wrong when Happy and Rhodey mentioned an Avengers-mission?”
“She’s fine,” he quickly assures him. “She’s confined to the compound, currently. Vision and Peter are keeping her company.” And to be honest, that’s her best-case scenario in any way. It was either this, or having her in custody, which Tony surely wouldn’t have wanted for her.
“So, uh, these accords. I heard you signed them, Vision?” Peter asks. Vision doesn’t move, keeping his eyes on the screen.
- Tony realizes things
“I like the feeling of cold tiles,” she replied instead, feeling dumb.
Seeing that Tony doesn’t want Peter near the boy, Steve had given him an alternative way on catching up. Knowing that he’s, for now, not allowed at the secluded ward, Peter hurries back to Steve’s office.
“What the hell is going on?” Bruce asks, seeming more confused than ever.
“Wait, he’s from another generation, as in, he’s younger than you?”
Tony snorts a bit. “Yeah, well… I was… discontent when the Avengers were back together and I gave myself a time-out. But, after Thanos… the things that have happened back there… Slowly I’d rather have nothing to do with it anymore, really.”
In just a matter of minutes he finishes the dishes, and then he takes a shower, glad that he doesn’t have to work today. He might as well just swing around New York for a while, take the journal with him and read a bit on a high rooftop. Could he even risk it reading on top of Avengers Tower?
Sharon takes the tablet from him as she pulls up video files of some of the rescues Yael has done in the past. There’s not a lot, and she’s never recognizable due to the outfit.
“My intern? I don’t have interns,” Tony mutters out.
“Ah, c’mon Mary, let’s just cut the crap and allow me to tell you why I’m here?”
“You coming in?” he asks. Peter shakes his head.
“I don’t know,” the man admits. Now that Tony’s really looking, he can see how tired Steve really is. His eyes drop shut every few seconds, and his hair is messy. He looks like he’s been here all night without taking a moment to rest. “The kid, Peter, I think he hacked FRIDAY or something. Suddenly she opened the door.”
“Tony? Where have you
Usually she’d just stare into the woods from her cage while the blonde man would just stare at her with his blue eyes. Why was it this time all so different?Yaël’s heart started to race even faster as she started to panic. Why the heck was she locked up like some kind of weird, wild lab-animal?
“Peter?” Tony asks in confusion. Peter holds up his hands questioningly.
“Three… this month. We’re only the tenth of September, Peter. In August alone you lost about seven bags! I know we’re rich, but if you keep going like this we’re going to run out of money eventually.”
MJ snorts again before standing up with her empty bowl. “I suppose I should get moving. I still have some homework to do. I’ll see you another time, perhaps?”
A short look at his hands, and he realizes he’s wearing the suit again. He can’t even remember putting it back on.
“Shit!” Peter shouts, releasing everything when he realizes he won’t be in time at all. With a sharp movement, Peter tugs at the steering wheel, making the car turn with loud, screeching wheels. The figure that is Wolverine literally flies off the roof, landing onto the street, while the car seems to lose its contact with the ground.
Remembering that it had been raining when he returned home, Peter grabs his coat from the hanger before putting his backpack on. He quickly looks down to see if his suit isn’t showing under his shirt, and then he takes the papers back, puts them in the bag, and heads out of the door while still throwing it over his shoulder.
“And people say that weddings are boring,” Tony mutters towards him. Steve pokes him in the side, and Bruce seems to do the same.
“Uh, what?”
even get to be sad. But… it’s a whole lot better than ending up in a loveless marriage, being a parent to a couple of kids you’ve never wanted.”
“No, I’m sorry as well. I was moving a bit too fast the clearly see anything,” he counters. Liz nervously pulls her hair out of her face and gives him a smile, which gives Peter a slight chill as well. Clearing his throat, he takes another step, only to the side, to clear her path.
“She died during birth…” Yaël frowned.
“Right, I’m not alone in this, I get it,” Tony mutters. “But, to be fair, if there’s an attack tomorrow and everybody’s lacking sleep, then fuck-ups are going to happen. At least a couple of you should catch some z’s.”
“But sex afterwards?” Tony asks with a pout. Steve rolls his eyes.
“Get to reading, smartass,” Steve tells him. Sharon passes a hand through his hair to mess it up even more, causing for her and Steve to laugh at the state of him. He grumbles in return, pulling the tablet back to himself.
Chapter warnings in the end notes.
“Your relationship?”
FRIDAY responds. Tony pushes himself back on his feet while he waits for the call to come through. It goes on and on, almost two minutes maybe. Tony doesn’t even expect for her to pick up anymore.
Chapter warning:
“You with us, dad?” Peter asks. He sounds a bit more lucid, it seems. That’s good.
Steve is still here, awkwardly looking around the workshop. Peter gives him a short glance before sighing.
“One time I added boosters to my skateboard to go faster. I ended up breaking my arm,” Peter finishes, looking back down at his hands after that.
“You look awful,” she states. Peter snorts, surprising himself with that reaction.
There he was, Raido, with Nilla behind him, holding the blade against his throat just a split-second before slitting his throat. His lifeless body slammed against the tiles. And also that got replayed and replayed right in front of her. If she’d be able to break her neck, just to look away, Yaël would do it. Her two friends kept on dying and got joined by a shade that turned into her father breathing out his last, shaky breath before falling down in the grass.
A bit too hot, but luckily, after meeting him for the third time now, she didn’t communicate with him that awkwardly anymore. Well, they actually spoke very naturally to each other, but on the other hand, he had never been nervous to talk to her. This man was confusing the living shit out of her. But maybe he didn’t even want to see her after all of this anymore, she was just a weird alien-girl after all. And she was more than two-thousand years older than him.
“Okay, let me put it this way: people like Wanda and you, you’d be put on a leash and they’d only free you if it was highly necessary.” It was quiet for a little moment, as Yaël was thinking about what her friend just told her. Okay, no, that didn’t sound good at all.
“I’m sorry. I love you,” he returns. MJ freezes on the spot for a moment, but then she starts running. Without responding otherwise to Peter’s confession, she’s out of danger at last. Peter breathes out in relief, glad that she’s no longer in harm’s way. The relief is short-lived. The spider-sense barely even gives him a warning before there’s another kick on the side.
Here we go!
hasn’t woken up?” she asks. Sandy shakes her head.
“Uh, old habits die hard. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. Listen, I need to go, the doctor is here.”
“Dude, not cool to mention her right now,” Flash says in a surprising sober, adult tone. Peter would have been confused at the way he’s defending him, but right now he doesn’t even care a bit. He clears his throat twice until it hurts before letting out a long, deep breath. It hurts in his chest.
“Thank you,” he whispers. The ‘dad’-word is on the tip of his tongue, but he figures it might still be too early. So he keeps that to himself. He gives his father a quick kiss on the cheek before pulling away and hurrying after his aunt, away from the tower.
“Uh, I come in peace?” Tony asks. He figures he’s not that much in a friendly relation with these guys.
Everybody nods in understanding. Steve and Tony get back on their feet, their hands holding each other in a strong grip. Though the Quinjet has been blown up, so they can’t make a quick return to the tower. They have to wait for a bit, it seems.
Michelle turns around, facing the man lying on the ground. He looks about two years older than they are. Probably some college-drop-out that has devoted his life for drugs instead. He looks the type.
Steve Rogers, the man who has been trying to talk to him the entire flight here. The man who doesn’t seem to accept the fact that it’s enough for Tony, that he’s done with it. He doesn’t want more fights, but he doesn’t want anything else, either. Not if it’s going to keep on making him feel like this, like a worthless piece of shit.
“Hello?” Peter asks. The door closes behind him. Whoever has been sitting there, startles up and jumps on his feet. His sandy blonde hair is cut short. He’s wearing a faded Superman shirt and sweatpants. His feet are covered by some warm-looking slippers.
“Fine, I’ll come,” he says. He returns to his bedroom to put on some jeans. His suit, he purposely leaves in the living room, in the bag. If they don’t see it, maybe they won’t be inclined to take it again. So Peter leaves the apartment following Natasha and Clint. They’re here on their motorcycles, and when Clint hands him a helmet, Peter takes it without complaining. He puts it on, takes place behind Clint on the vehicle, and then they’re off to Stark Tower.
, leave us; obviously I’m not alone.”
But after Rhodey, there’s more of them. Tony and Wanda together is difficult. She nods at him, clearly uncomfortable at having to be friendly to him after all those years of hatred. Tony says that he doesn’t take it personally, but Pepper knows he does.
And Peter flinches a bit when Tony stands up, dropping the suit back onto the ground. Then, after a few seconds, Tony opens up his arms and immediately, Peter practically jumps into them. With his face pressed against Tony’s shoulder, he sobs it out, letting go of the tears and the uncertainty.
“I’ll take that into consideration,” he says in return. T’Challa just smiles, guiding him through the hallways until he gets to a place that looks mighty much like his office. Once inside, Tony is facing a massive window that gives a wonderful view of the nature outside.
But the more time he spends in here, the more he wants to get out again. Just a bit of fresh air can’t be too bad, no? Still, Liz is eyeing him from everywhere she’s standing, too shy to actually talk to him. She’s often surrounded by her friends, and Peter stays close to Ned.
Yaël’s smirk instantly disappeared. Great, handle the thing with freaking air, it was precision work. She made the string put the brush back in the bathroom. Then she tried focusing on it to let it fly towards her. Come on, she had done it with the tiles, right? She could do this!
Upon the first mention of Steve joining SHIELD on the field, along with Natasha and Clint, he had grabbed the opportunity. He took it as an excuse not to have to live at Stark Tower, making it seem less like he was rejecting Tony but more like he just couldn’t be there. And besides, Tony hadn’t taken it personally, but just said that the tower was open for any of them at any time.
“No shit, I would get a fear of normal whales after this,” Harry counters. Peter laughs, and Harry laughs in return, only a bit louder. Peter stops immediately, feeling his eyes go wide. Suddenly all the sound in the class is disappearing, and all he’s hearing is Harry’s laugh, sharp and loud in the otherwise silent room. Is Peter imagining it? Or is Harry grinning here?
Peter startles from his thoughts when something is suddenly thrown against the back of his head. Realizing that he’s still in class makes him sit up almost immediately. He hopes the teacher hasn’t seen him drift off like that!
“Oh, I have to go to work…” She said after she looked at the clock hanging above her television.
“No, we’ll be alright,” he returns.
Tony lets out a soft breath, nodding to himself as he starts to head towards the living room. Catching a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror, any thought and doubt leaves his mind. Because this is it now, right? It’s taken a few years for him to accept it, but there’s no possible way for him to deny it anymore.
The Cat laughs.
“Of- of course,” Toomes stutters out, biting his teeth to keep himself from shouting. “Whatever you want!”
? Monster? Whatever it was, it looked like trouble. “That thing knocked me out?!”
“No, you don’t have to hide. Who is this unicorn of yours anyway?”
“Everybody’s a critic,” she then says, shrugging. “You’re alone?”
Slightly out of breath, Peter looks around to see that an entire crowd has already surrounded them. People who had been laughing are now looking with wide eyes and open mouths. Some of Flash’s friends are already trying to help him back up.
Bruce looks surprised at the apology. Tony knows he’s not the one to apologize too often. At least not with words.
Peter feels for her. He wishes he could help, but he can’t really do anything here. So he doesn’t answer. Nothing is said as they hold up their hands to stop a taxi, only to have it drive them by. There’s already somebody inside, Peter quickly notes. Better to just wait for the next one, then.
“Then call Logan, he’ll go in my place! He likes Peter well enough!”
Tony shakes his head. “This is ridiculous,” he mutters. “Okay now, kid, I’m not sure what you’re trying to achieve, here, but-“
It’s temporal. At least that’s what Strange could give him. How long it’ll take, he couldn’t say. It could be a day, it could be a week. At least not more than that, so that’s something he’s got going for himself.
Steve smirks a bit. “That sounds like a lot of paperwork,” he jokes, and Tony chuckles a bit as well. Then, Steve finally lowers the shield, taking another step towards the other man. Tony keeps himself where he’s standing, trying not to appear too eager. “It’s good to see you, Tony.”
“Frankly, Stark, I’m surprised you called us for this. I thought you’d want your people to look at this place. And with that I mean you and Bruce.”
Steve falls even more in love, watching how Thor helps Tony transform from his usual self to his usual self but looking more like an Asgardian. Tony looks uncomfortable, Steve can’t possibly deny that fact. But he looks just so beautiful, so bright as the golden cape is attached to Tony’s shoulders. There’s a glowing gemstone hanging over his chest, representing the arc reactor.
Once he gets back out, he almost stumbles against Steve, who is preparing himself to knock on the door of the workshop. The two apologize, but as soon as Steve sees him – and maybe recognizes him – he starts to frown.
Johnny keeps on kissing him. It’s not urging, not forcing him to comply. Peter’s all too aware that Johnny’s giving him the chance to pull away. But he doesn’t. Why, he doesn’t even know. His mind is one big mess, his eyes closing without his permission.
“That’s a long time,” Peter offers. Harry just smirks at him.
And then he closes the door and starts running towards Happy’s car, where he greets the bodyguard and allows himself to be driven away from the Avengers compound.
“Nah, there’s no fun in that.”
Closing the door behind them, Tony realizes once again that he’s now officially ‘alone’ with Steve. Peter is asleep in his bedroom (and how weird is it to be able to say that?), and Steve is just standing there in front of him, looking at him like’s he’s inspecting Tony.
By the time ‘somebody’ arrives, Peter has been on the couch for about half an hour. He’s not too surprised it’s Tony storming through the doors, insisting on seeing Peter.
“The suit?” Tony asks in confusion.
“I’m Felicia,” she returns. You look like you’re lost, do you need some directions?” She nods towards the map in Peter’s hand. Peter looks down, figuring that he might as well have her lead the way.
- Random Jessica Jones at an unfortunate moment
“Then what are you doing here? Go to your date!” Sam calls out, and Rhodey opens his mouth to say something, but then thinks better of it and shuts up instead. Of course, Rhodey knows about Tony and Steve; Rhodey knows
Peter suddenly says with his voice a few pitches higher.
“The Kingdom is my family, you’re just an ant and I can crush you in no time.”
“Vision, normal people don’t walk randomly into people’s bathrooms,” Yaël said without looking up or making the effort to cover herself.
And she does eventually, arriving in the room with Bruce by her side, holding a chart in her hand and a serious look on her face. The fact that she took Bruce with her can’t mean much good.
The evening comes to a close. Once they’re back on the stage, all of them wearing nice, black suits and Peter having put his hat back on, they wait for whatever else is going to come next.
But in his defense, it’s mostly because that damn number is put on a piece of paper that held all the details on his appointment with Mr. Stark.
So after using air to change the course of the plates a bit so they wouldn’t fly into Peter’s face (she couldn’t even steer them to softly land on a table or shoot them back or anything), and after using it together with earth to make a shield for so long, she felt completely drained. She was trying her utter best to land the tiles back on their place, but some of them just fell and clattered against the floor, so she just let go of the air and fixed them quickly by using her earth-powers.
“Thanks, man,” he tells him. Then he throws his arms over his Uncle’s shoulders and hugs him tightly.
When there’s the sound of glass breaking and Tony cursing, everybody turns around.
They prescribed him therapy and lots of medications. Peter ended up going on bi-weekly sessions.
Sometimes he came to visit her in her room afterwards. Those were the moments he had been caring for her, cleaning her wounds. After a while, Yaël refused to talk to him anymore. He was the reason why she ended up on that ship. But Loki never stopped talking to her, even though he knew she wouldn’t reply, he told her it was almost over, that she shouldn’t be afraid. But the joke was that on one point, she couldn’t feel afraid as she wasn’t able to feel a thing anymore. Just the way Thanos wanted her to be.
“Come on, you know I’m not-“ Peter starts, but his own mind stops him.
Inspired by "The Burden"-Memphis May Fire
Somewhere Yaël heard knocking.
“Aunt May, come on, I’m not getting married!” Peter counters while trying to take a step back. He’s strong enough to force himself out of her hands, but he holds himself on. Her affection isn’t all that bad.
“Even though I was almost certain I was going to die at my best friend’s hand, I didn’t want to give up. I
“How- what did they do to her?”
Holy shit how is this life?
He remembers again how much he’s missed Thor in the years that he had disappeared. It’s good to have him around more often again.
“Sorry,” he says shortly. Tony shakes his head.
He and Mantis are quiet. They don’t have a lot to say right now. Peter’s still not feeling extremely well, and Mantis knows exactly what he’s going through. Literally, since she can sense everything he feels just whenever she touches him. And while she tries to shift his emotions as much as she can, she doesn’t dare to make the shift too big, unknowing of what that could do to him.
He doesn’t wait for another response. He just hangs up the phone, dropping it on the ground. If everything goes right, he won’t need it anymore. He wipes the tears away from his face and hurries back to Natasha’s side. She casts one short look at him.
“Uh,” is all Tony can answer, and that’s answer enough. Peter isn’t angry, though. He gives Tony a playful poke, but then allows him to finish the tour. Once it’s time for the presentation, they get to the auditorium and take place somewhere on the sides. Peter, sitting safely between Aunt May and another student – a girl with bright orange curls and freckles on her face – waits patiently for the lights to be shut off.
“Parker, Jones, come over here,” Tony says while waving them on. Peter and MJ move forward until they’re standing right next to them. “These are Peter and Michelle, my best two interns.”
really suit you,” somebody jokes, and then everybody laughs again. While grunting, Flash starts to stand up again. He sounds a bit breathless, leaning against one of his palls as he turns back towards Peter.
“I think you know you shouldn’t punch kids, and I know that kid pushed your buttons that day. I’m not saying that excuses you, but… I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m not so sure I wouldn’t have punched him either had I been in your shoes,” Tony says while cleaning up the mess and closing the first aid box again. Before he heads back to the counter, he turns to Peter and puts a hand on his shoulder. “If you ever… want to tell me about what happened in that bell-tower, I will listen.”
And they sit like that for a while, jumping together whenever there’s a scary part. When Wade suddenly hands them a glass of coke, they share it without any comment about it. It’s good, it’s pleasant, and for a moment Peter wishes they were alone, just the two of them.
“Alright, let’s do this, Parker,” he tells himself. He walks out of the restroom, hurries to his locker to take the books to the next class, and makes his way to the place he needs to be. But, before he gets there, he makes a stop at his previous class. The students are currently walking outside since the class is over. They give him a weird look when he gets back in. He waves at Ned and Harry when they give him questioning glances.
“Oh, no, no, no! You’re not going to-“
“Venom?” Harry asks, confused. Peter shrugs.
Fury and Professor X then moved towards the door and before they left, Fury said: “Oh, and please prove to me that you’re a responsible, normal adult this time.”
“Tony,” Natasha suddenly calls out to get his attention, and Tony pulls the hand away from his face, keeping his eyes on the calm super-assassin in front of him. “You’re being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal?”
The Goblin just snorts.
?” Peter’s voice pulled her out of her thoughts. Why was she suddenly walking back to her room?
“Honey, where are you?” Tony asks while leaving the bedroom. The good thing about this place is the fact that their bedroom is on the main floor, which means they don’t have the take the stairs all the time. As a matter of fact, there is no upstairs. It’s all just a one-floor house with a super-smart AI installed in it and three stupid bots causing destruction in the garage.
Tony lowers his gaze. “Listen, kid, I…”
Tony’s mother, who shouting in the car, begging for help. Calling out for Howard, in worry.
He’s aware that he’s getting himself out of breath in a way, but the next thing he can really think clearly of it the headache he’s feeling afterwards.
“Your dad? But I thought your parents died?” Gwen asks in confusion. She leans down to take her mask back from the ground, keeping it in her hands as she looks at Peter in confusion.
“No, it’s mostly that friend of yours. She came into the office to get a job, claiming that I’m stealing you away from her,” Tony mutters then, sitting back down on the chair. He rubs his forehead while looking to the side.
“It’s curious, isn’t it?” Yaël asks, looking at the hammer with amusement in her eyes. Peter doesn’t say anything, sure that she’ll give an explanation anyway. “When the people arrived here, the first thing they found was Mjölnir, for some reason completely repaired.”
“Oh, no, not on Sakaar, at least. You just fight here and try not to die,” he said like that was an extremely normal situation. At some point, Yaël noticed she came back to the exact same point where they started walking, without her even noticing she had been walking in circles.
“Yeah, that’s true. So I hope you’re not forgetting about your meeting with the board today?”
And in return, all Peter did was being slow and muttering out curses towards the man. What an idiot, he is!
“Hey, you heard about that Spider-Man? Took out some giant lizard while we were chasing down air a few weeks back.” Steve nodded. He had indeed read something about it. When they arrive in front of Tony’s door, Steve stopped pushing the chair.
“You need a cute name, like the characters from My Little Pony! Because girl, you look like an adorable, tasty cupcake.” He said while he was checking her hair.
“Have a nice flight, Steve,” he answers before turning around again. He blames the ache in his stomach as a result of this conversation. And if he runs to the toilet to puke the moment he passes the corner, nobody needs to know.
“You shouldn’t make a decision based on what others do,” Vision says, obviously not really approving of it.
“Okay with what?” Tony asks, frowning a bit in confusion.
They call this the mansion, but in fact it’s quite a humble little house. Ever since Tony’s arthritis came back (about the time the serum was completely out of his system), they all came to the agreement that he doesn’t need his workshop close to him anymore. Knowing Steve likes the simple things, they build a small house that’s still high-tech enough for Tony, but fits all the parts of dream-house for Steve, too.
Steve looks down at his appearance and then chuckles while shrugging.
to go to jail?”
Wade looked at it like he was a kid at the circus. Yaël moved the water until it hung above Wade’s glass. Then she formed her hand into a tight fist. Wade saw the water turn into ice in just a second. Yaël dropped the ice in the juice and handed the glass to Wade. He smiled, as if the juice would taste even better now.
“I just don’t know what are my own thoughts anymore…” Peter says. “It’s like there’s two opposite sides inside my head; the one telling me I love MJ, and the other one telling me I desire the Cat. It’s driving me crazy.”
“Saving it up now. Aunt May and Dad now keep me from helping out with the bills. Between the two of them, they’ve got everything covered. He even offered her to move into the tower, but Aunt May doesn’t really seem interested in that.”
“You didn’t hear? Peter got attacked by the Green Goblin again!”
Then she starts walking off, giving him a wink and sticking out her tongue before turning her back to him. Peter watches her go for a moment, seeing a whole other side of Michelle that he’s never seen before. At first, he thought she was some sort of cyborg like in those Terminator-movies. Her icy-cold glare used to bring those thoughts into his head, really. Now she seems… human, in a way?
Harry says. “
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers is here, said he wanted to talk with you,” the woman says, keeping her hand on the door-handle. Mr. Stark nods and waves at her that she can go, which she does without another word. Quickly after that, the door opens again, revealing none other than Steve Rogers.
Yaël’s proud face fell down when she saw a woman walking in. She looked like a female body builder in full armour. Her hair was pulled back in a firm knot, which made her look even more sternly. So, Yaël obviously failed at picking open the lock.
Better to just get everything over with.
“Me? Uh, not really. Ned has stuff to do, and I don’t really have any other friends available or that I want to hang out with,” Peter shrugs, clearly meaning Wade with the last one. Tony then looks up, unimpressed. “Oh, you mean-? Uh, yeah, maybe? I always have the suit with me, so…”
“It’s the liver, isn’t it?” he asks. “What’s his blood-type?”
“Follow me,” Mr. Stark instructs once again. Peter sees how the man is slowly making his way towards his work bench, where something that looks an awful lot like the Iron man gauntlet is lying on the wooden table. “Now, Mr. Parker. Last time I was on the field, my repulsor failed and I missed a shot. I’ve already looked at the problem, but haven’t taken care of it yet.” With that, Mr. Stark holds up his wounded hand and just shrugs.
So, trying not to look too suspicious about it, Peter starts looking behind every door. There isn’t really anybody inside any of the rooms, which make it conveniently easy for him to weasel out of every bedroom he passes.
“Okay, I don’t have homework, but… I can’t just… leave?”
For the first time in a while, he feels like he’s back in control of his own life. And it feels good.
Tony doesn’t feel his body anymore. He tries to move, but notices that he can’t. Instead, all he can do is focus on that small picture of Peter. He must have been about five or six when that was taken. He looks happy, untroubled. Far away from the kid Tony met a few months ago.
He takes a cab to the hospital, and probably pays the driver too much. He doesn’t care, he just wants to get inside as quickly as he can. He hurries into the building, taking a turn to where he knows ICU is – he’s been there a few times when he came to see May at work – and then hopping into the elevator. There’s another doctor in there he only vaguely recognizes. It takes a short look at her badge to place her name.
