“Got it in one.   Tiny, agricultural nation?  Guess you’ve heard of it,” Tony grimaced.  “Anyway, so turns out, that’s kind of a giant lie, but point being, Shuri is maybe the smallest, tiniest, just a tad bit smarter than me.”
“This is my fault,” Tony broke in, mouth flattening into a grimace around a sigh. “You are so good for me, it is easy to forget that you have no training and do not know our culture or our ways,” he said with a frustrated sigh.  “Yes, there are punishments.  But, it is not like what is in your head,” he stopped, wiped a hand over his mouth and looked away.  “It is nothing like what you experienced with Rumlow.
“Hon…you’re fired.  You’re like…so incredibly fired.  Fired, fired, fired,” Tony said, shaking his head in mock sadness.  “I can get hundreds of painters.  There’s only one you.  And if you think I’m letting you go back to work after that…”
“Steve’s foundation will be to help poor strippers,” Tony replied with a completely straight face.  Steve wasn’t sure if he wanted to shake him or kiss him. Probably both.
Steve opened his mouth, though to say what, he had no idea.  Instead, all he could manage to do was  watch Tony leave, only realizing he was shaking once Tony’s back disappeared down the hallway into the bedroom.  He was cold. The water was warm, but it didn’t seem to matter. Sluggishly, he stepped out of the tub on feet that seemed tied down with rocks.  He picked up his robe and went through the motions of putting it on, tying it, smoothing it down.  Adjusting it around his collar.
“You’ll get one right around the time you can single-handedly take out a terrorist cell, how about?” Rumlow replied.  “Gotta be all special-like to get that kind of service out of your service, know what I mean?”
Please don’t let me lose this, Tony thought, reaching out and placing a hand on the pillow next to him.
“You’re so beautiful, Tony,” Steve said, his voice ringing surprisingly firm and clear in his head. “I love you so much, I do. I know you don’t believe me, but I do, I do, God help me, I love--”
“Oh my God!  Did you hear?  I can’t believe we missed it, Tones!  They found Captain America!
Steve turned and stepped back, then arched his fist back and slammed it into the bank of lockers.  It went flying out of its bolts and into the stand of lockers behind it, knocking those over, too.
do it.”
His eyes were wide and liquid, his voice coming out thick and shaky.
“Yeah, that happens,” Steve whispered, a thread of something raw in his voice that made it go tight.  Tony flinched at the sound, hating it, whatever it was, hating hearing that kind of pain from Steve.  It hurt Tony somehow, which made no sense, but there it was, souring his dinner in his stomach. “Good night, Tony.  Thanks for…well, just thanks.”
right, too.  In some way that Steve couldn’t quite fathom.  He looked over at the hand crank and cannon.  It goes inside, he thought.  And the shell on top.  Four of those cranks with men sitting inside to turn them, and the thing could move.  Move and fire and be
He was fairly certain the whole experience had been designed to make him more cooperative with Howard’s plans.  Be a good, little Omega, get on his knees and beg for some big Alpha to be so kind as to knot him.
“I—no. I don’t… hate isn’t the right word, but…” Steve trailed off. Maybe it was the right word. He didn’t like the idea of anyone hating Tony, though. It
“Not really,” Steve answered.  He had his backpack in his lap and was looking out the large window at the passing street as the bus pulled away.
“You have my full attention,” Tony repeated, though this time, the bitter mockery was gone and something like wry admiration remained in its stead.
Steve stopped short, frowning.
Steve was aware that his heart was pounding in his chest as if it was trying to chisel through his ribs, and his brow was covered in sweat, though neither of those things seemed to matter.  He sucked in a breath and tried to calm himself, though he found himself reaching for Tony, almost as if his limbs were working of their own accord.
“Okay, it isn’t that I don’t appreciate your willingness to participate in trust exercises, Steve, don’t get me wrong, but a little warning next time? What if I hadn’t caught you, huh? You’d be Flat Steve, like Flat Stanley, which you don’t even know about, and that makes my internal Rolodex of cultural references really useless, which, you know, is putting years of stored knowledge to waste,” Tony said as soon as the airlock hissed shut and he could disengage the suit’s helmet.
“The party was nice.  I just never know what to do with myself at things like that,” Steve responded with a small shrug of his shoulders.
“Is that me?” Cam asked, leaning over Steve’s shoulder to study the drawing.
The Stranger actually seemed to enjoy the tasks, though.  And he made his sounds while he worked. Anto liked to listen.  There was something pleasing about hearing the man’s deep voice ring in the cave as they worked side by side.  He desperately wanted to ask the Stranger to tell him what the sounds meant, but it wasn’t proper to talk to an Alpha like that, let alone a man of the Others, so he mostly sat in silence and listened.  Once, he had come back to find all his grasses woven into a small basket, but done in such a way that the grasses formed a pattern of different colors and shapes that was like nothing he had seen before.
“Really?” Cam breathed out, almost a squeak.
“Can you—show me the last time he asked me to do something before we started—before the Mark 40 got fried,” Tony ordered, bracing himself.  He watched the video fill the screen in front of him, his mind instantly recalling it.  It hadn’t been a big thing.  Unremarkable, really.  They’d been sitting in the workshop, talking about the Tesseract and Selvig’s notes.  Or, rather, Tony had been talking and Steve had been doing a lot of forceful nodding.  Steve had asked him to hit up that burger joint, the one they’d ended up at last night, thanks subconscious, awesome Freudian onion rings we got to have.
His head is thrown back as his arms line the head and the armrest of the couch. One leg of snuggled between Tony and the cushions, while another is stretched out below. He's snoring lightly and if you peer close, you can see the line of drool running from the corner of his mouth and pooling in at the shirt, creating a huge wet patch.
Else, he's going to force Tony to return home from wherever he is, trying to fucking stake claim of ownership on him, even after everything.
"I will if you fucking sit down."
This point of view is going to be split into two parts. The next one will deal with Steve's infidelity and what he feels.
"Once this whole ordeal is over, I think you should move back to Cali. Pepper anyway wants you there in the headquarters. Peter will be safe in college, I can trust that no harm will come to him. I'll even check in a few of my friends to drop by and keep an eye on him."
It lingers for a while between them before Bucky speaks up.
Well fuck, when the fuck did I become a doctor?
Steve looks at the wound before perking his eyes up at Tony and oh my god, Tony feels part disgust and part cute aggression.
But Tony didn't want to think about that now. For just a moment or two, he wanted to bask in the satisfaction that he and his beloved son had created something amazing together.
"I'll give you a little while longer, okay?" she said as she adjusted the alarms on his monitors. "But only a little while."
Tony sighed, scrubbing his palm down his face as Steve gently squeezed his shoulder. Under any other circumstances getting to mess around with the laws of physics—and with time-travel, even if Tony was flat-out refusing to call what they were tinkering with actual time-travel—would fill him with his usual hyper-creative energy. But with what was potentially at stake, Tony found that he just couldn't seem to muster up his usual excitement for it.
Uncle Bucky's eyes went wide as he took another sip of Dr Pepper. "What, a good-lookin' boy like you? Nah, I can't believe that."
This Steve is filled with confidence, but still apparently humble enough to keep most of it reigned in as he and the rest of the field are introduced to the audience.  As Steve’s name is called and he waves to the crowd, Tony’s jaw drops open, his eyes scanning back and forth across those glorious shoulders and ogling the way Steve’s back muscles ripple as he slips out of his warm-up pants and tosses them onto a chair.
Dad stopped him with a raised hand. "I know, bud. Tonight, okay?"
Peter shrugged. "That's just what Auntie Carol always calls it whenever you two are acting all lovey-dovey. Which is pretty much all the time."
"No, it is highly unlikely that any of you humans would have survived an encounter with Hela," said Uncle Thor. "That was in fact the main reason for my silence." He picked up his refilled glass of lemonade glass, downing its contents in three large gulps before getting to his feet. "And with that, I am afraid that I must be off. Without my hammer I am travelling a bit slower than usual, and if I leave Loki and Valkyrie alone together for too long I run the risk of no longer having a brother by the time I return."
“Is it what Ms Mags said?” Peter asks gently.  “‘Bout you finding a wife?”
Having his father disappear right in front of his eyes, leaving him stranded on a dying planet with a bunch of goofy strangers?
"I'm not going on a date, Buck," Steve snapped. "And even if I was, it'd still be none of your business."
At least his uniform wasn't torn up. In fact, aside from a few splotches of dirt here and there, Steve's uniform hardly even looked used, much less like it usually did during a battle of this scale.
"Ninety seconds to reentry, sir," JARVIS said. "Captain Rogers’ vital signs are also improving."
"Ms Potts is currently in her office, sir, I will put you through."
"Yeah, it's all right," Steve murmured as he sat down on the side of the bed. "I'd be the same way."
leave the school before I got there, buddy, so why do you think that I’d let you—?”
Even through all of their grief and suffering over the last year, through all of their anguish and pain, and even though they hadn't made love in almost a
"Holy shit," he breathed, gulping audibly. "Um… JARVIS?"
"Thank you, Ms Sharon," he said, blinking back tears.
He was so exhausted that he didn't know how he was still even breathing, much less moving.
"JARVIS?" Steve asked. "Are we good to go?"
accept that!" he cried as he launched the shield again, this time aided by a sudden blast from Carol Danvers that was powerful enough to both take out the alien and slam Thanos down onto his back.
He was cut off by a repulsor shot that flashed so close to his face that it singed the overgrown whiskers covering his chin. He cried out, raising his hands in surrender as he took a step forward.
Steve jerked awake as the early-morning Wakandan sunlight began streaming through the tall windows of Shuri's lab, letting out a soft groan as one particularly strong beam hit him directly in the face. He breathed in, rubbing at a stubborn crick in his neck as he reached for the glass of water Shuri had left for him on Tony's bedside table the night before, downing the whole thing in three large gulps. The cool liquid made him shiver as it made its way down his throat and into his completely empty stomach, earning a sharp glare when it growled in protest.
"Yeah, I did," said Tony. "I was up there on the observation deck watching, and it looked to me that you could barely walk once your feet hit the floor. I'm pretty sure if your buddy hadn't been there you would've face-planted right there next to your aircraft."
Steve breathed in deeply, allowing the glorious scent to permeate throughout his body before turning his face just enough to press his cheek against the top of Tony's head, tightening his arm where it was draped over Tony's trim waist. They were both still naked, too tired and sated after their last lovemaking session less than ninety minutes ago to do much more than pull the covers back up over themselves and spoon together.
And then the claws opened, and Peter was free falling through the frigid air, barely able to get his bearings as his suit's built-in parachute deployed, slowing his plummet towards the ice-covered lake just enough to keep his legs from breaking as he slammed down onto the surface.
Tony's eyebrows shot up in surprise before he even realised what he was doing, and he let out a small cough, gritting his teeth when he felt a hot flush creeping up his neck. While he knew that the Air Corps pilots had to have some minimal level of intelligence in order to get to fly all the fancy fighters in the first place, in all of his years working as a civilian liaison Tony hadn't had a single one ask such a question.
"Whoa, so you mean actual space travel!" exclaimed Barnes. "Really? That's really cool!"
After finding a parking place about a half a block away from the store, Tony cut the engine and tipped his head forward, thudding it against the steering wheel.  He would’ve never admitted it in front of Peter, but he was scared.  Like, the scared shitless kind of scared.
Exiting Peter's room, Steve headed next for the kitchen, following the strong scent of freshly-brewed coffee and frowning as he saw that the coffee pot was already half empty. He had learned of Tony's love of coffee—Steve flat-out refused to call it an addiction—way back when Peter was in the hospital in Afghanistan after their harrowing escape from the Ten Rings. But in the weeks since what the news people had taken to calling the Battle of New York, Tony's coffee consumption seemed to have grown exponentially.
Tony squeezed his eyes closed, trying like hell to hold onto his patience. Phillips was one of the good guys, it wouldn't do anyone any good to deliberately piss him off.
“All right, so we’ve got super-scary HYDRA energy weapons and a helluva lot of trigger-happy soldiers ready to fire ‘em,” says Tony.  “Call it, Captain.”
"Can you please start compiling a list of any possible suppliers or producers of materials that could be used to construct an armoured suit similar to the Iron Legion?"
"I've never been a fan of wasting words," Tony said as Stacy moved over to Gwen, gently shaking her good shoulder. She woke with a start, her face screwing into a look of despair as she noticed Peter still lying in bed, as still as could be.
"Me too," Steve said as he sat down, ruffling Peter's hair. "I'm sorry it's been a few days. They've been keeping us pretty busy at the base lately, so—"
Tony threw up his hands. "New York City's pretty damn big, J, you can't do any better than that?"
"Shit, baby, you're just too damn sexy for words." Tony cupped Steve's face in one hand, bringing their lips together in another deep kiss as his other hand curled around their cocks, stroking them together. "More?"
"Yeah, you told me," Steve said. "You told me he saved you."
Tony sighed.  Steve did have a point.  While Tony used to leave Peter behind semi-regularly when he travelled on business, ever since his decidedly
"You were always going to lose," Thanos said, his raspy voice scraping along Steve's fraying nerves like a straight razor. "Because I am inevitable."
"Oh, like you never do any of that! I'm just a beat cop, but you guys… you're the real deal!" the young officer said, clearing his throat as he glanced over at Stacy. "Anyway, it was so awesome to meet you both!"
"Oh, that sounds like fun!" Ned exclaimed. "Are you gonna be there, Betty?"
"Mmm, fine. But only if you promise to make me some more coffee afterwards."
And eating dessert before dinner was something that Peter turned down. At least once every couple of weeks if Dad was busy in the lab or something, he and Papa would take a detour on the way home for ice cream.
If Tony could manage to build something strong enough to fight his way out of a fully armoured cave in Afghanistan with a dying Peter in tow, then he could surely figure out how to fight his way off of a spaceship with a Peter that was just as powerful—or even more so—than Steve.
"Three thousand, eight hundred and three," Ned said proudly. "And my mom let me put in a preorder this morning, so as soon as it comes available they'll ship it right out." He paused, eyeing Peter pointedly. "You know, it would be tons of fun if we could build it over at your place. Maybe your Auntie Nat would even wanna help us?"
"Okay, um…" Peter gasped. He quickly scanned the area for a shortcut and took off running, hoping to cut the van off in the next neighbourhood.
Steve shuddered as he pressed his forehead against Tony's, his thumb rubbing soft circles on Tony's cheekbone.
"There is," said Tony. "Which means that along with the time-space compass I'm gonna have to build, Bruce and I will also have to write an algorithm for JARVIS so he can help us eliminate the universes that have no chance of being the right ones."
"Very good, sir."
Without another word, Tony turned on his heel and practically sprinted down the hall to his office, sucking in a deep breath as soon as the door was closed.
"I have heard that phrase used to describe it, sir," said Steve.
"Um… I don't think I get what you mean?" Steve asked. A second later Tony let out a loud snort, tipping his forehead against Steve's arm.
" Tony finally said, rushing the words. He forcibly snapped his jaw closed, swallowing hard. "How in the hell are you even real?"
Their ease of conversation was also helpful in soothing most of Tony's lingering fears regarding Peter's upcoming transfer. Peter hadn't exactly been thrilled with the prospect of being moved from the hospital, which Tony could understand. But the fact that Tony had essentially had to tell Peter that he didn't have a say in the matter despite his begging and pleading still haunted him. All through Peter's life Tony had tried to use the so-called "Dad card" as sparingly as possible, and it had made him very uneasy that he and Steve were basically forcing Peter to go and live in a house with an old woman who he didn't know and who knowingly hated his grandfather.
"Yeah. Whatever it takes."
Or missing.
"Right," said Uncle Bucky. "Which means it's serious."
Still remember the exact moment when he realised he could no longer hold his breath, and was forced to give in.
And it got even worse for Tony after Peter was born. Based on what Steve had gleaned from Colonel Phillips, as soon as Peter was diagnosed with his heart defect the government doubled-down, ordering more and more work from Tony with the promise of eventually granting permission for the very expensive operation required to heal Peter's heart. Steve had even gone so far as to ask Sharon Carter at the hospital if she knew of any more information that might be helpful, and while she had informed Steve that she technically wasn't allowed to tell him anything, he'd been able to gather enough information asking some basic yes or no questions to corroborate his theory.
this interface to work! What the hell am I missing?"
"No, no, six hours is fine." That would put it right around the time that he'd be back in his room for bedtime anyway. "Can you get started right away? Please?"
Peter was Tony's whole life. There was no way Tony would be able to survive without him.
Steve let out another whimper, prompting Tony to climb onto the cot next to him.  “Honey,
In fact, something that he had only chosen to share with a couple select people, namely Tony and Sam, Steve still was firmly convinced that if he hadn't crashed the
"No one's gonna get you, buddy," Tony said firmly as he ran his fingers through Peter's hair. "No one's gonna ever get you, not while any of us are alive."
"I don't know, sweetheart," Steve answered, so thick and low that it forced Tony to abandon all pretense of trying to be angry. His face crumpled as he traced Steve's cheek on the screen, right through a smear of dusty grime. "We were just sitting there talking, and suddenly all hell broke loose."
"Shh, honey,
Tony huffed as he nodded, quirking an eyebrow at Steve. "Yeah, okay bud. Go on and brush your teeth."
"Well, I guess we'll find out," said Quill. "Hey, Mantis? You wanna come here for a sec?"
"Well, thank goodness for our modern views on sexuality, hmm?" said Tony. He rose up onto his tiptoes, pressing a soft but lingering kiss to Steve's lips, one that had both of their hearts thudding by the time they broke apart. "And thank goodness that Pete took it upon himself to inform you of those modern views."
He had always hated that disgusting moss shit, the green stuff that suffocated trees and gleefully ate its way through plaster and wood. Being the billionaire that he was, Tony had proudly employed a team of groundskeepers to care for the Malibu house, many of whom he had known for most of his life. They, like most of his employees, were wonderful people, devoted to their work and highly motivated by Tony's generous pay and benefits.
"Ahh… no. No reason," Tony answered, relief washing over him like a wave. After being forced to fight without JARVIS's help while up on Titan, it was a huge weight off Tony's mind to have his trusty UI back again.
"Thanos happened," Carol cut in.
“Yeah, that’s my kid,” he says as he drops Peter’s towel down onto his chest in a heap.  “Always the dramatic one, eh, buddy?”
"I think we're here," answered Dr Strange. "Wherever 'here' is."
Papa's jaw tightened, his arm instinctively drawing Dad closer to him. "According to JARVIS, there's only one person who's ever developed any kind of shrinking tech. And apparently, he's no friend of the Stark family."
Slowly, Steve curled his shoulders forward, drawing his knees up to his chest and clamping his palms over his ears, trying to drown out the sound that was now too loud to ignore. He squeezed his eyes closed, fighting against the increasing urge to scream.
"Okay, I think I'm ready," Peter said, carefully clutching his perfectly-wrapped bundle of gifts. "We're supposed to pick Gwen up at the police station now."
"Steve!" screamed Carol, barely audible through Steve's ringing ears. "Steve, you've gotta—!"
“Good race, Alexei,” Steve says.  A tear escapes from his eye as Shostakov grins and thanks him, one that Steve hopes will blend in with the water droplets dripping from his soaking wet hair.  Then he offers Jacques and Bucky his congratulations and makes his escape, managing to make it all the way to the cool-down pool before completely breaking down.  As soon as he’s out of sight of the television cameras, he drops his stuff and jumps in, allowing himself to sink all the way to the bottom as his mind swirls with an uncertainty that he never considered and so certainly never planned for.
be? Tony, that's not good enough for me!"
"I wouldn't dream of being anywhere else," replied Helen. "And while we're in the operating room, we will also repair Captain Rogers' cheekbone and realign one of the broken ribs on his left side, which is currently scraping against his lung."
"We've got about two minutes till we touch down, so you guys might wanna pop a breath mint or something."
"That is correct."
"I am
"That sounds good," said Gwen. "Maybe after you guys get back from your trip?"
With another furtive glance at Steve, Tony stepped over to the computer station where Bruce and Natasha were working, listening as Natasha translated the Russian text.
"Honey, we can't just lock him in his room all the time!" Tony said, firmly but gently. "As much as I wish we could. But he's fifteen now, and finally he has some decent friends that he wants to spend time with and who want to spend time with him. And this girl, Liz, she's just as big of a nerd as Pete, so I'm guessing they're all just gonna be sitting around eating pizza and playing Trivial Pursuit or something. Not exactly what I would call a wild party."
Steve huffed in frustration. "Just give me something!"
"Which isn't at all like you," Bucky said, soft enough for only Steve to hear him. "C'mon, Stevie, you gotta try and focus here!"
The mantra repeats on a loop inside Steve’s head as he climbs onto his block.  Slowly and deliberately, he slides forward until his toes are just over the edge and then bends over, swinging his arms behind his back three times.  His left shoulder twinges slightly on the third swing, but he ignores it.  This is no time for annoying shoulder twinges.  Not when there's a gold medal on the line.
"Sir," Steve replied, sitting so perfectly straight in his chair that Tony was certain he could've balanced a level across his shoulders.
"Hey, Pete?" Tony said, gently shaking his son's shoulder. "Buddy, you keep trying to faceplant into your popcorn, so why don't you head on to bed, yeah?"
"Yeah, yeah, just had a kind of interesting thought." Tony gave his head a quick shake, squeezing Steve's hand reassuringly. "JARVIS, has Beck been escorted out yet?"
And now, Peter not only was able to see Dad and Papa every single night for pretty much as long as he wanted, he also had Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam spending most of the days with him along with his papa's ma, who just the night before had asked him to call her Grandma.
“Steve,” Steve said.
Steve looked at him blankly, opened his mouth, then closed it again.  How did it make him feel?  He wasn’t sure.  It had been humiliating and painful in its way, but when he thought about it now, he remembered Tony watching him, Tony not watching him, which was somehow good, too, and the way it had hurt, a bright, high, stretched thin sort of ache that felt like walking along the edge of a cliff.  A low, squirming heat filled his belly and made its way down his cock, and his chest tightened, while a steady beat of pressure coiled tight and hot behind his balls.
, he could hear Ms. Romanov’s voice echo in his mind.  Making Tony happy felt good, he wasn’t going to deny it, the way Tony smiled at him at the end of the night, in that soft, relaxed way, looking at Steve, touching him and telling him how good, how beautiful he was.  He liked the way that made him feel, like he’d accomplished some feat that actually meant something, however ridiculous that sounded the next morning.  It was just that he was pretty sure this was not the kind of job satisfaction the lady in career counseling back at the art school had in mind.  “I just wanted to look nice, Buck.  Don’t read so much into it.”
“Playing to the crowd,” Stark replied, tossing him a grin. “Now, see, I’m in business, as you know, and in business, I buy and sell, billions of dollars changing hands, you get me?”  Brock nodded.  “So, I’m pretty used to getting what I want.  People, let’s say, they tend to be willing to do that, for a certain price, of course. But Steve...Steve, here, he’s a stand-up guy, right?  Good guy. Upstanding.
“Steve,” Tony breathed out in an aching, broken whisper, a deep regret echoing in his voice. “You know I can’t give you that promise.”
Steve nodded.  He knew his eyes must be the size of the coins Cam had thrown to the crowd earlier in the day.  He couldn’t quite process Tony’s words.  There was no context for them.  He wet his lips and watched Tony’s eyes narrow on the movement.
“So, you do play?” Steve guessed.
Steve pushed himself up to all fours, head bowing low and breaths coming in deep, heaving pants, muscles shuddering with some effort Tony couldn’t comprehend.  They were too far apart, Tony realized, after being together for so long, this was too much.  He kicked his jeans and boxers off the rest of the way and half crawled up to kneel at Steve’s head, wrapping his arms around him as best he could and drawing him closer.  Steve obligingly curled into Tony’s embrace while Tony ran his hands up and down Steve’s skin.  They were both a mess, sticky and sweaty, and he was pretty sure those were carpet fibers in Steve’s hair.
“It will look better on you,” Steve replied with a slight shrug.  He turned to Tony and held up the wrap on the flat of his hands, tails hanging down, the way it was meant to be offered.  “May I?”
Tony punched the answer button and held the phone to his ear with a wince. “...pick up, Tony. Come on, pick up, pick up,” Rhodey chanted into the line.
“Didn’t think you’d like what?” Tony heard himself ask.  His voice sounded strange, garbled, the words floating away on the wind like they were in those little cartoon text bubbles.
“That’s not why I’m here,” Steve replied, then realized he was using his Captain’s voice, the one that barked orders and expected to be obeyed, and how ridiculous that sounded given how he was dressed.  Tony laughed, hard and brutal and not a laugh at all, making Steve wince at the discordant sound of it, like a note plucked wrong on some player’s lyre.
“Definitely not,” Tony agreed with a nod.
Definitely.
Steve was still clutching his chest, trying to figure out how to convince himself not to choke on the air he kept forcing into dead lungs.  He looked down at his hands, holding them out in front of him. They were young, strong hands.  Free of blemishes and the knots of old age that long ago settled into his bones.  The rest of him was the same.  Young. Strong. He made a fist. Very strong, he corrected. Exhilaration flowed through him. He felt like he could do anything.
“See what we did?  We came this close to having a moment,” Rhodey said, shaking his head and letting it drop back to the desk.  “You hush about my baby.  She looks great.  Do I mock your teeny-tiny sportscars?”
Their table was situated at the corner of the restaurant, where large glass windows opened on to a view of the Bellagio’s massive fountains as they rose and fell in an undulating dance.  Even Tony had to admit that it was a pretty spectacular distraction, as those things went.  Roses and champagne had been at their table waiting for them.  He’d have to remember to thank Pepper for her subtlety later, Tony thought with a slight grimace as he looked back down at the menu and half-listened to the waiter go over the chef’s recommendations.  Steve was explaining his allergies while the waiter nodded and pointed at things on the menu.  Tony was, he could admit to himself, trying not to moon like some lovesick teenager who found his boyfriend’s allergies adorable, because that would be pathetic.  He was pretty sure that would be pathetic.
“There’s a touchpad temperature control that’s programmed to your fingerprint,” Tony informed him.  “Gimme,” he pleaded, stretching fingers out towards the coffee mug Steve was apparently holding for ransom in return for uncharred bread.
“No.  No,” Tony repeated.  “Just an observation.  I just…can’t risk any loose ends.  Loose ends like upset boyfriends, who show up and make a scene in front of the shutterflies still camped out in the lobby pretending to be tourists.”
“You should hear Bucky, though,” Steve told Shellhead, who swam along beside the Marvel with a look of avid interest on his face.  “He’s just as Irish as I am, but he can do a high society accent just as pretty as you please. And Nat, his wife, she speaks all kinds of languages.  Her family came over from Russia. They were fur traders, or so she says. If you can believe her, they just walked right over and claimed an island for the Czar way up north in Alaska, then kept right on walking, I guess, and made their way across Canada to New York.  I don’t know if I believe all that, to be honest. She also once said she’s the illegitimate daughter of Alexander Romanov, the Russian Emperor, and she fled an arranged marriage. Nat’s hard to get a read on and tends to let other people do the talking. Kind of like you, Shellhead,” he added with a smile and a nod.
“You did say go,” Cam piped up.
“Or ‘Mine,’” Bruce added. Tony frowned, but clamped his mouth shut. “You can draw a heart around his name if it makes you feel better,” Bruce offered with a smirk.
It occurred to Steve that the balcony couldn’t be the most comfortable place for this kind of thing, not that Tony was complaining.  He figured he should probably suggest moving to the bed, and was honestly a little surprised Tony hadn’t made any mention of that yet, but Steve also wasn’t quite ready to stop kissing Tony, at least not until he had to, so he just tightened his hold under Tony’s head and gathered his other arm under Tony’s back and rolled them over, catching Tony’s yelp of surprise against his mouth.
“I forget, when you aren’t around so much, the many and varied reasons we don’t have you around so much,” Fury replied. “This is Avengers business, Stark, or believe me, I wouldn’t have called you in.”
The creature sometimes touched him, of course, but never with quite such...
Steve nodded.  “Peggy—” he started.
He stared up at the rusted trails that mapped the bottom of the top bunk.  Someone had carved “Leo was here—1997” into the tan paint.  Someone else had scratched over that and traced out, “Fuck you Leo” next to it.
“So, here it is,” Steve said, biting his lip to keep the smile off his face. “Only one in the world.  And it’s right here in Vegas.  Couldn’t let you miss out.”
“Tony?” Steve said, his head snapping back in confusion even as joy that bordered on relief burst inside his chest. Tony had come after all.  He must have been delayed, probably something important, some matter of state or…oh, Steve looked around in embarrassment as his mind caught up with his lapse.  He never called Tony by his given name in front of others, except for the team and perhaps Captain Rhodes.  “Sorry, I—Your Highness, I mean, I—wha…?  Where is…” he trailed off.  Lord Pierce wasn’t here.  He looked around with a frown, then cocked his head at Tony, who was lounging in a chair next to the hearth with one leg thrown over the wooden arm and the cushions scrunched up underneath him.  A bottle of something was cradled in the gap between his legs, the stopper off and a good portion of the contents gone.
The phrase ‘mind blowing’ gets thrown around a lot, but Steve could honestly say this was the first time he felt like his brain simply exploded into a puddle of useless goo and took all his words with it.  Tony was really--he was actually offering to--it just didn’t quite compute for a moment.  404 error, file not found, Steve thought with a bit of giddy hysteria.  This was...something people did for pornos, not in real life.  Right?  But, here, Tony was just...casually offering. Like it was nothing. Like he
“I’m Steve Rogers, by the way,” Steve said.
“Being an irresponsible asshole,” Tony muttered under his breath.
There was silence on the other end of the phone.
“It’ll ruin me.  It’ll ruin everything.  You know that.  They’ll blacklist me.  Company’s already struggling.  This…it’ll ruin things for him, too,” Howard said, voice steady now, whatever façade of sorrow or contrition he’d been attempting seeming to have faded entirely.
.  You and me, both, buddy, Tony thought, staring at the undulating lines curving around the figure clutching the sides of his face, mouth frozen in a silent shout.
Quit school.  Lost his job.  Not seen his friends other than a few times.  Mostly stopped working on his art.  Started working jobs he all but hated.  Burned through his savings.  Destroyed his credit.
"My squad was the first one there.  After everything.  Came looking for us when the convoy didn't check in at interval,” Steve said with a twist of his mouth.  “We didn’t do much except hold things together until the evac and trauma teams got there.  Wasn’t much we
“Thank you,” Steve said again. “Thank you so much.”
“Who are you? Really, who are you really?” Steve asked.
Want more Steve and Tony?  Find me on tumblr and twitter as sabrecmc. I'm also on the Stony Discord as sabrecmc#2925.  Thank you!!!!
He had no idea what Tony had in mind, but Steve trusted Tony to somehow know what he needed.  Sometimes, Steve thought Tony understood him better than he understood himself. I would have said I would hate this, hate him, he thought with a bright, sharp clarity like a blade cutting through the haze in his mind, but I don’t.  I don’t want to leave him. I don’t want to, but there’s a path through the mountains, and I think I have to take it. Sometimes, I wish I could be someone who didn’t have to. He blinked back the stinging in his eyes and looked up at Tony.  I have to go home, he thought, and for a moment, he had no idea what he meant.
"It has indeed been double-checked, sir," answered JARVIS. "And triple- and quadruple-checked, before you ask."
But Tony knew that the foot still bothered Steve on occasion, even without him saying so—which he never, ever did. Tony suspected that part of it might be psychological, as even if he never liked to show it, the month that Steve spent as a prisoner of HYDRA still deeply haunted him. Especially the part about how he was drugged so badly that it forced him to believe he was fighting against Tony, and that Tony hated him.
Tony shot him a frown. "I don't need you to babysit me. I'm perfectly capable with—"
"Oh, just another prank that Pietro and Wanda pulled on Uncle Clint while he was napping yesterday afternoon," answered Peter. "This time Wanda tried to film it, but Pietro's moving so fast all you can see is Uncle Clint's hair blowing in the breeze." He swallowed his mouthful, popping a stray marshmallow into his mouth. "Uncle Clint's face is pretty funny though. See?"
Peter's tongue poked out to wet his chapped lips. "Yeah. That sounds like loads of fun. Can't wait."
"Well, seeing as how you felt the need to carry me over here, I'd say that it is," Tony said between kisses. "So, hot stuff, what's the next part of your plan, hmm?"
"No," Steve said after another short pause. "But… I know that you're busy, and Clint—"
"Oh gods, Tony," Steve rasped. "There's nothing I want more."
I know this chapter is a bit shorter than the others, but I felt this was a good stopping place 😉  The next chapter will post by Friday, February 5th 😊
"Oh, just some school stuff, nothing too exciting," Peter said, keeping his eyes trained on his cutting board so Papa couldn't see them.
"Okay, okay, just hold on a second there," Steve said, raising his hand. This was starting to sound way too much like something out of one of Peter's movies. "'Cause it sounds like you're talking about a time machine."
"Yeah, okay, but I'm just trying to tell you that my father's not really like that," Gwen insisted. "He's just trying to do his job, and… I don't know, I guess he kinda felt threatened by you, is all."
And the fact that Gwen had been boasting about the length of her essay the other day at practise had absolutely nothing to do with Peter's renewed motivation. Absolutely nothing at all.
"Don't!" Tony yelped. "Don't you dare come near me! Just tell me what you've done to my son!"
As he had painfully learned in the past four years, life was far too unpredictable to not be with the people you love.
Which of course, they would then blame on him.
"Fine," he finally said. "But I'll have you know now that it'll be done under protest."
"I'm surprised your dads actually let you come here tonight, Prince Peter," Flash said before taking a big sip of his drink. "Don't they usually keep you locked in your room when you're not in school?"
Steve allowed himself a small smile. A promotion to Major would've meant a lot more to him a few months ago, when he wasn't busy planning a complete overthrow of the military government. He honestly hadn't given a lot of thought to how the military might look afterwards, once all the dust had settled, but at the moment he didn't much care. All that mattered to him was keeping his family safe, with Peter being able to have his operation at the very top of the list.
Lost because Tony couldn't bear to even think about attempting to face a world where his son was dead, and now—
"The drones are just about ready," Tony finally murmured against Steve's collarbone. "I've run every possible scenario that JARVIS and I can think of on 'em, so…"
Ignoring his thudding heart, Tony simply nodded.  “Yep,” he said softly.  “Be safe, yeah?”
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, pinching the bridge of his nose. It was already close to three in the afternoon, which meant that he only had about another hour before he and Steve would need to pick Peter up from school, and he had been fiddling with this targeting system for pretty much the last three days straight, only pausing when Steve managed to cajole him into eating something.
"Unfortunately, Captain, I am unaware of the location of the other two stones," Thor said sadly. "Or rather, three, now that the Mind Stone has been taken. Both the Power Stone and the Time Stone remain hidden even to me. But I must reaffirm my desire to remove the tesseract from this place as soon as it is feasible. Having two stones in one place is far too dangerous, especially with the risk it presents to your people."
A pause followed, one that stretched just a couple seconds too long.
Apparently the Stark men had a type, as even Peter's grandma had had blonde hair.
Tony’s lower lip trembled as he cupped Steve’s face in his hands, pressing another soft kiss to his lips.
"I wish I could help you more," Peter mumbled. "Maybe then you wouldn't worry about everything so much."
"Peter?" Papa asked, his eyebrows knitting together. "It's okay, little guy, you can tell me."
Tony was so completely fried that he could practically smell colours, so he knew he wasn't exactly in the best mindset to process all of the weird-ass things that had happened in the last few minutes. That's why when Mantis suddenly began to disintegrate right before his eyes, Tony just assumed it was just some kind of funky remnant effect left over from the Reality Stone, or something like that.
"Cap, we need another option here," Sam said as he flew overhead. "Anything we're able to do just gets fixed as soon as the damn thing moves again."
Which meant he had just enough left over to get an ice cream cone for the walk home.
Peter smiled, his first real smile of the day. "I didn't think it would. I can't wait for you to see it, I think you'll really like it."
"It's all gonna be over soon, right?" he said. "Soon as the mission's over we'll be able to get Pete fixed up, and then he'll be as good as new."
He had made it, and was still in one piece. So far things seemed to be going well.
overprotective, something that Peter hadn't thought possible. With Dad out in New Asgard trying to figure out how to repair Uncle Thor's spaceship for the last week and a half, Papa had even started coming inside the school to watch the last few minutes of their Decathlon practises instead of just waiting out in the parking lot like he used to. He'd stand there in the doorway of the gym with his arms crossed over his front in his "concerned Papa pose", eyeing Peter like he was afraid he was going to disappear right in front of his eyes or something.
yes!"
"We're now at one hundred percent," Howard called as the entire room shook like an earthquake, the rest of lights flickering. "Five… four… three… two… one… stop! Kill the reactor!"
"But… why?" Steve asked, frowning. "Surely there's—"
"Except they had no idea how powerful it would be," said Tony. "Because the only person who had any inkling of it was my father, and they never asked him."
Steve ended up taking three more trips over the course of the next eight days as Tony continued to fine-tune the coordinates. It was slow, difficult work, continuously trying both of their patience levels as it was much like searching for a needle in an infinitely-large haystack.
No, this was the bone-chilling kind.
Whatever Phillips was going to say next was interrupted by the appearance of Carol's X-302 as it pulled into the hangar, followed closely on its tail by Steve. Tony had finished his simulator session with Major Lorne and Captain Wilson a bit earlier than usual that day, which meant that he was able to get back to the hangar in time to watch Steve disembark from his aircraft for the first time since they started dating two weeks ago.
"Um… that's—that's good," Tony choked past the lump in his throat. "So… what has Pete told you about Project Phoenix?"
Steve sighed heavily, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He should've known.
“Oh, God.  I can’t even imagine,” Dad choked out, his eyes filling with tears.  “No wonder he wants to forget.”
Peter sniffed, nodding against Steve's chest. "Uh huh, Papa."
"Fine! Then open the door!"
“Okay, so now this piece,” Peter said, holding up the piece shaped like a rearing horse, “is called a knight, and it moves in an L-shape.  Like this.”  He proceeded to demonstrate the very movement on the board.  “I like to save these pieces until later since they’re pretty powerful, but my Uncle James likes to take ‘em out pretty early, so it’s up to you.”
"No, probably not," agreed Steve. "But the biggest question now is, why? Widows of other pilots who were killed in action during the very same battle were given support, and so have most of the widows since then. So why wasn't Ma? What made her case different?"
"Eh, I don't think so," Steve said as he nuzzled Tony's temple. "If you know, there's really no sense in waiting. Is there?"
A sort of uneasy silence fell over the team as Steve and Tony exchanged loaded glances. From what Steve had seen in the parallel universe, Peter had had every intention of fighting with them in the battle, and he couldn't imagine that their own son would be any different.
Peter deserved far better than to have to grow up under the putrid shadow of Howard Stark, like he'd been forced to do.
And while Steve could certainly understand that sentiment, he was very concerned about its execution. In his eyes, Tony seemed to have come to the conclusion that he was somehow personally responsible for the alien invasion, and therefore now needed to do whatever it took to prevent it or something similar from happening again.
Starks," Phillips stated. "Peter Stark is Howard Stark's grandson."
"Yep," agreed Clint. "Let's do it."
"Are you sure?" he said again, grimacing as he realised he sounded like a scratched record. "That's… well… I mean… that's a pretty big thing, so—"
Steve pursed his lips. Ma had been stubborn too, and look where it had gotten her.
"Yeah." Peter was just leaning in for another kiss when Gwen's outside light suddenly turned on, nearly causing him to hit the ceiling of the car. "Uhh, I guess you've gotta go."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Uhh, yeah, that—that makes sense," Scott said, nodding rapidly. "Um… good thing I brought the suit with."
Sam huffed out a sharp breath, nodding. "All right. Clint, you and Nat should take off ASAP, but make a couple stops on the way, don't be too direct. I'll get in touch with Stacy and make sure he's still game, then we'll all converge in Savannah once you and Rhodey get there. You got that drone firing range extended yet?""
"Okay, then how about this?" Steve said. "How about after Christmas, you, me, and Peter take the jet out to Ireland for New Year's. We've all been working our asses off since the school year started, and I think we could use a break."
He paused for a moment to catch his breath, brushing the damp hair out of his eyes and frowning at the blood-tinged wrap stretched across his knuckles. He knew Tony was going to tell him that he'd overdone it again, with that worried look on his face that Steve always dreaded, but at the moment he didn't care. He needed to be both mentally and physically ready to face the Armed Services Committee in the morning, and smashing the hell out of a few punching bags was one of the best ways for him to do that.
"Um… hey there, JARVIS," he said haltingly. "How's it going?"
"Damnit, Steve, I'm ready!" Tony said on a gasp as Steve carefully worked him open, all the while pressing kisses to every available bit of flesh he could reach. "Please, baby, now you're just teasing me!"
"No!" he croaked, completely frozen in place as Tony gritted his teeth, his entire body shaking with the effort of controlling the stones.
So instead, he said, “Have an awesome weekend, Steve!  I’ll see ya soon!”
Peter's eyebrows knitted together in confusion. "Uhh, thanks, but my heart's not strong. It's kinda all busted up."
"Uh huh," Peter said, his narrow shoulders sagging in defeat. "Good thing it's a Saturday, hmm? So I can help you?"
"You know Mr Harrington's gonna be gushing all over your dads once we get there," Ned said as he finished his milk, crushing the carton in his hand. "I kinda feel bad for them."
And soon enough, thanks to his BARF tech—
“Not until the job is finished, Mr Stark,” she’d said.  Which, given Sokovia’s wretched history, would likely be about the twelfth of never.
And for someone who had long-ago sworn off ever falling in love or having a family, it was very, very unnerving.
His grin grew wider as he took one of Papa's knights. "But I think I can still beat you in chess."
"All right, we'll work on that when we can," Sam said from the opposite side of the prison. "Just keep Steve secure in the meantime, yeah?"
"Sounds good, Ned," Gwen said. "I can't wait to see it."
buy a new bat.
Dad let out a sigh as he glanced in Peter’s direction, grimacing as Peter hoisted himself up off the floor.
"Do you think you can get the prince to safety?" he asked as the guard T'Challa had referred to as General Okoye rushed forward, her face twisted in worry.
“Steve,” Steve says.  He tips Tony’s chin up to look at him.  “I’m not Captain America down here, right?  Not now.”
"All right," he said quietly. "But let me clear this with King T'Challa first, okay? I want to reassure him that the Soul Stone will be returned to his people as soon as we're done using it."
"There's the magic word, honey," Tony murmured, now planting kisses all along the length of Steve's cock. And then,
"Did you see what happened?" he demanded of the poor sergeant, who was staring up at Steve with wide eyes and raised hands, as if he was afraid that Steve would suddenly keel over. "The beam, did you see where it came from?"
Steve watched Peter carefully as he headed towards the rows of single flowers, carefully selecting two pretty pink tulips and a cute white teddy bear and bringing them over to the checkout line. It still unnerved him a bit to have Peter out in such a crowded public place with just he and Bucky as backup, but he was trying hard to not give into his irrational fear. This was a completely normal errand, Sam had reminded him, and it was time that he stopped being so afraid of normalcy.
"Maybe a little bit less chatter up there, guys, all right?" Steve said over the comm. Tony immediately whipped around, grunting in relief as he located Steve about ten or so metres away, fighting a group of Chitauri in a triangle formation with Bucky and Thor. The whole time they had been fighting, Tony had had to remind himself that Thanos didn't have the Soul Stone yet, and that their current main objective was to ensure that he didn't get it.
"Which means all those other dudes are probably the ones searching for the stone then," said Sam. "Right?"
"Dad, Papa," Peter said with a wide smile, his voice trembling ever-so-slightly as he held out his right hand. "I'm—I'm okay."
"I love you too, honey," Tony whispered. He slid his palms up Steve's arms and shoulders to cup his face. "Just… promise me that you're not gonna go diving out of any highrise windows this time, okay? 'Cause there's absolutely no need for that kind of drama."
"There'd be no way to fire the engine and return to the orbit?" asked Steve. "It seems to me that as long as you had a fixed point of reference it should be okay."
"Guys, ladies, this is it," he began. "All our lives have been leading to this single point in time, converging right here, on this very moment. You see, for over twenty-eight years the citizens of our country have been nothing but pawns being moved across a massive chessboard, positioned to protect the king and queen. Only in this game, there’s never a chance to actually win because the people playing keep changing the rules. Field borders are redrawn, goalposts are moved, and stakes are changed almost constantly as more and more of the pawns, knights, and bishops are sacrificed." Steve paused, glancing around his circle of teammates who were all intently listening.
"Well, the hits just keep on coming, hmm?" Sam said once Natasha's screen went blank. "I know you said this was supposed to be diplomatic, but are you still thinking standard mission op, Cap?"
But as soon as Peter heard Uncle Bucky's footsteps heading down the hallway, he reached over to the bedside table, grabbing the datapad that he'd left behind. Before the coup, Peter had been able to break through the Air Corps firewall in less than three minutes, so he figured it would be even easier this time.
"No, he's not dead," said Green Lady. "He took off in our pod before we went to Knowhere."
Tony was one lucky man.
"Uh huh," Peter said as his mask closed over his head. He quickly shot out a web, swinging into position almost directly above Dr Strange. "I'm ready, Dad."
"Yeah," Steve said with a rather emphatic nod. "It makes perfect sense."
"Uhh, why not?" asked Peter. "Who was it?"
“I’d be happy to, Mr Stark,” replied Sam, his eyes never leaving Obie’s face.  “I counsel veterans from all five branches who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Also known as PTSD.”
"You sure? I'm sure we could find a few plebes roaming around that wouldn't mind a little three-on-three?" said Bucky, eyeing Steve suspiciously. "You seem like you still have plenty of steam to let off."
"Oh my God," Steve breathed as his heart started to thud. "Aren't those the same words that Bucky kept mumbling when we first brought him to the Tower?"
“You should get some sleep,” Steve suggested.  He lay down himself, though sleep didn’t come easily.  His thoughts were too muddled, swirling around and smashing together like waves on rocks.  He looked over at Cam, snoring softly where he curled on his pallet.  At least, Steve thought, he had done something good in this God-forsaken place.   For however long it lasted.  That was the question though, wasn’t it?  How long would this reprieve stand?  Did the King really not realize Lord Stane’s depravity or was he only looking the other way to avoid a scandal?  Or did he simply not care?  They were only slaves, after all, and what king bothered with their fates unless it directly affected him?  The King hadn’t been concerned with Steve, after all, except that he hadn’t been available when he wanted him.
And Steve had missed him.
“I can’t believe I’m having this conversation with you.  He’d think of the airlock.  Besides, are you Newt here?  Get away from him, you bitch?” Rhodey asked.
The elevator dinged and the doors slid open. Steve gave Tony a quick look, then reached for his hand, grasping it tightly.  There were only a few people milling about, but Steve could feel heads turn as they passed by.  There was a change in the air, an awareness of him that he had gotten used to not having except when he was up on stage, under lights bright enough he didn’t have to see their faces if he didn’t want to.
“Okay, so,” Nat said pointedly, making eyes at the group until they said their goodbyes and dispersed, with Bucky shooting Steve a long look over his shoulder and grinning maniacally as Nat dragged him off.
.  That maybe more than you know depends on it.  If you would only bend, just a
“Caesar’s,” Steve said.
The driver opened the side door and placed a small step below it to allow Steve and Cam to climb inside.  Alongside them, a number of guards, outriders and their squires gathered, including, Steve noticed, General Rhodes, who waited at the front, along with who appeared to be the City Marshall by the look of the insignia pin that held his cape to his shoulder.  Steve could feel a number of gazes travel over him as he sat down, with Cam across from him, though their eyes slid across him like the wind over blades of grass, never staying long.
“That’s one way of stating it,” Tony said, sounding somewhat begrudging with the praise.   His voice was low and worn from overuse. He sounded tired. More than just from the weariness of travel.  He fidgeted against Steve’s side. The hand that was claiming Steve’s stomach started tracing a pattern, and Steve could hear a slight hitch in Tony’s breath, though he remained quiet for a long while.  “Damn it,” he snapped all of a sudden, pushing himself up and raking his hand through his hair, then dropping it down next to him on the bed in a fist.
“You have already given me all I require, my beautiful one,” Tony whispered, a smile trying to form, but seemingly unable to take hold. He opened his mouth to say more, then slammed it shut and dropped his eyes for a moment, mouth flattening in some kind of internal war before looking back at Steve, expression guarded now.  “Come. Bath, first, then I will let you show me your regard all evening,” he said with a grin that for a heartbeat looked like a skull with the skin pulled back over the teeth.  Steve blinked and shook his head, stepping away enough to allow Tony to pass by him.
I'm on tumblr, if you're interested.  Stony, complaining about writing and now, Star Wars.  sabrecmc.tumblr.com.
“Good,” Steve said. “Ah, thanks for the paints, by the way.  It’s an amazing set.  You really didn’t have to do that.”
Movement out of the corner of his eye had Steve looking up, across the room, where a white-coated waiter pointed Steve’s way.  Behind a couple being seated and another waiter with a tray full of silver-domed entrees, Steve could see a dark head bob, and then suddenly the sea of people parted and Steve’s stomach lurched, then sank as recognition hit. Well.  Natasha hadn’t been lying about the rich, smart and good-looking parts, that was one thing, Steve thought with a flash of annoyance, though a good portion of it was directed at himself for not seeing through the ruse.
“Thank you,” Steve said. Without thinking, he turned and braced his arms on either side of Tony’s head, leaned down and placed a kiss to Tony’s brow.  He felt Tony tense, almost as if in surprise, then go languid under him as he pulled back and gazed down.  Tony’s eyes were wide, clear, his mouth parted in a silent gasp.
“Um. So, I seem to be out of filters,” Steve said, continuing to frown in the direction of the coffee machine, as if he could somehow guilt the machine into submission. Would probably work in most situations, Tony had to acknowledge as he rubbed the towel at the back of his head, trying to get his hair to dry. Looked like a puppy after someone took his ball away, Tony thought with a light chuff of a laugh. What power in the universe could resist?
“So, just to be clear here.  You carjacked, injured and kidnapped one of the only people on Cap’s list?  How stupid are you two?” Sam asked incredulously.
“Private plane didn’t do it for you, it was the hair?” Tony asked, tilting his head around to catch Steve’s eye.
The monitors overhead finished a version of ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight,’ and Steve was almost startled when Elvis’ rich, deep baritone filtered into the pod through the speakers.
“You want to go swimming?” Steve responded, his voice slow as he tried to wrap his head around what Tony was saying.
Steve was sure he must be leaving bruises on Tony’s hips, while the other man ground against him, utterly unbothered by Steve’s grip.  He wanted more. More of Tony, more of Tony’s mouth and hands, more of everything. He wanted to take, to consume, to devour all of it, everything Tony was offering and then some.  All of it, everything, he wanted--
“It's an omelet,” Tony explained, giving the dark glob of former egg a frown. “With spinach. And kale. Because, kale, I guess.” Maybe he should mention the ketchup again.
He had said that before, but never managed to follow through.  They both knew he wouldn’t follow through this time, either, so Steve just nodded.   This place held too much of Jarvis.  He had a chair at the table, that they both knew was his and kept empty, though it never felt entirely empty, not in the way that empty meant nothing there.   There was yellow tea cozy they never used, but kept in the drawer with the oven mitts.   There was a copy of Arsenic and Old Lace on the DVD shelf that they never watched.  Tony would never bring JARVIS here.  He didn’t need to.
“Huh?  Oh, yeah, sure,” Tony said, taking the ring and slowly sliding it onto Steve’s finger.  He squeezed the sides, and the capsule closed on the tiny bot.
“You talk of--of power and control.  Influence. Birthright. In the Free--back home, the only legitimate power flows from the consent of the governed.  Every person of majority can cast their lot for who they want to lead them,” Steve said, nearly forgetting that Tony didn’t care for him to talk about the Free States, at least not about the politics, at any rate.
“Well…I told him what I saw, which, ya know, looked pretty, uh…familiar there…and that he ought to talk to you about it.  I didn’t…you have to believe me here…I didn’t think it would be this bad.  I mean, it never has before…he never…not like this.   If I’d known, I woulda kept my big mouth shut.  I wouldn’t…not on purpose…Look, Steve, I’m just sorry, okay?  I messed up.  But I just couldn’t watch him get hurt. But…I think maybe he would’ve been happier not knowing, even if it was true," Happy told him, clearly embarrassed and appalled by how things had turned out.
“Th—thank you, Your Highness,” Cam stammered, gazing up at Tony with what amounted to awe on his young face.
“Again,” Tony breathed out, his voice ragged.
“The lack of oxygen had already significantly impaired your cognitive functions beyond what I could repair without the Gift.  I needed to determine if you were able to receive the Gift. Many species cannot,” the alien said. “And...you were in pain. Near death.  The ship’s medical provisions could only do so much, given the...uniqueness of your condition,” he added, nodding towards Tony’s chest. “I did not want you to suffer. A Giver can...take the pain from you. It is part of who we are.”
“He might have called,” Tony admitted carefully.  “Said you’d agreed to sign up with SHIELD.  I thought we’d talked about waiting.  Just a bit longer.  You’re not—it’s barely been two months since the invasion, and you’re—you know.”
But, Hydra was different, Steve knew.  It was a different kind of warfare that Shmidt and his ilk brought with them, with their blasting cannons and the black powder that burned with such force it could tear holes through rock.  The wall is a shield, but it is not impenetrable, and can be breached, whether through it or under it, and once that happens, it is nearly impossible to shift defenses quickly enough to prevent invaders from making their way inside, simply due to relative numbers.
“’M not hungry,” Cam mumbled into his pallet and pulled his arms over his head.
“Oh, I like him,” Rhodes said to Tony, amusement lacing his voice.
“No, not like Sudoku,” Tony snapped in agitated annoyance.  “Millennium Problems.  Not who Taylor’s dating, what Zayn’s up to, massive debt or a fucked-up environment kind of problems.  See, there are these seven problems the Clay Mathematics Institute put out back in 2000, and no one’s solved them. One of them, the Riemann Hypothesis is from 1859, and we still can’t figure it out, so they put these out there, with a million-dollar prize attached to each, to celebrate the millennium, and you were screwing with me on the Sudoku thing, weren’t you?”
Granted, none of that perfectly logical bit of rationalization explained the way it felt like a kick in the gut, momentarily knocking the air out of him and leaving him reeling, like he'd just been picked last for a game he didn't even want to play.
“I'm caught in a loop in the Matrix,” Tony observed as Happy slid the car next to the curb in front of Steve's building. Again.
He made his way to his private suite and went to the bathroom sink, washing the grease off his hands and splashing some of the cold water on his face and tossed the half-eaten cheeseburger in the trash.  He’d lost whatever appetite he’d momentarily managed to have.
“A house to retire in,” Tony replied dully.  “You could put one of those plastic flamingos in the yard.  Make the neighbors hate you.”
“What are you doing?” Steve asked, watching Rhodes face flatten into a grimace before he stalked off and out the gymnasium’s doors.
It was heady, all this at once, making Steve feel a bit light-headed, like he had been spinning in place just a moment too long, but God, it was so good.  He hadn’t known it could feel like this in real life, but here he was, moaning like one of those guys in those videos Brock liked to watch.
He watched Tony, half-lidded, enjoying the feeling of giving this to Tony. The deep, wondrous pleasure of being Tony’s in some primal way that Steve’s body seemed to recognize was right.  He gave in to it. Let it take him. Let Tony take him. Arching his back and pushing down against Tony’s thrusts, he tightened his muscles around Tony in the way he knew Tony loved, earning a gasp from Tony that quickly devolved into a groan.
“You did?” Tony asked, absurdly pleased by the thought. “Well, won’t hurt to hear it again.” Steve sighed, but didn’t protest further as Jarvis read through the Time Magazine article. Tony gently massaged Steve’s lower back and thighs, then up and down the curve of Steve’s spine until the muscles went lax under his ministrations. Steve hummed appreciatively as Tony handed him a pillow for his head.
exhausted,” Tony said, then punctuated the admission with a yawn. He reached out and stroked a hand through Steve’s hair. “And how are you, my beautiful one?”
“Not right away, anyway. I’ll be there for the wedding, of course,” Bucky clarified. “I need to go home. Brookland. Bruce said it was safe now. I’m a Lord now, after all. I should see what I’m Lord of, I suppose,” Bucky said, voice tight and raw with all the words he wasn’t saying clawing to get out. “I—I need to go, Steve. I need to see it. Them. I need to see them.”
“Does she now? That seems unlikely, as I was a model student, the finest she had ever taught. I am most sure of that, for I heard her tell my father the same many times,” Tony hummed, biting at his lip to keep from smiling.
what I’m here for. I have all the time in the world.”
“Holy shit,” Tony said in a shaky voice. He blinked rapidly, licked his tongue along his lips in a seemingly unconscious gesture that was far more seductive than anything he had tried before, and looked up at Steve with a wobbly, almost shy smile.
Last night had not gone as he had expected.
“So-sorry.  Sorry.  I…that’s…I’m…I’ll just,” he motioned to grab a Kleenex from the nightstand, but Tony stopped him and got up from the bed, and great, just great, could this be more humiliating?  Tony returned a moment later with a soft towel, which, okay that was nice, he supposed, reaching for it, but Tony batted his hand away and bent to start gently cleaning Steve’s belly and thighs.  Steve had no idea what to say or do, so he just lay there watching Tony as he finished his task.  The towel quickly joined Tony’s tux on the floor and Steve had to bite the inside of his lip to stop himself from saying something about that.
“Eh-eh-eh, please no.  Where’s the mute button?” Tony mumbled, pulling Steve back against his chest and cutting off what was sure to be an epic baby bitchfest.  “Um, because you can be called Daddy without it being kinky?” Tony called out to Clint, who ignored him.
Steve stared at the room behind Tony’s shoulder, filled with the things Tony couldn’t help but give him, tokens big and small. Steve had once seen them as Tony’s attempts to purchase something that should be freely given, but he had long since realized there was nothing sought in trade. He had not understood, until Captain Rhodes pointed it out rather baldly, that these things were not intended to obligate, but were the ways Tony was able to feel connected to those he cared for, the ways he repaid a debt that only he counted as owed.
“I’m gonna fuck up, Steve,” Tony mumbled into the curve of Steve’s neck almost too softly for even Steve to hear.  Tony’s body went rigid beneath him, then Tony lifted his head, letting his chin scrape along the column of Steve’s throat as he put some space between them, sending a  shudder through Steve’s body in response.  “We both know that.”
"Your new suit's in the closet, honey," Tony murmured as Steve pulled on a clean pair of underwear. "And I can't wait to see it on you."
Steve smiled as he watched him race out of the kitchen, rolling his shoulders to try and loosen his stress-tight muscles. It had been a long time since he'd driven Peter to school on his motorcycle. With Peter's body temp instability combined with the rather finicky spring that New York had had so far, it just hadn't been warm enough to do so until now.
"Thor?" he asked, clutching his side. "Where'd he go?"
Papa had been having enough trouble sleeping for all three of them lately, and Dad didn't need to add Peter's nightmares on top of everything else that he was worried about.
"Papa!" Peter whimpered, quickly cut off by the
"Thank you, Miss Stacy," said the teacher. "Let's begin."
“Pete!  JARVIS says the pizza’s gonna be here in about five minutes!” Dad suddenly yelled from the kitchen.
Stepping closer to Dr Strange, Thanos smiled slightly. "I take it the Maw is dead?"
Ned scoffed. "Oh, our Decathlon team is way better than theirs!"
Steve lets out a sigh as he takes a sip of his juice.  He supposes he may as well tell her, since she somehow always manages to find out anyway.
"Uh huh. Love you too." As soon as the screen went blank, Peter flopped backwards onto his bed, only narrowly missing the corner of one of his textbooks with his head.
But Doctor List only smiled, a wide, leering smile as he nodded towards the young woman, who the whole time had been standing as still as a statue, her face completely blank.
Steve shook his head. "No, of course I haven't. I just…"
And also the three broken drawer handles in the kitchen, so many exploding tubes of toothpaste that he had lost count, two broken seatbelts in Uncle Sam's car, and no less than three torn shoelaces.
Just like he’d been when he had grilled Tony about the printers, Obie was sitting in his office, leaning back in his chair and surrounded by his thick cloud of cigar smoke.  He had sat there for several seconds after Tony arrived, just staring at him with that disgusted expression on his face that Tony had come to loathe.
every time the elevator opens and closes.
Steve quickly cleared his throat.  “Yeah, little guy, I’m fine.  You just look so… grown up tonight.”
“You're not gonna believe who I met today, Ashes,” Steve murmured as he squinted against the last of the evening sunbeams reflecting off the tower.  Ashes glanced up at him, her nose twitching as she responded with a rather bored-sounding
"Yep. And his time." Just like Gwen knew that Peter was Spider-Man, she was also one of the few people who knew the truth about Uncle Bucky, that he'd been Papa's friend since they were kids, and that he had been a prisoner of HYDRA for over sixty years.
"It's one of her colleagues at the U-GIN group, Tony, who's already been vetted by Fury at least three times," Uncle Bruce said. "And you know that we've both taken extra precautions to remove all possible identifying characteristics. The only people who'll know who we're talking about are the team and Nick Fury."
"S'eve? What's—okay?" Tony mumbled as he shifted under Steve's arm, turning to face him. Guilt flashed through Steve's body like a flare as Tony's eyes struggled to blink open, finally giving up as his palm thudded on Steve's shoulder. "What's—what's—?"
It was amusing, Tony thought as he made his way towards Peter's bedroom, finding Steve sitting in the armchair while Peter brushed his teeth. There was a time when he would've been appalled at the thought of not being in New York City on New Years Eve. Not that Tony had ever gone out to Times Square or anything, but hosting a hot party at the Four Seasons that ended with a girl—or guy—or two inside his lavish suite once all was said and done… well, that's what was typical for Tony Stark back in the day. Complete with his face plastered across the front page of every gossip paper and magazine in print.
"Yes," he repeated. He turned in his chair, locking eyes with Colonel Phillips. "We did it, Colonel. The tesseract is working."
"Thank you," Steve said, so sincerely that Tony couldn't even bring himself to chastise him.
Finally, after what seemed like hours, the screen flickered, displaying a perfectly clean document.  Peter quickly began to skim it over, realising only a few lines in that instead of it being his mother’s employee file, it was… something else.
"Um, you guys aren't in there getting frisky, are ya? We're all ready to get the hell outta here!"
"And we are in test-mode, right J?" Tony asked, licking his lips. Despite the circumstances, he was almost as excited as he'd been when he'd built his very first suit.
"Steve, I just want you," Tony murmured as Steve fiddled with the button and zipper on his pants. "All of you."
"No, no, I've already done too much that way, and they're gonna start suspecting it soon if they haven't already. Stark may be an asshole, but he's not stupid. We're just gonna have to figure out something else."
But he was cut off by a massive crashing sound, followed immediately by three repulsor blasts and several gunshots. Hammer jumped back with a frightened, "Whoa!" just as Peter pulled himself to his feet, stumbling towards the window of his cell and pounding his palm against it.
Sam shot him a wide smile. "Well, I don't know, Cap. I guess you'll just have to come and watch the games so you can see for yourself."
"Should be good now, honey," Tony added. "JARVIS isn't picking up any heat signatures 'cept ours now."
And it's not like they could just put the battle on pause while they got him to safety either.
Maybe because it was one of those things that was just too indescribable for words?
Tony thought as he inhaled a shaky breath.
The group was silent as they headed down the long hallway towards Obie’s office, the slight
Tony immediately grinned, taking Steve's face in his hands and kissing a path to his ear, whispering, "How 'bout I suck you off first, baby, yeah? Help take the edge off a bit?"
But, according to what Peter understood from the files, the HYDRA scientist Doctor List was still working with the CTX-616 form, which meant that he was basically trying to replicate Killian's super-soldier experiments while still retaining the memory-wiping effects.
But Bruce only shook his head. "Steve, it's—
"Whew!" Peter said a few seconds later as he slowly lowered himself from the ceiling. "That was close!"
Apparently he'd been wrong.
"Very good, sir."
And the fact that he was Tony's friend didn't really help Rhodey's cause either. While not entirely unheard of, it was rare indeed for members of the military to fraternise with civilians, especially those in the higher ranks like Rhodey and Colonel Phillips. And while Tony didn't consider Crotchety Phillips a friend—more like a barely-tolerated colleague—he knew without a doubt that he'd be completely lost without what little support Rhodey could give him.
"No, not a goddamn thing," Sam said angrily. "I was up there sweeping the skies while Clint and Bucky covered the entire perimeter of the lake, but we didn't find anything out of the ordinary and neither did the reconnaissance suits. Plus, all the ice is completely gone now and the air temp's back to normal, so it's like it never even happened."
"Thank you, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he lifted his head, pressing a soft kiss to Tony's lips. "That was… unbelievable!"
"Well, yeah," answered Tony. "I mean, Obie had been drilling it into my head pretty much from the very second I found out that my parents had been killed that I had to keep on doing what Howard had been doing, or I'd end up being an even bigger disappointment to him than I already was."
"Steve, you've gotta make it back. You've just got to, 'cause I can't—I just can't live—and Pete—honey, he misses you so much, and—"
"Yeah, it was around this time of year that he got out," Dad said softly. "But that's still no excuse for what he did, Pete, and he had no business coming up here and putting you in danger. Absolutely none."
Fury sighed, shifting on his fancy desk chair.  “Look, Tony, I know you won’t believe me when I say that we’re doing all that we can to locate Captain Rogers, but—”
"You keep shooting off your mouth like that and I'll toss you right into that lake when we get there," Sam retorted. He shot Bucky a wink, squeezing his knee. "Something tells me that we might be spending a bit of time there on occasion, though, long as you guys don't mind. It sure is a nice place."
"So, when does your papa get his new cast off?" Gwen asked as they walked down the hall to History after lunch, Ned having made a beeline for Betty's locker as soon as the bell rang.
"I wish I knew what was best, little guy," Papa said. "I wish I knew if it was safer for you and Dad to stay here with me or if it was better to send you away, but I don't. I wish I knew exactly who outside of our family we can trust, but I don't. Right now the only thing that I do know, is the very thing that I've been most afraid of ever since that battle in the Miami bunker is now spelled out right here in black and white, which means that my contingency plans have to start taking shape a lot sooner than I originally thought, and—"
to channel Papa, and doing a scarily remarkable job of it.
"It's just not fair!" Peter sobbed, curled into a tight ball on the floor while Gwen rubbed his shoulder. "He should be here, and they just took him away from us!"
Tony's eyebrows shot up, and he glanced at Steve, shrugging. "Oh, well, speak of the devil. Go ahead and put her through, J."
Tony thought bitterly.
"Uh huh?"
Tears pricked Tony's eyes, and for a heartbeat or three he had to fight the almost overwhelming instinct to look away. Steve had always worn his heart on his sleeve. From pretty much the first moment Tony laid eyes on him, he could tell what Steve was thinking and feeling, even as he tried to deny it. And sometimes… well… sometimes Steve was just so transparent that Tony was almost overwhelmed by it. The amount of love that Tony could see every single day in Steve's beautiful eyes and his gorgeous smile, and feel in every single one of his tender touches… he sometimes felt that if he wasn't careful, he just might end up drowning in it.
Reaching behind him, Steve tugged the t-shirt over his head and tossed it aside, his breath catching when Tony palmed his biceps, stroking up to his shoulders and down to his pecs, his thumbs brushing lightly across his nipples.
It was James, still in his War Machine armour.
Peter let out an involuntary shudder at the memory of
"Oh, it's just a saying from a show that I liked when I was really little, before the government took it away," Peter said quickly. "It basically means that you just gotta keep on going until things get better." He paused, again weighing his next words carefully. "And you've still got one arm to hold Uncle Sam with, right?"
Surprisingly, Dad and Papa hadn't given Peter a hard time for wanting to go with Gwen alone. He had prepared an entire argument complete with written rebuttals in case they tried to play one of their whole overprotective-dad cards again, but to Peter's shock, when he finally got up the courage to bring it up at dinner the week before, his dads only had one of their silent, eyebrow-quirking conversations and then told him yes, as long as Peter promised he would be extra careful.
"I think we should ask Bucky, see what he says," Steve finally said. "He may not want the entire team watching while we try and trigger him, so… if he says no, then we'll just tell Peter no."
"Or… we could go on a holiday," Steve said, and Tony's head snapped up in surprise, his eyes going wide as he tried to figure out if Steve was joking or not.
"I had my reasons," snapped Phillips. "Not the least of which was not wanting to upset Sarah any more than she was already. The serum was sound and the procedure was foolproof. Stark's involvement with its development was not necessary information."
Again, Peter shook his head, grabbing onto Steve's right arm and yanking it forward as Doctor List stepped inside the cell, a long silver syringe in his hand.
"How's it looking over there, Tony?" Colonel Phillips asked, leaning back in his chair. "Seems like those first two satellites went off without a hitch."
"Yeah, but once you figured out that Steve wasn't just some random pilot?" asked Tony. "What about then?"
you, sir!” Steve shot back before Tony could respond.  “How
"Oh," Bucky said as he looked away, so softly that Tony had to strain to hear him. "Хауард liked cars too."
"At inappropriate times," Steve finished. He pressed his lips to Tony's forehead, trailing his fingertip across Tony's cheekbone. "Yes, I do. Now, are you ready?"
Fury hadn't been able to tell Tony exactly what kind of research was being conducted in the destroyed building, only that the Wakandan king had been touring the hospital next door when an explosive device detonated, killing at least thirty people and wounding almost a hundred more. As soon as news of the explosion broke, Fury reached out to the Wakandan delegation, offering the Avengers' personal assistance in discovering the identity of the perpetrators, an offer that the king's son, Prince T'Challa, said he would take under advisement.
"Who, me? Nah," said Hammer. "But while
"No," Steve said firmly as he shifted Tony onto his lap, cursing the fact that he was still wearing pants. He brushed his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss, gliding his palms up and down the soft, olive skin of his back and sides. "No apologies, okay? We're here now, and that's all that matters."
With a tentative smile Tony took Steve's hand, a shock of warmth sparking inside his chest when Steve's warm fingers closed around his.
“Uh huh,” Peter said.  Taking the backpack’s strap from Tony, Peter turned, preparing to swing it onto his back, just like he always did.
"But lowering his body temp would help him not need as much oxygen," said Peter. "And it would lower his metabolism a bit too. Maybe they could tell Papa to—"
His entire life had just been broken apart into a million shattered pieces, and it was all his fault.
"Uh huh."
He had far more important things to worry about at the moment.
"Uh huh," Peter said as he shuffled out of the room, with Tony's shoulders sagging once he was out of sight. He should've known Peter would ask him something like that, and he honestly couldn't blame him. He couldn't imagine what it must be like, knowing that someone had wrapped a noose around your subconscious and could tighten it at whim.
"Yeah, Stevie," replied Bucky. "Me too."
Gwen smiled, hugging her books even tighter. "Great! Um… would tomorrow be okay? You could just come home with me after practise, and we could work on homework until dinner time, if that sounds okay."
"No, just… hear me out, okay?" Tony sucked in a deep breath, his fingers tightening around Steve's. It had taken all of his willpower and then some to not race down to the hangar the second he saw Steve stumbling down his ladder.
"Okay, sounds good," he said. "And yeah, Phillips has already dismissed me for the day, so I'm ready."
"No, no, we're not gonna have any kind of talk like that," Tony said firmly. "And especially not now, right after we've gotten you back. It is not your fault that you hit your head during that attack, bud, and there is no one who thinks any less of you for it. You cannot control how your body chooses to heal itself."
Which was yet another reason why he was certain Project Phoenix would be a success. In Steve's opinion, failure simply was not an option.
"I'm hardly ever too busy for chess," Peter said. "You can come up for lunch, and then we can play afterward?"
Tony impatiently tapped his fingers on the counter as JARVIS ran the simulation, his heart fluttering as a blurred and grainy image suddenly appeared on his monitor. He instinctively squinted, trying to bring the image into better focus, which only made it worse.
Tony smiled as he started the car.  “Ah, you like Harleys, yeah?”
"Seems like what, Pep?"
"No, it's not," Steve said, rather petulantly. "In fact, according to Dr Cho, it's actually—"
"So Bruce actually has something of value this time?"
"Is there a reason why you're wearing a shirt tonight?" Steve gently asked a few seconds later, pinching the almost threadbare fabric of Tony's tank top between his fingers. "'Cause if it's because you're cold, I doubt this thing is gonna help all that much."
that one second my dad was talking to you and the next second he's gone, like he was never even here, which is, like I said, really kinda freaky, so…" Peter trailed off, his eyebrows knitting into a frown when he got absolutely no response, not even the slightest twitch that would indicate Dr Strange had even heard him. Gritting his teeth, Peter took another step closer, snapping his fingers. "Hey! Can you even hear me? I'm trying to talk to you! My dad just disappeared, and Gamora and Nebula too, so if you know anything about why, now would be a great time to let us know—"
"Ah huh. And by the time you're finished with it you'll probably have written an entire doctoral dissertation, just like last time," Tony said proudly. "And we'll all be there to watch you give it."
Grumbling as he shifted in the chair yet again, Tony glanced down at his nanite case, contemplating whether to try and record a message for Steve. More than likely it would just end up being yet another exercise in futility, as the ship had been adrift for the last three days, and even with the distress signal broadcasting, they had seen no other sign of intelligent life anywhere.
It was absolutely beautiful, and Tony loved it so much that even though they still had a few more days before they were due to head back to New York, he was already looking forward to their next trip so they could stay there again.
"Papa?" Peter exclaimed, confused when he saw Steve looming over him. "Um… are you okay?"
Peter thought, biting his bottom lip. Both Dad and Papa looked about as exhausted as he felt, and the fact that they had refused to tell him anything about their meeting down in D.C. could only mean that it hadn't gone well, so…
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
To which Tony responded, "We shall."
"That you are," said Ma. She nodded in the direction of Steve's childhood bedroom. "Bucky and Sam got him all set up in there."
"What in the goddamn hell is
"Steve,” he finally said. “I don't—I don't understand how… you've never even seen him like this, so—" He broke off, a single tear trailing down his cheek as he locked eyes with Steve. "Pete's not sick in this picture, honey. You've drawn him like he's—like he's just a normal kid."
"Three days from now, sir."
"Oh, it's okay," Gwen said with a rather quick nod. "I'll just meet you back by the punch?"
"Goddamnit, Rogers, we still can't see anything on the radar!" Colonel O'Brien shouted over the radio. "Are you absolutely positive about what you're seeing?"
"Yeah, whatever," said Bucky. "Just… be careful when you tell your ma, okay? 'Cause I'm still not sure how she'll handle you dating a Stark."
Which likely meant that the Soul Stone was still hidden deep underneath the Wakandan plain. And without all six of the stones, then…
And as far as Tony was concerned, only he was allowed to see Steve like that.
"It's okay, honey, I'll get him!" Dad said as the beam deposited Peter onto the side of the ship. "Pete, just hold on!"
"Then this could literally go on forever," Sam cut in. "Not exactly feasible, Steve."
"Here you go, Tones," Rhodey said as he placed a fresh, steaming cup of coffee on the counter next to him, along with two headache pills and one of the chocolate chip muffins that he'd always loved. The sight of it was almost enough to bring Tony to tears. He had told Steve about his ridiculous obsession with those damn muffins back on their second or third date, and Steve had promised him just before he'd left on the mission that they would be one of the first things that he made for Tony once they moved into the lake house.
"Goddamnit it all to hell!" Tony shouted, pounding his fists on the counter so hard that he made his keyboard jump. He ripped the glasses from his face, tossing them onto the counter and pinching the bridge of his nose. The headache he'd been trying to keep at bay with copious amounts of coffee was starting to come roaring back, something that he had neither the time nor the fucking patience to deal with.
that Tony was going to accept any iteration of
"Yes, he does," agreed Steve. "But he's also a lot more like you than either of you would like to admit, and so he tends to try and carry other people's stress around on his shoulders just like you do."
But as to exactly
An end to which he would stop at almost nothing to achieve.
Not exactly what Peter would call having the odds stacked in their favour.
As long as the three of them were together, they could accomplish anything.
to a halt next to Peter. "Peter and I worked on it together."
"Tony? Oh, you're home. What're you doing in here?" Tony suddenly heard from the hallway. He whipped his head back to find his father leaning against the doorframe, tying the belt of his ugly-ass robe around his waist. "I'm trying to sleep, what's with all the racket?"
"No more," Peter said under his breath. Because as soon as Papa activated the tesseract and the phoenix took flight, everything changed. Including the fact that over an hour and a half past the normal curfew time, all the lights in Grandma's house were still on.
"If that is in fact the definition of 'like-like', then I would absolutely agree that Mr Stark and Captain Rogers do indeed 'like-like' each other. However, I do believe that you and Miss Stacy are a bit young for… that type of relationship, and I also believe that Mr Stark and Captain Rogers would agree with my assessment."
“Don't try to play coy with me, Rogers,” she says.  “You know exactly what I’m talking about.”
Steve sighed, glancing over at Bucky, who merely shrugged. "He says he'll be ready, Стиви."
The look Steve gave him, one of such immense gratitude and adoration mixed with so much intense self-loathing was almost too much for Tony to handle. The self-loathing he could understand since he had so much personal experience with that one, but the rest…
Pepper leaned back in her chair, letting out a heavy sigh. "Remember that R&D supervisor who I thought was slacking on his performance reviews? Quentin Beck?"
"Well, it's a Broadway musical, isn't it?" said Ned. "Aren't you supposed to dress up for those?"
Steve dropped his chin to his chest, his fingers tightening around Tony's. "I'd really rather that he didn't, especially if something were to go wrong. But I'm not sure that I'm up for fighting with him over it either. He's been so distant lately, and I just…"
"A teenager is still a child, little guy," said Steve. "Even one that has his own car." He clapped his hand on Peter's shoulder, guiding him into the house while Tony gathered up their various blankets and cocoa mugs, depositing them in their appropriate places.
"Tony, the chances of that happening are—"
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
"I just want to tell you again what an honour it is to see you participating in your son's education like this, Captain Rogers," Mr Harrington gushed. "I've always been such a big proponent of parental involvement in a child's schooling, and you, sir, are just—"
Oh, and pliable marble at that.
think you do.  So why don't you just see what happens, hmm?  Something tells me that you wouldn't be blushing all over the place if this Stark fellow hadn’t given you any reason to, so… just play it by ear, okay?  Maybe you’ll come to realise you’re more ready than you thought.”
As it was, he still had to reign in his tears as Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and lined himself up, slowly pushing inside him.
And unfortunately, did absolutely
And, for all of his internal grumbling, Steve is grateful to have the position.  While it does possess a lot of its stereotypical attributes, Empire State is a nice enough place to work.  Steve’s superiors treat him well, staying mostly hands-off and allowing him to run his department as he sees fit, and his co-workers are excellent.  Even people he would consider friends.
"Uhh, yeah!" exclaimed Lang. "But—are you
been able to determine what data had been accessed.
Making his way back down the hall, Peter paused outside the door to the master bedroom. From what he could tell, Dad was
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
'Cause, why the hell not?
Something about the tone of Peter's voice caused Tony's blood to run cold, and he gulped, brushing Peter's matted curls off his forehead.
"Well, I'd really appreciate if you didn't let 'em get here, sir!" said Carol. "We've still got at least ten seconds till we're there!"
As he watched his father wheel Papa out the door, Peter's heart felt the heaviest it had in a long, long time. Everything had been going so well until just a few short hours ago that it had seemed almost too good to be true. But now…
"Maybe," Steve murmured. As much as he hated being late to anything, it wouldn't be the first time that he and Tony had arrived late to a function, and for this very same reason. There was just something so irresistible about Tony's beautiful olive skin when it was covered in water droplets.
she said in her strong Irish lilt, smiling as she held out her hand for the boy. She was just as beautiful as Steve remembered, dressed in her favourite blue dress and matching hat, clothes that Steve's papa had purchased for her right before he was shipped off to war.
"Yeah," Gwen said as she bit off part of an apple slice. "You're usually daydreaming through most of our classes, and when you're not you're just pretending to take notes when you're really drawing schematics or something in your notebooks."
"Shh," Steve whispered, brushing his lips across Tony's nose and then his lips as he started to gently sway, tucking Tony's right hand against his chest. "Just… dance with me for awhile, let's not think about it now. JARVIS, can you turn up the volume of the music, please?"
Then again, when had anything ever worked out the way Tony had hoped?
But he was so, so close. All he needed to do was—
Tony threw up his hands. "Well, duh!" he retorted. "I had to sit down here and listen to you almost getting blown outta the sky, so yeah, I'd say I'm just a bit stressed!"
And, as much as he usually disliked cats, he had to admit she was rather pretty.
"I'm guessing that their guy didn't exactly turn out like Steve here?" asked Tony.
Yanking hard on the stick, Steve steered his aircraft up towards the sky, manoeuvring it safely around the oncoming missile. A second later he heard it explode, the ear-spitting
Then again, Phillips had always been a bit difficult to read.
Peter sniffed, rubbing his nose against Dad's chest. "Me too," he said. "And I wanna get home too. But we're not gonna get anywhere if we just keep yelling back and forth."
"Oh," Peter said with a nod. "Um… hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm fifteen, how old are you?"
"Late night tonight, hmm?"
In fact, he was pretty much certain that he
“Yeah, well, not for lack of trying, right?” Obie said, so coldly that Tony’s heart skipped.  “I mean, they almost got the whole damn thing straight from the horse’s mouth!”  He shot Tony a look, one so cold and accusatory that Tony’s hands clenched into fists.
Tony whispered, his mouth so dry and cracked that the very act of breathing was painful. Somehow, he wasn't dead. Instead, he was back on the ship, sitting in the pilot's seat and staring dumbfounded at the angel hovering out in space, right in front of the ship's nose.
"I'm ready!" Bucky said, his eyes wide behind the glasses and his fists tightly clenched. "Start now!"
"Ah, JARVIS? Can you help me with something?" Peter asked.
"What? Why?" Gwen asked, her head snapping back in alarm. "Peter, what's wrong? What did you see?"
"Thank you," said Stacy. He gathered up his hat and coat, glancing back at his sleeping daughter. "You know, Captain, Mr Stark, if I were a normal father, this is where I would tell you to tell your boy to stay the hell away from my daughter, since she can't seem to escape the weird and dangerous incidents that follow your family around like a lost puppy. And I'm not ashamed to tell you both that that very thought has crossed my mind more than once. But since I'm apparently not a normal father, as Gwen has seen the need to remind me on multiple occasions over the years, that means I've come to the conclusion that even if I were to demand such a thing, nothing would change." Stacy paused, sucking in a deep breath as he looked down at Peter, following the line of his arm to where his fingers were locked with Gwen's. "Gwen is one of the most stubborn young women that I've ever seen, second only to her intellect, which means if I were to tell her that she needed to stay away from your son, there's no way she would listen to me. As much as I hate to admit it, she believes that she loves him, and… well… who am I to deny my only daughter something—or someone—she loves?"
"Oh, like you care about recruitment," Phillips said, crossing his arms. "How's your kid doing?"
A knot rose in Tony's throat as Bucky's piercing eyes locked with his through the window, with Bucky giving him an almost imperceptible nod.
"Yes, there was!" Tony snapped. He yanked his hand again, pulling it from Steve's grasp before rolling onto his side, facing away from him. "You weren't there. You didn't hear him as he grabbed at me, begging for me to help him. It took him longer to fade than the others, and he felt every single bit of it. And all I could do was stand there and watch. I was
“I’ll...be sure to initial that part,” Steve replied after a moment’s pause, a bit of a grudgingly admiring chuckle in his voice at the woman’s casual aplomb.
“That isn’t going to happen,” Tony said before he could catch himself.  Stupid.  Stupid!  His mouth always seemed just ahead of his mind.  He bit his lip and glanced over at Yinsen, but thankfully, the man didn’t seem to see the need to translate that for Steve.  “I should get to work on this,” he said, nodding at the cannon, or what was left of it, anyway.
“Move,” Bruce snapped.  “Tony, move out of the way.  Clint, get us home.”  Tony stared at him, blinking slowly, before stepping back.  He could almost feel a physical strain, pulling himself away, but there was a strange relief in having someone tell him what to do because he had no idea what to do with something that wasn’t supposed to be happening.
Stark held out his phone, and almost reluctantly, Steve took it and looked down at the screen.  Sure enough, there was Brock, sitting on a barstool with one arm on the counter, leaning in to talk to the man next to him.
, Rhodey.  He was doing it for years,” Tony said, teeth grinding together on the words.  “Patting me on the head and sending me off to the workshop while he did
Well.
He remembered finding the door panel on one of their trips to Germany. Heidelberg, he recalled.  Christmas, six—no, seven—years ago now.  God, where did the time go?  Down in the Market Place at one of the dozens of antique shops they rummaged through for no other reason than having nothing better to do, enjoying piping hot potato fritters with apple sauce, beautifully-formed cinnamon star biscuits and doughy snowball cakes.  Steve loved Germany.  Which seemed odd to Tony at first, but there was something very satisfying for Steve in all of the changes.  A sense of see, we did do something.  We mattered.  We made a difference.
Steve didn’t pause to worry about Stane, figuring Happy could handle that, just ran after him, saw him brush past dinner guests, who turned in confusion at the spectacle of their host crashing through the room, bumping and jostling his way across the living room to the steps leading to the workshop without paying any heed to what he was doing or the chaos in his wake.  Steve didn’t care, just raced after him, pushing his way through guests and servers as quickly as he could.  He saw Pepper and Rhodey turn to follow Tony’s movements with concerned gazes, but Tony was down the steps and through the workroom door before Steve could reach him. Steve reached out to grab the handle to the workroom and pulled.  It was locked.  Dammit, Tony, he thought in frustration.
“Please, please, Steve, please,” Tony begged, a desolate half-moan against Steve’s mouth. “Please let me love you as you do me, as you are, not as you think you should be.  Please believe me that I do, that I will.  Forever,” Tony pleaded, punctuating each request with kisses that would have been cruel from anyone else, sharp tongue edging into Steve’s mouth with a demanding force, teeth scraping over Steve’s bottom lip, Tony’s mouth chasing his breath away.  “Look at me,” Tony demanded, shaking the hands that still held Steve’s jaw between them.  “Look at me.
“Let me take you to the Grand Canyon,” Stark offered, his voice soft and wind-rough up this high.
--but certainly an
As soon as the carriage door closed, Tony groaned and leaned his head back, unbuttoning the top of his surcoat.  “God, it’s hot,” Tony grumbled. He picked up the long, wooden box that held the scepter, opened it, then tossed it aside and reached for the other box.  He flipped open that lid and lifted out what looked to Steve like a handful of delicate gold strands, though when Tony held the edges between his finders, Steve could see it was more of a sleeveless shirt made entirely of gold chains that were strung together.  “The far more interesting gift,” Tony mused, giving Steve a half-lidded look over the top of the garment before coiling it back down into its box. “Wear it under your robes for the tourney. At least I’ll have something pleasant to occupy my mind.”
“He named it? He’s going to want to take that thing back with him, isn’t he?” Tony groaned, then laughed and shook his head.
“Right.  A special viewer,” Steve repeated, nodding a bit.
“Alright, if you say so,” Ms. Potts said with a slight frown.  “I’ll handle the details and let you know.  Steve, be thinking about what we can tell them about you.  You two—shopping.  Go.  Be seen.  Be obnoxiously happy.  And for God’s sake, look at rings.”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said after a pause. Tony nodded, not looking at him.  Steve glanced up at the elevator numbers again. “I’m not sure what to say. People don’t usually do stuff like that for me.”
And maybe there were other reasons leaving had stopped seeming like an escape sometime between trying to wring his clothes out and getting offered and actually taking the best of what could be given.
“You give me far too much credit,” Tony said after a long moment.  “Regardless, it does not make all of this less difficult for you,” Tony pointed out. Steve dragged his eyes back up to Tony, who grimaced, and wiped his hand over his mouth as if the words tasted bitter.  “I know—Steve, I know this is hard. I know this isn’t what you want! It isn’t what I want, either,
“I don’t know why you think we don’t have anything to say to each other,” Tony said sarcastically to Steve, then leaned his elbow against the darkened car window and chewed on his lower lip.
“Not to be critical, but you stopped doing what I asked about thirty minutes ago,” Steve pointed out.
“Remember…we—we have a deal…you gave your word we would have safe passage.  You can’t just--tell him that we have an arrangement—” Obie reared back, cutting off the last as the man sidled up in front of him, nearly pressing his chest against Obie’s, they were so close.  A tense quiet filled the tent.  One wrong movement, and this would end in bloodshed, Tony thought.  The man stared at Obie for a long moment, then said something else, something short and clipped, and Tony didn’t think it was exactly an expression of gratitude.
“Come for me, Steve,” Tony urged as he worked his hand and the sponge with as much deft ease as he usually reserved for building his machines.  Steve moaned, tearing his lips from Tony’s and let his head sink to Tony’s shoulder.  “So good for me.  Almost there,” Tony said, then wrapped the sponge around the head of Steve’s cock and twisted his wrist in a circular motion once, twice, and then Steve was coming so hard he nearly sent them both reeling into the edge of the bath, though Tony held him and kept his hand working Steve’s cock as the last of the pulses shook through Steve’s body.
of sound that pulled at something deep in his gut. Wrong. This was
To be fair, that was probably because they were celebrating a windfall that wasn’t going to happen, and he was the only one who knew that.  God, Brock was going to be pissed.  Even more now, because he would feel humiliated since he had already told his friends about their ‘good luck’ in Vegas.
A papery blue sheet like the one the nurse was holding splayed over his chest with a gaping opening down the center, exposing a terrible smile of a wound that slashed across Steve’s chest with metal teeth that clasped bits of gristled flesh.  Surgical staples, Tony’s mind supplied with a detached sort of horror.  He and Coulson really had a different definition of the concept of ‘okay.’
“Hey,”  Bucky said, clapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder and giving him a small shake.  “It’s not a problem.
“Good, Tony.  I’m good,” Steve replied, the words sort of thrumming through his mind in a blurry, hazy sort of mash. He considered if they were true and stretched a bit, testing. It felt a bit like coming up for air after being underwater, not unpleasant, but sharp.  He could feel his breath in his chest, the press of Tony against his ribs, the warmth of the room. A dawning sort of awareness of things beyond just how he felt started creeping in. He closed his eyes, trying to sink back into the feeling from before.
. I did not care about such things before, I admit. I was not the jealous sort, much to the dismay of some who thought to gain a proposal that way. I didn’t think I would ever care, not after my parents and how they treated that relationship, but… with you, I find that I am a jealous man, after all, I suppose. I can’t abide the thought of sharing you.”
“Will it hurt?” Tony heard himself ask.  “This procedure. Will it--how much is this going to hurt?”
It was almost over, the battle just this close to being won. Schwarma time.  And then the earth moved and the building next to Steve crumbled into rubble before his eyes, the civilians that had been hiding out in the basement now fodder for the robots.  Steve could smell the gas easy enough.  The robots were using flamethrowers among other things.  He didn’t even consciously think, just jumped and then there was
Not all of them, Steve had said.  You could tell.  Well, Steve could tell, whatever.  Probably other Alphas could, too, but at least some of the people in the pictures had been Omegas, which no doubt was the titillation tipping point that parted the good GI from the stipend he had been planning to send home to his mom in Nebraska.
“You look good,” Tony said. His voice slurred, and he blinked somewhat hazily at Steve, but it was a happy, loose sort of dazed.  The kind of easy softness that Steve didn’t think he’d seen on Tony’s face before.
meant by it, Tony,” Steve said.  “I just needed time to think, and I couldn’t do that here with you.  I was so mad at you, but whenever I looked at you, I just wanted to wrap my arms around you and forget everything that woman said. Guess I should have listened to my gut there, huh?”
He called down to the concierge to have them notify Happy he was ready to go, then took a last, lingering look back at the suite as he pressed the elevator call button.  He told himself it was to soak up the incredible details of a place the likes of which he would probably never see again and ignored the flashes of images that flickered across his mind as his gaze swept the room.  The elevator pinged and the doors opened.  Steve stepped inside and pushed the button for the lobby.  He watched as the doors slid closed, the suite growing smaller and smaller, until it disappeared, like a spell being broken, and he sank back into reality, stepping out of the elevator and heading across the lobby to the front of the hotel, where Happy waited with the same car from the night before.
Steve nodded. He let Tony pull him close.  One of Tony’s hand brushed the hair off his brow.  Another wrapped around his wrist, rubbing at the pulse point there.
“A VHS.  Little use to you now. I took the liberty of having the film digitized for you,” T’Challa told him, pulling a small flash drive from the pocket of his vest and holding it out to Steve.  For a second, Steve didn’t want to take it.  He did, of course, mumbling his thanks, or he thought he had.  “We have technicians who can restore it properly, and a media vault where the original can be preserved.  If you like.”
like donuts,” Tony suggested evenly.
Tony liked the stars. Loved the stars.  No.  Craved them.  The knowledge, the--the freedom of it, that was it. The stars were for everyone, Steve remembered Tony saying. No gatekeeper, Steve thought again, and wondered how many times Tony had been denied what he wanted--
He collapsed in a heap, just barely catching himself on his arm before falling on top of Tony’s chest.  His muscles where quivering with exertion, vibrating and pinging like he had run a great distance, yet he felt loose and boneless at the same time.  He was breathing hard. Sweat coated his brow.  Tony was running his hands up and down his chest and shoulders, his name and other words that Steve couldn’t quite process but understood as good falling from Tony’s lips.  Tony cupped Steve’s jaw in his hands and pulled Steve’s eyes to his.
“I hear they are having a fantastic Cubism exhibit,” Pepper told him over her shoulder as she pushed open a door.
“Believe it or not,” Steve continued, his eyes dropping to where the dog tags dipped just below the curve of Tony’s black tank top.  “They tried to deny you’d been there.  As if I don’t recognize a level of destruction from a box of scraps that only you can achieve by now,” Steve teased.  The attempt fell flat, sounded almost wistful when you took away the words, but Tony appreciated the effort.
“Sir, I am sorry to report that Dr. Banner admires your efforts, but must refuse your invitation to ‘come onto the Quin-Jet on what is definitely not a trip to the bottom of the ocean’ and offers his heartfelt congratulations,” Jarvis announced primly.
“Hmmm?  Oh, yeah. Right,” Tony remembered, nearly running to the bathroom to find something.  He came back out to the suite’s living area and tossed a towel, blanket, large tarp, whatever, to Steve, who caught it and managed to get it wrapped around himself with some semblance of modesty intact.
“A messenger arrived this morning,” Tony sighed.  “Poor man was shaking so badly, I feared he would expire before he got the message out.  But, she isn’t wrong, and I do owe her--and several others--replies. Go now, on with you before I change my mind and shirk my responsibilities to our host.  Which I could do. Really, no one will exactly admonish me for it. Leastwise, not to my face.”
Howard gave Tony’s shoulder a hard squeeze, which Tony squirmed away from, followed by a long, reproachful look.  Nothing about this was done.  This was Howard, clamping his jaws around whatever it was they were dangling in front of him that he wanted so badly.  There was still a way out.  Not a good way, admittedly, but if the plan hinged on Tony managing to impress this Captain Rogers, then chances of success had plummeted to what amounted to a statistical impossibility, as far as Tony was concerned.
“Very well. Call again if you should need anything,” the woman said, then turned on her heels and headed for the desk where the man sat, his eyes focused on the tablet in his hands.
As plans went, it wasn’t his best, Steve admitted to himself as he crawled over to where Hammer sat.  It was pleasant to think about though.  He thought he might think about it a lot in the next few minutes.  Thinking about killing Hammer might be the only thing that kept Steve alive in the next few minutes. We’ve moved a bit beyond hoping for a glimpse of the sea, haven’t we, Rogers, he thought.
“You’re just saying that because you have to.  Because you’re Jarvis,” Tony said, watching the SUV grind to a halt in front of the cabin.
“Did I?  Truth will out, I suppose,” Jarvis said, voice tinged with a thread of self-reproach that made Tony’s stomach twist.
“Yes. Definitely. Yes.  Very excited to get home.  I had Happy go feed our fish.  Don’t give me that look.  You’re the one who went and named them.  Wait. We’re using ‘go home’ as some kind of euphemism, right?” Tony asked, sitting up abruptly.  “Because, honestly, if we don’t—“ Tony broke off with what he thought was a very manly squeak as Steve lifted him onto his lap and ducked his head to capture Tony’s mouth.  “Emjussayin,” Tony mumbled into Steve’s lips, feeling them curve into a smile.  Steve brought his hand up and settled it onto the back of Tony’s neck, pushing just hard enough for the pressure to burn a path down to the tip of Tony’s already half-hard cock.
“Are you…is this okay?”  Tony asked.  His voice was tight, almost pained.
“The Claim--” Tony began.
“Thank you for proving my point,” Tony shot back, giving Steve a small nod.   “First crush?  Please say the nerdy kid who knew all the science and math answers.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve replied in a clipped, precise tone that made Tony think of nails on a chalkboard.
“What’s wrong, Tony?” Steve asked with a frown. He was playing with Tony’s hair where it curled at the nape of his neck, still a little damp from their shower, though his hand stilled at Tony’s words. “Did something happen with Batroc and those files he has?”
Should’ve had more wine, Steve thought with a grimace.
The next day was largely spent working with Pepper and Rhodey on the clean energy presentation for the Board.  He met with Obie when they were all done, going through a dry run of the Board presentation, complete with Pepper’s CFO-jack-off graphs and Rhodey’s notes from his Corps buddy.  Tony thought it went well, though Obie was largely noncommittal and simply thanked Tony for the head’s up and promised to think on it.  Tony supposed outright capitulation and enthusiasm was too much to hope for, given Obie’s entrenchment with the idea of keeping the bulk of SI’s resources dedicated to weapons.  It wasn’t that Tony didn’t understand. The military industrial complex was the business Obie had lived and breathed for decades.  Shifting away from that…it would be hard on anyone.
“This is private,” a slurred male voice said.  It was familiar, but off somehow, and at first, Steve couldn’t place it.  “You’re not supposed to be here.” Steve’s heart thudded against his chest, muscles tensing.  He had the wild thought that he was caught. That the person
“Now, strip. And kneel. Here,” Tony pointed to a spot on the carpeted floor near the center of the tent. “Hands behind your back.” He started towards one of the trunks, not waiting to see if Steve would comply, then stopped and turned, staring hard at Steve, who hadn’t yet moved.
“Guess you got this,” Rhodey said, standing up and bouncing a bit on his heels, eyebrows raising and a puff of air escaping his mouth.  “Whoo. So.  Sugar.  Good. Going to go, like, run home and maybe back again, then home, and I don’t know, do all my homework for the semester, then probably push-ups.  Pull-ups. Yeah.  Pull-ups.”
“Come on,” Steve urged.  “Let’s get you warmed up.”
“Hmm. Yes, well, let’s see him, then, shall we?” Zola said with a wave of his hand.  Sitwell stepped in front of Steve long enough to give him a look of warning, then undid the loincloth at Steve’s waist and let it fall to the ground before stepping back.  Steve had long ago lost whatever shame he may once have had over his body, but he still hated the feeling of being
could have fixed it for him, what do you think?” Peggy asked.   Tony’s little shoulders lifted into a shrug, but he was peering at Peggy with renewed interest, mouth twisting into something of a frown, but it was an
“Well, you have good taste, can’t argue with that,” Tony agreed.  He stretched, reaching high behind him and letting his arm fall behind Steve’s head on the back of the sofa.
Steve wrapped his lips around the shaft and sucked lightly, using his tongue to circle the head and lap at the slit there, the way he knew by now that Tony liked.  Tony pulled back, then slowly pushed in again, repeating the motion until Steve felt his throat slacken and relax.  His lips were sloppy and wet, leaving a trail of saliva catching on Tony’s cock like a spider’s web, dribbling down his chin as he sucked against the steady, shallow thrusts.  Metal and musk smells mingled, filling his nose, as Tony pushed deeper into Steve’s mouth with a low groan that went all the way down to the tip of Steve’s cock.  Steve continued to suck and work his tongue around Tony’s cock, even as a gasping choked-off breath was punched out of him as Tony thrust deeper, hitting the back of his throat before pulling almost all the way out again.
The first thing Tony’s brain registered was that, contrary to his earlier supposition, the alien was, in fact, wearing some kind of garment, though it looked more like some kind of futuristic loincloth than anything Tony had ever seen before.  It hung by thin chains over the alien’s hips, then down in a strip of something that might have been metal or cloth between his legs. The alien crawled onto the table between Tony’s legs and waved his hand.
“No,” Steve cut in. “I’m not…Bonding.  No.”  His jaw clicked shut, hard.  He could feel his teeth grate together.  That was…that was insane.  Obviously.  She didn’t understand. For a moment, his memory pulled up a stack of photos, black and white, bent at the edges from being passed around, grime-covered prints on them, and he quickly shoved that thought away, where it belonged.  Bonding was for…people who weren’t him.
Steve thought, remembering Cam’s words.
“No, no, belay that,” Tony said quickly, slashing a hand through the air and turning around to face Steve. He winced tightly as he seemed to catch the edge of the drafting table with his hip. Steve’s frown deepened. “I—I’m fine. No, really, don’t give me that look, it’s entirely within the realm of possibility that I am not, in fact, just saying that,” Tony said, holding up one hand. “Seriously, Cap, I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m—” he broke off and groaned, covering his face with his hands.
“Oh,” Tony said, momentarily thrown off course.  His anger dulled a bit as he digested the shock of it.  It wasn’t like he didn’t understand at least the concept of security clearances and a need-to-know.  He had grown up in the military industrial complex, after all.  Still, it rankled.
He pressed forward once again and causing Steve’s head to snap back to the ground, and even Tony felt the wave of sensation roll through Steve as he clenched and tightened around Tony.  Turnabout was fair play, Tony supposed.  A moment later, Tony felt the tension from the tip of his cock suddenly release and felt a rush of warmth along his shaft, easing the way for the knot.  Despite that, he heard a sharp gasp from Steve as his whole body shuddered at the feeling of Tony’s knot retracting from deep inside him.  When his body told him it was okay, he slowly pulled out, rocking back to sit on his heels, utterly exhausted.
,” Steve told him. “She thinks, and I’m quoting, it’s the best gift ever.  And Scott thinks it's all hilarious.  He said to tell you something about a file he sent you on the latest specs for that generator, by the way.  He’ll probably grab you for half the party tomorrow if you don’t reply.  Anyway, Scott’s ex is the one freaking out.  To be fair, if a couple of emulsified sharks showed up at my daughter’s tenth birthday, I’d have some questions, too.”
On what carpeting to pick out for the offices, sure.  Well, at least in theory, until he’d pointed at the swatch of fuchsia paisley while he was distracted by the upgrades to the engines on the latest Navy helicopters some of the engineers were discussing.  The damn saltwater and damp, sea air was always a problem, but they had a new idea for a polymer coating they thought might work, and Tony could see it in his head in an instant, as soon as they mentioned to his father what they were going for.   Of course, he got all of a pat on his head and a round of laughter for his efforts, but he did take some satisfaction in the fact that it took the elitist asshats another seven months of research to figure it out, though.
“I don’t know, Buck. We’re so different,” Steve said, glancing off towards the Strip again. Every time he looked at it, the unreality of all of this seemed weigh heavier on him.
“Think of it like a fancy pacemaker,” Tony said, dropping the hand that had been gripping Steve’s hair down to capture Steve’s hand where it covered the center of Tony’s chest.
“That’s not all, and you know it, so don’t even with that bullshit,” Barnes bit out.  “Let me guess, he doesn’t fall into your arms at this revelation,” Barnes said derisively, making quote marks in the air around the word. “So you, what, move in next to him? Who does that?”
“Hello, Steve. I take it you got the delivery this morning,” she said smoothly.  Right. The clothes.  He almost laughed out loud, because he’d forgotten.  It seemed like that had been years ago, not hours.
“I’ll do it,” Tony offered helpfully without looking up.
“I’d forgotten that part,” Tony said quietly.  He swiped a hand at his forehead, then looked back at Steve.  “Think you’d ever want to re-enlist?”
“You were very brave.  Throwing the lamp was completely not an overreaction,” Nat intoned mildly, a smile playing on her lips as she twined her arm through Barnes’ and leaned in close.
Which just figured, didn’t it? Virtually every interaction with Stark since the beginning left Steve feeling twisted into some kind of ridiculous position, tongue-tied and torn between being mortified at himself for letting Stark get to him and angry at Stark for being…well, so very
“We have our orders,” one of the guards answered.  “This way,” he said, jerking his head forward.
Steve sank lower on his knees and let his tongue work the sensitive skin behind Tony’s balls, pushing into the thin layer with his mouth, then following with his fingers, massaging and pressing into the spot where he knew Tony could feel it deep inside.  Tony was mumbling something that might have been math, Steve wasn’t sure. Tony’s eyes were closed, lips barely moving as his fingers curled and unfurled, over and over, scrabbling for some kind of purchase that wasn’t to be found.  Steve continued kissing his way back to Tony’s hole, letting his mouth work at the rim, sucking lightly at the edge of muscle, then over the hole itself, tongue plunging deep again.  He kept two fingers pressed deep behind where Tony’s balls were pulled tight and heavy, massaging them deeply into the soft, sensitive skin there as his tongue stroked over Tony’s hole in rapid motions.  He withdrew his tongue and thrust with his fingers at the same time he sucked hard at Tony’s hole, tearing a cry from Tony’s throat that turned into a rough, garbled groan.
"I know I'll never be able to take Barnes' place and I never did. I know the two of you have history together and I adore and respect that but I cannot live a life where I was lied to for years about the biggest truth of my life. I can't live with being considered last again. For years, I always hated Howard thinking that he was the reason why I lost my mom. All she wanted to do was go to the Bahamas. You know, this kind of ate me alive for years and frankly at this point, I'm too exhausted to try and I'm too tired to even think right now. I'm tired, Steve. I'm just tired. I know you don't believe in the Accords but I'm still working on them. Once you guys are back, I hope the edited version appeals to you and I'm making my decision to retire from the Avengers. I can't stay. I don't think I can after everything that's happened.
He hears the voice break into a sob and feels his heart clench painfully within his chest. Hot tears had already started flowing down his cheeks long ago and he's so scared right now. He doesn't want to hurt the other man anymore. He doesn't want to cause him any harm or sorrow. Whatever he did, he did in blind rage. It took him back to his days of drunken stupor and bad choices. All he could see was his mother's face beaming at him from inside his head, affectionately cooing out to him in Italian and his father's lifeless body slumped over the driving wheel. He wasn't thinking and only saw red and retribution. To exact yé oldè eye-for-an-eye from the murderer of his only kin, who left him orphaned and alone in this monstrosity of a world.
He can hear the faint drag of his index finger along the brown paper making a characteristic soft rippling which he pays attention to, almost as if in sort of a trance.
Tony glances over back at Rhodey who's looking at him with so much adoration that it melts Tony. He places a comforting hand on Tony's shoulder, before giving it a gentle squeeze and getting up.
A wave of fatigue crashes into Tony. He's been dealing with these conflicting feelings forever and recently, they've reached their peak for the past three days and each time, he's left either horribly broken or breaking down or terribly scared.
"He was supposed to tell you, Tony."
As soon as he reaches the door, something stops him. Freezes him like a Greek sculpture.
Please leave kudos and comments if you liked it.
"What can I say? I'm a futurist."
They exchanged rings, they said their vows and they kissed, finally declaring themselves to be wed.
"Tony, I'm… I'm sorry."
"Please, Bruce. The stubborn jackass will never take it if I don't force him to."
Tony bobbed his head more vigorously, in long strokes, licking and toying with Steve's dick, ever so often letting his teeth graze so slightly along the length, hearing a whimper from Steve, who was grabbing the sheets so tightly. Steve's golden skin shined against the brighter morning light, his luscious frame sparkling in beautiful glints, highlighting his beautiful bone structure, complemented by cakes of brilliant muscle. Steve was heaving his breaths, his chest rising and falling so intensely that Tony grabbed the base of his own cock, refusing to let himself be spent so quickly. Gosh darn, Steve's beauty!
Before Steve knows it, Tony's pushed his legs up and places his feet on the edge of the table in front of him and twists himself, while having Steve buried inside of him fully and completely.
He destroyed his parents' lives by existing.
Some ironbros fluff and antics 4 you uwu.
The brunet whined in response and nuzzled his nose into Steve's throat, taking a deep breath before speaking out in a muffled tone:
Bucky gets up and clasps his hand on either side of Steve's face, his eyes streaked with tears before he presses a deep kiss to his face. Steve just blinks back at him, at a loss for words.
"Does Peter know?"
He looks up at the man and recognizes that same beautiful face, contorted with worry and pain. His eyebrows knitted together to form a crease smack dab in the middle of them. The wrinkles on his forehead non-existent. The bridge of his nose popping out and nostrils flaring and he sees his plush, deep pink lips, frowning, which are now surrounded and marked with short hairs. He has a beard now, thick and dark and luscious, masking the super-soldier's diamond-cut jaw and perfectly shaped cheekbones. He looks raw and ravishing, like a golden lion, come here to stake claim on Tony's poor, battered heart.
______________________*______________________
Tony lifted his head to adore those brilliant baby blues staring at him and he felt his heart bloom like a lotus at the sight. Steve was smiling at him like a dork, his mouth curved like the magnificent crescent moon and he was just so incredibly proud that it was him that put that smile on Steve Rogers' face, who looked just as radiant as the morning sun.
Tony confronts Steve.
Months later, Peter left for college and Tony couldn't take the blatant ignoring and side-stepping Steve did. He started spending more time away from home, putting forth heavier schedules and a greater workload in his defense.
I knew for a fact that the only reason you're staying together is for the kid. I fucking knew it. And now that he's off to college, well that burden is off your shoulders, isn't it?”
The man looks up at Tony and sees his face laced with concern and sorrow. He smiles weakly before Tony ruffles his hair with both hands and settles down on his cheeks, lingering, feeling the thick bush of hair again, now adorning them. A small part of Tony wants to just slap him so goddamn hard but another part wants to soothe him, to run his hands through his hair and face. Steve hooks his hands on Tony's waist and peers at him. He doesn't pull Tony any closer.
Tony had fooled himself long enough. He lived and breathed this illusion of happiness for far too long and now, he's going to break out of it. For once in this marriage, Tony was finally going to do what was right by him and what was right for him.
He's waited for almost two and a half years, what is one or two more days?
"Sit down, Steve."
No sign of Tony Stark.
"Tony."
"You better come here quickly then. I think this is important."
2:47 a.m.
And so, the happy family went on with their life, cherishing each other and loving one another unconditionally as the years went by.
He storms out of the car and slams the door, without unlocking it before getting into the elevator and riding it till the floor of the house.
"I never told you this but I worked for Stark while he was in California. I was his PA for a while when Pepper took over as CEO. And let me tell you this, he doesn't deserve whatever the two of you are doing to him."
Well, he's getting it from somewhere else now, isn't he? That slimy bastard. And his fucking whore.
"It's all good, Bruce Bear. I've got that much self control now."
Honestly, screw Rhodey and his shrink skills at always deciphering Tony.
Bucky wakes and glances at Steve, blinking twice before he smiles in earnest at him. Steve smiles back, he's always smiled back every time but it's always abruptly halted as he feels a sick churning in his gut and an ache in his heart.
"I'll call Pepper. And I'm bringing fifty cases of booze. Do I have to bring out my gun? You know I'm still licensed to use it."
"You're not wearing underwear."
He grabs it and sets it down on the table before pulling the chair back and plopping himself in it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, nothing. It's just that he hasn't well, he hasn't called back. Shit...."
"Tony, wha-? How is he drinking around you?"
"So, yeah, the papers are in the back. I already signed it. I want you to as well.
Tony glances at the chip, feeling it's light mass but enormous significance in his palm.
He hasn't spoken ever since he left Rhodey's house to come to the 2 o' clock meeting.
He can hear faint voices dishing out news or rules or instructions or murmuring amongst themselves, about mundane topics which would, never in a million years, pique his interest.
Tony nips at Steve's lower lip, earning a growl into his mouth, making him chuckle. Then, he turns his full focus on Steve's beard and Tony kisses the hairs above Steve's lips and licks the hairs with his tongue, feeling like one hell of a lascivious slut. He shifts his focus to the chin and even bites a few strands of stubble off of Steve's chin, earning a low howl from the super-soldier. Tony rakes his hands through Steve's cheeks and kisses Steve's beard so passionately, one would think it's a new deity on Steve's face.
"After everything, I can't hate him, Rhodey. I cannot. I can't even fathom hating him or getting back at him. I left everything for him. I went against my parents for him. Oh God....."
"Dad? DAD?!? Why do you look like you've seen a ghost?"
Steve may have spent most of the night alone, but he found people to talk to as well, and he especially admired Tony's friend, James, who had signed up in the army recently.
Steve couldn't believe what he read. He just couldn't.
An ache settles within his gut as he leans against the headboard and observes Bucky's face, twisted with pleasure as he grinds down on him, eyes closed and mouth lax and open.
"Your Highness."
It's rather rude to not take notice of someone who's come to meet him, despite him knowing that the person has arrived but Tony's so tired of having to meet and greet people so much in these past few months, dealing with the Accords and Ross and Pepper just leaving the company for a much needed vacation break and Bruce just vanishing…. The list could go on but Tony has never been one to complain, always trying to do as much as he could, try to fix and save as much as he can, always helping and accommodating. It's what makes Tony, well… Tony.
Tony used to sing to him in foreign tongue, mostly Italian, softly and quietly, while he trailed his fingers through his hair, massaged his scalp with such beloved tenderness while the other hand used to rub circles on his chest, not teasingly but more devotedly, like he was worshipping the heart beating under the flesh, because he knew it beat only for him as he clasped him close, while Steve nuzzled under Tony's neck and nipped softly at the skin there, eliciting sudden gasps and sputters from his love.
Steve swallows at the new information, not willing to argue with Natasha. She'd rip him to shreds.
"Shut up, Tony! Pick out the movie you want to watch.", Rhodey shoots back before grabbing Tony's keys from the hook and going out.
He remembers Steve coming home one night and making love to him, claiming he missed him
"Ok honey, you and Rhodey take care. Bye. Good night. I love you."
"B-buck... oh god, fuck. Buck. Grab a condom!"
He always put his own needs before theirs, because an unsatisfied Tony Stark is a very unhappy Tony Stark. And Tony Stark doesn't like to be unhappy.
"You took such good care of me last night, my love. May I take care of you today?", Tony pleaded.
Tony's eyes open wide at the screen of the phone, the bright white light showing the incoming call making them sting and burn.  He's tuned out the loud ringing emanating from it, resounding within the entire house.
"Steve is.... well, he's Steve. What more do you want me to say?"
No response.
Tony heaves an exhausted sigh and looks at the fucking mess.
Tony chuckles before letting himself go to sleep, to the din of Steve's growing snoring and the thump of his heart.
Tony doesn't remember much afterwards except of what he was told. He cried so hard that he could not breathe. He supposedly babbled utter nonsense about someone taking his baby away from them as he hiccuped through his tears, which landed him collapsing into his husband's arms, passing out where he stood and then he was put to bed where he slept for almost fourteen hours. Or so it seemed.
"Tony, hey... What's up?"
"Huh?"
The crowd laughs lightly.
Steve stopped to press a light kiss to the head of hair beneath his chin and he turned to the left to glance at the sight of the clock lying on the bedside table, gleaming the digits 7, 0 and 8 in a fluorescent blue.
Peter reminded Tony of himself and Steve, like he's their lovechild, with an intellect like his and mannerisms like Steve's. Steve thinks Tony would love Wakanda and their technology, which would send him gaga.
"I fucking loved you. I loved you so much that I couldn't believe my luck that I ever landed someone like you. You were probably the only thing keeping me going at one point, do you even...? I.... Oh God."
He always feared that Steve would one day fall out of love with him, recognizing Tony as useless as he always felt.
At first, Tony feels sympathetic.
"There were days when I just wanted to crash myself into a bar or drown in a margarita pool but I'm glad that I didn't. Who knew the serenity prayer helped? I mean I'd just pop a prayer to Yoda and feel enlightened. But, most of all, I could not have done with it without each and every one of you. And for that, I am eternally grateful to all of you for saving my life. Thank you!"
He hears footsteps approach, and he can sense their quiet placing, the thump of a shoe on the marble and he audibly notices their din becoming minutely louder with each step. They stop after a while, and he hears the sound of soles shuffling on the panelled wooden flooring, where he stands. Tony's eyes instinctively shifting to the side where the shuffle of feet comes from.
He destroyed everything. Like how he always does.
The sensation along his fingers is eerily relaxing, making him get lost in playing with his cup that he's not even paying attention to whatever is happening around him.
Tony feels his entrance pulsate as he takes all of Steve's seed in, he can feel the hot, creamy semen pump into him, painting his insides and his entire being becoming Steve's in this exhilarating notion, and his own cock pulses with the thought. Tony feels some of it leak outside and hears the plop of a few drops on the floor. Steve's super-soldier orgasms were always... voluminous.
Before Steve could muster a reply, Tony cuts quick- "and these will probably heal quick but I don't know about that.", Tony gestures at Steve's bandaged sternum.
"Swear to God, Tony, I'll land your ass outside."
Steve, being the smart ass he is, knows exactly where Tony is but he's not going to give the genius exactly what he wants without a little delay.
He broke his home with his own two hands.
"Okay, fine."
He rests his hand on the other man's cheek, gently rubbing the five o'clock shadow which stirs him into light wakefulness as he hums in pleasure.
Tony storms into the room, angrily and throws open the large oak doors of the cupboard, revealing a large assortment of neatly folded racks of clothes.
"Oh.."
Tony just grabs the first aid box from the drawer next to the bed and places it on the floor next to him while he sizes up the cuts on Steve's body.
"Ha-ha Tones. Ugh!", he grabs at his neck as he twists it around, grimacing.
"Congratulations, Tones!! I'm so proud of you."
The soldier chuckled in response before:
.....
Tony grabs the suture needle and thread.
Unbeta'd so please mention if any mistakes or discrepancies.
Steve turned his head to the other side and awoke fully as the light pinched through the glass, forcing him to squint and blink a few times in response to the stimuli of the golden sun outside peeking through the hill, fully aware of the soft weight on him, encapsulating him with their sleek arms and dancer legs and the lithe frame shifting gently atop him.
Steve Rogers loves Tony Stark.
"Yeah, he's getting better now that I'm here."
Steve studies his reflection in the shiny elevator door and only one thing can describe him- he's a mess.
He would be such a good father to Peter, chatting and laughing with their son, that Tony forgot his own woes with Steve as he gazed at them and felt a whirlwind of familial contentment settle into him, knowing that at least their child was not affected.
Initially, Tony was terrified of being a parent, fearing that he would follow in his father's footsteps. All it took from Steve was a generous amount of patience and explaining that Tony would never be his father, that he was better than him and that he would be a great dad to their kid. Slowly, Tony came to terms with his traumatic childhood. It took him a great deal to get over the fear, the anxiety, the overburdening pain of his past but he worked through it with Steve by his side.
Steve pulls up to his driveway and parks the car in his basement.
"Steve was in the army too, platypus."
"Tony, just listen.."
"Tony, just pick it up."
For the magnitude of two whole years. And give or take a few months.
"I want to be yours, Steve. I want the world to know I'm yours. And that you're mine. You have been ever since we met in DC. Please, Steve. Please."
"Tony-"
As Steve rides up the elevator, his thoughts are preoccupied with only one entity.
In a lightning fast movement, Steve lifted Tony off the ground and clutched him close, one arm at his chest and another at his waist, Tony's back still to his chest, all the while still nuzzling his goddamn beard through Tony's shoulder blades and nape as Tony sputtered and gasped at the tingling sensation from behind.
"I love you, Steve Rogers. I love you."
Updates won't be this usual. I think I've hit a block for now. Sorry and thank you.
They lock gazes with each other now. They've missed each other so much even for the short span of 5 months they've been separated. Every simple thing reminded them of each other.
"Tony, are you ok, sweetheart?”
The family decided to move to New York as Steve got promoted to director of national security and was the head of their new division, S.H.I.E.L.D. It worked for their favour as Tony could head the new sector of his company on the eastern seaboard and Peter could get better opportunities as a student.
"No."
Eventually, Tony glanced at Steve mid-way during his speech and noticed he was making goo-goo eyes at him.
"Hey, Rhodey?"
Here's a new update. I'll bring in more characters soon hopefully.
"I don't know..."
"Tony, I...."
The other man's hand was clutched tight at Steve's shoulders, the left being a prosthetic metal one which looked rather brilliantly crafted as his waist was pressed flush to Steve's naked chest. His head was thrown back and his mouth was agape, long strands of hair falling from his skull. The blonde was peppering the other man's chest with kisses, his tongue flicking over a nipple as his hands were clasped tightly at the small of the other man's back.
The serum did it's full work, enabling Steve to be there in no time as he came to an almost undignified screeching halt in front of the King.
To reconcile.
All that comes out is a letter.
"I'm going to clean up. You head upstairs and sleep, alright?”
He feels
"You're leaking sap, aga- ohhhh.... Oh fuck! Steve!”
Steve swallows again and ducks out through the door of the bedroom, tiptoeing down the stairs and heads out of the house through the back door, quietly shutting it close before latching it from the inside.
Angst filled warning. Don't hate me.
It's slow at first. Tears trickling down his face and chin, dropping onto the floor beneath his propped up legs and then it gets a little more intense, as his breath hitches and his heart clenches tightly in its cage, unable to take the pain anymore.
"Jesus, fuck, Tony, you're... You're so fucking beautiful sweetheart. I love you. I love you so much, Tonyyyyyy.."
I fucking did it. No. No, oh God. My God, what have I done?
He works his way up Steve's limbs before he reaches the body, which seems to be where the cuts are the worst.
After that, the sweet caresses, the loving gestures and the passionate love-making came to a halt. Steve always claimed he was going on business trips and late night conference meetings and he came home well past midnight every time, cheeky cunt that he was.
Steve bites his cheek as he tries to process the info
The hand holds out a brass coloured coin in front of him, beckoning him to accept.
They ran off to Hawaii for their honeymoon and that was when they first made love.
"Steve's calling."
"You know how Steve is! If I'm not at home without telling him, he throws a fucking hissy fit! Remember the last time we went out together?"
Eventually, Tony can't take the tease and pinches Steve's arms. That's all the soldier needs before he starts bouncing Tony on him, using his hips and thighs to fuck up into Tony so furiously, he's lost in the pleasure of being inside the smaller man and he doesn't realize he's chattering Tony's name into his ears while nipping his earlobe and resting his stubble on Tony's exposed shoulder.
"Sorry, I got caught up with some stuff."
All he can say is whatever feelings he has for Tony have and will always be intense and full of passion.
Tony just blinks at the face, looking over at her with ample concern and just nods in response.
Tony heads to Steve and holds the glass to his lips.
Steve can't seem to comprehend but he knows that right now, he can't seem to think straight because of Bucky's doing and it distracts him. Pleasure is shooting through his spine, engorging his cock through the briefs as they tent painfully. He pushes his briefs off and grabs Bucky by the hips, pulling him close to his chest.
Tony is about to throw his empty cup and leave when Carol wallops him in a bear hug, squeezing him so endearingly that it chokes all the air out of him.
"So, I was-"
Tony goes silent, choking up as he finally lets out his anguish in short sobs.
"Nope, I think I'll be getting it tomorrow, I guess..."
Tony turns his head and kisses Steve's ear. The Captain releases him from the bear hug and smiles down at him. He lifts Tony's chin and frames his face in his big hands, before bringing down a big sloppy kiss down onto the smaller man's forehead again.
There's a long pause as Steve just sits there, hanging his head and scratching the table with his fingers.
"What the fuck is this?", he gestures to the room.
"No, Tones. I'm glad."
The figures arm lies across Steve's midsection and he feels a hot rise of shame jog through him, paralleling lust and heartache.
Tony snorts in response.
Steve felt like he was on cloud nine! His body tensed up immediately but his soul felt like a Christmas tree, all lit up and fanciful. Slowly, he mellowed against the kiss and hooked his arm on Tony's waist, pulling him closer with a jerk as he smiled against his lips and kissed him more intently, more passionately.
The fear grips him by the throat and holds him in a vice-like grip, choking him, untill not a single molecule of air lies within his lungs. His breathing is a little laboured, not as bad as he presumed it would be when he got the news. That he's getting a visitor. Who comes in peace after everything that has happened. Tony's putting up a brave fight with the rest of his body and trying therapeutic techniques to calm himself down but he feels the tremors traveling through his body because of unwarranted fear. Fear and perhaps a bit of terror- it's ghastly breath tracing it's serpentine path, slow and eerily, down the back of his neck and length of his spine, initiating volatile trepidations that rock his very being. An icy bite traverses throughout his body as he brings a hand to meddle with the knot of the tie, sitting at the hollow of his throat, and smooth it down repeatedly, trying to feel the soft velvet and let it's smooth, silky texture of the fabric calm his nerves as little as they could.
"Here's your twenty year chip."
Tony noticed Steve drifting away slowly and tried to make amends, to fix this quietly, thinking the fault was within himself. He tried everything he could. Planning romantic dinners at home, pampering Steve with gifts and coupons and tickets to a four-day getaway in the Bahamas, tried to spice things up in the bedroom - all to no avail. Steve favoured his excuses saying he was not hungry, he couldn't get holidays from work and closing his eyes during sex, barely touching Tony even as Tony used to place both of his hands right on Steve's chest, his right hand always feeling the thudding pump of his heart, as he kept thrusting in him like he just wanted to be done with this, beckoning him to let him back inside so that he could fix whatever was wrong. He was terrified of confronting Steve, thinking that he would leave him and Peter, finally breaking everything off, not wanting to live this lie anymore.
The script is near flawless and looks so beautiful that Steve knows Tony took his time to write this down and elucidate his feelings, which was good. It was better than Tony drowning his sorrows in alcohol and sleeplessness, at this point, all tantamount to Steve's doing.
He was supposed to tell Tony tomorrow, if he was here. Well, Tony said he'd come back tomorrow evening and then Steve would tell him. He'd finally confess and let Tony react however. Well, he won't have a choice but to listen or bear the aftermath of whatever happens.
Steve's feral intensity built up as he began to bite and lick at Tony's neck and shoulders, sending waves of pleasure-pain throughout the mechanic.
"I didn't know you'd like my beard this much."
Tony truly thought they were beyond repair.
"Come on, Mr. Stank. Don't get your knickers in a twist."
Steve feels Bucky's hips grind down upon him, causing him to go flush with want. Bucky kneels for a while before settling back down slowly, aiming his entrance to engulf Steve's length.
Nat barks out the order and Steve simply obeys sheepishly, setting down the croissant and the cup on the table, before swallowing thickly as Natasha watches his every move.
A short pause later, the same voice calls out.
"Platypus, do you plan on sleeping on the couch tonight?"
Steve stands at the edge of the living room, horrified.
"Yeah, sure, like I'd let you go to jail for those two."
"Stay here."
As Steve pounds up into Tony, Tony grabs his hair and yanks his head back, to lick a long stripe throughout his foliage.
"Sit down, Steve."
"I missed you so fucking much, baby. I love you. I'm so glad to be here."
He would play with Peter as much as he could, whenever he got time until the two of them passed out wherever they were, with Pete curled into Steve's arms or lying on him so sweetly that it would melt Tony's poor heart into a puddle.
When they separated, both whined at the loss of contact and they ended up pecking each other on the lips multiple times, evoking wet smooching sounds from another in dramatic effect.
Steve's build always impressed him, right from the start but now he wants nothing more than to butcher all that beef with a cleaver.
Oh God.....
He felt the soft scraping of finely trimmed beard hairs rub the left of his chest, right above his heart, as the form on top of him shifted a little to avoid the light and he couldn't help but smile at the small "mmph" in the other voice. He felt his heart swell as the form's grip on him tightened, their limbs in an effort to encircle him fully but falling adorably short.
"Where's Brunhilde?"
"And hey, we have our little Spider-ling to take care of!"
Dag-nab serum.
They got real close as they worked more and more together. Nat seemed to project a tough exterior, result of the constant war she's waged against the world, but deep down, she was a huge softie.
“Look,” Bucky said with a resigned sigh when Steve continued to stare down at his shirt as if he could will it to transform.  “Grab something out of my closet.  It’ll be too tight on you.  He’ll probably love it.”
Steve looked up at him from where he sat in front of the fire, scraping a whetstone across his sword. When he dipped it in the bowl of water next to his feet, it came away dripping a dark brown that painted his sword in long rivulets that almost looked like veins.   He looked at Tony curiously for a moment, then dipped his head back to his task.  Tony flopped back against the pillows on the massive bed that took up one wall of the room and picking at the soft furs that covered it.
ideas.  Do not lessen them for having been your own. God knows, I never do,” Tony quipped, the corners of his mouth quirking up.
Wow, Steve really was a fanboy, Tony thought, then promptly passed the fuck out.
“If you’d just—“ Tony started.
The thing with Steve was, he could question Tony’s decisions and somehow manage not to make Tony question himself, which was a God-damn Christmas miracle when you got right down to it.   And if they sometimes did their talking over a Lord of the Rings marathon, while Steve shouted at Aragorn to form a shield wall on the high ground in front of the Black Gate and then got so frustrated when they just let Sauron’s army completely surround them that the bowl of popcorn in his lap ended up all over the floor when he stood up to apparently make his point more thoroughly by yelling at the screen, well, all the better as far as Tony was concerned.
“Be there soon,” Happy called out from the driver’s seat.
“No returns,” Tony said quickly as they walked up the graffiti-covered stairs into the building.
“I’m fine. Really. It’s fine. I’m—“ Steve broke off, looking over to the mismatched shelves where the line of not-bowls sat.  Tony reached out and covered Steve’s fisted hand with his own, giving it a squeeze, and drawing Steve’s gaze back to him.
“That’s—I do. I do, Tony.  At least, I think I do. It’s easier to believe when I’m with you.  Does that make sense?” Steve asked, looking down at his lap.
“Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I’m going to blow things up. But, you know, for science,” Rhodey responded with a grin.
“We figured it out,” Tony reminded him, voice rough and low, nearly shaking with the effort to keep himself steady. He was weaving slightly in place, swaying in that crackling space between them. There shouldn't be space between them. Them. Tony's mind kept repeating that word, sending a pulse of hot, tight sensation spiking through him each time. He swallowed heavily, mouth parting, and watched Steve's eyes widen and face flush, color riding high on his cheeks. Under Tony's hands, he could feel Steve's body stiffen. Fight or flight, Tony thought, somewhat hysterically.
The drawing, still not quite finished despite feverishly working on it through the morning while Tony slept, was stowed in an empty drawer in the chest in his room.  The space socks currently sitting atop a bag of potatoes in his cart would probably join the drawing in his nearly empty drawer.  He didn’t want to give them to Tony until he knew they weren’t wrong in some unfathomable way.  He didn’t want Tony to look at him like that again, like he had with the Jetsons, with that strange kind of surprise, that knowing sense of wrongness, that people got when Steve messed up.
“He’s going to do just fine. Aren’t you, U?”  Steve asked.  U beeped what could only be described as a skeptical sounding chirp at him, making Tony roll his eyes.
“You called me,” Steve said after a moment.  He sounded slightly uncomfortable.  Maybe it was carrying Tony up four flights of stairs, though to be honest, Steve didn’t really sound the least bit winded.
“Nice?” Bucky repeated, completely unconvinced.
“Oh, for the love--I haven’t even touched you yet,” Steve snapped back as he glared down at where Tony lay on the cot, his head pillowed on a dark green Army blanket that had clearly been providing nesting material for various animals for quite some time by the frayed edges and carefully chewed holes that covered it.  “Would you be still?”  Tony grunted in response, but stopped trying to turn himself into a human pretzel, whether because Steve asked it of him or because it just hurt too damned much, Steve wasn’t sure.
Steve pleaded
Tony’s heart froze in his chest.  Panic speared a trail down Tony’s spine and twisted through his gut, knocking whatever words he was going to say out of his throat.
Desolation and dread opened a pit in Steve’s stomach, churning slowly and sickeningly toward certainty.  Tony knew Steve had asked Cam about it.
“Show me your phone screen, then, Mr. Staying Out of It,” Rhodey countered.  Tony ignored him, of course.  “That’s what I thought.”
“Anthony, would you show Captain Rogers to the dining room, please?”  Maria requested.
Did you…was this…you aren’t serious.  You didn’t.  Because of what I—that was stupid!  I told you!  I was being an idiot, for crying out loud,
“Uh, the Jetsons? Cartoon. From the sixties, I think? But, there was, like, a reboot in the eighties. Astro the dog, Rosie the robot? None of that ring a bell?” Tony asked, momentarily bewildered. Come on, Steve was older than him, but he wasn't
“He agrees,” the translator said, giving Tony a quick, encouraging smile.
“I think they like you, too,” Steve told him.
The irony was, if Obie had just told him, if he had explained…they were Tony’s people, too, after all.  Or they had been, once, long ago, before his parents died.  Before Obie. Before a lot of things.  Of course, there had been no choice offered.  When had there ever?  It didn’t matter, he told himself.  He was here now, and all he could do was hope the man agreed.  That was the right thing to do, he knew.  What did he matter against the lives of his people?  What did any of it matter, when you scraped all the layers off?  He would be traded to this man or someone else.  At least with this, there was no illusion of what it was.  No fancy words, no priest to bless it, no pretense of ceremony.  It was a bargain. That was all.  At least, he supposed, it was an honest one, assuming this barbarian had any concept of honor.
“Seriously. One time.  Years ago.  And only because James, that bastard, said the thing wasn’t a real horse and couldn’t—couldn’t—you know,” Clint muttered, making a rude gesture with his hand.  “Which, let me assure you, it can.  It very much can, okay?  And we will just leave it at that.  I hate you all, by the way,” Clint gritted out, though he finally got the horse to stop circling and pick a direction, which unfortunately, happened to be back the way they came.
“Track my—you can do that?” Tony said, pulling the phone away from his ear and staring down at it. “No, you can’t.”
“No?” Steve guessed, frowning.
Please let me not be wrong about this, Tony beseeched a power he didn't believe in, raising his eyes to the ceiling, where a dark, brown water stain looked a bit like the shape of Texas.
“Please,” Steve said.
“Promise me that you won’t attack the Free States or the ships going there. Swear it to me, Tony, and I won’t,” Steve stopped, and thought,
(See the end of the chapter for
“I also seem to be out of coffee,” Steve continued. “I make a mean cup of vaguely-coffee flavored hot water though.”
Together.
Steve turned his face towards the mountains again, then looked down and scuffed his shoe through the dirt and gravel that made a makeshift driveway.
“He’s still kind of ticked about the press conference,” Tony explained with a grimace.  “I should’ve told him.  Before I did that, I mean.  Not like I don’t get where he’s coming from.  He’s SI’s Air Force liaison.  Kind of a big deal if we cut off production in the middle of contracts, not to mention what’s in the pipeline.  He says the lawyers already called him, told him not to talk to me.”
Then the feeling was gone, and Tony was sliding back out, catching just the bulbous head of his cock on Steve’s lips, and blessed air flowed into Steve’s lungs, lifting him, inflating him, and he was falling, floating, he didn’t know, and then Tony pushed his cock past Steve’s lips again and all the way down his throat with a single thrust.  Steve couldn’t suck, couldn’t swallow, couldn’t do anything, except let Tony have this, and God, it felt so good, so amazingly wonderful, to just be.  In and out, short, shallow thrusts that rammed into his mouth and made his body shake, punctuated by the long, slow glide of Tony’s cock over his tongue and down, down, the tip scraping along the back of Steve’s throat almost torturous in the care and gentleness for such an act.  The air would come and go, and Steve would forget to breathe, forget that he needed to, and his body would go tight, his mind lost to everything except that next, sweet bit of air, so cold, it burned a path down the rawness of his throat.
“This is my fault,” Tony said.  “I failed you.  Countless others, by the sounds of it, but you—I would not see you hurt for all that I have in the world, Steve, you must know this,” he whispered in a broken, urgent plea.
, something could happen.  He ground his teeth together and shook his head in frustration as he dove back into the fray to engage a Doombot trying to make a bus into a battering ram.  Steve was giving orders, which the team was actually following, miracle of miracles, even Tony, because it would make Steve happy.  Well, he mostly listened anyway, so huge leap ahead, people, best to  focus on that.
“You’ll want to be careful how you address His Highness,” Rhodes cut in.
“Don’t give him the reactor,” Steve said abruptly.   “I don’t care what he says about what’s happening with the company or how much the company needs it.”
“Buck, don’t.  It’s fine.  Tony was just leaving,” Steve explained.
“Just an idea,” Steve shrugged and leaned back against the sofa, his hands fisted on his legs against a sudden, phantom pressure. “Forget it.”
“I’m glad,” Steve said in almost a whisper as he turned away from Tony and looked out the window.  “I wanted it to be perfect, but, I’ll take nice.” Tony felt another squeeze, and then Steve slipped his hand out of Tony’s and pushed open the limo door.
“Lucky week more like it,” Stane said.  He tossed his own bet into the Don’t Come pile, essentially betting against Steve’s roll.  Steve rolled an eleven and the woman next to him whooped excitedly.
Tony looked down the road, but didn’t see anything for another few seconds.  Two lights crested the hill, and soon enough, a black SUV pulled into one of the parking spots farthest away from the damaged guardrail, followed, somewhat improbably—though what about this night was following any kind of predictable pattern?--by a red convertible coupe, which double parked next to where the Audi used to be.
“We’re going to lose our deposit,” Tony deadpanned, then broke out in a wickedly gleeful round of laughter, curling in on himself while he tried to let the moment pass.  “I’m going to have so much fun with you,” Tony told him after he managed to get his humor under control.
Steve stared at him for a moment, still rather stunned that Stark could ever describe his bodyguard so flippantly, and confused when the man seemed to be moved with genuine emotion when Steve pushed back.
“Captain America is drooling on me,” Tony remarked, watching a long line of spittle make its way down Steve’s chin and onto the arm of the suit that was wrapped around Steve’s waist.  “’Naught that will last’?” Tony demanded.  “Captain America is drooling on me, and you’re telling me not to worry because this is going to wear off eventually?  Eventually, when, exactly?  How many Wiggles videos are we talking about having to watch here?”
“I have thought on what you told me.  I know it is…difficult for you to speak of it.  Your war.  But, you may well be the only one in the entire kingdom who has faced Hydra and lived to tell of it.  I would be a fool to ignore that,” Tony replied.
“It appears someone hacked my system and deleted all records relating to you,” she explained.  “I have outstanding security protocols.  That should not have happened.  That’s what I mean about the power dynamics, Steve.  Stark…Stark is too big to fail, see?  Not much I can do to get at him.  Even if I had anything, the politicos and power brokers would just circle the wagons.  He’s one of them, after all.  On the other hand…what do you suppose would happen if you casually mention one day that you don’t think you’re being treated just right by the agency?”
“Think he’ll bring the shield?” Rhodey asked, then bobbled his head back and forth, considering.  “I think he’ll bring the shield.”
“Your Highness,” Marshall Strucker interrupted, making Steve and Tony both turn in startle, as if they had mutually forgotten the others were still there.  “If you would like, we could continue—”
be here!" Tony snapped, finally finding his voice. "Buddy, I sent you
There really was only one thing—okay, two things—that Steve was afraid of.  Losing Tony and Peter, and HYDRA.
"His son who's named Peter, Peter," added Gamora. "Remember?"
"I know," Steve said as he cupped Tony's cheek, his thumb tracing softly along his cheekbone. "But I'm going to anyway." And then he dipped his head and kissed him, one of
And now that he had, he’d found that he often couldn't get enough.  He and Tony had spent hours making out before they ever had sex, and even now, spending most of his nights with Tony in his bed, Steve found that he still loved the sweet intimacy of kissing his beloved.
It was almost too good to be true.
Tony flinched at the mention of Steve, and he grabbed onto the back of the couch, trying to keep himself from tipping over.
“Yes, please,” Steve whispered, his heart already hammering.  He knew Tony was trying to joke the tension away, but he also knew he would feel much more comfortable asking for a kiss inside the store than sitting in the car.  “I’d—I’d like that.”
"That's 'cause we're getting ready to bring you home, honey," Tony said quickly. "You just sit back and enjoy the ride now, okay? JARVIS is gonna do all the work."
"Please, just let me go into the nothing!" Peter cried. "The nothing means no pain, no dreams! Please, I'm just so tired!"
followed directly by a nearly blinding overhead light and two sets of footsteps walking towards his cell, one heavy and one lighter.
And that was something that Steve could not allow.
“What in the goddamn
Tony thought as he twisted to his left, repulsing away another flying chariot and grinning behind his faceplate at the alien's cry of shock.
Tony scoffed, tipping his forehead against Steve's collarbone. "You know you don't have to worry about me so much, Steve. I'm not made out of glass, remember?"
“All the calls?” Peter asked, barely daring to hope.  “Every single one?”
And himself, of course, even if he wouldn't currently call the horror-induced haze he was in 'living'.
"Nope, none of that kinda talk now," Steve said with a frown. "You're an amazing father, Tony, and I know it because I see it with my own eyes every single day. Peter's so lucky to have you."
Heaving a heavy sigh, Tony tipped his head back against the couch, closing his eyes and kneading his temples. "It was the same night as that whole mess at the theatre, which is the main reason why I didn't say anything at the time. That day was already bad enough without adding something else to the mix."
"Would you want me to shave you, honey? Might help you feel a bit better."
, but Tony caught his underlying intent anyway. "I have some very fond memories of that place, sweetheart, and I was just thinking—"
"So, have you been out to see the kid yet?" Carol asked once she set her glass down, waving the waitress over for another. "How old is he now?"
Peter gulped, his brown eyes going even wider. "Well… then we'll have to make sure that doesn't happen, right?"
Steve watched his teammates file out of the room, turning to Tony once they were alone to find him idly tracing his finger along the chain holding Steve's dog tags underneath his shirt. He was deep in thought, and judging from the tight set of his jaw and the slight narrowing of his eyes, it wasn't a particularly good thought.
Captain Steven Grant Rogers, ace test pilot for the Langaran Air Corps, was now a married man.
He could not afford to screw up his relationship with Tony.  Not when it was the only thing keeping him anchored.
"You're doing it again," Gwen said as they turned a corner.
“Hmph.  You talk like I’m the only one,” said Bucky.  “Pretty sure it’s been fucked up for a lot of us.  Including you.”
"Uh huh."
"Yeah, I could see that," Uncle Bucky said after a short pause. "But somehow I doubt that they're just sitting around on their asses either."
Steve sniffed, whispering a quick, "Thank you" as Bucky threw his metal arm around Peter's shoulders and guided him over to the table, where a nurse was waiting to treat him.
button on his iPod and lifts his head, glancing around the room at his competition.  There’s Bucky, Steve’s Team USA teammate who beat him at the Olympic trials to take the top spot in the 100 free, the freestyle slot on the medley relay, the lead-off position on the free relay, as well as the second slot in the 100-metre butterfly.  Other than the fact that he beat Steve in the trials, Bucky seems like a really nice guy.  An Army vet who decided to go to college on the GI Bill after his four years were done, Bucky started swimming to strengthen his left arm after it was injured on one of his tours, and the rest, as they say, is history.
"Yeah, probably," Peter cut in. "Let me double-check with Gwen first, okay? Hopefully she'll be back at school tomorrow." Gwen's little brothers had been passing a respiratory bug back and forth for about the last month or so, and she had finally succumbed to it the day before. Peter had asked JARVIS to send some chicken soup and a bouquet of tulips to her house before he'd left for school that morning, and he could still feel the flush on his neck from the thank-you text she'd sent him once they'd arrived.
Peter frowned, choosing to ignore the question about Dad. "I told you. I'm here to get you out of here." He quickly scanned their surroundings, searching for anything that resembled an exit and hoping that he wouldn't have to heft Papa up the wall to the window he'd snuck through to get in.
'Resembled.' Past tense.
" answered Steve. "Only this time, it was… different."
"He did?" Steve asked. "Then you guys must know that—"
"Yeah." Tony leaned back, raising his arms over his head to try and stretch out his tight shoulders. "Well, I'm gonna keep poking around down here, see what else I can find. May as well have as much evidence as possible for the court martials, right?"
Peter's round cheeks immediately flushed a deep pink, causing both Tony and Bucky to smirk. "Um… it's coming. I was telling Uncle Bucky some stuff about it while you were talking to the Damage Control people."
In the meantime, spending time with Peter had already considerably brightened both Bucky and Sam’s moods.  Especially when he started referring to them as ‘Uncle Sam’ and ‘Uncle Bucky’ after only knowing them for a couple of days.
Tony groaned. Fixing the dumb ship had already taken a lot longer than he'd thought it would, and the thought of waiting yet another ten hours only to find out that there was still more to fix disturbed him in ways he had no desire to admit. But if getting the tesseract off of Earth was as important as Thor said it was, then he really had no other choice in the matter.
Tony held Peter's hand as the medics took hold of the stretcher, guiding it towards the door. At the last second he grabbed the worn notebook from Peter's bedside table, tucking it under his arm as they stepped outside, the red flashing lights of the transport vehicle almost too bright against the somber darkness of the neighbourhood. Climbing into the transport after Peter, Tony glanced back up at the house to see Howard standing in the doorway, his head down and his shoulders curled in.
"Ah, yeah," answered Tony. "The Toomes girl, her old man is one of our salvage contractors." He paused as he took note of Steve's shaking lower lip and twitching fingers, both signs of his anxiety starting to take hold. "You're not thinking that she invited Pete to the party because her dad's been stealing from Damage Control, are you? 'Cause even if he is, that'd be a pretty gutsy move."
Shame washed through Steve like a flood as he glanced over Tony's shoulder, avoiding his eyes. All of his skin prickled like he'd been sunburned, but he hadn't thought it was all that bad until he saw Tony's reaction.
"Indeed I do, sir."
"All right. As soon as you deem it safe, take the shot."
Tony turned his head, kissing Steve on the jaw. "I hope you're right."
“You did?” Peter exclaims.  “Holy crap, Dad!  How much was that worth?”
Bucky shrugged. "That's what I thought too, but when I asked him that, all Петр did was laugh at me. Then he showed me some stupid little video about a road work sign that he thought was funnier 'n hell, but it still didn't help."
