Tony gazed at the lake his head tilted to the side; it was only a few seconds before he finds himself standing on the deck near the lake, gazing at the still water that looks black in the dark of the night, it was a little bit before dawn came and paint the still surface of the lake with oranges and yellows. "I have nowhere to go…" Tony whispered, not taking his eyes away from the inky blackness that was staring back at him. "I don't have a home to go to if you forced me out, this is the only safe place to raise her, please… just don't hurt her, I don't care if you hurt me, just not her." Tony closed his mouth, his mind going over the conversation he heard a week ago, disgust, fear, and pain warring inside his mind, and Tony wondered, if he will be forced against his will to bed whoever living deep in the lake if he wanted to keep his baby safe, it was true that he didn't plan for the child in his belly, nor he liked how she was conceived, but she was his, she was what kept him moving and kept his sanity intact.
Tony sighed gently to himself humming as a smile took over his sleepy face, snuggling behind him toward the warmth that surrounded him. The soft breaths behind him, made his toes curl in pleasure and his heart to flutter happily in his chest, the Omega's hand made its way to caress the arm that was hugging him, pulling him closer to the large body behind him, nearly making Tony melt at that display of possessiveness.
Years ago when Nebula was sent to invade earth, the resistance she met was not only that of the Avengers but also in the form of a stupid witch and her brother with their big bloodthirst and want of revenge; the stupid witch threw all of Nebula's full prove plans away when she cast a spell on the Space Stone, trying to close the portal fast so that the human called Iron Man will be forever lost in space. Unfortunately for the witch the space stone shoot toward space but Iron Man managed to return to earth before the portal close, something that made the witch snarl and scream as she was forced to retreat to lick her wounds in peace.
"Tony!" Steve's happy voice, caused Tony to purr happily as he was pulled back from behind into a tight hug, curtsy of his handsome husband who appeared behind him. Not soon as Steve held Tony, the Avengers trickled down to find them, mainly to glare at Tony and threaten him silently to break up with Steve, which was a stupid thing honestly; even after five years, the hostility was still up the roof, and Bucky was still trying to assassinate Tony every time he had, which was cute in a way. "…What is that?" Steve finally asked after he let Tony go, his eyes finally caught the sight of the baby in his arms.
"Say Bucky, why don't the two of us go shopping today?" Steve asked, a huge grin took over his face at the thought of being out of the house, maybe he will get to know Bucky better and the two of them will become friends! Bucky though only gave a choking noise as he gazed at Steve with wide eyes like Steve has lost his mind, but the Omega won't take any offense to it, it seems that Bucky was the shy type, too shy, and still didn't get the hang of being out of the military, Steve was sure that a day out will do Bucky good, the Alpha didn't leave the house since he came here! "Come on Bucky, you and me, just us! We can go shopping in any mall you want, I can even show you around Manhattan and you can see the changes that took place in the last decade! My treat I promise!" Steve was starting to get excited at the thought of finally leaving the house, and enjoying a day out, maybe he can sneak a dozen or two pieces of clothes in Bucky's dresser, the man doesn't seem to have much, and he was angry at his oversight, but not as angry as he was at Tony, for ignoring his brother or and not helping him financially when he was loaded and running SI.
"Blue is really your color, it brings out your eyes." Steve answered him with a proud grin, causing the Alpha to give a small smile, and it was the first time that Steve saw the Alpha smiled ever since he starts living with them which made Steve a little proud of himself. "Say what, why don't we go to the barbershop we saw on the second floor, after that, we are going to the food court." Steve grinned as he held Bucky's arm in his, and start dragging him to the cashier, he wondered if they also have delivering serves, for Steve was sure he had bought half of their shop.
"He is my husband… step away from the closet, Carter, now!" Steve's low and dangerous voice growled, and Tony couldn't help the sob that left him as his tight muscles finally uncoiled enough for him to take a breath, feeling like centuries has passed with him drowning before finally taking a breath of the sweet, sweet oxygen. "Hand me the gun…" Steve used his Alpha voice on that order, and even Tony had to flinch when he felt the need to obey the order, but Tony can't fault his husband for restoring to this measure, not when Carter lost it and broke into their home uninvited to steal Peter and hurt him.
Steve saw how Bucky's face flushed red at Steve's question, and he wondered for a second what the brunette was thinking of that his cheeks turn rosy red. "Well, most first dates are a dinner and a movie type of things, but there is a lot of different ideas and activity, like going on a walk, or going to dance, a lot of things really, but most importantly is enjoying your date, why?" Bucky said after a while of silence, looking at Steve with wide eyes, hope and anticipation hiding in them making Steve feel a little guilty.
"…Ma and Pa are coming here, soon. You can't imagine how ecstatic they were to learn that you finally woke up... we have been waiting, Stevie… it was seven long years…" Becky said through her sobs, causing Steve to raise his head to take the woman in, taking how young and vulnerable she was, how her words were sincere without any lies or deceit.
Steve doesn't know what happened, or how he did it; one second he was screaming and begging his useless body to wake up, and the next he was standing over a woman, a broken chair in his hand, and the woman's unconscious body on the ground. "Peter…" Steve's voice cracked as he called out; gazing around the place as he swayed on his feet, fear gripping him tightly when he didn't see the small boy anywhere. "Peter!" Steve's voice became louder as he called out, his breath coming in fast buffs as he let go of the broken chair, taking shaky steps hoping that Peter is fine.
The broken sound of Peggy made Steve freeze in his place; he strained his ears to hear more.
Walking toward the boat, Tony wondered if he was really going crazy, he wondered if him not sleeping for the past few days was finally catching to him. It was probably his sleep-deprived mind that gave him enough courage to push the boat into the water; it was probably his tired mind that made him take the oars and row. There wasn't a destination in Tony's mind, there wasn't any place he wanted to reach with his boat; he just wanted to do something that doesn't make him feel crazy even when Tony was sure he has finally lost his marbles.
"What if I lost the baby, Steve? I can't… I can't…" Tony took a shuddered gasp, turning toward Steve and holding into him tightly, letting out a whine as he hide his face in Steve's neck, taking his mate calming scent to stop the panic attack that wanted to take hold of him.
"Then you know what I feel…" That made Sam sighs and looks at Tony for one last time; he then opened his desk and gives a card toward Tony, who looked at the numbers that were printed on the card and smiled, giving Sam his card with his personal phone number on the back.
The question made Tony shake his head with a sad smile. "Because someone told me sad news today, I guess I wasn't ready to hear them." Tony then stood counting the pictures and returned them to the envelope and put it in the inner pocket of his suit least he lost them.
Hvítur Úlfur: - This title means White Wolf
After that day at the get together with Sarah, you can say that Tony's mood did get better a little by little, especially when he sees little Peter from time to time, and the small pup is always happy to tell Tony about his adventures, Sarah, on the other hand, warm up to him considerable, before the two of them have been… well not strangers, but you can call them friends on lose terms, but Sarah always seemed to want to get to know him better after the get-together. Steve on the other hand… he was something else completely, and Tony may admit that he was interested in the Alpha… just a little bit… the man was funny and considering, the two of them had spent the whole get together standing near the fence, talking about everything and nothing, sharing jokes and laughs, and keeping an eye on Peter who was playing with the other pups but once in a while the small pup will either run toward Steve or Tony, making the two of them smile at the display… as much as Tony hated to admit it, but his face flushes red when Pepper, Clint, and Carol had teased him about Steve and how the two of them spent the night glued to each other, his flush face made their teasing go up ten volts, which embarrassed Tony to no end, it had been a whole month since the get-together and the three of them didn't seem to want to stop.
When the door to his house was knocked on, Tony looked at the clock to see that it was six in the evening, which made Tony sigh as he went to the door and opened it giving a tired smile to Steve who smiled at the Omega. "How is Peter? I hoped he wasn't a bother when I was away." Steve said as he entered the house after Tony opened the door for him which caused the Omega to pause a little.
"He won't be happy…" Peggy's words made Steven raise his eyebrow at the woman which made her fidget as she looked down on the ground. "Seventy years ago, Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes were mated… married in your words… after Bucky's death, Steve was no longer the same, he was… volatile… the best word to describe him… he may make Tony happy today, but tomorrow, he may make him cry. I don't want someone like this as my Godson's mate, no matter if he was a friend, I don't trust him enough with Tony's heart." Peggy finished her words which made Steven's lips twitch up.
"Crazy? This isn't even me being crazy! We have just started!" Tony snarled as he threw the second ax at Howard, letting out an insane giggle he couldn't hold back, at the sight of Howard turning as pale as a corpse when he barely dodged the flying ax heading for his neck. Tony ran after his father, letting out mad laughs that mixed will with the thunder outside as the sky decided that this time was the best to start up a storm that shook the trees. "Run, bitch, run! Because when I catch you, it is game over for you!" Tony laughed as he pulled the ax from the wall it lodges in, jumping after Howard and ignoring his mother's scream as he steps on her cat's tail.
"Sleeping, he tired himself from how much he cried… maybe the two of you should rest so that tomorrow you will have clear minds to be able to talk to each other." Steve whispered which made the younger man nod then pause a little.
"I'm sorry… I'm going to fix it later." She grumbled making Steve sighs and start the car once more. "What's the name of Clint's mistress?" Natasha asked Steve which made the older man sigh at that and throw the teen an annoyed look.
"Why… why are you here?" Steven asked tiredness trying to pull him back under but Steven pushed back refusing to fall into slumber with the king being near him. Part of the Omega wondered how he managed to fall asleep with the king a few feet away, a fate that never once happened to Steven before he came to his homeland, or as close as his homeland can be when its nothing but burned woods and ashes, not a three days walk around the mountain.
Tony sang under his breath as he walked through rows and rows of candy, putting a few of his and Peter's favorite in his shopping car, continuing his way after crossing them from his list. Usually, Steve and Tony do their shopping together, which meant their trip was one filled with arguing and kisses, trying to convince one another of what's best to bring home this time.
" Tony whispered in Steve's ears, holding tightly into him, not letting Steve move an inch, as if he was afraid that Steve was going to disappear if he did.
I know, I know, you hate me for not updating the past month; it's not my fault though, college is a pain! T^T
So I wanted to inform you that I have published two new Steve/Tony stories.
Steve sighed a little and caresses his lover's face, smiling at the five-o'clock shadow on his lover's face, usually his fiancé always shave, but this day had been hectic and his lover had forgotten. "Anthony Carbonell, get yourself together, I know that if you go you will knock them off their socks." Steve said kissing his fiancé making the Alpha hum and relaxes a little. "I know you can do it, prove to them what you can do." Steve said making Anthony grin at that and kiss Steve one more time before running around the room once more to collect his things.
A soft chapter! Before the angst started!
And Tony is in love with his husband is so cute!
The thing was; Tony's house looked like it was haunted. Not the haunted of the 'Lake monster living near him' haunted, no, but the 'There is a ghost in the house and he is not happy' haunted; just thinking about it made Tony feel silly and a little stupid, but the many incidents that happened made Tony flinch at the memory of them.
In 2009: The events of Iron Man 2, followed by the events of Thor 1.
"Miss Carter, I would ask you nicely to remove yourself from my property, I would also ask you not to try and contact either my husband and child unless it's through your sister and that's only after many doctors and specialists confirm your mental state; any violation to my humble request and I will notify the police immediately," Tony answered in a detached manner, trying to ignore the raging pheromones the angry Omega was letting out as she was gazing at Tony like she is planning on killing him on the spot; Tony had to stay calm, he needed to stay calm, for Steve and Peter… but saying this is easier than done, especially when Tony was feeling unbalance, threatened, and in need of his Alpha who was miles and miles away from home and is not scheduled to come home today.
"What did I say about eavesdropping, Pete?" Tony asked causing the little boy to mumble something in a low voice and hide his face in Tony's chest, an act that made Tony sigh and kiss his boy on the top of his head. "Besides, Steve isn't going to get hurt, baby." Tony assured Peter, getting a skeptical look from the boy in his arms which caused Tony to chuckle. "It's true baby, no harm is going to come to Steve, do you know why?" Tony asked getting a head shake from Peter who was still sniffling. "Because we are the Avengers, and we are going to protect Steve no matter what." Tony assured his boy.
Steve saw worlds that lost everything this way, people losing their homes, their families, their… everything, only to vow on getting revenge, which will cause the cycle of death to spin once more, taking everything in their path until nothing was left unscathed. Steve let out a tired sigh as he gazed at his hands; it seemed like he was going to write the downfall of Anton this time, and it will be more personal than any page of history that Steve wrote in all of his long life.
Waking up Tony realized that there was still a bit time left before it was dawn, which made everything perfect for the Omega, perfect to start with the plan he thought of. The Omega stretched as he sat on the bed, gently removing his Alpha's protective hands away, kissing the Alpha on the cheek and smiling when he felt the beard tickle his lips, a pleasure that Tony only stayed for a few seconds to enjoy before he was up.
Humming pleasantly as he remembered the day that Steve and him agreed to go out on dates and see what the future holds for them, Tony… he always flushes happily when he remembered that day, the day he spent his night kissing Steve and being kissed by him in return until they both got sleepy and fell asleep on the couch waking up the next day by Peter who was too energetic…
Steve didn't know how he finally managed to reach his car, ignoring Bucky's concerned voice as he tried to sway Steve to come back inside, and definitely ignoring Tony's pleas and apologize, not wanting to stay one more minute to hear Tony beg and try to act innocent only to go back to how he was before. It was way past midnight, the roads were dark, and Steve didn't even know how he managed to reach Natasha's apartment without having an accident or something. Everything was a blur, was it because of the tears Steve was shedding or because he was feeling tired or sleepy, Steve didn't know he only knew that he had to reach Natasha before he ended up having a major accident.
"My problem is you nearly killing yourself! Please, Tony, this isn't you!" Howard said as he pointed at the shape Tony was in, and Tony would have admitted he look like death warmed him over, with how thin and pale he was, the dark circles around his eyes didn't help that much.
Tears start clouding Tony's eyes, he could only let out wet gasps when he reached the town that was unlike yesterday, too quiet to be natural, which caused Tony to let out a choked whimper and rush toward where Peggy's office was. Tony was halfway through his destination when he saw the crowd surrounding something, raising his head, he was sure he caught the faint outline of the word 'Rapist' painted on the wall in red, but someone was already trying to wash it away.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter!
Tony fidget nervously as he waited for Steve outside of the Omega's house, heart pounding in his chest while his hands were sweating from being a nervous mess, today Steve finally decided to give him a chance to prove himself, he accepted going out with Tony on a date, just the two of them… now as much as Tony adore his son, his amazing, smart, and precious son, the Alpha still wanted to have a few dates with Steve with just the two of them, mainly because there are some things that are not to be told in front of their son, and another because Tony doesn't want his son to witness his humiliation if the Omega decided that Tony wasn't worth it and throw the pasta dish on top of his head.
"I… I don't know! You got married! I… and I… I don't know…" Harley start sniffling, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his shirt, biting his lower lip hard to stop himself from crying, the action made Steve let out a tired sigh, standing up before coming to sit beside the small boy pulling him in his lap, allowing Harley to hide in Steve's chest. "Mr. Stark wouldn't like that… you got married, so you… you… can't hang out with me anymore." Harley's words were muffled by Steve's shirt but the Alpha did manage to hear him, and it broke his heart hearing the boy say these words.
"It looks perfect." Steve smiled, studying the elegant and beautiful invitation, it was so much better than the fifty-plus ones they were forced to go through; Steve personally didn't think that planning for marriage was this painful, mainly because in his past marriage with Peggy, the Omega wanted to handle everything by herself, refusing Steve's help or input. Tony, on the other hand, liked for the two of them to go through everything together, so far they have finished choose the theme of the wedding, the guests list, the sitting arrangement, the wedding food and cake, the colors they wanted, the place they agreed to host their wedding in, and now they are going through the invitation and later on they will finish their suits, where they will have their honeymoon, and finish some few minors thing that will pop out.
"Tony…" Steve said once he reached the Alpha and Tony had to physically shake his head to focus on what the Omega was saying, to lost in his admiration of the Omega's beauty to understand that he was being talked too, though, Steve did not comment on Tony's strange behavior, but the twitch of his lips, made pride burning inside Tony's chest, especially when he was close to making the Omega smile.
The next time Steve woke up, he woke up to a killer headache pounding in his skull, making him close his eyes tightly in hope of the headache going away soon, a few deep breaths later, the headache becomes bearable, and Steve was able to open his eyes and gaze around the place he was in, frowning when he saw that he was in his bedroom, but with no memory of how he got here.
"Hi, Maria, how are you?" Tony greeted the woman when he entered the library and saw Maria humming as she read her book. At the call of her name, Maria raised her head and frowned when she saw Tony entering the library; admit Tony never entered the library until now. Maria Hill, if memory didn't fail Tony she was Natasha's friend, which meant that his visit to the library would not only be monitor but everyone from Natasha to Fury, to Peggy and Bucky, would learn about him being here… talk about being subtle.
"Well?" Winnie asked looking at her son up and down which made the Alpha shrug his shoulders and hurry toward the house, unfortunately for him, his mother followed him.
"Because six months after his birth, he and his adopted family were killed in a car accident!" Howard's voice cracked as he said the next sentence making Tony shout at that in rage.
Someone, no not someone, some
"Is Peter awake yet?" Steve asked as he walked with Tony to their son's room, it was still a surprise when Steve noticed that he grow up a few inches after his spine straightened because of the serum; Steve was so going to send Howard a gift card the next time he saw him.
So what do you think?
It made the creature wonder and think, and he hates thinking because thinking meant remembering, and remembering meant pain and hurt; but this boy who called him a bully and he was carrying a child which made the creature think, and him hating to think, meant to hate the reason for it, which was the boy who still hasn't left the house when normally all of those who came into his land couldn't last a month in it. Anyway back to the thing he hates the most, thinking; thinking the creature did, and it came to it that the creature doesn't mind the boy staying on his land, only until the baby arrives, and then he will make sure to inform the boy that he needed to leave.
"Just let me go get my coat and the three of us can go." Tony said with a small smile as he rushed to the living room to get his coat from the back of the sofa, cursing himself for being an idiot by putting it here and not on the hanger near the front door, he returned to the pair to see Steve talking with the small pup, and he had to smile when he saw that the little fella was more awake then a few seconds ago.
"Shhhh, it's OK Tony, I'm here, I'm not leaving…" Steve whispered reassurance, holding Tony tightly in his embrace making Tony hold a huff at how strong Steve was holding him; it would probably leave bruises on Tony's body, but it wasn't like Tony would care about it. The bruises Steve was going to leave on his body was just proof that his mate was alive, that his love was with him, here, holding him.
"Of course, Papa, I love Tony." Peter answered looking at Steve with wide innocent eyes, probably wondering why Steve will ask him something like that, which made Steve's lips twitch up.
The sight made a smile tug on the corners of the king's lips, and Anton couldn't help being thankful for the queen's babe for getting his boy out of his shell. A few months ago… no a year ago, his boy would have followed Anton without a word of what he wanted, working with Anton in his workshop just to hide the fact that he didn't have a friend and that the people around the village bully him. No matter how hard Anton tried to make the place more acceptant of his child and the few people who came to them seeking protection, Anton never seemed to manage that; not when the Stone family and some of the elders were sitting on following the old ways.
"Hello there, my star, I hope I did not keep you waiting." Anton said in his gruff voice, which only made him shake his head and smile sadly at the older man, Anton couldn't walk fast anymore, couldn't jump or run, he can only walk slowly that he now reach the age of 90, the older man always talks to him, which made the star shine at the thought of Anton thinking of him as a family to share his secrets with him. "I am sorry, little star, I do not think that I could talk today, will you be so kind as to let these old bones rest under your light for a little while?" Anton said before sighing a little lying on the dirty ground. The star could only smile sadly at the man, knowing what's going on before the mortal did
Day after day his heart broke, and he couldn't handle it anymore, because he knew one more heartbreak and his light will be gone forever, so with that, he went to Sara wanting this all to be over, not wanting to remember anymore, not wanting to fell the heartache anymore, and he was grateful to Sara because she helped him, she helped and in the next century and a half he never gazes at that retched Midgard anymore, and the heartbreak becomes a dull ache, and his love for his Anton become an irritation and anger mixed with little hate, because why wasn't Anton born as a star? It would have been easier if he was born as a star or a God from Asgard or any other realm, because then Steven wouldn't have been forced to see him die again, and again, and again…
"Are you Ok?" Maria asked when Steve walked around the corner to see Maria and trying to calm a shaking Tony and a crying Peter who was whimpering and whining all the while Tony was trying to calm him, Steve sighed at that and nodded his head to Maria which made the woman sigh and turn to Tony.
It was only a minute or so before Pepper's eyes widened as she made heads and tails of the weird shit Tony word-vomited to her and when she did, her face paled. "Are you crazy?" Pepper screamed as she jumped from her chair, walking toward the man with threatening steps, which Tony was grateful for the armor as it was going to protect him from the woman's rage, "You housed an Addams in your house? An Addams? Those crazy sorceresses that live in the cemeteries? What were you even thinking?" The woman screamed as she turned her wild eyes at the poor man who was cowering in his place.
Tony didn't really care about it that much, Harley, Peter, and the little bean he was carrying was one of the best things in his life; Tony can even see the same emotion reflecting in Steve's eyes. As long as his Alpha had his back in this then everyone was going to be OK; it would be nice if his friends stood with him on this. He knew that Howard would just sigh and shake his head, but when it comes to it; his Dad would have his back without another word added. Clint and Winnie would definitely take his side on this, especially when the two of them knew how Tony ended after his first pregnancy, being the main ones who took care of him when he was at his lowest. His friends… well, Tony really didn't know what they would think and how many mixed emotions they would have, they already thought that Steve and he were moving too fast with the adoption, even when they all adored Harley to bits and pieces; he just hoped they would shrug it off as one of his unpredictable treats.
"No child deserves having their only parent taking away from them, even if that parent is a heartless Alpha like you." Steven stated after a few minutes, giving the Alpha a once over, before what looked like a painful smile took over his face; the Alpha's eyes widen in disbelieve at his words, looking unconvinced. "Did you know? War does not make winners, only widows." A choked noise left the Alpha after hearing those words, and he stood up fast from his chair causing the chair to end up falling on the floor.
"Well… that's what I wanted to talk to you about." Tony said pulling Pepper to sit with him on the sofa; Pepper hummed happily and sat on the sofa, she then turns to Tony, happy that she was finally able to see the Omega, it had been over three months since she last saw him, the night they said goodbye to Rhodey before he went to basics. "I'm pregnant!" Tony said shyly making Pepper's jaw fell.
"Go inside; I will go distract them, go!" Steve hissed as he tried to push Tony inside the room, Tony who was too frozen to do anything but shake and shake as he heard footsteps getting closer and closer to the room; Steve cursed before looking at Tony pulling his face closer and gazing in Tony's eyes. "Hey Tony, are you my husband?" The silly question caused Tony to raise his head and gave a stupid 'Huh?' snapping out of his frozen state, which caused Steve to give a sad smile before pushing him in through the hidden door and closing it, leaving Tony dumbfounded in the dark room.
His baby was going to be one year old starting tomorrow. His beautiful Morgan was going to celebrate her birthday tomorrow! Just the thought made Tony's heart flutter in happiness. Tony can't help but imagine his and his baby's lives years from now, imagining his daughter on her first day of school, imagining her high school graduation, her going to college and graduating from it, he first day at work, meeting the love of her life, her wedding, and the children she is going to have… thinking about his baby's bright future left him breathless as tears of happiness clouded his eyes; the thought of his baby having a full and happy life is all Tony ever wanted
"Peter!" The pup said happily pointing at his small chest which made the Alpha let out a happy laugh and nuzzle the pup that giggled and start jumping in his lap.
Steve's voice vanished completely, and he had to try with all of his strength to stop the tears trapped behind his lashes from sliding down his face that was getting hotter and hotter by the second. It was one thing to be shouted at like this by his mate in front of his brother, it was another letting his mate and his brother witness his weakness. Steve could only take a deep breath and try to ignore the humiliation that made him hot, he had to stay strong, maybe he could drag Tony with him to their room, at least then whatever the Alpha wants to shout at him, he wouldn't feel this humiliating pain. "Can we please go to our room?" Steve asked, hating how small his voice was, hating that he was so close to crying in front of Tony and Bucky.
"What if he hates me?" Tony asked, shifting nervously in his place as he waited for Peter to return with Harley. The little pup had dashed to the clinic as soon as they arrived, leaving Steve and Tony alone as they waited for the little boy to return with his friend (Peter had refused for Steve and Tony to follow him, something about scaring Harley away if they found their secret hideout).
"I see," Peggy choked, and from the corner of his eye, he saw how she was clenching her fist tightly, which made Steven close his eyes. "We have a gala tonight, people from higher places want to meet you. That is why she was here…" Steven nodded at Peggy's words.
?' making Tony's heart melt at the cute sight. "Of course, sweetie," Tony smiled as he stood up, leading Harley toward the bed letting out his comforting scent as he saw Harley get more comfortable in the bed, before getting under the sheets with him.
"Ancient one, can you please grace us with your name in the hope of being able to help?" Thor bow after Bruce was done, his words made Steven hum, wondering if he really should give his name to someone who overreacts at the sight of him, but the thing was, son of Odin was his only way back home, so he needed to play nice for now.
"But… but… I found this in my car!" Steve started getting off Tony, ignoring the cum running down his thighs as he went to his jeans to pull the letter, giving it to his husband who was frowning as he took the letter from Steve's hand, ripping the envelope and taking the note to read and reread it; Tony's eyebrow raised at the words, looking up at Steve when he was done.
Whatever Tony wanted to say next was frozen in his throat when his eyes fell on the person that caught Pepper's sight and did he caught Tony's sight too? There was Steve, heading toward them wearing a light suit that brought the color of his eyes. "Hey, Tony, Pepper." Steve smiled nervously when he reached them, not that Tony manages to return his greeting he was shocked speechless to say anything.
It wasn't until they were sitting on a bench in the gardens that Tony finally dared to talk. "I love him…" Tony said in a small voice which made Steven sigh at that looking at the sky.
The sudden sound of breaking glass made Steve flinch harder than he expected to do, wondering if this was his imagination, Steve couldn't help but for his breath to pick up as he rushed to hide in the bathroom, trying to ignore how his heart nearly stopped when he heard a crash coming from far away. Steve had to bite his lower lips harshly when he heard another sound of breaking glass, his hand fetching his phone from his pocket as he called the first number that his eyes fell on.
Howard is 65. Jarvis and Peggy are 64 though Peggy looks 40 years old because of the serum. Maria is 62.
"Daddy…?" Peter's questioned, his eyes going to Tony, who came closer to the pair when he saw Steve hold their son tightly. Tony's breath hitched and his eyes became shiny with wetness when Peter called him by the word Tony probably dreamed about for a long time now.
"Oh, Tony… did you really believe that I didn't know about where have you been the past couple of years?" Howard mocked, a slow smile spreading over his face as he took a step toward Tony causing Tony to back away, making sure to keep Morgan hiding from Howard's sight. "Or about how your foolish mother helped you escape? Don't worry, I made sure to give her a reasonable punishment, after all, I do like her." Those words made Tony's breath hitch and for his eyes to widen, trying not to shake as he saw his father's smile widen even more. "I knew, son, I knew all along." Tony's heart skipped a beat at his father's admission, his breath was coming in fast gasps as he tried to think of a way to run away from this situation…
Steve always felt like he wanted to stab himself after that…
"… and then Ned nearly throw up in the bushes!" Peter babbled gaining a nod from Tony who was covering containers of food and putting them in the fridge as the excited birthday boy continued to talk about his say. "....Harley was so angry, Mama, he kept saying that he was waiting until the clock ticks twelve before he pulls my ear off for throwing the pie at his face." That gained a wince from Tony as he still remembered how Harley had screamed bloody murder as his face was cover in wiped cream from the pie.
So Tony, knowing that he was going to house a crazy Addams, did what every sane person will do… he decorated the room before Rogers did (With humans skeletons if Barnes was to be trusted) he made sure that the room was padded, in hope of the man not hurting himself (It wasn't because he knows that someone will end up trapped here and it wasn't even Rogers, nope!). He even made sure to write on the walls in dried red paint that looked like blood when it dried
Starkad, he couldn't help but laugh in delight when the boy was done, the boy was truly his mother's son, fearless, stubborn, and somewhere between stupid and courageous person, not only that he knew the old ways and how to insert his dominance even as a child, but he was fearless; Starkad had to admit, the queen raised someone who will one day become a great man, a true king, and a ruler. The boy narrow his eyes and growled at him before turning around with his head held high, a dagger in one hand and a man's dignity and freedom in the other as he walked toward one of the queen's followers, the mouthy woman who always followed the queen…
As much as Steve tried to tame the nervousness he was feeling he couldn't, his heat was a couple of weeks late, not something that Steve would have cared about that much considering that his heat was never on schedule, but this time the Omega felt different, and hope starts blooming in his heart. The blond tapped his foot as he waiting, excitement taking hold of him as he tried to stop himself from glancing at the lined sticks every five seconds, when his phone beeped, signaling for him that it was time, Steve rushed toward them and give a happy laugh at the positive sign he saw, happiness warming his body as he tried to stop himself from vibrating, and probably do something stupid like taking the car and driving toward SI where Tony was.
After that week of bonding, Steve, Tony, and Peter finally emerge from their home, not only, ignoring the teasing comments from their friends, but enjoying the fact that they were family now. It wasn't like they weren't considering themselves a family before… there was just something missing, something that they three finally found.
"I am really sorry sweetheart." Steve apologized once more before leaning down and kissing Tony's cheek, causing Tony to sigh and shake his head, but returned to fold the clothes, trying to stop his lips from twitching up when he saw Steve rush all around the room trying to find if he forgets something or not.
"Thanks, I'm going to go… I have an urgent job to do." Steve said nodding to Howard and Peggy and hurried up to leave, as soon as he closes the door, the shouting return making Steve close his eyes and grind his teeth as he heard that cursed melody again…
Tony hummed happily as he signed another paper before putting in in the complete stack, wondering if he can book it and live in his penthouse until the end of time; but that meant Steve searching for him and finding him and turning his lovely tower into the ugliest building out there. Tony won't have his employees running out of the tower because Steve decided that his tower was the best place to do a recap of the movie 'Mama' hell no!
"Are the Avengers in the living room?" Tony asked, already dreading the answer as he waited for Pepper to regain herself once again; it took a few seconds for Pepper to blink her eyes and snap out of her shaking, nodding her head as her eyes never left Tony, taking him in. Tony could only curse his bad, bad luck that decided to match-make with an Addams of all the people on this wide universe.
Thankfully his fall wasn't really that much of a falling, more of sliding down the edge with big boulders and heavy suit to accompany him, not the most comforting thing, but it beat falling a thousand meter and breaking his neck on the impact without his suit protecting him.
"Yes?" Tony asked when he heard the AI call his name, which made the AI pause if it was even possible and call his name again. "Yes? What do you want? uh, Ellen, right?" Tony asked as he raised his head to look at the ceiling.

"Son, please!" The sound was like his mother which made Thor shake and turn to the source of the sound that was behind him, the sight in front of him made him sway on his legs; his mother looked like a half-burned corpse at best, and Thor felt like he was about to pass out any minute now, when Thor's leg was pulled he let out a shriek as he looked down, only for his face to drain out of every color when he saw his brother's half-eaten face as blood trickled down his horror-struck expression
Peggy's words made the Omega pause, before putting his finger in his ear, pulling out a small white patch with a tiny device impeded in it which made everyone lean down to see the device better. "I made this, it mainly works to intercept certain voice waves, one of them being Alphas' growls and voice… I… I am really sorry Steve, for… for putting you in that tough situation, forcing you to use your voice, but I… I was scared, I wanted the device to work so much, that I ignored the consequences of how it affects us, I'm sorry…" Tony explained, his heart pounding inside of his chest waiting for what action Steve was going to take.
"What were you thinking?" He remembered Howard screaming when he was driving him toward his home weeks later. Tony didn't give a care that his father was screaming at him, he was just so tired he wanted to go to sleep. "Are you even listening to me?" Tony hummed at his father, not that much interested in what he was saying until his father hit breaks and Tony nearly hitting his head in the nearest window if he wasn't wearing his seatbelt.
"Trust me, Buck, nothing we purchase was too much, you need the clothes, autumn is coming, besides, nothing is too much." Steve gave Bucky a playful wink, turning to the coat rack, trying to find the perfect coat for the Alpha, the black coats was just too depressing and Bucky doesn't need any depressing colors right now, not even greys. Something caught Steve's eyes, making him turn fast to see what it was, only for a huge smile to take over his face, and he rushed toward the jacket he saw.
Sneakily, or as sneakily as the two babes thought they were, the two of them entered the workshops and tiptoed around the place, making Anton snort and shake his head before turning around, making the two boys squeak and gaze at him with wide eyes, looking like two dears who got caught by a hunter. "So… why did you think that entering my workshop is a good idea?" Anton asked, raising his brow as he gazed at the two boys, old enough to be edified as Alphas, but too young to have their first rut.
Knowing this, made the Avengers rush in their preparation they had been doing for the past three years, and with the help of the Ancient One and the Asgardian warriors, they were finally prepared to face Thanos. This time they were prepared, and they were able to finally defeat Thanos before he even collected the first infinity stone, but it came with a price, in the last battle between Steven and Thanos, Steven was wounded fatally that he falls into a coma.
Steve turns to the closed door near the window, he swallows as he saw Peggy and Angie were next, he turns his back to the family and walked toward the door, he opened it the door, getting inside the room and close it behind him. Steve looked at the pale and tiny figure sleeping on the bed and he sniffs at that, he walked toward the pup and took the seat near the bed, he took the pup's small hand in his and give a sad smile. It hurt him deeply that everyone had forgotten about the small pup, in the too big room, Steve squeezes the small hand, promising himself that he will protect the Pup and his Mother to the end.
Steve took a shuddered breath; the pain was visible in his eyes and on his face as he tried to fight whatever kind of poison running in his body, gazing at his mate like that, Tony never felt as helpless as he does now. "I…'now…" Steve said in a breathless and tired voice, the resigned undertone hidden in Steve's words made the tears run faster down Tony's face. "Ta…take c-care 'f Pete, 'k?" Tony let out a wounded whine at the words he heard, begging whoever heard his prayer that Steve will survive, that the love of his life will live. "Tony…" His name was followed by a hitch of breath, causing Tony to sob and nod his head, tightening his hold on Steve's delicate hand.
Is he staying because he felt guilty? That was a hard question, but even Steve knew that he will never stay with someone because of the guilt; it will end up leading to more heartbreak and pain in the future, and Steve loath to be the one to cause pain for the small pup and his mother. Then what? Regret is making him stay? Steve has lots of regrets in his life, from letting Bucky fell from the train to crashing the plane, to past regrets that will make people shake if they knew what he did, Steve refuses to make Tony and his small pup a regret, if he left them now, he will only regret it in the future but he will hate himself more and more because of that, and if he stayed with them he didn't know what is going to happen… but he knows that Tony needs someone right now, a friend, a stranger, a family, a mate, Steve could be all of those and none at the same time, but it will end up in a hopeful note in the future. "No, I am not doing this because of guilt or regret; I am doing this all on my own." Steve said looking at Jarvis, the older man must have seen something in his eyes, because he smiled happily and nod his head.
Nattalegg wonders if the reason for the king's decision was the small child, she has to admit that yes, the youngster reminds her a little bit of Petrus, he has the same blue eyes and hair, but he was pale… too pale to be healthy, just like his mother, and just like the rest of the servants, which informed her that all of them never step a foot outside of the palace, that they were imprisoned there with a no way out… she can understand why the king will soften a little when those teary blue eyes looked at him, especially when it had been a year since they have last been in the village… Petrus was supposed to be six by now, and she knows that the king's heart shrivels at the thought that he missed another important day of his son's life, maybe the youngster was the reason for the king's strangest decision.
"But don't worry! Tomorrow night we are going to have a picnic outside in the garden. I'm sure Peter will talk your ears off and force you to tell him the story of every star in the sky." Tony stated, holding his sigh of relief when he saw Steve shining once again after a small smile made it over Steve's face.
"Yes, we met years and years ago… do you know that the first time we met, Mr. Stark hit me with his car?" Steve's words got a gasp of disbelieve from Peter and a choked one of horror from Tony, considering that the Alpha never wanted his boy to know that he nearly killed the love of his life that day, he even had a fabricated story of how he met Peter's mother and fell in love with him, anything but this!
An hour later, Tony was sitting with Harley in their booth, Tony taking a sip from his coffee now and then as he watched Harley inhale all the food in front of him, even the three veggie sandwiches Tony ordered for the boy; Harley inhaled his food like he hadn't eaten anything for days and part of Tony was afraid that the boy was going to be sick if he continued to eat like this, but Tony didn't have the heart to stop Harley from enjoying himself. "It's yummy isn't it?" Tony asked, smiling when the boy raised his head from the waffle plate in front of him to nod and give him a truly happy smile before going back to eating.
"Died? What type of nonsense are you saying, Tony? Morgan is alive! You are holding her right now!" Bucky stated, his brows were furrowed in confusion; Tony doesn't know what he was going to do hearing these words, he wanted to laugh so hard at Bucky and how he was still trying to play Tony for a fool, but Tony knew that if he started laughing, he wouldn't stop until he was a sobbing mess on the floor.
It made Tony stumble, because the glowing did nothing but highlight Steve's natural beauty, causing Tony's breath to hitch in his chest and blush to take over his face. No, no, no, no, no, no! Tony was not going down that road, no! The last time he did, it ended up with him pregnant and alone, besides, Steve will end up back to wherever he was from, in the end, leaving Tony and Peter alone. Tony doesn't need an additional heartbreak to the heartbreak that Peter will have the day he realize that Steve will leave them and won't stay.
Time passed, and still, no one was getting out of the operation room, no doctor, no nurse, no Steve. Tony was left in the waiting room, with half of the Avengers with him; Natasha took the Hydra agent to S.H.I.E.L.D., the man may be dead, but he was still of use to them. Clint was sitting with Peter, guarding him in case of other Hydra agents showing up and deciding to do something, Tony was so grateful to Clint for keeping an eye on his son. Peggy and Bucky were sitting by his side, both of them lost in their thoughts just like how Tony was. The three of them couldn't help but feel the helplessness taking over their hearts every minute that passes without news.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, I guess you have a lot of explaining to do, future spangles…" That was Tony who was blinking so fast his eyes start tearing from refusing to close them until now, Steve starts massaging his forehead as he was attacked by questions left and right, the loudest was Thor who wanted to know how Steve knew about the Infinity Stones and Thanos…
"Are you Steven Rogers?" The man asked getting a nod from Steve who was trying to calm the fussy baby down. "Well, I am Abraham Erskine's lawyer, you can call me Phillips." The old man said as he offered his hand, making Steve look at him with a confused face but took his hand nonetheless.
The sound of a gunshot ringing in Tony's ears froze him in his place, and for a terrifying second, Tony couldn't help but think that Obadiah had shot him. Tony turned toward Obadiah, his body shaking and tense, but Tony couldn't help but feel relieved when he noticed that the gun was pointing at the ceiling, not him. "Now, now, Tony, I don't think I gave you the permission to leave did I?" Obadiah stated, pointing the gun toward Tony as he took step after step until he was in front of him; ignoring how Tony's terrified eyes followed the gun, and how he put his hands on his belly, trying to protect it. "Now you that are listening like you should come and sit, I have a lot to discuss with you." Obadiah stated with a sick smile on his face, causing Tony to swallow.
Once again the day ended with him waving goodbye to Natasha and Clint, as the two of them promised to come tomorrow and help him buy grocery and introduce him to people around the town considering that the teen hasn't met everyone in his three months stay, the town even being small has a lot of people. Tony yawn in tiredness, but the teen stretch and sat on the porch swing, his eyes gazing at the lake that changed colors when the sunset, he wasn't aware that he was nodding off until he couldn't open his eyes anymore.
Tell me your thoughts in the comments!
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness maybe, fluff, happiness, smut, Steve and Tony finally talk things through, Peter is adorable, and finally! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Tony didn't know how long he walked but when he heard footsteps behind him, he tensed and rushed to the first room in sight, going inside and closing the door, letting out a sigh when a few minutes later the footsteps continued with their way and went far away from the room he was hiding in, which made Tony's tense muscle relax a little; when Tony raised his head he let out a breath when he noticed that he was in Steven's recovery room, and it was strange not seeing Peggy around, for the past two weeks ever since the found Bucky and Steven; Steven seemed to have fallen into a coma, Peggy never left his side which, which was sweet as much; but in a way it made him jealous and angry because it seems his boyfriend had broken up with him without Tony being informed of the breaking up, and knowing Peggy she would have growled something like 'I told you so' which Tony didn't want to hear.
So Steve entered the room and closed the door behind him, after taking a big breath, taking the scent of engine oil, dust, metal, and something sweet… something that made his breath leave him, which made Steve turn around to take in the room, he had to thank the serum for his night vision, a thing that he never told anyone about in fear of him turning out to be a dancing monkey… again…
"No, but I saw your handy work." Steven said snidely. "So where are we going? The cells?" Steven asked which made Odin look at him with a sharp look on his face, causing Steven to smile savagely. "Am I going to find Loki's mouth sewn shut, to stop him from telling 'lies'?" That made Frigga inhale sharply and look at Steven with horror at his words.
Margaret stayed silent before she took a deep breath and gaze in his eyes. "They were executed, the king ordered them to be punished with something called… called… I think that James said it was the 'Blood Eagle'? I do not know what that meant, to be honest, but everyone ran inside their houses in fear after the king informed them of the punishment." Margaret said, causing Steven's eyes to widen and for a shiver of fear and disgust to run down his spine, and for a second he felt a little sympathy for those idiots who attacked him, for even Steven wouldn't wish that punishment on his worst enemy. "Five out of six were given that punishment, as for the last he had his hand cut by an ax, and was branded as an outlawed and kicked out of the village, James… he cut his hair, the king gave him the permission for it… I think? I do not know why everyone was shocked about the hair being cut." Margaret said which caused Steven's eyes to turn toward his baby with shock and pride, letting out a huff full of laughter when it finally sinks that those who hurt him were punished…
The boats traveled for four days without stopping, in that time Steven was still in the cellar with his friends, and it made him angry that no one had shown up since that redheaded Alpha, it was like they were all forgotten, but on the other hand, they were giving their meals daily twice a day, which was a miracle considering that they were held as slaves to be traded later for nasty owners who will treat them like they were the scum that walked on earth.
"Say, Steve… can I do something without you ripping my balls?" Tony asked just to be on the safe side, and his words got a confused noise from the Omega, but the man already raised and twisted himself, so that he was facing the Omega, before pulling the Omega into a kiss not wanting the courage to leave him and Tony shuddering to the core as he tasted those pink lips after all these years. When Tony pulled back he can see the shock on Steve's face, and he wondered if it was too fast, if he already destroyed whatever chance he had by making this rash decision.
"How our children grow up fast…" Tony mumbled, gaining a soft chuckle from Steve as the Alpha kissed his forehead, causing a purr to leave Tony's throat as he snuggle into his husband's chest, his muscles relaxed at the scent of his mate being close by.
Living with Harley was fun in a way, but so stressful at times; mainly because Harley looked like he was going to bolt if given a chance. Most if not all of the times Harley was full of nervous energy as he gazed around the place, like he was going to be eaten alive any second or that he was going to be punished. Steve and Tony both knew how hard it was on Harley, so the two of them tried to be as understanding as they can be when it comes to the little boy, they both put Harley's nervousness and jitteriness to the boy not having a good family and foster home before, so they tried to become as open-minded as they can.
"Mama! Papa is mean! He won't let me play with Harley, please talk to him." Peter whined rushing toward Tony and hugging his waist tightly, sending the older Omega the most heart breaking look a ten years old can manage. Now if only Tony was immune to those eyes… unfortunately or fortunately, that look was not working today, not when Tony's heart was scrapped raw after the shock he endured when he saw Harley.
"I see…" Steve's frown become deep before it smoothes over when they heard Peter walking toward them with a plate full of blueberry cupcakes and muffins, Tony could not help but do a double-take because he was sure he didn't buy that many cupcakes, or did he? "Is this for Harley, sweetie?" Steve asked, amusement coloring his tone as he took in Peter who was concentrating hard on walking to them with the plate in his hands.
"His grandson isn't." Fury said which made the woman turn her head sharply toward his with narrow eyes as she gazed at him with a shocked look hidden deeply behind a frown, which made the Alpha in front of her look at the files in his hands going through them.
Steve let out a few groans and noises as he tried to merge with the couch; which caused Tony's lips to twitch up, knowing that Steve was probably tired as hell and just wanted to sleep. "Don’t know…" Steve ended up slurring as he sat up, stifling his yawn and wiping his face with his hands trying to wake up. "Have to protect Peter, she wanted to hurt him in front of you; had to stop her… the stone's control broke then…" mumbled Steve between a few yawns before he let out a grunt, finally finding the position that was comfortable enough for him to fall asleep.
"Father is back from the hunt! You will not believe, My Queen, but father managed to slay a bear!" Petrus gushed about the king, going on and on how huge the bear was and how it would probably last the village for months. Steven's lips twitched up at the enthusiastic look on both his babe and the king's son; the smile though fell as he glimpses the dark frown mixed with shock on Nicolaus' face…
Steven should know by now not to jinxes himself more than fate already did, but as always, Mr. Steven 'I can do this all day!' Rogers, never back down from a fight or as his husband said, he was too stubborn for this world, and Steven should have listened to him then because look at him now, in a strange world where people can shift into wolves and men can get pregnant and he was told that this was the true universe he was from, but Steven the combative asshole he was, didn't give a fuck and decided to dive head-first into the fray like he always does…
Finishing the attic and the second story, Steven then had to make the morning meal, which the Omega made sure to burn to coal, which always made the Alpha scream and rage at him and Steven's excuse was always the same. "You order me to cook, but you never asked me if I know how to cook." He always says that while widening his eyes innocently as he looked at the man, which made the said man growl and stalk out of the house with his son going to eat somewhere else, same for the evening meal, which will give Steven a little bit of precious time to cook something for him and his babe, to eat without the burning coal he tried to sale to the king as food. Then he will end up stripping the clothes and head to the river in the forest to wash them and then hang them on the ropes in the back of the garden to dry up before sunset so he will return them inside the house.
And no! Thanos is going after them!
Two weeks passed too fast to Tony's liking but hey! Nothing ever was to his liking, so anyway Tony walked nervously to Sarah Rogers house, after all, he may have been there once or twice, but the thing is her son was coming in today, and anyway Tony was as awkward as they came, he was sure that by the end of the day he will scare the poor bastard away.
The boy was shuffling toward Tony with a sleepy face, calling his son 'Mama' as he held into him refusing to let go, which did nothing but make Tony give a happy laugh and ruffle the boy's hair; a boy with dark brown hair like Tony's, dark eyes, and pale skin. A child that resembled his deceased grandson and at the same time doesn't, a child that was the reason for his son to smile; a child that made the picture that Howard hide in his wallet for three years to burn and weigh him down.
Steve can see the pale face on the Asgardians, and if Steve concentrated he was sure that the person who stared at him in mute horror as he whispered his name was no one but Thor. The sound of something recharging behind him and the sound of repulsors firing throwing Nebula away from him informed Steve that just as he feared, Tony was stupid enough to follow him into the battlefield.
War. There was a war coming, a war against a mad titan who wanted Steve to be his bride; a war against a crazy person who will rip Steve's heart to live forever. There was a war that will destroy many lives, the war was coming and they need to prepare for it, not only to save the universe but to save Steve…
In and out, a calm breath, act like everything was OK, like you don't feel and that nothing concern you anymore, something Nebula was used to and continued to act as even as years passed. In and out, it was easy, the easiest task Nebula was required to perform, stay calm; try not to show any emotion until you are done with your task. A deep breath after a deep breath Nebula took, trying not to scrunch her nose at the foul stench she was subjected to.
"It doesn't matter who I am, Mr. Stark wish for you to read this letter and come with me." The man said which made Steve frown and snatch the letter from the man's hand; his face became dark as he read the name Howard Stark and he growled at the Alpha thrusting the letter in his chest.
He met Ho Yinsen the man was kind, made Tony a little guilty when he told him about their meeting in 1999, it was probably after Steve dumped him with the way Yinsen told him how he acts, the man patched him and Bucky good, one day the three of them were having dinner all three of them in silence until Bucky finally broke it by talking about his home, he talked about his family and his best friend Steve Rogers, hearing that name made Tony heart stutter in his chest.
"Brother Stark, why do you look like you saw the flames of Hel?" Thor was the first to ask him, for he was the first person to spot him, and God, wasn’t that question a funny one? Because Tony did saw Hell, a hell he hopes with all of his heart that it won’t happen.
From the corner of his eye, Tony saw Natasha as she came toward Tony with a hopeful look on her face, a hopeful look that turned sad and guilty when Tony leveled her with a dark glare that promised pain if she came any closer to him and his baby. When Natasha stopped in her advance, Tony managed to relax and turn around, planning on leaving this place and go through his planes, after all, he had a prey he was going to track.
"As you wish…" Steve murmured before leaning down, kissing Tony like his life depended on it, as for Tony he didn't even push Steve or pull away from him; after all, why would he do that when he already sold his soul to the devil in exchange for gaining the justice he always wanted but everyone refuses to give it to him. Suddenly it doesn't seem so bad being trapped with someone who would never hurt him…
"Dad…" Tony whispered, pressing his lips tightly before smiling softly and shaking his head. "We know…" Tony laughed, smiling at the shocked look crossing over his father's face, the
"I'm coming Ma! Jesus! Can't someone have a cold drink of water in peace?" Tony lean to the side to see the owner of the new voice as he walked out of the house with a scowl on his face, Tony blink a little in surprise as he saw a person who looked a little like George walk out of the house with a long sleeve shirt and a glove on his left hand.
"You are anything but helpless." Anton huffed, his words gaining him a genuine smile that went as fast as it came, which made the Alpha shuffle in his place, not knowing how to act in this awkward conversation. "What are you doing here? I thought that cold weathers like this are not that good for Omegas." At least that's what Braes told Anton, something about the cold messing up with heat-cycle or something, but the queen seemed to be enjoying the cold just fine, and by the look of it, the queen didn't even bring his fur coat with him or anything.
"He really did it…" The older Alpha said with a cruel smile on his face. "He really fooled you into believing that he was a Carbonell." The Alpha snorts as he took out a small card from his wallet and throws it at Steve making the Omega flounder to catch it, but it ends up falling in the end… "Read this boy." Steve glared at the man as he picked up the card from the floor, it was an ID.
"Why thank you, Pete! I'm sure that Jarvis is going to be very happy when he hears about that, he will even sneak you a cookie when I'm not looking." Tony winked at the pup, which made the boy puff his cheeks a little but a shy smile took over his face as he snuggled into his father's chest, waiting for the Alpha to open the backdoor.
"Yes, father." Nebula said, trying to stop a shiver from racking her body as the man sitting on the throne shifted, like he was ready to attack, that more than ever made her say the next world carefully. "The reports say that he is probably alive, only his physical body was abandoned, but his astral one is out there somewhere." Nebula nearly let out a loud sigh of relief when she saw her father relax in his seat at the words she uttered.
"I should have known…" Steven murmured, a soft smile taking over his lips, though his eyes became distant and sad, causing Tony to shift toward the star in concern. "You were always kind and forgiving… I wonder since when I start forgetting that…" Steven looked at his feet with a sad smile, causing Tony to shift in his place in discomfort this time.
"Brat, that's what you are…" Steve said as he starts tickling his son, which got him a squeal from the boy as giggles and laughter fell out of Peter's lips, Peter was desperately trying to get free from Steve's clutch that he wiggled like a fish out of water. "Think of it like this…" Steve stated after he let go of Peter, deciding to take a new approach to the matter, considering that his son thinks that it's within his right to marry Tony, something if the Omega heard about, no doubt he will find cute. "If I married Tony, making him my mate, and your Mama, he will belong to us." Steve explained, hoping that this approach will be better than the one before, if it doesn't work then that meant he will have to go to Tony for help, which the Omega won't let him live it down.
The footsteps coming down the stairs made Steven blink with annoyance, as he grumbled to himself glaring at the fucking dress he was forced into, his expression though, soften a little when his eyes fell on his babe sleeping happily in Steven's lap, being covered by a thin blanket, which caused the Omega to sigh and cover the boy before the blanket fall, thanking the Gods that it was the last month of summer which meant that the weather was still agreeable with them.
It was justified that he became curious; after all, this was the first time someone said
"No, doing that will only make them suspect and destroy all the evidence, not to forget B-the Winter Soldier, we have to rescue him if they realized that we know about him they will kill him…" Steven said being thankful that he caught himself before he slipped and said Bucky's name, which would have been a disaster, especially with the way Rogers was acting like a brat.
Tony pressed his lips tightly as he took in the baby that continued to squirm and whimper and make a nuisance out of itself; Tony couldn't help but wonder what kind of asshole would throw a baby away in the dumpster when the baby was no more than a month or so (Well that's the best estimate Tony can give, especially with how small the baby was) Rolling his eyes, Tony huffed, planning on leaving this alley and the baby with it; this was not his problem, Tony doesn't do babies, especially normal babies, even coming near them was a red line. The best thing Tony can give that thing was to call child protection after leaving the alley, the last act of goodwill before returning to his search for the trash that was Zemo.
"Oh, I thought the two of us can have a girls' night and bond! You are going to be my son-in-law after all!" Serpentine cooed happily floating down until she was near Tony's face, making the genius squeak and tried to back away from the crazy woman last she does something unwanted. God, why? Why him of all people in the entire world? Why? What did Tony do in his past life to deserve such a punishment?
Steve saw Howard walking toward him, as much as Steve wanted to apologize for invading his friend's privacy… no words left his mouth. When Howard reached him, Steve saw the heartbreak in the older man's eyes; it made Steve felt worse than he was feeling before. "My son...Tony…" Howard said, still eyeing the picture with a sad smile on his face…
"Don't make promises you can't keep, please don't… I got enough to last me a lifetime…" Steve whispered tiredly as he leaned on Tony's chest, taking a deep breath as he tried to calm himself down, eyes dropping tiredly as the Omega fought to stay awake, which made the Alpha croon as he rocked him trying to calm him down…
The sound of laughter coming from Steve made everyone jump and look at the Omega who was laughing loudly to the point of tears. "That's the funniest thing I have ever heard in years." Steve said after he regains his control looking at the Alpha with dark humor in his eyes. "This is the second time we met and you still practice that line on me, first with Anthony and now with my son? You really should find another hobby other than spending your money left and right, you know?" Steve said with mock sadness and disappointment which made Howard narrow his eyes at the Omega and putting his glass on the table. "Now after we get that out of the way, I hope for your own sanity that you didn't really believe that I will do anything you ask of me, in fact here is my answer, Fuck. Off!" Steve snarled like an angry beast, which caused Howard to wince at the loud scream, glaring at the victory he saw in the Omega's eyes. "Here how it's going to be, you staying the fuck away from me and my son because my son is many things but he is not a Stark, his father wasn't a Stark, and he will never be a Stark because Anthony Carbonell died eleven years ago and you are the one who pulled the trigger." That caused the room to fidget and look at Tony who was clenching his fists and looking at the ground, face twisted like he was in pain, Jarvis and Peggy shared a look at that looking at the Omega who stood straight and glared at Howard with no fear in his eyes. "Pray that we never cross any path again Stark, because the next time I see you, I will kill you with my bare hands." Steve said not paying Howard any attention as the Alpha stood and tried to intimidate him with his height. "Goodbye." Steve hissed as he turned away stalking toward the door wanting to go and leave this place.
"Edith?" Steve asked getting a laugh out of Tony, making the older man look at Steve with tired but amused eyes. "What does it meant?" Steve asked as he sat on the chair once more, taking Tony's hand in his.
"You listen here you foolish Omega!" The Alpha snarled as he pushed the Omega to the wall behind him, making the Omega growl at him and tries to break his hold, but the Alpha was too strong for that. "You get this in your empty head! I-" Whatever words the Alpha tried to get out got stuck in his throat when a faint scent reached his nose, making the Alpha still in his place, though it was only a second later that the Omega's eyes widen as he tried to thrash out of the Alpha's hold, but the man held the blond, and he thrust his face into the Omega's neck near his bonding glands, which made the Omega curse him and scream at him to let go, but the man didn't care about that as he chased the faint scent that he was sure he didn't imagine smelling, when the Alpha caught that scent once more, he let go of the Omega and backed away, his eyes widening as he took the Omega who was glaring at the Alpha with a wild look in his eyes. "You are with a child…" The Alpha breathed, not believing the words that left his mouth, already knowing that if he could scent the pregnancy on the Omega already it meant that the Omega was roughly two and a half months pregnant. "You are carrying his child and you dared to enter my house!" The Alpha growled as he took a step toward the Omega rage burning deep under his skin at the thought of the Omega carrying his enemy's child and living with the same house as him!
which they would have broken the uncomfortable silence, hell even his dad would have said something years and years ago and it would have doubtlessly been
Part of Tony was enraged, wondering how Betty nor Bruce told him about Harley running away from the place that was supposed to be a safe haven for kids and adults alike. "Hello, Harley, it has been a long time hasn't it?" Tony asked, smiling as he came toward the kid slowly, trying not to spook him in any way and cause him to run away. "How are you doing?" Tony asked as he lowered himself when he was near Harely, trying not to show how it made his heart hurt when the boy flinched and his eyes darted around trying to find an escape.
Steven, baby, you retained your glow… your heart; please be careful, he is after your heart…
"Yeah, well, I could have told you that to save your breath." Bucky replies dryly, trying to suppress his wince when Steve dapped the wound with alcohol. "Though I still don't know why he would throw a stone at me if he wanted to go undetected, something doesn't add up…" Bucky stated which Tony seemed to wave away.
. The only reason that Steve fell in love with Tony was him always looking up to the future.
Tony Stark will blush like a schoolgirl." A voice drawl behind him, causing the hair on the back of Tony's neck to stand on its end; Tony bite the inside of his cheek hard as he turned around, glaring at the person behind him which turned out to be Ty.
"What the… who are you?" Stane called out, making Tony turn his head to the direction Stane was looking in, hoping that it was someone from the town who will help him; raising his head, Tony could only see the outline of a man, it was a second before it disappeared, causing Tony's breath to get stalled in his chest.
Tony could only let out a relieved sigh as he went to Peter's room, he could only thank his husband mentally for being considerate and not let him in the face of loose cannon in the form of their ten years old son. It took a little of tricky moving to climb the stairs with Harley in his arms, the small boy grunt and wipe his face in Tony's neck as if he was about to wake up; Tony ended up rocking Harley a few time, shushing him softly as the two finally reached Peter's room. Tony considered it a win that they didn't fall and break any body part, especially with Tony's mind being in another place than the present.
"This!" Steven hissed as he showed them the necklace that was still attached tightly to him, refusing to move an inch, an action that made the blood inside of him boil, he wanted to be far away from that stone as possible. "I was returning to my body, hoping to fall asleep for at least a century before that thing, came out of nowhere and knock me out of space, now the question is for you son of Odin, why the fuck is that thing on the loose when it should be locked up like how your father was tasked to do?" Steven narrows his eyes when the man stuttered his answer, something about Chitauri, Tesseract, and Thanos' children, which shouldn't be that much surprising that Thanos was behind all of this.
