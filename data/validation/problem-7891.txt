“For science!” Clint called.
Tony narrowed his eyes like a gunslinger, hovering his hand over the pocket where he kept his phone. “You think you can dial faster than me, punk?”
Tony smiled weakly and looked down at their piled hands. “Steve, I never learned how to deal with them. I mean, I know how to minimize the fallout. I know how to do the dance. But the actual… the way it felt, the way it feels, when they find something and dig their claws in. I don’t deal with it. I mean when I came out, and they ripped me up, I didn’t deal with that, I didn’t learn from it, I just escaped into myself. That’s kinda what I do.
“Or I could play an actual phone game… but you already said it makes me seem… conceited?”
“Fair. But wouldn’t you feel better if you told me now and I came back anyway?”
And Steve hung up, smiling like an idiot and fist bumping the air. He fucking got a date with Tony Stark! He could actual do this!
Tony nodded and carefully gripped his tongue between his teeth. He had an awful habit of immediately trying to make suggestions and offer solutions where he had no business being. Instead he let what Steve was saying sink in. Illness in general didn’t bother him too much, and he had to acknowledge that he found Steve’s litany of ailments intimidating not because of any barrier it might present, but because it made him think that Steve was clearly kind of a low-key badass for getting as far as he had in life.
Steve raised an eyebrow, but let it go. Now wasn’t the time to bring up how strangely informed Clint was with the subject. Steve could do this. He could make a good first impression. At least he didn’t have the money to buy a multi-million dollar painting and send it to Tony.
“Oh but I couldn’t.”
Tony nodded and pushed up onto his extended arm to let Steve rest on his back a little and cranes his head around for a sidewards kiss. “I’ll give you anything you want, sexy. You know I Latrec on the first date.”
Clint and Bucky kissing on the couch.
“The number doesn’t bother me. I guess I’m just worried I won’t be as good as them. I mean, we’re not to that point yet, but I’m not even that experienced to begin with. I don’t want him to be disappointed.”
Tony grinned at the bedspread too-proudly. “I already made a scatter plot.”
“Very sharp. Everyone at the Gala won’t know what to do with how handsome you look.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “And what’s that?”
“Thanks.”
right to the pit of his stomach and planted it where it could grow. He looked in Steve’s eyes and saw something unbreakable, something safe that couldn’t be touched by the imperfections of life. Something too good for the world. Something Steve was giving him freely, anyway. He squeezed Steve’s hands.
Tony parked near Stark Hall on the campus and walked across the quad to Bruce’s office. He’d thought about going with a toned-down outfit and car, but he figured he owed it to Bruce to mine-sweep any press on the way out. But when he got to Bruce’s office, he heard a bellowed “GET OUT” and two reporters fled in fear, not even noticing Tony.
“We should probably leave the binder on,” He murmured. “if we’re gonna get back before people notice.”
Steve chuckled and snuggled carefully into Tony’s side, making sure to avoid any painful areas. He couldn’t help but notice how calm Tony was being despite what he had been through. After dating him for months, Steve had come to associate this kind of behavior with hiding how Tony felt.
“I should introduce them to Natasha. Blow their damn minds.”
Tony cleared his throat, trying not to stare. He wasn’t prepared for the charming little way the edges of Steve’s mouth moved when he talked. Not in conjunction with the full brunt of that voice, unmediated by the tinniness of cell phones. Fortunately his years as a (highly neurotic) international businessman had taught him a lot of tools for breaking up interpersonal stage-fright.
Bucky laughed out loud. “The fuck you don’t, man. It’s like you roll out of bed every morning right off the set of the Andy Griffith show.”
Steve chuckled. “I was thinking of calling you though, so you’ve kind of ruined my chance.”
Steve took a few minutes to really look at the different packers. He eventually decided on a decently sized one that wouldn’t look like he was hung, but still a decent size, probably five inches.
“But so does the takeout you’ve brought. I can just wrap up my steak and save it for tomorrow.”
“Exactly like that.”
“You act like it didn’t happen, and the media might love that you’re human. Jennifer Lawrence fell at the Oscars, but everyone was okay with it.”
“So no risk of an episode?”
Steve gets ready for the gala, and interrogates Clint like a good best friend does.
“Depends on what it is.” Steve said as he kneaded Tony’s ass cheeks.
“I guess if we’re just swaying we don’t have to get all butch about who leads.” Tony joked.
Steve could feel Tony clench around him, and his own orgasm was just out of reach. So he quickly sat up, wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, and started thrusting up into him with reckless abandon. It was as if his orgasm was taunting him by not finally happening.
Steve cleared up plates as Sam wiped his mouth and sat back in his chair. “I’ll admit, between the sit-down lunch and how much your cooking seems to improve when you’re bored, I’m pretty on-board for this house-arrest thing.”
Tony bit his lip and grinned. He loved to feel Steve looking at him. He balanced up on his knees and stretched, then settled down slow with a shift in his hips until Steve was fully sheathed in him again.
Steve smiled. “It was nice. No one knew where we were, so there weren’t any reporters. I know it sounds crazy, but whenever Tony had time to come see me, it almost felt like
“I’m only teasing. I can see those little worry lines digging themselves in your forehead. I expect things will calm down soon.”
Steve took out the bottle and put it on the bedside table. “I like the idea of us going at it for hours.” Steve gently ran a finger over the bit of lube dripping out of Tony. “That I came in you so much you were dripping.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony took two minutes in the bathroom to conceal most of the drama, and got his clothes on. He checked down the hall, but no one was looking, and the party was still chattering away breezily just out of sight. He padded down to Steve’s room, grabbed a fresh pair of shorts for him, and returned, dum-dum-da-dumming the Mission Impossible theme song under his breath the whole way.
Steve would never be able to get over the sight of Tony sucking his prosthetic cock. It was like something out of a dream, something he never thought he could have. But he was a bit impatient, so he gently held Tony’s jaw open, and slid just the head of his cock inside. He groaned at the sensation of saliva, tongue, and lips around it, and barely held himself back from thrusting in between Tony’s lips.
Tony smiled. “You look fantastic. Don’t take the pants off yet, though. Might need a little adjusting. C’mere.” He pulled a long, broad, flat box out of his bag and set it on an empty cutting table.
But it was definitely him, sandy sharp-jawed head bent over a sketchbook in the corner.
“I should probably remember to bring dessert tomorrow.” He cleared his throat. “I should probably be getting back soon. They watch my building, and if I’m out too late they’ll get more aggressive about following me.”
Steve placed a peck on Tony’s lips, just to tease him a bit. “But really you can thank Jarvis. He showed me some projections of the Reactor and it really helped.”
“Don’t worry. These ladies are the best. They fitted me for every outlandish thing I’ve done since 2003. They’ll love you. Honestly I feel like I’m taking you to meet my parents, but with less louring and judgement.”
Tony sighed. “Sending security would just look weird. Tell him I’ll do my best to be super interesting today. I’ll hang out by the window with the blinds up, I’ll have half an intriguing cell phone conversation where they might be able to read my lips. That should keep them busy, give campus security a chance to catch up.”
“I think I can handle that. Are you free tomorrow? I’ll send a car.”
“Okay..?”
“Okay, so smile at the cameras, let Tony answer the questions, don’t play phone games, and don’t get drunk. Got it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony slid his hand down Steve’s back to rest suggestively low. “So what’s your friend bond telling you right now? Is Barnes doing ok? Enjoying his gig? Wouldn’t notice if maybe we wander down the hall for a few minutes?”
Thank you for finishing this story. This may sound egotistical, but if you have any fanart or anything like that, tag me on Instagram or Twitter.
“The wedding. I get to go waaaaaay too big.”
Right there in his hands was one of the paintings Steve had seen in his art appreciation book. It was Toulouse-Lautrec’s painting of two androgynous figures kissing on a bed, signed and in its post-impressionistic glory. Steve had to set it down because his hands were so shaky and he didn’t want to drop it. He didn’t even know what this painting
Two days had gone by since the phone call, and Steve hadn’t heard a word from Tony. True, it felt like Tony was nervous when they talked, but Steve didn’t think he came off as anything other than nice. Sure, he didn’t exactly like everything he said, except he was nervous! He walked behind the garage as usual and saw Clint on the phone, probably talking to Natasha. But before Steve could go up the stairs, Clint stopped him.
“And I’ve been worrying about you. Have there been any vultures stalking the place?”
Steve let go and looked back at the packers. “I won’t ask how much these cost, but this is really thoughtful of you. I didn’t think you’d do something like this… I guess I should have expected it after the painting.”
Tony nodded, nuzzling against the smooth hard presence at his cheek. “God, I’m halfway there already. But yeah, I’m gonna make it real easy for you to get me moaning your name, baby.”
So much of his life had played out in some corner of the public eye that it felt strange to tell Steve and experience a sensation like he was revealing himself. So much of his own story was something other people said about him, but standing there with Steve, just the two of them, and saying it out loud, felt like a new kind of exposure, easy and clear.
can handle it. I promise.”
Steve rested his arms on the table. “I was just… thinking… about my past relationships.”
“Something like that. The entertainment press aren’t like fans, though. It’s more of a dance. They know that it’s good for them if they can stretch the story out a little. So if you let them know they’ll be on the inside for big developments, they’re less likely to try to harass the golden goose to death. It helps that I’ve been a pretty cooperative staple of their weekend sections for a while. There’s still the paparazzi to worry about. They’re just out to get anything they can, ecology of entertainment news be damned. But I think it’s gonna be ok.”
“Yeah. It’s complicated.”
Clint shook his head, feigning victimization. “I can’t believe the man I love more than life itself lives with such a homophobe.”
Steve pounded back in, and Tony’s skin made an audible slap at the movement. He didn’t waste anymore time, he started a hard and fast rhythm and had to hold onto Tony’s shoulder so he wouldn’t fall. It was still embarrassing how easily this could get him off, but even with the strap on, he could come multiple times. And the sounds Tony was making were fucking incredible.
Steve had managed to wash the packer and put away the harness before Tony showed up. He also got the little velvet box he hid out of a secret spot in Tony’s room. Jarvis promised not to say anything, so Tony had no idea what was in it. As soon as Tony handed him the boxers and he was dressed, he asked,
“The audio released means that my privacy was violated and what ought to be a personal matter is suddenly not. But yeah.” Tony gave a deliberately ambiguous answer since he knew they were going to spin it however they wanted anyway.
“See, there’s that obstinate bravery I’ve heard so much about!” Tony teased.
“At least it wasn’t some asshole paparazzi photographers.”
“What time is it?”
Steve blushed like a madman. “I’m planning on using this tux again, I don’t want to ruin it.”
“The price of the car Bucky’s working on?”
“No.”
“I hear you. Ok.” Tony took another little step towards him and leaned a little to one side, cocking his head speculatively like he was thinking of giving Steve a kiss on the cheek and waiting for a cue as to whether it was all right.
“I promise.” And Steve shoved all the way in one thrust.
“I’m not a shut-in.” Steve complained as he sat down at the table again. “I have friends I hang out with. You’re sitting here, aren’t you?”
“Oh good. I’d kinda been given the opposite impression. Look, I’m sorry about the painting. I won’t bother you anymore.”
“A likely excuse. I bet next you’re gonna tell me that some of your best friends are gay.”
“Okay, first, let’s not call me Mr. Rogers. It sounds too much like that kid’s show guy. You can call me Steve.”
Steve.
“Wait… Natasha’s been seeing someone? And didn’t tell me?”
Tony grinned. “The second time was far more literal. I got caught in a closet. At a party. With press.”
Tony nodded. “And yet I’m sufficiently intimidated. Still, someone should warn him that if there’s ever a kick-my-ass conga line, he better not try to line-jump Natasha.”
“How do I look?”

Steve had read every book he’d brought, watched the small amount of DVDs Tony had in the house, and sketched to his heart’s content. Thor said he’d go to his instructors to get his notes and assignments for the next week, which left him in the house alone. Well, maybe not entirely alone. And he still couldn’t stop wondering who this Stane guy was and why he was blocked access from Jarvis. Tony didn’t seem to like him either if that morning was anything to go by.
“Can we not talk about it?”
Tony shook his head. “See, that’s something I don’t get about you normal people. Why would you ever not spice anything up? It’s not like we eat plain mashed potatoes most of the time and only have tacos once we get dangerously bored.”
Tony raised a hand in reply. He gestured at the counter with his thumb, then pointed at Steve in question. He repeated the gesture a couple times
“I’ll call you tonight. Thanks again.”
“As I’ll ever be.”
“We’ll get a separate place. That way you can
He sat back on the couch and thought about it. It was weird talking to an AI about his problems, especially Tony’s AI. But he didn’t exactly have anyone else to talk to at the moment. He just hoped Jarvis didn’t send everything to Tony.
The NYC Stark Industries building had a private executive garage under the building, with an entrance that came out half a block away. But for first-round media blitz, Tony figured it was important to give them something, and Natasha agreed. Especially with Bruce’s voice and personal information attached to the story. It seemed smart to try to shift the focus to some other incident.
“Wow, going full Barbara Walters on the first date. I can respect that.” He cleared his throat. “So just so I got this straight, you’re asking me to justify my sex life to you? Bold choice.”
“Get out of my office before you make up more excuses that I’ll debunk. Just ask, and you’ll have your answer. Anxiety is really not good for your heart rate.”
Tony stopped dithering long enough for his deeper anxieties to rise to the surface. “Yeah, I hear you. I guess I just feel like… I mean I feel like I already know him so well. And I know that no matter how I frame it he’s gonna say fuck the world and suit up with me in the best tuxes money can buy, and he’s not ever gonna blame me for what happens next. And I feel like, knowing that as clearly as I do, all I’m really doing is passing the buck if I ask him. I’m asking him to sign off on probably the worst decision of his life just so I can claim later that it’s not my fault, that he made a choice. When you and I both know, he won’t be making a choice.”
“Ah damn,” He said with a lopsided smile. “That smells amazing.”
Clint got up, messing with his phone, and mussed Bucky’s hair as he passed him on the way to the kitchen. “There’s a lasagna in the fridge,” He grinned impishly back at the couch. “It’s made with loooove.”
Steve spit out his beer in shock and started coughing. “Jesus, Clint. Realize, Tony will want to take pictures of that if he finds out. In the name of research and liability.”
“So did Barnes lose that arm to try to keep up with you or something?”
“Um… I don’t think it does if it was just a media stunt?”
“Nah, nothing like that. I called Dr. Patil, and she was happy to start me on the anxiety meds again just in case. I’ve got those in the cupboard, but there’s been no trouble yet.”
He stood up and offered Steve a hand to lead him back to the party.
Eventually, the tuxedo was pinned in the right places and Steve changed out of it. He also deliberately got on his phone so he didn’t have a heart attack over the price of the tux. His commission work did decent enough so he could pay his half of the bills and rent, but he usually didn’t have much to spend on himself.
“Unlike Clint, I’m not keen on explaining our sex life to people.” He tightened his grip around Tony a bit. “I like keeping it to ourselves, so that it’s ours.”
“Ok, then how does Natasha feel about you having eyes for someone else but dating her?”
Steve smiled through tears and gently wrapped his arms around his boyfriend. “I’m so glad you’re okay.”
“Ok, well, media handler playbook says to wait a couple weeks then attend something publicly with Steve. Control the narrative, you know? And my mom’s annual gala falls at just the right time to catch the social and entertainment news cycle on a slow week. It seems kinda perfect, but I was dancing with Steve last night and now I don’t know.”
“Bah. Probably be an improvement. Anyway Nat’s on my side.” He put down his phone. “So ask.”
“How about you? I mean, how was it when you came out?” Tony asked.
“Shield.”
, and Bucky got the first ever Stark Prosthetic arm that worked almost like it had grown there.
“So I guess I’ll see you tomorrow.”
with… okay, maybe the ripped black skinny jeans could work. So resolutely, he put them on the bed.
Tony let his spine sway like a charmed snake and moaned a gentle encouragement as Steve indulged in touching him as he moved. Once he had his balance and his rhythm and Steve seemed settled in to enjoy, he let his own hand stroke down his cock. He was so twanging-hard he just wanted to tease himself with light touches that meandered down to behind his balls. He loved to feel how Steve stretched him, how being filled and fucked helped to press his prostate down into a subtle swell that he could feel through his skin.
“You behave yourself with this nice gentleman.” Lucinda called back.
Bucky shot Clint a look. “So you’re just in a permanent mood now? This is just the helpfulness setting you’re stuck on?”
Tony nodded. “It’s getting better. Pepper’s doing a bang-up job quietly reminding people how ghoulish and low-brow this sort of thing is. It doesn’t stop people talking, but it makes them talk quieter. But even when this wave has passed, we still gotta figure out how to handle coming out. As a couple I mean.” He crossed and sat, rubbing the back of his neck. “If that’s what you think you want.”
“I guess… I’ll wait for him to call or something. I don’t want to make him think he can keep sending me stuff like this.”
want to go after the guys in your past, but I won’t go all pro-bono on you.”
“I must be desperate if I’m thinking you’re right.” Steve admitted.
Tony’s throat felt too tight to respond. He pressed his lips together and tried to keep his eyes from overflowing. He cleared his throat.
“Of course not. He wouldn’t let me have actual people over if that was his plan.”
“So how was it?”
“To say I’m confused is an understatement.” Steve said as he took his bags to his bed.
“I’m a gentleman, so I’ll
Tony folded his arms and mulled the thought over without finding a conversational handle, so he just said. “Wow.”
Steve’s eyes widened at the amount of food Tony sat on the table. “I can definitely see why you decided on a painting now. And I’ll take the second choice.”
“Clean up and go commando. It’s a party!”
. How the hell was he going to make a good impression on
Steve did not want his ass to be the main focus of this fitting, as it was awkward already being talked about by Tony. He looked to Tony with a pleading expression before being escorted to the back.
Steve took a step forward and hugged Tony like he did earlier, which was safer. He realized he really liked hugging Tony. It felt familiar but alien at the same time.
“Shit… my spare boxers are down the hall.”
Steve looked to Natasha for confirmation, and she shrugged in agreement. Steve sat at his drafting desk and let his head lull back as he spun around in the chair.
“Hey babe.”
Tony has a habit of going over the top with his actions. Steve doesn't exactly take it well.
“Yeah, but I love process.”
Steve blushed. “No! Why the hell would you ask that?”
Sam made a face. “I mean he’s not trying to win you over with Stockholm syndrome, I hope.”
“Well sure I did. I’m not an ogre. I mean ‘all those people’ is a pretty big category, and sometimes we would just meet at a party and maybe catch breakfast the next morning but… I mean, I never went to bed with anyone who wanted more than a good time from me, if that’s what you mean. I don’t wine and dine gullible young college students with big promises and flashy gifts and then break their hearts. I go to bed with people that like to go to bed without worrying about a lot of social calculus.”
“Tony wants me to go to a gala he’s holding this month.” He said as he started eating.
Steve opened the box, and inside was an adamantium ring (courtesy of Xavier). He took it out of the box, and slipped it onto Tony’s left finger.
“This is the real thing, Buck. I don’t know how, but it just
“I got some time to talk. Just got some people nearby.”
Bucky had a thought. “Maybe you could have a code word. With Tony. Like you gave me back when I was just out of the hospital. Something to let him know if you’re in trouble and can’t think.”
Tony nodded, concerned but not worried. They did usually have a little bit of a conversation after trying anything a little bit new, just to clear the air and give each other notes in an open way. He settled himself on the bed and took a deep breath to open his ears and put down his defensive impulses. Maybe Steve had meant something else when he’d asked Tony to talk him over the edge. It had just slipped out, but he figured if that’s what it was he could try to stay more porn and less valentine in the future. Anything for Steve.
“And he’s got muscle to make up for for the lack of caring.”
All too soon, Steve’s thrusts faltered and he groaned loudly as he came in his boxers. He stayed inside of Tony though, he knew it would only be a minute or two before he could go again, and actually get Tony off.
“No one looks for a college professor in five hundred dollar sunglasses. That’s just science.”
“Nat’s been sending me updates on everything. Apparently she’s already had to turn away five reporters that got passes from entering your office. She said they’d lied saying they wanted to interview you about the BMW-Stark engine, but she could tell what it really was.”
“Will anyone recognize you?”
Steve actually smiled at that. That was probably the problem he had with the guy he did have sex with: he cared about them, but they didn’t care as much about him. And it’s probably why he didn’t actually want his vagina either. It was just sex for that ex, not really a connection.
Tony got up and went to the kitchen to rummage for plates. “Thanks J!”
“And now you are gaslighting to the extreme. Why don’t you just make the first move and call Steve?”
“I can’t be gaslighting you. They’re my feelings. You’re the one trying to… trying to… anyway why does everything have to be about Steve? Just because you know him that doesn’t make everything your business all of a sudden.”
Tony gave a final put-upon sigh. “Yes, doctor.”
Lucinda shook his hand. “Lucinda Carmicle.” She looked back at Tony. “Very much a gentleman, I can see why you like him.”
At the other end of the line, Bucky closed his office door and sat down behind his desk. “I hear you, buddy. Ok. So, I try not to big-brother you too much, because god knows you’ve saved my life more often than you’ve ever needed saving. But here’s my big brother and occasional himbo advice for you about this. You ready?”
“Considering I stepped on my prom date’s toes five times, it’s safe to say I’m terrible at it.”
He called over. “Hey Luce, any chance we could still make those pants tear-away?”
“Yeah, they left a complementary one. Who does that?”
“Hello, Ms. Barnes,” Tony called from under a half-finished mark six mechanical assist arm that was turning out as more of an art piece. “What brings you to my cave of wonders?”
Tony nodded. “It’s like you read my mind.”
Steve laughed but shifted Tony off of him fully. As he guessed, there was a large wet spot between his legs, and in his underwear.
Tony nodded, flipping through slowly and trying not to exclaim over every page. “So what’s after school? Like what’s your dream?”
Tony shifted to hold all his weight on one arm and brought the other hand back to rest on the small of his back. It was shaking visibly. “I’m not nervous. I do trust you. I just feel better if I have something to hold onto. Makes it easier to relax. So go as hard as you want, I can take it, but help me hold my hand still.”
Steve got the feeling that he was being watched, and when he looked up, he was, by Tony. They locked eyes, and didn’t say or do anything for a moment. Steve couldn’t believe they even made it this far… and how the hell did a guy like him get to be Soulmates with someone as good looking as that? He was in a hoodie with an ACDC logo, jeans, and looked incredibly nervous. Steve didn’t know what to do, so he awkwardly waved at Tony.
“Yeah but it wasn’t ‘just’ anything. I did love her. I do love her. Why is that somehow less-than because we’re not having sex forever? How do I decide which of my encounters count on the constructed rubric of ‘real’ if that’s not?”
“I want to know because… I want to see what I’m up against, I guess?”
“And you were afraid when you first found out Steve was your Romantic Soulmate. What does that tell you?”
“This one.”
Tony laughed. “Well yeah, that’s the tradition, right? One week anniversary is post-impressionist art treasures, two month anniversary is latex genitals.”
Lucinda looked over and smiled at Steve. “Is this the boyfriend we’ve been hearing so much about?”
This time Steve kicked Clint in the shin hard.
Tony looked worried. “Yeah, I did. I hope that’s ok. I mean, if you don’t like any of them-”
“I’m plenty hot already, but I’ll take you up on it.”
“... only four?”

“Depends on what that even is, because it sounds ridiculous.”
“Um… I… guess…?” Steve awkwardly got up, and felt uncomfortable but also excited at the same time. Gently, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s torso and swore he was as red as a tomato as he did it. And he actually felt safe when Tony wrapped his arms around his shoulders. And wow did he smell nice.
Clint sighed wistfully. “That’s awesome. So did you…?”
Tony studied the ceiling and did his best not to think about how much he definitely wanted to.
Tony chuckled. “More than that. Probably a lot more. There’s about fifty other rich assholes that have that same car right now, or have it on order. I’m the only guy in the world that gets to sit in this chair. At this table. With you. So stop acting like there’s a price tag for that, ok?”
“God, yes, please…”
A blush creeped onto Steve’s cheeks and he looked down at his shoes. He wasn’t used to being complimented like this. It was… nice.
“I’m not uncomfortable being around you because of it… I guess I’m just… wondering if I’ll be another notch in the bedpost. Because that’s happened a few times and it never ended well.”
Steve was at the coffee shop he was supposed to meet Tony at. It honestly made him feel a bit sad that their coffee date never happened, but he would survive. Like he thought before, Tony Stark had nothing to lose if things went South with him-.
Sam stretched. “Only three more days before you can go back to being a shut-in at Bucky’s place instead of here.”
and think that they’re just a means to an end?”
Steve suddenly laughed, a memory came to mind. “Serves that asshole my senior year right. He said I’d never find a husband, just a hooker on a street corner.”
Steve blinked with a pause. “What makes you think I want that?”
Tony gave a small fluttering laugh. “Well that was underwhelming after so much build-up. Was it good for you?”
Steve has a bit of a panic attack because now Tony knows.
Tony whispered in Steve’s ear, “Ignore her. All software deveoloped from Jarvis has a no-murder protocol. So Bucky at least can’t murder you southpaw.”
He took the top off the box to reveal a surprisingly tasteful display of six different high-quality packers, all in Steve’s skin-tone. Steve gasped, speechless. No one had ever done this for him before, he usually had to buy them himself. And he had no idea there was a store that sold this in New York City.
They danced until the song ended, and said goodbye with a long kiss at the door. Once Steve was in bed, he called Natasha needing a bit of support. He always became a bit depressed when he talked about his mom, but he just hoped that she was looking down on him and proud of him.
After about two minutes, Jarvis called Bucky, and it ringed three times before he picked up.
“So’s everything.” Tony grinned impishly. He turned to Steve and leaned in a little, either to offer him a kiss or let himself be pushed away.
Tony nodded approvingly. “Yes, yes you have. If you think you’ll be ok, I had one other errand to run while we’re in town. Can I leave you two to get acquainted without me foisting my lurid input in every ten seconds?”
“I’m getting out of here before I influence more damage.” Steve said as he got up from his seat.
Tony wasn’t showing any restraint at all, eager to show Steve just how fucking bad he wanted him, and to show off his hard-won fellatio skills and well-suppressed gag reflex. He yearned forward, sliding his lips as far along Steve’s shaft as Steve’s gentle grip on him would let him, longing to socket his sweet sensitive prosthesis between his tonsils and squeeze him against his soft palate with his tongue.
“Hey, man, you said you could handle the pressure. This is practically training-wheels day. Be strong!” Tony called to Steve’s vanishing back.
Steve chuckled. “Well, I think Patrick is scared shitless to approach me on a subway platform again.”
Tony smiled sheepishly. “Yeah I… I guess that would seem like a big deal. I forget how much of this nonsense is just background radiation to me. Can I - Would you let me say that I’m sorry for all this again or is that just gauche at this point?”
Steve noticed Tony staring at him with a goofy grin. “What?”
Tony nodded, “What a weird thought. I like it.”
Fuck her.
Steve chuckled. “I guess one year is a-.” He stopped himself before he could finish his statement, not sure mentioning a strap on was appropriate.
Steve shuddered a bit, as usual mind-blown by how realistic it felt. “He’d just applaud us because he’s an asshole.” He lead Tony’s hand onto Steve’s prosthetic cock and started thrusting into it.
“Well, if he was trying to make an impression, I’d say he succeeded.”
“Why?” Clint didn’t bother to stop ogling his own boyfriend as he leaned over to pull out a spark conduit.
“Creepy is different from bad. Your friend Wade, for example.”
Steve breathily chuckled, then shifted them so that Tony was sitting on him with his back to Steve. “Then give me a show.”
“Hello?”
“What did you just send?” Steve was getting more worried by the minute.
“Anything else, Ms. Barnes?”
“The fact that you’ve barely left the workshop in three days.”
Steve blushed and Lucinda laughed. “Let the professional see what’s best. I’ve surprised you before with my selections, haven’t I?”
Tony nodded. “Oh well. Good thing I’m ok with being a visionary. See you tomorrow.”
Tony groaned appreciatively as Steve shook and slowed. He squeezed his wrist again. “Do you want me to finish? I don’t mind if you’d rather get back. I know parties make you nervous.”
Tony nodded slowly. “Yeah, that guy’s on the bingo card of shitty gay dudes. What else ya got?”
Steve laughed hard enough that he had to hold onto his stomach with his free hand. What the fuck was Tony building at his company in his free time?
“Nice tushie.”
“The best gift you could give me is another scandal so they stop harassing me.” Bruce said as he sat down and opened the box. Inside, there was a very expensive baseball cap with a physics equation on it, and some Louis Vuitton sunglasses. “You want me to keep a low profile by wearing expensive camouflage?”
“I love you, oh fuck, I love you. I’ve never wanted anything else, never knew anything like the way you fuck me.” His voice tightened and his brain blurred and all he could do was echo himself over and over. “fuck me, fuck me, fuck me…”
badly.”
Steve sighed, unable to think of something to talk about. “So…”
They hung up, and Steve actually felt a bit better about himself, and the situation. He was seriously thankful that no photographers had shown up to the garage. Bucky hadn’t had an episode in almost two years, and he didn’t need that streak broken by some asshole with a camera.
“I had something quick before I came, but I could eat.”
Bucky gaped at the painting resting on the floor against his breakfast island/home office. He wasn’t as big into art as Steve was, but like any Brooklyn public school kid, he’d gone on his fair share of field trips to all the conveniently local art galleries. He knew that an original by any artist with a name he recognized was probably worth more than the entire block. He shook his head, numb with shock.
“Because he felt like you were trying to buy him out instead of actually getting to know him. That’s what he said when he saw the painting. And I’m tired of both of you not getting your heads out of your asses. You’re adults, do the adult thing and actually talk to one another.” Natasha said with a raised voice.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yeah that’s a little obnoxious, but come on. I’ll bet you like to have updates. You wanna know that your friend is ok.”
Tony smiled. “And don’t you forget it.”
Steve blushed. “Seriously? But this is your launch party.”
“Sure. You wanna ask me something wildly inappropriate instead?”
“Oh, oh fuck me,” Tony murmured through clenched teeth. “Oh god…”
Tony smiled but didn’t answer, continuing to flip through. “So you keep mentioning ‘issues’. You mind if I ask? Your feet flat or something? I mean, if it’s none of my business, I get it.”
Tony laughed and gulped. He had to swallow about six emotions all at once. Steve had such an engaging way of talking, and Tony always had a hard time not interrupting whenever he had a thought. But he’d been reading up on “active listening” because he wanted to be a better friend, and a better person, since meeting Steve. He smiled and coughed once.
“Talk to me.” Steve moaned. “So close…”
“Just look me in the eye and say you know that you don’t understand. And I’ll trust you that we can handle it anyway.”
“But the flashbulbs will give me a headache.” Steve complained.
Tony smiled and gave her a hug, and received a graceful air-kiss to each cheek. “Lucinda, my lovely, I have a real treat for you.”
Steve cringed at the memories that came along with Bucky’s arm. All of those months trying different antidepressants, going from therapist to therapist, nightmares of gunfire and smoke. It was hard to get through, but Steve stayed by Bucky’s side through all of it. Bucky getting over his PTSD was so much harder than getting used to using one arm.
“Well considering what the big connection between us is, I feel like I should know.”
Steve choked on his lasagna. “Okay, you can stop at any time.”
Tony strolled into Ferrara’s, hands in the pockets of his hoodie. He’d agonized about how far down to dress to keep from attracting attention, and the last-second check of his low-key casual look in the shop window wasn’t leaving him any surer of his choices. But at least it was objectively comfortable.
Tony nodded. “I hear you. I hear you. So, yeah, just, sorry for the whole mix-up. It’s not you it’s me, yatta yatta yatta, I get it.”
“It’ll be our way of coming out officially. We already had a long talk about dealing with the media and I told him I can handle it, which I can. He wants to buy me a tux and give me dancing lessons, and it honestly feels… kinda nice.”
“Because I’ll come in three minutes if we spice it up at this point. You can record your own data, just minus the lab coat.”
Tony nodded and let his head pitch back towards Steve’s shoulder. He felt like his voice was coming right up his center from the taut electrical well that was churning right below his navel, and he breathed words into Steve’s ear in a rapture,
(See the end of the chapter for
He knew he was being too flip, but he’d spent his whole post-pubescent life being analized in the press for his life choices, and he was well-beyond over it. Or at least he had been. The fact that Steve’s question made him want to take a serious accounting of his intentions was upsetting, but also kind of refreshing. Like an intriguing new problem or… something way more serious than that, even. It felt like giving a shit. And he didn’t hate it.
Steve’s orgasm hit him like a freight train and he had to bite Tony’s shoulder so he wouldn’t shout. He knew he was gushing into his underwear and onto the sheets, but fuck, Tony wrung the best orgasms out of him. He breathed heavily when he stopped, just barely staving off an asthma attack, and simply held Tony to him.
, let alone what Tony went through to get it.
“Or play spot the ninja Nat if you get bored.” Bucky grabbed an apple off the table and took a bite.

“They tailor for celebrities. They’ve seen everything. It’s the one upside of moving from small-town stigma to limelight stigma. You’re never going to be the wildest thing anyone’s ever seen.”
“Just not adding onto my name like that would be great.”
And in celebration of the first set of prosthetics being launched, there was a launch party at Tony’s apartment for friends and family.
“Why h-haven’t you started already?”
painting, probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and here it was in his crappy studio apartment. They hadn’t even met yet, why would Tony spend this kind of money on him?
“Roleplay, maybe. Don’t think we need to spice it up yet, though.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile. “As long as it’s light swaying, I think I can manage.”
Tony nodded. “There should be plenty of clean towels. I can get the dishes done while you do that, if you don’t mind me staying.”
Bucky had been standing frozen, mouth open, hand held out to the side and open, ready to voice an intelligible thought the moment one occurred to him. But all higher brain functions seemed to have gotten stuck like a lingering sneeze. He dropped his hand helplessly.
“My mom had been diagnosed with cancer when I was 16. Stage 3 lymphoma in her brain. I had been planning on waiting until I was 18 to tell her, but they didn’t give her that long if the tumors didn’t shrink. So when we got home one day, two months after her diagnosis, I sat her down in the living room and told her the truth. She thought I was being selfish at first for telling a sick woman about it, but I said that it was because she was sick that I told her. She didn’t really focus on me coming out as much as her own health… and a year later she was gone.”
“Well, I know how it looks-”
This actually made Steve laughed. Why the hell were they being so childish? Steve was usually way more mature than this.
They walked a few blocks to the subway station and down the stairs to the tunnel. They kept up an easy conversation until they reached the ticket section.
“Then… it’s better if you ask Steve what he thinks. He should get to decide what he wants public and if he’s okay with attending the Gala, since it means he probably won’t have privacy again.”
Steve groaned, and couldn’t help but grab Tony’s cheeks in his hands and spread them to get a better view of where they were connected. Tony started to move at a steady rhythm, and it still felt so good. Steve let his fingers stray to where his cock was sliding into Tony, and pressed lightly at his boyfriend’s rim. He had a sudden need to get a finger in there too, but now wasn’t the time.
A voice from the counter yelled. “Toby!”
Steve sighed. “Since he liked the car sketches before, I think it’s only fair that he sees my other work.”
“Um… that’s…” He put his phone on mute for a second, took a deep breath, and unmuted it. “Then… let’s do a proper meeting. Where we get coffee or something and talk face to face.”
“I know I don’t understand it, and I can handle it.
“What happened the second time?”
“Well, I’ll definitely be around longer than that.”
“They’re just rough drafts, not the final product.”
“He’s being ok about it, right? There’s nothing gothic-horror going on when he’s here?”
“But usually people like when I bring my sketches, they always ask to look at them.”
Eventually, Steve got out of the shower and put on some clean pajamas, or rather he had cleaned some clothes earlier that day. Jarvis had to help him figure out the touchscreen washer and dryer set. He went back downstairs and saw Tony sitting on the couch on his phone. Steve would have expected him to be frowning if he was on social media, but he was smiling dreamily. It was almost adorable. So Steve went over to the couch and sat next to him.
Steve held on tighter. “One more song?”
“It’s the truth. You may seem like an asshole on the outside, but you actually care so much and so deeply about people that Stane couldn’t even hope to match it. How could anyone with a heart look at a
Somehow, Steve felt there was more to that, but he didn’t press it. He nodded and continued loading his plate with curry.
“Can’t wait. You really got his good side.”
“Can we worry about that later? Pretty sure we were having a moment.”
Bucky leaned on the counter and tried to come up with some advice that didn’t involve hitting things, as that had already been shouted down twice by his stupid, stubborn friends.
Clint smirked. “Oh it’s like that, is it?”
“Well, you made Natasha, a human froot loop, and I’m assuming Charles Xavier listen to you and work together. That’s not nothing.”
“Definitely a bit more ballsy with their questions.”
Tony smiled and dug into his dinner.
“Well, we didn’t. I told him I wasn’t ready for that, and he respected it… but there was a lot of kissing.”
Tony was already sliding himself down off the edge of the bed. “I just like begging I guess,” he whispered, and started babbling unprompted as he knelt at Steve’s feet. “Please baby, please let me suck your hot cock.”
“The first guy I dated was named Doug. I thought he’d be okay because he had trans family members, but he couldn’t get past the fact that I still had…” He simply gestured to his chest. “He wanted me to wear a binder all the time when we were together, and if we did anything sexual, it’d always be me doing things for him, he never reciprocated. I was still new to dating so I didn’t know any better, and then we actually got far enough to actually have sex… but he absolutely refused to do anything other than…” Steve blushed. “Anal. I couldn’t wear my binder during it because it would set my asthma off, and he left me a week later.”

Tony didn’t free his mouth up to reply, but nodded shortly with an affirmative moan. Steve roughly tugged on Tony’s hair to move him off and directed Tony to get on the bed on all fours. Tony obeyed, flushed and eager. He got down on his knees and elbows, and glanced back.
“That the other shoe is due to drop any day now? Ugh, I’m sorry, man, I’m not trying to be difficult but this is serious Scylla and Charybdis time.”
Bruce sighed and forced a smile. “Thank you. It’s really thoughtful.”
“Well… I do know one thing that would make me happy.” He said with a smirk. “And it’s the reason I wore Buster instead of my usual tonight.”
Tony knocked on the door and held up his bag of indian take-out like a proud puppy. His face fell when Steve opened the door and the smell of steak wafted out.
Tony melted into the motion and relished the sense that Steve was going to do whatever he wanted. He reached down between them and ran his fingers lightly over the head of Steve’s prosthesis.
Tony settled in next to Steve and purred. “Oh yeah, talk data analysis to me, baby. Let’s get non-parametric.”
Clint shrugged. “I dunno man. You hate shopping. You’re frequently broke. It’s a complete mystery.”
“You didn’t do anything wrong. All you did was… start a different direction than what that guy liked. People need some of the inventions you’ve come up with. I’m pretty sure Bucky is even thinking about taking you up on your offer for an arm.”
Tony chuckled ruefully. “The guy with broken glass and reporter urine all over his floor thinks I’m being a catastrophist. Great.”
“I bet you can lead. I bet you’d be great at it.” Tony rested his forehead against Steve’s and smiled. “I mean, really, how many ‘strikes’ do you give yourself when you fail before you decide that you can’t do it?”
“Hmm.” Sam didn’t seem too convinced, but he let it go.
“What are you two plotting?”
“Considering I just accidentally had Clint send you a cropped nude, I’m a bit disgusted.”
“I don’t want you to stop talking to me.” Steve urged. “You didn’t mess up
Steve put his fingers in his ears. “I’m not listening!”
“Please.”
Thankfully, Lucinda and Pepina didn’t put Steve in tails (he never really liked them anyway). It was a simple black tux with a black bowtie. And where it was pinned actually fit unlike when he went shopping on a regular day. He turned around in the full length mirror and admired his reflection, and Lucinda looked approvingly.
A grateful smile pushed Tony’s bruised cheeks back and made them ache. “Yeah. But I feel like I didn’t always. So thanks for that.”
Bucky chuckled, having gone all the way through shocked and angry and back around to punchy.
A little woman with silver hair and crinkled eyes came quietly from the back room, answering in some tripping language Steve didn’t immediately recognize. She looked at Steve and nodded, glancing at Tony and offering a string of approving-sounding words. Tony laughed. She looked back at Steve and by way of explanation said in a thick eastern european accent,
“Tony… in all seriousness… it’s kind of a big thing, and… I’ll tell you when I’m ready, okay?”
Bucky rolled his eyes. “Yes. Because you haven’t reminded us in three whole minutes. Look, if you don’t wanna look like a guy who’s obsessed with how you look, stop obsessing about how you look. It’s not hard.”
Steve smiled at the praise. “Thanks. I was thinking of the final sketch being on a graphite wash so the light and shadows are more apparent.”
The conversations they had over dinner flowed easily between them. Tony discussed the tactics he used to keep focus on himself, Steve talked about how the physics he had to do he could barely understand. Before they knew it, the containers were almost empty, and their dinners were finished. And as Steve went upstairs to the shower, he felt weirdly nervous. He was showering in Tony’s home (well, a property) and… it made him think that maybe certain things were moving a bit fast. But he also couldn’t blame Tony for putting him in this position.
Steve sat down on the floor and stared at it in silence for the longest time. This was an
“To the untrained observer, yes,” He retorted. “But actually my recent exercise into trying to express myself through visual art reminded me how long it’s been since I just kinda cut loose and got playful. Do a little engineering-for-engineering’s sake, you know? It’s healthy.” To punctuate his point he grabbed his green juice smoothie and took a long, pointed sip, his eyes locked defiantly on Natasha the entire time.
Clint grinned. “Yeah, Bucky does it all the time.”
“I’ll take some dark chocolate gelato, if that’s okay.” Steve said as he sat down.
“Like the equivalent of a teenage girl crying over a date not calling her back.”
“Why didn’t you just say something to Bucky about being his Soulmate?”
“There’s an engraving inside.” Steve said as he sat next to Tony. “It says
“What do you think it means?” Steve asked.
did, it’s what… this other guy did. There’s this kinda creepy guy who catcalls me, but he never actually makes a move, and most of the time what he says lacks the things you would typically expect in catcalling. Patrick was drunk and approached me while I was waiting for the train, and the creepy guy ended up scaring him enough that he peed himself on the way up to street level. He said his name’s Wade Wilson… and he seemed actually like a nice guy.”
“Well, no pressure,” He turned and pressed a kiss onto Steve’s temple. “I just can’t stay tonight. I thought it might be a nice way to hold you, for a little while, without making you worry. But we can just sit here. And you can trust me.”
Tony shrugged. “Well, I was kind of a small kid. And a multi-billion dollar company is a heck of an end.”
, food is not entering our sex life.”
“I think that went ok.” Tony commented.
“It wasn’t even your fault. And you’re trying to fix it anyway, so it’s starting to be okay.”
Clint nodded. “You’re probably better off not trying to figure out Bucky’s advice. He’s kinda stupid lately. Your sketches are good. You should take ‘em.”
“So I know you’re gonna worry anyway, because you’re an idiot and it’s basically your hobby, but my advice is don’t worry about it. Just like the guy. Let him like you. Even if the sex isn’t awesome at first, it’ll get there. And there’ll be no comparing you to anyone he’s been with before.”
“Call Steve Rogers. Send it to my phone.”
“Which Barnes?”
“Tony, so good to see you.”
Steve shrugged. “I don’t hate who I was before. I was always me, but different expectations were put on me. I still like the things I did before I transitioned, so it doesn’t really matter.”
“Considering an AI Tony invented himself is running the house I’m at, I think I’m doing okay.”
Clint grinned. “Oh did you think you’re seeing the first test run of the arm? You’re adorable.” Clint gave Steve a wink and lifted up his shirt at the hip to show four perfectly formed light-blue finger marks. “I’m thinking of getting those as a tattoo.”
Tony gathered up the dishes and containers and sorted them into the sink or the recycling. It felt kind of silly. Like kids playing house. He’d never actually lived in a suburban home like that. He hadn’t wanted for anything, but his parents’ secure luxury apartment hadn’t had a backyard or a porch. It was his house, but it wasn’t his usual habitat. He expected if he tried to live like this every day, driving out from the city to some little nest where his… somebody was waiting for him, the novelty would wear off fast. Probably. For a fantasy it was pretty nice though, the sound of Steve upstairs moving around, the way he could hear the plumbing when the shower was on, like it was all a living thing. It was nice. He took a few moments just to commit it to memory, knowing it wouldn’t last once things were safe for Steve again. Or safer, anyway.
“Are you okay? Emotionally?”
in the Met, not here.”
Steve hugged Tony as tightly as he could. “It’s more than okay. I love them.”
Steve couldn’t help but notice how carefully everyone seemed not to be noticing them as they crossed the floor to the half-car display. Tony leaned over and whispered something to Bucky, who nodded and cleared out without looking at Steve.
“Nah, you get nervous when your contacts get dry.” Bucky opined. “Sketchbook might look too much like business at this point.”
Tony decided this was the time to finally turn his company around. Once everything was put together, Tony worked around the clock to shut down the weapons branches, and open up new branches for SI. He made sure to give everyone employed the option to move to the new branches via training and transfers, and paid those who didn’t fairly. Tony’s first idea was
“So what do I do if I end up looking like an idiot?” Steve asked.
“Roger that.”
Steve chuckled, and did have one question in particular. “Why did you sleep with all of those people? What exactly was the goal with that?”
Sam nodded and held out a hand. “Yeah, good to see you again. Nice place.”
“I’m not claiming to have been cool like that where Bucky’s been concerned, I’m just saying Natasha is. We both have seen other people, and we root for each other about it, you know?”
Tony leaned back on the edge of the cutting table and watched his two fairy godmothers pluck and fuss with his gorgeous guy. They had Steve turn, and Tony caught his breath as he caught the contour of Steve’s ass in dress pants. He grinned to himself and pulled his hand down over his mouth, muttering, “We are gonna break the internet.”
Steve held onto Tony’s hand, and with his other, lined himself up with Tony’s hole. “You tell me if I go too roughly.”
Bucky sighed. “Calm down, mama bear, I think he knows how it works.”
“It’s my boss dating my little brother, how do you expect me to act?”
With Bruce off the table, at least in the mainstream, Tony went ahead and braved the front door gauntlet. Let the tabloids take their bite.
ride into him like he was owned.
For the occasion, he’d cleared a large section of the living room floor and had a pristine version of the front end of a SI roadster assembled and open for display. Bucky had agreed to take charge of taking off pieces and explaining the features for all the guests. He knew he was also showing off the lifelike capabilities and precision movements of his new arm, and he didn’t exactly love being in front of people, but Tony had made sure to keep the environment calm and cordial, and Bucky had to admit that being able to talk about his specialty made it easier to be in a crowd. The fact that Tony had cut him a fat consulting check didn’t hurt, either.
“I don’t know how Bucky’s put up with you for so long.”
“How does 2 sound?”
“What do you mean?”
He bit his lip. “Probably better if I show you. Come on.”
let me pay for, and some dance practice.” He grinned and slowly pulled his phone out of his pocket.
Clint hopped off the dresser. “That’s kinda how these things go. Confused, to excited, to desperate, and then pretty much right back to confused. I don’t know why anyone puts up with it.” He seemed a little too serious for his smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And what’s that?”
“Yeah, which is why I came to talk to you.”
“So is this why you’ve been so negative about Tony being my Soulmate?”
Steve almost didn’t want to let go, but he knew if he didn’t he’d be getting weird looks. So reluctantly, he unwrapped his arms from Tony and asked, “Do you want to sit down? I haven’t ordered yet.”
“Um…” Steve said.
“My ego, my work, my gleeful persona of self-abuse, I just get away from it, and I don’t let myself have anything that they can hurt me with. But now there’s you. And I… it’s completely selfish why I can’t bear the thought of them getting to you. It just,” He shook his head and put a hand on Steve’s cheek. “I don’t know if I’m strong enough. To let you do this.”
Steve nodded, and looked at the enormous crowd. “I usually don’t go to places like this. Way out of my price range.” And he realized his second statement. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that. And I’m not expecting you to just pay for everything, I’ll pay for what I can.”
Bucky was grateful when Steve handed him the crowbar without objection. It usually meant Steve was in a reasonably good mood when he didn’t feel the need to insist he could perform feats of strength that really weren’t his forte.
“So you have a choice of caffeinated or non-caffeinated sugar-milk…”
“Are you planning on showing this Steve person at the Mariah Stark Gala?”
“Longer than the story’s likely to last, let’s put it that way.”
“I won’t. Promise. I won’t go after the people in your past if you don’t go after the people in mine. I will, of course, be a good boyfriend, and if we ever move in together I’ll give you equal access to all the resources I have in case
“Ok.” Steve tried to phrase this carefully. “I know you sometimes have casual sex, so how do you usually react when someone says they have lots of previous partners?”
Pepina said something, and then didn’t bother to translate at all.
Tony shrugged, “Take your pick.”
Clint looked back and forth between them as Bucky smoothed back his hair and blushed. He sighed.
“Sounds like somebody needs a sabbatical.” He leaned one hip on Bruce’s desk and put down the box he’d brought with him. “Thought you should get a little swag since your life’s been turned into a red carpet walk.”
“Jeez, man. Operative word there being ‘person’. Come on. No, I’m not planning on ‘showing’ any people like some kind of pet.”
“Best not to risk pictures of me and you if things are that crazy.” Steve said as he went to the couch.
Bucky tried not to pay too much attention to how angry he felt, and his lack of a strictly rational reason. It definitely seemed to want to walk and quack like a kind of jealousy. Steve was his best friend. And this rich guy thought that he could just… he didn’t even know what. In his place. Over his shop. Like he could just walk in and leave his great big mark wherever he wanted. He paced the apartment, trying to calm down.
Steve just gave him a look. “This is a best friend interrogation, so I ask the questions.”
“Sam!” Steve exclaimed.
“I guess we should talk about why things didn’t work out before if we want this to last.” Steve took a deep breath. “I didn’t start dating until I was 24, and by that time I passed well enough to be comfortable dating anyone. I had heard about cis gay guys still dating trans men, so I decided to try that.
