“You could say that,” Steve replied with a smirk.
“I didn’t wrap Steve’s gifts. I got him a book my mom read to me even though it wasn’t for children. And I got him a nice sketchbook. It’s nothing special but… I didn’t know what else to get him and I was hoping I’d still have time to get something nicer after our dinner.” Again he could feel the tears stinging in his eyes. Only this time it was even more difficult to hold them back.
For that one Tony had to sit up. He did so slowly, holding onto Steve’s shoulders.
Steve wanted to be his only one which meant that they had all the time in the world. Or as long as they had until something major happened again. That thought came out of nowhere and scared Tony more than he expected.
sound and Clint beamed proudly. “Dmitri taught him that. Here, he likes to be scratched behind his ears.”
“Alright, gentlemen, let’s talk. I’ve got Commissioner Carter on the line,” he told them as they went inside, Bucky closing the door behind him.
“Well,” he began and he felt nervous. It made him falter and come to a halt briefly. Why was he nervous?
It had been a little over a month that they had all stayed in the Rogers’ home and today was the day Clint and James were going back to their own home. Clint missed the privacy and the familiarity still. He liked being near Tony and he enjoyed Steve’s company as well as Benni and Sarah who had somehow managed to just adopt everyone, even Natalia, but he longed for their own home and all the places in it that brought back memories of falling in love with James.
“Not nearly as recently as I would’ve liked but I’ll let it slide this time.”
Tony listened, his head turned to Clint and he nodded. “How long has it been since you two started out?”
“What changed?”
“It does,” Steve agreed, reassuringly. “So, what’s the verdict?” He looked at Tony, waiting.
He sat up, running his hands through his hair and taking deep breaths, trying to keep them quiet so he wouldn’t wake Tony if he was asleep.
nice.
Dugan sighed. He had fragments of ideas that could answer that but in the end he didn’t have the whole picture. Few people rarely knew what was going on in Steve’s mind. “Unfortunately, lad, I don’t know everything. If you want answers from Steve Rogers, you have to
“Alright,” Tony mumbled, his eyes closed again. He didn’t even get to answer Steve’s question or say anything else before he was being picked up. “I didn’t mean to worry you,” he told Steve, his voice low and sleepy. “Sometimes the bed is too soft and I can’t sleep.”
Clint felt his heart skip a beat. He had spent the night wondering that himself. Doubting it the longer he thought about it. He wasn’t sure and he didn’t want to give Tony false hope or, at this point, himself either.
“And he never told you
. Make her a leader,” Cap said, a hand on his back.
“Excuse you, sir,” he snorted and pulled him in for a soft kiss. With the blanket around his shoulders and his hand in Steve’s, they headed to the front door to welcome their guests. That thought alone gave Tony butterflies.
asked.”
Clint stirred and woke up a few minutes later. When Tony asked him if he was okay he gave him his usual grin and thumbs up. It was then that Tony realized Clint was just as scared as he was but was unwilling to admit it.
“Will you play me something on the piano?”
Benni nodded, his smile even brighter. “
Steve came over and extended a hand and Clint took it, giving it a shake.
“You said you had news?” James asked drinking the vintage scotch Steve had brought with him to James’ home.
“Hello,
Their deck was first to be let off of the ship. There was someone carrying their bags behind them while another steward led them off the ship and to a car that was already waiting for them. The driver got out of the car, opened the trunk and then the back door. Steve got in, tipping his hat. Tony got in by himself, not knowing if he should wait for the man to hold the door open for him as well.
And then he stood in front of his home. The home Steve had given him. Everything he had was because of Steve. And everything he felt—and now was also very painfully aware of—came from Steve too. How was he supposed to look at him?
If Steve could have bottled the feeling that was Tony reaching out to touch his face or recorded the sound that he made when Steve stopped kissing him, he would and he would have both on constant repeat when he was away from Tony. His mother was right, this was different from how he had loved James.
Steve eyed Tony, quiet again, and then Dugan. He made a gesture and Dugan held out his hand for the money and Tony obeyed. Dugan counted it out and said, “Ten dollars.” Steve reached out and swapped it for another roll in a different pocket and gave it to Tony.
“I’m not sad.” Clint opened his mouth to protest but James continued. “I just don’t want to lose you again. Not ever. Not for a day, or an hour, or even a few minutes.”
The closer he got to his office, the worse and more prominent that ominous feeling became and the more grateful he was for Tony’s libido. At least he had something good to focus on to keep his mood from plummeting completely.
Clint smiled. “No, it’s okay. Go make some more money to spoil me with. I want diamond-encrusted underwear and a solid gold leash for Lucky. Also Tony said I should adopt more dogs.” Lucky, who was curled up in his own bed in the corner of the room, perked up at the mention of his name.
“Maybe,” he said, knocking back his vodka shot and as soon as the glass touched the counter it was being refilled. When Cap’s Jameson got low, it too was refilled without asking. “Maybe not.”
Tony closed his eyes, forcing himself to slow his breathing down before answering. “Quiet?” he asked, his breath still hitching. “It’s too much,” he whispered.
Tony blew air out of his nose, a small laugh, shaking his head. “This happens to everyone? Breaking down from being hugged?”
Tony sat down on the couch, unable to stand up anymore. Being able to let himself heal without new injuries was a new life to him.
Steve was still holding him in his arms and seemed to be fast asleep. Tony moved a hand to rest right above Steve’s heart feeling the
“It’s your house and your rules. It doesn’t bother me if others drink. Not a fan of drinking for myself,” he stated simply. He also didn’t like what the drinking had done to Howard. Though that had to do with his poor character not the alcohol.
Benni thought harder. “Fractions.”
Tony held him the whole time while Steve tried and failed to fight back tears. And he would continue to hold him for as long as Steve needed. Even after his sobs subsided and he was more or less able to breathe normally again, Tony held Steve close to him. Even when he heard soft snoring he continued to hold him to make sure he was really out. And only when he was truly convinced that Steve was fast asleep, he got up slowly to call a nurse. Somehow he wasn’t all too surprised to find James in front of the room. He had probably never left in the first place. Without saying a word to him he stopped the nearest nurse and told her that Steve had torn stitches and she went to look immediately.
James led him downstairs and wrapped him up in blankets. Dmitri had already started a fire in the fireplace and the room was the perfect cozy temperature. James made Clint a mug of hot chocolate and, also changed into more comfortable clothing, curled up with him, pulling Clint against him again. James spoke, just talking about his day so far, leaving out details here and there because he had picked up Clint’s newly engraved watch this morning.
“How about this then? We
Dmitri went over and James lifted the watches up for him to inspect.
“No, you’re welcome to stay,” he said, heading over to his desk and calling James. When the call connected, he heard the furious way James said his name and confirmed his suspicions. James
“I know we didn’t hug but thanking me is just you being ridiculous,” he told him, turning to the car that was waiting for Steve. Steve had lied to Tony. He told him he was coming home tomorrow and he had Dugan and Sarah keep him busy for the morning while Jones slipped out to pick him up.
The first man smiled and said something and then both of them were grabbing Clint. He resisted at first, planting his feet firmly and tugging back but two against one was really not working in his favor.
“I’m so sick of this place,” Clint complained on his second to last day, his face turned into James’ side who had crawled into the bed beside him.
me but I didn’t… I didn’t expect more. That’s nice to know.” He smiled to himself. He did love that kid.
James had cut his meeting with Loki short the moment the phone rang and he realized it was Phil. Phil Coulson had absolutely zero reason to call James’ personal office phone and even less motivation to do so, so James knew it had to have been Clint-related and it had to have been serious if Clint wasn’t the one making the call.
“Of course. If it were the other way around I don’t doubt you’d do the same, Steve.” Steve nodded and James watched the anger bubbling up in him, heard the audible sound of his knuckles cracking as he balled them into fists at the thought of what Howard might’ve done to Tony. James put a hand on his shoulder. “Whatever you do, don’t kill him.”
Steve’s grip on the glass tightened when Tony spoke and he sighed inwardly, trying to keep his face as reassuring and comforting for Tony as possible, not worried.
“You have always been terrible at poker,” James sassed only to receive a stern look and an impatient sigh from Steve that he easily ignored. “Well, fix your face or you’ll have them both worried. If Tony noticed, you can bet your ass Clint did too. That’s his thing.”
“So, you ready to do this?”
“And?”
“Wholeheartedly.”
“You’re sure I can leave you here?” Tony asked, wringing his hands again.
Even to Tony Sarah looked shaken and pale. Tony snuck out but the two men asked him if he needed anything and if they should bring them food or something else.
“I know I shouldn’t be listening but I just wanted to say that I also think it’s very sweet,” Maria said from where she was standing by a painting on James’ wall. She knew she recognized it and was trying to figure out what famous painter it was without asking.
“Hey, Benni, you have a good day at school today? Learn anything cool?”
“Yeah,” Clint said, happy and fully from the delicious breakfast James had made. “Did you call?”
He wasn’t quite ready to go on, to talk about the day they were moved, the day when he thought maybe James would be on the other side of that door and wasn’t and he definitely wasn’t ready to talk about the days that followed—the starvation, the freezing, not knowing if he could really trust Tony at first, or the beatings. Not yet.
He picked up the Rolex next. It was heavier, sturdy, and solid gold. It was showier, more easily recognizable.
He sighed, watching Clint watch the stars, and then pressed a kiss to the side of his head. Clint smiled softly, a sadness to it that James couldn’t ignore.
“Does underwear count?”
“Sarah is…
to kill me
Now it was Clint and Clint never let James forget that he needed love and sickly sweet affection and comfort.
“I’m thinking,” James began, moving forward to point out what he meant, “that these two are incredibly close to one another and that perhaps we can kill two birds with one stone.”
He helped Clint to his room and Clint pushed the door open to reveal James in bed, arms folded behind his head as he stared up at the ceiling. He lifted himself slightly and gave Clint a smile, then a look of confusion as he spotted Steve.
James walked in with his key and found Sarah in the kitchen and told her what happened. They walked through and got Tony from his office and all piled into James’ car, heading to the hospital.
“You’re not supposed to eat concrete. There’s so much delicious food! Do you want a cookie we made? Oh, but we’ll have lunch soon. After that?” Tony could hear that his little brother was nervous to talk to someone he didn’t really know and he wondered if Clint noticed it too.
It was the weekend and Tony didn’t know what to do with himself. It was his first day in his new home, he didn’t have to work, there were no chores for him to do, and it frightened him. He was on edge, feeling like he was forgetting things, like any moment now Howard would come and yell at him, tell him about the things he should have gotten done, but no such thing happened.
He stepped out, his hat tipped to obscure part of his face and then immediately the umbrella was over his head, Dugan at his side as always.
Steve was surprised when Tony made his way into his lap but he adjusted quickly, holding him while Tony reassured him of the humanity he often felt he’d lost.
, he thought bitterly.
“Dugan? What happened?”
, go home. I’ll stay and let you know if something changes. You’re exhausted.”
“How much did you pay last time?” Dugan asked, his arms folded over his chest, one hand reaching up to stroke his mustache as he spoke. Jones stood slightly behind him, holding a small black book with their account records in it.
“No, because if I run, they
” and “
Once the car had pulled out of the alley and onto the street, James gently guided Clint down so his head rested on James’ thigh. He ran his fingers through his hair, scratching lightly, massaging his ears, stroking his fingers along his cheek and jawline. He knew Clint craved physical touch. As much as he could get or give was what he liked and James certainly did not feel put out doing this for Clint.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes and sighing loudly. “Let’s check the bar.”
“It had better be a dame or a bag of money. You know right now’s my me time,” he said, his voice low and threatening. No one was ever allowed to visit him during his personal time. He put away what he was working on and leaned back, waiting for an explanation.
“It’s no whiskey but I thought apple juice is better than nothing,” Tony joked lightly as he poured the four of them the juice and handed everyone a glass. They chatted about terrible hospital food, uncomfortable beds and their need to sleep in their own beds again and Tony was glad they were able to talk about anything other than what happened and their injuries.
“No, of course not. I was just wondering. It’s not like we ever discussed it.” Not like they really had much reason to either since they wouldn’t be needing to choose someone to officiate a wedding or somewhere to have it.
“Yuck, no!”
“What did you…”
Clint watched him carefully, trying to read his lips but he was mumbling slightly. Clint formed his lips the way he had seen him do it, trying to figure out the name. “Tony?” he repeated, tentatively. “Why are you in here?”
“You?” He asked, his voice trembling.
Desperate to feel Steve as much as he could, Tony agreed with a breathless, “Alright.”
like?”
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve as much as he could, not even caring about the pain in his body, simply needing all the physical contact he could get. “I missed you. God, I missed you so much.” He took several deep breaths, inhaling Steve’s scent, focusing on the warmth he felt radiating from his body. After a minute or two he let go again and looked in his eyes. “How’s Benni? And Sarah? Can I see them?”
Dmitri told him, an impish smile on his lips,
early.
“It was nice to have you here. It’s going to be much quieter without you,” Tony told Clint as he hugged him. “Don’t forget to call whenever you miss me.”
Steve was still a little happy-go-lucky following his romp in the sheets. He hadn't made too much of a habit of going to James’ brothel but rather he spread it out enough to make each time truly worth it.
“Don’t you go taking on blame that isn’t yours to take,” Steve said firmly, sounding like Sarah.
“If you want to call it that. I’m an errand boy and help here and there. Mainly making the best coffee any of them have ever had.” He grinned. Steve hadn’t told him to keep it a secret but from the way they were working around in order for no one to see that Tony was running the books now, he figured it would be a good idea not to tell her the truth. And he did still insist on making the coffee twice a day.
Tony nodded and gave him a small smile. How did people react to compliments?
James closed his eyes, listening, letting Clint’s soothing voice lull him back to sleep.
Steve came over and took the paper back, checking it over quickly and then nodding. “That’s it. I mail these and in a few days we should get the certificates.” He took a bite of the cracker he was holding in his free hand and smiled at Tony, heading for his desk to put the documents into a new envelope.
Going down in a building that belonged to a mob didn’t feel good for many reasons even if Tony didn’t have any grounds to be frightened. He knew from Mr Rogers’ well-built body that he must be strong but to actually see him punching someone was still somewhat surprising. Even more surprising was that he and Mr Rogers were alone within seconds and then his hand came up to touch him, making Tony flinch.
He reached into his pocket and Dugan paled. “It’s a knife. Does not mean I am not happy to see you though,” he told him, his voice serious despite the words coming out.
He finished his food, having no real memory of even eating it, and they all headed to the living room to sit in front of the fire with their dessert. Steve was forcing himself to be with them because he knew it was the right thing to do. Socialize, interact, be with those he cared about and who cared about him. It was hard but he could do this much and then he would shower and crawl back into bed.
He headed downstairs as quietly as possible, stopping in the kitchen first and grabbing the first baked good he saw. His mother had been baking up a storm lately just to get her mind off it all and probably in hopes that those two stubborn boys of hers would eat.
looked at James.
Some time later—Tony wasn’t sure how much time had passed exactly—the door opened and someone put a tray down harshly and left right away. There were two glasses of water, two rolls of bread, and two potatoes. Hastily, Tony drank one of the glasses of water and grabbed a potato and a bread roll, sitting back on his mattress. He didn’t want to risk anything.
Tony asked, wiggling his almost naked body on the bed. Steve let out a sharp exhale, so turned on by Tony and he reached down to pull off that last barrier between himself and Tony’s gorgeous body, admiring him.
that he works with guys who look like you.” He gestured with one hand to each of them in turn and then glanced back at the hallway, jerking a thumb that way. “Any more stupidly good-looking, half-naked men going to come from there?”
Tony looked up, focusing back on the current reality he was trying to escape. He mimicked Clint’s gesture. “Oh, you mean—“ He stopped himself and shook his head. He pointed to his heart and Clint’s and mimed someone coming in. They should wait for James and Steve.
“I want to stay,” he said, looking at Sarah for just a second.
“It makes sense,” James said. “Shared trauma. And it’s a situation in which Steve and I have only ever been on the other side of. We could never hope to understand what they’re going through.”
Steve’s eyes widened and James leaned forward as well now, wanting to keep his voice as low as possible. He told Steve everything in the minutest detail, not leaving out a single thing about this situation.
Steve chuckled at Tony’s expression, his hand falling onto Tony’s thigh again and he winked.
It was the second day of not being home that Tony gave in to his hunger. He ate the potato slowly, looking at the window. It was brighter outside than it had been a few hours ago. The difference wasn’t too big but with nothing else to focus on, he noticed.
“Alright!” Benni jumped off Tony’s lap and followed Sarah back into the kitchen. Once again Tony was reminded of how lucky he was that Sarah took such great care of his little brother and that she left nothing for Tony to worry about.
“Thank you,” Steve said softly, his thumb immediately stroking the back of his hand. “Do you want to try and sleep?” He moved a little to show that he was offering up his chest again if Tony wanted to lay there.
Steve pulled out two files from his desk and handed them over to Tony.
In an effort to spend more time with Benni, he managed to talk himself into leaving the house. It wasn’t nice at first and it took everything he had not to run back to where he knew he was warm and safe. He couldn’t wait for the cold season to be over and for the sun to warm his skin again. Today they were going to visit Clint and Lucky before James took them on vacation as well. Unfortunately, Clint needed to be taken for a checkup on his leg, which meant they only saw them for a minute and then were left alone with the dog, who was more than happy for the change of company.
“Wow, good to see you too,” Steve said, still laughing as he pulled away, putting a hand on James’ shoulder. James looked around Steve to see Tony, to whom he waved. Tony looked a lot better already, which he wasn’t expecting but was nonetheless happy for it.
“All I’m trying to be is truthful and get it into your head that even if you look different, I don’t love you any different. I could tell you didn’t believe me the first time I said you were beautiful,” James said, his fingers trailing lightly up and down Clint’s side. “I’ll just have to convince you again.”
He hoped Tony was alright seeing as Clint had just left without even saying goodbye and wasn’t even planning to come back tonight. He did want to go tomorrow. At least, that’s how he felt at the moment. That could change after spending the night in his own bed with James. But it wasn’t like they wouldn’t be together at Steve’s.
James shrugged. “It was a last minute decision. Dmitri and I finished up some work early. Thought I’d surprise you.”
“No, you’re not dead. You almost were.” He didn’t do tact very well.
“The guilt is eating me alive, Steve,” James said, the hand around his glass growing dangerously tight so he moved it to rest on his leg. “I can’t sleep. Clint’s noticed.”
Clint watched Tony, saw the way his chest rose and fell, and looked away, realizing that this was a private moment. He put away the rest of his roll for later and laid down, closing his eyes again.
“Hey,” Steve said, “doing alright?”
The three of them met in different clothes in the kitchen and looked around. There was no Sarah or breakfast. Without saying a word, Tony started preparing scrambled eggs and grilled cheese sandwiches. His eyes slid to the coffee machine in Sarah’s kitchen. Her coffee was alright but he used to his much stronger coffee again. He met Steve’s eyes who looked at him with questions but Tony simply shook his head. Everything was fine. His biggest worry was coffee that wasn’t quite strong enough for him.
After a moment’s hesitation he pushed all those thoughts away and opened the door. And then he was greeted with blue and a wave of Steve’s scent. After his eyes got used to the darkness he looked around. Another big bed, a lot more pillows though, the same shades of blue; his hat balanced on a lamp next to a big desk with folders, papers and a briefcase next to it. If he hadn’t known better he would have assumed that Steve had a normal nine to five desk job in some office. Tony looked at the walls and paintings. He tiptoed into the room to get a closer look and opened the curtains to let in a little light to examine the picture further. Never before had he seen so much green in one place and he couldn’t help but wonder if it could be real.
“What of him?”
“Is that surprise I hear, young man?” Sarah scoffed and put her knitting away to come and kiss them both on their cheeks. “Where have you been?”
“I am. The process is fairly quick and easy. No one’s gonna bother you or be looking too closely into our lives,” Steve assured him with a smile. “And I look forward to calling you Mr Rogers.” Steve’s smirk was dirty even if his tone wasn’t and he was grateful that he was angled slightly away from his mother.
And then he pulled away, millimeters from his lips because it didn’t matter. It wasn’t right and he wouldn’t do that to him. He loved Tony and even if he couldn’t show him the way he wanted, he would love him in every other sense of the word.
“Well you certainly caught her attention, Stevie,” Sarah said, sending a grin Tony’s way.
“I know, Cap. My apologies. I’ll fix it.”
Steve tentatively sat down in the chair across from the desk, looking around.
He came into his office and found Tony there, bringing in reports, Falsworth with him as he always was, pretending that he was running the books and Tony was just his lackey who carried the documents.
She walked over to him and dropped her arms, holding one up to shake his hand.
but I’m sure you’ll learn it faster.” James rolled his eyes, lifting his arm to rest on the back of Clint’s chair. “Or Nat can teach you.”
“Okay,” the boy said and sniffed softly.
“How’s the little one? Is he here?” He knew Benni might be able to cheer Jones up some. He loved that kid.
“So… cops? Or explanation?” Steve asked and the man sighed and nodded.
Why don’t you join us?”
“Sure.” He nodded and cleaned his dirty hands before heading upstairs, taking his time. His whole day had been rather exhausting despite all the sleep he got. On top of that he felt uncomfortable going after them. Who knew if they had something they needed to talk about or things to sort out?
Steve thought about it for a while. Thought about the times during the drinks every so often when he and James would talk about it. “So far,” he began, slowly, “it hasn’t gone away. But again, I’ve had a bit more exposure than you. But it gets… easier? Well, you learn to manage it. To live with it most days rather than in fear of it.” He didn’t want Tony to know what this felt like. That’s why he never wanted to send him on out of office work. When he’d told him about Howard and where they were keeping him, when he’d explained the reason why he was still alive, Steve had hoped against hope that Tony would tell him to take care of it. Tell him he never wanted to see Howard again and Steve would’ve gone and done the job before he could change his mind. He didn’t want Tony to know what this felt like but Steve and James were never getting their innocence back, it didn’t matter. “I had hoped you’d say you didn’t want to do it.”
“Somethin’ botherin’ ya?” Since they started seeing each other again, Pepper had been more open with Tony. They hadn’t spoken about anything that had happened, though she probably knew from what the neighbors had told others. Tony wasn’t interested in gossip about himself and it didn’t seem that Pepper wanted too many details either.
“James and I tended to some business and then we got a drink at Clint’s bar and it was… long overdue. We talked, got some things off our chests. Things that, love, I want to tell you but not tonight. Or at least, not all of it.”
Tony shook his head and rolled his eyes. “And eat while you’re at it. Not enough food plus drugs in your system can’t be good.” He brought the tray over. There was some soup, half a sandwich and a fruit salad. “They said not too much at once.”
“Don’t need it,” James clarified, pulling out Maria’s chair for her and Clint followed suit for Natalia. Two of the wait staff came over to help seat James and Clint. When James unbuttoned his jacket to sit, his ever-present blade in its sheath was fully visible, disappearing again as he sat and his jacket covered it. Clint heard a few gasps and again hid his smile, turning it into a cough. He wondered absently how many weapons James had on him at that very moment and he also found comfort in the thought.
The relief was short lived though, as the suspicion began creeping back up. Was this some kind of ruse by the men who had taken him to get him to give up information? Stick a young guy in here with him who looked beaten and hungry to get Clint to take pity on him and start talking?
“Yes?” James asked him, noting his body language and the way he kept looking over at him with mild confusion. He tried to make himself look as approachable as possible but knew that even relaxed, his expression was not always the most inviting. “You have questions.”
He spread the rest of the sheets out more, putting some on the floor and crouching over them. The jacket was in his way so he simply got rid of it, putting it on a chair so it wouldn’t wrinkle too much. He crouched back down to look at the documents. From somewhere came a notepad and a pencil which Tony accepted gladly and started scribbling down things and moving from sheet to sheet.
“Good,” she said, reaching for her cane and hitting it on the wooden floor loudly. A door opened and a man came in. She looked up at him, said something to him in Mandarin, and he left again. “Li Qiang will bring you what I have on Bakuto.”
James didn’t react other than to say, “No. We had more important issues.”
He spotted him across the room talking to a few people at a booth. There was a wide grin on his face, his eyes little half-moons as he laughed. James could just make out Carol Danvers’ face among the group and he smiled watching him, the whole thing bringing him back to that night so many months ago when he’d shown up to tell Clint he loved him.
James walked the cake over to the table and sat it in the middle, Steve still putting out the dessert plates for everyone. It was a rule, whoever cooked thereafter did the least work and the cook was usually Sarah.
“Did my favorite person make my
But for now, he busied himself with the reports Dmitri had brought in detailing weapon sale and acquisition in the last month, which was one of the many businesses that previously belonged to Bakuto and now were Steve and James’.
He fought back the desire to move closer, to move his hand to sit dangerously far up Tony’s thigh and ask what else he wanted in the voice he knew from experience had a mean effect on men. He leaned further into the couch, licked his lips again. God he was dying to kiss Tony. It was like being denied air at this point but he kept himself composed. “Can we start now?” he asked, risking coming across as over-enthusiastic and suspicious.
“I can deal with that,” Tony agreed and intertwined their fingers. “Anything you want me to know? Apart from where we’re safe together?”
“Oh, sorry. Lucky, get—”
“So then why did you? I mean, why did you say yes? To be nice? Because of Rhodey?” Tony asked from behind his menu. He could be as bold and brave as he wanted with it to hide his expressions.
Clint had been through something that had left him at a disadvantage before, losing his hearing, and now, although he knew in the back of his mind that his leg would heal, he was reminded of how he had struggled and how frustration it was to have to rely on others for so much. Clint was an incredibly independent person, had been for years, so even though the people he was left to rely on were James, Natalia, Dmitri, and occasionally Maria, it was still hard.
have time for your antics,” James snapped, the idea of Clint in some cold, wet room kept flashing in his mind and it was making him irritable. He could imagine Steve was struggling to keep a lid on his worry as well. “What aren’t you telling me?”
“Just like I wish I could ease yours and I don't just mean with James.” He knew she was talking about Tony obviously but she didn’t say anything else about him, knowing Steve wasn’t ready for or wanting that talk just yet.
“So now that you two have met,” Steve said, “let’s get down to business.” He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and unfolded it on the table. Then he reached behind him and pulled the gun out of the back of his trouser waistband and set it on the table on top of the cloth. “It’s not loaded,” he said, opening it to show Tony, “but I want you to know all the ins and outs of it before it is.”
Rhodey sighed, having hoped to avoid this topic for as long as possible. He wasn’t angry anymore, just resigned and reluctant to think about all the ways this could go wrong. Steve wasn’t a grudge-holding man but there was still the possibility for this to really not go in anyone’s favor.
Sarah knocked on the door and put in an order with one of the younger guys stood outside who treated her with the same level of respect as Steve. When she turned back to Tony and processed what he said, she laughed, shaking her head. “You’ve got a broken arm, you had a concussion, multiple lacerations, broken ribs and a punctured lung, boyo.” She picked up the chart at the end of the bed and browsed through, making sure she hadn’t missed anything. “Ah right, let’s not forget about the twenty-eight stitches you’ve got.”
At one point Steve shifted, sighed and continued to sleep on his usual half of the bed. With the curtains open and the full moon shining in Tony could admire Steve’s sleeping form. How did he always manage to push the blanket off? This was exactly why Tony insisted on having his own blanket so he wouldn’t get cold during the night.
“Oh, I like the sound of that,” Steve said to James and then he laughed. “I’m sorry are you begging? Do you want us to not hurt your sorry arse?”
“I didn’t expect him to be able to go back so soon.”
“Don’t talk to me like that! I’m your father,” Howard barked. If he continued to be this loud he would wake the little one. So Tony went to close the kitchen door to muffle out the noises.
“No, we got the call in the middle of the night. I left him a note but I’ll get him soon probably.” He felt out of place yet again. Maybe he should ask Dmitri to get Benni.
When Tony was close enough to the desk, Steve spoke, “Why exactly do you need help?”
Steve was adamant about taking care of Tony. So much so that he wouldn’t even let him climb the stairs because it caused him discomfort. He also helped Tony change. It was overwhelming Tony with too many emotions, making him give in to Steve’s coddling.
“This is so entirely fucked up, Steve,” James sighed miserably and Steve nodded, just as solemn now. “All I want is to spoil him rotten, give him the entire world and then some, and yet here I am ruining his life.”
Tony closed his eyes and tried to hide away from the noise of fighting. All of that right after talking about his father was too much.
Tony moved to rest his hands on the back of Steve’s neck and leaned in to kiss his lips again.
the Irish kept tipping him. He couldn’t depend on that. Every cent was better than nothing and he was grateful for it.
Tony listened to them, not wanting to push them to talk more about the war since it was always a touchy subject, which was understandable of course. He nodded to Steve to give him a sign that he understood. Speaking in a different language was impolite and he didn’t want to arouse suspicion.
On the fourth day, Sarah and Benni saw Steve leave. He was grabbing a muffin from the kitchen that she and Benni had made as he headed out and they made it in just in time to say goodbye to him. That was it.
She had lifted her tea to her lips but stopped, her eyes raising to meet James’. “Do you plan to kill him?”
Steve glanced around. “I’d say a good portion of them. Some are just maps, so I skimmed them. The ones on the desk at the back I’m currently reading,” he told him, pointing to the stack of five books. “But I’d like to get through all of them some day. See anything you’d like to have in your own room?”
“Welcome home,” he greeted him, still in awe of seeing him standing there. “I’m guessing you all knew he was coming home early? And this was just a distraction?” He asked and looked at Dugan who grinned ever so slightly.
Clint was standing there, shirtless, his hair a bird’s nest on top of his head, and lips parted. He was just staring at James.
“Please get here soon, Steve,” he whispered and hugged his knees close to his chest in an attempt to make himself feel warmer and more comfortable. He hated the cold.
His breathing sped up and he felt hot and cold at the same time. Was the room spinning? Or was it him? Tony couldn’t tell.
your fault,” he gave back shyly and kissed him before getting up. “I know there’s a lot we have to figure out. Especially me. Will you show me?” He asked with a sly smirk.
Hearing Tony say those words was like Christmas and every other holiday and happy moment Steve had ever had in his life all bundled up into five words. He kissed him back, never able to get enough of the taste he’d been craving for months.
“Is it okay if I stay with you tonight?” Tony asked, closing his eyes while listening to Steve’s breathing.
why didn’t you tell me your captain was so good in bed? Had I known, I would’ve jumped his bones that morning when he found me on his couch.”
and give her an update. Or do you think James did that too?” He half-expected James to enter the room when Tony said his name.
to go? Was Tony too much of a mess? Should he talk about why it was too much? “I’m sorry. It was nice with everyone,” he whispered, out of habit.
Instead of saying anything, Steve put his left hand on top of Tony’s and guided him back to the keys to help him play. It was such a little thing. So little that for others it probably wasn’t even worth mentioning. Everyone messed up, right? But how many people froze in response to making a mistake?
She nodded slowly. “I did and then I didn’t.”
“No, Tony, love, you’ll worry but you’ll be safe. I’ll worry and I’ll be
Steve hated it when James was right. Hated it with a passion. “You shouldn’t have to ask,” he said, “and from now on you won’t.” He didn’t know what to say about the second thing. He supposed—hoped—that would come with time. He was looking into Tony’s eyes, searching them. “I wanna do right by you. I’m just learning how.”
A knock at the door brought him out of his head and back to reality. He called for them to come in. It was Dugan, back from the jobs he’d been given to do after taking Tony home.
Steve’s eyes were still on Tony and he spoke again slowly, his voice dropping another octave, “Tell me something. And I want the truth.” He waited a beat. “Did your brother deserve a beating?”
thanks from us both :)
,” Tony said softly and Benni sat down to look at his brother like he had asked. “
With the rest of the unfinished food in front of him, Tony sat back down in the chair and ate slowly. He truly hoped Steve would feel better soon. For his own sake and not Tony’s.
Tony listened and watched closely but there was nothing for him to do. Steve got angry easily and he was just as stubborn as James and that certainly didn’t help anyone.
“Now, I hope you haven’t eaten. I brought enough for all of you. Dmitri is just getting proper dishes for everything,” Sarah said and started unpacking boxes full of delicious smelling food.
!” James exclaimed sarcastically. “He would’ve met someone else, Steve! Some fella whose very existence wouldn’t paint a target on his back.”
“Can dinner be a surprise then?”
me. And while I’m glad we talked about it, we don’t have to stay on the subject now. What is it you were wanting to talk about?”
James matched eyes with Steve for a brief moment, another silent understanding between them. Steve’s arm around Tony tightened the smallest bit, protective.
“What words have you heard?”
Loki had upped his security but that still didn’t mean it was capable of keeping Steve or James out, especially not when they worked together.
“Oh,” Clint said, the first to understand and Natalia followed quickly after him with Maria last but she nodded and smiled, walking over to link her arm with James’.
it.” He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him again. “On one condition.” He waited for Steve to nod. “Don’t stop trusting me. Ever. You’re all I want. And don’t stop reminding me of what we’ve overcome in the past.”
“James called a little while ago. They’ll be back tomorrow.”
They were quiet for a while, less than five minutes away from home now.
“If you hate him so much why don’t you just fire him?” she asked.
Tony closed his eyes, his head working way too fast and starting to hurt. He frowned in discomfort and shifted in his bed, realizing just how sore his whole body felt. “Who are you? And where’s my brother?” He asked once he managed to open his eyes again.
“The Rolex. It’s water-resistant. Mine can be forgetful. Might accidentally shower with it,” James said, looking up at Monet who was standing off to the side so the two men could have their private conversation. “But I’m considering getting both. And you?”
Clint rolled his eyes and it was so far from any reaction James had expected that he laughed.
“Bakuto?” James asked and Clint nodded. “Yes. It’s just… frustrating. And infuriating and every time I see you wince, I get this rush of anger.” It wasn’t a lie, it just wasn’t the whole truth either but James knew how Clint would respond to him admitting he blamed himself for what happened to them. He knew he would argue that it wasn’t his fault and that when he inevitably couldn’t convince James otherwise, it would plague him almost as constantly as it did James.
“No,” Tony said and shook his head. At least that was clear to both of them. It almost made Tony smile.
James smiled, his eyes already closing a little as Clint’s hand worked, a low moan escaping his lips that made Clint grin. “Have I told you lately that you’re the best?” he asked, his voice a low, happy sound. He lifted his hips to slide the band of his trousers down.
He turned to Tony, holding out the supplies left by Nurse Mary. “Take these. They’re better than anything you can buy at the pharmacy.” Steve turned without another word and walked off, taking another exit out of the gym.
He turned his head when Jones stirred, his eyes opening slowly. He looked around the room and slowly tried to sit up a little.
“I’m glad you’re here though.” He reached his hand out for Clint to take, craving more physical reassurance.
James said and Dmitri looked up, the smallest trace of a smile on his lips. James had recently started using the affectionate nickname just out of the blue and neither of them had commented on it but Dmitri
Dugan had the car ready by the time he got outside and he slipped into the passenger's seat, just the two of them. He trusted Jones and Falsworth but Dugan would always be his closest confidant of all the Irish, save of course for his mother.
Clint hadn’t expected an entire class report but it was sweet nonetheless and made him smile. Steve seemed to be a good topic to distract Tony with and Clint got a good insight into Rogers at the same time.
“Good catch. How’d you like his job?” He asked. He would set Tony up in his room though because while his three most trusted had no problem with Tony’s presence—he knew not everyone would be thrilled at the idea of a little Italian fella running their books.
Steve laughed. “Why thank you. First time I’ve heard that,” he said, smiling down at him. He ducked to kiss him and then looked around the room, over to the bedside table. “Are you thirsty? Can I get you something? It’s been a while since I’ve stayed the night with someone—bird or fella—I think I’m a little behind on the etiquette.”
In all honesty, Clint’s mind was still fixated on ‘baby’ but he did hear the rest and he leaned forward to kiss James. “I have to process it myself first and then… I’ll let you know. It’s not that I don’t want to talk about it with you. I just...”
He pulled away to be able to look at Steve, smiling at him lovingly.
He pulled out another list from the front of the first folder that had every local business and other person/entity that paid Steve and the mob along with their due amounts.
“It’s okay,” Clint said although it had hurt that he didn’t come.
“I’m having sleep,” Bucky said from beside him. “What’s taking him so long?” Sam shrugged.
He found himself in a room not unlike the one in which Sarah, James and he had waited only a few weeks ago. Sarah was leaned against James with her eyes closed. As if she knew that Tony was looking at her, she raised her head and looked at him.
.” James chuckled. “I know what you’ve done for me and I know that I’m happy with you and for me, that’s all that matters.”
Maria turned to him, surprised, and he apologized quietly. She shrugged and leaned back, not bothered by the contact, just surprised. Still, he lowered his hand and looked around the room before his eyes went to Clint who smiled knowingly at him, nudging his foot under the table. James sighed. What he wouldn’t give to be able to wrap his arm around Clint’s shoulders or even hold his hand under the table without arousing suspicion.
+   +
A shiver ran down Tony’s spine and he prayed to god it wasn’t too obvious why.
“Of course I am,” Tony said, feeling dangerously heavy. He couldn’t fall asleep. “Let me check on Dugan and Jones real quick.” He got up and headed out of the room. The other men were up and eating when Tony came in.
“What if you hate it?”
“Yes, yes, I am. I don’t think you realize you can’t fight off your emotions with a knife although I’m sure you tried.”
,” Steve responded in Russian. “
James let out a soft sigh, turning to look at Steve and Steve saw the dread in his expression, the worry. “I don’t know,” James said after a long drawn out silence. He didn’t. He had no way of knowing and he wasn’t going to give either himself or Steve the false hope that they were.
Tony!” Ah, so his name was Tony.
“How do you know it’s him?” Natalia asked, sitting between Dmitri and Dugan, all eyes on her now but it didn’t phase her in the slightest.
“I’m glad James isn’t alone in that big house of his anymore. I always wondered if he got lonely,” Tony said and rested his chin on top of his knees. “Tell me about your bar.”
Steve nodded, processing that. At least he wasn’t his brother. He could live with anything else.
“Clint has been taken. As well as someone he cares about,” James said, when Loki was able to focus on them again, gesturing to Steve. “And I’m pretty sure you know more about who took them than you let on the last time I was here.”
“Well, I have bad news for you. My looks only go downhill from here.” He gently inspected his red, stinging cheek with his fingers. Tony handed him his water and he drank, still waiting to see if they would come drag Tony out next. “I think I was on the phone to James just now.”
Jones came in then, his face sympathetic but also a tiny bit irritated. “Never trusted me enough, Cap?” He asked, putting another file on the desk. It was the boy Dugan had questioned but left alive. They were also collecting the good ones for their own knowledge of who was alright.
“Then we’ll do that together.” James snorted lightly and Steve looked away from his muffin over to him. “What?”
“I don’t know,” Tony said and shrugged. It was a half-truth. He knew where he could find his father but it wasn’t like his father told him where he was going and when or why. All Tony knew was he took money from the register for whatever he was doing. “You’re probably not asking because you want to see him, sir?” he dared to give the man the slightest grin and looked right back down.
Steve and James were both borderline tipsy on the way home. Steve was slurring his words and his accent came out thicker, more Irish than American. James handled his liquor better usually but he’d been drinking on an empty stomach whereas Steve always had a few snacks throughout the day so he was also sporting an accent more befitting of his heritage.
“He asked me out.”
Steve raised his glass to his lips, watching Tony over it with a look that made Tony’s knees feel weak even though he was sitting down.
He was rested, relaxed, and in love. He was about to go on holiday—or his honeymoon, as he had been referring to it in his own head—with the absolute love of his life, the man he never ever thought he would get to have, and he couldn’t be happier. He just hoped, as he had been ever since he first started planning this was James, that Tony would love it too.
“Arranging flights,” James mumbled after a moment, almost having forgotten the question as Clint’s thumbs worked their way into the knots in James’ shoulders. It wasn’t like that was really anything to give away. Clint knew they would have to get to France somehow.
“Pulled it off of a piece of one of the timers we recovered,” she said, seeming quite smug. “
“What the hell is wrong with you? What part of off-limits, quiet zone, and
“Liar,” he laughed, wincing and James’ hand moved to his forehead to steady him, his fingers moving down to gently caress his cheek. “I feel like shit. What happened?”
He looked back to Tony, his heart racing. “Distraction, please. I can’t talk about it right now.”
“The strongest,” he said, grateful that Clint understood. “Does it bother you?”
He leaned forward, resting his bruised knuckles on his desk with a small smile. “Not anymore.”
“Of course. It’s the
Tony bit back a sigh. He liked hearing him talk and it helped but there were just so many words to hear and react to. Still he hummed every now and then, indicating that he was still listening. While Steve was talking about Ireland he remembered the summer in Italy—the memories that had been from so long ago they must have been altered in his mind. He remembered the bright and warm sun, many people talking and laughing, some music in the background. And then he saw a flash of Howard’s face and the blood spatter behind his head. Tony opened his eyes in shock and sat up straight.
“Just about forty minutes or so.” He nodded and looked over at the food. She brought one tray over for him and he took the bread roll and ate it slowly while she talked. “So this is him?” Another nod. “I guess this isn’t you trying to give me full grown grandchildren, right?”
“And if he doesn’t?”
Clint knew that smile Tony gave him. He knew it from seeing it on James’ face, especially in the beginning when he wanted to be polite and let Clint ramble on but didn’t seem to know what or how to add something himself. Clint was used to being the person who talked to fill silence.
“Clint,” James breathed, the word almost a gasp. He was interrupted midway through by Clint’s repeated “Hello?”
“You started drinking already?”
“You think we should let the guys know food will be ready soon?”
He gave up on his clothes and just pushed Steve’s pants down and his shirt up. Yes, this was much better and easier. He turned them around so that Steve was against the wall as he got down on his knees.
The anger in his voice made Tony take a step back instinctively. How he really didn’t want to answer the question. At the same time he couldn’t think of an excuse. Every second he didn’t answer made him more nervous. He simply couldn’t reply.
“Was Christmas a big part of your childhood?”
“Thank you.”
He laid back down but the stress and the guilt he felt weighed too heavily on him to even close his eyes. Every minute counted, every second. Tony was counting on him. Tony needed him and if Steve couldn’t sleep, he should use the extra hours to do whatever he could to get closer to finding them.
It was a week later before anything happened again. They were down to just two. One of the boys and Falsworth. They’d gone through their entire organization, only ten more weeded out. Some knew nothing, others didn’t care and some, it felt, shared Steve’s way of life.
“Why would he be trying to get information on you?”
Even though he was asleep—and in a wonderful dreamless sleep at that—Tony woke up immediately when touched. For a split second he saw himself back in his bed with Benni next to him and Howard behind him. That picture quickly disappeared and instead he saw him. Mr Rogers.
neimovernyy  (Russian) - incredible
“Thank you for calling me,” James added before he left because he knew it could not have been easy to pick up the phone and dial that number. He actually wondered how he had even managed to get it with Clint incapacitated as he was.
“You’re safe,” he said, Clint’s eyes watching his face as he spoke. “We’ve got you. Hungry?”
The irony of what they were currently doing wasn’t lost on either of the mob bosses as they walked into the dark room, rolling up their sleeves. The door shut behind them and then it was just the three of them in the cold, damp room.
A small sound of surprise came from Tony when he was pulled into the sudden hug. He wanted to take a step back —an ugly force of habit— but instead he leaned into the hug, wrapping his arms around Steve as well. It was the first time he hugged someone that much taller. He could probably rest against Steve with all his weight and he wouldn’t be bothered. He would probably just continue to hold him.
Tony smiled and closed his eyes again, drifting off. “Good. I can rest then,” he mumbled and fell asleep within seconds.
“I can’t belie—wait. Am I the first person to find out what James Romanov fears? Oh wait, no, Steve probably knows.”
“Hush and go to sleep, pet, I’m fine,” Sarah said and gently guided Tony into Benni’s bed, tucked both in, and gave each of them a good night kiss on the forehead, turning the lights back off and closing the door. Tony held his brother but was unable to go back to sleep. He had no idea how much this all had affected Benni despite all his efforts to keep the boy safe from the beating. Now he realized that he had had the same experience as Tony but as bystander and not as the one taking a beating.
James was well aware of Clint’s tendency to have bad days even before Bakuto. Between his wartime experiences and his childhood, Clint’s life had not been without its fair share of badness. And badness was putting it lightly.
Tony put down the things he would take back to Sarah’s kitchen and nearly jumped when Steve whispered to him. The tickling of Steve’s breath on his skin made the hairs on his neck stand up.
There was a pile of letters on Steve’s desk and he sat there, staring at them, going through at least ten strategies at once. Dugan was sitting opposite of him. Tony had been asked to knock before entering but Jones had some work for him to do anyway so he was busy.
“To give to whoever he’s working for.”
He did worry about Sarah though. Not like he really needed to. He knew she could look after herself better than any of them combined and he knew she would have Benni. Occasionally, they would even look after Lucky.
Tony remained in bed even after Steve had gotten up again. He didn’t want to make him feel bad and pretended to sleep. That was until he heard hushed voices and quiet steps on the stairs and in the hallway. When Steve finally came back and Tony was comfortable again, he decided to say something. “Love you more.”
“Oh?” Tony asked and Steve regretted it immediately. “Why so?” Tony called over the nearest waitress and ordered himself and Steve a nice bottle of wine. They’d texted about liking wine with their steak but Steve was humble enough to admit he knew nothing about them, just that he liked dry, older wines.
He thought about walking over to the gym but Falsworth might be there and he really didn’t want to talk to someone he was less close to than Dugan. He didn’t know where his mother was but he didn’t feel like being coddled either or the alternative, told to get a grip so he didn’t seek her out either.
Tony took the folder and saw numbers. Didn’t take a genius to see that it was about money. The amounts of money he saw there were incredible. Of course he realized that Steve was wealthy, he didn’t know just
Dmitri said, and James snapped out of his thoughts and his worries about Clint and looked up at Dmitri, feeling somewhat distant and disconnected from the present moment. After a gentle shake of his head, he felt a bit clearer and nodded.
Steve was leaning back in his chair, arms in the usual position, one across his chest while the other came up to tap his chin, his eyes fixed on the food for once instead of Tony.
“Well, I’d say the same about Tony. If it’s really bothering you that much, you should tell him. Ask him. He always tells you the truth. It’s sweet, really. And I’d be willing to bet my left arm that he doesn’t resent you, Steve. I’ve seen the way that boy looks at you. As though you alone put the moon and the stars in the sky just for him,” James said and Steve rolled his eyes as he always did whenever James waxed poetic.
Tony tossed his tablet onto a nearby chair and walked over. “Not anymore. What is it?”
“You two not sticking around for dessert?” Sarah asked and James shook his head. Benni looked disappointed and James almost changed his mind just to make the boy smile but Clint, as always, was his priority.
“Sure thing, laddie.”
“For us?” Steve asked and wanted to take it back the moment he saw the way Tony flinched at the surprise in his tone. He wrapped a hand firmly around each of Tony’s forearms and pulled him closer, smiling gently. “Not in a bad way. I just didn’t expect you to ask me to move in with you today. That is what you’re asking right?”
“You taste perfect.”
When Howard didn’t come home that night Tony was on edge. It never meant anything good when he didn’t come back. Though there was always the small chance he got hit by a car and died. Or mugged and killed. Or maybe angered someone he shouldn’t have and got shot. One could only dream.
“Let’s be sure.”
possible way.
’ mother. She’s a wonderful woman.” Saying that name made James want to laugh. He would definitely be teasing Steve with that in the near future.
The moment the van was back on normal road, Clint had no clue where he was and neither did anyone else but his captors.
He just wanted his Clint back. Bakuto could have everything else. He could have James’ money and his organization. He could have James’ home. James just wanted his Clint.
, my men know we have a tacit truce with you and yours. You don’t need my permission when they conveniently forget.”
Clint chuckled. “How can you be rude and sweet all at once?” It helped.
“What was that about, Cap?” he asked, not usually one to question Steve but probably the only one other than James who could and not at the very least get his head bitten off and at the very most get shot.
“You are what?” Sarah asked, taking the seat on the other side of Clint and leaning in to press a kiss to his cheek.
Steve pulled back enough to put both hands on Tony’s upper arms, wrapping a hand around them. He was a thin boy but wiry, there was muscle there not just skin and bone, but it was definitely an area that could be improved and would also help with his shooting skills.
Tony looked away when she said the last sentence. He’d never needed help before. Not like this. Not that he would have gotten it anyway. It was a foreign concept to him, no matter how how he put it in his mind.
“Are ya hungry?” Sarah asked, still petting Tony’s hair. Even though he didn’t answer she gently made him sit up. “Let’s get some food into you. And a nice cuppa coffee.”
“The more I drink,” Tony told him with a laugh and though that wasn’t how Steve would have phrased it, it had the same effect and he smiled. Especially when he thought about the two glasses of wine Tony had had tonight and the half-full glasses they’d left in the living room.
It was only then that he noticed Steve’s smile and for some inexplicable reason it made Tony feel embarrassed. Why was he so excited about this? He cleared his throat and put down his coat.
Steve moved out, slowly towards the sidewalk. Falsworth moved faster, coming around the corner and grabbing Steve by his arm and slamming him into the wall. Steve was a big guy, a strong fella, but so was Falsworth and he had years of boxing on his side.
“I know. Go save some more kittens, hot stuff,” Tony said with a smirk.
Dugan gave him a look and then spat on the sidewalk. “I’m handling it.”
“Money won’t do it, threats won’t, nothing is working, Cap.”
Steve dismissed the maid who was assigned to help them put away their luggage and ready the room. He then told her that her services will only be required when requested and that she should not under any circumstance bother them otherwise. It had been made clear to the staff just who exactly Steve was so she nodded without another word and left them to it.
“I won’t.” He ran his fingers through his hair. “Have you eaten breakfast?” She shook her head and James pressed a button on his desk beside the phone. Dmitri came in.
“You better. I don’t want to have to leave you for him,” Tony said casually and rolled off of Steve but kept so close to him that their bare bodies were still touching. “He can read lips. We’d have to have light for that though.”
Tony dared to look up when Steve moved. He knew he didn’t have to be afraid of any physical consequences for what he said. Not with him. It was still just a force of habit. He was rubbing his hand over his knee while he tried to figure out what to say. “Thank you,” he said with a quiet but sincere voice. “I… I’m really grateful for what you’re doing.”
“I just wanted to check on you two. Everyone has updated me but I needed to see with my own eyes that you were alright,” Steve said, leaning against the door. Two of James’ men stood behind him, ready to catch him if he collapsed. He had threatened them when they attempted to put him back in his own bed and he’d done it again when they touched him, trying to support him.
Steve followed, right on his heels, already strategizing as he walked and James agreed or disagreed with his proposals. Before they knew it, they had been planning the rescue for an hour, neither having changed or bathed yet.
his help. He had never for a second stopped to even consider that. Steve didn’t have any siblings, his situation had been different. It was just him, his mother and his son-of-a-bitch father. He gladly would have accepted any offer of relief but while Tony got relief from his home life, his other worries only piled up.
He came around the corner loosening his tie and Clint’s eyes swept him from top to bottom three times before he even spoke. His hair was slightly disheveled, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and waistcoat unbuttoned, and now his tie hung around his neck loosely. He leaned against the doorframe and smiled in at them, his hands sliding into his pockets. Clint smiled back until he
“That’s more than a start, let’s go,” James said, causing Steve to look over at him. Steve was usually the one ready to jump at the first sign of anything. James was not. He was the one who calculated every step and then calculated it again. Steve worried moving so fast might be the wrong move.
“If you happen to be in the neighborhood again, I wouldn’t mind seeing you
As Clint had suspected, James was able to get him an appointment for that afternoon. Dr Reyes was as polite and efficient as ever, giving Clint a quick once-over while James stood at the back of the room. Clint was silently impressed with Dr Reyes’ cool under such close and intense observation from James but she did what needed to be done without a mistake or too long of a pause.
Steve sighed heavily, both of his hands holding onto his belt buckle as he thought. “What’s not—”
“Finally,” James laughed, putting more food than seemed strictly necessary or graceful on his fork but his manner of eating was otherwise painfully proper. As were Steve and Sarah’s.
Tony walked on the left side of the stairs, staying close to the cold wall beside him. His right hand was holding the keys in his pocket in place and his left hand was on the wall, supporting his trembling body on his way down.
Steve watched them leave and then turned his attention to Tony. “Are you cross with me?”
“I’m guessing Clint has,” Steve surmised and James nodded. “Told me about something he regretted not ever being able to do but now he could.”
“See? I told you he’d come back.” She got up again, even though Tony told her to stay. “I wanted to keep the lass company. Are you joining us for dinner, Virginia?”
James looked over, holding a wristwatch in each of his hands. Steve met his eyes and then looked at Monet, a younger woman than Steve had expected. He looked back at James who gestured to Monet with one of the watches.
“That’s
she said, returning the kiss.
The warmth in his chest spread through his whole body, making him smile. And that was all he could feel or think.
“Yes?”
to the actual weeks he had spent not knowing if Clint was still alive.
Tony topped up his own coffee and sat down at the table next to Clint. “Not bothering me but it’s something that pops up in my mind every now and then. Especially earlier.” He took a sip of his coffee. It was nice to hear that he didn’t think it was an issue. Not that it would have influenced Tony’s feelings for Steve or their relationship. It was the anxiety that maybe James and Sarah thought that way too.
Tony smiled, tilting his head to one side as he watched Clint. “That's very romantic. You better invite me.” He stretched a little and looked up when he heard steps coming down the stairs. Benni hesitated before coming back into the kitchen, silently heading for Lucky and petting the dog.
“But if we don’t, they’ll pretend everything is fine and just get worse. They have each other to get through this and so do we,” James said. “And the last thing either of them need is us piling our guilt on them.”
Steve sat on the side of the bed contemplating if he was more hungry or tired. Eventually hunger won out and he stood, stretching, and picked up his shirt from where he’d left it folded last night, not even bothering to put it on.
Upstairs in his office, Steve opened the door. It felt like forever since he and Tony had been in there together, especially alone. He set Tony up at one of the couches and pulled the table closer for him which Tony looked like he wanted to protest and let Steve know he could do it himself but he stayed quiet and just frowned instead, making Steve smile.
James pressed a button on the wall and a wardrobe opened up to show a variety of knives and guns.
Someone was moving towards a door and said something Tony couldn’t understand. His time to rest was probably over now. Slowly he turned to look around and was honestly surprised he recognized a hospital room of sorts. Not that Tony had ever seen a room like that. It was almost as big as their apartment, way more spacious, brighter, and definitely cleaner.
“He’s a great guy. He never makes me feel bad or inferior.” He let out a sigh. Not even when Tony had nightmares and didn’t know where he was waking up. “It’ll take him some time to open up. Especially since you’re dating his best friend.”
He cracked his neck and looked up at her. The hands on her hips swung forward to hold her son’s face and she bent down and pressed a kiss to his forehead.
sorry for the delay, folks. - im95notdead
“Jones,” James greeted him with a nod.
Steve went back to work on Monday but only spent half the day in the actual office building and the first half in his room at home at his desk, going over new recruit files to get back to Jones by the end of the day.
Tony’s heart was beating even faster now, his hand that was still on Steve's cheek, trembling slightly as he shook his head.
They spoke some more until it was time to start preparing dinner. Benni was helping out tonight. He was always happy to see Pepper, especially now that he knew that he was still attending the wedding with Sarah.
“Beautiful,” he said, pressing a kiss to Tony’s shoulder.
“You know Rhodey too?” Tony asked.
“So if they ask, what are we going for this time? Bakuto? I don’t like lying to them.”
“You had me there for a second,” he said with a chuckle. “Wish I could’ve seen that smirk. Soon I will. We’re making good progress. Just a few still out there and then I’ll have ya in my arms again,” he finished with a yawn.
,” he groaned in annoyance and Steve could hear him stumbling around trying to get dressed in a hurry.
“He’ll be there in a minute, Stevie. I’m just explaining your medicine schedule,” James said. Even though the doctor had already been in earlier to explain it to them all. He turned back and looked at Tony. “So?”
“No, I’m not tired,” he said roughly, throwing Tony’s hand off of him. He moved further away, curling in on himself as much as was possible with the bandages so tight. He wanted out of them, they were too restricting and he couldn’t breathe and everything was terrible. He sat up slowly, trying to pull at them, find where they started and unwrap them. He wanted them
Tony could feel how much faster his breathing was now, how he felt hot and cold at the same time. His head started spinning. Someone had taken him the first chance they got. All the efforts to keep him safe and Tony got careless! How angry he was with himself.
“Which are you thinking?” Steve asked, looking down at the two watches in James’ hands. One was a Patek and the other a Rolex.
“I work with Steve and he has me working in his office at my own desk. I spend most of my day around Steve,” he said with a shy smile.
“Usually you don’t announce that you have a surprise for someone,” Sarah said with a smile. “Well, let’s get you to your surprise.”
“Well, allow me to alleviate your uncertainty. I had a fantastic time too, Captain.” He smirked, tilting his head to the side and Steve smiled.
“So how do we narrow that down?” Natalia asked.
As promised he ate and drank a little, making Steve drink a little too. It helped him feel less controlled and watched, even though he knew that Steve only meant well.
“Also, this guy claims to know you,” Tony added after Rhodey had finished yelling and agreed to come get Tony. “How? I don’t know, forgot to ask. One sec.” He moved the phone from his face and asked Steve how he knew Rhodey.
Since Steve had been back home, things had gone back to something Tony was willing to call normal, despite how foreign parts of it still felt. He had a job that didn’t strain him physically and he enjoyed three meals a day thanks to Sarah and her delicious cooking. She was still upset that Tony ate as little as he did but she accepted it, for now at least. Tony got to sleep next to Steve every night in his bed and his arms. Benni was doing great in school, was smiling, and had grown a lot.
“There’s someone on the third floor in one of the north-facing rooms, Romanoff and Val are bringing up the aerial ladder and backboard, can you get in there and get them out?”
“Him? Hmmmm… not so much, no.” He snorted. “Only like a fish on land misses the sea.”
“I’m not sure.”
Steve dropped his head, smiling too. He was glad Tony had not only formed his own opinion of him but one that differed so greatly from the norm. “I prefer to listen,” he said, feeling very candid. He wasn’t sure if it was all the alcohol still in his system or the special brand of happy that came from being in Tony’s presence, talking to him, but he just wanted to keep talking and then the early hour of the morning made itself known again. “I should let you sleep.”
“You were mocking your captain too. And you know, some drills could be good for you. Go join the others,” Bucky told them and they grumbled but headed outside.
, how about we cook together tonight?” Tony asked Sarah and she smiled in response.
“You know as well as I do how much effort is required to pull off something like this. Especially against us,” James said. “If this were some nobody trying to make a name for themselves there’s no way we would not have at least heard about them or their dealings. You’re almost as connected as I am.”
“I haven’t,” Steve said, sure of himself. “They’re always bad or have at least done bad.”
Clint snapped up, whirling around and dropping the clipboard in his hands. He swung out before he had even focused on who it was and Fitz barely managed to dodge the fist coming for him.
“Is it ‘cause it’s a fella?” she asked quietly and Tony’s eyes widened in shock and he pulled his hand away. “Tony, calm down,” she said and grabbed his hand. “It’s okay.” She kept saying that until he managed to calm back down a little.
“I’ll remember that,” she replied, nodding even though she was no stranger to having a child with nightmares in her home. “How are
“Alright, good. Oh, and Phil sends his love,” James told him, glad he had remembered.
No one had ever died in the diner fires—there had been injuries of people passing by on the street caught by flying glass but otherwise only the diner itself was harmed. Well, physically speaking. Every time, some family lost their livelihood but they just couldn’t understand what kind of person would have a vendetta against diner owners. Especially when none of the diners or families had anything in common other than their line of work.
“Come, there’s something I want to talk to you about,” he said and went to his room with Benni. He took his time to look at his brother and really see the changes from before. Even the way the boy walked had changed. No longer slouching or taking small, anxious steps.
He knew he was hungry and
“Knock, knock,” Natasha said at the door to Steve’s office. He pulled himself out of his concentration and swiveled around in his chair to see her and a small girl with her. He smiled. “I know you’re busy but I just brought her by for a tour and Fury said you were here.”
“I made you a cup of tea.” Tony pointed to the cup sitting on the counter.
Tony turned the book so he could see the title. Not that he had ever heard of it but he was curious what a woman like Sarah was reading. He gently touched the piece of yarn. Maria had been teaching Nella to use it to make scarves. Nella never got to finish her first scarf and Maria burned all the yarn in the house.
“Welcome back,” Steve said, happy to see him in one piece. Dugan nodded his thanks.
“I’d say ‘same’ but James is the light sleeper out of the two of us,” Clint said, a soft smile on his lips. “I have a lot of bad nights too and he always pulls me in tight, nuzzles his nose against my neck.” He laughed. “That little combo and boom! I’m sleeping like a baby.”
Steve nodded. “I promise. Let’s make the bastard regret it.” Steve picked up one of the documents and read over it for a second and then said, “Did you ever figure out what he was trying to say?”
The plan was to keep things running smoothly so as to not let anyone know that James was gone in the first place. Luckily for James, he was very rarely in the public eye anyway except for Clint’s bar and even there he always entered through the back and sat out of view, so his presence would be slightly easier to fake than Steve’s.
On Thursday the phone rang around the usual time. After his rough start in the morning —Howard had yanked him out of the bed and thrown Tony on the floor, yelling about the empty bed Peter should be using instead of curling up with his brother— he was grateful to hear Dugan's indifferent voice.
Clint nodded and grabbed the food first, pulling it over in front of them and then settling in beside Tony, their legs touching. He picked up one of the potatoes and took a bite, chewing slowly as he chose a story to share.
“Out of surgery and in his room across the hall. Thought I’d give James and Sarah some time. He’s still sedated and sleeping. How’s your pain? Do you want me to get you anything?”
Finally, Clint spoke again.
Sarah looked around once, taking James’ hand when he held it out to her and her sons’ in the other. Steve was holding Benni’s hand, too. Sarah bowed her head and said a short prayer in English, mostly giving thanks for having Tony and Benni in their lives, good health, and a delicious meal in front of them and then she lifted her head and said, “Let’s eat, lads.”
Dugan opened the car door and Steve stepped out, straightening his waistcoat and putting on his hat. He looked up at the huge building, eyed a few of James’ men who stood outside smoking and talking.
The end! Thank you to everyone who’s been on this 1940s series ride since the beginning and to everyone who leaves comments (especially you regulars, we appreciate you so much!)
Tony was stunned silent. No one had ever cooked for him. No one but Rhodey but that wasn’t the same as this. The sheer amount of effort Steve had put into this was enough to make his hands sweaty and his knees weak.
“It’s not easy,” he finally said. “I know it isn’t. So don’t feel like it has to be easy. It wasn’t for me. Or James. And the fact that it’s not easy is a testament to your character,” Steve said, hoping the words brought him some measure of comfort.
Steve snorted. “You caught me red handed. I keep my own stash locked in my office drawer. It’s why everyone has to knock before entering,” he teased, still eating rhythmically, slightly unaware of his actions. “What’s your thing then? Baby dolls?”
Steve shrugged. “It’s not like it comes up in conversation often. Think he thought you worked for
Steve didn’t move more than to reach under the covers and wrap his fingers around the gun he had at his side. One of James’ men had given it to him on James’ orders. He cocked it as quietly as possible but Dugan heard it, his eyes falling to the general area of the sound.
. But you better make it worth my time, mister.” He grinned, nudging Steve’s foot with his own. “Any plans on how to win me over?”
"Tony."
“Thank you, Edward.” Tony looked disgusted and Steve arched a questioning eyebrow. “Not a fan of gratitude?”
For a second Steve stopped when the song ended and it made Tony worry he would have to let go of Steve and go back to sitting next to him. Instead they simply continued and Tony could breathe again.
“If you scared off my unnaturally hot firefighter date, there
He knew he was tired, his body knew he was tired but somehow his brain hadn’t properly gotten the memo. And now he felt even more exhausted than when he’d first come upstairs. He thought about just going down anyway, setting himself up in a way that he could sleep on Clint’s shoulder but he got the feeling Tony wouldn’t be as open to conversation in that situation so he stayed upstairs.
Clint had paused, weighing the pros and cons of answering. He didn’t know where Tony was or James. Or even Sarah and he knew he couldn’t get up on his own, not right away. And he really didn’t want to be alone, so he’d answered.
Steve put his hands on his hips and eyed everyone at the table. “All of you, we’re running drills. Now, let’s go.”
Silently James threw them away and collected the trash by the door to be taken out later, turning to Tony. Sarah was beside him, trying to comfort him and Benni had moved a little closer but seemed hesitant.
“And, in the interest of honesty,” Clint continued, “I like that you are who you are. I think it’s, well, attractive. And really, I try to be a good guy but life and the people in it have fucked me over plenty of times. Sometimes it’s nice to see ‘em pay.” He took James’ free hand and intertwined their fingers. “Only person who should be fucking me over anyway is you, Mr Romanov.”
“Let me finish here and you take your brother and both of you get ready for bed. You should sleep.”
“What would it take for you? To... not want me around anymore?” He asked carefully.
“No, probably not.” He sighed, looking around their small room. “At least this is better than being alone. For me, anyway.”
Tony sat across from him and Steve leaned forward, grabbing his sandwich. After a bite he looked at Tony weird before remembering he wasn’t Dugan.
Steve thought back to the evening. Apart from the very beginning for a whole three minutes, he hadn’t felt awkward or uncomfortable the entire evening. Tony was easy to be around and made him laugh. He was charming and sexy and smart. He was a good kisser and he had those beautiful eyes that Steve could imagine himself getting lost in if he really wanted to.
The hood causing the darkness was removed once they reached a small room. Before Tony could take in his surroundings or even who the people were behind him, they were cutting off the ties around his wrists and then he was pushed into a room and the door was locked.
“You really think… him?” Steve tapped on one photo in particular.
She came over to Steve and rubbed a hand along his back.
“Did I miss a joke?”
Steve visibly relaxed, looking around with a different perspective now. “It’s nice.”
“Yeah,” he answered, suddenly not so sure anymore. She hadn’t known where they were going, so why wouldn’t he trust her? Pepper said something in Gaelic to him, which made him grin.
Immediately, even before menus were offered, a bottle of Dom Perignon was brought over and poured into champagne flutes for everyone at the table.
and his ears felt like they were burning.
Tony hummed in confirmation. That would give him enough time to meet up with Pepper again if he wanted to, but his priority had to be Benni. Plus, Pepper had family coming from all over and they were doing the planning before the wedding at the end of March. He knew he would miss his little brother while they were away and Pepper had more than enough to do. Steve hadn’t given away any details about where they were going and if there was going to be a phone or not. Even if there was, Tony couldn’t imagine how expensive a call overseas was going to be.
Tony sighed and rubbed his sweaty hands on his legs. “How would you even test a theory like that?” he asked, confused. Where did he come up with these things? “Why don’t you want to stay here? This one star accommodation not good enough?” he joked weakly.
He came into the kitchen, not quite fully awake and made his way to the coffee pot, turning it on when a noise caught his attention and he turned to see a man asleep on their couch.
“Peter Beniamino?”
“Looks tops, ma,” Steve said, helping Tony to sit down and then sitting beside him. Benni took what seemed to be his usual seat, scooting up happily.
“I do, as he does me but it doesn’t matter if I’m not the one he loves.”
“Well, I appreciate you telling me.”
Tony watched their interaction and took Benni by his hand.
. But he would have rather gotten a new task from Steve than sit down and rest.
?” He asked again, this time with more emotion. When? Always? How long was always? Why had he never… wait. “S-Since when? How long?”
“James told me why you were shot,” he stated simply, sitting down next to Steve’s bed. “Steve… why didn’t you tell me?” There was a lot more he wanted to ask but he knew that this was the most important question. Because it meant that James was right.
“Hi, Mrs Rogers,” Clint said, grinning up at her.
Sarah headed upstairs to find Benni who was doing some Irish language homework she had given him. She wanted his help with lunch, feeling they might need something hardy, warm, and full of love today.
But he also got bored easily, so he headed into the back to the storeroom and started cleaning it out, taking boxes and crates out to the back alley to be picked up by the sanitation workers.
Now it was James’ turn to feel the sting of truth. It didn’t hit him as harshly as it did Steve. Whereas Steve saw failure on his part to be what Tony needed, James saw it for what it was—a chance. A chance for Clint to heal. It hurt to know he wasn’t the one who could do all of the healing but he’d known going into their relationship that he wouldn’t always be the one Clint needed, not when Natalia existed, and he didn’t resent that. He was glad someone could do for Clint whatever James could not.
James took the cup back and sipped the brandy that was in it. Clint’s favorite. “No, I offered
Clint showed Benni where to scratch and watched the little boy imitate it. Lucky did his equivalent of a smile, tilting his head happily at the scratches.
mention wanting a second one to him?” Steve shook his head. “Then your overthinking means jackshit. Text him. Or better yet, call him. No, wait—I’ll do you one better. Go to his shop and ask him out like he did you at the firehouse.”
“Where’s Steve?” Benni asked Sarah when he got downstairs and found only her at the table. It was set for three and Benni wasn’t sure if she hadn’t been expecting Steve or Tony and then she asked her next question and he figured it out.
“I bought some soup. It’s loaded with all the good things all of you need to get your strength back.” Tony sat up with the help of Steve and watched him and his mother make room for everyone to sit and eat. Sarah disappeared to bring the rest of the food over to James and Clint.
“Oh, love, when I finally get
Where’s your brother? Let’s stay together.”
He leaned back again, not touching his sandwich. “Hm, alright. I’ll see you next Thursday then. Keep the number. You may go,” he told him, his scowl never leaving.
Steve and James, in turn, would take over control of Bakuto’s finances and his business. Effective immediately, they shut down his minor trafficking rings and quickly ordered the execution of all of his men that they could find. There was no telling exactly how far Bakuto’s control reached—just like how Steve had minor operations around Ireland and James in Russia—so there would always be those they missed. However, they were hoping that their quite public and unnecessarily violent ways of handling those they had captured would send a strong enough message to anyone looking to try something.
The execution was quick, precise. Tony had learned well and when he walked away, so did they. If he was done, they were done.
“Hey, Cap, you look like shite.”
“When he asked me about my age, he was surprised. Does it ever bother you? I mean, that I’m so much younger than you? Is there ever a time when you regret not being with someone older and more experienced?” It was a question he had been thinking about a lot since that day with Clint. It had been weighing heavily on his heart despite all his efforts to convince himself that Steve probably didn’t care.
It was nice having Tony beside him, the warmth and contact was soothing, and he found that for the first time since being in there, he wanted to talk but didn’t know what to say. So he stayed quiet and kept his eyes closed, letting images of James play on repeat.
The door opened and it surprised both Steve and Dugan to see Dmitri. He looked stoic and deadly as ever, the corner of his mouth twitching upward ever so slightly when he locked eyes with Dugan and then Steve.
“You’ve packed plenty and, yes, I do plan to buy a few things there for the both of us,” he said, stifling a yawn. He was tired and though it wasn’t that late yet, he wanted to sleep. He’d already done his packing earlier and now he was ready for a shower and a solid eight hours for once.
But he realized now that Tony hadn’t actually said all that much about himself. He had a few things about himself and his past but not nearly enough for him to know where to take him.
Benni was running down the street like his brother told him to, going as fast as his little legs would carry him. The air was cold and hurt his lungs and when he reached up to push his hair out of his face, he ran into a big man and almost hit the ground if it hadn’t been for the fact that the guy grabbed him.
she said, glancing up at the clock. They’d brought Steve in that morning around ten. It was almost two in the afternoon now. James would be back with Benni soon.
Despite being a little embarrassed to have just made out with James in front of the others, all he could really focus on was this good mood. Even if it was alcohol induced.
“Yeah, how do you?”
decide if you’re still interesting or not. Here, I’ll start us off. You from here?”
He looked down at his hands, turning the wedding band he still wore. Even if it wasn’t symbolic of a marriage union in the traditional sense for him, it still meant something to both of them and he knew that Natalia had probably pushed herself right in with James and Steve. That thought made him smile and comforted him. There were too many brilliant, dangerous people looking for them for Clint to let himself worry.
“Whenever you want her to. I can ask her for you,” Clint told him, smiling and Benni smiled back.
“Once you’ve put enough time between yourself and it, it’ll pop into your dreams and your head less often. And when you do see it, it won’t be as intense,” he told him slowly, measuring Tony’s expressions. “I haven’t forgotten my first but even when I’m reminded, it’s tolerable. Now.” His voice went impossibly softer. “But the difference between me and you and dealing with this is that you’ve got all of us here to help and most of us know what you’re feeling—me, Dugan and the fellas, and James w-when he’s back,” he added, tripping over his words slightly as he added it but it was no less sincere.
“My fault,” he said simply, moving to Tony’s collarbone and he bit down lightly and Tony gasped.
“Yeah, Rhodes, we are,” Sam answered, “you need us?”
He’d been sending Steve letters, love letters, some disgustingly graphic, some intimate details of Steve’s body. Things no one else could possibly know unless they’d seen him naked.
“Do you get randomly cold and then suddenly it’s too hot?”
He rolled onto his side and shut his eyes tight, willing himself to sleep.
“What does this mean for you now? You said only Dugan knows. Will you even be okay with your own men?” Tony was scared, yes, but he also needed to know. “And... what if… you’re not? Will you fight them?”
“I tell ma they’ve been disrespecting me and stick ‘em in a room with her. That’s worse than anything I could do to ‘em.” He smiled, half of his mouth pulling up. He looked up at Tony. Steve wasn’t sure he wanted to leave the house but he would if Tony wanted to—oh wait, he already had plans with Pepper, he remembered, looking back down. “What are you and Pepper up to today?”
Steve felt a warmth spread out from his stomach to his extremities at hearing Tony say his name. What he expected and what he wanted of course were two different things and the second he would do his best to keep squashed down.
“My date went well. Really well but neither of us are really the ‘go home on the first date’ types,” he said and then tilted his head to look behind Tony. “And how was
Steve looked at his hands. “You interrupt some business to come tell me this?”
When they got to the kitchen and Tony saw Steve, he was honestly surprised but also very happy. With a nod and a soft smile he greeted him before moving to help him and his mother prepare breakfast.
“Yes,” James said, looking over at Clint who was talking to Tony. “Thank you.”
Steve didn’t understand but he made a mental note to find out later. He released Tony’s arm and tried again, his voice sincere. “Thank you, Tony.” He pointed to the hand holding the money and said sternly, “
“Yes, you did, sir, but to stay?” Tony asked and smiled at the compliment for the coffee. It was strong and smooth, unlike other bitter, weak coffees. That someone like Mr Rogers appreciated it made him smile. “Can I get you anything else?”
“Phil?” James prompted.
“You too. And, I, uh,” Clint winced and turned to James. “Click that morphine for me, sweetheart?” The pain meds they had given him were wearing off and the feeling of everything was coming back in full force. He turned back to Tony. “I have a buncha questions. Remind me some time?” Clint’s eyes were nearly closed as the morphine kicked in.
“He’s dead,” Steve said quietly.
Steve and James managed to finish off their divided acquisition of Bakuto’s organization in Queens and Madame Gao was satisfied with her portion. From what Steve and James heard from their own personal spies, the remaining bosses were not bothered to see Bakuto go.
“Thank you,” he said quietly and closed his eyes. “I’m really tired. I’m sorry.”
“Howard Stark. What’s the word on him?”
“All the best.” He smiled and kissed her forehead before opening the door for her.
“That I got and not one I gave?” Tony asked to which Steve nodded. “I don’t know. Two, maybe three years? Why?”
Steve had dropped his head and Rhodey slapped a hand to his shoulder and gave him a look before walking inside.
He rolled on his side to look at Steve through heavily lidded eyes. When Steve was in a bad mood or lost in thought, his eyes looked much darker but right now, as he was still coming down and adoring Tony next to him, his eyes were bright. “Are you feeling better now?”
Tony watched him happily, leaning into the small kisses and watching him with a soft and appreciative gaze. “I love you too,” he replied, his fingers in Steve’s hair as he pulled his face against his chest and hugged him protectively. There wasn’t a lot he could do for Steve but this? This was something he knew felt good.
Tony took the envelope and nodded. There was no way of knowing what he had written and at this point Tony was honestly scared. Outside the door Pepper was talking to Dugan and apparently she had made him laugh. At least she hadn’t been grim about being sent out. She was naturally curious and a talkative person but on the way back to the store Pepper was silent and they continued working without talking about the events from earlier. Howard hadn’t even noticed how long the both of them had been gone. He could entertain the noon crowd by himself. Tony hated to see him this friendly with neighbors, chatting with them and telling jokes. Once things had calmed down, Tony gave the envelope to Howard.
He pulled out the bread roll he had tucked away under his blanket and pulled off a small piece, putting it in his mouth and chewing.
“Hey,” he said softly and Clint looked up. The dog was on the couch now, his head rested on Clint’s thigh while Clint scratched his ears.
of course we don’t have to do it. It was only a suggestion,” Sarah added. “You could always think on it for a bit first, if you’d like.”
“It’s okay. You’re safe. Steve, look at me,” Tony said, gently rubbing over his forearm and making Steve turn to him.
is for
The dog tags around James’ neck knocked against each other with a soft clack as he sat up further. He grabbed them with one hand and pulled back, pressing his lips to the tags but looking at Clint. “I’m never letting you out of my sight again, you hear me? I don’t give a rat’s ass how much you protest.”
“Hey, Tony. Busy?”
The worst part of this all was the fact that someone somewhere might be targeting Tony. That thought was driving Steve crazy, just playing over and over in the back of his head, making Steve’s hand twitch like he wanted to grab his gun. He knew James was feeling the same way. He could hear it in his voice and in his plans that James was just as protective of Clint and would do whatever it took to keep him safe, so Steve could understand James’ reasoning for keeping it to himself. Didn’t mean he liked it, but he understood. He would do the same if it meant keeping Tony safe.
“I would like to visit my mother’s grave, if that’s okay with you.”
They had discussed a lot actually. Steve spoke about living with Sam and Bucky and his relationship with the two of them. He talked about growing up in Brooklyn and his decision to go into firefighting. He talked about working with Rhodey after Tony had asked what he was like at work.
Tony nodded, nuzzling his face into the fabric of Steve’s clothes. “Do you think they’ll let me shower? And brush my teeth?” Those were logical and rational thoughts, things he knew were part of his routine, but if he was completely honest, he didn’t care about any of it. Too long he had been away from Steve. “What about you? Are you okay? Did they hurt you?”
Now he inhaled sharply through his nose and the smell was all wrong. Well, it wasn’t wrong but it was different. No longer the sharp smell of concrete and disinfectant. Now the smell was cleaner, softer. He opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling. It wasn’t the hard, grey concrete anymore but a regular room.
Tony almost laughed at it and pressed the letter above his heart. Mr Rogers was threatening his father over what he had done to him.
“Your brother. What’s his name again?”
Steve kept his thoughts and his reactions to himself for the moment and carried on to his next topic. He took a bite of his sandwich, gently dabbing at his mouth with the napkin provided. He eyed Pepper, jerking his head in her direction. “You two going steady?”
“Tony’s gone,” Steve said, his voice tight and James wasn’t sure exactly what emotion it was that he could hear in Steve’s voice but he knew what it felt like. It felt like absolute, undiluted dread. James almost felt like he was going to be sick from it. The man who took them would not be getting off easy. There would be no quick death. He wouldn’t even be as lucky as Howard. His death would be slow, agonizing and, as long as James was in control, it would go on and on and on.
“Well,
Behind him was Winter, though he faded into the background easily.
“He was right then and he still is. How is James by the way?”
“Right, yeah, I remember him. That was gross. You guys were so overly sexual. I’m glad that ended. But again, that was, what? Last year? Come on, Steve.”
“I am good with a gun but knives are my specialty. I’m guessing a close range kill isn’t what you’re going for,” James said easily and Steve glared at him for not choosing his words more carefully.
Steve nodded, pleased with that response. “Happy to hear it.” He turned, glancing back at Tony to follow. “One more room and if we take any more time getting there, she might be upset.” But there was a smile on his face as they headed for the kitchen.
“I’m not bad with—”
when I apologized.”
“Right away?” Tony asked, having given the gun back to Steve, who then looked to James and James shrugged in response. Tony looked down at himself. He was still in his suit from work. It would be the first time since Maria’s funeral that Howard would see Tony in a suit. And it would be his last time too. It would also be the last time Tony would ever have to see Howard. The sooner he got that done, the sooner he could get over it.
There was more discussion of territory and James inquired of the actual purity of Gao’s red snake heroin, as she called it, and she offered to send him off with some that she pulled out of her pocket in a tiny packet. James took it and handed it to Dmitri without a word.
“Yes, why?”
“Because it is. A little gift from her today.”
When he woke up he felt quite disoriented. His head was hurting and his throat was dry. If he was totally honest he barely remembered the drive back, walking to the house or any of it. Tony got up and folded the blanket neatly. It was already dark outside but that didn’t have to mean anything since it was still the middle of winter. While watching the streets outside Tony got lost in his thoughts again, barely hearing a knock on his door.
He got out of bed and wrapped himself in a house robe, opening the door carefully and heading out into the hall. He was staying at James’ for the first time in years. In fact, they were all at James’. Bakuto seemed to communicate via James’ phone and no one wanted to take the risk of traveling between the two places and befalling the same fate as Tony and Clint.
Tony sat up, not wanting to lie around impolitely around Steve.
“Hm,” Clint hummed, “it’ll be interesting to get to know more of that side of him.”
She wrapped her arms around his neck as loosely as possible, putting no weight on him to hug him. “I was so worried.” She kissed the side of his head and then pulled back. “I’m so glad you’re alright. And yes, Bakuto has been handled. He won’t be going anywhere.”
“I love you, too.”
“Tony, I don’t know. She’s...I don’t know if I can leave her yet.”
“Wow.” Tony grins down at the image. “This is…”
He gives up on the door, knowing his attempts at breaking free would fail. Maybe if the circumstances were different he’d be able to get out. The serum running through his veins gave him a superhuman strength. He wouldn’t dare break down this door now, not when he was trying to keep his pup safe.
Tony’s not the only one excited for the new arrival. The team has showed their excitement in various ways, mostly with the amount of gifts they’ve been showering. His son wasn’t even born yet and already he was being spoiled.
“Yeah.” Tony pushes himself away from the island and steps toward Steve until they’re standing beside each other. Steve smiles softly at him and hands him the mug. “Thanks.”
“I think I have to push,” Steve says, a little unsurely. The next contraction hits, followed by pressure between his legs. Steve gives into the urge and bears down, grunting softly from the strain. “Tony, I’m...I’m pushing. Get Bruce.”
A small whimper captures Steve’s attention and he glances up, his eyes landing on the young pup held in James’ arms.
“Steve,” Bruce acknowledges the omega. “How far along are you?” He asks, coming closer to begin the exam.
“You didn’t tell me enough. Tony, who is he? I didn’t even know you were romantically involved and having a pup.”
“I will.”
Tony grumbles to himself. “Alright! Jesus, you can be so annoying. Fine fine. Where is he?”
“I’ll find the best for you and our pups.”
Tony chokes back a sob, the sound reaching the ears around him. He gets up quickly from the chair, grateful when he’s not followed. He stops once he reaches the elevators and he leans against the wall, releasing the emotions he’s had pent up inside. He buries his face into his hands, muffling the sobs. His body shakes, his legs can’t hold him up anymore and he slides down the wall until he’s hitting the floor.
Tony was scared. He was a coward and he had no problem admitting that. He didn’t want to bring a helpless kid into the world and fuck up their life like his father had done to his. Tony suffered from the hands of his father. He didn’t want that for his children. They deserved better.
“On the bed.”
Peter snaps out of it and glances up at his papa. “S-sorry. I’m just a little tired.”
“I’ve been through worse,” Steve replies and glances toward the window again. He has a few questions lined up, but he can’t bring himself to ask them. Maybe it was because he was afraid to know the answers. But there was one he needed answered. “Where are we going?” He asks, turning back to Tony.
Peter is gently placed down in the middle of the large bed. He stirs in his sleep and lets out a small yawn. Steve heads to the bathroom to get a washcloth to clean his son’s face. He’s not surprised when he returns to find Tony curled up around Peter.
This time Tony looks at him and sighs sadly. “The boy’s are already asleep.”
“Hey, how did you get in?” Tony questions, even though he knows he won’t get an answer. Dodger barks, and that’s when he realizes the sound is different. “Hey, buddy what’s wrong?”
Before Steve can form any words, his pups are rushing toward him to welcome him with hugs and kisses. Steve smiles and kneels down to properly greet them.
“I don’t like monsters,” Peter whimpers and hugs his bear tighter.
“Is this him?” Tony shows Steve the screen. “Is this Alpha?”
He gags and cups his mouth before he’s rushing out of the room, no longer able to handle the sounds Tony was making.
He doesn’t know all the details, but he knows enough. He knows about the fallout his parents had and the big decision his papa made to keep him and raise him. He knows that his dad is Iron Man and is some billionaire hotshot that resides in Manhattan. He knows his dad had walked out on them and never bothered to even try and be a dad.
“Maybe I want her to be like you. She’ll definitely have your brains, your eyes.”
“I didn’t even know I had a kid, Barton. How is that my fault?”
“You killed him!”
Morgan smiles and starts bouncing happily again.
But now, as Tony presents the ring and a promise to love him for the rest of his life, Steve wants it. He’s never wanted it more.
“He didn’t mean it.”
“T-Tony!” Steve sobs. “I can’t..I can’t.”
“I’m changing.”
“Really? You didn’t tell dad?”
“He’s not Iron Man anymore,” Peter reminds and pulls out his AP Chemistry book to slip into his backpack. He shuts the locker door a little harder than he means to. “He’s just...my dad.”
“It’s okay. I mean, you have every right to be. Having a baby is...well, you know how it is. This was the last thing we expected.”
“Stop being dramatic.” Natasha slaps him playfully on the shoulder. “Everyone loves you. Even if you can be stubborn sometimes.”
The door to the master bedroom is slightly ajar. Tony stops when he comes to it, his stomach twisting into knots. He’s almost afraid of what he’s going to find once he pushes the door open. He slowly presses the door forward. Then he sees him.
Morgan peers up at him, drawn to the familiar voice. She keeps her eyes trained on his face while he talks to her.
Tony steps in, stretching out his fingers to brush them along Morgan’s cheek. She reacts positively to his touch, calming down instantly and falling back asleep. Tony continues to stroke her face.
“So what brings you here?” Tony jumps right in.
“Tony, it’s okay. Let me in please.”
“Not you, just me. I can still train you and this place will always be open, but maybe we could...take some time off.”
Bucky squeezes Sam’s hand tightly, fighting back the urge to get up and let his husband handle the rest of the conversation. He can’t help but feel he’s the reason why Peter wants to leave. He pushed his nephew away.
“Not that. I’m sorry I can’t be...good enough for you. I thought I was better and...and I’m still destroying things.”
“Tony, I don’t understand.”
“Yeah. I have to go.”
Nat smiles. “Yes. We'll take good care of you and your son.”
Tony gives a small shrug in response. He didn’t mind getting fucked every once and awhile, but he preferred the fucking. The sounds Steve made always went straight to his cock. And the feel of being inside of him was the most incredible feeling.
“Come here, sweetheart.”
“Yeah. I know you’re not perfect. And I know Peter and Harley need you.”
“Can you help me up?” Steve asks and Sam pulls him to his feet.
“We’re okay now. No one’s ever going to hurt you.”
Natasha is able to read his mind. “Clint’s on his way and the lovebirds went to get some coffee. I was going to wait to hold him until you woke up but I couldn’t help myself.”
Tony slumps against the wall and takes a moment to compose himself. He can feel everyone staring at him, but he can’t bring himself to meet their gaze.
“I did.” Tony nods. “But it was technically in the middle of the street.”
There’s a moment of hesitation before Steve is answering the question. “No.”
Tony grumbles some kind of response and walks away to look at another part of the store. Steve sighs and shakes his head. He couldn’t wait for the mood swings to pass.
“Don’t,” Sam warns. “He’s fine.”
“Come on,” Tony gently taps Steve’s thigh and the omega pulls himself to his feet. Tony follows and takes his hand, leading him away from the living room and up the stairs. “J, get the lights. Thanks, buddy!” He calls out.
“Good, good. Keep pushing. Big push now.”
“Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Stark.”
Tony nods. “Got it.”
“You’d think they’ve never seen muffins before,” Pepper chuckles and returns to Steve’s side.
“I’m sure Mr. Stark will need a nudge. Wouldn’t hurt to try.”
“And we know for sure they’re the good guys?”
“Tony,” Steve groans and pushes Tony’s hands away. “It’s nothing. It’s not that okay? I can’t...I just can’t.”
Lunch is only slightly better. Peter doesn’t eat, picking at the fries and sandwich he regrets getting. Ned is the only one participating in their conversation, but that’s fine. Peter enjoys hearing him talk.
Another try.
Tony lowers his gun and steps into the elevator, grimacing at the mess beneath his feet.
“I need a shower.”
“Fine.” Steve steals a glance at his shoulder, wincing when he brushes it with his fingers. The blood is flowing, but it’s not enough to send him into a panic. “I’ll live. Where are you now? I’m coming-”
“Pete!” Steve calls out. The scream he heard had belonged to Harley but it was usually Peter behind the screams. He loved crawling the walls and hanging down to scare his older brother. Raising a son with enhanced powers wasn’t easy but they were managing. Harley hadn’t shown any signs of the serum affecting him but that didn’t mean a watchful eye wasn’t on him. It took two years for Peter’s powers to become noticeable.
“Yeah.” Tony nods and he takes the spot beside Steve. “Thanks. How are you feeling?”
His absence is immediately noticed. Morgan squirms in Tony’s arms, turning her head in search of Steve. She begins to cry.
But the other half of him wants his dad to tag along. It’s been years since the team has been together and deep down Peter yearns for them to reconnect and they become a real family.
“No. I have Harley. I told him we’d go to the park.”
Hi! I swear I’m trying to update my stories but it’s been so hard lately. But I won’t give up! I hope you all enjoy this chapter 😊
He doesn’t leave the compound entirely, but he excuses himself away from the group and down the stairs Peter had come up from earlier. He doesn’t follow the stairs to the bottom level, and instead takes a few down before lowering himself onto one of the steps.
The kiss breaks, giving Steve a moment of relief. But only just a moment.
“Jarvis helped me order the decorations and then I put them up last night.”
There’s a moment of silence before the sound of little feet running down the stairs can be heard. Steve turns right when an upset Harley rushes into the room. His golden curls bounce with each step, and his blue eyes are filled with tears.
“Yeah.” Steve agrees with another yawn. His eyes shut again and he mumbles sleepily, “He’s a good dog.”
“Yeah. He threw a fit because I told him to pick up his toys. Is he still pouting?”
“Oh. But I have Google.”
Steve mutters a quick prayer before following after his husband.
His friends try to assure him that he didn’t need Tony, and maybe that was true. Why should he continue to waste his time on someone who couldn’t even spare a moment of theirs? It hurt and would probably ache for some time, but enough was enough.
“Hold on, pal.”
“Until you’re ready enough to be out there. Pete, being an Avenger isn’t easy.”
“Park!” Harley claps his hands excitedly.
A soft knock on the door interrupts and Steve pulls away, settling his teary eyes on the doctor. Bruce smiles softly and steps into the room.
Peter is up a few hours later, his cries coming through the baby monitor and alerting Steve. At the sound of his son’s cries, Steve is jumping out of bed to comfort him.
“Tony, it’s me. But I guess you knew that already,” Steve’s voice fills the room, “I know I call a lot, but I figured another try wouldn’t hurt. I don’t know if you’ve heard my other messages. I’m hoping you have. This one is different. I’m not going to beg you to come back. You chose to leave and I respect your choice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not just any sunglasses,” Tony explains and opens the case. He takes out the pair and hands them to Peter. “Put them on.”
That warm smile is instantly back. “Really? You’re going through with it?”
And that’s what Peter needs to come to terms with.
Steve finishes up and emerges from the bathroom. He climbs into bed and curls up beside Tony, a content sigh leaving his lips. Tony leans down to kiss the top of Steve’s head.
“Yes,” Tony says with a nod of his head. “Let’s get married.
“Brooklyn.”
“You can sit down I guess,” Peter says, gesturing to his bed. Flash glances around the room, silently judging it just like Peter knew he would.
Just like Tony feared, the question is difficult to answer. He could probably go on for hours about what he thought of Steve. For years he had been crazy about him.
“You already are,” Steve chuckles and places a kiss on Tony's head. Tony hums in response and snuggles closer to Steve, a sigh of content leaving him.
Happy runs back into the bedroom. Steve has never seen him so terrified. Usually the beta came off as tough and fearless.
“Oh trust me, darling, you are. Best foot massage of my life. And the sex was good too, not gonna lie. Or maybe I’m just that fucking horny. Is that a thing?”
Nathanial was the next option, which was Natasha's idea. Steve considered it until Clint stole it to name his unborn son. That was fine. Natasha was his friend first.
“How nice?”
“Maybe. I don’t care about being famous or whatever. I just want to be me,” Steve says.
“Why? Maybe I should. He’s just a kid and the world is dangerous. Maybe it’s a good thing we lost ours.”
Tony takes Steve into one of the conference rooms. It’s smaller than the one he uses for big important meetings, but it would do for now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why is this a joke! You don’t even know that guy!” Happy hisses and gestures toward the door.
“Ah okay. Is that why you’re here? You need a break?”
“I love it.” Steve smiles and flips through the blank book, already imagining the pictures he’s going to fill it with. “I thought my art days were a thing of the past.”
“Yes. The jet is nearing the landing pad.”
The first thing he does is check on his pups. Both Peter and Sarah are sleeping peacefully, both still tucked under their blankets and cuddling their favorite stuffed animal. Steve smiles at the scene before shutting the door halfway and moving on to the next room.
“He said it’s important.”
“Is he still asleep, J?” Tony asks after some time has passed. It must be well into the evening by now.
“The news. Yeah. I didn’t know then. I was...busy.”
“Fine! Can I go now?”
“Do you want a raise?” Tony asks and he pulls himself to his feet. “I can do that. Maybe a new position too.”
He cuddles his son close and kisses the top of his head, purposely letting his lips linger a little longer. Peter purrs softly.
Tony is waiting for him in their bedroom, sitting on the edge of the bed. He’s working on his tablet, but Steve knows it’s just a distraction. Tony peers up when he senses Steve’s presence and lays the tablet to the side.
“He’s doing great. I think you’re going to have a little fighter on your hands.”
“Uh I...I like to build computers.”
Tony is in the nursery when Steve returns, organizing their son’s belongings and placing a few items into an overnight bag. Steve steps into the room, brows furrowing slightly.
“What? But, Tony, I’m supposed to-”
“What did I do?”
Tony sighs. He wants nothing more than for Steve to stop blaming himself. It wasn’t Steve’s fault that the baby had died. But Tony doesn’t tell him the truth. He never could.
“True. I’ll tell you what, I’ll come by...soon.”
his alpha. They were never bonded.”
“Sure! Whatever you want. Maybe chocolate chip this time?”
“No. Don’t apologize. Don’t you ever apologize. I screwed up. You did nothing wrong, honey. It was me and I’m sorry. I don’t ever want to hurt you again. I’d never forgive myself if I let you slip away. I promised to protect you and Pete and I’m keeping my word. Please forgive me, Steve. Please.”
“Steve?” Tony shakes him gently, doing his best to keep any panic out of his tone. He can’t freak out. It would only scare the omega. “Steve, wake up?”
“Nuh-uh.” Steve waggles the spoon at her. “This is mine. You woke the baby.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“This is it. Steve, how did you want to do this? Does this position work?”
Steve continues to speak to her in a soft tone and slowly rocks her in his arms.
Steve frowns and glances down at his blood covered hands and the mess he’s created in the room. He peers up at his mate again. “Tony...Tony, I’m sorry. I didn’t-”
I feel so terrible for Peter. He thought he could trust Tony and have a relationship with him. At least he still has the rest of his family.
Five years later
“I don’t like brothers! I want a sister!”
“We can talk in the morning,” Natasha says and she kisses him goodnight.
He can hear her sigh on the other end. “Have you talked to Steve?”
But he would help Steve. He’d do anything to get him back, to make him happy again. He’d give Steve hope.
Bucky takes a deep breath to calm himself. “I think I’m good now.”
“Well yeah but...not now! He’s supposed to be here at 6!” Bucky cries.
“Happy’s gonna pick you up a few things. I know you must be uncomfortable,” Tony says, eyes trailing over the worn out clothes Steve was currently in. It’s not just his attire that Tony is bothered by. He didn’t like the bruises decorating Steve’s face.
It’s bittersweet. He’s gathered with his friends to celebrate the birth of his son, but without Tony by his side, Steve’s mood dampens. Tony should be here for it all. He had missed the first appointment, the gender reveal, and now the baby shower. Though time was running out until Steve welcomed his son, he held onto hope that Tony would come back and they’d be together when their baby entered the world.
“I know,” Peter smiles and he glances back at the photo, “it was one of his favorite places. I think that’s why we went so much. Did you guys ever go?”
“Yeah. Just...didn’t sleep well.”
“There has to be something else. I-I can’t. I can’t do that to you. Let’s talk this through okay?”
“So you’ll show up to this but miss the funeral? Typical.”
“For...if you don’t want them to call you that then-”
He needs to fight back. He can’t let this happen again. The first time was brutal, a nightmare. He couldn’t suffer through it again.
“What kind of pain? Do I need to go?” Tony is already jumping to his feet. He stops when Steve assures him he’s fine. “Are you sure? Is this it?”
“Ah.”
He doesn’t bother reaching out to Tony again. It was clear that Tony wanted no part in another mission or their son’s life. History was repeating itself.
But Peter wasn’t ready to give up. His papa always taught him to keep fighting. When the bullies would knock him down and Peter would come home crying, it was his papa comforting him and reminding him that he was strong and to never allow anyone to knock him down. His papa never backed down, especially when he was determined. And Peter was determined to have a relationship with his dad.
“I hate that cat,” Sam narrows his eyes at the little cockblocker.
Happy narrows his eyes and shrugs Tony off. “You bet you do. I won’t let anyone hurt you. Even…” The beta tips his head in the directions of the stairs.
At the sound of his name Tony is peering up. Their eyes connect for only a second before Tony is glancing back down at the device in his lap. “Hey,” he greets. “How’d you sleep?”
Steve nods sheepishly. “Sorry.”
He’s not alone this time. Sarah is in his arms and James is walking obediently behind him with Harley’s hand held tightly in his own. Tony smiles at the sight of his little family. They were perfect.
“Hey, Pete.”
The plan goes south fast. As soon as the jet comes to a stop, Peter assumes they’ve landed, and he gives himself a few moments before stepping out of his hiding spot. He didn’t want to be seen just yet.
Steve releases another chuckle and glances over his shoulder, his eyes scanning over the festive streamers Tony has just finished putting up.
“Can I be honest?”
Steve listens intently to the others speak about their traumatic experiences. It’s sad to hear about the abuse they’ve been through. Steve could relate. He knew what it was like to be abused by not only alphas, but the rest of the world.
He shuts the stove off. He glances at the knife he left on the counter, and a thought crosses his mind. He shakes his head quickly at that thought.
Tony scoots closer until he’s close enough to wrap Steve in his arms. Morgan doesn’t protest from the closeness, and she coos in response. She must miss having both of them like this.
“I-I don’t want to. Believe me if I could I’d stay here, but I can’t. I need help, Tony,” Steve cups Tony’s face, smoothing his thumbs over each cheek. “I know you did your best, and it means so much to me, but this is something I have to do.”
Things were starting to look up.
“It’s fine,” Steve tries to assure, but he knows he’s failing. Tony knew him so well.
“Hey, J,” Tony says, his hand still on the spider. “Maybe I am feeling a little homesick.”
“Sorry,” Steve sniffs and wipes at his eyes. Dr. Strange offers him a tissue and he gratefully accepts it.
“Blue’s nice but-” Tony pauses and with his free hand, plays with the silky tie. “-red is my favorite color.”
“Darling, we’re not fighting. I think we’ve done enough of that already.” Tony smiles and brings Steve in for a kiss. Steve instantly relaxes and kisses back. “Better?” Tony asks once they break apart.
Steve doesn’t protest this time and he allows Tony to lead him back to their bedroom. The moment Steve’s head hits the pillow, he’s drifting off to sleep. Tony curls up beside him, making sure this time to wait for Steve’s permission to touch him. He’s granted that consent and he smiles.
Tony gives the center one last look, then he slips on his sunglasses and drives away.
“I got out to help-”
“Get him cleaned up. It’s time for him to mate again.”
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
The air around them is different; it’s tinged sour with the rage the alpha gives off. Steve can’t help but cower in fear. He knew what angry alphas led to.
“Whoa, what’s the rush?” Steve asks, one brow raising.
“Hey, I’m still here,” Bucky frowns, clearly offended.
“No. Thanks, buddy.”
“You already do.”
It’s not just Steve excited about the news. The whole team is happy and looking forward to the new family member. Natasha is keeping her fingers crossed that they have a girl.
“He’ll be fine out here,” Steve assures and he beckons for Tony to follow.
“I’m sorry. I have a lot on my mind. Trust me a party was the last thing on it. Steve’s just happy now and he wanted to do this. And I promised after it’s over I’ll fly back and do whatever you need me to do.”
“Please?” Steve’s begging is what snaps Tony from thoughts, and he peers in his husband’s direction, finding fresh tears streaming down his face.
“I love you, too.”
“You’re damn right. But that’s beside the point. Remember our therapy project?”
It takes a few more solid pushes until the head is born and cupped in his palm. Steve slowly removes the hand he has over his mouth, a shaky laugh leaving him when he feels his pup’s head of soft hair. The next contraction is already building and with a groan, Steve pushes, this time a little harder.
“What happened? Did the jet malfunction? I knew I should’ve performed another diagnostic-”
Pepper pulls back slightly to stare into his glistening eyes. “Yes. I know it and I know Tony knows it too. He’s lucky to have you.”
Tony jumps up and glances over his shoulder at the piece of furniture. “Sorry,” he mutters and sits down on the sofa across from Natasha. “I didn’t know.”
“It’s okay.” Peter hugs his dad tighter. “I’m just glad you made it.”
Tony smiles. “You’d totally miss me.”
Okay so let me start off by saying that I had a few different ideas for my alternate ending, but a while back one of my wonderful readers brought up Tahiti and I couldn’t help but want to know what it was ( I didn’t watch Agents of Shield 😬) But then I liked the idea of a fallen Avenger coming back to life and I just had to take a stab at it. Now mind you I never watched the show and kind of went off what I researched. I kept things vague because well…I don’t know what I’m doing lol not really. But I didn’t want Steve dead…especially when my brain came up with a sequel of sorts. We’ll see if I can write a follow up 😆 I mean I have to, right? Steve is alive and everyone needs to know about it. Especially Tony and Peter.
The omega rushes toward his mate, dropping down beside him and cupping his face. “Tony,” he whispers, his fingers brushing away the dark strands that have fallen in the alpha’s face.
“We’ll visit all the time,” Tony promises and Steve smiles.
Natasha sighs sadly and pulls back so that their eyes can meet. “Let’s talk inside.”
“A three-dimensional image. Jarvis can do more than show you what the baby looks like. J?”
“It’s not a problem. Is there anything else you’d like me to do?”
That feeling returns and so does the sound of Peter’s cries. Steve is out of bed in an instant.
After Peter’s exam, Steve takes him in his arms and works on calming his baby down. Peter senses comfort almost immediately and his wails soon die down until they’re little whimpers and hiccups.
The door to the training room opens and Sam steps inside. Judging by the look on his face, Steve knows he’s needed. Peter must notice too because he sighs sadly.
“Honey, let me help you.”
Sam doesn’t squeeze his hand this time, but instead brings it up to his lips and places a soft kiss to Bucky’s knuckles.
, Tony has to remind himself. Steve is always reminding him, but lately he’s been too distracted preparing for their son’s arrival. Tony needs that assurance. But it won’t do any good. He’d still continue to poison his unborn son.
Tony lets out a sigh. “Fine. He’ll be fine. Oh before you go,” Tony says, and he pulls out his wallet and hands Peter a wad of hundreds.
Steve smiles. “Sounds good.”
Peter frowns. “Really? You don’t want to know my name. What if I’m some psychotic stalker?”
I finally got around to updating this one! I swear I haven’t forgotten about it! Also sorry that it’s not the greatest 😞 Hope you all enjoy it!
Steve sighs when he hears the sounds and contemplates running back into the bathroom to help, but he backs off, not wanting to come off as smothering. But he purposely lingers nearby in case his baby needs him.
“I need to be there, don’t I?”
“Kid-”
“How’s the training going?” Sam asks to break the tension in the room.
“Should I not trust you?” Tony asks and he takes his hands off Steve’s face, only for the omega to take them and squeeze them gently.
Harley decides he’s done napping and he stirs, small whimpers leaving his pouty lips. Steve jumps up to his feet to get to him, but Natasha is sending him a reassuring smile and calming down the newborn.
And then Steve does, their eyes locking again.
Peter sits up straight and shoots his dad a frown. “No. You said you quit.”
Peter stirs when Tony gently shakes him awake.
It’s not until they’re halfway into the movie does Steve emit a soft gasp. Peter is too engrossed in the cartoon to acknowledge the sound, but Tony hears it and sends his husband a worried look. Steve is still focusing on the movie, unaware of the fact that Tony is watching him closely. Steve’s face twists in discomfort and he wraps an arm around his belly.
Pepper places a hand on his shoulder and rubs the spot soothingly. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I wish I knew what to say to make it better.”
“He does, doesn’t he? Fine. Send an invite to Pepper and Happy. Oh and Bruce. I’m sure he’d want to come.”
“You are now. Pete’s getting nauseous.”
Peter had been thrilled when he learned the baby was a boy; he was finally getting the little brother he always wanted, and it was obvious from the smile he wore and the glint in his eye that he was happy. Steve and Tony were, too. Maybe even more so than their son.
“Why? Because we fucked that one time or because you actually think I’m a good person? I’m gonna go with the first one.”
Steve leans forward to press his nose against the alpha’s scent gland. “Okay.”
Peter nods. He honestly couldn’t agree more. He was ashamed to have slept with his enemy. Everyone knew how he felt about Flash and if it was revealed that they slept together, then Peter’s life would be even more hellish.
Ned is excited when Happy pulls up to the front of the school in the black car. Ned’s been in this car enough times that getting excited over it should be a thing of the past, but this was Ned and he was always going to be excitable.
Morgan doesn’t bother sticking around. It was clear Harley was going to take away the attention she desperately craved.
“Still do.” Steve gestures to the small helping Tony has served himself. Tony only shrugs.
The photo is of them a few years ago during one of their annual trips to DisneyWorld. Both are smiling brightly and wearing their Mickey Mouse hats. Peter smiles, the memory of them still fresh in his mind. They used to go every chance they got, but eventually it got harder and harder to attend the Happiest Place On Earth.
Tony is ready to ask again but then Peter is continuing.
They break apart, both panting.
“Fine, for the most part. Your daughter decided she wants out.”
“You don’t have to hold him anymore. The doctor can take him.”
“I just mean that he’s looking to you now. You’re all he has left.”
The day he’s supposed to leave starts off wrong from the start. He’s physically drained despite the amount of time he spent in bed. Lately he has been falling asleep earlier. He wonders if it’s because Tony’s schedule has changed and he can’t avoid curling up with his husband. It was about time they started getting enough sleep. So then why was he still tired?
“Wow,” Tony says and Peter peers up at him, expecting the worst. He’s surprised to find a small grin on his dad’s face. “I’m not mad by the way. Just...shocked. You don’t usually lash out, do you?”
“He’s asleep,” Steve says, coming down the stairs. He had helped put Peter down for a nap. Tony expects him to leave now, only to find that Steve lingers awkwardly in the living room.
Tony pauses zipping up his bags to peer up at his mate. “It’s a bad idea, huh? I’ve already put so much on her and...I don’t know. I’ll talk to her about it.”
“Tony,” Natasha says, continuing with their conversation now that Morgan is calm and drifting off to sleep. “I think it’s time you had someone else intervene. He needs someone to talk to, someone who’s not us or you. He needs help.”
“Do you need anything? More water?” Steve’s well aware of the fact that he’s smothering Tony and he hates to admit that this wasn’t going to be the first or last time. It would probably get worse from here on out. Tony was in a delicate state and required immense pampering.
Hi! So trying to find time to write is a lot harder than I thought. I’m struggling, guys! 😭 I feel terrible when I don’t update but I’m happy to say I got a chapter done! I’m not sure how my other stories are going to go. I might take a break from a few just until I can figure out a schedule. Thank you for being so understanding! ❤️❤️❤️
Steve doesn’t respond, too busy concentrating on breathing through the next round of contractions. They’re not as painful as the ones he experienced before the baby arrived, but they weren’t comfortable either. His body is urging him to push and with a soft grunt he bears down.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures again.
This time Steve does look up at him. “You weren’t supposed to remember. You’re only supposed to mate with me and produce a pup. I’m only meant to be bred. I always have been. You were the chosen alpha.”
Steve’s face heats up and he pushes Tony’s hand away. “A little yeah. But it’s nothing. I already told you.”
Steve gasps suddenly and Tony pulls back, his eyes full of concern.
“You’re okay, squirt. Daddy’s gonna make you feel better alright? That’s what daddies are for.” Tony brings his son closer, pressing his lips against Peter’s head, inhaling the familiar baby scent mixed with lavender.
“Whoa, whoa. Kiddo-” Tony tries to calm his son, only for Peter to push him away.
“Be honest. Do you want to get married?”
“That’s not scary!” Peter giggles at the puppy dressed as a pumpkin.
“Come on. Dinner’s ready.”
It was better but still not enough.
He felt disgusting in his own skin. Any ounce of confidence he ever had vanished into thin air, almost as if it was never there to begin with. He wondered how his husband could even stand the sight of him.
“There was an...incident...back at the base. The...the alpha that...he...he…” Steve pauses to take a breath, hating how shaky it comes out. He
Steve was in control now.
Tony removes his fingers, giving the omega a break to calm down and catch his breath. Steve is panting harshly, his body covered in a sheen of sweat and his own slick. His cock is still hard and leaking.
He decides to keep what he’s learned to himself. It won’t be easy and it would probably drive him insane, but it was too risky to share. There were some things that were better left unsaid. Peter wished he had been spared.
“Well maybe now I am. I don’t know.”
Peter winces and rubs at the aching spot, whimpering when the muscles contract. He leans back against the wall and breathes through it, his eyes falling shut.
“Yep.” Steve nods. “Spider-Man needs a suit, right?”
Tony was a wonderful partner and an even better father. He’d make an amazing husband, Steve was sure of it.
Steve and Peter moved into Tony’s private quarters while Tony recovered. The room Tony had been working on for Peter was now complete; Steve helped finish it while Tony rested. The last thing he wanted was Tony getting out of bed and hurting himself again.
The floors tremble again and the walls crumble, dust and debris filling the space. Steve moves quickly to grab the weapons, but another wave comes through and he sways.
“It doesn’t,” Peter says. “It’s yours. I want you to have it.”
He stutters put a reply, only to be silenced when his dad cuts him off. “And don’t deny it or give me some bullshit story. What is this?”
Steve lets out a sigh and leans back against the couch, digging the heels of his hands in his eyes. “I’m sorry. I know you tried. God, Tony I’m so sorry.”
It’s tempting to cross the room and make a drink at the bar, but he holds off. He needs to be sober. He needs to get better.
“It’s okay. You’re here now. I’m going to help you. I promise.”
“Okay.” Steve nods, a little unsure. His eyes land on the pizza that was forgotten. “Guess I kinda ruined dinner, huh?”
He would do anything for his son.
“Yeah well…”
“You didn’t have to do this,” Steve says, his way of trying to thank the pair for spending time with his children. They were still strangers after all.
Steve glares at the beta.
Steve chuckles on the other end. “Trust me, you won’t.”
The fingers in his hair cease their movement and Peter knows. He takes a shaky breath and lifts his head.
“Sleep in, honey,” Tony whispers. “I got her.”
“Nope.” Tony finally has one shoe on. “See? I got this. Are they almost here?”
Sorry! Hope you enjoy it anyway!
“Is it because they’re too scary?”
“Please? I’m sorry. I didn’t think he’d actually go. I wasn’t in the right state of mind. I was just trying to help.”
Steve quickly undresses, removing the rest of his clothing and letting them join Tony’s crumpled ones on the floor. Tony takes a moment to admire the perfect body beneath him. Steve never failed to take his breath away. He was absolutely stunning.
“Easy, Nat,” Sam steps in, making sure to lay a hand over Bucky’s chest. He’s still unsure about what his husband will do next, but he’s not afraid to put himself between Bucky and his friends. He’d be the only one to calm Bucky if he needed to.
“Kid, come on. I’m gonna get my ass kicked if I go in.”
“Yeah...I think so. I’m freaked out but...I promised I’d be there and now that I know it’s mine...I have to be. I want to be.”
“I know.”
“Yeah. It’s how I get around so…”
“It’s not just you. I’m thinking about him, too.”
Tony is currently lying on the exam bed in the middle of the room, one arm folded and resting behind his head. He keeps his gaze up, focusing on the ceiling above him and taking slow, careful breaths. He places one hand over his belly, fighting back the urge to vomit. There should be no reason for him to be on the verge of vomiting again when he had spent a good portion of his morning beside the toilet.
Steve smiles and comes over to take his son into his arms. “Guess he did take after me, huh?”
“It’s rough.”
I'm on a roll with this story! I've had this story idea in my head for a while, so maybe that's it. Anyway, this chapter has some fluffy moments and then some angsty stuff because it's me and this story isn't going to be rainbows and butterflies...unfortunately.
“I should’ve listened. You’re hurting and-and I didn’t do enough. I should’ve done more.”
“You don’t have the guts!”
See....it’s bad.
“Ah so the little spider is being mentored by the big one?”
“Please?” He begs to no one, his grip tightening on the phone.
“Is everything okay?”
“Hmm?” Bucky replies.
“I don’t know. All I know is he’s getting too close and I can’t risk him finding you. California is our best option right now. He won’t look there.”
“Good. No more nightmares.” Steve grins and leans down to properly greet Tony with a kiss.
“What’s that? A dog?”
Tony glances up at him and Steve waits for the first strike.
Steve says goodnight and takes Morgan with him. Tony makes sure his husband is out of earshot before walking Peter toward the door.
“Hey,” Tony says softly. “I do love you. I hope you know that.”
Tony shrugs off his suit jacket and loosens his tie, letting it hang around his neck. Steve rips it away and works on the buttons of Tony’s shirt, taking his time to unbutton each one. Soft, dark skin is revealed, and Steve smooths his hand along Tony’s firm chest. It had been too long since he had been able to touch Tony like this.
“It’s just Papa and I. He needs a vacation.”
All except for the most important thing.
She’s wrapped immediately in a comforting hug.
“What plan!”
“Hmm?”
It was the first time he’s had his whole family together. All he wanted was to bring everyone together again and fix what was broken. Family meant everything to him.
Steve clears his throat. “You know...I mean it’s been awhile and...the sounds you’re making-”
“It’s not a problem, sir.”
When Steve’s voice is heard again, it’s at Tony’s favorite part.
The support of their friends was exactly what they needed during that tough time. Sam and Bucky were always looking for ways to take Peter out of the house and distract him while Natasha comforted Steve with long talks. Tony grieved the only way he knew how.
He doesn’t get a response back. It doesn’t bother him. He knew Steve was busy.
“Hey, kiddo.” Bucky places a hand over his nephew’s shoulder and squeezes it gently. “I’m sorry.”
“I swear you won’t.”
And this time he wasn’t going to break it.
“I usually am, sir.”
“I don’t care if we’re not together like that anymore. I’m still going to help you and our son. I promise.”
“I know! But...but how? You’d have to...you know…”
“Shut up,” Bucky mumbles and comes over to lean down to kiss Sam on the lips. “I fucking hate you sometimes.”
He finally gets to tear into the gifts halfway into the party. He’s eaten more than he’s ever had in his life and he wasn’t about to complain when Pepper suggested he sit down on the sofa and open presents. He almost didn’t want to rip apart the perfectly wrapped boxes but his curiosity won over and he couldn’t help but shred the paper until he was making a mess on the floor.
“Do you wanna trade?” Tony asks after a few moments of silence passes between them. “Unless I’m never allowed to hold my...other son. This hasn’t sunk in yet and the kid’s right there.”
“Um…” Peter tries to think of something else he’s done wrong. He might as well be honest. “I skipped school...a few times.”
Losing Captain America had been hard on not just the world, but the team that followed him. Captain Rogers was more than just a patriotic symbol, he was a friend and a father first. His loss caused severe pain, especially to those closest to him. Nick himself even felt the grief hit hard. It was then that he knew he needed to find a way to bring Steve Rogers back.
“I hope you’re hungry.” Sam returns back to the kitchen to finish dinner.
His dad’s absence doesn’t go unnoticed. Peter wishes that he’d see his dad’s face among the crowd of people. He’s left to imagine his dad sitting with his family and reminiscing about old times. Peter wants more than just to imagine his dad. He wants the real thing.
Tony nods and smooths his thumbs over Steve’s knuckles. “I can keep it simple. Whatever you want to do today we’ll do it.”
The man returns with the ring wrapped and placed in a small bag. Tony smiles giddily and accepts the bag. He thanks the man and both he and Happy leave the store.
“I can’t. I don’t want to hurt you again.”
“Do you think it’s…”
“I know you’re worried.” Steve’s voice is so soft Tony would’ve missed it if his ears weren’t already straining for another familiar sound.
“If you want I can show you around,” Peter offers, shifting awkwardly from foot to foot. “I mean if you want.”
“Maybe after you shower. You stink, Cap.” Tony shoos Steve away.
Tony doesn’t stay long after that. It’s too painful. He can’t take the heavy presence that surrounds him.
“Just you.”
“Don’t,” Tony points a threatening finger in his husband’s direction. “I know that look. You’re getting excited and I can assure you it’s for nothing.”
Steve whimpers, announcing the start of another contraction. His body tenses and his usually sweet scent turns sour. Tony senses his omega’s discomfort and he pulls Steve even closer, offering his neck for Steve to smell.
I’m sorry if it’s taking me so long to update. I felt like I’ve lost my muse or something. I’ve also gotten into another fandom ship and have been thinking of writing something for them. Maybe on another account or something. I don’t know. Stony is still my number one and I’ll never stop writing them!
“The event. You-you were chasing after an Omega. That’s what Mr. Pierce said. Tony!” Pepper groans.
“I just missed you guys,” Peter replies.
Steve takes another breath to calm himself. He wished Tony was with him, sitting beside him and holding his hand. But a part of him doesn’t want his mate here. Tony would have to listen to all of the horrible things Steve said. Steve didn’t want Tony to suffer or feel guilty.
She turns on her heels and makes her way back to Peter, taking the empty seat beside him and wrapping an arm around him. Tony can only watch as she comforts him. It’s something he should be doing, and yet he feels like he can’t.
Natasha frowns. “I thought Steve told him the truth.”
“Of course,” Jarvis replies.
His body is buzzing. There’s an itch under his skin that he just can’t seem to scratch. The feeling is familiar.
“It’s okay,” Pierce croons. “I told you it would feel good.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Get some rest.” Bruce smiles and places a hand over Tony’s shoulder. He squeezes it gently. “You both are going to need it.”
Their relationship was rocky and going to take time to grow and hopefully become stable. Peter wanted his dad in the picture. He wanted his family to be together again. He’s sure his papa would’ve wanted the same thing.
Tony turns around in his seat so that he’s facing Steve. “Darling, I appreciate it, honest. But I don’t want to do anything this year. I have a lot on my mind.”
“I’m sorry. We’ll do it when I get back.”
“You thirsty?” Sam asks and opens the fridge. “Beer? Or are you really done drinking?”
The next time Steve reveals he is pregnant, Tony still can’t find an ounce of happiness within himself. He fakes it just like the last time, and continues to fake it around their friends. Everyone is happy for them again. It only makes Tony feel worse about what he had to do.
Steve shushes him quietly and comes over to investigate. Peter has broken free from the blanket he had been swaddled in and his mitten covered hands are flailing. Steve scoops him up and holds him close.
“I’m trying to get him to say papa.”
“We’ll get back to what we had,” Tony promises as he softy threads his fingers through Steve’s hair.
Peter’s eyes fill with tears and he forces himself to look away and make his way toward his bedroom. He can’t bring himself to go into his papa’s room.
Thank you guys so much for the nice messages! I’m feeling a lot better! 😊 here is another update!
Steve was ready to take the blame. They had been doing well with their son until Steve ruined it. He never should have revealed to Tony how he still felt. None of his feelings mattered. Tony wasn’t going to reciprocate them, he had already made that clear.
Tony inhales sharply and clicks away at the screen of his tablet. He likes the idea of keeping the nursery simple, though there was a chance of Steve wanting something else. Their tastes in decor were very different after all.
Steve nods. “I think so,” he says, then he glances up to meet Tony’s eyes. “Do you think...maybe one more night? I’m nervous to be alone and...sorry.”
Steve shakes his head. “No, I want to.”
“Tony, please.”
“Is it working?”
“It’s alright,” Doctor Patterson assures with a smile. “And yes it’s a boy. He’s doing really well and I don’t see anything concerning. I’ll print some pictures and then you two will be free to go.”
Tony sighs.
The moment Peter is in his arms, Tony can’t keep the tears back and he lets them flow freely down his face. He holds his son close, pressing kisses to the top of his head and inhaling the pup’s scent. It immediately brings him comfort.
“I say you call him again,” Sam suggests.
Steve glances down at himself, completely forgetting that he had borrowed something of Tony’s. That’s when he notices the slightly faded logo.
But he’s not here for Clint or Thor or anyone else who wants to see him get his ass handed to him. He’s here for his son.
“His room can still be blue.”
The nausea crashes over him like a strong wave, sending Peter out of his seat and rushing toward the closest bathroom. He can hear Ned calling out for him and a few snickers from the occupied tables he passes by.
“You sure?” Sam double checks. “Just let me know and we can-”
Then Tony’s kissing him, soft and slow. Steve’s breath hitches in his throat. He had not been expecting this. The kiss doesn’t last very long and Tony is pulling away. He keeps a hand on Steve’s cheek, softly running his thumb over the area.
“Yeah.”
“Didn’t you hear? It’s been all over the news and-”
“What?”
Tony doesn’t get much sleep that night, not that he expected to. Just like Steve, he was trying to grasp the idea of having a baby. He didn’t know the first thing about being a father, but seeing that little boy changed something in him.
Peter smirks and positions himself in a fight stance, his hands rolled up into fists and raised. “I can do this all day.”
“I won’t. I promise.” Natasha pulls away and brushes away the hair that’s fallen in her nephew’s face. “I’m sorry I can’t be him, but I’m still here for you no matter what. I love you.”
“Oh yeah. A lot of scary dreams. Sometimes I still do.”
“He sacrificed more than that.”
They were so close! Ahhhh! I promise that kiss and more is coming 😉
“Oh thank God.”
“I guess I don’t understand why you do.”
“I’ll trade you,” Tony makes a quick gesture to the mug of coffee he had prepared for his husband.
Tears are running down her face and she rushes from the room. No one bothers to chase after her. She doesn’t know why she thought they would.
“He’s probably hungry,” Natasha replies.
“Okay. I’ll be there in a minute.”
“Get in line.”
When Saturday morning rolls around, Morgan doesn’t bother getting out of bed right away. She can already hear Harley fussing about something and dealing with another one of his tantrums wasn’t something she was in the mood with. She listens for her dad, hoping he hadn’t left for his meeting yet. Maybe she could beg him to spend time with her first and deal with Peter’s training later.
This time he does growl. “I’ll kill him.”
Just like the message had said, Peter finds his dad outside the compound. He’s dressed sharply like he normally is, the only thing missing is his signature sunglasses, giving Peter full access to his eyes and the emotions behind them. He appears happy, his eyes shining with excitement at the sight of his son, but there’s more than just happiness behind them. There’s fear and hurt.
“Tony. I thought you were in a meeting?”
Peter nods and jumps up to his feet to gather his things. Tony escorts him out.
“I know. I just...I never pictured this for us.”
“This is ridiculous,” Happy says with a roll of his eyes. He turns and leaves.
“I don’t know. I don’t want you to feel like you have to do this because it’s me. Tony, you made it clear that you didn’t want to-”
“Thank you.” Steve accepts the gifts with a smile. “Did you want to hold her?”
“You don’t want to stay? I have a few empty rooms.”
Natasha rolls her eyes. “Okay man. You’re just like him.”
He doesn’t miss the confused look on his dad’s face when he steps into the kitchen for breakfast. Tony smirks behind his coffee cup when he recognizes the pants.
“Trust me you deserve it. Like I said, he really needed this. I’ll hire you again.”
“Sorry,” Tony apologizes and shuts the door behind him. He makes sure to greet the older pups before coming over to take Sarah into his arms. “I almost have J up and running. What did I miss?”
“Master Peter, huh?”
“I guess. He’s a friend…I think.”
“What if I do become him?” Tony pulls away so that their eyes can meet. “What if I’m not good enough? What if I can’t be a perfect father? What if I’m not a perfect alpha?”
Natasha huffs. “Fine. I guess that’s fair. You need it more than I do. What else can I do to cheer you up?”
“Cap?” Comes a familiar voice and Steve peers up, finding Sam in the doorway.
“The tests came back negative,” the beta says and Steve swears he feels all his anxiety leave him. “It’s a little early to know for sure, but I can give you an emergency contraception just to be on the safe side.”
“No funny business!” Happy calls out after them.
“Are you asking if I want to be a part of your birthday party?” Tony asks.
But now it was like all of the progress he made had been erased. He’s no longer taking steps forward, and instead it feels like he’s taken ten back.
Tony narrows his eyes suspiciously. “You’re home kinda late. Were you with Ned again?”
Peter sighs sadly and continues sorting through the movies, only to pause when he comes across his papa’s favorite Disney film. He picks up the dvd of
“Don’t know.” Steve’s brows furrow. He gathers the last bit of ice cream and brings the spoon up to his mouth, savoring the taste before it’s officially gone. With a sad sigh, he puts the empty container on the coffee table. Then his eyes land on the logo on the front of the container and an idea comes to mind. “Ben?”
“Exactly. I didn’t do anything and now Pete...now he’s...Tony, I wish I knew. I wish I took better care of him.”
“I’m fat!” Peter cries and throws his head back. Tears prickle the corners of his eyes and he quickly shuts them to block the tears from escaping. “Nothing fits, Papa! I’ve tried all of my jeans!”
“So it’s Steve now huh? No more Mr. Rogers?”
Tony glances up, frowning for a moment before looking back down again and continuing to softly play with Peter’s hair. “I’m trying. I’m not...entirely sure what I’m doing here.”
“Shut up,” Bucky mutters and tries to punch Sam’s shoulder, only for Sam to move away and avoid being hit.
He grumbles behind his coffee cup and pretends to take interest in the contracts she places on his desk.
Tony had wanted to keep their date simple. He chose one of their favorite restaurants and reserved a table on the rooftop. Everyone knew who he was, so it was easy to get the upper half of the restaurant to themselves.
Peter snaps his head up, ready to defend himself in case Flash decides to hit him. But much to his relief, it’s not the kid that’s been picking on him since grade school.
He doesn’t blame Steve for their loss. He blames himself. He should’ve done more.
“Then why are you mad? I know I screwed up but I didn’t think you’d disown me over it.”
Slender arms are wrapping around him and Tony jumps from the contact. He turns around to hug his son properly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Will do. Night, Pep.”
“No but it confuses the hell out of me. How is he so happy! You should’ve seen the way his face lit up when he saw me.”
Steve smiles. Peter never denied anything with chocolate. “Yeah, Petey. Chocolate chips. They’re yummy.”
“It’s not the end of the world,” Peter sniffs. He wishes he believed his own words. In all honesty worse things could’ve happened to him.
“It’s different. You were older and had dad. I have no one.”
They weren’t good at breaking up. But they knew how to make up.
Tony brings Steve’s hand back up to his lips, kissing the soft skin and letting his lips linger for a while. He doesn’t want to let go, he never wants to leave Steve’s side. He thinks about the conversation they’re supposed to have, wishing they didn’t have to.
Peter decides he’s ready to enter the world one summer afternoon during a briefing. Fury is leading it since Steve was in no condition to conduct the team anymore, but that didn’t mean Steve was going to sit everything out. He still showed up to meetings when they were held and providing his input.
