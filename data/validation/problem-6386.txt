It’s Jarvis who comes to take his measurements for a newer suit, one that he’ll apparently need on the team. It’s Jarvis who brings him amenities and pieces of clothing, all allegedly from Tony. It’s the Wasp who tells him various things about Tony’s state of mind; Tony’s busy, Tony’s overworked, Tony’s working with Iron Man somewhere in the Middle East and won’t be back for a few days, Tony apologizes deeply that he just keeps missing them. It’s enough to make Steve wonder if Tony Stark isn’t some kind of mass hallucination experienced by everyone in the mansion but him. Sure, things in the lab get moved around. Someone certainly creates a new suit for him. There are a few family portraits, one of them featuring a little boy and the other a teenager, hanging up on the walls, helpfully inscribed with Stark’s name. But it’s not such a big house that Tony should be able to avoid him forever, as successfully as he has been.
Tony laughs. “There’s space for a mass media conglomerate,” he tells Rogers, “one adapted for the digital age. If we’re not talking about media and web monopolies in, say, ten years or so, I’ll eat my hat.”
A look passed over future-Steve’s face, so quick Steve was sure he was the only one who had seen it. It was calculating. It was cold. It was anything, briefly, but sympathetic. But then his face settled into a grim sort of half-frown, and he nodded.
“Dead.” Tony finishes, stepping in front of her. Of course he’s not dead; he can’t be. He hooks the finger of the man’s red glove on his own metal-covered finger and pulls. It comes off slowly, reluctant to loosen a grip it had held for decades, and then all at once with a wet
There’s one rule, though, that Tony would pay quite a lot of money to be rid of; if Steve is still standing, he won’t go to med.
Steve pulls lightly at the stitches on his palm, working his short, dirty nails under the bright shiny nylon. “I don’t know if we’re still together. She had an affair.”
“Well,” Tony said, “the good news is that I can fix this pretty easily. The bad news is, it overloaded my machines. The calculations alone are probably going to take up all night.”
“You got this from Tony,” he says softly. The freezing thing in his stomach uncoils, his reality shifting.
The man steps forward. In the light, Steve can see his face, smooth and white and slightly bulbous, two chins and swollen eye bags.
His visors immediately zoom in on the set of Steve’s wide shoulders underneath him, bright blue and recognizable. He stands just by the wreckage where a bomb had gone off in a Pinkberry, and he’s talking to black clad SWAT officers, gesturing as he speaks. He looks fine.
When Tony had brought Steve home after the Chitauri invasion, that first time, it was a quiet affair. Tony sat on the couch, drinking champagne straight out of the bottle. Steve pus his feet up on Tony’s coffee table and turned on the TV, swapping channels unlike he found whatever shitty medical soap he’d been into.
They’re looking for Amora the Enchantress, who has apparently been spending her days among New York’s elite. Several men in these circles had vanished suddenly and without a trace, having left nothing behind but a note professing to have decided to run away with their lovers, and Thor had been convinced she was looking to trap him specifically. Though he was willing to take the bait, the team had decided to do things differently.
He shut the door gently when he left the room, unease written into every line of his body. He didn’t sleep that night, and seven AM on the dot found him waiting by the doors of the workshop.
“Get back,” he told him; Tony, after all, was a civilian, and he didn’t want him to get hurt. And, shield still in hand, he knelt cautiously by the man on the floor. He didn’t quite know where to start. “Are you alright, mister?”
These days, oversensitive and picky, he feels more and more like some kind of exotic fish. No parameters are right; he thrives neither in light nor in darkness. Loneliness doesn’t suit him, and yet every tank-mate manages to rub him the wrong way.
When he turns to face him, Steve feels the first pinpricks of guilt; Stark looks genuinely scared. He’s white enough in the face to pass for the ghost Steve had taken him for, and he can’t seem to get his breathing quite under control. The little device he’s been holding has fallen onto the floor.
Natasha, he remembers, had bought a cuddly lion for the birthday of a little boy whose death she’d have a hand in orchestrating.
“Cap baked,” the Wasp tattled, as they made their way up to the elevator. “It’s, like, super crooked.”
Then again, he’s not Cap anymore. He’s a figurehead, a relic of a bygone era, desperately trying to keep together a team that had been enemies only a year prior, to protect a world doesn’t want him, a world that he doesn’t understand.
“I just can’t,” Iron Man, to many of Steve’s suggestions — opening up the bottom part of the helmet to partake in coffee and cookies, coming to the Avengers party in a masquerade mask, picnics of any variety whatsoever, “the boss would never let me.”
He’s too far away, too uncertain of himself. He enters the bagel store thinking about the Avengers, about the Illuminati, about Tony Stark. He’s got change in hand as he waits in line — this is so routine he knows exactly how much his order will cost — and he doesn’t notice notice that the usual counter girl is out, replaced with a young man he’s never seen before. A few years ago, he thinks, he would have stopped to make conversation with the newcomer. He’d have been thinking team trainings, about the roster, about the day to day, pleasantly banal arrangements which need to be made for his team to exist.
“Should have done this yesterday,” the Wasp told Steve, sounding amused, “no weird superhero stuff then.”
He gestured at the machine he was looking at, frowning. “I’ve been getting some really unusual readings here in the lab. Might be a ripple in spacetime, even, so I’m gonna have to check this out.“
But there was nothing wrong, was there? They were at a party. All of them were drinking. He’d only been polite.
He tracks down the lost shipment easily and wades through forged signatures, through staff records, through security footage. He doesn’t know everyone who works for him — it’d be impossible for him to, really — but he makes an effort, and he’s disconcerted to realize that it’d been a guy he’d known, a guy he’d liked.
Role-play is good. Role-play is easy, easier than trying to untangle whatever complicated mess of emotions this is pulling out of him.
Tony’s objective here is clear. He cannot make it too obvious he’s here to look for Amora. At the same time, he must show interest in her, engage her enough to learn anything of use.
“Oh,” A sadness flashed on future-Steve’s face that could only mean one thing. “No. No, that won’t be possible.”
The conversation continues. Steve, stung, glances down. A year into the school system, he has manned up; he doesn’t cry anymore, not at the worst of them, and Lucy and Doris are both perfectly fine to him, normally. It’s not their fault, really, that neither of them would want him as their soulmate.
For a long few moments, Tony was silent. He was leaning heavily against the wall, bracing himself with flat palms against the counter he was sitting on. Two glasses, empty of everything but ice, told Steve that the pair hadn’t stopped drinking after they’d left the little party.
Tony Stark, he’s told, is the man funding this entire operation. The surname is vaguely familiar. Tony Stark must hire good help, thoughtful people; when Steve is led upstairs to a room set up for him, he finds it welcoming to the extreme. The vintage radio works intuitively for him. The layers of blankets on the bed, the few pastels on walls, and the little rug at the entrance convey a sort of security, a stability Steve doesn’t feel but would like to. It’s nothing like any place he’d slept during the war.
He must have misheard what Tony had said, mistook what the slang meant. He couldn’t have possibly— could he?
He checks it, just in case, using his eyes and the computer system he’d jacked from the police. Probable match.
The man rushes over, kneeling down by him to start undoing one of the chains on his ankle. “I was looking for you!” He says. His voice isn’t quite familiar, but his cadence, the way he times his words, is. The way he moves is, too, his posture a little too perfect, limbs held out a little too straight. Steve knows him.
Steve cranes his head upwards, trying to think. In the faint light, he can see little of the handcuffs.
“I’m not gonna get anywhere,” he tells Steve, grabbing his upper arm for balance. “I’m too— my cerebellum is all fucked, that’s what—“
Tony’s so close to sleep he could imagine he dreams the “love you,” that Steve mutters into his hair.
So he doesn’t let up with his thighs. He reaches down with one hand and grips Steve’s head from behind, keeping him in place, jerks forward the best he can without losing balance, thrusting against Steve’s throat.
Steve doesn’t. He glances between the two of them, caught between two options, and Tony decides to play nice and give him a hint: “I’m already sore.”
He realized, then, that he was talking about this in transactional terms, monetary terms. The things Tony Stark had done for them, for him. Before he could mention anything else — the lunches, the games of tennis, the strange, nervous sort of affection he felt for Tony, the way he’d been worried—
And so, an hour after the party, he followed his future self and Tony into the workshop. He burst in without knocking and found no horrible scene awaited him.
“I haven’t been spotted yet, dear, have I?” The Wasp asks, playful. “No one would believe it, anyhow.”
“I was a spy,” Rogers says, but something inside him seems to compel him to add, “well, kind of,” which makes Tony’s point better than Tony ever could.
It had never happened before, but Steve had known the drill. He still doesn’t know exactly where he’d gotten it from, this understanding that connects him to all the other men that live and die in this strange, in-between place, the space that can't be named.
“Look,” he says, “we don’t ever have to see each other again.” And then, contradicting himself, “We can still work on the same team. Probably no weirder than working with Janet, if you think about it. I didn’t mean any of it, by the way. Alcohol makes you say things. I was just— talking.”
“Of course, of course,” Tony says, “I’m happy to help. I think I can find his room, though I’ve forgotten the number.”
Steve is the kind of man to face his problems head on, to try to confront what it had been that happened last night, the slip of vulnerability, the awkward, pathetic confessions, the disgusting drunkenness. Steve is the kind of man who’d come with him face to face, and Tony could only imagine what he was going to say.
It wouldn’t be so bad if he could act on it, if he could invite Steve out with him to the museum, if there was space for Steve in his complicated web of a life.
Tony knows Steve, and sometimes he longs to take a sharpie and and draw the damage back on, to expose the places where Steve is imperfect, but even then, he thinks he wouldn’t catch all of it.
She sets it down and steps forward towards him. For a moment, he thinks she’s going to hug him, but instead she gets on her tiptoes and kisses him hard on the lips, pushing him backwards into the wall.
“What do you want?” He asks. For a moment, Tony’s heart is in his throat, some strange, paralyzing anxiety seizing his every muscle. What
“No women,” Steve’s voice is somewhere between a question and a statement, “it’s just us coming back.”
The safest place to start, especially after the revelations of the evening, is with Natasha and Janet. They’re both attractive women, and they’d make a pretty picture on top of each other, Natasha’s long red nails tangled in Janet’s short black hair. She’d come out on top, he’s sure, the flavor of bossy in bed that he knows so well, pulling Janet’s mouth down to where she wants it, lipstick trailing on clear porcelain skin.
“I’m not sorry I had a secret identity — that was necessary,—” Tony says carefully, “but I’m sorry I lied. I’m sorry I used it to— to say all kinds of things about myself. I wasn’t thinking it could ever get out.”
Tony stares him down, one eyebrow raised. Cap glances back at where Fury had been sitting just a few minutes earlier. “Nick said it was good.”
He texts Steve the time and dress code, harasses him into surrendering his suit jacket to fitted properly, and picks him up a week later in the limo he owns just to be annoying. It’s fun, Tony realizes — he’d having fun arranging this, having fun mildly inconveniencing Steve, having fun imagining the kind of picture they’ll make together.
— are less so. Steve isn’t supposed to know that his mother thinks she must have picked the wrong man, that she’s had dreams, vaguely formed, of the soldier she should have married instead, but, half sleeping, he’d overheard her pouring her heart out to Minnie Harrows from next door often enough.
Steve has presumably been doing this for a while, and it didn’t ever make it out onto the public record, has never been caught by the press. It’s not even in his SHIELD files, and it would be, if they knew. Tony knows Fury likes to keep blackmail on everyone he interacts with, and he’s hacked into that repository several times, paranoid to know what the man had found on him.
Tony and Nat won’t have kids. They’re never talked about it, but it’s a given, considering how little time Tony has left. He’d make an awful father, and she an even worse mother — Hawkeye’s natural ability with kids doesn’t extend to his work partner.
He’s dimmed the glass; it’s one way, now, them seeing out but no one seeing in, but Steve, doesn’t have to know that.
“What is it?” He asks, and Bucky only thrusts his arm over. It’s not like him to be rendered speechless, and Steve bends down to look.
Steve grimaces, then shakes his head. This sends little black pin pricks across his plane of vision, making it hard to see. He’s still dizzy. He’s still drugged. Odd for his metabolism; they must have injected him with something else while he was out, re-upped the dose.
Rogers blinks the question has caught him off guard. “He’s gotten to San Lorenzo,” he says, as though remembering events as he’s saying them, “the dictator is dying. He’s in love with his daughter.”
He’s never going to have a night like that with Iron Man again. Whatever happens now, it’s only him and Tony.
“Of course I can,” Tony reached over, setting a light hand on the newcomer’s orange-clad elbow, and led him gently over to the rack of power tools.
He’s not sure how long it is before Steve is gently pulling the ball gag out, undoing the wrist cuffs, taking the bell out of Tony’s clenched fingers. Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and lets him carry him into the shower.
Stark takes a step back from him. His voice is softer back he speaks, quieter, “Go to bed, Captain Rogers.”
It’s a little silly, he’s sure. He would have had most of the same thoughts had they never found Steve, had it been him making the choices. He likes burgers. He likes fries. He likes the color blue. He helps people. He’s been known to go outside, on occasion. He’s been raised too wealthy not to appreciate fine art.
Steve wished, suddenly, that Iron Man was there. He could speak his mind with Iron Man without worrying about looking silly.
of lube being squeezed out of the bottle. When Steve’s fingers push into him, he’s loose, relaxed. He keeps his legs spread, chases the pleasure mindlessly, pursuing Steve’s touch as he pulls back out.
“This isn’t how I thought I’d be taking Natasha to church,” he says, into the mike. It’s barely a joke. No one laughs. “And I guess that’s on her. But— thought we could get some closure. Do this the right way.”
He sits on the edge of the bed and Tony unlaces and pulls off his boots. Steve stops him before he reaches any higher. “I’ve got this part.”
Would Tony know to suspect that? True, Steve is almost always on time, but he’s been so busy, lately. Ten minutes isn’t much; Tony will assume he’s gotten unavoidably delayed by matters of national security.
Steve huffs out a laugh, dry and disbelieving. “I’d suggest doing your homework next time. I’m not even on the team.”
Steve nodded, quick, tight, and stood instead. As he stepped away, he noticed Future-Steve replacing Tony’s empty glass of mead with a full one, and something curdled in the pit of his stomach.
“Yeah, there he is,” Tony pulls his hands free, gently rubbing his wrists for a moment. Steve feels almost nothing around his fingers, the warmth of his touch piercing through ice.
Suddenly, Tony’s giddy. He glances up from the wrapper, meets Steve’s eyes, and doesn’t bother concealing his smile.
He orders a bacon cheeseburger. Tony, rich enough to be eccentric and planning on tipping well, orders a coffee, two pickles, and a slice of Swiss cheese. It’s all he can imagine keeping down right now.
Tony spends it in the air, providing support for Thor against enemy aircraft, stopping falling debris, trying to prevent civilians from being crushed by the horrible metal machines tumbling out of the sky.
He thinks Tony would wave his concerns off if he wasn’t tied up. As it stands, he gives a dismissive little shake of the head. “It’s fine. We’re okay.”
He tries to steer Steve up towards his apartments on the top floor of the mansion, the master bedroom and attached suites, but Steve walks him unrelentingly to the medbay.
“I do,” Steve says, looking up to meet his eyes. His voice breaks on the second syllable, something deep, deep inside him protesting, but it’s Iron Man. It’s Iron Man.
He likes the hands, though he never sees anything past them; oddly, they make him think of Arnie, and there’s something reassuring about that.
“I don’t get why it’s gotta be so hard to tell,” Steve says, one chilly night that he’s over at Arnie’s. They’re thirteen, and Arnie’s ma has got the window open to let the thick nicotine smoke of Arnie’s old man’s cigs waft out, and Steve likes sitting on the wide windowsill, letting his feet dangle off the edge. It’s September. A colder front is coming, and goosebumps climb up his bare legs, but he stays stubbornly in the window, not wanting to miss the last few nice nights of the year. “If y’re supposta find ‘em, y’know?”
So, alright, he reflects as he heads upstairs for bed, topping off his glass of wine on his way, he’s got an interest. Clearly, out of the team, he ought to be prefer Thor, who is easy going, with whom conversation comes easily, or perhaps the scientists, who, if he tried, he’s sure he could find a common language yet. He hasn’t tried.
One you know him, Steve Rogers is a shitty liar. The Ultimates have known him for just over a year, now, and this is why he’s the only one of the four people playing to have lost more than his socks. His shirt lays neatly folded on Tony’s lush leather footstool, his belt over top of it. Janet, tucked into his side, her own cards balanced carefully on her knee, runs her hand over his bare abs, appreciative.
Cap, Tony has learned, is a touchy guy. He’s always been touchy. Even in the early days, Tony remembers thinking it funny how often he’d get Steve’s fingerprints on the Iron Man suit — on the small of his back, on his arms, on his gauntlets. He’d often wondered if Steve had thought he’d somehow feel the touch through the suit. He’d never asked, though. He had liked the attention.
The suit is physically strong, stronger than Steve, and capable of both firing at attackers and of limited flight in their tight quarters. The man inside is brave, and very familiar with the suit itself, but almost untrained in hand-to-hand combat.
In the dim light of the car, Steve looks good. The military suit, cinched at the waist now in a way he’d never allowed before, flatters his silhouette even sitting. He smells nice, too, simple, clean aftershave the taint tang of body wash. He must have just showered. It makes Tony want to call the night off and just—
Tony closes his laptop and slides down, off the bed, to sit beside Steve on the floor. Their shoulders bump. Tony’s height is mostly leg, so when they sit, he feels shorter than he really is, Steve’s bulk exaggerated next to him.
And then, one warm, heavy night when Steve sits down on the mansion’s balcony to drink beers with Giant-Man, he knows with certainty that, somewhere, his soulmate is carefully applying concealer over a bruise on their face.
It’s simple, but the air of desperation underlying the words makes Tony’s stomach clench. He can imagine Steve’s state of mind as he had written those words, his sadness, his worry, how rejected, unlovable he must have felt. His chest aches, a deep, bone chilling ache that seems to cut into the very core of him, into his soul. His eyes water and swim. He fights to get his breaths under control.
“Yeah, uh, it sure is.” Steve takes a step further into the lab, closer to Stark. Now, he’s picking up sweat in the air, the literal smell of fear. This is a man with something to hide if he’s ever seen one. He wonders if this has anything to do with the little device he’s dropped onto the floor, with whatever corded thing he’s hiding under his shirt.
He’s not too worried. Things come up, and neither of the scientists had ever shown much fondness for him anyhow.
And then it hits; Tony Stark had seen him kiss Iron Man. The friendship is effectively over, for reasons Steve never could have predicted.
And so, to prove a point to both himself and Tony, he’d volunteered to accompany him on this mission, undercover as a bodyguard. He knew — knows — that this can’t go on, that he needs to get over himself. This, he tells himself, will help — he’ll see Tony in action, both as himself and Iron Man. He’ll work with him, and he’ll feel normal again.
“Any time he lies or misrepresents what he believes to be the truth, it’ll hurt him,” the tech says, “good news is, it’ll wear off in forty-eight hours. So if our good Captain can stay honest that long…”
His room remains quiet. The sink doesn’t turn on by itself. The lights don’t flicker. He hears fewer voices than his average.
When his warm hand lands on Steve’s lower arm, he jumps, yanking hard enough on his seatbelt it jams.
Up above him, Tony reads the conversation as though it’s written into the popcorn ceiling, one word after another, devoid of context: down the street and to your right, sir, no, the other way, yes, thank you, you’re welcome, God bless, God bless, God bless.
He doesn’t know what there is to be jealous about, and yet he feels it keenly, soaking into the very core of his being.
And then, quite suddenly, something on the other side gave, and Tony was tumbling forward into him, knocking Steve flat on his back.
Apparently a man of tradition, or perhaps just unwilling to stay around the smell of vomit, Steve is headed for the sitting room. He puts Tony down on one of the yellow couches and steps forward to fiddle with the TV.
Isn’t it possible she’s somewhere here, in the future? Isn’t it possible she works on similar devices to the ones Stark builds? Is it possible she’d been electrocuted, that something had happened? Is she okay?
Steve takes his hand. Clears his throat. The way his eyes trace down the curve of Tony’s throat is distinctly not platonic.
Steve sits again. This time, there’s a seat between them. Tony feels rejected and inadequate when he should feel relieved.
The new butler intervenes, offering him his usual morning assortment — coffee, food, colored water with chia seeds floating in it, for health reasons,— and some of the good stuff.
“No, I’m afraid,” he lets a note of playfulness into his voice, the kind of note that suggests he’s not showing weakness right now, “terribly, terribly afflicted. I’d best go get a drink of water.”
Steve curls up on his side, rejected and lonely, and returns to his childhood fantasies; someday, he tries to convince himself, his soulmate will just have to love him.
Steve is a hard man to hurt, but Tony is creative, used to letting tools do the work he can’t. Tony knows all his weak points. Tony can make him cry, can see what it looks like when Steve breaks down completely.
He’s got a towel slung over his shoulders, catching whatever drops of water his short hair had managed to hold on to. Outside of this, he’s naked.
, after all — and perhaps he’d been scared, earlier, and Steve had misinterpreted the look. They’d dealt with shapeshifting aliens once before, and maybe future Steve had assumed him to be foe, before he’d taken stock of the situation. Steve, after all, was not often in the position of trying to judge the expressions on his own face from the outside.
He’s on the submarine when they hit the body of a man encased in ice. The Wasp is the first to recognize the red, white, and blue, and Tony’s stomach twists into knots in some strange sort of anticipation. He doesn’t know what he expects to see from this corpse.
His attention had been on the television, on the gingerbread cookies, on his mother’s casual warmth. He’d been content to bask in it, hadn’t felt the need to let his mind wander.
Tony Stark, dressed in a white lab coat over his classic three-piece suit, oversized goggles covering the top half of his face, was positioned at a lab counter, taking readings from a device Steve could make neither heads nor tails of. When he glanced up at them, he looked more amused than surprised.
“Alright,” Tony says suddenly, holding up his comm, “we talk. Get as much information as possible, then reveal ourselves.”
He wonders, as they drift closer to their destination, which one of knows pain better. Tony has spent the past year in a constant haze of headaches and migraines, of body aches great and small, had thrown up so much post-chemo that the line from his throat down to his stomach had been one single trail of agony.
Steve looks back to Tony, who’s still watching helplessly, his hands tied behind his back, ankles fastened to the chair.
In this world, he somehow imagines a possibility of something between himself and Steve. It’s probably not serious — it’d be ridiculous to expect the two of them to be able to come up with something stable, not to mention, that, for reasons Tony can’t quite explain, imagining himself with a man immediately comes with the expectation that it can’t be serious, can’t be the same kind of thing he’d always thought he’d have with a wife — but perhaps he’s invested in it anyhow. Maybe, in this hypothetical world, he’s excited right now, a little giddy with joy. Maybe this matters to him. Maybe he thinks Steve had agreed because Steve returns his interest, and he’s planning out the details. Steve, who is as straight as anyone comes and could not have thought about it this way, doesn’t know, but hypothetical-Tony is probably imagining taking him home and sleeping with him.
indeed been meant to remind him of the long-forgotten soldier, another man like him, a man who must have died without a soulmate, the way Tony would.
As Steve is prone to do, he misinterprets and leans down for a kiss. It’s too sweet for Tony to turn him away again; he catches Steve by the chin and kisses him back, soft and slow. It’s worth it to feel Steve, solid and responsive, under his touch.
He’d liked Thor, too. It seems as though, lately, he’s kept up a nice track record of being pleasantly surprised by tall, blond, buff men.
Tony could be rid of her now, could try to move on, to tell himself none of it had really ever mattered to him, either. A year together. An engagement.
Steve grunts. Tony takes this as consent, pulling him up into his arms, and Steve doesn’t have the energy to argue. They don’t talk until they’re in a car, Steve slumped over against the window. Tony’s called for one of his drivers, Steve notices; he must have flown here.
For some reason, this didn’t seem to comfort Tony. He looked about to cry, and, slow, he stepped closer to Steve, his fingers brushing lightly against his sleeve. “I—“
His hand comes up to rest on the side of Steve’s face, his fingers calloused and cold. Steve breathes deep and smells machine oil, strawberry milkshake, rich, musky cologne with a note of flowery spice underneath.
This is America’s stalwart, no-nonsense action hero, projecting the kind of strength his troops can respect. Perhaps Tony is overestimating himself, but he thinks that, underneath it all, he senses the same bone-deep fear that himself is feeling, the same roiling anxiety. Cap’s been doing this far longer than he has.
Steve has written a message in his familiar cursive handwriting, loopy and slanted, just under the stems of the flowers.
The girl won’t be anything. Even if she sells her story, which she had seemed a little too sweet to do, “Tony Stark was too drunk to get it up” isn’t a particularly new headline. If anything, it’s exactly a dime a dozen.
“You’re coming back with me,” he says, “to my place. Leave the paperwork you’re dying to get done for tomorrow.”
“Tell me you feel it too,” Iron Man says, his voice low in Steve’s ear. It would be seductive, if not for the cold edge underlying his words, some note Steve can’t quite read. Anxiety, he tells himself, desperation.
“Cheese,” Steve says, his back still to Tony. Tony’s phone makes a little fake camera click. For a moment, staring at the planes of his back, the perfect curve of his ass, Tony contemplates the possibility of making this his lock screen picture, and discounts it. He’ll have to get it printed.
Steve ragequits soon afterwards, when another loss has Janet reaching for his fly. He’s by far the most expressive player, his poker face unpracticed, and this extends even post-game; his embarrassed flush reaches down to collarbones.
The grass is always greener on the other side; if he were home, he knows, he’d be depressed. The coolness of his bedroom wears on him just as much as the bright lights and the cameras. So little time left on earth, he reflects, and he can find nothing he’d like to do with it.
“Where’s he at?” He asked the Wasp, coming in to set the cake on the table among Thor’s offerings. “Didn’t end up having a date and leaving, did he?”
In a perfect picture, he’d have a pair of reading glasses perched on his nose, but he doesn’t need them. Will never need them, assuming the super soldier serum doesn’t fail him.
Tony stumbled back, catching himself roughly on the wall. “God,” he said, squeezing his eyes shut. “Jesus, Cap.”
“Nooope, no, not going there.” Janet downs her drink all at once, choking slightly. No one’s having fun anymore, except maybe Natasha. Tony ought to stop this, play a good host, but—
Steve scans the perimeter, automatically looking for the source of the smell, and is even more startled to see that, across the room from them, little salmon sandwiches and hors d'oeuvres give way to a great heaping plate of roast pig, covered in herbs and baked fruit, surrounded by great horns of what Steve would guess to be mead.
He puts his weight on the balls of his feet, then stands up on his tip toes, trying to get some leverage to feel the locking mechanism with his fingers. If he can, perhaps—
Weakened like he is, without the suit, without weapons, he has no recourse against these men. He’ll never fix the machinery in time, never take them hand-to-hand.
Future-Steve and Tony were talking about advances in open-heart surgery, and Tony was drinking, judging by his slightly slurred speech, his fourth of fifth glass of mead.
feel complete without Iron Man, but Steve felt at ease with their little group, the kind of battle-forged ease that didn’t expect to Tony Stark.
“See Tony off,” Steve said, giving his counterpart a flat, tight smile. He wanted to see the other man’s reaction, find some reason to disbelieve this, to call it off, to tell Tony his suspicions, but he was disappointed; the other man only nodded at him.
“Sure,” Cap says, gruffly, “this is all very—“ it were up to him, Tony thinks, he’d stop talking here; this is all very, “— nice.”
The man works his left ankle free and pauses, kneeling by Steve’s feet. They make eye contact, and the warmth in his gaze is nothing if not familiar, correct.
And yet something warm stays with him into the night, something he’s been forgetting for a long time. He believes in the Avengers, believes in Tony. None of this, he thinks, hopes, is beyond repair.
The car settles into an uneasy, wounded silence. Steve stares down at his hands and tells himself he shouldn’t regret anything he said. He’s not angry. He’s not upset. He’s just telling things how they are, and how they’re going to be.
Steve sat down, unnecessarily glum, and the Wasp and Tony recounted the events of the evening. His cake was cut up, and, still talking, Tony took a slice, and Steve’s mood dropped even further.
His eyes had been watering, earlier, as he’d said his goodbye. Now, a single tear slipped out and ran down his cheek, leaving a shiny wet trail behind. “God.”
He lets his head fall forward, hoping the man might mistake him for dead, might leave him this way, but no luck. The second blast, ineptly shot, grazes his shoulder, sharp, burning pain. Steve bites down on the gag and tastes carbon reinforced leather.
Things move forward, as things tend to do. Natasha is buried. Tony hires a clean up crew, finally, to sponge the leftover blood and brain matter out of his bedroom floor and returns to sleeping alone in his silky, luxurious bed, kind of hoping for some kind of ghost activity.
Perhaps he’s the relic, the man always out of time. Perhaps this is just how their world is, now, the easy trust replaced with something different. Perhaps Tony stores counter-measures for everyone one of his friends, expects to fight them all, one day. Perhaps they all expect it.
He lets the Avengers take him back with them. All of them save Iron Man try to make conversation with him on the way back, and Steve listens without responding.
“Well, you’re stuck with me now,” Steve says, squeezing his hand, “should have thought of that, shouldn’t you? Actions have consequences.”
“Pardon me, ma’am?” Tony asks. Steve can see his hand hovering over the pocket with his identicard, ready to end the interaction.
Steve stares for a moment too long at the empty space he’s left behind, and turns his gaze to Tony’s sorry form.
Ten minutes later, Steve’s fucking him, long deep strokes, and Tony takes Steve’s hand and pulls it to rest over his own throat. “You could—“
Slowly, Tony raised a hand to his face, pressing his palm against his eye. He was moving sluggishly, unsteadily.
“I think you’re exactly as dressed as they want you to be,” he counters, waggling his eyebrows, “don’t think you’ve missed the angles of some of those cameras.”
He’s going to marry her, and he’s going to be happy. In the best case scenario, he has four years left to blow, and she’s easy to have fun with. She’s all he could ask for, all he could want.
“Postmodern,” Tony corrects automatically, earning himself a deeper scowl, “but, no, it’s not that.”
When he wakes, he can’t shake the feeling that he’s lost something important. A feeling of dread, of foreboding clings to his skin like sweat, like moisture.
“Are you alright, Mr. Stark?” The reporter asks. Ah, yes. He’s closed his eyes in the middle of the interview.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut hard. His head pounds. He’s exhausted. “Yeah, that’s capitalism for you,” he returns nonsensically, an over-familiar joke, “speaking of which, I have a meeting. I gotta go.”
Steve livens up immediately when Tony makes his way over, a sort of relief written into his features. He doesn’t smile, not exactly. Tony, tipsy and warm, smiles back.
The kiss is awkward. Steve’s too shocked to close his eyes. Their teeth clang against each other uncomfortably. Tony remembers his morning breath and goes to pull back, but Steve’s hand on his jaw stops him.
Steve considered telling him his misgivings, but even to him, they sounded stupid; future-him had looked at him wrong. Future-him had seemed calculating. Future-him had gotten touchy with Tony, which, for some reason, had actually seemed welcome.
He tells himself that there’s plenty of time to fix it, that Bucky’s one of the lucky few who have confirmation early on, that, as strange as this seems now, it’ll all make sense eventually.
Tony falls asleep there, on the couch, mourning the loss of warmth and company, dwelling, as always, on the disappointing impermanence of things.
Steve turned to face him. Remembering the little gesture from earlier in the workshop, the hand Tony had placed on his chest, he glanced down to his heart and then up to his eyes.
probably meant something more vague back in Steve’s day, Tony thinks. He’d probably missed Tony’s attempt to provoke entirely. It’s just as well, really; not one of his best. Still, he can’t quite get the interaction out of his head as he trudges upstairs to shower, — privately, thank you very much, a big improvement from SHIELD’s facilities— can’t stop himself from imagining a world of horrible misunderstandings in which he had, somehow, really meant “date.”
The couch shifted, and Steve realized that Tony had just sat down next to him, his own glass of mead in hand. He sat down how he always sat down, keeping a good three inches of space between himself and Steve, his elbows at his sides as though to protect his core.
Barely tasting the mango, he sits through the report; Stark technology found in the hands of terrorists. The location — a shopping mall in Washington, DC—, he realizes, makes it likely that this is the same group that Steve’s been fighting. Remembering the broken nose, he shudders.
He reassesses the situation through the light of this revelation. He’d thought it had nothing to do with the body, but, perhaps—
He hasn’t been in touch with the team. He doesn’t know where they’re at, where his arrival would hurt or help, doesn’t know dire the situation is. Things could be delicate.
“I should go,” he says. He’s still kneeling by the bed, his face only inches below Steve’s. They could kiss. Once, they would have.
“Oh,” Steve said, dully. The information settled uneasily in the pit of his stomach. The people around him would age, change. Fourteen years from now, he’d still look twenty-five. “Guess I’ve got that to look forward to. Is there, uh—“
“That’s three votes for Steve stripping, right?” Janet chirps, disinterested in going down this particular conversational avenue, “I’m counting three votes for Steve stripping.”
Maybe if Steve had been using his technology, he wouldn’t have lost contact. Maybe if Tony had made a point from the beginning to outfit him, to make sure he was on the same level as the men he’s fighting, this wouldn’t have happened. Maybe if Tony hadn’t slept in, if he’s asked Steve what was happening the morning he’d left, why the tides had turned—
“Well,” Iron Man says. His voice sounds like he’s about to refuse, but he seems to change his mind, “when you put that way, sure.”
Jan has left one of her flat shoes under his couch, and Steve had never bothered to pick his shirt up off the footrest. He lets himself imagine a world where the playful stripping had gone further, perhaps—
Before the tumor, Tony prided himself on being something of a collector. As the pleasure of owning rare and expensive things wore thin, he branched had branched out from art to sculpture to trading card, and, somewhere along the way, tried his hand at keeping exotic fish. He found aquarium maintenance tricker than he’d expected, and the beautiful fish capricious and prone to random disease.
“Well,” Steve starts, a little uncertainly, one arm in the sleeve of his heavy coat, “that was a nice night. Thank you for having us.”
Tony wants to argue, but that’s when his father enters the room, and he swiftly takes his feet off the couch and shoves a cookie in his mouth to avoid talking.
“Cap,” he had said, several weeks after Steve had woken up in the future, “we’ve learned about your liaisons.”
In his peripheral vision, he sees the man watching him glance down at his phone and frown, jamming out a response with clumsy, fat thumbs. It’s getting dark outside, drawing close to eight. It’s now or never, Tony thinks, and, moving slowly, unobtrusively, rolls us his sleeve.
“Show me,” Tony inhales sharply as Steve rolls his hips, feeling out his new position, “show me what those thighs are good for, soldier.”
“It’s fine,” Steve says quickly. A second cut follows the first, criss crossing it, and Tony sees Steve wince in pain, several shades paler than he’d been a moment before.
Steve throws the shield in a neat arc, knocking down several attackers at once, and catches it easily just as it behinds to deviate from course. Iron Man pushes himself unsteadily to his feet, taking Steve’s offered hand.
It finally comes, complete and vivid. Tony imagines everything he could do to Steve. He could take him by the jaw, push his head back, force his mouth open. Could dig his nails into skin and scratch hard down his sides, leaving grooves. Could pull out the cat o’ nine tails and put his arms into it.
“Don’t be weird,” Tony tells him, stopping by the bar near the entrance to help himself to a Bloody Mary to go. “Drinks?”
The program works. If his soulmate, the person who had left  — would leave? — the finger print over Tony’s thumb, is in any system, and Tony gets his hands on the data, he should find them.
He trails off, unable to come up with the words to describe what had just happened. Baby’s first time being sexually objectified by the masses generally and Tony Stark specifically. Something something gender equality.
They’d come back together, just the two of them, after the battle with the Chitauri, and then after they had taken down the Liberators.
“No need to look so glum about it, Cap.” The Wasp shoves him playfully. She’s short enough that her shoulder only hits the crook of his arm. It’s funny how physical she is, how touchy; women didn’t hold themselves like that back home.
“Darling,” Tony says, touched and a little out of his element. She lets him draw her into his arms, buries her face in his neck.
It’ll be unfair to take Steve up on the pity fuck he might offer, but he can accept this. He’ll take this.
“Listen,” he says, again, “your number was just there. I wasn’t trying to— be weird. I don’t think that just because you—“
Tony sighs, but leans forward to tell the driver the new address. They drive in silence, both equally caught, Steve suspects, on the past, or, perhaps, on a different present.
“Yeah,” Steve said. He couldn’t believe this was happening. Part of him, still, selfishly wanted to stop Tony, to grab him by the sleeve, to tell him every reason not to go. But he couldn’t, couldn’t choose his momentary happiness over his friend’s life. “Of course.”
Tony’s briefcase rests in the trunk of the car. Steve knows, now, the reason for its surprising heaviness; the Iron Man armor rests in folded pieces inside it. Tony can’t get away with carrying it, but tucked into Steve’s over-the-shoulder carrying bag, it will be assumed to be essential or unnoticed.
And yet, as watching Steve take Janet’s hand in both of his, pressing his lips briefly to her fingers, he feels strangely empty, strangely unsatisfied.
He keeps trying, writing several times a day like the right combination of words will get him through. Open sesame, he thinks, again and again, trying,
The relative comfort of the scene is interrupted by the long, deep cut that opens up suddenly on Steve’s chest, staining his shirt red. Tony jolts up, suddenly very awake.
“This and that.” He repeats, running his fingers over the smooth ridges of the thing. “Wild youth, huh?”
He has the good sense not to speak up until Tony feels human enough to sit up and blink blearily at the room. “Draw the curtains,” he says, trying to quell an annoyance —
Tony tests the bond and finds them immovable, his body one long, clean line for Steve to manipulate however he wants. The thought it unbearably hot. Steve’s hand closes on his cock, again, and he can’t help strangled noises that come out of his throat as Steve strokes him, quick and rough, to full hardness.
For a few minutes, they sit in silence. Steve finishes Tony’s coffee, holding it against his chest like he’s trying to absorb the warmth. Tony can’t shake the morning’s anxiety, the jittery feeling under his skin.
Tony reaches up to tangle a hand in the soft hair at the back of Steve’s neck, almost too short to grab, and urges him forward.
“Ah,” he said, pleasant, “Seems that portal had worked a little too well. Mind telling me the date?”
He doesn’t expect much from Steve; he knows what they have isn’t, exactly, love. Steve couldn’t love a man, not in the same way he’s always expected to love a woman; he’d grown up dreaming of the apple pie life with Gail. Tony’s world can leave him feeling cold and lonely. Tony himself will be gone in a matter of years, if not months.
“Just thinking.”  Where did that come from? Steve’s always had an active imagination, and, after a moment, he chalks up the hyper-specific fantasy, the strange hunch he’d known Stark’s exact words, to that fact. There’s nothing else it can be; the serum hadn’t made him psychic.
“I just want— the most, please, just make me feel it.” He’s immediately a little guilty saying it, asking for it, making this about himself.
He’s dropped his beer. Giant-Man is concerned, offering him the roll of paper towels to clean it up with, asking what had happened.
Clearly, this isn’t Steve’s first time doing something like that. That wasn’t bicurious behavior back in the car. Captain America has sucked dick, and that’s the world Tony has to live in. Captain America has sucked
He’s only half lying. His gut tells him that he ought to be fine, that if he’s made it to now.  The chestplate is keeping him alive, the portable generator in the helicopter providing the charge it needs.
Thor looks strangely domesticated in the beige sweater and green slacks he wears, remarkable only for his height and literally godlike physique. Cap wears his dress uniform. He makes a perfect picture in layers of khaki, old fashioned in a charming way. Tony feels the urge to mess him up, pull his tie out over his coat, ruin his slicked-back hair.
“Oh,” Steve says, and picks up a pair of fuzzy red and black handcuffs, hooking them over a finger, “I’m amenable.”
“Just a suit. Here, do you want to—“ She’s already keying in a code and pushing open the door of the lab.“Tony, dear? Are you in here?”
Rogers stares him down, looking about to protest, but all he says is, “Let me get a change of clothes.”
Tony pulls out the leather blindfold and fits it neatly over his eyes, and then lets his hand tangle in Steve’s hair, trailing down.
“Hey!” Tony says, a strange, defensive humiliation burning hot in his gut, “Thought you didn’t talk to Jarvis, where’re you—“
He follows the team back. His request has the highest chance of working if he asks in private, and, for the next several hours, Rogers is a hard man to get alone. He shakes hands with soldiers, nods gruffly at the other SHIELD breach teams, shouts things like, “saw you boys out there!” and “keep it up!” most of which, Tony is sure, he doesn’t really mean all that much.
This, to Tony Stark, should feel at best trite and at worst mind numbingly boring. Steve had bored Janet, for God’s sake, and Tony is known for having a new girl in his bed every night. Instead, he feels a tiny thrill of belonging, snug as Steve’s arm around his shoulders. Steve is a man he rarely feels the need to impress, a man about as disinterested in the monetary upsides of dating a billionaire as humanly possible, a man who’s seen Tony at both his worst and his best. He’s reliable, constant, in a world that’s anything but.
Had there been something he’d missed all along? Dreams, feelings, everything he’d dismissed in favor of computer codes and cold, clean mathematics?
“Does that mean you’re going to be stuck in the lab all that time?” The Wasp asked, sounding a little pouty.
Or otherwise it’s eye contact, the sort of look where both parties are willing each other, desperately, to read the same story they are, to stay on the same page, the kind of look that, otherwise, Steve has only ever experienced in combat. It’s a different kind of tension, hanging in the air, a fear tinged with something else entirely.
“I’d just bought a gift for Callum’s seventh,” she says, “it was a big, cuddly lion. I was going to ask you to have Jarvis wrap it.”
Steve is trying to keep himself from getting angry, and it’s not working. Janet looks on the verge of tears, quiet and serious. Tony, who hasn’t bothered to change out of his pajamas, is on his third martini. The separation the alcohol forces between him and the rest of reality feels like the only way to survive right now, the only to keep functioning.
. He remembers sitting side by side with Tony Stark to watch the video of the moon landing, the hope that had bloomed out of the emptiness of his chest, the gratitude.
This time, Tony lets him try to get to his feet. Steve makes it, then sways, realizing the near-impossibility of putting one foot in front of the other.
“One way or another, you’re going to talk, pretty boy.” He’s dropped his voice, getting into character. He really doesn’t sound like himself anymore.
His counterpart arrived first. He seemed a little surprised to see Steve, his face screwing up in not-quite-concern.
. Tony’s bored with the interview in the first ten of them. The noises of the party around them are so familiar he can close his eyes and trace each one of them. There’s clinking of forks, of glasses, from the last of the diners. There’s the laugher, the voices. His memory is near perfect, and if he focuses, he can recognize more than half of the people speaking, pick out the faint accents of scientists, the practiced cadences of politicians and reporters. Almost no one laughs in earnest, and Tony tells the fakes apart easily, the high trill of women pretending to be interested intermingled with the huffy, low thing men do when they think they’re funny. He’d been on the receiving end of a trill himself moments ago. The pretty blond reporter is wearing thinner on him by the minute.
“Sorry, would you mind hanging back?” He asked, “I’d really like to talk to you, when you’ve got a minute. Future stuff, about.” He glanced back over at Steve, and then at Tony, his expression meaningful. “You know.”
He teeters dangerously on the edge of “I love you,” a ridiculous sentiment to send someone he’s barely had a conversation with, and it’s perhaps a good thing that the terror leader in front of him shifts and turns to look at him again, and Tony has to scramble to look busy with the blueprints.
He closes his eyes. Steve has been all too present in his head for the past couple of days. Past couple of weeks. The months he’s been out of the ice. He’s overwhelming, too bright, too loud. He leaves Tony feeling like there’s no space for himself in his mind anymore, like every little impulse, every stray thought — the burger and fries, see if she needs help, choose the blue, go get some fresh air, maybe the museum this weekend — can be assigned to Steve.
This is a break from tradition, unusual for Steve. The diner is familiar; close to base but distinctly simple, American-style, the one they go to on the rare occasions Steve or Hawkeye picks the venue.
By the time he finally meets Tony at the doors, he’d been saying goodbye for an hour. Many guests are filtering out now — the older crowd, high strung early risers, the group of women in red dresses, apparently anxious to get away from someone’s advances.
Steve reaches up with his free hand, trailing his fingers over Tony’s cheekbone, sets a hand on the side of his face.
Steve chews. Terrified, Tony realizes he had no idea what he’s thinking, though he doesn’t look impressed.
And for now, he’ll stay far away from the guy. Living together is already begging for the disaster, and so Tony spends as little time at the mansion as possible, and confines himself to his private apartments when he’s in. Every single time he talks to Steve is an opportunity for Steve to learn something about him which will make the puzzle slot into place, see something that lets him know. Every single time they meet, they’re walking across a minefield.
“I’m alright,” he said, again, “Just a shock. I saw the other side of the portal, Cap, and— they weren’t our men. The people getting him out, hailing him, saluting him.”
Trained to throw money at his problems, he calls the funeral parlor to arrange a ceremony, buy a gravestone. He doesn’t know what to put on the engraving except her name.
In the confines of this room, warm and hazy with drink, Tony feels slightly winded, unable to really wrap his head around the possibility. This isn’t how this works. As risqué as they’re getting, here, it stays within the safe confines of two heterosexual couples, the light hazing of playful heterosexual desire. When Natasha had even hinted at anything else, earlier, he’s immediately felt off balance, defensive.
Before the Avengers had taken residence here, the medbay had been a gallery, and when Tony closes his eyes, he can picture the places on the walls where his mothers’ favorite paintings had hung, cityscapes and careful depictions of birds. He’d never been sure what it was that had made her pick them out, had never thought to ask.
Outside of suggesting an immediate confrontation — which has tactical advantages, but may leave them unsure of what has happened to Amora’s probable victims — he can’t bring to mind a better one, in their current position. Tony has done nothing to compromise the team. He has nothing to be upset with Tony about.
This, Steve thinks, is Tony Stark the way he’s always thought of him. A nice enough fellow —  awful kind of him to fund the Avengers, of course — but a little vapid, a little empty. How many times had Iron Man blamed Tony for his inability to reveal his identity? How many times had he bowed out of events with a
“Seems like I’ve got you now, big guy.” It comes out wrong, fake-sultry in a way that’s not even hot in porn. It doesn’t sound like his voice.
“My hands, please,” Tony says, “and give me a pen. I need to make some notes, run this up against what I remember. It’s going to need a lot of correcting.”
He glanced down, away. “I could find a way to make him stay. Someone else who— I could find a way, Cap, I could.”
Somewhere, his soulmate is sitting with a hand-held mirror and pushing her fingers in tender flesh, on the borderline of painful, trying to cover up a bruise. The knowledge is absolute and complete, and it hits him hard.
“Would you stop blabbering on about Jarvis? He’d walked into the wrong place at the wrong time, and now he’s dead,” Natasha says, her voice cold without being cruel, “that’s all there is to it.”
The living incarnation of a Norse thunder deity sent here by my father in Valhalla to purify the earth again.”
Steve pulls his coat all the way on but pauses, old fashioned politeness warring with curiosity, “Dress code? It’s not another fancy party, is it?”
Two men guard the doors. A sliver blue sky shows through the curtains on the window. Tony’s eyes can’t focus on the writing on the green street sign. Pull it together, Stark. The streets are fucking numbered. Get the number.
It comes down to this: Tony had placed trust in the wrong person. Tony had allowed great, smart, innovative technology to fall into the wrong hands. Steve had cleaned up his mess. Steve had risked his life fighting men who were using his technology while Tony fooled himself into thinking that trying to trace the cause the issue was relevant.
Jarvis falls to the floor, the tray in his hands. He hadn’t even seen anything. He hadn’t said anything. It’s nothing but cruelty at this point, an old grudge taken to its logical extreme.
He’s a little pale, Steve notices. He’s in disarray. His suit is grass stained, though Steve hadn’t seen him fall. His hair is messed up. Dried bits of spittle stain his chin, having escaped the gag. He probably screamed, Steve thinks. He was probably screaming before Steve woke up from whatever magic induced stupor he’d been in. He’s human. He cares for Steve — Steve knows that, deep down, even as upset as he is — and not knowing what state he was in must have been terrifying.
He was too sick of losing people, too devastated by the simple, sweet thing he’d imagined he’d never have again, to think about any of that.
Well, it’s only natural to be drawn to strength, to perfection. Cap is objectively gorgeous. Cap embodies the unrealistic standard of male beauty he’d grown up with, the perfect specimen. The skin-tight clothing had never helped, either; anyone, straight or otherwise, would look. Can he, a man who’d so often failed to measure up, a man whose own body is killing him, be blamed for his desire for this perfection?
The team isn’t the same, and not just because they’ve left SHIELD behind. When he’s there, Hawkeye walks around like a lifeless automaton, his eyes downcast, his expression perpetually distant. He takes unnecessary risks in battle, escalating each time they’re out. None of them dare to stop him.
These rules, for the most part, bother Tony less than probably should. For one, Steve Rogers lives by them far less than Captain America does — one is a historical fiction, after all, and the other only human. Sometimes, too, he delights in pushing back against them, lives to coax Steve out of his comfort zone. It’s a delicate, touchy thing for both of them, exhilarating and frustrating in equal measure.
All of them speak to him. Iron Man doesn’t speak. All the rest of them speak to him. Iron Man holds his shield, his — its? Is Iron Man alive?— head craned down to stare at the star. Once Steve feels that he can stand without losing his balance, he pulls the cowl over his face and crosses the room, pulling the shield free of Iron Man’s grip.
“I thought my soulmate was Iron Man. I hadn’t been able to reach him, and he has good reason to hide his identity, and, well, we’re close. I thought I was going to see him when I got there. I kind of hoped…”
His mind mostly made to don the suit and join them in DC when he reloads the page to see Steve’s face splayed out of the page.
Steve reads about aftercare on websites featuring pictures of flowers that look like vulvas and corporate style cartoony art of people with hairy armpits joyfully holding buttplugs, which Tony somehow finds both better and worse than the Cosmopolitans where his ex girlfriends had learned
He had fallen asleep on the couch, and woke stretched out on the couch, his bare feet laying across Cap’s lap. It was strange, he thought, drowsily, that Steve hadn’t woken him, hadn’t pointed it out, hadn’t pushed his feet away and laughed him off.
“Sorry,” Steve said, pulling himself up. Tony accepted his offered hand, and stood with his hands braced on his knees, huffing out like he was on the verge of hyperventilating.
Staring down out of the windows of the Avengers helicopter, he imagines when Stark must have gotten the call. It couldn’t have been much after their meeting at the lab. Stark must still have been shaken up. Steve pictures vividly Stark’s white, shaky hand on the phone, his knees hitting against the top of the table, sending test tubes clattering. Maybe he has a cigarette in his hand, white paper wrinkling under sweaty fingers. He must still sound authoritative, though, when he speaks, commanding, like the CEO he is. He’ll say comforting, self-assured words, like, “I’ll be right there!” or, maybe, “itemize the cost of the replacement.”
The thought fills him with a strangely fierce sense of protectiveness, anger tinged with something warm. It’s easy to be angry with Tony when he’s in control, when he’s taking charge of the meeting, when he’s telling Steve how things are going to be. It’s harder now, cataloguing the after effects of his fear, his struggle.
Dully, he gets to writing on the blueprints, making nonsense corrections and changing numbers almost at random. He’s long since mastered the art of looking busy when he’s not, of looking like he knows what he’s doing. As long as he can feel eyes on him, he’ll keep at this.
Tony glances between the two men, assessing. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t see the night’s conversation coming to this. He’d be lying he said he hadn’t set himself up, to some degree, for this line of questioning.
His face is wet, eyes red, the gag mangled and half bit through. He’s breathing quick, shallow. He doesn’t have enough air, Steve thinks, and that thought snaps him into action.
It also doesn’t go over well at work, which continues to be as busy as ever with the extra bonus of lowered morale. He texts Steve, words this time,
“Sir Ian—“ he fumbles for the card where he’d written down the name, realizes he’s left it. “There was an actor talking about it on TV. People talk about it now.”
Cap’s not stopping him, though. Drunk on the power of that, Tony lets his hand drift up and messes up his perfectly combed hair.
He can’t think of a time he’s seen Steve cry, and some dark part of him wants to push it, wants to be allowed it. Suddenly, Tony’s terrified.
It hits Steve suddenly that the man with the briefcase is a stranger. Whether he likes it or not, it had always been Tony in the suit; Tony, remembering Steve's quirks and their inside jokes, Tony, sitting with him on the rooftop stargazing, Tony, spending his nights wearing head to toe armor in second rate diners to keep an insomniac Steve company, Tony lying about being his own shitty boss to get out of awkward situations. It's impossible, he realizes, to separate one from the other.
instructions given to him by a fancy modern radio, endless shakes in the kitchen, hushed conversations with Jarvis, armor tinkering in the workshop, work conversations on the phone, his eyebrows knitted together in concern — and arrives to the conclusion that the man must be more neurotic than genuinely dangerous. A kindly librarian helps Steve figure out how to find old reports about Stark in their records; he learns, squinting at finely printed newspaper columns preserved on microfilm, that Stark had grown up in the spotlight, that Stark had gone to MIT at the age of fifteen, that he’d lost his parents while barely entering adulthood. It’s probably enough to leave a person high strung, strangely wired. The late — early? — hour when they’d met couldn’t have helped.
By the end, Tony’s once more on the edge of sleep, his body objecting to being kept awake for any reason. He thinks Steve even tires himself out; by the time they’re done, he just uses the bedsheet to wipe them off and collapses on top of Tony, his arm slung heavily over his waist.
It has to be Steve, doesn’t it? Steve, who’d lied during the game that night, Steve, who can’t have possibly ever sucked dick, and yet— and yet, in the comfort of his fantasy, Tony can pretend he’d known the term, that he’d meant it.
“Don’t pick at that,” Tony says, tapping against the sutures with one of his own fingers. Miraculously, they’ve survived. “I don’t want blood on my carseats. Genuine leather.”
Tony makes eye contact with him, his heart suddenly pounding hard against his ribcage. No one else had seen.
He beams at her, suddenly reminded of the fact that they’re getting married. He’s getting married. He’s found someone who loves him enough to want to spend the rest of his life with him, and—
Steve looks a little scuffed up, sweaty, but he’s not holding himself like he’s hurt. The cowl is torn around the eye, a straight tear along the seam, the kind of thing he’ll insist on getting fixed instead of replaced. The gloves are dirty.
Steve returned to the party. Steve joined his little team in laughing, lightly, fondly, at Tony for rushing out. Steve participated in the future speculation brought on by the time travel. Steve helped clean up.
Tony reaches over to fuck with the foil wrapper from Steve’s burger. It’s still covered in grease, the lights reflected and warped in its uneven shine.
“Not around us. His secret identity is a big deal, bigger than the rest of us. He’s involved with both Stark Industries and the team, and apparently it’d screw over a lot of people if it came out who he is,” Giant-Man explains, “so he’s strict about it. Nothing like the Wasp over there, with her face out in the open.”
It’s only Tony, standing a little ways away now, eating a tiny serving of gelato from a delicate little cup. Steve curses himself internally for the overreaction and holds Tony’s eyes.
Steve wants to say, but the words freeze in his throat. Gail had loved him, once upon a time. She won’t understand this. Everyone has a breaking point. He can’t ask her to understand this.
And there it comes again, the little flush, the momentary embarrassment, the upward gesture of the glass towards his lips.
Later, he’ll wonder what she’d wanted, what she would have done if he’d listened to her. Sometimes, he flatters himself, imagines that she’d wanted him, one last time, some kind of farewell present.
Tony sighs and rolls to his feet, grabbing a robe himself on the way over. Steve is still staring at the collection in the closet.
Tony can’t help it. He has to keep poking, to find the holes in something too good to be true. “Why’d you ask me to come here?”
He’s antsy. Banner makes eye contact with him, surprised to see him back so soon, and Tony shrugs and leers at him, the sort of leer that suggests he’d done the reporter in the coat closet. The scientist interests him not at all.
Needing to fidget, Tony rolls Steve’s glove up and then back down,.“Can’t they find someone else to steal from, for once?”
Steve shades with his thumb, smudging ink into the grooves of his thumbprint. It gives Tony a little thrill to know this. He thinks he could love the shadows a man he catches through this connection, could love a man knowing nothing about him expect that he stands shoulder to shoulder with Giant-Man sipping beers he drops, that he draws flowers and shades with the pad of his thumb, that he smiles wide at Iron Man and says, “try that again, pal.”
“Oh, don’t stop on his account,” she says, “not unless you’re aiming for the most misplaced act of charity since—“
Realizing he’d be caught eavesdropping if he didn’t, Steve knocked loudly on the workshop door. Both men looked up at him, surprised.
By the time lunch rolls around, he’s anxious but well-dressed, showered and shaved into the vague shape of a person. He arrives two minutes ahead of schedule and finds Steve already there, sipping on his Coke.
He tracks Tony’s drift towards her, always close without ever stepping into the light. There Tony is, moving on from the bald man to strike up conversation with a short stylish brunette with a teacup chihuahua in a little purse. There he is, the next moment, gesturing with a glass of some sparkling drink by two identical young men with long, horse-like faces and pale eyes. And then, quite suddenly, he’s in the circle of admirers around the sorceress, one hand out to introduce himself.
He forwards the information to the authorities, checks his phone (no news from Steve), and returns to doomscrolling, contemplating his next move.
Tony’s surprised. It’s not as though this had never occurred to him; he’d switched roles plenty of time in the safety of his head. From the beginning of this, though, it’s been Steve on top, Steve pushing and Tony giving. He hadn’t thought this was on the table.
The car comes to a stop. Steve slips out, sets his shoulders military straight, holds the door open for Tony, schools his voice into a rough approximation of what Happy Hogan sounds like on duty. “Mr. Stark.”
Captain America, Tony has long learned, lives by a set of internal rules so convoluted and esoteric that he himself sometimes gets lost in them. There’s the obvious — ladies first, except in combat. Don’t hit a woman, though, in combat situations, feel absolutely free to shoot one. Sex with Tony after combat isn’t gay — it’s team bonding — and sex in Steve’s crummy apartment is somehow less gay than sex in Tony’s plush bed. He’s alright with getting married — as long they find a church to do it in — but refuses to wear an engagement ring which would, apparently, be gay.
The terrorist cell leader is watching him, his eyes eagle-sharp, and Tony can’t write anything at all, can’t turn his arm to reveal what could be either a very out of character flower tattoo or a soulmate imprint, can’t reveal that he has a method of communicating with the outside world, as much as he plans on using it for nothing but a final goodbye.
The problem is, of course, that Tony isn’t the kind of man to run from his problems. Putting this off will bring him nothing but unease, nothing but a sense of shirked responsibility.
Everyone’s fingerprint is unique. Tony learns this watching documentaries on the couch with his feet tucked away under his mom’s warm leg. He’s back home from boarding school for Christmas, and he’s learned to keep to himself when his father is around, to act like he’d been properly hardened up, the way he was supposed to have been, but right now he allows himself this.
“Oh, don’t kid yourself. How many are there as a personal favor to you? How many came out of obligation to you, out of debt?”
And yet he’s gone out of his way to get the attention of Steve Rogers, a man with whom he has about as much in common as an African parrot with a can of sardines. He wants Steve’s attention. If he’s honest with himself, he wants Steve.
It’s communication technology, for the most part, not weapons, but the media, already looking to find possible lines of communication, isn’t going to notice or care. It’s going to be down to Tony to figure out how it had gotten there, who had betrayed him.
Bucky’s standing, his arm outstretched, his face lit up with boyish glee. His hair, overlong, curls slightly under his ears. He smiles with dimples. Steve will remember the way he looks now for the rest of his life. Steve will remember the last few weeks of innocence for the rest of his life.
“What’s all this, then?” Mrs. Roth asks, not unkindly, and catches her son by the hand, “You haven’t been drawing on Arnold, Steve, have you?”
The pain fades, slowly, his thigh throbbing with with every breath he takes. His whole body is on fire, and the world is cold and slow around it. Now, he feels everything at once: the grooves of Steve’s fingers on his skin, the callouses on his hands; bits of drool trickling down his chin where the gag has forced his mouth open, cold and wet; his erection, stiff and uncomfortable against his stomach, throbbing; Steve’s eyes on his face, on his hands, alert and calculating.
That’s not right. That’s a mistake of humongous proportions. The blueprints were meant to be incinerated. When Tony gets home — if Tony gets home — he’s going to have to investigate the possible sabotage.
Hell, Tony doesn’t know why every time they touch feels so surprising to him, so electric. He’d certainly never been the kind of guy to shy away from touch.
They rarely call each other, and when they do, it’s always Steve calling — Tony is a texter. Now, though, his fingers feel thick as sausages and perhaps a little less graceful, and he doesn’t want to make a fool of himself trying to type a message out.
They held eyes for a moment. Tony seemed on the verge of saying something else, but he pushed it down, smiled at Steve once, his blue eyes watering. “Goodbye, Winghead,” he said, Iron Man’s nickname for him — funny, the sorts of things people said in times like these — and took future-Steve’s hand.
“Oh, very much the genuine article, Tony.” Thor sounds pleased to have been asked, happy to explain, “I am God made man.”
He longs to be out on the field with Steve. For a minute, he even considers donning the suit, tracking down the terror cell and taking them down himself. But someone was already on them, long before he’d set his mind to join, and the work he’s doing now — the information gathering, the search for whoever had supplied technology to the bad guys, for whatever else they might have, is work that might just as valuable in the long run.
Tony tells him the story, the woman who’d claimed her father had brought it home from the war, the last remnant of the bravest man he’d ever known.
“Oh,” he says, pleased, and slides over the arm of the couch to sit down next to him, “by all means, then, don’t let me interrupt.”
Steve laughs and cups his jaw, instead, kisses him again, quick and playful. “You give me a second here, then.”
He’ll need something solid, he decides, picking up a thick, hefty leather strap, and then the rest of the kit with it. It’s several layers of the tough stuff, a little overdue to be oiled, too-rigid when he bends it over his own arm.
She takes another step forward, past Tony and into the garden, barely a foot between her and Steve. “— are so full of want.”
“Y’know,” Doris says, pushing her fork into the center of her potato to break it into pieces, “just because he’s your soulmate doesn’t mean you’ll like him.”
There’s a while where he thinks he’s going to lose. Though Steve gets bumped off the edge of the foam cliffs several times, the combination of Alps-related mountain climbing experience and frankly insane upper core strength prevent him, each time, from falling further.
Tony nods. Steve leaves him alone on one of the cots to wonder why this had been better, in his estimation, than Tony’s comfortable, red plush bed, and then to pour over the implications of what had happened between them.
Tony cut the cuffs with some sort of specialized metal saw, and, as they rejoined the other two men, New-Steve set a hand lightly on Tony’s upper arm, walking much closer to him than Steve ever dared.
“Oh.” Tony says, mildly. He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised; she’d gone from cheating with Steve to cheating on Steve, and that’s natural enough, isn’t it?
Steve’s breath catches. The chair creaks, and suddenly, they’re tipping over and falling sideways. Tony catches himself on his elbows. Steve, still bound, doesn’t. Tony grimaces as his temple smacks against the floor.
He’s never called it by its name. No one has ever called it by its name, to him. It’s always been words with a sort of uneasy, low thrumming tension, the negative space around them forming the actual picture.
Stark knows. He can see the handprints, the things unspoken hanging over Steve. He’s thinking a word about him, and Steve doesn’t know which one.
Time seems to slow. Tony feels frozen behind the chair he’s tied Steve to. He’s still fully dressed, his clothes warm and snug, the starched collar loosened by a day’s wear, the black suit a little wrinkled around the elbows. He’s wearing socks without shoes, and they’re a little bit gross, a little bit moist. Steve’s nude, clean body feels like it belongs in a different reality from his own.
It’s the code to open up the briefcase, in case of emergency. Steve nods, short and sharp. Understood.
Tony closes his fingers over the clapper of the bell to make sure it doesn’t ring. He wants this, wants it so badly he feels hollow without it.
The trick to getting away with things, Tony knows, is to just do them. Hesitation, any trace that you
“Well, I’ll ask her to help me pick out the dress,” she replies, without looking from the text message she’s writing. “We can ask them after.”
He fetches his phone and texts Steve. It’s already past breakfast time — eleven thirty-four in the morning — so, deciding lunch is the logical next step, he’s direct, to the point: “Eddie’s, 12:15.” Steve texts back with the thumbs up emoji. Tony’s not sure where, exactly, he’d learned that one.
“The fingers come off,” he says, demonstrating as he explains it, “tiny, tactical zippers. More practical for those of us eyeing the shrimp.”
“Don’t feel very lucky now,” Steve says, grimacing. He’ll heal in a couple days’ time, he thinks. He goes to stand, but Tony’s hand on his shoulder stops him.
It’s possible, he realizes, that Steve is out in the field right now, fighting guys who use his technology to talk. He takes a moment to throw himself a pity party, imagining Steve surrounded by enemy fighters, each of whom is equipped with a front-of-the-line, innovative distance communication systems, by Stark Industries™, and is using them to discuss the best strategies to kick Captain America’s ass. If only their comms would fail, he might have a chance, but, alas, Tony’s technology is just that good.
Steve braces himself with a hand on Tony’s hip as he lines Tony up and sinks down, and Tony, once more, watches his face. It’s brief; Steve’s eyes flutter shut as though to brace himself as he pushes Tony’s cockhead into his rim, and then Tony feels as much as sees that Steve forces himself to loosen up, relaxing each muscle in turn. It’s careful, deliberate; he feels himself, adjusts, and then sinks all the way down, suddenly so hot and tight around Tony that he can’t help a startled moan.
he thinks, with horror. Tony, who’d lied to him, who’d betrayed him, who had planned to betray him again. Tony, who he doesn’t want dead, who he’d once loved, still loves.
He doesn’t have a long time to think about it. Less than six hours later, he plummets into the icy waters of the Atlantic. Bucky must get out of this, he thinks, in some far away part of his mind, as he struggles to keep his head above the water, his hair and clothes soaked through, his teeth chattering, Bucky must get out of this, because he’s got a girl waiting for him, someone he’s connected to so strongly. He doesn’t know if he believes it.
He writes a computer program which identifies matches better than his eyes can, better than the cataloguing system had. It’s a damn good one; a few years later, when he’ll think to sell it to actual police departments, it’ll fetch him a pretty penny.
“You’re drunk,” Steve told him, gentle but firm, “you don’t know what you’re saying, Mr. Stark. Let me walk you up.”
Steve turns down the volume on the television, turns to face Tony, his elbows braced on the arm of the couch. Tony holds his eye, his heart suddenly beating faster.
They’re ambushed halfway up, some forty lava monsters against the two of them. Despite his earlier words, Iron Man fires up whatever weapons he’s got on his gauntlets and shoots at the guards at Steve’s six. Steve finds it easy to move with him, easy to match his rhythm. As he’s almost trapped in some rapidly hardening sort of goo, Iron Man blasts him out, twists him out of the way. Steve learns the other man’s strengths and weaknesses almost too quickly, finds himself able to anticipate every move which his newfound partner launches himself into.
“It’s no use,” cuts in a dry voice from behind him. Steve orients himself to where it came from, and sees a short, chubby figure behind him, leaning against the doorway. It’s a man with a flat, pug-like face, perhaps in his forties, dressed in a dress shirt and pants. He gestures upwards, indicating the handcuffs, “these were designed by this generation’s greatest mind, specifically for you, Commander Rogers.”
Tony Stark is standing just outside of Fury’s office, sipping coffee. Caught in his own thoughts, Steve almost doesn’t notice him.
Their fingers brush. Stark has just come in from the cold; he’s wearing gloves. When their eyes meet, the look is too significant to be natural.
“I didn’t think you and I liked each other very much,” he replies, meaner than he’d intended. Steve watches him for a long moment, his expression completely unreadable. He’d spat out a tooth in the final fight, and Tony can see him running his tongue over the hole in his gum.
He’s of the generation, Tony thinks, when men touched each other more freely. This, sitting on the couch with him, isn’t strange to Steve. They’re friends. Coworkers. Brothers in arms. Comrades — this word, now, makes him think of Natasha. It’s not even Russian, associated with the country through nothing but American propaganda, stereotyped Cold War era film, but she had liked it. Used it.
“Sure,” he says, wondering what the hell has gotten into him — he’s never before had an issue domming, and Steve is a hard man to hurt, “you want me to pick out the equipment?”
“I’ve wanted this for so long,” he says, exactly echoing the sentiment Steve had never been able to admit to himself.
“Tonight. She pushed me to go as quickly as possible, which I think is a good sign. I picked a place nearby where I’d stayed once; large courtyard, easy enough to redirect a confrontation away from people. We’ll go in first and keep scouting for information. Thor and the Wasp will stand by to provide back-up.”
Cap’s still holding his eyes. He’s sober. It couldn’t have been a drunken mistake. Tony can see the fear and humiliation badly obscured behind his shaky, too-neutral poker face.
Steve tips forward on his knees, steadying himself with outstretched fingers on the limo’s carpeted floor, and closes his lips on the head of Tony’s dick. The sensation is sharp and startling enough to be near-ticklish, especially when Steve licks up at the slit.
It makes sense to him. He’s never dreamed anything unusual for a little boy’s dreams; it’s all robots and cars and Captain America. Sometimes, when he closes his eyes, he can imagine a pencil dancing on paper, detailing figures in action, intricate landscapes, delicately shaded flowers, but he doesn’t know whether to add those thoughts up to anything. He’s always wished he could draw, after all, and it’s satisfying to imagine something coming out of nothing.
Steve can hold his breath for a long time. Ten minutes, Tony recalls hearing somewhere, either from Steve himself or one of the underwater training drills he’s done.
“Oh,” Tony said, following him up, and turned back towards the party, “I’ll see you later, folks! Thank you all for this.”
Tony reached up to his own shoulder, indicating the place where an armband would sit. “Hydra. They were Hydra.”
A year in, things haven’t settled. Tony comes home exhausted, his head aching, and when he falls asleep, still in his dress pants and button-up, he dreams of drowning. He’s fallen into water, freezing cold. Chunks of ice are cutting off his air supply, and as he digs his fingers into the ice, he knows nothing will come of it, knows that this will, certainly, be his watery grave. Something pulls at his hair, at his gloves, and he’s choking, shivering, and the water is in his eyes, his lips, his ears, and—
Tony stands shakily, accepts Steve’s arm when offered. He might as well reap whatever benefits this situation provides, for both their sakes; he can’t imagine how much worse Steve will feel if Tony ducks away from the touch.
Sometimes, tinkering with the suit in the lab, he thinks like he’s seeing only one tiny part of a grand picture, a grand design. If he had the time to keep chipping away at it, years upon decades of time, perhaps he’d one day come to understand something.
And then he goes home, lays down alone in his luxurious bed, stares at the ceiling, and tortures himself with it.
Only two days ago, the Hulk had broken his nose, cracked his ribs, pulled his left arm out of its socket. Tony can barely tell; all that remains of remains of the fight are several small, yellow green bruises on his face and his slightly over-careful posture.
Tony hopped down from the counter, stumbling slightly. Emboldened by the earlier touching, Steve took him by the arm, and Tony sagged heavily against him. Still, though, he seemed to be keeping an elbow between himself and Steve, the same strange, protecting-the-core sort of gesture.
Steve hums something that could be protest or assent, a short, amused hmph, and pulls Tony by the hand into the bedroom — he’s the one in this partnership who cares about keeping Tony’s couches clean.
“You wouldn’t be the one doing it,” Steve points out pragmatically, with a take-it-or-leave-it kind of shrug. His voice is gruff with the kind of masculinity he puts on for the women.
Steve Rogers is a shitty liar, but no one, not even his girlfriend, watches him as closely as Tony does once they start playing. Three of them are drunk enough to almost immediately veer into the territory of uncomfortably sexual once they start playing.
“Forgive me, Cap,” he says, throwing him a casual, self-deprecating grin. People have been clamoring to talk to him all night, so, naturally, Tony wants to hold up the person anxious to get away from him. “Thinking like a reporter. I’ve been considering branching out.”
The butler stares at him. Used to Jarvis, Tony expects, hopes, to be absolutely eviscerated by whatever is about to come out of the man’s mouth, but he just nods and retreats to safety outside of Tony’s room.
He knows he’s twenty. He knows there’s plenty of time. Still, he can’t help but feel like he should have gotten further by now, learned more.
“You said you were fine, twice,” Tony says, frowning, “I think that’s what you said last time, too.”
They don’t have time to talk anything, the next time they meet afterwards; they’re leaving to deal with extraterrestrials in Micronesia. Suited up from the start, Tony isn’t on the plane with the rest of the team, but he does tune into the radio comms, and here he hears a clipped, terse Cap, a Cap he’d only briefly glimpsed when they were up against the Hulk.
He doesn’t believe in an afterlife, but it’s nice to imagine that perhaps he’ll join a kindred spirit in death, someone who’d been meant to understand him.
He finds something comforting in the word, repeated until it has lost all meaning. The “o” is now a circle and nothing more, the “s” a slithering, curved line, the “r” a squished check mark. He makes each successive word look exactly the same, the letters perfect copies of each other, and tries to will nothing else to matter.
It’s not the best angle; even when he braces himself against the back of the seat with his elbow, Tony doesn’t have the leverage he needs to fuck down as much as he wants, the space. He gets by, accompanying rhythmic twitches of his hips with tugs at Steve’s hair.
“I suppose,” Steve says slowly, catching the tail end of Tony’s thought, “this is a victory of a kind.”
He was the tiniest bit unsteady on his feet, and, as he left, future-Steve wrapped a casual arm around his waist.
Tony’s driver waits for him in the little black sports car in the corner of the lot. Tony cracks open the back door and takes Steve by the elbow, pushing him inside. As knows to expect, now, Steve just rolls with it, slides inside and buckles his seatbelt.
Someone has leaked the truth about the Hulk. Thor has quit the team. Bruce Banner’s trial is televised, live. Outside the mansion, crowds of protestors wave signs calling for his head.
It happens like this: Steve’s over in Tony’s apartments in New York City, the place that they, by chance, have ended up the least often. They’d had a good night. Tony, pleasantly fucked out and a little achey, asks Steve to fetch a robe from the closet.
tight fitting, thick fabric, clings his chest, his sides, his thick, muscular neck. Steve Rogers is a killer whale among exotic fish, dressed up and performing but no less deadly for it.
Steve inhales sharply, rolling his ankle as it, too, is freed from the chains. The newcomer rises, his hand on Steve’s knee, his eyes still on Steve’s. “He hasn’t let me have this. You know he’s tried to keep us apart, to keep me away from you. I never wanted to blame him, Steve, but—”
Iron Man is just below their helicopter, in the huge hole leading into the underground. Steve knows this long before they land, and he chalks this up to instincts of a man who’d spent the past four years engaged in combat. As the team lands, he doesn’t take nearly as much time to reorient himself as the rest of the team. He spots the flash of red and gold armor in the crowd of faintly glowing lava monsters and launches himself onto the offensive.
It chases him scuttling back to acting, to falsehood. He pulls his keys out of his back pocket and presses his house key to Steve’s neck, cold metal against skin. Steve’s blindfolded; he won’t be able to tell what this is.
It’s Thor’s easy self-assuredness, as much as anything else, that makes him fundamentally less interesting to Tony. Rogers is a strange, intoxicating blend of strength and weakness, self-confidence and anxiety, awkwardness and charm. He’s both younger and older than Tony.
Tony lets go of Steve’s hand and raises a hand to his face, pushing his fingers into the groove of bone just underneath Steve’s eyebrow, watches his eyelashes, uncharacteristically delicate and blonde, flutter shut. If Tony pushed down here, on his eyes, he could really hurt him.
Steve nods back, lets himself flop back, exhausted. He’s already thinking about the meetings he’s missed, the paperwork taking in the new perp, Norman Osborn. He’s already wishing he’d asked Tony to stay, already imagining a reality where he could have.
He’s already forgotten her name for the second time by the time the butler rings to let him know she’s arrived, but that’s not the important part.
“No, I meant—“ she sighs, frustrated. Perhaps he shouldn’t have pushed. “He knew what he was getting into. We— well, they wouldn’t have been in the line of fire in an ideal world, but— this was all because of us, right? And we’re doing the right thing.”
The suit clings to Steve’s body, tailored at the waist. Its starchy collar digs into his neck. Its little pockets don’t feel like enough. He longs for the weight of the shield on his back, for a utility belt around his waist. He longs for the easy stretch of his stealth costume or even the give of his much roomier military formal suit.
If he was a braver man, he’d ask about the mumbled confession in the dark, the two words he’s still not sure he heard. If he was a braver man, he’d let himself hope, knowing he was setting himself up for disappointment — that Steve had been dreaming even if Tony hadn’t, that he must have imagined someone else. If he was a braver man, he’d take the spell as a cue to try his luck.
He’s excited. The fingerprint must amount to something. It must have been given to him for a reason, and he feels, finally, like he’s about to get it.
He traces Steve’s hand with his fingers, feeling the little upward jut of his ulna just over his wrist, worms his fingers under the glove to feel the rush of blood under his skin, to feel his heart beat.
Tony puts a hand on his side to urge him downwards, onto his knees. When Steve reaches for his fly, though, some stab of fear has Tony catching him by the wrist.
The next time the four of them gather in same sitting room, sitting on those same yellow couches, the occasion is far more somber.
One large hand closes around his throat. Another clamps hard over his mouth. Two more grab at his arms.
Tony tucks his dick back into his pants, reaches into the inner pocket of his blazer and pulls out his handkerchief. Steve leans his temple against Tony’s knee as Tony wipes down his face, working in quick, business-like strokes.
“So, so full of want,” she says, low into his ear, in a voice that would be seductive if not for its strange, melodic coldness, “you don’t even know what to do with it. It’s going to kill you, you know, bottling it up and letting it bubble out like that.”
“I’ll take better care of you tonight, dear,” he promises the leather; he’ll never be out of the habit of talking to inanimate objects.
“I guess,” Bucky says, again, but this time there’s a touch of defiance about it. He shrugs off Steve’s hand and retreats, his hands in his pockets, back to his tent.
). He’s built better, built like a soldier, a fighter. He moves right, speaks right. Steve thinks he would recognize him without being told. In some ways, he had.
It was an obvious request for elaboration, the kind of statement too polite to be a question but clearly inching in that direction. Tony set his cake down and picked up his mead.
Steve turns to look at him. The eye contact they make goes on too long, Steve’s pupils so wide his blue eyes look almost black.
“I don’t deserve you,” he says, his tone as low as Steve’s. “Sometimes I liked to pretend Iron Man did.”
She looped her arm through his and tugged him down with her, chattering all the while. “OK, so. I’m gonna be covering his eyes, which is gonna be hard since he’s too tall for his own good, so you’re gonna have to get all the doors and catch us if we fall, chap, are you ready for that? I’m sure you can bench-press us, so—“
He imagines Lucy getting his message, wants her to. Maybe she’d turn around on it. Maybe she’d love him, like grown-ups love each other, and tell Doris off for talking about him like that.
Steve’s still standing there, leaning against the doorway. When Tony passes him, he follows, his hands in his pockets.
Something about this rankles Tony, just a little. Natasha had never known Banner particularly well, of course. Natasha, her reputation already shrouded in shadow, has less invested in the team’s PR, the way people see the Ultimates. He’s never seen Natasha cry, has never seen her particularly upset over the loss of human life on missions. It’s never bothered him; she’s action girl, grizzled and used to combat, hidden behind the tough exterior.
The newcomer glances down, seemingly focusing his attention on freeing Steve’s other ankle. “He— he didn’t want me around anymore. He didn’t like how close I’d gotten to the team. He didn’t like how close I’d gotten to you.”
They’ve moved away from SHIELD. Tony strikes up a contract to use some of the training rooms, the simulations, but since Nick Fury is one stingy bastard, when it comes down to it, he ends up building most himself. The team grumbles, as they always do, about having to attend training at Tony’s black sites in New Mexico, Montana, or, God forbid, Nevada, but Tony thinks the quality of care only improves.
his ass. They’ve been running into each other far too often these past few weeks, like Steve has purposefully mastered his patterns, like Steve is trying to put them on collision course.
When he wakes up, the first thing he’s aware of is that someone had taken off his suit jacket. The dress shirt he’s wearing is soaked with water and sweat. He’s cold. His left shoulder is pressed against something warm, and, feeling a faint pang of pain under his ribs, he leans closer to the source of heat and smells Steve’s aftershave. They’re in seats, side by side.
The guy doesn’t look particularly worried. This, Tony thinks, must not be a new kind of arrangement to him. He probably had needs, in the army. He’d probably slept with men behind Jan’s back. Hell, maybe he was sleeping with other people right now, and Tony wouldn’t know it.
His mood firmly glum now, Tony sips his gin and tonic and entertains himself by expanding the metaphor. Jarvis is some kind of aquatic snail, ever present in the background of his life steadily cleaning up small messes as algae blooms in the background, bright and toxic. The gaggle of reporters remind him of schooling fish, tiny but oddly menacing in large numbers. And the man they’re talking to —
Steve reaches up, his fingers tracing along Tony’s hairline. His eyes are soft at the edges when he looks at Tony, fond.
She gives it to him, though he’s sure she thinks the request is some kind of confirmation he’s stepping out on someone. Instead of punching it into his phone, she leans over and writes it on the inside of his wrist, one of her curls brushing against his lips and wafting over a familiar smell of coconut almond conditioner, the same one Natasha had used.
“Well,” he said, in the kind of calm, measured voice he used when speaking to TV crews, low and trustworthy, “Maybe I’ve moved on to other projects.”
And then he stares at his wardrobe instead of the ceiling for a while, feeling like shit, craving something — alcohol, maybe, though he can’t stomach the idea of trying to get more down, not now— and he doesn’t even know what he’s thinking when he pulls out his phone and calls Steve.
Here’s Tony’s problem: he’s an extrovert. When given the choice between going home alone and not, he’s always going to choose the former.
As he makes his way out of the mansion and follows the card’s call, he finds the Avengers waiting for him; the Wasp, already tiny and fluttering around Giant Man’s shoulders, Thor spinning his hammer by the handle, his helmet ajar.
“So,” he says, even though he already knows, “what’s with all this son of Odin stuff, anyways? Are you really the genuine article, or just a big, scary man with a hammer?”
writes Tony, his anxiety roiling hard in his stomach, another layer of unreality settling hard upon his shoulders,
This particular day, emboldened by the show, he pushes. “But we could find out whose it is,” he says, “if we just check.”
After that night, both of them get busy at once, and for weeks Tony does nothing more than text Steve the occasional overworked nude picture with the bags under his eyes carefully filtered out. Steve, for his part, pursues terrorists on the other side of the country, replying to said texts at the few hours of the night when Tony happens to be asleep.
He undoes his own fly, surprised surprised at how hard he is already. Steve’s watching silently, his eyes intense, eager, near-black. It’s not the darkness.
He pulls down his shirt, revealing the gleaming red of the chestplate. Steve had to have seen it to have plugged it in, but maybe he just doesn’t understand.
They try the usual things. Tony, having experimented with many a partner, shows Steve the handcuffs and blindfolds, runs through the motions of establishing safe words.
The blood loss will kill him within minutes if the brain injury hasn’t already. He’s not breathing. Tony has to be realistic.
“The armor’s on the desk,” he points out, nodding towards the briefcase. “If we can get to it— but I don’t know how. Guess we’re bait, now.”
When Steve’s twenty, and looking to enlist, he figures out it must be a girl who works at one of the factories. More and more gals are stepping up, these days, and he dreams of machinery, wires and metal plates, well groomed hands and long fingers neatly slotting delicate pieces of metal into place.
He doesn’t hear Steve comes up. Steve’s big, calloused hands close over his wrists, and as Steve shoves him back against the mattress, he gives a choked gasp and pushes back, kicks out automatically.
It’s all too easy to lean in and close the distance between them. This kiss is different from the illusion he’d kissed in the hotel room, where he’d felt pulled along with a tidal wave, his whole body on fire after one kiss, spiraling wildly out of control. This one is soft and sweet. He knows who he’s kissing.
Tony’s eyes are on the screen, but he can feel the siren call of the heat of Steve’s body. If he were only a few inches closer— he leaned over, would Steve stop him? Would Steve leave?
“You have mail, sir,” he says, jokingly, in a too-posh fake British accent, like it will somehow endear him to Tony.
Rogers hasn’t eaten. Tony is half expecting a loud, cartoon-like stomach rumble, but he’s disappointed; Cap just shrugs, his face a little pinched.
Tony wonders if he’s self conscious. He’s young, underneath it all. He could be the youngest person in attendance; he’s at least a decade younger than most of the crowd. Tony himself, boy genius Tony, PhD-before-eighteen Tony, too young for the tumor in his brain Tony, has five years on this man.
He smells Steve’s aftershave before he’s registered that Steve’s arrived. It’s simple, clean. Soapy, almost. He sees Steve’s hand and Steve is wearing a blue pattered shirt with white buttons.
Wasn’t there a quote about this, two deaths? Hemingway, he thinks; the first death when a man’s heart stops beating, and the second the last time his name is spoken? He must be witnessing this second death right now, taking part in it. He must be, he thinks, the last person to speak Steve’s name. It’s odd, to feel a sense of connection to this man, only a few years older than him at the time when he had enlisted, probably nowhere near as skinny as Tony is picturing him, to mourn him, but Tony takes a moment to feel both of those emotions anyhow.
“Listen,” he says, once Steve’s burger is mostly gone and Steve’s mouth is full, “meds mixed weird with alcohol last night. If you don’t ever bring it up again, I won’t.”
They don’t talk sitting in the car, waiting for the hour and change until the time of the meeting. If this was Iron Man, Steve would suggest stopping by the diner a block away. He’d get a burger — he’s still hungry, not having been able to partake in the pork roast — and Iron Man would drink a milkshake through the slit of his faceplate. Perhaps they wouldn’t talk much, but the silence would be companionable, easy. Or perhaps it’d be Steve talking — Steve telling stories from the war, from his childhood. Iron Man is a good listener, though he never says much about himself; his boss, he’s always said, forbids that kind of talk.
He had been drunk, but no more than drunk than he was for most of his sexual encounters. He’d been far more plastered during the battle with the Liberators. His inhibitions had been lowered, perhaps. Perhaps he’d been a tad looser than he would have been otherwise. But Steve hadn’t been pushy, and Tony had called the shots. It doesn’t feel like a drunken mistake. It doesn’t feel like Steve’s idea.
He wonders if Steve and Janet will follow them, once her divorce is settled. Sure, he can see the fissures in their relationship from a mile away, the subtle ways that they rub each other wrong, but that’s never stopped anyone from getting married before.
Iron Man crosses the room, taking hold of the briefcase, but stops, looking back to Steve. “He’s changed the passcode,” he says, “I need you to tell me what it is.”
Steve takes both of his wrists in one huge, white-knuckled hand. Normally, Tony doesn’t feel like Steve is much bigger than him, but right now, Steve feels all-encompassing, like if Tony breathes too deeply they’ll run of space on the bed, in the room.
“No, no,” Steve carefully removes the glass from the top of the helmet’s display case and pulls it out, examining it casually, none too shy about just
“Take off your tie and blazer,” Tony says. Steve doesn’t question it, shedding both. He’s neat, even now; he folds both and sets them gently on the seat he’d vacated.
One of the soldiers breaks away from the group, following him, and, zooming in, Tony can see Steve’s abject dread at the prospect of returning to the group. He leans hard against the truck for a moment, and then straightens up, heads back into the crowd, and gives a speech.
Steve takes it. The card doesn’t say much — he’s only scrawled “Sir Ian McKellen” over the top. It shouldn’t mean anything to anyone but him.
Tony blinks at her, a little sleepy. It occurs to him he’s barely said anything in the latter half of the night, too caught up in his own thought. Had he even said goodbye?
When they fuck, Steve has his hands on Tony’s hipbones, his thighs, the back of his neck. He tangles fingers in his hair. He peppers kisses along the inside of his leg, traces the curvature of his muscle with artist’s fingers. It feels warm, loving, safe, and yet something about it leaves Tony deeply insecure.
Because he likes her, he makes a show of stumbling. She laughs, rolls her eyes, takes him to lunch. He likes her. He wants to know who she is outside of the costumed, size-shifting hero he’d met, wants to know if she’s got a family she’s coming home to, if she works somewhere. The degree of separation that her secret identity imposes between them isn’t extreme, but it’s tangible, always there. He knows there are things he can’t ask her.
It’s not wrapped, and slightly dusty, the same box it had been in when he’d bought it. Unreadable sharpie still clings on to the tape that had once been used to seal the box.
“Oh,” Tony said, looking pleasantly surprised, “Thank you. Yes, er. And you’re— wait, don’t tell me.”
Tony, he realized, was shaking slightly. “Yeah,” he said, a little too fast, panicky, “Yeah, I think I am, I got there, and—“
One day, after training, as the team is headed for the rec room, Tony tags along. He generally doesn’t; the pizza provided after these occasions tends to leave him feeling nauseated and bloated, and he’s always got four other things on his plate.
The map that the card shows him, the summons, is crisp and clear, Stark’s technology. After their confrontation, Steve can’t help but feel a little nervous, a little uncomfortable, at the thought of putting so much trust in Stark.
“I’m tired of living a lie,” Steve says, into the mirror, the way he practices every speech he has time to, “I’m tired of people like you having blackmail material on me. Everyone has a breaking point, and— well, people don’t even care anymore. Sir Ian McLennan—”
And here’s his chance. Steve can roll with it, profess his feelings to be entirely platonic, and move on with his life, leaving things how they are.
“Well, we’re about to land, so I’ll suggest you start doing a whole lot less of that,” Giant Man says good-naturedly.
