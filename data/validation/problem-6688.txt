“I think Steve wants to be the one to have the honor of being your first, though,” Sam said with a wink before flat-out tackling Clint to the dirt.
away from Tony’s.  Steve was leaning towards him, easy open smile and warm, understanding eyes, approval leaking from every pore.  Tony wanted to pull him closer, and feel this embodiment for heroism pressed against him.  His voice was low, intimate.  “I have to say that you are right.  Who your father is does not determine who you are.”
He was surprised to see his mother and her women assembled in the room, silent and veiled as they sat on the hearth.  He could not approach then for fear of soiling them, but beneath her lavender veil, he could tell his mother was smiling.
“I’ll make you personalized coffee mugs,” Steve offers, lilting, teasing tone in his voice as he pulled Tony unfeasibly closer into his chest.
.  This thing has no fucking AC.  I don’t do hot.  Well, I am hot, let’s face it, but I like the air to be 70 degrees and dry.”
The bed shifts as he sits, removes his shoes, then he stands, shucks his clothing off.  The clang of his belt buckle is inhumanly loud.  The shift of sheets, and the gust of cold air his Tony’s legs.  But he’s already frozen.
Nat scavenged up a couple of cans of ginger ale and a Hawaiian Punch in the dinky mini fridge.  Rhodey opened a ginger ale and set it by the key board.  Together, they eased Tony back in the office chair, with Rhodey massaging his shoulders and Nat gently rubbing his temples.
.  Sure, a few monsters had shown their ugly faces, but aside from the Attic Boar and the Argive Bull, nothing had posed a threat to any major population.  There was peace and plenty.
It was an odd question, and oddly pointed. “Well, I have my secretary who runs my life and nags me. My chauffer who is also a sort of personal assistant. Oh, and a butler who takes care of my parents' old house, but it’s not very often that I’m there.”
“You’re missing the point.  There’s no throne.  There is no version of this where you come out on top.  Maybe your army comes, and
.  He just lay there, pinned by Steve’s arms and legs and eyes, watching as Steve fucked himself on Tony’s cock.
all while he hasn’t taken a shower, so there is that faint scent on his skin, of sex, of Steve, of everything he wants and nothing he can have.
Steve, he hadn’t taken into consideration that he might have grown a beard – smiled.  “Yeah.  For exercise.  Then everyone got used to seeing me every day.  Now I’m like some sort of watchman.”
“Check palladium levels.”  Tony pricked his finger on the blood analyzer.  He plucked a bandage from beneath the desk as JARVIS read out the results.
they would spend years circling and pining and convincing themselves it was all wishful thinking, when it wasn’t. It was Steve actually staring at Tony in wonder and love, and not just admiration.
Quite suddenly, she gasped dramatically, and dug her nail sharply into his biceps. “Oh, darling, but did you have to pick car number thirteen?”
There was a body, pressed against his own, lined up perfectly, like matching cogs in their track beds.  There was a deep-seated contentment in his bones, like he’d gotten something he’d desperately needed.
Inside, the room was in the traditional layout: throne against the right wall, hearth in the middle.  The wooden columns were wound with wreaths of summer grass and flowers, adding a sweet scent to the slightly stuffy room.  Several tables were laden with platters of bread and roast meat, and there were baskets of fruit, dishes of vegetables and olives.  Four couches were set in a between the four columns at the corners of the hearth, making a circle around the fire.
Tony had tried to argue that it was only the first week of Summer, that no one did any kind of school work until at least a month had passed, but Jarvis hadn’t bought it. It hadn’t helped that Darcy had started getting upset because she was forced into classes with private tutors five days a week, irrespective of if it was technically the holidays or not.
Tony was pulled away from the loud thumping of AC/DC on his CD player by the noise of his phone ringing obnoxiously. Leaning back from where he had been tightening a bolt, he reached over to push the pause button on the player before rolling on his chair over to where he had last seen his phone. Hunting under a mixed pile of metal scraps and papers, he found his Nokia 9000 Communicator, which he slid open to answer, ears ringing slightly in the deafening silence of his dorm room.
Any further speculation about abnormally large insects was interrupted by the arrival of Clint and Bruce.
Steve shifted where he stood on the rocky ground, his practiced eyes trained on the shadowed surroundings as his crew slowly lugged the cargo they had been entrusted with closer to their ship.
“Lies. What’d you want, anyway? Much as I enjoy talking to you, I have an assignment I was working on and you totally killed the roll I was on. I was in the zone and everything,” she brought the conversation back on track.
Tadamori wasn’t a particularly big planet, nor one of much consequence to the rest of the ‘verse. It was, however, always hot, with the rainfall count measuring one day every few years. Due to the unrelenting heat of its two-day rotation around its sun star (Earth-that-was time), any and all structures were dug underground. The towns themselves were identifiable only by the series of mound entrances rather than bustling streets. Rumour was that the planet had been abandoned by the USC after they realised how inhospitable it was; however – like a weed – people had raised their families and set up their lives in the heat. The planet was, however, semi-known for the stones that could be minded out from under its crust. Once dyed and polished, the stones were often used in costume jewellery due to their intricately patterned reflective surfaces.
Steve waited until they were set on an orbit of the planet before motioning Clint and Natasha to follow him from the bridge.
“You told him stuff about me?” she gasped; rounding on Tony like she was a kid again and Tony had offered to tell her crush of the week that she liked them.
It was rough, and not particularly attractive, but Tony was incredibly proud of himself for such an accomplishment. Darcy may not properly understand computers and mathematics like he did, but he was sure she would appreciate the way the robotic dog reacted to outside stimuli - that code had taken him almost a week to perfect, without any bugs leaving the poor thing with its jaw hanging open.
Apparently, dating Steve, aka Captain America, aka the leader of the Avengers, now meant that Tony had no way of escaping the debriefings after battles. He didn’t appreciate having to sit for hours in a room with Fury, as the man nit-picked his way through the entirety of the battle. If the man had such a problem with how the Avengers went about their business of kicking ass and taking names, then he should go out and fight the bad guys himself.
“Attention USC cruiser, this is Steve Rogers, Captain of The Avenger,” Steve spoke clearly, mouth hard as he stared through the glass at the government ship.
“How’d you know where I was?” Tony asked after a long moment of just breathing slowly, mindful of his ribs.
Steve waited patiently as Tony winced slightly at the contact, before he relaxed again, the numbing agent no doubt taking effect almost instantly.
“No more water for a bit,” Steve reassured him, leaning back in his seat and shifting his legs to get more comfortable. His right leg bushed up against the mechanics beneath the table as he settled. A quick glance at the man from the corner of his eye revealed nothing more than a small smile on his face, one which Steve wasn’t entirely sure hadn’t been caused by the seafood.
It was a little odd, he supposed as the elevator smoothly rose towards the communal floor for the Avengers in the Tower, to use an elevator as a method of getting from one floor of ones ‘home’, to another. But, there was no way Tony was about to attempt going anywhere with the emergency staircase, that would take significantly longer and definitely cut into his coffee time.
“If you insist, Sir,” Jarvis finally said after a moment of silence in which Tony had been half convinced (half hopeful) that Jarvis would refuse the request.
“Should we be concerned that you seem to have jumped to affectionate nicknames so fast?” Natasha asked, eyebrow quirked.
The robot in front of them had suddenly reached out and clasped onto the hem of Tony’s shirt, thankfully on the side Darcy wasn’t leaning against.
Walking through the airlock area, Steve moved into the cargo hold and over to the control panel, where he pushed the intercom button.
They had been through a lot lately; Tony, himself and the crew. While the mechanic certainly seemed to dance to the beat of his own drum, he really hadn’t done anything that would jeopardise Steve’s crew. Where Tony was concerned, there was a remarkable blankness to his past. He’d told them about the Ten Rings and the horror that was being captured by them, the insertion of the glowing blue light into his chest and what it was there for. But, Steve didn’t know anything of his life before his capture a few years ago.
Replacing the Captain America box, he pulled open the robots one and selected one of the larger band aids. Dropping the box back in the open draw, he carefully peeled off the backing and stuck it over her scrapped knee, making sure that the white spongy bit covered the scrap like Jarvis had taught him.
So even if they occasionally came across a half polished table leg, the polish container sitting on the floor with the rag still in it, completely discarded, they just put it away for the moment as they knew the next time Tony needed something to clean, they’d point him in the right direction.
When they arrived on the communal floor, Tony only had long enough to glance around and take note of everyone already being there, before Darcy was in his face, her hands reaching for Sparky and a high pitch noise emitting from her throat.
“How’d you like to keep helpin’ us from bein’ dead in the sky?” Steve blurted out, much louder than he’d intended to.
When it was clear that Steve wasn’t going to say anything else, Tony went over to stand at the opposite end of the table to him.
After a moment, Steve let out an annoyed huff before surging to his feet, hands gripping Tony under his thighs as the genius keened, hands tightening around Steve’s neck. Turning around, Steve lowered Tony onto the couch before pulling roughly at his jeans and underwear until Tony was completely bare, cheeks flushed, chest rising and falling, legs parting willingly as his dark brown eyes stared up at Steve as if this was the only thing Tony had ever needed. Quickly undoing his own pants, Steve pushed away the unwanted clothing until he was nude as well before climbing onto the couch so that Tony could wrap his legs around his waist, Steve’s arms keeping him from crushing the smaller man as he immediately went back in for the delicious skin on Tony’s throat.
“Oh wow, did you make sure to thank him for teaching you all this stuff?” he asked, thinking that Jarvis was taking something of a gamble with teaching his well-meaning, but loose tongued sister the secret ingredient in his Super Secret Ingredient Chocolate Cake.
His suspicions had been nothing compared to the reality of the situation. To have it confirmed had been awful enough, but for the full truth to have been revealed to him about the man who had always been there for him, more often than his own father. The man he’d placed his own trust and the shared responsibility of raising, of protecting, his baby sister.
Darcy wasn’t screaming or crying at him. She didn’t even look upset. Instead, she had a small smile on her face, something gentle in her soft, green eyes.
“You’ve lost, Doctor Traveller. Do as the lady says,” Steve’s voice was all Captain America, no room for disagreements.
He smiled sheepishly, knowing that things had been up in the air with the whole Iron Man and Stane thing when Doctor Banner had decided to return to Culver University. If Darcy had still been at uni, not taking time off because he was kidnapped in Afghanistan and then creating Mark I Iron Man, she probably would have seen the green giant herself.
Steve trailed after the mechanic as he suddenly made a beeline for one of the stalls, bits of metal catching the light beneath a tattered looking tarp. By the time Steve reached Tony's side once more, the man was already rapidly speaking to the vendor, dexterous fingers flittering out to touch and poke at various pieces of machinery.
Steve knew the name Tiberius Stone. While not the richest or most successful son of a business man who made his money wherever he could, there was always plenty to hear about him in the social gossip channels. He was definitely not a man without scandal, the rumours about his exploits with men and women were an often talked about topic when Steve visited Core planets market places.
“I’ve never seen one in its raw form before.” Steve admitted turning the large diamond in his hand so it caught the light.
Besides, he had a super soldier suit that still needed adjustments. If it just so happened that he planned on using the adjustments as something of a bribe to get Steve to relax a little bit around him, well, that was no one’s business but his own.
Yinsen gave him a contemplating look before he nodded slightly, as if he truly believed that there was a fraction of a chance that Tony could get them out of this alive. That the future Tony could now see in his mind had a chance in hell of become a reality.
“The ship’s secure, and we all know to meet back here before sunrise tomorrow,” she said, voice sounding perfectly at ease.
“Uh, Cap, you might wanna break up the reunion, they’re startin’ to attract a lotta local attention,” Tony suddenly said, eyes on the growing crowd of people staring at the spectacle.
The two managed to walk quietly in the direction of home for another few minutes when a distant light finally greeted them. A low lying flat spread out between them at the edge of the forest and a large mountain wherein their home was located in the hollowed out centre.
“Stay safe,” he called softly as he watched her feet disappear up the stairs, leaving him in his workshop.
“Darcy said she has a surprise for me,” Tony said, glancing once more at his sister who was staring intently at the small screen where the floor numbers were ticking down.
“Let’s find the main control room, we might be able to restore oxygen levels if nothin’ else,” Steve directed Thor, who nodded mutely, eyes trained on their surroundings as he hefted his gun.
Steve walked down the cracked pathway of what counted for the main street of Zyskin, absentmindedly perusing the various shops they passed as Tony kept up a running commentary beside him.
“Trust me, Steve. He likes you, a lot. Just ask him out for coffee.” Then she was walking from the room, leaving Steve alone in the kitchen with a crumpled newspaper and a pile of dust-free plates.
He’d been people watching as he waited for the return of his crew. The main port on Planeta Stark was bustling with people, mostly tourists, though the huge cargo ships occasionally flew overhead and blocked out the afternoon sunlight as they made their way to the cargo docks further towards the North of the planet. He’d been trying hard not to think about what he’d seen in that small courtyard. While it was true that Tony had definitely gained their trust, and was dedicated to the crew, Steve still felt the distance that was not knowing his past, like a cloud that hung between them in conversations.
“Exactly, we could see those sights right now,” Steve lent closer to Tony’s bemused face, warming to his own idea. “Just us, a couple of guys’ seein’ whatever there is ta see.”
“Problem solved,” he shrugged, aiming for casual nonchalance, but he was pretty sure he achieved awkward simpleton instead.
, that no matter what you think, or what some psycho mutant may want you to think, we like you, just the way you are. You’re not alone, Tony; and you are extremely deserving,” Steve emphasised his last words by reaching out and taking Tony’s hand within his, giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Good. Darcy was serious about that StarkPlayer, by the way,” Tony couldn’t keep the amusement off his face. “She’s been complaining about it since you seized it; said you gave Jane back her research, but you’re keeping the StarkPlayer hostage,” He continued, pointedly.
“I wouldn’t have so many people to look out for,” Natasha said softly, Russian accent unusually thick in her voice.
“If you want to know what I’d do,” Tony finally said, looking up at Steve. “I’d take what we can use and stick the rest in the airlock and blast it back into space. Having this much around, it’s bound to cause problems.”
It would make sense, certainly more than his current life did anyway. Tony knew he was a selfish man, and his father had been a drunk. Tony tried not to indulge too often, but what was too much these days? He could very well be a functioning alcoholic and not even realise it. He was reckless and careless too, cashing his car into a tree sounded like something he would do. Not to mention, becoming Iron Man had been like finding salvation, that was three years ago, when the accident had happened. It had seemed like too perfect of a way to make up for all the horrible things that he had done. What if it was all just a dream, something his mind had conjured up to alleviate some of the guilt he felt. He was a terrible enough person that his mind would be twisted enough to pull such a thing off.
Steve turned back to Natasha to ask where she’d last seen Thor, when there was a dull thud, followed by Tony letting out a squawk before a crashing sound filled the air. Spinning around, hand resting on his gun instinctively, Steve let out an exasperated sigh at the sight of Tony sprawled over a luggage rack, the large suitcase on the ground he’d tripped over was peeking out from the bottom rung below him.
“Darcy and I get along well, we have many, what did she call it?” he looked thoughtful for a moment before snapping his fingers. “Gossip sessions,” he said the words with the air of one who didn’t quite know what they meant, but had been repeatedly told that they applied to the situation.
“Totally awesome, big bro,” she let out a small laugh before quickly ducking over to him for a short, tight, hug.
“Captain Fury informs me that you and your crew are extremely efficient, Captain Rogers. However,” her eyes finally drifted to Tony and stayed there, Steve’s spine straightening automatically at the perceived threat. “I was not informed about certain members of your crew that will cause something of a… problem.”
“Keep moving, Iron Man. You must be close to Doctor Traveller,” Steve said. The, ‘because you’ve found a bloody and disgusting version of pick pocketing,’ went unsaid.
If nothing else, this whole experience had taught him how essential Tony had become in his life in such a short amount of time.
“Among other things. Primarily, they’re used as a scapegoat for people who aren’t ballsy enough to kill people off themselves. If the price is right, they’ll agree to make someone disappear, though killin’ them outright is rarely their objective. They control a series of battle ready spacecraft that circuit out in the Rim. At least one of the ships is used primarily for human experimentation, another for endurance exercises. They sell the knowledge they acquire from their
Darcy had sat next to him throughout, wearing a dark blue dress that was covered in sparkles. Her hair had begun the night up in some fancy formation neither Stark sibling had bothered to learn to pronounce, but by the time the dancing began, it was mostly hanging down around her shoulders in waves.
“I met these two guys, not like that,” she shot Tony a bland look, causing him to snort and put his hands up innocently as if he’d never been thinking what they all knew he had. “Jack McGee, he’s part of the campus paper.” Tony made an unhappy noise in the back of his throat.
“Oh, you be quiet,” Tony chastises. “We’re also working on a big surprise present, if you must know. Plus, I simply enjoy pestering him about his continued refusal to just quit his job.”
Steve, the total Boy Scout that he is, comes to knock on the bathroom door to let him know they have five minutes, now. Tony deems his appearance as good as it’s going to get, and opens the door.
Steve is there, looking radiant with a red boutonniere, the chosen color of the wedding. He breaks into a dazzling smile when he sees Tash, coming to give her a hug before she takes her position at the back of the line. Tony and Steve are walking together right before her, as the best men, and the rest of the bridesmaids line up how they’re supposed to, arm in arm, two at a time.
Except that doesn’t happen. Steve swiftly asks Sharon about something regarding her wedding dress, if she’d tried it on after the alterations, and then everyone’s off and chatting. Natasha reaches over the table nonchalantly and clutches Tony’s hand, squeezing it tightly while contributing to the conversation all the while. The uneasiness leaves his body like a deep exhale.
“In my defense,” Tony tells Sharon, “it wasn’t an easy road to get here. I was supposed to do the practical thing with my life, but I was basically kicked out of my family’s nest like a baby bird without a guardian angel to tell me how to handle it.”
“I know, I’ve missed out on so many extra days of Tony time,” Steve replied distractedly, looking at the price of some kind of glow stick necklace. He frowned, and slid it back onto the shelf, apparently having deemed it far too high.
“Just come here,” she snaps, patting the chair set out next to her. “Take my mind off all this. Tell me why you and Carol left the rehearsal dinner.”
Steve sighed. “Maybe. Let’s just- which of these do you like better?” he asked, pointing to two flowery balloon designs.
The bachelorette party of the century, according to Tony, is being held at a little restaurant by the docks that’s entirely open-air, with only a wooden lattice overhead intertwined with blossoming red flowers and vines. Tony and Steve get there early to set up, because they rented the place out for the night, and start stringing fairy lights and pushing tables to the side where the caterers can set up all the food. The two of them argue over music selection for a while, but eventually they have a playlist set up on Tony’s phone, which he hooks up to the speaker system and puts on shuffle.
When Tony sees Steve standing all by himself over by the drinks table, cradling a Coke bottle in his hand like a lifeline, he waves him over enthusiastically. Steve shakes his head, but Tony stomps over to him determinedly. “This is a party, Steve. You don’t have to chain yourself to the sidelines, no one’s gonna want to go out on the boat until it’s dark. Come dance.”
“Well, I have an iron, but I don’t have an ironing board. I just do it on the floor, I have hardwood.”
As summer gets closer, so does the wedding, and Tony is given the elusive Steve’s phone number from Sharon so they can start coordinating bachelorette stuff. The first couple times he tries to call, it rings endlessly and then dumps him at voicemail, with no recorded message from Steve himself, but rather just a robot telling him what to do. Tony hasn’t left a voicemail in years, he hasn’t even really called anyone in years, so he hangs up and just vows to try again later.
“Me, you, Sharon, and Tash are doing brunch with Peggy today; I hope you like seafood because this is Boston and we’re seafood people here.”
Normally, Tony would be abhorred by the idea of doing anything touristy in Boston. He doesn’t care about the supposed history, although certain websites do their best to make “maybe walking on the same street some dead white guy who signed the Constitution walked on” sound riveting. But when he proposes the idea of the aquarium to Steve the next morning, when they meet up in the lobby of his hotel so Tony can get free coffee from the breakfast bar, the guy looks so excited he might vibrate out of his skin.
Natasha was there when the whole getting-disowned thing went down. Rhodey had just enlisted, and Pepper had moved back to Malibu, but Natasha was there. She held his hand when he first told his dad that he was gay, and helped him find a cheap apartment and easy part-time job when it became apparent that he was no longer welcome to his billion-dollar trust fund and wouldn’t ever be again. It’s unspoken between them that she’ll never bring it up if Tony doesn’t first, since it’s still sort of an open wound. But he knows that she gets it, because she confessed to him, once, that she hasn’t spoken to her family since she was sixteen and doesn’t care if it stays that way forever.
When Tony heads to fetch Peggy from the airport, lunch ready in the car because she’s flying in from London economy class and there’s no way that’s an enjoyable experience of any kind, Sharon and Tash tag along despite still having a hundred things to organize before Friday. A lot of hugs go around when they meet her at baggage claim, and even Tony is squished tightly into her open arms.
“I think we did pretty good,” Steve says, hushed but loud enough to be heard over the pop music playing.
Tony sets five alarms the next morning, and he is not late picking Steve up from the airport. He knows what Steve looks like, because Sharon showed him pictures-- and, actually, he’s kind of exactly Tony’s type with the whole tall muscular blonde thing going on-- so Tony waits in the baggage claim terminal until he spots him by the carousel spitting out bags from the New York City flight.
Thankfully, Bruce had said it was just a nasty concussion, with a lot of blood for show. The suspiciously boot-shaped bruises on his ribs had made Steve’s blood boil, but cracked ribs healed.
“More we’re just over this planet now. It’s pretty small and there’s really not much to do here. If you guys are headin’ out after the festival, we’d definitely be interested in catchin’ a ride with you - for a price, of course,” she added, sunny smile still in place.
“Oh, we’re here,” she suddenly exclaimed, once more grabbing onto his arm and almost bouncing on the balls of her feet as the doors opened.
“I also happen to have it on good authority that there is someone there who’d love to meet you,” he added, thinking of Darcy’s face if she got to meet the man she’d all but idolised for the past few years. Honestly, the girl had some weird ideas about what made someone worth fangirling over.
“A question has been plaguing me for some time now,” Thor suddenly said, breaking the comfortable silence that had fallen over the crew. “How did you already know Miss Rumiko, Tony?”
“You clearly know your way around an engine,” Steve started, nerves starting to tighten in his gut. “We ain’t been able to keep no one whose as close as good as you. And you didn’t feel the need to have a stay in the Bughouse after all the crazy on board, or to tattle to any USC soldiers about our ‘extra’ work,” Steve chuckled humourlessly at his own words.
Tony didn’t even appear to have heard the others entre, he was still at the sink, the continuous muttering accompanied by the repetitive wash, rinse, stack in the dry-rack routine.
“Don’t worry, Jarvis and I totally hooked them up with a brand-new motor oil can each,” Darcy stage whispered, bursting into loud laughter when the excited beeps and pleased whirls from all three bots made themselves known.
“Again, our sources are sure that she is still here, being held captive either within his wing of the estate, or at the small laboratory his company owns here on Aquamarine.”
Once Tony had joined the crew officially, he’d made a point to be friendlier to the rest of the ships’ occupants. Bruce, in particular, seemed to be the focus of Tony’s endeavours and Steve often found the doctor with an almost fondly exasperated look on his face while Tony talked a mile a minute, following him around like his personal shadow.
“Gonna fix that. I’ma invent somethin’ amazin’ to stop the prob’lm.” Tony murmured with a small smile.
“Yeah, I could go for something to eat,” she nodded, pushing herself to her feet and reaching out to give his hand another small squeeze before releasing it and stretching her arms over her head.
“I worry that you’re mostly concerned about your music playlist rather than the danger you were in.”
Heading for the cargo hold, he guessed Tony would either be looking through his liberated toys, or in the engine room putting said new toys to use. Despite the oddity that was Tony and his unknown past, the man was an extremely good mechanic and genuinely cared about the ships engine. Steve would have wondered if there was some kind of strange fetish going on, if Tony didn’t also flirt consistently with anything breathing and mechanical alike.
“Rumiko and I met a few months after I started travelling solo,” he began, voice soft. “It was completely by accident that we met on a small moon rock called Isla Suerte, it has the most beautiful beaches and the sand is periwinkle pink. I had nothing but a few credits to my name when I stumbled across a beautiful woman sunbathing.”
“All good?” Tony asked suddenly, having walked up to him with Darcy when Thor and Jane had departed.
Steve thought Bruce and Jane would get along well. Glancing at Tony, Steve could see he was curious about her profession and was just about to settle in and patiently wait for them to go through the ins and outs of it, when Darcy suddenly reached out and slapped at Jane’s arm.
It was just as he remembered seeing it last. The ear was bent and the tailed snapped off, long gone by now. The curve of the metal he’d spent hours working over formed the creatures body, and the bulky jaw still stuck out, slightly too big for the size of the head. The small dings in the metal where it had crashed into the wall all those years ago were still there, but the camera lens in one of the eyes was now cracked.
“What the fuck!” Tony yelled, trying to push the archer away from him without actually touching said ass.
Tony took the object on autopilot, mind reeling at the words she was saying, at the honest looks on everyone's faces, no matter which one he looked at. They all said the same thing.
“Yeah, sure, no problem. I’m not sure how exciting it will be down here, but you’re welcome to stay for as long you want. Is the couch okay, or would you like some desk space?” he asked, already looking around the workshop for somewhere he could move projects off desks so that Steve would have some space to work.
Steve felt the corner of his lips twitch upwards slightly, but further conversation was halted by the sound of the overhead speaker sparking to life and Clint’s worried voice filling the air.
The intergalactic war had been hard on many planets and their people. The government had fed everyone a steady diet of misinformation that, until it had been too late, Steve had blindly followed. He’d believed so much in the honour and justice of the government, that he’d signed up to fight those that were resisting. He had risen in the ranks, right up to the command of Captain, without questioning anything.
Tony had a moment to be utterly charmed as he could remember the exact thing happening years ago but with a stuffed teddy bear that had refused to sit upright at the tea party table, when the bot suddenly let go of his shirt. The pistons in the arm moved as it turned its camera face towards Darcy, beeping in a way that almost sounded excited.
Glancing around, Steve weighed up his new mechanics right to privacy, and his own curiosity with his ships safety to concern himself with as well, before giving a sharp nod. Clint made short work of moving the rocks and revealing the book buried in the shallow hole.
"Yeah, yeah. Tell your pilot to engage the forward motion thrusts on my count. We’re gonna leave that USC ship in our space dust.” Tony sounded positively gleeful, and Steve had a moment to wonder again just who, exactly, he had on his ship.
Steve had been hopeful that they’d be able to catch a wave or two from the planets as they passed them, any kind of job that would not only offer them some credits, but give them a sense of direction. Drifting was all well and good, but not a way to feed a crew or gain a sense of purpose. He was beginning to think that they’d have to actually stop off on the planets themselves to get some work – always a bit of a risk when you didn’t know what you were landing into – when they came across something drifting in space.
Of course, being sickeningly romantic wasn’t all they did - Clint’s choice of words, not Tony’s. Life continued on outside, and their happy little bubble burst three weeks after their first date.
Silence settled over the two, the comfortable kind where neither felt the need to talk, and Steve politely didn’t comment on Tony’s ragged breathing.
Securing the helmet in place and taking one of the two laser guns Natasha held out to both of them, Steve pulled the heavy airlock door open and the two stepped into the small room. They closed the door behind them securely, only a series of small square windows showing them the remainder of the crew on The Avenger, before Steve reached for the other ships door and opened it carefully.
High school wasn’t all that hard, Tony thought as he jotted down the answer to the accelerated curriculum mathematics work he had been given for the Summer holidays. It wasn’t like he really needed to do this stuff anyway, it was all so easy. He’d much rather be working on building a robot or furthering his code writing ability. But, Jarvis had caught him when he’d been helping Darcy with her breakfast that morning and told him, in no uncertain terms, that he wasn’t allowed anywhere near a socket wrench or a keyboard until every piece of his Summer schoolwork was done and proof had been shown to the butler.
Tash turns him to face her. “You’re my best friend too, Tony. I… If I hadn’t met you, I don’t even know what my life would be like right now. But I know it would be worse without you in it.”
Because Tony is a sane person and knows he doesn’t need to get ready for the rehearsal dinner until right before they have to leave, he also decides to mess around with one of his works in progress. It’s sort of for work, but also partially for his own edification; he wants to create a new alloy that’s virtually indestructible, for use building robots or machine parts that need to not be easily breakable. So far, gold-titanium has shown some promise, so Tony loads up the statistical scenarios on his computer again-- which has, of course, been modified to suit his own desires, because Apple can’t make quality shit to save its life-- and starts to fiddle with them, inputting new parameters and running the tests.
“Duh,” Tony grins. “Double bachelorette coming at you. Who’s Steve, and why does he get to be called best man while I’m ‘bro of honor’?”
When it’s finally his turn, he climbs in with Maria, Carol, and Jan, who was fashionably late as always, with her new boyfriend in tow. Tony thinks his name is Hank, and it’s clear he’s perfect for Jan the second he hands over his phone for her to take pictures with, as her own is perpetually out of storage.
“I forgot to mention,” Sharon says, after they’ve stuffed themselves and planted their butts into the couch for the night. “I finally got a hold of Steve, after literal weeks of phone tag. He works way too much, and he hates his job, so I don’t know why he won’t quit. But anyways, he says he’ll be my best man, even though he can’t get up here before the wedding weekend itself. I told him it didn’t matter, that Tony would take care of me too. Right?”
Peggy orders a mimosa, and Tony tenses up just the tiniest bit. He’s responsible for his own sobriety, he knows that, and after a couple failed tries he’s now on a good streak, no longer feeling like his chest is going to cave in if he doesn’t have a drink when he gets stressed out. But it’s just… easier, if he doesn’t have to think about it at all. Natasha hasn’t even kept vodka in the house since Tony finally committed to staying sober, and she’s Russian.
“Okay,” he sighs. “You were completely right, I have a crush on Steve. Carol was pulling me out of panic mode, ‘cause I realized it in the middle of dinner.”
“I totally didn’t have any of that written when I came this weekend,” Steve says. “It was last night at the rehearsal dinner, after you left, that it sort of all came to me. I was talking to Sharon, and I guess she sort of-- saw something, on my face, and then before I knew it I was spilling my guts to her. And she gave me really good advice, and then I got to thinking about all the other times I would’ve been lost without her, and the rest sort of spiralled.”
“That’s because it’s dumb to make appointments to talk on the phone. God, it’s like you live in 2005. Do you need help with that bag? I hope not, because you look like you could bench press three of me, and I build robots to pick things up for me so that I don’t have to.”
First, Sharon makes a speech thanking everyone for coming, with a few funny anecdotes thrown in about how hard it was to plan all of this, with everyone scattered across the globe. She speaks about how happy she is to share this weekend with all of them, and Tony catches Natasha looking up at her with shining eyes, like she’s staring right into the sun. It’s an expression of pure adoration and love, one he’s noticed on her face often when she’s around Sharon.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says immediately, and it somehow doesn’t sound cheap, coming from him. “I’ll say something uncomfortable too, if you want. Even the playing field.”
Natasha is as poised and regal as always coming down the aisle, completely steady on her feet and holding a bouquet of soft pink flowers. There’s no one escorting her, because she doesn’t feel the need to be escorted, instead, going alone proves that this is a decision
when he mentioned a new best friend, which in a way cements Tony’s theory that Steve has only platonic feelings for him. But he also talked about finally making the choice to try and make a career out of his art, something that Tony knows scares him so much. Steve is making the choice to be brave, to do something risky, on the off chance that it’ll work out and be the best thing he ever did. Tony remembers Natasha’s words, and suddenly, he’s overcome with the urge to talk to Steve.
Conversation between them the whole day is easy and lighthearted. They point out things around them, mostly sarcastic comments on Tony’s part, and every now and then it drifts to their personal lives. Steve tells him about his best friends Bucky and Sam, who he lived with up until a year ago when they fell in love and then finally moved out, to both his disappointment and relief, as he stopped having to put in earplugs at nighttime.
“That’s a lovely image,” Tony snorts. “Well, even if he is, there’s no sign that he’s interested. We’ve only talked about things other than the wedding, like, twice. So it’s not as if I’m interested either. But please don’t set me up with anyone.”
“Hmm, sure. I can think of something. Do not expect me to arrive before ten, though. I’m serious. Don’t call me at what you consider late morning, a.k.a. sunrise, and ask where I am,” Tony instructs.
“That might be a good thing,” Tony jokes. “If it was in a museum, I would never go see it. This way, I can enjoy it every time I go over to Sharon and Tash’s to pester them.”
“Correct, and it’s going to be fantastic, our shared brilliance has put together what is quite possible the bash of the century.”
The decorations are a Tony and Steve joint effort from a trip to Party City they took after brunch earlier, despite how Steve complained the whole time about his artist’s instincts yelling at him for purchasing flimsy paper streamers and aluminum balloons rather than doing something more creative and personal.
“At first, they were two completely different people, Natasha in particular not really willing to open her heart to anyone. They had that spark, though-- they mutually hated the Skrulls, this little local college band I dragged Tash out to see one night. Everyone in the crowd was a fan except for the two of them, and it was at that moment that their process of becoming, truly, soulmates, began. I’ve been lucky enough to watch it all happen, and I can’t wait to see what they’ll do together next. I love you guys.”
“Sharon, I have no idea what my life would be like without you in it to set me straight, and I guess I’m still not sure why you picked me. I am so, so, beyond grateful, though. To be able to share even some small part of your life, has been the greatest joy of mine. And when you inevitably run into marital troubles, because everyone does, you are more than welcome to come to me and ask for advice-- even if you don’t take it, since you’re smarter than me anyways.”
Inside the main building, the dining hall and adjoining suites have more of a lodge feel to it, complete with walls built from large stones and big chandeliers of some poor animal’s antlers. Tony remembers being kind of put off by that when he toured this place with Natasha, but she said the rustic feel was what she wanted, because it reminded her of Russia a little bit, and even if she left her old life behind, having some part of it at her wedding would be a good way to symbolize the new life she’s about to begin with Sharon. It was all very touching.
Tash’s fiance, Sharon, is super likable. They do trivia night together a lot, and she’s the only person Tony’s ever met who didn’t immediately ask how he could be five years sober at twenty-five years old when she came with their friend group to a dry bar for the first time. She also makes really, outlandishly good brownies, which is a character trait that Tony appreciates on any person, but specifically on someone who regularly sees him crashed on Natasha’s couch after a bad break-up.
“I wasn’t late, Steve,” Tony says, pointedly ignoring the hand. “Acknowledge that I wasn’t late and apologize for assuming I would be, please.”
“No, that was a one-time thing, I guess. You’ll have to convince him to finally free himself when he gets in tomorrow morning, mom. He always did have a soft spot for his Aunt Peg.”
It’s a couple weeks before Steve finally picks up, but still not before a reasonable number of rings. “As I’ve said before, I’m Catholic, so I’m really not interested in becoming a Jehovah’s Witness,” he says, not giving Tony a chance for a word edgewise.
So basically, he’s really happy that they’re getting married, and he’s going to do everything within his maid of honor powers to make sure that his girls have the greatest weekend of their lives. Even if that means following Natasha around Sears for seven hours on his day off from work while she tags things for their gift registry.
“Here’s to living your best life now, then,” Tash announces, getting up and then returning from the kitchen brandishing three spoons and a carton of ice cream like trophies.
Tony turns on the loudest, scream-iest song he can find, and nudges the volume up as far as he dares, but Steve barely flinches. As much as he pretended to hate Tony’s taste, he actually doesn’t seem to be all that bothered by it.
“Glad to be helpful,” Steve said, then paused, thinking for a moment. “I miss her too. We hung out all the time when we were little. Our moms would make the most British dinners ever, like bangers and mash British, and we would play soccer outside while they cooked. Sharon always had to pretend to run slower than she really could ‘cause I wouldn’t be able to keep up otherwise.”
Steve shakes his head in silent laughter as Jan launches into an explanation of why nice guys are the worst boyfriends, much to Hank’s confusion. The boat stops, suddenly, and Tony turns in his seat to look back at the city. It glows golden, almost blinding, reflecting off the water and highlighting the glass skyscrapers that would be practically invisible if not for the hazy light of the street lamps and search beams coming from the tops of buoys further out in the water.
Tony sputters at him. “I’m not little, Rogers, I’m compact. Besides, you can hardly talk, Sharon’s shown me pictures of you guys when you were little. A swift breeze could have pushed you over.”
“I live in Boston. You live in New York,” Tony says, as plainly as possible. “I want to be your boyfriend, but--” he shrugs, “--that’s gonna suck, won’t it?”
“Oh, I’m Tony, your fellow bro of honor. We need to talk bachelorette party; firstly, are strippers a yes or a no? Tash would love it way more than she acts like she would, I promise.” Tony knows his best friend well, and he sees straight through the hardass, unfeeling, joyless mask she puts up. Natasha cries during animated Disney movies, and would absolutely die of laughter if a stripper started getting all up on her.
“” Yes I do!!”” He whined, pulling out his big boy wallet. “” Cheeseburgers are twenty cents each! I want two so that forty cents, and regular burgers are fifteen cents and I want four so that sixty cents added thats a dollar! Then I want two cokes and fries! Thats about another dollar when you add the tax! Here!”” He pulled out a fiver and thrust it onto the counter. “” Take the money! Please, I want my food!”” He stomped his foot a bit and pouted out his lip. The woman looked shocked and just numbly handed him back his change, starting on his order.
“"Charlie died some time around when I was 14. He was 15 years old the poor boy. I was 17 when i got out of college, I started working with Obie. Jarvis and I were closer than ever, and then Howard insisted on driving home drunk killing Maria and Jarvis who were in the car with him.”” He sighed deeply emotion filling his words as he spoke of Jarvis.
“” Yea, I eventually found a bus stop, but by then it was probably midnight, it was snowing in sheets, the busses had long since stopped running-“”
George frowned and looked out the window. “” Just be careful Tony, Ill keep an eye out, you just need to be weary with strangers okay?””
“” Im sorry Henry… I was grounded until the news stopped running the story… Howard didn’t want me coming to work with him where people could see me and I could make him look worse…””
“” We talked for hours. God, at least until it got dark. I ended up being late to get back to the office. Howard had to stay behind an entire seven minuets. Oh he was pissed.””
“” I just go by Tony”” The boy smiled as he started pulling things out of the bag. He set a little cup on the ground, filling it with the water for Charlie before setting two of the plain burgers on the ground for him.
“” Um… No George… I was um… Im not going to eat here today- I promise I’ll tell you about the comic later!”” He quickly added not wanting to lose his friend.
“” Oh hush.”” He grinned, warmth blooming in his chest at the praise. “” But um.. oh yea, George was talking about how he lost his tenant upstairs and me with me big mouth, I blurt out “ Why not have George live there!” It made perfect sense to me. We both had both been working the store all year, Charlie was the mascot, it was all great. And it worked. George had Henry move in the next day, made a deal that as long as he kept helping out in the stood like he was, then he would have a warm bed and food to eat. I was already splitting whatever my dad gave me with him.. It all was perfect.””
“” Anyways, Id run off for lunch just so I could get out of there, and as long as I showed back up some 15 minuets before dad was ready to leave, he would never notice I was gone. I actually started leaving five minuets after he gave me my money in the morning and left to do whatever it was he did in his lab. This was the age of Vietnam war, everyone was pissed for no reason at the soldiers, everyone was high on life and weed, and the streets were a hell of a lot safer for a five year old. Doesn’t mean I should have been on my own like I was, but I don’t know, I had already built a circuit board and I had been left alone mostly all my life. I didn’t think twice about walking alone along New York without Howard.””
“” Hmm?”” The billionaire hummed absentmindedly, hands linked with Steve’s as they walked along central park, ignoring the occasional paparazzi’s camera flash.
“” Um…. I want um… two cheeseburgers with everything on them, but ketchup- gross! and um…. four just plain ones with just the burger and bun. Oh! And fries! And two Cokes and a water bottle!””
“” Of course you are! Now, how would you like to hear a story about how Charlie and I fought in ‘Nam?””
“” Steve- Hunny, its okay, it was a long time ago- you’re squeezing me- I stayed there for the night, early in the morning a cop drove by and saw me, drove me home… Howard and Maria hadn’t even noticed I was gone- Jarvis had the day off so he didn’t get in until six am that morning… It was a huge scandal. I still have the news papers. “” Stark kid wanders of at night- found lost the next morning.”” God forbid Howard take credit for his fuck up. Actually… thinking back, I bet he didn’t realize he left me. Im sure he trout I really had wandered off. The newspapers had a field day, he got drunk, thats how he handled it, and he beat the liven shit out of me… It had never been that bad until that point… Babe. Im okay- stop squeezing meeee-“” Tony whined, squirming a bit. “” Im really okay Steve. nothing bad will happen. You’re here to protect me.””
“” Yea. I don’t like them. You need to stand real still and be on your best behavior while they take pictures or us. I have to be really good so I don’t make dad look bad and get in a lot of trouble again.””
Steve’s smile spread ear to ear. It was one of the cute ones that made his eyes light up like a kid in a candy shop. “” I would love to meet him Tony. “” He let their hands entwine as Tony led them across the street into the shop.
“” He was a homeless veteran.”” Tony let go of his hand suddenly bristling. “” I figured Captain America would appreciate that.””
“” Bye Mrs. Daine! “” The little boy grinned as he pulled on his jacket, checked his pockets for his money and ran out.
“” Cars? Nonsense, one would hit us and the rest would stop, besides, we’re Iron Man and Captain fucking America, no one will hit us.””
“” I want to hear about them.”” Steve smiled and pecked his cheek. “” I wanna hear about your life before you were mine.””
Tony ran into Henry’s arms sobbing. “” He left! Henry he left without me- I don’t know how to get home- “”
“” Mister Tony, Im Henry, It is very nice to meet you,”” His dog barked and he laughed. “” And this is Charlie, he likes to be included. “”
“” He reminded me of an old friend.”” Tony tangled their fingers back together, a wistful smile spreading on his face. He wasn’t used to this whole relationship thing, not needing to get defensive at the slightest thing.
“”” I eventually started going to school. I hacked the computers so during the first year the bus dropped me off right at the store. Then dad says enough with public school, Im getting you a tutor. I don’t want to hear it anymore the shit about “Oh Howard the eight graders are all mean to me cuz Im only six- can’t I just go to kindergarden!” “” Tony shuttered at the thought. “” I only asked that one once. So I did the whole homeschool thing and every day I would have Jarvis drive me here to George’s where I was a full out employee. It was great for a long time. I worked there any second I wasn’t building or getting tutored. I went to MIT when I was 15. I stayed with Henry most vacations, visited Jarvis and showed up to any photo shoot I was required to go to. Most of the time Howard and Maria were drunk and violent, I didn’t want anything to do with them. Maria got herself lost in the bottle. I never knew her well, She was just there when I got in trouble or when we all needed to pose for photos.
Hi, why the fuck do I keep getting kudos on this? I wrote this when I had just barely turned 16. As of 6/2/19 I am hoping to completely re wrote this entire monstrosity. I promise I will leave the original as the second chapter but by god do I not want people to think this is the work I produce. I've never been a great writer but this is SHIT. Im hoping to get this done and out by 6/30/19, maybe I'll even wait until that exact day. I'll give you an actually decent version of the story on the 5 year anniversary.
“” Thats George’s. Best kebab around. Next to it used to be a little burger joint and next to that was an ice cream place. They all had apartments on top, and it was a really nice place back when I was a kid. “” He pointed off down the street. “” One of the original office branches for SI was down there a little ways, it’s long gone but at the time it was my dad’s pet project. Every day he would drag me along to that damn office. I’d either get to tinker in the back or I was sat down in a chair to sit and wait until lunch.”” He groaned and rolled his eyes dramatically. “” Every day though he would hand me 30 bucks to eat, sometimes more.”” He chuckled. “” Depended what was in his wallet. Now mind you, this was ’75, $30 was worth-“” He thought for a moment. “” Like $130 and some odd cents. But he was rich so 'here son, leave me the fuck alone, go to the streets and stay out of trouble. Don’t get mugged, I don’t have the time to deal with that.”” He mimicked his father chuckling darkly. Steve just hugged him closer and kissed the top of his head.
“” He is very nice Henry. I like dogs but I can’t have one, dad says they ruin everthing-“” He giggled as Charlie padded over, the dopy shepard thrusting his head into the boys lap to be petted. “” Hello Charlie! You are very nice!”” He squealed as the dog licked his nose before curling up at his humans feet, nosing at the greasy food bag.
The woman was looking at him with wide eyes. “” Kid. Go find your parents. You don’t have the kind of money to pay for that-“”
“” I was in wars you know. I was in them all so I met a lot of good men, and I think you are very much like Steve Rogers. You bought me lunch, it was a very great thing to do, and you are sitting here with me today to talk, so that is great. “”
In all seriousness, to everyone who has red this and given kudos, thank you for giving me 5 years of smiles when I receive an email stating you care. This is for you guys.
Steve just smiled. Tony was so happy here with this man. There was no haunted look in his eye that he seemed to follow him after flying into the portal two years ago. Clean up was finally over. They had a moment to finally just be happy. Be happy here in a little Greek shop in a bad part of town. A small shop the help pictures behind the counter of a young boy, a old veteran, a shop owner in the prime of his life, and a dopey but beautiful German Shepard.
“” Jarvis got it for me… I ripped the other one by accident…”” He looked miserable at the thought. “” I didn’t mean to… “”
“” He dragged me to the car, took me home and beat the shit out of me. Oh don’t give me that face Steve. You know full and well corporal punishment was very much legal.””
“” Of corse Mr. Tony. You don’t need to come in every day you know. Have fun young man- ah! Here! Take some cheese to eat and share if you meet someone who needs it too!”
“"George was nice to everyone. You could be a homeless nobody, a Vietnam soldier, or a five year old and he wouldn’t care. He would welcome you in and sit you at one of his stools and give you some soup and good conversation. Depending on how much you needed the food determined how expensive it was. God, kindest man I have ever met. Every day I would go in and we would chatter about the war, or the newest Captain America comics- oh shut up Steve, I’ve just always loved you, back to the story. We would talk, and he would make me whatever was the special of the day for just a quarter. “”
“” Who the heck did you meet when you were 5 Tony?”” Steve sat next to him and smiled, looping his arm over the mans shoulders to pull him a bit closer. They were in a crummier part of town, most of the shops boarded up and abandoned. Tony pointed to the one directly across the street, a little Greek shop called George’s. The windows were dirty and cracked but business was still going, a pedestrian walking in every so often.
Henry cursed under his breath about that damed Howard Stark as he held the boy close.  George walked in holding Charlie on a leash, rushing over.
It was cloudy out, promising rain, and Mr stinky pants Dave was in the booth, so he hurried on past to get to George’s for lunch. He liked George. The man didn’t treat him like a baby, making sure he referred to Tony as Young Man, or Mr. Tony, and he always had some feta to sample.
“” Hello Mister.”” Tony smiled up at the man on the bench, puttying the bag of food down so he could climb up and join him. The older man smiled and looked over.
“” Oh… um…”” He frowned. “” I um.. like to build things… I built a circuit board last yer but I know it can be a lot better… Dad wasn’t very happy with it… Um… I like Captain America… Did you know dad knew him? He did and dad says he’s the best guy to ever exist and one day maybe I can be sorta good like him… but Im not allowed to be a soldier because I need to build weapons and stuff for the company… I think maybe I can be sorta good like Steve Rogers…. Then maybe dad will like me…”” He set his burger down, sadly looking at his feet. A warm arm pulled him into a soft embrace.
“” No- I-I- I have money- I’ll take the bus- Im sorry for coming back- I um need to go-“” He whimpered shrinking away.
“” Oh Tony, it is really really nice of you to do this! There is no need to be worried!”” He smiled down at the dog happily munching on the food, jumping a bit as a burger was thrust under his nose.
“” There was another huge scandal when I ran out of my parents funeral…. George called me to let me know that Henry had had a massive heart attack and I needed to get there soon before we lost him. I got there on time… He was 81, lived a good long life. “” He wiped a few traitorous tears from his eyes, sinking into Steve's embrace and enjoying the comfortable silence just watching George’s store and letting the chilly air nip at them.
“” My dad gave it to me! He doesn’t care what I do in the day as long as I leave him alone and Im good when the reporters are around!””
“” The begging of the story Steven! This bench 1975!”” He plopped down on the old metal bench and patted the spot next to him, motioning for Steve to sit.
“” I also have cheese. George makes it! He is really nice! He always gives out soup to people who need some! “”
“” Ahh, a man of my own heart.”” He bit into the burger and moaned in pleasure. Tony put a coke next to him, pulling out his own to take a sip. “” I also got a cheeseburger “” He grinned. “” And french fries! Then I got two more burgers for Charlie so he can have dinner- and you can have this!”” He pulled out the $10 bill. Henry looked shocked, gingerly taking the money.
Despite everything, Tony felt himself beginning to drift off as the characters on screen had their ‘epic fight/misunderstanding that will only be resolved by admitting our crazy love for one another and either expressing that through teeth-rottenly sweet moments or crazy, crazy hot monkey sex'.
"Is everything ready?" Steve asked, glancing up the ramp at where he could make out a few new supply crates sitting in the cargo bay.
Tony stared at the dark screen for a moment before snorting as he shoved his phone back into his pocket.
Suddenly, Clint was pulled away and Tony blinked up to see that Steve was holding the archer with one hand, an eyebrow raised.
“I think I’m a little bit in love,” Tony said, unceremoniously throwing himself into the free seat to Steve’s right, brown eyes alight and focused on the Captain in a way that made something in Steve’s gut curl happily.
The late afternoon light seemed to fade quickly from they sky, and people began to gather around a central pile of wood off to the side of the main festivities.
Tony fast-talked around Pepper, quietly pleased that she hadn’t lost her touch in the months he’d been… gone.
“Tony certainly isn’t flying with us just for the joy of working on the Avenger’s engine,” she said with a smirk, before walking past him, headed for her bunk.
Tony went quickly to Darcy, pulling her from the room and moving down the hallway as fast as her smaller legs could go. The threat of their father following them was at the forefront of Tony’s mind.
When he’d finished, Tony looked about the area for a moment, before dropping the rock and turning away from the small graveyard, heading in a roundabout way back towards the main street of the town.
It had been a busy few days once Tony had recovered enough to stay awake and aware for more than short periods of time and Bruce had allowed him to return to his room rather than stay in the Infirmary for monitoring (or, at least, Tony had needled the doctor until he'd given in). Steve had filled the mechanic in on more details of the rescue mission the crew had launched with Pepper's help. How they'd smuggled him back out of the mansion and Pepper had stayed behind to cover their tracks.
Hearing years’ worth of trauma condensed into a few sentences didn’t make the story any easier to hear. Steve knew Tony was trying to distance himself from what had happened by not getting into the specifics and, for now, he was content to let him. One day, Steve hopped, Tony would come to him and tell him the full story, would feel comfortable and strong enough to share the burden with Steve.
Tony had lost count of the number of times he’d seen Steve in various places around the Tower, sketch book perched on his knee or a table top, hand moving with a grace Tony usually associated with dancers. It sometimes slipped his mind that Steve had been an artist before becoming a soldier.
“Sir, I hate to interrupt your colour contemplations, but Captain Rogers is requesting entrance to the workshop,” Jarvis broke through Tony’s thoughts of how the metallic colours would wear in the publics’ hands, much better than those stupid pastels his competitor had used on their phones, that’s for sure.
They’d been having this argument off and on all morning. Ever since Steve had announced at breakfast that they’d be stopping on Planeta Stark for supplies, a new glass window and some extra pieces to help out The Avengers’ ever problematic engine, Tony had been in a foul mood. Snipping and snapping at everyone on board, he’d raised the issue with stopping on the planet with Steve four times now.
Instead, the barrel that had been against his skull was gone and a crashing sound made it clear that his would-be assassin was now on the floor. Natasha calmly took a step into the room, gun turning on Traveller himself, and Tony was willing to bet the half metal guy behind him was dead.
