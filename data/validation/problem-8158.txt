‘No kidding,’ Sam mutters.
‘Go away or do some weird magic mojo to help me,’ he grumbles.
Bucky can feel himself panicking again, then there’s a sharp pain in his head. ‘Ouch! What was that?’
‘Group games not your thing?’
‘Putting small decorations on a tree?’ Nebula clarifies.
As always here's your sneak peek:
Tony tilts his head. ‘I said you have free run of the facility. Go wherever you like. I wouldn’t suggest leaving the facility grounds just yet; I’m not sure how the public will react to you and we are, technically, not supposed to let you wander off.’
‘Oh I can take you if you want, Matt,’ the man called Foggy says to the blind one next to him.
Stevie, I can’t… I can’t see him like this any more than you can. We need to get him out of here.
‘Promise me you won’t kill anyone Deadpool,’ he says, looking back at the mercenary.
‘If I tell Mom you’re keeping me from making friends you’re going to be in trouble,’ Shuri sing-songs.
‘That’s the thing about kidnappers, they look like normal people. So if you aren’t here to kidnap someone I guess you’re here to gate crash?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Uh oh,’ he says as the alien realises what has happened and changes the arc of the swing, barely managing to dodge out of the way. Hearing screams behind him, he turns to see some civilians ducking down out of the way of the pole. ‘Steve there’s too many civilians still here. We need to take this brute somewhere else.’
A/N: And that's your double update folks! Hope you enjoyed it, please do let me know what you think about the story so far and where it's going.
‘This is going to be a fun trip,’ Tony smirks at him.
‘We’ll see,’ Matt cuts across him as he throws his things onto his sofa and then heads to his room.
Hammer just laughs. ‘Whatever you say, Anthony. How about we give your friends a little call?’
‘You know, sometimes I wonder why you’re considered a genius,’ Steve huffs. ‘Now we going in or what?’
help of course; but I’ll hear you out at least.’
,’ Tony sighs, uncrossing his arms as Peter shuts his mouth again and swallows. They’re all quiet again for a few moments. When Tony speaks again his voice is quieter, but still firm. ‘You know everything that happens when you have the suit on is still recorded right? It’s just as a precaution in case something happens to you, we’ve got something to go on. I don’t watch any of it, Pete, I just wait for your reports from the patrols and listen to them instead. You know why? Because I learned I had to trust you to handle yourself, and trust that you would come to me if you needed help.’
‘You’ve avoided catching him under the mistletoe because you’re scared that when you do you’re going to have to face all these things you’re avoiding. So you’re trying to encourage him to get back with Nat because you think they’d be happy together and it gives you a reason to
‘Just be yourself,’ he reminds him. ‘Now let’s go have some fun.’

kill me if I let you become a superhero at fifteen. Or a superhero in general.’
back.’
‘What other ones are there apart from charity work?’ Peter asks.
‘I know,’ he grimaces, ‘we’ll just have to do what we can. Hopefully the big looming threat will help with that. Not that it’s making me any bigger a fan of having to work with Dumbledore and Gandalf.’
‘Because I might understand what it’s like for things to not work out like you intended.’ It’s not the words that stop him shooting the web and swinging off.
‘I can assure you,’ Loki steps in front of Tony, his Asgardian armour slipping into place, ‘that Odin ensured I answered for my crimes against your people. I can do nothing but ask for forgiveness and a chance to atone for my actions.’
‘Fair point.’
‘What we’re not allowed to have a conversation now?’ she demands.
‘Steve don’t be a boring bastard!’ Bucky argues
Sam studies him quietly for a couple of moments. ‘You’re going tomorrow night aren’t you?’
‘What kind of memory did you work through?’ Bucky asks. As Tony’s shoulders tense he quickly adds. ‘I mean so I know what kind of memory might be a good place to start from?’
He shakes his head. ‘I don’t want to tell him until he’s finished studying; he shouldn’t be getting distracted from what he wants.’
‘Of course!’ August falls into step next to Loki, with Tony on his other side, and the three of them lead them towards the dig. ‘I’ve already given instructions for lights to be brought in but if you need more do let me know.’
He squeezes his eyes shut against the traitorous wetness that springs up at those words. Nodding, rather than confirming it aloud, he merely says, ‘I want my family home.’
‘What do you mean you have a “thing” going on?’ Rhodes asks.
‘Oh shut up and come on,’ Peter grumbles, pushing through the thickening crowd to reach his mentor.
‘I like this human, can we please convince him to come on to the team? It would be much more entertaining, and less tedious.’
you, Baby Boy; and I don’t need your super-sister’s freaky mind powers to know what you’re thinking at least
Glancing to his left Steve can’t help but smile. Peter is out for the count, curled up against Tony’s side, the genius has one arm around him, hand reaching up to trace absent-mindedly through the boy’s unruly hair. The inventor looks up and rolls his eyes. ‘Not a word, Rogers.’
‘Well,’ Peter tries not to look guilty, ‘I may have convinced him to remove the no-kissing part of that rule.’
‘Lower the shield,’ T’Challa says into his comms unit.
‘Stop!’ a voice commands, as Bucky raises his metal fist. The dark-haired man pauses, stepping back and lowering his arm. Taking the opportunity to check on his teammates Steve looks around and sees both Natasha and Clint in similar positions to him. The appearance of the Winter Soldier had thrown them all off kilter.
Wade pulls him into a tight hug and Peter buries his face in the man’s hoodie, he feels the scarred cheek rest against the top of his head. ‘I wish I could promise you the world, Baby Boy,’ he answers quietly, ‘but all I can do is promise to do everything I can to keep you safe and make sure you’ve got your team by the end of all this shit.’
‘Wong, why don’t you go back to Kamar-Taj and see if you can get some more help from there?’ Strange suggests, also not looking away from his patient.
Wanda takes a few breaths and then holds out her hands, red light dancing along her fingers as she prepares the largest containment field she can easily maintain. She gives Tony a nod and he presses the button to set off the bomb.
‘Yes,’ she replies, wrapping her arms around her waist, ‘and of myself.’
‘Tony-’
Loki returns the hug. ‘Thank you, Tony.’
‘He shouldn’t be going in alone,’ Steve frowns.
The Avengers Christmas Eve dinner is a noisy affair, which includes a lot of mock-arguments, teasing, shouting, name calling, food throwing, laughter, and even at one point a full table drum roll during one of Thor’s stories. Valkyrie, Natasha and Loki had a knife throwing competition, that Natasha won, and was only stopped going on to a second round by Steve complaining that they’d have to re-plaster
‘Me? I’m the gal who’s going to teach you all you need to know about magic, dearie. After all, they really didn’t do a good enough job of it the first time around. Honestly! You just cannot get the staff these days. And once we’ve solved the problem of your lack of education, you can be an even greater asset to us than your friend there.’
‘Oh yeah!’ Clint grins. ‘I think your exact words were: don’t let anyone call me, FRIDAY. And then she asked about Pepper and you changed it to: don’t let anyone other than Pepper call me, FRIDAY.’
‘So you think Thanos is on his way here?’ Tony asks.
Tony chuckles softly. ‘Yeah Loki said the same thing.’
‘I let someone who is willing to help me protect this city run around yeah,’ he replies, taking a few steps towards the man. ‘Who the hell are you anyway?’
The UN is attacked, and a heavy price is paid.
‘I know, it’s just-’
‘Now you’ve got
‘That’s not what I meant,’ Bucky hurries to add. ‘Sorry, I meant – man I’m shit at this. What I meant to ask was: you have experience with mind control right?’
‘Bucky, come on. You’ve just heard how much time we have, we can’t afford to waste any more. I
‘Tony get to the goddamn kitchen,’ she interrupts him.
‘This…it’s not really a Christmas present,’ he admits, holding the small box in his hand and moving towards the bed.
A/N: Please don't kill me. I love you all. Please do let me know what you think though I'd love to see your comments!
‘You could open it out a little more as well,’ she continues. ‘Like we discussed doing. Instead of just for emergency services you can open it out to other people or companies that have done their bit to help their communities. There’s a guy I read about who’s just about to do his twelfth marathon in a year, and he’s done a different charity each time. And there’s a law firm in New York that don’t take money from their less wealthy clients. That’s just the top ones on my list.’
Eventually Ross addresses him again and Tony pulls himself from his musings. Ross’ face is a picture of frustration. ‘Well Stark it seems that,
Pepper’s jaw genuinely falls open. ‘Wait. Steve is Captain Steve Rogers? Tony how…what…when…’
‘Nearly there,’ she reassures him.
Merry Christmas,
‘How do you mean?’ he asks.
Peter doesn’t answer, just nods his head, slowly letting his arms circle Tony’s waist to return the hug.
Tony looks over at Steve as he copies what his husband had done with Morgan and pulls Peter into his lap. He knows the look on the blond’s face well by now: barely controlled anger with a hint of loss. They’d decided to adopt and had managed to be accepted fairly easily, despite being a same sex couple, and the result, a few years later, was the beautiful boy and girl they were currently holding. Steve had insisted they would take on some of the more challenging children, the ones who had kept being returned because no one could cope with their problems. They were both stubborn enough not to give up and they had the resources to provide whatever support the children needed.
‘Of course. Let me know when you need help,’ he tells her, speeding away to do as she asks. Slowly she moves the debris over, managing to take a few steps closer to the park as she starts to feel the strain of carrying such a heavy load for so long.
‘Why do I feel like I have a mutiny on my hands?’ the blond grumbles.
‘Not sure I can help you,’ Weasel responds, crossing his arms.
to join the team, now Loki asks you
‘Yeah but
Bucky growls in frustration, taking one out with a sound blow from his arm.
‘I think we’d be stupid not to assume it is,’ Steve replies. ‘You got a suit on you?’
‘You’ll what? Arrest Iron Man as well as Captain America for charges which were dropped? Is that how America runs her justice system now?’ Tony notices a few of the soldiers’ guns dropping as they look to each other for a hint as to what to do. ‘Hey, Vis? If I uploaded a video to the internet, how long before you think it’d go viral?’
‘Why do I not get an explanation to where I am from?’
‘Hey fuckwit!’
Peter hops up onto a bar stool and tries to look more confident than he feels, reminding himself that if he can take out the Winter Soldier he can take on the mercenaries in this place. ‘I’m looking for a merc and hoping you can help.’
‘Right, right, sorry. Now I see why Peter loves his suit so much. This must have been like all his dreams come true at once.’ He focusses back on the task at hand. ‘Right, Hulk buddy can you hear me?’
‘Do we need to remove any?’ he asks, flicking through them quickly.
‘Pepper asked me to look through some things for SI. A couple of projects that we’ve been funding and are up for review. She wants to know what my opinion is on them all and then she can make final calls.’
‘Yeah I know, I’ve had him moaning about it,’ Wanda giggles, pulling her hands away and opening her eyes again. ‘Now come on, Pete, we need to phone Happy and head back towards the facility before they send someone after us. You sure you want to run the risk of
‘Alright stop!’ Steve shouts. ‘Go with Deadpool’s plan. You two take out the convoy, then come back and help if you want. We’ll focus on getting Tony out. Rhodey? Give Clint a lift over to the rooftop opposite the entrance.’
Tony lets his hands travel up Steve’s arms to link around his neck, pulling his head down so he can rest his forehead against Steve’s. ‘I’ve never been too sure about most things in my life, but when it comes to you? I don’t doubt a single thing. And that kind of scares me if I’m honest.’
‘I also need to thank you for my present, although I imagine he’ll be keeping me awake for the next few nights at least.’
Hope you all have a lovely week.
‘How did you find me?’ he demands, gun still held at his side.
‘What are you two doing up so late?’ Tony asks as he steps into the common area, Natasha next to him. They’d been to see the Council and were obviously just getting back.
‘Want me to knock him out if he gets too annoying?’ she offers.
‘Seriously? How old are you? Jack Daniels. The whiskey.’
‘Yep. Be glad you had a break from it,’ Sam rolls his eyes.
‘Charming,’ the girl huffs but takes the white ball and lines up her shot.
They’re quiet for a moment, watching the team as they wait for the microwave to ping with the last bag for the second bowl. Natasha’s got fed up with the boys’ arguing and has sorted out the pillows herself; Bucky and Sam are trying to steal popcorn from the bowl and keeping the others away at the same time, but Peter’s sitting on the ceiling and dropping down by his webs every so often to steal some as Wanda distracts them. The two youngest members of the team sharing the spoils, and Wanda’s sharing some of their hard earned treats with Vision.
Steve laughs. ‘Yeah he flitted between the Commandos and helping Fury a couple of times before he decided to give up fighting and settled down. According to the file Fury kept going back and asking him to reconsider.’
‘Don’t push your luck, you’re supposed to be healing and I’m going to be in enough trouble as it is if Pepper catches you with that tablet.’
‘She is,’ Loki’s voice is thoughtful.
He hears the elevator doors go. ‘Boss-’
‘Alright what did I do this time?’ he asks, wondering if he can fake an alarm to get him out of this situation. Maybe send a message to Peter asking him to call him with a pretend situation? No, the kid can’t lie even if his life depends on it.
Whatever Peter is about to say is cut off as he looks up and frowns, face determined. ‘I’ll buy you time,’ he tells them both, scrambling to his feet and planting himself between the approaching Titan and the four members of his team. Steve crouching over Tony as the inventor struggles to regain his strength with his new reactor, and Wanda and Vision not far behind them.
‘I believe the quote was,’ Val looks down at her notes, ‘ah yes here it is. “No one would be exempt from the registration, even if they are someone’s precious intern and think they may have protection from other individuals.” He then went on to say-’
He shakes his head and opens his eyes. ‘No, its fine, Sam. Really.’
‘Just have the engine running by the time I get there.’ She turns and, taking out a gun, peers round the doorframe, stepping over the body on the floor when she sees it’s clear and hurriedly pushes it inside the office, closing the door behind her.
‘In New York,’ Steve fills him in quickly.
try.’
Bucky unzips his hoodie and throws it in the back to Peter. ‘Take off the coffee stained shirt and stick that on, kid. Otherwise Tony’ll think I’m the one throwing drinks over you.’
‘Err… I guess, if that’s alright?’
‘Move!’ Clint’s the first one to action again as he shoves both Rhodes and Bruce to the side and into Tony; all four of them slamming into the side wall as what appears to be some form of armoured truck smashes through the front of the café.
Peter would disagree as Bucky slides into the back next to him. The back of the car is tense as Ned keeps up a steady stream of chatter in the front as he directs Sam to his home. When they finally arrive Peter is about ready to jump out of the window and see if he can track down Deadpool; he’s pretty sure the merc is the only one who’d be able to save him at this particular moment in time.
‘You promised not to freak out,’ he reminds her.
‘You mean like you and Steve do?’ the teen cocks his head to one side as he takes in the new information. ‘I get worried about using my strength though,’ he admits, ‘all the people I face are usually normal humans and I don’t want to do any permanent damage.’
Before they get within earshot of the man Steve leans to Tony. ‘I thought you didn’t learn people’s names?’
Tony isn’t sure whether to laugh or cry at that very accurate summary of the entire team at the moment. ‘Fair enough.’
‘Nothing is wrong as such,’ the humanoid replies. ‘I just merely wanted to know the reason why you still do not utilise your full potential with your powers?’
‘Really? Because you really don’t look like you are. You haven’t been over-working yourself have you? Because the doctors said you haven’t recovered enough yet and you don’t want to-’
‘For everything,’ he carries on regardless.
‘I’m not sure if that actually makes me feel better,’ he admits, Sam snickering behind him.
‘Yes,’ Steve rolls his eyes, ‘that was only the start.’
Strangely enough that doesn’t make him feel better; as they walk out the front of the facility Peter catches sight of a suited Wade and waves goodbye to Dopinder as he drives off.
‘How’s Aunt Maisie getting on?’
They’ve barely finished eating when the alarm sounds.
‘Oh come on I’m not
‘Hey Peter?’ the teen looks up from his plate at Steve’s question.
‘What do you mean?’ Strange asks, frowning at the question.
‘Nat? Sam?’ Steve’s voice comes from her side of the car.
Tony muses,
‘Yes well I feel like we’ve done “get help” about a hundred times over, so if you don’t mind I’d like to sit down.’
‘Hey don’t worry about it. You slip up and I’ll just kill the person who works it out. Problem solved.’
‘We’re packed in like sardines huddling under Hulk as it is.’
'You know for a big bad assassin you are such a baby.'
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘I know,’ she says, ‘but this was something I thought you’d want up here.’ They sit down on one of the sofas and she hands him a square box. ‘Tony showed me your room and there’s pictures of us, and of you and Ned in there, a couple of the team as well. And I know you didn’t want to bring yours up from home so I thought I’d give you one to keep up here. Peter? What’s wrong honey?’
Tony is saved from the snap, and Wade meets Death.
‘You good?’ Natasha asks him after a while. He closes his eyes and nods, not trusting his voice.
‘Colonel Rhodes are you going to be giving evidence?’
He pauses once he reaches the roof, lifting up the front of his mask to try and wipe at his watering eyes. He closes them against the images of broken bodies across the auditorium floor, of bodies crumpling to the floor of negotiators sent to save him. Killed by weapons that shouldn’t have been in the hands of humans, let alone terrorists.
‘But-’
for relationship advice of all people. Wouldn’t Clint be a better person to speak to? Hell I’ll give you Pepper’s number if you want, she’s awesome at relationship advice.’
‘Oh don’t worry I’m pretty sure Mr Stark had FRIDAY record it,’ Peter grumbles, earning himself a hair ruffle from his mentor.
pepperoni hostage!’ Peter protests, putting his pile of boxes down on the breakfast bar.
‘A mercenary,’ Natasha explains and Tony flicks through the information on the tablet. ‘A very dangerous mercenary with exceptional regenerative abilities, word is he can’t be killed. Used to be in Special Forces before he got his abilities, name of Wade Wilson-’
‘Way to ruin my Christmas.’
‘Aunt Peggy used to say the right clothes can make half of the statement for you,’ Tony shrugs, then he pauses to think, ‘you know if we’re going to be doing some more public relation stuff as a team maybe I should be looking into that with some of you.’
Do let me know what you think or if there is anything you'd like to see in this series. This story is going to be solely focussing on the mission, not something I've really done much of before so it's a bit of an experiment for me!
‘Wow, if you’re confusing me and Tony then we need to have a serious conversation,’ Peter laughs.
‘It’s Aunt Peggy’s handgun,’ she explains, looking at him and trying very obviously to bring her temper under control. ‘She took it with her everywhere she went, she was never without it. All of us cousins would sit around and listen to her stories and we’d all ask if we could have it one day. She’d never promise it to anyone, only saying “I’ll send it to the right person when I think the time is right”.’ She swings round to look at Tony. ‘Please,
‘I thought you were supposed to be recruiting, Stark,’ Secretary Ross spits at him. ‘Or is that something else you’ve failed to do?’
‘Way to ruin the mood, Vis,’ Wanda rolls her eyes next to the humanoid.
‘Make sure everyone in the grounded one is out of the fight,’ he tells him. ‘I’ve got this covered.’
‘He’s been acting a little strange lately though,’ she muses, ‘I’m wondering if he’s under a bit too much stress with work, but he won’t admit anything to me.’
‘So I didn’t want to bring this up with those two around,’ he says, looking Tony dead in the eye. ‘And I’ll understand if you don’t want to answer the question. Your nightmares Tony: is there by any chance something associated with Siberia in there as well?’
Thor explains how Thanos wipes out over two thirds of the remaining Asgardians and severely injures Heimdall before Loki steps forwards and offers allegiance, using it as a cover to attack the titan; how Thanos had stopped him using the stone in his gauntlet and stabbed him, wanting to keep him alive long enough to find out where the Tesseract was. It had given Heimdall the opportunity to gather the strength to send all of them, including Loki, to Earth.
Tony falls in beside Peter at the back. ‘How you doing, kid?’
They stop their conversation as a door opens and another man steps out, the one opens the door of the car for the newcomer to enter quickly; then they both get in and drive off.
‘Well he just seemed more...together? Less bat-shit insane? Didn’t talk to himself as much? Any of this ringing bells?’
‘Who the fuck are you?’ I ask, sitting up and realising I’m not in my suit, just my normal sleep wear.
‘You miss her.’
‘Thank you,’ he presses a kiss to Steve’s lips, a sigh of relief and happiness leaving him. ‘Plus Bruce was happy to support him so I knew
‘He won’t accept help,’ Thor grumbles, but still moves away from his brother.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Tony, what happened?’ he asks when the inventor finally calms down. And Tony tells him everything about their argument, only keeping back the reason they’d been down there in the first place.
‘Because they may not have noticed that every time you mention the reactor in the nightmare you start to say something else and then stop. And there’s always a brief glance at Steve when you change the topic. Now I haven’t been around for all of your interactions, but if there’d been something about Cap and your reactor from any other time I’m pretty sure Nat would know about it and would have said something. Since she hasn’t my guess is something happened in Siberia that’s still weighing on your mind and you don’t want either of the other two to feel guilty about it. Am I right?’
‘He’s the only person Tony can tell you the exact birthday of,’ Rhodes says. ‘Well apart from Steve, but
Wanda helps him and Peter to their feet as Steve jogs over, he’s obviously in pain, but not to the point where Tony is going to tell him to get out of here.
are you talking about?’ Peter cuts him off.
‘Wanda was knocked out like Sam when the attack first happened. Thor was in the car with her and was disorientated, it’s a miracle he wasn’t out cold too. Steve checked on me then went to help them while Bucky helped me get Sam out the car. Then he went to help the others when the soldiers attacked. Nakia and I got Sam into their car, then she went to help while I stayed with him. They hit us with this sonic blast, completely knocked us all, then when the others were retreating one of them shot Bucky in the leg. He was carrying Wanda and, because they couldn’t hear, they didn’t realise he was down until I managed to get Steve’s attention. By the time he turned back there was this weird mist and…it knocked him out and there were soldiers between them and us. We couldn’t get back to them. The mist was some kind of knock out gas, but fast acting. It had to be to take out Bucky that quickly. Even T’Challa’s suit couldn’t filter it enough. They nearly got him as well when he tried to go after them. If it wasn’t for Okoye and Steve he would have been.’
‘It’s missing the secret ingredient,’ he explains. ‘She always said there was a secret ingredient she’d tell me about one day, but it’s just regular cookie ingredients on here.’
‘I followed you to Siberia to help you!’
‘Excuse me?’ Natasha blinks.
he tells himself, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. He opens them again to watch his team as he raises his hand.
‘Not bad for an old man,’ Peter quips, hearing a laugh from Tony.
‘And that’s an order from the Captain as well,’ Bucky grins, jerking his thumb in Steve’s direction.
‘Wait the group in New York has their own team name now?’ Rhodes raises an eyebrow.
‘Just remember to keep your mask up alright?’ he says instead, smiling as much as he can as another cough wracks his body. ‘Can’t be losing you now we just got you back.’
Peter makes room at their table as his childhood friend heads up the classroom to join them. Mr Harris turns his attention to the trip and the rules that they will all need to follow whilst at the facility.
‘Yippee ki yay motherfucker!’ Is all the warning Thanos gets before a red-blurred shape falls from the sky, twin swords in their hands and severs the hand with the gauntlet before he can snap his fingers.
‘Well I didn’t think it was appropriate for the dinner table but yes,’ Wade gives Natasha a dark look.
‘But-’
Strange sits up a little straighter then. ‘What did his illusions show you?’
‘I’ll get hold of Clint and tell him to change his destination to Wakanda,’ Natasha says, taking out her phone, ‘he’s picking up Scott and Wade on the way.’
‘I’m screwed,’ Wade moans, ‘I’m not going to be able to behave myself
‘Pete why are you here fifteen minutes early?’ Steve asks as they walk through the door.
‘Can the rest of you look after our guests? Vis why don’t you show them where their rooms are when they’re ready?’
‘And Steve would definitely
probably the best placed person to be paired with on this trip anyway,’ Mr Harris says, a little wrong-footed at the revelation.
‘The best kind of eventful so far,’ Steve agrees. ‘Well except for the food fight.’
Tony rubs a hand over tired eyes as he walks down the steps to the street, hoping the headache he can feel coming on could at least wait until he got home. Yet another time Ross had called him in to ‘discuss’ his latest report on Bucky; it was becoming increasingly obvious, almost embarrassingly so, that it was just an excuse to pull him away from helping the soldier.
Natasha doesn’t seem to mind the girl’s boldness. ‘Any other weekend I would have said no problem, but I’m afraid we need Peter to help with a project that can’t wait.’
Sam sees the teenager’s shoulders ease a little at that. ‘Thanks,’ he smiles.
‘Now there was a hell of a lot of shit that we’ll discuss when we’ve got Wanda and Bucky back, but there’s one thing I’m really disappointed in, Peter, and I feel like we need to talk about it right now.’
‘Wait!’ Tony says, resisting the urge to raise his hands to emphasise his point, knowing it would probably be taken as a threat.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Huh, I’m so remembering that for the future,’ Peter responds, sending his webs to catch hold of one of the alien’s fists, and swinging around one of the thickest trees in the park to secure the other end of the webbing around it. ‘Let’s hope that holds the one arm for a bit. Where’s Steve?’
‘He’ll be alright, Steve, he’s about as stubborn as you are, you just got to give him time.’
‘WHAT?!?’ Peter shouts. ‘I was asking you for
‘Not to mention I’d rather be somewhere there are
Peter nods, casting a glance down at the bomb vest that hangs loosely around him. All the terrorists are prepared to blow rather than be taken it seems.
‘I’m not stupid enough to take that bet,’ Tony shakes his head.
‘What do you think the Council will say about it?’
Wanda's team make a good start before an accident brings a quick change to the game
going to forgive him. As soon as Thor even looks as though he’s walking in the direction of the staircase down to the labs Tony’s glaring at him.’ He looks at the dark haired man out of the corner of his eye. ‘Should I ask why you needed such strict instructions when it comes to buying trees?’
Luke, the youngest member of the squad who hasn’t been with them long just looks between everyone. ‘I…uh…I didn’t bring mine.’
‘Mind if we take a look around?’ the second one asks.
Bucky takes a breath.
‘We’re going to be sleeping in the same building as them! Do you think we could sneak out at night and get their autographs?’
‘Hey,’ the shorter man says, closing the door and taking the only seat in the room. ‘You doing alright?’
‘I haven’t danced them in centuries, my memory’s a little foggy,’ she retorts with a grin.
‘Seriously?’ she asks, eyes wide. ‘Don’t you have stuff you’re supposed to be doing with Tony?’
‘Ah Peter, glad to see you back,’ Vision greets him just as they step out of the elevator. ‘I believe we are waiting for you to cut your cake.’
‘I don’t know, boss. Last time I picked him up he was walking around the grounds.’
‘Well you can bet you aren’t getting distracted by anything here, including dinner, until you’ve done your homework. And just what kind of thing was getting you so distracted? Patrols?’
‘I do not understand these strange shapes. Why not just make them into circles so they are easy to carry?’ Drax asks.
‘Nice to see you again, Captain,’ Zemo says, climbing over the rubble behind Bucky. ‘I see you found my father’s old farmhouse. It served its purpose. Much like your friend here.’
‘What else did you expect me to do?’ he counters.
‘Hey Steve? Next time you take the hormonal teenager on your team alright?’ Bucky says, but Steve can tell the light-hearted tone is forced.
‘Can you tell him to hurry?’ Steve asks. ‘We’re already running late and I don’t want to encourage Tony to drive faster than normal.’
‘And the way he didn’t need to use his webs to hold him off until the end?’
‘Uh-huh,’ she raises an eyebrow at him, ‘something tells me there’s a story here.’ He caves and tells her about his visit to Sister Margaret’s. At first she’s furious that he went there and put himself in that situation, but when he goes on to tell her about winning pool and pinning a couple of the mercs she’s laughing hysterically. ‘I can just imagine their faces when this scrawny kid takes them all out!’
I will let you touch me. I’m saving you from injury you fool!’

A/N: Hey everyone. This is the last chapter of the Christmas special! Thank you so much to everyone who has read this story, your kudos, comments and support have been making me smile so much through a bit of a tough time. I honestly cannot thank you enough.
‘Like the first time he tried to ask a dame out. We were ten and he-’
More than one confused face turns to look at her. ‘Where do you want to go?’ Clint asks her.
‘Banner and the Beast have had a slight disagreement and now the Hulk is not always appearing,’ Loki explains.
‘You alright, Strange?’ Natasha asks as Steve hurries to do as Tony asks.
remember that time, it’s…it’s not who I am now. Nothing that happened there was good, except that it gave me the skills that makes me useful to the team.’
Steve’s face starts to turn pink and Tony has to try to keep back his grin. ‘I don’t see why we can’t just get someone else to do it.’
the strength to win a straight out contest, but you’re not using it and that means you’re using up more energy dancing around when you could neutralise a threat much quicker.’
‘Now I have an exciting announcement,’ Mr Harris says once he finishes taking the register. ‘Our school has been chosen for the pilot of a new scheme! I’ll be sending home letters with all of you along with permission slips that you’ll need to get signed. We have been invited to spend a couple of days up at the newly renovated Avengers Facility as a trial for a new scheme they’re starting, working with schools across the country.’
here?’
Tony laughs, trying not to cry as Clint stands up and goes to stand at the edge of the clearing, determined to protect him from any incoming enemies. It doesn’t take long for Natasha to return, the glowing purple stone attached to her glove.
‘Really? Huh that’s cool, I wondered why everyone was so happy drinking that blend from Budapest. I swear when Clint and I made you try it you hated it.’
Her eyes go wide. ‘It’s Daredevil or Deadpool right?’
‘Yeah, but we agreed it was better to finish repairing the facility and get that all up and running again before we start on the house.’
‘Who is Scott?’
Peter shoots him a frown. ‘You have no idea how much Sergeant Barnes enjoys winding me up. This is going to be
of you along to get the Christmas trees,’ Sam grumbles as they park up at the place Rhodes had found for them last night.
‘I’m pretty sure if I say yes then technically I’m not. Aren’t people who are insane not supposed to know they’re insane?’
‘We are making good progress,’ he responds. ‘After this all we are going to have left to do is to repeat the trigger words until we are able to remove all traces of the controlling elements from your mind.’
‘Can you live with the new Accords? Even if we try and change them more in the future?’ he knows he must be sounding a little desperate.
‘Nat? You ok?’ she turns to see Wanda looking at her in concern.
‘Huh. So not only do you withhold information from me about the state of health of the volunteer for my prosthesis project, in fact you out-right lie to my face about it, you also withhold information from them on where they are to be deployed. Frankly, Captain Rumlow, I’m not so sure I trust you to lead my personal security team. Especially considering your involvement with my former partner, Obadiah Stane, a man currently undergoing investigation into attempted murder. Coincidentally,’ Tony points to Bucky, ‘the attempted murder of one Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes.’
Vision nods. ‘I still do not fully comprehend emotions, though I believe I am getting much better. However, I can safely say that it takes a lot of courage to make the decision you have, and I think you should be proud.’
‘You want us to vote?’ Wong asks as everyone turns to look at them.
Love always,
‘Ready to go home, Cap?’ Sam asks.
‘Pete? Just leave it for now,’ Tony cuts across him, then turns to Thor. ‘You want to tell us what’s happened to you Point Break? And why you’re sporting the space pirate look?’
‘However,’ one of them says, ‘I will not say that all will be content with you taking the throne, considering your past deeds.’
‘We need to destroy the gauntlet,’ Strange cuts in. ‘Can you help us?’
this, Wade. Why don’t you?’
Monica lets out a bark of laughter. ‘My mother wouldn’t have grounded me, she knew I’d better work through it if I had work to occupy me. But he wanted me out of the way so he could work on getting comfortable in her old position.’
Love you all!
‘Why would we not leave him alone?’ Steve asks.
‘Can we save story time until
He’s due to be picked up by the team on their way to the UN, Valkyrie is taking charge of the Asgardians and continuing to oversee the construction of New Asgard.
‘I wouldn’t,’ Lautenus says; he points his ice sword towards them. ‘I think I shall take care of you all first, and then by the time my dear brother comes to his senses I can kill him as he looks at the friends he failed to protect.’
‘Well,’ Sam says, reaching for the bottle to pour them both another drink, ‘I’m glad we’re not in that situation, because I’m not sure we could have
your type.’
The woman sighs. ‘Not really. I heard from him the other day that he’s on the trail of an energy source and should be back in a couple of days; apparently it’s… well it’s a similar reading to an infinity stone.’
Do let me know what you think! Thank you so much for all the comments on this story so far and for all your support
Even from here Tony can hear Thor’s battle cry. ‘BRING ME THANOS!!’
the R&D department. Well there’s other people that work for R&D but I do the majority of the work. Oh shit that sounded really arrogant didn’t it? Pepper told me to tone it down.’
Just then a shot rings out. Steve flinches on instinct, but it’s Hammer who lets out a wail of pain, clutching his hand as the device falls to the floor. Before he can work out who fired the shot Natasha appears out of nowhere, taking the former business tycoon to the floor, a gun to his head.
Loki shakes his head, his worry bleeding through their link. ‘I worry for the Spiderling if we do not hear soon.’
your fault, and you being
,’ comes Peter’s soft reply.
By the end of the morning Bucky is proud of the progress Peter’s made; the teen is now a lot more confident in using his strength to his advantage during a fight, rather than relying on his manoeuvrability alone and he seems to be developing much more of his own fighting style rather than just repeating what he’d been taught.
‘But why can’t I use the suit’s interface? That’s what I’d do if I got caught someone pitch black. And I can see in near-perfect darkness anyway.’
‘Tony?’ Peter’s voice is quiet. ‘Promise me something?’
He waves them off. ‘Luckily I had the team with me, so it wasn’t so much of an issue.’
‘Alright all clear for the decorations,’ Sam says, jumping down from Steve’s shoulders.
He shrugs. ‘He just wants to make sure I’m alright. Besides I asked Daredevil for help as well.’
Steve is surprised to say the least as Pepper links an arm with him and pulls him to one side. Tony makes a joke about being hurt and finding a nicer CEO which makes the crowd laugh. ‘You sure you don’t want to dance with Tony, Pepper? I dare say he’s a much better dancer than I am’.
‘And I’m going to hide behind Nat,’ the archer says, leaping over the sofa. Peter grins and goes to take a swig when the bottle is snatched from his hand.
‘What of the Winter Soldier, Mr Stark?’
‘And we owe him for helping get you out and stopping Hammer from activating that detonator,’ Natasha continues, and Peter dares to look up at them.
‘I snapped at Rhodey,’ Peter explains, ‘and it was just like when Venom was in control, that was just before you turned up and Loki checked me again to make sure he was gone for good.’
‘Not necessarily-’
‘Just don’t go anywhere I can’t follow?’
‘Do I really have to spell it out for you? Of course it is you idiot!’
‘Aw man you need to go to Budapest, all the fun stuff happens there,’ the archer leans back in the chair and grins at Natasha.
‘I forgot to ask: do you two have your suits with you?’
‘It’s good to see you awake, brother,’ Thor says with obvious feeling.
Because if there’s one thing he’s determined to do by the end of tonight, it’s to give Tony Stark a piece of his mind.
‘Ok you two spend way too much time together,’ Sam says, walking over to the girls. ‘I’m getting as far away from that as possible.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Really?’ Peter is pretty sure Ned’s eyes are going to pop from his head. ‘Oh my god this is the best day of my life!’
‘Oh they’ve all gone to get their presents to put underneath the tree. They’ll be back soon. Come and sit next to an old lady and entertain her with what’s really been happening here. I imagine a lot of the good stories have been kept from me.’ She leans back as he sits next to her and studies him again. ‘You already look better than when you walked in.’
‘How did you- oh right they turned up to help get Tony out. Err… yeah it’s um, it’s Deadpool.’
‘Strange saw what had happened on the news the same as we did. He arrived at the courthouse just as Tony was getting a car ready to take us to the jet and opened a portal here. Seems we arrived too late to be of any use though.’
‘Hey! Damn it, Pete,’ the dark skinned man curses, but Peter’s already ducked back behind cover, Wade leaning out the other side and getting Bucky on his arse. The two take off laughing before either of the men can retaliate and they’re kept busy by Steve and Tony. Wade tackles him to the ground as two snowballs goes flying over their heads.
‘So, Peter, how’s school been?’ he asks in way of greeting.
‘I’d say it shows how much she cared about you, Tony,’ Natasha tells him.
Natasha cuts across his aunt. ‘Who have you been speaking to?’ Peter looks down at her question. ‘Deadpool?’
‘I passed,’ Bucky’s grin is wider than Steve’s seen it since before the war, his friend’s face filling the screen in front of him.
‘Oh no, don’t even think about making this a regular thing,’ he says, eyes not leaving the balls on the table; he grins as he pots one from the break and shrugs at the groan from his opponent.
‘Yeah I…I slept through the night.’
‘How am I supposed to know?’
The red covered head shakes side to side. ‘Nothing like that, baby boy.’
‘Do you want me to wait here?’ Peter asks as the doors open and they step out onto the ground floor.
Thor surges forwards, getting a better grip on Stormbreaker to slice at the Titan and scrambling to his feet, belatedly realising it was Mjolnir that had been his saviour.
Peter opens a new contact and hands his phone to the merc, careful to make sure he can’t see any of his background pictures, one of which is of him and May. ‘It’s not me I’m worried about, Deadpool,’ he admits as the man types away. ‘It’s Mr Stark and the others. It’s the people in my life when I’m not being Spider-Man. What if I can’t protect them and Hammer tries to get at them?’
‘We’re leaving,’ Tony tells him once the students are out of the way.
‘Let me contact T’Challa, we need to get the Accords moving sooner than I’d hoped. Something tells me there is more than just HYDRA at work here, and I want us to be able to face it without jumping through hoops and losing a chance every time it gets within our grasp.’
‘Pete-’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘What’s up FRIDAY?’ he sighs.
‘Calm down,’ he takes hold of the teen’s shoulders. ‘And listen before you panic. I just said I approved. It’s obvious you’ve got stronger feelings than friendship for the guy, Peter. I won’t lie and say I wasn’t terrified when I first realised, but then I talked to him on Christmas Day and I’d decided after that he was good enough for you. Though, Steve was quick to point out that no one will
He’s secretly relieved when they get in to the car and head out towards the dig site. As they climb out he wraps his arms around himself to block out the chill from the wind, trying to block out the memories of ice. ‘The sooner we get this over with the better,’ he mumbles, trying to ignore how his breath fogs in front of his face.
‘Well its close enough,’ Tony smiles, taking a few steps closer so he’s now close enough for Steve to reach out and touch him.
He’ll also admit to being surprised at how well Loki is doing at managing his new found position. Especially considering today is the first day he’s been able to travel to Jotunheim, as their mental link wasn’t stable enough to allow him to travel such a long distance before.
Tony barely notices as the two of them leave, but thinks he manages a wave in their direction. He’s jolted back into the present as Sam comes to sit at the bench opposite him.
Bucky had got them through the checkpoint without any problem, mumbling some excuse about the usual driver, whose name they’d got from his ID, had come down with a bad case of food poisoning and being directed to a holding bay. They’d made quick work of the three guards near the van and now the boys were off laying the charges.
to believe him. Why are you laughing at me?’
‘Getting stuck with someone for days in a life or death situation can make you good friends.’
‘The worst you’re going to do is end up trashing a hotel room. That’s why you’ve got my card in your wallet.’
version of Cinderella,’ the young boy in the bed opposite counters.
‘Bucky and I are sat in the opposite block of chairs,’ Steve says, ‘right at the back of the auditorium.’
following it to the letter where you are concerned is his way of showing you
he chuckles to himself and begins to survey the surrounding group, already planning how he is going to catch each one.
‘I don’t know what you wanted to accomplish by coming here and doing this, Sharon,’ he cuts her off. ‘I don’t know whether finding Peggy’s possessions brought back the grief at her death and you wanted an outlet for it, or if you wanted to attack Tony for another reason. But if you were intending to break up the team again you were never going to succeed.’
‘Shit! Rhodey! Bruce!’ Tony knows he should be focussing on the enemies coming out of the vehicle but all he can think about is his two friends potentially trapped under a huge amount of rubble. ‘FRIDAY?’
, Tony. But I always wondered: did you and Bucky ever explore anything?’
Peter comes out of the memory as he falls to the floor, gasping for air and desperately trying to hold himself up as his body shakes violently.
‘Didn’t think you’d missed me that much, kiddo,’ Tony laughs, stepping forwards quickly and bringing her into a hug before she can reach her intended target. He feels her stiffen slightly and hurriedly mutters in her ear. ‘Don’t let them know about you and Vision. Play along for now and later you can have all the time you want. I promise.’
to hunt them. And the only things not on that list are animals I
‘Tony!’ he catches hold of one of the inventor’s hands when he reaches him, trying to ignore the tears blurring his vision. ‘Stay with me, Tony, come on.’
‘Now, now children,’ Tony says, ‘that’s not in the spirit of the game. But let’s add the rule you have to catch someone unawares just to make it easier. And no bodily harm if you are caught please.’
‘Uh huh,’ Mr Nelson doesn’t look too happy, he’s about to add something when the door opens behind him.
‘How many did you see?’ Natasha asks.
‘Wait you blew up a cupboard in the science lab making a new version of your web fluid and still managed to get away with it?’ Tony asks, pushing open the door to the common area.
the stuff Tony did at your age.’
‘Do you promise to leave him alone?’
‘Indeed, I shall be happy to watch over him if you need to leave him somewhere during your travels,’ Thor offers.
‘For the last fucking time, Tin Can, I’ll be there in a second you don’t need to come and nag me.’
‘Are you sure that’s safe?’ Bucky asks. ‘What if she now doesn’t have the same control on her powers as she did before?’
‘I’m not even sorry,’ the Winter Soldier laughs.
‘Not without you,’ he snaps, feeling his lower body now free of the hole. Both of them half crawling and half dragging or being dragged as dust flies up all around them. Clint thinks he feels other hands on him, dragging him backwards as the dust becomes blinding.
Tony takes a few steps back, wanting to give him as much privacy as possible, but knowing he’ll have to stay close in case anyone is watching who might report back to Ross and the Council if he leaves the soldier alone.
As everyone heads to get plates of food Ned runs up to Peter, his eyes wide. ‘Dude you just totally took out the Winter Soldier!’
A/N: Hello everyone! Sorry I'm at the later end of when I usually update this week, it's been a bit of a crazy week and I didn't get chance to update on Friday night like I usually do. I hope you enjoyed this chapter, and seeing some of the 'Rogues' stepping up to help Tony.
‘Alright, leave it to us,’ MJ says, dragging Ned up. ‘You want anything Pete?’
‘Is the child’s relationship still the main topic of conversation?’ he rolls his eyes as he heads towards the fridge.
There’s a ripple of laughter through the room. Then someone asks. ‘You mean after the Civil War there’s no hard feelings?’
Peter spins around. His fears are confirmed when he sees the two bodies on the floor, a hole in the middle of each of their heads. Spinning back around he sees Deadpool holding a gun, there’s still a bit of smoke coming from the end and the acrid smell of gunfire fills the room.
‘I made Hawkeye miss,’ Wade cackles, then drags Peter away behind one of the sheds.
If it hadn’t been for the red haired former-Russian spy Bucky isn’t entirely sure he would have been as comfortable in the training room as he was now. He’s still not sure he’s been able to thank her properly.
There’s a brief silence where you could have cut the atmosphere with a knife. Then all of the adults start asking questions at once.
‘Pfft,’ a female voice laughs, still hidden behind the bank of screens, ‘you just need to learn to chill.’
‘You don’t need to apologise.’
‘Oh Captain Rogers, what a wonderful proposition.’
‘The only problem,’ he’d told her as they were leaving, ‘is that I can’t get the signal strong enough for you to upload information
‘You alright, Romanov?’
They turn a corner and see a very smug looking Bucky and a very apologetic looking Steve standing next to possibly the tallest Christmas tree Tony has ever seen. And he’s seen some tall ones during some Stark Industries Christmas parties.
‘FRIDAY is that clear?’ he ignores the woman and asks the AI.
Deadpool nods. ‘And with what you did with keeping the Avengers off my back. I’m not used to people believing in me. Especially not when it comes to hero-doing, no-killing stuff.’
A/N: Hey everyone! I'm back to (fairly!) normal schedule, and with the sequel series to 'Another Chance'; I hope you enjoy the start of the first instalment, I wanted to start off with some of the characters who hadn't had as much page time in the previous series.
‘You can’t tell me you didn’t enjoy the sass just then,’ Wade grins, and Tony can’t help the answering tug at the corner of his mouth.
don’t let Bucky find out,’ Peter groans.
‘You are the people who clean up after us when we’ve made the mess, you’re the ones who look after the casualties who are caught in the middle of our battles, and you’re the ones who continue to help the people who lost loved ones after we’ve left. And yet it seems to be us that get the thanks.
‘Who chose an Andrews Sisters’ song?’
Peter looks down as his phone buzzes with an incoming message.
‘He couldn’t do anything about the scars?’
‘We should get you to the jet as well,’ Strange’s voice is soft, despite everything she’s done.
‘You don’t think he might have had any regeneration with it?’ she asks.
if I told him I’d met Captain Rogers.’
‘What happened at the convoy?’ Bucky asks quietly.
‘Yeah the others didn’t pass on the memo did they?’ Tony quips. ‘We told them Earth was closed and they didn’t listen. Are you sure you want to go the same way as them?’
So Tony wasn’t quite expecting this level of noise when they finally revealed the full extent of HYDRA’s involvement in the committee.
Tony freezes. There’s only one person left with an override code, and he’s not sure he’s ready to face him either. The door opens and Bucky steps in, closing the door quickly behind him.
‘No,’ Shuri sniggers, ‘we knew
‘Tony he can’t always have the suit on him. He can’t always be wearing it. Just like you can’t always be wearing yours. He needs to learn how to defend himself without it as well.’
‘Tony?’ he looks up at Steve as he kneels in front of him, worriedly taking in his quick gasps as he fights for air.
The rest of the team are taking the captives back to the facility on the jet. Agents are debriefing the other hostages and helping police prepare bodies for identification. It seems Ross had neglected to mention the fact there had already been casualties amongst the audience before the majority had got out.
‘Well more with Uncle Gabe to be honest. Those two got really close after the war, what with Morita working with Gabe’s wife and all that. He was always the more chatty of the lot, except for Dum Dum of course. He filled me in on some of your more interesting missions from the war.’
sticking to his boyfriend.
Just as she reaches him he darts back into the room and places a kiss to the man’s lips. ‘Told you she’d like you,’ he grins and races back out to follow the girl back up the stairs, leaving a very shocked merc standing in the room, one hand reaching up to his face.
‘Seriously?’ Tony scoffs. ‘I’ve wanted to do it since you went all determined Captain America with the Accords.’
Natasha’s face softens with understanding and he realises just how much he misses her. She just gets things without you needing to go into long winded explanations.
‘Do you
There is now, however, a reason for him to rethink this prior assessment. With Loki now recovered enough to not injure himself should he attempt to do any form of exercise, he has sought out Vision for some assistance.
‘How do I know he won’t leave again like last time?’
‘What do you want us to do?’ she asks.
Peter looks up at the sharp tone in Natasha’s voice.
‘You can still get through though, right?’ Bruce asks the AI.
‘No!’ a couple of voices chorus, causing the inventor to pout.
‘Excuse me, what?’
‘Vis no!’ Wanda protests, and Peter starts to back away from the door, not wanting to intrude on their conversation. He wants to run in and promise them both that Thanos isn’t going to get hold of Vision or the Mind Stone, and that they’ve nothing to worry about. But he can’t lie to them.
August continues to talk as they walk along the tunnels, a couple of chambers branch off which Steve can see house more lighting than the string that hangs from the walls of the tunnels. About five minutes later they enter into a larger open area, this one is flooded with light.
A/N: Hello everyone! I hope you've all had a good week and you enjoy this chapter, thank you for sticking with the story. Up next: the Battle of Wakanda begins.
‘Your mother’s name, yes,’ she replies, her voice a little softer, ‘I was named for her, my king. My mother was good friends with yours.’
‘Come on you lot!’ Wanda calls from where the others are waiting at the entrance to the rink.
,’ he spits at the other man, ‘I’m sure he’ll give you a picture.’ With that he launches himself back up the wall and onto the rooftop.
‘The Warden is asking us to go in help seeing as Hammer is a known Avenger antagonist,’ Sam explains. ‘Nat suggested that only people who know Hammer should go, that way if this is him trying to escape we can make sure he’s brought back in.’
‘Well he told me about your kiss and I just wondered…’
They look down at the dark haired man, his head resting on one arm, the hand still clutching a screwdriver; the other one is reaching across the desk as if he’s fallen asleep in the middle of typing out an idea on one of his many screens.
The Cloak wraps around him and starts dragging him further into the Sanctum.
‘Firstly, young Earthlings, I must apologise for my brother’s absence,’ Thor addresses the crowd once they settle in one of the larger briefing rooms, ‘he was intending to be here with me, but unfortunately he has had to remain on Jotunheim.’
‘Uh… you’ve looked at me right?’
‘I thought it was Harry about to reveal secrets from your childhood that was the problem?’ MJ adds.
‘Loki is teaching us to
‘I know,’ Peter cuts him off more sharply than he means to. ‘I just want to make sure. Just in case.’
Wanda makes sure everyone puts at least one decoration on the tree: she and Natasha had found Avengers themed baubles which resulted in a lot of laughter when they were revealed, they’d even found a Spider-Man one for Peter. Everyone had a lucky dip to choose someone else’s bauble to hang on the tree. Towards the end though there were three left: one for Thor, one for Hawkeye, and one for Hulk. Peter notices Tony hand Hulk’s one to Natasha, and she gives him a small, watery smile as she hangs it not far from where Wanda had hung the Black Widow one. Steve hangs Thor’s up near the top, and Wanda hangs Hawkeye’s next to it.
Tony sighs. ‘Yes I know. But we have to remember Peter has taken on super villains, he’s a superhero in his own right, and he is nearly old enough to be making this decision himself. He’s not stupid and he
‘I never realised there was so much magic in the world,’ Cassie says, her eyes wide. ‘Can you teach me any of it?’
A/N: First of all a huge thank you to my two reviewers on the last chapter JustAnotherLonelyFangirl and BB4ever!! I love getting reviews, they really make my day. And due to a request from BB4ever there will be a WinterIron scene a little later in the story. But don't worry I'm staying primarily Stony!
‘Cute,’ she says, putting it to one side for Bruce to find later and reaching for another one. This time she opens an envelope and finds a picture of Spider-Man swinging past the Empire State Building, this one done by a very talented artist, who had signed their name in the corner and written a brief thank you on the back to Spider-Man for helping to keep the city safer.
Peter’s face sets into a frown, and Bucky is struck by the new hardness to the boy. Something has happened with Beck that he hasn’t had time to process.
‘Bruce Hulked out from the shock of the blast,’ Sam coughs as he comes to stand with them. ‘He’s not going to be controlled is he?’
‘Barrier down in five, four, three, two, one. Barrier is down.’
The journey went surprisingly well; for the most part they were able to follow along the rooftops, and Peter only had to help Deadpool when they reached particularly large gaps between buildings, and the man was more than happy to hang on to the webslinger’s arm as they swung between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Peter what are you doing?’ Natasha demands and Bucky turns to see the webslinger webbing the monster’s face and then swinging up onto its back.
‘I’m hoping I can buy some time for them to get here,’ he tells her. ‘Now wish me luck!’
‘Was that because your dad was trying to stop you from becoming a murdering psycho?’ Nathaniel asks innocently. His sister turns to him horrified.
‘Give me the stone, Steve, let me end this now,’ he says, grabbing the stone from Steve’s hand.
‘And?’
As soon as he’s far enough away he takes out his phone.
‘Pleasure’s all mine, Widow,’ the mercenary comes into view, walking past Steve and the others, and putting his gun away. ‘I don’t take kindly to people threatening my friends. That one’s for my Baby Boy, asshole.’
‘No kidding,’ Steve huffs out a laugh. ‘So I take it you only really saw him with Peggy?’
‘Why would I check for secret passageways?’ Steve sighs.
‘Budge over, Barton,’ he says, taking the pilot’s seat, ‘I’m turning off all navigational systems and flying us under the radar.’
The problem is that Bucky is much fiercer and quicker with his attacks than Sam, who doesn’t have the speed to match, and Steve, who was landing punches in a steady rhythm; it’s taking everything in him to keep up with the dodges, and Bucky’s moving around so much he can’t pin when would be a good time to try and take his legs out from under him. Plus his counter attacks are barely landing and now he’s getting frustrated.
‘Probably more so than he’s being with you.’
Tony just nods and they head out together, way lit by the reactor in his chest. Now Tony isn’t known for being able to stay quiet for long, especially in awkward silences, so he’s actually quite proud of himself for lasting as long as he does. ‘So. Long lost brother huh?’
‘You’re the best of us kid,’ Steve tells him, ‘already you’re the best of us. And you’re only going to keep getting better. Just don’t beat yourself up about things that you can’t change, or you’ll end up destroying yourself.’
‘I was expecting some kind of Christmas goblin to have vomited everywhere,’ he admits, taking a seat at the breakfast bar next to Sam, ‘but this seems very subdued after the stories Natasha told me.’
. ‘Thank you, Vis. Of course you have my permission to ask her.’ He pulls the humanoid into a hug.
Tony looks sheepish. ‘In my defence, Mama, he didn’t exactly give me chance to tell you.’
‘And keep the photos of the team up.’
Tony rubs a hand over his face. ‘I have no idea. Which means I don’t know what to do to help.’
‘Because Steve said it was more personal and there weren’t that many to be written seeing as most of the team is living here.’
‘Wha- I think so? I’ve never held this form for long so I’m unsure how to do so, but I know Jotuns can usually create ice weapons as an extension of their limbs.’
‘Wait really?’
‘A bar in town,’ Deadpool pulls his mask back down, tacos now finished. ‘Someone needs some help they can put in a request there. I’ve threatened boys stalking teenage girls, got granny’s back their stolen money, even once beat up an abusive ex-boyfriend. Not mine obviously. Problem is, Spidey, they can’t all pay. And ever since darling Captain America took down SHIELD, there’s not been much work coming in from those wonderful people.’
‘Yeah you do,’ he laughs.
super
‘-well he’s not wrong,’ Tony barks out a laugh.
he grumbles to himself as he paces the kitchenette, trying to ignore the amused look from Steve.
‘Not like you to be so jumpy when on a hunt,’ they quip from next to him.
‘I just…I couldn’t stop myself. And I was saying things I
‘Alright. Look I got to go, I’ll call you back.’ Sam hangs up and goes to rejoin the group as they get ready to leave. Peter watches them all go, smiling as he sees MJ talking to Harry so he doesn’t get left out.
‘If he’s able to he’ll join us later.’ A cheer interrupts him as Valkyrie comes away victorious and sits on a stool, smugly drinking from her mug.
‘Pleasure to meet you ma’am’ Steve says, bending down and pressing a kiss to her cheek.
‘Don’t worry, Stevie, it’s not like Tony’s going to let you go wrong.’
Tony, still trying to hold in his laughter, gestures for Bruce to answer.
‘You and Barton,’ Loki elaborates. ‘I did envy you both that friendship when I first arrived you know? It was everything I had once had with my brother and then thought I’d lost. Perhaps that’s why I lashed out so much when you held me captive. I am sorry,’ he turns to look at her, ‘for what I said and did to you.’
‘How did you-?’
what I say,
‘Why do I feel like there’s something else coming?’
‘We discussed it before your arrival,’ Vision answers for Tony, ‘and we thought it was best if only official team members were present during the difficult time of recovery. Having a new member who no one you trusted had previously known would not have made for a conducive healing environment.’
The rest of the meal passes with friendly chatter, catching up on the more mundane aspects of each other’s lives. When they finish eating, all comfortably full, Tony turns to Rhodes. ‘Come on old man, let’s leave the youngsters in peace.’ As they stand to leave he pauses and looks back at Wanda and Vision. He knows he needs to have this conversation, but he’s a little averse to having it the first night. ‘I need to ask you to stay inside for a few days.’
‘And the programme is still running?’ Natasha smiles sourly at the hard note in Steve’s voice.
you can, I’ve seen you in action. Hell I’ve stared at your spandex-clad arse when you’re in action. Doesn’t mean I’m not going to worry about you. I’m sorry I flipped out.’
‘It’s just- well I- well there’s already you and Nat, why do we need a third person?’
talking shop tonight,’ Tony says, making the Captain pout. ‘Someone give the poor kid some clothes to change out of his suit and let’s get this party started.’
A/N: Hi everyone! I hope you enjoyed this week's chapter. My mind is still brain matter on the ceiling after the final Loki episode if I'm honest. Though I'm having a couple of ideas on how I could possibly have a few appearances from some of the characters in this series. If there's any favourites you have do let me know! I've got a basic outline for where the series will go and end, but not too much planned out that I can't make alterations.
‘Good idea,’ Natasha nods, then proceeds to explain everything that has happened since Bruce and Thor left them; she covers the Accords and then the team getting back together, introducing Peter and explaining about Scott.
Wade opens his mouth to respond when he’s cut off by Buck. ‘Hey you two playing a game or what?’
‘You’re focussing on what you’ve lost,’ Bucky’s voice comes to him and he moves his head to where he thinks the man is waiting. ‘Focus on what you still have.’
‘Yeah I guessed as much.’
‘What about Mr Stark’s phone number? Surely you could-’
So there you go! One big summary of the previous series. Now you can either say: “thank god I don’t have to waste my time reading that shit”, or: “hmm I’ll see what this story is like then maybe I’ll check it out”.
Tony shrugs. ‘Sure why not?’
‘Sorry Mr Stark! I didn’t mean I didn’t want spend with you. It’s just, wow you really want me to join in training? I mean are you sure that-’
you.’
Peter can’t help the grin on his face. ‘Shuri?’
to hear herself talk.’
‘I don’t know why I like him,’ he admits, looking down at the ground and leaning back against one of the workbenches. ‘But it just feels- I guess inevitable? He’s always there in patrols and he has my back. There’s so many times he’s turned up when I’ve been getting into a bad situation and he’s got me out of it without a second thought; without me even
‘Completely disagree!’ the teenager responds.
Steve leans back and smiles. It’s amazing really, how much Peter is echoing Tony without even realising it. Looking at the three of them now it isn’t too hard to imagine a night years before in a different room, with the other commandos and Howard sitting around the table instead, the brown haired head would be much younger than Peter, but still bent over the cards in concentration as two adults explained the rules to him.
‘Sorry, sorry, hang on let me bring up the schematics for my new project.’
‘Your protégé and apparently adopted son has started ghosting me, Stark, right at the start of a potentially volatile situation I need his help in. Any comment to make?’ Fury demands.
‘Sorry I didn’t warn you,’ he mutters to the merc, ‘but she really wanted to meet you and I knew you’d freak out if I warned you.’
A/N: So I may have forgotten quite how long this chapter was and how much of it is taken up by Tony & Peter’s bonding father-son style time.
credit.’
‘Kid’s picking up on something.’
‘Would you want to look like the monster you were scared with stories of as a child?’
at me, Stevie,’ Steve sighs and pulls his gaze up from his shoes to look into the earnest eyes of his best friend, ‘you deserve this, you
‘We thought your school might be a good one to start with seeing as they are all known quantities to you,’ Natasha answers, ‘so it’ll be easier to work around them.’
Tony fixes him with a piercing look. ‘Take the mask off, Wade.’
‘Aright, Pete you take your group up to their rooms, we’ll get everyone else settled in. Meet in Briefing Room Five in thirty minutes. Don’t be late!’
‘Sorry!’ Peter jumps away from his friend.
‘Peter we are not talking about-’
‘We’ll start small and slowly build up,’ she reassures him, ‘with you still being at school and with your Avenger duties we don’t want to overburden you, but at least this way you can start to see how things work and then, when you have more time and feel more confident, you can start to become more and more involved if that’s something you want.’
‘Sure we can, Quill,’ Bucky cuts him off, ‘this one just brought back loads of memories for us, why wouldn’t we take it back with us? It’s not about having the best looking trees out there, it’s about having the ones that are right for us and this one right here? This is the right one for us in the dining room.’
‘No one is taking the suit from him again,’ Tony says firmly, signalling for FRIDAY to stop the music.
‘I’d need directions,’ she answers.
‘I’ve lost
Loki’s expression is tight. ‘None yet. I imagine that means he has not regained consciousness. I have not heard of anything being able to block a mental connection before. What of you?’ he asks Strange and Wong. Strange shakes his head.
‘What is it FRIDAY?’ Tony pushes away the medic tending to the cut above his eye. It’s nearly two hours later and the clean up is in progress, thankfully no one has been killed, but there are some serious injuries. Hammer has also remained in custody, so Tony’s focussing on breathing a big sigh of relief.
‘FRIDAY?’
‘I was off site at the time too,’ the archer argues.
Rumlow glares at him. Technically Steve is the same rank as Rumlow, but as he and Bucky are currently on forced medical absence he has to defer to Rumlow while they work towards getting back into active service. Not that Bucky will ever be able to get back into active service if they can’t solve the problem with his arm.
‘At least make toasts we can all understand!’ Shuri complains as the others down their glasses. She quickly refills her own and says something in Wakanda, knocking her drink back and raising her now empty glass in a toast. ‘Or we’ll all start making our way around the galaxy in toasts.’
He blinks his eyes open, wincing at the brightness that assaults his eyes, making them water. Turning his head, his neck muscles protesting, he sees the reason his hand won’t move: there’s a mop of messy brown hair lying on top of it.
‘How about I drive there so you can drink your coffee, and you drive back so we’re home faster?’
Peter flashes him a grin. ‘You’ve already been chosen,’ he hears Natasha’s chuckle from the kitchen and the blond’s cheeks are tinged pink. ‘I think the only other ones are Martin Luther King Jnr, George Washington and Christopher Columbus.’
‘Yeah I get what you mean, and I’ve got this horrible feeling we’re being watched all the time.’ Bucky closes his eyes and reaches out. –
Bucky gives a small laugh. ‘It seems Tony got it into his head that the whole fight between the team was his fault,’ he explains as the doors open and they step into the glass box. Bucky presses the button for the basement where the workshop is. ‘So he’s also decided that he has to be the one to fix everything.’
‘Like you didn’t dream of being a superhero before then.’
‘You want to tell us where the damn things are? I don’t think they’ve had anyone in to clean the place in years, they’ve got to be hiding under a mountain of shit,’ Bucky responds.
After a pause Bucky adds.
‘The latter,’ she rolls her eyes, ‘I’m trying to get him on a creative binge but he’s having none of it.’
Deadpool gives us an update in his own special way
There’s a chorus of cheers and agreements and, as Wade puts his arm around his waist and starts directing him to the kitchenette, Peter keeps his eye on Nebula. She’s now standing at the bottom of the steps and looking at the newly decorated tree with a pensive look on her face.
‘I’m Karen by the way,’ she says, ‘Karen Paige. I work for Nelson and Murdoch. The law firm in Hell’s Kitchen?’
‘And I also found young Peter, though I imagine he would appreciate it if you didn’t comment on the way he turns bright red every time I grin at him.’
‘Good enough. Now let’s go join the part- Peter Benjamin Parker how many do I have to tell you: no eating on the ceiling!’
of entertainment for Tony.
‘Thanks, MJ, love you too,’ he rolls his eyes. Betty comes over to join them.
Natasha scowls as she takes off her sunglasses. ‘You really need to work on your undercover skills,’ she grumbles, taking the offered seat on the bench next to him.
Now, she and Tony are focussing on improving her blast containment, after the incident in Lagos. It’s something she’s still struggling with, mainly because she’s scared of the same thing happening again.
‘Guys?’ Sam enters the common area. ‘Pete’s going to have to get going or he’ll be late.’
‘Tell me, Ross, are you deliberately trying to sabotage the team now? Are you trying to break us up again? Or are you just moving on to trying to take down other members of the team now that you’ve realised you can’t take me out?’ Tony’s voice is cold and hard, and he feels a small sense of achievement at the look of fear that flickers across the other man’s face.
‘I’m not,’ Steve admits, ‘but it’s not my choice, nor is it yours, who Peter decides to spend his time with.’
‘And he didn’t lose his head to Mjolnir?’ Peter asks.
‘You mean you haven’t been looking for other potential threats, Stephen?’ the man asks.
'What happened?' Peter asks, heading towards the bread bin to make himself some toast.
‘Well yeah,’ he shrugs, walking towards the corridor. ‘But that’s what spider-senses are for. I’ve dodged or caught all of it.’
‘Let’s just run with this theory for a second,’ Tony says, ‘which would mean, arguably, the point where this reality split from yours was in your confrontation with Francis. You did something different in your world than your counterpart did here. And that’s what caused the split?’
wait,’ Deadpool reaches out and grabs hold of his wrist. ‘I’m sorry, I just-
He shakes his head. ‘No, Sharon. You’ve come into our home and attacked one of our own. Peggy wouldn’t have wanted this team split up, and she definitely would not have approved of the way you’ve acted. If you want to step foot on this facility again it will only be as part of a delegation that has been sent to meet with the team. Other than that you are not allowed here again have I made myself clear?’
‘I have no idea,’ Steve shivers a little as a new gust of wind rips around them. ‘How are you not cold?’ he frowns at Loki.
‘No. Now it is up to fate,’ Strange replies.
let Valkyrie make you a drink,’ he warns the archer.
‘Peter no!’ Tony cries out, struggling to get up as the teenager launches himself at their enemy.
‘You want to take on HYDRA at less than full capacity just because you want someone to babysit your boyfriend?’ Fury snaps.
Outwardly he rolls his eyes. ‘How do you think I got to this stage? By ignoring those memories? Just get on with it Night King.’
‘But she’s always been an exception,’ Tony adds.
‘Better since we all got back,’ he frowns a little. ‘What do you mean all things considered?’
‘That’s not all, Cap,’ Clint adds, glancing at Tony, ‘Tony had to take the stand today and it seems Hammer’s lawyers are starting with the line of discrediting Tony.’
‘Steve you’re going to have to spell it out for me so I don’t misunderstand something here. Because it sounds like you’re asking to move into my room.’
‘Things have changed, Peter,’ Matt calls from his bedroom. ‘We lost five years. Looking back on what happened during that time…well maybe it wouldn’t be so terrible to help out with the team more often. Your boyfriend seems to be doing rather well with them, and he’s still got the freedom to do his own jobs if he wants. Not to mention he’s still living in New York and it’s not like they’ve forced you to reveal your identity.’
Really it was a thoroughly chaotic couple of hours, with noise levels higher than those Peter had experienced dealing with a baby.
‘His phone is on the countertop,’ the female AI responds. All heads swivel to Natasha, who picks up the abandoned phone with a frown.
‘Hardly,’ Loki growls, then cries out in pain as Lautenus pierces his side and he falls to one knee. A backhand across his face sends him spinning backwards against the wall and he lies on the floor. Motionless.
‘Tony,’ Natasha pauses, then takes a breath and continues, ‘we’ve been called in for a jail break. It’s the jail Hammer’s at.’
Natasha shakes her head. ‘Not yet. He should be out soon though.’
‘Tony you able to get us a bit more audio on the weapons?’ Sam asks.
‘How about a compromise? Ten more minutes and
‘You’re welcome, sweetheart,’ he can hear the eye roll in Steve’s eyes.
‘Alright,’ the man sighs.
Peter looks down and Natasha knows he’s hiding something; she doesn’t want to call him out on it though, not in front of the others. Not in front of Tony. ‘He saved my life,’ comes the quiet response.
Tony looks back over their assembled forces. Behind them, forming the centre of the force, is the Wakandan army and T’Challa’s King’s Guard, on the right is M’Baku’s army, and to the left is the army of Jotunheim. Mixed in amongst them all are warriors from Kamar-Taj and along the front are the Avengers. Wanda is still in the lab with Shuri, ready to destroy the Mind Stone as soon as it has been removed from Vision’s head; Loki has left a small group of Jotun to act as a guard in case any of Thanos’ army gets through, along with some of the King’s Guard, Bruce is doing what he can to assist and Fury is staying with them to help co-ordinate the attack.
‘Seen any sign of who staged this? An explosion that big? Right when we’re turning up. It can’t be coincidence,’ she asks.
‘Oh, ok then. What did you want to talk about?’ May asks.
‘Yeah right, Nutjob, course you did,’ the dark haired man rolls his eyes.
‘Next question: how do we get this bad boy back?’ Wade asks.
be sorry for giving me bruises in bed. Just tell me if I need to wear a high neck.’
‘Is there any way you can track Barnes through that link of yours?’ Fury asks Loki.
‘I take it Bucky was injured as well as Sam and Wanda? Take me to the three of them and I shall see if I can be of assistance,’ Loki cuts off his brother.
‘No! Mr Stark!’ Peter tries to get to his feet but someone hits the back of his head with something hard and he sees stars, trying to fight the darkness threatening to claim him. ‘Tony!’ he calls out.
were the one who made my arm?’
‘Another movie marathon?’
‘Hulk want flags!’ he roars in agreement.
Wade just laughs and pulls him towards the door. ‘Come on, Spidey, even arachnids need their sleep.’
‘Of course not, Captain sir. You said yourself he was a big influence on you.’
As always here's your sneak peek:
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s about to retort when there’s static over the speakers in the prison. ‘Looks like they’ve got things back on line,’ Natasha comments, ‘maybe we can go home soon.’
The soldier doesn’t look at Peter as he straightens up and sighs. ‘The other Winter Soldiers,’ he replies. ‘They used me to train them and assess their progress. They’d all been given different versions of the serum which meant they were stronger than me.’
‘Peter Parker?’ the man asks, and Peter tries not to react as he places the voice.
‘And the way they kissed at the end? That was
‘No your suits are badass,’ Wanda says as she and Vision join them. ‘You’re just an ass.’
‘I’m leaving you Stark Industries. Leaving you basically everything,’ Tony repeats. ‘Steve and Pepper have their own settlements, so do the rest of the team, but after that everything is yours. Including SI. Nat made a good point that by not telling you I wasn’t giving you the chance to learn more about SI if you wanted to; so that’s what this is Pete. If you want you can start to get involved in SI, you can learn about the different parts in the company and you can have a say in what projects we do and don’t take on. Or you can do what I do-’
‘Oh god,’ Steve groans. ‘Monty taught you, didn’t he?’
should tell Widow what’s been going through her Baby Spider’s mind so she can-’
‘A variety of small tasks, their main role is to make life more comfortable for each individual member of the team.’
‘You’ll never turn us against each other,’ Steve spits at him, ‘not again.’
‘We’ll be in touch,’ Fury frowns at the merc. ‘We’ve got someone waiting downstairs to take you to your hotel.’
‘Here you go, Pete,’ Natasha says as she joins them once more, handing over the teenager’s present.
Wanda’s power rips the vest from Peter. He drops to the floor, just as Tony fires his knockout dart. The terrorist’s hand goes to his neck, pulling out the dart with a confused look on his face, before he crumples to the floor.
Tony and Pepper have a chat and Loki notices something that shouldn't be on Earth.
‘No actually I think that was Nebula. She was throwing those things pretty damn hard,’ Sam answers.
‘Shit! Cap we got incoming!’ Clint says. ‘One vehicle heading this way at speed. We need to go now if we’re going to get away without a fight.’
‘Maybe we should give some blank ones to Wade when he gets back,’ Tony says, ‘then he can invite some of his friends if he wants to, seeing as he hasn’t given us their names.’
‘Shapeshifting,’ Vanessa supplies.
‘I thought you said we couldn’t do this for a year?’ he’s trying to be snarky, but is still breathless from the kiss and Wade can’t help but feel proud of that fact.
‘Wait,’ Peter says quietly as he hops onto a stool next to Tony and the others all head to the seats while Wanda gets out everyone’s drink of choice and then joins them, Wade and Rhodey at the bar, ‘you mean you’re letting me drink?’
‘You know, I could have done my nails in the time I’ve spent waiting for you two to catch up,’ she smirks down the comms at them. ‘You ready to move or shall I start on my pedi?’
‘Watch out,’ Tony pulls him back as a car goes spinning past them. ‘What the hell?’
There is one thing about the training room that Tony does love though: the opportunity to stare at a sweaty Steve Rogers.
‘No,’ Valkyrie agrees, ‘but she wouldn’t be happy you’d shut yourself from everyone else she loved just because she wasn’t there. I think she would have wanted her friends and her family to bond together and help and support each other.’
‘Peter if you get a detention to do with school work or your grades start slipping the school has been informed to notify Tony Stark. It’s to make sure that your internship doesn’t affect your education.’
‘That and we’d never be allowed back in the courtroom, and some of us have to give evidence,’ Tony smirks at the archer. ‘Though I do appreciate the sentiment.’
‘You alright?’ she asks him.
‘You really are a jerk, Buck,’ Steve complains from his seat next to Tony. ‘I’ve not even got back to the facility and you’re making my life difficult.’
Tony and Nick begin to explain some of the plan they've been working on, and more allies continue to arrive and provide their input. The preparations to face Thanos begin.
Tony grumbles as the ringing cuts through his dream, and rolls over to see who would be calling at some ungodly hour of the night, and then throw the phone across the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
The confusion on Peter’s face turns to glee as the beginning bars of the trademark Frozen song echo down the corridor. ‘Sure thing Mr Stark,’ his tone is cheery as he whistles along with the melody down the corridor. Tony gives himself enough time to listen to him starting to sing purposely off-key along with Elsa, much to Bucky’s voiced horror, before heading down to the garage.
A/N: Hello everyone! I hope you're still enjoying the story and this chapter was a bit of a peek into where we're off to next.
‘Vision help a guy out here,’ Rhodes pleads.
managed to get away with no one finding out about the last one.’
‘How many did we win?’ Tony asks, gut clenching at the look on Strange’s face.
Fury sighs. ‘I know. I’m just not sure how to enlighten the rest of the team.’
‘Who are you?’ he demands, hoping his voice doesn’t sound shaky. He puts a hand into his pocket reaching for his phone.
he prays, closing his eyes and reaching out with one hand,
‘I agree!’ Peter huffs, passing him a glass from a cupboard. Loki thanks him and gives him a genuine smile, offering the carton to the boy when he’s finished.
‘Wait, how does the kid know?’ Foggy demands.
‘I’ll get him,’ Clint waves at him. ‘You deal with the truck.’
‘The scary thing is,’ Wanda tells Steve, ‘he
‘I thought you were supposed to be trying to make him feel better?’ Wanda asks as she reads Peter’s response.
‘Can’t a man come home and have a drink in peace, honey bear?’
‘Rocket I told you this was a bad idea!’
‘Kid you’re rambling,’ Natasha cuts him off. ‘What’s happened?’
. So much cooler than Black Panther.’
There’s been some rather interesting moments he’s been called in to help with. One of the moments that sticks in his mind was when Thor and Tony were working with Thor’s lightning and the god had managed to short the electrics in the training room which, when Tony had gone to look at, had then electrocuted the inventor and sent him flying across the room; despite his assurances he was fine Thor had insisted that Bruce came to check him over. The sight of Tony Stark sitting propped up against a wall, with the god of thunder rivalling Steve in the mother hen department, with his hair sticking up all over the place and a large purple egg blooming on his forehead from where he’d hit the wall had Bruce doubling over in laughter and having to try and tend to his friend through tears streaming down his face. Other than bruised pride and the lump on his head Tony had been fine, but Bruce had still insisted JARVIS wake him up regularly through the night in case he had a concussion. The inventor hadn’t come out of his workshop for a week until the lump on his forehead had gone and Clint was still upset he hadn’t got to see Tony’s ‘electrician’ look as it had since been dubbed. Steve had been beside himself with worry for the whole week, though had tried to hide it from the team, but Bruce had walked in on him asking JARVIS for updates on the inventor throughout the whole week.
‘Um…guys? What’s Doctor Strange doing? It looks like he’s having a fit,’ Peter says, point at the wizard who is floating cross-legged in mid-air, he’s sporting his new Iron Spider suit. There was no way Tony was letting him come into this without his upgrade.
There’s a beat of silence.
‘What are you doing on Earth?’ Tony demands, pressing the arc reactor in his chest and Steve feels slightly better at seeing the genius’ iconic red suit slipping into place around his body.
Steve grins and captures his lips in a bruising kiss that leaves Tony a little breathless when he pulls away. ‘Deal.’ He gives a small laugh. ‘You know I’ve been wanting to kiss you since the gala.’
‘We can talk more tomorrow,’ T’Challa cuts across Fury, ‘about how we shall face HYDRA and if our new friends wish to continue to offer and receive help as part of the Wakandan Accords. Tonight we have a feast and we should celebrate: we have defeated our enemy with far fewer casualties than we first imagined, we have new friends to get to know, and we have finally reached a time post-battle where we can relax. The feast will begin in an hour, I hope that is enough time for you all to prepare. Until later my friends.’
‘Sorry won’t cut it you little shit,’ and then the butt of the gun is smacked into the side of his head and he has to blink to clear the stars. He hears Ned calling his name and tries to wave a hand to show his friend he’s fine.
Loki smiles. ‘Let me show you?’
‘I’ll go over the footage we have of all the encounters with Beck and run diagnostics on EDITH and see what I can come up with,’ Tony says. ‘Peter you feeling up for helping?’
‘Peter, for once do what Tony says,’ Bucky growls at him.
‘You will not take my prize from me,’ Proxima hisses, and launches herself over the combined Jotun and Wakandans blocking her path.
‘I thought it was his Peter-tingle,’ Bucky sniggers, making Peter groan. Why Aunt May had to say that where he could hear he still hasn’t worked out. Nor has he fully forgiven her yet.
‘What have you been doing now, Stephen?’ he demands.
‘What the hell does that have to do with anything?’ Bucky’s voice isn’t quite as bitter as it was earlier, which Tony takes as a good sign.
‘Wanda Maximoff is a member of the Avengers and, as such, has made a promise to protect this world and everybody on it. She is making a concerted effort to improve control of her abilities so as not to cause any unintentional harm in the future; and if I’m honest is working harder than I did building the first Iron Man suit in a cave in Afghanistan,’ the last part of that sentence is spat at the crowd. ‘And perhaps I should remind you that without those powers more than half of the population of Sokovia would still have been within the city limits when it started heading skyward. As it was only a quarter of the population still remained to be evacuated.’
‘You know for such a big bad assassin you are such a wuss,’ she shakes her head. ‘Can you pass the rolls, Sam?’
Stephen sighs and shakes his head as the door closes. ‘He’s always like that. Come on Bucky let’s get you transferred so I can get back to the surgery I’m supposed to be doing.’
‘Thanks for helping me with the demonstration, Pete,’ Steve says, ‘and for not letting me take a mud bath.’
‘We should return to the facility before- ahh!’ Vision cuts himself off with a pained shout as he falls to the floor, the tip of a spear showing through his stomach and being pulled back, as he falls down another alien shape can be seen behind him.
‘I thought we weren’t supposed to see each other until the ceremony?’ Steve says, trying to catch his breath.
‘Don’t you encourage either of them,’ the blond points a finger at his boyfriend and the inventor puts his hands in the air and backs off.
Wanda looks terrified at the two of them. ‘Wanda I’ll get you there,’ Tony says, going to take hold of the girl.
‘Nat I need to know-’ he cuts off with a groan of pain as she knees him in the groin and he lets her go, sinking to his knees.
how stubborn Bucky can be, I can only assume Loki is just as bad.’
Steve’s favourite thing about the training room is being able to box with Bucky just like he’d always wished he could when he was young and curled up in bed fighting off yet another lung infection that could be the one to claim his life.
‘Peter!’ Tony storms into the kitchen. ‘Come out here and control your boyfriend!’
‘- it’ll be the fact Tony broke his word,’ Natasha finishes.
The other man gives himself a visible shake and then, in a much more normal tone, asks: ‘The Avengers know I’m in New York?’
‘Of course,’ FRIDAY says as he finishes his routine and heads towards the door. ‘Would you like me to send a message to Doctor Strange to let him know you will be arriving?’
‘-Yes they generally are in a fight to the death,’ Loki rolls his eyes. ‘Are we going to continue talking or get on with it?’
Pain. That’s the first thing that registers through the fog in his mind. There’s sharp agony in his chest, but if he concentrates he can feel the dull ache in his limbs, and a throbbing behind his eyes.
‘A PR war huh?’ she muses, as Bucky tries to chase after Peter to retrieve his stolen snack. ‘You really have gotten serious, Tony.’
Peter feels icy dread settle into his stomach. ‘I’m an intern at Stark Industries,’ he blurts out, making them turn to look at him. ‘Ned was just asking if I thought Mr Stark would turn up.’
again, honey,’ he drops his voice a little so as not to be overheard, ‘never are you doing it alone I promise.’
‘Considering you’ve been working for HYDRA I don’t think you can be saying much on that front,’ Natasha says. ‘Any last words?’
‘-he took it as a way to control the world because that’s what everyone else had wanted to do,’ Bruce finishes, his eyes wide. ‘But everyone blamed Tony because Ultron used
,’ Peter winces at the use of his alter-ego’s name dripping with anger and sarcasm, ‘just how much fucking research have you actually done on me and how much have you been pretending you know
‘I swear this house breeds dust clouds,’ Sam splutters as he pulls a dust sheet off of one of the chairs as the team tries to find somewhere more comfortable to sit after dinner.
‘I just…he was floundering and didn’t know what to do, and he was just desperate to find something
‘Want to explain why you didn’t mention you were going on a job and I’ve not been able to contact you in nearly a week?’ the teen shoots back, glare just as fierce as the one Wade sends him.
‘Are you two giving your Dad a hard time?’ an amused voice says from the door.
‘Thank you, Tony,’ Steve says, placing a hand on his shoulder.
The man shrugs. ‘I thought it was a fitting summary. Hand me your phone, Spider-Man, ain’t no one going to get hold of my web slinger.’
‘No,’ he replies by throwing Peter’s water bottle to him, ‘I’ve just got an idea of your fighting style and what you need to work on now and it’s easier to have this discussion whilst having a break than when you’re in the middle of a fight.’
‘Oh for the love of-!’ Quill curses as everyone else bursts out laughing. Loki resumes his seat and winks at Valkyrie.
Take care everyone!
‘Good point, maybe I don’t want you to get worse.’
‘That depends on how much of a punk you insist on being,’ Bucky replies, crossing his arms over his chest.
Bucky feels Loki’s surprise and it does nothing to reassure him. The trickster has so many thoughts in quick succession to try and work out the cause that Bucky can barely keep up. -
Bruce laughs. ‘As long as Tony isn’t quiz master. Although he’ll be just as bad as a contestant.’
‘Yeah, because he’s turning into more of a dad than I am,’ he laughs, ‘and I told Pete that. He only got angry because he was so scared Venom was going to come back for him. They’ll make up and be fine. Peter’s terrible at holding a grudge.’
Bucky shoots Wanda a warning look. ‘No trouble from me, fellas,’ he says, holding up his hands and walking slowly up to them. ‘Now, which way we going?’
‘Are you going to hit me again?’ Steve asks as the door closes behind them.
‘Yes thank you General,’ T’Challa rolls his eyes as Shuri snickers at the two of them.
‘Let’s get home, Happy,’ Tony says, as he and Steve take a seat either side of Peter at the back.
Valkyrie tries to hold back her laughter, and only lets a snort of amusements escape before trying to get rid of the smile on her face as Peter frowns up at her. ‘Thanks. I just got rid of the last lot of bruises!’
Before either of them can say anything else there’s a soft thump from behind them. ‘Hiya fellas,’ Natasha grins at them, ‘just thought I’d drop by.’
‘From what I saw on the way in I’d say we’re near Long Island,’ Clint says, looking at him out the corner of his eye.
the case, maybe think about what you just said and why that wouldn’t have helped.’
‘When I heard that quote from Ross this morning,’ he replies, and the three of them fall into step walking along the corridor.
‘They do say that a problem shared is a problem halved,’ Vision comments, leaning back in his chair.
Love always,
In answer Loki points upwards then, before the other man has chance to process what he’s looking at, he darts in and places a quick kiss on the mercenary’s lips. ‘I believe that puts me in the lead,’ he smirks before walking off.
‘Someone could walk in, they may come looking for you and we can’t-’
‘You need anything, Baby Boy,’ Wade says quietly as he places one last kiss to his mouth, ‘you tell me and I’ll be there.’
Several things then happen at once.
‘We aren’t,’ Bucky laughs. ‘Because otherwise I’m not sure even you could cover what Steve would lose.’
Peter frowns as he recognises the inside of the Stark jet. Happy’s voice comes through the speakers. ‘You handle the suit. I’ll handle the music.’
‘Only because of what you taught me Mama Rhodes,’ he laughs, helping his friend settle his mother into her room.
He puts a hand on her shoulder. ‘You don’t need to understand it right now, and anyway Christmas means different things to different people; the meaning can change for you anyway. I always used to think it was just another excuse to get drunk and party, and it’s only really been since spending it with the team that I’ve started to look at it the same way Peter does. For me it’s also a time to spoil everyone when they can’t complain I’m spending too much on them.’
They pull up at school and Tony gets out the car, popping the trunk and passing him his suitcase. He pulls the teen into a tight hug. ‘Have fun, Pete, and try not to think too much about super-hero stuff while you’re gone alright? You deserve a break.’
up and you’ll be fine for tomorrow. But I suggest finding a way to get some more food into you for the rest of the visit.’
‘Do you really think he doesn’t love you?’
Rumlow growls and then spins to face Tony, reaching to his back and pulling out a handgun, holding it pointing straight in the middle of Tony’s forehead. Steve reacts by reaching back and pulling out his own gun, aiming straight for Rumlow.
‘I think we’ve got a lot to catch up on,’ Harry laughs as Peter bangs his head on the desk again.
‘Neither did we,’ Bruce laughs, ‘and I thought you said you couldn’t make it?’
‘Hey we were doing well!’ Rocket argues, ‘then Sam made me drop my bomb.’
A loud bang echoes through the room, and suddenly the gun and fingers against the back of his head are gone. Another loud bang and he hears a thump behind him.
’ Deadpool asks, voice sounding a little lost.
be good enough for you in my book, he’s as close as you’re going to get. Besides,’ he shrugs and releases Peter’s shoulders, a small smile at the boy’s shocked expression, ‘if his first instinct to protect you from
‘And you aren’t?’ he challenges the archer.
‘Sam? Sam!’ she turns to look at him, seeing the man’s eyes are closed and tries not to panic. ‘Dammit, don’t do this to me bird brain.’
Love always,
Peter can’t quite place the look Steve gives him, but the soldier is called back to the group before he can respond.
And they have no way of stopping them.
‘Well not necessarily
‘Yeah I’ll give you that, but there’s no heat behind the majority of them.’
‘Whose side are you on?’ he demands.
They’re quiet until he closes the door with a soft click, then Tony offers him a hand. ‘Come on, Champ, let’s get you up.’
‘Oh shut it all of you!’ Tony shouts, immediately regretting it as he struggles for breath; Peter is supporting him within a heartbeat and helps the inventor to a seat. ‘Wade you stay where you are.’
‘Ugh if you two are getting all lovey-dovey I’m out of here,’ Sam pushes away from the bar.
‘Somehow I thought we’d end up with me becoming a therapist,’ Strange sighs with a chuckle. ‘Everyone can see you’re holding something back, Peter. I’ll admit I was hoping that this exercise of yours would end up with you confiding at least
‘Yes, thank you Bruce I think we get the picture,’ Natasha rolls her eyes. ‘And I’ll be honest it’s frankly terrifying.’
Bucky looks at the doorway where Loki is leaning against the frame. ‘You really need to ask now?’ he looks back down, knowing his question is unfair.
There’s a pause, then she sighs. ‘I thought he’d said he doesn’t want to be an Avenger? What’s the point in having him up there so often, Tony? You trying to wear him down?’
‘Loki!’ Tony calls out, starting to move towards their friend.
‘I think,’ Tony replies with a small smile, ‘it’s more a case of what can we do for each other?’
He catches Wade first, as the mercenary is sneaking off to finish knitting the last of the Christmas sweaters, which Loki certainly hasn’t worked out and is keeping the knowledge to himself after a bribe from Peter at all.
It had been Natasha who had taken him for that first training session, spiriting him away before Steve could notice they’d gone and gently putting him through his paces, only increasing the intensity once she was happy he was comfortable at their current level. He still hasn’t thanked her properly. When the Wakandan Accords get agreed, and he has no doubt that Tony will find a way to get them agreed no matter what obstacles people put in his way, Bucky knows that Tony, Steve, Natasha and Fury were going to make one hell of a leadership team. Fury as, in Tony’s words, ‘the ultimate super spy leader’, Steve as combat leader, Tony as their head of all things remotely science related, and Natasha in charge of training. They’d agreed Nat’s role in the week they’d joined Peter on his patrols.
‘Oh my god, you’re Spider-Man.’
‘You pulled me out of the water,’ he replies, ‘I think it should be me thanking you. Either way you know what this means?’
‘Wanda? No using your powers on the actual flag itself, but you can on anything else.’
‘Mr Stark are you now fully recovered after your confinement?’
‘You know what? We should do this more often.’
‘Reminds me of the ones I had as a kid when money was tight,’ Sam adds, ‘my brother and I would fight over who got to hang the decorations up because there wasn’t as much room. Still say those trees always looked the best. We’d make extra ones out of paper to stick on to cover up the bare bits.’
‘Shit, no way,’ the man pushes him back and looks at him and Peter remembers he doesn’t have his mask. Deadpool is seeing him for the first time. ‘You- you’re-’ he’s cut off by the sound of more men coming closer on the floor below them. ‘Shit. Get out of here and get your fucking mask on, Spidey. I’ll hold them up as long as I can. Old Tin Can’s holding his own for now.’
‘He even took away my entry override,’ Rhodes gripes. ‘Though you should have seen his reaction when Vision phased through the wall to say good morning. It was priceless.’
‘Just tell us if we need to watch out for anyone. So far we’ve been able to avoid most people. There seem to be a worrying lack of guards here, but plenty of scientists.’
attached to Bucky’s shoulder. ‘I don’t even know

Here's your sneak peek:
Wanda smiles at him encouragingly. ‘Sure.’ She turns to Wade. ‘Come sit next to me, Wade. I’ll make sure the team leave you alone.’
‘I know, but I’d rather it wasn’t the first day I was on the stand.’
‘Sam! Steve’s coming!’ he hears the woman shout and he tries to encourage a little more speed out of his legs as he hears the soldier thundering up behind him.
‘Well yeah, I mean he didn’t have any reason
‘But before you turned up I did
‘I love you, Pep.’
Rhodes just ignores him and turns to the soldier. ‘Give me the key Sergeant and I’ll get them both out of your hair.’
‘Rhodey come on, it’s fairly normal for me to pull the occasional all-nighter,’ he defends himself.
?’ Sam asks. ‘Tony are you
They’d started off small, improving the control of her powers that was already strong, and are now pushing for more intricate and powerful displays. Each fortnight they go to a nearby military base where she demonstrates her powers for a group of military officers that had been chosen by Rhodes. They’re all neutral parties and send reports back to the committee. She’d been surprised the first time, Rhodes and Tony had both come with her and Rhodes had joked with the military men as he would with any of the team. They treat her like another soldier and for that she’s grateful. They also listen when she tells them she’s getting tired, and stop the demonstration.
‘Pete, you know Beck’s not going to be-’
A/N: Hi everyone. I'm so sorry I'm late in updating this week, I had a bit of an interesting weekend and didn't get chance to update. I hope it was worth the wait though I'm not so sure if it is yet.
‘I’m afraid, Anthony,’ Hammer says, voice growing more oily as a satisfied smirk crosses his face. ‘That you’ll be a little too busy to worry about little old me.’
‘Why do you not just follow one set? Why combine them all?’ she asks.
‘You’ve become quite the diplomat, Tony,’ Steve comments.
Pepper walks in to the main common area to find them all still brainstorming ideas. ‘What on earth are you doing?’ she asks, putting her work files down on the counter. ‘Tony you were supposed to do a video conference with some of the stakeholders earlier, where were you?’
‘Right well let’s see if I can make some space for you guys to crawl through or something. You got any room to move stuff your side?’
Tony’s brain starts to slow down and he takes in Bucky standing behind Natasha, hand to his face.
‘Uh, yeah sure,’ Steve says, turning and leaving the kitchen. His mind is racing, and he’s trying to work out just what it is that’s causing it. It’s only after he’s passed Rhodes and Sam talking on their way to the kitchen and Wanda tells him she’ll get Vision that he realises how domestic the whole situation is.
‘That was surprisingly easy,’ Wanda comments.
‘I’m unsure. I doubt they have the strength for the invasions they organised before, and the Casket of Ancient Winters, which held much of their power, was lost with Asgard’s destruction. It could be, having heard what happened to us, that they have discovered we have taken refuge on Midgard and could be looking to get revenge for the past, either on me alone or on Asgard as a whole.’
Sighing in resignation he takes a seat on a bench and leans back, letting the spring sunshine warm his face and taking a bit of pleasure in the outdoors for the first time in a while. Closing his eyes he contemplates letting himself doze off for a couple of minutes.
He has to admit Natasha’s done a good job of training the kid. The spy’s fighting style lends itself to the teen’s super speed and coupled with his advanced warning system Peter’s giving Bucky one of the trickiest fights of his life. The soldier’s still able to land a couple of hits, though not as many as the teen does; he calls a break when he realises the reason Natasha has asked him to train with the kid today.
Tony shakes his head and a small smile and replies to the teen’s text.
‘I’ll do my best.’
‘You know who I am?’ Tony, for once, sounds unsure of himself.
Natasha has always spent a good part of her time in the training room, for a variety of reasons. Initially it was habit, then it became a way to scope out the abilities of the team she was to work with, and then to build relationships with the people she’d work with for a couple of months before moving on to a solo mission or another team.
‘Start it at New Year,’ Natasha suggests with a glint in her eyes. ‘I’d love to see Fury get drunk.’
‘I’ve latched onto your memory so we can watch it together,’ Strange explains, appearing as a ghostly figure next to him. ‘This will enable me to find the Symbiote’s signature in your mind and then allow me to search for any other trace of it. The longer we watch the better of an idea of its signature I will have. Do you mind?’
Bucky barks out a laugh. ‘Wow, such a charmer Stevie. I hope you’re more complimentary to Tony.’
Peter closes the space between them so he’s standing close enough to feel the warmth from the man’s body, dropping the end of the web he reaches a hand up to brush over the bald head. ‘I’m looking at you right now, and I don’t see anything disgusting. I finally get to look at one of my best friends, and there’s nothing not to like.’
‘And why he’d need protection,’ Natasha adds. At a few questioning glances she elaborates. ‘Who else do you think could have picked him up if not us?’
‘I’m not living that down for a while am I?’
‘What the hell is going on?’ Loki looks up from his spot at Fury’s feet to answer the man’s question.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You some kind of stylist or something?’ Rocket demands.
‘You see my brother is not one to form attachments to people, it is quite honestly a miracle he has stayed here for as long as he has and I assume it is because of you. Or primarily because of you, I believe the rest of the team also has a part to play. Regardless I just wished to ask you not to enter into any stronger form of relationship with my brother if your intentions are not honourable, and if you do and you should hurt him there is not a corner of the galaxy you can go to that I will not find you in and tear you apart with my bare hands. Ah there’s Steven! I think they have found some trees. Come!’
Everyone laughs. And they continue to work out their plan of action as the food steadily disappears. After lunch Rhodes heads over to the facility to see if anything has come up there that might be of use while everyone else starts setting up the house.
Tony teaches Steve how to dance, but the two have a huge argument. The only one able to get through to Tony is Bucky.
‘Yeah- yeah we should,’ Steve’s brain is still trying to catch up with what just happened. As Tony heads towards the door he calls out to him. ‘Tony? You know we’re probably going to fight again but… I just want you to know I’m not going to be afraid to say sorry anymore.’
time ago. Honestly? When it gets too bad I just tend to block it out and think of projects I’ve got going on.’
‘How come Wanda and Nat aren’t surprised?’ Sam asks, looking at the two women.
‘You can’t do much in the state you’re in now,’ Tony reasons with him. ‘At least stay here until you’ve healed a bit, then you can go protect your girl. In the meantime I’ll get a team to watch them on the down-low. How does that sound?’
‘Well it’s rather simple really. Everyone has to catch everyone else under the mistletoe at least once over the holiday,’ the old woman says, cackling a little at some of the wide-eyed expressions she receives.
‘Letting me lead this time, Iron Man?’ he teases softly.
‘Bruce I really don’t think it’s a good idea to keep him here considering-’
He knows he owes the fact he’s been able to follow Wanda unnoticed thanks to the girl herself. It was something they’d experimented on together with Vision before Thanos had arrived, and obviously whatever had gotten hold of her mind had made her forget. Wanda had placed a spell on his Iron Spider suit, working her power into the nanites which meant he was protected from her mind reading abilities and, they hoped, from others with similar abilities.
Wanda lands elegantly next to him just as Proxima prepares herself in a fighter’s stance. It’s that momentary pause for breath before the fight begins again, and Tony realises he’s getting tired.
Strange is quiet as Wong leaves, and Loki only lets him stew in his own thoughts for a little time before interrupting them. ‘The team are your friends you know.’
‘No. Why would you say that?’ he huffs, looking over at Happy as he digs his phone out again to respond to Wade’s text, the driver is looking in the rearview mirror obviously eavesdropping on their conversation.
‘Rhodey and Stephen,’ she replies, ‘and JARVIS of course.’
‘Ok, so no pressure,’ Wade rolls his neck. ‘Just nearly fourteen sweaters to get knitted before Christmas. That’s roughly one sweater every day and a half.’
She looks so unsure as she carefully takes the topper from his hands and makes her way to the set of small step ladders they’d set up next to the tree; she climbs them and pauses at the top before gently placing the angel on the top.
She pulls him to a stop, shock on her face. ‘You caught Bruce under the mistletoe and Hulk
Peter nods. ‘Yeah, um, so things are going well I guess?’
‘Oh yes,’ the second woman sounds far too excited, ‘it was a proper “shots fired” at Tony Stark that one.’
Just then there’s a commotion over the comms. ‘We’re being attacked!’ Fury’s frantic voice comes over the comms. ‘Repeat: we are being attacked! One broke through. She’s come for Vision.’
‘Welcome to the world of being Spider-Man,’ Peter sighs.
to get Loki to back down from his bloody stupid political stand, so don’t you dare.’
please, Buck. We don’t need any more sour moods in the car,’ Steve pleads.
‘I’m deadly serious. Now you better get out of here before someone thinks you’re here to gate-crash properly.’
teach you when we get back,’ he smiles. Then the black suited guards, with HYDRA’s sigil on their shoulders, appear at the door to his cage.
So although the training room isn’t Tony’s favourite part of the facility, it’s not his least favourite either. That’s definitely the medical wing.
‘We shall dine downstairs,’ T’Challa reassures them. ‘And no one will comment on whether or not you have found time for a shower, Clint.’
‘Then who the fuck made a reactor to-’ Bucky trails off, and she can
‘Aww was my kiss so good you can’t even snark properly?’
Wanda smiles, turning her face up to the sunshine as she and Vision walk along the street; they’d been to watch a movie and were now heading to have lunch; it wasn’t a warm day as such, but the sun was just warm enough to be soothing on her face and it made her smile much easier than it had been in the past few days.
As always here's your sneak peek:
Spider-Man and Deadpool meet an interesting character dressed all in red, and Deadpool tells Spider-Man a little of his past before leaving for a job.
‘You said you’d never had a food fight!’
,’ Lautenus spits at him, ‘not only does it secure my Council’s pleasure, but it will also serve to win over the hearts of my people: by defeating the criminal who tried to wipe our planet from existence.’ His hand gesture cuts off Loki’s protests. ‘Enough. I issue a challenge to you, Loki Laufeyson, to claim the throne of Jotunheim. You have no choice but to accept. The fight is to the death. If you do not accept,’ he gestures to the three Jotuns behind him, ‘I shall order the execution of your friends.’
‘I said I was sorry!’ He takes her offered glove and sets about changing the grenades loaded into it and makes a couple of changes to the targeting system. ‘So what has you coming for my charming company today?’
‘Oh for-‘ Tony throws his hands in the air. ‘What is it kid? Put us out of our misery.’
‘T’Challa,’ she greets him warmly, ‘we are about to take our leave of Wakanda, and I understand you shall soon be leaving for Vienna?’
Peter shrugs. ‘Dopinder is Pool’s usual ride,’ he tries to explain as innocently as possible. He barely remembers not to run up and give the man a hug, instead keeping pace with his mentor, and giving his partner an encouraging smile. ‘Hey Pool.’
‘You may know what I am,’ Wanda tells her, voice firm, ‘but you have no idea
‘Up here!’ Sam calls, swooping down and grabbing it as more of the aliens jump up, trying to get it from Hope. ‘Hey!’ Chitauri gliders lunge down, trying to grab hold of both him and it, and it takes all of Sam’s flying skills to out-manoeuvre them. ‘Guys a little help would be- what the actual

Natasha snorts. ‘I wasn’t going to
Bucky says nothing, face and gaze blank.
Wade sighs. ‘I’ve been doing it when you’ve all been busy and just powering through.’
Tony looks at what his AI is showing him and feels his face go white.
‘Can you get us there?’ Peter turns to Strange. ‘Can you get a portal open to get us there?’
‘Need me to pick it up?’ Clint offers.
‘Hands off my kid, Hammer,’ a metallic voice says from above them, and Peter feels himself relax slightly. Everyone has stopped around them to watch what’s happening.
‘Yeah but-’
‘Simple really,’ Peter swallows down his nerves. ‘You let Wanda go.’
‘One day,
She smiles a little at that. ‘Alright, alright. Now go to the bar and loosen up you lot, you’re all becoming worriers. There’ll be lines forming on your faces before you’re back if you aren’t careful.’
Peter casts a quick glance around to make sure no one heard Ned’s statement. ‘Keep your voice down. And I am

‘Wall crawling abilities,’ the teen responds as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. ‘So can someone like try and take this thing down? I mean I’ve got it distracted so it’s not going to go through the army. Man where’s Wade when you actually
‘Go mad or don’t use it at all whatever you want,’ Tony shrugs. ‘You’re not going to bankrupt me.’
ass.’
Peter yawns as their Chemistry teacher drones on and on about something he’s given up listening to about half an hour ago. He taps his pencil on the table in an attempt to hold off death from boredom, but after the fifth nudge from Ned in his ribs he takes pity on his friend and stops.
‘Not now, Steve,’ Strange’s voice is gentle. ‘Not yet.’
‘He really thinks a lot of Wade doesn’t he?’ Steve says, coming up to put an arm around his shoulders.
‘Well you’ve already got one there,’ she tells him, watching as he sends Tony flying by swatting him with the flag as if he’s a giant bug. It’s only Rhodes managing to catch him that stops him ending the same way as Peter.
, he thinks as they take off after the car.
‘Now look here, Pete, just because you caught me doing one of them doesn’t mean-’
‘It’d be a bit wrong of us to give one murdering psycho a second chance and not another,’ Tony shrugs.

‘I haven’t finished my ice cream!’ Loki protests, looking between the bowl and the teenager and pouting.
‘Wanda,’ gentle fingers under her chin make her face him, ‘I do not believe for one second that you would hurt anyone with your powers, intentional or otherwise. Everyone has a stumbling point with their abilities, and this is yours, and you
‘Not quite good enough, Wanda,’ Agatha cackles.
‘No it’s just Mr Murdock I need to see,’ he cuts her off. ‘It’s alright I can wait.’
‘I better not risk it,’ Wanda smiles, ‘I’ll help mediate.’
‘Stark! What are you-’ Ross is cut off by Tony blasting the door open and throwing the man away from the microphone and against the far wall. The two guards in the room look towards their guns and then decide to take a step back.
? I mean Peter can’t even do gym class without getting out of breath.’
‘Asshole,’ he mutters with a small smile. He makes his way out of his room to find Natasha and Sam, hoping one of them would have some news of how T’Challa’s call had gone. They’re sat on some sofas, looking out over Wakanda and talking about home.
‘Clint are you in Rhodey’s suit?’ Tony’s voice comes through the helmet.
‘When do you ever?’ Bucky mutters.
Bucky pauses halfway to the door and sighs, feeling some of the fight leave his body. He hates talking about that time, hates remembering what he was forced to do for the very people he had tried to take down. He’d been wary of Vision before coming back, knowing what he did about his abilities and worrying the android would try and take over his mind; it was only Steve’s assurances that had meant he was willing to try and come back at all. If Wanda hadn’t been fighting on their side when he first met her he imagines he would have felt the same way about her. ‘They brainwashed me,’ he replies after a few moments of silence, not turning to face the god however. ‘They took away my memories, took away who I was. I was just a machine to be used as they wanted. I was their Fist.’ He looks down at his clenched metal hand. ‘They turned me into the thing I had started fighting against, and they nearly succeeded in making me kill Steve. If Thanos has people that can use mind control I want to know that what they did to me isn’t going to make it easier for him to turn me against my friends.’
‘FRIDAY? Get me footage from EDITH,’ Tony snaps.
They enter the common area to a fierce debate going on.
‘You know I won’t,’ Rhodes lifts his bottle towards Tony with a smirk.
‘Agent Natasha is approaching for her morning cup of coffee as well, please replace the pot so I can get her blend prepared.’
‘I love you.’
‘Wait… I know that voice,’ Tony sees the moment the penny drops on Clint’s face and the archer’s expression turns dangerous. ‘Deadpool,’ he growls out.
‘Ok,’ the doctor nods, ‘Scott, Rocket and Bruce I want you three here to guard the flag. Scott stay small where they can’t see you, Bruce I want you to be eyes next to the flag and guarding it. Rocket I want you hiding around the obstacle course ready to create mayhem when they arrive.’
‘You don’t call me that,’ she growls at him. Before anyone can react, she’s wrapped Peter in her magic and thrown him into the far wall.
‘Scary?’ Peter offers.
‘In his defence,’ Nick says, taking a seat at one of the stools, ‘I agreed it was for the best. Meant we could continue laying some groundwork without Ross picking up on it.’
‘Pairs!’ Sam declares when they get outside, all of them wrapped up warmly against the cold.
‘What are you doing?’
‘I’m sorry?’ Sharon’s voice is dangerous.
‘Nat leave the poor kid alone,’ Steve says. ‘Otherwise he’ll never come back.’
As always here's your sneak peek:
Tony just grins and pulls him in for a kiss. ‘That’s a “what took you so long?” but if you want it be “yes” instead then it can be a yes.’
‘You’re impossible,’ Steve chuckles, pressing a kiss to Tony’s mouth and then standing up. ‘Make your call, honey, I’ll have your coffee waiting for you when you come up.’
Tony barely registers the woman leaving, he’s worriedly watching Wanda who seems to be struggling in the situation. If he had to guess he’d say her powers were picking up on the disappointment from the gathered viewers.
‘It’s not that I don’t think he’s capable of doing something nice for people,’ Steve hurries to explain. ‘It’s just…’ he struggles to find the words for what he’s feeling.
‘We got attacked.’
Strange nods stiffly in answer to the last question. ‘Why are you offering to do this?’
Thor takes it blindly. ‘You saved my life.’
‘Everyone got their present?’ Steve asks.
‘Not even dear Doctor Strange was enough to help you,’ she taunts and Wanda forces herself to look up, Strange is looking exactly how she feels and she can see his hands shaking from here.
‘For now no,’ Loki shakes his head, ‘but I’ll need you to come with me to Wakanda. I imagine we shall need some of the army to join us there to fight against Thanos.’ The female Jotun simply bows her head in acceptance.
‘Hey!’ he tries to pull away again but Loki’s grip is strong.

Thor surges forwards, getting a better grip on Stormbreaker to slice at the Titan and scrambling to his feet, belatedly realising it was
‘You going to join me any time today?’ the inventor asks, raising an eyebrow.
‘What did you do?’ Agatha demands.
aching,’ Quill groans as they make their way through Central Park to where Tony had seen the carollers would be.
‘Are you going to carry all the presents for the both of us?’
‘Guys can we not throw the baking ingredients around- oh right that does it Bucky it’s on!’ Sam shouts, picking up an egg and throwing it at the super soldier. ‘Oops sorry Doc.’
‘No you just didn’t want them to play with your toys,’ Rhodes interrupts with an eye roll.
‘I don’t want to talk about it alright?!’ Peter yells, finally looking at his mentor and fighting back the tears blurring his vision. There’s absolute silence in the room; Bucky and Steve are looking between him and Tony with wide eyes, because this is the first time Peter’s ever shouted at anyone. Let alone Tony.
‘-and then I want you to find the hospital that is currently treating the soldier who volunteered for the prosthesis project, a one James Buchanan Barnes, and I want you to get me an appointment to see the team treating him.’
‘You don’t seem to be doing too bad considering,’ Bucky looks the man up and down.
‘See you on Monday!’ Ned waves, a big smile on his face. No one says anything until the front door closes behind him and he disappears out of sight up the stairs to his flat.
‘Well I’m glad you listen to one of us when we protest at least. You shall have to stay very close, Winter, to protect me.’ The puppy yelps in agreement causing everyone to laugh.
‘But why would you-’
She looks over her shoulder as Sam and Quill come over, her hands up as she finishes stringing the lights on the large tree they’d already set up. ‘No thanks, Sam, we’re good. We’re going to start on the ornaments soon so you might want to fetch your wings, and don’t let Pete convince you to take him up on his webs: Tony’s forbidden him from decorating the tall one saying he doesn’t want any broken trees or bones in the run up to Christmas.’
‘Don’t get too cocky,’ Strange chastises, seemingly still fairly sober, ‘you don’t know how much longer you’ll be lasting.’
‘Like what?’ Tony laughs.
‘Yeah thanks,’ he responds, the bruises are darker than yesterday, but he definitely looks more alert. ‘And thanks for letting me speak with Cassie last night Tony, really set my mind at ease.’ Tony just waves him off as Natasha offers to make the new arrival some breakfast as well.
‘I hacked into the old Iron Man files,’ Peter grins, ‘and I’ve got Tony’s Mark II video to show you when he first did the rocket boots. He goes straight into the ceiling!’
‘No they aren’t, you’re supposed to let us go to the common area until our time is up and we can return,’ Sam protests as he turns in a circle.
‘Everything with Ross has just thrown up the fact that we can’t keep doing this by ourselves anymore,’ Tony says, looking down at his hands. ‘We should have seen it coming, but none of us picked up even a whisper of it. We’ve been too busy focussing on each other that we’ve not been looking at threats from outside, or at least not seeing them for what they are. We need someone who sees the things we don’t; someone who’s better at knowing things than we are.’
‘I can’t blame him. He is something really fucking special,’ Wade’s voice takes on a slightly distracted tone.
No one is surprised when Tony gets up on stage as the gala draws to a close and announces the start of the ‘after-party’, immediately the music picks up in pace. Around half the guests have already left at this point, so there is now more space on the floor for the guests who apparently still have plenty of energy to head to the middle of the room and start dancing to the more upbeat music.
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘What do you think?’ the inventor asks.
‘Five.’
He really does mean to answer Sam’s question first, perhaps bring the conversation round to Mr Harris’ announcement. He really does. Instead, what comes out of his mouth is: ‘Why did no one tell me my school is coming up here for a few days?’
‘It’s just,’ Peter sighs, ‘I was thinking that you shouldn’t have to spend this holiday alone.’
‘Because basically everyone knows who you are,’ Peter rolls his eyes. ‘Take it as a compliment.’ He turns back to Matt. ‘How’ve you been?’
‘You,’ Wade’s still looking stunned as Peter begins to make his way up the stairs. ‘How are you okay with this, Spidey?’ he gestures to his face.
‘Likewise,’ Matt smiles. ‘I hope to see more of you in the future.’
‘As do I,’ she nods. ‘Nakia told me of the fight with your cousin. I am sorry for the pain it must have caused you, to have someone who should have been family turn against you.’
‘I’ll still pass, thank you all the same.’ Loki collapses into a single chair, obviously so he doesn’t come into skin contact with anyone.
Peter’s eyes, if possible, go even wider. ‘Oh god no! Why would you think that? Eww I really don’t want to be thinking about that and May and… can we just not?’ He gives a shudder and then refocuses. ‘No it’s… well see May’s started seeing someone and it seems to be going really well, which is good because he seems like a nice guy and that’s not the problem at all but… well see she either goes to his on the weekends when I’m here, or he comes to ours on the other weekends.’
The trickster moves closer and places his hand over some of the markings, studying them intently. Then he sighs and nods. ‘Yes these are certainly Jotun. It may take me a couple of hours to translate, are you happy for us to remain here?’
‘Well Loki was actually trying to help,’ she flicks some of her hair over her shoulder and takes a sip from her coffee mug, ‘and it backfired spectacularly on him. On the other hand Bucky is currently going through the very thing he was trying to avoid.’
he is your type. So go on, tell me: what’s your plan?’
time I called her that. I think my bruises have bruises.’
‘Do I make myself clear?’ Bucky repeats.
A/N: Hi everyone. I hope you're still enjoying this story. I've decided for the two weeks before Christmas to do a double update. So hope you enjoy the next chapter as well!
‘What?’ Steve doesn’t get an answer to his question as Bucky quickly punches in some numbers and the door silently opens, letting the two men into the workshop. ‘Why do you have an override?’ Steve whispers.
‘How nice of you to bring a friend,’ she continues, gesturing to Strange. ‘Or is he a sacrificial offering to get back on my good side? I mean he’s powerful enough for me to forgive you. For now.’
‘We walk any further and my suit’s going to start freezing up, and I made sure there was anti-freezing systems put in place after my first flight.’
Before Peter can reply his senses go haywire and he feels something pressing into the back of his head through the mask. The merc’s eyes go wide and he scrambles to his feet.
‘What?!?’ a series of voices chorus in unison. Peter can’t help the grin on his face.
He rolls over, eyes adjusting to the dim light and he’s finally able to see her. They’re each in a cell, with a row of old-fashioned iron bars forming the wall between each of them; Wanda’s leaning against the bars that separate them, her hair is falling lank around her face and there are dark circles under her eyes. Apart from looking tired she seems to be unharmed. ‘Hey, you know me, takes more than some knockout gas to keep me quiet for long.’
‘We told him he could have this time to relax,’ Natasha says, voice hard. ‘He deserves it after everything he’s been through recently. You can’t run him into the ground.’
Christmas present. They said you can take as many people to watch as you like, but only four can be racing at any one time. They also let you have a go racing whichever of the vehicles you want. Do you like it?’
Steve frowns at him. ‘Bucky-’ he says in warning, but his friend ignores him and walks off. With a quick glance around the room Steve shrugs and downs the last of his drink, vaguely wondering why he’s nervous and wishing he could actually get drunk, and as no one seems to be paying particular attention to him he follows Tony out of the door.
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘I must have forgotten when they wiped me later on. Loki thinks the memories are coming back because my mind’s been healing more. There’s probably loads more I’m going to remember in the future, but…recently I’ve been remembering meeting you. For the first time.’
Natasha laughs and waves him off, watching as he joins the other two, slinging an arm around both of them.
‘Don’t tempt fate, Tony,’ T’Challa asks. ‘Ah I see one of Peter’s guests has arrived.’
how much he needs to hold back. ‘Besides we’re not doing the whole thing, and it’ll be good for everyone to see how someone without enhanced abilities can cope.’
‘Yeah? Well why don’t you ask him through that weird mental link thing you got going on if he can come down and use some of his magic to help us get this done quicker?’ Sam demands.
‘Yet he still hit you,’ Ross points out, a half smirk on his face.
‘There’s an Italian round the corner from me.’
‘Oh come on, Pete, it is
Pepper’s face hardens again and she nods. ‘Fine, but he’s still not getting access to any of his projects. I’ve given the medical team instructions that he’s not to be allowed any of his gadgets. I’ll see you tomorrow.’ She leaves without another word.
‘I’ll bear that in mind,’ Tony winks at Steve and he finds he’s fighting down a blush. ‘The short version is this: I’m trying to move away from weapons production. I’m not happy with having this as our main source of revenue, and I have reason to believe that someone in my company is dealing under the table and I don’t like it. So while I try and find out who it is I’m branching out, trying my hand at a lot of different projects, all kinds of things from improving medical equipment at lower costs to phones and gadgets. My pet project has been the prosthesis one, the one which you were the first volunteer for. I was led to believe it had been a great success. After digging around after our conversation last night,’ he addresses this to Steve, ‘I’ve now got reason to believe that someone is deliberately trying to sabotage this project and was willing to have Bucky die from apparent complications to put pay to it once and for all.’
The bus comes to a stop at the security gates at the edge of the compound and Peter has to admit it does look pretty impressive. The structure is completely rebuilt, no marks left from when Wanda had brought down half of the building whilst under HYDRA’s influence, and in the far distance you can see groups of soldiers running through drills.
‘Wait,
‘I was doing some work for Tony Stark in an internship,’ he explains, feeling his gut twist with the lie, ‘and he kind of took me under his wing.’
‘Sam’s got to be with us,’ Steve gestures at their friend.
The scarred man simply grins and spreads his arms out. ‘Healing factor.’
‘I told you, I’m here because of our mutual friend.’
There’s a chorus of laughter, and they then have to explain the story of Bucky winning the Christmas tree to the Guardians. Talk then turns to preparations and they make the plan to get the Christmas trees tomorrow. Tony notices Quill looking a little overwhelmed at the other end of the table and makes a note to talk to Wanda about it; he suspects Star-Lord might find this month a little more challenging than he bargained for.
‘And you?’ Bucky demands. ‘We just got to leave you here and hope for the best?’
‘If you speak to Sergeant Barnes,’ Peter chuckles, ‘he’ll say that Captain Rogers still can’t keep his mouth shut.’ That earns a laugh from the crowd, and Steve looks at Bucky out of the corner of his eye; he hands the man a tissue, noticing the tears falling silently down his face.
‘That’s fair,’ she smiles.
‘Pepper,’ he sighs, letting his hand fall flat over Steve’s heart, ‘she knows I’ve been in love with someone else. I never told her. I didn’t need to. She’s always known me too well, but we both slipped into something we could both be content with.’
‘I’ll wound you with my knife in a minute,’ he mutters under his breath, taking his place opposite Valkyrie.
you?’
‘Don’t even think about finishing that question,’ she gives him a weak smile, pulling her own out of concealment. ‘Go help Steve, I’ll cover you.’
‘And not give you an opportunity to prove to the super soldiers how strong you are?’ she teases, getting hold of around half of the boxes with her powers and walking off.
‘Wow, brutal.’
‘Are you trying to drive everyone away from you today?’ another voice asks.
‘That’s fair,’ Tony nods. ‘How about Thor makes the decision?’
‘What do you ‘not from here’?’ Rhodey asks. ‘Like not from America or not from Earth or something else?’
Peter breathes a small sigh of relief. He did
‘Tell Shuri sorry about the window,’ he says, blasting apart the window to the lab and setting Wanda down. There’s not many aliens left, but Proxima Midnight is stood in the centre wielding her staff like she was born with it in her hands.
‘Yeah but we wouldn’t have it any other way,’ he grins as they start hanging the baubles on.
‘Cap! Finally! We need to get him out of here, and fast,’ Scott says, helmet open as he checks over an unconscious Tony.
‘We thought we’d make sure you hadn’t got lost,’ Sam winks. ‘But it looks like you’ve just been staying out of trouble.’
‘Wait, like outside of patrol?’ Peter knows his voice sounds a bit squeaky. ‘Like… what like a date?’
ice right?’ Tony laughs.
‘Think you can get him stable enough to get to Wakanda? I’m sure Shuri will be willing to help you in her labs once we get there.’
Loki cuts in before the doctor can respond and explains what Stephen told him. ‘You need to bring someone from Kamar-Taj to watch over the Sanctum for a couple of weeks. I will take Strange back to the facility where he will be on forced magical rest until he is fully recovered and able to return to his duties without risk to his health.’
‘Yes he reminds me of him too, hopefully this one shall have a better chance, though,’ he smiles at his brother.
Strange looks over the gathered heroes as Tony and Steve make their way back to join the group. All of the kids are inside, being watched over by Laura and watching everything on the screens provided by FRIDAY. One flag has been set up in the grounds on the obstacle course, the other has been set up inside the facility. Bruce wasn’t given a choice on joining in, Tony pointing out he’d avoided far too many things in the past.
‘Let us take the smaller branches off now and then we can drag it to where we shall have the feast,’ Thor cuts across the bickering. ‘Then it will be easier for us to go and carve the table when we have spare time.’
‘You’re one to talk,’ Deadpool sighs, then puts his hands on Peter’s shoulders. ‘I’m trying to keep you safe, Spidey,’ he says quietly.
‘Fuck you, lady,’ I say as I feel exhaustion take over my body, just my fucking luck. Then the world goes black again.
to tell everyone?’ he groans.
