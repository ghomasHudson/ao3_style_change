Without a moment's hesitation, Tony's hands fell to the other boy's jeans and popped the buttons from their holes, attempting to wrestle them impatiently down the hips of their wearer. Steve laughed.
? Howard's condescending scorn echoed inside his head
After her voice died off, the silence that thickened in the air like congealing gravy. It permeated Tony's head as his pulse began to race in his ears; he hated to admit it, but she'd hit the nail right on the fucking
. I refuse to believe that." His almost inability to keep the smile off his face felt oddly foreign but genuine. "You two ladies want another cocktail?"
Steve looked back at him with saliva moistened lips and dilated pupils. "No need to apologise. I was liking where that was going."
"One cosmopolitan for you, madam." He placed the cocktail glass down on the counter next to his mom, before collecting his own glass and carefully balancing the salad bowl in his other hand. Despite it not being a formal occasion, there had been an unspoken decision to sit and eat in the dinning room. Usually, Tony and Maria simply ate in the kitchen, as Howard often neglected to dine with them and it seemed silly to occupy such an expansive space when there were only two of them.
Steve joined him in the living room, a soft smile on his face. Putting down his phone Tony stood and sauntered over.
"Steve...ah!" Tony gasped as he was thrust into. Again, slow and gentle. Kisses were placed along his neck and face. Fingers mapping his body. It was a feeling he could get addicted to.
"It is a great song for catching up with the modern day."
For some reason Uncle Bruce seemed oddly flustered seeing the boy sitting by the table, stuffing his face with pancakes, cream, and berries. Loki was too focused on his food to care. Not aware of the mess he made of himself and his surroundings.
"Simple, we don't."
It wasn't much of a fight. Most of it consisted of trying to gather up the large gas canisters before they caused any damage. The soldier was trying to keep one if the robbers away from him while avoiding hurting him too much. Which wasn't easy because the guy was swinging a canister wildly in front of him. Just as the blond was making his move the man opened the valve on the tube. It started spewing out gas while spun from the pressure. As soon as he realised Steve held his breath for as long as possible while getting away from the white looking mist.
Barton's wife winced and petted her stomach. "Little Natasha is... little Nathaniel." The assassin pouted and muttered something about traitors.
"Quite a few. I agree with a courthouse wedding but you will still need a marriage license and handle all the paperwork. And if Loki isn't given some kind of official identity, it could cause trouble. It would also mean you can't adopt him." She hesitated. "You are
Having an AI was the best.
"I stick with pepperoni. How is he doing?"
"Aye?"
"That's not so hard to figure out", Tony said and went to his son. "Does it taste good?"
, the AI said.
"Fuck... what do we do? If he finds out about Loki..."
"Maybe take a few days off?" Romanoff suggested. "Get some air, have time to think, and to relax?"
Letting go of the tablet, Tony leaned back. Surrendering himself to his husband's gentle yet intent touch. Moaning and gasping.
For a long second he was afraid he had made a horrible mistake. Then he was kissed back. The jacket fell to the floor as those strong arms held him. Again he marvelled at the gentleness of the man. Despite being so strong and big, he was careful. They moved apart a bit, looking at each other.
? And a kid? Wha..."
"In the mood, huh?"
"Call me Tony."
"He hasn't been here?"
"I do", Tony said, silently giggling over the middle name Grant.
I honestly felt like crying in frustration a few times...
"Wait. Loki as in 'I'm a god', Loki? Thor's brother?"
"I guess..." Sam's eyes were drawn to the toddler babbling at Steve. The words didn't make any sense to him and he was very confused about the relationship.
After a week in the hospital, Steve insisted on being released. Against the wishes of the doctors. Yet, while his right arm was in a sling and his ribs ached, he was almost completely healed. It was an enormous relief to return to the Avengers Tower, and to the penthouse.
The small god was having a blast with some toys he had received. Babbling away in his own language.
kid? As in, why both of you?"
"What? We got an extra?" A third woman  said, sounding frustrated. "We need to head back for lunch and the cart is too heavy without all of us."
"Yeah, well, it is not only for your sake", the brunet mumbled. "We will miss you too, you know."
"Do you want to stay for a while?" Thor asked. "I could tell you some stories if you want. Maybe about your namesake?"
Worming his way out from under the covers he used the bathroom and then returned to bed. Falling asleep once more.
"Alright, Mischief. One leg here, and one leg here", Tony pointed, hoping it would be enough. Loki looked at him and at the diaper. Then he... actually did what he had been told. Allowing the engineer to pull it up.
"Is there a reason?"
"Did you know Steve was this good?" Clint asked. "Maybe I can ask him to draw me sometime."
The Winter Soldier closed the door behind him. He had managed to find a small studio apartment where he could hide. Using money he had stolen from Hydra as he fled.
"No, that's not... it is true we dated but we got married in spring."
Whistling the engineer was in the middle of some simple programming when suddenly Pepper walked out of the elevator. On his feet in seconds Tony fumbled with his device and wasn't sure what to say.
"Er..." the engineer said.
"Normally?"
"I'm not sure, Zola flashed several events that Hydra caused but... Tony... Bucky is alive..."
They spent a few more hours in bed. Though none of them were spent sleeping.
"Sure, Lo. What do you want to eat?" The boy thought for a few seconds.
"He's our kid... of course he can come talk to us..."
"Then..." Barnes voice was hoarse. "Why did you help me?"
"Am I in trouble?" He asked in a tiny voice.
"Daddy?" Loki tugged at his shirt, game forgotten. "Ja sakna Papa..."
"At least you woke up before lunch", he said. "I was starting to think you would sleep until noon."
"Steve, you have never hurt me or made me feel anything else but pleasure. I love you."
"That we know of, Thunder Pants was literally banished to Earth a couple of years ago. You don't get banished for being a good kid."
"Papa!" The small Trickster exclaimed, unable toalright  keep quiet anymore. He started babbling excitedly about all sorts of things.
Like that, Thor was gone. Noticeable calmer Loki kept munching on his breakfast. Steve decided the boy would get pancakes the next day. To make up for things. Ruffling the black hair he kissed his son's head. Making the kid lean against him.
They both took a deep breath, they had confirmation.
Steve looked down on his hands. Thin, bony. His chest looked like it would collapse from one single punch. But his friend wasn't wrong. There were certain things that drew him to someone. Regardless of their gender. He liked people who were intelligent, capable, and self-sufficient. Not that he couldn't admire a beautiful dame or a handsome fella, but that wasn't what truly captured him. In some ways his friend, James Buchanan Barnes, fitted his criteria. Though they were more like brothers than anything else. Thankfully, the brunet knew of his deviance and accepted him anyway. Helping him keep it a secret.
He jolted awake in the dead of the night. Still drowsy. Tony blinked and wondered why he was staring at a naked, muscular chest. Then he remembered. An arm pulled him a bit closer and he tried to see Steve through the darkness. It had been a quite unexpected, who knew the soldier was interested in men. Granted, the engineer had definitely initiated the sex. Which had been really, really good. His only question was why so suddenly. There had been no indication the blond was interested.
There was a sincere expression on the man's face. What ultimately made him decide was the fact that this person knew who he was. Remembered him.
"Have you finished?" Rogers asked.
Having heard the scream Steve came running and opened the door to the workshop. The burst of cold air only stopped him for a few seconds. To his surprise he found his husband sitting on the floor, just inside.
This was Steve's? Tony paused at a drawing of himself. It was way more detailed than the ones before. Turning more pages he realised there was an abundance of drawings depicting him. From all sort of situations. Him brooding, him laughing, him dropping something, him excited. He had had no idea the soldier was watching him this much. It was rather flattering.
"Well, because he was very intelligent and well-spoken. Clever."
"If you want him to get to know you", Stark said. "You should stay for a while. Letting him come to you. But if you loses it on him again, you don't another chance. Got it?"
Thor made his way down to the common floor. There were no food on his and he needed breakfast. What he didn't expect was seeing Barton being pelted with pellets of ice. By Loki.
Loki had lost interest in the adults talking and was instead standing with Tony. The engineer had a very soft expression as he looked at their son. Listening to the babbling.
"To Loki", Barton screamed. "That bastard deserved it! You should be glad I didn't throw him off the top of the Tower!"
They had a rare chance to take their time in their own  bed. Bucky, Sam, and Rhodey had decided to take their honorary nephew out for some fun. Namely an amusement park. Neither Tony or Steve had seen any issue with that. It was more impressive that it took them twenty minutes to realise that they had the whole day to themselves. Which meant that they jumped at the chance. And each other.
This meant that they acted like nothing around the others. Cold and polite, with some banter thrown in. Yet, at every opportunity he got, the soldier would sneak up to the penthouse. Spend as much time as he could with Tony. Wishing constantly he could stay longer. JARVIS helped them, of course. Letting them know if someone was coming and all that.
be upset you reached the point where suicide seemed like the only option, but he will also want to help and support you."
Suddenly Tony sat back, his chest rising and falling on the edge of panting. "I'm sorry, I just can't stand any more emotional shit this evening."
hurting him Tony: you're hurting both of you. Steve will inevitably find out at some point and will be more hurt to find out you lied to him, than if you just told him sooner. You're also hurting yourself by keeping it from him because you will always feel that guilt of having kept something so serious and significant from someone you really care about." She paused and took a deep breath. "The truth is almost always better and this is one of those times. I know you find it difficult to comprehend it, but Steve cares about you, truly, and yes he
Tony pulled his mouth away for a moment, working up a steady rhythm with the thrust of his hips, as Steve groaned under him.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Don't be so humble, Steve." He turned to his mom. "What he means is yes, and a damn good one."
"Yeah, I'll go. And you can take me - just let me pay you gas money, sometimes, deal?"
Steve's expression was as readable as ever - a boy who wore his heart on his sleeve always. The corners of his mouth were rounded with supple amusement, but his eyes retained a hardness that told Tony that his boyfriend could just as easily see straight through him. Suddenly his throat felt like sandpaper, rubbing roughly on itself every time he swallowed.
*     *     *     *
"Yes."
." Steve's laughter joined hers and Tony's half-hearted protests soon died under the humour.
"Good. The last thing I need is you making more of a fool of yourself than you previously have. You're already a disappointment to the Stark family name; don't make it any worse." Then he turned swiftly on his heel and strode off down the hallway into the depths of the house, his hands clasped behind his back.
After getting up and digging through the mess on his floor, he found some wearable shoes and a jacket, then briefly threw together a bag in case he ended up staying overnight at Steve's. Heading to the second floor, Tony chose library-come-lounge, which had a balcony attached to it, and a sturdy trellis that snaked up the wall of the house beside it. Straddling the metal railing, it wasn't too difficult to find a foothold on the wall structure. The trellis stopped about a meter and a half above the ground, and he simply pushed off from the wall and twisting in the air, to land with only a slight stumble on the paving slabs in the stretching backyard.
. At this point, I'm probably going to have to walk - which is fine, really. It's not overly far and it might help clear my head and stuff a bit before and after." He shrugged. "Not like I've got much choice, at this point."
Just as Tony raised his fist to make his presence known a second time, a wooden voice range out from within the room. "Enter." As he pushed open the door gently, he wondered whether or not there had actually been impatience in that tone, or if it was just his imagination.
Steve laughed breathlessly. "I've got tissues." He raked the fingers of his clean hand through his hair and looked at the boy on his lap. "I love you."
Now he was older, it wasn't exactly like he was afraid, there was just a feeling - a
"Thank you for coming this evening. I'm sorry I fucked it up."
The quietness of usually one of the most boisterous members of the group (after Tony himself), was beginning to unnerve the dark haired teen.
His dad just nodded and gestured at him dismissively, his attention already back on his paperwork. Leaving the room, Tony found he didn't feel entirely disappointed; maybe it was the fact his father had openly acknowledge his son was truly not just in a 'phase' and had actually used the word 'boyfriend'. Admittedly, it was frustrating he likely wouldn't be there for dinner, but maybe that wasn't such a bad thing.
By about the third week, Tony had become accustomed to the routine of the group. Steve dropped him off as usual, his soft-lipped kiss a sure promise of pleasure later. As the dark haired teenager entered the Youth Centre, he noted a few unfamiliar faces already lingering inside the meeting room, most of them sitting on chairs. It was always easier to pick out the newbies like that; their parents dropped them early to talk to Holly the Social Worker and their lack of familiarity with anyone often led them to sitting with rigid anxiety in the uncomfortable plastic chairs organised in a circle in the centre of the room. Those who had been before usually chose to stand and socialise bitterly, plastic cups of watery juice or half-stale biscuits from the refreshments table clasped in their pale fingers.
"What conditions?"
Pointing towards the table the boy whined.
Steve and Tony exchanged a quick look. Barton let out a happy whoop, only to be smacked by Romanoff. Banner had a complicated expression on his face.
Thor looked confused while thinking hard. Then he seemed to realise what the engineer was referring to, making an aghast face.
"Why didn't you tell us?" Banner asked.
"Will there ever be a time when you can quit?"
"Like I can go do something else while we are analysing a mysterious chemical that someone tried to steal."
Muttering about useless AI Tony once again tried to calm the tiny god. Still no use. Thankfully Steve returned just then. The soldier paused at the scene.
"Good night, love."
The Thunderer frowned again but then slumped. "I see... for whatever reason, Loki has been given a second chance at life. If he is happy here, I won't interfere."
"You two are ridiculous", his friend said shaking his head. Eating some cereal. Then stopping. Frowning. "Stark? Like Howard Stark?"
The cupboard? Why would he try to... Oh! Right. That was where they had put the cookies and the candy. So Loki had tried to get them on his own instead of asking. Granted, it was before lunch so it would have been a no.
"Yes."
"Let's hurry, then." And hurry they did. The moment they made it through the door to the room, they were all over each other. Kissing, touching, trying to take off their clothes while moving closer to the bed. They stumbled a few times, making them laugh and giggle.
"Okay..." Bucky sat down, eyeing them. "Can someone explain why this kid is calling you Papa and Daddy? For that matter, where did he come from?"
"Loki woke us up several times", his best friend explained. "Wanting us to come with him and stay with him as he fell asleep."
"Then finish it", Steve said. "I'm with you until the end of the line."
Currently the tiny god of mischief was parked on Tony's lap, munching on a big helping of pasta from the in-house cafeteria. As always, he had pretty good manners. Considering his age.
"Mmm", the tiny god of mischief whined. Hiding his face in the engineer's shoulder.
"Wait... did he actually say something?" Bruce said, staring at the god.
They were sweaty, out of breath, and very satisfied. Still a tangle of limbs Steve couldn't stop himself from kissing Tony anywhere he could. It had been so long. His husband giggled when he brushed over a certain spot.
"Huh? Oh. Nah, that's just a hickey."
"I'm good", the soldier said and tousled the boy's hair. "Better clean things up here."
"I'm actually descendant of Irish immigrants. My dad spoke Irish."
He remembered the fateful day at the Bifrost. Loki's expression of anger, fear, and despair. Would learning you were adopted cause such devastation if you had been happy? It was quite possible. But if you were already miserable, it probably didn't help.
She regarded this answer, nodding slowly, as if she felt he did know, but just wasn't ready to discuss it yet. Maybe he wasn't. But then again, maybe he just didn't
Maria's face crumpled into an expression of regret, tactfully ignoring Tony's swearing. "I know. I'm sorry on his behalf, and I know that doesn't excuse his behaviour at all, but you and I both know how he is when it comes to apologies." Her face contorted then, and her eyes hardened, the dark pencilled brows drawing in low over them. "I plan on having a good discussion with him about this later." Taking a swallow from her drink, the muscles in her expression relaxed and she gestured toward the door with her drink hand. "Why don't you two go out and cool off a bit; take a walk; I'll clean up the kitchen."
Sometimes, Tony wished he'd been born into a family like Steve's and not rigid upper class environment of his own.
It was funny, how sometimes there were things in life that you knew you should be used to, and yet, every time they make an appearance, you find yourself reacting as if it's the first time, again. Curled on his side atop the quilted sheets of his king size bed, Tony stared listlessly at his dully glowing phone screen, waiting for a reply. From behind him, the ambiance of his parent's arguing echoed up from the depths of the house, like endless screaming wearing a throat red-raw. It really wasn't all that uncommon for them to argue, and it was almost always centred around him, yet, every time, he felt like he was a child again - maybe 7 or 8 - when they'd burst into shouts of rage, like bellowing cattle.
Then he turned and looked over his shoulder at them. "You know, the television in the living room is pretty damn good for watching films on - the surround sound system is all plugged in now." Letting go of the wooden frame, he exited fully, shutting the door behind him gently.
"I- " Tony took a breath. "I just wanted to say, that, I'm bi."
He hadn't noticed he was forgetting things at first; it seemed normal to have to be reminded repeatedly about letting the dogs out, having to check every day what the date was because he couldn't remember what it was the day before, setting his dinner plate down on his desk and then seeing and remembering it almost two hours later, by which time everything was congealed and cold. But when he suddenly realised he couldn't remember what he'd done that morning, if he'd had breakfast or taken his daily vitamin, let alone what he'd done in the last two or so days, that's when it started to get unnerving.
"But you
The weighted blanket invaded his nose, his throat, his lungs with every inhale. He was suffocating in a room filled with air.
"Yeah, man. Just thinkin' about how we can have such equally shithead parents and yet live such different lives." He had stopped to stand beside Tony just inside the doorway to the games room, while Steve began to set up one of the consoles and James looted the snackbar.
"Well," he said, "that was a fucking first."
Clint stayed oddly silent throughout the conversation and remained the same as they climbed the stairs and unloaded into the games room on the second floor. The room was lengthy and comfortable, with deep blue walls and a polished wooden floor, covered in places with soft grey rugs. There was a minibar-style setup in one corner of the room, which was regularly restocked with snacks, soft drinks and alcohol. Off to one side of the room was a large flatscreen TV, fixed to the wall and wired-up to numerous gaming consoles, opposite a wide plushy leather sofa, scattered with comfortably squishy cushions and boxed in by bean bags. The centre of the room was taken up by a vivid green pool table and an oak card table, squatted next to floor to ceiling bookshelf, stuffed achingly full with books and all manner of board games.
dad."
Tony hesitated. "..Yes."
." Steve's groan matched his own, the head of his cock straining against his thin boxers.
"-wait!" Tony blurted after Jarvis as he turned to exit the room. Both adults jerked their heads in his direction. "I- I wanted to say something. Something important." His voice trailed off at the end.
can introduce himself."
The therapist sitting in the chair across from him in the comfortably cluttered Mental Health centre office was watching him with a soothing gaze. When he started seeing her weekly after his attempt, he'd been very glad to find she wasn't one of the pushy pity-ers, who make you talk about your shit before you're ready, all the while staring at you with wide wet eyes, like a whining puppy.
"So you'll go?" Steve's chest vibrated comfortingly beneath his ear as he spoke.
Tony snorted as he clipped his seatbelt in and adjusted the strap against his chest, listening to the jovially playful conversation bubbling up behind him in the backseat, as Clint and James wrestled against the stiff belt retractors. Clint laughed at his boyfriend and Tony suddenly thought about how far the blonde had come since their first acquainting; his shoulders were slumped, relaxed, and the sleeves of his well-worn studded leather jacket were pushed up to his elbows, airing his scar-ridden forearms without a second thought. Seeing the other boy on his good days made Tony's chest swell weirdly, almost like he was proud of his friend. It also reminded him of himself, and how far he had come, even if he hadn't really noticed it.
"I don't know." Tony hesitated as his father trickled into his mind. How would his dad react if he found out his son was having
The therapist was still watching him with her guarded gaze - that was the one thing he didn't like about her. His inability to read her. Though, he supposed, an overly open and readable therapist might not be something you wanted. Being good at reading those around him had been a skill he'd picked up not long after he'd become more aware of his father's increasing difficult-to-please attitude.
Maria sighed heavily, her body shuddering with the intensity of it. "I don't
"Why?" She barely gave him time to inhale before another question was being shoved down his throat.
"Had you been saving them for a while?"
"Yeah. I still had some zoloft left over from before they switched me and I stopped taking my paxil."
"Taxi?" Tony teased as he got in, throwing his bag into the backseat. Leaning over, he kissed the well-muscled blonde in the driver's seat, both out of affection and to ground himself before he began to bump against the roof of the car like a half-soft helium balloon.
"I feel guilty for hurting my mom. She already goes through enough on a daily basis from dealing with my dad. She didn't deserve to have more shit from me, piled on top of that. She keeps getting all teary when she sees me, and checking in on me all the time, like it's her responsibility to make sure I'm okay all the time, and like if she doesn't check, I'll feel shit again and it'll be her fault."
"Jarvis? What is this?" He asked holding out a blue box.
"Come on, you too!" He gave her a surprised and confused look. She huffed and waved her hand. "Come on now, time to go." Still not understanding what was happening the boy found himself herded alongside several other children. Away from the playground. Looking around he tried to see his parents but the adults just ushered him forward when he did that.
"Papa! Daddy!" The tears this time was obviously more out of relief and a release of tension. One thing was clear though. They needed to set very strong boundaries with the others. Especially the spies and Thor.
Loki gave a big, dramatic, sigh. "Okay..."
Smiling Steve just kissed Tony again, making his husband quite weak in the knees. They were interrupted by a happy squeal from their son.
"Bet he liked that", Tony laughed and looked at his son. The tiny god was stuffing his face with pizza. Making a mess of himself. But he was clearly having a good time and enjoyed the food.
"No, that doesn't explain anything. Why is he
"Tant Pepper!" The boy replied enthusiastically and went with the strawberry blonde woman without any fuss.
"...I will get him something later then..."
"We don't actually know. Steve found him like this."
"I intend to visit my mortal comrades. Stay for a little while", he said.
Not stopping to think Steve took off his jacket and wrapped it around the child as he lifted him into his arms. The boy was cold and settled without any fuss. For a second the blond thought about the police and the issue of just bringing the child with him. Then he considered the state of who he was almost certain was Loki. The Tower it was.
"Love you tons, Daddy!" Was the very enthusiastic answer he got. "Love you tons, Papa!"
"Yeah..." her brother said. "But he is Hawkeye, an Avenger. Can't be helped."
Loki had been having a blast playing with the equipment and the other kids. There had been a bunch of them, over seen by a small group of adults. Suddenly the other children had been rounded up. The tiny god had just kept playing when one adult, a woman, spoke to him.
A hangover... other substances could give a similar reaction but he doubted those would work on Steve. Most drugs and poisons had no affect on him.
"Are you trying to torture me? Just... come..." Tony panted in a half moan.
"Nothing of note. They are just living their lives."
"What are you doing?"
Big, green eyes stared at him in wonder. "Papa och Daddy är superhjältar!" Loki threw his arms around Steve in an enthusiastic hug, giggling. Returning the hug he was relieved to see that his son was in a better mood.
"I love you, Tony", the blond murmured. "Thank you, for being with me, for marrying me."
With two days left Steve had no choice but to pack. It was hard. During the past year his life had changed so much but in good ways. Packing felt like ripping away that happiness piece by piece. He had tried to spend as much time as possible with his small family. Playing with Loki, reading bedtime stories, and making the tiny Trickster's favourite foods. Being with Tony, both in and outside the bed. Both with clothes on, and with clothes off.
"No..."
"Nah. It is better like this. Besides, I have you, and I wouldn't trade you for anything." The soldier looked stunned for a few seconds, then he pulled the engineer into a one-armed hug and a rough kiss. Loki giggled at them, not understanding what they were talking about but seeing them being happy. Tony smiled at the kid. "Wouldn't trade you either, Mischief. Not for anything."
"You decide", his husband said, tussling his hair. "I'm fine with whatever you want."
"Very funny. I don't regret either of them. Wouldn't surprise me if Pepper is already on it. She is good at this kind of stuff."
The engineer felt a block of ice in his stomach. So, no accident. Murder. Taking a deep breath he looked at his husband. At the injuries. There wasn't many who could cause that much damage to a super soldier.
"The other slip-on... Pepper... I didn't know you were coming..."
Smiling to himself, Steve watched the engineer disappear down a flight of stairs. Outside, the city was slowly starting to rebuild. A lot of people had died in the invasion and the destruction was overwhelming. As a result, crime rates had rising dramatically and would-be villains was running rampant. The public had cried for help while law enforcement was either overwhelmed or powerless. Thus the Avengers staying in the Tower while helping out when needed.
About ten minutes later the engineer joined him. Looking at the floorboards while frowning. "And here I was hoping it was innuendo or a veiled invitation. Like, 'there is something wrong with my floor because your shirt isn't on it', or something", he said. "This is less fun. Alright, scan it for me Jarv."
"I'm so sorry, mr. Stark", the would-be babysitter said. "I tried to keep him inside the room but he slipped out from under me."
"That's... I wasn't sure if it was proper..."
That wasn't just being familiar, they seemed to unconsciously understand the words of the small Trickster. A mystery. Just like it was a mystery why Loki was a child at all. Especially since he, according to Thor, was supposed to be dead. Yet, here he was. The examination had confirmed that he was very much just a child right now.
No... calm... no need to go nuclear. Leaning against the wall the engineer tried to still his thoughts. His son had never been in danger, JARVIS was always...
The Thunderer paused. He had been given a chance to be in Loki's life again. Stark and Rogers had trusted him and the other two to look after a child they treasured. Yet, what had he done? Screamed at the boy, being so forceful that he caused a meltdown. Making the child cry and wail in misery. Because he couldn't listen.
"Aragorn?"
"I love you, Tony. I love you, so much."
A twenty minutes drive later they were at the courthouse. Thanks to Pepper, they drew no attention as they entered. Loki and Happy would be at a nearby park. The officiater was a dry, older gentleman who could clearly care less about who they were.
Pepper roped in Rhodey to help her babysit Loki this time. They were joined by Steve's new friend. She had definitely learned the hard way that a small Trickster was still a trickster.
"You two are adorable", Tony laughed. "Better make him something more substantial for lunch. This will not last him long."
That... that was quite the proclamation. Usually it was the other way around. He was embraced and held gently. Melting into it, Tony started to feel hope again. Maybe this time, he wouldn't mess things up. And he kind of wanted to keep it between them for now. Just so he could have the soldier for himself with no interference.
"And anyone who tries to take him from us will be blasted into space", Tony said. "At least."
"Compared to Natasha needling me for details? I take genuine concern any day."
"Trust me, it is better to tell her straight up. An angry Pepper is a scary Pepper."
"But I'm hungry! I want food!"
They watched the duo play. It mostly looked like rough housing. With the adult letting the child win. Especially when Loki got on the man's back and had him galloping through the penthouse.
"Your reaction while Thor was telling us what happened. Your questions", the redhead said. "You took it personally. It was also the fact that you exchanged a look when Thor told us Loki is dead. Meaning that the boy over there, is Loki."
"I've seen some in stores, actually", the scientist said. "Apparently they fly of the shelves even more than the Avengers merchandise does.
"Answer me honestly, do you think he would have done so willingly and by choice?"
"What's up, kiddo!" Wilson said, exchanging a high five.
"Hey!"
"But you defend it. You are defending your dad who caused this in the first place. Your mom, who from the sound of it, turned a blind eye to her own son's suffering. So, yeah. I hate Asgard!"
"Papa, det är sköld! Som kapten America!"
"Do you really think you could have the patience to teach? Loki likes to learn but he is still a child. He can get distracted and become bored." The soldier said.
Food was good. Combined breakfast and lunch into a nice brunch Tony was back in his living room. Pondering. So, the drug hadn't affected consent but it had definitely affected judgement. Because of that, he wanted to see what could happen without it.
"You guys are too sweet for me right now", Bucky said. "I think I will head out for my breakfast."
He looked up at Bucky. Project Insight had been averted. His husband and son would be safe.
"Thor, you need to calm down."
"Doesn't surprise me. He likes learning so we figured we might as well encourage him."
Heart stinging from the rejection the god of thunder still greeted them. "Friends, it has been a while. Loki..."
"Sorry..."
"I wasn't a virgin. But it
"Papa! Daddy!" Loki cried, getting off his chair and running to Steve and Tony who had just gotten home.
"Hey, there", pen lady said and crouched infront of the small Trickster. "If you go in that direction, you will be back at the playground. Okay? Just straight down that way."
Tony took up working in his workshop a couple of hours five days a week, usually timing it with Loki's nap. Upping security, placing extra protection, better firewalls. The whole thing. He also worked on his suit, improving the technology and making it more versatile. Anything for Stark Industries was just blueprints and those he could make while spending time with his son.
"But..."
"One at the time, please", the billionaire said. "You with the blue shirt."
"Well, Zeus, it just so happen that men
"I love you too, Steve. I love you too."
The Captain and Stark relaxed, hugged the boy, and with tears in their eyes they spoke.
an disembodied voice said. Freaking him out.
"If you could see me now, Bucky", he sighed. "You would laugh your head off, wouldn't you. Saying that I'm same old Steve who rather yearn in silence instead of making a leap."
There was a tense silence in his wake. So tense that everyone jumped when the elevator pinged. Out came Loki, clutching his blankie while crying.
"Because it lower inhibitions from what I can tell. Depending on how it is used, it can cause a lot of problems."
"But he didn't kill you", Tony said. "You are here, alive. And once you are better, you can come home. To me and Loki. Then, when you have healed completely, we can look for Barnes."
"Let's find out how he is doing in morning, shall we?" His husband said.
"...Tony, that your son is absolutely adorable. I didn't know you have a biological child."
Then he remembered what his brother had said.
"Hey", Steve's gentle voice sounded. "Are you okay? I saw Pepper leave in a huff and then you didn't come up..."
Chuckling, Pepper figured life like this wasn't so bad either.
Steve used the lube he found to work his husband open while using his mouth at the same time. Never letting it go over the edge.
"Come on, Aragorn", Tony said. "Let's eat."
"If I ever hear about you doing something like that again Clinton Francis Barton you will sleep in the barn for a year!" Laura Barton growled and smashed her husband with the remnants of the newspaper one last time.
"Who is Loki?"
"Hmm..."
Everything would be easier if the pirate didn't keep so many darn secrets.
"If you want to stay, don't speak like that", maybe-aunt Natasha said. Hitting the mean man.
"I'm going to assume he said thank you", Banner laughed. "Is that..." he nodded towards Bucky.
"It is more than okay", the blond said. His demeanour... changed. Something very... soft... came over him. "I have never been so happy consistently. I'm married to the man I love and we are raising our son. It is more than I ever expected out of life. Is there a reason for your question?"
"Apparently he gets most of the toys from miss Potts or the Colonel", the Captain's friend said. "They are kind of competing for being the favourite uncle slash aunt."
*     *     *     *
The lowercase had started as a little tease to annoy Steve (ever a member of the grammar police). But at this point, it was just second nature. It was kind of a tell-tale sign, he supposed, that he was doing well enough to function - that he could keep up the lighthearted-ness of the inside joke.
An impenetrable silence settled over the room, like a wet weighted blanket.
"Why do you think that is?"
Warmth unfurled in his chest, like a blooming flower bud, extending its tendrils out into his stomach and creeping down his limbs to his lightly trembling fingers. A part of him hated how one person had so much control over him, but another part of him loved it - loved the burning affection and the feel of sculpted muscles under endless expanses of tanned skin; the tang of sweat and sweetened coffee against his lips and the aching pleasure of hormonal bodies rocking together in fluid motion. The fear of vulnerability had scalded his heart, but the fervour of love was nurturing.
"I don't feel guilty because of him, if that's what you mean." He was deliberately skirting around the question and both of them knew it. "I regret it, I guess, but I don't feel guilty."
The Social Worker sighed softly. "Let's just carry on, shall we? And then I'll go deal with things when we take our first little break."
"I'll be nice and let you think you're the dominant one, shall I?" The blonde teased, his voice hoarse with arousal.
*     *     *     *
A grin flashed across Tony's face and he cupped his boyfriend's face to draw his own forward to meet it. It didn't take long for a sweltering heat to bloom in the pit of Tony's stomach, pooling downwards to his groin and making him unconsciously rock his hips forward, pressing his body flush against Steve's. With a soft grunt, Steve parted his lips and his tongue darted out to melt into his boyfriend's mouth.  Tony angled his head to the side and drove their lips together more firmly, allowing their slick tongues to slide over each other in a way that made his cock's want for friction burn into a craving.
This is not what I needed today."
"And you've been intimate together."
"Yeah," Tony replied, "just wondering how two such different people can have so much to talk about." From where she was pulling plates out of the cupboard, Maria laughed.
In retaliation, Steve forcefully pulled Tony's boxer's down as far as they would go, allowing his hardened cock to spring free. He opted with just Tony's pre-cum and wrapped his long lean fingers around his cock, picking up a sharp and heady rhythm. Taking this as his cue to do the same, Tony sped up his own strokes and they quickly fell into sync. Steve's other hand was still braced against his back, holding their curled forms together as their kiss-bruised lips locked again. Their heads twisted as their eyes fell half shut arousal drunk. Tongues slid saliva slick over teeth and each other. Their moans were like music to their ears, singing their love and pleasure. The heat in Tony's stomach had roared up his entirety and was beginning to build behind his eyes as his orgasm loomed.
"Your mom seems real nice." Steve had dropped his voice to a quiet murmur, despite the fact they were far away across the kitchen enough that Maria wouldn't be able to hear them.
The girl's smile seemed to stretch her already contorted skin even tighter over the sharp points of her facial bones. "Hi, I'm Jane. I'm here because I have anorexia nervosa." She turned her head and looked at the guy to her left. Tony let himself slump down a little in his seat, quietly wishing he'd gotten more sleep the night before. He squeezed his fingertips into his numbly throbbing temples and exhaled softly.
His attention finally dropped from his homework-search and he narrowed his eyes at her. "
Maria smiled warmly at him. "I'm glad you're enjoying it. Are you much of a cook yourself?"
"Shut up. You're enjoying it."
"Alright, alright. There's not much space in here; we should probably actually stop for a moment if the jeans are coming off."
"Yes."
Steve shrugged casually. "Sure, I could go for another."
"And you care about him, as he does you."
Steve was apparently having the same thought as his hands shifted lower onto the dark haired teen's ass. He pulled Tony up against himself, grinding their crotches together, and even through the double layers of denim jeans and cloth boxers, pleasure shot in rivets up through his nerves like liquid gold. A breathless moan slipped from a pair of lips; in the moment, it was hard to tell who it belonged to. Letting go of his boyfriend's head, Tony braced himself against the car's interior - one hand against the refreshingly cool glass of the window, the other grasping the firm thickness of the leather backseat. Using the two points as leverage, he ground his hips forward and down against the swollen heat that was Steve's cock, pulling his jeans uncomfortably taut.
He was only three steps out of the dinning room, when the slam of the front door echoed out through the house. Within an instant, all of the icy power that had been swelling like an abscess suddenly seemed to burst and drain out through his feet into the floor, leaving his limbs like lead and his eyes itchy and burning. Tony refused to acknowledge the tears burning into the shadowed skin beneath his eyes as he stared uselessly at the inside of the front door.
"Jag tvätta händerna, Papa", he said. Most of it was incomprehensible to the former soldier but he recognised one word. And stared as the boy ran up to Steve, showing his hands.
"Goodnight, Buddy", Steve said and gave the boy a kiss on his forehead.
"Hm?"
"I'm sorry I didn't come to you."
"So cold, Brucie Bear."
Most didn't. But what about a drug developed by SHIELD?
"Do you think Thor knows anything about this?"
"Love you too, buddy. Love you too", Steve said. A very soft expression on his face.
"They love him", Bruce said calmly. "Steve and Tony, they love him. Think of him as their son. If you had a child you loved a lot, how would you react if someone destroyed their things to punish them. Or threaten to throw them off the Tower?"
"Sounds like a plan", Sam said.
"Likewise, if there is a call for the rest of the Avengers, be careful."
"We kind of got into the habit..." Tony muttered. "He would sleep better here and..."
speaking English right now?"
"Loki? As in the invader? Why is he a baby?" Pepper said.
"With JARVIS around there is no real reason to worry. And despite his mischief, he is a very well-behaved child." The soldier had a soft smile, taking it in strides.
"Natasha lives under me, will she be able to stay on her floor?"
Return to childhood. A second chance.
of them."
"It is about my brother. Loki is... dead..."
"Yelling doesn't help either", Barnes said. "You just got angry with him."
"Det är frukost nu. Alla måste äta frukost."
"Suit yourself."
"That's the thing, we don't know anything about this guy. He could potentially cause trouble or put himself in danger or something."
Deciding it was better to wash the boy before giving him a bath Steve placed him in the bathtub. Using the detachable shower head to gently rinse away the worst. He had noticed that the child was light and it was obvious the boy was a bit underweight for his age.
"He's handsome", the taller boy said teasingly. "What's his name?"
"JARVIS?"
"Loki! Stop this and just eat!"
"I have told you my news. I now need to return to Asgard. Hopefully we will meet again soon." With that, the Thunderer turned dramatically and left.
Steve looked at the order in his hands. Fury was on a screen and Natasha was leaning against the door frame. There was no way he could explain his reluctance without giving away too much. While the red-haired woman seemed at least sympathetic, the SHIELD director had none. Glowering the black man crossed his arms.
Reaching the bedroom Tony was half prepared to be thrown down on the mattress. Instead he was lowered gently with a kiss and was then undressed like he was something precious. A quick rummaging through the nightstand produced a bottle of lube and some condoms. Apparently the blond had been reading up. Prompting the engineer to place a pillow under his hips.
"I asked him about meeting you, Captain. He said he doesn't remember how he got there. Just that he was in a place with grass and trees. Walking around. For a few days from what I gathered. When he saw you, something told him you were safe and decided to approach you."
"Whatever. He and Cap have lost their marbles! This is Loki we are talking about. The invader of New York! The Prince of Lies. He is obviously lying, pretending, to garner their... I don't know, anything."
"Well met, Sam son of Wil."
"Well, duh. Have you seen my hubby?"
"JARVIS?"
"Barbarian?!"
"Or just stupid ones", Romanoff said. "You tried to skip training again. Come on."
"Tony! Over here!" The blond shouted and a second man came running. This one was shorter, hand brown hair and a goatee. Panting he ruffled the hair of the boy in his father's arms.
"Because you are important to Steve. And I can recognise that you didn't act by choice. Which is more than I can say. A lot of people are dead because of weapons I created. It took coming face to face with death for me to change. Besides, most of us in the Avengers got a second chance. Why not you."
Steve looked unhappy and pulled Tony in for a hug. "That would make you sound like a horrible person..." he said. "They would think badly of you..."
Loki started crying loudly. And his magic responded to his distress.
"You did what?" She said in a dangerous voice.
"It is true that this is Loki, but according to JARVIS' analysis he is definitely not older than three years old."
Bruce looked at the book again. Every single problem had been solved. It was hard to say if the kid was a genius or if he retained knowledge from when he was an adult. None of them knew why the Trickster had become a child again. Thor was supposed to look into it but he hadn't been back since then.
Tony blanked for a few seconds before he was on his feet. Looking over the information presented to him. The probable location was in Europe, Romania.
"He was upset for quite a while but calmed down when I showed him the shield. I also told him we are Captain America and Iron Man."
"Thanks."
A group of three men were sitting in the penthouse, watching a single child. If it wasn't for the fact that the child was Loki, Thor would have thought it overkill. Stark and Rogers had recruited them for babysitting as they would spend the night away. The small Trickster was playing with his toys. Something he had an abundance off.
"Just talking to myself..." the archer nodded in understanding.
The first problem he encountered was that he was just way too short. That was solved by moving a chair and climbing it. Next problem came when he opened the cabinets. There were boxes and containers but he had no idea what they contained. Aunt Pepper had been teaching him but he still couldn't read on his own.
"Thank you, Jarvis." Papa had taught him to always be polite.
"Steve... Steve... ha... ah!"
"Don't be too freaked out", the engineer said dryly. "So far it is only a few words here and there. We think his All-Speak is becoming more complex as he grows."
"I'm sorry."
Just like he had hoped, Central Park was fairly empty and he could run uninterrupted. After an hour or so he paused at a drinking fountain to cool down a bit. He had just splashed his face with water when he felt something pull on his pants. Steve looked down.
"The whole floor needs to be remodelled and probably removed. At least for a while. It going to take quite some time due to extent of the damage."
Kissing him back the soldier went to clean up the tiny god of mischief while Tony unpacked the elevator. It was a decent amount of things. Most of the furniture was from IKEA. He already had a single bed that should be suitable after some adjustments.
"Do you want to shoot a few more hail bullets?" The engineer asked the Trickster who glowered, holding out one hand.
"Maybe we can find an opportunity to ask Thor before then?"
"It's ambitious, why so suddenly?"
He could care less that apparently he and Steve would live for many centuries to come. Welcomed it, even. But hearing how utterly miserable adult Loki had been, how horribly he had been treated. That made his blood boil. Their son could have been happy and carefree in his first chance at life, if just someone had cared enough to give him that. Instead, he had been treated so poorly, feeling so shitty, that a supposed impossible spell had worked.
"Not your fault, babe. Not your fault."
Frustrated and angry, Thor watched his brother run to his shield brothers. Still crying and wailing. Stark sat down on one knee and let the child hide in his arms. Rubbing his back and speaking soothingly to him. Once the boy was calmer Rogers picked him up and they walked over to the men.
The call came one day just before noon. Someone had stolen classified chemicals and was driving like a mad man down the main street. Because the potentially dangerous material, the Avengers were called out to handle it. Steve dodged the rolling canisters. A few moments earlier Hulk had smashed into the get away car, making it stop abruptly enough to send the goods flying. Two men had stumbled out from the back, the driver was hopefully only unconscious for now.
"Yes! Fine! Just no more ice! Those hurts!" The archer was rubbing certain parts of his body.
"Well... it was far less coherent, I give you that. But it is the gist of it. He has no idea who I am, either", Thor looked at the two. "However, he did refer to the two of you as his fathers. Both of you."
"I know. It is just... a feeling."
"Couldn't have done it without you. What's our ETA on New York?"
Yawning Steve went to make himself some breakfast. He didn't use his kitchen all that often, preferring to eat with others around him. But last evening he had spent quite some time in the penthouse. Making him a bit sleepy this morning. His boyfriend had also decided to give him a hickey. Granted, it was well hidden but he still felt conscious about it.
"Steven Grant Rogers", the droning continued, "do you take Anthony Edward Stark to be your legally wedded husband?"
"Seems like a diaper change is in order", his boyfriend said. "And then maybe it is time for a snack."
Biting his lips the scientist knew it wasn't any of his business but at the same time, they were his friends. "If you don't mind me asking... how is your marriage? Is everything okay?"
While his husband went berserk on Barton Steve was left dealing with the upset god of mischief. Loki just kept crying and wouldn't calm down. Not even enough to eat lunch. So, he decided to try something different. Showing his son his shield. The tiny Trickster immediately recognised it.
The boy was azure blue, looking unhappy and angry while throwing small pebbles of frozen water at the archer. More surprising was the fact that no one was trying to help the man.
When they arrived back home, they managed to convince Bucky to lay down on the bed. There, Steve watched as Tony used some sort of magnets. Called it electromagnetic therapy. It knocked his oldest friend out, throwing him into a deep sleep.
"The heck?" Bird Brain said. "You started dating and then broke up, all without telling us?"
"Hey, buddy", Steve said soothingly while rubbing the small back. "What's wrong?"
"Hm? Yeah, just feel like I'm having a hangover. Which is odd since I don't get drunk anymore."
"Speaking off", the engineer said. "Did you find anything about how this happened in the first place?"
The engineer snorted wetly. "Yeah, that's a doozy, for sure. But I don't have any issue with that. It means I get that much more time with you and Loki."
So, potty training solved.
Of course, she had no idea. But if anything, it was going to be torture.
"Sounds like he will be safe and sound then. That's nice. I hope they have fun."
"What happened?" Natasha asked.
As it turned out, Nat had noticed discolouration of her ceiling and had intended to bring it up. When offered Thor's floor she agreed immediately.
Rubbing his head the soldier was finding it hard to focus. He suspected he had not been sleeping enough. Certain dreams about a certain someone had been rather... intrusive. Maybe he should lie down a bit. Take a nap.
"Maybe? I don't know. All I know is that all Avengers available are needed."
"Oh, good. Okay, so I was thinking, better safe than sorry, right? Which is why I think we should take just a teeny tiny amount of blood and test it. Just to make sure." He said fiddling with a kit.
Bucky thought back on the day before, things started to get a bit clearer. His mind was his own, for now. Before he could say anything else though, the small child returned.
He was being berated. Again. Stifling a groan Tony didn't know if he should listen to Pepper or ignore her. Either was likely to cause an explosion. After the whole AIM fiasco he had thought they were good. He had the surgery, survived, and no more arc reactor in his chest. And he was no longer spending days without sleep making more and more armours. Just tinkering with the one he got while making a couple of back-ups. Just in case.
"Loki refused his breakfast", the Thunderer said gruffly. Looking at the bowl the mortal winced.
"I said calm down. We have known it is Loki from the beginning, this isn't a trick."
In other words, a chatt was in order. The engineer convinced his husband to take their son to the park. Spending some time just the two of them. So, the next sunny day, he waved them off and wished them a great day. A couple of hours later, Barnes shuffled out. Looking confused at the lack of lunch.
He snatched the boy, ignoring the icy feeling, and backed away. But not before the kid had already managed to touch the device. Stumbling backwards Tony collapsed against the door. Looking over the tiny hands. They didn't look damaged. Rather...
"Oh... Still, just to be sure. I'm talking pricking his finger and a drop of blood. Then have JARVIS compare it to the data we have of adult Loki."
"Yep", Tony laughed. "He really knocked me off my feet and made me an honest man."
Pepper felt her jaw slacken. Since when could the god speak English.
"Whatever... Stark will probably throw me out anyway..."
"Daddy do numbers. I wanna be like Daddy. Aunt Pepper is showing me letters and Papa reads with me."
"You can't treat them the same", Rogers said. Still with the god of mischief in his lap. "We don't know why Loki is now a child, but he is. And as Tony said, this is our son. We decide what is best for him. If you can't have patience with him or show him care, then we can't have you around."
"There were vendors around so it wasn't a problem."
"A feeling..." Tony sighed. "Just give him a bath first and we can sort this out later. He stinks."
"Hey, Jarv? Why didn't you tell me Bird Brain was in the penthouse and interacting with Loki?"
"Mother", he greeted her. Frigga was dressed in the black of mourning even now, looking drained.
"Clint!"
"It is on the house", the bartender said. "You two just oozes love and it is adorable. So this is a freebie for the cute couple."
"Where are you? Who are you?" He shouted.
"Has this something to do with SHIELD's fall?"
"Do you have any idea how you are supposed to move it?"
Loki had heard a few such stories already. He didn't like them. For some reason they were told as if they were about some great accomplishment but he thought they just sounded sad.
"Of course not", the soldier said, gently petting the black hair. "You didn't mean to cause it to snow."
"No... I'm... I'm... nothing special... did you... you looked through it?"
"They are both out", maybe-aunt Natasha said. "Barnes is seeing a therapist and Banner is meeting a friend."
"You could have just have said he was trying to climb the counter..." Tony patted the small back and held the boy gently. Eventually the tears died down into sniffles. "Now you know better, no climbing the counters."
I, of course, am happy about being appreciated. But it can be a bit of a mental load to write so much. That's actually why I sometimes skip days when I update. I write these stories and upload as I go. When I'm too drained, I can't think enough to write more.
"Let's go calm him down first", Steve said to his husband. "Sounds like he might be upset."
"To some SHIELD facility." Because of course it was SHIELD. They were sometimes way too shady. "Keep up the good work, doc."
"I could do a medical check-up on him if you want", the scientist offered. "I got some experience and it couldn't harm him, right?"
"Indeed, I speak All-Speak. I can switch to Asgardian though, which is separate."
"Didn't take you for a pineapple on pizza kind of guy", he quipped to his husband. The soldier laughed and kissed him as he sat down.
After tidying up Loki's chambers Thor had just sat down. There had been a sense of despair in how things were flung about. Pain. His brother's days as king of Asgard. Struggling to keep everything together. Though he had lied to the Thunderer, had it really been malicious? Or had it been fear?
"Daddy", the boy said and held out his arms. Clearly wanting to be picked up.
"...maybe it isn't so bad?"
"No families or new relationships or something like that?"
"You are indulging his behaviour?" Thor asked, incredulous. "He was throwing a tantrum just now, refusing to eat."
"Because he is", Steve said, crossing his arms. "Loki is our son, and if you try to do anything to him..."
"Your intentions are good, I think, there is just one problem."
"I want you to be happy, Tony. And it is obvious you are happy with Steve. If my help means you can stay happy, then it is worth it."
"With or without your suit, you are still invaluable. How many times have we won thanks to you figuring out a weakness? Countless!" The little frown deepened.
"Hey, everyone!" Tony said in that false giddy voice he sometimes used. "Meet Bird Brain's
"That's good."
Phew, that was one worry less.
"You want to go with Auntie Pepper, Lo?"
"Do you really think he needs diapers?"
Which was why he was rather surprised when the door opened and it wasn't a nurse or a doctor. He knew who it was, of course. Tony Stark was wearing a black suit jacket over an AC/DC shirt and a pair of skin tight jeans. In his arms, he was holding a small boy. The child was placed on the floor and ran towards the bedridden soldier. Carefully patting him.
"Am I that interesting to touch?"
They stood like that for a good while, just being together.
"What the fuck is going on?" He said, making both men wince. "What?"
"Jackass", Tony laughed. "Another time. I kind of like this. Just being."
them to keep picking on you?" He straightened up again and rubbed his temples with the callous-threaded tips of his fingers. "
"Hey, no, don't start that. You've done nothing wrong, okay?" The blonde rubbed his thumb absently against Tony's lower spine. "I mean that."
it about him. It's just how the conversation happened to go." He hesitated. "I know him and I may not always see eye-to-eye but he's not a complete pain in the ass."
Tony rolled his eyes. "
if you're not hungry, Tony. You look tired and like you haven't been eating enough. I feel like I haven't seen you properly in- in
Steve's favourite little diner didn't typically do takeaway, but the staff knew and liked him well enough that they didn't usually mind. Tony had waited in the car, looking at the half-lit neon sign outside and thinking of the gone-to-seed interior, with its peeling paint and faded cracked leather booths, the serving girls all beyond their prime and barely held in by their frilled dresses and aprons. He wondered how such a place was still going, because clearly it had enough customers to make a business, but somehow not enough to keep everything looking at least semi-decent. Still, despite the questionable appearance to the diner, it was almost certainly the best around; Tony would pick this place with Steve over one of the stupidly uptight and gourmet restaurants he had visited before with his mom or dad in the city, any day.
"Yes, Tony, some of us actually like being sociable." Her tone was the most carefree it had been for a long time and for a moment, Tony wondered if the usual tense concern that laced it was related to him.
resided from the door. Pushing it open, he gestured grandly to the other three teenagers for them to enter.
A pleasant atmosphere hung about the room as they talked and ate, like the factory smell in a new car: refreshing. Far too often, the Stark mansion seemed cloaked in a suffocating and heady air that seemed to soak into your every being. It was suffocating at best and frequently drove Tony to anywhere outside of the place. There had been times before, at night, staring up at the ceiling in an insomniac daze, breathing in that clotted silence had felt like having his face smothered in a wet blanket. After a while he usually gave up and would scale down from his window to walk the streetlamp-yellow washed streets, earphones in, just so he could
Tony raised his eyebrows at his boyfriend. "Are you now? What if I say no?"
"Is it really that important, Tony? Can't it wait until some other time?"
"Yeah, I think so." He frowned, suddenly a little unsure - the guy hadn't been verging on anything serious, but then again... "At least, he's not not okay, I don't think."
Maria Stark half-heartedly hid her sigh of irritation. "No. It's fine, Jarvis. Thank you." Tiredly, she put down her wine glass and stared resentfully at the long-cold vegetables on her plate.
James had joined the support group with Tony a mere few weeks after he himself had started going, and Barnes and Barton had somehow hit it off - it seemed to Tony that they shouldn't work together at all, what with Clint's Bipolar Disorder and Self-destructive tendencies and James' PTSD, and yet, it did. Under Steve and James' insistence, Clint had started spending more time with the three of them and Tony learnt that the guy was actually supposed to go to their school, but found it difficult to cope after his most recent attempt (over two months ago) and so worked from home instead. It was weird, seeing someone so similar yet so different in terms of issues to himself; someone who'd been through their own fucked up childhood and was now paying the price in mental health issues and suicidal tendencies. Still, James seemed to be improving, as did Clint - Tony was pretty sure the guy had been clean of everything since his last attempt.
The impatience in his mom's voice made him falter; she'd been more and more short-tempered as of late and the last thing he wanted to do was give her a reason to spend equally as little time with him as his father did.
Tony could do nothing more than nod in response - arguing would be pointless and ultimately lead nowhere. "Okay. Thank you."
Tony felt the stiffness in his shoulders release as swiftly as it had arrived. Pure and unrelenting exhaustion swept over him, filling the space left by the tension and suddenly all he wanted to do was cling to his mom and cry into her sweater like he hadn't done since he was barely past her hip. Relenting to the bone-deep ache, he slumped into one of the cushy leather-covered barstools tucked under the island. As he rested his forehead against the soothing cold marble top, worn fingers carded with motherly affection through the tangled locks of his hair (when was the last time he'd washed that?).
"I know his judgement means a lot to you, dear, but this is about you and your wellbeing. If he doesn't want what's best for you, then why does it matter what he thinks?"
Everyone has blue days sometimes; that's just life. But at what point does it stop being life and start being a problem? That heavy set feeling of cloying numbness seemed to have crept upon him overnight, settling over his entirety like a second skin. Some days were okay, manageable: he could get up, function, pretend the darkness at the corners of his vision wasn't there. Those days were fine. Other days were like being anesthetised and swallowing glass, at once. Agonising numbness. Numb agony. It was all the same. On those days, he could stare up at the ceiling for what felt like mere moments, but in reality hours had passed, yet somehow, the day seemed to ooze by as slow as bitter molasses.
Tony swallowed with an audible click. "My mom. She wasn't meant to-" He cut himself off and shook his head slowly. "I don't know who was meant to, really. But it definitely wasn't her." He flexed his fingers carefully and watched the circulation flood pink warmth through the tight white skin. "She found me out on the balcony, half with it, all slobbery and slurred, pissed outta my mind. I don't know who called the ambulance, but it wasn't her. Jarvis ended up being the one who made me vomit; she was in too much shock and dad- dad was-" the words caught in his throat and choked him off.
"Oh no, no, no. You can't just leave it at that. Come on, explain."
"Are you
Jarvis cleared his throat softly. "I believe Mister Stark was intending to attend dinner." He paused for a response but when there wasn't one, he followed up with "would you like me go remind him?"
"I- Yeah, I guess I had been. I was going to wait longer, but then mom and dad decided to take some spur-of-the-moment time off and went out to a restaurant. Seemed like an unmissable opportunity."
Clint nodded slowly. "Had my dad actually been able to hold down a job and not drink everythin' he earned, I'm sure he woulda been the same."
That was, at least, until his dad's work started to gain some traction. Until his dad started having less and less time for him, or his mother. Until his father started shutting himself away in his office-come-workshop for hours on end. Until the only time he would really see his dad was in the morning or sitting through a stony-silent dinner.
Weighty silence lingered lengthy and and stifling over the room before Tony relented and nodded. "Okay, yeah."

"It's fine, mom. I'm not hungry." Digging further through his bag, his brow furrowed; how the

." His lower lip jutted out childishly. "He doesn't even spend time with us, anymore."
"Because he just couldn't seem to make his disappointment clear quick enough. He didn't stay around with my mom, after she found me, while she was waiting for the ambulance. He didn't ever come visit me in the hospital - not even a fucking
She was in the kitchen, frowning softly as she tried to fit newspaper wrapped dishes into a heavy-duty box; they were moving to some big house his father had visited several times and said they would love. "Hm?"
Tony blinked in surprise and looked at his boyfriend incredulously. "You what? Since when have you met her?!"
"He doesn't know." The teenager squeezed his eyes shut and dragged his hand over his face, digging his fingertips into his temples. "I know, I should have told him. But it's not like we're actually
"Tony, dear." She faltered for a moment, her lips quivering as they tried to keep up with her mind. "Breakfast?" She asked at last.
. Sometimes, Tony wondered if anyone truly knew what was going on inside his father's high-walled mind.
The blonde nodded in agreement. "Sound good. Then where to?"
Too tired to make forced small-talk with anyone, Tony sat down heavily on a chair, across the circle from a guy who couldn't seem to sit still. His blonde hair was a spiked greasy mess and his fingers jittered against his forearms in tandem with his shaking knees; it was hard to tell if he was having withdrawal, high on caffeine or generally anxious. Studying him casually, Tony figured he wouldn't be too surprised if it was actually a mix of all three.
They stood silently for several long moments, until James clambered out from behind the minibar, his hands clutching desperately at an armful of snack packets. "Not to interrupt or anything, but if you're done having your moment, would you mind giving me a hand?"
Tony flexed his thumbs over the keypad on his phone screen; on one hand, if Steve came and picked him up, he'd have to wait, and he didn't exactly want to risk getting caught by anyone (not that it would actually make any difference if they did, but still). Plus, a walk might help calm his head a little. But then again, it was a fair distance to walk and and if Steve drove, they could always
"True that. My dad's a big fan of using money to both 'make-up for' being shitty and to shutter me away, so I'm less of a disappointment."
"Has he spoken to anyone about it?"
"Mister Stark, I will go and ask if he is otherwise occupied." Jarvis turned fluidly on his heel and strode from the dining room. Squirming in his seat, Tony felt as if he'd shrunk in his seat, back to the time when he was nine and had accidentally broken one of the fancy looking glass statuettes on the sitting room mantle piece. He'd had to wait outside his dad's office for what must have been hours, fidgeting anxiously and chewing on the edges of his nails until they were down to the quick and oozing hot pin-pricks of blood.
"But you didn't see a reason to tell him."
"Clint..." Holly called after the guy half-heartedly; she spoke as if this had occurred before and for a moment Tony wondered if the guy wasn't actually new after all. That he just hadn't been present the two previous weeks Tony had gone and this was his first week back in a while. Though, it quite obviously wasn't going too well.
Steve chuckled softly. "I'll tell him that, shall I?"
window: upstairs would be easier to access without being seen, but climbing down from the third or even second floor would be questionable. However, going out a window on the first floor would risk being seen, and at that point he may as well use the front door.
"Don't you sass me." Tony interrupted. Steve just laughed.
"I- Yeah, she is." Tony found himself hesitating over nothing. "I'm glad she likes you. Not that I thought she wouldn't but-"
As the last girl in the circle introduced herself, Holly smiled at them again, though this time it seemed more plastic than before. "Okay, everyone, let's take a short break. I'll be back in a few minutes and then we'll continue." She stood and left the room. Tony exhaled hard and pinched the bridge of his nose; everything was just so
He sighed. Where to fucking start?
what your father thinks."
"I'm Tony and I've got Clinical Depression. I'm here because I tried to kill myself." As with the first time he'd introduced himself to the support group, no one so much as batted an eyelid at his confession; suicide attempts weren't anything new to them.
Tony exhaled hard and let his body sag. "I don't care, really. Anywhere we can escape."
"Dad.." He trailed off, unsure of where to go or what to say.
Tony shrugged nonchalantly and took another bite from his bacon and cheese filled bun. "I mean, if that's what she thinks is best, then I'm all go. Yeah, the idea of listening to other teenagers whine about their equally shitty problems sounds like a bore, but then again, I'm not the professional." He glanced up and made eye-contact with Steve. "What do you think about it?"
For several moments, the only noise in the limited space of the car was the duet of their post-orgasmic panting, the heavy scent of sex sitting low in their senses.
His father turned from the table and left, as though his son hadn't spoken, in the same storming stride, calling out "I don't want to be disturbed for the rest of the night" over his shoulder as he went.
so, I figured, it's fine."
," his mom snorted into her drink, "maybe you can teach a thing or two to Tony then, because god knows I've tried plenty and I've gotten
"I'm glad to hear he's easing off on you, Tony." He said, over the rumbling purr of the engine. "It's unfair he's been so stringent for so long."
It's funny how you don't notice the small things changing, how you only realise there's an issue when you trip and suddenly it's like your eyes are fully open for the first time and everything is different.
The blonde was quiet for a moment, deep in thought. "I agree with your therapist - I think it would be a good idea, too. Yes, perhaps not the most enjoyable way to spend your time, but maybe it'll help give you a different perspective of your depression."
to get me drunk?" She teased.
"Don't stop. Keep going, I'm almost there." Steve's pleasure-face was back and Tony crooked his neck to suck a love-bite under his boyfriend's collar bone. As he pulled at the thin skin with his teeth, he jerked his hand faster under Steve's moans slipped into throaty gasps.
It wasn't like Tony didn't have his own car, but since the whole suicide attempt thing, his parents had been somewhat reluctant to let him go driving on his own. It wasn't like he didn't understand their reasoning, but that didn't make it any less annoying and inconvenient.
"You said he touched that thing, right?"
"I have Papa and Daddy."
"It is from a book", the soldier said to his friend. "I think you would like it, it is a continuation of The Hobbit that came out later."
"You realise we can't tell the others, right?" He said, making his boyfriend frown. "Think about it. Who in the Avengers would completely refuse to believe this isn't a trick? Maybe doing something bad?"
The connection broke and for a long time Tony just sat there. Wishing he could reach through the device to be with his husband. Or even better, bring him home.
"You love him enough to forgive me?"
Once he calmed down they let him eat his apple, brushed his teeth and helped him put on a pyjama. Then stayed with him until he fell asleep. Afterwards they had gotten... busy... in a very nice way.
"Heard about him, certainly."
"I don't know what you are talking about", the archer protested.
Wait... What!?
"None of us can read these scratches." Stark flipped through one book.
Wrapping his arms around his husband, the blond didn't say anything at first. Just relishing in the closeness. "I love you too, Tony. You gave me a place to belong. Gave me time."
Tony exited the elevator on the common floor to the sight of Barton flipping through some sort of notebook or something. The archer was showing Natasha whatever it was. Both looking rather impressed.
He was therefore surprised when the soldier came back much earlier than usual. And...
It was definitely one of the easiest patients he had ever had. Loki sat happily on the medbay bed while Bruce looked him over. Staring at everything around him while babbling.
Holding his husband close, Steve decided he would ask Bucky to babysit fairly soon. He very much wanted some alone time with Tony. Especially after his little reveal.
"..."
"Do you want more food?"
"You are right. Tony", Steve cradled his cheek, "we are his second chance. The best possible to give him a good life. Because we love him and will do anything in our power to protect him. And apparently, we will live for as long as needed to ensure that."
"No!" The boy yelled and tried to hide even more.
Picking out books from the small, private library, Thor had the idea that Loki could teach Loki. Through his own books that he had written throughout the centuries.
"I wanted to play..."
He landed on top of the Avengers Tower and headed inside. Heading straight towards the penthouse. Sitting on the floor when he arrived, Loki looked up from his toys, seeing him.
"Yeah, I remember. He was studying engineering, right?"
"How was I to expect he would be so fussy?"
"Neither of you seem particularly concerned that Loki wandered around unsupervised..."
"Upstairs... you mean they are with Lo... OW!" The archer rubbed his head. Due to his wife hitting him again as his tone grew hostile.
But every comment I get spurs me to keep writing. So thank you all who likes and comments on my stories.
"JARVIS recommended it for Loki and I decided to try it. It is actually pretty good."
"So, how's Washington?"
"What do you mean? I remember Loki being really excited but no one I spoke to seemed to have heard of it."
Bringing him to Steve and by extension Tony.
His mother chuckled sadly. "If by some miracle the conditions were met and the spell succeeded, there would be a cascade of effects following it. Because your life before that would have been miserable, you would end up near the people who would be best for your chance at happiness. They would then also be affected by the spell."
"Or..." Steve said slowly, starting to have an epiphany. "Natasha takes Thor's floor, and I 'bunk' with you."
"Okay, Loki", he said. "I'm just going to use some soap, okay?" With a washcloth he carefully scrubbed the kid. There was a small whine but thankfully he was allowed to finish cleaning the boy. Including washing the black hair. Once that was done he poured a bath and added some bubbles.
Looking at the wall clock the billionaire realised it was already 10 o'clock. To be fair, he had been up late.
"There is no way I won't end up wanting you in my ass if I do that."
"You wouldn't have been able to stop him even if you tried. Why didn't you just go get him food? Or take him to the cafeteria?"
Steve chuckled a bit. "We are married", he said. "Loki is our son."
His heart was still aching but now he felt that his happiness wasn't in danger anymore.
"Daddy, jag hämta honom", the child said to one of them. Receiving a pat on the head.
"Er... JARVIS, any advice?"
"What?" He said. "You all know now, so of course I'm going to smooch my hubby."
"None, your comrades live a fairly uneventful life. Are you ready to go?"
"What about it?"
"Wait, you did what?" Banner exclaimed.
"Yeah, I know. It is called the god of mischief being a baby."
"What is happening?" He asked. "Shouldn't we stop this?"
The scientist was thankfully already in the lab, working. He looked up when he heard the engineer.
"No! No way! I rather risk my own life than risk his!"
"Okay, more honest. And you don't need to try to make me happy. Just being with you does that."
The end of the week came. There were no more time. Tony watched as Steve tried to explain to Loki where he was going and promised he would be back very soon. It was hard to tell if the tiny god had understood or not. After a hug the boy ran off to his toys.
"Jaaaa!" Their son sprinted to the TV where JARVIS helpfully started playing something suitable.
Tapping away on his tablet Tony waited for his husband to finish putting their son to bed. He no longer woke up as often in the night and even if he did, he was comfortable enough to go back to sleep on his own. A few times a week they took him to something called open preschool. Parents and their kids gathered. Allowing the children to play with each other while the adults talked. Sometimes there were activities as well.
While Steve distracted the boy with his phone the engineer used a small needle and pricked the index finger. He then used some kind of small pipe to collect the drop of blood. Thankfully it didn't seem to bother the child. While the AI analysed the blood the soldier placed the kid on the sofa, making a quick semolina porridge.
"Nej."
The soldier followed the engineer obediently. His mind racing. Without thinking he threw his arms around the other, holding him close. Shaking. Tony didn't say anything and just hugged him back. After a few minutes Steve managed to compose himself.
produced a death certificate of the made-up woman as to explain why the kid now lived with him. Additionally, she made certain that the two men could pick up their marriage licences without causing any commotion.
"I've thought about it for a while. We are very vulnerable here. In case of an attack, a lot of people would be in danger and we become sitting ducks. Also... I want to keep Loki safe while giving him freedom to just be a kid, you know."
"Oh, really?" Tony placed the broken action figure on the low table. "Who else here would specifically decide to torment Loki?"
"Huh...uh...yes?" Warm hands touched his body, slowly roaming his torso. But only on top of his clothes. More kisses were placed on his lips and the engineer was definitely starting to throw all caution out the window. Whatever this was, he wanted more of it. Answering the kisses and holding on to the super soldier he was heating up.
"Jarv? Do you know what happened?"
"Alright. I believe you. He will need a birth certificate, JARVIS can probably help me with that, some bits of background information, just in case, and..." the engineer let her babble as he joined his fiancé.
Tony smiled. Steve was the love of his life, the only one to accept all of him. Forgiving Barnes, however, wasn't for the sake of his husband. It was for the sake of himself. He had realised it was far too easy to let resentment and anger rule you. For the sake of his family, he didn't want that to be him.
"I've been practicing. And used YouTube."
"But..."
I inquired about this, wondering if they had issues with other writers in my language, while I didn't get an answer on that. I was told that they are very pleased with my work and that I'm reliable. Which is why I get the bulk of those commissions.
"You named your kid Loki?"
"Our workaround. With this we can talk without SHIELD tracking the call. There is even a small screen inside." Tony pointed out the different features, in essence it was pretty much a phone. "...and it works by jumping the space between other phone lines. Don't think too hard about it. The point is that it doesn't have a fixed location and its transmissions are masked. There is also this."
"Tony..." the soldier said with a worried frown.
A Cher song came on, the Shoop Shoop song, or something. It was quite catchy.
Tony was quiet for a few moments, thinking. "On the hellicarrier... adult Loki's scan showed that his body temperature was lower than the room... Thor had an increased thermal reading in comparison. That is actually a very likely scenario. Dang, he is going to have questions we can't answer... like, how do we explain why he can turn blue when we don't know?"
"Thank you, buddy", the soldier said. "I'm feeling better already. Why don't you go find uncle Bucky and ask him to play with you?"
"It comes down to the definition of evil", Tony said, sipping from his glass. "There are probably plenty of people who would call me evil for inventing and selling weapons. To them, it doesn't matter that I've stopped and tried to change. In their eyes, I'm still evil."
"Unless it is an emergency."
"In Loki's mouth! Nom nom!"
"Thank you, Jarv. See, Brucie Bear. No harm, no foul. We told Loki to avoid making you angry, so he was probably careful."
"Suuuure, because you are sooo out of shape", the engineer grinned. Smiling the soldier gave him a kiss.
The boy was scribbling in a book while Bruce watched him. They hadn't spent a lot of time together but this time, no one else had been available. Tony and Steve was doing something upstate. Leaving the scientist alone with the tiny god of mischief. And while Loki most definitely lived up to his title, it wasn't malicious.
Unfortunately, things had taken a nosedive. Especially after he returned to New York. With all the would-be villains popping up everywhere, he could hardly sit back and do nothing. She did
"So, what's our plan?" He asked, hiding his true feelings.
The engineer wrapped his arms around the strong neck, stepping close. His husband placed his hands in the curve of his back.
He was feeling bored. It wasn't often he felt that way but right now he was. None of his toys were drawing his attention. Daddy and Papa were talking about something, they probably didn't want to be interrupted. Scary maybe-aunt Natasha had said children shouldn't interrupt adults talking. Loki wasn't so sure she was right about that but it wasn't like he couldn't find someone else to play with.
"Do that. Did you guts eat?"
Steve laughed. "It is fine, come on in."
"That's Papa and Daddy."
The billionaire paused, looked at the scan again. "Nope, there is no way she will be able to live there. In fact, she shouldn't. But it is not like there are open floors..." he tapped his chin. "I guess you could take Thor's floor while Romanoff bunks with Barton."
"Thanks, Lo. Ahh! Nom nom." Their son giggled as Tony ate the offered blueberry in an exaggerated manner. "Now in your mouth."
Tony swore as his latest attempt failed. He shivered despite being bundled up in the thickest winter clothing he had been able to find. At the end of June. The Avengers had been called out because some crazy jackass had used a device to blast everything and everyone with cold. Like, literal ice. After neutralizing the threat they had moved the device to his workshop. Unfortunately the outer layer had become damaged and was now constantly releasing extreme cold. From the looks of things, the outer layer had been damaged by the core itself.
The soldier stared at him. Then he smiled and hugged the engineer while giving him a kiss. "Thank you. But what about Loki?"
"So, what do we do now?" Steve asked, furrowing his brow in that cute way of his. "This isn't a trick, Loki has really become a child."
Almost like... wait. But that was...
"I swear, every time I visit, the kid has even more toys", the dark-skinned man said. "Stark is really spoiling him."
"We could ask, but we wouldn't be able to understand his answer", Tony said, still holding their son. "We can usually figure out what he wants but he isn't exactly talking English."
"Well, yeah. Not the first time I've seen him as a blueberry. That reminds me that I intended to ask you, what do you know about his race?"
The scientist sighed again and proceeded to ignore the engineer. Who pouted. He wasn't meant to take one of the gas tubes but it felt suspicious so he had... borrowed... one during clean up. Playing with a tool he found he waited while twirling on his chair.
"If they don't let them go, I will go after them myself!"
"Fine, I will wait patiently. Just... come home soon. Your pancakes are better than mine."
As the siblings had gone through half the pile Loki was still on his first. Taking his time. Bucky knew the boy had talent, Steve had been teaching him the basics. The picture taking form was clearly of his family. His dads alongside honorary uncles and aunt. All surrounding himself while wearing smiles.
"He started crying when I was trying to leave, and then I didn't want to wake him."
"Why was he ungrateful?" Bruce asked.
"To what?"
JARVIS never called Papa and Daddy Papa and Daddy. It was a bit weird but Loki recognised the words anyway. "They are busy."
"You... your marriage is... physical?"
"What's with the jazz?" The man nodded to the speakers.
"Back to Midgard?" Heimdall asked.
"Vaguely."
Walking the streets of New York, Steve couldn't help but smile. He was carrying Loki on his back, the boy had played until he dropped and was now sleeping. Having some time together had been a great idea. Even if he hoped Tony would join them next time.
"We didn't break up", the blond said calmly. "We got married this past spring and was dating before that."
"Can you show us?" Tony said and got a small nod. The small god of mischief walked over to the table and picked something up in each hand.
"I saw the math book..."
