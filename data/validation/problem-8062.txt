Steve didn’t reply, just stared at Tony, who shook his head.
Now it was Clint’s turn to laugh. “Sure. He would drop dead after ten minutes.”
Steve always had an emergency bag ready, so he was good to go on a moment’s notice. Yet for some reason something held him back from just taking his bag and flying to Romania. It felt wrong to leave without telling the others, or at least telling Tony.
Tony jumped at the sudden outburst, spilling some of his coffee on his pyjamas. “What the fu- oh you have got to be kidding me!”
It sounded like the plot of a mediocre rom-com staring a blonde himbo and a very sexy nerd, who against all odds find love, thanks to their quirky best friends.
That would be the mature and sensible thing to do.
After they had eaten, Clint and Natasha went for a swim, while Bruce was clearing away the left-over food and dishes with Steve. Thor meanwhile devoted himself to the things he had wrapped up in his towel.
“You’re setting the bar too high man. Now whatever I give her for her birthday has to be better than those.” Clint hissed, hoping Nat wouldn’t hear him.
Rage exploded within Tony and he saw red. In two quick steps he was on Hammer’s neck, pushing him away from Peter into a bookshelf behind him. Before he could even think about controlling himself, not that he planned on doing that anytime soon, and let his fist rain down on Hammer’s face, wiping that smug expression off.
Much love and thanks for reading!
When he didn’t reply, she sighed and put her hand on his. “You know I can’t go back to my old life. Not after all this.”
Without the toy phone but with a victorious smile on his lips, Tony returned to his friends. “Easy! Now, how about we let our great warrior over here storm into a store shouting ‘for Narnia!’”
Suppressing a smile, she picked the last piece of paper.
Tony liked that Bruce knew him well enough to know that something was up and that he had the balls to point it out to him. There were only two other people in the world who knew him like that. And Pepper barely talked to him anymore, unless it was something about Stark Industries. After their kiss on the roof, with the Stark Expo exploding in the background they went on a few dates and then New York happened. And then… nothing. It wasn’t like Tony didn’t think that Pepper was attractive and smart and by far the most amazing woman he had ever met. He adored her and he wished he could love her in more than just a platonic way. He wished he could give her the love she deserved. Not that she needed him for that. But still, it hurt him when he saw her face drop after he explained to her that their one kiss was all that there would ever be.
Clint and Nat had helped Steve picking out the perfect tree for the tower, which took almost two days, while Bruce feverishly had started drafting a Christmas menu.
“Mean woman.” He hissed, but Tony could have sworn there was a hint of a smile in Clint’s eyes. God, those two were almost as bad as, well, never mind.
Tony turned around in Steve’s lap and picked up the paper.
Clint and Tony were barely able to stop themselves from laughing at the slightly embarrassed expression on the god’s face.
“I know a lot of things Tony.”
“Widow! Look at what I found! Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
“Uhm or we could go into town. There might be some nice places to eat.”
Her nephew Peter still worked in his shop three days a week even though Tony had told him to stay with his aunt and take care of her. As expected, Aunt May had insisted that he go anyway, and Tony was sure it was just as much because she knew how much Peter liked the little bookshop, as she craved some time to herself.
“Oh, please Tony, Steve would have to carry you back up here.” Bruce chimed in.
Steve got up from his seat. “You’re in this as well?”
It was their first Christmas together and Tony insisted that he had to leave for a business trip.
Steve ran his hand across his face in a futile attempt to regain his composure, making Tony laugh again. It was the most beautiful sound in the world. If embarrassing himself in front of strangers is what it took for Tony to smile and be happy, then he would gladly spend his life doing just that.
Steve was lying in bed, watching the ceiling. He body was screaming for sleep, but his brain was wide awake.
“No! No, you can’t do that.” Clint begged. Little did he know that was exactly what Natasha had wanted. She loved the fact that she could have one of the most skilled assassins begging for mercy. While there was a cone stuck to her head. And melting vanilla ice cream running down her cheek. That was true power.
Steve chuckled with his lips pressed against Tony’s exposed neck. “We do indeed.”
Tony’s shoulders dropped. The last thing he needed was a sermon from Pepper, even though he knew he deserved it. He could only imagine what a publicity nightmare this was going to be for her.
Tony snorted at that and crossed his arms. “Sure, they are.” That came out way bitchier than he had intended and by the way Bruce was looking at him, he knew that he was about to be questioned by the scientist.
Tony, still unable to move, stared at the door, as if it would open again any second and Steve would come back out and… And what? And finish what he started?
Thor’s face lit up. “That sounds most incredible!” And with that he went off into the nearest store as if running into battle for an imaginary place with talking animals.
He had fucked it up with Pepper, had seen how hurt she was. Pepper, who was one of the strongest people Tony has ever met. He had been sure, that if he could make it with someone it had to be her. And yet it all ended in tears and heartbreak.
“Anyways,” Tony interrupted the silence. “I think it’s a pin up girl.”
Nat kicked Bruce’s leg under the table and the scientist yelped. “Ow! I mean… Oh! That sounds like a great idea. Let’s all go for a hike!”
Bruce and Clint proceeded to explain the rules of Texas Hold’Em to Steve and Thor, but Steve wasn’t really listening. It was very untypical for him to be that unfocused and easily distracted. But lately his mind seemed to just wander off without him having any say in it. Daydreaming has never really been his thing until recently and it was unnerving!
Bruce sighed and shook his head. “I’ll explain later.” He glanced over at Tony, who shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
Pepper didn’t even look up from her phone, her perfectly manicured fingers flying over the screen. She was wearing an immaculate snow-white suit, her strawberry blond hair tied back in a tight ponytail, lips painted bright red. She looked as perfect as ever.
The doctors had said that it wasn’t life-threating but that her hearing and her balance would be impaired and could get worse. They could operate if she wanted. If she could afford it.
“I know what you mean.” She looked over her shoulder at Clint and Steve smiled softly.
And yet he turned around.
Natasha was laughing even more, making Tony roll his eyes.
He thought back to all the times Steve came down to his workshop to bring him something to eat, because he knew that Tony forgot to eat when he was working.
The blond man nodded, smiling brightly.
“Since when do you think drinking is a bad idea?” Clint teased.
Steve’s smile dropped immediately, before he could stop himself his eyes darted over to Tony, who in turn tried to kill Natasha by sheer willpower. Bruce and Clint were both trying their best not to laugh, while Thor was visibly confused by the sudden tension in the air.
“What did I do?”
Was Steve his friend? Or was Steve something else?
Before he could get another word in edge wise, Tony abandoned Steve along with his half-chopped onions in the kitchen and went to inspect Thor’s and Clint’s creation.
“I just hope you don’t expect us to salute the flag.” Nat added.
Thor eagerly raised his hand. “I would be honoured to be the first.”
Bruce, Clint and Natasha hadn't celebrated Christmas in years and seemed really excited when Steve first suggested celebrating together.
He couldn’t hold back a short bark of laughter. “Thor, you were the only one with enough balls to actually tell me. I’m upset about the information, not the messenger.”
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
“What’s going on?”
“Captain.” She tried to keep her voice cold, but there was an unmistakable undertone of anger.
How do you start a conversation like this?
He continued to stand there, staring at Steve’s bedroom door for a moment, until his hands stopped shaking before he went into his own room, closing the door gently, as if to make up for Steve slamming his.
Justin Hammer laughed his slimy little laugh, wiggling a finger at Tony. “Ah I see you haven’t changed at all Tony.”
Steve just nodded in response, too afraid to say something wrong again.
“You know, I don’t think she’s gonna let us out any time soon.” Steve said quietly, worried he would upset Tony even more.
The shocked expression on Tony’s face was priceless and Steve really wished he had a camera to capture this moment forever. Natasha meanwhile doubled over from laughter, which earned her a stern look from Steve. “Hold still or I’m gonna mess it up!”
The man in front of Bruce looked at him with wide eyes and slowly backed away from him, before turning around and almost running away.
Clint just shrugged his shoulders and shoved some gummy bears into his mouth.
Without even looking at him the man pointed to a blond guy inside the shop, standing with his back to the window front, paintbrush in hand. A blond guy whose shoulders were wider than the average doorframe. For a moment Tony just watched the play of blond guy’s back muscles as he continued to move the paintbrush up and down the wall. After a good minute of staring, Tony forced himself to snap out if it and get in there to tell blond guy to leave. He took a deep breath, put his frown back on and entered the shop through the already open door.
Unbeknownst to him there was more than just a shopping trip on the to-do-list for today. What Tony had forgotten, or quite possibly just repressed, was that today was Friday. And Friday was movie night. That was the law. Usually they also got take-out food but since they had that yesterday and Bruce felt like cooking, they let him work his magic. Not that anyone could have stopped him, even if they wanted to.
“Yes. That sounds great.”
He hated hikes.
Coffee in hand, Tony crossed the street. He was sure this was just a big misunderstanding and that the workers got the address wrong and that they meant to renovate some other store far away from here.
Choosing to let the foodies be, Tony went further downstairs, to the bottom floor. Apart from Nat’s and Clint’s bedrooms, there was also a game room with a pool table, a dart board, he was sure Clint was going to insist on playing, which as everyone knew was pointless, and a poker table. Naturally there was also a bar in the games room.
Tony had been acting weird for a few days now, ever since the team had decided to do a Secret Santa for Christmas.
Still slightly suspicious Nat got up and sat down next to Steve, handing him the small bottle. “Okay then.”
Bruce was the first to speak again. “Town?”
“I think you need to dial it down Steve. We’re on your side and we’re just trying to help.” Bruce spoke up. Tony was one of the closest friends he ever had and witnessing him being spoken to like that made him… angry.
Steve snorted and put his hands on his hips, stepping closer to Tony, towering over him. “Is that how you want it?”
Thor and Tony were sitting next to each other in the sand. Tony holding a bucket and Thor holding a plastic shovel.
Tony turned to his side, tugging an arm under his head. “Now the question is: what do we do about this whole mess?”
Those two really had it bad for each other.
Not because he thought maybe Steve was just confused or all the other crap people say about bisexual people, like it’s just a phase or whatever. No, what concerned him was that Steve had a crush on him of all people. Heaven knows Steve was no angel, but he undeniably deserved better than him. He deserved someone who could make him feel safe, even more so if this was indeed his first time. He deserved someone who wasn’t as messed up as he was.
, conjured up enough courage to talk to Tony and a structure of rectangular cloth bags filled with feathers foiled his plans. Just his luck.
But when Steve approached Tony, he quickly joined the others around the table, leaving Steve standing there by himself. “Oh, look cheeseburgers!”
He couldn’t help himself but grin a little. He had missed being around Pepper.
“We will see about that.” Tony turned on his heel and without looking back exited the shop. He would put things straight and he would kick this guy out of May’s bakery and fix the damage his builders had done to it.
If only it were this simple.
After another little pause, Pepper finally spoke. “Did you take any painkillers?”
Sam was about to pick up Bucky’s unconscious body, but Steve knocked him aside and shot him a glance that made unmistakably clear, that no one but him was to touch Bucky. Without a word, Steve picked up his friend and carried him into the jet.
Thanks to the brilliant, but insufferably arrogant brain surgeon, May was on the path of recovery and Tony was sure she would take over the bakery again in a few months.
Tony had finally recovered from his shock and made his way over to them. “Cap, you really keep surprising me with that mouth of yours.”
They had landed on the roof of the building Bucky, according to the file, lived in. He had decided to enter in his civilian cloths and not as Captain America, just bringing his shield with him. No weapons. He was confident that Bucky would recognise him, just like before, and that he wouldn’t even need Sam as backup.
“Yeah that seems unlikely. There are no eggs stuck to the ceiling” Nat mumbled, and Steve was almost glad about the little jab. It’s what Natasha did, and you only ever should worry when she is super nice to you. That means you’re in deep shit. So, he took her comment as a good sign.
Tony hadn’t looked at him this morning. But then again that was to be expected, after Steve’s horrible, horrible flirting attempt. He hadn’t been able to sleep all night, which happened a lot lately. So, instead of getting some desperately needed rest, he had stared at the ceiling and thought of ways to fix this whole mess.
So, the responsible thing to do would be to talk to Steve about all of this and make it clear to him, that he had chosen the wrong man. Thank you very much for your interest in Tony Stark, unfortunately we are currently not hiring any hot super soldiers, who make us feel weak in the knees and hard in other places.
Maybe especially if it was Steve.
Only now Tony noticed the haunted expressions on the faces of the others. He had assumed it had something to do with the debacle that was yesterday, but as it turns out there was a brand-new crisis ahead.
Clint had tried to convince them that he should come with, arguing that he could fly the jet and that it would be good to have another pair of helping hands. Of course, Natasha knew that this was about how Steve had spoken to her this morning. The jab about her past didn’t sit well with him at all. She wasn’t that thrilled about it either, making a mental note to talk to Steve about that when he had calmed down a little, but Clint… It was him who had made the call to bring Nat in instead of following his orders. It was him who convinced her to come with him, to choose to be better. It was him who stood up for her, when they barely even knew each other. So, to him an attack on her felt like an attack to him. It was sweet really. And she loved him for that, even though she hadn’t even said that to him yet.
Steve watched as his best friend sank to the ground unconscious and a burning fury took over his body. He was so consumed by his anger, that he didn’t even notice the jet landing just a few strides away from them. Before Steve could do anything stupid, he might have regretted later, Natasha’s voice rang out behind him.
Through the open window he could hear Natasha and Thor making a lot of noise in the pool downstairs.
Natasha took another step toward Steve and narrowed her eyes on him, just like she had done before with Thor. Unfortunately for her, she wasn’t as lucky this time. It took a bit more than her glaring at Steve to intimidate him. Not much more, but still. Also, he really enjoyed teasing his friends like that.
For now, the important thing was to get him back, keep him safe and let him know that he was no longer alone.
“Yes, bu-“
Tony looked at her in confusion, but she already stopped paying attention to him, taking Clint by the hand and disappearing out of the room.
Bruce nodded in agreement and Nat threw her arms up in mock-frustration. “Fine!”
It's vacation day number two, Thor and Tony are bonding and Steve is acting weird.
“Hey Mister Stark, can we stop by the bodega- oh hi, sorry I didn’t know there was a customer there. I’ll wait in the back.” Peter was about to turn around again, when Hammer grabbed him by the shoulder.
“No. Just wanted to check if you’re okay. You seemed a bit… off tonight.”
But before he went to check up on Steve, he went up to his rooms to take a shower and put on a set of new cloths. He smelled gross and felt even grosser. He told J.A.R.V.I.S to start the shower and took of his sweat and blood-soaked cloths and took a look at himself in the mirror. There were already bruises forming all over his body, scratches lining his arms and of course there was his now disfigured face. God only knew what he would look like without his suit.
Steve remembered that he did get a text from Toni inviting him - Captain America - to a dinner party, and as Steve Evans already invited to the party, Steve naturally found a random reason to decline. Was Toni unhappy because of this? He'd never known Captain America was so important to her.
The man didn't give her the slightest chance, Natasha withdrew one point and Steve immediately followed with two more deeper. This in and out gave the man an even greater sense of wonder as he patted the girl's soft, upturned buttocks and let her crawl forward, while he pressed himself against her, thrusting hard again with each step, or simply pinching her waist so that she wrapped her entire length around him again.
"Call me Tony. You know there are many times when identity is more of a straitjacket for me, and I really do like you, Phanie, and I'd prefer you to know me as a living, breathing person, someone who would enjoy drinking with you and breaking into the arsenal with swords, rather than as that golden symbol on the seat."
Steve took both sides and sucked and gulped lightly, finally kissing his way up to her lips before pinning her down on the bed and filling her gently, "Nat, I love you. I'll never leave you again."
"We left that hospital on the same day, and maybe sometime we brushed past each other in front of the hospital." Steve, who later found out about the coincidence after being with Toni, said.
As soon as Red Skull saw the presence of Iron Woman at the base, he immediately realised that she was here to take Captain America. He quickly took the self-destruct device from his pocket and was about to press it, when Natasha's firepower quickly followed, destroying the device with one hand with her palm cannon, and aiming several shots at Red Skull's head with the other, sending him to the ground. Behind her, Steve reacted as quickly as she did and his shield flew out in the direction of Iron Woman. Natasha didn't dare risk Steve's life, she saw the device destroyed before she could dodge it and was hit in the side of the waist by the shield, landing on the ground from mid-air.
It had been a long time since Natasha had felt any kindness from anyone other than Rhodey and Pepper that had nothing to do with her status, and she remained unconvinced for a moment, "You, don't know me?"
No one had any news of Steve's location until the early lights, Natasha couldn't spend any more time in the studio without her fiancé, so she went back to her bedroom and dialled Pepper's number, stammering for a while before she got to the point, to Pepper's baffled expression. "You don't think he's backtracked and tried to run away from the marriage?"
"There seems to be one right here." Grant stretched his hands in the direction of the phone booths, "They converted all these phone booths into time machines a few years ago, you pick up the receiver and you can talk to yourself at any time."
Toni lazily rolled over herself in his arms, "No, that's a place for kids."
He stared at the girl's fluttering eyelashes, wondering how much of the delight in those big brown eyes was real, but he said to himself in his mind, I'll make it all real.
Steve draped his coat over Toni, "Have you ever thought that maybe this isn't the end?"
The AI seemed to take a long time to judge, and it was only moments before Steve stepped out of the building that he heard Jarvis reply, "Judging by the information available, this does not pose a security threat. I wouldn't have brought it up voluntarily if Madam hadn't asked about it. A pending view of the matter from Madam has been withdrawn."
She couldn't even imagine the sarcasm they had exchanged just a short time before.
Seeing that he was being paranoid at the moment, the girl could only hope for an early end to this travesty and obediently licked Steve clean carefully. He admired the way she worked so hard that her cheeks sunk in, while he rubbed the newly placed ring on her left ring finger.
Tony was silent for a long time, "You know I used to worry that we would lose the war, so I spent all my time fighting for a chance to win, not that I ever thought about it in that way. Now that I know we're going to win," he gave his love a compassionate smile, "maybe I can arrange some first aid for myself. But soldier, I can't really guarantee how successful that approach will be. I'll grant your request, but you also have to promise me that even if it doesn't really work out in the end, you'll ......" his words faded into a kiss as Steve leaned over, "I believe in you, Iron Man can do anything, and all my hopes are in you. "
Only then did he look up at the girl's face, not expecting her to still be so gentle with him at the moment, after he had deliberately avoided looking directly at her expression for fear of seeing hate appear on that face, for fear that it was really as the man had said, Toni had never loved him, only hate and fear. He finally relaxed, "Yeah, I was jealous, I was afraid you would really run off with him, maybe I should have locked you in the house, tied you to the bed, not let you go out, not given you clothes to wear, just gagged you and let me fuck you for the rest of your life so you could never run off and never get away from my cock."
Steve finished his day's work and rubbed his forehead as he prepared to take a break and leave the base. He thought of the smile Morgan would show when she saw him later and felt the day's tiredness dissipate.
By the second lap of the wheel, all the cone in Toni's hand had gone into her stomach, and the other cone, which was aptly named "reluctantly given to Steve", was only half eaten, as Toni turned her head to look at the view, "Next time you go on a Ferris wheel, you should bring a girl you like. "
Natasha once again felt the "I can do this all day" spirit of Steve Rogers. First he poured the bottle of pills he had found through the window in front of Natasha, and since then the girl has been under house arrest by Captain Hydra.
The two of them spent the afternoon lounging on the sofa watching a corny, cheesy romance movie and as the credits rolled Steve asked her, "What do you think you'll be like when you're old?"
But she didn't see Steve's impishly upturned mouth as he nodded his consent to carry her to the bathroom, and it was only when she was pinned against the wall in the bathroom that she realised that Steve's usual fourfold self-control had saved her so much suffering, and now she was faced with his unrestrained fourfold desire.
Toni handed Pepper the sunglasses she was holding and put on her standard professional smile, "Steve, you know me?"
Steve smiled at the girl who was yawning like a kitten, "No, amusement parks are also great places for young couples to go together."
Steve simply patted her face, pinched her chin and kissed her hard, moving his hand back to her soft breasts, which he held in one hand as he pushed the girl back against him, as if to pin her under him forever, "Toni, do you feel how you suck me? That hungry little mouth of yours down there doesn't want to stop." With that, the man slapped the girl's buttocks again, feeling her stimulated and rapidly contracting little mouth nearly pin him down and cum. He deliberately pulled himself out whole and thrusted again. As he did so, his hand was not idle, at times rubbing, at other times scraping his nails against her already swollen and sore red nipples.
Everything was slowly back into place, except for Steve who was alone in his dreams every night, searching for that tiny hope.
After a few hard jabs with two fingers, Steve felt the girl's struggle seem to lessen and was eager to squeeze in a third finger. The girl he was holding tightly down never opened her eyes, but her fluttering eyelashes betrayed her nervousness. Steve sniggered and after a few vigorous thrusts, he quickly withdrew his fingers and wiped the shiny water stain from his hand all over the girl's face.
As her pregnancy approached three months, the man's daily thoughts that he would be able to continue enjoying the girl in a few days would always strangle him, making Natasha feel like a piece of cake being watched and not knowing when she would be eaten up.
Natasha hadn't thought about how to console her fiancé, not anticipating the hands that continued to mess on her body, her brain uncontrollably directing her to utter the words, "I didn't satisfy you enough just now, is that why you're so urgent to do it again? Or several times?"
Steve was slightly unhappy by the fact that the girl still wouldn't open her eyes, so he held the head of his dick in place and drew malicious circles around the hole, but wouldn't go straight to the point, "I know what you want, open your eyes and beg me before I'll give you everything. I have all the patience in the world, I'll keep torturing you if you don't open your eyes. I can do this all day."
Natasha didn't know if it was the pain of the wound or the pain in her heart, but as soon as she closed her eyes, the tears fell. Steve finally felt a little pity, letting go of her hands and taking her cheeks instead, kissing away the tears, "Open your eyes and look at me, call me."
Without saying a word, Iron Woman immediately flew off with Captain America, leaving confusing Hulk and Thor behind.
"No." Toni shook her head.
Toni's tears filled her eyes, but she was smiling, her faint voice disappearing between their inseparable lips, "Want to do it?"
Steve nodded, thankfully, Toni wasn't too drunk. "You sit here, I'll go and get you some honey water."
"No sincerity at all, huh?" The girl bristled and refused to pay any more attention to him.
"You're crazy! That's Toni Stark! She can make me bankrupt with a mere phone call. Please, just take pity on me and take this job! It's only a week, you will get over it even with the hardest person to deal with, and Miss Stark has never been anything else but kind of mean to us. Think of how much your career will take off in the future if you get her favour, instead of being a pathetic little mass actor with me, and maybe I'll have to look up to you in the future."
"......"
The man's smile widened, "Am I supposed to know you? I think this is the second time we've met? If you count the time I just gave you back your phone."
Although he had agreed not to go into the water, Steve was coerced by Toni into changing into his swimsuit, and in the girl's words, "You can't just look at me without me looking at you." So he was wearing only a pair of swimming trunks as he set up the oven under the sun umbrella.
As if encouraged, Steve sucked heavily several more times before lifting his head and staring admiringly at his masterpiece - the girl's chest was already strewn with hand and tooth marks and her nipples were red and swollen. He looked at it for a moment before turning his attention to Natasha's face, "It must feel good huh? You almost rushed them into my mouth, right?" Without waiting for a reply, he ripped her trousers off, too.
Toni blinked, "Well, I'll take the roller coaster then."
Steve lifted himself up and quickly squeezed between the girl's legs and pushed two fingers into the hidden slit without mercy. The slippery warmth of the touch seemed to satisfy him. To Natasha, his not so gentle or patient movements caused her long-overdue pain, and she twisted her body twice, only to have his other free hand pinched around her waist and pushed her to him.
"I don't remember anything and I don't know what I used to do, aren't you afraid I'm a killer?"
He pushed deliberately hard against her, taking a long time to withdraw the mass of fabric, accompanied by the girl's sobs, before the man, as if in mercy, shot all his essence into the already red and swollen slit.
Toni turned her head to look out the window, "If they die, it's all my fault."
Tony began to notice that he woke up every morning with nightmares. Every day since then, he could feel the scent of the sleeping incense Tony had prepared for him in his dreams. But he still watched the reactor go out.
Natasha looked at Steve's relaxed smiling face and blinked, "What happened? No one just kissed me, did they?"
Steve carried Natasha back to the bed and circled her tightly in his arms, reaching down to poke the little hole again, "Hold it, don't let it run out, don't waste a drop, there'll be a little baby in here soon."
Noticing Steve's occasional glances back in attention, Toni waved a hand in the direction of the three. "Just regard the wasted time as a price of growing old together."
At that moment someone came up fast from behind and grabbed her, before she subconsciously swung she heard the blonde man's voice from earlier, "Honey, I'm sorry I'm late." Then he kept his grip on her and didn't let her go until the men's voices were barely audible.
A strange sensation swept through Steve's mind and a thought kept him from deliberately thrusting the babe beneath him until he cried out as she usually did. He got up and carried Natasha back to bed and quickly rolled over and went out to get some things and returned.
"I want you, Steve, fuck me, come in."
Within a few moments Natasha felt her whole body sink and asked casually, "I'm so tired, why haven't you come yet?"
Could it be that Natasha didn't love him anymore? The thought flashed through Steve's mind and was hastily called to a halt; the love in Nat's eyes was clearly written and he shouldn't speculate like that. He condemned himself several times with the sense of duty that had been the moral benchmark of the last century, and the doubts he had just dispelled rose again.
Natasha's clothes had been thrown to the floor, while Steve was still fully dressed as if he was going into battle in the next minute.
Natasha soon finished, her artless work looking less like the man in front of her and more like a furry kiwi.
"Nat, I can't stand by and watch you push yourself to the dead end every day anymore, you're going to crush yourself sooner or later. Stop working on your armour! Or, at least, just take a little more time for yourself, okay? Calm yourself down, I'll be waiting for you back in New York, or you can call me when you're ready and I'll come and get you. You know, I'm always there."
He opened one of the first texts and seemed to see the one-eyed cranky Fury ranting at him, "Explain to me what the hell is going on here!" The accompanying picture was a screenshot of a Twitter where the girl wrote nothing but posted a picture of the two at the amusement park, Steve turning his head as if to kiss Toni on the cheek, while Toni had lustful dislike written all over her face and pleasure in her eyes.
"Told you I didn't have a soul mate. But really? Asking that at a time like this? Are you from what, the 40's, and you're just going to have to be a gentleman if you can't get the name right? Why don't you say the name on you too and maybe it'll be me." Natasha was still lying on her back with her hair down, and although there was some mockery in her tone, there was nothing sarcastic in her expression, nor did she look like she had any anger.
Whether Grant was the right man Natasha wouldn't know anymore, but there was no doubt they had met at the wrong time. "Well, I know." Natasha didn't persist in the conversation and again jumped in thought, "You said you were an amateur painter in addition to being a soldier, paint a picture for me."
"Mr. Evans," the owner of the acting company came up with a smile and poked Steve in the back.
Steve sat up and stared straight into Natasha's eyes, "Nat, tell me the truth, what has been going on these last few months?"
"That sucks. Oh, I was just wondering if we could share a ride, I have about ...... eighty bucks here? Where are you going?"
"OK."
When he didn't say anything Toni went back into his arms, "You're too good a person to get involved with someone like me, as soon as tomorrow is over you'll leave and never come to see me again."
"Stop it, please ......"
Phanie was even more dumbfounded, her mouth opened but she couldn't say a word. The prince didn't know if he was being forgiving or narrow-minded, but he just kept talking to Old butler, "I've only been away for half a month, but Jar, you've found such a treasure and you won't even tell me?"
He remembered the technical advisor who had just left Hydra seemed to have something to tell him when he had met the new agent at S.H.I.E.L.D. during the day. He remembered the way he had pinched the tips of the girl's nipples to painful proportions on one side and fingered them quickly in her wet mouth after he had sighed into her belly when he had found out she was pregnant and thought she didn't want to love the child. He remembered, that shield ......
There seems to be nothing suspicious about the explanation, but Captain America's instincts tell him that something is not quite right. If you don't believe him, Natasha will explain it to you. The crowd had no choice but to reply to his suspicions like this.
Everyone has a soul mate. It is said that when a person makes that most crucial decision that affects their life, the name of their soulmate will slowly emerge on a certain patch of skin on their body. But there are still many people who never see their soulmate's name in their lives, perhaps because they made the wrong decision and missed out on their soulmate forever. There are also many more people who, even though they know that name, do not end up with their soul mate. This is so common that almost no one cares that the name on their real partner is not himself/herself.
Another time was in the laboratory where she worked during the day. She was busy adding bugs to the Hydra program when she was unexpectedly wrapped in a warm embrace and turned around to find that her Hydra colleagues had somehow been thrown out of the room. During this time the girl remembered to tell Steve to lock the door, and Steve just laughed and increased the speed and intensity, saying that he had hung his tie on the door handle before he came in, and telling her to scream louder so that no one would dare come in. For a while, this made her not dare to look at the table for days.
Stark is the future. The thought kept haunting Steve's mind as he wandered around SI. Whether it was the Stark Expo when Howard was there all those years ago, or the rapid technological innovations at SI today under Toni's leadership, it struck a chord in his heart even he was not a tech-savvy guy.
"And you really took that woman's crazy talk to heart?" Steve kissed his way down to her forehead, undressing her as he did so. At the end, Natasha was stripped clean and laid on the bed, and Steve quickly stripped himself and jumped on top of her. "You'll believe anything she says? And will you listen to me?"
"But I'm not so stereotypical that I have to have that name. Honestly, if I hadn't gotten my orders to return to the field today, I would have pursued you, Toni. I really would have. It's just that I'm going away again, maybe never able to settle down again, so I can't."
Every day Steve comes to sit in the room where she is recuperating as a symbol of comforting his subordinates, but every time he comes, he is with two of his soldiers standing guard at the door. It made Natasha incredibly anxious, having infiltrated Hydra for nearly half a month without finding a chance to be alone with Steve so that she could put him down and take his blood without attracting suspicion.
Two bars confirmed Steve's quadruple efficiency, and he was so happy that his baby had had their baby that he didn't know what to do but to circle Natasha in his arms and kiss her again and again. Natasha, by contrast, had more mixed emotions; she hadn't expected this day to come so quickly. The moment she got the results, her memory seemed to go blank for a while, and her joy, worry, sadness and anticipation overwhelmed her in turn, before finally turning into a sigh of relief for the old capsicle.
He would even nastily hide the girl under the desk in the bedroom during a video conference while he was fully clothed, revealing only his big dick, which he would slap and poke at the girl's face for a while, smearing her face with wet precum before pushing deep into her soft, warm mouth. No matter how many times she had serviced him like this, Natasha could never get used to the length of his cock at this point. When Steve had had enough of the girl's hard swallowing and admired her long sweaty hair as she sucked hard, he would turn the camera towards the window and lay the girl on her back on the bed, so that her hips would rise high and in one swift movement he would plunge his desire straight into the longingly filled slit and irrigate her deeply. At this point, the people on the other end of the video always looked at each other as they heard the man's low gasps, the girl's overflowing moans, and the clash of flesh.
So the two scribbled away at dawn, each holding a board.
That was when she met the blonde man for the second time.
The first thing Toni heard on this day was Steve saying "Happy Birthday" to her.
"Okay, okay ......" Consider me doing a good deed. "So Miss Stark, what are the specifics of this film contract?"
Knowing he shouldn't have picked this time to go in, Steve took a few steps back as a thought flashed through his mind that he couldn't catch.Pepper left some time later before Steve went to knock on Toni's door. The girl's eyes were a little red, but she smiled again when she saw him, "I blame you for making me distracted and get taught a lesson by Pepper with the heel of her shoes, it hurt so much I had tears in my eyes."
The cut on Steve's wrist from the battle had healed before he sank into the Arctic Ocean with that plane. But that skin had stopped glowing, and the name hadn't had time to fully emerge, with only two initials. n-s. The name that had been forcibly interrupted to emerge was also like his life that had been forcibly interrupted.
During the final round of battlefield patrols, Thor caught a sharp-eyed glimpse of Iron man lifting his face armour and was kissing the captain.
Half a month passes again, while Steve was out of the bedroom during the day, Natasha finally received the news that everything was finished with Bruce. She couldn't wait to remove the changes of her face and at her chest to ask Jarvis where Steve and Red Skull were at the moment. Knowing that they were the only ones in the training ground, it was the perfect time to strike. Natasha tapped her reactor and the nano-armour quickly covered her entire body, taking her out the window.
Steve loved her smile and dropped a kiss on the corner of her mouth and rubbed her little tummy, "Goodnight Toni my baby, goodnight my little baby. " And then he wrapped his arms around her and drifted off to sleep as well.
But this was not the worst of it for Natasha. All she did was talk to a male colleague during the day, and Steve was jealous that he could understand Natasha's astronomical techno-jargon, and that he couldn't get his girl to give him that bright-eyed look. Steve was so possessive that he pinned her down in a warehouse near the man's dormitory at night and took her roughly from behind, pulling her hands behind her back while riding her like a horse to force her to cry out, "Why aren't you so happy when you're talking to me, huh?"
But she showed none of those worries on her face. The girl chirped on his lips and wrapped her arms around his neck, looking into his blue eyes and saying briskly, "If you mean that shield, it's long gone. If you mean something else," she guided his eyes over her naked body, "then I don't mind if you add some new ones for me."
"Why did you bring me to a place like this where kids play?" Toni took off her sunglasses and glared at him, her big brown eyes fluttering.
Natasha was still working on staring at the ceiling when Steve pushed his way through the door. She noticed that Steve had come alone today and had closed the door behind him. She sat up with her arms covered, "Captain." Yeah." Steve answered briefly and then began to question her about the progress of Hydra's latest weapon.
Steve saw the girl move for a while and then seemed to run out of strength, so he shook his head, "Nat aren't you tired? Why don't you let me do it instead?" Natasha hit him on the hand, "It's all because of your son!" She did feel a little weak in the legs and just had to slow down. But she didn't make it easy for Steve to take back her long-lost dominance either, instead, she contracted her soft hole as if her whole body was clinging to Steve's big dick.
"Morgan waited for you all night and still couldn't hold it together to fall asleep first." Tony turned back his head and continued to write and draw on the virtual screen.
She knew that Pepper didn't have the answers she wanted in her head, and calling now would only extend her exile.
"Just call me Steve." Steve held out his hand slowly, thinking about how to turn down the offer. He didn't know why he could meet his teammate, Iron Woman at this not-so-large acting company. During his time away from being Captain America, Steve tried out various jobs using the fake identity S.H.I.E.L.D. had given him to experience this new era. Courier, vigilante, painter ...... just didn't suppose to meet Toni on this experience of being an actor.
With Steve's favourite pussy and throat no longer suitable to serve him, the girl's growing chest leapt to become the man's favourite place to play with. There were times when he would let the girl grab the softness on either side and voluntarily wrap his big dick in the middle, and he would rub himself between her tits, not caring whether the huge head was on her lips or her face, but always ending up with a faceful of cum anyway.
"I've lost my wallet ....... So all I have now is this ticket that's been voided and this crappy phone."
Tony gave him a smile and turned to leave the kitchen. And Steve stood there, thinking back to the morning before he woke up and saw the light of Tony's reactor on his chest go out once more.
The man laughed, "It won't hurt if I kiss it." Then he caught her red lips and chased her tongue.
Natasha heard the dialing before she realised something was wrong and turned around to see that he was dialing Agent 32's number. She immediately tried to get out from under him, lifting her foot to stomp him up again, not expecting Steve had caught her ankle and dragged it back to re-pin her to his cock.
"But I haven't finished it yet. Your eyes are too beautiful for me to paint."
What can I do to convince you that I'm telling the truth? "We're not in a hurry,"
The girl's eyelashes fluttered like butterflies, "Then you tell me."
After a few moments of stalemate, Natasha saw that Steve was determined not to let her go so easily, so she took advantage of the fact that Steve didn't dare to push against her, and with one deft move of her leg on his chest she rolled up and straddled the man's body, "Since you won't serve Iron Woman properly anymore, don't blame me for riding you to tears later."
As they passed a phone booth, Grant stopped to ask if she needed to call a friend or something, and again Natasha gave that look of disinterest, "I only have about two friends, I think, and I don't remember the mobile numbers of any of them."
Toni was about to turn her head to look out the window when the man across her reached out and cupped her cheek, "I hear that couples who kiss at the top of the Ferris wheel will be happy forever." Steve's nice voice faded into a kiss as he leaned over. "Half a round left, five minutes, are you going to say yes straight away or be the whale that ends up being moved to tears?"
Steve didn't believe in the whole soul mate thing at first. One of the biggest reasons was that Peggy Carter's name had never been on anywhere of his skin when Peggy came into his life and he was convinced that Peggy was the love of his life.
Again Tony couldn't stop his smile, "What kind of woman? Not to mention the fact that eight out of ten of my affairs were made up by ladies who had to ruin their reputations to become the Princess, and even if I had liked women like that, I left them all behind the moment I met you! If you're worried that I'm not serious about any of this, then I don't mind saving this," Tony lowered his head and buried it in Phanie's chest and took a deep breath, "for the wedding night."

he reminds himself, but there’s no way he can shake off the feeling that, going away, has in some way betrayed Steve, and that’s what is now gnawing at him.

“I’m not going back yet, I’m just getting started!” he protests, and he’s already lowering his visor once again while figuring out a way to get out of this ship when Quill’s words make him stop abruptly.
, of course – nothing would. Tony stands up now, still flabbergasted by what’s happening, and before he can say it out loud Steve is right in front of him, taking his hand and lead him in a slow motion dance as the piano notes fill the air. This feels so much like a dream and Tony decides to keep the questions for later, allowing himself to be swayed gently along the melody, closing his eyes as he fully breathes in the scent of the other, surprised to notice just how
“Stark,

Not that he fully knows what that is anyway. But he feels he at least

“Hello? Anyone home?” he says again, taking a look around in the living room first and then in the kitchen, finding both empty. “FRIDAY? Can you tell me if there’s a living soul here?”
“Alright, thanks for the heads-up,” he nods, lifting a hand to say bye as he walks away from him.
“Woah, what was that?” Hank’s voice reaches his ears so suddenly that it almost makes him jump out of his skin. He slightly turn to face Ant-Man, now holding a small tool box under his arm.
III. As if pushed by an invisible force, after that night Tony finds himself visiting Steve’s room more regularly, usually once a week; every time, he lies down next to him without touching him, his eyes transfixed on him, trying to absorb every little movement, every breath, every tiny, involuntary twitch: to feel again what once was real, and not just a faulty, sad copy of a long lost time. It’s during one of these visits that his eyes randomly fall upon the calendar on the wall – Steve has never learned to get along with the one in his phone, so he keeps using the traditional method – specifically on a date with a few red circles around it: 31
But before another silent question can take form into his brain, a shiver runs down his whole body as his belt first and his zip then get undone, exposing his nakedness.
), or have visitors, or both, and here he goes, showing up on his doorstep like this after a full ass year of having disappeared. He knocks again when he receives no response, mostly because he feels nervous and awkward just standing there.
“Steve,” he replies automatically, but Mark’s reply sends alarm bells ringing into his head.
, his body reclaiming attention, acting as if it had its own mind. And so he finds himself not only reciprocating the kiss, but holding Mark closer, almost possessively, although he doesn’t understand
Tony stares flabbergasted at the screen. It’s his suit alright, that’s undeniable. Down to the colors and everything. But what is it
Steve thinks instead, in the midst of this new surge of comments.
As he was saying, Pepper is smart. Sometimes even more than him. And he doesn’t want to lie to her, not anymore, he’s tired of it. Truth be told, he’s tired of
When Tony catches up with him, he can’t help a soft sigh that escapes his mouth.
Are the laws of the universe still valid in here? Gravity? Atmosphere? How can he be sure that this is indeed the Soul Stone, and not maybe the afterlife? Sure, Thor has told them about the Valhalla and Hel and all of those other realms plenty of times, but is that when humans go too? Or just pagan gods? And what about people who don’t believe, like himself? Is there anything for them, when they die? Tony is about to scream out loud when a hand catches his elbow, making him stop.
Tony throws her a frugal look, showing the palm of his hand as if that is supposed to mean something to her, then focuses his attention back to him, and this time he returns the sly smile upon Steve’s lips.
But he never finds out what it was actually about, because at that moment a nurse enters the room bringing the news he had been waiting for: all his levels are good, so he can be discharged whenever he wants to. In a couple of seconds, he’s standing on his feet, looking for his clothes, under the other’s gaze.
“So, Captain, now that you’ve slept on it… Do you
“You’re recruiting
What happened to his A.I.? He doesn’t care that much about himself – it’s not the first time he’s hangover and of course it’s not going to be the last – but JARVIS is
“He’s got my name on his.”
“I think we’re in the Soul Stone.”
Okay, so Steve isn’t the only one who’s confused about this whole thing. The thought reassures him a bit for some reason. But there’s more. A detail is gnawing at him ever since he’s heard the victim of the robber: Stark. Why is that name so
“My island…” is the eloquent reply, which doesn’t mean it’s not the truth, it just sounds very weird to say it out loud, and that makes him chuckle.
“Don’t ask me how
“That’s because you’ve never

, although he was, y’know, dead at that point, and he was crying at his bedside. The memory makes him shiver again, but this time the cold has nothing to do with it. “Thanks for the jacket.”
“W-What’s happening…?” comes the mellow, sleep-infused reply, one that Tony can’t hear because his eyes are still shut even though he’s now sitting in a totally upright position.
, because now that the reality of the situation is hitting him, he can feel his mind quickly slipping away, letting his body being in command for once. So just as he’s about to come he places a hand on top of Mark’s head, pushing himself out of his mouth and throwing a quick glance down.
compared to the fancy, old fashioned idea he had come up with. Maybe because they’ve been in this situation before, casually hanging out after a mission or on a day off, taking a walk just as they were devouring junk food, too hungry and exhausted to be bothered to go back to the Tower before putting something in their stomach. So, although they’re not in their suits and their bodies are not aching because of bruises and broken bones, this is familiar enough to be
“Because they are the only ones stupid enough to have us damaged nutjobs.”
“Tony, I-“
“What? That? Oh, come on Steve it was just a game.” He tried to play it off with a wave of his hand and something must have snapped inside of Steve. He lunged forward, catching Tony’s wrist with his own hand, the other one grabbing onto his shoulder, pinning Tony against the wall behind him. Thanks to the serum, Steve was way too fast for Tony to react and too strong for him to get out of the soldier’s grip. Tony could feel the hot breath on his skin, as Steve’s face was just inches from his own.
Even before the Winter Soldier showed up, Steve was always talking about Bucky. About how he had been his only friend, about how they grew up together, about the brief time they spend together in the army.
Now they were gathered around a big conference table in the Avengers Tower, Fury sitting at the head of the table, for the debriefing, which Tony wasn’t really listening to. What he wanted right now was a shower and a weeks’ worth of sleep, and not director Fury talking about how they just got beaten up. He was there, he knew what happened, thank you very much and good night.
Not even a super soldier.
Steve knew he had lost the fight, that there was no way he was going to Romania without her. He also knew that he had gone too far with her and most of all with Tony, but they didn’t know. Didn’t know about his agony, about how guilty he felt about Bucky. He should have kept him safe, just like Bucky had when Steve was young.
And up until now it never had been a problem.
Before either of them had the chance to turn around and leave the door shut behind them.
“Being uptight is.”
Steve wrung his hands nervously. Everything was set up nicely and just perfect but that didn’t mean they would accept it. Accept him.
Steve shook his head. What was he supposed to do with that information? If Tony indeed knew about Steve’s feelings for him, then the lack of action on Tony’s side said all he needed to know. If Tony knew, he evidently didn’t feel the same.
“I know you know.”
“He will get fake eyelashes and wear them as a moustache for the rest of the day.”
As everyone’s smiles dropped, Steve’s face lightened up.
“At least we’ll always have each other.”
“Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.”
For a moment everyone was silent, looking from Steve to Tony.
But it was not fair of him to put this pressure on May. She needed rest and most of all support of those close to her and he’d be damned if he let her down, after all she and Peter had done for him.
“Believe it or not, but even neurosurgeons have to go though all of medical school.” Strange said, putting on a pair of rubber gloves.
The whole time he had reasoned with himself how ridiculous it was to think that, had even asked Rhodey for advice and frankly was lucky not to get hit over the head by him.
“Nothing!” The two of them responded at the same time.
Steve nodded slowly. “Yes. Okay. We leave in an hour.”
Bruce’s face dropped. “I don’t wanna do that!”
“Can we see it?”
Standing in the elevator with his finger hovering over the buttons trying to decide what to do, he actually jumped a little when he heard J.A.R.V.I.S. over the speakers.
“You just ate an unholy amount of food. You nearly choked on marshmallows. How can you possibly be still hungry?!” Nat asked with slight disgust.
He knew that sometimes when Tony was dreaming, he would mumble in his sleep.
“I wouldn’t have any stress if it weren’t for a certain someone,” here she fixed her eyes on Tony again, “behaving like a Baboon high on testosterone!”
“Hey, I’m all with you, why do you think I gave you this? But he was brainwashed for decades and might still not be himself.”
Unable to look her in the eyes, Tony started explaining what happened and who Justin Hammer was. He told her of all the bad deals he had been proven to be involved in and the many, many others, that he could never prove. He told her of his partnership with Obadiah and the suspicion that Hammer had a hand in Tony’s kidnapping three years ago.
“Shut up, Romanoff.”  Tony grumbled and closed his eyes again.
Mumbling to himself, he got up for a refill. It would be easier if he could love Pepper. It would be easier if he could stop staring at Steve.
Steve just nodded, unable to tear his eyes from Tony’s.
“Mmh?” Steve knew that sound. It meant “unless the world is ending, you have coffee, or some other hot stuff to give to me you better walk away quickly”. It made Steve smile every time.
“Yes, ma’am.” The soldier mumbled, Tony just shrugged, but apparently that was enough confirmation for Nat, her scolding expression being replaced by a big grin.
Steve was fighting the urge to leave and just hide in his room again, but instead he sat down on the sofa with them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve?” No reply.
“You told me Steve loves Tony.” Thor repeated in confusion, brushing bagel crumbs off his shirt.
Steve grabbed Bucky’s upper arm, forcing him to turn around. “I can protect you.”
So, they agreed to each go about their own endeavours and meet back at the house at lunch time.
“It is a lot below my paygrade.”
The town was small, and Tony insisted on calling it a village. But it had everything they needed: a few restaurants and shops as well as a bar and even a dance club. The advantage of such a small selection of restaurants was that there was not much arguing about where to eat. Naturally there was still some bickering, but noticeably less than in New York, where it could take them over an hour to decide where to have dinner. Every single movie night proved that.
Natasha flinched ever so slightly at the harsh comeback, earning Steve a death glare from Clint. He knew that Steve knew how sensitive a topic that was for Nat and how much she tried to leave her past in the past. Bringing it up like this in front of everyone was far from okay.
Reluctantly Bruce raised his glass, his eyes downcast “Don’t ask.” He mumbled and drank. Tony made a mental note to ask him about that later, because there was no way in hell that he was not going to find out about the time Bruce had sex in public. By the way the rest of them were grinning, Tony was sure that there were going to be some probing questions from them as well. He almost felt sorry for Bruce. Almost.
And both were bigger than the God that held them.
Finally, she shrugged and her tilted her head slightly to the side. “Well, so did I.”
The god picked the first slip and read, grinning. “Never Have I Ever Gone Skinny Dipping! What is skinny dipping?”
Still mulling over Steve’s behaviour, he turned off the light and laid down in bed. Maybe Cap just had a little too much sun and it fried his brain.
“It was a mighty battle!” He exclaimed, smiling brightly. Tony rolled his eyes so hard, he was sure they would get stuck in his head.
Steve must have noticed Tony’s confused look, because he took a deep breath and shook his head again. “Sorry Tony. I… didn’t sleep well last night.”
“I do not appreciate you playing your games with me, Stark.”
Clint immediately knew what was going on in her mind and was by her side in a second, leaning in close to whisper in her ear. “Don’t. You can take care of Steve later. Thor needs us now.”
And yet.
“Mornin’” His voice sounded way too hoarse, so Tony cleared his throat and tried again. “Morning, Cap. Good run?” He could hear Natasha sniggering next to him.
“But-“
“So, the rules are as follows,” Nat started explaining. “Everyone writes down two things they want to find out if the others have done and put the slips of paper in this lovely hat donated by Clint.”
“And then I proclaimed: Nay you are the chicken!” Thor’s laughter rang through the house again, just as they all walked into the common room.
“I give up. You guys are impossible!”
Looking around the table he realized that even if they didn’t know how he felt and even though he had been a dick, they were with him.
“You Midgardians should be so lucky to see my godly body undressed!”
Bruce had already been up and about for a couple of hours to cook and make sure everything was just perfect. He also made everyone coffee, which was greatly appreciated. Steve watched Tony basically burry his face in the mug inhaling the coffee, and a smile crossed his face. In his opinion Tony was most adorable in the mornings, eyes still mostly closed, grumpy about the sheer existence of the universe, only soothed by either an obscene amount of coffee or well… naked Steve. Preferably both.
“Shut up, Barton.”
“Before you start, yes, I know it was childish of me to hit Hammer, yes, I know it will me a nightmare to sort out, but no, I do not regret it. That slimy son of a bitch deserved it and more if it were up to me. So just safe yourself the “How could you” speech and take me home. Please?”
Steve put down his drawing utensils and nodded softly. “Yeah sure.”
“Oh! Natasha!” He exclaimed, pointing at an ice cream truck.
“I locked you in.” Now it was the super soldier’s turn to look confused, as he turned around to Bruce.
“Then how do you know all this?”
So, he informed Pepper of the situation and without hesitation she hired the best doctor and took care of all the bills, as well as setting up an emergency fund for them and since it was Pepper paying for all of it, Tony technically didn’t break his promise.
“Uhm no. What’s up?”
Hello you wonderful people! I had a pretty bad cought for the last few weeks and some other stuff to take care of but I finally managed to write the second chapter for my little Christmas fic. Even tho it is a little late I hope you enjoy it!
“That’s not the bar you should worry about babe.” Nat mumbled, admiring her new toys.
Tony fixed his eyes on the other man and almost let something slip. Something along the lines of: “Give me thirty minutes alone with you and I show you what kind of feelings I have,” or “How about you put some feeling in me.” But he kept his mouth shut for once and just looked down at his drink.
“Not mine.” He mumbled, looking at the purple fedora with disgust.
The soft rocking of the waves combined with the lack of sleep on Tony’s side and Thor’s emotional exhaustion, made them both fall asleep next to each other on the big bed. At some point during their nap, they must’ve reached out for each other and so when Tony woke up, he had Thor’s arms wrapped tightly around him, imprisoning Tony in a giant bear hug. To be fair it wasn’t the worst or even the weirdest thing Tony had woken up to but holding hands with the Norse God of Thunder definitely made it into his top ten list.
Tony flinched, he had forgotten that Thor was lying next to him. “Nothing.” He looked over at Thor and sighed, upon seeing his sad face. “Ignoring what you accidently told me. That’s a good plan.”
Steve shot Thor a panicked look.
They ended up in a charming little place just by the beach. The menu offered local specialities, at least they thought so because, they still didn’t actually know where they were exactly. Not that it really mattered. What mattered was watching Steve trying to flirt. Natasha knew that he wasn’t as experienced as most people and the fact that he was literally from a different time didn’t really help. Never would she have anticipated how abysmal his flirting really was.
Natasha slowly put her drink down on the table, leaned back on the couch and just stared at Thor. She narrowed her eyes ever so slightly, never blinking, her arms crossed.
“Is it a heart?” Clint asked.
They had landed on a beautiful beach, the deep blue ocean crashing against white sand. In front of them rose a small cliff and on it stood the most amazing house. It consisted of three stories, with a pool on the middle and top floor, both of them surrounded by large sun decks. The few walls of the house were wood but big window fronts dominated the layout, everything was open and spacious and just breathtakingly beautiful. Around the house was nothing but jungle and a narrow path leading up from the beach.
The moment he picked up the needle to stitch up Tony’s cuts, Strange became serious again and a small line between his eyebrows formed in concentration. Maybe it was good that a neurosurgeon was patching him back up, you couldn’t wish for a steadier hand. Observing how Strange’s finger worked on his hand, somehow managed to calm Tony down a little and distract from the blinding pain shooting through his body every time the needle pierced his sensitive skin.
“I have a plan!” Natasha announced to Bruce and Clint, who both groaned in unison.
He had trusted Natasha, for the first time since he got out of the ice, he had really trusted someone. Steve knew she liked to play games and be in control of everything and everyone. He just thought she wouldn’t be like that with him. Guess he was wrong.
A normal day with the Avengers was bizarre, but today had been just a whole other level of weird. And Tony had seen his fair share of bizarre in his time.
That was until one beautiful morning he walked to his shop and saw builders in May’s bakery. The first thing he noticed that the sign above the store no longer read “Aunt May’s” but instead “THRIS-TEA”. Something was wrong. Very wrong.
Bruce smiled happily up at Steve. “You would all starve.” He liked cooking, but he loved making meals for his family. It reminded him of a time before the other guy, when he used to cook with his mother. He liked having a family again.
“Listen, we are in this together if you like it or not. We are a family and if you want to get Bucky back then we will find a way to do that. Together!” Natasha’s tone allowed no room for backtalk. “Now, first we need somewhere to hide him. Ideas?”
Clint beamed up at Thor. “Absolutely!”
There was nowhere to back away to and he couldn’t bring himself to swat away Tony’s hand. The touch, even though born out of pity, still felt good and oh how he craved more.
If anyone had planned on sleeping in on Christmas day, they faced a brutal reality in the form Thor. He had stayed up all night, waiting more or less patiently for sunrise to wake everyone up, so they could open their presents together. So, the moment the sun rose above the New York skyline Thor stormed into everyone’s room to drag them out of bed. The competition for “Person who looked most grumpy about being awake at 7am” was fierce but the runners up were definitely Clint and Tony, who both looked like they were ready to kill as soon as they were awake enough to do so.
They had been called to a mission over three days ago. All they were told at the time was that a group of previously unknown people were attacking New York with glue. Tony had been sure that he just misheard Fury, but as it turned out that was exactly what was going on. A group called “Masters of Evil” had developed a substance they called Adhesive X and until a couple of hours ago there was no known solution for it, so it stuck to everything it touched. The Masters of Evil, actual identities still unknown, covered the whole city in the stuff. There was extensive damage to buildings, the infrastructure and there even have been some casualties. Tony and Bruce had been working on a solution for Adhesive X, while the rest of the Avengers were working on helping the civilians and most importantly keep the Masters from doing anymore damage.
Now, Tony Stark is the king of books. He owned a small bookstore between Queens and Brooklyn just off Forest Park and he loved it. He loved spending his day reading, talking to customers and every day he went across the street to the little bakery, run by a lovely lady called May, or Aunt May as she insisted, he call her. Aunt May made the best pastries Tony had ever tasted.
“You will pay for this, Stark.” Hammer spit out blood in front of Tony’s feet and pushed Peter away from the door to get out. Tony didn’t even have the chance to go after him, blonde guy’s grip tightened around his arms as if he knew what Tony was thinking. Then again it wasn’t that hard to guess.
“What? Oh, shoot sorry! Let me get that.”
“M-maybe we should call an ambulance?” Was that Peter’s voice? God, he sounded so shaken up. Tony could only imagine what it must have looked like for him. He didn’t know Hammer and what kind of monster he was. He just saw the man he worked for attack a random guy and beat the crap out of him.
“Why are we friends with those people?” Clint mumbled, shaking his head.
“Tony, you didn’t tell me you had son.”
Bruce shook his head and took out his book, lying down a bit further down the beach, so not to disturb the men at work. “Nerds.” He mumbled with a grin.
“But no one asked you, Stark.” Clint snapped. Even though his dare was quite harmless, he still seemed very tense, which made Steve wonder what the archer had whispered into Natasha’s ear. She did say something about a quit pro quo. Poor Clint.
Even with Natasha’s and Bruce’s affirmations and promises that yes, they were a family and no, Steve didn’t mean what he said, Thor was still hurt. Too often he had ignored harmful words from people he considered family, just to be betrayed by them. Of course, he knew that Steve wasn’t Loki, but still, the pain burning in his chest was the same. So, instead of enjoying a lazy morning in the sun with Bruce, Nat and Clint, he was lying on the giant bed next to Tony.
Even after the weird couple of days they had, Steve’s feelings about Tony haven’t changed a bit. He still wanted there to be something. He still wanted… Tony.
“Just… just know that I love you and that I’ll… just… here.” He handed Steve the folder, his hands shaking.
“Then I’ll take Sam with me.”
Steve, Sam and Natasha go to Bucharest to get Bucky.
Now it was Steve’s turn to cross his arms and sigh.
Until Steve pushed himself away from Tony, as if repelled by the smaller man.
“What were you thinking?”
“Let’s make it really big!” And off they went to collect all the blankets and pillows in the house, leaving him and Natasha alone in the living room.
Clint knew better than to push her, but his patience wouldn’t be infinite, Natasha was well aware of that. And yet something always held her back from turning this, whatever it was, into something concrete, into something meaningful. And here she was lecturing Steve about getting a move on with Tony. Maybe watching her fiends pining was her punishment for being such a coward.
But even Captain America's patience had a limit. And it was approaching fast.
“Come on man, I hate talking to a door. So unresponsive. Not that that would stop me from talking. You know I can on and on and on forever. And you’re gonna open this door eventually. I could smoke you out with more of my hilarious drunken adventures. For instance, have I told you about the time I accidentally broke into a zoo to free all the meercats? Now you’re probably wondering how one does accidentally break into a zoo-“ Before he could go on the door opened and Tony was faced with a very pissed off looking Captain America.
“Finally. I almost ran out of ideas. Do you think the rom-com DVD collection was a little much, Doctor?”
“Just ignore grandpa, tell us.”
He knew, and yet he didn’t say anything. Did that mean that his feelings weren’t reciprocated? Or did it simply mean that Tony was just as much a chicken as he was?
“Honest?”
Steve’s eyes involuntarily wandered down Tony’s body to his – Nope. Not going there.
“Thirsty.”
"Don't be sorry." He whispered, kissing the side of Tony's head. "I love you."
“Let’s play truth or dare!”
Thor grinned at Steve, who had that far away look on his face he always got when thinking about Tony. “The question you must ask yourself is: Is the happy life you could have greater than the risk of him not loving you as well.”
“And then I asked if him and me should just stay here while you guys go and if he wanted to see how many marshmallows we can fit into our mouths and he said...”
“Fuck off, Barton.”
“I’m sor-“
It wasn’t like he was thinking about something, or someone, in an inappropriate way, that would make him nervous about Natasha knowing.
“Kiss the mighty Hulk. Not Bruce, the Hulk.”
The others nodded in agreement. “This is our family. We found it all on our own. It’s little, and broken, but still good. Yeah, still good.” Nat whispered in his ear. She knew he loved Disney movies and he especially loved “Lilo and Stitch”, for obvious reasons.
“Hey there big guy.”
Tony is panting now, and damn, he feels exhausted as he has never felt before in his whole life. But he can’t stand there waiting for a reply, he just
“Can’t you just tell me?”
Tony thinks, but then a voice inside of him makes him notice how he can’t be sure it’s only been a day and not… what? A week? A month? A
“Say, as rare as it is for me to have something broken, surely it doesn’t require spending a night in a hospital. Adding to this your uncharacteristic lack of words… What’s wrong with me?’
“Hey, Tony… Why do you keep calling me by my first name?” Steve asks after a while, the tiniest smirk on his lips as he turns to look at his companion.
“I don’t think you understand just how busy I—“ he starts, but Fury cuts him off curtly.
“What is it?” he asks, turning around to look at him, but as he does, he finds Steve’s face mere inches away from his own, and before he can even formulate a question, the other’s lips capture his with such willingness that Tony doesn’t even
“You’re kidding,” he says, although he knows all too well that’s not the case, Steve would never joke around on something like this. But he has to hang on to anything in order to keep the beginning of a panic attack at bay.
“What are you guys doing here?”
When the coordinates appear on the display he is confused at first, because they seem to indicate a spot in New Hampshire away from everything else, civilization included. Of course, there’s still the chance there could be a mission happening on the ground, no matter the appearances.
about him – and in the end he loosens up the tie, undoes a couple of buttons and shows Rhodey the tag, smiling awkwardly.
He sees his face harden, his eyes grow darker: “I don’t know. My memories… they’re missing, I think. Something… exploded, but it wasn’t just a bomb, it was something… more powerful. You… You disappeared, just like that, and then… I tried catching one of the Stones when they went flying in every direction, I was following my gut, not thinking straight…” he pauses, forcing his brain to spit out more information, but eventually he shakes his head: “Next thing I know I woke up here.”
Outside it’s started to rain, but he doesn’t even notice as his clothes become damp, his hair soaking wet. The tears that run across his cheeks are undistinguishable from the drops coming from the clouds above. All he can think about is Tony. His body and his smell and his eyes that always seemed to read right through him. His smirks full of tease whenever they were with other people or in public, his genuine and soft smiles that he reserved for him only, in the privacy and safety of their bedroom. It’s time and gestures and moments gone forever, and just because he knows that it doesn’t mean that he’s okay with it, or that it hurts any less. If anything, it’s tearing him from the inside out, driving him to madness at the prospect of never being
A shy smile appears on the stranger’s lips now, and perhaps for lack of an appropriate response, he stretches his hand forward to introduce himself: “I’m Grant.”

of July parade, and the guy pirouettes on himself, taking a couple of steps forward towards the door, expecting it to open promptly. Except it doesn’t happen, because the alarm has triggered a shutdown of the electric grid. Tom tries to push it forcefully instead, but it makes no difference, and he lets out a frustrated whining noise, stating the obvious: “It’s blocked!”
Steve manages to get him, almost instantly, probably without even trying. Tony doesn’t understand how or why this happens – or when it actually started – he just hopes the other will never stop doing it, because he doesn’t think he could do without it now.

There’s another pause, longer this time, so much so that Tony’s focus shifts away from the man in his lab to revert to the calculations still ongoing in his own mind.
“Oh.”
, just as if time was being played with. Unable to look away, Tony finds himself instinctively closing his eyes, and the next thing he knows Steve’s lips find his, sucking his lower one gently inside his, sending all sorts of shivers down his spine. And for a moment – or maybe two, who can really say? – Tony leans into the kiss, almost desperately wanting
Tony is so out of his depth right now that he’s just going with his gut feeling, nothing more. Whilst Jean starts filling up the bag with trembling hands, Tony tries to throw the quickest glance towards the door – he
It only takes ten minutes for Fury to find him in his room; lights out, Steve is lying down on the bed, although not asleep, trying to make sense of everything that’s happened in the last day. There’s a decisive knock on the door which he wants to ignore – and
Silence falls at this point, as they all stand in admiration of the robot in front of their eyes. Before any of them can say or do anything else however, Iron Man surprises them again. This time, it actually

He throws a quick glance at the clock on his desk: almost 10pm, almost time to go. He decides to go over his calculations one last time, but he has barely started that FRIDAY interrupts him, and that’s not
“What’s wrong with that?” the other asks, leaving a kiss through his damp hair and looking down at him.
Iron Man is not an automaton.
“I still think we oughta rethink the plan, use more convincing… means.”
Tony shakes his head and snuffles, having to fight another wave of tears from coming out. There will be no more evenings on the sofa, no more fighting side by side, no more sneaking out in the middle of the night to go sleep in the other’s bed. Steve is gone, and Tony is partially responsible for that, and the guilt is going to eat him alive, he can feel it already.
avoiding the other’s eyes, he can’t help but notice how the only seat available is right next to him.

“Oh, okay, that’s great, Tony! I’m so happy you two have made up…” Rhodey congratulates him, patting his shoulder and smiling enthusiastically at him.
“What are you t—“ Tony starts, but stops the moment his eyes discover the answer to his question. Steve is holding flowers. Roses, to be precise. And not just any kind. They’re the Kazanlashka Rosa variety. Aka, what’s widely recognized as Bulgaria’s national flower. He’s stunned. “... oh.”

“Okay,

Tony doesn’t talk, because that’s not what he does when feelings are involved. Especially when they’re about
“See? You still don’t un—“
When he opens his eyes, the morning after, a streak of light illuminates the small room and the bed whose sheets he seems to have stolen all for himself during the night. He blinks some of the sleepiness away and smiles lazily, hand roaming to find the other’s body, and when it’s not found, he starts pulling himself to a sitting position, frowning slightly, but before he can call his name out, a voice echoes in the room, reassuring him of his presence: “I’m here, don’t worry…”
After that day Tony, to put it mildly, seems to disappear from the face of Earth; he leaves his phone with Happy, writes a quick program for FRIDAY so that she can’t be traced not even by the CIA (or the NATO, or the UN), sends the same email out to Strange, Banner and T’Challa asking gently not to get involved or help anyone who might want to get in touch with him. They all give him their word. With Pepper in charge of the Stark Industries and Steve leading the Avengers the only hole left uncovered is Peter, so before taking himself
They smile at each other, and then, after promising that he will be back in a week time to discuss
“And… Well, it’s hard to explain with words…”
“I wasn’t,” Steve explains, sighing and turning on his back now, “Just processing whatever happened down there. Sometimes you forget that this is all still new to me.”

“I would be lost without you, you know that?”
“Cool. Two hours, Rogers. Wear the clothes on your bed.”
Steve resumes what he calls his ‘daily job’, running the local VA Monday to Friday until 6pm, when he gets back home and shows Tony his neighborhood first and, as the days pass by, pretty much the whole of Brooklyn – the nice parts, that is. As it turns out, both of them are quick walkers, which ables them to cover a lot of ground in a relatively short amount of time. As always, Tony is an eager listener and asks lots of questions, about history and people and politics, and no matter how much Steve tells him, he seems to be able to retain
Tony is about to reply, but all of a sudden his brain seems to be aligning itself and he understands at once what was bothering him. He shoots an angry look at Nick, and when he talks he can barely contain his feelings: “You

“A couple of months…”
“Yeah, well, how else am I supposed to get your attention, Tony? I can’t even remember when was the last time I’ve seen you outside an Avengers mission,” he hits back, deciding to enjoy this all too familiar teasing before they inevitably have to face the seriousness of the situation. “Hell, these days you see
“I’m not good with kids. Plus, I’m gonna be taking a more… international role soon.”
“Fury. ‘See you later’. Tell me you don’t have to go?”

of refusing them. He closes his eyes, blindly puts the flowers down on the counter so he can wrap his hands around Steve’s neck, keeping him close as if afraid he could just disappear under his nose. He returns the kiss, because he could never refuse, but when Steve tries again he lowers his forehead on the tip of the other’s nose, sighing softly and wishing he could just

, he ponders, the image of that strange creature he encountered just a couple of days ago still vivid in his memory.
“Ah-ha, you’re so hilarious, Tony, really…” Steve mocks him, but it’s crystal clear that he’s all too glad (and also a bit relieved) that the other is still interested, although he ignores exactly why.
”Drawing. It’s a hobby of mine. Hope you don’t mind.”
“Pointless for you to think of a plan, boy. You don’t think I don’t recognize that look on your face? Probably never fired a gun before, have ya?” Mr. Field teases him, and of course he’s right, Tony actively
“Yeah, just a sec. I’ve got something for you.” He turns back again, and now there’s a shield in his hands. He gives Steve a soft smile – with maybe the slight hint of embarrassment – as he stretches it forward: “Here. You
the other is holding his breath now, as he’s seen him approaching, and Steve doesn’t understand why, although it scares him a little. His hands close around the cold bars and he sighs deeply with his gaze on the ground, Tony’s scent catching his nostrils and sending familiar vibes throughout his whole body, a peculiar effect that only happens with
“Good afternoon, Mister Stark. How are you feeling?”
“I almost blew my fucking cover!”
“Did you know it could

“Just do the same thing! Jesus, Steve, it’s not rocket science, even for you!” he breaks out at last, although he wishes he hadn’t, because he really wants to help his friend out, Steve deserves to be happy and Tony knows for a fact he’d make an excellent partner, if given the chance to get to that stage.
They arrive at destination about seven minutes later, decisively earlier than if they had kept on walking, although that doesn’t mean the rain doesn’t get them anyway, albeit only marginally.

“That explosion, it shattered all of the Stones. And in order for you to ‘get out’, someone must employ the Soul Stone once again. Hence, if its pieces are scattered…”
“Steve fucking Rogers, ladies and gentlemen…” he moans out loud, hugging himself and staying there until tiredness finally conquers his body. This time, sleep doesn’t wait too long to catch up on him.
, he loves this man so much and had missed him so badly that being in his arms now seems too good to be true. He wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and stays silent, just staring into his eyes as if it’s the first time he’s meeting him, and wonders how the hell he has managed to survive in the past when Steve was missing, or dead, or during any other shitty situation that has happened to them.

“Because that’s exactly how it fucking feels!” he screams now, pushing his hands against the edge of the table and standing up, kicking the chair for good measure; he loosens up his tie, undoes the first button of his shirt and leans against the window, taking a deep breath in order to calm down, already regretting losing his cool in front of them. But the situation has been gnawing at him for months now, and finding himself in a position where he could finally cut his frustration loose, he just couldn’t help but voicing it out loud.
“Let’s go back to you talking about the Avengers, shall we?” he says instead, looking intently at him until their eyes meet. “Your date is listening to you, they’re engrossed and take your hand. You
The unexpected lifeboat comes to him thanks to, ironically enough, his job; on a Monday morning in early March he finds a folder waiting for him on his desk containing a detailed itinerary of a short trip to Brussels, Belgium, in two weeks’ time.
to hear it.
“I’ve been told…” he chuckles, making only a bland attempt to stop the other from hitting him because yeah, he knows he deserves it. Eventually he grabs his hands, holding them down to make his fists stop, gets closer and whispers on his lips: “Does your sorry ass want to spend the night then? Or shall I call the ‘copter again?”
“That goes for you too, pal. Next time you try something, you’ll get the other end of the gun, understood?”
“Like that’s gonna help you…” giggles Steve, letting him go and stretching once alone on the bed. Tony shows him the finger and jumps off the bed, heading to the bathroom to do his business and wash his face, picking up some freezing water from the ice bucket and wetting parts of his body with it, figuring the coldness would chase some of the tiredness away. Before returning to bed, he stops by the minibar and takes out an energy drink, emptying half the can in one go.
is gone too, and Thor has joined the Guardians, and Clint has retired
In front of them, the two women exchange a brief, confused (but also amused) glance, which doesn’t go unnoticed by Tony, tilting his head towards Carol, a question mark flashing into his eyes. But she only shrugs lightly in response, stretching to kiss Jessica’s cheek, and when she talks, it’s like that gesture never happened.
“Are you alright?”
As if hearing those words makes his body realize they’re actually
“In my defense—“
“Three weeks ago you didn’t even know what a laptop was!”
But before he can finish his sentence, Tony closes the gap between them, pulls him closer with an arm and seals their lips together in a slow, longing kiss.
“Sure, after 37 hours and 13 minutes you are…”, Tony snickers in a low tone and the next thing Steve hears is the sound of him getting up. “I’m fetching the Doc, don’t even think of abandoning that bed while I’m gone…”

, he’d remark later to himself. “I’ll leave them here, remind me to get them when we’re back, okay?” he then says, going around the front desk and placing them on the counter, putting in a note in the A.I. system as a second memo. The evening has just begun and he’s already feeling all of his good purposes fading away.
For a brief moment he has no idea that the President is referring to him, because usually
“No you don’t, because he didn’t show that side of him to anyone else but maybe four or five people.”
He stands up, gives a long yawn, stretches his back and arms, trying to regain control over his body. “Okay, I’m good. Let’s go,” he nods, about to leave the aircraft when he remembers something. He stops, holds a finger up as to excuse himself and then heads towards the back of the jet, knowing that Steve is following him.
“That’s exactly what we’d like to do, Mr. Stark.”
“Oh, I thought…” he starts, confused, then stops, swallowing before continuing, “Sorry, why did you come here for, again? I don’t think you actually told me.”
“Hey, sorry for the delay, I definitely underestimated just how

“So where are they now?”
“I present to you, the tenth ring,” he explains, giving him a warm smile as he lifts up the cylinder so that the other can see it better. Steve’s hand stretches towards it to touch it, only before it can a loud whizz erupts inside the room, and time the three of them turn around, a portal appears right in front of their surprised eyes.
– it, Stephen needed to show me something, and I was around the area anyway, so I told him I’d drop by.”
He takes a look around the room to see if there are any cameras recording; it appears to be none, so he’s about to open his mouth and pour his heart out when Steve beats him to it.
“I’m sorry about this…”
– this time there’s a new sort of energy in him that needs to be shared, containing all the words and the feelings he wanted to share back in March but just couldn’t, too surprised by the unexpected proposal and too

As during his previous visit, he sits on the edge of the bed next to Steve, and for the longest time he just stays there, almost watching over him, as if afraid some evil creature could suddenly open a portal in the room and snap him away right under his nose.
– or he would be in an even bigger mess right now. Because of course, there’s brotherly love and everything, but that’s
“I… don’t think I’m following your line of thoughts right now but that was nice…” Tony sighs softly after a few seconds, and even though he doesn’t fully realize this, a smile is flashing all across his face. “Was that it? Can I open my eyes now?”
The sound of the door opening brings him back to the present. He turns on the chair to face the newcomer, a man who he estimates to be as tall as him, albeit less muscular.
at least, or marrying them or do whatever it is that people in long term relationships do, he’s never quite understood that part.
But as it turns out, Tony’s gut or instinct or whatever you want to call it had indeed picked up on some off vibes of sorts, because ten minutes later, when the guy from the morning reaches the counter, he speaks so loudly that Tony himself can hear his words without a problem – something that wouldn’t normally occur, especially with this many people inside.

is certainly worrying to say the least.
he shakes his head, throwing a quick glance around at the rest of the team. They seem to be doing alright, although he can’t say for sure. He doesn’t know them, after all, and it’s behind him how they agreed to do this.
off the radar he randomly pops up outside his school one afternoon wearing black sunglasses and a baseball hat for good measure; he also shaves all of his facial hair off. Peter doesn’t recognize him, and the giant headphones over his ears keep him from hearing his name being called out.

, he reflects) before the other can even say anything. When he does, it’s a stupid question, typical of someone who just can’t believe how lucky they’ve suddenly got.

Let’s face it, I’m not that person, and you deserve

“I’m sor—“ he starts, mostly to not let the silence between them grow out of control, but before he can complete his sentence the other stops him, quite abruptly, a low sigh escaping his imposed self-control.
The mission – although of the diplomatic kind – ends up dragging on for almost ten days, in which they get stuck on the dark side of the moon in the company of Skrulls and Krees, definitely not the type of situation to spur a conversation about dating or relationships, even if they hadn’t had their hands full all the time trying to make the two races agree on a compromise. They’re actually so busy trying to prevent a cosmic war that they barely have time to exchange their usual banters in the morning or right before going to bed, and when they do talk, it’s to discuss strategy (and why exactly they got called in this mess in the first place).
“Leading their normal, ordinary lives. Parker is graduating next year, I’m hearing he has his eyes on the M.I.T.”
It’s supposed to be a joke, Tony
“I know it’s not perfect, I did what I could in the short amount of time I had to put it together…” he mutters, deepening his hands into the trousers’ pockets and looking around, feeling a strange sense of embarrassment surging inside of him. The idea, that had sounded good enough when he first had it, seems quite stupid now, and really, was it necessary?
“Do you know where are they taking him?”
And right then Steve does something that Tony will remember for the rest of his days. He puts both of his hands on his shoulders and looks at him straight into his eyes, giving him several shivers all down the spine.
It’s been two or three weeks since they’ve seen each other in the flesh – oh, how he hates it that he can’t tell for sure how
“Oh, so it’s
“What’s that in your pocket? Is it the mind gem? Why do y—“
because he goes nibbling on his side, giving Tony a pleasant sensation between ticklish and arousal.
Tony recognizes the puzzlement in the other’s eyes before he even speaks, and can’t help but smiling at that.
“I don’t, but…”
But Tony isn’t easy to fool,
Tony is approaching him now, and suddenly his aftershave is everywhere around Steve, who finds himself unable to keep his gaze down any longer.
And now it’s Tony’s turn to be staring in confusion for a short while before spreading his arms: “What do you mean, ‘who’s Steve’? Steve
? Damn, man, are you
Steve looks at him, staying silent for a couple of seconds as trying to figure out how to pull the invisible plug that seems to be feeding the man on his right, and it’s quite ironic to see how their roles seem to be reversed now.
“I can’t believe I’m the one saying this but… Why are you so nervous? I can barely recognize you.”
– and wants to shout that he’s his boyfriend, but right now it doesn’t matter, and he’s quite sure if he was to actually open his mouth nothing would come out. “You!” he hears the same voice again, “unlock the door, now! Or I’ll start shooting randomly!”
, he thinks – Tony tilts his head slightly to the side to catch a look at the new arrived, giving him a welcoming nod.
taught me it’s a very effective way to end a speech – when I remembered this one from Shakespeare,” he swallows, and closes his eyes as reciting it by heart: “When he shall die take him and cut him out into stars and he shall make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.” His cheeks wet and cracked, he has to suppress a new spasm of tears and pain from coming out, so he forces himself to open his eyes, looking at Tony’s picture again as asking for the strength to give yet another in memoriam. “I think that’s perfect for you, my love. I know you’re up there so… look after me, will you? You’re the only one who knows how much I need it. And just how much I miss you. I love you, Tony.”
But the rest of his words get swallowed up by the sirens of the police cars arriving outside and, only a bunch of seconds later, an authoritative voice speaks through a megaphone: “Attention, please. This is the SCPD. You are surrounded. The door is now unlocked, so come out with your hands in the air and nobody will get hurt.”
, and god, how that word makes him feel sick to his stomach. Luckily for him the moment passes without consequences, he repeats the words just the way he’s supposed to and the ordeal moves on to the person next to him;
Ten minutes – and another till – later, Mr. Field collects the bag for the last time and swiftly passes it over his arms to wear it as if it was a weird rucksack before turning to face his accomplish – and the door. Feeling it’s safe for him to do so, Tony follows his movements, and surely enough he finally gets a visual on the man he
he was over
“Great…” he mutters, yawning and looking around even if there’s nothing really to look at. “I gather this is all recent?”
“… He’s gone, you know?” he sighs, rolling his eyes and staying there, arms crossed over his chest.
He doesn’t know where these words have come from, and judging from the expression on Tony’s face, he’s not the only one.

back to the bank because he’s lost track of time during lunch, browsing Amazon first and eBay then to find some sort of micro camera with a live feed he could access using his phone. The idea has come to him all of a sudden, just as he was eating his bagel, overhearing a conversation between two other customers who were discussing pros and cons on getting a similar gadget to monitor their babies once they were born. That had sounded like a solid idea to him, so he’d taken his phone out and started researching them: as it turned out, there were
“You mean whoever is left? Nat and Sam are finishing up training, I don’t know the others, but… We weren’t… exactly expecting you. What are you doing here?” A shadow falls over Tony’s face as hearing this question, and although it lasts only a moment his friend is able to detect it anyway because he gestures for them to go sit down while rewording his question: “I mean… Last I heard from you was what, eight or nine months ago? Then next thing I know you’ve become the new Secretary of Defense and I learn that from the news. How did

It doesn’t take long – that’s what happens when you don’t think about
They wouldn’t, matter of fact, but Steve does, eyes wide open with shock and surprise as witnessing just how
“I’m not paranoid…” Steve interrupts him, complaining, but Tony gives him a meaningful look that shuts him up immediately.

“That was a nice kiss…” he admits eventually, meeting Tony’s glaze and sighing softly, for a moment all of his anger and frustration disappeared from his words.
everything around them was. They’ve just made their way back to the house now, and Steve has gone sitting on the edge of the pool as waiting for Tony to come out of the bathroom, so that’s where he finds him a few minutes later, feet in the water and eyes up to the sky.
Steve, who had been taking a sip of tea during the break of silence, can’t hold the liquid in his mouth as hearing those words and ends up spitting a bit out: “I’m sorry, what did you just say?”
. Because you see, things are complicated and always will be, we’re superheroes, that’s what our lives are
“It’s fine, really, don’t…” he blandly protests, but before he can finish his sentence Steve’s coat is already around his shoulders, and he’s offering Tony his bent arm.

It’s a fair point, and Steve can’t help but nodding. His restless eyes shift again towards Anthony, making him sigh again. He hopes he’s going to live. He
“Did it work?” he asks, voice a bit calmer now that his eyes are on the other.
“Steve.”
“This is worse than Thanos” he pages Steve.
“When’s ‘later’?” he whispers after a while, his hands over Steve’s, still holding him tight.
He takes a deep breath before blinking a couple of times to clear his vision, hand reaching out to take his gun out of its holster.
he thinks – when he reaches the spot the light reflected upon, he notices an opening, big enough for him to fit through.
“But you didn’t, and that’s what matters.”
“What? Did I say something funny?” Steve stops halfway through a sentence, tilting his head in a gesture so cute and soft that Tony has a hard time trying to hide his feelings.
“Sorry, you seem like a nice guy but I need—“
Steve giggles softly, nodding and taking a step back now, as if he had just got back to reality; he looks at Tony, struggling to find something to say, knowing that he

“Yeah, but you wouldn’t have kissed me if we had, you seemed on the verge of throwing up.” Steve remarks as finally calming down; he takes a couple more bites to finish his wrap and walks to the bin to throw away the paper.

He has no idea whether that’s actually true or a pathetic attempt of his mind to keep him from panicking. “Hey, can you hear me?” he repeats, eyes fixed on the screen, and in that moment the jet starts moving again, as if nothing had happened. Uh. Maybe it was just thunder or rain or whatever. He slumps back into the chair, his breathing slightly more regular now, as he fights the urge to call out yet again, because if everything is good and the team picks up on how

But Steve puts his hand on his mouth to keep further words from coming out, staring into Tony’s eyes and shaking his head.
“What do you mean?” Jessica asks him, a quite confused smile on her lips as she turns to Carol as to make sure she heard him correctly.
– so eventually he just shakes his head and admits the truth: “Got it at the flower shop, along with the roses. I thought…” he stops when he realizes he’s giving too much away.
He’s about to reply something witty and sarcastic to try and make Steve smile again – that same expression that he had on his face just half an hour ago – but before he can think of anything they hear a loud, metallic roar, announcing the upcoming helicopter.
Steve giggles softly, already on the balcony, a leg over the barrier, the rest of his body still close to the other’s; Tony lifts up his chin to steal a last kiss from his lips, and then, taking a deep breath and looking into his eyes, he whispers softly: “This is possibly the most selfish thing I could ever say right now, but… I love you, Steve.”

to be in dangerous situations – it’s the fact that he’s about to be walked outside the bank where there’s the whole police department ready to take a shot at the man who’s holding a gun against him. Tony has never been in such a situation, but has seen his share of movies and documentaries about robberies to know this could go very wrong very quickly, and that’s not a chance he’s willing to take.
“That deser—“
“I haven’t either, for all that matters…” Tony sighs on his lips, now wet because Steve is crying too, and it’s only a second later that he realizes he can somewhat

“Why not? You’ve done it before.” Fury replies, and it’s only now that Tony understands they might not be talking about the same thing. After all, why would the man assume anything different than being what, team mates? Friends?
Steve smiles, shakes lightly his head: he can’t believe how
The frown on his face grows deeper as he takes up speed, and he lands in what seems to be an open field around five minutes later. He steps out of the suit and takes a deep breath, the terrestrial air invading his lungs straightaway, making him feel like he’s inhaling for the very first time; polluted as it is, it still feels
“You’re my best friend, of course I did…” sighs Tony, shaking his head as if he couldn’t believe the idiocy of his question.
getting old, uh?” he tries to make a joke, but Tony doesn’t laugh or smirk, causing Steve to sigh more deeply than he intended to because the other is the one person who always acknowledges his (mostly vain) attempts to lighten up the mood, even when they’re not funny. So for him to keep his undecipherable silence, it means that he’s lost into his thoughts, definitely not a good sign. “… Tony?” he hears himself calling the other’s name, those four letters sounding a bit
“Oh, hello, Mr. Stark, John here. Hope I’m not disturbing…”
“I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Stark, but you have an incoming video call.”
“Can I talk to you outside for a sec?”
. I don’t care how long it takes, we can’t just leave him –
He makes a pause, mostly to catch his breath – he seems to have talked until there was no air left in his lungs – and Tony nods encouragingly, still not knowing where this is going but figuring he should have bought Steve a gift too, if only he hadn’t been so damn busy.

Steve looks at him slightly confused, although his smile is more revealing than anything he could ever say right now. He nods, taking it into his hands, weighing it and – Tony can easily guess – marveling at how
But before he can finish his sentence, Mr. Field takes out a .9mm gun from the inside of his jacket and directs it towards Miss Goodwin, who emits a loud shriek of fear and surprise, followed almost immediately by several others once people realize what caused it.

it. His eyes shift on Jean now, to see how she’s doing, and for a brief moment they find each other: she’s trembling like a leaf, silently begging him to take action, and it’s only now that an idea comes to his mind, so obvious and simple that he can’t believe he hadn’t realized this is the only reasonable thing to do. The bank is connected to the police station via an alarm: underneath every counter there’s a tiny button that the cashiers can press without arising any suspicion to send the robbery signal over to both cars and headquarters. If he wasn’t being held at gunpoint, Tony would shake his head and hit his own head at his dumbness, but that will have to wait. Right now, he needs to communicate his plan to Jean without using words, just by silently hinting at the button with his glance, hoping she will be perceptive as he knows she is under ordinary circumstances.
“… I really need to be alone right now, Rogers.
“This is… beautiful, and totally unnecessary, Tony,” eventually the reply comes, “It was my pleasure. I… I don’t know, you probably guessed it already, but I don’t have many friends. My best pal, he… he died in Afghanistan. In the same attack that should have killed me too, but didn’t. I… I’ve felt lost ever since, I suppose. But the last few weeks… it’s been real nice having you around, and I’m sorry if I made things awkward, I… I just don’t know what got into me.”
“What… Is that a
“I told you, I’m not a captain anymore. And I’m done with the Army too,” he hits back, trying to ignore the fact that his current occupation is known to the other.
In less than a second Steve is bent over him, kissing his face listlessly, holding his head between his two hands.
“Hey Mr. Stark, nice to hear from you. How is it going? Anything I should be worrying about?”
, he curses himself, because normally he manages to hold it together for a few minutes at least, but alas, today is not a normal day. He puts the flowers down – the whole area around the monument is submerged with them (so much so that it’s always half a mission for him to make his way through without stumping on any), but there’s a vase just on the right side of the picture, and that’s his designated spot, nobody ever dares to touch it – looks up at the statue and sighs deeply, the chilly breeze lashing his face with a physical pain that is a welcomed change from the constant, invisible one in his heart. He sits down on the step, lies against the icy stone, and stays silent for a few seconds longer before eventually finding the guts to talk.

Steve doesn’t believe when he hears it, although he can’t quite explain why. It just seems like a dream. Why nobody has ever found Iron Man, if it was in here the whole time? Surely Stark or even Namor were looking for it. Also, how can it be still in one piece, after all these years? The dossier he read said that the suit was made of metal – only a small percentage of it actual iron, oddly enough – so it stands to reason that after seven decades in the water it would be falling apart and rusty if not completely in ruin. And yet, as Janet opens up a passage for them to reach this secret spot and his eyes actually lands on the suit, Steve has to admit that except for a bit of wild seaweed and a few spots here and there, the Iron Man looks like it’s been here for just a week or so. Which doesn’t make any sense. But then again, Steve is quickly realizing that there’s a whole world of stuff he didn’t know of before, most of which escapes any logic.
And I know you don’t want to hear this, but Tony… you
it’s been since he actually said anything out loud. And to think he used to be something short of a garrulous… funny how things change. The other man grumps and shuffles his feet underneath the duvet, but he doesn’t wake up, so Tony calls his name again.
“You’re lucky though because you’re cute and silent. Usually with the muscular types is all a ‘me, me, me’, but I bet I’d have to pull every single word out of you or you just wouldn’t offer.”
go, and, because he’s never been good with goodbyes, he figures it’s better for both of them if he tries to slip away unnoticed, saving the heartbreaking moment to actually have to say the words out loud. He waits for a few minutes more –
It’s 6:50 when he hears a knock on the door, which prompts a shake of his head as he grabs his shirt and wears it, buttoning it almost all the way up and leaving the top two holes undone.
he considers in his own mind, definitely not a fan as he witnesses this happening. Steve himself seems a bit taken aback from this question, as if he wasn’t expecting it.
about it whereas he should have just spitted it out when he still had the chance, when Steve wasn’t…
Well, it’s not hypothetical anymore.
a fan.”
he thinks, and although he has considered a similar scenario, hearing it out loud in a room full of strangers gives him goosebumps. He stays silent for a while, trying to come up with a strategy of sorts, but eventually he nods: “It can be done, but I’m going to need Dr. Banner’s help, if I manage to track him down.”
What is going on? Something involving getting medical assistance for sure, and well, the fragmented message is indication enough that the jet has been hit by more than just mere lightning. Or at least that’s what his brain is telling him.
The head physician comes running towards him straightaway, and Tony realizes that the machine must be connected to a computer in the doctors’ lounge.
, for lack of a better term. Doctor Pym and his wife Janet can shrink to insect-dimension, Dr. Banner turns into some sort of gigantic raging bull and Thor… well, he’s actually a semi-god, if you can believe that – Steve doesn’t, but has decided to go with the title as it seems incredibly fitting. They also have what he refers to as ‘nicknames’ – Ant-Man, Wasp and Hulk – to protect their identities, and Steve can’t help but thinking this all sounds like the superheroes he used to read about in comic books growing up. They’ve been trying to get him one too, and because he’s kept turning them down, they just call him ‘Cap’, which he doesn’t mind too much, although he still feels weird hearing it out loud, especially when they’re in the middle of a training exercise. The first couple of times he actually started laughing, and had to remind himself that this was his workplace now, he needed to be
Tony nods and looks around, trying to think about what to say next, but soon enough his mind notices how
“What? Why would you even think of that…” the other sighs, letting Tony’s hands go and sitting next to him with his legs crossed between continuing: “It’s not a condom. It’s… Well, I should really say something first, okay?”

of their actions (although, for a reason or another, it was easier for him to side with Steve’s view of the world rather than with Ross’s).
“I do.”
“What’s… ‘here’, exactly?” he asks, even if it’s a stupid question that gets treated as such, because he receives no answer. Sam and Bucky just get out of the car instead, and his oldest friend opens the door for him. Steve gives him a look between exasperated and resigned.
“C’mon, you have to admit it’s a cute idea.”
“Precisely…” he sighs, passing a hand over his face in a gesture that he’s recently learned to use when he’s struggling with frustration; then he smiles at Steve, pecking softly his lips before taking his hand: “Let me show you around, c’mon…”

for a myriad of reasons – there’s bound to be cameras pointed at the cell, not to mention guards and other potential eyewitnesses – he finds himself slipping a hand across the bars to grab the hem of Tony’s shirt, using it to pull him even closer, pressing his lips against the other’s for just a fraction of a second before letting them go. But it’s enough for Tony’s breath to reach his nostrils, the mix of pine and eucalyptus – his signature perfume in wintertime – sending a pleasant shiver down his spine.

“Okay, well, merry Christmas…” he wishes to his lab, deciding he’s allowed to feel sorry for himself right now, he’s like a fallen resistance leader or something along those lines who used to be surrounded by people who enjoyed his company, but who now spends his days alone trying to understand where it all went wrong. Except, Tony knows perfectly
“Is he gonna be alright?”
“He’s not here.” he sighs, slightly annoyed, and Tony can’t be upset with him because he’s fully aware of just how
“I’m dead, Steve…”
“Of course. As I said, your best man will see to it. Fear not.”

“You mistake me, Stark. I am not the one keeping you here. It’s the

“… Oh. Well, that’s great, thanks, Tony,” the other mumbles, clearly not expecting – or even
“That doesn’t mean I’d never do it either, though,” he replies between his teeth although he wasn’t planning on being vocal. And he surprises himself when he hears how
Both of them stare at their surroundings, probably to avoid saying other stuff they might later regret; but it’s a lost battle, because surely enough, Steve pretty soon follows up with the question Tony was dreading to hear – one that has no reply he wants to share out loud: “Tony, where are we?”
Curious if that’s the case. He always thought either his own being would completely cease to exist, or that it would perennially fluctuate in the ether, as if it was a really high frequency sound, imperceptible to humans but there nevertheless. But this… he doesn’t quite know how to explain it, because it’s like he still
“Hm? What do you mean? That’s its name.”
“It’s a yes, you dummy…” he replies, swallowing and moving his waist under the other’s body in anticipation. But Steve ignores the hint and stretches to grab the box off the floor, taking its content out and sitting on his legs to keep Tony still.
Tony ends the call and leaves the phone on the table, heading to the bathroom and opening the jet for the shower; just as he steps inside the hub, a notification pops up on his laptop informing him that he has just become the new owner of Baccus Island.
Them being who they are – both stubborn, both largely incapable of separating their feelings from the moment, to take a step back and realize that they should actually be
But before Steve can find that out, a nurse the size of a footballer enters the room, her eyes dilated with indignation and incredulity.
“Much better. And you’ll see, it suits my personality too. Just wait till I get some coffee in me…”
Tony snickers at that, then looks down and can’t keep a tiny smile from popping up on his lips as sharing the news: “So, I’m… engaged again, it appears…” he mumbles, feeling like an idiot and a half just as he says this, because although a couple of weeks have gone by, this is still the first time his mouth has pronounced that word out loud.
But he can’t finish his thought because the door opens and, sure enough, Steve’s face peeks out, his eyes doubling in size as they land on Tony, and he can see Steve fighting against a smile that wants to spread on his lips. For a couple of seconds neither of them is able to speak a word or even just make a move, and the whole scene looks surreal, as if they were kids rehearsing their school play for the very first time. Steve hasn’t changed – not surprisingly, although it still amazes him every time – and Tony can’t help but wondering if his own face has, on the other had. He was so busy making recordings and writing down his thoughts that he completely forgot about basic things like checking his appearance (or his body) to see if his special adventure had left any noticeable mark on him.
“Don’t worry, Cap, I’ve seen my good share of weirdness. You don’t get to work for SHIELD and still expect everything to make sense.”
Fueled by the knowledge that things seem to finally be picking up, Tony spends the following two weeks busying himself with copying as many files and memos that happen to be in open violation of domestic and international laws as he sets his eyes on; still not having been able to figure out a way to smuggle his glasses in, he ends up doing it all manually, a task that often requires hours to end, and that makes him fall asleep on his desk before he has the chance to leave the office or to even get some food down his throat. The only time he actually manages to go home is the evening before his flight, and he forces himself to do it just to give FRIDAY a chance to digitalize every single paper so he doesn’t have to carry around a very suspicious (and very heavy) pile of papers along. Once on the private jet, his plan involves going over the actual subject of the NATO meeting, something that he has not had the chance to even glance at since it was deposited on his desk. He opens the folder and starts reading, but before he gets to the bottom of the very first page, his eyes fall shut and sleep finally catches up to him.

“Maybe not force, just… something else. I don’t know, organized protests. Like, constantly. I think the main problem is that the public is just not engaged anymore. A lot of people have stopped reading newspapers about a decade ago. And anything on TV nowadays is just a matching scream between any two opposite sides.”
Steve Rogers? With sushi? In front of other people? He can feel two sets of eyes looking curiously at him, so he clears his throat and takes advantage of the moment to quickly take his long anticipated nigiri to his mouth, mostly so he can have the time to formulate a response of sorts.
“But she did!”
“See, it’s not that hard, Captain. You can manage from here,” he says eventually, giving him a pat on his shoulder before concentrating on the food in front of him, wondering what the hell did just get into him.
“And I thought you had taken all of my advices…” he sucks in a deep breath, shaking his head, hands on hips for dramatic effect, once again trying to guess the correct course of action.
when Thanos showed up at the compound – and as long as goodbyes go, all he does is scribbling a note thanking Bruce for his hospitality, again promising to keep in touch. He leaves it on the kitchen table and silently steps outside the apartment – the last thing he wants is for him and Thor to wake up and make a big scene out of it. He’s not going anywhere after all, not by the standards they’re used to nowadays anyway. Plus it seems to him all they’ve been doing recently is saying goodbye, and he’s grown really tired of them.
“Yes?”
“Hey, Mr. Secretary…” Fury greets him, standing up and extending his hand towards him.
They order a sharing platter for four, mostly because, as it turns out, Steve has never been to a ‘sushi only’ kind of restaurant, and he has no idea what 99% of the items are (it becomes quickly clear as he leans over to Tony and asks the explanation of three different kinds in less than a minute). The conversation, much to both Carol and his surprise, moves to baseball, and for the first time since they’ve entered the place, Steve seems to relax and let himself go as he begins discussing the latest Yankees game with Jessica, who is also a fan. As seeing his companion more at ease, Tony lets a small sigh of relief go, winking at Carol, who smiles back at him as if they were sharing a secret. Unusual for him, he decides to stay quiet and just throws discreet glances to Steve every now and then, taking sips out of his iced almond matcha latte to give the other the time to calm his nerves down before he moves to the ‘dating’ part of the evening. He’s decided on their way here that he would avoid any form of physical touch, not in front of their friends anyway, to keep Steve from totally flipping out on him, something that he’s quite positive would happen. Nevertheless, it’s kind of hard for him to do this, as although this is as fake as it can be, his mind keeps reminding him that it’s a date nevertheless, and once that idea is in his mind, his body strives to treat it as such.
, that’s what he should answer, along with a list of reasons as to why that’s about the stupidest idea he’s ever heard the other coming up with.
“Okay, sir, but why—“
His first stop is Tony’s quarters (calling them simply rooms would be highly inaccurate, given their size), but after knocking on the door for a good ten minutes, he assumes he’s either not in there, or very deeply asleep. So he finds with Jarvis, who, very unhelpfully, tells him that “Master Stark left very late last night and hasn’t been back yet”. Finally, he tries asking the others whether they have any idea where Tony could be, but unsurprisingly, nobody does. The man is very good at keeping his private business completely separate.
“Everything hurts…” he can’t help but being honest, and he hates himself for it. It’s like the words came out of his mouth without his consent. Steve frowns, and his eyes betray a look of fear Tony had never seen before. And that scares him more than anything else. “I… don’t know why I said that.” he mumbles in an apologetic tone that he himself doesn’t recognize.
other than just staring at him; Steve, who, to his defense, hasn’t been on a proper date in a
That manages to put an end to Steve’s rambling at last. He turns to look at him, flabbergasted, and for a couple of moments Tony has the vague feeling that he’s about to get hit in the face.
“Hey old man… You gave everyone quite the scare out there…” he replies, his lips still against Steve’s hand, as if keeping it there would actually help things to get better, his wounds to heal.
“That’s a yes to the date, then.”
“Yeah, I haven’t been back long, just over ten days or so.” he replies, feeling somewhat proud that he had managed to not let his position known to the government: it meant his security system was still top notch in the country.
I mean, because I know for a fact you do like me as a

voices that interrupt him.
A shiver slowly runs down his spine, and for a second his worries are as far away as possible, as he realizes just how
– but smile and go on, okay?”
“It’s not my fault you’ve become a farmer while I was away!” he screams back, and then lifts his head to see just how long until they can speak normally again – not that he really cares, but it’s a good direction to look when you don’t know on what to focus your glance.
do this. This is too much. “He can’t… stay here. I’ll make arrangements. I’ll let you know as soon as I have a plan. In the meantime… four agents will guard the room, nobody in or out except for you. As of now, this whole building is in lockdown. All of the other patients’ visits are suspended for the time being. I hope you understand.”
Good thing I blasted them in the same direction…,
He can feel his attention slip away already.
“Donate them to charities or something, I don’t care, I trust your judgment…”
A couple of seconds of silence before her flabbergasted voice replies: “Steve… You really need to see this.”
Grey tells him the number, and it’s indeed way beyond his expectations. Of course, he’ll have to talk to Pepper and see the numbers of the stocks and the Industries, but he can’t pull out, not now, so he’ll have to come up with a way to make it happen, one way or the other.
and never bothered to change the style. Steve leads it to the living room – which features the stuffed head of a buffalo for good measure – and invites him to take a seat on the couch, filling up a glass with what could well be iced lemon tea before handing it over. Tony takes the glass, looks at the yellowy liquid with a mix of bewilderment and amusement for a couple of moments before raising his eyes on Steve, who is now sitting on the armchair next to him, holding a glass himself.
“I swear, you can be so blind at times, Cap…” he says out loud, sighing in defeat before moving on: “We’re meeting them at the restaurant in two hours. Go have a shower,” he warns him for good measure, and he’s about to walk away when Steve stops him, putting a hand on his arm.
“So, um, where are you going with this, Rogers? I’ve got a few parties waiting for me in Manhattan…” he pretends to be serious, knowing that the other is aware of his game anyway, but that doesn’t make it any less fun to play.
“Look, this d—“ he starts, and this time it’s not one, but
He’s almost jogging now, and to an outsider the scene would seem comical to say the least: a guy in an armored suit carrying five heavy boxes in one hand while walking so fast he could be a marathoner.
“Good. Now tell your girlfriend here to give me
“Steve, I don’t think that’s what Jessica was referring to…”
“Anthony. But I have the feeling you knew that already. I’m not military, by the way. No offense, but I really dislike the Army.”
“So, um…”
“I think you’ll have to be more
“You ready?” Steve asks him, just like that, the words hard and tight between his lips.

. But most of all he hates himself, for not being enough.
“Tony… What if someone sees us? I told you, I don’t know if there’s anyone around…”
He’s right, of course he is, no matter of much Tony doesn’t want him to be. But instead of just giving up, a sly smile appears on his lips now.
“You’re rambling. Ask me a question, come on.”
“Steve?” he says tentatively, and when there’s no reply his instincts click in and make him jump out of the bed to hurry to the door. He unlocks it and starts screaming, a desperate howl echoing in the empty hallway: “Help! Someone help!”
“Said it’s not safe. Like if we weren’t going on a dangerous mission. Whatever. Guess I’m going to sleep instead.”
to your questions.”
“That molecule we were talking about yesterday. I think I’ve figured out its atomic configuration.”
He lifts up a hand as goodbye and stays there, watching Steve getting onboard and then the helicopter as it lifts off, raising a grey cloud of dust that goes straight into his lungs. He doesn’t move until it’s completely out of sight, not even a small dot in the sky; then he takes a deep breath as he gets walking, wanting so desperately to focus on Steve, and the personal stuff they talked about, and their kisses –
“I mis—“ Steve starts, but before he can say more the loudest bang announces the explosion that blows all of the tents away, and throws both of them against hard rocks. If Tony wasn’t a genius and hadn’t figured out nanotechnology in just a couple of weeks, he would have been lying down senseless right now, struggling for his life. But as it happens, in the couple of seconds that pass between the explosion and his body hitting ground again, his latest suit engulfs his whole body, protecting all his vital organs. The hit he takes still hurts as hell, but at least there’s no significant damage.
what I do!” Steve protests, and by his tone you can tell just how glad he is that they’ve overcome the bit of a slump they’d found themselves stuck into.
Being still unaware of what is actually wrong with him, besides the broken arm, Steve decides to answer the question by looking to the plus side: “Better than earlier.”
“Steve…”
“Wow. And I thought
For his part, Tony is still negatively amazed by what his ears have just heard. Marriage. Like if that was something that people still valued nowadays, and not just a decision taken on the spur of a moment and regretted for years afterwards.
is what he would like to say, because although he
What follows is, to put it mildly, the weirdest and most nonsensical recap that Steve has ever witnessed. It starts relatively normal – something about a robbery, although according to the slide only one thing was removed from the premises, a little container which resembles more a treasure chest than an ordinary box – but once they get to the fourth slide, things take a turn for the illogical pretty quickly.  Steve barely has the time to process a bit of information that a new, more puzzling one gets deposited on him. He can’t even venture a look around the table to spot the others’ reaction for fear he’s going to miss out on something.
Nose almost touching the paper he’s scribbling on, Tony is so deep into his thoughts and calculations that even if the radio is on, he doesn’t really hear the music coming from it, the sound less than a background detail in his mind. It’s December 1944, and the last couple of years have given him a few strands of grey into his hair and some wrinkles across his forehead, but overall Tony hasn’t changed at all despite the harshness he’s experienced since the military has taken over his life.
“Well, uh… this is really… unexpected. I’m sure you understand, I’ll have to report back to the President, see what he thinks…”
The voice that suddenly resonates in the room – following the echo of the door being shut with a bit too eagerness – sounds kind of familiar, but there’s a depth and strength to it which are completely new, so much Tony believes his first impression was wrong, he doesn’t actually know it
They stop in front of Steve’s room, and the doctor steps in front of him, giving a deep and penetrating stare that makes the whole of Tony’s body grow limp in a second, so much so that he has to lean a hand against the wall to stay on his feet.
Tony falls silent, mulling over this new development. He doesn’t particularly think he’s the best person for the job, but he wonders who else is on Fury’s list. Clint? Scott Lang? For some reason he doesn’t think so. Maybe the very reason why they wouldn’t be up for this job is exactly because they’re parents –
“Woah, calm down, it’s not like I was actually
“I’d say a solid 2.5, maybe even 3. Definitely can improve on it, but the sentiment was good. You should try and work more... details into it. Like, no classified information or anything of that sort, but the personal kind. Bucky or your mum, for example.” he hurries to add, as he could already read in the other’s glance some alarm bell (“
“So, to recap,” the guy named Hank says as soon as the lights are on again, “Howard Stark somehow got ahead of these – rings, you called them? – at one point

“I hate you, but man, am I happy to see you…” he sighs, leaning over to steal a soft, innocent kiss.
Just as he’s weighing the chances of that decision, the door slides open and Fury enters the room, followed a couple of steps behind by a totally healthy, all in one piece Steve; out of habit – hanging around the President of the United States does that to you – Tony jumps on his feet as he sees them, but, surprisingly enough, his eyes don’t go looking for Steve’s as he had figured it would happen but focus immediately on Fury’s, and the predominant feeling inside of him now is not relief or joy, but pure, raging anger.
In the midst of these thoughts, Tony falls asleep.
“Okay, well, once that’s sorted you’ll be able to visit the compound more frequently, won’t you?”
He sighs deeply, taking his face into his hands for a short while before looking up at Fury again: “How do we do this?”
be found his level of paranoia is skyrocketing to the stars. When he eventually arrives to Steve’s farm – how stupid that sounds into his head – he takes a good look around and waits about five minutes before stepping outside the vehicle and quickly reaching the front door.
. New England, right?”
one, in his heart.
They say things can either look much brighter or much darker in the middle of the night, when it seems like nobody else is awake – although of course that’s not true, it could never be – when every little thought or feeling you have is naturally amplified by the darkness and the quiet outside, even if you’re in a city, a place that doesn’t know what stillness really means. As Steve lets himself go on the spot on the mattress next to him, slightly out of breath and sweaty, immediately pulling his body towards him, Tony can’t help but thinking that statement is actually true, because although he’s had many nights stained with alcohol, violence, self-hatred and pain, there are an equal number of them when he has felt so totally at peace with himself and with the world outside – when he’s building something or having some sort of breakthrough, or as he lies awake in his lover’s arms in the aftermath of their love – that he would rather take his chances with this part of the day than sleeping through it. As they lie next to each other, silent, catching their breaths while their bodies relax, Tony can sense the exhaustion starting to creep up on him, making his eyelids heavy and his eyes tired, so he forces himself to speak, murmuring softly.
, he thinks as he waits outside the campaign manager’s office, located on the second floor in the West Wing of the White House; for someone who is quite used to put on a mask and hide his true feelings, Tony is highly uncomfortable sitting there, feeling like that time he got sent to the principal’s office in boarding school after he had demonstrated to his peers the inaccuracy of what their teacher was trying to say (apparently that was categorized as ‘ridiculing’, although he couldn’t exactly understand why at that point). He’s left his pager in his car, thinking it was not prudent enough to carry it straight into enemy’s territory, and maybe that’s partly why he keeps looking edgily around the room, tapping his heel on the floor, trying to keep his mind occupied with any kind of thought which doesn’t involve Steve in a way or the other.
“What is this, bad cop, good cop? What is really going on? If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you guys are Axies, but the way y’all speak… that’s American alright. Especially
; because sometimes when you’re busy or apart or both the last thing you want to do to yourself is dwelling in what you don’t have, and that’s maybe the most painful part of it, having to choose between the less of two evils, knowing it’s a losing game for you anyway.
“That’s fine, thank you anyway. Could you… give him a message from me next time you get the chance?” he asks, as following a sudden idea that has just popped into his mind. He doesn’t even know if it could work, but at least he
“How do you even—“
Steve looks down at his mouth, sighing softly while pondering that question over, but eventually he has to shake his head in defeat: “Jokes aside, I do think we ought to be careful, Tony. I don’t know how much… caught up you are with the domestic situation but it’s not looking too good.”
“Steve?” he calls, although his brain already knows that the other is asleep, or worse. Still, he can’t help himself. “See, this is what happens when you guys shut me out…” he offers, shaking his head as looking at Steve, seemingly peaceful in his stillness.
. It might be short of a miracle – I certainly can’t explain it – but you’re perfectly fine, despite all that time down that cave. No long-lasting effects. Your body temperature should regulate itself within the next twenty-four hours, and after that it will only be a matter of physical rehabilitation. Getting your muscles to move again. Considering your age and health, I’d expect you to get back on your feet within a matter of weeks.”
, so why now it seems he just can’t
“Come on, dance with me.” Tony invites him, knowing all too well what the other is thinking but dead set about ignoring it all the same.
“No, it’s not that, although it does make for quite a nice show…” Steve shakes his head, big smile on his lips, “I was just wondering about something, and then I thought you’d be the best person to ask. Which is funny because, it kind of involves
“You’ve been so… distracted since you got back from space, and although I appreciate you taking the time to get us here, I believe you’re avoiding facing reality rather than wanting to be on holiday with me.”

he reflects, and somehow he finds this description to be fitting enough. He tries to access his memories, to find any trace that could help him decipher this mystery, but it’s no use. His mind feels blank as a USB stick after being restored. And before he knows it, he’s out once again.
“What, does he want to put us in jail
He has no idea what to make of whatever is going on, so he nods vaguely and pulls himself up, leaning back against the headboard and looking at his companion with a half amused, half puzzled expression: “Sure…”
As he stares into the deep blue eyes in front of him, Tony is speechless, and the only thing he can think of doing, is to lean over and…

“Do you wan—“
“Steve…” he mumbles now, his voice betraying a sting of panic he really doesn’t like as he heads out of the infirmary and stumbles towards the other’s room as fast as he can. Because although Steve is probably fine, those guys seemed to have some super powers of their own, and Tony hates that he went k.o. so
“Seems like we have something else in common now…” replies the other, looking down but not hiding a small smile from his lips.

“Do you… want to go on another fake date? I feel a last one is all I need, just to… you know, apply your teachings to practice and see if I got them right. I promise I’ll do my best. What do you say?”
Tony does, still quite puzzled at this whole scene, and can’t help a quiet snicker from escaping his lips as seeing the mistletoe.

. Good speech though.”
plan S
the truth, he waits a few more seconds to give him the chance of coming clear. When that doesn’t happen, Tony reluctantly stands up again – the headache as piercing as ever – and reduces the distance between them, leaning a hand on the door both to close it and to steady himself. Something in the way he does this must seem particularly desperate to Steve, because this time he doesn’t put up a fight about it nor tries to get Tony out of his room.
“What, you thought you were being subtle?”
“A-Ant— Anthon—hony…” he replies, putting all of the energy he’s got left into that word, because once he’s spilled it out consciousness slips away from him.
, I was just saying, hypothetically…” rebukes Steve, quite taken aback by that strong reaction, his eyes wandering around without stopping on a specific object.
His friend is right, of course he is. Still.
“What for?” again with the awkward giggle, “It’s not like
“You jerk…” he mutters, leaning a closed fist on his wet chest to softly pushing him away, narrowing his eyes at him. “How long have you been… back?”
“Really, it’s all good. We’re good.”
would be to go so openly against a ruling from the Supreme Court, no matter what the circumstances. There’s a tiresome back and forth for a while in which he takes no part whatsoever, believing that his best strategy is to actually give off the idea he couldn’t care less about the whole issue, before the man in charge eventually has enough with being so defiantly challenged and claims that it’s going to get done, no matter what.
was there all along. As his eyes meet the azure ones, he can’t help but giving him a frail smile that the other doesn’t reciprocate, knowing all too well it would be a hazard were they to be seen.
“Yeah, that’s pretty much the plan,” Fury confirms as replying to the four sets of eyes immediately turning towards him. “But first, we need to find the tenth ring before Loki does. That’s the only way we’d have a chance to succeed. And we don’t have much time before he realizes he’s missing one.”
“Positive, I just double checked. What shall we do?”
“Except we did, years ago, before it all went to shit. I know you remember it. We were in this same room—”
, he wonders, and in the comms: “Hey, I’ve got something here. Suit up and follow me, I’m going in.”
“How the hell…” he starts, but before he can complete his rhetoric question, the door slides open and Steve walks inside, a little awkwardly but determined nevertheless.
“The truth, sir?”
forgot anything in the whole time he’s known him). He picks up his phone, starts rummaging through the apps until he finds the prototype of one he’s been working on, some sort of tracking signal for the active members of the team, remembering how the other had volunteered to try it out. But just as he’s launching it, a voice prompts him to lift up his glance from the phone.
But it only gets worse, because now Steve is stretching a hand forward, taking Tony’s into his, and closing the remaining gap between them.
, he tells himself – mostly because he keeps a list of reasons in support of his statement – he just… feels okay as long as he keeps certain thoughts out of his mind. It takes a few, long weeks but eventually a global compromise is reached to reintegrate the finances and belongings of the snapped population back in place, and although extremely slowly, things go back to normal. Sam gets his apartment in D.C. back, and insists Steve moves in with Bucky and him. He doesn’t want to – he’s happy as he can be about his two best friends, however being around them all the time hits too close to
to words of advice coming from strangers (and rarely from people he actually knows, but this is another story). His hand is already reaching backwards for the forearm, tapping the button that opens up his suit, which greets him as if it was his cocoon. A couple of (particularly loud) seconds later, Tony is the Iron Giant yet again, and, already expecting the same hand trick that has immobilized both the private and Steve, he directs all that is left of the charge into the blasting shot erupting from the battery in his chest. Loki, who wasn’t expecting any obstacles on his road, can’t anticipate the surprising move, nor the trajectory of the bullet, which hits his side in a deafening noise.
, a voice echoes in his brain,
But Tony is paralyzed now, can’t even speak. All he does is staring at the other, a mask of pure disbelief and confusion on his face.
He doesn’t know how long this moment lasts – could be a second or maybe a minute, he just can’t tell for sure – but eventually he manages to snap out of it, and clearing his throat, he adds: “Not good, Rogers, it’s just a second date, save that word for like... a month in.”
“Case in point. It doesn’t matter anyway.”
He doesn’t need to hear anything else, that’s more or less the same exact line he fed him a decade ago. He stands up, shakes his head, interrupts him before he can finish his sentence: “Not interested. Didn’t you hear? I’m retired. I thought you knew
“Tony! Are you alright?”
. But if anything, that only adds a frown on Steve’s face.
“How do you even remember this?”
, but now he
A couple of minutes go by – in which Tony observes stupefied other oddities in the room: flowers, and some sort of black picture frame on the opposite wall with a red dot on the bottom right corner – before the door opens and a group of three – two men (including the blonde he saw earlier in the cave) and a woman, all wearing very peculiar clothes – enters the room.
“Yeah, I didn’t know where else to go, to be honest. And I figured you’d be at the compound anyway. What happened?”
, even if he himself doesn’t look at it that way. He sits on the bed, sighing, and that’s when he hits him: the letters. He was about to leave the letters in the fucking drawer.
“Is there something you wanted to tell me?”
he tries he just can’t stop them. He lets himself on the bed, staring up to the ceiling and staying still for the longest time before sleep eventually catches up to him.
“Did anything happen?”
He doesn’t see Steve again until half a day later, when they show up for the meeting they had scheduled with Fury – and even when they’re in the same room, he actively avoids looking anywhere even remotely

?” Steve replies, meeting his eyes with a puzzled and alarmed look on his face which makes Tony smile earnestly.
And then, just as he tries to make himself believe it has to be an hallucination, it suddenly clicks inside his head what day is today.
“Cut the bullshit, Rogers. I’m counting to three. If you don’t say those words in your mind out loud, I’m leaving. And I’m not kidding.” Or is he?
“Guys,
Thinking about his childhood is not something Steve usually does – he doesn’t remember much about the first ten years of his life, mostly just his parents’ continuous arguments, some of the beatings (the most painful ones) he took for no apparent reason, that one time his father genuinely smiled at him. Still, as he sits in a chair too small for him – adolescence turned the scrawny kid into a healthy and bulky teen who would have belonged to a football field if given the chance – Steve finds his head thinking back to two and a half decades ago, without knowing the exact reason for it. Maybe it’s because yet again seems like his life is about to change, never mind that he ignores why he received that weird phone call yesterday, nor how the man on the other end of the line even knows of him. For what concerns him, Steve doesn’t think he’s anything special. Just another veteran trying to to make sense of the world again, to be useful even when not on a battlefield.
becomes the only thing he can think about. The moment the bedroom door shuts, he leans against the wall, grabs the collar of Mark’s shirt, pulling the stranger onto him to kiss him hungrily, convinced the quicker his movements, the less chances his brain has to regain control.
“Not a word. You need to rest, and I don’t want to let you go.”

“Well, do I
. Because although it terrifies him, he has realized he’s tired of lying to himself. Yes, Steve is a man, and no, he has never thought about men in such a context in his life before, but so what? Life is full of surprises – you can tap out in the Forties and wake up in a new millennium, so really, this is
, as if bracing himself to deliver a hard blow. Tony doesn’t like this, not one bit. “And I’m not a cop, none of us are. My name is Steve, by the way,” and he extends his hand towards him. Tony ponders for a moment about it, but decides to shake it all the same.
“You don’t
he likes it. Steve stays silent – maybe the only one of his traits still surviving this evening – not even knowing whether he’s enjoying this or not (although if he was able to think right now he would realize that having to ask this question is indicator enough of its answer). It doesn’t matter though – nothing does anymore, maybe never will again – because he’s doing this only out of disgust for himself, no point in hiding the truth. He keeps his eyes shut as he hits Mark’s prostate, sending the guy in what sounds like ecstasy, pace increasing with every thrust – he can’t
“I’m fine…” he starts again, pre-emptying the question he’s sure was about to come.
that that’s an acceptable thing to say after a first date, in the twenty-first century?”
Steve smiles again, and this time he doesn’t bother hiding it, because the other deserves to see it, deserves to know how much he means to him, no matter what the two of them have gone through – that’s just something that comes with the job. “Thank you,” he nods, meeting his glance, and although he really
the ‘Giant’ part of the name, and made sure to get rid of it when they decided the world needed to know at least part of the truth.
He walks out of the conference room, but he only has time to put two steps down that a familiar voice calls after him.
He doesn't need to open his eyes to
to comment on the sight right in front of him, and not just because almost three years have gone by since he last saw this face. It’s Steve, except not really.
“Sure thing, what can I do for you?”
, Tony can’t help but thinking, although he’s not quite sure just how much he could have done in that situation.
“Only if you want it to be.”
Holster around his waist, bulletproof vest on, at 9 sharp Tony marches out of the staff room and to the floor, giving the okay sign to Mr. Grant as he unlocks the front door before going to sit down in his position behind the window. For some mysterious reason he hasn’t quite figured out yet in over a year of working here, Wednesdays are the second busiest day after Fridays, and although the stream of people takes a while to pick up, there’s usually a steady and constant flow throughout the morning. And with this being the week before Memorial Day, by 12:30 it means two things: one, he hasn’t had a moment to recharge his eyes, so to speak, as they’ve always been on the lookout; two, his stomach is actually growling right now, and for once he cannot wait to see what the nearby deli has in store for him today. He doesn’t usually eat out for lunch – matter of fact, he doesn’t eat during his shift full stop, because he fears food would slow his reflexes down, was something to happen at the bank – but in those rare occasions when he can’t help it, the deli is his number one place to go.  It offers cheap prices and uses good quality ingredients, not to mention there’s a big variety of bagel fillings you can choose from. As he walks down the couple of blocks which separate him from the store, once again Tony finds himself thinking about Jarvis, wishing his house was closer by just so he could go home for lunch and see if the kitten had decided to forgive him.
It’s clear now that something has indeed happened
Fury nods and takes the pen, storing it safely away in the pocket of his jacket, then stands up and stretches a hand towards Tony, who reluctantly shakes it, still quite pissed at him.
But the echo of his name keeps coming up, incessantly, like a constant reminder that the person it belongs to
“You’re on.”
He had noticed how Steve had tensed up hearing his words, but, just as him, he decides to let it go for now: “Dating 101. You don’t sleep with someone
“What? No, I’m not agreeing, I was just…” Steve protests, shaking his head both to reinforce his denial and to snap out of his thoughts, “Listen, I’m going back home, whether you like it or not. I get if you’re worried about me being a liability though, so why don’t we make a deal? I’ll sit the action out until I can fully use my arm again or something.”
It takes then about half a day of marching to get to the signal, because although they could have easily landed closer to its source, everyone had agreed it was better to take the long way around to avoid getting made and losing the bit of advantage they have. When the sun starts going down, around 5pm, they stop to set camp, the plan being resting for a few hours and attacking at nighttime, when human’s visibility is reduced – or it should be, if the people they’re about to face are indeed humans.
"What ...... makes you think that?" Steve never knew the radiant Toni had such thoughts in her mind, he quickly stepped forward and took Toni's hand, "You're the best person in the world." He painfully avoided the wound and touched Toni's cheek, "Didn't you get hurt so many times to protect everyone? The only thing you need to change is to be more careful and stop putting yourself through so many wounds."
Blind and immobile, she panicked slightly, "Steve, what are you doing?"
Steve didn't know what he could do for a long time after he woke up, and he mostly just spent his time in the gym. Since time had sent him here, maybe one day he would continue fighting on the battlefield in this day and age.
Toni, 21, had just lost both of her parents, and after days of drinking and staying up late, Pepper forced open her bedroom door and took her to hospital in a coma. And 26-year-old Steve, whose acting career was just taking off, was brought to the hospital by Bucky after his first leading role was interrupted by an accident on set, when he broke an arm in the process.
"Any ideas Bruce? Oh you know I'm a genius but my academic direction is physics, not some biology or bloody brainwashing." Natasha barely managed to keep a calm tone but clenched her fists unconsciously.
At the time Toni thought he was just another workmate for a short time.
The moment of entry Steve let out a sigh of satisfaction beyond words, "oh, toni, you're so good, ahhh... I love you toni..."
"I didn't think the lace tabloids would know such an intimate name that only those close to her would use to call her, what, did old Mr Stark tell you this was the nickname he was going to give to his daughter?"
The man walked steadily around the room twice with the disorientated girl in his arms, easing his grip on the girl's legs a little with each step so that his hard, thick desire could poke deeper into her body as she dropped helplessly.
