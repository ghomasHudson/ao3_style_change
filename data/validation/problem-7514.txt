so you couldn’t possibly arrest him once you were out in the real world.
By the time Tony walked in, Steve was, just barely, all set up.  There was a chair sitting next to the doorway, and the screen Tony had been watching him on last night was lit, displaying a camera feed from the same room.  The camera feed came from the wall opposing the bed, on the opposite side from the door, and the camera picked up colors well enough to perfectly highlight the royal blue lace Steve was wearing.
Tony waited for a few moments after Rhodey went off to the truck, watching Steve in the back of the truck. He tried to picture Steve betraying him – Steve
“I don’t fancy camping down here,” Rhodey said once they were upright again. He rubbed ruefully at the back of his head, where he’d bumped it against a rock that had decided it wanted to ruin his day.
Rhodey was right. It was like there was a ghost behind him trying to say hi.
about it, so he buys the book; it's all kinds of useful.  It also turns out you can buy little eyes pre-made, so he goes online and orders a whole set of them for ten bucks.  Now he has enough eyes that he'll never need to buy them again for as long as he lives, and in all sorts of colors, too.
Tony went to shove at him, but Rhodey jumped ahead, laughing, so he almost tripped over a loose rock. Stumbling, he regained his balance and straightened his thick jacket. “We stick to the path for now,” he said, trying for a serious tone and probably failing judging from how amused Rhodey still looked.
Stark moved in closer, crushing their mouths together, kissing him like an act of war.  He cupped his hands around Steve’s ass and ground him forward so that their erections pressed together, separated only by a thin layer of fabric.
Tony got himself out of his pants, not quite hard yet but thickening steadily.  He straightened his cock out enough so that it wouldn't catch on any of his clothes when it firmed the rest of the way and then rested his hands on his thighs.  His eyes were hot on Steve, and if felt odd—felt different, but good-different, to be watched in this way.  The back of Steve's neck prickled, and his breath came faster over his lips.
“What is it?”
Christ, she would. Pepper wouldn’t be at all happy with how things were progressing, for both personal and professional reasons. Readers apparently liked mystical things only to a point, and this was pushing things.
move her hand.
The end of the plug was narrow, barely larger than the tip of his little finger.  He had expected to get something shaped vaguely like a small, personal spade, but in fact the highest reviews he had seen were for an irregular shape, a collection of bulges.  It was pretty obviously designed to mimic the usual functions of a guy’s sphincter, and Steve had deliberately gotten it in blue to reduce the resemblance.
There was silence in the room as they both looked at it.  I’ll have to clean that by hand, too, Steve thought.
“Hrrrrgh!” said Tony.  Steve blinked down at him dumbly.
, and Tony couldn’t believe he’d never missed it before.
“Uh-huh.” Rhodey touched his shoulder, grip reassuringly steady. “Your weird feelings tell you that?”
It had been maybe a minute since Zemo had fired the first shot at Steve. He needed more time. More time he wouldn’t have if Zemo shot at him right now.
Come to think of it, the snow surrounding the ice block seemed less solid than it had minutes ago as well. It was distinctly more like a slushy frosty puddle than freshly fallen snow now.
There was no way he should be warming up this fast, because his breath was definitely fogging the shield.
Absolutely nothing happened beyond the rock hitting the ground with a loud thud and skittering to a stop in the snow. They waited another five minutes, scarcely daring to breathe as they listened for anything that might be a trap going off. When all remained quiet, Tony relaxed and felt Rhodey do the same, his friend’s grip on his arm slackening.
. (Like Tony was somehow the sun or another star that didn’t make someone’s eyes burn out and Steve was so goddamn blessed to see him and maybe Tony was exaggerating a bit now.)
They stared at each other, sprawled there, pants loose— Steve was most of the way to naked.  Stunned astonishment, entirely mutual, echoed between their minds.
Gwen opened her mouth to tell Tasha it was
“Unless an ambitious mountain goat decides to make off with them, I think it’ll be fine,” Rhodey told Tony once he made it up. “What’re we looking at?”
“You’ll be thrown off the frame when it seals,” Tasha called around it.  “I suggest you make yourself comfortable; you’re going to be in there for a long, long time.”
“Oh, good,” Tony yawned.  “Why’m moving?”
Steve took his right hand off his ass, too, then, pulling the ring off and sucking it clean before throwing it away.  Then he put his hand back where it had been, holding himself open, and only when that was done did he pull his left hand out, still carrying its load.  He raised it up and dumped it on his ass, smearing it across both cheeks and the hole, rubbing it in before going back to holding his position as if nothing had happened.  “You were saying?”
Tony stared at him for a moment, remembering that he
“It’s up there,” Tony said, securing the rope to his belt. “I’m going to check that it’s clear and then you can come up with a light.” The much lighter backpack went back on. He didn’t wait for an answer before he started climbing.
Was that the best he could come up with?!
In private. Where, you know, there weren’t any eyewitnesses.
we won the damn war—”
Steve shuddered, nodding slightly. He shifted, dropping until his forehead rested against Tony’s left shoulder and the tension seeped out of his muscles. It was like feeling someone turn from ice to water, and Tony felt honored that Steve trusted him enough to show that.
She did
Steve shuddered, pressing sharply against his throbbing penis, and Tony, before him, squeezed his eyes closed and came, spilling in three sharp splurts onto the coverlet.
Except, no; what
He turned the showerhead on the mess, then reached for the other device, a kind of plug unromantically called a sperm stopper, and the antiseptic lube.  He had ten minutes before Tony was scheduled to arrive; he was going to have to hurry if he wanted to be ready in time.
Rhodey would be accompanying him; Jarvis would stay behind, keeping an eye on their supplies and the Iron Man suit. It was just like so many of their other adventures, and Tony was so damn glad that the war was over and he no longer had to deal with the sound of machine fire, the metallic smell of blood, and the screams of the dying and injured.
Steve.  Do you know where that’s been?”
Steve coiled, twisting to the side, and then uncoiled, arms flying out. A colorful blur escaped his hands – the
hand...?  Oh.  It was still tight in his hair, a small, delicious tension.  He forced his fingers to uncurl, surprised by how much he didn’t want to do it.
“It sounds like you,” Steve said, sounding sincere. Coming from anyone else, it could have been an insult. Steve made it sound like red and gold being Tony’s colors was as natural like the sky being blue.
Steve froze, but the order hadn’t been addressed to him.  Tony leaned over for the lube, slicking his hand and then returning to his previous position.  His eyes closed in bliss as he gave himself a slow, firm pump, and when he opened them again, they gleamed.  “Rewind.  ...Now play, at... thirty percent speed.”
Tony swallowed.  "I'm gonna say anything we do while you're dressed like that, I'm gonna like."  His eyes roved over Steve's body, and he stepped forward.
Eventually Steve had knees again.  He let go of the table and pulled the panties from his mouth, scrubbing at the mess on his other hand with them.  He got most of it, absently cleaning the rest of it with his tongue.
Her dress that day was a lovely A-line thing.  It clung close through her torso to the top of her hips and then flared magnificently.  The bodice was strapped, with a sweetheart neckline that Gwen both loved and hated at the same time.  The color was bronze, but the lower hem had an ivory flower splashed across it.  It was
"I like how you think," Thanos said. "If he truly is King of Asgard, his people are probably looking for him. I'm sure they'd open the gates right up once they saw we were returning their King, safe and sound…"
"Don't bullshit me," she said. "You're wasted."
"Of course, you wouldn't understand, you overgrown lab-rat." Steve's hand locked around Tony's wrist tightly before he even had the chance to think about walking off-stage and getting up in that woman's face. Tony didn't try to resist at all, knowing that his unarmored-self stood no chance against Steve's superhuman strength. He settled for giving the woman the most vicious glare he could as she was led away like all the others.
"Pepper, it's rude to talk like someone's not here when they're in the room." Lara couldn't help but share in Pepper's groan of agitation.
"In what way?" Salinas' jaw almost completely dropped.
The hardwood barely squeaked as Tony sat down. It was top-quality and felt nice and smooth with all the layers of lacquer that covered it. Looking around, Tony couldn't help but be amazed at what a good job both Steve and Pepper had done. It wasn't just the bathroom; the entire apartment looked amazing and it was all thanks to Steve's designs and Pepper's attention to detail. For half a second, it took his mind off the nightmare. It was nice, but it was only for half a second.

"No one's going to get upset or mad at you," Steve tried to assure.
"Why were you in such a rush anyway?" Maria asked. "I mean, you shot out of here like a bat out of hell."
A flash of panic went through Carol. There was a full thirty seconds where the words
"What symptoms are you feeling specifical?" he clarified. "Other than obvious nausea."
So today is Gwyneth Paltrow's birthday... All I'm going to say about that is that I hope she has the best day possible with her friends and family.
"Was that because of that psycho ex of hers?" Tony looked at Barton in surprise.
"She does have a point there, Clint," Bruce added. "You tired yourself out pretty quickly there trying to get out from under my grasp – again, sorry about that – but I have no doubt that you would have just as easily become fatigued if you tried to help out downstairs as well."
"So?" Lila questioned.
"No," he said. "To be honest, I don't blame him or Pepper for watching the video. I just wish the video didn't exist at all." Then the lightbulb clicked in his head. "Wait…" Happy's eyes went wide as he caught on to Tony's line of thinking.
"Well, if it's any consolation," he said. "Just remember that at the end of the day, you get to come home to a nice supper with your wonderful boyfriend." Tony looked up at him, eyes wide and a smile bursting across his face.
She let her emotions get to her. She recognized that. She also clearly crossed a line in interrogating Sharpton and confronting Subarian. It had been a long time since she had lost control like that and she couldn't help but think that maybe her emotions had compromised her, just like the Red Room said they would.
"Thank you," he said. "I appreciate it." Lara cracked a smile, which sent another jolt through his body.
Right as the call ended, Carol walked up to Tony with a none-too-pleased look on her face.
"What's this?" he asked.
After getting out of the shower, Carol decided that she could go for a snack. Unsure of what, if anything, might be in the fridge she headed downstairs to check it out. Halfway down the stairs, she spotted Fury standing in the hallway as if he was waiting for her. Without hesitation, Carol made her way down the stairs and approached him.
"Yeah," Natasha said. "But you also smeared sex jelly on the walls and tore the room apart. What else were they supposed to think? How were they supposed to know that this was even a joke?"
"Yeah," Tony said.
," Steve said. "Come back to the sidewalk! You're going to get hurt!"
"Yes," Pepper said.
"He's been through a lot," she explained. "You both have. Talking can help." Steve nodded in agreement, but still looked hesitant. "At least tell me you'll think about it." Steve didn't say anything for a moment, but eventually nodded.
"Something like that." Natasha got up and the device she put on the door started to beep. She grabbed both Steve and Tony's shoulders and turned them away from the door. "Don't look until I say."
"What?" Tony said. "You don't like that term of endearment?"
"Does Lisa know about this?" she asked, using their codename for Laura.
"Beg pardon?" Tony asked.
The text message had been proceeded by a package delivery. She found it waiting on her cot when she went to bed that night. Inside of the package was a vial and a card informing her that it was the venom of a Kingslayer Jellyfish, synthesized to be able to be metabolized in the human body through ingestion. Jessica researched the species that night on her phone. A quick Google search revealed that the Kingslayer was a type of Irukandji Jellyfish and was thought to be one of the most venomous in the world. If stung, the victim would rapidly develop the symptoms of Irukandji Syndrome and in some cases could die in as few as fifteen minutes. Although it would appear odd for a United States Congressman who had never been to Queensland, Australia before (where the jellyfish were commonly found) to suddenly come down with and die from Irukandji Syndrome, it was actually a pretty good cover. Doctors and medical examiners would have no reason to suspect it and as such would be unable to come up with a diagnosis or a cause of death. It would seem like he just suddenly got sick and died. It was a good idea, but Jess was somewhat skeptical of the practicality of it.
"No ma'am," he said. "We're good."
He tapped the dialogue box to compose a new message. He realized he probably should have done this earlier, but better late than never he supposed.
"No," Dante said. "I haven't even gotten to say I'm sorry yet…"
"Is there anything else we need to know?" Natasha asked.
I'm so sorry about this everyone. If I have enough chapters written, maybe I'll be back in September, but honestly, I'm not going to promise anything.
"No, Brother. That's all I have." For a moment, Adoniram raised an eyebrow. Something in the way he said that didn't sound convincing like he was holding something back. However, Adoniram didn't want to question Freeman further. He just wanted him out of his sight.
"Unless the fact that armed gunmen have invaded my tower is purely coincidental, then yeah, I'm pretty sure." Hill's attempt to keep that very nasty curse under her breath failed.
As soon as he saw the number, Steve was confused. It was way too long and didn't have any letters in it. There was no way it could be valid. He had only used a phone a handful of times in his life, but he at least knew that much. It also didn't help that he hadn't seen a single phone since Tony left the other day. So, even if it was a valid number, he wouldn't be able to call Tony and let him know he was alright.
Tony panted hard from all the screaming. Steve just stared. It was easy to see that he wasn't expecting all of that. He blinked, trying to get a grasp on everything. Tony, meanwhile, recovered and walked right past him.
"Conroy and a few security personnel," Tony said. "That's it."
"What's wrong, honey?" Rather dramatically, Tony's pout deepened.
At the same time, the crew member finished hitching up Tony's microphone.
"Ah," Thor said. "I understand now. So, since the people of Earth lack a dedicated avian species to ride, they construct these metal sky birds to take them from one destination to another."
"Yes, sir." The video started playing but no change happened on screen. If it wasn't for the time stamp in the corner changing every thirty seconds, Tony would think that he was just looking at a still image of the chem lab at an awkward angle. Sighing, Tony forced himself to concentrate on the screen.
"It's just…" Tony said. "You know it's alright to say you're not comfortable. I know we just met a few days ago and things are kind of changing fast, but… I like you. I haven't really had a chance to get to know you, but what I've seen so far, I like, and I don't want to pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with. I just need to hear you say the words."
After agreeing upon that, the next section of the forum was a symptoms checklist. That was easy enough as Tony only had to answer yes or no. He kept his own self-assessments and the observations of others in mind as he answered each one. He didn't think he was feeling depression, loss of interest, or any inability to feel enjoyment from normally pleasurable things, and he could give a hard no to things like "crying spells," "hallucinations," "suspiciousness," and especially "decreased libido." Other things, though, he knew he couldn't say no to.
"That's enough," she tried to say, but Fair just shouted over her.
With that, Jessica fell silent. Her hand went to her heart and her jaw went slack. The words
"Is there anything I can do?" At that, Tony rolled over until his face was against Steve's chest and wrapped his arms around his waist.
"Good morning," he weakly muttered. Carol shrugged.
"I'm not worried," Tony asserted. "And I'm not scared. I just know something's wrong with me."
"Really?" Tony said. "Well, I think I'll have to decide that for myself."
"No problem." Kneževic then went back to the fridge to retrieve another beer.
…Except for Natasha clearing her throat.
"You're welcome," Steve said. "So, what should I do?" The smile faded, and Tony looked confused.
Everhart's eyes narrowed, her brow tightened, and her jaw clenched. Tony had a feeling that he was poking a sleeping bear by not giving her what she wanted. Again, that was too bad. If she wanted a gossipy, "he tells all" interview, she was barking up the wrong tree and should have stuck with
"So, anyways, I think I'm going to go," she said. "No offence, but after this whole ordeal I think I just want to go home and relax in the tub with a lavender bath bomb." She brought a hand to her head. "Err, maybe I should go to the Emergency Room first. I'm pretty sure I missed my last dose of insulin."
"I'm sorry about that." Betty shook her head.
"This isn't a social call, Stark."
Yes, Steve was aware of the irony of Captain America being scared. He did not need anyone to point it out or rub it in. What he needed was a magic boost in confidence that would make him not care about those things and just let himself be happy with Tony. However, reality did not work like that.
"Yeah," Knežević said. "Like I actually believe that bull crap!"
"Not just S.H.I.E.L.D.," Tony said. "Pretty much the entire Western World knows I'm bisexual, meaning I like both men and women." Steve was deathly silent, so Tony continued. "I tried telling you this a few days ago, but obviously we never got to finish that conversation, so…"
Now that we've taken our little detour with Rhodey, let's check back in with Carol!
"With everything that's happening," Coulson said. "And the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned." Steve didn't say anything, just looked at Coulson in silent agreement.
"Are you kidding?" she said. "He's not invited to the rest of my life. I haven't talked to him since…" Again, she froze. Bruce gave her a sympathetic look.
"Thanks," Lara said as she hauled herself to her feet.
"How high would you actually say it was, then?" Rhodey asked.
"Didn't mean to?" Pepper said. "Tony, all you've done for the past year is keep things from me! First, you go flying around in a metal suit, nearly getting yourself killed how many times before I caught you getting out of that thing? Then the Arc Reactor almost kills you and you tell no one. Now your insurance company cancels you and you might still die after all…" Pepper brought a hand to her mouth and looked down. Tony studied her with concern.
"I never do," Salinas said. "But when the time comes for real…"
"I feel like I can't catch a break," he admitted. "Like all I know anymore is loss, and I feel like it's been following me around for a while, before I even became Captain America."
. He was alive and breathing. All the sudden all the joy and gratefulness that had been running through him before surged right back in. Unable to help himself, Steve rushed forward, placed his hands on either side of Tony's face, and kissed him. He didn't care that Thor and Bruce – or rather the Hulk – were watching. He didn't care what anyone saw or thought. He was just so overwhelmingly happy that Tony was safe and alive, and he put all that emotion and energy into the kiss.
"How do you know I don't have any meetings today?" Lara gave him an incredulous look.
"That seems like it'd be likely," he said. "But I know we had nothing in there that could pose a threat to the whole building – at least not anymore." He, too, was keenly aware of the chlorine gas incident. "Standard protocol would be to seal up the lab and let the air filtration system do it's job."
to go back to S.H.I.E.L.D. Tony wasn't
"Hey," Steve said. "How'd it go?"
"Carry me?" Tony questioned. "Where are we going?"
"Any chance their families have access to information, old files?" Agent Coulson asked.
Once again, JARVIS rewound the video and once again Tony watched as the screen changed from one still image to another with little to no explanation as to why or how. He narrowed his eyes and rewound the video again. There was something missing; something he wasn't seeing. He just needed to keep watching the video until he found it.
"Unfortunately, I'm afraid I don't have any inhabitable worlds to offer at this time." Tarquan's face instantly fell. "However, I think I can offer something better." Tarquan's brow raised in interest. The frog-man chuckled and pulled something out of his desk drawer.
His voice had never sounded so cold, but that was unsurprising. Having what was most precious taken away often did that to people.
"What? Why didn't you say anything?"
"Well dafaq if I knew that at the time." Tony rolled his eyes as he started hitting buttons on the coffee maker.
"No," Clint said. "I'm not wasting my time just ho have someone parrot back everything I already know. Besides, I don't think May would like me talking to her ex."
"I'd like to spe-"
"About Freeman, right?" Pepper's eyebrows raised in surprise.
Tony and Carol retrieved the food without incident and returned to the penthouse just a few minutes later. The first thing that Tony noted was that Bruce and Pepper were gone, and he was told that Bruce had checked Pepper's injury like he asked, and it really had been worse than the EMTs initial assessment. The glass had indeed left a burn on her cheek and the gauze that had been placed over the injury only served to irritate it. Bruce took her upstairs to the med bay to treat it properly. Luckily, he said it looked to be only a first-degree burn, so it was unlikely to leave any scarring. Although her face remained stoic, Tony could practically feel the waves of guilt rolling off Carol, so he quickly redirected her attention back to the food, which she appeared grateful for.
"Are you alright?" Fury asked.
Tony could vaguely remember someone saying that they poured out all the alcohol, but they probably didn't think to even touch the mouthwash. Tony smirked and got out of the tub.
After his wonderful weekend getaway to the magical land of S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony was left feeling a little more than drained. The stress and confusion of the entire ordeal were more than his mind could take and he ended up crawling under the sheets and passing out as soon as he got home. By the time morning rolled around, Tony wasn't feeling much better. He ignored his first two wake-up calls, hoping to get in a few more minutes of glorious sleep before he had to start his day and face the world. However, by the third time JARVIS urged him to awaken, Tony knew that he couldn't put it off any longer. He got out of bed, showered, dressed, and was off to work in less than thirty minutes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, Tony couldn't say this to the cameras. Howard Stark had worked meticulously throughout his life to keep that side of himself hidden from public view. After his death, Tony found it best to keep maintaining this image. After all, opening about his daddy issues would just bring more unnecessary drama into his life and make him out to be weak. He wasn't weak. Stark men are made of iron. So, he could suck it up and answer a few more interview questions, even if they were dangerously prying.
"Just stay with me." Tony smiled and brought Steve's hand up to his lips, pressing a kiss to his knuckles.
"You don't have to talk," Steve said. "We can just be quiet."
"Steve." He stopped himself before he added "Rogers."
"What did I say?"
Steve could hear an entire choir of angels singing directly in his ears. Once again, he found himself thankful for the increased durability and healing factor the Super Soldier Serum gave him. Otherwise, he probably would have gone deaf the second Thor's hammer hit his shield.
Tony really wished he could direct a glare at himself. Instead, he settled for directing it at Freeman's image on the holographic screen. Eventually, though, he had to relent and did so with a heavy sight.
Basically, if I screw anything up with anything having to do with science, don't blame me. Blame "no child left behind." I swear to God, the only reason I graduated high school is because that law exists.
"A 'c.'"
"Where are we going?" Hill looked up at her through the rearview mirror.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey," she said. "What's going on? Can I help?"
Within seconds, Steve's lips were on Tony's again. He lost himself completely in that kiss, forgetting that there was anything else to existence outside of the blissful ecstasy that was being so intimately close with the man who held his heart. Nothing could ruin the moment.
"Excellent," she said. "Now where to start? I guess I'll go with the basics. I was born in Indiana and I'm the oldest of six siblings. My sister is the youngest and there are four boys between us, so you can imagine the chaos that house was growing up. Let's see… I went to the University of Pennsylvania for my undergrad and Yale for my doctorate. I met my husband twenty-five years ago and we'll be celebrating our twentieth wedding anniversary in May. We have one fifteen-year-old son and we live on Long Island. My husband is a former Naval engineer and currently works as a head designer for a ship building company headquartered in Queens. We live a relatively quiet and peaceful life for the most part." She seemed to be content, which caused Tony to frown.
Special thanks to DiveTooDeep on AO3 for the comment! It really means a lot!
"Thank you, Agent…"
"That may be true," DeMarcus said. "But you're over here leaned back in your chair and pouting like a five-year-old while your assistant is stalking around the room like the theme from
"So, you went through the building?" Maria asked.
"Go fuck yourself."
"I was in a bad place and I needed to hear it," Tony said. "That's the only reason why she told me."
"Relax," Pepper said. "It's not that bad." Tony scoffed at the notion.
"Are you comfortable?" Tony nodded. "Are you sure? Do you need more blankets?" Tony didn't say anything, just eyed Steve warily.

Steve crosses his arms across his chest, his expression, unreadable. If Steve’s offended, he doesn’t show it, and the uncertainty makes Tony squirm. Eventually, he says, “Why me? You know my preferences, Tony. They're different from yours. I've never been with a woman, so, I can’t really teach you how to...perhaps Jim or Thor would be willing.” Bless the man's heart, Tony thinks, with a relieved sigh. What seemed like an irreparable crack in their friendship moments ago turns into a glimmer of hope that by the end of the evening, Tony can still call Steve Rogers his friend.
The metal carriage climbs the 85 stories on Stark Tower at a steady clip, to the team's residential penthouse, but it feels like the longest ride Tony's ever taken — that includes an impromptu road trip with Rhodey and Carol to a neighbouring galaxy in a rigged, first-generation Quinjet.
Steve… Rogers.
“It was worth taking a chance.”
There was a group of heroes, the Avengers, he said in a low, indistinct voice. They’d know what to do. When Nebula left to the galley, Tony stared at the infinite enormity of space, remembering the vision foretelling his legacy, the end of the path that started the first day he had put on the armour. For all he knew, the Avengers died, slaughtered like lambs, while fate’s cruel blade left him alive as punishment. He had meant to take the fight away from Earth, spent six years preparing for the day of reckoning, but in the end, the plan exploded into a catastrophic failure against Thanos’ unflinching resolve. The Avengers paid the price and he didn’t — just like the dire prophecy had predicted. He shuddered at the thought.
Steve pauses in front of the door, his hand on the lock.
Tony sighed. On some levels, commandeering Quill’s ship, eating his food, wearing his clothes, felt wrong, disrespectful, even. But he had been at the end of his rope on Titan, with a high-tech band-aid slapped on a vicious stab wound, and the ashes of a seventeen-year-old kid still stuck under his fingernails. Tony had scrubbed his hands on board the ship until the skin split open, red rivulets trickling into the wash basin. Nebula had bandaged his hands without a word. The enormity of their defeat was
to find a way to bring everyone back. Forget the Accords, forget everything we fought over,
Tony turned off the radio. He left the flight deck and pulled up a chair in the galley, opposite Nebula. A bowl of grey, translucent soup sat in front of him. It smelled like chowder-gone-bad, but the hunger pangs clawing at his stomach walls won out. Tony slurped and emptied the bowl in a handful of big gulps, retching at the pungent aftertaste flooding his mouth as he tasted the bile rising at the back of his throat. “I feel like you’re feeding me sewage water and calling it gourmet,” he said, wiping his tongue on his black tank top.
Tony babbles: “You're a good teacher. Really, really good. Lots of great tips and tricks, and that thing you did with your throat, shit, that's...no one's ever done that to me.”
, even if he wants to. Not that it's even a consideration, not when Steve's mouth feels warm, inviting and mind-numbingly good. Tony tightens his grip on the Captain’s head and pushes his hips forward, thrusts once, twice, and when Steve whines around his cock, he lets himself go. Tony fucks Steve's mouth slow and steady, pulling all the way out before slamming to the back of his throat. As he creeps closer to the edge, Tony’s momentum falters; his thrusts become more erratic until— “Steve, I can't, I'm close,” he warns as Steve caresses Tony’s thighs to encourage him along, instead of pulling away.
The screen booted up once Tony tapped the helmet near the temple. He sat on the floor in the flight deck. Nebula had been tinkering with the dead reactor core for the past two hours without much success.
She stalked forward and leaned over him, bending till she stood at his eye level, her hands gripping the handles on his seat. “There’s only one thing left to do, Stark, and that’s to kill Thanos. He must answer for what he did, for the people he killed. My sister. Quill. Mantis. That big oaf. Your friends. The child. Their blood is on his hands, and you’re going to help me take him down. Do you understand?”
of them, and clasped them between his own. The metal felt warmer than he had expected, unlike the thick, cold, and unfeeling fingers recurrent in nightmares about an abandoned bunker hidden in a sea of white. “Come on, get some rest.”
“No,” Tony said. “Unlikely. Thanos left Earth last. We—someone I knew had the mind stone. I don’t think he’s alive… I haven’t really thought about the rest. You heard the radio calls. You know what’s going on out there.”
Nebula adjusted the metal casing and stuck her tongue out. Tony squinted, and, in the ship’s dim lights, he saw it had been sewed back together, uneven. “It’s not the worst thing he has done to me but, this time, my sister paid the price. Because of me, because I couldn’t succeed in something I’ve spent my whole life preparing.” Her fist slammed on the console next to her, the sound of metal clashing against metal reverberating through the ship, and Tony flinched. When she stood up, he shrank in his seat, his pulse racing, mind calculating all of the painful ways she could finish what her lunatic father had started. Part of him welcomed the possibility of dying at the hands of an alien, hidden behind the stars, billions of miles from home.
The lift doors open with a ding and he barely dodges an arrow that sticks to the carriage's metal wall behind him. Tony scowls when Clint shuffles into view; the archer flashes an apologetic smile for almost impaling Tony with one of his trick arrows.
Since moving into the Tower, Steve's gone through several dozen punching bags, opting for their serial destruction instead of getting therapy for trauma and readjustment to a new life — Tony, himself an expert at dodging his problems, enabled Steve's choice by pre-emptively buying a year's worth of punching bags from a reputable supplier.
“Look, I’m sorry. For everything. I’m not proud of how I reacted, but I now understand why you did what you did. I guess I thought I had time to stay mad at you for a few years, let things cool down first, you know? But being adrift in space with zero chance of rescue isn't as bad as it sounds. It gave me a new perspective. Time’s limited, and I am not coming home anytime soon or what's left there. So, now is as good a time to tell you: Steve, I
“Ah shit,” Tony said. “Power failure? It should come back online soon… there must be a backup gener—”
It sounded familiar. Deep, baritone and laced with worry—the kind of paranoid worrying that Tony used to once make fun of. His mind swam in a sea of foggy memories, trying to remember the owner of that voice. It must’ve belonged to a friend, he thought. The voice seemed
“Stay with me,” Nebula hissed. “And tell me who he is. Did you love him?”
The gesture knocks the wind out of Tony's chest. Steve presses against his back, a solid, immovable mass of muscle and grit. Tony shudders at the other man’s warm breath in his ear as he speaks in a stern, baritone voice that
Since Steve came out of the ice, helped stop an alien invasion and moved into the Tower, Tony discovered the Captain’s many peculiarities that are never mentioned in the brochures they hand out at the Smithsonian's Captain America exhibit — such as his love for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Once, in a drunken haze, Tony had offered to buy the team and relocate them from Los Angeles, back to Brooklyn, but Steve, flustered, probably by the generous offer, had mumbled something like, “You don't have to do that, Tony. Things changed the way they were meant to, and my being here after 70 years shouldn't affect that.”
A thunderous noise shook the entire structure of the spacecraft, setting off a dozen alarms in the cockpit. Nebula rushed to the elevator, Tony hot on her heels. The cargo hold was filled with smoke, the acrid smell of burnt metal and melted plastic choking the air supply to Tony’s lungs and burning his eyes. He bunched up his tank top and pressed the fabric over his nose, covering his mouth as he followed Nebula towards the reactor core in the other room.
“Record. Message 011. It’s me again. I’m still here and that surprises me as much as it would surprise you. We’re still stranded. All of our efforts to repair the core were futile. I can’t fix the damage and there’s not a planet in sight. Food’s run out, we’re down to the last tank of water, and O2 sat level is at 61 percent. It’s getting harder to breathe, and I think the stab wound is infected. Right now, there’s a pretty exciting race going on, on what’s going to kill me: I’m betting on dehydration.”
he can say, anyway, which he knows is a shitty way to react to someone who had just given him the best blowjob of his life. So, Tony does what comes to him naturally. He deflects the impending, awkward conversation by kissing Steve. It starts with a peck on the lips, but that's all the invitation Steve needs to deepen the kiss, his tongue pushing past Tony's parted lips. Steve tastes of come,
----------
With a sharp inhale, and before his nerves can get the better of him, Tony says, “Steve, wait.”
Steve sucks harder and, again, presses a finger against the sensitive patch of skin behind Tony’s groin, pushing him over the edge.
“I was so angry with him, I never went after him. Everything fell apart and I wish I could… see him one more time, tell him—”
you. There, I said it. Words I never thought I’d hear coming out of my mouth, not so soon, anyway, but dying has a funny way of making you re-evaluate priorities.”
“There’s nowhere to go.” Nebula’s voice cracked. Tony gripped her shoulder, gentle, reassuring. She leaned into the touch. Beneath the mechanical stoicism lived the real Nebula, hiding from years of punishment that Thanos had meted out for her shortcomings. Tony saw her surface only a handful of times—once, while in the throes of his nightmares, he heard a whispered lullaby in his ear, sang in a tongue he didn’t understand, by a voice softer than Nebula’s. It had soothed him back to sleep and she avoided his gaze when he woke. In another moment, he had watched her examine the damaged helmet—all that was left of his suit—with a childlike curiosity.
Tony swallowed, shrinking in his seat under her cold, penetrating gaze. He nodded.  “I… yeah. Yeah, I’ll help you.”
Peter’s panicked plea never stopped ringing in Tony’s ears.
“Yeah,” Tony said, snorting. “Flash Gordon was…
“Tell me about Steve,” Nebula said, her grip on his bony wrists reassuring him that he was not alone, that he would not die by himself lost in space. “You recorded those messages for him. Who is he?”
“What I am
like him. But I can't come out guns blazing and say this to the team, or to anyone—one of the downsides of being a public figure with his name attached to a Fortune 500 company, I suppose.”
Tony closes his eyes, wills himself to sink through the floor in shame. All his apprehensions — thoughts and misgivings he had quelled on the way to New York — bubble to the surface; they make him feel dirty and nauseated.
They almost hadn't made it out of Titan. The planet’s off-kilter gravity had nearly grounded the spacecraft for good. Thanos had won through his sheer willpower and wiped out half of all sentient life in the universe—how does one come back in the face of such overwhelming, consuming defeat? The answer had dodged Tony and Nebula’s minds as they watched the distance grow between the decaying planet and the ship. Loss and devastation sank in their guts, the guilt felt like ankle weights, dragging them underwater, and in a fleeting moment of clarity, Tony had suggested they travel to Earth.
Steve stares at him, his gaze fixed and unmoving until it borders on uncomfortable, until it forces Tony to look away and mumble, “It—oh fuck. I misread this, didn't I? I'm sorry, I—”
“Earth’s mightiest heroes. She tore us apart like cotton candy,” Steve once said. The disdain in his tone never stopped cutting through Tony like ice shards poking an open wound. The Avengers started off as something, something exciting, but then came the mistakes—“My fault,” Tony admitted, readily—the compromises until the very name festered into something rotting, putrid-smelling, a catalogue of flaws that crumbled the team’s foundation.
“In my defence, Stark—” Clint starts, but Tony cuts him off with a hasty, “Don't, birdbrain. Just
Nebula tilted her head. The reference eluded her.
feel this arousing. “I didn't say I won't teach you.” Tony’s mind draws blank when Steve slides an arm around his waist, his palm resting just above Tony’s groin. “Must be a lucky guy, whoever this schmuck is if he makes Tony Stark want to learn how to suck cock. I am almost jealous.”
Tony coughed, his eyes closed. Before his mind could wander off into the old, abandoned bunker hidden by a blanket of white in freezing temperature, a regular feature in his frantic dreams, Nebula jerked him awake. He flinched on instinct and moved a hand up along his chest, fingers trying to claw through the skin-tight suit as if reaching for an unscratched itch underneath. In the narrow space between his heart and heaving lungs, Tony felt a phantom pressure build—of indestructible metal and untempered rage. It weighed him down and kept him immobile on the ship's hard, unfeeling surface.
“We need help,” Tony said, returning to the upper level. Nebula sat, scanning the radio frequencies. The same sounds repeated on every channel: Chaotic, desperate pleas for help echoing throughout a broken universe. “Without power, we’re sitting ducks. Food and water will last us another month, tops, and then the oxygen’s gonna run out.”
For an alien vessel, the Benatar was compact; it was smaller than what Tony had expected; the ship’s size resembled commercial passenger jets ferrying hundreds of passengers daily around the Earth. The flight deck had been fitted with a curved glass extending outwards from floor to ceiling. The sleeping berths lined up the back of the aircraft, next to the galley and storage units, and there was an empty docking bay at the tail end. A small elevator shaft from the galley led down to the cargo hold where, behind a narrow door, the ship’s reactor core stood. It was the heart of the ship, giving it the means to move at near light speed and cover great distances in the cosmic vastness. The reactor’s blue glow matched the one in Tony’s chest.
of a demonstration, Cap,” Tony says, forcing a quiet, nervous laugh once he's coherent again. He chews on his next words and struggles to articulate his feelings beyond gratitude. When Steve pulls away, Tony blurts out, “Can I... can I return the favour?”
Tony makes his way to the gym. From the quiet hallway, he can hear Steve's grunts in tandem with loud thuds — the sound of Steve's un-gloved fists hitting a punching bag. It
“It’s melted,” Nebula said, raising her voice over a new set of alarms that beeped from the machines connected to the reactor. “We’re out of power.”
“We’ll see.”
“Please. My name is Steve Rogers. Please tell me he’s on your ship.”
, you've done this a thousand times,” he whispers, grateful for the lack of company inside the lift. Instead of elevating his spirits, like it's intended to, Tony sinks into a bottomless pit of nerves and self-doubt until—
“It's not—” Tony shakes his head and takes in a deep breath. “They can't help me.” He shifts closer and offers an encouraging smile. But Steve narrows his eyes as if he's beginning to doubt Tony's intentions. “There's this guy, Steve, he's a pretty charming fella. I never thought I'd swing this way, you know, but I think, I think I kinda like him. Really,
Steve turns around and crosses his arms. “Okay, seriously, Tony, you're taking this too far. Stop.”
Rogers.
“It’s not your fault. I had a chance to kill him but I was too arrogant. He caught me before I could finish him off.”
Tony whimpers. It's not the first time he's heard Steve say something crude — one of the first things the team had learned after moving to the Tower was that Captain America's ‘good boy' image was nothing more than a carefully cultivated, dirty propaganda. Steve swore like a sailor and had zero reservations about airing details of his escapades from the ‘40s. The man was determined to defy every Captain America stereotype that people in Tony's generation grew up with, and Tony adored him for it.
to the best one yet, and it’s not just because he’s getting it from Captain America. Steve uses his lips, tongue, and hands to keep Tony teetering on the edge but denies him the push he needs to topple over. Tony bites down on his already chapped lips in frustration; he’s reduced to a frenzied, panting mess from the effortless way Steve knows exactly which of his buttons to press, until he sneaks a finger under Tony and presses against his perineum. For a second, Tony fears the arc reactor in his chest is dead and he’s having a heart attack until his muscles convulse, inundated with pleasure.
he thinks as a pair of sturdy arms sweep him off the floor and carries him out of the gym.
“How did we lose so badly? We were the Avengers. Once. We should’ve stopped him. We should’ve done better. We let Thanos win and, now, there’s nothing left to avenge. Tell me I’m wrong.”
Tony blurts out the words before he thinks of a better, more tactful way to phrase them to avoid looking like he’s propositioning a colleague. Steve withdraws the hands from Tony’s shoulders and steps back, his brows knitted together. Tony prays in silence for the man to have misheard him. “I was—I think maybe—” He begins hastily, but Steve cuts him off.
“Your clothes smell. Here, these were Quill’s. They’ll fit you,” Nebula told him one day after a meal—Tony lost track of breakfasts, lunches and dinners. They ate every eight hours when an alarm pinged on his watch, reminders for meal times. The food left on board was freeze-dried, packaged in sealed containers, and came in various colours. Everything tasted bland, unappetizing, but the growls in his stomach forced Tony to swallow every bite, even when the insides of his mouth felt like dried husk.
When Nebula’s eyes drifted close, Tony grabbed the helmet and went down the elevator shaft. The cargo hold was empty except for a stack of boxes containing what resembled jetpack-like devices and blue-grey hemispheres the size of an average palm. “Holographic spacesuits. Protects you out there,” Nebula had said the first time they stumbled across the boxes.
. Yes, a hundred times, yes, Steve. Please—” His voice cracks when Steve unzips his trousers with finesse and skilled, eager fingers slip inside to cup his erection.
“Steve,” Tony shouts and comes hard in the other man’s mouth, shuddering from the sheer force of his orgasm, his lungs heaving for air. Steve works Tony through the aftershocks, licking him clean until he pushes Steve away from his wet, oversensitive cock.
He recalled simpler times with Steve: Settling into the Tower between missions, staying up late in matching pyjamas and coffee mugs in hands while it snowed outside, changing the tire on Steve’s motorbike, the smell of grease in his nostrils and the oil stains caught on cheap, dollar-store t-shirts, dragging Steve away from a farmer’s market before his outrage at the price of onions—“How can anyone charge $5 for this, Tony? This is a daylight robbery!”—boiled over into a fistfight.
On some level, the Avengers reminded Tony of the nebulae lurking in distant corners of an endless universe: violent celestial reactions that pushed matter together to grow larger, and hotter, becoming unstable, and eventually fusing into new stars, then planets to solar systems. When the first call to assemble came, the gravity of the situation—Loki’s invasion—pulled them together, like clumped matter, and from the scorching heat of repulsors and plasma cannons, and a blazing nuclear explosion set against the impenetrable depths of deep space, the Avengers were born.
“You think someone will come for us?”
“I’m sorry. I am so sorry,” Tony said in a whisper when the video stopped and the holographic projection switched off, leaving them in semi-darkness.
“What do you need?” Steve says, with his trademark Captain America smile, his face inches away, and Tony's brain short-circuits.
Steve allows him only a few seconds to recuperate, long enough to take the edge off before he swallows around Tony’s cock again, taking him deeper. Tony whimpers at the way his erection grazes the back of Steve's throat; he catches Steve staring and struggles to look away, hypnotised by the way Steve’s eyes roll back as he hums around the solid length. Moments later, Steve guides Tony’s hands to the back of his head, a silent plea written across his face.
He is nervous.
— FIN —
“Hey Cap,” Tony says, his lips stretched into a taut line. His eyes search for a safe spot to stare because every visible part of Steve, including the man's flushed, sweat-soaked skin, his bulging arms, the carved ridges of his torso — more impressive than anything the Greek sculptors could have ever envisioned — and the way the grey slacks cling to his hips and thighs, sends Tony's mind to places that threaten to throw him off his orbit. He's straight, he's spent most of his life dating women and yet—Steve puts him out of his misery with a sheepish grin and picks up the discarded black tank from the floor.
Tony shook his head. The bowl of orange liquid next to him was left untouched. “Not really. It was a long shot—I tried to send a message back to Earth, but I don’t think it worked.”
Tony swallowed. His throat felt parched. He last had a sip of water before recording his eighth message two days earlier. Nebula had insisted her mechanical modifications could sustain her without water a lot longer than Tony could survive, but he conserved their limited supply anyway. A subconscious part of him tried speeding up the inevitable.
By the time Tony enters the gym, Steve's stopped taking out his frustrations over the Dodgers’ defeat on the punching bag — he stands next to the bag, shirtless and sweating, wearing only a pair of grey slacks that leaves very few things to Tony’s imagination.
“I love him,” Tony said in a brief moment of clarity. “I love him. I’d have done everything for him. He was my world, all of it, but he left. Never even looked back once. The bastard.” He swallowed the bitterness rising at the back of his throat, sharp, piercing; Steve's retreating back, the way his arm had slung around Barnes, steadying him and supporting his weight, floated behind Tony's eyelids. The choice still stung.
The clothes were three sizes too big on Tony. The red tunic slid off his shoulders, revealing collarbones. Nebula observed him with glazed curiosity, watched his every move inside the spacecraft until one day, after almost two weeks onboard, she said, “You’re not like him. You’re different.”
Nebula’s eyes, black and bug-like, flashed. The metal casing around her left eye jutted out with a pop. A small holographic projection of Thanos appeared. “I’ll show you,” she said.
“Who were you talking to?” Nebula asked hours later when they sat down to eat. She was back to her firm, expressionless self. “Earlier, I saw you talking to your helmet. Were you calling for help?”
Steve looks wrecked when he gets to his feet and crowds into Tony’s personal space — as if he had been the one getting off. “That was...that was
, he thinks to himself. While Steve never hid his preferences in partners from the team, once, after plenty of prodding and poking from the Spy Twins, he had confessed he was not ready for intimacy. Adjusting to the 21st century was hard enough, a relationship would only complicate matters, Steve had said.
Tony pushes Steve off his cock and glances down. The other man is a sinful sight — his hair's a mess, his face, hot and red, his pupils blown wide with arousal, his lips swollen and chin dripping with saliva. “What's wrong?” Steve says in a husky tone as Tony digs his nails into his palms to stop himself from coming. “Too close,” Tony whispers, resting his head against the wall with his eyes closed.
Firm hands on his cheeks force Tony to look up. The warm, inviting look on Steve’s face overwhelm Tony’s senses, claws at his insides, and he lets out a keening sob. “I got you, Tony,” Steve says, full of reassurances in his voice and bearing none of the earlier bravadoes.
. He would’ve felt at home with you.”
“We’ll figure something out,” Tony said, kneeling in front of her. Inhaling deeply, he reached for her hands,
Tony regretted asking as soon as the first scream pierced the ship’s silence. A scene played out of Thanos taking Nebula apart, piece by piece, with a manic glint in his eyes. When Thanos pushed something that resembled industrial tongs—his mind flashed to a collection of those hanging on the walls in his workshop—into Nebula’s mouth and pulled a portion of her tongue out, Tony's tolerance peaked. Blue liquid gushed over purple hands, her screams reduced to pained whimpers. He closed his eyes, stooped lower in his seat—everything about the scene sounded familiar. Intimately, so. Images of a dark cave smelling of gunpowder and the insides of a lavatory flickered in his mind; he remembered the cold gnawing at his skin, rough and parched, covered in bruises. His water-filled lungs had felt like lead pressing down on his spine whenever he lay down while the wound, the gaping hole at the centre of his chest, raw and smelling of cheap, store-bought disinfectant, screamed in protest. He shuddered at the memory.
A voice cut her off. “Tony Stark. Is Tony Stark with you?”
Steve’s lips curl into a frown as he over his shoulders. “As much as I enjoyed our little pretence, I think you're overplaying your hand here, Tony. I gave you a blowjob because you asked for one, let's not drag this out and make it awkward.” Tony shakes his head and hurries forward, reaching for Steve’s hand on the door handle.
, Tony tells himself.
come, and the thought stirs his worn-out nerves.
Tony stopped counting time after the third week adrift in interstellar space.
The intricacies of Quill’s ship occupied Tony’s mind during most of his waking hours — it was only the second alien spacecraft he had encountered. Under normal circumstances, Tony would’ve lost his mind with excitement, forgoing daily routine in favour of studying the otherworldly tech until he fell asleep on his feet. The ship had escaped Thanos’ wrath on Titan unscathed, without so much as a scratch. Its occupants ran out of luck, crumbling into scattered ash on the planet’s surface, doomed to remain there forever.
Nebula looked down at her hands. Tony remained wary of the slender, metallic fingers. Images of cold, unfeeling metal on pale, warm skin flashed across the periphery of his vision, leaving him reeling, and raw. He cast a quick glance at the hand in question. It was damaged from the fight—the articulated joints were banged up, he could tell, from the way Nebula struggled with her grip. The knowledge helped Tony sleep better.
Once he is inside the lift, Tony shuffles his weight from toe to toe, clasps and unclasps his hands into fists, and bites into the dry cracks on his lower lips, tasting the metallic tang of blood.
Tony enjoyed the darkness behind his eyes. The lack of oxygen quietened his mind for once, leaving it blank, and listless. It felt peaceful. He heard Nebula’s movements—she slipped into the pilot seat, trying to work out the buttons that would open a line to whoever had come for them. For a brief second, Tony considered the possibility of their would-be rescuers being hostile, bloodthirsty aliens—the kind he used to enjoy rattling off by name every time he made Steve sit down to watch his list of favourite science fiction films. The Rathtars were a particularly nasty breed…
When they break apart, Tony grabs onto Steve to steady himself. The awkwardness grows between them, hanging thick in the gym’s warm, crisp air. Steve shrugs and offers a small smile. “Well, this was fun while it lasted,” he says, wiping his mouth on his t-shirt. “I hope that was enough of a demonstration to please your guy.” He pats Tony's shoulders and drags his feet towards the exit.
“Good. Yeah, all good, really good.” That's all Tony manages until he tears his gaze away from Steve and looks at the cold, carpeted floor. With his hands jammed into his pockets, Tony's mind works in overdrive as it tries to articulate why he cancelled a day’s worth of meetings at Stark Industries, flew from Los Angeles to New York, and ended up in the gym alone with Steve Rogers.
Nebula’s voice floated across the radio. “This is the Benatar. We are stranded, we are out of food and water, and we are a man down. We need medical assistance and—”
, a defiant part of him shouted in deafening silence.
“I need your help,” he says and deflates, shoulders hunching until a pair of firm hands grip the bony blades and Tony's forced to look into a pair of brilliant blue eyes.
sinking in on several levels. He focused on the big picture, the damage done to entire galaxies out there because the smaller, more intimate details felt like a thousand little cuts on soft, pliant flesh.
Tony waits for the rejection to come; he waits for Steve to burst out laughing at the fact that he would even think himself worthy to have something with Captain America.
Tony trails off; he almost misses the way Steve smirks and stalks forward.
“Come on, you're Tony Stark, this is
Of all the times Tony's received blowjobs, he decides this
to say is that I'm a quick learner. It's how I got my PhD at 20.”
!” Tony shouts as pleasure shoots up his spine, setting his nerves on fire. It threatens to overwhelm him. If anyone had been passing by the gym, Tony's sure they'd have heard him, and, frankly, he's beyond caring—Steve's mouth feels like a delicious vice around his cock, and Tony wants to lose himself in there forever.
, melted into little clumps, sticky, powdery, and unappetizing.
,” and stomps into the living area, where he finds Thor lounging on one of the large, expensive sofas, the ones meant for hosting world leaders and other dignitaries when they drop by the Avengers headquarters. Not for—for whatever the fuck Thor's laughing at on his phone, but Tony's nerves are too frayed for a confrontation.
“Steve, if you’re still out there, you must re-assemble the team. You can’t give up. Thanos can’t win. You
“Is that what you're gonna do Tony?” Steve drawls. Tony belatedly recognises the hard edge in his voice as jealousy. “Gonna suck his cock once I teach you how to? Don't worry—” Steve's hand slides down to Tony’s groin; skilled fingers rub along his half-hard length through his pants, pulling needy, desperate moans from the back of his throat. Steve lowers his voice into a whisper: “I'll teach you
together.”
sounds erotic, the way Steve's voice starts off low, then crests several octaves higher, followed by a quick, slapping touch of skin on leather, and the whole thing repeats in sync. Again, and again and again. Tony pauses in his steps and swallows.
"For who?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Trust me," Tony said, putting a comforting hand on Steve's arm. His muscles tightened for a split second but relaxed quick enough for Tony not to feel the need to pull his hand away. "Out of all the embarrassing stories that someone could have out there about themselves, that one is probably the least embarrassing."
The most logical explanation that she could come up with was that there was an accident in Bruce and Tony's lab. The floor number made sense and it wasn't without precedent. There had been accidents there before – the most notable one being the time when Dum-E knocked a canister of chlorine gas into a window made of unbreakable glass, causing the tank to crack and releasing the gas – but even those times there hadn't been an ordered evacuation of the whole building. Lara's teeth clenched as she thought of everything on Earth that could possibly elicit that sort of response. It was very long and wasn't pretty. It even got worse when she considered that the bio-hazard wasn't from Earth.
Remember kids, don't mess with the deep web. The best-case scenario as to how it ends is that Homeland Security shows up to haul you off to Gitmo. THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO!
"Right away, Sir." Tony looked back at the other three, who were still lingering.
With all of this in mind, it made what happened to Tony make the slightest bit more sense. Add to that his celebrity and notoriety – which made him a household name – and the perfect recipe for a sordid controversy came together almost perfectly. It was a piece of gossip no one could resist, and almost everyone had to see for themselves in order to believe; Tony Stark was gay, and footage of him having sex with another man existed to prove it. All that had to be done to see proof was to pop a VHS into a tape player, and once convinced, for the person to pass the tape on to someone else.
"Stark!" Steve tried to look around for Tony, but he found himself distracted by the massive amount of damage that the explosion had done to the engine turbine. The hull had been completely torn off, making it as clear as day how far of a drop it was to the ground. Steve could have sworn that he was higher up than he was when he crashed the plane into the Arctic. "Stark, I'm here!" He tried to call into the coms again.
"It also doesn't have a very good success rate," Bruce said. "A person is more likely to distance themselves from those closest to them after an intervention than to actually seek help."
"It won't kill you immediately," he finally settled on. "You might get heart disease from it in sixty years if you start eating this stuff regularly. Otherwise, one burger shouldn't kill you." Steve didn't seem entirely convinced but took another bite of the sandwich anyway.
"It's just a hug," they insisted. "When am I ever gonna get a chance to hug a guy who looks like Iron Man again?"
"Sure, I do," Tony said. "Your buddy Nick like that I told him that I didn't want to join his half-assed version of the Justice League of America and sent you to spy on me. What more is there to understand?"
Once inside, Dr. Cranston shut the door behind him, and Tony paused for a moment to get a look at the place. The atmosphere was the epitome of calm with its cool earth tones and the various plants dotted around the room providing natural, fresh, clean air. The wall opposite the door was made up entirely of bookshelves, containing volume upon volume of medical and psychiatric manuals. A desk sat perpendicular to the bookshelves that was neatly put together but held all the tell-tale signs of well-use like coffee mug rings and worn edges.
"He's not slowing down." Tony might have the armor protecting him, but Steve doubted that he could walk away from a fall like that unscathed. Beside him, Thor began to swing his hammer, but it was taking too long. There was no way he could get to Tony before he hit the ground. Fortunately, they had a Hulk.
"No," Bruce said. "Of course not. Although technically Betty isn't married yet, I would never…"
Loki looked on in awe. The chaos, the destruction… This was all his doing. Soon, Midgard would be his and from there, onto Asgard. His victory was within the mile. He could already see it. Absolutely nothing could stop him now.
The rest of the meeting went about as well as one would expect. They argued the same points over and over, barely anything of significance was said, and eventually, they had to call it a day without having gotten anything done. So, an average Tuesday. However, Tony was able to glean a few small tidbits of information about the police investigation thanks to the big mouths of the board members. Not only was Fair keeping tabs on what the cops were doing, but two other board members – Lucille Hinson and Elisha Jameson – were as well. From Hinson, he learned that the police believed the robbery happened sometime between noon and four PM on Saturday, and from Jameson, he had learned that one of the locks indeed had been opened with a passcode, but a second lock had been smashed until the door came open. That gave him a timeframe and an idea of what to be looking for since he and Pepper hadn't been allowed to see the crime scene. It wasn't much, but it was a start.
"Stark is safe and with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent." If Hill said anything more after that, Steve didn't hear it. He let out a breath of complete relief.
"Certainly."
"Of course, I didn't," Freeman said. "I was only thinking of the good of the church."
"I'm not dying," he assured. "I feel great. Haven't even coughed since yesterday."
"And you don't see them making bio-weapons," Bruce said. "Most sensible teachers save that for high school."
"And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark," Steve said.
"Funny things are," Tony said. Steve could feel a vein somewhere in his forehead twitch.
"That's what Tony said on the phone," he said. "I thought he might've been downplaying it."
"I don't think I have much of a choice, Nat," Clint said.
"Why?" Tony knew what he was asking, but Steve took it another way.
"That was the CDC," she said. "Tony's blood test came back clean along with Steve's and Romanoff's."
"Fury." Carol started to approach them while Fury gestured to the woman next to him.
"Well, I was thinking of using 'Space Face' or 'Care Bear', but 'Killer Queen' does have a certain ring to it." Carol laughed.
"I don't give a damn about what I deserve," Steve said. "What I care about is what you deserve, and that is someone who will stick by you no matter what." He took Tony's hand. "If you want to get sober, I'll help you. If you relapse, I'll be right there to help you set yourself straight again. I promise that I'll always be there for you." A tear spilled over and dribbled down Tony's cheek.
"Right…" he said. "So, what would someone want to cross a bio-weapon with?"
"Uh, I think Tony wants to talk to you about that himself," Bruce said. "No offense, but it's really only his news to share."
So, he and Pepper were still at odds, which considerably soured Tony's mood. Then there was the fact that his personal assistant was out fighting to keep her ex away from her. As annoying as Lara could be, Tony still enjoyed her company and not having her there would make things a little bit harder, but at least he was expecting her not to be there. What he was not expecting was the person who walked straight into his office without even knocking.
The countertop was the heaviest piece of the bar. The rest of it was made from a lightweight, yet strong wood, so Tony could easily handle taking it apart on his own. However, he didn't stop Steve from helping him. In fact, he appreciated the help. It made things go faster and it felt a lot easier than when he was doing it on his own. Not to mention he got to surreptitiously observe his shirtless boyfriend while he worked. Oh, the fantasies that sparked…
"Stark Industries was robbed?" She narrowed her gaze as a look of surprise came over his face. She didn't think that was possible.
"I can do this for you," she said. "Let me do this for you."
Obviously, she could remember meeting Tony. Again, that fell into the most recent three week period of solid memories. The rest of it, however, she was kind of fuzzy on. Her earliest childhood memories were completely gone. She only remembered the bare facts about her life before the Kree. (Who her parents were, her brothers' names, the town she grew up in, where she went to high school, when she joined the Air Force, etc., etc.) Even after the Kree, there was something off about some of her memories. Some of them seemed too faded; distant, while others felt all too real. To put it bluntly she had big gaps in her memory that she couldn't explain and the memories she did have she wasn't sure if she could trust. That really quite complicated things, especially when she had strangers pressing her for answers.
That was true. As soon as she got the message (and some pants on,) Carol was in the air. The location trace on the pager had sent her to Avengers Tower and when she realized that her heart almost stopped. Over the past two weeks, when Carol wasn't spending time with her niece and her best friend, she had been doing research into the so-called "Battle of New York." Fury had given her the short version, but she had wanted to find out the true extent of it all.
"Yeah," Stark said. "Who else would I be?"
"No," Steve said. "Will you be alright going in there on your own?" Tony's eyebrows knitted together.
"So, are you finally going to tell me who got infected, or are you just going to waste my time like everyone else?" Natasha remained silent. Sharpton sighed. "You know, I don't know what you people are waiting for. I've already confessed, so if you just tell me if anyone's been infected…"
"Your worth." Loki was then thrown from the asteroid, just barely lucky enough to hit the ground of the larger asteroid below it. The wind was completely knocked out of him and he struggled for a few seconds to breathe. As far as he could tell, the vertebra that he had just repaired was now once again broken. Pain shot across his body at a mind-numbing pace. Loki fought to keep his head above water as darkness creeped in the edges of his vision.
Steve glanced back over to Natasha. As their eyes connected, they exchanged determined, knowing nods before springing back into the fight. Steve had no idea if this would work, but they still had to try. None of them were going to let the Earth go down without a fight.
I'm not going to lie, I am not a fan of Barrack Obama. I wasn't when he was President and I'm still not now, but does anyone else miss him? Like, I actually miss having a normal individual who knows when to shut their mouth as President. God, why did we take that for granted?
picky.
"Good to hear," she said before getting to her feet. "Alright, I think we've had enough chit-chat boys. We've already wasted a good fifteen minutes and we've got an elaborate space-opera to sit through."
"Because you're drunk and I'm completely sober," Lara said. "Besides, it's my job to help you and I think not letting you make a drunken ass of yourself counts as helping!"
"Yup," Laura said with a nod.
Seven rings…
"Come in," Adoniram called. The door opened, and a short, redheaded woman stepped in. "To what do I owe the pleasure, Sister Grace?"
"It's still my fault," Lara muttered.
"Unfortunately," Lara agreed.
Tony looked up just in time to see the shock etched on Pepper's face as she slid through the door and into the room. She could not open it all the way because there were a couple of boxes placed in front of it. Both were marked as "S.H.I.E.L.D." and "Deliver to the care of Anthony Stark." They were only placed in front of the door because it was the only few square inches of the floor not covered by paper. Pepper looked around, mouth agape, before looking right at Tony.
"Then you should be out," Fury remarked as he stepped closer. "Celebrating, seeing the world." Steve resisted the urge to scoff at that, instead choosing to step away and unwrap the athletic tape from around his hands.
"My professor," Laura clarified.
"Can you please stop snapping? It's creepy." It took a moment for Clint to recognize the voice as Tony Stark's – the only person who had been brought into isolation with him – and that it was coming from behind a vinyl sheet that was separating them.
"No, you don't." Tony dropped his pacifying smile.
"I know," she said. "I work in law enforcement, too, so believe me when I tell you that without a doubt in my mind, the person who attacked me was Dante Conroy."
Tony highly doubted that, but even he knew not to down talk the men and women who were responsible for tending to the entire city every time an alien army appeared in the sky. If worse came to worst, it'd get back to them and they'd let him flatline the next time he got hurt trying to save them. Still, that didn't stop him from double-checking.
"Not on this floor," the AI responded. "But there is one upstairs in Agent Romanoff's room."
. That's kind of fucked, but not surprising given that you never go into work!"
The hotel suites were grouped together in fours. Bruce's and Natasha's suites were on one side, while Tony and Steve's and Clint's were on the other. Lara's and Freeman's were in the next grouping further down the hall. The first door they went to be the one diagonally across from Tony and Steve's suite; Bruce's suite. Lara knocked on the door with the same ferocity she used when she knocked on the bathroom door. Steve didn't even try to stop her.
"Of course not," Dante said with a voice full of pure disgust. "I would never follow a false profit."
Steve managed to get him to eat a few crackers, but outside of that, Tony refused to eat. It was his own fault, but regardless he could not force anything more than that down. So, he ended up not eating dinner, instead opting to curl up in a ball on the bed and writhe in pain while Steve gently ran his fingers through his hair. That was nice enough, but it was somewhat soured by the fact that because of the pain, Tony had not gotten any sleep that night.
"Tell them the truth," Tony said. "I'm only sneaking out to save the hassle of having to check out and check back in again." Conroy opened her mouth to speak again, but Tony cut her off. "And before you ask, if the dictators of any third-world countries die, celebrate as much as you like, just don't leave that spot."
"Why do you care?" Tony asked.
Before anyone could say anything else, they were distracted by a bright flash of lightning that could clearly be seen from the Quinjet's windshield. It was extremely loud and incredibly close, so close that if it were possible for someone to climb out onto the plane's wings and reach out, they could probably touch it. What was worse was that it was followed up by several more lightning strikes, all of which were in frightening proximity to the plane.
"It appears the facility has been broken into." Tony's eyes went wide, and his breath escaped his lungs. "The LA County Sherriff's Department, FBI, and ATF have been contacted. The complex is under a code blue lockdown situation."
Thor tried for what seemed like the eighty-seventh time in the past two minutes to smash Mjolnir through the glass. Once again it didn't work. Loki couldn't help but be amused by that. What was that mortal saying? "Insanity was doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results?" Well, that certainly fit Thor. However, apparently, Thor had managed to weaken the glass to the point where it finally cracked. The force of the hit also caused one of the metal clamps holding the cage in place to come off. There were still several more clamps located around the glass prison, so thankfully the whole thing wouldn't come apart just yet. Loki let out a laugh.
"No offence to you or your Agent, Commander," he said. "But no one's gotten Sharpton to talk. Not even your other agents. What makes you think she'll be able to get something out of her?"
"What about violation of a restraining order?" All eyes went to Lara, who was turning around, pulling herself away from the wall. "Can he face any charges on that?" The lawyer raised an eyebrow.
"I have tried," Lara said. "Steve has tried. Pepper has tried. Rhodes has tried. Hell, JARVIS has tried. None of us have gotten through to him. While, yes, I do recognize that my most recent attempt hurt more than it helped – and I do intend to apologize for that – it doesn't change the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. could have intervened a lot sooner and that could have made the difference."
"I have been in direct communication with him," the AI responded. "So yes, I'm sure."
"And you had a suit of armor to help you with that," Lara pointed out as she poured herself a glass of sparkling water. Unfortunately, she couldn't participate in any of the festivities involving alcohol, but she could always pretend. "I, meanwhile, had no protection and ended up with a second-degree burn on my palm." She held up the wounded hand in question, showing a big, dark, red mark right between her palm and the heel of her hand. It looked like it was starting to heal, but it was obviously very painful for her to ordinary tasks, given how she was wincing as she poured herself a drink.
"Not really," Lara said.
"It was good seeing you again." Bruce said.
"We can't be sure that Subarian was telling the truth," Hill admitted. "If the virus is still active, though, I'd rate her chances as better than most."
"Well, don't they," Tony said. "Don't you?"
"What the hell?" Tony started to stand up.
Part of this chapter is taken from New Avengers #14 by Brian Michael Bendis. All credit goes to him, but the person you probably want to behead for this is me. You know, seeing as I was too chicken to officially identify the character until the end.
"I'm fine," Tony said. "Perfectly fine."
"Would you rather we resort to a game of 'I know you are, but what am I?'" Lara rolled her eyes.
"Well, yes." Knežević had to resist the urge to slam his head on the dashboard. "Don't worry about it. I've done this before. I won't get caught."
to go home."
"I…" Freeman spoke slowly, sweat forming on his brow. "I think they could be an asset to us."
So, there are some real-life public figures that make cameo appearances in this chapter. I don't have their explicit permission to use their image in any way and if they or someone who works with them has a problem with this, please DM me from an official account over Twitter. My handle is MewWinx96 and I will remove any reference to them within this chapter if asked.
"Come on," she said. "Let's get out of the way."
"I'm fine," Tony said dryly. "How are you?"
As she walked out of the bathroom, Lara felt all-too tempted to flop back down on the guest bed and go right back to sleep. It wasn't because she was tired (honestly, she felt more well-rested than she ever had in her life) but more because she just didn't want to have to go through this day. It was already shaping up to be a nightmare from hell and it wasn't even eight AM. The worst part was that she could hardly even come up with a bright side to the situation. Even the weather outside was miserable, which only served to add to the grim tone of the day.
A very drunk Tony got into an argument with Steve and snuck out of the hotel room. What's going to happen to him now?
"I know," Natasha said. "And there's nothing I can say to justify it. I let myself get carried away and by the time that I put two and two together, things went to shit."
"This is, uh, this." Tony hit a button and the holographic screens came to life with the display images showing the files that Coulson had brought with him. On the far left, the images and tactical info about a Dr. Bruce Banner (A.K.A. the Hulk) were displayed, along with news footage from the fight that destroyed half of Harlem the previous year. On the far right, there were more images and tactical info, this time about a man by the name of Thor Odinson. Accompanying Thor's profile was grainy video surveillance footage of the man taking on a giant killer robot in the middle of a suburban street. Then there was the file in the dead center…
"Now, while we wait for everyone to be ready, why don't we go ahead down the line here and have you all introduced yourselves? Like in elementary school, just give your real name, your codename, and just a random detail about yourself." Everyone seemed to agree with that. "Why don't we start with you, Mr. Barton?"
"No," he asserted. "Nothing happened last night. Tony asked me to stay with him and that's what I did. We slept in the same bed and that's all." Pepper let out a breath that she must have been holding.
"Hi." The stress in Pepper's voice was apparent, even over the phone. "I was just speaking to the agent in charge…"
"Are you sure I'm the one you should be saying that to?" Tony gestured to Lara, who looked close to passing out again; barely even acknowledging what was going on around her.
"The report you saw," she said. "Wasn't the one I wrote. I rejected you on the grounds that I didn't think you were mentally healthy enough to handle being on a team like the Avengers. I don't know who changed it or why, but the point is that you might be proving
Across the table, Steve glanced up at Tony with a concerned look. Tony did his best to give his newly-acquired boyfriend a reassuring smile but found he couldn't be quite convincing enough. Tony beat him to the punch before he could say anything.
Tony, however, wasn't having it. As soon as Steve started lowering him onto the bench, Tony started resisting, pushing Steve away and attempting to stand up.
"Jess!" she called as she broke out into a sprint, coming towards her. "What happened? What's going on?"
While on Xandar, Tarquan had inadvertently learned of a place within the galaxy that housed some of the galaxy's more criminal elements… It was also rumored that anything one searched for could be found on this space station, they just had to know where. Tarquan told the other Raël of this and they agreed it was worth a shot. If they didn't find someone who knew of an uninhabited, life-sustaining planet, they'd surely find something else that would aid in their cause.
"Uh, yeah, hi," Banner said as he walked over and took the offered hand. "They told me you would be coming."
"Stark!" Natasha called out. "We're back! Loki's in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and he won't be getting out any time soon." Tony pulled back and looked at Steve, slightly disappointed.
"Sorry," Tony said as he let go of the appendage. "You okay?"
Salinas then opened the door and walked out, leaving Adoniram alone in his study once again. He took a deep breath in and out. The playing field had just changed radically. However, he had been prepared for this, so it didn't come as a total surprise. He needed a moment to process all the changes and events. God, old age was making him weary.
"So, what should we do?" Bruce asked. "I mean, does anyone have any idea of how to help him?"
"She worked in the tuberculosis ward at the hospital," Steve said. "She was a nurse and encountered it all the time. She'd never gotten sick before, but I guess her luck ran out. That day, she fell into a coughing fit so bad, she passed out. Her co-workers got her to a bed and the lead doctor in the ward diagnosed her. I found out eventually and tried to visit her, but no one would let me. She was sick for weeks before she finally passed." Comfortingly, Natasha put a hand on his knee, which paused in it's bouncing.
"Just like you said."
"Already one step ahead of you, Stark." Romanoff too had pulled out her phone. However, she had started covertly surfing the web under the table as soon as Freeman had introduced Salinas. "Eduardo Salinas, born on April 28th, 1965. He's a Congressman representing New Jersey's Tenth District and the son of Mexican immigrants. He was chairman for Newark's Urban Health Advisory Committee and founded the Essex County Instruction Program for Pre-School Youth in 1994. He was elected to Congress in 2008."
"I think you might be right."
Unsurprisingly, it was Carol. She had managed to stop herself before she flew into the next wall, saving it from complete destruction. She cleared a bunch of debris out of the way and stepped through the hole she had created. Looking around, she blew a loose strand of hair out of her face and tucked it back behind her ear.
"No, they're discriminating against me specifically," Tony said.
A sharp pang ran through Steve's heart. Grief was not as easy to push back as guilt. He used Tony's words to ground himself in the present.
"Is that what you were talking about when you said, 'Barton got anthraxed?'" Steve asked.
." Dante's voice was firm, but the fact that he wouldn't make eye contact left Lara unconvinced.
"What?" Tony struggled to find the right person to make eye contact with. "You can't? I think I live here or something?"
"But she said you were dead," Nina cried. "That Homeland Security lady said you were dead."
That aside, that gave him two hours to look through four hours of video footage hoping to catch something from the break-in. He knew the police had probably already gone through it by now, but he still at least wanted it confirmed or denied whether it was an employee once and for all. That way he could just fire them, press charges and be done with it.
"You're never too much." Tony looked down and his frown deepened.
They took the express elevator directly up to the penthouse. The foyer and the hallways were unsurprisingly empty. Stark and Banner were likely working, and Steve was probably doing whatever he did when he wasn't making out with Stark. It wasn't like they had been expecting a whole parade for their homecoming and they were fine with that. Clint needed to rest, anyway. He didn't need too much excitement. Natasha pushed Clint through the hallways and along with Happy, boarded the local elevator. She hit the button for the second floor and waited patiently for the doors to open again.
"Not for another hour," Tony pointed out. Lara pulled her phone out of the messenger bag at her hip.
"They're probably stuck in traffic," she explained. "Since when were you this impatient?"
"How?" Tony asked.
"Wha…? Oh, don't worry about that." Lara shook her head.
"No, no," she said. "I'm just asking questions."
"Save it," he said. "Just don't talk to me and we won't have any problems." He then increased his pace to get ahead of her. Natasha frowned.
"I'd like to speak to Mr. Stark," the officer said. Pepper opened her mouth to argue why he couldn't, but he stopped her dead in her tracks by saying "I know he's here. Miss Conroy told us where we could find him when contacting him by phone failed."
"Still, that wasn't a good thing to have to go through." She brushed the back of her hand against the back of his in a comforting gesture.
"No," she said. "I shouldn't have asked that of you, period."
"Last September," Fury said.
"We're not trying to sell you anything," Carl said. "What we are giving you is the key to unlock your full potential; to awaken you truly to the whole being that you are. Wouldn't you like to become whole again?"
Steve Rogers is not oblivious. In fact, he's usually good at figuring out people's character and intentions; who to trust and who not to trust, things like that. However, if you flashed a bright red neon sign in front of his window that read – in capital letters no less – "THIS IS A DATE" and bought every billboard in the City of New York and changed them to read – in capital letters, once again – "STEVE ROGERS, TONY STARK IS TAKING YOU OUT ON A DATE TONIGHT" Steve still probably wouldn't have gotten it.
Little did he know; his feelings were in for another whammy. At the other microphone, the next person to step up was a dark-skinned woman in her early-to-mid-twenties. Her hair was done in dreadlocks and she was wearing all white. She cleared her throat before speaking up.
"You don't have to give us that look," Natasha said.
Steve didn't believe it, but he didn't necessarily have to in order to calm down. Even if Natasha couldn't promise that it did somehow make him feel better to hear someone say it. Having the assurance and support of others was a huge comfort. Looking up, Steve could see Natasha's concerned yet reassuring expression mirrored on Clint and Bruce's faces. He could even see that Lara had eyes on him, despite the fact that the dog was trying to nudge her glasses away from her face and lick her eyeball. Steve found himself taking a full, deep breath. Then he took another and another until he felt in control of his body. He stood up straight and spoke much more solidly.
Carol tried insisting yet again that she was fine to stand on her own and take off her clothes herself, but again the nurses didn't want to risk irritating any potential internal injuries, so she had to remain strapped down while they cut off what remained of her clothes. It was degrading, but at least they did it in relative privacy, the nurse who did it was another woman, and she was quickly covered with a johnny. After that, she was wheeled to another part of the hospital where they kept the MRI and X-ray machines.
"So, I take it he's just inviting us in to attack him?" Tony questioned. "Classy, but I suppose I might as well take him up on the offer." Right as he said that, one of the repulsor jets near his feet briefly went out before sputtering back to life. "Not like I have much of a choice."
"Alright," he said. "I understand. I'm sorry, Brother, for even thinking that in the first place. Can you forgive me?"
"Dr. Banner," Hill said. "Dr. Samson is here to assist you."
"How do I know that's really him?" he questioned. "How do I know that this isn't some shady spy trick?"
Natasha sighed as she looked up. Steve was walking by her bed for what seemed like the fortieth time. That was probably forty too many. Knowing what she had to do, Natasha got up off the bed and moved to follow him.
"You're not going to help me?" She scoffed at the thought.
"I haven't thrown up since then," Tony defended. "Well, I mean, my stomach is still messed up, but I don't think I'm going to throw up any time soon."
"Therapy's not guaranteed to work," Steve pointed out.
"We were walking back to the hotel last night and I spotted him in an alleyway eating half of a cold pizza out of a box," he explained. "Clearly you can see how emaciated he is and he doesn't have any tags. I think someone sold off all his brothers and sisters, but couldn't sell him because of his leg, so instead, they just abandoned him." Lara narrowed her eyes in confusion.
"Sorry," he said. "This is all we've got."
a certified creep. I mean, what kind of grown man sleeps in the same bed as a young boy that isn't his child?"
"Screw you," was all Oswin could offer in response. She turned and began to stomp down the highway without looking back. Knežević didn't try to chase her further. Instead, he just shouted at her retreating form.
"Because that's what you're supposed to say when someone blames themselves?" Stark guessed. "Would you rather I say, 'fuck you, asshole?'"
After accidentally poisoning Tony Stark, Jessica has called her friend Carol for help. Can they manage to save his life?
"You never know," Carol said with a light-hearted note in her voice. "Alright, get off your butt. You need to get to calling Hill and Fury.
"I just want to be sure that he didn't leave," Natasha responded.
Still no response. Steve pressed his back against the wall and slid down until he was sitting on the floor.
. At the last second, he chickened out and backed away. He didn't know why. Usually when he kissed a guy or girl, he went for it without a second thought. This time, though, he hesitated, and he wished he hadn't. It gave him a second to think about what he was about to do and that one second was enough to make him change his mind. He had no idea how Steve would react or even if he felt the same way. Besides, he was still trying to come to terms with the fact that it was okay to be gay now. Kissing him would only upset him and Tony didn't want to do that. So, he backed away, rolled to the other side of the bed, and pulled the covers over his face to hide his shame. He didn't talk to Steve about it the next morning and put off calling or texting him for most of the week. That was, until last night.
“Where's Cap?” He asks.
Without tearing his gaze away from the device in his hands, Thor says, “Gym. His team lost.”
“Steve,” Tony whimpers.
The question gave Tony pause as he fought off the lethargy settling between his joints to wrap his head around it. Did he love Steve Rogers?
Steve.
Tony had committed to memory the solid frame of Steve’s body, which anchored him to the mattress underneath, exactly where he had always wanted to belong; the scent of peppermint toothpaste on Steve’s breath every morning when he woke Tony up with gentle kisses; lazy summer afternoons spent sprawled on large couches, shirtless and under the cool blast from the air conditioners inside the penthouse, away from the sun’s unforgiving glare. Some nights Steve stayed up drawing while Tony slept—in a short time, he had filled a dozen sketchbooks, most of them with pictures of Tony moving through the day.
Tony laughed, mirthless, the sounds echoing off cold, empty walls. Secondary stats displayed on the screen—from the suit’s interface—showed temperature hovered in the low 40s, turning the tips of his fingers and toes blue. Oxygen saturation dropped to 82 percent, his chest tightening as his body put up a valiant fight to pump more breathable air into his lungs.
“He’s… Steve’s complicated,” Tony said, wheezing for breath. His neck and chest felt damp, drops of sweat trickled down the side of his face. “We were a team once. He was—we were. Family. No, wait, that—that doesn’t sound right. We were not family. Were we? We were… we were a time bomb. Someone said it, I don’t know who, but it was true.”
A week later, the oxygen ran out. Nebula forced Tony into one of the holographic spacesuits, holding him through a panic attack as his lungs scrambled for air and as the material sheathed itself around him—skintight and frigid. She held his head on her lap, his weakened, dehydrated body splayed on the floor, covered by three layers of blankets that did little to stop the shivering.
Things went downhill from there in record time. When the smoke receded into the ventilation shafts, Tony took a closer look at the core. Earth physics took him as far as identifying the components making up the reactor but, beyond that, he drew up against a solid, unmoving wall. The technology was alien, the fuel source, unknown, and the spacecraft had stopped moving since the explosion, five days earlier, leaving them stranded. The only direction of time and distance they had was the position of the nebula millions of light years from Titan—when they left the planet, the faint, coloured clouds had been visible from the right side of the cockpit, wispy like morning fog in Winter, and then shifted out of view as they trudged on, homebound.
Tony’s eyes snapped open.
“Steve, it's
“I don’t know what to do,” Tony said, sinking into his seat. “I’ve been preparing for this for years, but Thanos… he wiped us out with a snap. It was child’s play for him.”
“I don’t know what’s going on back home,” he said, rubbing his eyes, sleepiness pooling around the edges of his consciousness. Tony lost track of when he last slept but knew it had been before the plan, to return home, regroup and avenge, exploded in his face. “Can’t be anything good. It’s madness out here. This ship is pretty much done for. The power core collapsed, and we have no way of finding help because I’m not sure if there’s anyone left to help. The guy who owned the ship is dead. A bloke from Missouri. He loved
Tony obliges—he isn't sure if he can refuse what Steve wants,
Tony puffed his chest out, forcing the limited oxygen inside the suit down his windpipe. They were down to the last pair of suits, which would buy him another 24 hours of breathable air, then it would be the end. He’d die two years short of 50. Whatever gamble Strange took by trading the time stone for his life would’ve come to naught—half the universe would stay dead and Peter would never grow up to vote or legally buy booze. For months on board the Benatar, Tony survived knowing he needed to fix what Thanos broke; if not for anyone else, he needed to do it for Peter. He owed the kid that much. But sitting at the jaws of death, Tony felt helpless. All he had left was to trust the man with a plan to come through, for Steve Rogers to save the universe.
the dirty tricks, every one of them. First, I am going to show you, get you started with a good demonstration. What do you say?”
Some days, tucked in his berth under a blanket that smelled like wet animal fur, Tony thought about the Avengers—or what was left of them. The process of elimination told him that Vision was, in all likelihood, dead. Thanos cared little about collateral damage; he wouldn’t have hesitated to rip the mind stone from where it sat on Vision’s forehead. Tony sighed; pangs of regret punching at the base of his spine. He shouldn’t have pushed Vision away, even when he couldn’t look him in the eyes and not hear the whoosh of metal in freefall, crashing back to the green, muddy Earth with a thud that made him tremble at his core. Bruce, after missing for years, showed up through a portal and said Thor was dead. The Asgardian had always been a mystery that Tony tried, over and over again, to solve. His very presence had challenged Tony, a man of science, to reconcile the scientific with the myth. He regretted Thor’s demise. Rhodey had been in therapy and Pepper on her way to a board meeting at the exact moment Tony left Earth. Steve lived in Tony’s memories—a jumble of violent, distorted moving images that left him struggling to tell apart what was real, and what was not.
