Steve chuckled. "You know what my friend Clint told me?" He said with a forced smile. "That I should be happy because I was special."
and the alpha skirts around him sinks balls-deep into his cum-filled ass.
Bucky stared up at him with wide-open eyes. Steve internally smiled, he wasn't even being dishonest. He heard the other two snigger behind him and knelt down lasciviously next to his best friend, staring right into his eyes, lips parted and a sudden urgent

"Goodbye Tony. Say hi to Steve for me."
forced yourself on me. When I truly didn't want something, or when things were making me uncomfortable, you stopped. Every time. Even last night, you stopped when you noticed you were hurting me." Steve scooted closer, seeking the reassuring body warmth of his boyfriend. He needed him to be close. He needed them to be fine. He needed Tony to know they were fine. Because they were... "You've always been instinctive—sometimes brutal—in sex but you've also always paid attention, Tony. You've always cared. Don't ever think like that." He wrapped himself around his boyfriend in a comforting embrace.
slowly—twenty-five minutes to be precise—and ignoring the pain in his chest scorching his lungs at each hissing breath he took, as well as the throbbing in his head.
The only thing the alpha does while Bucky has his cock in his mouth and nurses it softly is tracing his finger around his bonding gland, making him shiver every time. It is slow and affectionate and Bucky relishes in his submission and makes it last. The alpha is too tired to deny him that and indulges him. Bucky brings him on the edge several times but stops in time and slows down. It has been a good twenty minutes he's been at it and that he's been soaking the floor with his slick when they hear a rattling noise at the door.
Tony feels the disappointment hitting hard. "Why not?" His voice sounds almost hurt, for some reasons.
He repeated disbelievingly. "Of what?"
One that went way beyond either them.
"Err, one we didn't do anything and besides, Tony's on suppressants anyway. Two, this doesn't mean I'm not into alphas. And three, how do you even know?"
Steve rushed up the stairs, his entire body shivering. He needed.
"Is that what it is?" Steve asked, amusement hinted in his voice. The question wasn't any less genuine though. "Are you punishing me because I won't move in to your place?" Tony leant back, propped on his arms, and unfolded his long legs. He threw his head back when a surprised laugh escaped him at Steve's not so innocent accusation. " 'cause it works..." Steve added softly, mumbling in the collar of his warm coat.
"Wh—what question?" He stammered with a whispering voice.
Tony was very much
There was nothing Tony wanted more than get up and hold Steve in his arms right now. The guy was a little insistent however, his touch repulsed him. "Fuck off, loser." He whispered. "Don't fucking touch me."
"You're not a rapist, Tony. Get this ludicrous idea out of your head now!"
"But they'll make assumptions about you..."
It wasn't even his fault. He had been very decent. He had even pretended to ask Steve a few questions about his essay and had been nice enough to pretend Steve had been the one to help when, frankly, Steve had been much too busy ogling to be of any help. He had no idea what Tony had been writing about and when the questions were asked, he didn't have the time to think about what they meant before Tony was uttering a soft and overly grateful
"I was just wondering..." Tony explains. "You know, if after four years you were still... If you didn't get bored or something... I mean, of each other."
Tony whined against his hand, head leaning into him. "I don't want you to." He croaked out.
Steve was honestly quite proud of his surprise. Breakfast looked amazing, despite the winter cold. He had set up a large blanket and several cushions. There was extra heating too. He had brought pancakes, toasts and bagels. There were jam and cheese and fruits. A thermos of coffee and one of milk. Fruit juices and freshly made pastries. He had even cooked bacon and scrambled eggs that he had kept warm next to the heater.
At some point he heard someone speak out and people laughing. Apparently he had missed one of Fury's rare jokes. Not that he cared but he had always paid attention in class and being caught—even by himself—not listening, made him blush embarrassedly. He suddenly felt self-conscious. He tried to concentrate but the boy brushed a hand through the small hair at the top of his nape and Steve's focus was immediately drawn to his long, entrancing fingers and his charcoal hair, a weird sort of warmth pooling inside. He was fascinated, again, and couldn't keep his eyes off.
Tony shrugged and leant forward. "Well I disagree," he said, elbows propped up on the table and his chin resting on the palms of his hands, "I think we both needed to grow up for it to happen. Maybe the extended pining period was a necessary thing. I'm glad we are where we are now..." He smiled, eyes a little unfocused. "That's cute how you're so oblivious though." He added, looking straight up into Steve's eyes, teasing.
Bucky snorted mirthlessly.
Tony happened to be a really nice guy in fact. Very studious, very curious and interested. The complete opposite to the smug bad boy image people had portrayed in their imagination. He wasn't anything like that. He wasn't a bad boy. He was a genius. He was brilliant. He was funny. (And rich, not that Steve cared the least.)
—for tonight." Natasha took the bottle with a confused smile. She put the bottle away while Tony held a huge bouquet in her direction. "And this is for
They're looking at each other and something happens. Tony has his hand on his bonding gland and it's pulsating, calling for him, begging to be bitten and when did that happen? When did James start to bond with him? Why? And how is that even possible? He's already bonded even if he's never actually bitten Steve. He can feel the bond in the deepest parts of himself.
Steve took his hand and Tony tugged on it, making Steve stumble into his arms. He kissed him again, softly but languorously.
ass, because he's not the one who just came it was Bucky—his mind goes blank and floaty.
know?
Probably.
problem. Loki has long thin legs, a slender figure, tiny hips... There's...
Nothing more was said, to the great disappointment of Schmidt, and Steve was allowed to his seat which he reached quite efficiently, quietly weaving his way in between the tables. Sam gave him a silent smile and nodded approvingly then his expression turned into a concerned frown when he saw the blood on his temple.
He finally let out in a strangled, faltering whisper.
happy. Very happy. Especially this instant, when Steve has just got up from bed and is getting prepared for his day at SHIELD, when Tony realizes once again that this is not a dream, that they really live together now and that realization rocks his whole world, like every time. The happiness is overwhelming. He smothers a smile and pretends he doesn't care much for his boyfriend's marks of affection. It would be weird if the latter realized just how intensely Tony's entire being reacts to him. So early in the morning. So often in the day.
Tony chuckled and dropped his head in his hand, pressing his eye sockets again. "Nothing." He said exasperatedly. "Nothing,
is only pleasure and voluptuousness. The alpha's knot is deep inside him, softening slowly. It is blissful torture.
Steve almost moaned into Tony's mouth at first, his feelings and his body going suddenly haywire, before he grumbled and pushed his lover away with a furious glare.
that— and didn't turn around.
" 's that so? What made you think that I'd want to sleep with you now?"
... And anyway there's a huge gap between what we have now and actual BDSM and it's zillion miles away from what I had with Stane. Every time he fucked me, every time he was gentle, it was meant to break me... And I'm pretty sure that, if I were to do with you the things I did with him, it would feel completely different. Because you respect me and you always did and it would be an act of love and nothing else. That doesn't mean I particularly want a repeat of everything I did in the past. I'm just saying that we could try other things and you should stop handling me with kid gloves..."
"We used to fight all the time." Clint explained. "I think every time I opened my mouth he was onto me. After each session I really wanted to murder him. He was such an ass!"
"Good thinking." Tony mumbled, still short of breath. "So what's the plan?"
The omega starts crying, unwilling but irrepressible tears flowing down his cheeks, despite himself. Neither of them wants it but they both crave it with their entire being and when Tony cups his face in his hand in reassurance, the omega leans into it and then into him, instinctively nuzzling into his crotch and whimpering with want and uncontrollable need and...
He leant down and caught his boyfriend's mouth. Tony groaned against his lips and held his head strongly while his other hand clutched his hip. He surrendered so beautifully, vanquished, and Steve resumed undressing him, salivating at the prospect.
He nodded.
Something melancholic pooled in the dark of his eyes. And suddenly all kinds of dark thoughts came rushing back, overwhelmingly intrusive. Thoughts, feelings he had buried and didn't want to ever remember. Everything he had been going through those past week as an outed male omega. Everything he had endured before that.
At some point he was mildly concerned with his own safety. That was probably another Steve thing, it wasn't something Tony was usually inclined to. He really needed to stop randomly thinking about him in that kind of situations. It was becoming unhealthy... He quickly scanned through the worst case scenarios, though. What was the worst thing that could happen to him, really? He could pass out... He probably would, not a big deal. They could beat him up... nothing that hadn't happened before, nothing he wasn't prepared for either, he would probably welcome it. And if it left him disabled well, perhaps he would get something out of it. They could steal from him... His credit cards and his phone had extra security systems, JARVIS was behind it, at best they would be able to rob him of a couple of grands. A trifle... They could get arrested for public indecency. Hum... His dad would go berserk, that would be fun and the rest was something he would gladly let Tomorrow Tony handle. What else? Right... they could also (intentionally or accidentally) kill him. But... well... would it really be problem, per se? And what if they abducted him and kept him as a (sex-)slave, wouldn't that be fun? Of course, they might also be deranged people who would enjoy torturing him and would cut off his body parts and rape what was left of him all day long. That would be a bummer but Tony finally decided that this was very unlikely and was willing to take the risk. After all, he might even end up enjoying it in the end.
By the time he joins them in the nest, his slick is already dripping along the inside of his thigh... a single, trickling drop, trailing down his muscles to his knee. The scent, the mingling scent of alpha and omega and heat, spicy-sweet and violent, hits him brutally.
He heard Tony huff out a confused sound and looked up again. His boyfriend had walked up a few step closer and was staring at him with a bewildered expression. His smile had died down. "Realtor?" He asked hesitantly and forced a teasing grin on his lips. "Are you trying to invest in the real estate business?"
Steve let his boyfriend lead him through the corridors to the mysterious room, all trusting.
"You've had enough for tonight." His boyfriend snaps curtly.
known?" He spat bitterly, words as cold and biting as the freezing winter breeze. "Why didn't you fucking tell me? I could have prevented this. You're always complaining that I'm not telling you things but what should I say about you? How many more skeletons are there in your closet?"
Steve opened wide eyes to him and stared at his boyfriend in puzzlement. His features were strained and exhausted. He had dark circles under his eyes and looked ten years older. He grabbed his glass and Steve's eyes flickered to it. He noticed his hand was bandaged.
"Then just go there and don't be late."
"Have you been hurt anywhere else?"
Tony didn't move at first, wondering if he actually had a choice or not. Not that it mattered much, at this point. He internally laughed, mirthless. Steve had no use for a scum-sucking loser like him anyway.
"Is that something you'd like to change?" He asks but this time it's genuine. "Maybe it just needs finding the right place, or the right person." His heart flutters when he thinks about his boyfriend right next to him, chatting with Clint and Bucky.
Tony didn't come. They were too nice probably, not zealous enough, too drunk maybe. His little escapade to the men's room was fairly disappointing in the end. Although he did have the opportunity to taste the flavor of six different men's cum. The thought didn't rejoice him though, quite the contrary in fact. He felt an unsettling uneasiness growing inside. He wanted to throw up. The taste in his mouth was foul. He needed another drink.
"I'm sure." Steve insisted, still smiling fondly. "I'm sure because... the very fact that you're asking yourself that question now, tells everything about you. I
Tony abruptly turned to him and frowned at him. "Whatever, Steve." He snapped. "You're not my fucking dad. Don't patronize me!" Steve looked away and pouted, rolling his tongue on his teeth. "You gonna join me or what?" Tony finally asked.
"I gotta go, my mum's gonna get worried." Steve tried to explain and he stumbled out of the car. His body was hot all over, burning and stinging. He just wanted to tear his clothes off. He started to lose his breath and hyperventilated. He wanted to scream as hard as he could, releasing everything out. He wanted to run again, and never stop. Run a marathon until the pain, the
"This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard."
Soon half the students were convinced Steve was the school's very first male omega and accused him of hiding his true self with scent-confusers. Not that they hadn't been thinking it before, they just wouldn't say it out loud.
And he did so all night long. Never satiated. Always burning. Always hot and shivering.
Tony beamed and seemed as relieved as Steve was to drop the bullying topic and leave it for another day. "I was wondering if..." He started, hesitatingly. "If you could help me with English. You're the best student in Fury's class and I'm applying for MIT. I need at least a B-"
Clint raises a skeptical eyebrow. "Isn't that the same thing?"
He couldn't believe that not even once he had come back to his place since he had moved in with Tony in the penthouse. He had planned to though, he still had a lot of his stuff there, had left it thinking he would come back and fetch it bit by bit. He never did.
then... It was so easy for me to let him go, Tony, so easy... but I could never let
Tony hums in response.
He shrugged, smile tender and reassuring. "I do, hormones and everything, but it's not like I came all the way here for this, you know?"
place, not mine."
Steve looked down, looking for the right words. He wetted his lips. "It's not." He finally answered. "It might have been true, in the past, but I really was in a bad place then. It was just my way of getting over you, I guess. But I also had a lot of issues to deal with and not everything was about you. I—" He paused, running a soft and comforting hand on his boyfriend's cheek. "I guess it's more about overcoming a dark period of my life than about how I really see you, or saw you then..."
If you feel like telling me what you thought... ;-)
Tony's smile spread and his eyes twinkled. "Alright." He said in a soft chuckle. "I'll give you a hand."
"I do." Tony admitted. "It's just a dance, Steve. I'm not asking you to bond with me."
"I swear, I'm never gonna ask for your help for anything ever again. You should have stayed home if you were only planning to do as you please." Tony straightened up and paced to him hurriedly before Steve could realize it. "I didn't need that kind of hi—" He wasn't able to finish his sentence as his boyfriend's tongue, suddenly shoved into his mouth, interrupted him. Steve lost balance and moaned into his boyfriend's mouth in surprise.
Somehow, the rumor spread.
A shadow scurried past him but he didn't notice until his nostrils were filled with the dizzying smell. A very particular fragrance, undetermined. A musky body scent mixed so deliciously with expensive cologne. A luxury few boys indulged in at their school. Must be a rich kid thing. Or just a passing fancy.
"You were no better. Every time you spoke was to make a joke at my expense."
He grabbed the shaft and squeezed, drawing a gasp out of Tony who closed his eyes and hummed approvingly. He thrust his hips up to meet Steve's movements. Steve salivated at the view, relishing in the burning heat in his hand. He didn't wait too long before giving the head a tentative lick and started lapping up and down, breathing heavily on the cock. Tony started panting quietly, always repressing his reactions. His body tensed and spasmed occasionally as pleasure built inside him slowly.
He rushed down the stairs and stopped just in front of the kitchen door. He was not a kid anymore. Seventeen-year-old boys didn't go crying to their mama, after they had presented. He refrained.
Clint laughs. "Honestly? I don't... but I always thought you'd be able to change his mind about it."
friend. They had gotten along really quickly and Steve felt proud to be counted among his closest friends now, despite their age difference. Sam had always been very protective of Steve. Both a friend and a father figure. Was it his fault? Or was it that adults grew naturally distant as time passed by and that kind of thing became sort of inevitable when all of them were too busy with their own lives. So far he had never heard of Sam dating anyone, or Natasha for the matter. No one that had counted anyway.
Dinner passed by woefully and Tony soon realized no-one cared that he was there or not. He didn't even have it in him to be resentful. He just wanted to get the fuck away from there as soon as possible. Perhaps he could sneak out discreetly. He kept staring at his phone, of course no sign from Steve would magically appear on his screen but he couldn't help looking at the time. It was still early... and a sudden sliver of hope brightened Tony's evening. Perhaps he could still make it. Without the flowers, sure, but he still had his charms and his cute apologetic smile for himself and for one, he was actually looking really great in his dark grey tuxedo. Going was still better than not going anyway and if Steve told him to fuck off then, well, at least he would have tried.  Even mad Steve and his pack of spiteful friends would be better company than his current one.
He tilted his head on the side. "My hero..." He whispered when Steve knelt down next to him. Oh how he wanted Steve's hands on him right now. He would gladly die for Steve to touch him.
Tony shook his head, the hint of a smile growing on his face. He chuckled, sounding slightly bitter. "I'm really starting to wonder if I did stand out after all, or was it just because I was the most persistent of them of all..."
Steve snapped. "Will you fucking listen to me?" Tony jerked his head up and finally looked at him. "I'm not pressing charges." Steve explained with a gentle, reassuring voice. "And I'm not moving out." He added. "And I'm not breaking up with you. What is wrong with you?"
The omega presses his lips on Steve's bonding gland which pulsates with want, red and puffy and calling the alpha. He nibbles it, grazing his teeth on the burning bulge. It sends spikes of electricity throughout Steve's entire body. The pain is sharp, blinding. His vision whites out. Steve gasps and grinds his teeth.  Eyes closed, he leans into the touch, melting under his ministrations. Bucky snuggles his head against the other omega, hair brushing his temple softly, tickling his skin. Steve does the same and the two omegas take possession of each other, biting in turn their bonding gland until they bleed, releasing pheromones that drive the alpha crazy.
Tony stared at him confusedly.
Loki finally lets go of
"I see." Bucky answered as a grin spread on his face.
"And what makes you so sure you're omega and not a beta or an alpha attracted to other alphas." He croaked out, voice a little hoarse. "It happens..."
His boyfriend turned around and looked at him worriedly. Tony raised sheepish eyes to him, afraid to be rebuked again.
Steve responded with a smile and brushed his fingers on his cheek again. "I'm fine." He finally answered. "Are
The nice thing about doing it in the men's room was that it wasn't its primary purpose, which meant some of the guys here actually came to pee. Tony enjoyed that a lot. There were a lot of curious, some envious, looks. He hoped those would be a bit more forward though. Tony definitely could take two cocks in his mouth, probably three.
do it." His boyfriend replied, equally hoarsely. The useless provocation was gone from his voice now. Steve thought he was talking too much so he thrust hard and Tony let out a choked out moan, shuddering all over.
himself, but on an empty stomach he was just spewing bile and blood. The burning acid was excruciating on his inflamed throat. His head was spinning, he searched Steve's small bathroom cupboard for something, anything that could make him feel better. Meds, a pair of scissors, razorblades... Steve didn't even have paracetamol.
Steve shrugs. "It's small beer for you."
"Bite me," he whispers softly on the alpha's mouth while the three of them are entangled together, recuperating. Tony's warm brown eyes flare up. He quirks his eyebrows skeptically. "Bite me," Steve repeats, tone urgent and slightly annoyed. "Bite me. Bond me. I want to be bonded. I want to be your mate, you and Bucky both. You're the only one that can tie the three of us together for eternity. Do it. Bond with me like I've been wanting to for years now."
The Fallen Angel
"Never heard of drones?"
smile, perfect teeth all rightfully aligned—a promise for the best and the worst—and a mischievous twinkle in his playful eyes that made Steve's heart skip a little.
Tony was regaining colors by the day. Bucky and Steve had insisted the three of them should eat three meals a day on a daily basis. Tony knew better than argue against two serum-enhanced omegas. He quickly put on weight and his features softened and relaxed with time. He finally looked alive.
He growls from the depth of his throat and glares at the omega who keeps standing, frozen on his feet, soaking his pants. "Come here." He says with his most gentle voice, tilting his head on the side encouragingly.
"You're such a heart-breaker, Rogers." Jane teased.
Talking with Bucky helped him settling his feelings. Thor joined their idle conversation with a refreshing point of view, Clint was busy helping Natasha in the kitchen and the four science nerds were already in a heated discussion about whatever turned them on.
His boyfriend's jaw was throbbing with rage and he stared at them with a hard and focused expression. The one that Tony absolutely loved on him. And then he turned to him and like a knight in shining armor, surrounded with a halo of divine light, Steve rushed to him, eyes filled with concern.
would want to keep it a secret, you know, with me being alpha and everything... I should have taken scent-confusers..."
Steve's determination deflated like a balloon instantly and he slouched again, letting out another desperate sigh. He couldn't help laughing stupidly. "Why am I not even surprised?"
Seriously, are they glued to each other or what? And did Steve have to laugh so happily when they exchanged greetings? Oh and now he's patting him on his back, really...
He let his hands drop down along his sides and sighed in exasperation. "Tony..." He groaned reproachfully. "You're the one who insisted to come and help me today. I'd have asked Buck and Clint otherwise." His boyfriend looked up at him, eyes glistening with mischievousness, an unashamed smile on his smug face. Steve rolled his eyes and grabbed a dust-cloth that was lying around to whip his pretty ass with it. "Don't slack on the job! Or we're never gonna have time for any kind of reward at this speed... Move your ass!"
"Clint thinks you'd love being double-fucked, by the way."
Tony had run a tired hand in Steve's hair afterwards, when they were locked together. This was a first, for both of them. Tony's smile was radiant and satisfied. He whispered a soft "thank you" followed by a mind-blowing "you were amazing." And then, in the course of things, Tony had kissed the top of his head and slipped out the four letter word secretly while his fingers brushed along Steve's spine.
The office wasn't as fancy as the art studio in the Tower but it was practical, ergonomic and filled with books and items they could use as reference. The wall at the back of the room was completely hidden by huge shelves and book cases that went up to the ceiling, filled with all kinds of things, from figurine to pictures, to paint, to comic books. The other walls were covered with posters of the Avengers, of course, and a few personal pictures that Steve had brought but only he knew the significance of them.
he really meant like
"And then I guess, feelings naturally evolved. I can't explain this."
And it suddenly occurred to him. Were they really a couple? Were they invested enough in this relationship? What he was feeling... Was it real? Or was it an illusion created by the absence and the sexual frustration? Would they be happy if things were different? Would they last in other circumstances? They only saw each other for the best moments after all.
Steve bit his bottom lip and hesitated before speaking his mind again. "I think you've had enough for tonight."
the room and two, well, obviously he's not supposed to have that kind of thoughts, is he? Why would he think about things like that anyway? It's not like he actually
Tony hummed pensively. "Mmh. So you single?"
Past the annoyance at yet again an outward show of distrust from dear old dad, the last part of Howard's sentence finally came down to him. "What?" His heart dropped and started racing, in a moment of panic. "What do you mean we're
"This really isn't about the painting, is it?" He finally said in a disillusioned tone.
stupid."
Steve stopped what he was doing and turned around to look at his boyfriend playing with his stack of sex toys. "Don't tell me you never stimulate your prostate while jerking off, I mean... not even with your fingers?"
"I don't want to." He chokes out and it comes from the bottom of his heart.
Tony's not wearing any scent-confusers today, he notices. He leans into him, instinctively, and a whiff of the blissful omega sweetness softly assaults his nostrils. Steve's instincts take over and he unwillingly lets out a deep and lecherous growl that shakes his entire body. His nostrils flares, his lips instinctively tense up, showing his teeth and he growls again, trying to control his urges this time. His hand runs up his nape, entangling his fingers into his hair while he buries his head against Tony's shoulders, grazing his teeth against the red and puffy omega gland right there, pulsating for him. He sniffs and licks and nibbles at the skin, scraping his teeth on the gland.
"Redbull and ice." Dark-haired guy answered. At least he thought it was him, he recognized his voice. Tony glared at him. "You seem to be a little out of it, kid." The guy explained. "We don't want you to throw up, do we?"
"I'll sell my place." Steve choked out, words a determined whisper.
Was the number really relevant at this point? Apparently... Tony wondered if they were making statistics. How many guys did the average gay slut suck off on a Friday night...? Thursday night? Well... He internally laughed. "Yes." Tony wasn't sure though, but that was highly probable.
for once. I never meant to say that you assaulted me."
When he comes down to the nest to see Felicia, Steve is the one holding her in his arms. He's natural with her. He raises her just like one of his own and it's absolutely marvelous to observe. The nest smells safety and comfort. A warm and welcoming shelter for his little Felicia who is overprotected by two omegas.
She growls and shows her teeth unintentionally. She needs to leave, immediately. She swivels on her feet and strides out of the room, grabbing Clint by the shirt. He stumbled back and let himself be dragged away, knowing better than trying to protest right now.
"What didn't I do what?" Tony replied with a low, raspy voice.
creep inside him, the burning, the goosebumps,
Steve felt his heart clench and smiled softly before pinching his lips to repress the blush he felt creeping on his face. "I know..." He husked out. "And even if you weren't... It's not like I can't take care of myself. If for some reason I couldn't stay here anymore I'd have plenty of solutions, you know? You're not responsible for me..."
"You don't get to do that. You come on my cock or not at all."
"You want us to have BDSM sex, like you had with Stane?"
"Why didn't you do it in the end?" He asked after a peaceful moment of silence, hiding his embarrassed face into his boyfriend's cotton shirt, pressed hard against his muscular back.
Tony looks at his friend while something clenches inside. He's never thought about it before. He was just thinking that there's nothing money can't buy and feels suddenly like a rich asshole.
The words stung like daggers. Tony wanted to cry again. He thought of Obie, pissing in his mouth, offering it as a parting gift, and his own cock, rock hard at the humiliation. He wanted to scratch his skin off again, cut the inside of his arms and bleed. And what if he
He can't repress a burst of laughter. He must be pretty drunk already. "Clint?"
"Come in my mouth." Steve asked—
Steve smiled bitterly. "Everyone is. Even
Tony knew why he called Pepper every time. She had always been the best to screw his head right—
Tony grabbed him by the neck and pulled him closer, giving him the most languorous and sensual kiss before Steve could ever protest. He humphed in surprise and melted into it, feeling his body harden and warm in all the right places. He let himself go as his boyfriend took charge and deepened the kiss, pushing Steve into the bed dominantly. He didn't go much further however and they both fell back onto the bed, cuddling. Steve had abandoned his goal to finish packing up and lay in Tony's arms pensively, head on his shoulder. He let his hand wander on his chest and down his stomach, sneaking his fingers underneath his shirt and following the line of hairs that disappeared into his jeans. His chest hair had grown and Tony rarely shaved them off, Steve loved it, how his boyfriend became increasingly virile with time. He liked raking his hand in it, rub his nose and his face and swallow in his manly scent.
Flowers were ordered. He knew what he was gonna wear. Plus, he had prepared a little surprise for later. When they would be alone. And he had done everything on his own, for once. He was rather proud of himself. He stared at his phone. No sign from Steve whatsoever, Tony was restless. Steve never texted, never called—except to tell him off—but... Tony wished he would sometimes, just to be sure. After all, they hadn't talked about it again. Not after last week anyway... Of course he could call himself but he didn't dare. Every time he called Steve he felt like he was bothering him. He had written his text ten times at least and chickened out before pressing send.
Although Steve was slightly annoyed, considering their history. He grabbed Tony by the arm and dragged him inside to meet the rest of their friends. They were the last ones as usual. Getting ready had taken too long. Each time they were invited—the both of them—somewhere, an opportunity to enjoy each other as well, as they so rarely found the time to lately.
He looked at his phone again and waited patiently until the second course arrived for Obie to inadvertently remove his hand and he rushed to bathroom. He freshened up his face and waited for his body to calm down, for the growing cold uneasiness he felt inside to fade. He realized his hands were shaking. He realized he was scared and was disgusted with himself. He washed up one last time, hiding himself in his hands for a little too long, thinking about Steve, and jerked up when he heard the bathroom door burst open.
"Then why?" Tony asked, out of breath, a certain desperation coating his voice.
"The two of us had to pull you out of your vomit and drag your wasted ass home, I'm sure you could have figured it out yourself." Steve snapped, feeling like a jerk afterward. He couldn't help himself.
Tony inches away, heart racing a little. "Yeah I'm sorry 'bout that." He mutters guiltily. "I've been really busy lately. I'm the worst."
Tony tensed in front of him and something flashed through his eyes. "That didn't make what I felt for you any less real." He muttered with a raspy voice. He stared at Steve with an angry pout, fire burning in his brown eyes. "I know that I acted shitty back then. I didn't realize it then but I do now. And I'm not trying to find excuses for my behavior. I know you still haven't forgiven me yet—not completely—and I
Everything is fine. Sooo fucking fine. Tony was so ready for this. He's been ready for
Tony sighed and crossed his arms on his chest. "How do you think I feel then?" The question was simple but direct and Steve realized he had never asked himself how Tony felt about spending most of their time together at his place. It had become the norm, he had never questioned it. "I like your place, Steve, but that's not my home either. There's no space for me there. I have—" He paused. "I've been accommodating, until now, but I—" He averted his eyes and lowered his voice, words slowing down as he did so. "I
"Bucky doesn't want kids?"
"Surprise me." Steve answered with a cocky smile. "But first..." He grabbed his boyfriend's face and kissed him one last time while pulling him down on the pillows, into his arms. "Sleep!" He commanded. "I very much have the intention to stay in that bed with you until the night comes and fully intend to use your body to my heart's content... but I'm not getting any younger."
It could have been him.
Steve feels a pang in his chest, despite himself, and represses a tear from falling down his cheek. No matter how much he hasn't wanted this, now matter how much it repulsed him then—never wanted to, always hated the idea of it—it still hurt.
What was he doing now? He didn't wanna die. He couldn't do that to Steve.
Tony stood in front of that painting for almost twenty minutes. Not a word came out from his mouth. Not even a sigh. He just stared and sometimes he squeezed Steve's hand. At some point he dropped it, just to take it again a few minutes later. Meanwhile, Steve's heart was racing in his chest.
Because if Steve did, really, Tony would give him anything, anything he wanted. Tony would chop his dick off if Steve asked him to. He had said that before, hadn't he?
Clint stares back, a knowing smirk on his lips. "What projects?"
"I don't, right?" Steve finally admitted, looking away. "I don't listen to you."
He stopped talking.
"James?"
Something highly emotional flashed in Tony's eyes again before he looked away embarrassedly. "I guess..."
"I'm not fine with it." Steve finally admitted in a calm voice while trying to settle his heart to a none life-threatening rhythm. "It wasn't supposed to be like this..." He tried to justify. "How could I ever know?"
"Yes."
When James comes back, three hours have passed. Three hours of happiness. Tony hasn't realized it but he had never been so relaxed since Steve had left. Steve's scent, the treacherous, had soothed him and eased him into a sense of well-being despite himself.
us to live together. I'll sell it and we'll buy something, the two of us, together. Something that'll be
"Have you been bullied before?" Steve asked. "At your former school? Is that why you got transferred?"
Steve begged. "Let me speak to him directly."
other options... but I can't help feeling like it's getting more and more unreachable. I kinda have come to terms with it actually. I'm happy with just the two of us."
"That's not the same when
in the silence of his lonely room, when the alpha and omega fuck each other brainless, when he's left on his own with only his eyes to cry and his daughter to take care of, the alpha's pup that took life in his wombs, the one he gave birth to, on his own... his own bonding gland starts pulsating.
could see how much he was into you."
"And you'll have to accept that I own at least 80 percent of it, otherwise we'll never be able to afford it."
"Please indulge me." Steve whispered softly into his ear while running gentle fingers into his hair. He felt Tony's chest shake with a silent chuckle and tightened his embrace. "Also, where the hell did you find cigarettes?"
The men exulted, encouraged by Tony's responsiveness—or lack of, he wasn't really sure, things were too foggy. They started to choke him. Tony's eyes flared open and he gasped and wheezed for air. The rush of adrenaline was blinding and deafening. His head was spinning and his consciousness ebbed slowly away, until everything went dark. Tony hoped he would not wake up. It was a really nice way to die, he thought. Die while being fucked.
"That's such a beautiful story, Nat." Betty exclaimed. Steve hadn't even noticed she was back. "You two are gonna be great parents."
It is Bucky, hitting the peak of his heat again and Tony who fucks into him mindlessly, driven only by instincts. He's exhausted too. And Steve orgasms, or rather, it's Bucky who does. Or maybe Tony. Perhaps both at the same time. The pleasure hits Steve brutally and he keens and cries, literally cries. A sobbing and weeping mess, eyes blinded with tears.
"What I mean is..." Steve carries on. "It's okay for you to get smashed and smoke pot once in while. You're allowed not to be perfect and It's okay if you fail sometimes." He grins proudly, probably at Tony's startled face. "I don't
"Nope." Steve rectified. "Mrs Walsh. First grade."
Jane laughed doubtfully. "Even at the beginning?" Thor seemed to think about it and didn't answer. "Yeah, that's what I thought." She finally said with an amused smile.
and his body is permeated—
"Or we could have used
Tony rushed to answer 'no' with a shake of his head. Steve would only be a nuisance, getting worried and over-protective. It was bad enough that Tony was gonna get checked up, it would only make things worse. His boyfriend looked angry and hurt and Tony's heart clenched when he saw the confusion in his eyes but he would deal with it later. He couldn't have Steve there with him.
Steve. Because he antagonized Steve then.
Tony had been talking about seeing this painting for weeks, Steve had dreaded this moment. His boyfriend was way too enthusiastic, what would happen when he saw? They walked around in the museum, stopping from time to time to enjoy a few classics that Steve loved. Steve was warmly amazed to see that his boyfriend remembered all his favorites. He suspected Tony had purposely made a detour to make the moment last. Tony loved the anticipation. Or maybe he just needed to calm himself down. Either way, Steve appreciated. The high-pitched voice of his boyfriend somehow lulled him into a state of blissful comfort.
Steve pouted and stared at his boyfriend sidelong, unjustly annoyed. " 'course you can," He muttered with a tinge of spite in his voice. "Don't take me for a fool. Even without SI you can..."
"What I'm saying is..." Steve went on. "Please don't do it again! And I don't mean the rough sex, Tony... I mean, I can
Steve doesn't remember well how it happened but he remembers that he found himself pushing Bucky against the wall and started grinding his hard-on against him hips. Bucky curled his arms around him and kissed him softly. Steve made the kiss eager and brutal, grabbing Bucky's hips. The Omega hanged onto his shoulders and wrapped his strong legs around his waist. Steve carried him to his bedroom, hands under his butt, clutching his asscheeks.
"And?"
And here is the second part... You might wanna read chapter 23 again, in case things are confusing.
Tony couldn't handle Steve crying. Every time he heard a sob or a sniffle he wanted to scream in agony, to tear off his hair and gouge his eyes out, cut his wrists and the inside of his thighs, just like he did when he was a kid. Why did Steve have so little hair and no razorblades in his bathroom? Steve should really have razorblades in his bathroom, so the next time he broke down in front of Tony,
"Alpha?" Clint asked, very interested.
"Steve, I—"
The stench infuses and pervades. The tension is palpable and infuriating. She can't stand it anymore, it's driving her crazy. She can't even touch them. Their scent is marked and owned, besides she never wanted to touch either them anyway. She just wants her peace and quiet. She wasn't supposed to want. She wasn't supposed to
fine?"
Tony thinks he hates Loki.
He couldn't wait to be out of here and done with it.
"You're very handsome tonight," is the only thing Tony can say as a reply, at the risk of sounding corny.
He has two omegas. Two gorgeous and horny omegas. This is amazing, isn't it? They sway their hips every time he is in the same room. They infuse their delicious and manipulative scents everywhere around him. Their scents spike every time he comes close and every time he looks them in the eyes, he can see the lust in them. He always gets lost in the infinity of their blue eyes. He can see their lips part and their knees falter with the need to submit and it's overwhelming.
Steve sighed annoyedly against his shoulder blade and disentangled his arms. He let himself fall onto his back and closed his eyes not to see the tent forming under the covers that painfully reminded him how hard he was. "Fine..." He grumbled, making sure his deeply frustrated dissatisfaction got through the long disappointed sigh he let out as he did so.
Tony's eyes were glittering with a forlorn concern. "I mean, have I... Did we... Have we ever done things you didn't consent to?"
perfumes. Murderous thoughts are coming back.
"Fine!" Tony snapped resignedly. His eyes were still determined though. Weirdly determined.
Steve smiled and Bucky smiled in relief. "Happy?" He rasped in a husky voice. Steve licked his lips and bit his bottom lip as he nodded. "Very." He whispered.
Fury told me I should ask you for the classes I missed. Said you were the most serious of his students."

is the answer to everything...
Everything came back to his mind, tormenting him. He freaked out. "I can't do this." He said, panic overwhelming him. "I can't do this." He repeated and was already opening the door to escape. It was too fucking much. Everything was too much.
Steve remained silent, not knowing what to say yet. Maybe he was trying not to say something stupid that would lead to an unnecessary fight between them. He could feel the tension rising between them though and Tony's shoulder blades inconspicuously tensed. Steve clutched the iron bar till it hurt. He felt an uncomfortable shiver running down his spine. The silence suddenly heavy between them.
Feed.
He had taken on Johann Schmidt on his own, to defend him.
It took him a moment to realize what and who Steve was talking about. He had a very vague, blurred and distorted idea of what Steve was referring to and the question was very specific. Tony felt a shiver down his spine. Why had he let them treat him like this? He had absolutely no answer to that question. Wasn't he supposed to? Was he supposed to fight them back? What for? Who were
Tony kissed him back but pushed him away quickly, preferring enjoying the chocolate without Steve's tongue but his hands were gentle on his shoulders, brushing softly the skin of his neck. "I promise that I'll do everything you ask me to for the next couple of hours." He said in a husky voice.
Steve thought his mouth gaped open. "What the fuck?" He quickly skirted around his boyfriend to face him, leaving a few feet between them. "What are you talking about?"
The brutal shove made his dick tingle. He gasped and stared lewdly at the owner of that hand. Tony's vision was too hazy for him to discern his face but the eyes were wanton, that was enough. The man studied him for a short moment, Tony made sure his own face said yes, he didn't have it in him to speak. He hoped the guy wouldn't mind. Apparently he didn't. With a manly grip on the back of Tony's head, the man shoved his tongue in his mouth and pressed his body against him. Tony melted into the kiss at first, caught off guard. His breath was hot and smelt like booze, it was heady. Then the man's hand slipped down his stomach and into his pants, grabbing his dick and started kissing his neck with too much tenderness. His hold on Tony's nape was gentle. Shit. The guy was too nice, Tony needed to change that. He let the guy play with his half-hard cock for a while before pushing him away. He didn't want to be kissed anyway.
Bucky rolled his eyes at his husband.
Tony and Natasha had just arrived and were causing a commotion, catching all the attention. They were both stunning and looked so good together.
Tony forgets about everything that is not Steve or Steve's smile or Steve's seductive laugh or Steve's broad shoulders and for the first time he's enjoying himself freely. Not once the purpose of them going on a date together comes up.
Slowly, but surely, things came back to him. A little.
"At the beginning, before your birthday. You said I sucked out the life out of you."
He shook his head silently.
"Now," Howard commanded, providentially, "get back to work." And he patted his son on the shoulder, smugly proud of having humiliated his son once again. Tony clenched his fists and almost bit his tongue in an attempt to control his boiling rage. He would have preferred Howard to hit him because this honeyed, falsely affectionate act that only asserted his dominance over Tony was way worse than any blow he had ever given him. The fire must still be burning in his eyes because his father showed him a condescending smirk. "And don't give me that look... You'll have plenty of time to fuck all the girls—and boys for that matter—you want. Just set your priorities straight. That's all I'm asking."
Steve wanted to get a chance to smell it, get a whiff, briefly and secretly, and know. And occasionally he felt really warm inside, just thinking about it.
And then Steve stopped talking, and
Steve shrugged. Annoyed. "But that's what everyone's thinking, right?" He spatted, sounding more bitter than he had intended to. "Oh, you heard? The Rogers kid's omega. Really? Oh poor Sarah. That's trouble. A kid like that. You know what they say..." He chuckled, looking down in despair. "Don't pretend you're not thinking like them. Don't fucking pretend!"
Steve chuckled, feeling lighthearted and happy for the first time this evening. "What conditions?"
Then he steps back and looks up into his eyes. He brings a warm and soothing hand to Tony's cheek. "Tony, I never told you but... " His expression is worryingly serious and Tony's heart skips a beat. "I'm so proud of you."
"Argh come on, Tony." Jane grumbled. "Stop teasing us! Tell us more!"
"Did you swallow?"
He started running as soon as he got off the bus. He knew very well he shouldn't but part of him wanted to give the finger to his fucking health and just live his life like any other senior high-school student, well almost like any other senior high-school student. Well, at least live some kind of a life.
He was surprised at how easy it had been. Moving in together, they should have done that two years ago. All that time, stupidly wasted. Steve wasn't about to start regretting things, however. Time to move forward.
"Are you saying you like me better now, with all this hair everywhere, than when we met?"
He heard Tony play with his toys some more.
All sorts of emotions pooled in Tony's eyes who stared up at him with blissful gratitude, unable to express his feelings. Steve felt his heart skip a beat, a surge of affection flushed through him.
He walked a few yards until the sound of a moving car stopped him in his momentum. It was moving suspiciously slow. Steve made a halt and turned slowly on the side, heart racing in his chest. For a split-second he wondered if it was written on his ass, that he was omega, he pushed this ludicrous and very depressive idea out of his head soon enough and squinted his eyes to get a better view.
It was only half past nine, his heart skipped a beat. Tony politely excused himself and put his jacket on. He straightened up, wavered a little with the pain, Obie didn't hold him back. He could finally get the fuck away and have his smoke.
Steve let escape an embarrassed laugh. "You don't mean that, do you?" He asked, worryingly. "I mean, why would you think we were?"
Sam rolled his eyes, not falling into his trap and ignoring his provocations.
At this rate he will have a stroke soon, keeping a clear mind is an ordeal already. All his blood rushed down to cock. Why does it have to be a constant struggle with himself? It's even harder to resist ever since he and Steve are having sex again, as if instead of calming his urges and satiate them, having sex with Steve just awoke the beast in him and he's become an insatiable, hungry and brainless sex-addicted being.
Tony giggled and pinched his lips, wetting them again. "Please, say a blowjob." He teased, unconsciously sticking the tip of his tongue out.
But there was something more about this guy. An attraction maybe. Or a smell? Maybe it was just the name, it appealed to him. Something. Anything. Steve was fascinated and his eyes followed the young boy as he walked confidently across the classroom, a smirk on his lips and a powerful stance that even reduced Johan Schmidt and his goons to silence, somehow impressed and probably as fascinated as the rest of them.
"Why would I be disappointed?"
Tony chuckles bitterly, unable to process the sharp sincerity in Steve's voice. "You never wanted to submit." He says with a sad, melancholic smile.
"If I got all worked up every time I had sex and don't remember any of it I'd never see the end of it..." Tony said with a shrug. "I can't spend my life raking my head over it. At some point I'll have to move on, you know?"
. And Tony was confusing, very confusing. "He has a girlfriend." He added. A very
Tony nods slowly, eyes still closed, enjoying all the different sensations the mixture gives him. When he opens his eyes again, Clint is smirking. "You need to teach me how to make those," he says, "they're amazing," and he stares at Steve again. Steve liked the first cocktail, he's pretty sure he'll love this one, minus the extra charge of rum, of course.
Tony bent over and sniffed one. He felt his pupils flare open and his heartbeat accelerate. He knew he would soon feel euphoric and waited for it eagerly.
Steve went berserk.
His mum gave him a mischievous smile. "You think I wouldn't recognize the scent of an aroused omega? I've been married to one, remember?" She laughed and ruffled his head tenderly, just like loving mums do. "Be sure to take care of your mate, Steve. Protect him and respect him. Omegas are fragile, no matter how strong they might look."
"Yes?"
After he pulled himself together, he picked up the remains of Tony's glass and cleaned up. Then he drank some water, to rehydrate. Then he tried to read a little and take his mind off things, and then watched some TV, tried to sleep, toss and turned and almost cried again out of exhaustion. Nothing could distract from the heavy twinge in his chest.
Tony shook his head, grin wide on his face. "And how many of the guys—or girls, for that matter—I hooked up with do you think I gave my number to?" Steve didn't say anything, lost for words. "One, Steve." He answered the question himself, sounding hurt. "Just one."
"What are you doing?" Steve asked tentatively.
He felt a strong grip on his frail shoulder. "Let's get goin', Stevie. You hungry?"
He looked around at the three men who stared at him bewilderedly, a tinge of amusement in their grin. Then he stared down at himself, his stained pants, his disheveled shirt. He had only come once today, he thought, and he wasn't really sure how it had happened but right now he wasn't hard anymore. He took a cigarette out and lit it, stared at the plastic bag in his hand and pondered taking another dose, to up the mood a little.
Steve chuckles in front of him. Tony raises his eyes and is momentarily dazed by the smile on his boyfriend's adorable morning face. He doesn't speak but he must have looked slightly curious because Steve answers his unsaid question before he even has the time to think of it.
There were white flakes dancing around him in the streetlight, tickling the tip of his flushed nose. His gaze glittered with happiness. He turned his face to Steve. Their eyes met and locked into each other. They shared a silent smile before Tony held him his hand and looked upward again. His smile was soft now, and innocent.
"Life sucks." Bucky finally said before curling himself into a ball and snuggling against Steve.
"Like being roughed up, Greg?" Dark-haired guy said, smiling dangerously. The glint in his eyes was depraved.
"It's just... I hadn't planned to be an alpha and... How is this gonna work?"
It's only when they're hesitating over dessert that Steve finally breaches the subject and it comes out of nowhere, at the most unexpected moment.
Steve felt himself liquify on his seat, face burning with shame, a slight tremor in his hands. See? He told you! English class had become a living hell. All eyes were turned on him but Steve could only see one pair.
Tony fondled Steve's hands and chuckled. "I don't know... I guess coming back here makes me feel nostalgic. And anxious."
And although she wouldn't trust herself around one in heat, by the time she met Steve she was absolutely fine. She could control herself, every impulse, every urge she felt. She was simply not interested. She knew she was broken somehow but it didn't matter. She didn't need anything and she didn't missed it. She was fine.
It's what he needs to do right now though,
"Didn't work out with him?" He asks, heart racing a little.
He paused, smile growing on his lips. "Oh fuck it..." He swiped the papers on his desk and flashed his best smile.
"Back then you would have died rather than share you heat with an alpha." Steve scoffed in attempt to soothe the tension in the atmosphere. It didn't work.
Tony stared at her, he had no answer to that but shook his head anyway.
He was the first one who decided to break the suffocating silence between them. "I
Steve startled at the impromptu question. "What?"
Tony didn't answer. He didn't have any answers. He just stared into the man's eyes for a moment. His vision was still blurry. Making decisions was hard right now. Was dark-haired guy expecting him to? He was way too wasted for that. He just needed to come and forget and come again, and be used and forget.
Steve had already given up on him, had maybe even broken up with him. If he hadn't yet, it was just a matter of time before he would. Who would ever want trash like him for a boyfriend? Not even Obie does. Tony might as well give up on the idea altogether. Tony wouldn't dare show up at Steve's door after what he had done anyway. He was nowhere near wasted enough for that. Obie wanted him to have fun? Sure, he'd have fun. Tony was all for fun. Fuck his legacy! Fuck his destiny! Tony was gonna trash himself to death and fuck everyone who would like him enough to be willing to. Well, when he said like
"So we started seeing each other more often. It was only baby related at first."
"Well, as far as I'm concerned," Tony said amusedly, tone carefree and innocent, "that was totally love at first sight."
"I'm in front of your house." Tony repeated and Steve suddenly realized what the background sound was.
Steve shrugged. "Don't know... I just... They were offered to me, I think. Probably Clint. Never knew how to use them."
Surely that was still the truth. Steve wouldn't be here otherwise, would he?
It wasn't a room.
cross that line. I wish you would... And maybe I'll put you in your place if I think you're going too far, just like you do with me, but that doesn't mean you have to keep from trying."
"Really?" He said with an indecipherable smile. "What makes you think that?"
"I live here now. What use do I have for an empty apartment? I don't need it so it might as well benefit people who do. Haven't you heard of the housing crisis?"
back. The two of us. It's up to you then if you want to add Bucky in the picture or not." Tony stares at him confusedly. "And you're wrong about him, by the way. He cares about you. A lot."
He pounded hard and deep, harder and deeper than ever, at a fast, punishing rhythm, making a point, and soon Steve forgot about his earlier disappointment. His cock rock hard and dripping against the inside of his thigh, his cries and moans muffled into the sheets, he got what he asked for. He was on the edge again. Tony slowed down then and fucked deep and lovingly into him, making sure he grazed his soft spot at every thrust. Steve felt the spikes of pleasure from his ass to his cock and to his brain. His entire body shuddered with overwhelming pleasure. He finally cried out and came undone, spilling himself onto the bed, untouched. Tony fucked him through orgasm until Steve's body stopped spasming and just when it started feeling uncomfortable, he pulled out.
"You remember when I first came here?" Tony said softly, voice faltering and pregnant with nostalgia.
big, has him a little stunned.
Tony just shrugged. "Sure. Whatever. Do what you want."
"Nothing," He answered quietly. "Just some stupid videos on youtube." Steve's face was indecipherable and Tony watched him silently turn his back to him and fetch a beer in his fridge. He felt a pang in his chest. He wanted to cry.
"I wanna have fun too." Steve said, pressing his face hard into the tiles and then brutally pulling his chin back to face him. "Open your mouth."
"It's just
punishing me after all..." Steve said defensively. "Trying to teach me a lesson."
Tony giggled next to him, tone teasing. "Of course, I was." He admitted. "Wasn't that obvious? I mean, you couldn't have been that clueless, could you?"
The question was nonchalant, unexpected and incongruous. It took Steve a moment to understand what Tony was talking about. He never went to high school dances. He never had anyone to go with and he didn't know how to dance anyway.
"You can never know for sure until it happens." She answered elusively.
"What is so fucking wrong with me selling my work?
He got flustered, his cheeks hot and probably as red as Johann's puffy face. He clutched his bag as he dashed through the corridor in a half-conscious attempt to perhaps find shelter in the bathroom. Too much emotion lately.
Steve had a moment then. He stared at his tall silhouette and remembered when they shared this apartment, as flatmates, during those few weeks. His boyfriend was in a really bad place then, he had known it and yet, somehow, his heart had been too cold for him to care at the time. Not strong enough. He blessed him for being so strong for them both and resisted the urge to wrap his arms around him and cuddle him. They had lost enough time already.
Something shone in Tony's eyes. "Oh..."
live without you Tony, I can. I just don't want to anymore."
Tony didn't say anything else but he smiled and started nuzzling softly into his neck, leaving a hot trail of wet kisses on his skin. Steve shivered and felt his entire body tingle with desire. He inched away from his boyfriend, feeling suddenly overwhelmed by the intense heat between them. Tony's hands slid down his back and settled on his waist. He raised his head and looked up, eyes hazy. His wet lips searched Steve's, demanding a kiss. Steve complied and wiped absent tears from his boyfriend's eyes. "Stark men are not supposed to cry." He said with a teasing grin.
hard for him to resist Steve right now.
Steve rolled his eyes.
Steve parted his lips and tried to swallow the lump in his throat. He felt the tears trickle down his cheeks and wrapped himself around Tony's neck, hugging him into a strong and comforting embrace. "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to," he whispered. "We don't have to know everything about each other. But I'll be there for you and I'll listen to you if you ever wanna talk about it. Just, please, don't push me away! Don't pretend that everything is fine and drown your sorrows by yourself, and then tell me to go to sleep like nothing's happened... because I can't."
Clint finally comes back with a round of homemade cocktails of his own. Good, because Tony needs the alcohol right now. Beer is too light. Clint's arrival means the party's finally getting started but everything revolves around Loki, because he kind of was the reason behind this friendly get-together, Tony learns. Maybe that explains why Steve didn't insist when Tony said he couldn't come...
Steve, on the other hand, has a reputation and he doesn't care anymore. Now that he knows who he is and what he wants, nothing else matters and especially not what other people think. He feels strong and fulfilled and blissed around Tony. So it doesn't matter that the rumors are still going on, that the people who smelt alpha on him the first day are starting to think they've been dreaming the whole thing. Steve cannot possibly be alpha. He's so
The three of them turned to him, looking rather outraged.
"I think I am." The brunet finally said. "I'm just exhausted."
Steve felt warm with gratitude. "But I'm sick and I can't protect you."
Tony shivers at the touch. It's just a slight brush but he almost gasps, overwhelmed by the blissed fluttering in his chest. He knows Steve's lips are going to brush over his jawline and plant a delicate morning kiss there, igniting every cell in his body. He
Steve had put Tony in charge of his comic book collection while he was sorting his books, intending to give away most of them. As he was halfway through it, he heard his boyfriend chuckle behind him and turned around only to see him standing in the middle of the room, hips leaning against the back of the couch and reading the earliest issues of the Avengers. The entire collection still on the bookshelves and very much
He can
like he could be himself for the first time in his life.
Steve hadn't. Steve hadn't thought about telling anyone actually. Steve would have thought Tony would want discretion, after everything he had gone through. And besides, they hadn't even talked about it, about them. So far, to Steve, their relationship was still—were they in a relationship? Apparently they were and the news was...unsettling, overwhelming,
She gave him ointments and meds and looked with a focused, medically concerned stare at the bruises on his neck. "Did you get choked?"
Steve swallowed and wetted his lips. "I guess I never finished decorating in the end." He said in a croaky voice. "I think I never truly settled down." He explained. "Like it's always been transitory in my head. I was always waiting for something, somehow." He paused, rejecting upon what he had just blurted out. "Maybe you were after right after all.... It wasn't me. It's never been me, this place. I never truly felt home here, not the way I feel home in the penthouse and perhaps..." he hesitated. "Perhaps, it was because I wasn't really myself then..."
He raised his eyes, heart thumping hard in his chest, throbbing at his temples. He bit his tongue and stared into the alpha's eyes. They were attentive and so gentle and understanding it warmed Steve's entire body again. He felt like crying of relief but repressed it.
"No-one asked for your opinion,
Tony burst out laughing. That was so out of line. "Never!"
"Tony..." He whispered and it turned out a little croaky. A split second later Tony's lips were back on him.
She stumbled and swirled on her feet as elegantly as a dance. That was what omegas did and Pepper Potts was the epitome of one. Tall and slim with an incredibly thin waist she often highlighted with ribbons or belts made out of fabric. Her limbs were delicate, her hands were thin with long graceful fingers, her features so smooth, her face so pale and so fragile, her long flamboyant hair tied in an elegant manner, everything about her delicate and beautiful.
Steve frowned, staring at him skeptically with wide questioning eyes.
Since then it only happened four times, plus a couple of times they've been messing around but didn't go all the way. This isn't much but Steve is content, because each time has been glorious.
It is relatively peaceful during the rest of the morning. Tony looks after Felicia. She is amazing. She learns things so quickly. Tony is almost sure she said "Papà."
"I..." Steve starts, voice croaky. "I'd love that." He finally says, swallowing the lump in his throat. At that Tony's confidence comes back, boosted up, and he keeps pushing Steve backward until his back bumps against the stairway behind them. Tony grabs his head with both his hands, they're clammy, and he kisses him again, dominantly. Steve lets him take control and melts into it, moaning in his boyfriend's mouth. Tony grinds into him, half-hard against his stomach and they make out until they're both breathless.
"Can't." Steve deadpanned, staring fixedly at the drops of water seeping down his glass of strawberry milkshake.
When Bucky's lips touch Steve's, he's back to being himself. Mostly.
Tony had already open the door, hand resting on the frame. He turned his head back and stared at Steve, a mischievous smile spreading on his face. "Watch me." He whispered.
Steve didn't deny it. Truthfully, he wasn't sure what was the worst. People thinking he was omega or knowing he hadn't presented yet. Both were terribly embarrassing and at least, being omega gave him grounds to fight back. The truth would only confirm he was a freak.
Tony goes to Steve first. A soft hand on his cheek, he tugs his chin up and makes him look into his eyes. "You really
"Isn't it a bit too cheesy?"
Tony doesn't let that many people touch him anymore anyway, mostly his friends. He has surprisingly managed to set up some boundaries. Not that his body isn't responsive anymore but rather that, after years of therapy, he thinks he's finally able to make out the situations when it's fine and those when it's not. And when he's not sure, he just needs to think about Steve and if he can picture his disapproving frown in his head, it means it must be fairly inappropriate and so he can say
"I'm so sorry, Tony." He whispered. "I should have told you about that painting. I just... I was scared how you would react and I... Frankly, I really just wanted to forget about it. Get it out of my life. I never thought it would just turn up in the worst possible way..."
issue. A powerful AI he based on JARVIS.
He isn't sure why he hates Loki. Loki seems to be a pretty cool guy, there's no objective reason for Tony to hate him and yet, he makes his skin crawl.
"That's just alpha instincts. We're just dance partners." Tony repeated nonchalantly, the same soft smile fading on his face. "And she's a really good one but I wanna dance with my friends."
"Yes."
Steve wasn't really sure if the tone was happy or reproachful. Maybe it was a bit of both. He felt himself blush. "I... yeah, I guess. Sam was nice enough to accompany me."
Tony grinned proudly. "Lunch date."
Tony." Steve raised unapologetic eyes to him. "It doesn't mean anything to me. I've got all the supplies I want in the tower... of better quality too."
He exclaimed, almost horrified. Tony smiled mockingly and snorted. Steve rolled his eyes. "You don't even
Tony's plus one. Potts.
"It won't be the same... And Steve won't be here to explain. Come on! It's gonna be fun. With a lot of alcohol."
Tony spent about another half-an-hour on the symbolism of flowers and was even more lost than he was before so he decided to trust Pepper in the end, because one amaryllises were beautiful indeed, he believed, and two he
Steve shook his head, however, and tsked. He was so hard it hurt. "Nah." He just said, words unusually low and hoarse. "You're the one getting fucked today." He rasped in a throaty voice. "After teasing me all day long. I'm gonna fuck you so hard you're gonna regret ever telling me you like being dominated in bed."
"Yes."
Hydrate.
Steve startled at the unexpected and gratuitous compliment.
He was actively in the process of elaborating the best strategy when he felt a strong and warm possessive hand on his knee, forcibly stopping the shaking and anchoring him to his seat. Obie didn't even look at him but his hold was firm and inescapable and it spread warmth inside Tony's body like a disease, to the point of embarrassment. Tony suddenly felt hot and flustered and he hated his body for being so responsive to the man's touch. He took off his jacket and wriggled uncomfortably on his seat. He wasn't hard yet, but almost, and secretly wished for the man's hand to creep up his thigh, against his own will and rational thoughts. Obie's hand remained on his knee however, with a grip just strong enough to remind him he wasn't free.
hour...
Steve ruffled his hair again. "I can't." He sighed regretfully. While he was slowly getting his back his consciousness, his eyes wandering to the unfinished board that was due two days ago and he felt a pang in his chest.
Tony felt a shiver throughout his entire body. He shook his head in panic. "No." He rushed to say with a shuddering voice. "I don't wanna stay here. I can't."
Sam patted his shoulder gently. "It's alright Stevie, we all love you the way you are. Even if you're oblivious. Especially that guy over there." He nodded in Tony's direction. Tony wasn't looking, whispering in Clint's ears. He was smiling though. "So give him some slack, all right?"
And so he does and sinks his teeth in the bonding gland. Bucky cries out and shivers all over. It doesn't work indeed—only Tony can bond them, only him can sacralize this existing bond between the three of them with the blessing of his bite—but it makes the omega come a fourth time, a brutal, wrecking dry orgasm torn away from him in the worst way. Or the best, depending on one's opinion.
Tony chuckled and Steve felt his lips curl against his own. "Whoops..."
on my birthday party, by the way..." He noticed the hint of a smile on a few of his friends' faces. Everyone remembered the fiasco that had been his birthday then but, again, water had run under the bridge and no-one but Sam risked making any comments about it. The latter rolled his eyes and patted his shoulder protectively. "We went on a trip, totally improvised, and I guess I saw parts of him I had never seen before and I think that's when I first realized how deep my feelings for him went. But honestly, even then, I couldn't make any sense of them...."
"You two will work it out." Steve said, looking at his boyfriend. "When there's love, anything's possible."
Steve huffed out a surprised laugh. "You're crazy, you know that?"
It is this moment, when the omega is no longer himself, gone in the oblivion of heat, that Steve chooses to press his fingers inside him, pushing further and further. A wave of slick flush down on his hand, easing the invasion. The omega is opening up for him, grabbing his wrist to encourage Steve deeper. Three fingers are buried deep already, skimming softly over the omega's soft spot that Steve knows as much as his own, if not better.
Clint shrugs and takes another swig. "It's not that... I mean it's complicated. It's not like we can just fuck and it happens, right?"
The connection he has with him, the love he feels for him, is mental and emotional. It's sweet and tender and deep that comes from the bottom of his heart. It reaches the core of his soul and it would never end. For life, they're connected and he knows that it's true for Steve as well. Because Steve still comes to his room at night, when he's not with the alpha, and Bucky makes sweet tender love to him and it's amazing as well as excruciatingly lonely.
"You think I would pass on the chance to taste your ass a little, no way!"
Tony walked to him and grabbed his hand. He tugged on it. "Come on, Rogers. Put on your clothes and let's get out. I'm sure you're hungry."
Steve facepalmed and shook his head. He felt a blush creeping on his face and was probably crimson red to the tip of his ears. He could even start to imagine what he was going to face the next day at work. He felt shivers running down his spine just thinking about it.
At first they had given Felicia to Natasha and Clint to be looked after but when they noticed that magical, very useful, aspect of being bonded to the same alpha, they brought her back to their floor with them. Bucky needs her close. Steve too, even if the need is not as visceral.
And he's still there for the same reason. He doesn't have a choice. On paper, James belongs to him. His life belongs to him. His death belongs to him. His well-being belongs to him, his misery as well. Whoever wrote those fucking laws, Tony pukes on their graves. Whoever still enforce those laws today, he despises them from the bottom of his heart and soul.
His bonding gland still pulsated, more intensely than ever. Whoever thought it would fade was a fool, or a fucking asshole... The need to be with him had never been so strong.
And then Steve started to hide secret messages addressed to his boyfriend or nodding at him here and there, in each of his publications. Everyone hastened to find out where they were and competed to find them first. It became a thing. A huge
"I really wanna touch you." Steve admitted. "And I wanna kiss you all over and... And I wanna you to touch me too. And—"
It's terrifying the way they're now connected to each other. They can feel each other's feelings, know each other's thoughts, it's all mingled and yet distinct, but they can't really know each other's thoughts. It's basically a hunch, an intuition but one they know they can trust. It's indescribable.
Steve let go of his boyfriend's mouth. He tasted like coffee and cigarette. Steve hated the mix, to be honest. "I'll move in with you." He said in a whispering but determined sigh. "Tonight. Let's fucking do this! It's been long overdue."
The alpha is buried deep inside the omega, standing on his knees behind him. Steve is chest down on the mattress, shaking still, goosebumps all over his skin. Tony is caressing his back slowly, reassuringly. His eyes are still feral and his musky scent spikes up when he senses Bucky's presence. Steve's spasms slow down gradually and he leisurely comes back to his senses while Bucky is about to lose his own mind.
Some dark-haired guy grabbed his jaw and pushed his head violently against the wall. Tony huffed out and cringed in pain. "You know this guy?" The man asked, he looked really angry. Tony felt almost sorry for him.
Steve lets out a regretful sigh. It's probably his fault. It
So that what it felt like apparently, to be an alpha. In the course of one night, his entire life had changed. He went from being omega to alpha, from being a loser, the school freak, to being one people who look up to and show natural respect. Now he had a new status, a new future, new prospects and maybe,
Steve took his smallest butt plug from the box discarded at the corner of the bed and shoved it in without warning, making it plop inside his ass. Tony hissed and gasped and tensed. Steve played with him a little, pushing his own cum inside him and relishing in the spasmodic reactions of his body. Tony propped himself up on his elbows in a attempt to protest but kept his mouth shut and collapsed on the bed in the end, when Steve shoved the plug deeper inside.
There was a moment in Tony's life. A glimpse of happiness, during which he almost thought that he could make him happy. He liked to think he was a decent person. He liked to think he was modern and open-minded. He liked to think he could make it happen.
"It's gonna be fine, you know?" Steve said. "You're gonna be with Tony this time. He will take good care of you."
asked him to come here?
He hated seeing Steve cry.
This is a fucking
Steve felt a shiver run down his spine. The tone of Tony's voice was icy and he wasn't sure how far Tony was ready to go, neither if he really meant it. But he was pretty sure of what his boyfriend was capable of and he had absolutely no wish for him to negotiate his lunch breaks with his boss. At best, he would die of embarrassment. He wouldn't even dare think about the worst case scenario.
Steve let out a surprised chuckle and interrupted his boyfriend with a smack on his head.
Bucky's smile died down and he pinched his lips guiltily. He looked down in shame. "I think I kinda knew already but I was too happy to take advantage." Something sad pooled into Clint's eyes but he quickly smiled it away. "And then I got into that accident..." Bucky continued in an ominous voice.
"I thought you liked alphas."
There was always some kind of morbid fascination mingled with unjustified wariness towards transfer students. People wondered
He just wished he could hear the sound of Tony's voice again. Even just one word.
"I'm just saying we both drank a lot tonight. Maybe we should take a break."
Tony tore off his shirt and kissed down his neck, biting his skin softly, while his hand slipped into his pants and fiercely grabbed his dick. Steve was already hard and Tony muffled his moan with another brutal and languorous kiss. Then he pulled his hand out, frustratingly, and grabbed Steve's waist to push him against the nearest surface that was the right height to bend him over it. When Steve's back bumped into the dining table, Tony's hand grabbed his neck and squeezed a little while he kissed him one last time before swirling him around and pushing him down.
Tony shrugged. "Gregory's fine..." He just said.
And he was handsome, in every sense of the term. And people
"That's not what you—"
Tony isn't. He looks like shit. He hasn't shaved for days and he has dark bags under his eyes. His grayish hair unkempt and tousled, still wet from the shower he just took after spending the day in his workshop. He still has grease under his nails.
"But I'm not used to it. I'm not supposed to do things like these. My time is too precious for that." Steve snorted. "Besides, I'm too old for this."
"And I
Steve attempted to walk a few steps forward and shorten the excruciating distance between them. "I don't understand... " He said hesitantly. "What have I done?"
ago."
He could feel the blush going wide on his face. He looked down and up at Tony, who stood by him proudly, holding his hand and holding his friends's stares,
He was losing him...
He slouched on the stool and averted his eyes. "You're right..." He finally admitted. "I like it." He should be honest maybe, he thought, once and for all. Because his boyfriend seemed determined not to let this go. "But I'm scared."
He stared powerlessly at his phone with his cigarette smoking in his hand. Helpless, lost and miserable again.
Steve gasped and snuggled against him. "How selfless..." He teased, being sarcastic. "Why would you always think that T'Challa was better for me than you are though?"
His fingers, so soft and gentle, brushed his cheek tenderly, leaving a burning trail on them. Steve froze, heart racing in his chest. He couldn't breathe anymore. The touch so electrifying. Steve had forgotten, in his little quest for sexual self-discovery, how much he ached for the alpha, like he had never before.
"Tony wait."
that. It's not about sex or about submission. It's just everything.
Tony didn't answer but he stared at him, expectantly. Steve's heart skipped another beat.
"Can we eat, now?" Steve grumbled curtly.
Tony shrugs. He doesn't know what Clint is sorry about. He's never thought of it as something that needs apologizing for, not to
Steve startled and felt his face pale and his jaw go slack. A shiver ran down his spine. "I can't
"Why would drones be flying above my building?"
He glanced at the screen again and bit his bottom lip, smothering a chuckle. "This is how you bought this place, isn't it?" He said with an indecipherable smile. It sounded amused and bitter at the same time. "With a portrait of me?" The words were more of a statement than a real question.
good to be back. He even wondered why he hadn't come back sooner but the distance, the separation and, most of all, time had been a necessary thing he supposes.
He pouts and nuzzles into his neck. "Please, Alpha." He pleads in a soft, soothing voice. "I want to share my heats with you."
Bruce wasn't the sharing type. He blushed and looked down.
He just feels.
Tony didn't make any comment, however. He just shrugged indifferently and turned away, studying the task at hand. Then he wiped his hands on the back pockets of his jeans. "Alright," he said, "let's get to it, then."
in the boxes.
There was a heavy background noise that Steve couldn't decipher. He kept listening to Tony's shivering breathing before he started. "I think we need to talk." He said.
my dad would never let me—but all my friends know."
When he woke up, slowly emerging from what felt like a comatose sleep, he had a raging headache. He took his surroundings in and was perplexed for a moment. He was leaning against Steve, in what looked like the emergency room of a hospital, and wondered for quite a while what the fuck he was doing here. He could hear the muffled sound of Steve's worried voice explaining things to a nice-looking nurse and felt like they were talking about him as if he wasn't in the room. It felt weird, like Tony was no longer in his own body, like he had died of some sort. He was soon reminded of the sad truth of his existence by the pain he felt all over his body, however, especially the burning ache in his throat.
The alpha jerks his head up and brings a finger to his mouth, interrupting his request. "I know what you're gonna ask me and the answer is still no."
How to be omega, like he's always been but refused to before the war. Tony titillated—consciously or unconsciously... Who fucking knows?—and excited every particle of his body to the point he lost control.
"Yes."
"I'm serious, Buck." He said positively, leaning closer and closer to the alpha. "I'm tired of waiting. I wanna know what it's like. I wanna have sex. Why does everyone get to enjoy themselves and I'm stuck in a kid's body. That's not fair. I'm not gonna wait my college years to get my first kiss. That's so lame."
Tony sucks in a breath. "If I do that it's irreversible. I thought you wanted to be free?"
you need." Steve wavered, hesitant. He didn't know what to do with his hands. He stared up at his boyfriend, feeling anxious but hopeful.
Steve felt a shiver run down his spine. The lump in his throat was almost choking him. "Are you throwing me out?" He croaked out in a strangled voice. He felt the panic rise inside.
"Are you trying to scrub your skin off?" He said with a teasing smile. Tony didn't smile back but he felt him relax under his touch. Steve waited, hand pressed on his chest, until his boyfriend's body was free from all the stress and the tension and he started to brush the washcloth softly on his skin, gently spreading lather on every part of him. "Let me do this." He husked out, plunging his eyes into his. They were both cleaner than clean by now but it didn't matter. Steve kept spreading lather on his boyfriend's body, massaging the skin, easing the knots away, taking possession of him again until Tony was completely relaxed under his touch, giving himself to him. The water stopped running at some point and soon his hands replaced the washcloth and his touch became slow caresses and Tony started to breath heavily, chest heaving. His eyes were half-closed, his lips parted. Steve kissed his sorrows away, starting with his shoulders, "There is..." and then his chest, "nothing", and down his stomach, "wrong..." Tony gasped and shivered and wavered on his feet. "Or dirty," Steve kept on, slowly kneeling down at his feet. "Or ugly..." He grabbed his asscheek for leverage and planted a last kiss on the inside of his thigh, "about you." He said in husky, hungry voice.
"Alpha and proud."
All his efforts almost paid off and he would have been right on time if Schmidt hadn't pushed him against the lockers and knocked him out for a second or two. He wasn't very sure how long he had been unconscious—or even if he had really been unconscious—but he remembered blacking out, not for long, not even enough to collapse, but enough for him to lose his bearings and to zone out aimlessly in the corridors for a few minutes afterwards, wondering what he was doing here. By the time he snapped out of it, the bell had already rung.
Steve turned to him and their eyes locked into each other. Steve chuckled and gave his boyfriend a little tap on the chest. "Asshole." He muttered affectionately. They stared at each other for a long moment, reading each other's thoughts silently, seeing in their eyes how much they loved each other until Tony's shuttered closed and he leant into Steve, grabbing his neck to give him another languorous kiss, moaning and breathing heavily into his mouth.
office. Even if he shared it.
His voice was warm and soothing, a little mellow. His smile was tender and his eyes were intense and playful. Steve had lost his words.
Pepper sighed again, a gentle, comforting sigh. "They're not gonna hate you, Tony. Besides, you already know all of them. And you'll be nice and funny and charming just like you know how to be, and you'll
He has two omegas and he doesn't know what to do. He is lost and he has lost to them a long time ago. The moment they were down on his knees Tony was doomed. They keep manipulating him with their treacherous submission. They make his head spin with their pernicious scents. They're driving him crazy. He doesn't know how he can continue living with them like this, and keep his sanity.
"There's something I need to tell you though." Steve muttered into his mouth and put his two hands on Tony's shoulder determinedly, holding him at a relieving distance. "I—" He started hesitatingly. "I might... not be omega after all."
Tony heard his friend chuckle discreetly. "I'm pretty sure Steve would love it if you gave him flowers."
Tony sighs. "Don't be a drag, Clint! When do I get the time to have some fun?"
people but Steve, you could read him like an open book and he remained a complete mystery to me..." He paused, seemingly lost in his memories, the corners of his mouth quirked up into a gentle smile. Something adorable pooled in his expression.
He's tired of waiting. He's tired of being kept on edge, uncertain, of being jealous, of feeling rejected, of playing with them both like a puppet-master and seeing the pain in their eyes when they're looking at him expectantly as if Steve was holding all the answers, he doesn't. Or maybe he does, who knows?
Steve shrugged it off and started taking his stuff out diligently. He was already late, no need to make another fuss. Sam pouted disapprovingly but didn't push further. Both of them ended their unspoken conversation before the magical eye of their passive-agressive English teacher told them off with an oppressive silence and they opened their books.
"No." Steve blurted and Tony let it go at once. "I wanna come on your cock." Tony inched back and stared at him in a mix of confusion, concern and desire. Steve curled his arms around him and pressed himself into his embrace. "I want you to bang me hard and fuck the cum outta me. I wanna come untouched, just with your cock inside of me."
Bucky and Tony had been licking each other's wounds and found some balance in their relationship. Bucky was giving Tony things Steve would have never been capable to offer and, somehow, he was glad that someone could. Tony deserved it.
it, deep inside."
And Tony Stark had defended him. Just like that.
"I'm not mad." Steve whispered reassuringly. "I actually thought
Steve is lying on his back, his legs nonchalant, spread haphazardly. His entire body is glistening with sweat. Tony's hands are roaming all over his skin. He rakes his fingers into his damp hair, cradling his face tenderly. He gives him a sloppy wet kiss. His other hand slides down his flank, nails grazing the sensitive skin of his ribcage. The tips of his fingers trail along his ribs, brushing the skin softly. Steve shivers, curls his toes, wraps his strong arms around the alpha, sinks his nails into the skin of his back until he bleeds. The alpha bites him back on his freshly mating bite that's already healed with the serum but undeniably there. Steve's head drops back, he loses consciousness, sent to the vast ocean-blue sky in an instant. His eyes are still and hazy, pupils blown so wide, there's only a sliver of blue around his irises.
Tony squeezes his hand and cooed. "Oh look at him, all blushing. He's so modest."
Tony nodded.
He has two omegas, begging to take his knot, and he
After a long moment of silence, he finally spoke, a solemn air about him. He was clutching his cup of coffee as if his life depended on it. It had intrigued him, his order. Espresso. Triple shot. Steve didn't know many other students who liked their coffee black. He had felt a little childish when he put his latte macchiato extra milk extra cream on the table in front of him. That was the thing with Tony Stark, he felt small next to him. He felt small and helpless and his heart beat unusually fast. Too fast.
Real' bad. And he was already hard.
They let the silence linger, appeased, until Steve broke it. "I'll come here..." He started. "More often." And rubbed his thumb down his boyfriend cheek.
"There's Nat and Clint." Bucky replies and when Steve turns his head back, frowning at him skeptically. Bucky's face is amused. He chuckles again. "Our alpha is multi-billionaire, Stevie... I'm pretty sure finding a baby-sitter is just detail."
here. I feel safe." Steve explained, intent eyes plunged into his boyfriend's, never letting go. "With you." He paused, making sure he conveyed what he meant to. "I've got my own space. I have everything I need."
"So you
"But that's not when...." He started, unsure, "that wasn't the moment when I—I mean I..." He was stuttering, hesitant, growing more and more embarrassed. "I was just being curious, I think, but... Anyway, when I saw how openly he reacted to me I started teasing him. Frankly, because I was bored and I hated lunch with my parents and something interesting was happening for once. But hum..." He paused again, confused, lost in his own thoughts.
Steve felt a pang in his chest. He thought of himself and his own image, how people see him, what they perceived of him. He was just a short, skinny, sickly and useless kid who hadn't even presented. How could anyone want anything to do with him? He looked at the new boy again, his intent stare, the cute pout on his lips, the focused frown on his handsome face, his dark hair and mysterious eyes. His tall and slender figure. He hated this guy. Everything he was, everything he represented, he loathed it.
"Neither did Loki and I."
Anyway, Steve tried not to think about how both sad and funny this impromptu visit appeared and stared with interest at the scene. There was an unusual silence in the classroom and it was very relaxing.
"Dead serious." Tony replied in a lighter, but nonetheless serious, tone. "You worked so well together. It was smooth and genuine and easy... stable, fulfilling.... While I feel like it's a constant struggle, for us to be together... You were happy with him, you were...
Tony could not possibly be raped. He was
"I know..." Steve whispered croakily, words muffled in the fabric of Tony's shirt.
Natasha offered a drink to everyone and started to make a toast, thanking everyone present. She was standing in the living room in a close-fitting red dress. Beautiful but not too sexy, caressing her shape softly. The fabric thick enough for it to remain casual and respectably smart. Steve looked at her for a moment, studying her face. Tony was right, there was something different about her but he couldn't point it out. Her complexion seemed more colorful. Her forms more voluptuous. She looked happier. Maybe Tony was right, she had put on weight. He couldn't believe Tony had been more observant than him though. It was supposed to be
"Come on, Steve." Bucky tries again. "All those years you and Tony have been fucking and you've never shared a heat with him, not even once. Don't you want that? Don't you want to
"Still here?" Tony's answered, back turned to him.
bisexual and, at twenty-nine, was still considered most eligible bachelor in the US, despite them being officially together for more than three years. So yeah they weren't married and rather discreet over their relationship but—
Everyone laughed. Natasha grumbled and stood up abruptly. "All right. That's enough. Hearing this for the hundredth time. Time to pee. Where's Tony by the way?"
"Noooo." Tony hissed, words almost inaudible, his body tensing and clenching around the toy.
I loved it."
"If I may suggest, Si—"
Yes. He had.
They all walked to a construction work area in the neighborhood. Tony stared up at the empty summer night sky. He thought of Steve and smiled. And then he meekly let the three men walk him wherever they wanted him to go, a little unconcerned.  They climbed into the building site and found somewhere discreet.
He jumped on his feet, walked over to him and squatted on his crotch, straddling him. He caught his startled face between his hands to give him a passionate kiss. Tony was surprised at first and stumbled backwards, catching himself on one arm and supporting both their weight but soon he melted into the kiss and groaned softly into Steve's mouth, his tongue warm and mellow and eager to respond to Steve's forwardness.
He can't breathe anymore.
He looked at Steve's bed with his yogurt in hand. He used to love that bed so much. That bed was his sanctuary, the only place on earth where he felt safe, where he felt good about himself.
Tony was already rummaging through the box anyway. Among the bottles of poppers, the dildos of all shapes and sizes, the ball gag, etc, he picks up a big plastic jar containing a slimy translucent lubricant that he knows exactly the use for. He opens it and takes some in his hand, looking at the substance as the sticky thing shines and slides down his fingers. He giggles again. "Guys? I'll never look at you the same way." Clint glances at him again and smothers a laugh. He lets escape a soft chuckle anyway. He must be pretty stoned too, Tony thinks. He puts the jar and all the toys back into the box and lies down on the bed next to his friend, feeling the reassuring warmth of him. "Okay, I don't even wanna know who's using that on who..."
"Oh I was serious. Very serious."
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're bleeding." Steve remarked, a little panicky.
He stares back up at Loki when he can feel the slight brush of his knuckles on his cheek. Loki is smiling gently at him. "You're really very cute Tony Stark." He says with an amused glint in his eyes. He glances behind Tony for half-second. "You and Steve make a sweet couple. I'm happy for you."
(See the end of the chapter for

There is a moment that seems like an eternity before the AI answers. A moment during which Tony can't keep his eyes away from the omega, invisibly connected.
He heard the voice again. "Get off of him or I call the police."
"I made those guys leave." Tony said as an excuse, tone a little guilty.
When he wakes up, slowly, tenderly. He feels in bliss. He feels a sense of fulfillment and achievement like he's never felt in his entire life before. It's mind-blowing. It's unusual but not disconcerting at all. His body is sore, somehow, but his mind is at peace and his heart is fulfilled and he feels satiated, for the first time, as if his entire life had been a long and painful starvation and he was finally able to eat to his heart content. What a strange feeling is this? Tony had never known until now how long he had yearned for this, how much he had craved for it, for
Obie was there, grinning at him with all his threatening teeth out. His eyes had lost the supportive gentleness he had shown Tony all day long. They were wanton, glimmering with perverse lust, piercing through him like two long nails pinning him against the wall. Tony froze and stared at him warily. His lips parted as an unwanted, sordid desire pooled at the bottom of his stomach at the way the man's stare was undressing him.
Steve knows about rights and wrongs. Steve is his gauge... because the line separating them is still blurry in Tony's head.
When he entered the workshop, he made a beeline toward Tony's desk where he seemed already busy with schematics that looked very not like boring SI paperwork stuff and much more like a new technological breakthrough. He surreptitiously put the smoking cup of coffee next to him, exactly like he liked it, and attempted a hand on shoulder that he ran up along his neck and gently pressed at the joint, fingers on his collarbones, thumb brushing his shoulder blade. He leant above him in silence and brought his lips to his other ear. "I love you." He whispered softly.
Steve sighed. There had only been a few weeks since the party... but it was bound to happen, one way or another, he reckoned. Tony had always wanted to visit Steve's work place and get involved in his job, he knew that much. All those years he had kept away, respecting Steve's wish and privacy, but now that he had acquired the boyfriend's status, there was absolutely no way he was gonna stay away and refrain from coming here and humiliating Steve in front of his co-workers. He should have known better and see it coming. He just—didn't expect it so early.
A whirlwind of emotions submerges him. Memories and unresolved feelings. Steve was the love of his life once. His heart skips and he turns around slowly, discovering Steve's bight smile as he swivels on his feet.
"Oh, come on, you heartbreaker! Don't tell me you haven't noticed! He's head over heels for you."
Tony shut him up with a kiss, blushing embarrassedly. "When have I ever dominated you? You keep ordering me around," he snorted and rested his head against him, cuddling him into a sweet post-orgasmic embrace. "You're so lucky, though." Tony mumbled, humming softly against Steve's chest, "I wish you could fuck me against a wall like that too." Steve chuckled and brushed his fingers into his hair. "I could do it before..." He added elusively and Steve felt a pang in his chest. Then Tony abruptly lifted his head off Steve and stared into his eyes with a sly grin. "Do you think
him. Something uncertain. An urge, a need he didn't know how to fulfill.
He walks to them and resists the urge to splay his fingers on Steve's broad back and to slide it down his spine to the curve of his hips. The scent is so heady it is dizzying. What has he done to deserve such a punishment? All he wants to do now is wrap his hands around Steve's chest and rest his head on his back, inhaling a deep breath of his delicious smell and closing his eyes and then he wants to fall asleep there. And possibly never wake up.
Steve let out a giggling laugh. "You
Tony slides his hand up Steve's hip and wanders up his chest. He unbuttons the top of his shirt and slips his hand underneath, brushing his fingers on Steve's gland. He gasps and shivers in his arms, giving himself to Tony entirely. He doesn't submit like omegas do but Tony knows he submitting right now, in the most beautiful way possible. Tony shall be no alpha if he didn't accept it and so he does and he presses his hand, hot and shivering, on Steve's bonding gland. Steve hisses a silent cry of pain and drops his head on Tony's shoulder, breathing hard against his neck. He raises his head again and rubs his face softly against Tony's temple, taking the lead in the dance. Tony buries himself in the crook of neck and inhale his scent again. So purely and gorgeously submitting. He licks the gland and nibbles at it slowly and he knows at that moment that Steve's wet for him. He can feel it and he can smell it and it's so fucking
"More seriously though, Stevie." Sam said with a serious voice, interrupting Steve's dangerous train of thoughts. "What the hell happened to you? Care to explain?" There was a tinge of annoyance barely hiding his friend's concern.
Steve felt his cheeks blush despite himself. He didn't know what to say but he needed the contact because suddenly, the few inches that separated their hips was too much for him. He finished his coffee and put his mug on the empty bookshelf next to them, then he sneaked in between his boyfriend's crossed legs, forcing him to spread them a little and laid his hands on his hips. He snuggled against him, burying his head into his neck, breathing in a long whiff of his scent and pulled away to look up at him. "I like how balanced things are between us too." He said, not mentioning anything about what Tony had just said to him. He wasn't ready yet. He took the chocolate box instead and picked Tony's favorite before shoving it in his surprised mouth. "Open." He commanded before slipping the chocolate between his parted lips. A huge, grateful smile spread on his boyfriend's face as he chewed on the chocolate. His eyes twinkled and Steve couldn't resist kissing him and didn't wait for him to swallow to slip his tongue inside his mouth.
"I've been wanting you to bite me from the moment you stopped trying," Steve replies, voice raspy and broken at the edges. "No, scratch that. I've been wanting to be yours since our third time together."
"Steve wait!"
Thor's loud laugh echoed in the room. "But you still gave him the job." Thor probably remembered the amazing shows they used to do at their parties.

Tony opened wide stunned eyes. He reclined more, propped on his elbows.
"Alright boss!"

"Not hungry!"
"And then I got pregnant and I don't know how that happened." Her voice faltered. Her breathing hitched. "It wasn't supposed to work." she said with a high-itched voice. She had tears in her eyes. "I wasn't supposed to—it was a

were mistake.
Seducing is second nature to Tony. He's in his comfort zone, it's like being home again after a long travel abroad. Loki is not indifferent, he can see it. Even though he pretends to be amused. Something lewd glimmers in his green eyes.
Steve sniffled, trying to calm himself down and answer but he was too shaken up to control anything anymore. He felt his entire body shudder and broke down. It was ugly and Tony put his cigarette away and walked to him. He put a comforting hand on his shoulder and the sole presence of him beside him was already relieving. Steve could feel his warmth now and felt already better.
"Are you sure you don't want me to check it out?"
They were finally able to chat. For a moment he even thought he had managed to soften Steve's features and that the atmosphere between them had eased a little but rapidly the light chitchat turned sour and Steve found the way to turn everything Tony said into a reason to chastise him again until Tony found himself huddled and prostrate, nervously tightening his arms around his knees, his heart pounding hard and uncomfortably in his chest while he avoided his boyfriend's glare. The distance between them now was agonizing. Steve felt like a stranger when Tony only wanted one thing, be in his arms. He searched his eyes, trying to find a trace of his boyfriend in the death glare the man in front of him was giving him.  "Thank you," he whispered, meaning every fucking word, "for saving me."
Yes. Water. He's on it, like right now. And food too. And a warm blanket? Of course. On it! Are they crazy? Do they really want an extra blanket? Tony's burning up and his mind is confused. His feelings are going haywire and his thoughts are in shambles. He doesn't know if what he feels or wants are his own desires or his omegas. Which doesn't really matter either way because now, it's all the same. It must be his omegas because they need him but they don't seem to be able to speak their mind at the moment. Neither can he... That mind-reading is totally terrifying but rather convenient at the moment. Why did no-one teach Tony that before? Why doesn't
"Aren't you gonna invite me to dance?" Tony suddenly asked, voice warm and a little husky.
"When did that become a thing?" Bucky asked out of breath while gesturing at their joined hands, the surprise still heavy in his voice. Steve shrugged and turned to Tony, he had wanted to take his hand away, maybe because it was too soon, or maybe because he was still unsettled by the whole thing, but Tony squeezed his hand hard, staring defiantly at Steve's friends. "Hi guys!" He said with a confident smile. He was radiating.
And yet he isn't.
Steve he has always loved. He knows that now. He didn't know back then, but now, when he is whole again, when he is himself for the first time in his entire life he
Tony stares at him silently, lost for words. The smell of distress spiking in the omega's scent. It roils inside. It always riles him up, the smell of anxious omega.
It started with a doodle.
"Gonna tie me up, lil' Rogers?" He asked provocatively. Steve contemplated it for a short moment but he wasn't really sure Tony was up for the challenge. Sometimes restraints scared him more than they turned him on.
Everyone went on with their own theories.
"Oh Steve, come on!" Natasha protested. "Why would you ruin this? We were all so moved! Dump his ass, Tony. You deserve better!"
Another couple of hours later, it was already way past eleven, Tony was still hiding and Steve had taken upon reading Tony's collection of originals from Marvel and DC comics—the very first issues—comfortably curled up on the huge couch. Steve had been denied entrance to the workshop several times already and when he felt his eyes fluttering shut on the book, he realized he had no idea where he would be allowed to sleep tonight—he wouldn't just take the liberty to just go and sleep in Tony's bedroom. Not in those circumstances. And even if Tony would have never minded were he in his shoes. And even if Tony probably would not care. He tried one last time.
"I just remember we kissed on your bed, which was folded into a couch, then, I think. And I remember you were pissed at me but I don't know what you were saying. It's like it was happening before me but I just wasn't there, you know? You were just being a drag to me then, I was so out of it."
Steve tried to ignore the shock of realizing Tony knew and wasn't rebuked by it whatsoever. The alpha didn't even react. The news kind of warmed his heart and he hugged onto him a bit firmer. "Right... You like alphas..."
Why was he mad? He wanted him to tell the truth and when Tony told him the truth he got even madder. Tony shuddered all over and squeezed his arms around his knees. He stared at his boyfriend, bewildered, helpless, lost for words. What could say now? What did Steve want from him? No matter what he did or said he would keep losing this argument.
When he saw the house he remembered the limo parked outside the school and remembered Tony was loaded. It seemed even more surreal that Tony would ask
Tony ignored the sharp tone and let out a surprised giggle. "That's not what I said,
"Is it true that
"Why did you invite me here?" Steve asked, eyes still gazing at the greenness outside the large French doors that illuminated the room.
"—you'd like to give him an "I'm sorry" bouquet? Then, go for purple Hyacinths."
Tony feels unwanted lust swelling inside and his heart starts racing. He tries to ignore it.
Despite everything, Steve had grown to enjoy those session and, even if he wouldn't admit it, they had grown closer. He would even go as far as saying they were friends—sort of—and had had long and complex conversation of the purpose of life. Expected conversation topics for two normal teenagers stuck together for long hours of silence and effervescent with hormones, right? Right.
What does Tony need him for?
together.
Steve pressed his grip on Tony's forearm, searching for his eyes. "I don't care about it." He muttered softly. "I care about
is fine." He shouted.
Tony was lapping at the dildo, it wasn't even sexual. It was more out of boredom than anything else. He had a deadpan expression on his face and there was a melancholic glint in his eyes. Steve pinched his lips and swallowed the lump in his throat. He braced himself and got back to his task. He was almost done.
The tension in his body eases. It must be Steve's manipulative scent again. "What do you want to talk about?" He remains in his position however, not ready yet, to face the blue of his eyes.
surrounded with alphas. He was struggling to keep his head up, to never let anyone trample on him. He was fighting his instincts, all the time. What was it like to be Tony Stark? The only male omega at school? Steve had had a glimpse of it, briefly, but it had never been real. Truth was, Steve didn't have a clue as to what it really was to be omega and have to live in a world dominated by alphas. He felt a pang in his chest and a sudden surge of love and admiration for the boy next to him. The one who held his hand so firmly. The one who had proudly claimed him in front of the whole school. The one who was staring back at two alphas, challenging and unyielding.
It might sound as a surprise to you but Tony is actually a bit of a loner, and socially awkward. He has learnt how to be a socialite. He knows his way with people. He knows how to be fun, how to be a good guest, how to be a good host, how to rock a party... but none of this comes naturally to him. It is mostly an act and while he appreciates the company of Steve's friends and doesn't feel the need to pretend with them anymore, to be completely honest, sometimes he'd rather stay in his workshop in the company of his bots. He thinks Steve knows that about him, even if he never said anything, because his boyfriend doesn't insist.
One day he'd get the chance, to get a whiff of the scent of Tony's hair.
Steve felt a blush creeping on his face and looked down. He had never told anyone how he and Tony had met. Somehow, he had kept the details of their first encounter to himself. It would be interesting to know why exactly, although he wasn't really sure he really wanted to go there and look deeper into it.
The hand pressed harder, making Tony's head spin with the lack of air, and pulled his head up until he had to tiptoe for his feet to keep touching the ground. He was completely at the man's mercy, his life literally between his hands. Indeed, theoretically, he could probably escape this situation. Theoretically, he was strong enough to free himself from the man's grasp, except... he
And then Stark Industry created a prototype of the Iron Man armor on the occasion of the release of the first Iron Man Series. One that could hover about one foot above the ground for at least thirty seconds.
"Yes, goddamnit," he rasps. "You're gonna make me beg for it, omega?"
Steve stared at him silently for a few moments. In hindsight, he should have noticed way before. If he hadn't been so self-centered... Tony finally turned around and met Steve's eyes. He had taken his soaked hoodie off and showed of his muscled arms through a loose old AC/DC shirt. The smell of him emanating from his body and invading the room, dizzying. He smiled at Steve, gently, and held him a hand, as if he couldn't be separated from Steve for too long.
"We learn in the issue #7 that Iron Man's father was beating him, was that pure invention or was Howard Stark a violent man?"
"Yeah sure."
Steve was
She stared at him again and paused. "Look," she said in a sigh, "you were lucky this time, boy..." Her eyes looked concerned this time and a little forlorn. "It's not my place to tell you what to do or not to do with your life," she said resignedly. "And it's certainly not in my habit to make any comments or judge my patients' personal life choices... On what grounds? Who am I to do that? I'm really just here to give you medical advice and make sure you get proper treatment but... I kinda feel for you, don't know why, maybe you remind me of my son a little..." Tony stared up at her in bewilderment. "So, I'll tell you my opinion anyway," she continued. "I've been doing this for more than twenty years, now. And sadly I've seen my share of rape victims. Everyone reacts differently, you know. I've also examined countless boys or men like you, some of them lost, some of them fully aware of what they were doing, fulfilled with their life-style, happy. Some of them I've seen several times, too... I'm really not judging. I'm way past that now." She explained, without Tony's consent. "But you don't strike me as one who fits in either of these categories." She finally said, and then added, "you seem to have a really nice boyfriend, who cares about you a lot. You should be honest with him!" She concluded her unwanted lecture in a solemn tone. "And with yourself..."
