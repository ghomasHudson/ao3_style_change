Even after he turned the speakers off, Tony felt like he could still hear it in his mind, mixed in with the normal white noise of the armor and the hum of the reactor.
Steve still tried to apply pressure to the hole she’d shot in her belly, but more and more blood spread over the bowed boards and dripped over the top stair.
The rational part of his mind denied any connection was likely, but he could feel that their present mission was the latest detail in a very large picture.
Thor raised a heavy, shaking hand to his neck and unfastened the tattered, filthy remnants of his cape.
Electricity crackled over the black coils of it and it emitted another scream that he heard deep within his mind as it began to smoke.
The new figures, some of them still tacky and glistening, stretched arms out to the goat’s face far above, but instead of hands and legs their appendages ended in a clutch of tangled and elongated fingers.
The man had sealed it in a plastic pouch and set it with the end of the bag tucked neatly under it next to his gun.
They sat for a moment, and the scratch of Steve’s pen was the only sound. “What are you drawing?” Tony finally asked.
He backed away from the wall, one deliberate step after another, taking in the vast multitude of tiny human figures carved all around the black goat in a hopeless throng.
He would have hated it here, but the signs of life were all around; a garden and a woodpile in the side yard, a bike with pink streamers in the handle bars and an ATV in a lean-to shed, even an old generator.
Apparently he’d decided to look after Tony and that included making him eat some form of breakfast, even if it was already afternoon and he didn’t want it.
Finally he thumbed the buttons too quickly to let himself think and listened to his heart beat louder than the ringing of the phone.
Steve was fully encased in his own set of armor, one hundred percent Captain America, and he gave Tony nothing more than a nod of greeting, with perhaps fractionally less eye contact than he made with the others.
Steve ducked without needing a warning and Tony shot it, burning through part of it so a chunk landed behind Steve with a wet plop.
He crawled face first down the wall, holding on with the long, serpentine tentacles that emerged from the tattered remnants of a containment suit and had replaced both his legs and one hand.
Tony could see bandages under the loose scrubs he wore and a plastic bracelet around his wrist, but his eyes were clear and smiling.
My theory is they are afraid of a rogue agent or sleeper cell, and you should be able to handle that.
He considered putting a trash bag on the seat to protect the battered old upholstery, not wanting any lingering traces of the goat’s cavern to remain in his life, but he didn’t like the way the light shone off the black plastic.
He plunged one gloved hand into the writhing mass, grabbed ahold of whatever he could, and yanked it away from Tony.
Tony had wanted to blame the light, but the gray pallor of Clint’s skin did seem to have spread, turning the capillaries in his sclera dark.
“What if Thor comes back like that?” Steve finished, putting into words a thought Tony had been trying to avoid.
Behind it, Tony could just make out some ancient railroad tracks, the gravel embankment grown over with weeds and stained with rust, and the ruins of a turn of the century train depot. An abandoned freight car had rotted through sometime in the past and dumped some of its cargo of raw anthracite coal down the side.
Steve stood beside him with black ichor spattered all over his suit and his face, but Tony didn’t have long to see him before he returned to the fight.
It’s not a…” Tony found he couldn’t make the comparison out loud, but they both knew what he was thinking.
On the floor, the two pieces of the dead baby monster began to writhe again and each formed new appendages to replace what it had lost.
His eyes were shut tight in his pale face and he shook his head as if to clear it between bouts of retching, but he supported himself on
He counted out the number Steve would have given him, if he’d been there and Tony hadn’t blown it last night, and one extra just because he could.
The man had been a monster long before he’d come to this mountain, and a fanatic, but Tony thought he had always been a coward as well, someone who never wanted to get his own hands dirty, and he might still be capable of feeling fear.
Chills shook him and he was glad that the dim blue light made it hard to tell if the fluid seeping down his chest was blood or more black corruption.
Thor’s smile was pure indulgence, a sure sign that he did not even believe that the prototype could hurt him.
We traipse out to Bumblefuck County on some shadowy uber-spook’s say-so without even a clear objective?”
Maxed out meters and dire warnings flashed in his view as his suit diverted more and more power to basic life support and integrity.
“I got that shit in my mouth,” Clint continued when he was able to talk again. “And this place… this place, it’s never
An enormous carved mural covered the side of the cavern with the grinning face of a massive black goat, horns curled into a sinuous twist.
As Steve reached inside, Tony realized that Agent Carlton had been preparing himself, alone, in here about the same time that Steve had been asking him to move in together in New York.
Not even the familiar sweaty, greasy comfort of his lab wear to provide him with a shield, no tiny bulwark of ego or pretense of identity to hide behind.
Privately, Tony was starting to worry that the data was not bad, only trying to indicate something impossible.
“We were going to ask you earlier, but things got a little hot for a bit and we haven’t had a chance.”
The bright flashes of the repulsor beams gave the scene a strobe light effect, like the worst carnival fun house imaginable.
He’s been bothering HYDRA and organizations like it for decades to get a facility here, and when the CIA built one for him, he finally got someone to listen.
Steve held his hand, warm and solid as ever, and Tony nearly let the comfort of his touch wash him away into the cold, buzzing dark of unconsciousness.
Most of his stuff was messed up, all tentacles and weird fake inscriptions that he was supposed to have seen in dreams.”
Tony answered him with a small shake of his head, and Thor rolled his eyes in most un-godlike gesture.
They found purchase at the joints and vents first, and Tony screamed as they broke through the thinner plating at his groin.
He wanted to go home and sleep, maybe even in his bed with Sarah, but even out on the couch with the light of the TV sounded good right now.
A huge dark stripe had sprayed from her back along with the bullet and drenched the doorframe and the flowers.
In the pause of the conversation, they could hear Clint in the other room, retching and calling out, and Thor’s answering low murmur in response.
Tony turned one of his repulsors toward it and lit up the palm of his hand, primed to fire, as Doctor Machen at last made an appearance.
He could not form any further words, only wet retching sounds as he brought up more fluid onto the sterile green concrete floor.
The slow moving lift slammed to a hard stop, enough that he felt the impact through his suit but still held them both upright. Tony vaguely registered the distant sound of the chain breaking far above them and the rusty, tortured squeal of the old gears slipping and jamming.
He grabbed for it, ready to hurl it against a wall or stuff it under the mattress just to restore blessed silence.
Tony got a breath of cold mist, heavy with the rotten taste of autumn, and he gulped at the rushing air like the sweetest of wines.
He took a step back and adjusted Clint’s blanket where it had slid down so that it covered him again and murmured something in his own tongue over his fallen teammate.
When he could no longer get a human work crew to come down here and he’d taken over clearing the tunnels himself, he’d been tempted constantly to keep a conversation going over the comm link.
The old exo suit made more ominous grinding and clanking sounds every hour, and he didn’t want to have to ask his employer for another.
Cold sweat dripped, thick and ever so slightly gray as it ran down his clenched jaw and his stride lost its strong, easy grace, but his eyes remained grim and focused in their bruised, sunken sockets and the shield never wavered in his grip.
Then, something thicker and more solid slid out of his mouth and writhed about, a single black tendril tasting the air for the first time.
At the far end, a serious set of metal doors stood gray and immovable and the controls for them included a glass plated hand scanner.
“Whatever we did to close the portal worked, I guess, and once the link broke, the disease lost a lot of its strength.
The door he’d just come in closed behind Tony, and they stood in the crowded chamber for a moment in silence.
He danced on his many limbs on the very threshold now, arms spread wide to welcome the endless dark into the world.
Finally a black, sodden scrap of red caught his eye, and he turned the beam onto Thor like a spotlight just as the god took a heavy, limping step toward the chasm’s edge.
He overrode the normal failsafe on the chest canon and blasted at nearly full power down into the thing, the light so blue it looked white, and Thor’s lightning matched it.
The sculptor had left some of the details vague, giving the piece an impressionistic sense of motion.
You have done a great service for your country, and you shall have your final reward in your account on the morrow.”
He interposed himself, blocking and slicing at the tentacles so Tony could cut Thor out with precision.
You’ve got Agents Barton and Romanoff for the delicate parts and Thor just in case you need to move a couch up some stairs while you’re there.”
“And I hope you won’t think too badly of me if I admit I don’t want to go out there in the dark again.”
Steve began the preflight checks and Tony settled into the routine; they didn’t need to speak to handle this part of the mission.
Thor shrugged until his cape would cover his shoulders, Steve acted as though it was not happening, and Natasha and Clint stared up at the sprinklers with distaste.
He kept his voice and his hand steady, and pinned Machen against the stone wall with its line of crudely carved worshippers.
“Have you talked to Steve?” he asked, and he didn’t need to say that he wasn’t talking about the new information on Crow Mountain.
Not that he blamed him for not wanting to talk to him right now, but he had really wanted to hear his voice.
Mjolnir slapped into Thor’s outstretched palm with a blinding flash of lightning, and Thor’s thunder rumbled through the cavern.
His shield cut through the tentacles that held Tony and the suit’s systems came back online rapidly as they fell away.
Thor was correct; the local church should have been a great source of local information in a little place like this, but Tony did not want to venture toward the building.
“Thanks, Captain Wikipedia,” Tony quipped, but the look Steve shot him said he was far from forgiven enough to tease.
He worked the controls, out of Tony’s sight below the edge of the bed, and the back rose up enough that Tony could see where they were.
The cold, damp air made Steve cough and choke and twice they had to halt so he could get his breath back.
It plunged the hideous goat mural back into the blackness, but revealed the lip of a chasm beyond, a plumbless depth of unknowable void that was worse than the crude attempts of man to depict the thing within. For an eye blink, it caught one of the things in the light.
His mother had had her cross stitch and her soap operas when the skies were clear enough to get the signal, but ever since he was a child, Jimmy had loved to dig.
Tony raised his head and heard the sound of Mjolnir splintering trees in the distance and a low rumble of thunder as it came to a stop.
After that, he could be heard to mutter and sob, mother mother MOTHER in the distance, but the audio broke apart into the sinister hiss of the whisper repeating its terrible message.
Tony’s light faded by another dim degree and off in the unlit darkness the portal continued to rumble and chuckle to itself while the flare charged at its base.
They still weren’t really talking to each other, and Thor looked about ready to grab them and shove their heads together.
“I was advised,” Fury said with a tone of voice that indicated he’d been ordered, “That Doctor Banner’s talents would be better used in a consulting capacity, from a safe distance.
He almost didn’t respond to the routine check in, and then he said we might want to come back as soon as was convenient.
Even the morning frost was not crisp here, but formed a rotten cobweb film over the damp brown carpet of leaves.
I can start the drip on both of us, and you three will have about twenty hours to solve the problem.
He wanted to turn back around, head up the shaft and out of this state, take Sarah and the baby and move to a huge soulless city with no untamed woods, no view of the stars or low, ancient mountains.
Mjolnir hung from his left hand so heavy he was almost dragging the head on the ground and black streaks ran through the prominent veins of his arms and neck.
They did not speak of their lost friends, nor the fate of the world, the missing people, or of themselves.
He continued as though he had never translated any of the whispering, but he hunched into himself and Tony read confusion in his eyes.
He took the brightest lantern he had with him and clicked it on, leaning over and shining it around the floor.
She cocked an ear and listened, though Tony only picked up the faint rustle of dried leaves outside.
Clint gave up his view out the front window of the jet and took one of the back corners, fastening in with a “mom and dad are fighting” look at Natasha, who took the seat next to him.
“Go ahead,” he said, and his gentle voice made the emptiness in Tony start to fill with the dull ache of anger.
“I built a suit that can kill you,” he said, and immediately wished he could suck it back between his lips.
He descended from above the rows of bodies like a spider, the lower part of his body now organically connected with the cave.
He scrambled to do something, anything, but he had no idea what had caused the suit to malfunction so completely.
Tony had a flash of memory, Thor pinned to the ground with one shoving its way into him, but the thing seemed just as likely to rip his whole head off.
“Steve wants to wait until we know what’s in the mountain before we go in, but I’m starting to think it doesn’t matter.
“I doubt a bunch of dead miners from a century ago have anything to do with the problems at the facility they built eight years ago,” Tony scoffed, but he didn’t really believe it.
Tony opened the visor again and turned to the files, both on the computer and in their yellowing folders, and combed for anything that would keep them alive with tired, burning eyes.
Machen lay crumpled against the wall and the dark glisten of his blood had stained the goat’s leering muzzle.
“We need someone to stay with Clint, and you will do a better job digging around here than Thor would.
The thing collapsed, off balance, and it cried out in pain or fear, but only some of the sound came from its tortured vocal cords.
Her voice trembled, just a faint quaver, and they heard the crackling start of a cough before she cut the feed.
Machen laughed and his eyes rolled back and his back arched, mirroring the carvings in their barely human ecstasy.
To the right of the door was the most depressing bar Tony had ever seen, four wobbly formica stools pulled up to a scarred, splintery counter with a shelf full of dingy mismatched glassware behind it.
At the bottom of the plaque, true to Steve’s artistic opinion, small letters said the statue had been created by an H. A. Wilcox of Providence and dedicated 1934.
Tony could see in his face that Steve had the same thought that they all refused to voice: What if Thor tried to access the Clean Zone, and couldn’t?
Beyond it he could see a dirt road littered with broken bottles and cigarette butts that led to the peeling plastic and aluminum hulks of trailers and old modular houses.
His reading returned ludicrous numbers, distances from ten feet to ten miles to something like ten light years, more zeros than he had bothered to program digits for.
“It looks like the CIA thought they were running pretty standard telepathy and mental manipulation experiments up here to develop tech that can protect the brain from interference, but there’s one item of equipment Machen purchased that he didn’t bill to his official backers: an old mining exo-suit.”
A closet-sized refrigerated cabinet was set into the wall as well, a display showing precise temperature and humidity levels, and through the glass front he could see jars and tubes full of blood and various tissues.
Tony saw the fear in him, and the exhaustion, but also the stubborn resolve that Thor was known for and knew he was still struggling with whatever held his mind as he took the last step off the ledge.
He took a last sweep around the room and noticed Steve’s drawing paper on the floor under his neatly made cot.
The clammy damp of the cavern clung to his skin and he felt a cough tickling at the back of his throat.
For an instant he could feel the warm, splintery wood of the bowed front step under him, smell the grass and the fresh biscuits and the tinned beans, see the endless blue of the summer sky up on the mountain.
He engaged all of the suit’s exterior lighting and aimed the main beam straight ahead, so bright that Steve blinked watering eyes at it and Thor flinched away as though it caused him physical pain.
for makeup and jewelry.  There was an open chest filled with simple dark tunics, so Tony assumed the room belonged to the mysterious Natasha.  Judging by the daggers and the jars of what looked like poison, she was more like Peggy than he might have assumed.
“You’re remodeling,” Steve says after a while.  They had moved to the couch sometime ago, Tony straddling Steve’s lap as he held Tony’s hips, the backs of his thighs.  “I get you like the modern atmosphere, but it needs more hominess.  It looks like a tomb in here.”
“Well, Thor loves his brother,” Clint supplied, tripping and swearing.  “He’d forgive him for anything, no matter what he says.  I’m not going to blame him; Thor’s got the biggest heart I know, but I don’t think he’s able to be rational where his brother’s concerned.”
Not in the way Tony had kisses his fingers and murmured something that he couldn’t hear, but felt in his bones as
“Is this a whispering fountain?” Tony looked over at the other side of the rotunda, where Steve was stationed at the other basin.  He waved.
One year. At his one year mark, Jan had thrown a party, because that’s just what she does. It was a nice party though, just close friends, Avengers. It wasn’t different from an average laze-about-the-house evening, except they’d put up a congratulatory banner with his name on it. And no one drank.
The walls were covered in twenty foot tall mosaics depicting the American journey.  Natives to settlers to railroad workers to the Age of Steel.  In the clouds were silver tiles outlining the history of transportation.
He thought she was going to deflect, but she said slowly “I will have a daughter.  Some day.  Not for many years, but some day.”
“Yes Tony, nail polish,” Steve responded, because now Tony had the inspired gleam in his eye that most always had him running off to the workshop, no matter how close to sex they were.
Still gently sucking on his finger, Tony began to dig through the box resting on a small table next to the
Steve wouldn’t care what the media said, but Tony would.  Because he couldn’t stand the idea of people thinking they were together when they weren’t.
“How so?” Steve asked, and Tony’s considerable attention was diverted as he pulled his shirt off.  Steve smirked knowingly.
Steve chuckled, low in his chest but somehow hollow. “Not covert in the slightest. But special ops, sure.”
He gives himself eye slits, with mirrored panels, so no one can see anything of an unguarded expression.
He feels bad comparing dragons to humans, but finds it impossible not to. The shell is a family, in every sense of the word, but is also like a group of compatriots and of course the best of friends.  Dikost, Zoloto’s son, treats him like a brother.  Together, Dikost and Dragotsennyy explore the Urals and Siberia.  They fly well together, and Dikost is endlessly enthusiastic about finding adventure.
There isn’t necessarily any right way to kiss, but there are some wrong ways. Steve’s not what Tony would call skilled, but it’s not as though Steve spend a ton of time making out with people. He’s got slightly too much in terms of teeth, but Tony likes it. It’s fierce, brave even, but it so goddamn fucking honest. This is what Steve wants, and Tony can do nothing but reciprocate.
Tony had been seated at the far end of the table, away from the direct glare of the sun, which was thankfully to his back.  Instead he had a full-frontal view of the Portland stone fire place, with andirons that reminded him of the Empire State Building.  The guide had gushed over how much he admired them, how a city official had “borrowed them” for his office, and his thievery was the only reason they had been recovered.  The guide had mentioned the clock over the fireplace, along with every other clock in the terminal, were mechanically synced to the large clock on the façade outside.  That had piqued his interest, but when he had asked about the logistics, the man had simply said “Oh, the engineer must have thought it was easy.”  More like a challenge that he couldn’t NOT tackle, if Tony knew engineers.
(it had been a lesser one this year), so it was just about as scorching as possible for a summer to be.  The rough road was cracked, with no mud patches to speak of.  With every footstep, he kicked up clouds of dust that stuck in the crevices of his greaves and his sweaty legs.  The sea to his right taunted him, the ebb and flow singing a song of icy water, when all he would find were sharp boulders.
Eventually, they slowed to a crawl as they reached a section of beach between the cliffs, carved out by a small bubbling stream.  It formed a small rocky harbor, not big enough and too boulder-strewn for proper ships, but if necessary could shelter fishing boats from a squall.  The area seemed almost untouched, pristine from lack of human traffic.  The only trace of civilization was a small altar hollowed out from one of the boulders, filled with a few pieces of fruit and chunks of wool.  The tide was rising fast, and soon the contents of the altar would be out with the waves.
, what’re you gonna do, steal my kidney and . . . sell it?  Could you please not do anything awful for . . . five seconds?  What’d she just do to me?”
A workman, not a prince?  That was certainly how he viewed himself.  Invoking Atlas, carrying the world on his shoulders?  That couldn’t be good, but what could he do.  Strong new alloys that would be needed to keep up with the stresses of a war?  It didn’t sound good, but wording it that way made it seem like a challenge that Tony would happily undertake.  He liked a good challenge.  He knew that war wasn’t as glorious as the poets made it out to be, but he could handle it.
Steve is completely still, eyelashes fanning softly over the bags under his eyes. His breathing is quick and shallow, and when he finally speaks, it’s a croak. “Am I dreaming? Tell me I’m gonna get a call in a second, and none of this will be real – “ he yelps as Tony digs his nails sharply into the tender flesh behind his ears.
“I’ve only met one person who would even qualify. And that was only for a few minutes.” He shifted and looked behind him. “Can we drop this for right now? I need to sort myself out.”
But this is a danger that metal can’t defend him from. It may be possible to rewire his brain, enfold his bones over armor, but the phrase “iron will” is nothing more than a metaphor.
He swung around to see the alarm’s light blinking steadily. The pattern of flashes – long short long short pause – indicated a Code C, a person attempting to access a secure area that was not accessible without Tony’s presence and permission, likely one of the vaults beneath him. Tony was about to lurch over to the attaché case when he noticed the golden gauntlets already covering his arms.
“Let’s go with that.  Anyway, I saw something that my mother always wanted, but learning a bit more about it, I thought of you.”  Steve shrugs and holds out the box.  “I had to order it off an antiques dealer, but well.”
America".  Boiling hostility rolled off of Tony in crashing waves, but Steve stood in their onslaught, determined to see this out, to see where this led.
Tony had rigged an entire system of straps, so both he and Steve would be able to wear the arto-utero in the position a pregnant woman would.  It wasn’t necessary to wear at all times, but Steve and Tony had agreed that they would try and keep it on when they were home at least.  They wanted the twins to have the physical connection and movements that infants usually experienced.  They would need to take it off when on missions or in public, but they had already come up with a list of comebacks for anything the other Avengers would have to say.
“Your shield.  I – I.  I know this sounds crazy, but I saw it being forged.  I helped.  I spent a lot of time in the forges in the southern caves of the Kekropia.  There was a smith . . . he was like a hallucination.  Only I could see him.  But he was so
The water in the shower is lukewarm and gritty with sand.  It reminds him of the public showers on Cape Cod, and they both make him wonder if he will ever be clean.
The crackle of fire on metal makes him act.  He swoops out with a claw, hooking Steve by the shield harness on his back and takes off.  A decent-sized hole has burned through the sagging ceiling, and by pulling all six limbs close to his body, he flies out.
They passed once again through the back courtyard.  “Just for your information, we spend a lot of time here.  This and the orchard just behind us act as our exercise yard.  But Steve likes to mix it up, take us around the island to practice different tasks.  We also bathe out here every six days or so,” Natasha supplied, stopping only a moment to bend down and run her fingers across the pebble mosaic.
“Shh, Green Bean, part of the proceeds goes to charity.  Pepper, have the marketing people approved?”
Steve worship was just another element of Howard’s preoccupation with the Hydric War.  Howard was obsessed with the war.  He remained in a constant state of apathy to everything around him, unless word came that an old ally was coming to visit.  Then was thrown into his nostalgic anger.  As with most men, Howard could not let go of the past.  His glory days were long over, but he clung to them with all he had, as he had abandoned everything else.  Tony was surprised that Howard hadn’t declared another war, just for the sake of replaying the past.
with Steve, in a group setting, because they don't want to let this change the team dynamic, and it’s both wonderful and terrible, because if things were slightly different, Steve’s arm would be around his waist and he would be able to make snide comments in Steve’s ear, and Steve would favor him with a smile that belonged only to Tony.
Thor rumbled in agreement.  “I have savored and enjoyed many Midgardian cuisines with great delight.  This,” he gestured with limp fry, “is not one of those times.”
“Don’t need to be. The title of bodyguard is . . . honorary. Or just something for the accounting people to write down. I get . . . caught up in Iron Man’s exploits often enough. You’d be more . . . doing whatever is needed. Accompanying me on trips. That sort of thing. Does that appeal to you at all?”
“They do this every year?” Tony asked, taking in the red, silver, and blue Mardi Gras beads, flag bandanas, and patriotic sunglasses.
Tony gently pawed at Steve’s nose, eyes wide like he was discovering a  new element with a high atomic number but remained stable.
Rhodey sets the pastry box down as Tony screws the top off and smells strong coffee. He foregoes the small cup in the cap, and drinks directly from the thermos.  Rhodey just sighs, shakes his head, and roots through a drawer for a pair of scissors.  Carol is bowed over, wheezing.
But most people weren’t in a relationship with a man who as a side effect of genetic modification had an untamable libido.  Steve had been out West for two days, but the night before he left . . . he hadn’t
into his hands.  The leather straps were attached with hooks that were directly welded onto the backing metal.  This was no sheet of bronze hammered over a wooden disk.  The curve of the metal was exquisite; there were no imperfections or lopsided edges.  The front was smooth save for a raised star design in the center.  The red and blue paint formed a simple meander pattern around the circumference.  While the paint was worn and scratched in places, the metal remained uncorrupted.
“Tell me what?”  They just smiled and exchanged glances.  “Realize I’m going to be annoying if you don’t tell me.”
The man cut him off. “Look, I’m scared enough without any help from you! Just – work with me here? Can you stand?”
“I’ve made up my mind,” Howard declared as he poured some unwatered wine into his cup, covering a similar scene to that on the wall.  “I need an heir who knows how to handle himself.”
“Well,” Tony conceded to her fierce eyes.  “There’s my mother.  I think I love her more than anything.  Pepper, my sister.  She sort of runs my life.  Rhodey, my brother.  He’s like my second-in-command.  Peggy and Angie.  A few friends, smattered across the mainland and the Peloponnese.  My mother’s family in Zancle, though I rarely see them.  And, that’s it, I think.”
“Calm down, Steve.  You two needed to get together already.  So what if we had a friendly wager on it,” Natasha smiled like the Cheshire Cat, “you’re together.  The end goal has been achieved.”
he was, making sure he was safe, not in captivity, he always made sure he was at home surrounded by the things he made.  (Pepper and Steve always complained at him about sleeping down in the workshop, but it was the only place he woke up completely knowing his surroundings.)
“Why is it that male heroes die and go to Hades, and female heroes get immortality?” Tony wondered aloud, moving over to sit cross-legged on the ground near Makris and Korkyra.
more than you ever needed to know about that in the first place.  Let’s just say Steve is a man who expects monogamy.  I can’t give him that, not in my line of work, and I could never move to Korkyra.  How he lives there,” she shivered, “I don’t know.”
Tony stood there, frozen, and Steve decided he was already in too deep, so he grabbed Tony’s jaw and kissed him.
.  He’s – he’s made his own decisions, ones that weren’t easy to make.  He gained a kingship that he takes seriously.  Most kings don’t.”
A few days ago, Tony might have debated it.  However, now the only thing he could do was turn to Steve and say, “How are you not keeled over in exhaustion?  You’re remarkable.”
Tony pulled the arc reactor from his chest and pulled the smoking piece of rare metal from the core.  He pulled another slab from the elegant wooden box Pepper had given him.  He pushed the device containing the new piece of palladium back in the socket.
“Fancy seeing you here,” a voice interrupted, hazy with sleep.  Steve looked up from a packet on the caring of stitches to see a fuzzy, bedhead ridden Tony, grinning lazily at him.
It was risky, would destroy his office in the process, but it might be his only chance. He dug through his belt, immediately finding the necessary components. Behind him, Shapanka huffed as he clawed his way out of the trapdoor. Tony was just sliding the last piece into place as Shapanka finally rose from the hole. “And now,
He could feel a dull ache in his bones, like he hadn’t moved in a long while.  He felt like the fish Bucky had found frozen in a block of ice from the harbor after a flash freeze.  They had put the block in a soup pot and melted it over the stove.  When the ice had melted, the fish’s insides were still frozen slightly, but it had still been malleable.  They had taken turns trying to make Bucky’s sisters touch it, and had laughed at their screams.
Shapanka was a genius, even if he was twisted. He’d come to Tony, blathering about immortality and cryogenics, but Tony had hired him to keep an eye on him and direct his genius towards different pursuits. Obviously it hadn’t worked.
Warm fingertips grazed his jaw, as Steve tilted Tony’s head so he could meet his eyes.  “Is that why you decided to become a hero, Tony?”
“Um, I think you’re set.” Pepper nodded impatiently as she described the unexpected situation to Brenda’s receptionist. “Well then, I should get going.”
Steve sighs and strolls around the table, manipulating the map so it turns into a 3-D hologram of the globe. Irregular green shapes overlapping with and surrounded by red triangular markers are scattered across the planet.  “A bunch of intel was uncovered after a raid on one of Zemo’s hideouts.  He’s researching something.  He doesn’t know much, or at least didn’t record much.  But the red markings have dates and data files attached – “ Steve taps a few, bringing up news reports and blurry night sky images “ – which are about UFO, meteorite, et cetera sightings.  Our best guess is that he was trying to place and track down whatever caused the abnormalities.”
Hulk spotted him too.  There was a roar, and a crash, as Hulk caught Stark from his free-fall.  He jumped and laid him on the asphalt.
There weren’t many people in the cafeteria.  There were a small group of people in scrubs gossiping and picking at their packed lunches. Over by the exit, three middle-aged men and a middle-aged woman were talking in muted voices as one man tried to wrestle with a sniffing toddler.  They were going over some paperwork, their expressions pinched.  An old man was sitting at the head of the table, eyes unseeing as he fussed idly with his wedding band where his hands were folded around a coffee cup.  As Steve watched, the man shook his head and cut his children off.  “Just pull it.  She’d rather go with dignity.”
Natasha knelt on the mosaic ground, fussing with the contents of a box.  As Tony neared, she cursed and picked up a large shallow pyxis, maybe a pous in diameter.  Wordlessly, she passed the jar to him, and began stashing away her things: other pyxides, bundles of dried herbs and flowers, vials sealed in wax.
“Steve?” Tony looked at him for a long moment; Steve was still staring at the front of Tony’s sweatshirt.  “Oh.
Stop making excuses for yourself.  It’s not your fault that Ultron went the way he did, but you were the one messing around with playing god.  It’s done.  You can’t change the past.  But you could fucking
It does make sense.   Humans can’t usually stand each other, let alone something else.  “How old are you?”
Tony stayed alert, listening intently as Steve’s breathing evened to sleep once more.  The stickiness would have to be dealt with in the morning.
Steve didn’t much care for the polish, but he loved what it was doing.  Before, Bucky had been so withdrawn, hesitant to get involved to socializing.  Everyone had tried their best to get him involved, but it had never caught.  Now, slowly but surely, he was beginning to act like the smartass Steve had once know.  More mature, less happy-go-lucky, but more relaxed.  Like the nail polish was helping him unlock that old portion of himself.
Natasha stroked his hair, Bruce laid a comforting hand on his shoulder.  The three of them watched as Clint and several doctors on break tried to calm the god of thunder down.
Zoloto guides him into another large room, this one with what looks to be several whole roast sheep carcasses laid out on a platform. A neat pile of bones at one end has been picked clean.  She flaps her tail against a cupboard.
There have been many mysterious phenomena that he learns are due to draconic involvement. Legends and myths tell more of history than humans know.  But it is more dangerous than ever in the age of video and photography.  They know the best times to travel near human population centers, and the best ways to go about it.  The ability to phase into human forms do wonders.  Still, there are enough sightings of UFO’s to keep them careful.  (And yes, the Loch Ness Monster is a prankster from a Scottish shell.)
“C’mon, Stebe.  Do ‘t fr’ meee?” Tony slurred from between them.  He had been out from his painkillers for several hours.
“I couldn’t help but notice,” Steve whispered behind Happy’s retreating back, “but he goes on about - Pepper, is it? - quite a bit. She’s your secretary, right?”
The woman from before, the one Steve called Natasha, had snuck up from behind.  Her black peplos was hiked up over her knees and tucked into her girdle.  She had a shallow basket balanced on one hip, and a needle-like blade in the other.
Love is fire. Something unique to man. Something dangerous. Classified by some as tool, by others an untamable force of nature. Dangerous. Very dangerous. It burns when it gets too close to the core of one’s being. But cold is another danger.
have to let this affect anything.  We can – we can have, like ah, friends-with-benefits thing?”  It came out as a question.
A couple of policemen were handcuffing Shapanka, the rest were staring uneasily at the ice blocks of the several guards who’d been blasted. “Listen up! There’s a heating chamber in the automotive division! Find some trolleys and get these people down there! I’ll send Stark to meet you there!”
of you. Big-hearted Stark, tossing a crumb of freedom to a lowly crook.” He hooked a finger over his shoulder back towards the vault. “How about adding a few crumbs of severance pay? You have more money than you know what to do with!”
That phrasing was . . . wrong.  Who said New York City?  You either said New York or specified a borough.  He voice was off.  Her inflections were off.  The only people he knew who even vaguely talked like that . . . hadn’t been born.
“Already done.”  Clint smiled wryly.  “Steve’s been a sad sack the entire time you’ve been gone, so go in there and stop him from moping.”
There was something secret about the smile that spread across Steve’s face, like that comment pleased him or something. Whatever it was sent a warm flush through Tony’s system. Happy made a gagging noise.
He sits there, absorbing the warmth that comes from Zoloto's body, and the scale he now wears burns warm, and all Tony can feel is encouragement.
Steve pulled back a fist, curious of JARVIS’s tone.  The AI sounded cautious, but then, Steve looked out and saw night had fallen.  He only used the punching bags when he was angry or frustrated, otherwise preferring to use the other training equipment.  Repeatedly hammering the bags for hours at a time was no help whatsoever in gleaning new skills.  It didn’t do much in terms of releasing frustration either, but then again, someone usually came by and distracted him.  Usually Tony.
When the blast died down, the man untucked his chin from where it was hooked over Tony’s shoulder and glanced behind them. The track’s fire crew was approaching carefully, wary of sudden flares and hotspots, and as quickly as possible, began spraying powdered fire suppressants.
Water vapor fills his nose, and it tries freezing his hair, his beard, his eyebrows. He feels Dikost pull and maneuver his body in such a way that sends them in a series of spiraling loops through the thin, laden air.
Steve leaned back against the door, pulling Tony’s left hand up to his mouth, kissing the knuckle on the fourth finger, eyes impossibly bright.  “You’re the genius.”
They were quiet as Rhodey got out of the van and sauntered towards the door, holding it open for a little old Asian lady carrying an armload of Mexican bagged pastries.
They were in Jersey (because, where else would sewer goblins crawl onto the street and start spraying acid?), and never let it be said that Jersey put anyone in a decent mood.

Around sunset, he was lucky enough to come across Pietro, the fastest of the Athenian messengers, and sent him to the palace to announce his imminent arrival.  He slowed the horse to a walk, and lounged back to cultivate an air of nobility.
you. We just have to give those two some space. Honestly, I have just about had it with their dancing around each other.”
“Nah, I think it’s time you took the heat for your actions!” (Say what you will, but the puns were half the fun of being a superhero.)   Tony triggered the tiny device he’s crafted, a miniature furnace, and threw it toward Shapanka’s feet. Ripples of heat spread out from the device, causing the metal of the armor to superheat and Shapanka to crumple.
Steve seemed very excited at the prospect of healthy twins, but those were the types of blessings one did not hear about often, and Tony guessed it should be right for a king to be interested in the goings-on of his people.  A look of concern crossed Steve’s face as he glanced over at Tony, who was lying on the couch at his right.  “How rude of me.  We’ve been excluding you.”
He crashed through the window, bits of glass glinting in the sunlight.  He heard the repulsors fire up, and he turned in mid-air.
It was worrisome, to say the least.  The silver band on his finger wasn’t a legally binding contract.  When they’d started planning the wedding, Tony’s lawyers had descended, demanding pre-nups and contracts.  Steve had turned green reading the papers.  So wedding planning was currently on hold.
“Pepper,” Tony ordered, nearly vibrating with rage, “see that Jarvis has her on the market at once.  I won’t demand a brothel, but at least a textile factory.”
.  But you can’t tell people that you know what’s best for them.  You can’t decide that you know better.  It’s a slippery slope from well-meaning into tyranny.”
Steve had his arm slung low around Tony’s naked hips. He was plastered along Steve’s left side, face buried in the skin and muscle of his shoulder.
“No villain polishes!” Tony squawked, throwing a cotton ball from the manicure tray, which Bruce had pulled out from under the coffee table to put the bottles in when they were done.
He glances down. His lap is full of wire, half-stripped so he can see the copper glinting beneath the plastic covering.  At his feet, there are boxes of nails, jars assorted bolts and screws, none of them sorted by size.  Manual tools and assorted drill bits, placed with their cases open.  Larger pieces of machinery, things lifted from the bowels of assorted vehicles and other places.  Computers and phones and tablets are piled around, filling in the cracks.
where he went.  Two new recruits also disappeared, but hey, I didn’t really know them that well.  There’s some guy who talks to ants, apparently, but he disappeared too.  And then there’s you – “ Tony pauses and sweeps his hand through the air, gesturing at the man sitting in front of him.  “And we both know you’ll disappear again as soon as we’re done here.  Family?  Well, yes, actually.  My only experience with family is it being snatched from me.”
Thanking whatever good luck had blessed him with a handsome stranger with Herculean strength and tight (if full) lips, Tony fell to the floor and crawled the last several feet to the outlet. He ripped his shirt open and with trembling fingers, plugged the retractable power cord into the socket, and collapsed with a groan against the wall.
But some of them, servants and slaves, thought being the newest conquest of the king was a position that gave them power over the queen.  They bullied her and encouraged the bastards to do so as well, saying Howard cared about
One of the newer slaves, Thratta for lack of any other name, stood tall and pregnant over his mother’s small form, scolding with a look of disdain on her face.
And if you think criticizing me publicly is going to help me learn?  By all means.  You are hurt.  But you'll forget.  You don't have to care about how this has effected me.  But it has.  Long before you read this and long after you forget about it.
Tony stretched and rooted around in his bag, before finding the flatish box with comic book wrapping paper.  He threw it unceremoniously into Steve’s lap, before crawling back under the covers with him.  “I thought, since you gave me yours, I should give you one back.”
But while he will hold himself accountable, which is more than many people would do, he doesn’t want to face all of what drove him
“I never assumed your father would be faithful.  What king doesn’t have his assortments of courtesans and slaves, solely for his own pleasure?  It didn’t bother me, as long as he remembered I was his rightful wife.”  She gripped his hand tighter.  “But he ignores me, and has his concubines serve me, and lets his bastards run free through my rooms.  You have told me that you wonder why I honor Hera, when she has not blessed me?  My sweet, she cannot keep her husband any more than I may keep mine.  But she has blessed me, more than anything else.”
The Raft had been breached.  Which was disappointing apparently.  No pet superheroes for Ross to play with anymore.
On his part, Steve seemed already practiced at understanding Tony’s humor.  He laughed.  “It’s fun, what can I say?”  Steve sobered.  “But really Tony, sticking to your beliefs . . . .”  He sighed.  “It’s almost impossible.  And the Athenian Court?  I can’t imagine.  You will need a strong will, Tony.  Thankfully, you already seem to have one.”  He finished with a conspiratorial wink.
.  The streets are the same, but nothing else is familiar.  You said this place was preserved, and I thought maybe . . . .   They have an exhibit from my war, ya know?  ‘Cincinnati Goes to War’.  Pride of the service the people did in World War Two.  We didn’t even
Maria was in her solar, possibly the best room in the palace.  The second floor windows looked over the center courtyard, but the curtains gave it an air of anonymity.  Tony could remember when he was very small, wrapping himself in the fine linen and pretending she wouldn’t be able to find him.
.   Steve is crap at comfort, but giving solidarity? He wins the prize, every time. No one is better at simply just
Tony laughed at the tiny cartoon Steve had made of “IV Man”, sitting in his hospital bed, trying to save the world while “Nutmeg” and “Patriot” nagged him to sleep.  He handed it to Pepper (probably to have it framed), and gifted Steve with an enormous glowing smile.
A large hand carded through his hair, but Steve didn’t look up from his tablet.  “That would be counterproductive.”
Tony coolly stared the paling Shapanka down, then glanced disinterestedly at the mangled vault door. “Don’t worry, Happy. He was just breaking into the cash vault, thankfully. Nothing important in there.”
“Nah.  I may be spoiled at home, but I’ve done some hero stuff too.  Managed to fix my own armor straps.”  They shared yet another laugh when an idea from yesterday popped back up.  “Actually, I was wondering – I saw the forge in the orchard.  I was wondering, seeing as it doesn’t look like anyone’s using it, if it would be okay for me to . . . .”  He trailed of, unable to voice the words.
Tony hunkered down in bed was different.  He was curled nearly into a ball, comforter bunched around his shoulders and neck, making only his head and a loosely-clenched fist visible.  His mouth was open, soft and red, but it was really only parted lips which let out tiny puffs of breath every few moments.  His hair was a tousled mess, and his face was relaxed, premature age lines only hinted at.
didn’t know that.)  But he was channeling all of his nervous energy into his leg, bouncing it at almost inhuman speed to stop from lunging over and pinning Tony to the table.
Morning.  Tomorrow.  Things would be the same tomorrow.  Nothing had changed, not really.  Steve wouldn’t know of this, not anymore of than he knew of anything else Tony might have felt.
Fury leaned over the backs of their chairs.  “You’ll both have kids; it’s in your files.  Do this for them.”
I’m . . . trying get this back underway.  No promises my muse won’t take off again.  I have also edited the previous chapters a bit, to keep in line with new discoveries in my research.
He doesn't seek Steve out, not the first time, because that would have involved immediately following him out the door.
Except . . . who was Theseus’s father, exactly?  Aegeus, or Poseidon?  There were plenty of stories of the godly cuckold, and the products of it were known to claim multiple fathers.  A godly father to bless them in their adventures and a mortal father to leave them a kingdom when questing days were over.  Could it be . . . ?
“Like hell you aren’t.” His words lower to a heavy rasp. “We’ll both be here in the morning. I’m not going anywhere. Sleep.”
The Quinjet landed on an aircraft carrier in the middle of the North Atlantic.  As they exited, a woman, petite and red-headed but with a stance that reminded him of Peggy, approached them.
“No problem, Thor.  We’re very happy to be here,” Steve said as he maintained a vice-like grip on Tony, who was trying very hard to escape.
After dinner, several servants swept in to clean up the remnants of their meal, and the poor poured in, graciously thanking Steve and helping themselves to the fresh platters of bread, beans, and game that were brought in.  It was odd, seeing a king shift so uncomfortably under the adoration of his subjects (because they most definitely did adore him), but Steve had just waved them off, talking softly to a few of them, asking after their health.  Bruce bid them goodnight, heading off in the direction of his little cave, and Tony had followed the others up the stairs to their rooms.  Sam and Clint had kidded around, punching each other’s upper arms until Redwing gave a disdainful caw and flew away.  Natasha had kept step with Tony, watching him silently.
He pretends, that it’s not just adrenaline, that Steve staring into his eyes as he pounds in is Steve making sure
,” Tony whined, slumping lower into the couch.  Bruce just sighed and went back to his chemical formulas.
It was such a different vision of Steve from the legends Tony was used to hearing.  Over and over, he was astounded by just how natural Steve seemed.  Nothing about him was kingly aside from his stature and his looks, though those could maybe be called godly.  Yet he maintained an aura of nobility.  Not like those of the upper crust, but it seemed to be in his very bones that he was kind, and gracious, and brave, and unyielding.
Tony knows he should bring it up. He knows better than to let this fester.  But he also knows that without anything to sway him, he and Steve will continue to drift in circles, gnawing away at the tender bits of their relationship until they’re both just open wounds.
ready at its side.  He poured a measure of wine – Samean, if he wasn’t mistaken – and took a long drought.  The mild burn distracted from the feeling someone was going at the base of his skull with a blunt chisel.
“Steve, a lot of our friends are gonna die. They’re gonna get old and die and there’s nothing we can do about it.  But the world isn’t going to sit back and keep the peace.  There will always be new threats, and there are going to need to be Avengers to fight those threats.”
“That’s Tony,” he responded, wistful.  “Maybe we can get him one of those stupid Iron Man body pillows.”
A chuck of metal paneling was ripped away, revealing blond-haired blue-eyed face. In his delirium, Tony had to admit it was probably the most handsome face he’d ever seen. “No,” he rasped, coughing, “I’m pinned by the wheel. Just get – get back.”
Pepper once had another name, one connected with holiness and virginity or some shit, but once when she was very small, she caught one of the cooks storing away the long peppers to sell for a gain in the agora, and informed Jarvis of his activities.  The cook had been sacked and she forever became Pepper.  Though she often remarked that she wished she had been renamed after a plant that helped with headaches instead of coughs and digestive issues.
came through the voice modulator.  And Steve was left to follow best he could, trying to see through the armor that had been designed to be impenetrable.
It was after everyone applauded as Steve and Nat finished the paso doble, that Steve approached him with shining eyes.
Laura laughed, a clear and bright sound, and Tony was struck for a moment with understanding as to why Barton would keep up this little charade.  Beneath her worn veneer, she was naturally very beautiful.  He wondered if it was because of the life she led and the stress of having a husband who was always off risking his life while she held down the fort, or if it was because he wasn’t used to seeing women who were allowed to age normally without the aid of fifty million creams and injections.  “Oh, don’t worry about it.  It’s no trouble.  Clint’s shown up in far worse straights.  It’s rare when he shows up and
“Peter and Maria,” he rolled around his tongue, trying to get used to the feeling of their names in his mouth.  They sounded about right.  Peter Parker Stark.  Maria Antonia Stark.
Steve stood up as Tony approached, and some little part of him made an annoyed noise that Steve was maybe an inch taller than him. “How about some appropriate introductions? Tony Stark.”
He didn’t know where they were.  Some part of him said Natasha had joined them, but another disagreed.  But it wouldn’t be like he would be trusted with that information.
In his head, he pictured the throne room in Athens.  Much grander, much larger, much more elegantly appointed.  Always busy, yes, but under the controlling grasp of his father.  And here?  Well, the poor were brought here to eat and sleep at night.
Steve didn’t fit in well with the social set, but he didn’t try. He stood, unobtrusively as possible for someone of his stature, off to the side while Tony mingled and accepted praise and kisses, but Tony could never look away. Steve was always one of the most beautiful people in the room, and always the most handsome man, so Tony wasn’t the only one looking. Many men looked on in jealously as ladies drifted over towards him. Steve would shift awkwardly under the attention, before he quickly found out that they dispersed as soon as he dropped “my employer, Mister Stark”. And for the rest of the night, Steve would watch Tony, and Tony would watch Steve, wishing Steve was looking at him because he wanted to, not because it was his job, before Tony would tire and tell Steve to have Happy pull the car around.
“If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.”  Tony enjoyed getting back into the sweet flow of science, made sweeter by the annoyed look Captain Ass-merica was giving him.
Bruce answered.  “I’m not exactly sure.  It’d be hard to get an accurate measurement, with all the rocky cliffs.  A hundred leagues, give or take.”
“Well, we all got back into town a few hours ago, and thought we’d give you a few more hours to sort yourselves out,” Bruce supplied, stacking the pastry boxes on the counter next to the fridge.
“Steve,” Tony said gently, laying a hand on Steve’s bicep. He unfroze, but still looked very troubled. “Iron Man has left, but I can ask him to keep Shapanka on his radar, okay?”
“Sh’t ‘p, ‘ony.  ‘e broa’ ‘um,” Clint said through a mouth full of fried dough.  He gestured with his box.
“I intended to sit you down, but . . . the time was just never right.  And after a while, it wasn’t very excusable all the time I’d wasted.  And to be fair, you would have demanded proof.  Of which I had none.  Just the heavy implication from Zola.  Natasha had as much information as I did.  Maybe more.  She doesn’t give anything away.  But he’s
“See that red lever?  It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.  Stand by it, wait for my word.”
They look at each other, and neither of them says a word.  It’s too early yet, to put a name to this thing swelling between them, warm and silky and
Sitting framed by the light, Steve looked so washed out, almost like it was another of the black-and-white photos that were auctioned off at ridiculous prices.  He looked lost, a relic from another time.
“I can’t say. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. Usually I can drown out the desire with work, but tonight’s just one of those nights where I can’t.” Tony sighs and curls into himself a bit tighter. “All my thoughts and responsibilities . . . . Sometimes I just want it to all
Tony had yet to find any reason why hiring Steve was a bad idea. Steve was witty and friendly, and everyone was obviously very charmed when they met him (maybe not as charmed as Tony, but still), and had already proved himself unobtrusive. He knocked, for goodness sakes. Happy just barreled into rooms and yelled at him. There was something holding a pall over the full brunt of Steve’s bright disposition though. Tony wanted nothing more than to figure it out what it was and make it go away, because nothing should hurt someone like Steve.
How funny, when they comment on his red-white-and-blue heart.  If they cracked it open, all they would see is brown, threaded with red and dipped in gold and copper.
but Tony didn’t say that.  “Now,” he croaked, and let his sword drop and impale into the dust, “are you gonna let me have some water?  ‘Cause I haven’t had a drink since Corinth, and I could really use –“
Steve loved the plant. His face was in a permanent state of shock and awe with a little bit of wonder thrown in, especially when Tony showed him their NASA contracted aeronautics divisions. He asked fairly intelligent questions as well, ones that would sound out of place in a civilian’s mouth, but betrayed an experienced military officer, albeit one with rather colorful experience. Tony spent twenty minutes watching Steve argue with one of his top military aircraft designers over having an emergency parachute for every single passenger. (The designer argued it would weigh the plane down. Steve argued it was a small price to pay for insuring as many lives as possible were saved.) The engineer was just beginning to condescendingly explain about the necessity of passenger comfort when Steve just raised an eyebrow and asked the man if he’d ever actually met anyone who worked in the military. “Actually works. Not just sitting on their ass.”
He was in the process of laying into the supersoldier-reinforced-yet-still-not-quite-enough punching bags when JARVIS spoke up.
Thankfully, dragons aren’t really “magical”. Some of them have an innate talent for it, but it isn’t something that all of them are skilled at or are required to want to pursue.  Zoloto does not push him when he says he has no love for magic.
“Steve, it’s no trouble at all. I want you to be comfortable while you’re here.” He probably looked ridiculous, but in the face of Steve’s appreciative crooked smile, Tony couldn’t help the look of adoration that covered his face. Pepper was discreetly murmuring to the operator while Happy chuckled meanly.
The high beams of the floodlights illuminating the grounds reflect off the grass, illuminating the room with a softened glow.  He’d had all the bedrooms outfitted with blackout glass, but never engaged it in his own quarters.  He’s not
They sat like that for a few more minutes, waiting for Rhodey, who emerged with two slushes (black cherry for Nat, melon berry for himself) and blueberry donut holes for Tony.
When some semblance of muscle control returned to him, Tony moved over to the bedside table and grabbed the wet wipes.
Tony couldn’t help himself from pressing a firm kiss to Steve’s lips.  It was over quickly, but did its job: assured Steve of how he felt.
.  Fuck,” Tony hissed, grabbing at his shoulder, where a line of neat blue plastic ran through his skin.
They scrambled back into action, helping him settle into the Stark Special, strapping him in and performing any last minute tasks he needed, handing him a rag to wipe the lipstick from his face, allowing him to clear his head from the distraction Lorraine has caused. She was nice enough, but she was one of the more determined ones after his ring. He wasn’t opposed to marriage
They stared each other down: on one side, the mechanical engineer who never likes to be wrong, on the other, the chemical engineer who is probably right.
“Have you seen a sad duckling?  ‘Cause I have, and the first thing I thought was ‘Oh my God, this pathetic thing, look at it, all it needs is affection – ‘”
“Making opium?”  She held up her knife in lieu of answer.  There looked to be dried poppy latex on the blade.
Things settled down. Summer had officially begun, so people began taking their vacations. There were a few short trips for demos, and of course missions for Iron Man, but most major business would be waiting for the fall. Tony took advantage of the ceasing of interruptions to devote time to some major projects that needed both time and close attention to gain the best results, including the idea for a new Iron Man armor, one more comfortable, less clunky, and a fair bit more stylish. He turned down invitations to Monte Carlo and Nice, and threw himself into his work.
But Howard didn’t care about anyone.  Not his legal family, not his concubines.  Only the comrades from the Hydric War were held in anything akin to love or esteem.
He nodded miserably.  Steve sighed and sat down by Tony’s knees, and took his hands.  “Tony, be honest with me.  Why are we in a relationship?”
“Damnit, Nat!”  He drives a fist into one of his couch cushions, because there’s not much else he can do to relive the hot, jolting
“Captain?  We’re ready for you,” one of the makeup girls simpered.  He thought about it, while squashed into the beautician’s chair, that there was no way three girls were needed to fix him up for the camera.  Especially how all three were consciously shoving their cleavage in his face.
“What about your sweetheart?” It’s tentative, very tentative, but this new thing between them feels so fragile still, even though they both know it’s stronger than carbon fiber.  They’ve just done so much to each other; they’re terrified of what might happen.
Say what you want about his father.  Inscribe his name on lead tablets and throw them into graves for all Tony cared.  Just so long as you never say a word against Queen Mardus.
besides scream.  As the suit stopped in midair.  As Tony’s comm cut out.  As the suit began to fall at sickeningly slow pace from 40 stories.
The next day, the others smuggled in burgers, fries, and a chocolate-caramel cheesecake.  Thor had picked the cake up from Junior’s, and had thought the fishing line they taped to the box to cut it had been a mistake, so he had thrown it away.  Clint had then gone through the nurse’s station, scaring them before he promised they could have some too, if they helped him find a way cut it.
Howard raised his hands, and slaves bearing wine-cups and platters of food threaded through the crowd.  Howard lifted his Steve

is perfect for Steve reconnecting with Peggy after he wakes up, if you read it that way.  Not the most popular Steely Dan songs, but both are gorgeous.
“Well, they won’t match, but hopefully you can ignore that?” Laura piped up.  Tony shifted the pile enough to allow her to lay the slightly scratchy towels on top.  “They’re not the quality you’re used to, I’m afraid.  None of it is.  But is should suffice for a couple of days, yeah?”
The storm is over.  Has been for some time.  It stopped as soon as Steve had carried him in.  (Funny, that.)  Now it's just hot summer rain, washing everything, blurring everything brighter, and making him sleepy.
Tony’s hands scrabble for purchase, almost clawing Steve’s arms, head, back, but he ends up with his hands cupping Steve hard jaw, the tips of his middle fingers pressed into the hollows beneath Steve’s ears, the token burning between their skin. Steve keeps his hands squarely on Tony’s hips, not roaming but not letting go either.
“In case you needed to kill me, but you can't!  I know, I tried.”  Silence. “I got low, I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.  So I moved on, I focused on helping other people.  I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk.  You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff?  You wanna know how I stay calm?”
He draws constantly active hands, the unceasing mouth surrounded by stark lines, the tiny curl of hair that shows up when be forgets to cut it, dipping into the curve of his ear and the hollow of his neck.
He eyes widened slightly, like she, or someone, had made a mistake.  He stood, relishing the height and the shoulder width, and how he knew they intimidated.
“Since we’ve had sex.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.”  Steve strolled over to the bureau, rubbing a rapidly-fading bruise on his neck.  “But I don’t know about you, but I’ve just been exhausted these past few days.  They’re running me ragged, with the whole CDC thing, and you know Hydra never really dies.  Guess I need to start burning everyone that I take down, hmmm?”  He grinned tiredly at Tony, then his face fell.  “What’s wrong?  Tony.”
The two of them looked over the side, staring straight into a turbine, which was apparently capable of flight.
with no shield?  Tony, you’re gonna give me heart problems.”), until Tony had waved the aquamarine amulet he had been given by the Head Priest of Hephaestus in the myriad of celebrations after the Hydric War, with its inscription to imbue the wearer with the creativity to improve.  Now that Rhodey knew what they could do, he wanted his own pair.
“We have to find ourselves first.  There’s a psychological map for development that has different stages for development.  Basically, if you can’t pass one stage, you can’t move on in the map successfully.  Gaining a sense of self-identity and how we figure into the world comes before we can fully appreciate the complexities of our relationships with others.  It has ideal age brackets, but plenty of people are stalled somewhere, or try to skip over a stage.  But it’s not healthy.  I’ve – I’ve had to do a lot of soul-searching in the past few years.  And ever since – ever since I became Iron Man, I got blown back, and I have to figure out who I am again.  I still don’t know fully, but . . . I thought I might be getting somewhere, but then the Accords, and . . . .
“He’s like a . . .  smart person.  I gotta say, it’s an honor to meet you.  Officially.  I sort of met you.  I watched you.  While you were sleeping.  I mean, I was present while you were unconscious.  From the ice.”
The air tastes of ozone. Thor is off doing . . . whatever he is doing, but thunderstorms can happen without him. The air is thick, cloying, the vague smoke-spice-rot scent of the city rising on the waves of heat. It is hot and muggy, and clouds are circling low, obscuring the antennas that top the skyscrapers. Dark, heavy clouds, grey and reflecting the orange of the city, rumbling and flickering in their depths.
“And you didn’t have to bring me pizza, yet here we are,” Tony plopped back down and raised his glass. Steve just laughed and raised his own.
“No, she’s going to be adopted.  She’s from somewhere in India, hasn’t told me exactly where yet.  That’s the main reason I was in Calcutta.”
He went down to Tony’s workshop, but was met with blacked-out windows and the thrum of heavy metal through the floor.
Steve gently peeled the tape back and opened the box.  It was a medallion, much like the one Steve had inherited from his father and had later given to Tony.  An equal armed cross, with St. Florian in the middle, calling for his protection of firefighters.  It was different from the one Tony wore, which was hammered and textured gold on a Figaro chain.  Steve’s new one was white gold and colorful enamel, on a smooth curb chain.  “It’s perfect.”
Bruce had told him a few weeks ago that he’d been alone for too long.  He’d snapped back that Bruce wasn’t one to talk.
Tony couldn’t help but notice the glance Steve shot the fresco of the gods in their splendor.  Poseidon, Zeus, Ares, Apollo, Hermes.  Whoever it was, it made Steve uneasy.  “Athena is my patron.  It is to her I owe my debts.  My mother was mortal, but my father . . . well, let’s just say you’re not the only one with parental problems.”
like it's truth is really faulty reasoning.  He's a logical adult.  Maybe his past with surreal shit allows him to just accept the dragons' existence.  He has met dragon-y things before, and much stranger things besides.  But this is like a Skrull telling he's been a Skrull the entire time.
He’s not going to push it. He has Steve in his bed, willingly, with the promises of tomorrow dulling the pains of the night.
Saying it's cold is an understatement.  "Frigid" is also an understatement.  There's really no way to describe a Russian winter other than a Russian winter.  It eats at your very essence.  It isn't
The horse’s trot faltered, and Tony turned enough to see the startled man on the horse’s back pull his
Steve lifted Shapanka off of Tony and hurled him down the hallway. The man stumbled but managed to catch his feet. “You heard Mister Stark,” Steve said through bared teeth, “
information out of people, Tony; Steve’s not one to be moved.  I love him, always, but it’s different now.  And anyway, I have Angie now.  It would have been awful to leave him for her.”
then?” Tony eyes were shining like bright flint, and Steve was sure tears were only seconds from falling, but he was in Steve’s face, tiny bits of spit landing on his lashes.  “
Around his brow was a diadem, with a Herakles knot done in sapphire and sliver with seed pearls criss-crossing on metal wires.  Freshly cut olive branches had been used to form a victory wreath.  He pulled at it when he thought no one was watching, obviously not used to the marks of affluence or victory.
He hadn’t been as torn up about it as he might have been, because of what had developed against his will when she had been gone, and he wasn’t able to control it, and she probably understood and saw it before he could name what he was feeling.
“I wish you all the luck in taking care of our dear Anthony!” Thor had shouted hurriedly over his shoulder as he headed for the roof.
, Steve wouldn’t budge until he was sufficiently open.  Sometimes Tony wanted the sting, but Steve was huge, and fucked him hard, so Tony was always comfortably sore afterwards.
“Let’s get this over with,” Tony growled, and marched down the desolate hall towards the door marked with the appropriate station.
They sat in the sudden silent darkness, Steve trying to wake himself, Tony trying to restrain himself from launching himself into Steve’s lap.
Tony retreated back to his little burrow at the prow, where he had his trunks filled with armor and a lump of canvas that was serving as a bed.  He stretched, a crick in the knobs of his spine.    Never again was he going without a mattress, even a crappy one.
“Stay here!” the nameless solider shouted before being riddled like Swiss cheese.  Shafts of sunlight filled the Humvee from the circular holes.
This was his life.  Go on an inane quest, return to the palace, deal with his father’s hatred, have an orgy, wake up in a pile of bodies, but still alone.
He had to admit Rogers didn’t.  He was smiling, and looked touched.   “I’ll make sure to check it out.”
“She earns her keep.”  He stepped forward, looking around appraisingly at the busy people darting about, very obviously not looking at the two of them.  “I’m sorry to be so roundabout, but you understand that ears are everywhere.  Even friendly ears.”
He touched the amulet of Hephaestus idly and jolted when it heated in a burst of white-hot that lasted fraction of a second.
Tony stared at his plate.  “Yeah.  He was always the one I could – you know – go to.  He was always taking care of me when I was home, and looking out for me, speaking up on my behalf to Dad.”
“Yeah.  Takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one.  But let’s do a headcount here.  Your brother, the demigod.”  He slipped one of his bracelets on.  “The supersoldier, a living legend that
“I suppose not,” Steve rolled his eyes before answering with a wicked grin of his own.  “Why don’t you show me?”
All of the Avengers received a card upon their arrival at the Tower.  The card, made personally by Tony, is made of a unique, microscopic aluminum – plastic compound, and acts as a keycard, credit card, homing beacon, another sharp edge for Natasha to slit throats with, and a ton of other things that Tony is still waiting to unveil.  The only thing that’s really taken advantage of is the unlimited credit balance.
She snorted, for a brief moment showing that spark that came from Zancle, that hint that she was more than a dutiful queen, wife, and mother, that she remained an individual beneath all her airs.  He loved that part of his mother, that Sicilian fire that they tried to smother in the cloistered rooms in Athens, yet the ember still burned.
He stares at Steve, and Steve stares back, and that hesitant tender hope that lingers within him is reflected back.
Steve traces the ridge of his brow with his forefinger, circling the thumb down to the bone ridge at the bottom of his eye socket, all coiled strength and still so
Tony whipped around, but his boyfriend was still calmly gazing at the stars.  His blond hair was almost white in the minimal light, and his eyes had darkened to match the sky as they always did, a clear midnight color of the universe fully realized.  He was still, and combining the strong cut of his jaw and the uniform’s decorations, he looked like a memorial statue of a general lost in battle.
“Things like what?  When to start the fig harvest?  The day after tomorrow,” Makris said with a gleam in her eye.
“Good. Let’s see what we got.  I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.  I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position.  What's it look like in there?”
The death sentence didn’t scare him, really.  He just realized he must have been hallucinating for the past twenty years.  He’d be dead in less than six months, and the twins wouldn’t be born for another ten.
“Boss!” Immediately, everyone’s eyes were on him. “This traitor Shapanka was tryin’ to break into one of the vaults.”
Tony was tempted to just stare, but now Steve was staring at him, and Tony remembered that he was supposed to be getting undressed as well.
They are quiet after that.  Until Tony just can’t lie there anymore, because Steve’s presence is just unbearable.  Steve’s arm automatically snakes out of the sheets to wrap around him and pull him back, but Tony quickly shakes it off.  They stare each other down.
that they have done that can’t be crossed.  It’s like a bucket of Legos spilled on the floor, and they must pick up every piece individually to avoid cutting tender tissue.
She shook her head, crimson tresses illuminated by the early-morning sun.  “You’re a worrier.  Wonderful.  Like I needed another one of those.”  Natasha stared at him for a moment, like he was a particularly interesting piece of papyrus.  She seemed to take pity on him.  “He cares deeply for all of us, but I suppose he thinks you’re a special case.  The rest of us don’t have much riding on us.  You have a reputation as a hero already, and it is not at all insignificant.  But you’re not experienced in our world, and I think he is nervous that you might not take well to it.  He will tell you, knowledge is power, but it is also an incredible burden.  But once you enter our world, you will not be able to return.  I can’t tell you much but . . . .  The gods are with us.  I’m sorry I can’t say more, but it’s not my place.  Ask Steve.  He will do his best to explain.”
Steve didn’t care.  He’d moved into the Tower, and taken up residence in that blackened crevice in his heart, the one that was clean and healthy for most people, maybe a little cluttered, but his was twisted and black and starved.
She heaved sigh and slumped on her stool.  “In my past life – I lived you your circles.  I was a slave.  I was an object.  I was
when I heard a woman say ‘My body is a temple’.  And then,” she sighed, and “Clint” went unsaid.  “I was being taught that sex was supposed to be something
“Yeah, just . . . gimme a –“ he made eye contact with the two others, who burst into giggles.  “Alright, give it to me straight.  Which figures from history are you two?”  Because, of course.
Tony turns, and there’s Steve, brow furrowed, jaw set, arms crosses, triceps bulging. He looks firm and serious, and Tony opens his mouth – to say what, he doesn’t know – but Steve cuts him off with a crushing hug.
“No, I get it.  I just . . . .”  Tony couldn’t finish the thought, but Steve didn’t need him to.  He clapped a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder.
Then Steve is standing in front of him, staring him down.  A broad hand reaches up, cups his face.  It
They were standing right in front of each other.  Harsh breaths came from both of them, and the air tasted like Steve.  He couldn’t tell you what that taste was, but it was Steve.
As different as they are, they’ve always been similar in other ways. That is why they’ve always worked.  They fit together well enough, but contrast enough to allow friction that keeps them in check.  No one can argue with Steve the way Tony can.
I could maybe handle it if they said I was having an affair, but they’re making you out to be the cheater, and I won’t stand for it.”
There was a reason he wore armor.  He’d worn it forever, but it had only solidified and turned metal very recently.
Case in point.  After he and Steve had settled into the master suite, they put on their swim trunks and headed down to the pool.  Natasha and Bucky looked like frozen statues of sunbathers, save for the alcohol both were holding.  Sam had found a pair of water wings and was blatantly disregarding the “Caution: Floor May Be Slippery” signs, running around screaming about how you couldn’t tame a falcon.  Clint was perched on the end of the diving board, peering at the water below.
“Then get up.”  Silent footsteps, then the rustle of the door curtain.  Tony continued to drool on his pillow.
Tony had his teeth gritted, clenching his fists into his sheets and the red fleece sleep pants he was wearing, tablet lying forgotten by his knees.
“Yeah?”  Fury raised the eyebrow over his remaining eye.  “And you’re a jaded Athenian prince who’s used to everyone coming to you.  Well, your court.  The only Athenians these people are familiar with are Steve, whom they adore, and traders, who they’re less enamored with.  They don’t know that the Prince of Athens is going to be living here for a year yet, but they can tell you’re important.  They want you to be like him.”
In Steve’s opinion, Tony sounded far too calm to be flying around, kicking strange flying lizards that were coming from a purple wormhole out of the air.
One week when it was going to be particularly slow, Pepper bought a new bathing suit with her company checking account and took a spontaneous trip to the Bahamas (also on the company checking account). She came back the color of a boiled lobster. Happy and Tony snuck into his office to have a quick laugh while Steve stayed with her, giving her tips on how best to treat the sunburn. (“My family is immigrant Irish, and we couldn’t afford most medicines, so my mother was quite skilled in home remedies. So yeah, I know a bit about treatment for a sunburn.”) He told her to soak in milk to soothe the heat and scrounged up a bottle of lavender oil to ease the pain. A few days after her return, he brought her a few tiny aloe vera plants, “for future use”.
Steve grips the ridge of Tony’s spine, and he spreads his wings. The evening air is cool, and whispers along his scales.  Effortlessly, they alight to the air.
Steve was on the couch, wrapped firmly in a pilled red fleece blanket, listed to the side and dead to the world.  He was so peaceful in sleep, like the young guy he actually was if you ignored war and ice.
The phasing wasn’t planned, and he’d been trapped, but he still didn’t like seeing his armor in shredded curls of metal. Not really salvageable, save maybe some of the electronics.  He has plenty of backup armors, but he spends so much time and effort on building each one and knows them so intimately, it’s not unusual for him to mourn them a tad.
Natasha sighed, picked up the three empty mugs, and walked over to place them in the sink.  She then draped an arm around his slumped shoulders.  “Why do you keep trying to talk yourself out of this?”
“Thank you?” Steve stepped forward, offering a hand. Pepper shook it vacantly, staring intently at his face, every so often looking back at Tony. So, either Happy had told her, or she had deduced it for herself. “It was rather unexpected.”
“Come now, my dear, I am enjoying my stay in the States.  It is much warmer here,” Frigga admonished, and Tony could tell who Thor better took after.  “And I plan to stay for the next few months, and help my son and new daughter with their child.”
She frowned at her needle.  “He didn’t even seem the same man.  Rough, in his way, but courteous and gentle.  Respectful, if you can believe.  But he wasn’t drunk, for once.  That might have had something to do with it.  He was even worse afterwards, but I stopped caring after –“  She froze, eyes wide.  “Did I ever tell you what happened while I was expecting you?”
Thank you so much if you have stuck with this through the end!  I really appreciate all the comments and kudos I've gotten!  I love you all so much, and I hope you continue to like what I have coming up!
Steve groaned.  Not in the sexy way.  “Just,” he pulled the sheet over Tony’s giggling form, “go the fuck to sleep.”
“You owe me at least part of an explanation,” Steve told him as he wedged the key into the crack under the door and walked away without waiting for Tony to answer.
, honey, plums, figs, raisins and other dried fruits, and fresh soft cheese.  Tony had never eaten much cheese as it was largely viewed as rural and military food, not exactly something for the king’s table.  But Clint teased him, so Tony tried a bit, and found he loved it.  He spread some on his barley cakes with a little honey and allowed himself to gorge a bit.  Less appealing was the milk everyone seemed to be enjoying.  Tony kept his cup filled with water.  He wasn’t
“No.  Anyone can have godly blood.  Many people do.  The gods are not celibate.  But they have withheld their blessings, to all but a very select few.  Might you know anyone like that?”  Steve smiled impishly.  Tony’s heart was hammering.  “But it’s not something I should dump on you all at once.”  He made his way down the narrow hall, stopping and pulling aside a curtain with a flourish after Tony stumbled up the stairs and reached him.  “You’ll be living here.  You can freshen up, take a nap, explore, if you’d like.  We’ll be having dinner in the throne room.”
The Ominmax show was starting in a few minutes, so a bunch of people were milling around, but Tony was able to duck past them and the doors leading back to the terminal offices.  Amtrak was covered by the TSA, so the door should have been locked when no trains were incoming, but when he tried the door, found it unlocked.  Shaking his head, he stepped in, closing the door quietly behind him.  The thick wood and glass muffled the noise outside, making the echoy nature of the room all that more prominent.
Tony made them pass his package around.  Inside were three bottles of nail polish.  A bright red called
The stinging intensified until everything was burning.  Pops sounded outside.  Then there was nothing.
And it wasn’t like he was a fresh-faced, just out of high school brat who had never been in the real world.  Tony had been shot at and abused and tortured, he had seen the worst humanity could be, had been manipulated, learned to do all those things right back for his own defense.
, but just like Happy being my chauffeur, they act mainly as personal assistants. But whereas Happy is the one who picks up my lunch, Pepper is the one to shove the papers I need to sign into my face. I guess you could say she’s the one who handles the business aspects. She’s also very good at nagging, so if you were wondering why Happy’s complaining . . . .”
.  We shear the sheep about three times a year to prevent them from overheating, and we’re winding up the summer shearing.  And of course wheat in the summer and winter, and barley in the spring and autumn, on a rotation of fields.  The sea keeps the temperatures down so we can farm year-round, though we get lower yields in the colder months.  We use olive pomace to fertilize the fields.”  Steve stopped short as they entered the quiet house.  “I’m boring you, aren’t I?”
The media room had become “their” room, an even ground that neither had control over.  Tony’s workshop was that, Tony’s, and Steve always felt like a welcome guest, but not a native element of that environment.
Tony made a face.  “Ugh, no.  You guys are disgusting.  Beer.  Specifically, Guinness.  And before you say it, yes I too am shocked that our America boy likes Irish beer.”
give him any – and Buck wants to thank you again for this new arm thing,” Steve rattled off, leaning over the back of the couch and kissing the top of Tony’s hair.  He wrapped his arms around him and balanced his chin on Tony’s shoulder.  “You alright?  You seem tense.”
did it have to be like this?  Why did he have to swear off all things that might make him happy just so he could be a hero?  Why did something he never thought he would find have to be plopped right next to him, so close but miles away?
Steve signed heavily.  “I guess that means we’re dismissed.  But, time for us to be headed home anyway.”
.  “Reading up on the fall of the Soviet?”  Steve doesn’t say anything.  “Worst Christmas of my life.  Had a lot of shitty ones, but that year?  Took the fuckin’ cake.  Even if I don’t remember much of it.”
The rustle had been Steve’s sweatpants and boxers being pulled down over his already exceptionally hard cock.
“Well, I’m going to try and hit as many places as I can, and, well, drift where the gods will me.  It might be next spring until I return.  Unless I find someone new, then I will deliver them here with posthaste.”
.  I know it might be a while before you become king, but what do you expect to do, learn on the job?  You’re in for a difficult few years if that’s the case.  Steve will help you.  I know he’ll do well by you.”
Pepper and Happy’s angry whispers were silenced by Steve and Tony’s entrance into the ante-office. It was largely Pepper’s domain, so her taste reigned. But, if she was willing to keep all the weird little plants alive, Tony wasn’t going to say anything.
Clint shrugged, heading into the kitchen to put the popcorn bowl away before saluting lazily and getting in the elevator.
The tremors of an over-worked engine echoed through the sound of rubble burning.  Banner was riding an ancient motor bike, which was puttering through the debris.
She kissed him on the cheek, then called out to Coulson, “So, any chance you’re driving by LaGuardia?”
For a moment, Tony simply wallowed in the pearls Steve had just given him.  Howard had never said anything to this effect.  “You . . . really enjoy fucking with me, don’t you?”
It was the running man.  He should not have been able to reach the port in the time it had taken the ship to arrive, but the improbability of his speed was lost when Tony got a good look at him.
Steve was left to flail his arms helplessly as Natasha looked up the song on YouTube and hummed along.
“And . . . voilá.”  Natasha turned, presenting a short stack of blueberry pancakes, piled with strawberry and blueberry compote, whipped cream, and topped with a couple tiny toothpick flags.
“Eh, Kronos and the harvest.  It’s basically a day off before the harvest starts.  We commemorate the Golden Age, and all social divisions are dissolved for a day.  It can be hard to explain.  You’ll see tomorrow.”
Nodding numbly, Steve headed back towards the elevator, with the strains of “Why Can’t This Be Love?” trying to shatter the glass behind him.
“That’s my secret, Cap,” Banner turned back for a moment.  “I’m always angry.”  He shifted as he turned towards the creature, smashing a fist into its jaw.
So he lets himself cling as well, he lets himself have this, because it’s damn well all he’s ever going to get, and he’ll fucking take it.
Steve was so tight.  Whenever Steve fucked him (which, to be honest was most of the time, if only because Tony preferred it that way) he was religious in taking his time, opening and stretching and scissoring.  Even when Tony
He’s coming to consider this one of the happier periods of his life. Every day is full of new things to learn and discover.  Zoloto has taken charge of his tutelage as she promised, and he is endlessly grateful for her guidance.  It makes him ache for the mother he never knew, but he feels her warmth when he thinks of her and when the shell tells him stories of her.
The man was jabbering about how wonderful it was of them to come, because the conference needed more exposure, ect.  Tony didn’t have the heart to tell him that he had no idea why he was there.  Something about American innovation.  Bullshit about the past and future.
“Steve,” he croaked, feeling it build.  He’d gone too long without this.  Not that stamina would benefit him here.
“Rhodey –“ Natasha’s voice was full of warning, but Rhodey had already pulled into the gas station.  He pulled into a spot and cut the engine.  “I’m gettin’ a slushie.  Want one?”
He was right.  The mental connection that people had with their future children was well known, as most people had it, but it was a rather taboo thing to discuss.  The only time most people discussed it was with a potential spouse.  Steve knew Bucky well enough, and they trusted each other to say everything, but Steve knew he wouldn’t be able to go around just having discussions with Peter and Maria out loud.  Not if he wanted to pull the attention of more bullies.  He might go picking fights, but he didn’t like when others started them.
Having Steve and at the same time not having him . . . it would drive him out of his mind, out of his skin. Vulnerable and weak as he is, Tony has no desire to die. Because he figured long ago that both having Steve and not would kill him.
that rested on its ornamental pillar next to the door to his mother’s quarters.  The jar had been a gift from the women of the palace upon his parents’ wedding, and had been used to hold the water that ritually cleaned his mother for her new home.  There was a beautiful illustration of the wedding of Zeus and Hera on the front, depicting the moment Gaia gifted Hera with the Tree of the Golden Apples of Immortality.  Tony had always found it an ironic choice.  Celebrating immortality with her death-sentence.
, and that’s what matters. You’re you and you’re there, fighting me at every turn, making me think, challenging me. You’re the only one who does and can make it get through my skull. And sometimes I wish – I wish –“
Steve turned to him and frowned.  “But I am the host, and therefore I should take responsibility-“  The rest of what he was said was drowned in collective groaning.
Was Steve thinking about Peggy?  Still?  It was the most likely candidate.  She had been beautiful when she was younger.
There’s a smile in her voice, and he can picture it, Nat standing in a blank hall with florescent lighting, grinning and talking on the phone while the other hand holds a pistol, marching forward and stepping over unconscious bodies.  Or dead bodies, but she’s said the days of meaningless slaughter are behind her.  Depending on the seriousness of the threat.
He’s been in Indianapolis, getting ready for the Indy 500, when the call came in from the FBI, requesting Iron Man’s help with busting up a spy ring in Chicago. It had taken longer than expected, so now he was running late.
They turned back to the wall, and Tony’s eyes were drawn back to what he had been staring at last night: the battered but still immaculate
Steve didn’t know how long they stood there, waiting for Stark to emerge.  It felt like another seventy years incased in ice.
, that vague ideal his father had always droned on about.  It disgusted him, trying to be like his father, as he was the mirror opposite.  Howard Stark had a son he never heard.  Tony Stark heard the children he would never have.
Now that he was fully in control of his body and had time to appreciate the man in front of him, Tony couldn’t help
He tried to imagine, for the millionth time, Peter and Maria’s faces.  They would both have brown hair, hers rich curls like chocolate, his lighter, more like honey.  Maria’s eyes vibrant blue like the Tesseract thing, Peter’s the color of whiskey.  Little children smiling, running, giving him hugs and kisses, holding his hand.
Eventually, they reached a small rocky span when there didn’t seem to be any farther to go.  Steve swung his pack down onto the ground, which Tony took as cue to dramatically collapse onto the ground.  He could hear Steve laughing behind him, and was about to lift his head to demand to know what was so funny, when felt a shadow fall across his back.  Before he could speak, warm hands gripped him under the arms and pulled him to his feet, swinging him around to stare Steve in the eyes.
“If I know you, and I do, you’re going to be doing this forever. This is what your calling is.  I don’t have any
“Sure, sure,” Natasha relented, turning on Tony with a lascivious grin.  “Tell us a bit about yourself.  Your family, life in Athens, do you have an
“That’s the name of the color, diphthong.  Get your hearing aids calibrated.”  Natasha was deciding between
He reached down and pinched his thigh.  There was no use getting it into his head that his father might actually be a god.  There were plenty of heroes who were only grandchildren.  Howard’s grandfather was Hermes.  Anyways, there were also plenty of heroes without significant godly blood that were still for whatever reasons blessed and favored.  Favor is what mattered with the gods, not blood.  This way of thinking would only disappoint and destroy him.
”. Tony couldn’t understand why he wanted Steve so much, but in a way he could: it all boiled down to Steve being so different from anything Tony had ever seen before. It wasn’t just the easy “he’s handsome” or “he’s smart” or “he makes me laugh.” All of these things were true, but they could be true for any number of people. It was how Steve’s brand of humor was just something that made Tony roar with laughter, and how his intelligence filled the gaps in Tony’s own knowledge. They fit tighter well, evening out the lacking bits. Sure, they argued, be thus far it was simply debate that left Tony uplifted and sparkling, mind whizzing with new possibilities. Steve did not accept defeat easily, he fought, tooth and nail, and supported the things he believed in with such fervor that it left Tony breathless. But he wasn’t sore or bitter about loss; Steve accepted it with aplomb and a thoughtful expression. And the conversation would not be over yet, because if Tony was to change Steve’s way of thinking, he had to prove why it was the right way.
Bruce had gotten a last-minute call to talk at a genetics conference that morning, and was packing his bags.  Thor had declared that it had been too long since he had seen Jane, and had disappeared in a clap of thunder.  Now Clint and Natasha had taken an assignment to some mission.  All very convenient.
Tony was still trying to process the enormity of what little he knew of what this island held for him as they sailed into the harbor, such as it was.  A few rickety planks roped and nailed together to form a series of piers.
“Yes, sex is more important than us deciding to admit our undying love,” Tony threw a carrot at Clint’s head.  The archer somehow managed to catch it in his mouth.  “Plus, we have a lot of time to make up for.”
“No, no,” Steve grabs Tony’s hands, holding his wrists loosely in a fist.  “I didn’t come here – I came here to – “
He has a good poke around.  The bed doesn't seem to have a mattress; it's really just a mound of blankest in the shape of a bed.  His spine may not love it, but it is better than falling asleep on the ground.  There are chests stacked around the perimeters of the room hold an assortment of clothing and pretty much everything he could wish for.
“You’d be right not to suppose.  Don’t worry,” Steve grinned through a mouthful of cheese and bread.  “Your curiosity will be sated before sundown.”
Tony frowned, climbing to his feet and brushing off his tunic.  “Yeah, but . . . .  I feel like I’m getting singled out by him.
“Nothing’s wrong,” he said, too forcefully.  He jabbed at the keyboard.  “Everything is fine and dandy in Stark-land, never been better . . . .”
But the normalcy of standing next to an eight-months-pregnant woman as she rummaged in her tiny linen closet was something very new.
“I hadn’t though about it that way.  But I wager you’re right.”  He went to work on the figs.  “You said there were some things that weren’t so bad.  Spill it.”
.  I’m not sure when, but someday.  Someone who will make you see that all the things you do aren’t necessarily all the things you are.”  She squeezed his shoulders, tightly, like she knew he needed something to keep him together.  “Now go, before he comes out and starts yelling.”
“I’m sure they’re easier to carry,” Steve ignored Clint’s stuck out tongue.  “Metal cans don’t travel very well, but we managed.”  He smiled evilly at Clint.
There was heady combination of both victorious expectation and skin-stripping nervousness heating the thick air between them.  It was caramelizing again, but this time there was no longing, no bitter feeling that comes with being denied something that sings your bones and turns your insides rancid.
He lets out a soft mewl of contentment, which turns into an annoyed squawk as Steve tosses a fresh set of underwear in his face. “Get dressed. I’ll get your coffee.”
Natasha spoke up first.  “He’s fine.  Let him be.  Call Miss Potts, but otherwise you won’t help the situation.”
Steve grit his teeth.  “That kid has shell-shock.  Get away from him.  You’re giving him a panic attack.”
Tony can’t sleep without the scent of Steve on his skin and his sheets anymore.  So as much as it pains him, he doesn’t stop it.
Back bowing, Steve came, crying out as he unmercifully bit his palm, jerking himself hard and fast as white coated his abs.  It was hands-down the most arousing thing Tony had seen in his life, even with the obviously tortured look on Steve’s face.
One guy in the crowd was filming the entire thing, and Tony was pretty sure they would need to have a meeting with PR when they got back to Manhattan after the video was posted.
He was vain enough to know he was attractive.  But they didn’t care for that.  No, the thing that seduced them was the potential of being the lover of the future king.
He made his way down to the hotel lounge. It was empty save for the barkeep, a waitress, some guy getting drunk for lunch, and Steve sitting alone in a circular booth, poking sullenly at a bowl of peanuts. He looked up, and for a second, his smile was so brilliant it was blinding.
“As I said, she’s a kid that needed help. I know a thing or two about absent fathers,” Tony said without meeting the other man’s eyes. He was the last person to pass judgment, he knew, but goddamn. Cassie was a sweet little girl who adored her father and would talk about him for however long they let her. He’d known he would do anything to keep her safe the moment he had found her and Hope.
“Only within the campus. It’s my alma mater, and I know how much those nerds fight for funding. Pep and I actually started a fund to expand it to other schools. Caltech, Stanford, Michigan, schools like that, but that day no. it was just for the students. I don’t see—“
“That still doesn’t excuse my behavior. I just—Tony, I feel like I’ve failed you so many times already. Long before this stupid war.” Steve drops his eyes in shame. He feels the pain and self-hatred slowly course their way through his body.
on the ground. It should have been weird, I should have fucking known, because the blood was—anyway, he was right in the middle of it. Curled up into this little ball and he just—I’ve heard people cry, before and after, but hearing him—like that, it was—I’ve never been able to forget it.”
agonizing over the lettering after the news had hit. If Rhodey is to be believed, he’s been obsessively focused on getting things just right for it. It’s black marble, and the letters etched on it are in flowing silver script. There’s a white marbled sunflower resting atop it, Peggy’s favorites, which Tony had taken great care of to commission perfectly.
“You haven’t lost any of us,” she says after a pause. Clever, as always, she knows exactly what he means without saying the words. She’s not looking at him, but he doesn’t feel as far away from her as he usually does these days. The moments when they have been this close, this intimate, are few and far between. He’s been stowing in so much anger, bristly and defensive at every turn, and her… well, she’s got a protective instinct a mile wide and an inability to let him get away with his shit. “He’s not mad at you, you know. He’s just hurt.”
Peter, bless him, inherited Tony’s brilliance. He might not have been his biologically, but there was never any doubt who his fathers were. He has all the markings of both. His quick wit, however, Tony is totally taking claim for. “She—did she—dad!” that last part is a squeak, eyes bright and smile huge on his face.
“Hello? Steve? Cap, is that you?” but it turns out his whirling thoughts are for nothing. He can’t even think of how insane it is to heart
They (Tony, Rhodey, Vision and T’Challa) are discussing the latest developments in the UN meetings they’ve been having to attend when she casually strolls into the communal living room of the facility. How she’d known where to find them, nobody asks. T’Challa gives her a warm smile, while Vision and Rhodey merely glance wearily at her. Rhodey more than the others seems a bit more hostile. Tony glances at her for a second, then looks back down at the papers in his hands. Suddenly what seems so urgent mere moments before becomes unimportant then.
So that’s exactly what he does. Puts himself together, wills the excess of himself that keeps bursting at the seams, and gets out of the bathroom. Methodically, he picks up his watch and his wallet and makes his way to the garage. FRIDAY is mournfully silent as he goes, wishes him a quiet good luck that makes him close his eyes and wish for sarcasm and a British accent, and gets into his car. Nobody drives him anymore; Happy having left along with Pepper at Tony’s request. He avoids his eyes in the rearview mirror and revs out of the Tower’s garage.
Peter crouches down at the edge of that platform where they are and leans over to look at where the alien has Strange levitating; one of the spikes has pierced his cheekbone and Tony has to resist the urge to just drop down and yank it off. It looks painful, and the man might be the only person who could get his child back home where he belongs. If they don’t do something to help him soon, they’re going to be even worse sitting ducks than they already are.
The other person turns around in her chair, she has short blond hair and is wearing a suit that reminds Tony far too much of
The quiet purr of the engine dies as Tony cuts the power.  He sits for a moment, hands clenched at either side of the steering wheel.  At three and nine.  He’d always been taught ten and two, but it never stuck.
But water was the first thing on the agenda, so he peeled the slit-eyed helm from his head, sopping hair sticking to his fingers.  He let the helmet drop to the ground and knelt on the bank.
“Right.” Tony steps away, peeling off his clothing.  Steve doesn’t avert his eyes, it’s nothing he hasn’t seen, but he’s allowed to look now, Tony supposes.  Or he allows himself to look.
“So,” Tony croaked.  “S'at lunch for me, or did you bring it up here to make me watch you eat everything as usual?”
“Cap, it’s a trap, we gotta go,” Tony murmurs urgently. Steve glances back at him, scorn in his eyes, but he doesn’t know.  He doesn’t know.
amount bad for speeding, and probably giving the officers the illusion that he was on his way to stop a criminal rather than on the way back from it. But being Iron Man did have its perks, and no one questioning your actions was one of them.
“He’s sleeping out on the couch while he waits for me to come home.  He took off all his clothes in the doctor’s office, even though he
It would work.  She would like the antecedent of the twins.  As much as he’d love to tell his mother everything, this letter was not the place to do it.  Someone would read this correspondence undoubtedly, and he could not rely on it only being Jarvis or Pepper.  Tony still wasn’t sure what exactly Steve had planned for him, but he could not very well write “train me to become an Alastor”, so it would have to pass.  He thought of writing to Pepper, Rhodey, or Peggy, but they would all undoubtedly see this, and no one would think anything different of him if they found him writing to his mother.
But Steve didn’t look troubled.  He looked . . . patient, but excited.  “I don’t think you’re crazy, Tony.  In fact, I think you’re exactly in the right place.”
Panting, Tony thanked whatever god that was watching over him that Steve seemed to be slowing down.  They had run
.  Only babies believe in monsters.”  She looked at Clint.  “Daddy, doesn’t the news say he’s a genius?”
A large-scale electrical failure had occurred.  Oddly.  It left only the most necessary of the life support systems on.  Someone had waltzed in, knocked all the guards unconscious, and had simply smashed the cell doors open.  The only remnant that anyone had even been there was the shredded remains of a straightjacket and a mangled collar.
While he’d heard stories, and had some small personal experience from after the war, Tony wasn’t at all prepared for seeing the man as . . . well, a man.  Steve was beautiful, undoubtedly.  But Tony was used to beautiful people; Steve had also smiled, and looked at him with genuine concern.  Like he might care for Tony already.
Fury looked too calm, kicking back and enjoying himself in the burned-out living room.  Tony wondered vaguely how often he did this.  It brought about the image of Fury sunbathing in a tiny lavender silk robe as he shot ninjas and drank mimosas, and he had to suppress a giggle.
“I’ve seen many wounds like that in my village.  We call them the walking dead, because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs-“
So over the course of the past few days Tony had made due with a pile of burlap under the stars.  It wasn’t so bad, really.  The skies had been remarkably clear, with calm seas and strong winds that sped them in the direction they were headed without much fuss.  That part was remarkable in of itself.  Tony had overheard the sailors saying that this was the most favorable weather they had ever seen, so the gods must be looking favorably on the Prince leaving Athens for a time.
“Well, I’d get used to it.” Tony indulged himself, letting his eyes rake over the places where his suit pulled taunt over his biceps and hips. “She didn’t look like she cared which of us took a shine to her.”
Okay, shortish update.  It'll get good next chapter, I promise . . . . *masturbation*  Who said that?
It’s wealth of information. It’s not the only one, but they are not keeping him hostage.  He is free to leave.  But Tony has always been a slave to his own impulses.  And to learn has always been the foremost one.
Usually, Steve’s voice is alert, ready for action. Ready to leap out of bed into his patriotic suit. But right now, he sounds exhausted. Words husky and muddled from sleep. Tony wants to apologize and hang up, let the man get his much-needed rest, but he’s already alerted Steve that something’s wrong. Steve would never dump the phone and go back to sleep, not when he knows Tony would never call him at 3:58 in the morning without a very good reason.
Breakfast was an uneventful but cheerful affair.  The kitchens opened up on a large kitchen yard, which was adjacent to the exercise yard.  A giant
“Don’t jinx it!” Tony called, unable to keep the grin off his face as he pulled his racing gear on. He grabbed his helmet, accepted the whoops and claps on the back from the pit crew as he approached the automobile to be strapped in.
Now he is here, Akim at the wheel as he shows Tony the most reliable, not fastest, route through the valleys. It had been a condition for his employment.
They pulled though, the fence buzzing and jangling as it closed.  They pulled in next to a lonely 1996 Jetta on the gravel yard.  Silently now, the three double-checked their equipment and exited the van, Rhodey looking longingly at his half-finished slushie.
And he was.  More than anyone, so it sometimes seems.  Steve at least understands, most of the time.
“We’re Alastors, new friend.  Welcome to the club.”  Clint jumped up on a stool, which Natasha promptly kicked over and sent him tumbling into the dirt.  Tony pointed at her.
“As a matter of fact I did.  He was one of the founding members of SHELID.  And I get the feeling you’re gonna be a much better father than him.”
to make that my slogan,” Tony said as he pulled out his phone and snapped a picture of a sign that said “I’m the Girl Who Makes the Little Gizmo That Screws Inside This Bigger Thing That Goes on Top of Something Else . . .”  He would put it on a t-shirt, and give one to everyone for Christmas.
Best to stick to lowly slave prostitutes.  Although they might be lacking in societal graces, at least there wasn’t much they could use against him.
Steve shook his head.  “You’ll regret saying that when you learn how much the others snoop.  But good.  I was worried you might not be able to take care of yourself, I’m sorry to say.”
She looked nervous, more so than he’d ever seen her.  “You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?”
Until Jane’s colleague Erik decided that the exchange of the ring was the moment to take his pants off.  (To give Clint credit, it did look like he took his off in solidarity, instead of taking advantage of the opportunity.)
Tony was fairly certain that Fury was one of those people with inroads to the gods.  He had named himself after the Kindly Ones and hadn’t been killed yet, so he at least garnered some respect.  (And with some morbid curiosity, Tony was eager to see if Fury had bargained his eye for something else from a twisted god.)  But, Tony had to keep reminding himself, he also had the blessing of the gods, the
“Well,” Tony murmured, quiet because he wanted Steve to stay close.  “You are immortal.  The muses will sing your songs forever.  The greatest heroes never die.  Not so long as the living remember them.”
“You see, Steve is the kind of guy who feels the need to take the weight of the world on his shoulders.  I think, because he doesn’t give a lot away, that he is disgusted by the way Howard has treated you.  He and Peggy keep tight correspondence, and they tell each other everything.  Howard has tried convincing him to come back to Athens to mentor you for years, but it seems Steve’s plan was to get you away from Howard and let you develop on your own.”
“Trust me.  I know.  I’m good at this stuff.  I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium.  I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.”
“Legendary women from the island’s history?  Are you actually surprised that they’re still here?”  Steve had a point.  “They stay as guardians and advise those who live here.  Downright scared the crap out of me when Naus first jumped out of the tide at me, and that was after I’d been at war for years.  They’ve kept me in check for ages.”
, over the rolling green hills and though waist-high grass and wheat.  But at last he could see the craggy cliffs bordering the turquoise sea beyond them.
Zoloto has assured him that his lungs are better than the average human’s, and he’ll be fine. And he is.
Makris was still talking.  “You must capture it, but not kill it.  He has designs that you should sacrifice it to him, tomorrow.”
“Maybe you used one too many blankets,” Tony muses as a familiar arm eases under him and pulls him into alignment with Steve’s body. He lightly ghosts the upper part of his thigh across Steve’s groin.
His fingers were black with charcoal, and occasionally he mistook it for the smoke of burned bodies.
“Yeah,” he sounded distracted, and was staring at the table. “Just not used to . . . that sort of attention. I didn’t always look like this.” He grimaced and gestured down at his musculature.
Tony wasn’t going to pretend he hadn’t imagined what kissing Steve would be like.  But this does not live up to his expectations.  Steve is not shy and uncertain; slow, yes, but filled with intent, like this man doesn’t want to let opportunities slip through his fingers.  Like he knows loss, he knows pain, and knows he’ll experience them again, so he should try for happiness where it’s available.
“You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you.  I built this for you.  And someday, you’ll realize it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions.   I represent’s my life’s work.  This is the key to the future.  I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out.  And when you do, you’ll change the world.  What is and always will be, my greatest creation, is you.”
The six of them gathered in a circle, subconsciously protecting one another’s backs as they listened to the combined shouts from the civilians and screams from the alien army.
Her soft hand swept out of her sleeve and cupped his cheek.  “No.  Thank you, my sweet.  He drunkenly sleeps with her once, she begets a child, and thinks herself better than me?”  She glared out the window.
Okay, this adamantite is not Marvel’s version of adamantium.  “Adamantite” was a general term in mythology for “really hard mystery metal” and was what some of the gods’/titans’ weapons were made of.  Keep thinking the shield behaves like it is vibranium.  In other news, I reeeeeeally hope you like ancient metallurgy.  Cause . . . you’re going to get lots of it.
, the teenager who has somehow become both a leader in several industries and a superhero in the time it takes most to get really good SAT scores.
“Tony,” Steve looked up, bleary-eyed, the impression of the whip stitch on the edge of the blanket zigzagging across his face.  He smiled, big and open and like Tony had made the world a better place by being there.  All the dirty looks he had gotten vanished, replaced by that ever-growing pull between utter contentment and desperate longing.
There were many benefits to the mental connection parents had with children.  His kids had the benefit of knowing him when he was older.  Peter and Maria would be there to help him make the decisions most important to his life; tell him what direction he was supposed to go in.  And possibly most important to Steve, help him find their mother.
He didn’t know how much time passed before he felt Steve stretch out again, without the covers smothering him.
“Uh-huh,” Steve’s voice has gone high, like he’s almost hysterical.  Tony's about to say something, he doesn't know what, when Carol screams at them.
“So, we’re sharing with the kids,” Steve ignored him.  “Laura said be careful of leaving hair in the drain or on the sink.  But I think that was targeted at you.”
Pepper strode over, put her hands on either side of his face and stared directly into his eyes.  “Are you okay?”
“Thank you,” Steve said with the slightly breathless way of someone who was in the middle of stuffing their face and had been interrupted. “You didn’t have to do that.”
The twins had been doing a lot of this sort of rambling, alternating between scientific discussions he barely understood, quite tension, and nonsensical ramblings such as these.
Theirs wasn’t a love story to be painted in oils and hung in a nice museum.  Theirs was an urban legend, whispered in blood and ashes, and remembered.
“Ay, what if it’s one ‘a them tame birds that rich peoples sometimes has?”  The group of sailors collectively turned to Tony for conformation.
It was quiet.  He could never remember this kind of quiet, stillness and comfort but still mocking.  In Athens, and every other city he’s been in, night was weighted, waiting for something to happen.  It would occasionally echo with dogs barking, slurred singing from the drunks, slaves on midnight errands, the husky calls of the prostitutes along the city walls, random screams and calls and whispers wrapping the air in a baited breath.  The air in the city was waiting for night to pass, so things could proceed with the return of light.
“You will have them, I can tell by the way you cock your head.  Go.  You will have them.  Don’t waste your life.”
Steve favored him with a relived smile.  “Tony, I want you to feel comfortable becoming the best man you can be.  Not your ideal hero.  Not the king Howard wants you to be.  Just know that this is supposed to be a safe environment for you.”  And he turned and marched down the creaky stairs.
The look on Steve’s face was purely thunderous.  “I don’t – I don’t want a royal marriage, Tony.  I want a partner, an equal.  I
Steve cocked his head for a moment, then smirked and shook himself.  “Has anyone made any proper sacrifices to the gods?” he asked, obviously not expecting an affirmative.
The scales are cool, and clack softly as Tony sifts through them. They’re carbon-based, but hard like steel.  So the family name is fitting.  Tony selects a single scale, one that would have been located on the spinal ridge.  It is large, about the size of a half-dollar and shield-shaped.  Escutcheon, not like the circular ones Steve uses.  He closes his fingers around it, and lets his eyes slide closed.  He may be imagining it, but a phantom warmth emanates from its depths and covers his palm.
The site was . . . awful.  The transmitter was situated in the middle of what was probably intended to be the site of multiple industrial buildings, but looked much like a construction yard.  The ground was unlevel like a quarry, but with cracked umber clay instead of rock.  There were piles of rough granite boulders, and bits of quartz flecks glittered from the dusty dirt road in the evening sun, shining low through the pine trees.  Stacks of rusting rebar and bleached, warped wood lined the roadways, interspaced with cracked concrete chunks and brilliantly green weeds that shot up several feet.  There were several cranes and earthmovers sitting in amidst kudzu, and a defunct biodiesel plant.  The only sign of life was a couple of trailers tethered together towards the back of the lot, were a light was shining through one of the windows.
Steve made a pitiful noise when Tony took his arm away, so Tony took the opportunity to wrap himself around Steve’s side, rubbing both hands along Steve’s arm. Trying to warm him up, or so he told himself.
It was sad, because Steve would make a great dad.  But like Bruce, there were genetic concerns, and an adoption agency wasn’t likely to approve a single guy who was constantly jetting all over the world to punch people in the face.
“Mmm-hmm,” Natasha kicked a wooden gate open, leading the way through a storage yard that seemed to wrap around the side of the house.  There were a few broken-down carriages, stacks of amphorae, crates of unknown contents.  Further down, a small hut seemed to protrude from the foundations, next to an area filled with several cots under an awning, like a field hospital.  “He likely would have been a pottery painter if he hadn’t gone off to war.  He still enjoys it, when he gets the time.”
The reason he wanted to become an artist is something a lot of people have always asked.  They always question how he came to the conclusion that a poor Irish kid should pull himself out of poverty through
“More than likely, but I’ve had to live for years with Tony saying how good him mobile service is.  Has it finally failed you, Tony?”
If you're at all confused about anything, feel free to ask.  I don't get to rant about the Greeks enough.
Panting, Tony plopped down.  Steve, still chucking to cover up the hot custard feeling that was once again filling the air.  They let Tony regain his breath throughout “Fire In the Hole”, but when a slower, smoother sound filled with maracas and snare drum started up, Tony once again leapt up, this time holding out a hand.
Thor let out a great booming laugh, filled with condescension.  “You people are so petty.  And tiny.”
“You’re not supposed to enjoy it.  This kind of food is supposed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  Basic and bland,” Bruce supplied as he fished his tea bag out of his cup with a spoon.
“I dunno,” Steve mumbled, occupying the window ledge, one foot kicked up to lie across the thrumming air conditioner.  “Tony shouldn’t go, and you’re busy.”
insisted on bottoming, he rarely plunged in two fingers before he had Tony pinned to the bed, rising up and down on Tony’s cock.  Savoring and throwing his head back, alternating between moving languidly and making sure Tony hit his prostate, and ramming himself down so fast Tony felt the bed would break.
Steve griped Tony’s jaw again, and angled him for eye contact, and oh, how he like the way Tony’s bones shifted under his fingers and his Adam’s Apple rolled along his palm.
There’s no way of being certain, but something in his gut told him that he was most certainly David.
Howard probably was worried of Tony poisoning him, or outright killing him, but Tony would never kill his father.  But not planning the death of a person didn’t mean the death wouldn’t be welcome when it came.
“Never mind. I talk crazy when I'm tired. Just get in here.” Steve laughs lightly and strips down to his boxer briefs and tee shirt and crawls in beneath the covers.
Tony reverently takes the box.  It was heavy, dense.  He slides the ribbon off the box and lifts the lid, pulls back the tissue paper to reveal a strawberry colored vase.  Cranberry glass.
. “Was a lot more dangerous than the draft that finally made it into your hands.” He doesn’t look at the Captain as he says it, but he doesn’t feel too bad about it. His eyes rest on T’Challa who stares back at him solemnly. “Not many of us saw those first… mandates, is what Ross liked to call them. There was no pretense, there, no leniency. The Raft would have been our option if we were
“Peter is a minor,” Tasha says and her voice is the same as always. Though her eyes are hard and angry and they don’t waver from Clint. It’s far more effective to pin the archer down like a bug than anything Tony could have thought up. “If you had read the original accords, then you would have known its jurisdiction didn’t extend to children unless,” she bites off when the man opens his mouth, “they decide to involve themselves in something that is far beyond them. Wanda chose her side, Clint, nobody forced her. She decided to join the team, she decided to go on missions, and she
He notices then that the whole room is looking at them, can feel their eyes on their interaction, and he feels that weird tightening on his skin. He feels itchy and hot with the attention; the sounds of the baby are too loud in the suddenly-quiet room. He avoids everyone’s eyes as he straightens his spine and throws his shoulders back. He immediately throws his safety blanket over himself; the show-boating asshole that Howard, and Stane and Ty made sure to cultivate. He hates it, always has, and there were times when he would have been able to shed that cocoon for these people.
And it’s all it takes for Tony to break down. To cry like he did that day, alone in the snow with a jagged wound on his chest. But it’s better, too, because Tony isn’t alone. Tony has his kid, and that’s all that’s enough. Peter is more than enough.
” he raises the documents to the king, “might be the only thing that has even gone right. That’s thanks to you, and Tasha, and Rhodey and even Viz. it’s gone right because of you. That’s all they need to know.” He gets to his feet, suddenly exhausted with the whole thing, and makes his way to the door.
He leans his head back against the couch again, feeling the comforting weight of Morgan on his chest and her tiny fist grasping his shirt and his son by his side, he starts dropping quickly. Peter mumbles something against him and gets closer. This, right here, is everything. The pain, the grief, the bitterness, the anger—it’s all secondary to this. Tony would move the entire universe for them.
“All of you?” and Tony hears the skepticism in the question. He sighs. “You don’t have to take it, you know? You deserve to give your side of the store. Nat says you won’t tell them what you did.”
Though the glass is reinforced, and he knows it, Steve can still hear Tony’s voice. Sometimes the goddamn curse coursing through his veins is actually helpful. He stands there, wide eyed, as Tony shakes his head sharply and makes a rolling motion with his hand. He’s wearing some kind of glasses that wrap around his head and light up with a faint blue light. “Roll it again.”
“You said during it a mission, with a group of people who can swear in five different languages in between them, and you expect us to let it go?” Rhodey snorts.
He had surprised himself by asking for her number, and for a few weeks he had convinced himself that it was what he wanted. She was loving and sweet, and she made him feel a little less out of breath. They could go on movie dates, and she wouldn’t make comments that would make Steve snort inappropriately or get them kicked out. They could go out to dinner and not drop a pretty penny on dessert. She never called him in the middle of the night for a walk or a picnic or a trip to the other side of the city. He could say he didn’t want to talk about something and she would give him his space.
,” he gestures to Tony and wow he must really look like shit if the kid doesn’t even need to use words to express himself. “when they’re taking and using your stuff. Did they even give you a choice in this? Peter said Rhodey told him you were all having a meeting, thanks for not telling me they’re back by the way, but he never said if you even wanted to and let me tell you, that would be a pretty shi—“
,” Tony almost growls at them. Peter ducks his head and scuffs at the floor with the point of his shoe. The mechanic makes sure his brother is steady on his feet before he moves towards his spider. He can feel his hands shaking, and he balls them into fists lest he show any of these people his weaknesses. “C’mon, Pete, you have nothing to do here.”
tell me though he’s tried, then it’s something that is eating at him. And that tells me enough. It wasn’t all your fault. We were your team, and we failed you. We should have trusted you more than we did. We turned our backs on you, and that’s on us.”
“Look, Tony, I think we both knew this might not work. We both knew from the start that—that we were too different. I’m leaving at the end of the next year, and you’re going to send me god knows where. I just—I don’t think we should be wasting—“The way Tony rears back at his choice of words immediately makes Steve feel like the worst human being on Earth. He wants to kick himself the moment the words are out, but Tony beats him to it. He takes a step back, then another, tear after tear falling silently down his cheeks.
. The cold might be seeping into his bones, and every breath might be a challenge, but his time is up. It was time to go.
“I didn’t deserve what she did, either,” Stark said, quietly. Clint would have argued, but the fact that Tony didn’t say it to be contradictory stopped him. The other man sounded like he
“It’s this poem I’ve been thinking about. I know, poetry isn’t really our thing. Guys like us are supposed to like science, but—”
But before Steve can finish the thought, there is a shrill ring that seems to echo in their confined space. His eyes widen as he pulls it out of his pocket, hands trembling, and gingerly holds it in his hands. He suddenly feels like it’s 1936 again and he’s trying to run away from a pack of boys who’d taken an issue to his mouth. He feels as though the air isn’t making the whole trip it should be taking into his lungs.
“I’m not Bucky,” Tony said, and Steve reared back. The mechanic tilted his head to the side, mind running a mile a minute as he focused on the other man. “I think I see it now.”
“Shhh, no. No. I’m not telling you this to make you feel bad, honey. I’m just—I just want you to know, Peter, that you don’t have to be strong. Not for us. Not when it’s hurting you this much. I know, baby, I know how much you miss patrolling. I know how much you miss going to Queens to see Nerd—”
in his eyes had Steve nodding quickly. He probably looked like a bobble headed door if the baby’s laughter was any indication, but god he was just so grateful.
“Do you promise?” Steve says, sounding like the little runt who stood up to Bobby Westminster in the alley behind the butcher’s for bugging Lil’ Ricky.
hadn’t garnered even a smile. On the third day, they didn’t appear. On the fourth, Cooper hadn’t walked into the kitchen either, and Laura had been banging cupboard doors. On the fifth, Clint made himself scarce and the kids all sat down for dinner. On the seventh, the hostility had transferred to Steve and he tried his best not to take it personal.
“The last time I tried to help, the last time I tried to keep her safe, you all called Clint to bomb this place and attack Vision. I tried my best, because I knew what they wanted to do to her, but none of you would listen. And now you’re asking me to, what? Go out there and put my face for her? You want me to keep the UN and the media off her back? Are you kidding me, Steve?” His voice broke on the blond’s name, and he felt like dirt. God, how did he keep messing up this bad?
settle on his shoulders. It’s lighter and warmer than the weight he’s carried since he held Erskine in his arms.
, that exactly like Steve she hasn’t told the others anything about what happened in Sokovia. He doesn’t mean when Ultron attacked, but way before then. He feels the words about to burst from his lips, the accusations and the hate and bereavement for not only her but the whole lot of them, and has to bite his tongue so hard he finally tastes blood.
, and then moves on to his engagement. Apparently, Sunset Bain had been a family friend. Steve turns the name over and over in his brain but he can’t remember ever having Tony mention her to him. They had started talking again after some sort of deal between their companies, and then had started dating. The website calls them the
Steve heaved off his chair, already having a plan in mind, and began to make his way out of the room. When he was at the door, Natasha called him back. Her voice had a warning in it. “Leave him be, Steve,” was all she said, but the soldier didn’t have to ask who she meant. He shook her head and moved out of the room.
“We have compelling evidence, now. We have enough to make the case moot, and the Stark Foundation is getting more donors. Plus, the information that Bruce had saved for me was damning enough. That had nothing to do with me.”
Tony closes his eyes, trying his best to force himself to force himself away from the blond, but then Steve’s thumb brushes against his lower lip. The sense of
But one look at the solider takes the wind right out of him. There’s desperation replacing the determination he’d had.
