Tony kept his arms crossed, but he relaxed. Jarvis, as usual, was right. Tony was popular at school and he loved his friends, but he was lonely. It was hard during breaks or award ceremonies, when he knew his peers had support he just… didn’t. If Steve Rogers felt half of what Tony did, then Tony knew he couldn’t say no to helping him out.
The next day, Steve was waiting for Tony when he got home from class. “So can you explain artificial intelligence to me?” he asked.
Tony stared at Steve. He knew they were dancing around this, but he wasn’t going to be the one to confront it head on. “Well, do you?”
“I don’t want that. I don’t want you to have to follow me around and explain everything to me. I don’t want to feel lost.”
Steve ran a finger down Tony’s arm. “Of course I want to be with you. But I’m part of the reason they wrote that article about you. And all of that is only going to get worse.”
Steve didn’t turn the light on, and neither did Tony. Steve began to unbutton his shirt, and Tony leaned against the door, staring at him. God, he looked good in the moonlight. He looked good in blue. Tony could still feel every part of his body that came in contact with Steve’s tingling. He wanted more. And why shouldn’t he get it? There were now two Moments. Two was a significant number.
“Newsflash, Cap, I had a life before you got here. And my life consisted of three things: sulking, drinking, and going home with random guys.”
“Anyway, you’re one to talk. You’ve been ogling Steve Rogers ever since Nick Fury pulled him out of the ocean.”
“Not at all,” Steve said. “I mean, I guess it is a drag, but talking about it beats sitting alone in a hotel room and not talking to anyone.”
They didn’t speak for the rest of the ride. Nat dropped them off first, and they untangled themselves and trudged into the dorm room.
Tony didn’t think about it. He squeezed his eyes shut and lunged at Steve. He knew he wasn’t graceful, but he didn’t care. He wanted to kiss Steve, to touch him, to -
VERY sorry for a huge delay in posting. Finals were nuts. I'll be posting more regularly from now on!
Tony spent the rest of the week cleaning his room (which was not easy- he had to enlist the help of his friend Bruce more than once) and watching the coverage of Captain America that had dominated the news since Nick Fury announced finding him. Steve Rogers (probably under Nick’s direction) hadn’t given any statements or interviews, but every news channel was camped out outside of the New York hotel where Steve was staying, and they ran footage of him walking into and out of the building from morning till night.
“We’re getting ahead of ourselves here,” Tony said, and he queued up a video of Be My Baby by The Ronnettes.
It was tougher because Steve’s idea of just being friends was a little warped. During the day, everything was the same as it normally was. They went to class and came home and Steve asked questions about scrunchies or vending machines or whatever new thing he had noticed. They did homework and ate dinner. But then night came, and almost every night Steve would turn the lights off while Tony loaded a movie, and then they would curl up under a blanket and cuddle or hold hands. They usually didn’t talk during the movie – that would require them to acknowledge what they were doing. But Tony still cherished every night that he got to pretend he and Steve were anything more than friends. A few times, especially during midterms, he fell asleep on Steve’s chest and woke up in the same position, Steve snoring softly with his arm still around Tony’s shoulders.
Steve and Tony didn’t talk about the spat at McCool’s. It felt like they didn’t really need to. Tony became more comfortable with what he and Steve had. And anyway, something really was better than nothing. They spent the week the way they normally did, with no major issues.
He shook hands with Tony and Steve and left with Jarvis. Suddenly, Tony was alone. With Captain America. Who was still staring out the window.
Tony’s heart started beating fast. “I’m sure you could. I’m sure that this person would want you to.”
“Hey,” Tony said, sitting on his bed. “Let’s get to know each other. This is a small room for strangers to share. Tell me about Steve Rogers. Likes, dislikes, embarrassing anecdotes.”
He shuddered at the feeling of running his tongue against Steve’s. Steve pushed Tony so that he was laying on the bed and Steve was on top of him, his legs straddling Tony’s waist.
Tony Stark really did not like using his family name to his benefit. Sure, being the only son of an insanely wealthy family did have its benefits, but he hated people thinking his grades, his place at MIT, and the awards he’d gotten from the electrical engineering and physics departments were gifted to him because his dad was Howard Stark or because, since his parents died, he was the heir apparent to Stark Industries. He wanted people to think – to
Tony got off the stool and stumbled over to the booth where Nat, Bruce, and Steve were sitting with two other kids from school. Somehow, everyone had rearranged themselves so Steve was sitting on the outside of the booth, still staring at Tony.
Tony let go of Steve’s hand to lean into him. They cuddled under the blanket for about an hour before Tony fell asleep in Steve’s arms, lulled into dreams by the rise and fall of his chest.
“Oh, right, when the great Captain America speaks, everyone listens. Everyone does what Captain America wants, so why should I be any different?”
The next Friday, as Tony trudged home from class, he got a call from a restricted number. He answered it on the off chance it was Nick.
“Wow, Tony. Congratulations,” Steve said. He pulled Tony into a hug. Tony was shocked – they hadn’t had any physical contact since he tried to kiss Steve – but after a second, he melted against Steve’s chest and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist. It felt good, warm,
That’s all it took for Tony to grudgingly agree to go out with Steve and Natasha. He texted Bruce, who immediately said yes at the mention of Natasha’s name. And all of a sudden, he was getting ready in the bedroom while Steve changed in the communal bathroom, which he had been doing since The Moment.
He and Mark talked for a while. Mark kept ordering vodka sodas and Tony kept drinking them. He ignored the fact that every time he looked back at the table, Steve was watching him.
The rest of the awards ceremony was uneventful. They called all the names and gave all the plaques out. When Tony’s name was called, Steve clapped harder than anyone.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony answered, not sure what to say. Had he just dreamed up what happened? Had he misinterpreted?
Steve was at the gym. Tony was, thankfully, alone. Us Weekly had never published anything especially egregious about him before, but it was always stressful to see whatever pictures they found.
The group of six walked to the car. Tony was drunk and mad, but he didn’t miss that Bruce took Nat’s hand.
“Uh, no,” Tony said, intrigued. “My friends are in that booth. I’m waiting for some food.” Tony turned and pointed to the booth. Nat and Bruce were now sitting in the same booth, chatting away. And Steve was sipping on his beer and… watching him. He smiled when Tony looked at him. Tony flashed a quick smile back and turned back toward the hot stranger.
Steve grabbed Tony by the shoulders. Tony opened his eyes. Steve was leaning away from him, his brow furrowed. “We’re not… we can’t,” Steve said.
They got drinks and sat down to eat dinner. They ate with engineering department faculty, all of whom were very interested in Captain America. Steve was more animated than Tony had ever seen him in public, telling stories and laughing with the faculty and thanking them for their kind words. He bragged about Tony and thanked them for giving him the award. More than once, Steve rested his hand on Tony’s knee. Steve didn’t look at him when he did it, didn’t make a big deal or stop talking. It felt so natural. Tony loved not having to talk to his professors because he had someone else who would. He loved having someone to brag about him, to touch his leg to let him know someone was thinking about him.
Steve laughed, but he climbed off of Tony’s lap. He laid down on the bed and motioned for Tony to lay next to him.
Tony and Steve didn’t talk any more about their feelings for a while. As far as Tony was concerned, Steve had said everything he needed to. It wasn’t going to happen. And as much as Tony tried to shrug it off, he was hurt. Admitting his feelings for Steve forced him to confront how much he actually liked him, how badly he wanted to be with him. For a while, Tony had just thought that Steve was hot or would have been a good hookup. And even after his feelings changed, it was really easy to convince himself it was all physical. But now Tony had to deal with the fact that it wasn’t. Steve cared about him. He was funny and warm and smart and eager. Steve made the world – Tony’s world – better and brighter. And letting go of him was really tough.
Steve smiled and pulled Tony close to him. “Not tonight," he whispered, nuzzling his nose into Tony's neck. "Let’s just stay here for a while.”
Before the dean got started with the awards, he said, “We have an unexpected and special guest here tonight. I’d like everyone to give a round of applause to welcome Captain America, Steve Rogers, to MIT.”
“This is really good,” Steve said, sipping his beer and watching the video. “All of it. Computers, videos, music, this beer, it’s all so new and wonderful. I’m glad I get to be here to see all of this.”
“Okay, I wasn’t listening,” Tony confessed. “But if I have to guess, I’d assume you were complaining about your nonexistent love life?”
Bruce met them at their dorm, Tony introduced Steve and Bruce, and a few minutes later Natasha drove up to their building in a car that was suspiciously nice for a college student that wasn’t… well, that wasn’t Tony.
“I just think it’s important to support you by being interested in what you do. Plus, now I know everything about computers, which is pretty good for a guy born in 1918,” Steve replied, not looking at Tony. He was too busy looking down at his tie, which was giving him a lot of trouble.
“Can I help you?” Tony asked, annoyed. This kid had never talked to him before. He knew what was coming.
“God, it’s cramped back here,” Tony commented, getting into the back seat with Bruce. Sports cars with back seats were so unnecessary.
They sat on Steve’s bed to eat pizza, drink beer, and watch music videos from the last sixty years on Youtube.
School was getting easier for Steve, and he was more comfortable being seen. Nat had shown him the gym, so he’d started working out. Tony wasn’t sure whether he and Nat were working out together, and he was afraid to ask. Instead, when Steve was at the gym, Tony would hang out with Bruce, who was also trying to avoid the idea of Steve and Nat together. She and Bruce had hooked up a few times since that night at McCool’s, but she was avoiding talking about anything more serious, which was leaving Bruce in agony.
And those eyes. Tony thought his week of staring at pictures would properly prepare him, but he had not been ready for the piercing, perfect blue eyes that were looking at him right now. He bet those were the kind of eyes that changed color with the weather or got darker when Steve was really –
“He didn’t need to. He talks about you all the time, and when he’s not talking about you he’s asking me to explain things that would obviously impress you. He’s obviously got it bad.”
“I am. And,” Tony opened his mini fridge to reveal bottles of whiskey and cans of beer, “I can still try for those embarrassing anecdotes.”
Because there were too many people in the car, Natasha didn’t speed home. Tony barely breathed the whole way back to campus. He kept his hands in his lap and tried to keep his body stiff to avoid as much contact as possible. Even so, he still felt the heat of Steve’s body radiating against his own. When Nat turned too hard down a side street, Steve gripped Tony’s wait to steady him and Tony bit his lip to avoid gasping. About halfway back, his back started to hurt from his posture. He decided that he could just blame his drunkenness for anything he did that was out of line, and he leaned back against Steve’s chest. Steve wrapped his arm a little tighter around Tony’s waist. He could feel the muscles in Steve’s arm, could feel his chest rise and fall with his breath. He wanted to slide his hand against Steve’s leg, but he didn’t. There were other people in the car, after all. Instead, he looked at Steve, who smiled.
“You got a thing for my abs,” Steve grumbled – but he complied and lay on his side on the mat, drawing Tony into his arms.  “How do you want me, doll?”
“Can we – ” Steve gasped as Tony rubbed his thumb over the head of his cock, “Fuck, that feels good.  Can we not talk about your robotic children right now?”
Steve sat up, changing the angle and lighting up new pleasure for Tony.  The supersoldier rolled his hips, his cock bobbing obscenely.  Tony reached for it, but Steve batted his hand away.  “Want to come just like this,” he moaned.
“Yes, sir.”  Steve pressed a kiss to the center of the arc reactor, making Tony’s breath hitch again.  “This keeps you safe for me,” he murmured.  “Sure, it lets you run the suit and that’s amazing but – that isn’t what I adore about it, doll – it keeps you alive.”  Steve stroked his fingertips along the scars.
Tony’s hand came up around the back of his neck.  “If I’d known speaking Italian got you that hot, baby, I’d have done it weeks ago.”  He didn’t struggle when Steve hoisted his thighs up, just wrapped his legs around the supersoldier.  “Didn’t know you had a language kink.”
Tony chuckled and strutted towards the bathroom.  “Mine may be pretty, but yours is a national treasure.”
“I don’t hold with people talkin’ bad about my partner,” Steve shot back in the same tone.  “So mind your tongue.”
Tony hummed.  “I’ve got you, so… I’ve got my world.”  He twisted in Steve’s lap, moving to straddle the supersoldier.
Tony brought his hand down in a playful slap.  Steve’s back went rigid and he moaned.  “Oh, we like that, do we?”  Tony thrust again, feeling Steve trembling.  “Still good here, Cap?”
“Please.”  It was rare that Tony outright begged, and it never failed to ratchet Steve to the next level.  “Please, Steve – I need – ”  Tony gasped and met his eyes.  “Make love to me.”
Tony's eyes burned but he refused to acknowledge it.  He fisted his hands on the ground to prevent him from reaching for Steve, but it didn't matter.  Steve was pressing into him again, covering him with that star-spangled body.
“I know.”  Tony sighed and turned to face Steve.  He took the tie out of his unresisting hand and slung it around Steve’s neck.  “I can’t help but think of how unlike the team’s reaction everyone else’s will be.”
“I just have one question,” Natasha continued blithely.  “You have to settle this for us, because there’s money riding on it.  Who caved first?  And when?”
“I know it’ll hurt you when I say this but – I’ve never loved anyone like this before, Pep.”  Tony looked down at his hands.  “I didn’t know… I didn’t realize it was possible.”
“Can’t deny I like the good stuff.”  Tony lapped up the last of Steve’s come, kneeling over Steve.  “I can’t decide how best to punish you for that egregious coffee sin.  I don’t think I can match your stamina to count strokes.”  He reached out one long, callused finger and ran it along Steve’s cock, feeling it twitch.
Steve scooped Tony up into his arms.  “The real thing,” he agreed.  “Long haul.  Forever and a day.”  He carried Tony towards the bedroom.  “And right now, I want to make love to my partner – because this time I don’t have to pretend I’m okay with just fucking you.”
“Wasn’t planning on it.”  Steve pulled back, smiling, and tugged Tony into the theater.  “Let’s see a show, love… now that we’re done giving one.”
“The army did train me in tactics, love.”  Steve kissed Tony’s cheek.  “The team knows when we shifted from friends to partners, but they also know we were intimate a lot longer than that… and if it didn’t impact our working relationship then, I don’t think it will now.  It’s not easy to balance command and love, but I’ve done it before… and I’ll do it again.”
“As long as you’re happy, I’m happy.”  Rhodey yawned.  “Go be happy so I can get some rest.  Night, martini.”
“What do you need, sweetheart?” Tony murmured, shifting his kisses to Steve’s neck, the better to whisper in his ear.
Steve laughed and rolled onto his side next to Tony.  “Sorry.  I didn’t mean to push too much.  I should have known better than to throw gratitude and love into one comment.”
“But it’s a lot.”  Steve hugged him, tucking Tony’s head into his shoulder.  “I didn’t plan it to happen that way either.”
"God, yes."  Tony unhooked his legs from Steve's waist so the he could work at Steve's belt, which he flung towards the gloves.  His hands were frantic.  "Need you to fuck me, Steve."
“You’re still my best friend, Tony,” Steve assured him softly.  “And we’ll keep it from changing how we work in the field.”  He kissed the back of Tony’s neck.  “There’s… there’s a couple names that it would be… that I’d rather you not use.”
“Do you want to talk about it?”  Tony shifted off him, twisting on the bed until he was kneeling beside Steve at his hip, able to reach out and stroke Steve’s chest – which he did.
Overwhelmed with emotion, Steve returned the kiss.  His hips stuttered, rhythm interrupted as he tried to show Tony with his lips how deeply those words affected him – how desperately he loved this madman, this visionary builder that had given him a home and a future and something to wake up for.
Tony ran a finger through the come on Steve’s stomach.  “Don’t apologize.”  He lifted it to his mouth and sucked his finger clean.  “I know what your refractory period is, we’re fine.”  He shoved at Steve, who obediently lay down on the bed.  “What’s got you so wired, Cap?”
Steve propped himself up on one arm to free the other, stroking Tony’s cheek lightly.  But no tenderness could stall their lust for long – not that Steve would want it to.  He pulled out almost entirely before thrusting in again, feeling Tony rock on the mattress beneath him.  “Say it again.”  He tried to command it, but his words were more of a plea.
“No, she didn’t.”  Steve’s arm tightened around him.  “You let it drop, and I didn’t push – but she didn’t apologize.”
That desperate whine was enough for the supersoldier to lose control.  With one long moan he buried himself to the hilt in Tony, feeling his cock spurt as he spilled into his lover.  He reached for Tony’s cock but his touch wasn’t necessary – the friction between their torsos had been enough, and Tony came with a loud cry seconds after Steve had.
“What?”  Startled, Tony slid forward until their knees touched.  “Why would you – no, Steve.  Jesus, is that why you looked like I was dragging you to the pyre?”
Sighing, Tony tugged Steve’s head down to rest against his again.  “I don’t think it ever will, sweetheart.  It hasn’t for me.  I was fifteen the first time a magazine article described me as having ‘bedroom eyes.’  They’ve covered my sexual exploits – in detail, sometimes in high definition – for almost that long.  And what we deal with?  That’s nothing compared to what they say about Nat.”
Tony’s eyebrows winged up, but he didn’t object.  “Alright.  Forbidden nicknames are rule number four, got it.”  He reached back to pat Steve comfortingly.  “I really hate that b-word for what we’re… I hate it.  You’re not a boy and neither am I, and it sounds so juvenile and – ”
Steve found the bottle of lube that Tony had dropped on the blanket and coated his fingers before easing one gently into Tony.  “Gonna make you feel good,” Steve promised, mouthing at Tony’s balls.
Captain America might not pout, but Steve Rogers was doing a hell of a job of it anyway.  “I don’t like it.”
“Very funny.”  Steve rolled his eyes and got back on the bed, straddling Tony’s knees.  It might not be the easiest position to do this in, but it would be hot.  “You just gonna lie there?”
“Oh my God, it’s real.”  She looked at them in shock.  Tony didn’t let people touch the reactor.  He’d been near death the only times she’d been allowed that kind of liberty.
“Fury.”  And that single word explanation was enough to make Tony nod in sympathetic understanding.  “He… wanted to know how I manage you.  What my secret is.”  He bit off the words, feeling the simmering anger rise again.
Obligingly, Steve shifted position until Tony could curl his fingers up into Steve’s hole – infinitely more satisfying than doing it to himself.  Steve dropped his head, leaning into Tony’s touch.  “Thought you were – oh God, right there – thought you were tired.”
Steve’s eyes darkened.  “Yeah.  I could do that.”  He leaned over and kissed Tony hard.  “Does your plan allow me to blow you?”
Tony’s legs didn’t want to hold him – but Steve knew better than to just scoop him up again.  Instead, he raised his voice to the other four.  “Let’s adjourn to the den.  I think training has been cancelled for now.”
He moved on to the next item on his agenda, a thorough exploration of Steve’s pecs and nipples with his tongue.  At some points, Steve would be so sensitive that the bare touch of tongue or teeth on a nipple could send him headlong into orgasm.  That didn’t seem to be the case tonight – or maybe Tony was just being gentler.  He laved each nipple with careful passes of his tongue, pausing to lightly suckle at each nipple.  Steve moaned and one hand came up to cup Tony’s head – a hand that was quickly pulled away.  “It’s okay, baby.  You can touch,” Tony assured him before returning to Steve’s nipple.
Steve sucked in a breath like he’d been hit in the gut.  “No.”  He shook his head.  “Damn it, Tony.”
“God, I love you.”  Steve leaned forward and kissed Tony deeply.  He hadn’t asked Tony to stop drinking – not even to cut down.  That he would do it unprompted made Steve warm all over.
“I’m sure.”  Steve held out his hand and, when Tony slid his into it, pulled the engineer into a tight hug.  “I’m so sorry, love, I didn’t even think about it.”  Tony burrowed close, hiding his face against Steve’s neck.  “God, I’m so sorry.”  Steve glanced around for somewhere to sit down – only then remembering that they weren’t alone.  Well.  He’d wanted openness.  He just hadn’t counted on it coming at the end of an anxiety attack.
“Fucking troll,” Tony sighed again, but with remarkable affection.  The hand in Steve’s hair combed through the strands and he was fighting a smile.
“I love you, too,” Steve whispered back, gazing down at him.  Neither spoke or moved for a moment, just soaking in each other.  Steve broke first, closing his eyes and leaning in for a kiss.  It started gentle, tender – but a moment later it transmuted to something hot and impatient.  “Clothes, off,” Steve panted.  “Hell, you turn me on like nothin’ else, babydoll.”  Steve sat up, tugging impatiently at his shirt.
“I – are you sure?” Tony asked in a voice so desperate it made Steve want to cry – or go back in time and kill Howard Stark.
“Technically, neither of us is gay,” Steve interrupted again.  He wasn’t about to let her run rough-shod over Tony… or him.  “I’m not sure how Tony prefers to identify, but I’m pansexual.  Although for the foreseeable future, I’m Tonysexual.”
Thor chuckled.  “A friendly wager, Steve – but one which we should like to cash out.  There has been a declaration of feelings, yes?  Who spoke first?”
Steve tried to talk Tony into sleeping, but gave up when he realized the engineer was nearly vibrating with distress.  He sat up again, pulling Tony into his arms.  “Is Miss Potts still calling, JARVIS?” Steve asked softly.
Steve shifted, sinking down to his knees between Tony’s knees, the better to put them at eye level.  “What do you want tonight, babydoll?” Steve asked in a low voice.  He cupped a hand around Tony’s cheek, leaning in to kiss him.
Tony did – and the clutch of his body around Steve tumbled him over the edge as well.  They clung together through the aftershocks, trading kisses as their heartrates evened out.  Steve was careful not to put too much weight on Tony’s chest, but he made no move to get off entirely – Tony had him wrapped up firmly.
“Apparently, yes.  Come on.”  He tugged Steve towards the elevator and directed JARVIS to the penthouse.  “This way, you know I’m not going to bail… it’s my room.”  Tony tugged at Steve until he sank down on the insanely comfortable couch, still scowling.  “Okay.”  Tony sat down on the coffee table across from him and reached for his hands.  Steve gave them willingly, caressing Tony’s knuckles with his thumbs.  “Where do you want to start?”
The debrief was over, and nobody’d said anything they’d need to be court-martialed for.  Steve considered that a victory… especially considering how often he’d had to snap his own mouth shut upon a comment from Director Fury.
Well, hell.  If that’s what he wanted… Steve managed a few more thrusts, feeling Tony quivering around him, purposely tightening, before he was coming hard.  Lights burst behind his eyes and he was vaguely aware that he was making noise as he thrust through his orgasm, his whole body trembling with the force of it.
“This was all for you, sugar,” Tony said softly.  “I’m really not in the game.  Happens sometimes when I’m stressed – or have had an anxiety attack.”
“Rule three, doll,” Steve said, edging closer to him.  “This is team work, field work.  You didn’t hit your partner, you hit your captain.  Or your mouthy best friend who was definitely egging you on.  You’re not an abuser, sweetheart, I promise.”
He tried to answer – really – but the words were stolen from Tony when Steve added a third finger, twisting it just right.  Tony cried out, his hips lifting without his permission.  “Please – ” he managed to choke out.
Tony hummed impatiently, wandering around the room touching things.  Steve’s shield.  A pile of random tools culled from pockets when he’d undressed.  A framed sketch of himself with the bots that Steve had drawn.  “In case I forget to say it later… um.  Thanks.  For coming with me.”
A slow smile was spreading on Tony’s face.  “Oh, no.”  Steve’s cock twitched at the tone.  That low purr usually meant something incredible.  “I think we’ll swing the pendulum to the other extreme.  How many pots of coffee did you drink in my shop, Cap?”
In answer, Steve rolled over, careful not to dislodge Tony from the bed.  And though he supposed it wasn’t proper massage procedure, Steve couldn’t help but draw Tony into his arms.  The smaller man fit so nicely there – pressed together from knees to chin, their lips meeting in slow, sweet kisses.  Steve felt almost intoxicated – he vaguely remembered the feeling, although he hadn’t been able to get drunk since Rebirth.
At first, they only had sex when the both of them had been in the field together – usually amidst dirt and debris, filthy and fucking delicious.
Any thought Steve had been entertaining of ditching the event evaporated at the plaintive note in Tony’s voice.  Glad he was out of sight in his closet, he covered his face with his hands briefly.  Damn everyone who’d ever given Tony reason to doubt himself, because it was fucking heartbreaking that he was so unsure about Steve.  “Of course I’m going, love.  I told you I would.”  It had just been easier when he thought this was a command performance as Captain America.
Seven wounded SHIELD agents and one that wouldn’t be going home – that meant that, left to his own devices, Steve wouldn’t leave the gym for at least eight hours.  Tony doubted that Steve realized he could be counted on to put in an hour for each casualty, but it was true – and JARVIS would corroborate it.
By the time he returned to the Tower, he was a mess of anger and grief, and the last thing he wanted to deal with was Captain Steve Rogers.
Tony hadn’t realized his eyes were closed until they flew open, looking at Steve in startlement.  “You know my song?”
“Thor beams at us like we’re precocious puppies… Clint’s started singing ridiculous songs whenever we enter a room.”  Tony shook his head, chuckling.
“You’ll get more, baby, I promise.”  Tony kissed one ass cheek, resting there briefly while he worked that single finger in to the second knuckle.  “You know it’s good when I go slow.  Be patient.”
Steve laughed, kissing Tony lightly.  “I didn’t say it to derail the conversation, babydoll.”  He saw a flicker in Tony’s eyes and shook his head, still smiling.  “I still mean it.  Just didn’t intend to have you throw Pepper out.”
“Maybe.”  Tony wouldn’t argue that point – he’d never win.  Steve would and had take responsibility for the fate of the world.  “But that doesn’t change the fact that you’re still human.”  Tony gently kissed down the underside of Steve’s jaw, lightly tugging at his hair to better expose the neck.  “It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.  That is not weakness.  That is life.”
Laughing, Steve shifted behind Tony and lined himself up, pressing slowly in.  Even with all the prep, it was tight.  God, Tony was always so tight and Steve didn't understand how it was possible.  "Christ."
Tony pursed his lips.  “Hate to break it to you, Cap – it isn’t just the women.”  Naked now, he closed the small distance between them and put both hands on Steve’s pecs.  Steve shivered just from that little touch, and Tony smiled.  So, it was going to be one of those?  He loved the times that Steve was so sensitive.  He dipped his head and extended his tongue, lightly touching Steve’s left nipple.
"Good."  Tony let the suit envelop him.  "Climb on."  Steve clambered up again.  "Let's just hope we don't interrupt anyone else's... disciplinary action."
“I was trying to stay tender,” Tony said ruefully when he could breathe again.  “You kind of derailed that plan.”  He leaned down to kiss Steve.
“I’d really rather not,” Steve laughed.  He slid his hands to the waistband of Tony’s pants, gently teasing.  “But if you’re very good…” he let his voice drop to the low register that he knew drove Tony slightly insane, “I’ll fuck something else.”
Steve laughed and slipped under the covers, helping Tony wriggle into them as well.  “JARVIS, give us something to watch.”
Tony gasped at the combined pleasure of Steve inside him and the pressure on his cock – and it only took a few strokes of Steve’s hand for him to oblige and spill between them, gasping and rocking helplessly against Steve.
Steve grinned.  “Can do.”  He kissed down Tony’s chest, his hands stroking as he went.  He spent some time on the lovely defined abs – how people ever thought Tony didn’t keep in shape to pilot the suit, Steve would never know – and finally arrived at his target.  Like any good soldier, he did recon first – mapping Tony’s cock with his fingers before placing a kiss right at the tip, and then swallowing him down.
Steve slid a hand around Tony’s neck and held him close, guiding the kiss with the pressure of his fingertips.  “I can do that,” he murmured when their lips parted, leaning his forehead against Tony’s.  “I will happily administer as many kisses as you want, love.”
Laughing, Tony swatted at his hands.  “Let’s at least get to the penthouse first, baby.  I don’t want to give the team a free show.”
Tony rose from the coffee table and crossed to him in two long strides, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist.  “Jesus, that is so not what I thought was going on.”  He buried his head in the crook of Steve’s neck, breathing hard.  “God, I thought you were done with me.  Cutting ties for good.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”  Tony rose, needing to do something with his hands.  He opted for making a cup of tea – not the bagged kind, but the formal tea that Bruce had taught him.  The ritual movements were soothing.
Once they were in the elevator, all bets were off.  Steve immediately tugged Tony’s shirt out of his waistband, sliding his hands up underneath it to stroke the warm skin of his back.  “This suit looks incredible,” the supersoldier murmured against Tony’s neck, “but I want you out of it.  Right now.”
“Mixing up your autonomic responses, eh?  Flight, fight, or fuck – two out of three ain’t bad.”  Tony’s hands drifted to Steve’s ass, happily taking a double handful and pulling their hips snug together.
Steve nodded pliantly, letting Tony tug him in through the living room and to his penthouse bedroom.  Steve had never been in it – somehow, that seemed important.
Steve ground his hips into Tony, forcing himself just a little deeper.  "That one's for calling Clint 'hawkass'."  He pressed a kiss to the back of Tony's neck and followed it up with a sharp nip.  Every third thrust, Steve would list another of Tony's breaches of protocol -- but his voice was getting strangled by thrust twenty-one, and wrecked by twenty-seven.  "You're too damned good, Tony."
“Clever, tricky fingers – I’d watch you in the shop with the bots, working on arrows for Clint or Widow’s Bites for Nat and just…”  Steve’s head banged against the tile as he let out a low groan.  “Yes – right there.”
“Neither did I.”  Steve nibbled another mark into Tony’s neck.  “Feel how hard I am for you, doll?”  Steve rocked his hips against Tony, letting his cock rub against the inside of Tony’s thighs.  “God, what you do to me.”
“God, you never fucking listen!” Tony shouted, slamming the door shut behind him.  As soon as the door closed, he ordered the Iron Man suit to disengage.  He didn’t like arguing with Steve in it – well, he didn’t particularly enjoy arguing with Steve at all, but it was easier without adding ballistic armament to the discussion.
“Don’t sass me, mister, you’re still in a lot of trouble.”  But all the harshness was gone from her tone, and she was watching him with something closer to exasperated affection.  Steve was familiar with the emotion – Tony seemed to inspire it in people.  “We’ve got to write up a statement, try and counter some of the worst claims.  Half the news outlets are running headlines about you corrupting Captain America – ”
Tony returned with the bottle and dropped it onto the bed next to Steve.  “I’m guessing you’d like to face me, yeah?”  Steve nodded.  “Alright.  Lift your leg up… there you go.”  Tony’s hands were gentle as he guided Steve’s legs open, slicking up his fingers and starting, very slowly, to prep Steve.  “You’re so beautiful like this,” Tony murmured as Steve relaxed into his touch.  “All spread out for me, practically begging to be touched.”
They didn’t do that often – well, okay, Tony was in complete denial over how often they had sex at all, he definitely wasn’t prepared to run the numbers on the topping ratio.  But from what he was willing to admit to himself, Steve topped more often than not.  Maybe that ratio needed to slip closer to equal, based on Steve’s reaction to just two spit-soaked fingers.
Steve nodded his head against Tony’s shoulder.  “Yeah.”  He wasn’t actually sure – that depended a lot on whether Tony took what he’d said seriously – because for all it had been in the heat of the moment, Steve had meant every word.  He couldn’t face the idea of losing Tony.
“Hell, that’s hot,” Tony whispered, gazing up at his lover with wide eyes.  “Alright, sweetheart… you just take what you need, then.”
The engineer froze. “I… I wondered how long it would take.”  Tony’s throat wanted to close up, but he forced himself to keep talking.  “Everybody gets to that point with me, sooner or later.  I’d hoped…”  He trailed off, looking at Steve’s broad back.  The supersoldier was looking out over the city, his posture tense.  “I shouldn’t be surprised,” Tony continued dully.
“No, I don’t think it does.”  Steve turned off the water and slid into the tub, holding his arms out to invite Tony into it with him.  It took another deep breath before Tony could join him.  “You’re not a victim, love – you’re a survivor.”  He kept his touch gentle, cradling Tony against him.  “And you’re mine to love now – mine to protect.”
“Whoa, hey.”  Steve’s eyes flew to Natasha.  “We aren’t – this isn’t – we’re not some sideshow act to be gawked at.”
Steve held him still with one hand on his hip.  “Let me go slow, sweetheart – I want to savor this.”  He kissed Tony’s inner thigh again.
“Don’t,” Steve said, nipping at his ear.  “Want to feel you come on my cock, sweetheart.”  He shifted Tony, holding him up with one arm – which made Tony want to fucking swoon.  God, he loved being manhandled by this man.  Judging that Tony was prepped enough – and that his own patience was severely lacking today – Steve lowered Tony’s legs back down and encouraged him to turn around, facing the wall.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony moaned, rocking his ass back to meet Steve’s touch.  “Just – just move your hand a little faster – ”  Steve did, and a scant few seconds later Tony was cursing and writhing, spilling come onto the wall and floor.  Steve was only a thrust or two slower – the rippling of Tony around his cock was too much for him.
“Well, I know how you feel about being polite.”  Tony stepped up to the bed and rubbed his cock around Steve’s hole, spreading lube around.  Then he dipped his fingers back in.  A desire to be rough warred with the urge not to really hurt Steve.
It was the soft, eager little whimpers that did Steve in.  “God, you need it that bad, don’t you?” Steve whispered, looking down at his cock in Tony’s mouth.  “Need me to – to mark you up?” he panted.  “Too bad I can’t just come all over your pretty suit, walk you into the banquet all slick with me.”  Steve groaned, his fingers tightening in Tony’s hair.  “Hear everybody whisper… there goes Captain America’s slut.”  Tony moaned around Steve’s cock, a desperate needy noise that made Steve’s eyes roll back in his head as he came into Tony’s mouth.
“I do.”  Steve rocked his hips against Tony’s hand quite involuntarily, although it proved his point.  “Can’t understand people who don’t… seems like they’re missin’ out on half the fun.”
Steve shucked his shirt with a challenging eyebrow to Tony, who merely grinned.  Tony started on the attack, utilizing a mash-up of martial arts techniques, boxing moves learned from Happy, and a weird mélange of street moves.
“I really don’t care.”  Tony hooked a leg around the back of Steve’s thigh to pull him close.  “Thirty seconds or an hour, it’s all good.  Just want you.”
The lightbulb went on in Tony’s head, and suddenly he wasn’t angry – or tired.  (Well, no.  He was still damned tired, but not too tired for this.)  “You fucking troll.”  He leaned in and kissed Steve, hard.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I can do that.”  He tangled a hand in Steve’s hair and tugged until Steve tilted his head back, exposing his neck.  “God, I didn’t know I needed this until right now.”
"Yes, sir."  That smug, trollish smile that Tony adored spread across Steve's face -- and then the engineer found himself spun around to face the concrete, his pants yanked down to his knees.
“I can get behind that idea,” Steve agreed, smiling.  “Burger and fries, and maybe a shake?”  He ran his hand up and down Tony’s back.  “Any other takers?”
Tony blinked.  “Um.  No.”  Other than being an odd mix of confused and aroused.  He started to peel off his undersuit as well.
Both options sucked at the moment, but at least in a bath Tony wouldn’t have to get his face wet.  “Bath.”  He let Steve fuss over him – it was so damned nice to be cared for.  “It’s his own fear talkin’, I think.  Do you know…” Steve trailed off, testing the heat of the water before plugging the tub.  “Do you know who hurt him?  Somebody did, right?”
When they broke apart, both men were panting.  “You are not expendable,” Steve repeated, this time in a low snarl.  But he couldn’t say more – not without tilting into areas they didn’t talk about.  Instead, he started to fumble with the clasps of his uniform.
“Since I’m not the only one living here, Pep.”  Tony closed his hand around Steve’s.  “It’s not fair to have you barge in on Steve.”
Either way, Tony kind of figured he should do something to distract the good Captain before he either caused a rash of swooning SHIELD nurses or got jabbed with a sedative.
“That can be arranged,” Steve promised solemnly… but his eyes were twinkling.  “Maybe if you’re wearing fewer clothes?”
He hadn’t actually intended that to be in relation to their dalliances, but… well, this worked too.  Steve carefully squeezed lube onto his fingers and eased two into Tony’s tight passage.  They’d made love the night before, so Tony was partially stretched – enough not to have to be too gentle.  “Wanna make you swear, babydoll.”
Tony returned with his arms full – two steaming hot towels, a bottle of massage oil, and several dry towels.  He nudged Steve aside and laid out dry towels, then urged him back onto them on his stomach.  Carefully, Tony spread one hot towel across Steve’s shoulders and the second across hs ass and thighs.  “Just relax, baby,” Tony murmured, bending down to kiss Steve’s cheek.
“I do too, doll – but I want more.”  Steve lowered Tony onto the bed, pausing to kiss him tenderly.  “You have no idea how hard it’s been to hold back.  Not to shower you with love every time we touch.  How much it ached to pull away from you afterwards and pretend it didn’t mean anything.”  He cupped his hand around Tony’s cheek, feeling his heart swell when Tony nuzzled into his hand.  “God, I love you.”
They panted together, desperate clutches turning into soft caresses.  Steve slipped out carefully as he softened, shifting to the side to pull Tony into his arms.  “We should shower,” he said eventually – though he didn’t move.
Tony chuckled a little as he was covered in a supersoldier blanket, running his hand up and down Steve’s arm.  “I love you, sugar.”
“Deal.”  Tony nipped Steve’s bottom lip, grinning at the shiver it produced.  He shifted position again so that he was leaning over Steve, and started to nibble down his neck and chest.  He avoided the sensitive nipples for now, biting small marks down the center of Steve’s torso on his way to meet his hand on the supersoldier’s cock.
No sooner had they landed than the Iron Man armor started to peel back from Tony, revealing him in the tight black undersuit.  Steve growled, low in his throat, and reached for Tony.  "Already hard for me?" Steve murmured, letting a gloved hand slide down the black fabric to the bulge of Tony's arousal.
Two, People were in danger, I had to go whether I trusted Loki or not. Which for the record I didn't, not after the punch thing.
. Attached are the names and pictures of everyone he killed while he was here. Eleven of them were SI employees, just going about their business in the tower that day. If you really think Loki is different, if you really, truly, honestly believe that, I want you to go through each and every fucking one of them, look those pictures in the eye and pretend you’re explaining to them and their families why you’re trusting the scumbag that killed them. Explain to them, because I sure as hell don’t get it. I bet you don’t get to the end before you’re sick.
Perhaps, for most people, one taste of heroism would be enough, but since that first rescue Nomad has been seen offering his unofficial assistance more than 20 times. Each time, he has left any criminals behind for the police before fleeing, quickly losing his pursuers. Nomad's main powers are said to be his strength and speed, leaving some to suggest that he is not super-human at all but merely very athletic. However, Ms Fernandaz is adamant that Nomad is indeed an unregistered superhuman, saying 'He's a hero. Normal men can't hold up a building that's falling down.'
Don't you dare drink to deal with this. I know that's what you do when you're upset and I know that's what you're doing now. But I'm telling you, don't you dare. Not only is it irresponsible when you have James to think about, it's downright disrespectful to Goliath. Not to mention Thor. He's gone and you act like you can replace him with some horrible artificial thing!
Tony and Steve both froze, their head turning to simultaneously glare at their friends. “Evil, you guys are just evil,” Tony said.
Dum-E swung his head to the side, like a huff, before rolling over to his corner. “Oh don’t sulk,” Tony cried, scrambling after. “You know you deserve that. You almost broke my blender!”
, and looked up to find Steve sitting on the bed, staring at him with wide eyes. Tony looked down – oh. The scars. Steve was staring at his scars.
“My family crossed the Black Sea into Russia, travelled hundreds of miles to the nearest airstrip, and boarded a plane to America. He doesn’t remember, but I was a child when I met Steve, and that day gave me hope that we would survive the war.
Steve pulled them into a bay right beside the entrance of the marketplace, and switched the engine off. “This is why I wanted to take the bike, parking’s terrible here.”
All too soon it was over, as Steve slowed them down to a stop. The engines was deafening, it’s roar consuming Tony’s senses. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t noticed it earlier, it was as though every single thing that had heightened Tony’s senses, had at the same time, blocked out the incessant wailing that was overriding his senses now.
He swallowed, what he was thinking was dangerous. He couldn’t think of Steve like that, he couldn’t let himself believe Steve thought of
“You totally will.” Tony said with a grin, burying himself under multiple blankets and throwing them over Steve as well.
sketchbook. Tony swallowed loudly – or maybe not, Steve couldn’t really tell if it was loud or if the serum just helped him pick it up over the growing ringing in his ears.
“You obsess over your mistakes, and so force the rest of us to as well, even though we either don’t think it’s that big a deal, or don't think it actually matters in the first place. Tony, whatever you did as a dumb 20 something year old can be forgiven with everything you have done now to help those you once hurt.
“If you would like Boss, I could look through Uber’s archives and database,” she said, bringing up a hologram list in front of Tony. “I could find places that serve pancakes, and have a partnership with Uber Eats.”
“Not to my knowledge Boss, I believe the last time you had cash was when you hoped the girl scouts would come with some cookies.”
“The scars,” Tony said, rummaging through the bag and trying not to flush. “What you were looking at. They’re mostly from Afghanistan. Kinda difficult to do a decent surgery in that environment, so… scars.”
Finally, a nurse came into the room. Steve sensed more than he saw his friends perk up, their attention solely on her. “I’ll cut to the chase,” she said. “He’s stable.”
FRIDAY hummed. “Isn’t that a conflict of interest? You helping Steve could swing things to go your way.”
“It’s a bet,” Clint said. “And you better make sure I fucking win, Stark! I got like… 10 dollars riding on this.”
“And I know he cares about me, but it’s just like how he cares about all of us. You, Bruce, Clint, Thor, Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, FRIDAY, his bots. He loves us all so much, I know that, but he loves us in the sense that we’re his family. He doesn’t love us – me, in any sort of way that could signify anything more. And I don’t blame him.
Tony collapsed at the kitchen island beside Natasha, who looked down slightly at Tony, then back at her StarkPad. “Where were you both?”
Walking into the gardens was like being transported into a haven. Bird calls, cicada’s, and the distant noise of running water were the soundtrack against the dark towering oak trees. Their leaves wove above their heads, shielding them from the harsh sun as they wandered through the crowd. Iridescent blues, greens, yellows, and pinks painted the sides of the large cobblestone road, which wound through various plants and onto flattened dirt pathways. A cool breeze blew through Natasha’s hair, and made a rustling noise with the leaves and branches, another instrument to the gardens band. When Natasha breathed in, she could feel the tranquillity of the plants, the easiness of the lives of the animals –  the squirrels burrowing into trees, the frogs hopping on the ground, and felt a sense of kinship with them.
Natasha almost groaned. Damn that man was an idiot. “Give it to him, if you have something for you he’ll let you in.”
Their faces were so close that Tony could feel Steve’s ragged, shallow breathing across his face. Tony couldn’t take it, Steve was miserable – Tony had somehow made Steve think he should
A man who had eyes that reminded Tony of the sun, who made Tony believe he had seen and travelled to every important place in the universe, for he could see it all in his eyes.
Clint walked under the arch way gazing up at the purple flowers that headed it. “Hey I recognise these! What’re they called?”
Tony whispered something in Steve’s ear and the pair walked off, saying how they would be back soon and only take a moment.
“The Boss won’t be free either,” FRIDAY said. “He’s got a dinner meeting with some new investors. Pepper’s been on his arse about it for weeks, it’s actually really rather funny.”
“Look – I know that it’s not like I’m not good enough for him, that’s for him to decide and I wouldn’t take that agency from him. But, he has this whole world that I couldn’t possibly fit in, this whole life where right now, I can squeeze into, but anything more and I’d just throw myself out. He just holds
The team had arrived to the hospital shortly after Steve had, which Clint said was a feat, considering they’d crossed over a block to get the quinjet.
, native to Northern Australia. They’re actually the official flower of the area – really drought resistant, need less water than a cactus.”
Then he blinked, composed himself, and dug his spoon out of his bowl. The moment was over, and no one else had been any the wiser.
As soon as Nurse Palmer was gone, their gazes fell onto Steve, it must have been clear on his face, because none of them seemed to even want to suggest anything different.
“It’s hard to remember why we all hated him when we have an angry Cheeto as president now.” Clint remarked.
There were hedges that lined the garden. Cut into them were different Nordic runes that Natasha could recognise, but couldn’t translate or explain. Thor gravitated to them, and ran his hands along the golden metal that held it all in place.  The entire garden held a sense of grandeur of scale with antique simplicity. Triangle and curved lined patterns were carved onto almost every surface, but often petered out into the blank slate of the stone. Gold was woven into various surfaces, it was beautiful in its subtlety. Tony’s garden was the perfect meshing of Asgardian design, American Art Deco, and Russian Neoclassicalism.
Steve was grinning back, and it was in that moment that Tony realised he was friends with her, that he was most likely friends with every seller in this market.
Steve took a sharp turn, leaning to the left. It was exhilarating, as though they were defying gravity. Tony could lean his face forward and let his nose graze the road, if he wanted to. He could see the little cracks and splits in the bitumen that showed it’s age, he could taste the dust and smell the burning gravel, singeing his nose. It was like flying, but on the ground, with his arms wrapped securely around Steve.
I've only held him once. The kidnapper has probably held him more than I have. Help me find him, Jarvis. You think more like Natasha than I ever could, you basically are her thought process. She must have some way to track him, something we can use. We just need to find it.
Well maybe Cap could sign up for proper piano lessons sometime. Aunt May used to take me to some but I'm....really not musically talented. I think I might be the only child in history to have their teacher quit them...
The life sentence is only for those who refuse to register. No one has done that yet, and if they did I don't think they would really get a life sentence...it is just a threat.
Speaking of secrets, what exactly are you going to tell Aunt May to convince her to come to the tower? She'll want to know why you think Loki is after me, and even if you do, that doesn't mean she'll agree to leave her home and I'm not going anywhere without her.
What do you mean by dealing with it? The monsters or Loki? He sort of seemed like he was in trouble.
Lucy isn't any of that stuff, she is cool. Plus how would any villains know to be here yet? The only people who knew I was Spiderman and moving to Florida in time to enroll are Avengers.
P.S Don't be too hard on the Twins. Wanda told me that it was a Stark Weapon that killed their parents. They don't really hate you I don't think, you are just easier to blame than a faceless solider. Give them time.
I know I know, they just print bad stuff to sell more papers. It still sucks to see it all the time though....
Darling, I think you've been with me long enough to know it is impossible for me to not get a room full of people to love me, specially when the majority of them are old white men who seemed to enjoy my skirt ;P
You can't leave the clone in the hands of Shield. 'There if you need it'? What happened to 'It will never see the light of day'? Shield will use it at the first opportunity, and besides dancing on the grave of our friend that thing is massively overpowered and not afraid to kill. You can't leave it with them.
The most annoying thing is he didn't do anything I couldn't have done. I mean, all he did was strap your body down and then make a load of noise and wave some fire around. I could have done that with matches, no Asgardian voodoo required. He scared it into this little jar and you can bet your life he wanted to keep it, but Fury pointed more and more guns at his head until he handed it over. We're lucky Fury doesn't trust anyone, not even Captain America.
Jarvis is way more than a ‘robot thing’. The S stands for ‘system’, after all. He’s a fully intelligent network that works with everything SI does. He has a voice and a really annoying personality and he likes to nag me. He’s like my right hand guy. And he looks after the Avengers, of course. He’d win me a Nobel prize in computing if I was stupid enough to submit the code, for real.
I'm also friends with a girl named Gwen Stacey, who you might have picked up in your head hunting. She is really smart and I know she is thinking of applying for Oxford. She is really pretty too, and kind. Her dad is Captain of the police force.
What I want to know is why someone took pictures, and why your dad had them, and how whoever broke in knew what to look for.
Prom is on Friday? Damn. I think we could be out here a couple of weeks. Take pictures, anyway. And I left Pepper with instructions to fix you up with a dress. Don’t try to fight her, she’s ruthlessly efficient. And yeah, there probably will be paps there, so at least get Happy to drive you.
Honestly? I want to back down. I've been trying to convince myself to give up on all this, to come home to you, see my son. Marrying you, having a family, it's pretty much all I ever wanted.
You do remember I have spider powers right? I don't need an escort! If you are worried about me I'll just webswing home, it is way faster.
It'll be okay! We'll appeal! I'll get new lawyers! You won't....you can't be gone 25 years! That is insane!

I'm not not going to the Prom because I can't afford a dress, I'm not going because Proms are stupid and boring when you don't have a date.
I like your hair. It matches your armour. But you don't look quite yourself, so don't keep it too long.
jerk. There are usually elbows involved. What I’m saying is, the guy plays like super dirty because he doesn’t see it as cheating. Ask him to rig the deck when we play cards, though, and nooo, that’s super dishonourable. It drives me crazy.
I'm sorry to do this to you, but I need you to go to Natasha. She is being controlled and she will probably try to attack you. But sooner or later Sin is going to get impatient and she'll come looking for me. If she finds my body here, she'll realise I'm on this 'astral plane' thing with Strange trying to break Nattie free of Sin's control. I need you to fight her, keep them both distracted.
That's why I talked to your father the other day. If you want to, you can go and live with him permanently. I won't make you go, and you will always have a home with me if you want it, but I do want you to think about it. You don't need to worry about me. June and I will be quite happy here in the sunshine.
I need to get out of here...I want to see Aunt May. I was so mean to her...I need to tell her I love her.
I still don't think you can get away with sneaking around his house to look at his stuff. You don't have any actual evidence that anything is in that closet. What if you go to all this trouble and it is just shoes or something?
Any ideas where I can find this Atkins? There has to be something better than just blindly running around town, trying to find her and avoid the law...
Look I know I messed up with the whole Spiderman things...but I learnt my lesson okay? As long as a hero registers willingly, their identity won't be released to the public.
Dum-e poured a glass of ice water over my face. I've programed him to do it if I sleep in too long, I guess he thought that's what the hypnosis was. Reed and Pym weren't too happy, apparently they were too busy trying more complicated methods to think of the obvious answer.
We'll need a big Shed to fit my Lab inside, but alright, but if I win then i'm extending my work curfew to 2am.
It isn't his dick! I don't know what it is. He was about to give it to me when Ultron attacked, but he hasn't mentioned it since.
Okay okay, I promise i'll be careful around Osborn. I'll make sure he never works out I'm Spiderman. I don't think he suspects me since he still think Spiderman is a guy. I mean I'm his Son's best friend, it wouldn't have been hard for him to trick me into a trap if he did suspect it was me under the mask.
Aunt May has agreed to Vision going with us, mainly because I don't she is able to actually say No to Captain America. You know, her Mother was one of the dancing girls in Cap's show? Apparently he took her helmet to goes save a bunch of solider in Italy or something, Steve seemed to remember her a little anyway.
You are in Canada to rest and get better, and because no one would think to look for you there! Why are you heading back!? Do you want to get caught?
Alright, I'm sorry. Even the rabbit wasn't that bad, it raised a lot of money for the children's hospital. Thanks for letting me auction it <3
Speaking of Steve, what if that went away? What does he have outside the Avengers? You have your company, Hawkeye has his family, Thor has Asgard, but what does Steve have? His family, his friends are all gone. Maybe he is afraid that without Captain America, Steve Rogers is nothing.
Okay, one, don’t flatter yourself, Miss Relative-Strength-of-a-Spider. The lock down was never designed to keep people in; in fact I deliberately made it so it was easy to get out of from inside. In case, you know, I ever got locked in with a psychopath. If you’d been outside trying to break in, do you really think the shutters would have pulled apart so easily? Don’t make me laugh.
No-one else on my team trusts you any more. If they don't think I've left you already, they think I should. They're calling you a traitor. I don't know how many more noses I can break defending you. I don't want to think badly of you. You can't be on board with this. I know you thought registration was for the best, but this is out of hand. Please, tell me they're just using your tech. Tell me this life-time, imprisonment without trial is nothing to do with you. But if it is, don't lie to me.
I guess I need to make a statement myself, but I just don't think they'll believe me. I don't have any proof of what she was. You believe me right?
Spiderman onto her side? After being a staunch ally of Captain America at the beginning of the pre-vote campaigns, Parker did seem to switch sides rather quickly. Let's face it, he wouldn't be the first boy to have his head turned by a pretty face; and he wouldn't be the first handsome young man to be connected to Ms Stark. Perhaps it was news of his impending fatherhood that prompted him to move into the mansion.
I'm not moving to some suburban neighbourhood with a picket fence, I don't care what your fantasy is. Where the hell would I put the lab? Underground? I'm not a mole Steve.
Well Vision doesn't have to come with us if he doesn't want to. Me and Aunt May will be alright, we always are :)
I would have told her eventually...after things had calmed down. And it isn't like she was in danger! But now you've made her panic and make a rash decision!
The pictures, developed from negatives in Howard Stark's personal collection, clearly show Cap throwing punches at a young woman- and he isn't holding back. In one image you can see him pinning her to the ground whilst raising his shield to bring down brutally on her head, whilst the others show him continuing the vicious assault. From the shape and design of the shield and uniform, these pictures clearly date from the USO tours; and from her costume it seems the victim of the terrible attack was one of Rogers' fellow performers, one of eight girls that formed the chorus line during the show.
right. You and Cap and Thor can be optimists all you like, Steve can make as many ‘I don’t like it but he deserves a second chance’ speeches as he likes, Thor can lecture me on this mystic mumbo-jumbo until the cows come home, but you are
Thank you for offering to help, but I really can handle this on my own. I told you, I only want justice. I'm not planning on hurting the guy when I find him, I just want to hand him over to the police so he can have a trial and go to prison.
I don't really mind her being here, she seems pretty cool for an old broad. Plus she cooks, so that is a plus. Without you here i've mainly been on take aways lately.
'This is only temporary,' Rogers assured journalists in a joint statement released with his wife, Natasha Stark, today. However, Stark responded by quipping 'That's what he thinks'. Could this be the sign of more trouble in Super-paradise?
So why am I avoiding Captain America? He wouldn't tell me what happened when I asked, just got annoyed that you asked me to avoid him. You know if you are going to put me into the middle of a fight between you two I'd like to know what is going on.
My background check on Dr Atkins shows no sign of her beyond a year ago. I believe she may have planned to get close to Mrs Stark in order to kidnap James from the start.
Things are...complicated with my friends right now. Harry told Mary Jane he was in love with her while he was under the influence of the truth potion, and she...did not feel the same way. Then he was kind of a jerk to her, so now they are fighting and want me to pick sides....
You know what your problem is? You think you are right and don't listen to anyone else! Thor told you he isn't evil but you won't listen to him. I told you I was keeping an eye on him, and I told you I was avoiding him, but you didn't trust me enough to just leave me to it. I'm not a normal kid, I have powers that can protect me, one of which is being able to sense immediate danger! I can handle Loki, at least enough to go to school with him.
Steve, we've already tried to control this on our own. The Avengers failed. We let people run around unchecked and because of that children died. Children died because a group of fame hungry assholes tried to play hero for a fucking TV show!
I was thinking, since Aunt May isn't well...maybe I could move in with you again for a while. I mean she needs to relax, not worry about whether her super powered niece is gonna turn into a monster again...
But by the by, I don’t regret that night. I’m kind of surprised to say it, but I’m happy I got to meet you, okay? And I guess I’m happy you kept writing to me, even though you’re being all melodramatic right now. (Steve says you get it from me. Then told me not to invalidate your feelings. I’m not invalidating your feelings, I’m just correcting your misunderstandings. Deal with it.)
P.S So how does this badge work? Does it like track my heart rate or would I need to activate it or something? And what do you mean by activate? Does it send a signal to the police or is it like a rape alarm?
NATASHA: That happens when you have a new born who barely sleeps. You know most women get a break when their husband takes a turn!
After more than a lifetime of fighting for freedom, democracy and justice, Captain America has today let everyone down. As of midnight last night, the deadline for heroes to register under the SHRA has passed- and one name is conspicuously absent. Steven Rogers, Captain America, has failed to register.
Not Guilty- Again, Rogers is not being held legally responsible for the actions of those fighting with or against him.
I won't let the clone back out there. I don't even want to look at that thing! But I won't destroy it...i can't...
I will water the plants and pick up your mail. Tell me which books you want and I’ll get those too. I will also punch Loki in the face.
The date was nice. We went to see a movie and then went back to Loki's for dinner (He is a surprisingly good cook), then we he walked me back to the Tower so I wouldn't miss curfew and you wouldn't set the Iron legion on him.
I want to come! It is my house, and if Loki has been hiding there I kinda wanna punch him the face. That is like...super creepy. I really hope 'Nat' is wrong... (Plus if you let me come I can water Aunt May's flowers and pick up our mail. Also I left a couple text books.)
Look he is just in my class, it isn't like I have to talk to him. There are load of kids I don't talk to. Honestly I'm not all that popular, Loki will probably just ignore me like everyone else. Plus, he is sort of hot now, so I imagine Liz Allen or one of the other cheerleaders will get their claws into him and then he'll have to give me a wide berth. So it is fine, I don't have to transfer.
Things are okay here, I guess. Right now it's only me, Steve, the twins and Vision in the Tower. Bruce has gone out somewhere quieter because he
Okay, one, you need more friends. Two, don’t try to guilt trip me with your teenage drama into letting my archenemy’s gun-bait son into my house. I’m trying to keep you safe.
Did you see they’re showing some documentary about my Dad at the weekend? Just to say, don’t believe a word of it. He was a good business man but a crappy father, and I think they’re going to try and make it look like the other way around; not to mention make out that he and Cap were bff. Just don’t go watching it expecting it to be a true insight into your family history or anything.
I admit, Loki was sort of helpful against Ultron at the party. But I’m telling you now, if you two have sex in my tower I’m throwing you both out! And don’t think you and/or Thor are forgiven for inviting him either. Or did you forget that the last time he was in there he was using it to try and literally destroy the world?
I guess it was insensitive of me to ask considering how you became Ironman. I'm sorry. That must have been a horrible time.
Speaking of talking too much. Prom was...eventful. Mainly because Loki showed up and spiked the Punch with some sort of truth potion. So yeah he knows I'm Spiderman now, and basically everyone in the school is mad at someone else because they said something they should have been keeping a secret.
He and Wanda just stopped by to check I was okay. They haven't seen me since we escaped and were worried I was upset by some of the stuff Osbourne said..
I've been looking into it, but who ever broke in was good. They knew exactly how to get in and out without leaving any clues. If I didn't know any better I'd swear it was Antman who broke in! (I checked, Scott was with his Daughter in Florida at the time).
Also, like three-quarters of being an Avenger is learning how to carry on after you get your ass handed to you. You realise Steve’s first time out the guy he was chasing killed himself and a kid almost drowned, right? And my first time I crashed in the middle of the desert. So calm down, okay? We’ll get him. Loki too.
It wasn't supposed to be like this! I was barely past it being theoretical....but Pym and Reed must have looked at it while I was away and...
I’m in the lab with Vision trying to piece Jarvis back together. Text me when you’re awake and I’ll come down. Your phone is on the side. (I took the liberty of upgrading your OS. You were like two behind.)
Speaking of nuts, did you really just describe Loki as nice? Loki? Listen kid, I’m all for second chances, but someone doesn’t become a pagan deity representing the
P.S Xavier's school won't accept me. I'm not a mutant. Or I guess I should say my powers aren't caused by the Mutant X gene. I'm a mutagen.
When asked whether she thought Rogers was treating his wife in the same way, Atkins admitted she was unsure. 'It's likely he's tried during the struggle for dominance,' she said, 'But he may have been afraid of being discovered, with his wife being so in the limelight'. However, she refused to rule out the possibility that physical or emotional abuse had taken place in the relationship, stating that 'it may explain Stark's 'sudden change in attitude' as she went from swinging party girl to wedded wife.
. Shield is in pieces and what little remains is too busy fighting each other to be any help, so you’re the only one that can handle this. Be careful.
Look all I was saying was if you want to keep us a secret you need to keeps the amount of lies you tell to the minimum. The more you tell the more you are likely to get caught out and then people will be suspicious about why you were lying in the first place....but I guess it came off a little snappy...so, sorry.
That's the thing with infants. They have so much potential. Especially yours. You like justice, don't you? Then tell me why your son got to inherit your strength, your healing, your
The thing you don’t know about Loki is that if Loki is in trouble it’s probably a good thing, and the ‘monsters’ are probably good guys. Like I said, we’re working on it. We’ll find out what he’s up to and get the problem sorted, whoever it is.
And I don't have a crush! I just said he was attractive, objectively. A lot of guys are objectively attractive, but most of the time I'd rather be dating a rock.
So first of all, know that I love you. I've always thought of you as a daughter and I always will. But part of raising a child is knowing when to let them go. I always thought it would be after you left college, but it looks like the time is on us. I think if you're honest you know that too.
Can you believe, they even asked me about it at the forum at the University last night? They asked me if I wanted kids, if you wanted kids, why we hadn't had them and all sorts of really personal stuff. That was the professional journalists, too. The kids enrolled there were asking sensible questions. Still, I think I have the student vote, sorry :P I kind of wish I'd been able to get Spiderman to come back me up, but I haven't seen him around lately. Let me know if you see him out patrolling or whatever, okay? I just want to check he's still alive.
Aww are you jealous? All the Avengers have Fangirls you know, Cap is just the one most girls think is the hottest. Thor is a pretty close second, so maybe the girls at my school just like blondes?
Well I can't do that and I can't do this either. If your Pigheaded cause is more important than you family then fine!
Harry does have a way to call for help, it’s called 911. Look, the Avengers reached out to his dad and his dad didn’t want to know. There’s not much else we can do except keep you the hell away from them and whatever they’re mixed up in.
Let’s get something else straight- me and Captain America are not and will never be friends, mostly because the man is an insufferable, self-righteous pain in the ass with a serious hero complex. He’s a good leader and exactly the kind of person we need to lead the Avengers, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it.
I don't see how me not going to Prom could have anything to do with you, but fine. If it is to protect your reputation then I guess I can swing by. If only to get the girls off my back about going.
One, you are just mad I found a design flaw. Javis seemed pretty convinced I wouldn't be able to get out, or did you not let him in on you little 'easier to get out from the inside' secret? You know, I might be able to improve you design when I fix the shutters :P
I have your son. What should I do with him, I wonder? Shall I merely harvest what I need from him and then kill him? Shall I raise him as my own, raise him to hate you, raise him to wish he could have murdered him yourself, and only be sorry that he was too young to remember when mommy did it? Shall I come and throw him off a bridge before your eyes or shall I leave you to wonder, to suffer, for years to come?
So how did you sleep last night? Did you like the new protocol I set up with Jarvis for while I'm away?
If you ever need to talk, I can offer free and discreet therapy at any time of the day or night. Please think about it.
I've spoken to the lawyers. They think because of James being kidnapped, they can get you off for breaking out.
I've got a meeting with some members of the Government tomorrow. I think they want me to help with the registration process.
I don’t know anything about the kid, I’m just saying make sure this doesn’t get back to his dad. Osbourne is a snake. In high school he outed a guy four years younger than him because he wanted to distract him from a computer programming contest. The kid was thirteen, he probably didn’t even know himself yet. The guy is an asshole who isn’t smart enough to succeed on his products alone so he has to push everyone else down behind him. DO NOT TRUST HIM. That’s the only dad advice I’ll give you, so take heed.
Speaking of being 'out'... just how pretty is this Lucy girl anyway? You know I was joking about the bad influence thing. I'd hope I'm the worst influence on your life, just saying. Anyway, I'd much rather you dated a girl you liked rather than Loki or Dick Jr. Neither of them have shown up there, right?
So it's totally not my fault I haven't called, because I have called, and your aunt has put the phone down on me. Tough old bird, isn't she? She even hung up your mobile; at least, I hope that was her, unless you're pissed off at me over the whole kidnap-victim thing. But you know that was nothing to do with you being a Stark and entirely to do with you being Spiderman.
I told you the clone has been shut down! It isn't going to see the light of day again, so you can shut up about it!
So. WE'RE having a baby. How far along are you? I don't think I ever remember being this happy about anything. Or excited. Or terrified. It's strange, I always thought I'd like kids some day but now that it's happening it's sort of scary. You're happy too, right? And you're eating enough? Remember you have to eat (and sleep) for two right now. And I don't want you going out in the armour, understand? You have to look after yourself to keep our little one safe.
P.S. Sending you a vintage MCR tee. I thought it would match this new aesthetic you've got going on.
I don't really know what else to say. We should never have separated during the campaign, you know. I think by trying to avoid the fight we just made it worse and almost destroyed our marriage. That's the last thing on earth I want. So, given that we said we'd state everything clearly and honestly in these e-mails:
Speaking of the issues, what exactly did you say to Spiderman? He told me you had some, quote, 'good points'. Did you just steal my main guy? Because that's kind of underhand.
Uh-oh, we just strayed into comic territory! Specifically Tony is referring to the latest series of Young Avengers, and Loki's (mis)adventures with them.
You really think I give the press photos like that?! You are meant to be coming home to me remember. Why would I destroy your reputation!?!
Technically I said 'admired' :P But yeah, ofcourse I do. You are Tony Stark! You built a working arc reactor in the middle of the desert in some cave! Why wouldn't I admire you?
That does sound pretty terrible...but Harry isn't like that. Anyway, it isn't like I talk to his Dad much, he is hardly ever around. Running the company keeps him really busy I guess. I think I've only seen him about three times this year.
Look, you can’t stay pissed at me for showing up at your house. I showed you the letter, what was I meant to do? You need to be really careful if he’s intercepting your mail; and if he knows about how we’re related. Maybe you and your aunt should come stay in the tower for a while. Then I promise we can hang out when neither of us are in suits.
P.P.S When do you finish for the summer anyway? I’m getting further with Ultron but I could kind of use an intern. You can still work on the body heat generators in you want, but if you’re going to be free soon I thought I’d give you first dibs.
Spiderman is...well he is sort of a dork too. I mean he makes all these lame jokes when he is fighting. Honestly I think he is just doing it to cover how scared he is. I know when I panic I get defensive and start making lame jokes. He seems nice though, I think he is just trying to help in any way he can. I doubt he could take on a big bad guy like that Loki though.
You know, supers are still out there fighting over the act. It seems like a lifetime ago. I hate the idea that even when we get James back, I might not be able to come home to you, that this won't be over. I miss you.
Shut down isn't good enough. Unless it's sentient, unless it's actually alive, you need to destroy the clone.
And as for Osbourne, we don’t know what he can do yet. Just because he thinks his son was at prom with you yesterday doesn’t mean he wouldn’t slit your throat as soon as look at you. This is the guy that tried to out me at thirteen to win a contest, the guy who ratted you out to the papers, who is keeping the ACME My First Villain kit locked up in a pretend-y liquor cabinet! Why won’t you ever listen?!
As soon as the lock was engaged, Steve was on him, kissing hungrily.  “Need you right now,” he moaned.  “Christ, I could eat you alive.”  Heedless of his suit, Steve dropped to his knees in front of Tony and unfastened the engineer’s pants.  Tony sucked in a startled breath but didn’t object.
Tony held it together in the limo – somehow.  Probably because he didn’t want to make Happy uncomfortable, although neither man would ever express that.
Steve smirked.  “No, that’s your cardinal rule.”  He buried himself in Tony, holding him there.  “My golden rule?”  He pressed closer until he was breathing in Tony’s ear.  “You are not expendable.”
“No.”  Tony turned his head into Steve’s neck.  “But I think I’d better.”  He sighed and rose, pawing through dresser drawers for something to wear.  “You don’t have to stay.”
“I’m always here for you, sweetheart.”  There didn’t seem to be anything else that Steve could tweak on this ridiculous outfit, so he took a deep breath and stepped into the bedroom, holding his arms out expectantly to Tony.  “Well?  Do I pass?”
Steve’s arms tightened around him.  “I’m not gonna leave you to do ‘em alone, doll.”  He kissed the top of Tony’s head.  “I’ll learn, or not – but I’d rather be with you than sittin’ at home thinkin’ about all those ladies hangin’ off you.”
Steve put his hands on either side of Tony's head.  "Brace yourself and think of SHIELD," he teased, before pulling out and burying himself fulling, gasping as he bottomed out.  Tony lifted his ass slightly to meet him, rocking his pelvis.  "Christ, don't do that, I won't make it another -- " he repeated the stroke, and Tony doubled down by squeezing his muscles around Steve's cock.  "God, Tony," Steve breathed -- and gave in.  One more thrust and he felt himself come, filling Tony and spilling onto the dusty ground.  He managed one more, gasping, as the pulse of orgasm swept through him.
“No, this is a lot more fun.”  Tony scooted closer so that he could kiss Steve, the water sloshing against the tub.  For a moment it made Tony freeze, but he was able to push past it.  “What is it you said to me?  Lie back and think of SHIELD?”  He wrapped his fingers around Steve’s cock, pumping it slowly.
Arriving at the theater was a bigger spectacle than arriving at the restaurant.  Happy – who possessed that ability of all the best chauffeurs, manservants, and aides to fade into the background – pulled up to the entrance silently, and got out to open their door.  Steve stepped out first, scanning the crowd before offering Tony his hand.  Tony got out as well, standing next to Steve and feeling exposed.
That worked better, and they continued in that configuration for forty-five minutes.  Steve called a hydration halt and considered them all.  “One last scramble.  Clint and Nat, Thor and Bruce, Tony – you’re with me this time.”
“Ah, hell, I’m not gonna last much longer,” Steve gasped, his hand tightening in Tony’s hair again.  “Please – God.”
Chuckling, Tony tangled his fingers in blond hair.  “I’m a middle-aged man, Cap – no matter how good your mouth is, it’s probably going to be awhile before I get hard again.”
“I do – fuck, yes – right there, baby.  God, your hands are… so nimble and… long fingers…”  Tony let his head fall forward against Steve, moaning.  “I could come just like this, just on your fingers.”
Tony tilted his head up to look at Steve.  “I like Tonysexual.  That’s a very acceptable orientation.”  He stroked his fingertips over Steve’s cheekbone softly before turning back to Pepper.  “I’ve been openly bi for years, Pep.  You know that.”
“I do,” Tony murmured.  “Trust you, mean.  And… I love you.”  He twisted until he could kiss Steve on the lips.  His hand slipped down to Steve’s cock – barely hard.  “Why haven’t we invested in waterproof lube yet?”
“Well, we can try and find mad without scared,” Steve offered lightly.  “I mean, we fight enough idiots that surely I can get riled up over some asshole setting more robots on Central Park or a dipshit trying to genetically engineer mutant squirrels or something.”
“Both.”  Steve nipped lightly at Tony’s earlobe.  “Another round like that and you really will be sore – and we both know it.  And I… really like it when you take me.”  He flushed.  “Feels… I don’t know.  Possessive.”
Tony had chosen to ride back with them rather than take the suit.  Steve slid his arm around Tony’s waist as the others talked.  Natasha seemed to be arguing for a different film genre.  Bruce protested Thai and suggested Indian instead, but was mollified by Thor’s suggestion that they just order both.  None of them mentioned their co-leaders cuddling… and Tony was pretty sure it counted as cuddling, considering he was nearly asleep on Steve’s shoulder.
Clint snorted.  “Seriously?!  Even I could tell you were in love, and I’ve got the emotional capacity of a teaspoon.”  He kicked his legs up onto the arm of the couch.  “I’ve got money on Tony first, six weeks ago.  So…?”
“Can’t,” Steve said easily.  He let his eyes drift down Tony’s form, admiring the undersuit and the man inside it.  “I needed to have a talk with you.  It’s very important.”
Steve met his eyes, searching.  “Alright.  I won’t ask you to break that – unless it’s a danger to the team.”
“Don’t mind if I do.”  Steve set an almost brutal pace, his thighs flexing as he rose and fell on Tony’s cock, panting and keening.  “Feel like – like you’re made for me.”  He ground down, taking Tony as deeply as he could.
“Babydoll, my life would be dark and cold without you,” Steve said softly.  “I don’t wanna think about the man I’d be, without you to come home to.”
Steve rose too.  “Not yet,” he teased – making their teammates laugh.  “Seriously, guys, thanks for not being – ”
“So demanding,” Steve chuckled, letting the head push past the rim but no further.  Tony growled, low in his chest.  He started wriggling, trying to force more of Steve’s cock into him but the supersoldier held him firm.  “Don’t rush me, doll.  You’ll get what you need, I promise.”  He pressed forward slowly – so slowly – sinking his cock into Tony at an agonizing pace.  They were both panting and desperate when was fully seated, but Steve didn’t immediately move again.  “I love you,” he whispered into Tony’s ear.
The rippling clutch of Tony’s ass around him was enough to send Steve over the edge as well, and he flooded Tony with come.  He kept thrusting until they both were too sensitive to continue, then held himself on a trembling arm above his lover, pressing sloppy kisses to his face.
“One of these days,” Steve panted into Tony’s ear, “we’re going to get caught.”  His cock pistoned in and out of his lover, making both of them grunt and swear.
Turning away, Steve sucked in a breath and forced it out, slowly.  “I just watched our team’s sniper sharpshooter fall off a really high drop in front of me, and I couldn’t get to him.”
“So good,” Steve managed after a moment.  “Jesus, Tony.”  Steve sank to his knees next to Tony, pulling him into an embrace.  “God, I love your mouth.”  He brought their lips together, heedless of the taste of himself.
And fuck if that wasn’t enough to push Steve over the edge.  He came hard, his hands tightening on Tony’s ass – probably leaving fingertip bruises – and spilled between then.  Tony held on for two strokes more before burying himself as deep as he could in Steve and coming as well, panting for breath.
Steve grunted and pulled Tony tight to him.  “I love you,” he breathed in Tony’s ear – and that was all it took.  Tony gasped as he came, spilling into Steve and barely noticing Steve doing the same between them.
“And bed.  For both of us,” Tony added, when Steve raised a disbelieving eyebrow at him.  “I’ll make you a deal.  I won’t disappear into the workshop tonight if you come to bed with me.  We don’t have to sleep, just…”
“Alright!  You win,” Tony chuckled weakly.  “God, we need a shower.”  He ran a hand through the cooling come on his stomach – a mix of both of theirs and though theoretically that was romantic… in practicality, it was cold and sticky.  “Get up, you big lug.”  Tony elbowed Steve, who was pleasantly drowsy.
“I feel it,” Tony promised.  The pleasure was drowning him, but he wouldn’t look away from Steve’s gaze.  “Do you feel it too, baby?”
“Oh, hell,” Tony groaned.  He lifted one hand to his mouth and bit down on a knuckle, the other twining in Steve’s hair.  It was hotter than he’d have guessed.  He’d had blowjobs in public places before, but nothing compared to this.  Steve’s mouth was a thing of beauty, and the way he worked his tongue along the bottom of Tony’s cock –
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve said solemnly, his eyes twinkling.  He leaned in and kissed Tony instead.
“Fucking troll.”  Tony pulled gently on Steve’s hair, his eyes dancing.  “Who says I want you to?  What if I want to top, hmm?”
“Yeah.”  Tony wound the fingers of his right hand into Steve’s hair.  As many positions and varieties as they’d tried, Steve had always been careful to avoid the arc reactor.  “Just… be careful?”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony purred.  “I’m really gonna.  You broke the rule, after all.”  He reached over to stroke his fingers over Steve’s nipple.  “Four pots of coffee, four orgasms.  It’s only fair.”
“I don’t know if it’s stupid or not.”  Tony leaned into Steve’s embrace, tilting his head up for a kiss.  “But I guess it doesn’t matter – it just is.  I promise that I’ll tell you in the extremely unlikely event that I’m unsatisfied in the bedroom.”
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and pressed his nose just under Tony’s ear.  He just held him, feeling the reassuring hardness of the arc reactor pressing into his chest.  That meant Tony was alive.  That little circle of light meant he wasn’t going to lose Tony too.  “Sorry.  I’m all over the place.”
Tony snorted.  “Steve, you’re a supersoldier built like a Greek god, with stamina enough to wear out a damned football team.”  He nudged a startled Steve off him to sit up.  “I’m considerably older than you physically, and… not in the best of health.”  He hunched his shoulders, unconsciously protecting the arc reactor.
It was a good thing this was round two since they got home – and technically round three for Tony, if he counted a blow job during dinner – because it gave him a little extra control.  Steve was always tight, but with such rushed prep it was even more intense.  Tony put his hands on Steve’s hips to guide him, hoping to keep him from rushing – to savor this moment.
It probably wasn’t smart to say it, but… “I’m not so tired I want to watch you hurt yourself, sweetheart.”  Tony carefully worked a third finger into Steve, smoothing his free hand down Steve’s side when the supersoldier bucked against him.  “I know the serum would heal you, that doesn’t mean I want you to hurt.”
“I’m a scarred up old man with a night light embedded in his sternum,” Tony protested mildly.  “You’re the beautiful one here, baby.”
It completely shocked – and secretly delighted – Tony that Steve was not only serious about rule two – being open – but that he legitimately wanted to take Tony out on a date.
“M’not.”  Steve’s voice was muffled against the skin of Tony’s neck.  “Not sharin’ you, doll.”  He pressed forward, trapping Tony against the wall of the elevator.  “All mine, every inch.”
Steve yielded easy against him, dropping his head to just rest there.  His head swam with things he couldn’t say.  “As soon as I can check on him myself, I’ll get out of here.”
“I like to watch.”  Tony stepped forward, trailing a finger down Steve’s chest.  “It’s like unwrapping the best Christmas present ever.”  He reached for the hem of the undershirt, tugging it up slowly.  His fingers grazed the firm abs.  “Thank you for tonight.”
“Need you right now,” Steve growled, peeling his uniform off.  “Holy Christ, right now.”  He stalked forward, pinning Tony against the wall of the tiny space.  “Do you have any idea how hot that was?  Jesus, Tony.”  He dropped his lips to Tony’s bare neck, sucking a mark into the olive flesh.
“Yeah,” Tony groaned.  “Yeah, ditto.”  He hooked one leg around Steve’s hips, pressing his heel into Steve to keep him close.  “Give it to me, Rogers.”
"You'll die of blue balls," Tony quipped, grinding his hips against Steve.  His own undersuit was thin enough to provide good sensation... Steve's less so.  Well, he could work with that.  He'd designed the suit, after all -- he knew where all the catches were.  Tony leaned back against the concrete and slid his hands down Steve's chest, lightly tapping the reflective star.  "Maybe you can find a different punishment, Cap... say... counting the strokes?"  He worked his fingers into the side of Steve's uniform, finally freeing some skin... abs, God those abs.  They were flexing, too, from holding Tony up.
Steve chuckled and dug for his utility belt and the handy package of wet wipes.  He handed Tony one and took one for himself.  “At least we’re off the street.”  He glanced around the tiny shopping kiosk – not much to speak of, but at least it provided some privacy.
“His dad,” Tony whispered.  “But it’s bigger than that.  Um.”  Tony fiddled with the hem of his undershirt.  “He told me in confidence.”
Tony squirmed and twisted until he was straddling Steve’s lap, then bent down to catch him in a searing kiss.  “Deal.”  He slid his hands into Steve’s blond hair, using it to guide the taller man’s head back so that he could reach the underside of his chin.
Tony refused to be ashamed of the fact that it only took moments for him to come.  Steve drank it all down, humming with pleasure.  He carefully lapped every bit of Tony clean before tucking him back into his boxers and refastening Tony’s pants.  Steve stood gracefully, looking pleased with himself.  “You’re a menace,” Tony told him, pulling on his tie to bring him in close for a kiss.  “An absolute terror.”
“You always do.”  Tony tried to keep the hand in Steve’s hair gentle, but that damned talented tongue…
Tony bucked up against him.  “I warned you about calling me that,” he moaned.  “God, who wouldn’t want to be called sir by Captain America?”
Steve kissed him, hard.  “Next time you try to tell me to ignore your orgasm, I’m going to spank you.”
Steve braced himself over Tony, low enough that their chests brushed together, and kissed him hard as his hips snapped forward.  Tony moaned into the kiss, meeting Steve’s thrust with a roll of his own hips.  “Ah, hell, sweetheart,” Steve whispered, breaking the kiss to drop his head onto Tony’s shoulder.  “This is going to be over really fast if you keep that up.”
They’d made it off the battlefield.  Thor had taken Bruce up to bed – Hulking out always left him in need of food and sleep.  (Tony might entertain a fantasy or two about what else might happen in those instances.)  Ordinarily he and Steve would either be burning off stress or splitting off to shower and eat.
“Because I don’t want to share you,” Tony said softly.  “That’s what I meant.”  He held a hand to Steve’s face, relaxing a little when the supersoldier leaned into the touch.  “I did say I didn’t want to talk about it, Steve – because every time I’ve had a discussion like this… it’s been… well.  Bad.”
Tony’s eyes met him, and he slipped one hand to the back of Steve’s head to pull him in for a kiss.  “My home is with you,” he whispered.
“Yeah.”  Tony chuckled, slipping onto his back on the bed.  He kept his eyes on Steve, wanting to make sure he hadn’t hurt the larger man – not that he really thought he could, but… well, hurting Steve was never the idea.  “How much time you need before number four?”
“I know that!”  Steve so rarely raised his voice outside fighting and training that it made both Tony’s eyebrows raise.  Steve halted his pacing and rubbed his forehead with one hand.  (He’d shed the gloves, at least – Tony liked that.)  “Sorry.  Just – sorry.”
Tony flickered his eyes around the room before stepping closer to Steve.  “You want to get out of here?”
He sucked and licked and nibbled until Steve was panting and cursing again, fully hard for the third time in a very short time.  Grinning, Tony pulled off and added more lube to his hand, slicking up his own cock.  “Ready for me, sugar?”
Anger flickered over Steve’s face, brutally stifled.  “You didn’t do anything wrong,” he said after a moment, tucking Tony just a little closer to him.
“And you took that to mean that talking would be the end of – this?”  Tony shook his head.  “Baby, that’s not – ”  Steve made a soft, sad sound that drew Tony’s eyes to his face.  “What did I say?”
“Every minute of every day,” Steve promised.  His kisses shifted from Tony’s lip to his neck, where he duplicated the mark Tony’d left on him.  This one would last longer than an hour, they both knew – and Steve reveled in leaving this sign of possession on his lover.
"Fuck yes," Tony moaned.  He reached for the arm around his waist, fingers locking onto the tight forearm.  "Which infraction is that, Rogers?  Was that swearing on an open comm, or..."
Smiling, Tony folded himself awkwardly so that he could place a kiss at the end of Steve’s rapidly hardening cock.  “More orgasms for us, I guess.”  He began to kiss along the length, his fingers never stopping their gentle stretching of Steve’s hole.
“Give me a minute, sweetheart,” Steve whispered, pressing a kiss just below Tony’s ear.  “Feel so good around me, need to just – just hold a minute.”  And he wanted Tony to relax – never wanted to cause his lover harm.
“More than.”  Tony rubbed his thumb on Steve’s scalp, amused to see the supersoldier leaning into it.  Maybe the cat metaphor was applicable more broadly… that was a hypothesis to test another day.
Tony might have lost a few braincells thinking about what Steve had been up to prior to the serum to wind up loose and sloppy.  “You were a pretty little twink, weren’t you?” Tony guessed.  “Had a whole stable of men wanting to dress you up, make you call them daddy?”
I'm not staying away from Harry and I'm not dropping out of school for weeks! I have exams! Anyway, surely it is better that I'm there to keep an eye on Loki. If he is up to something then I want to be there to stop him. I'm not going to leave my friends unprotected.
I just said Loki seemed nice, and really I would have thought you'd be more concerned about the hitting on me thing. Look you don't need to worry, I'm not interested in 12 year olds, and it is pretty doubtful I'll see him again. Like I said, I just save him from some weird monsters. It could have been anyone.
Kind of hard to be whoever I want when the papers are putting out a pretty clear imagine. I assume you saw them this morning? Looks like Harry went to the papers after all. Though all the articles say is 'a source'.
I swung by the mansion. Someone definitely broke in, and it looks like they were looking for something to destroy your reputation with, because nothing valuable was taken and there is stuff in here worth thousands.
(Actually I threw it out because it is gross, but it would really help me out if you pretended you ate it. Thanks.)
Also, Clint is going to meet you from school; on the corner so hopefully not too many folk will see. We figured he’s the least noticeable of all of us. We thought about it, and I got told I was ‘too flashy’. Nat is too suspicious, Steve is too hot, Thor is too Thor, and Bruce would definitely wind up looking creepy walking down the street with a teenage girl. At least Clint you can pass off as your loser brother/boyfriend/cousin or whatever and say he just came by to hang out if anyone does see. He can be fairly handy if there’s trouble, though I can tell you from experience that he doesn’t hit as hard as your aunt does.
Anyway, I was just a kid, I was more interested in robotics than sex. Only then the four horseman of puberty came crashing in and I realised that maybe I did like guys. I also realised that I really, really, really didn’t want King of the Dicks to be right. Or rather, he wasn’t right, because I liked girls too, but I didn’t want him to THINK he was right. So long story short, even though I was a raging bag of hormones that pretty much liked everyone I didn’t want to admit it, so I just went with girls. I got a bit older, started dating guys, but only ever in secret. When I got the company, I liked the whole playboy image, so I stuck with it. I had a look-but-don’t-touch policy with guys which, I don’t mind telling you, WAS REALLY HARD. But you know, don’t underestimate me when it comes to spiting Osbourne. :P
He has not been in the tower since yesterday morning, and when I questioned Mrs Stark about this, she collapsed and remains unconscious.
But then you showed up and paid my bail, so if anything you just proved my point; even though I know you think that opinion is ridiculous. So, you know, more fool you :P
You can't blame Steve for being a little cautious about mechanical help after what happened. Maybe he is worried about you trying to force peace and causing another Ultron.... Or maybe he doesn't want Robots to help, maybe he wants to worry.
P.P.S I have another two weeks, and then I'm done with school for the summer. Just got to get through the whole Gwen and Mary Jane nagging me to go to the Junior Prom thing first.
He was helpful though, old Vish. With Jarvis down, he was the one that could trace the pin. Then he went invisible (also not my idea, but AWESOME) and strolled around the base until he found which wall we needed to punch down. I guess you know the rest.
Mitigating circumstances- the kidnap of his son; Rogers' surrender and return to custody at the earliest possible time= Not Guilty
Another thing. Did you work out how Sin got into your dad's old mansion to get those photos? She may not be manipulating you any more, and I know Strange says Faustus won't be able to influence you again, but what's to say she won't show up and attack you again at home? Please be careful. Let Peter stop a bit longer. He's pretty handy when it comes to a fight. Also, he makes good cookies and terrible jokes.
Why do I like Spiderman? Well I guess because he has sort of been paying out rent the last couple months. I've sold quite a few pictures of him to the Daily Bugle, enough that Mr Jamerson has me on the books as a Freelancer. The money isn't fantastic, but it keeps the heating on.
Be careful out there alright? Ultron really didn't seem to like you...you might be the one he tries to take out the most. Are you sure it is even safe for me to send this? I know you send it was a secure feed, but without Jarvis...
Steve is pretty worried about this Spiderman. It seems like they didn’t talk much before he got scared and ran off. I say he, Cap is suspicious it’s a girl in disguise. Apparently he/she is pretty young and, from the sounds of things, looking for one crook in particular. Promise me you won’t get caught up in some sort of revenge trip, okay?
I don't know if you remember her, but my Mother used to work for you. Years ago, on something called the Ultron project? I think she quit after you two spent the night together, and I guess she decided to hide the pregnancy. I don't know details really....the only reason I know anything is because I found some letter she wrote you. I guess she never sent it. I suppose I could have sent it along with this, but it got a little water damaged (Our basement flooded).
Steve started to laugh.  "That was terrible."  He caught Tony's lips for a kiss.  "Your own stripes?  You didn't mean to say that one out loud, did you?"
“Whatever you’re thinking, don’t.”  Tony was straddling his knees now, where he’d been working on Steve’s feet.  “You’ve gone tense again.”
As he stood at the edge of chaos waiting for the scene to be cleared, an entirely different threat appeared… a very angry Captain.
Steve smiled against Tony’s lips.  “Yes, I am.”  He dropped a kiss along Tony’s ear.  “And you’re mine.”
“We should make sure the rest of the team knows that rule,” Tony said when they broke apart.  “But…”
“I’m unsatisfied right now,” Tony murmured.  “You are emoting instead of fucking me, Steve.  This is unacceptable.  Make with the sexy times, Captain.”
“Yeah.”  Fury sat back now, regarding him over steepled fingers.  “I know he’s a pain in the ass to work with – insubordinate arrogant asshole that he is – but you’ve got him following orders and – hell, I got a report that he actually checked himself into Medical when he got injured after that last skirmish.”  The director smirked.  “What’s your secret?”
Their exit was tracked by curious eyes and obtrusive cameras – but neither man paid any attention.  Their relationship wasn’t a secret.  They had nothing to be ashamed of.  And for every article screaming about the corruption of Captain America by Iron Man… there was one celebrating their bravery in coming out.
“Jackass.”  Steve rolled abruptly, pinning Tony down on the bed.  “You could try making me hold off.  Not sure how effective that would be –”
“Oh, please.”  She rolled her eyes.  “Pet names and public affection aren’t you, Tony.  What’s the game here, what’s your angle?”
Tony smiled and kissed him again before tugging away.  “Anytime.”  He retrieved the damp but now cold towel and wiped them both off.  For a heart-stopping moment, Steve was afraid he was going to leave – but Tony merely deposited the used towels in the hamper in the bathroom before crawling into the bed.  Though they’d only slept in a bed together once, there was no awkwardness.  Steve held open his arms and Tony nestled into them as though they’d done it for years.
Tony groaned and thumped his forehead against Steve’s shoulder.  “No.”  He sighed.  “I’d kill for a cheeseburger.”
Tony coughed.  “Alright.  Eight.  But you’ve got to maintain… we’ve still got that show to make it through.  Who knows, you could bomb miserably.”
“Another time,” Tony promised, pressing his hand to Steve’s chest.  “I don’t have the patience for it tonight.”  He kissed a trail up Steve’s neck before sinking into a long, tender kiss.  “I want to see your face when you’re inside me,” he whispered into Steve’s ear.  “Want to watch you lose yourself.”
Steve waited until the doors shut before he spoke again.  “How much of this retreat is the headache, and how much is emotional overload?”
“I sure as hell don’t.”  Tony shoved the magazine in his hand across the table towards Pepper.  “You promised no press, Potts.”
Thor pushed a bench close to him, then made a hand gesture that Steve interpreted as giving them time – or quiet.  Steve sank onto the bench, cradling Tony against him.  His lover was shivering still, but after ten minutes of silent comfort, Tony regained some composure.
Steve nuzzled into Tony’s neck, kissing the dark spot he’d left earlier.  “Love you too.”  He hummed contentedly.
Steve let his weight press down on Tony – not enough to hurt, but enough to feel.  He pressed his face into Tony’s neck, breathing deeply.  “Promise me you’ll tell me if… that changes?  If I’m not… enough?”
He made his way down from the workshop at the three hour mark.  That was sufficient for the rest of the team to have settled into their own coping mechanisms.  (Tony didn’t ask, and he’d never tell.)  It meant the gym was empty save for Steve, and likely to remain so.
Steve’s cheeks heated.  “You’re in mine.”  He stepped closer to Tony, touching his finger to the blue suit fabric, immaculate white shirt, and red pocket square.  “I think I like it.”  He leaned in to press a kiss to Tony’s lips.
“Mmmhmm.”  Steve’s foot moved higher.  “Good thing there’s these nice long tablecloths, isn’t it?  I mean… some people might even select a restaurant based on that.”  He leaned over the table.  “And maybe the fact that the bathroom is nearby – and has a lock.”
“Mad super secret agent skills?” Tony suggested vaguely, but his attention was mostly on Steve, kissing his hand.  Every time he did something so overtly romantic, Tony fell a little bit more in love.  He’d never been wooed like this, not really.
Steve smiled slowly, and Tony felt a twitch in his cock.  The man was so damned attractive, it shouldn’t be allowed.  “There’s been a very serious breach of protocol while you were gone.”
"Ungh... that's... not what you say when we're.... in the field," Tony gasped, rolling his hips against Steve.
“You are a fucking troll,” Tony breathed, but didn’t object.  Steve worked him thoroughly and for all his protestations that he didn’t need another orgasm – less than five minutes later, he was spilling onto Steve’s hand, gasping for breath.
Well, if wearing this suit got Tony that hot… Steve would wear it a lot.  “I spent a lot of time getting’ it right, doll,” Steve deflected the wandering hands with another laugh.
Steve grinned, kissing him fiercely as he fumbled in the bedside table for lube.  “Can’t give you more than my everything, sweetheart.”  He returned to Tony’s side with slick fingers, nudging his way between Tony’s knees.  “Open up for me, gorgeous.”
“Here I thought I was subtle about it.”  Tony squirmed until he could press down on Steve’s fingers.
It was so close to the line – that line they didn’t cross, words they didn’t say.  Tony nodded slowly.  “I’ll try.  Genuinely, honestly, legitimately try,” he promised.  His hand stroked Steve’s face, brushed back his hair.  “You’re sexy as hell when you’re that mad, and you just gave me the ride of my life… but I don’t like seeing you this scared, baby.”
It was probably a good thing that no one else was in the communal kitchen upon his return to the Tower.  Steve’s foul mood only deepened as he thought about the implications of Fury’s comment.  Christ, it was no wonder Tony had such low self-esteem, if that was what Fury thought of him.
Tony briefly considered making a run for it – except that would likely only compound things.  He was vaguely aware of the rest of his teammates making themselves scarce – traitors.  He’d have to face the Captain’s wrath on his own, then.  Looking around, he tried to find a section of the semi-destroyed street that would give them at least a little privacy… because he didn’t particularly relish this conversation being filmed by passersby.
Happy pulled the car up finally and Steve opened the door, letting Tony climb in first before joining him.  He directed Happy to the theater and sat back, lacing his fingers in Tony’s.  “You okay, doll?”
“Sweetheart?”  Tony waited until they were on the dance floor, swaying together, before he broached the subject.  “What’s wrong?”  Steve just shook his head, not daring to speak.  “Look, I know I’m not great at this stuff but… if you tell me what I did wrong, I’ll try my damnedest to fix it.”
Tony groaned, twitching his hips to take Steve deeper.  It was an almost painful stretch – Steve wasn’t small and wasn’t being gentle – but it felt far too good to stop.  “Do it, Steve – take me.”  His hands latched on Steve’s shoulders for balance.  “Teach me a lesson.”
Despite his confusion, Tony’s orders were easy to follow.  Steve peeled off the remainder of his uniform and stretched out on his back on the bed, his hands folded behind his head.  To his surprise – and a little shame – he wasn’t even fully hard.  He didn’t think that had ever happened in this close proximity to an undersuit clad Tony… which only reiterated how damned shaken he was.
"Only up to thirty-two strokes," Steve teased, but he was hanging on by a thread.  "Gotta make sure you really appreciate your punishment."
The first time Steve had called him that, it had bothered Tony.  It didn’t anymore.  He felt a warm glow of pleasure instead, and repaid it by dragging his tongue in a circle around the head of Steve’s cock before taking it into his mouth – just the head, for now.  He closed his lips around it and sucked, reveling in Steve’s choked off groan.  God, he loved giving head – loved rendering his lovers inarticulate more, and Steve was the most responsive lover he ever remembered having.  Buoyed by the noises coming from the blond, Tony shifted again to loosen his throat, ready to attempt deep-throating tonight.  It wasn’t an everyday thing, not with a cock the size of Steve’s… but this was supposed to be therapeutic sex, right?  That should be cause for some special effort.
“I will be.”  Tony didn’t try to find his bravado – not at home.  Not with the team.  “I’m sorry you guys had to see – ”
Steve folded back the blankets first and picked Tony up, sliding them both under the covers.  “I’m glad you’re home.”
Steve managed to wait until Tony had found a tiny little building at the edge of the fight zone – somehow restrained himself until the inventor had secured the cameras and they were in no danger of inadvertently becoming PornHub stars – kept his cool while Tony stripped out of the undersuit.
“I know.”  Tony shifted a little, feeling Steve’s cock hard against him.  “But just because I’m not in the game doesn’t mean you can’t be.”
“Is that a threat or a promise?”  Tony squirmed again, rocking his hips against Steve’s.  “Already hard for me, aren’t you?”
“Hey,” Tony chuckled, ending the kiss.  “You don’t get to stop fucking me just because you’re a romantic sap, love.”  He rocked his hips enticingly, drawing a moan from Steve.  “You can do both – I know you can.”  His hands cupped Steve’s face, his eyes full of emotion.
Steve’s lips curved against Tony’s skin.  “Thank you following rule one so well, babydoll.”  He used his thumbs to stroke whatever skin he could reach without loosening his hold on Tony.  “Just because this all started with sex doesn’t mean that’s all I want from you.”
“What?”  Steve was partially distracted by the taste of Tony, the silken slide of skin against his tongue.
“I’m working on that,” Tony promised.  He rolled over as well, so that they were facing each other.  “I think we need new rules… we broke all the old ones to hell.”
Tony twined his arms around Steve’s shoulders.  “He doesn’t like people knowing.  Says they look at him different.”
"Fuck."  Tony rocked back against Steve's hand.  "You use this method of discipline on all your troops, Captain?"  He groaned as Steve thrust a second time, feeling a knuckle graze his prostate.
Once back in the penthouse, Tony shed his clothing on the way to the bathroom.  “I’m taking a bath,” he announced.  “And I’m really hoping you’ll join me.”
Steve shifted, tugging him closer.  “Yeah, sweetheart.  And no, I’m not asking you to tell me.  Rule two is great, but some things need time.”
Walking out of the restaurant and into the camera flashes was an experience.  Tony’d done it before – Steve looked a little surprised.  The solder recovered quickly.  Happy was three cars down in the pick-up line, so Steve pulled Tony a little aside to wait.  He didn’t look directly at any of the cameras, keeping his attention focused on Tony.  “How would you rate the date so far, doll?” Steve asked, brushing his fingers over Tony’s hair.
In answer, Steve rolled them over until Tony was pinned beneath him.  “No.  I know how you feel about conversations,” he teased, nipping at Tony’s neck.
“You’re a fucking troll.”  It came out less of an insult and more of a strangled moan as Tony rocked against Steve’s fingers.
Humming with satisfaction, Tony got his hands involved next, using the rough calluses on his fingertips to stroke Steve’s balls.  Then, realizing why Steve was holding the blankets hard enough to tear them, he pulled off and looked up the length of that supremely attractive torso.  “You can put your hands on my head, Cap – just don’t pull.  Don’t want me to get you too hard accidentally, yeah?”
“I know that,” Steve cut him off.  “Don’t mean I wouldn’t rather be there to stare ‘em down myself.  Even once I do put a ring on your finger… you’re irresistible, babydoll.  I can’t really blame ‘em for it.”  He grinned, using his hand to tip Tony’s face up to make eye contact.  “Think of it as payback to Pepper for insistin’ we go to ‘em.  Her choice – you not goin’, or us going and makin’ spectacles of ourselves.”
“I can be persuaded.”  Steve started to strip as well.  He’d thought Tony didn’t do baths – that’s what Rhodey had told him.  He wasn’t sure how to ask, though.  It didn’t seem smart to question an anxiety trigger… not when Tony was already coming off one panic attack.
“I am yours,” Steve laughed – but he understood.  There was something primal about it, seeing Tony dressed to match his own uniform.  “But doll, if we’re late – ”
“Yes.”  Steve looked down at their clasped hands.  “What was I supposed to think, Tony?  You’ve said since the beginning that this wasn’t – that there wasn’t to be any talking.”
“I don’t want it to get easier – I want it to stop.”  Steve would deny whole-heartedly that he was whining.
“As long as it takes,” Tony smirked.  He leaned closer and pressed a kiss to that perfect curve, making Steve shiver.  “You okay with this, sweetheart?”
Tony slipped a second finger into Steve, then a third.  It wasn’t really that Steve needed that much prep… but he never got enough of it, really.  His lover was so responsive that Tony wanted to tease him all night… and his refractory period was so short that Tony never worried about cutting the fun short.  With that in mind, he doubled down, taking Steve to the root while he pumped his fingers, finding the small nodule of his prostate and trying to grin around the cock in his mouth as Steve wailed and tried not to buck against him.  He pulled off just long enough to say, “I want to taste you,” before sucking him back down, working his tongue along the underside of Steve’s cock feverishly.
Tony hummed contentedly and settled against Steve.  The show was good – Tony wound up tapping his feet to the music more than once.  They joined the standing ovation, beaming up at the cast with genuine appreciation.  As people began to file out of the theater, a staff member approached them.  “Sirs?”
Steve sat down hard on the edge of the tub.  “Okay.  Right.”  He blinked several times.  “Okay.  Shit.”
As they left the gym, Tony threw a look over his shoulder at the punching bag.  “Well, Rogers?  What’s the verdict?  You rather bang the bag, or me?”
That hurt too.  “So… you just decided to come out to the paparazzi, tank SI’s stock, put the Avengers in the news as some sort of gay cult, and… neglect to tell me?”
He continued the massage with a thoroughness that would surprise anyone except Pepper – since that’s who he’d learned for.  Mechanics had strong hands and they served him well.  By the time both towels were cool enough to be uncomfortable, Steve was a boneless puddle of goo beneath his hands – just as Tony had intended.
“You’ve got me, baby.”  Tony tugged Steve closer, finding the bottle of lube and wetting his own fingers.  “Budge up, let me in there.”
Tony raised an eyebrow.  “Not about this, not later.  But if you’re eaten up by something so bad you can’t stay relaxed during a Stark Special Massage…”
Steve noticed he hadn’t mentioned Bruce… the scientist’s reluctance to whole-heartedly support their relationship bothered Tony more than the engineer wanted to admit – and he wanted to distract his lover before he could get upset again.  “Did you catch this morning’s tune?” Steve whispered in Tony’s ear.  “He stopped so fast you might have missed it.”  He hummed a few bars, very softly, of ‘Going to the Chapel.’
Outwardly, little of their relationship had changed – although their teammates had noticed that Tony was sleeping and eating at more regular intervals.  Tony knew that Steve wanted to tell them – but Tony was struggling with rule two.  Openness was frightening… and Tony was terrified of being rejected by his teammates.
Once Tony was assured he wasn’t going to startle a PTSD flashback out of his lover, he stepped up behind Steve and pressed his own sweats-and-t-shirt covered body into the firm back.  “Liar.”  He placed one hand in the middle of Steve’s chest and let the other slide down his stomach to the waistband of his sweats.
It had been two weeks without any fighting – no missions to speak with, even for Clint and Nat.  (They ostensibly were still SHIELD agents and could get called up on occasion.)
“Okay.”  Tony tugged him towards a couch and pushed him onto it.  He settled next to the supersoldier and pulled out his phone.  Steve looked at him blankly.  “What?”  Tony felt his cheeks heat.  “Did you think I was going to leave you here alone?  Jesus, Steve, if somebody isn’t here to make you sit down you’re going to cause heart palpitations in the staff, marching around in here in that uniform.”
Rolling his eyes, Rhodey nodded.  “Fine.  Partner.”  For all his apparent irritation, there was a smile lurking.  “Now, if you’re done being an overdramatic ass, I’ve got a meeting with a General in – ” he glanced at his bedside table, “ – less than six hours.  Can I get some sleep, please?”
A second finger joined the first, making Tony groan.  Steve took his time opening him up – steady pressure with his fingers combined with one spectacular blow-job.  Tony was nearly as hard now as he’d been when they’d started.  “You ready?” Steve asked, pulling his lips off Tony’s cock and looking up at him.
Steve tipped his head further and nipped at Tony’s neck.  “Should make you run for it and catch you – go for the hat trick.”
They stepped out of the doors hand-in-hand, though Tony felt juvenile doing it.  He just wasn’t ready to let go of Steve yet.
"Your uniform should be fucking illegal," Tony groaned, dropping his head forward onto Steve's shoulder for a moment before shifting to seize Steve in a fierce kiss.  It was desperate and possessive, and spoke of emotions that neither of them would voice.  "Goddamn it, Steve, did you have to fucking crouch there like that?"  Steve had been bent over a captive for a good ten minutes interrogating him before releasing the man to SHIELD custody -- long enough to give everyone a very thorough view of that glorious ass.
Steve lost track of time entirely.  Nothing existed outside his bedroom – hell, even beyond the bed.  All his focus was on Tony, and the incredible touches of his hands.  This wasn’t sexual, but it was intensely intimate.  Steve was drowning in sensation, swamped with – yes, damn it, with love.  He knew he couldn’t ever say it, but that’s what this was, and –
“Bullshit.”  Movements fluid and languorous, Steve slipped off Tony and grasped his cock with one large hand.  “Lie back and think of SHIELD.”
“The answer to that question is never going to be no.”  Before Steve could move, though, Tony bent to kiss him again.  “You still okay?  Not too rough?”
“No, but you beg real pretty when I go slow.”  Steve shifted his lips back to Tony’s neck, nibbling there.  He edged lower so that he could leave a mark – biting and sucking until a nice purple circle remained.  All the while he was probing with two thick fingers, searching for that spot that would make Tony arch up into him.
“No.”  He really, really wanted Tony to stay.  He just wanted it for different reasons that Tony was willing to give.  Steve dropped down onto the bed, still wearing his uniform from ankles to hips.
A quick search of his eyes, and Steve nodded – before resuming his almost brutal pace.  Tony cried out, his eyes rolling back.  Steve didn’t stop, pounding all his frustration and desperation into Tony, clinging hard to him and whimpering himself as he raced toward orgasm.
Steve had to clear his throat before he could continue.  “Stevie,” he whispered into Tony’s ear.  “And – and punk.”
“Any time.”  Steve started to work at Tony’s clothes – more complicated than his own, but he managed.  He had to duck to allow Tony to tug his undershirt off over his head, but it was worth it when he could finally press their bare chests together.  He was always surprised that the arc reactor was skin temperature – somehow he expected it to be icy to match the blue, or warm to match the power.  Steve slid his hands down Tony’s sides.  “What do you want tonight, sweetheart?”
Tony was done waiting.  He rolled his hips and forced himself onto Steve’s cock, moaning as the head crested that first right of muscle.  “More,” he demanded, his arms coming up around Steve.  His hands pressed flat to the back of Steve’s shoulders.  “God, Steve – I want more.”  He wriggled, trying to force Steve’s cock deeper.
“Fucking troll.”  Tony put a hand in the small of Steve’s back to balance himself.  “If you can still think straight while I’m fucking you, I’m not doing it right.”
Steve tugged his hands free and rose to pace.  “Can you just… not.”  He rubbed at his face.  “I can’t pretend anymore, Tony.”
Steve laughed.  “Alright, I yield.”  He leaned up to press a kiss to those maddening lips.  “Not in the bath though, alright?  Let’s get clean and then go to bed.”  Shower – or bath – sex sounded fun, but in reality there were usually banged elbows and cold drafts.
The supersoldier parried most of them easily.  Their fights were never really about brute strength – when Tony won, it was by tactical advantage.  Or because Steve wanted to be pressed into the mat by a sweaty Tony… thoughts of which distracted Steve long enough for Tony to land a hit to his face.
Steve nuzzled the back of his neck.  “I know you don’t.  But I’m hoping you allow me the privilege of keeping you safe.  Not because you can’t do it yourself… but because you trust me to do it.”
Eventually they got their breath back – though it wouldn’t have taken as long, if they’d been able to stand to stop kissing.  Steve pulled away carefully, feeling his come immediately start to leak out of Tony.  “You want a shower, or just a wipe down?” Steve asked, slipping off the bed.
The elevator stopped on the communal floor, but the doors didn’t immediately open.  Tony’s eyes flickered to the sensors again when he pulled away from Steve.  “Thanks, J.”
Tony felt a surge of arousal.  “I can do that.”  He bit down harder on the flesh of Steve’s shoulder, grinning when he felt the blond shudder.  “Let’s go inside,” he said, glancing around at the landing platform.  “We’ll go crazy and actually use the bed.”
They stood there, panting, several minutes before Tony started to chuckle.  “God, we’re a mess.”  He carefully pulled off Steve, hiding a wince.
Tony settled more comfortably against Steve, his back nestled against Steve’s firm pecs.  “Next fight, I expect you to take me hard up against the wall.”
“Holyfuckingshit,” Steve gasped.  His hands clenched in the fabric of the bedsheets, scrabbling and desperate.
Steve nipped at Tony's lower lip before kissing him again, sweeter now.  "Maybe I like you being the sassy, bratty thing you are.  That ever occur to you?"  He leaned on one arm so that he could stroke Tony's face -- just once.  At the slight flinch, he rolled off Tony and reached into another pocket for a packet of wet wipes.  He extracted one for himself and tossed the packet to Tony.
“Thought you’d never ask.”  Grinning like a fool, Steve brought Tony’s hand up to his mouth and kissed it.
"I think we both win."  Steve kind of wanted to collapse there and get some sleep, but... "Please tell me you disabled the cameras in this alley before -- "
Steve looked up – their teammates were sitting on the mats about twenty feet away… trying not to watch them.  “They looked worried about you, love.”
“You,” Tony answered automatically.  It was a familiar refrain.  “It’s always you.”  He leaned forward to rest his head on Steve’s stomach – which was ordinarily an erotic position for them, but at the moment was just comfortable.  For all their ardor in the elevator, it was these moments of casual intimacy that punched Tony in the gut.
Steve kissed him then, slowly and tenderly.  “We need to call Jim,” he murmured.  “You won’t really relax until you’ve talked to him.”
Once they were both clean, Tony tugged imperiously at Steve’s hand under the supersoldier followed him to the bed.  Tony nudged him onto his back.  “My turn to lay claim,” Tony murmured.  He found the lube – one of far too many bottles stashed in the penthouse – and slicked up his fingers.  “That alright, sugar?”
Steve blew out a long breath.  “No, I knew how to handle the Blitz,” he muttered to himself – but quiet enough not to disturb his partner.  “Is everyone going?”  He fumbled with his shirt buttons, not sure he liked this style… but he hadn’t picked it himself.  Everything from his socks to his tie had been selected by Pepper and Tony’s tailor… it reminded him of being in boot camp again, wearing only what he was given.  At least these fabrics were softer.
“You wanna roll over, and I’ll get your pecs?” Tony suggested, kissing behind Steve’s ear as he whispered the question.  Despite his normally brash natural, Tony hadn’t risen above a loud whisper since they’d started.
“You sure?”  This time there was humor in Tony’s tone, and Steve shot him an outraged look over his shoulder.  “I’m just checking, sweetheart.”  Resettling, Tony removed his fingers and used just his tongue, working the flexible muscle all around Steve’s hole.  He felt the faint tremors as Steve tried to hold still and was unable to – felt him rock back against Tony’s tongue and moan, low and aching.
Rhodey nodded once then.  “Alright.  Yes, I see you squirming, Tony, I’ll stop threatening your boyf—”
Tony pulled back to meet his eyes, just for a moment.  “Alright.”  He kissed Steve’s lips – slow and unhurried.  “You don’t have to make it sound like a chore, Steve.”
“I kind of meant more for tolerating my spontaneity than for the orgasm,” Tony admitted.  He nuzzled into Steve, stealing just a few more minutes.
“Time to face the music, I guess.”  Tony pried himself off Steve – though he really just wanted to curl back up and take a nap, safe in supersoldier arms.  “This isn’t how I envisioned rule two playing out.”
“You’re more beautiful than that.”  Steve kissed him again before pulling away, shooting Pepper a hard look as he passed.  He didn’t like her proprietary air towards Tony – and he was already wary that she’d upset his lover.
Steve grabbed his cock with his slick hand and positioned himself carefully, then let gravity ease Tony down onto him.  “Fuck,” he breathed as Tony slid onto him, feeling the intense heat.  “Goddamn, you always feel like coming home.”
“It’s just – it’s not my own reputation at risk, here.  It’s yours, Steve – and the Avengers.”  Tony shivered a little.  “I’m not sure I want to know what they’re going to say about… about two…”
Steve understood the fear.  He didn’t like it – and he’d be a lot more comfortable when the team knew – but he also was aware of how quickly Tony would shut down, if he were pushed too hard.  Still… with all the downtime, it was frustrating not to be able to just pull Tony onto his lap during movie night.
Fair point, Steve reflected as he slicked up his cock, but he was game for a challenge.  "Winner picks the movie tonight?"
“Yes, damn it!”  Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips, pulling him closer.  “God, just fuck me already.”
“Oh.”  Tony blinked.  “I… suppose you aren’t used to being objectified, are you.”  It wasn’t a question, and Tony sounded very sad.  “It gets easier.”
“I can’t guess,” Steve said, sitting up enough to let Tony strip off his shirt, taking his own off at the same time.
“God, yes,” Steve breathed.  He leaned in and nipped at Tony’s lips, moaning at the touch of their tongues together.  “So lucky to have you, doll,” Steve whispered between kisses.
He laughed again.  Loving Tony hadn’t made the sex any less fun – it had just added dimension to it.  “We’ll get there, sweetheart.  Want to make sure you’re nice and loose for me.”  Steve carefully worked a third finger into Tony, twisting just right to send the engineer even higher.
Steve lined up his cock and pushed in – slowly, so as not to hurt Tony.  They were both panting by the time he bottomed out.  He propped himself up over Tony and leaned down for a kiss.  “Better?”
“I know damned well what fucked out Tony looks like, and I know what in love Tony looks like, thank you,” Rhodey said drily.  “Maybe she can’t tell the difference – hell, maybe she didn’t realize you two were knocking boots, which… well, she can be awfully blind where you’re concerned, Tones.”
Steve slicked up his fingers and smirked.  "To fuck you?  Yeah."  He pushed his fingers back into Tony.  "Never know when the opportunity will... arise."
Tears spilled out as Tony nodded, unable to speak.  He met Steve’s kisses, his hands flat on the broad expanse of the supersoldier’s back, his legs curling around Steve’s thighs.  “I do,” he whispered back.  “Love you back, I mean.”
Realization dawned in Tony’s eyes.  “Christ.  Okay.  Yeah.”  And despite a paralytic allergy to emotions, Tony tugged Steve in for a hug.  “He’s gonna be fine, Steve.”
“Miss what?”  Tony was distracted by the acres of glorious skin, running his hands up and down Steve’s chest.
“You’ll want to handle this one personally,” Steve promised.  He stepped closer to Tony.  “I’m afraid I drank all the coffee in your workshop.”
“It’s my responsibility,” Steve whispered.  The hands he had around Tony shifted so that he could slip one hand under the hem of the undershirt, stroke the soft skin of Tony’s lower back.
“You can’t seriously think this is a good idea,” Tony said flatly, staring at Pepper.  “This is – this is a monumentally bad idea.  This is – fuck, this is Spring Break ’92 levels of bad idea, Pep.”
"God, that was so lame, Rogers."  It might have sounded more like an insult if Tony hadn't been breathless and grinding back on Steve's fingers.  "Okay, lubed up, come on.  Opening act is over, I need the main event."
That was apparently the wrong thing to say, because Steve outright growled.  “You are not expendable, Tony!”
Tony nuzzled into Steve’s hand, letting his eyes flutter shut.  It was several long minutes before he answered, but Steve didn’t rush him.  “I don’t want to be the person making you into a dancing monkey again.”  Steve blinked once and opened his mouth, but Tony shook his head.  “You hate it.  I know you hate it.  I… I can’t avoid the press, I’ve never been able to, but I want to keep you out of it, keep you… safe.”
Tony rolled his hips, forcing Steve’s fingers deeper into him.  “Yeah?”  He meant to sound challenging but the breathy quality to his voice kind of ruined the attitude.  “Prove it, soldier.”
In answer, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and pulled his close.  He wished he had the energy to kiss him, but all Steve wanted to do was rest his head against Tony’s chest, right next to the arc reactor.
“No.”  Steve tried to pull away, but Tony wouldn’t let him.  “I know how you feel about conversations, Tony.  I’m not going to push.”
Steve’s hand clenched in Tony’s hair.  “I’m gonna – ”  He didn’t even get a chance to finish his warning, spilling his come into Tony’s eager mouth.  Tony drank it all, lapping up every spilled drop even as his fingers picked up in speed.  Steve wouldn’t be too sensitive to continue for at least another orgasm… and Tony intended to be inside him for that one.
“Yeah.”  Tony nestled his head against Steve’s shoulder.  “Me too.”  He couldn’t quite settle – couldn’t quite believe there wasn’t going to be a big discussion.
“Yeah… my help.”  Steve leaned in and kissed him, a slow and soft brush of their lips.  “After we’d – celebrated – I realized I wasn’t ready to walk away.  Didn’t want to go back to my room and shower alone, or grab a bite with the team.  I wanted to hang out with you.”  He brushed his hand over Tony’s hair, across his cheek.

Honestly I'm not sure how many of them really believe in the cause, and how many just want to get their voting numbers up. Not that it really matters why they are there, as long as they vote for my side when it comes too it.
You really can get internet anywhere on this thing, even a cave in. I take back everything I said about phone internet.
And Steve would be fine without a war, as long as there was still people to save from burning buildings or whatever.
As for Oscorp, I don't know. I've been friends with Harry Osborn since I was five, I've only known about you a month :P
As to the clone, is it alive? Does it feel? Does it know it's alive? If not, destroy it. You have to destroy it. You should never have made it to begin with! You say Thor is the strongest but he's the only one of us who is dead! We would have dealt with any threats the same way we always did, as a team. But no, you had to go digging up our friend's grave, and using his memory for your own agenda!
Aunt May is feeling better by the way, but she doesn't want to stay here any more. She is going to stay with Aunt June for a while until the house is 'safe'. Aunt June lives in Florida so it'll be a nice holiday for her.
Steve Rogers, on the other hand, is growing on me. This is something I only recently realised so I’m trusting you to keep it on the down low, but Captain America is very much a character for that guy. He only wanted to help his country, he never wanted to be a symbol. I think he takes it way too seriously, honestly. He’s the kind of guy that likes to take everything on his shoulders and then angsts like a teenager about it, but in the ‘I’m trying so hard to hide my pain’ way that makes you just want to punch him in the face. That said, he is also a sarcastic
I do think getting more avengers would be a good idea though. When we were setting things up for the registration act, there was an idea bounced around about maybe setting up an official team in each state. When all the fighting started it sort of got put on the back burner, but maybe we could look at getting it set up again.
Loki was the one who hung up my phone, he came to see and said he didn't want you interrupt. I did tell him off for hanging up on you without asking me, I guess he was worried if you spoke to me first you'd give your version of things and I wouldn't listen to him.
As for the suite, it’s yours as long as you want it. Steve didn’t stay there long; he went off to Washington for a while and I converted them to guest rooms then. I didn’t want to change it back when he came back to New York, so he’s staying on one of the upper floors now.
But you're right, let's not talk about it. I guess I always kind of thought I'd like to name my son after Bucky. I mean, he was like a brother to me... His given name was James. And for a girl, I guess I'd have to suggest Sarah, after my mom. But you know, I'm not going to really fight for it. It's your kid too and there might be people in your life you want to remember. You must have some ideas.
Plus you know. I HAVE SUPER STRENGTH!!! You don't need to wrap my in cotton wool, I can take care of myself!
Today is the last of the daily updates! From now on we will be sticking to a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule :)
If it's tied to your emotions, maybe you should stop worrying about being a monster, huh? Because I promise you you're not.
As far as I know, Flame boy is stable. I think people forget that when he isn't on fire, he is basically just a normal guy. He'll probably be up and around in no time, but Sue is freaked out. I think she is getting some extra security for the kids, though I doubt anyone would be stupid enough to try anything.
Didn't the super solider serum give Cap like a super metabolism or something? I bet he could eat icecream all day and night and not get fat. That must be nice... What is his favourite flavour?
I'm not really sure what I want, but I would like some sort of relationship. You know I'm 16 right? Not 5, there isn't really a lot you could do to mess me up at this point, I'm pretty much fully formed.
Yeah, yeah, super strength, I DON’T CARE. Did you miss how many of us Loki almost took out last time? You have no real experience, and you’re on your own. You’d be dead in 30 seconds if it suited him.
It looked to us like Loki had been using the basement. That’s what he said, anyway, and we found bedding and stuff rolled up in a corner. I wouldn’t put it past the creepy little dude to have been perving though, in which case, yes, it is totally justified to remove his eyes with kitchen utensils. Excuse me for pointing this out, but he must have been in your room sometime to find your letters. So yeah, go ahead with the maiming. Also, showers with multiple heads are amazing and you are a poor underprivileged girl to have never tried one before.
I'll try and get the trials re-started, but I sort of handed over a lot of my power when I did the whole run-away-with-the-baby-to-canada thing. I think they might be worried if too many super hero trials go on at once, they won't have the resources to make sure no one escapes...
P.S You sent Spiderman? Really? Is he old enough to drink himself?! You are lucky his Aunt's Chicken soup is so good...
I also looked up the Ultron project. It was something I started while my Dad was still calling the shots, automaton soldiers and guards. To be honest, it was more about seeing if we could- I was building on what I’d already done with the robot arms, to see if we could form an independently operating body. It got shelved when I took over the business and had more important stuff to focus on, especially as we hadn’t made much progress. It seems to have some potential though, I might go back to it. So thanks for reminding me, I guess.
You know what really gets me, though? The nurses called and said they'd even been turning up trying to interview Peggy. She barely even remembers who I am!
I was studying with Harry and this guy with a green mask burst through the window. He threw some kind of weird gas bomb at us, and I guess it was knock out gas because I started to get really dizzy. Anyway when he went to grab me I kicked him really hard in the face...but I guess it was too hard because he went flying back through the window. Luckily he had this glider thing so he didn't fall to his death, but Harry was still conscious and when we got outside he asked me how the hell I did that and...I sort of told him I was spiderman.
Be careful while we’re gone and watch out for Osbourne. And Loki. And supervillains in general. And you know, the dangers of drugs and smoking and forest fires or whatever. In fact, just watch out for everything. Probably best.
So basically what you were saying in your last letter is that you do have a crush on Steve. Well, sorry, but you’re not going to stand a chance against apple pie. I think he might have someone anyway. You know, all super-secret and whatever to protect them, blah blah.
Hopefully the other stuff will die away if we show the world it was Sin manipulating the evidence and making me out to be a scoundrel. Who knows, we might even be able to get a re-vote on the act one day if the court rules people were unfairly influenced... ha. I can dream, right?
Plus didn't all the research at the base get deleted? Osbourne would have been starting from square one if he'd managed to keep Wanda hostage.
If you wake up to see this, I'll be in the shower. The two-broken-legs thing means it takes a bit of doing.
Whether it was Nazis, mad men, or enemies home-grown, a cell has never been made that could hold Captain America; a fact that could not have escaped the authorities when the super-soldier surrendered to them last week. One would be forgiven for thinking that as he chose to be there, the Captain intended to stay put, but it has become clear that this is not the case. Last night, after a disastrous first day on trial, Steve Rogers
So who is the lucky man? Experts suggest that Mrs Stark can only be a few months pregnant at most, which means the child was conceived weeks after her thuggish husband walked out on her for a fool's errand. Speculation has been running wild as to the identity of the father, but maybe people are favouring a surprise contender- Master Peter Parker, aka 'Spiderman'.
My team wants to fight you. I don't know what I can say that would justify stopping them, except that when they say they won't kill anyone that's what you said too. I know you didn't mean it to happen.
Would you mind if I invited him to the party on Saturday? He could probably use cheering up, and I sort of want to stay on his good side.
Don't worry though, I've upped security everywhere. Plus Jessica Jones has been poping over with Danielle as protection/ for play dates (though they are less 'play' and move 'lay next to each other and wiggle around' dates). Apparently she used to live on the same street as Peter before her parents died. Small world huh?
It felt a little rude to make notes on my Mom's work. In the end I couldn't bring myself to mark directly on the page...so I scanned it and then made a couple notes.
I feel like you are trying to imply I'm missing something....are you seeing someone else or something?
Nat's gone to some Shield base, Clint's wife (apparently he has one) just had another baby (he has plenty of them) so he's taking some leave time (who knew Shield gave holiday time?) on his farm (so apparently he has one of those too). And Steve is still acting weird. He freezes up whenever I come near. It's starting to get annoying.
I can't believe you dyed your hair. How long is that going to last? I quite enjoyed the whole secret hook-up thing. We should do it again sometime.
Do you have to keep fighting this? The law is in place...you going to jail won't change anything. Please...just come home to me, to our son...I don't want him to see you behind bars.
As much as I know this isn't going to help my case, the reason I know that Loki is in Asgard is because he text me.
This is simply the latest evidence of what psychologists are calling Rogers' disguised misogyny. Laura Atkins says 'We already knew that Cap doesn't respect women- it's really no surprise that he wouldn't hesitate to use violence against them. I'm just disgusted to think that such a person is still being called a hero.'
Take it down a notch Lady Liberty. I haven't been answering my phone because I've been busy in the lab trying to work out a way to find our son.
“Ooh yes, a movie marathon when we all have wicked food coma’s!” Clint said, taking a handful of popcorn, “Love Actually, Valentine’s Day, The Lorax, The Giver.”
Clint groaned, whether that was a reaction towards what FRIDAY had said, or because he was picking out un-popped kernels of popcorn, Natasha didn’t care. “So that’s two out.”
Groaning, Tony swallowed his pride and knocked on the door, teeth chattering as he swayed on the balls of his feet.
that’s what Steve was doing. Only Steve would think of setting a place up for his friends whilst they were off having fun. He was a goddamn dork.
Steve nodded, not willing himself to speak. Tony hadn’t sounded angry or mocking, and Steve didn’t trust himself to pick out what other emotion Tony could be feeling. It gave him hope – and there was no place in his heart for that.
“And who are you to judge my clothing choices, Mr. I-Only-Own-The-Same-Three-T-Shirts-And-They’re-All-Two-Sizes-Too-Small?”
“This is the first quiet spot we’ve been too in the entire gardens.” Bruce commented absentmindedly, putting his phone away.
Tony was a laughing mess as they finished, playing at his hair in a futile attempt to clean it. “Aw man,” he breathed out, Steve collapsed onto the bench in laughter. “I’m gonna need another shower.”
“When it’s almost cooked," Steve said. "You want it to be warm and soft so the flavours infuse, but you don’t want them to go too soft that the spinach just kind of… shrivels up into nothingness and for the tomato to soften itself out of existence.”
From the depth to his eyes, to the gentleness in his expressions, to the kindness in his voice. He was breathtaking in his generous touch, to the intensity of his sincere honesty, to the way he held Tony, as though there was nothing in the world Steve would rather hold, would rather protect. Perhaps this is what people meant when they said Steve was chivalrous, that he was a gentleman. Not one of trite politeness, obligation, or duty, but of one with an incredible soul.
Dum-E looked up, his claw head quirked to the side. Without a second wasted, Tony plonked the hat on his head, the haphazardly drawn skull and cross bones a stark contrast against the white paper. “There, now you come with a warning label.”
She hummed, her heart rate dropping. “I could get you some Advil? It’s out the back. I’ve heard orange juice is good too – not that I, um, get hangovers or anything, I don’t – I don’t drink, but I’ve heard it’s common knowledge, so I guess you would know that already, but, well, it’s there.”
U knocked the table slightly in curiosity. “He’s sulking over there,” Tony waved his hand in Dum-E’s general direction. “You can go over if you want.”
Thor hummed in agreement.  They neared Trumps statue – or, where it was supposed to be.  “Is that a pumpkin in lieu of Trumps statue?” Steve asked, staring at the pumpkin in front of him.
“We can’t take the armour off of him Steve,” Clint said, he was looking at the suit with almost a critical gaze. “Would you even be able to sustain it?”
Tony buried his head into the crook of Steve’s neck. “Just an FYI, this is the best gift I could’ve asked for.”
Because that was part of Steve’s draw, he was the kind of man you wants to remember, the kind of man you could grow old with an say, ah, yes, he was a true love of mine.
“Getting ingredients for pancakes,” Steve said, placing the buttermilk in front of Tony. “Ready to crack these eggs and crack out these pancakes?”
Tony lunged for Steve’s wrist, spinning him around. “Do not break my door,” Tony said, and geez, that wasn’t the way to start this.
“I would have broken that door if you’d been any slower.” Steve said mid-sentence, before resuming his quiet narration.
The stalls themselves were selling a variety of goods that Tony hadn’t seen outside of the dreary supermarkets that were cool with indifference. Stalls with fresh fruit sat alongside stalls piled with fresh honey. The scent of fresh baked goods and unfamiliar spices filled the air, and Tony even spotted a corner stall that sold sausages, and only sausages. The gravel crunched under his shoes, and the wind that they were headfirst in earlier was blocked by the stalls, creating a nice, warm atmosphere.
Well really, it was only to fix some minor bugs that about ten people had complained about – apparently the browser app was too slow too respond. But still.
Tony flinched, swallowing again as he looked away. He opened his mouth, as if to say something, but then closed it quickly thinking better of it.
Tony swallowed, absorbing the praise. “It’s, it’s not really as big of a deal as you’re making it out to be. Because – well, for every one person who actually makes a complaint, another hundred people are experiencing it as well. So that’s at least 1200 people who can’t open their damn browser. It’s getting to the issue now, before it become an epidemic.”
“Right.” She paused, scanning the room for her water bottle. Whilst Natasha was probably the only one who actually used the dance studio, she preferred not to leave anything around.
“Yeah,” Tony breathed out, raking a hand through his hair to clear his thoughts. “Yeah, I’m finished.”
like that. It was too risky, their past to wrecked by pain. Steve was putting the eggs in a bag that just seemed to appear out of nowhere, oblivious to the interaction.
They worked in harmony, repairing Steve’s bike. For the first time in what felt like forever, the silence between them wasn’t stifling, but rather, it was comforting. They were both consumed in their own little projects, but aware enough of the other person to give a helping hand without being called upon or asked.. It had been so long, Tony had forgotten what it was like to just casually work on something with Steve, he missed it, he missed
Steve smiled softly, stroking Tony’s cheekbone with his thumb. “For years, Tony. Why do you think I have a sketchbook filled with drawings of you?”
was a welcoming smile. Tony swallowed nervously, of course the guy wasn’t comfortable with helping Tony out, they didn’t have the best track record.
“Which I agree with, but obviously I wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to cannibalise the eftpos machine.” The other girl, Riri, Tony assumed, said.
Tony stuck his hand out to shake hers, grateful for a moment that Steve was holding his left hand instead of his right. “Tony, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Steve gasped, before jolting away. “Oh God Tony I’m sorry,” he said before Tony had time to process what he’d heard, before he had time to even open his freakin eyes. “I didn’t realise you were awake.”
“Long enough,” Natasha said. She looked down at his hands and winced. They were mangled beyond recognition. Steve’s flesh was bruised and mattered, blood poking out through the rips and tears in his skin. “Come on, we’re cleaning this up.”
. They’re native along the Mississippi River, but particularly up north in area’s such as Wisconsin and Iowa.”
“With Natasha’s 40, and my 60, I believe that is 100 dollars from each of you.” Thor said with a grin.
Clint groaned, forking over ten. He looked over at Natasha. “Shout my coffee at the botanical gardens today and we’re even.”
“Oh,” the girl said. “Kamala called me in because the eftpos machine was broken, and Sam has been acting as my apprentice this weekend so I dragged him along.”
“Yeah." Tony put on a surprisingly accurate Bill Clinton imitation. “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”
“I should hope not,” she said and Tony only just noticed the hint of an accent in her voice, the playful tune in which she spoke. Tony couldn’t pick it exactly, it was soft, you had to be listening for it, but it almost seemed Turkish. “It’s not polite to keep an old woman wondering.”
“No, the snapped chain has pretty much loosened everything,” he said. “I’ll get onto repairing that and you can continue with this.”
“Hello friends!” Thor’s boisterous voice boomed through the speakers. “I trust all is going well in the cabin!” Ha, Tony was right, it was a cabin.
Tony was greeted with an unusual sight when entered the store, tripping over the ledge slightly. A boy with wild black hair sat on the counter, holding various electronic parts. A girl with a chaotic halo of tight curls was fiddling with the bigger machine those electronic parts were separated from. She was sporadically sipping from a juice box that was almost the size of her head. Kamala was giving a small boy a piggy back whilst another boy – with his back turned, was doing some sort of intricate coding on the decades old computer.
And Peter – Peter called him by his first name, Peter was prepared to joke and have fun with Tony, Peter, sweet wonderful Peter, who Tony had caused to die, and come back to life, who had been his rock after Siberia, and had helped him grow into someone he would be honoured for Peter to be proud of. Tony had always had that, regardless of anything else.
"The emergency services are on the other side of Manhattan, what other options are there?" Clint asked.
“Home-made baklava for my favourite centurian,” she said, sliding it into his bag. “Free, of course.”
Tony was about to respond when Steve returned, a bottle of juice in one hand, and a bag of flour in another. “Joan has started selling flour Tony!” He said, his eyes glittering in excitement. “We literally have everything you need.”
The door opened and Tony stumbled in rubbing the back of his neck. “Sorry I’m late, I got a bit… side tracked.”
the one who fixates and obsesses over it. Never mind the fact that no one else see’s you that way, none of us would care.
Natasha wondered how long it would take the rest of them to find out. She winked at Thor who smiled softly back. They could discuss it later.
Steve was leaning against a bench, his eyes glued to his phone. Huh, that wasn’t a sight Tony had ever expected. “Who knew old men could get a handle on decent technology,” Tony quipped as he walked in, swallowing his nerves.
“You love me.” Steve said, his voice betraying no emotion. Tony stared at Steve intently, Steve’s tone may have given nothing away, but his eyes were another thing. They were wide, consuming Tony whole. They were raving over Tony’s face, as if trying to find something.
“First time for everything,” Tony said, adjusting it counter clockwise until it was free of the clutch release. “Are there any other brackets keeping it in place?”
FRIDAY materialised on the sofa reserved for Tony and Steve, and snorted. “Obviously, and of course Doctor Banner.”
“Tony?” He croaked, his voice was coarse from a lack of use, he placed another hand on top of Tony’s leaning forward.
Tony gaped like a fish, opening and closing his mouth repetitively. Natasha blinked, it was almost as if she had broken him.
Whilst Steve was gone, the others took turns to make sure Tony was never alone. Natasha always stayed at the foot of the bed, eyeing both the door, and Tony.
“And stop saying you’re not good enough for people, I’ve never heard anything more ridiculous in my life.”
“Actually…” Bruce said, his eyes glued to his wallet as he fished out the notes. “The back door was unlocked the entire time.”
“Then you have nothing to lose. Everything stopping you, everything you have been overthinking and over analysing for three hours – is all in
Tony shrugged. “Dad went away a lot, when he was gone she was more comfortable around me. Sometimes she would give JARVIS the day off, and we would hole up in the kitchen together. We always ended up making Bruschetta – every time."
Steve looked as if his world had been turned on its head – which, Natasha judged, it probably had been. His eyes had grown wide, and were glued to Tony’s forehead. His spoon clattered into his bowl and was sinking into his forgotten porridge. Natasha would reprimand him if she didn’t have an inkling of what was running through Steve’s mind at that moment. He was shaking his head slightly, as if in awe, or as though he couldn’t quite believe it what he was thinking, what he had realised. It was most likely both.
