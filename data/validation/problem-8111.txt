The conversation died out a long time ago, most of his team dropping off to sleep, and Steve doesn’t want to disturb them of their forty winks just for entertainment. He sits back and watches the blurring foliage on the trees, and the yellow fields bereft of cattle or sheep that they pass. The road is uneven, and the truck jitters with each rock it hits. The potholes are the worst; every once in awhile, the truck bounces hard as a tire falls in, making the men inside fly a few feet and jostle their supplies.

Steve huffed a laugh. “Anything for you, Jerk,” he said before bumping shoulders with Bucky.

until the ambulance got there.”
Jarvis gives him a smile in return, his eyes brightening and crinkles appearing in the corners.
“A Mark is a patch of color on a person’s left wrist,” Jarvis explains, nodding down at the color in Anthony’s hand. “It helps a person find their soulmate.”
He looks over at the door on his right, that leads into the room where the doctor is talking to Momma and Howard. It’s open a crack, and if Anthony leans forward enough, he can just see the blonde curls that make up the back of his Momma’s head.
He can’t help the tiny flare of jealousy that sprouts up inside of him at the sight regardless. As much as Steve wishes for someone like that for himself, that person isn’t around yet, and Steve’s been waiting a long time already for his soulmate, that a few more years hardly makes a difference.
“I wouldn’t,” he tries before the words get tangled up. Then he tries again. “You don’t deserve to get a gray Mark because of me.”
“It’s okay, Peggy!” Steve quickly says, and it’s laughable. But he’s glad he’s spending his last moments reassuring her. “I’m glad. I really am.” He releases a soft breath. “I’m glad you’re not my soulmate.”
Huffing in grim amusement, Steve picks the table up off the ground and centers it a few feet in front of the bar and the exploded once-upright piano. He searches again through the wreckage, digging through ash and brick, raising dust into the air that would have once made him choke and cough, but now it just makes Steve grit his teeth against the taste in his mouth. He doesn’t stop until he finds a perfectly preserved chair. It receives the same treatment as the table; Steve cleans it off as best he can until he’s satisfied. Then he drags it over to the table and sets the small glass and the liquor bottle he found atop the surface of the table before he sits down.
Bucky’s face was crinkled in delight as he said, “Sarah and Granny would kill you if they knew you were sweet on an English gal.”

Bucky’s eyes widened, as big as dinner plates, and his mouth dropped open.
“Would you like a lollipop, sweetheart?” asks the receptionist, interrupting Anthony’s snooping. She’s about the same height as his mother, with reddish-brown hair, and dressed in a green dress. She smiles kindly down at Anthony, holding out a couple of different colored lollipops in her manicured hands.
Separate the man from the legend, Howard.”
Footsteps from behind snap Steve out of his reverie.
much!” Anthony cries, his smile big and bright.
Growing up in the tenements, he was surrounded by people, and the only thing they had in common was their heritage and the hope to build a better life in America. Aside from his Ma, he’d gotten all his education on their religion from the oldest member of the McDonald family that lived with them: Grandma Elizabeth. She’d been a feisty bitty lady with gray hair who sometimes spoke Gaelic and treated him no different from her own grandchildren. Steve’s mouth still waters at the memory of her delectable kerry cake. She had fed Steve’s love of good storytelling by reading passages of the Bible and telling him stories of each saint when he was stuck in bed.
“I know you didn’t, darling,” Aunt Pegs quietly reassures as she helps him step into his Captain America pajamas, because he was insistent that he wear them tonight. “It's nobody’s fault - these things just happen.”
Anthony feels cold.
I like her,” Steve said, heaving a heavy sigh. “There’s nothing
Leaning against the oak door, Tony’s head thunks against the hard surface before he lifts the heavy lids of his eyes. Forehead wrinkling in confusion, he blinks at the sight of his father’s furniture and desk pushed against the far wall opposite the door. This is
He hasn’t slept since.
Anthony nods his head, staring down at his toes, gripping his shirt tightly in his hands. “Howard Stark. He’s my father,” Anthony murmurs.
Tony stops fiddling with a circuit board at Rhodey’s desk. He blinks, then turns in the chair to look at him, screwdriver in hand. His best friend’s sprawled out on his twin-sized bed, studying one of the annoyingly large textbooks that he refuses to let Tony buy him to save the financial aid dollars.
“Your shield,” Anthony says, pointing to the metal disc behind him.
“Once upon a time,” Sarah began, and Steve tried stifling the cough building up in the back of his throat so he could listen. But his Ma was patient by nature and waited for him to get his breath back.
Anthony has to put a hand up to block the light and squints against it, distracting him from his mission with Cap to defeat Hydra Nazi bastards in the Z Dimension. He opens his mouth to complain, but the light’s gone again, leaving behind a dark spot wherever Anthony looks.
For a while, neither of them said anything. It was five minutes before Bucky took a deep breath and spoke again.
“Do you remember anything while you were under? Smells, tastes, sensations, etcetera,” she elaborates.
to be an expert, Howard!” Aunt Peggy exclaims, her eyes flashing dangerously, her arms uncrossing and her hands curled into rigid fists at her sides. “I admit, it’s hard to raise children on your own, especially with an organization to run on top of it! I try, and I make mistakes, but at least I

When the doctors inform them that Anthony can go home, it’s very dark outside and he’s sure that it’s way past his bedtime.

, or whatever the hell you want to call the stupid thing!” He rips the black soul band off his wrist - one of Howard’s gifts to him, he thinks distantly - and shows his best friend the pale empty stripe of skin.
“You both have soulmates!” Steve would shout. “What’s so wrong with waiting for them to come around?”
They’re all so determined, but even they see the impossibility of their situation ahead of them. They have no idea what comes next.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Peggy says, cutting right to the chase, her voice gentle.
Cap chuckles, a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes on his face. “Now how did you know that?” he asks, a gleam in his eyes.
The sunset is beautiful over the Atlantic, and Steve can’t help but take a moment to admire the swirls of orange and pink that streak across the sky. Even the icy wind blowing into the

There’s a knock at the door of his bedroom, and Anthony startles.
be sick, he thinks desperately as he tries to breathe through the pain.
“It’s so pretty,” he states.
“And guys,” Tony adds, his voice muffled against Rhodey’s shoulder.
He reaches inside and pulls out the Captain America action figure that throws its own shield.
Bucky had smiled and he was radiant with it. He shrugged. “Nah,” he said, as though it were nothing, and that was the best part about it all for Steve: that Bucky didn’t treat him any different. They stayed the same. “Sorry, Punk, but you’re stuck with me.”
Steve grips his glass of liquor tightly. He wishes he’d sent Bucky home instead.
Two days later Johnson died of infection.
Steve takes a walk. He leaves from the civilian entrance, the one that goes out onto one of the busiest streets of London. He’s expecting the cool air of the city and relishes it. But the minute he steps outside, the smell of burnt brick assaults his nose and the taste of gravelly ash coats his tongue.
Steve’s breath catches in his throat at the sudden memory of his mother. He closes his eyes tightly, the tears still flowing. Of
Jarvis holds his left arm out for Anthony to look at, and uses his other hand to pull one of the chairs closer to sit down next to him. Anthony wraps his small hands gently around Jarvis’s wrist, careful not to hurt him. He stares down at the swatch of green, with the same attention he gives his Cap comic books. It’s the shape and size of a quarter, just an inch below Jarvis’s palm. It looks like someone took a crayon to Jarvis’s wrist and completely filled in a circle, but it’s a neat swirl of color. Not wobbly, or even a little bit out of an invisible line. Perfect.
He feels the guy flinch beside him, and the hand immediately yanks away from his shoulder like he touched something hot - which, Tony’s vain enough to admit, isn’t a

of him. It doesn’t feel right that he shouldn’t tell people that.
Those are just empty words in a time of war.
He steps inside, going straight to the bar; the destruction around him is so familiar to him now that it’s almost soothing. He only has to move a few things that stand between him and his goal, his hands are stained black and gray from the dust by the end of it. Once he’s able to approach the bar, he looks through the collection of liquor. There are mostly shattered bottles, and pieces of glass on the ground behind the counter of the bar. He finds one bottle that’s intact, and when he dusts off the label to find out what it is, he discovers that it’s half-empty.
Tony feels less than merry and bright.
credit; he was capable of following through on giving Jarvis the modest funeral the old guy always wanted.
Steve clutches his head and bows it, curving his spine to lean over the small table.
And every time Steve thinks back on that conversation, he loves her fiercely for it. Every time he thinks about it, he sighs in relief. Because that small act of kindness made Steve realize the possibility that he could fall in love with Agent Carter. He probably would feel the same way even if she

time. The hug feels like how the Jarvises used to hug him, and God, that just hurts more.
Suddenly, there’s a soft warmth against Tony’s lips, and he distantly tastes something like vanilla before it’s gone.
Then Steve pours himself a drink.
“Soon,” Momma says.
Cap’s always sure of everything!! - his strong voice carrying easily in the empty room.
He’s assaulted by flashes of memories: Bucky giving him his first taste of stolen beer, and afterwards rubbing his back as he threw up the stuff in an alley ten blocks from his apartment. Bucky, coming home with dawn’s light, tossing Steve his expensive medicine, despite the fact that they hadn’t been able to afford it the day before. Bucky smiling crookedly at him while Steve drew him. Bucky flirting endlessly with the girls in their neighborhood. Granny McDonald smacking him so hard upside his head, Bucky’s dark hair fell over his eyes, making Steve laugh until he received the very same treatment. Bucky and him getting into a fight over something stupid. Steve in church drawing the windows while Bucky groaned and complained at his side. The two of them sneaking into a picture show. Both of them picking through garbage for enough money to get something sweet. Bucky and him strolling down the street, coming out of a fistfight and feeling elated and high from their victory. Bucky slinging an arm across his slim shoulders and pulling Steve into his side, like he belonged right there.
someone who understands
anybody.”
That’s been his biggest issue. He hasn’t been able to sleep properly in days. The cot is lumpy, his pillow is a rock and the blankets itch on his skin. The flat he and Bucky had shared in central London was by no means Buckingham Palace, but it was certainly better than the shack they shared back in Brooklyn; it was practically an exotic getaway compared to the tiny place they had before they even entered the war.
“James Rhodes,” he answers, smiling down at Tony, his eyes sparkling and Tony doesn’t think that’s because of the dingy lighting from above the sink. “I’d shake your hand, but you might puke on that too.”
Eventually the dumb doctors move Anthony into his very own brown hospital room where they leave him. But one of them wants to talk to Aunt Peggy privately, and so she has to go.
for making me laugh. The Blitz took place during 1940-1941, so it wouldn't have made sense that the bar in CA:TFA had been bombed since the movie takes place during and after 1943. Despite the history, I opted to follow movie canon.
It was blank too.
Through the charred wreckage, Steve slowly steps in the bare patches that are bereft of any pieces of crushed plaster, blackened brick, or splintered wood. He carefully lifts a fallen piece of wood out of his path, and it’s only when he has it in his hands that he catches the flash of a knob in the middle. He realizes the burnt, broken wood is actually a door. He can’t do anything except shove it aside; the blackened ash staining his red gloves as he pulls away.
This will be it, he thinks. He’ll be able to drink again, just like he used to with Bucky. He’ll be able to down this glass and feel drunk and stumble his way home. Bucky will catch sight of him at the door and shake his head at him, laughing; radiating warmth and delight--
and Markless to boot.

“Don’t you dare apologize,” she says sternly, but there are still traces of heartbreak in her voice. “I wouldn’t trade the time we had for the war. Now, no more tears, hm? You’ll make my mascara run.” She lets out a wet chuckle.
Steve adjusts his glove, brushing the place where his Mark should be as he does. It seems Steve is going to Hell no matter what kind of life he leads.
Thinking back on it now makes Steve feel little all over again.
Adrenaline spikes through his veins as he runs past Allied soldiers and members of Hydra alike; he’s hyper-aware of the fighting going on around him, but it’s nothing except flashes of movement in the periphery of his eyes. He doesn’t stop for breath unless he’s forced to, and it’s in those moments that he’s able to really see the soldiers that are turned into literal dust around him. He’s almost hit a few times, but it’s thanks to Howard’s shield that he’s been able to deflect the shots fired at and around him.

But then again, “finest moments” are in short supply when a grieving person decides to hit a party just after coming home from the funeral of his second father. Although Tony has to give Howard
"I promised Bruce I would go see him," he lied and walked away quickly enough that they wouldn't follow him, and slow enough that it didn't look like an escape.
It doesn't matter. Stark didn't have time to think about it. He may not have known all of the psychological nuances of being in a relationship. But he could easily see the impatience and worry in the eyes of the stranger. Another moment and Tony will lose the opportunity to change the date with his own hands for something much more...
Oh, here it comes, one of such questions.
"Barton, it's not like I don't want to," Tony whispered in a pained voice. "This is simply impossible. Even if I wanted to, I really can't help it."
The boy sighed, left his jacket and shoes as far away from their "guest" things as possible, and headed for his father's office. When he had the last corridor to pass, he heard something that made shivers ran down his back.
But on the other hand... No matter how you looked at it, Rogers firstly effectively overwhelmed Tony, and then pulled Happy out for a long ride.
"I thought Howard loved him very much."
Only after crossing almost the entire length of the corridor did he realize that Barton was running after him. They stopped, looked at each other, then laughed. It took them a good few minutes to recover from it.
Exactly. Idiocy. He really thought so. But he decided to take a look at the intercom before he sent the brats away with nothing. Very brutally and soullessly. Not that he wanted to appreciate their creativity. No. Well, maybe a little bit. Since he was a kid barely able to tie shoelaces (damn shoelaces, he always preferred Velcro), he was obsessed with guys in skintight costumes. Actually, he still liked them, but fortunately, he wasn't stupid enough to admit his weakness.
"If we belong to one team, can I call you by your name?"
"It is important that we have been looking for a suitable base for a long time. Because you will be one of us... your father proposed your mansion. I hope you understand our situation. It was too good an offer to reject."
"Even a few!" Tony announced throwing the bag carelessly (though cautiously, really) onto the mahogany desk and immediately ran to the exit. "I hope your superiors will like them. Please say Nick I said hi!" he shouted over his shoulder and jumped out of the office. He ignored Coulson's call. Tony knew it would piss him off; after all, he should not have the faintest idea of the existence of someone like Nicolas Fury.
"Tony, can't you even make a toast yourself, you just have to use Jarvis?"
"Tony, someone broke into your safe."
"Mr. Rogers."
Her boss didn't know either. It was all about his safe. Shit, a super-secret safe hidden in his private study next to the bedroom. A safe he wasn't afraid to joke about in public because he had programmed its lock himself and secured it with several passwords and a biometric code. Not only that, he changed all passwords every few days, and usually Pepper came up with one of them to absolutely exclude the option that someone would manage to break them. After all, it was not about money and jewelry, but about the unapproved projects of Stark Industries.  Those that were discontinued when the company switched production from weapons to ecological energy sources. Tony Stark may have behaved imprudently, but he took his safe extremely seriously. There was no chance that anyone...
"No, no, no! My beautiful huntress! What did they do to you! Barbarians! It's Cogniet!"
"I would suggest that you should leave the bathtub because the water has completely cooled down and you may catch a cold, sir."
The man turned out to be even more appetizing, which was why Tony very reluctantly looked away from him. If there was any deity of mechatronics and quantum physics, it was an extremely freakish deity and it definitely didn't deserve Stark to pray to it. Not that he would pray to anyone or anything, but if he ever felt like it, he would definitely choose a more sympathetic heavenly being.
They lay next to each other, kissed, brushed each other carefully. Tony didn't even notice when they were undressing (he just noticed that it was very difficult to unbutton a shirt with one hand), and then they were just in their underwear. Panting, he leaned closer to Steve, put his nose against his collarbone, and let him slip his knee between his thighs.
Tony knew he had hurt him. He saw it on Steve's wonderfully honest face. It was better that way. Stark preferred to hurt him now and draw a clear boundary between them than to give him the false conviction that they could become friends.
Stark groaned and covered himself tightly with the sheets. He didn't feel like keeping in touch with reality, not at all. In his dreams, he was still with Steve, tangling his fingers in his golden hair, looking for his reflection in Steve's blue eyes. He felt so good, so warm, so sweet. When was the last time he made love with someone so intensely to be sore the day after? He didn't even remember. Oh well, wait, it was probably that one time with the whole team of figure skaters. Although it was only possible that he only dreamed about it. Or completely intoxicated by alcohol, he imagined everything. It was really hard for him now to...
He glanced at his watch; it was only four PM. Maybe he could still find Bruce in the lab. Then (including the appearance of his new crush) he could count this day as a triumphant one.
The light came on automatically, wounding his eyes and squeezing a few tears out of them.
"Boss, are you all right?"
"The mutations have stopped, Master Stark. Atrial fibrillation as well. Adrenaline levels are still high. I noted contact with the voltage from the stun gun invented by you, sir."
Stark, not caring for anything, rushed to open. Damn, he didn't remember calling someone for the night. Maybe it was a gift from Pepper? Tony didn't suspect Rhodey of such kindness, though, who knows. Or was it the deity of mechatronics and quantum physics that finally decided to look at Tony with a kinder eye?
So in Steve's world, Tony only exists because he is the son of his father. Splendid.
Stark paid no attention to their quarrels, especially this particular one, which had lasted for almost a year. This is exactly from the day Tony was admitted to a world-class government educational institution, called SHIELD for some reason. Of course, it had to be an acronym, but it was apparently too secretive and confidential to be revealed to the average student, and Tony had not yet managed to figure it out (or, more humiliating, steal from the headmaster's computer).
"Mr. Howard asked that you see him," Happy said happily, opening the door for Tony, first car's, then to the mansion.
He holed up in his workshop, having the unpleasant feeling that those might be his last moments spent in it. Damn! He didn't plan it that way.
"Tony," Steve said frightfully loudly. "Look at me."
He very quickly tracked Clint, who, shooting the monster-Banner with a bow, tried to lure him out of school so that Coulson could thoroughly search the laboratory. So they still didn't realize that their opponent and its victim were one and the same person.
It was enough for him to force Barton to put his bow down, immobilize Banner and pour all of the pills into his green lips. At least Tony guessed it would work.
What would he say to him? "Gladly, but first you should know I'm only seventeen"? He didn't have any real experience in relationships, he couldn't even talk about such things. That's why he has never...
He must have been honest right now of all moments. He saw hope die in children's bright eyes and heard their disappointed sighs. Unfortunately, that was the truth. He didn't have a single candy at home. Even the sugar cubes were banned, he left only a stevia sweetener, but he couldn't suggest it to the kids. All because of Happy's diet. Tony decided that he would be a good friend and give up all sweets not to provoke his bodyguard. And now they both tricked themselves. Of course, Tony felt it much more, because the subtle pulsing in his crotch began to die painfully, when the wonderful soldier smiled apologetically and withdrew a few small steps, dragging sad children behind him.
"You're kidding me, right?"
Very interesting.
"Thank God for Coulson."
"You can't be nice to everyone," he finally said.
"Are you a villain, sir?" asked the toddler in silver-green tights.
"Pep, the phrase "scholarship, technical department, military section" seems quite unambiguous" sighed the boy. "It's not like I'm not against it, but it looks like Headmaster Coulson imagined "gadgets" differently than Tony."
"Yeah. That's because he tried to shoot me."
If his father said anything else, Tony didn't hear it. "At least his name isn't Clint," roared in his head as if it was any consolation.
"Hush," Tony silenced him. "We don't have to hurry, right? We can take small steps and see how it goes."
Pepper followed him into the kitchen without a word. Though she never opened her mouth, Tony knew perfectly well what words she had on the tip of her tongue. On the one hand, she wanted to call him morons, ask him when he would finally stop thinking with his penis and where he actually had his head when he brought to his bedroom a random guy who knocked on his door. On the other hand, she wanted to comfort him, that it wasn't his fault and he couldn't predict it all. He was grateful that she chose silence.
"Because it hurts."
He wasn't looking for anything odd. There was no need for that. He immediately turned his eyes to the painting behind which the safe was hidden (yes, it was very clichéd, but that was the element of a joke), and he groaned in horror.a
Maybe Bruce could understand it. It would be nice because Tony didn't quite understand all of that. He was never too comfortable in being in love, much less being in a relationship. It didn't mean he wasn't in any of them. On the contrary, he used to be quite often. So what, since every time he heard something like:
He had to run away from them. From them and their compassion. They were his best friends, the only friends except for Banner and Jarvis, so he had to protect them from his pain. Once again he tried to smile:
"Pep," Tony interrupted her with a face contorted in a poor parody of a reassuring smile. "He's sleeping with my father."
"With us like with whom?"
"Really?"
Banner rolled his eyes and started teasing him.
"Do you want me to turn an impact stun gun into an arrowhead?" He asked, looking up from his sketches. "How much time I have? And if I am allowed to know where such an order comes from?"
"That's not what we agreed on."
Normally, Clint wouldn't have given up after a few blunt remarks, but this time Bruce poked his hip slightly and winked, and they both left.
Tony knocked carefully on the door frame and went inside.
"Jarvis, does Coulson carry a walkie-talkie or anything?" Tony asked, avoiding bricks flying towards him at terrifying speed. "Can you catch its frequency?"
He stopped at the door, took a deep breath, ran fingers through his hair, then took on a nonchalant pose, and opened.
"Hulk angry!"
Nice. How was Tony going to get out of it?
"How's it, Agent Coulson?" Fury asked. He didn't have to speak loudly. Everything around him died down immediately.
"Should work any minute," Tony said, taking off his helmet.
"Five more minutes," he groaned, very clearly letting Pepper know he meant at least three hours.
"It's how he talks to you, how you talk to him... and when I saw you together for the first time, you..."
"Did something happen?" he asked worriedly.
"Under control, director of Fury. Barton and Banner are unconscious and the school needs renovation. Besides that, there are no major losses."
And then they were alone.
"Fine," Stark agreed, shrugging.
Stark nodded, glad to know that there was no sign of the reluctance Barton had given him recently. He turned to Coulson instead:
"I'd say it's rather good because I need your help," Bruce laughed. He set aside all notes and calculations, finding some space for their conversation. "I got involved in a project. A real project. Like real. Not some cheap experiments, but a PROJECT. Do you get it?"
"Mhm," Tony grunted. Come on! If he doesn't speak now, he may never have another opportunity! "Actually, it's him. Jarvis is male. And he makes pretty good toast. Do you want one?"
Wonderful, simply wonderful. The sweet soldier didn't even know how much he just made police work easier.
“The Americans,” Steve explains. “They played for New York, then Brooklyn, though they only ever practiced there, but had to break for the War, and apparently they never came back. The Rangers did.” He says
“I do,” Steve says carefully, not sure if this is supposed to be comforting or not.
She doesn’t say it, but Tony knows SHIELD is still missing pieces of his time in Afghanistan. No one has all of that information, not even Jarvis. They probably don’t know all of what happened with Trent, either, unless someone got Pepper or Rhodey to talk, and SHIELD may be sneaky, but Tony can’t see that happening. They might not even have all the details of what happened with Obie, though they probably have enough to figure out the full picture without them. There are only so many ways Obie could have gotten the arc reactor.
Steve frowns, but sits to take his shoes off. “Ready for wheels’ up in five,” is all he says, and shrugs out of his shirt.
“Tony,” Rhodey presses.
, but he’s cut off by Rhodes dropping to the ground next to them.
“Sleep,” Steve nods, gives him a shy smile that looks a little odd on his face, but Tony thinks it was probably a lot more common before he knew him, before the ice, before the war, before the serum.
Steve shrugs. “I don’t, usually. I have to be pretty relaxed to hit that point. Dr. Erskine warned me about my body needing less sleep, and the SHIELD doctors said something about adrenaline levels that I didn’t quite follow when they were running tests back when I first woke up.” He shrugs again, a little self-consciously this time. “The general consensus seemed to be it had more to do with comfort levels than exhaustion, but it does usually mean a good night’s sleep, whatever the science jargon comes out to.”
Then, very abruptly, there’s nothing to fight anymore. The dozens of regular-sized pigeons that were just a moment ago massive and hell-bent on destruction scatter. Most disappear into the trees, while the rest just drop to the ground, making their odd cooing noises as they peck at the ground for crumbs as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened.
Tony twitches a little. “I don’t want to talk about Trent.” It’s both easier and harder to say the name than he’d thought it would be. Fifteen years.
“You can’t wear khaki and plaid anymore, you look like Pepper’s father.” Which is not at all how Tony meant to say that.
Surprisingly – or maybe not so surprisingly, except for the fact that he’s there with Tony – Steve really does seem to be enjoying himself. He doesn’t like everything, of course, but he seems just as happy to tell Tony at length why he
“Sir is in his workshop,” Jarvis responds promptly.
in a way it hadn’t before. Now he has actually signed papers, and is about to go sign more, and then he and Tony are going to be
There’s a sleek black car sitting a few feet away, but Tony just waves at it as they pick their way out onto the main street.
And then they’re in the event hall. Tony will remember afterwards that it really looks like a wedding, with flowers and fancy chairs and everyone dressed to the nines. There’s music playing from somewhere, and Rhodey and Barton and the officiant are all standing at the end of the aisle, under some sort of decorative arch. The only thing he really sees in the moment, though, is Steve, standing next to Barton, and watching Tony.
Steve huffs out a breath that might be a laugh under any other circumstances. “Can you match my breathing?” he asks, inhales slowly, holds it, exhales, holds, and Tony struggles to follow, tries not to think about anything else, doesn’t think about car accidents that might not have been accidents, or police in his dorm room, or closed-casket funerals. Inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Steve’s grip on his shoulders loosens a bit, but he doesn’t let go, just sweeps his thumbs back and forth in a motion that should be irritating but somehow manages to be soothing in its steady beat, like he’s counting his breaths by the movement.
Barton and Natasha appear out of the elevator as Tony touches down, and Jarvis opens the ramp onto the quinjet.
being fine.”
“Cap,” she replies sweetly.
“May I offer a suggestion?”
Steve nods again, more firmly. “I’m sure.”
It takes an effort not to turn to look for the camera. Instead, Tony tips his head back a little to look up at Steve, the smile he digs up not feeling quite as forced as usual.
“Natasha?”
Pasting on a smile, Tony goes to deal with the damned press.
“I’ve never been to Bogotá,” Clint says again, louder, still leaning heavily on Natasha’s shoulder.
It should be disconcerting, seeing so much of Steve in Tony’s private space. They’ve been living together for a couple months, now, and Tony’s barely seen Steve inside what is now
“Great.” Tony steps into a pair of shoes, ties them off, and heads for the elevator, Jarvis pulling up lights as he goes.
“And it has mostly worked very well,” Pepper agrees. “You’re very creative when you’re feeling vindictive, and you’re less likely to piss the board members off if you’re quiet. But
Tony does roll his eyes at that.
Tony leans back against the counter and shrugs. “Jarvis screened them. I figured you had it under control, and I didn’t want to rock the boat.”
Tony’s brows pinch together. “When I said –”
Tony takes a half-step backwards, eyes going wide. “Excuse me?”
“Thanks,” Steve responds automatically, feels his jaw loosen and his mouth curve into a smile like he’s already on camera. He hates how familiar it’s gotten again, as if he’s back on the bond sales circuit, only this time he’s trying to sell himself and Tony, and Tony’s not half as dependable as a bond.
“Captain,” one of the female agents rises to her feet as he approaches. “We were waiting for you.”
“Place him down gently, Iron Man,” Coulson is just as unruffled as ever. “We need him intact.”
Tony makes a huffing noise. “No,” he says, loudly, “we’re not good here.”
“Look, I have to go shower and change, and then meet Tony and Ms. Potts downstairs.” He starts backing towards the door. “Thanks for the best man offer, but we’ve got it covered. Welcome back!” and he very pointedly doesn’t make a run for it, but walks swiftly back to his room, wondering for possibly the millionth time in the last few days what he’s gotten himself into.
“I suppose you’ll do,” Pepper concedes when Tony finally turns to her, fully dressed down to the cufflinks in clothing she’d laid out for him. She eyes him critically for another minute, then shrugs. “Yes, you’ll do.
call-out. Not that Steve wants anything to happen that’s bad enough to need the Avengers, but he also really doesn’t want to stay at this thing, charity or not.
“More like guidelines,” Coulson clarifies. Tony doesn’t find that particularly comforting. “Cap, you’ll be moving by the end of the day. I’ll send a few agents to your apartment when we’re done here to help you with any packing, and they’ll see everything’s relocated without any fuss. You have dinner reservations this evening. It will be private, but not too private. Photographs will be taken of you holding hands at the table and of you returning home together. The rest of your week has been similarly planned. We don’t want to overdo it, but we want it out there before the wedding next Saturday. Ms. Potts, you are drawing up the prenuptial agreement?”
The scowl deepens. “I have clothes,” Steve points out.
“Ready.”
“Careful with this one,” Fury says, looks back up at Steve. “I haven’t worked this hard to keep him up and running to watch him go down over this. And his father would never forgive either of us if you broke him now and I hadn’t done anything to prevent it.”
Steve had been – from both Coulson and Ms. Potts, and again from Clint, who thought the whole thing was hilarious. He still can’t wrap his head around why anyone cares. “It’s not like I’m going to stop taking missions,” he’d said instead.
Tony straightens from where he’d been leaning against the wall. “Nothing,” he snaps. “It’s not like we planned for any of this to happen.”
Politely, big smile in place, he excuses himself from the group he wasn’t paying attention to anyway, and makes his way out onto the terrace, sets the drink he’s been nursing all evening down on the balustrade, and leans on his elbows next to the glass, staring out, not really seeing anything.
“How flattering,” Tony manages to get out.
, but there’s something almost soft in his expression. “Glad you feel comfortable, then,” is all he says.
“Debrief in an hour back at HQ unless we find anything,” Coulson responds.
“That’s the spirit.” Coulson’s mouth twitches in what might be a smile.
He’s not sure if Tony’s changed, or he has, or if he’s just seeing a new side of the other man, but the whole thing has him off-balance. It doesn’t help that Tony is so aware and helpful at these swanky events, and on all of their fake dates, and then turns around to become the infuriating asshole Steve first met. They still work well together in the field, but Tony’s somehow less willing to follow orders, and Steve is tired of being mocked.
Fury meets Tony’s glare for a long moment, then nods once. “You’re good here. I’ll leave you to it.” And he sweeps out.
“Happy birthday to me,” Steve says, against Tony’s ear, and Tony huffs a laugh, reaches up to thread his fingers through Steve’s hair, petting carefully where he’d pulled earlier.
“How quickly?” Steve asks
“And you punched every person who told you as much,” Tony cuts in. “I’ve heard the stories. I
“– isn’t that right, darling?” Tony asks, tips his head to look at Steve from his by-now-customary place under Steve’s arm.
Pepper’s hand on his arm startles him, and he jerks to look at her, grimaces at the look on her face.
Tony nods automatically for a moment, then looks away, takes a deep breath of his own, and looks back, meets her eyes. “I appreciate it,” he tells her. “I do. But I can do this. It’s a teenage celebrity crush that’s gotten a little out of hand, what with a couple decades of compound interest and then actually meeting the man. And it may be – it may have
It’s just really nice, having Steve around when they’re not both on high alert from alien armies or invasive photographers. They’re not talking much, true, but when they do, it’s comfortable from the beginning, unlike every time they’ve been out in public together where they both start on edge, and only slowly find their way around to not snapping at each other. Steve’s talked a little more about his mother, how she’d make breakfast for him when he was young, before he had to learn to do it himself, and Tony has found himself sharing stories about hunting for change for the vending machines with Rhodey in the dorms at MIT to avoid going out into the snow in winter.
When, many years after this conversation, he finally managed to reconcile with the death of his mother, he began to hide behind the painting all the projects that at the moment didn't seem good enough to start their implementation. The safe was made only at Pepper's request. His assistant couldn't bear the thought, that Tony could approach his ideas so dismissively. All the time, however, a sad huntress and her faithful dog stood on guard.
He leaned closer to him, put his hands on his shoulders, and carefully bit his lower lip. Rogers, as if just waiting for it, embraced him tighter and moved him closer, then slipped his tongue between Tony's lips. Tony sighed with pleasure. He did not expect that such discreet motivation could change so much.
He looked away from this awful spectacle and slowly began to retreat.
"You too!"
"If you want to put it this way, yes."
"Could you tell me why you don't like me so much?" Steve asked in his wonderful voice, taking advantage of one of the commercial interludes between the episodes.
He sighed in resignation and sat up. He was about to tell his friends that he was prepared for Coulson's anger and that he had already prepared several prototypes to tame his superiors. That's when his eyes fell on him.
Bruce pulled away quickly from Tony and looked at him with barely repressed concern. Why did all his friends care so much about this kidnapping? It was as if they were assuming that it was the source of some trauma or something... Ok, maybe they were right a little bit. Since that day Tony was constantly improving his armor, but it's probably nothing strange, after all, he was a genius!
"He will hurt you," Tony whispered. With every moment everything burned more and more. Didn't Steve see that? "He always hurts everybody. He didn't do it on purpose, but no one was ever happy with him for more than a few weeks. And I didn't want him to hurt you."
"In general, it's very simple. Steve is nice to everyone, and everyone is nice to Steve. Only you're not. Why? Is that some kind of miracle?"
"I'm sending Captain and Widow.
"What for?" Tony snorted. He had had enough of this. It's not his fault that the relationship between him and Rogers was so awkward. "To even more often admire how incredible is his relationship with my father?
"Warm up the toaster, Jarvis. And prepare the rest, too."
The chances that anything will flourish between young Stark and Rogers have dropped to zero. Tony did absolutely everything to achieve this: at school, he hid in workshops and laboratories, and at home, he didn't stick his nose outside the door of his rooms. It was a pity that he couldn't see Banner as often as he would like, but he explained the situation to him and hoped that his friend would at least try to understand it.
He tried to turn his head away, but Steve took his cheeks and held him tightly.
The boy nodded and grinned.
"That's a good idea," Rogers said and headed toward the exit, probably to share this plan with Fury and Coulson. But before he left the workshop, he looked at Tony again, and with that wonderful smile, he said, "I'm very glad everything is all right between us, Tony."
"Bruce, I'm just a little tired, that's all..."
"I can only tell you that I inherited from Abraham Erskine project of super-soldier serum," he confessed, very pleased with himself, but when he met Tony's doubtful look, his enthusiasm escaped. "I know that sounds like a joke, but believe me, it's not. Erskine managed to complete the project and create one such soldier, but soon after he died and left behind only the result of his research and several encrypted notes."
"He got hit with the stun-gun."
"Before I joined Dr. Erskine's project, I had asthma and serious heart disease."
"I'll try. Have fun."
Instead, he got a warm smile.
"Mr. Banner is at school, his blood is deadly high in adrenaline, if atrial fibrillation does not stop within three minutes, the risk of heart attack will be at 98%. His body was strongly radiated, which causes constant mutations..."
"Happy will be here soon," Tony said finally, finishing the call. "He wondered for a moment if he should come by helicopter, but fortunately, he remembered he didn't have a pilot license."
He was still able to hear his father saying to Steve:
The time for thinking was now over. Now Tony had to act.
This question hurt. Why couldn't he just leave the topic? Why was he bringing it up with such persistence? He should have known for a long time that it was hurting both of them. This time he crossed the line. Tony felt something break in him. He couldn't stand it anymore, he had to finally throw it all out.
Barton never again tried to convince Tony to give Rogers one more chance, and Tony was extremely grateful for that. Thanks to this, their relations remained solid, and the implementation of new stocks of arrows was a pleasant opportunity for both to talk, and not a bothersome duty. Behind the mask of seriousness and cool distance, Clint turned out to be a really nice, though somewhat malicious specimen of a cynic, so he immediately became friends not only with Tony but also with Pepper and Rhodey.
Rogers took a deep breath and slowly moved away from him. He kept looking at Tony closely, then...
"You mean those three?" asked Rhodey, nodding towards the blonde.
Coulson sat on his black armchair behind the mahogany table and gave Tony a polite but patronizing smile. What he will want to force him to do this time?
Coulson's office, as usual, radiated with stiffness. This time, however, Tony gratefully hid inside. Even if it meant exposing himself to the headmaster's embarrassing questions.
Tony didn't allow himself to blush. He glanced at the kitchen counter on which his artificial intelligence was in control of everything, along with the mechanical arm of far less intelligent Dummy. If his father was at home more often, he would know that such a view was something completely normal. Besides, Steve had the right to be surprised, but his genius father? Tony shrugged dismissively.
"Tony. Please."
The man in the uniform converted into a superhero suit shook Tony's hand without hesitation. Although his answer seemed only a polite response, a wide smile suggested something completely different. As if in some magical way Stark managed to break the ice. He stood astonished for a moment, his hand drowning in the man's strong fingers, not knowing exactly what to do next. He has never managed to win anyone so easily (unless he has paid ahead).
It changed absolutely everything.
"Yeah. All in all, it was their mistake. They should've not left me a can of Coke, safety pins and a screwdriver. You can't even imagine how many possibilities such a set gives."
"Master Stark, you have a guest.
Tony reluctantly dug himself out of the silk bedclothes, which he quickly changed into a soft robe, and headed to the office. Pepper followed him, tapping her heels on the wooden floor. At first glance, everything looked as usual. Basically speaking, the room was in an extraordinary order. No, not because Tony was running away from work. He just thought much better in the workshop, while the office served only as a meeting place for important clients.
He tucked the bag over his shoulder, taking comfort from the sheer weight of his genius, and knocked on the door.
"Last year I was kidnapped by a terrorist group. They tried to force me to build a weapon for them, but I managed to escape. That's all."
"Oh, Tony! You're finally here! Have you met Steve? Since today he will go to SHIELD..."
"Who is this?" he whispered a bit embarrassed when Pepper's soft laugh pulled him away from the examination.
Tony returned home and went to bed immediately. Both Happy and Jarvis were deeply concerned about his behavior, and especially about how stubbornly he tried to put up a brave face. He hated to hurt his loved ones, but he couldn't help it. He suffered too much, and his suffering spilled out of him like... like foam from a jacuzzi tub, into which someone had poured too much water and bath bubbles.
Tony looked at him with a smile so full of happiness and gratitude that the eyebrows of his three new "friends" involuntarily went up.
"Shit," Tony moaned. He buried his face in his hands and wiped away the last seeds of sleep. "I let in trick-or-treaters yesterday."
"How would I know? I was interested only in their guardian."
Stark didn't have much influence on what happened.
Before he drowned completely in these verbal scuffles with Coulson, he heard Steve ask his guards:
Barton decided to talk to Banner immediately to save himself from awkward situations. It turned out to be a bull's-eye, and even more. Despite all their differences, they simply discovered soul mates in each other. Although separately they were both quite nice, they changed beyond recognition when they were together, spreading anger, sadness, and sorrow in the unexpected ironic twist.
"You still didn't tell me how you managed to escape..."
Tony turned slowly to take a look at Steve, who was heading towards him with his two guards. From the eyes of the two he read clearly that if Steve wanted to talk to him, their head was in it so that he could not escape. Tony decided not to even try.
"Tony, are you picking me up or just trying to be funny?" Banner asked in reply, giving him a wide smile from above a row of test tubes."
Howard was already opening his mouth to add another remark about wasting talent when (luckily) his phone rang. Older Stark glanced at the screen, winced and ran out of the kitchen, shouting over his shoulder:
Hearing this, Rogers blushed, put down his plate quickly and, smiling shyly, apologized to Tony, and simply fled. And that would be enough when it comes to intelligent conversation.
It's all because of this damn project. Only how did Bruce get irradiated? Was he going to use himself as a lab animal? He had mice and rats at his disposal. Maybe the serum was only compatible with the human body? Perhaps in the case of any other species, it caused such a strong immune response that it ended in the death of the test object?
"Military scholarship? It's like you, Rhodes."
"Do you really want to invite us?" asked one of the kids suspiciously.
Everyone who dared to get to know him at least a little bit knew that at that moment his brilliant mind went on a journey towards the future.
"The Avengers," Steve explained, then smiled crookedly. "I didn't choose the name, but it's not that important."
"I detected a call made on Mr. Coulson's phone. Should I hack it?"
And indeed there was a green monster. The worst thing was that, as predicted, Tony identified his friend in the monster.
"He is a wonderful man, that's for sure. But he is also a hopeless father. If you want to make friends with Tony, never mention him. Never."
On the way to the laboratory, he also caught a coffee machine and took the two largest with all possible additives (he affectionately called it fuel, which always made Bruce laugh). Armed with that, he went to visit his friend.
"I wanted to include him in project A, but Fury said he had to think about it. That in its current state Banner is too unstable to make such decisions. Unfortunately, I had to agree with him."
"Why are you doing this to me?"
"Yes. Not more than a week if possible. No, you are not allowed. You already know too much."
"For three months?"
Wonderful. Just great. The same soft male voice that with laugher murmured his father's name, to him was referring only as "Stark." It couldn't have been better.
"Bingo!" Bruce admitted happily. "And it so happens that he will come here soon. You probably already had the opportunity to see him. His name is Steve Rogers, tall, blond, rather handsome... Tony? All right? You are so pale."
Barely refraining from jumping, he went to the kitchen to celebrate his genius with sweet, crispy toast.
The kids didn't have to be told twice. They willingly ran after the round bodyguard and left their guardian at the mercy of the host. Rogers seemed somewhat worried. He frowned and gave Stark an examining glance.
Tony walked slowly to the painting. The girl herself remained intact, but tiny cracks appeared next to her. Stark held out a trembling hand to the damaged canvas. He was never particularly sensitive to art, he just liked to surround himself with beautiful things. But this piece of art belonged to his family, and more specifically, to his mother's family. The greatest moments of Tony's childhood, everything that he loved in his mother and what she loved in him, were enchanted in that painting.
"Why?"
Stark didn't expect that thanks to his armor he would be able to pull out the lantern. Fortunately, he was. Banner was surprisingly fast for a huge, heavy monster, but he couldn't match Iron Man. Bending the lantern like it was made of plasticine, Tony wrapped it very strongly around his green friend. He knew that he didn't have much time, because the beast was able to tear much stronger things than the lantern, so as soon as he shouted something that sounded like:
He ran to his workshop and slammed the door.
Taking advantage of the fact that they were alone, Pepper moved closer to Tony and whispered in his ear:
No matter what Pepper thought, red and gold matched perfectly, just like the name he picked. He wasn't sure if he was swollen with pride or paint fumes, but he knew for sure that he had done something magnificent. No. Monumental. That's a better word. In half an hour, when the paint dries, his work of the last few months will finally be done.
Tony took a deep breath hearing his name. THe used his name, damn, he did. What a direct boy! Stark grinned at the thought of how he would reward his soldier.
"Couldn't you ask him to introduce us earlier?" Tony cursed at the thought of how many problems it would have saved them.
Why? What has he done to deserve this? He was so polite today...
Tony didn't expect that question. And even if he expected it, he wouldn't know what to say. So he just shrugged and nodded. Steve's smile grew even wider, as wide as it was possible.
"Tommy!" the super-soldier groaned in horror and flushed with embarrassment. "Tommy, please, say you are sorry."
"You remind me of my younger brother so much that I feel like looking after you forever."
All this did not change the fact that Bruce should not have tested this shit on himself.
"I haven't had the chance yet," Tony admitted truthfully. He nodded at them. He knew they were dangerous, and they knew he knew. For the three of them, such a beginning of acquaintance was quite enough, unfortunately, Steve decided to make a more detailed presentation, at least when it came to the young genius:
"It depends if you are a villain."
"Argue with me a little more, and myself I will make sure you get to bed." This threat did not have the intended effect, because after a while he added: "I already mentioned that it the same box is me hugging you to sleep and serious conversation with Pepper the next morning?"
Tony didn't know what to do with himself. He took a strategic position on the edge of the sofa and tried to focus on the screen of his tablet. The fact that Steve was doing exactly the same at the other end of the sofa (but he was using a notebook and a pencil) did not lift his spirits.
"Anthony, a quarter of the school is in ruins. One lantern more or less really doesn't make much difference to me now. Just stop him."
Tony just shrugged.
"Maybe it will be better that way for everyone."
"But?"
That was the case also this evening.
"Happy, take this squad of self-proclaimed heroes to the salon and play my Star Trek collection. The episodes are numbered in order from the most outstanding to unfortunately only good ones, so you don't have to worry about choosing. And, give them some popcorn!"
Steve smiled back and kissed him again. Their lips touched so gently that Stark began to fear that they would not cross the line of modest kisses that evening. He couldn't allow it. He was quite familiar with kissing, so he decided to force a slightly faster pace on Steve.
It can be said that he managed to achieve a double victory.
"Sure, why not," Tony agreed quickly. "Is this not a problem? After all, my house is at the end of the street, it got completely dark, you're not going anywhere else?" He sputtered words like rifle bullets The only reaction, however, was the growing terror in the soldier's eyes. With each letter, Stark was getting farther away from his desired goal, and there was no indication that he would ever achieve it.
"Tony, your father was helping me with ECG tests."
He shrugged at Banner and explained:
"What is it?"
"Sure, boss," he finally agreed, but his face was sour. "Come on, little ones. You will see the largest salon in the city in a moment."
"Our Banner?" Fury looked doubtfully at the battered, naked Bruce lying in the cocoon of the broken lantern. It was a rhetorical question, however, and Fury shifted his gaze to Tony without waiting for an answer. "What kind of armor is this?"
"Mhm," Tony said lightly. "Was that the reason why you dragged me here?"
"Anthony! Could I borrow you to my office?"
"How can I like you if you are sleeping with my father?"
"And you, basing on these notes and the soldier's genetic material, will try to reconstruct this whole serum?"
"Not so loud," Tony hissed. "Phil has ears everywhere."
"It's a very long story, but it's roughly because Howard once forced me to watch an interview with you. Then suddenly I started to notice that you were everywhere. You know, in newspapers, radio, and television. I wouldn't normally think you were within my reach, but I knew your father, so I hoped I might have a chance."
Anything. Let anything happen that will save him from this nightmare. He won't really be mad. Not at all.
"It doesn't look like a prototype, Agent Coulson," Fury said. "I'd rather say it's a finished product," he looked at Tony so attentively and penetratingly that the boy had a sincere desire to sink into the ground. "Tell me, Stark, how did you build something like that without Coulson noticing?"
Constant monitoring of the threat to friends' lives was the only thing similar to the obsession in which he invested after his abduction. He didn't care so much about his own life, because he knew that others cared about it, but he would never forgive himself if his loved ones were hurt.
"It's a phone number," he choked, as the lazy caffeine slowly formed the digits into meaningful information. "He left me his number!" Tony called, then laughed.
And now the painting was destroyed.
Or even worse:
Not only Banner's laboratory was destroyed, but the entire wing of the school.
The sexy soldier didn't come alone. A flock of kids armed with candy bags crowded around his legs. Tony mentally prepared himself to beg for a trick, and now he couldn't say a word.
"Of course not."
"Of course not, Anthony," Coulson denied in an act of courtesy. "If you want, you can go now. I wish you a nice time working on new projects."
Rogers remained a huge problem. Although Tony was still deluding himself that he would somehow avoid the blonde young god, it soon turned out that it was absolutely impossible. He even concluded that the rest of the household allied against him and purposely led to situations in which he and Rogers were alone in the room.
"There are no records."
"Oh Tony, and what am I supposed to do now?" Rogers laughed into his ear with pain in his voice.
"Yes, Master Stark."
"Don't be so modest. Everything you do is unique," Pepper snorted, almost bursting with pride. She behaved just like an older sister, whose younger brother just learned to ride a bicycle without training wheels. "How's the armor?"
Steve laughed out loud, which made Tony realize how simple he really was. Someone who was able to laugh like that just had to be good to the bone. And it was terrifying.
Steve couldn't be a thief.
Tony left the bathroom, releasing a cloud of hot steam. He shivered involuntarily from the cold air. Why did this damn property have to be so big that everything was far away? He had to develop a special transport to move around his own home. Even let it be roller skates... only better, without wheels, but with jet propulsion.
"My superiors approved the prototypes you left me yesterday," Phil confessed, it was a top-class compliment in his mouth. "One particularly appealed to them," in support of his words, he pulled a stack of documents from the drawer and handed them to Stark. The boy quickly recognized his own notes and corrections made to them. He didn't really like anyone else's notes on his work, but some of them seemed... intriguing.
The moment his armor identified the source of danger from the arrow, the stun-gun shot straight into Barton's hand and knocked him unconscious.
All in all, he was very curious about Banner's test results, so maybe nothing will happen if he is stuck in his laboratory. It would be the best move. He would disappear from Rhodey's and Pepper's sight and would reduce the possibility that he would accidentally run into...
Stark very slowly turned his head and felt everything soften in him and begun to spin at a dizzying pace. He wanted to look away, but he couldn't. Steve acted on him like a magnet; once pulled to him, Tony was unable to escape.
"I still have work to do in the workshop," Tony said and gathered all his strength to give them an apologetic smile and run away.
No, he wasn't going to wake up. Not yet.
"No, no, no! Don't sir me. Tony Stark." Tony reflexively reached out his hand, realizing too late that she was still oiled and smelling of sandalwood. Damn, if that...
"I thought you wouldn't ask," Steve laughed and gave Tony an enchanting smile with the power of turning knees into cotton.
"Phil, stop shooting! It's me, Tony Stark!"
Barton opened his mouth wide in surprise, then began to ask the headmaster about hundreds, in Tony's opinion, completely irrelevant things. After all, he went to a special school for very gifted people, so why was he so surprised by the fact that the equipment was arranged for him by another student? His attitude changed as soon as he saw the contents of the suitcase. In a split second, he turned from a surprised boy into a professional archer. He touched the arrows, caressed them, checked their weight in his hands, and finally stated:
"He hasn't told him anything, yet," Pepper snorted, then gave her slumbering friend a tender look.
"Yes, Jarvis, connect," Tony called, stepping away from his masterpiece.
"It's not so obvious."
"Why does it hurt you so much that I could be with your father?"
"Jarvis, turn off the damn light!" Tony shouted, redirecting his anger onto artificial intelligence.
Stark entered the office and, with a small boy's smile on his face, exclaimed:
Steve just nodded understandingly.
Banner at first glance seemed much happier to him than usual, which also made Tony feel better. At least fate was smiling at one of them.
"More than calling it Iron Man?"
Throwing curses under his breath, he pulled sweatpants on his overly oiled ass and draped himself in a thick fluffy robe. The only thing he wanted was to catch a cold because of the army of gnomes dressed in absurd costumes. What was popular this year? Vampires? Werewolves? Ah, yes, superheroes. What idiocy.
Tony sighed but couldn't help smiling.
"No, it's probably not the best idea," said the stranger shyly. "We can't impose on you so much."
"Steve Rogers, nice to meet you."
As if that was not enough, Banner chose him as a new target and began to throw at him everything that fell into his large green hands.
"Anthony? You want to tell me that you are in this... this..."
"Have you met Natalie and Clint?" Steve asked, obviously trying to break the silence between them.
Tony couldn't stand it anymore. He turned his chair slightly and looked at Rogers in surprise.
"Until tomorrow? Like how?" Tony snorted, giving Bruce one of his most disarming smiles.
"It was Banner, sir."
"Anthony, would you be so nice and show Clint the content of your suitcase?" Coulson asked before Tony could offend him for instead of saying "good morning".
"No." Damn it. Did he really say that? Tony took a deep breath and faced the army of children and their far too tempting guardian. "I don't have candies."
"Don't worry," Bruce snorted, pleased again. "He'll get it until next time."
"Maybe."
"Did you really make it yourself?"
"You shouldn't mention his father around him."
If at that moment Steve suggested that he would also cuddle Tony to sleep, he would happily argue a little more. Unfortunately, he didn't hear anything like that, so he obediently reached for the phone and dialed Happy's number.
"Damn it!" Tony cursed and moved the frame away.
"It's not your business, Barton."
They didn't have the strength to talk long. Tony let Steve kiss and cuddle him, repaying him with similar caresses until he was too tired to move. It was wonderful falling asleep with the thought that he had finally found the perfect place to sleep, without thoughts and nightmares swirling in his head. And in the morning he would wake up with someone who belonged only to him.
Damn it. Wonderful, just wonderful. His father was just getting Steve drunk with some absurdly exclusive liquor, and Tony was parading around the house only in his bathrobe.
Tony concluded that armor would get him to school the fastest. It wasn't that he wanted to test it again. After all, the fresh paint could crack, so it was clear that he was guided only by the safety of his friend.
Merry Christmas! :)
"Write to them that I'm fine. I was just tired and I had to sleep."
"Thanks, Phil! I always knew you were a really nice guy!" Tony shouted and fled the office before Coulson could scream at him.
"So... you have any idea how to stop him?"
"Who is it?"
"Yes, Master Stark. You have contact."
To his surprise, Fury also smiled, which seemed to him a good sign for a moment, then this illusion popped like a soap bubble.
"No, you don't understand," Tony sighed. "You can't be genuinely nice to everyone, because being nice means liking someone, and there will always be someone you don't like. It's natural. As for Rogers, well, he really isn't nice to me. He is nice to my father, and being nice to me is just part of that."
"I am happy for you," said the younger boy. "But before I start screaming with you like a little girl at the sight of a unicorn, would you like to reveal some more details?"
"I'm sorry, Pep. I have to finish my armor."
"So you... and my father... you are not...?"
"For over a year."
"No. I'm serious. It adheres to the classic current, is easy to remember and generally fits. It's just right for a superhero."
"On the contrary, it is my business. If something happened to you, Howard would surely..."
Tony Stark laughed and threw himself at the handsome soldier. He had to stand on his toes to get into his mouth, but it didn't matter. Rogers' lips were wonderfully soft and hungry as if he had not had the opportunity to use them right for a long, long time.
What a waste!
This question was asked by Steve. He stared with eyes wide open at Jarvis, but he wasn't terrified, more like fascinated. It was obvious that he completely did not understand what was happening right under his nose, but his mind did not try to deny it or reject it. He just accepted what he saw, artificial intelligence was just making a toast for Tony.
As if that wasn't enough, Rogers muted the sound every time the ad spot started. There was absolutely nothing worse than having him so horribly close, hearing his pencil scraping against paper and his breath...
"But why? Howard is, after all..."
"Barton! Stop shooting at him! This is Banner!"
"I don't think I understand the question."
"Why? Did I say something wrong?" Steve's voice was full of strange sadness as if he was guided by the best intentions and didn't understand what he didn't succeed.
Still, he was officially admitted to the SHIELD only a year ago, just after he managed to escape his abductors. He was supposed to be safe at school, but... Exactly. BUT. The kidnappers hoped that they would make him build weapons. The SHIELD was expecting exactly the same. He hadn't given them anything they could use, so far. He didn't even show them the prototype of the armor that he used to escape. Rhodey was right. The day when Headmaster Coulson will lose his patience was approaching with great speed.
Well, he was wearing an idiotic superhero costume, but he definitely wasn't the worst Tony could see. Contrary. Golden, combed back hair, blue eyes, firm jawline, and sharp cheekbones. The navy blue costume, reminiscent of a uniform rather than kitschy spandex, only emphasized the unreal perfection of the man waiting at the door.
“You sick bastard.” Steve’s not trembling, though he feels he should be. Instead, his anguish is honed into a sharp edge. Cool and efficient.
Then, at last, the tipping point. Where so many victims once stood, desperately praying for life yet receiving death all the same. Now stands the Red Skull, indifference shattered at his newfound mortality. The universe is balanced, and revenge always finds a way.
“кто, черт возьми, Наташа?”
The silence is mocking him.
During the aforementioned dinner, Tony begins to regret his moment of weakness. He just hates seeing Steve in distress. But now he’s beginning to think he’s the one in need of saving, as his steak tastes like ash in the awkward silence Steve keeps trying to fill. Bucky plays along, but Tony’s pretty sure he’s not having fun either. After a few minutes, Tony excuses himself and heads to the bathroom to splash water on his face. Maybe that’ll turn his social prowess on.
“Favorite color,” Tony shoots.
The wind starts up again.
Tony meets the two rival companies, and finds out more about Steve's protective friend (and what makes him SO protective).
Next Chapter: Tony gets a "bright idea" on how to ask Steve out.
Steve lunges at the Red Skull.
“I’m so sorry, everything’s under control now and I’m donating DUM-E to the community college but not before he writes an apology letter for wasting your time. I kept trying to tell him that’s not how you cook a beef wellington and then he went ahead and set the whole goddamn oven on fire- ”
robot, equipped with everything needed to ensure the safety of a flight. Metal detectors, x-rays, and pat-downs, the whole package. It even has eyes to make it vaguely humanoid, but Steve says Tony doesn’t really understand humans anyway. He has a point, but Tony understands children well enough, and adults were once all children.
In front of him stood one concerned-looking,
Steve doesn’t even blink. “Yellow.”
When newspapers blare headlines calling the assistant “Iron Man,” Tony can’t even be that annoyed (“Look, Steve, you’ve got to understand, it’s a nickel-titanium alloy-”). Because the moment Steve sees the colorful robot, he starts to cry. Tony fusses and flutters his hands uselessly, telling him, “If you hate it I can just set it on fire, just please don’t cry. I hate seeing you cry, babe. Look, I’ll do it right now-”
He hits the ground.
Silence. Not even a flicker of recognition lights up the Skull’s blank stare. In the soul-sucking hush, Steve’s shock mutates into fury. Anger that has been sitting for a century with nowhere to go. Well, it’s all racing out now, thrumming through his body, and Steve feels the most alive he’s felt in years.
Steve meets his eye. “What about you?”
Bucky's eyes widen. “You heard that? Of course you did.”
“Of course, of course!” Why hadn’t Tony thought of that? He was an inconsiderate idiot. Stupid. How he had managed to become an inventor was beyond him.
Huh. So he’s a Steve. It fit somehow, with the All-American look and the professional expression on his face that was slowly slipping into bemusement.
Tony cuts him off once again. “No, no, I’d very much like that,” he smiles. It feels good to be on the receiving end this time.
Then Tony looks at the red of his suit on paper, sees the yellow of the bloom, and thinks,
The unexpected sight brings him to his knees, bile rising at the back of his throat. Tears of grief return, blazing hot trails across his face. Except this time he’s overtaken by rage. He raises his eyes, still streaming, and stares the Red Skull down.
“My parents were in a plane crash June of last year. No one made it out.”
The world is loud. People are constantly bustling about, too busy to look beyond their own noses. It’s easy enough for Natasha to slip through the cracks, footfalls ever so soft.
But now, he stands alone. And Steve thinks he might be hallucinating. Or having a panic attack. Or both.
“Thanks Bucky, that means a lot.” Steve is grinning ear to ear, smile brimming with happiness and relief. He seemed to know that dinner hadn’t been going well, too.
Insanity lurks in the void.
As he heads back, approaching their booth, a conversation drifts through the chatter.
Tony gets the nerve to ask Steve on a date, the semi-normal way.
Silence. Steve’s eyes widen as he remembers what’s been flashing across every major news outlet for days, what caused that. “I’m- I’m so sorry,” he stammers, “I didn’t mean to pry-”
Tony goes into shock.
Thanks so much for reading!
Tony opened his mouth to apologize, but Steve was already walking away.
Tony shook himself out of it. “Tony is fine.”
“I was just on the way back and I caught some snippets. But really, thank you, your approval means a lot to Steve, though I was under the impression you still hated me and-” And he’s rambling.
They finish their respective beverages, then saunter (in Tony’s case) and stroll down the street in the chilly autumn air.
, Tony adds mentally,
Of course, Tony has to one-up him. He’s competitive like that. So when Steve goes to the fire station to find daffodils and dandelions all over his office, he’s not even surprised. Flattered, maybe. Blushing, definitely.
“Mr. Stark? Are you alright, sir?”
Again, Steve swings at him. The Stone, clutched forgotten in his fist, makes sure it connects this time. Steve is sure the shock in the Skull’s face is reflected in his. But the wonder gives way to a frenzy as Steve keeps hitting. It’s almost like the mindless routine of a punching bag, except his target is very much alive now. Yet he doesn’t care.
firefighter. Dirty blond hair peeked out from under the helmet and that jawline my god-
Steve does as instructed, gingerly fishing the stone from its case. Then he dutifully leans over the edge, prepared to throw-
“Anyway, they died because of faulty airport security, or lack thereof. So obviously, that’s why I’m going to make sure it never happens again, not to anyone else.” He blinks hard, eyes hot. “Because I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.” Steve’s hand squeezes his, grounding him to the here and now. He clears his throat. “So, Stark Security,” he announces, waving his hands, “and all that.” He quiets.
to save the world from them, from the Red Skull, from Hydra. Turns out he never could do things right.
Color. Color will sell it.
tilted his head. “So you’re all good, then?”
Steve turns bashful, averting his eyes. “Well, my father was a firefighter. Died in a house fire when I was 3. Mom used to tell me all these stories about what a hero he was, and I dunno, I guess I wanted to be like him?”
“Answer me!” he cries desperately.
And Tony doesn’t think too much after that.
Natasha still lies there, broken.
The Red Skull opens his mouth, perhaps to whisper one last plea, before Steve’s fist connects with his face, letting the Stone go in the same moment. The Red Skull’s dramatic black robes billow as he falls, an expression of disbelief forever etched on his face.
They sit there for a while, comfortable quiet permeating the air as the smell of roasted coffee wafts through.
“Do you know their names?” No response.
Tony laughs bitterly. “It’s okay, it’s not often people forget who they’re talking to.” Steve ducks his head, and Tony softens, placing a hand on his shoulder. “No, really, it’s fine. It’d be nice to talk about them, I guess.”
When Tony complains about anniversaries being about the two of them, Steve tells him, “Bucky’s important to me, and I want you two to get along.” Tony can’t help but think it’s too late for that.
Steve places a hand over Tony’s. “I’m sorry.” Tony swallows at the warmth.
Tears seared his icy skin, a shadow of grief decades old.
“Oh thank god,” Tony says.
Life was so unfair.
Returning the Soul Stone should be easy, which is why he put it first on his list. He just hadn’t thought Vormir would be so goddamn cold. But he still has a job to do, so he centers himself and trudges on.
“Of course it is.”
Death is quiet. There is nowhere to hide. And the silence makes her feel more exposed than judgment ever would.
These words would have pleased Stark if they hadn't sounded like a big and cruel lie.
Tony nodded and quickly said goodbye to Pepper and Rhodey. Accordingly to his speculations, Steve and Natalie stood nearby, but they didn't follow them, and they limited themselves to close observation. Seeing that Tony was looking in his direction, the Rogers smiled shyly and waved to him, to which Stark replied with a restrained nod. He was slowly getting used to the idea that his new crush was absolutely beyond his reach and he wasn't going to delude himself that it was not the truth. This was a very good direction for the development of his feelings. And it was seemingly the least painful.
"It's Anthony Stark's new prototype," Coulson answered quickly before Tony could even open his mouth. Unfortunately, he managed to open the mask, so that everyone could admire how, with real terror on his face, he tries to come up with any logical answer.
"Let him in."
"And you are right. They both love each other. But that's not the problem. The problem is that they are really bad at it."
"What happened to Clint?"
"Hi, Phil! What's up?"
When he locked himself inside, and all parameters indicated readiness for action, he asked Jarvis for another report.
They did not have to wait long until the boss of all bosses Nicolas Fury arrived. He had dark skin, an eyepatch, and looked scary and mysterious in a black duster. His face expressed absolutely nothing, calmly judged all the damage, as if he had already seen much worse things. Rogers and Rushman followed him. Well, at least it was clear who Captain and Widow were.
Tony pulled away from Rogers so he could look him in the eye. Steve used this to lie back, pulled young Stark back and let him put his head on his shoulder.
"You don't have to, I can handle them," said Clint, giving Tony a warm smile. "Just let me know when you will do the next batch. I will give you a few arrows that I use usually."
"You're in serious trouble, Mr. Stark."
It was bad. Very very bad.
"Why do you think I... and your father..."
"Red and gold."
The headmaster calmed his pride and smiled weakly at Stark.
Tony had no idea if he wanted to scream at Happy for interrupting the conversation at the most emotional moment or kiss him for coming to the rescue. Nothing prevented him from passing responsibility on his bodyguard, ask him to look after children so that Tony could do something much more pleasant.
"QUIT IT."
"Jarvis, I left Coulson's project on the desk. Could you upload it to the database and prepare a list of necessary items?"
"Oh, Tony. You'd better stay away from problems. At least until I get back from the cinema. Ok?"
"With me, Rhodey and... some other people."
There is nothing like professional concern for the safety of students.
"What?" Pepper was completely dumbfounded. She knew perfectly well what attitude Tony had towards Halloween. She knew that he did everything to avoid dressed up people seeking sweets unless it involved... She closed her eyes, took a few deep breaths, then looked eloquently at her boss. "How many?"
"By "we" you mean yourself, Barton and Rushman?"
"Project A?"
"And will there be the most popcorn in the city?"
And Tony was only wearing a soft red bathrobe.
"I brought you a full tank of fuel, so I'm afraid it's rather the first one," Stark replied, handing him coffee. "Is there something wrong with it?"
"Armor?" Tony suggested. "Yes, but this is not the time for that. This green monster is Banner."
Not that his armor needed any improvements. However, if there was to be someone in the world with arrows equipped with his stun gun, why should he not be prepared for the fact that this person would ever hit him with that weapon? Actually, he was even able to go a step further and...
"Popcorn and Star Trek?"
"Once I also used to think that it's a sad painting. Now, when I look at it, I see you working on the next project and worrying about whether it will be good enough. I see you not realizing at all how much you have achieved."
They couldn't become friends. At that moment Tony already knew he loved him too much to be just his friend.
"Do you realize how long I can't stop thinking about you?" Steve gasped, stroking Tony's cheek with his thumb.
It didn't bother Tony that, with his mouth open, he was devouring someone with his eyes, though that expression certainly was humiliating for someone with his social status. Right now it was enough for him to look. Look at the golden hair in which the rays of the sun play, at the perfectly blue eyes, calm as a cloudless sky, at wide strong shoulders, slender waist, long legs...
"It's still not..."
Stark was speechless. Well... it did explain a lot. Certainly most of what happened. Why didn't he come up with it himself? Why did he immediately suspect the worst? It was his father's fault. If it wasn't for his promiscuous social life, Tony would never have thought of that.
"This is very obvious because I am interested in someone else."
He was sitting in such a bathtub right now. In the foam reaching his ears, he drowned sadness in the warm smell of almonds. He slept all afternoon and didn't know what to do with himself. Bathing seemed like the best solution.
Was it possible that Steve... But on the other hand, there had to be a reason why this sweet soldier caught fire so quickly and so desperately attacked Stark. He didn't look like someone who spontaneously makes decisions about jumping into bed with strangers. If, however, money was involved or, worse, fanaticism, Tony would need any other explanation. It would just mean he met another asshole, that's all.
"The catch is that you will be allocated in a military scholarship of the same class as mine," Rogers explained calmly. He was looking down at Tony all the time, arms folded. He looked so attractive that Stark had to go to great lengths to fight the urge to touch him. "It means more or less that from tomorrow I will be your supervisor and you have just become a member of project A."
"What do you mean?" asked the eldest boy in a blue-red suit with a large spider and with glasses a little too big.
Correction: it was terrible. Worse than terrible.
He almost shouted, surprised by the unexpected question. He looked at Pepper, who was standing by the marble counter and distrustfully watched the candies scattered around it. Tony frowned and quickly pushed the sweets away. Underneath was a handkerchief folded in four. Tony reached for it, unconsciously holding his breath.
"Details, Jarvis. You need to give me more details,” he called, running towards his workshop.
"Phil gives me a free hand when it comes to projects... director Fury" Tony replied, smiling shyly.
"Why do you think that would bother me?"
"Hey, Stark," Clint called so close that Tony began to wonder how much of their conversation he could have heard (and how much he would be able to repeat to somebody else). "Coulson asked me to bring you to his office. Apparently, you have a package for him."
Pepper Potts frowned, which was a very clear warning. "You underestimate me again, Stark!" she seemed to scream. And she was right, of course. If it was enough to view the cameras records to catch the thief, Potts wouldn't wake up her boss at all. Tony took a deep breath. He was completely sober (exceptionally), so he didn't suspect himself of misjudging Rogers. Sure, he certainly wasn't an outstanding psychologist, he obtained PhDs in completely different fields of science, but he wasn't that stupid.
The most interesting thing that happened in the last few days was the strange Banner & Barton alliance. It was fair to conclude that after they both tried to kill each other, they would avoid and secretly hate each other.
For a few annoyingly long minutes, he had to explain to Happy that calling for an ambulance and calling for his father was unnecessary. He understood his concern, but all that overprotectiveness was beginning to annoy him a bit. The worst thing was that he felt Steve's eyes on him all the time, which made him constantly lose the thread. Why did he do this to him? His very presence was like torture.
"Howard, please stop! It tickles!"
"That's more than I have hoped for," whispered Steve. Something in his voice made Tony think, that he was about to cry from relief and joy.
"And this green..."
Happy looked at his boss uncertainly. Anxiety was in his eyes; he probably already guessed what Tony planned and with all his good heart he strongly condemned it, but on the other hand, the prospect of stuffing yourself with popcorn (despite the diet!) together with the disguised kids must have looked extremely tempting.
It was a very short kiss, more like a test before something more serious than a real caress.
"Isn't that too pretentious?"
That's when Tony saw the second thing. Or rather things. There was a jacket on the hanger that certainly didn't belong to his father. What's more interesting, it wasn't a women's jacket either. Dark brown leather, slightly worn, a style more casual than elegant. And shoes in a similar fashion. It could only mean an unofficial military delegation. Wonderful. Has Coulson already informed his father that Tony knows about Fury's existence?
"Stark, wait!"
The kids froze, clearly intrigued.
It took Tony a while to understand that allusion. His thinking was definitely hampered by the fact that only one Steve's hand was on his hand. The other, however, began to stroke his back along the spine line, from the neck to the sacrum and back, simultaneously pulling him towards Rogers. That's why Tony realized that Steve shamelessly picked him up, only when he sat on Rogers' lap, and his wonderfully soft lips touched his own.
“I’d hoped to,” Steve says, doesn’t sound like he’s taking Tony’s word at anything but face value. It’s. Nice. “It’s what I went to school for. Not really the best way to make a living, especially then, but. I loved it.”
Hands are grasping Tony’s shoulders, shaking him, and Tony looks up, and up, into blue, blue eyes. Tony blinks, and Steve’s face comes into focus, very close to his own. “Steve?”
By the time Steve starts yawning, he and Tony are the only ones left in what was once Tony’s living room, but has now become the Avengers’ common room, stretched out at opposite ends of the couch, legs intertwined in a way Steve would have found irritating only a few short months ago, but now just feels comfortable. The others have all gone off to their own apartments, presumably to sleep, trickling out in the last hour or two since the movie ended.
“Welcome home, Captain,” Jarvis’s voice greets him as the elevator doors open into the penthouse. “Your personal effects have been placed in the third room to the left.”
“She’s a little young for you, isn’t she?”
“Nothing,” is the almost immediate response. “Trash.”
“Nor should you,” Pepper agrees, “But that doesn’t mean you can’t let him see what you’re really like when you’re not trying to pull his pigtails, and let him figure the rest out on his own.”
she’s behaving like someone who wants to get back together with her ex, but it’s not like he has a lot of experience in that arena. The thought makes something knot uncomfortably in the pit of his stomach. He’s not sure if it’s his business.
“Very good, sir,” Jarvis sounds surprised, but vaguely pleased.
It’s all so ridiculous Steve can’t even think of a way to object, just sits and gapes for a long moment. He knows the world is still fighting over race, religion, politics, pushing smaller groups down, and he hates it, always has, but the very idea that people would think
“I arrived last night,” Thor replies, beaming.
“Newspapers, wrappers, cups,” is Steve’s contribution. “Usual New York.”
know how to listen, and even if it seems at the time like he’s a million miles away, little things keep cropping up that make it plain he heard every word, and he
That makes Clint laugh. “If you say so, Cap.” He doesn’t dispute the gossip rag comment, Steve notes.
Steve has to force himself not to tense up, has no idea what to say. Mr. Cooper’s looking at him, now, like he expects something exciting or sweet, when, in reality, Steve hadn’t seen Tony except for at dinner. He had spent most of the day at SHIELD, and the rest split between the gym and the library. From what Tony had said at dinner, he’d spent most of the day in his workshop or meetings. None of that particularly screams
“Barton said you had a meeting at SHIELD?” Tony has taken a piece of bread from the basket in the middle of the table and is methodically shredding it onto the little plate he has in front of him.
The moment hangs, stretches out, snaps, and Tony pushes forward, kisses back. This is what he wanted to say.
Steve blinks, then returns to the elevator. “Will this take me there?” he asks.
Steve frowns. “Do we need the quinjet if we’re just going to Central Park?”
split to begin with.
“We’ll wait for you outside,” Rhodey says, and gives Pepper a little tug to get her moving when it looks like she might say something else.
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” Tony offers, half convinced that’s a sure way to get Steve to drop it, half sure it’s the only way to get Steve to talk, and fully aware both of them coming clean is the best option for the team, and the world as a whole. Which feels a little egotistical, but probably isn’t far from the truth.
“You are actually planning on going through with this,” it’s not a question, and Tony doesn’t even bother to dignify Rhodey with a look, just tips his chin up a bit higher as he fights with his bow tie. The damn thing won’t cooperate, and it’s got nothing to do with the fact that he can feel the way his hands want to shake.
“What the hell?” In the abrupt silence, Barton’s voice is loud, clearly audible in the tunnel as well as over the comms.
“Let’s move,” Steve says, and Tony can hear Natasha and Barton sigh in relief.
“This is what we get for doing our jobs instead of providing gossip fodder every evening,” Tony had muttered into Steve’s ear about an hour in, when it already seemed like the glittering hordes had made up a schedule to prevent them from getting away easily. “Remind me of this next time I think it’s a good idea to go on a business trip right before you go running off with SHIELD.”
are not going to tell him. You are not going to tell him
Tony banks hard, and hits two more rodents before catching Barton up and swinging back towards the train that has started rocking with the force of the rats trying to climb up it.
Pepper gives him a subtle poke in the back. “Walk,” she hisses.
“I do not agree with the senseless killing of beasts that are clearly not acting of their own volition,” Thor announces from somewhere – Steve assumes from the center of the lightning flickering near the perimeter, which is where he’s supposed to be. “But I will say stunning the creatures does not seem be working as one might hope, nor will they listen to reason.”
For a long minute, Steve says nothing, but he doesn’t look like he’s waiting for Tony to keep talking, he looks like he’s steeling himself for something.
Halfway through a meeting on quarterly projections, Tony’s phone goes off. The speaker stops awkwardly as everyone swings around to stare.
Steve stares blankly ahead for a long moment before comprehension dawns. “Our comms were on.” That’s mortifying. It makes Jarvis’s chilly disposition more understandable, though.
Steve’s mouth does the almost-smile thing again. “It should taste good, too,” he points out. “Just be careful not to burn yourself.”
“Can’t complain,” Steve allows, and tries on a bit of a smile of his own.
“Thank you,” Steve says, only a little stiffly, after a tense moment. “We shouldn’t have been –”
Pepper hums noncommittally, but otherwise ignores him. It’s not particularly comforting.
Now, Tony lets Steve lever him out of the limo and onto the red carpet, photo-ready smile looking too comfortable on his face. As soon as Tony is fully visible, the flashes go from familiarly annoying to blinding, and the hum of voices shouting for their attention swells to a mind-numbing roar. It takes all of Steve’s training not to flinch, or duck back into the limo, or just take off down the street on foot.
Steve grits his own teeth. “War Machine, Iron Man, I need you both on the perimeter.”
“I’m ready, I’m ready,” Tony feels like he’s been ready for ages, feels the strain in his muscles from trying to keep still, trying not to thrust up or push down.
Steve flinches, braces himself, and steps through the door. “Tony?” he calls, then again, louder. Tony doesn’t answer. Steve moves farther into the room, which looks like nothing so much as a futuristic car garage, and calls Tony’s name a third time.
The mission itself only lasted three days, plus another half-day on each end for travel, but by the time Steve gets back to the Tower after debriefing at SHIELD, he feels like he’s been gone for a month. He’s a little surprised at himself, but he also realizes he’s missed Tony while he was gone.
It’s short work to get through the crowds. Heads turn to watch them go, but no one stops them. “Walk with purpose, and don’t make eye contact,” Tony has said more than once, and it never fails to surprise Steve how well it works.
“No, I do.” Tony pauses, looks like he’s considering, and then, “Thanks.”
“It was your suggestion, was it not?” Thor asks.
Colonel Rhodes is waiting in the hangar with Tony and Banner. Thor comes in on Steve’s heels, and Natasha and Clint are only a minute behind.
Back on the street he doesn’t even pause to think, just lets his feet carry him away from the apartment block. He wonders if this will be the last time he does this, here, or if he’ll end up moving back when the whole sham marriage is over, whensoever that might be. What’s ‘some time,’ anyway? A few months? Years? Do they even know? Does it matter? Maybe he’ll stay at the Tower. If everyone else is moving in, he should probably be with them, but maybe there won’t be a place there for him after this ends, figuratively or literally.
– alligators now infesting the sewers of New York. “They’re just giant compared to, well, us.”
“I did
Ms. Potts does something with her phone. “I got it. Thank you.” She looks up at Clint and Natasha, who are still eating by the counter. “Why don’t you two sit, and we can get started?” She pulls up a seat for herself next to Steve while Clint and Natasha array themselves opposite. “Tony?”
“There’s blueberry in there for you,” Steve tells Tony, who is still leaning against the far counter, a coffee mug in one hand and a slightly bemused expression on his face.
ever he’s pretty sure Steve intended “– and you have to just grin and bear it?”
Natasha’s lips give an answering twitch.
“Oh,” Steve feels his face heat up slightly and hopes he’s not flushing. “Well, it’s nice to meet you, Dummy, I’m Steve.” He holds out a hand automatically, and immediately feels foolish. “Uh –”
Pepper frowns. “And you haven’t talked to him since?”
Tony grins wider.
“I should hope not,” is Coulson’s shockingly tart rejoinder. “Review those files, Captain, and don’t forget your after-action report.”
Not the greatest dinner conversation, but, Steve figures, at least they’re less likely to start an actual fight over their appetizers.
sounds ridiculous, even in Steve’s head.
Tony snorts a laugh, and shuts off the water.
“Problem, lovebirds?” he asks, facemask popping up, tone very pointedly light.
There’s the sound of typing, followed by Bruce’s, “Nothing new coming in here.”
a little crazy. But now, when the nightmares come, when these attacks sneak up on him, it’s like he’s lost signal, somehow, and all he can hear or see or think is static. Static and pinpricks of light in darkness. Galaxies far, far away, full of hostile, sentient beings just biding their time. Until what, he doesn’t know, and the static just screeches loudly, preventing anything more than
Natasha swallows her bite before speaking. “We moved in yesterday after the meeting.”
“Tony.”
Steve gets the shield up just in time to deflect a repulsor beam away before it scores him. He opens his mouth to curse Tony out, because
“You’re going last,” she says.
“Nah,” Steve grins. “Peggy shot at me once just because I’d been kissing another gal. I don’t know what she’d have done if I was carrying around some other dame’s picture.”
Pepper shows up in the lab to summon Tony back to the conference room. Not that Tony doesn’t appreciate the soothing balm of her presence, but it’s a rather underhanded trick, sending her in. He would have shown up on his own. Probably. If he’d remembered. As it is,
That startles an actual laugh from Tony. “You’re sounding like a computer,” he says.
“Excuse me?” Steve isn’t sure he actually wants clarification.
“Not what I meant,” Steve tells him, though he’d put money on Fury knowing that.
Part of Tony wishes he hadn’t said anything, had let Steve keep thinking whatever it was he’d been thinking before. Had left it all well enough alone. Because now Tony knows Steve wasn’t just being impressively discreet, he wasn’t doing anything he needed to be discreet about, and now he has pretty much free rein.
Tony looks startled, fully invested now. “What –” he starts, but Steve cuts him off before he can get the question out.
“You’re still hiding something,” Steve says, but he sounds more tired than combative.
“Of course, Ms. Potts,” Coulson’s tone matches Pepper’s. “I will inform Agent Barton.” Coulson pauses, then adds, “Though he is likely to hear it from Agent Romanoff as soon as she is made aware.”
“Look who’s talking!” Tony can’t believe the hypocrisy. “You’re always pissed at me
In response, Steve carefully disentangles their fingers, then drapes his arm over Tony’s shoulders, hoping it looks casual and not as glaringly awkward as it feels. He maybe should have thought this through before attempting it. He can feel Tony’s huff more than hear it – though whether in irritation or amusement he can’t tell – and then Tony’s shifting against him until they’re pressed together all down one side, Steve’s arm at a much more comfortable angle around Tony’s shoulders, and Tony’s own arm slipping around Steve’s waist. Under his jacket. Steve twitches.
Tony turns to see Pepper as she moves to lean against the railing next to him. “What?”
Steve doesn’t say anything for long enough that Tony risks another glance up at him. Steve is just sitting, cradling his own cup and watching Tony. When Tony meets his eyes, he nods, like he was waiting for it. “You, too,” he says, though Tony’s not sure for what. Maybe Steve also needed a distraction. A task.
apartment unless the whole team is involved, and now he’s there, in their common living spaces, every time Tony is. Mostly, though, it’s just… pleasant.
“I would never –” Steve starts, but Ms. Potts cuts him off.
Regardless of why Steve’s been doing it, the extra attention has Tony on edge. It has him wary in a way the snapping and yelling and disappointed looks hadn’t. And while Tony doesn’t
“What?” Tony frowns.
“It was an idealistic thing,” Steve explains, still clearly trying to sound serious. “Intellectual abilities and control over irrationality and animalistic impulses.”
Tony opens his mouth to lecture – because this is not behavior he can condone – but he’s cut off by an alarm on the main speakers and his phone vibrating its way across his desk where he’d thrown it while he showered.
Tony glances sideways at Steve, clocks how red his face must be, and, for a split second, his expression slips, something oddly like guilt showing through, before Tony’s usual press smile returns. “You know me,” Tony says glibly.
“No,” Tony admits, and thankfully doesn’t have to elaborate as the server returns to take their orders.
Tony feels a little sick to his stomach, from Steve’s words, and his own, and he
And that’s just it. Tony snaps. “I was thinking about someone besides myself!” he hisses, faceplate retracting so he can give Steve the full power of his glare. He shakes his own arm at Steve, because if the chomped-on armor is what he’s so pissed about, well, Tony got it preventing him from becoming alligator chow. “I was thinking about you, you jackass. Not that you’d recognize what that looks like, anymore. You don’t give a damn about anyone here, don’t bother to get to know anyone, or let anyone get to know you. Is there even anyone who knows you well enough to care about you?”
Rhodey gives him a wry grin. “Could have fooled me,” he says, tone light and only a little forced. “You certainly look the part.”
They look at each other, and Tony really hates when they do that, but the end result is they go.
Tony swallows, throat suddenly dry. He knows it’s just lust, but he wants to keep that look on Steve’s face for as long as he can.
“Indeed, Sir, but I would venture a guess that he was not aware his clothing was being donated for charitable purposes.”
“Sleep with, have sex with, do the horizontal tango, whatever you want to call it,” Tony’s gesturing with his hands, but Steve’s pretty sure the motions don’t actually mean anything. “Regardless, just get that signed, and everything will be just swell.”
Tony frowns, because that can’t be right. He’s sure Steve knew that the suits they wore for highly publicized red carpet events were bought outright instead of lent by designers specifically for the purpose of being able to sell them afterwards. But maybe – maybe Steve’s reaction makes more sense if he hadn’t known.
quite covers it either.”
“No,” Coulson replies. “Actually, none of you need to be here right now. Cap, Stark, we’ll be in touch to brief you in a couple hours, so stay on premises. The rest of you can go. We’ll keep you updated when you’re needed.”
Steve is already nodding. “Keep Hulk out of it while we have hostages in an enclosed area. Do we have numbers?”
But Coulson’s nodding. “A marriage is infinitely more believable. And it is far less likely to end up accidentally offending the people you are trying to help when it ends. A broken engagement could easily come off as a mockery as well as a publicity stunt, whereas a failed marriage is an attempt at permanence, and then two people who didn’t work the way they’d thought they would at the start of the thing. Divorce rates aren’t as high as people tend to believe, but they are still fairly high, especially for high profile couples. The marriage would have to last for some time, though, to prevent any negative backlash regarding divorce rates among same-sex couples, since they are significantly lower than with heterosexual marriages.”
Tony’s smile is sharp. “Oh, I am. Can’t really argue with the results, I’ll give Saint Nick that, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want him to feel it. It’ll just be more fun to watch Natasha do it. The woman is an artist.”
“I meant,” Steve says slowly, like he’s trying to be very careful with his words, like he knows how thin the ice is right now, “that I wasn’t doing anything that was worthwhile. There are plenty of things that are important, that are necessary – I know Stark Industries does a lot of good in the world – but I didn’t have anything else. I
“It can’t all be bad,” Mr. Cooper says. “I do have internet access, you know, and I see some of the nice stuff getting sent your way.”
Coulson taps the table. “An engagement won’t work,” he says. “It will have to be an actual marriage.”
Steve just shrugs. “Pretty sure he’d have to care for me to break him, anyway. I’m never sure he cares enough for anyone to break him. World threats, sure, but a single person?” Steve shrugs again, then eyes Fury speculatively. “Except maybe Ms. Potts?”
They wind up outside, and it’s familiar and not, doing this, the two of them. It’s dark away from the buildings, too far from any city to even get the light pollution that’s so much less now, anyway.
“You want me to come downstairs to your workshop and just. Talk to you?” Steve asks, wonders if he missed something important, or just Tony’s tendency to ramble when he’s uncomfortable.
“We’ll have SHIELD teams do more thorough sweeps of the trains and the tunnels,” Coulson puts in. “If the rats are actually gone, your team is clear, Cap. I’ll let you know when we’re done here, and we can debrief at HQ.”
“I would never –” Steve sputters, and then realizes Tony’s joking. Or mostly joking. It’s not always easy to tell, and Steve can see the way Tony’s shoulders are tense, like he’s trying not to hunch in, and is clinging to a lifetime of training to continue looking casual. “What’s wrong?” he asks abruptly.
The sound of Tony swearing comes loud and clear over the comms, then the whine of the repulsors as he gets himself back under control.
Tony snorts. “I don’t doubt you’ll survive it, I was more concerned with the manner of your survival.”
“Thank you,” Ms. Potts smiles. “There are a couple twitchy bits, and I’d like to have it set to sign before we hand it off to legal, since they’ll have so little time with it.”
Tony waves it off. “Just proves the posters work.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Jarvis.”
Coulson clears his throat in a way that should be unassuming, but somehow makes everyone sit up and turn to him. “Thank you,” he says, once he has everyone’s attention. “We’ll try to make this as quick and painless as possible, and then you can return to your regularly scheduled morning pursuits.”
Tony tips his head to eye Steve over the tops of his sunglasses. It’s possible Steve has been a little judgmental of Tony’s ever-present sunglasses in the past, especially at night, but now he’s rethinking his stance on them, and wishing he had a pair of his own. They clearly have their uses, such as dealing with a mob of photographers. Their fake dates that first week had been nothing like this. “You look ready to bolt,” Tony tells him frankly.
Pepper makes a face like she’s chewing on the inside of her cheek, but she doesn’t contradict him, and, for that, he’s thankful. “Get some sleep,” is all she eventually says. “I know you’re working,” she continues before he can say it. “But you need to sleep.”
to attend with the board. He’s halfway across the kitchen en route to his bedroom before he realizes he has company.
he tells himself.
“Wonderful, you’re here,” she says as soon as she spots him.
“Stark’s a good guy,” Coulson says, as if that might be a concern. “Brash and reckless, but good. You know that.”
Pepper sighs. “If you can’t do this – no,” she holds up a hand before Tony can even open his mouth, “don’t interrupt. And don’t just brush this off. If you
Every morning, Steve has been in the kitchen when Tony has shuffled through in search of coffee. He’s always had his own mug in front of him, sometimes breakfast or the remnants of it as well, and been somehow occupied, either reading or drawing, so there’s no indication he’s actively been waiting for Tony or anything like that, but he’s said good morning in a way that sounds like he actually means it, and asked how Tony slept – or
“Oh, well,” now Tony frowns. “It just made sense that she would have, when she and Pepper were going over the pre-nup and everything with you. Made sure you were aware you had options, that you wouldn’t be stuck a monk for however long this charade has to last. You didn’t go anywhere with that woman earlier, so I thought maybe you didn’t have the paperwork, and Jarvis said you hadn’t asked for a copy since you moved in, so I just. Brought the paperwork to you. So there wouldn’t have to be a repeat of tonight. Last night. It’s morning now, I think.” He glances at the window, but it’s still dark outside.
Tony’s looking at him again, frowning slightly, fingers gone still. “Sitwell? Not Coulson?”
That’s not at all what Steve thought she was going to say. He opens his mouth to protest, because he might not have any idea what’s going on, but he knows Tony’s not weak, and she cuts him off before he can get anything out.
“When was the last time he did more than nap?” Steve clarifies, cutting Jarvis off.
“No, Tony,” Steve cuts him off, isn’t sure if Tony’s genuinely confused or deflecting, but either way, Steve wants a straight answer from him. “Wrong with you. Right now,” he clarifies before Tony can launch into a laundry list of his own defects, or come up with some sort of witty “I’m perfect and this is why” barb. “What is bothering you right now?”
Tony’s fingers squeeze briefly around Steve’s, and Steve realizes they’re still holding hands. He supposes that’s what they’re meant to be doing, and wonders all in a flash what this looks like from the outside.
“The fuck it will,” the words are a snarl, and Tony’s jaw clenches as soon as they’re out. He needs to stop this. Of all people, Steve doesn’t need Tony’s million and one neuroses thrown in his face, especially when he’s clearly dealing with something himself. Tony would have to be blind not to have noticed the tension Steve has been carrying around in the weeks since their debut, the way he draws in on himself and sometimes seems somewhere else entirely when the paparazzi start shouting and taking picture after picture. Tony’s pretty sure it’s the flashing lights more than the noise, but he’s not positive, and Steve seems determined to pretend nothing’s wrong. At least with Tony. That probably shouldn’t hurt as much as it does. And now it’s the middle of the night and Tony’s practically yelling at him. Tony turns away, back to the table, wraps his hands around his mug.
“And I still think there must be another way,” Rhodey says for what must be the millionth time now. “Marriage or leaving the team aren’t your only options.”
“I appreciate your concern,” Steve says, as sincerely as he can, because Tony’s still watching him like he’s trying to decide if Steve is about to break apart, but also because it’s true, and Steve’s gradually becoming convinced that not only will Tony continue to brush off deserved apologies, but he’s unlikely to accept straight out gratitude, either. That being the case, Steve’s going to have to find other ways to fix things, and letting Tony know that Steve recognizes what Tony’s doing for him, and being better about doing his part at these dog and pony shows, is as good a place as any to start.
Tony beams up at her. “You’re a peach.”
“I spent my life being told I couldn’t do
“Well,” Natasha considers him for a moment, pausing her work, before taking up her task again with extra vigor. “We don’t live here, anymore.”
“– find a way to spin this,” Fury is saying, and Steve realizes the conversation has continued without him. “If we’re convincing enough, this whole thing ought to blow over, and we can go back to dealing with
“Avengers alert, sir,” Jarvis announces, and pulls up security feeds and shaky cellphone footage on the holographic screens. “It would appear there are giant rodents holding several subway lines hostage.”
“B train is clear, I’m coming your way to cover the 4,” Steve says, then, “Widow?”

“It could be a business party,” Tony points out. “At least half of our investors are in there getting trashed to the sounds of the Star Spangled Banner.”
“Doesn’t stop them printing
Ms. Potts eyes him for a moment, hands going still against her tablet, and Steve hadn’t even realized she’d been tapping it until she stops. It’s possible he’s spent so much time around Tony at this point he’s been desensitized to incessant fidgeting. “I don’t think we’ve really had a moment alone to talk before,” she says, and she sounds oddly formal. She also hasn’t clarified why it’s a problem for Tony to go to dinner.
building weapons again, and what the relationship is between this body armor and the Iron Man armor.”
Rhodey rolls his eyes. “I’m sure it will all be fine. I’m worried about
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony pants against Steve’s mouth, swallows Steve’s reply, and then he’s shaking apart, scarcely registers when Steve goes still above him, following him over.
The ringing of his phone – loud in the stillness of the studio – is startling enough that Steve almost jumps. He fumbles the phone out of his pocket, and swears. It’s Coulson. Steve definitely should have checked in hours ago. He wonders if they debriefed without him, or if they were waiting to hear from him.
"Trick or treat!"
"Nothing serious," Banner said, and gave Tony a meaningful look. "Tony was just about to call Happy and ask him to take him home. Right, Tony?"
