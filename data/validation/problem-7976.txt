The last syllable stretches into a quiet moan, and Steve's buried in him to the hilt. Tony moves against him to check. Yeah, no more leeway there. Balls to ass.
worth this with every stroke, that there's something so intrinsically desirable about who Tony is it won't matter either way what the decades bring because he just wants
The stern look she gets must be one she's familiar with and has grown to respect, because the girl's stance loses some of its confidence in wake of the emotion Tony's disapproving frown communicates. She doesn't avoid looking at him, but shrugs and says, "I wanted to know what was going on. You think I don't notice when you're like this, but I do."
"Like I don't know."
The first face he spots is Tony's. He's flooded with instant relief and only so refrains from exhaling audibly.
invaded the Iron Castle. Admittedly, it had been a spur-of-the-moment decision, but she believed she now had a point to prove.
"It was, uh, nice, though," Bruce said, briefly glancing at everyone in the room to see their nods of agreement. "I mean, if you guys ever feel like repeating this, I don't think any of us would decline."
"I loathe to remind you, beloved, but if I had not embraced this one particular opportunity so many years ago, we would not be sitting here."
Despite the fact that coffee must run in Tony’s veins at this point, the tolerance to caffeine he’s likely built up a few decades ago prevents it from changing anything about his stage of wakefulness. He lounges in the chair, carding his hands through his already mussed up hair and makes no attempt at moving; Steve takes it upon himself to clean up the table, seeing as it’s the least he can do.
On the horizon, Lord Wayne's yellow banners flapped in the wind as his party approached. To their right, men of old Lord Xavier's held his dark red sigil high and proud, and on the left, Lady Everheart's Justice Guard came riding on blinding white steeds. Even Lord Von Doom had made an appearance, his troops clad in forest-green armor already storming onto the battlefield to aid the weakened King's Guard and Klynn's Lord Pym against the hostile forces.
Talk about the hard truth. He'd have thought the city smell had finally worn off after all this time in Red Rock, but it seems luck isn't on his side. Hell, he knows he's mighty unprepared for something like this, not only because he has practically zero experience with both cattle and land, but also because his physique hasn't exactly thanked him for his activities in the recent past.
"You can admit it, you know? It worked. You'd have never made that shot if I hadn't been there playing well-lit bait."
Not wanting to miss the bodily contact, Steve leans over him, blanketing Tony’s body with his own as he starts a quicker pace. It’s still not optimal, seeing as he can barely pull out without abandoning his initial position, but it’ll do.
“Hi,” Tony says. He looks off to the side, seemingly in thought, before his gaze shifts back to Steve. The more details he takes in, there more obvious it gets that something’s off. There’s a distinct frown in Tony’s features, and his eyes are wide and glassy for a reason Steve has yet to find out.
The Lord made a point of meeting the other's gaze during the last of his words, his smile softer than maybe he himself realized.
With these words, she spoke her goodbye and took a right at the next corridor, approaching a set of stairs and disappearing from view a beat later.
That much he had earned, at least.
Although the guilt taking hold of him is unreasonable, Steve can't help but feel responsible. It's hard not to, witnessing the way Tony muffles his sobs in his fist in a last ditch effort to conceal his cries and curls in on himself tighter with every tremble that passes through his body. He wants to put a hand on his shoulder, pull him close and provide comfort, but where before the intimacy came naturally, it now feels like an invasion of privacy.
Not that he's planning to kick the bucket up there.
Soon enough, he was positively slurring, stumbling over words and swallowing vowels like gulps of his beverage. Inebriated, his tongue became looser than it had been even in its natural state; Natasha lifted her head to listen for the first time that night as he spoke.
After that, Rogers shakes him a last time and backs off, and Tony can only do so much to catch himself and not fall on his ass with the force of his push. The other man walks past him, attention suddenly directed elsewhere, and falls down onto one knee next to the cowering shape of an animal lying in the snow.
, and if there was one thing everyone knew, it was that he loved sex and flaunting his sexuality whenever he saw fit, and this most definitely was such an occasion.
She nodded, “Indeed. Now, be good and escort yourself there, will you? There seem to be a million things that require my attention today and it is not even noon yet.”
And he doesn't know where that notion came from, is positive it wasn't there a moment ago, but now it is and he
Having drained the last drops of coffee, Tony shoots him an expectant look over the brim of his cup, waiting for an explanation.
Get me all worked up 'n messy, with it, with your–
"No.” The word is deathly quiet. Both his hunched posture and small voice are so unlike everything Tony knows about Steve Rogers it throws him for a loop. "But the first time I understood what you were,
Of course, retrieving the Tesseract from the past and hoping it’ll take him back just like that is nothing more than a shot in the dark, but Steve for one prefers taking that shot over sitting idle and accepting his being stuck here with a shrug of indifference. That’s not who he is, was, or ever will be. Standing on the sidelines isn’t something he’s able or willing to do.
If there's one quality about him that's not a scam, it's that Tony Stark always has an ace up his–not always the
If anything, that gets Steve even more ramped up. After a last, heady tongue-to-tongue that leaves Tony lightheaded, he moves up on his knees completely, pounding into him at an angle that has him grazing his prostate once every few thrusts. It would never be enough for an orgasm, but it's just the right amount to keep him stimulated and enjoying the action through a low-simmering pleasure.
The lot of them shouldn't be a match for Thanos and they're not, but for a moment... Tony gets his hopes up. And he should know by now that that is a fatal mistake.
right, because he always does. Or maybe the Tesseract screwed with his hearing while sending him through dimensions, but that seems unlikely. Because Tony’s undoubtedly saying what Steve’s hearing him say. There’s be some grave differences in how humans work in this world, he’s known and expected that to be the case since Tony had JARVIS compile all that information, but he’s not expected – this.
They've made that observation many times before, bumping into strangers and other groups of survivors that turned from friend to foe at the drop of a hat. It's why it has been only the two of them, Tony and Steve against the living and the dead, for years on end now.
It doesn’t matter that he crawls away on all fours to bring distance between them, with the drugs already in his bloodstream. And sure enough: When Stark tries to rise, he tumbles like he's three sheets to the wind and then keels over again, crash-landing on his hands and knees. One of his hands is metal but the other one is flesh, and it bleeds when it skits over the graveled concrete.
The mare is taking the brunt of it, really. She's huffing as she climbs steadily up the rocky path like an ibex, almost dragging the mules behind her by force. They've got no choice but to follow, at least until a point in the near future when his horse's strength will eventually start to dwindle.
Might be some part of his subconscious thinks itself safe now that he's finally not a bachelor in his forties anymore, even though Tony as a whole should know better and no cubic inch of his being should fall for these kinds of pretenses. It isn't safe;
They sent Mar’vill’s guard back to home pastures – all but six capable swordsmen who would ensure the Lord remain safe on his travels.
And when he walked in on his friend fervently kissing the stable boy with all the clumsiness of a young love one morning, James understood why.
The injured shoulder sends a spike of pain zipping through him with every step he takes toward the back entrance of the house, the front boarded up entirely to hide their presence from the odd traveller crossing through these parts. Steve makes himself embrace the pain, commits the discomfort to memory until a shadow of it lingers. This only scratches the surface of the agony he deserves to have coming his way, he thinks–and feels ashamed of it in the very same moment.
Steve revels in the perverse pleasure that comes from watching Stark freeze in momentary shock at the promise. No, this isn't just a once-off encounter. Steve will see to it.
“Go on,” Steve says, close enough his breath tickles Tony’s ear and pulls him gently out of his musings. Where was he? Tony doesn't remember, and he can’t say that Steve finally,
He must’ve dozed off at some point, because the next time he opens his eyes, Tony’s perched on top of him, supported on his own crossed arms and watching him. Steve smiles at the sight of him, sliding both arms around the man’s waist.
he threatened to disown that day. Howard died an early death and left his legacy for Tony to do with as he pleased, and here he is, drowning his sorrows after everything crashed and burned in his wake. This, here? It's a small price to pay for revenge. Revenge on a dead man, but revenge nevertheless. Or that's what Tony tells himself, anyway.
"It's called a… subliminal message, I believe. Thought you smart city folk would know all about that."
"Yup."
And he's aware he should hand Stark over, complete the mission as it were, but he feels as though his own end goal isn’t quite the one it was. A conflict of interest, you could call this: what reason does he have to dance to Pierce's tune to be granted another taste when he already
He's promptly reminded of the Red Skull, who disappeared from the Valkyrie in the same circumstances Steve finds himself in now, and he can't quite keep the panic at bay. Frankly, he has no desire at all to end up taking the Skull's place on that godforsaken planet.
His voice is raspy, almost like a purr, and – really, there’s just so much Steve can take. Super-soldier or no, at the end of the day, he’s only human.
At fourteen, James fell for a fierce blonde and was mocked (albeit amicably) by his best friend when he retold her reaction to his rather bold proposition. Carol, so her name, had only made a face that undoubtedly spoke for itself and then advised the boy in a surprisingly polite tone that he still had many a thing to learn if he ever hoped to convince any one girl of himself.
"This is a waste," she remarks casually as she stands, pushing her chair in. She's openly observing Tony now, shaking and keening as he continuously fails to lift himself on Steve's cock fast enough to build a rhythm. All of Tony's focus is on the task and hand; he either doesn't notice her eyes on him or has stopped caring.
Night time is more troubling. When Tony does fall asleep, it isn't restful for either of them. Same as the weeks prior, Steve's sleep is often disrupted by frantic movements and agonized whimpers uttered thanks to the hellscape that is the man's nightmares.
In reality, Lord Stark spent the following days in and out of consciousness and although his life was no longer hanging by a thread, he was in no condition to interact with anyone longer than his continued well-being required.
“But you just won the lottery, because I know a lot more things Stone doesn’t. I can take you wherever you need to go
"How about we ride up to the cabin? Once my foot has healed, of course. Make up for lost time?" he suggested, smiling and tilting his head to gauge Steven's reaction. "We've been wanting to go there forever, have we not? The both of us, alone. It would be a few days at the most."
They get overrun, as has been the case many times prior, on their way back. Steve feels as if he should’ve seen it coming a mile away–everything’s been going to smoothly, the streets too quiet, the supplies much too plenty, the buildings devoid of hostiles both living and undead. It only makes sense for whatever cosmic force responsible for the workings of the universe to finally make up for what it’s been sparing them of hardship in the past couple of hours.
When he looks up, his gaze isn’t drawn to Tony but instead to Wanda right across the table. Tony doesn’t know if he’s imagining it, but he could swear he feels her subdued anxiety thrum through the rest of them.
With the door falling close, it’s eerily quiet but for a few mumbles from the back. The man on the ground, having curled into a ball previously, slowly sits up again, not entirely able to suppress a groan. He holds his injured side with one hand while the other clutches the cloth that’s slipped out of place, only barely covering his privates.
“C’mon. Could’ve been worse,” Steve answers. (There is no such thing as a jinx, but later, he’ll think it anyway, that this passing remark is somehow the catalyst of a misfortune that has found them some long minutes prior.)
"Did you get a haircut?"
The thought is accompanied by a scoff aimed at his own inanity. Like time itself, this measurement is a construct that doesn’t hold power over the vast emptiness of space. None of it has real meaning once you step past the boundaries of planet Earth; days, weeks, months. What’s a year when time passes differently depending on where you are in the universe? Time isn’t a constant.
"It's funny, because I thought you were the same, almost, but," he laughs quietly to himself, "you're different, and it helps. With the remembering."
"It is
Finally, he deigns to rearrange their position and rolls them to the side, now facing the mirror full on–Tony couldn't have moved on his own even if he wanted to. Part of him is convinced his joints and muscles have changed their chemical makeup and physically turned to goo, because there's no other explanation that makes sense at the current time.
"Pheromone concentration in the air indicates an unusual absence of such, which leads me to believe that this individual is devoid of designation, as we know to be the case with Thor and various other otherworldly beings we have encountered."
Steve sighs deeply, a noise laced with feigned disappointment, and wonders if he sounds as gratified as he feels when he says, "We agreed on something, Tony."
need some. And if they get it for us no questions asked, there’ll be even more in it for them.”
much better, because it causes Tony to moan and close his eyes at the feeling. Strangely, the way his eyelids flutter shut is what does it for Steve; for a moment, Tony is still, the fragility of his life captured in a timeless memory.
With a jolt, he backs away, the noise of his retreating footsteps loud in Steve's ears.
Everything was bliss for a few endless moments that turned out to be finite after all.
The strange device left behind by Fury brings a glowing woman whose powers are unlike anything they've ever encountered, and she does the impossible.
when Steve obliges. (Tony is sure he would've shoved back in with the exact same amount of force even if Tony hadn't asked, which only fuels his want.)
He hurts with it in the long nights, in the rare moments there’s nothing to drown out the silence of his home and the noise in his mind. There comes the time he can’t bear it any longer: he slips into Steve’s old office and looks at his shield leaning there and rips open the letter he’s abandoned in the desk drawer. He can barely
Well, almost. Whatever it did, it'll have sent him to this exact location for a reason. A reason that is, Steve can only imagine, linked to Tony Stark in some way or another.
The Cilento Coast is a colorful dichotomy of rocky cliffs and endless cliffside beaches, with all the same charme of Amalfi but plagued by only a fraction of the tourists flocking to the more popular regions of Salerno.
"Whatever you want, beautiful."
mercy, not the other way around.
If there was no smith available, he would forge the blade himself. If there was no knight to wield the sword, he would ride into battle alone. If the fight was not to be settled without a sacrifice, he would lay down his own life.
Peter had tried not to stare at the two visitors as he stood behind the counter, washing the seemingly never-ending supply of used mugs and plates.
When it gets warmer, they'll follow a footpath to a weather-worn staircase nestled into the rock of the cliff. This bay doesn’t get any visitors but the two of them and they make the most of it: Tony forgot his swim trunks once and he's forgone them ever since. Out here, you can taste the ocean on the back of your tongue and the salt on your skin. (In all fairness, Steve’s tastes like sunscreen more than anything, but Tony isn't about to be deterred.)
“Well, Sir Rogers, I suppose I should be thanking you. Had I been made to listen to this fool for a minute longer, the ensuing bloodbath would've been sure to disturb the day's peaceful celebrations."
at the front-desk worker politely bidding them goodbye a minor incident), Tony drives them home in the Audi.
JARVIS’ voice emerges from its speakers without any prior warning; Steve only winces a little.
Tony looks almost curious now, urging him to go on as he leans back in his chair and settles in to listen. So, Steve clears his throat and gets ready to talk.
Everything that keeps Tony away from his now hidden stash under the sofa is the thought that if he guzzles it all now, he won’t have any later, and there is no telling if he can even get his hands on more. They’ll meet one of Cannon’s men halfway down the mountain for supplies and feed for the animals every week, but Tony doubts any of them will be inclined to send more booze up there with him even if he asks nicely.
The man returns the smile, a genuinely amused one that falters with time and turns into a lopsided smirk when he processes Tony's words and takes the earnestness in them for what it is.
But then, the sky opens and alights with sparks. He watches as the lost heroes emerge from dozens of portals and it might be one of the most beautiful things he's ever had the fortune of witnessing.
The punch doesn’t hit. Tony feels the misplaced air zip by his cheek.
"I didn't have a single picture of my Ma after I woke up from the ice, but it didn't matter. She's still there. It's… not so much about remembering every excruciating detail than it is about moments you had, experiences you shared. What you felt. Those are things you never forget."
Tony hates having his chest exposed most of all, yet the dimly glowing center that is his heart is at full display now, the fur blanket draped over the side of the chair. Steve can practically feel the effort with which he resists the urge to twist away and hide from her intrusive stare.
“Pervert,” Tony mutters into the pillow. There’s a smile in his voice.
He noticed. Of course. The long looks and contemplative gazes wouldn't go past anyone, and Tony even less so. Steve figures he's always been a lot less subtle than he assumed he was.
They return to the Avengers' temporary headquarters with heavy hearts.
“You know, me and my father… we didn’t agree on many things. In fact, I am positive he is rolling in his grave as I speak,” the Lord chuckled, a dry and humorless sound, looking up at the once-live man that was leveling them with an austere gaze from the oil painting on the wall in front of them. It was the late Lord Howard, in all his hard-mannered, unsmiling glory.
hovering above them, this is how it ends?
He wonders if the Avengers could've been something like this, or if they were always doomed to drift apart.
maybe, just like the rest of them.
A wave of nausea is rolling in his gut, but Steve doesn't let it overcome him. With a deep breath, he clenches his teeth and keeps going.
Tony sells the beach house on such short notice the quote he gets should be considered theft.
The task kept her thoughts away from the matter at hand for a while, but the vivid images in her head soon became too prevalent to ignore. In truth, she felt discomforted rather than surprised. Lord Stark's tastes were an open secret amongst the people inside the castle gates, and that Sir Rogers was the man to meet those tastes – as Carol understood it, this was to be expected.
Steve feels himself recoil in surprise or maybe even shock. Just an inch or so – it shouldn't be too noticeable, but Stark's pointedly lifted eyebrow speaks volumes. He might be a liar, but damn if he isn't perceptive. It's almost funny; for a moment, Steve was almost convinced that there had to be something more to this man than just his unapologetic defiance.
Tony lowers his armored hand, but it's still tilted in Steve's direction in what is unmistakably a warning.
How could this horrible,
Tony likes to sit as far away from the broken window as possible. He hasn't grown accustomed to the temperatures and doubts he ever will. Really, he's positive nobody does; people just pretend to cope until eventually the cold seeps under their skin and into their bones and becomes bearable because it's part of them. Tony thinks there's a metaphor somewhere in there, but he's too far gone to think about it and come morning he won't remember, so why bother?
"Indulge me."
This is how he imagined it should be; primal, dirty, a continuous build toward a peak just out of reach. Salvation from this numbness that he's so used to taking his each and every sensation and wringing it out like a soaked rag until all the colors are gone. Sucked down the drain before he can get a glimpse.
The Lord himself had made his way down from the tribune in the meantime, bright fur cloak swinging behind him as he approached the men on the podium. Next to him walked a tall, blonde woman who was clad in leathers and ringmail and carried an impressive sword in her gloved hand.
As he bent down and reached for her hand to press a delicate kiss to her knuckles, Natasha wrenched his fingers from her with a practiced move that had the man stifling a pained cry. She smiled pleasantly and Lord Rhodes on her left hid his laugh behind a sudden coughing fit.
As soon as he notices, Steve gets what they'll need and picks Tony up from the bed, because he isn't about to wait and watch for something to happen. Tony can't bear to ask him outright, so he won't make him–even though Steve doesn't see the issue, because this is a biological imperative and there's nothing shameful about it. Steve’s already helped with the other thing, and much sooner at that because keeping him hydrated has been essential; everything Tony managed to do then was hide his face in Steve's shoulder while the rest was taken care of for him.
She only wished she had not been the one to be exposed to this rather private moment. At the same time still, she felt relieved.
Steve promises himself.
Stark bolts.
and that sensation is something that doesn't go unnoticed by his baser instincts. Even before he's gotten a proper look at the omega, he feels himself take interest, blood rushing south and cock hardening in his pants quicker than he might be comfortable admitting.
Refills were a much more frequent occurrence than he had accounted for in his calculation, and it didn’t even register with his brain. Well, no. It probably did. He just had no desire to acknowledge what was clearly happening, namely that he’s been falling off the wagon and is now paying the price.
Tony squeezes around his dick at the next push and the other man's motions lose their uniformity, his hips snapping forward reflexively as he sucks in a breath. Steve tries to conjure up a disapproving glare, but he's fooling no one. Tony feels his grip tightening, sees the sweat pooling in the hollow of his throat and his face screwing up minimally in concentration.
(And then, depending on the time of day, Steve will use this breakthrough as an excuse to finally drag him into bed, or Tony might come down from his inventing high and realize he could do with some human contact right about now, which will have him crawling into bed next to Steve (stinky, at an ungodly hour) and be caught in a tangle of limbs immediately because the man gravitates toward him even in sleep.)
No, Tony can't blind anyone anymore. Those days are over. He just wants– he wants someone to stay without having to blind them, stupid as it sounds. And although Steve has been that someone for those last, blissful years, it doesn't mean he can't still slip through Tony's fingers. It happened before, it can happen again.
Anthony, for one, did not mind the days on the road quite as much as he usually would. Lord Rhodes was under no delusion as to why this was the case: his friend and Rogers had taken to one another like ducks to water.
Weeks pass. Tony tells himself he’ll come out with it, but one day the bruises have faded and he shrugs it off.
At the end of the day, when he crawls into bed and grows evermore distressed with the fading scent in the pillow, safety is only a small comfort. His body certainly doesn't care, but he'll take everything he can get.
Tony's train of thought, just beginning to operate at normal capacity again, promptly screeches to a halt as his smile falters. It's only for a second, though, because then Steve adds,
The damage is done. Steve backs off, all the way to the outer edge of the other side of the bed, where he'll stay for every night to come. He promised he’d do whatever Tony needed him to, and considering Tony doesn’t trust him to be anywhere near, bringing distance between them is the least he can do.
“That’s
Stark’s push-and-pull motions immediately jerk to a halt, like thunderstruck. He turns his head to look at Steve out of the corner of his eye, the lack of distance between their faces only becoming noticeable now. “Because I didn’t want you to,” he says, flippant in a way that is clearly meant to distract from the red tinge in his cheeks. Steve isn’t sure if it’s to do with his still heightened body temperature or something else entirely, but he’s got a good guess.
FRI tells him it's something Os in general experience during pregnancy and not his sex-deprived mind suddenly demanding something large and phallic shaped up his ass. At the dawn of humankind, this hormonal change in an expecting omega's system served to ensure the continued survival of their offspring. A bonded omega would bind their alpha mate to them further, and an unbonded one would attract another A to protect and provide for them.
More importantly, he'll have to leave to get it cleaned and he doesn't trust the people in HQ with Tony; his latest attempt at escape would've succeeded were it not for Steve's untimely return.
Stark took this with a surprising amount of dignity. The wide smirk stretching his lips was immediate and genuine, his dark, pointy beard accentuating the angular shape of his face as if he considered her reaction intriguing and amusing rather than off-putting.
Softer. He's–softer.
. It wants to ride up into the mountains to herd damn cows in icy blizzards and hopefully not freeze his fingers off in the process. Unfortunately, Tony is under no delusions as to what caused him to acquire this unusual taste for adventure.
soldier.
but Steve ignored it in favor of leaning down and pouring his all into a kiss filled with deep affection that was for no one to feel but Tony.
has a decent sense of humor once you peel back that hardened outside layer?
This was answer enough. James nodded in thought and clasped his friend's shoulder for a last time.
If he can resist a specimen like Steve Rogers, he can resist watered-down whiskey.
Tony is sneaking back to the campsite, head still spinning with his most recent discovery, when the noises come.
The first thing he becomes aware of is more of a thought than a bodily sensation. Surprise. He didn’t think he would manage to fall asleep – he’d prepared to lie awake throughout the long hours of the night, thoughts looping inside his mind, prodding and never-ending. There was no more planning to do; they had it all figured out, every contingency and minute detail taken care of. Everything left to do now was hoping it’d work, even with the odds stacked so incredibly high against them.
Tony would like to wake up now. He shakes his head as if to get it out of his mind, recognizing the futility of the attempt. They come to a halt in front of the archway, the construction appearing taller now that they're closer. Steve's right hand flexes at his side, clearly on edge with the absence of his shield. Not thinking, Tony grabs his hand and intertwines their fingers. It's just as much for himself as it is for Steve -- the contact feels grounding.
Coming to a stand before the knight to be appointed Captain, Lord Stark urged the crowd to give another round of applause for the victor – and they did, screaming and whistling and stomping like a hoard of crazed boars.
The man falls to his knees like a puppet with no strings attached, fingers twitching, eyes wide and lips agape in a silent scream. His mouth opens and closes like a fish out of water, and when his trembling hands come up to clutch frantically at his chest and throat, the metaphor becomes reality.
to make more and use up a whole carton of eggs in the process, all without permission?
“I will give Mr. Stone your thanks,” Bain smiles, calculating gaze sweeping through the ranks and asserting dominance for a last time before she steps back, her expression pleased as she looks at the man at her feet. “Enjoy your stay, Anthony.”
He doesn't seem to be in pain when he goes. His last moments are, despite the tragedy of his sacrifice, rather peaceful.
“Do you think I’m crazy?”
"Do you want to tell me about it?" James asked, but could already see the other shaking his head in the corner of his eye. At least, this secret between them was no more, and for that alone he was grateful.
The first few times had been far from successful. Steve was– well, simply put, he was
The new angle is his undoing: Steve catches on his prostate with every other thrust. Tony spreads his legs, can’t do much else now that Steve's caged him like this. No escape, nowhere to go–it’s a thought that makes him shudder with pleasure.
When Bruce initially found himself under Anthony's regency, the first unwritten law of the Iron Castle soon rang loud and clear: do not ask Lord Stark for what reason the Man of Iron, Slayer of Thanos the Tyrant and Protector of the Kingdom of Shields needs to be escorted by the highest knight (and only the highest knight) in his guard on his rides through his very own lands.
Maybe the universe at large.
There's a short pause. Steve's fighting to keep the smile off his face.
To this day, Steve doesn’t have the least notion of where his hideout is located. There would be a great deal of useful information and prototypes to be discovered in that place, but he knows not to push his luck. The company wants Stark, they’ll get Stark. He isn’t doing additional homework to get a gold star on his resume. They never thought to write off more debt per target neutralized just because he was especially thorough.
Surprisingly, the first thing he says isn't directed at Steve. Instead, he turns to Maria, hands braced against his hips, and asks, "What are you doing up anyway, young lady?"
The mules are still beasts, and if you were one to believe that horses can express complex emotions, Tony would say Butterfingers' soft whinny and twitching ears speak of surprise and mild disgruntlement. Mostly in response to being woken earlier than usual, but a part of him also thinks that she doesn't agree with being an active participant in this endeavor.
One evening, they have a little get-together at the heap of turned-up earth and rubble that not so long ago was the compound. A final sendoff. There’s a little bonfire. It’s cozy.
"Thank God," someone says, close by. Very close by, in fact– Tony feels a gust of warm air brush past his cheek, and whoever said it is right there, and that line of warmth pressed along his back isn't a blanket like he's assumed. It would've been a strange blanket, anyway, huddled against his skin hot like a furnance.
It's a call for attention and Steve follows it, looks at Tony and everything that he is now: pale skin, sunken cheeks framed by wild stubble and black-blue shadows underneath muddy brown eyes that he thinks were honeycomb and whiskey and all other things alive and vibrant once, but where now instead of color there's only pain.
Tony flinches, hand flying to his chest. Steve shoots upright in record speed, stance wide and body taut in anticipation of an incoming attack. Their agitation is of no avail, however. The sky above is clear, the lake lies still and motionless as ever and the dunes all around have remained unchanged but for a light breeze stirring the sand.
The good old days.
When you're used to the mild weather and many commodities of the east coast, Wyoming is like a hook to the chin from a guy twice your size.
. But I won't, considering I practically begged you to let me tag along," he answers, looking over at Rogers whose stubble-framed mouth quirks into a half-smirk at the last part.
“First of all, which year? Please don’t tell me it’s a number with nineteen in front,” Tony says, waving at Steve’s clothing. Right. The disguise.
“Missed you, Tony,” Steve says. He's close, bowed over Tony’s back, his warmth surrounding him. The words have a reverent, desperate quality to them that makes something in Tony’s chest stir.
"Fine. So, what if someone else catches us? Somebody whose loyalty does not reach as far?"
Steve goes for the more obvious next. "He was taller. By that much, maybe," he says, holding his index finger and thumb about four inches apart. Tony voices a quiet
Steve's taken aback at the name of the A.I. Tony is addressing, but even more so when he hears the smooth, British voice respond from somewhere up in the ceiling.
or because she really thinks it's not fair to make you leave."
"I know."
"I didn't figure you this naïve, Tony," says another at his left, brushing a hand over his throat in a gentle threat. His breathing falters and stutters to a halt all on its own. Tony squeezes his eyes shut and tries to force air back into his lungs.
They're out of rhythm. Everything is uncoordinated and messy, but Tony bucks back against him and then Steve bows him further over the counter, and somehow it’s one of the hottest things he’s ever done. Steve’s hands fit themselves over Tony’s that are still gripping the edge of the counter for all he’s worth.
For Steve, this came as a somewhat unexpected development, considering he'd usually avoid letting anyone in on his emotional state, which included his deepest desires. On the other hand, this was
This is them. Right now, Tony can't think of a single way he could complement the picture any better than he already does.
Over the past years, it was rumored he had found a love in the gallant Ms. Potts, steward of the castle and Stark's most trusted counselor. While the news of a woman steward were unheard of, a secret affair between a common carpenter's daughter and her Lord would be considered simply outrageous.
He can't do this. He can't do this again.
"We scared them off is what matters, or not? I don't know about you, but I for one am looking forward to getting some shut-eye again."
Tony’s movements grow a little more frantic, back and forth and back again as if he can’t decide whether to seek the sweet friction of Steve’s hand around him or the slow drag of Steve’s cock over his crack. When Steve’s hold tightens and he twists his hand just so, Tony’s mouth falls open in a silent whimper, his head rolling back onto Steve’s shoulder.
that's–
What he mentioned about building the train proves true as well, in spite of how little they all initially believed it to be true. Looks like they fell for Stone's thorough brainwash just like everyone else did.
"It has to be–clones, or, or something in that ballpark, right? There's no other…" He starts typing furiously, pulls up reports and documents from missions past. "We thought we took care of their main operations, but what if we didn't, what if there's more?"
Steve's fingers curl around the glove, painfully digging into the metal. When he looks at Bucky, he sees him in a future with Sam, laughing and bickering and
"Okay. But I want three," she answers decidedly. Tony chuckles despite himself.
wouldn’t want it any other way. Not that he’s got any processing capacity left to contemplate alternate scenarios when all he can think about is the friction of Steve’s palm and the drag of the cock inside him.
The realization that there is nothing to do but sit and wait for time to pass comes with a certain amount of terror, at least for him. Rogers has been aware of the intricacies of this job from the beginning, and he takes the monotony of their existence in stride. Every day anew, he’ll come barreling down the stairs (Tony is
"Tragic thing is, now they'll report this waste of time to Fury and he's gonna stop and think to himself, well,
"You just sit," Steve tells him as another knock on the door announces the end of the five minutes. "If you so much as squirm, I expect you to go all the way and start fucking yourself in front of her."
"You can rest now," Pepper tells him.
Not when Steve's smiling at him like that, tender and eyes crinkling as he carefully studies Tony's shape before him. He's also tracing a line up and down Tony's side, over a small scar by his abdomen and up to his ribs. And it would be all nice and dandy just like this if Steve wasn't hard and his length
There's a momentary stinging sensation piercing his chest, and it feels not quite unlike that initial surge of energy searing his nerve endings whenever he put the arc reactor back in its casing. Something is holding him down too, restricting his breathing with an unfamiliar weight that is entirely unlike the reactor. And it's--moving?
Rogers' words bring him back to the here and now, his voice a rumble sending a shiver down Tony's spine as he feels the vibration of the man's chest against his naked back.
He didn’t prepare to see his end dying of thirst, starving, bleeding, galaxies upon galaxies away from home.
The years passed, and as they played and ran and joked together, they soon understood that with their growing bodies, their responsibilities grew as well.
Often, the moans were followed by a shudder, and Nat would purr an endearment or other into Tony's ear while she continued to tread her fingers through his sweat-soaked hair, fingernails scratching over his scalp.
He’s distantly aware his teeth are chattering, a
With a little force, Tony’s body gives and he slides in, slick and hot and
"You should go again."
Nothing else happens.
Tony doesn't break the silence again this time around, and since neither of them makes a move to bring some distance between their bodies, Steve becomes acutely aware of the lack of space. It's as if something in his brain refuses to give the command to make his legs move, because he seems to be stuck there, unable to get out of Tony's immediate vicinity or even look away from his dark eyes and blown pupils.
Luckily, nobody's around when he finds the fancy locker box he's supposed to place the Tesseract back into.
He isn’t stupid, he brought a supply – Rogers shot him a glare that was in equal measures disappointed and disbelieving when he found that the space in Butterfingers’ saddlebags was almost entirely taken up by booze – but that doesn’t mean he can go and drink himself into a stupor for just the one magnificent, albeit blurry, night.
Out of the two of them, it's Tony who moves.
cry out of sheer frustration. Then, after he hasn’t cried out of sheer frustration, he picks himself up and focuses on something other than the big picture for once.
He doesn't get to leave until some time later, when the man at the door receives instructions through the comms device in his ear – Steve can make out the voice on the other end perfectly well, and they're telling the agent now in charge of him to 'escort him to the office'.
The easy expression went as quick as it had come. Lord Stark cleared his throat and looked down at his tightly clasped hands in front of him. He sniffed and returned Peter's inquisitive gaze, the faint lines around his eyes suddenly more prominent.
and continues, "For a reason unbeknownst to me, she tells me that we can't kick you out. I don't know if she's arguing your case because you're, well,
How ironic and unsurprising. In the very end, it always comes down to him and Steve. Tony wonders if this is the universe’s way of taunting him for ever thinking he could truly escape Steve Rogers.
An overly optimistic part of him wants to take the card and rip it apart, but the more realistic one knows he can't take that chance. This is the only thing he has in this world if Tony ever wants him gone. Steve pockets the slip of paper and later puts it face down in the bottom drawer of his nightstand for safekeeping.
Peter felt his breathing grow labored as he listened to the words and seldom-shown emotion in Anthony’s voice. It was only after a moment of long silence that he spoke, turning to look at the other man who was still staring into the unblinking eyes of the Lord Stark that had come before him.
Tony wonders whether it'd be sensible to reason the size of other parts of Rogers' anatomy from the size of his hands.
Maybe, though, if he gives Steve just a little more, he’s going to get a proper handjob. And then, nothing will be standing between him and that orgasm anymore save for his own body–but he doesn’t think that’s going to be a problem tonight, what with how he could crawl out of his skin with pleasure.
Steve leaned over him, blanketing his body, and reached down to pull the ring off his straining cock, wet from the tip to the base and bouncing between his legs. He'd been aware it would be over soon after Tony would be free to reach his climax, but the speed at which it happened was still astounding. One moment, Tony was clawing at the sheets, bucking with a fervor to meet every single of Steve's thrusts, and the next–
Now however, Tony is able to make out his features in the dim light of the saloon, and the man is almost shockingly handsome. It's a strange sight. The west seems to turn even the prettiest people ugly, with its dirt and grime and sickness. And it's not like this one has been spared the worst of it: he's sunburnt and gruff too, with a split lip, a shadow of stubble on his jaw and an old scar on his temple. Somehow, though, that doesn't diminish the effect the deep blue of his eyes or the pink of his lips seems to have on Tony, and he has trouble looking away when the stranger lifts the bottle to his mouth and drinks.
That hatred fuels him like it does them all, like it does Steve, and it’s a strange thing to bond over. An ugly thing to share, but they do. Share it. Feed from it, like they do from the tasteless protein bars they’re handed, every day anew, grab your share and run, and
"Tony, I left you in the bedroom and came back fifteen minutes ago. We didn't have sex." When Tony only stares, he sighs. "I'm happy your wet dreams are so photorealistic, but you sound a little out of it right now."
Steve stays for the funeral and for one last goodbye, as they send a floral arrangement out onto the lake. An old arc reactor is perched on top, framed with the words '
This is the last he sees of Tony in a very, very long time. But even then, through these weeks and months and
Sir Rhodes had observed the man in secret during his stay and discovered that not only was he a capable swordsman, but a kind one as well. His leg had not yet healed, but he was not to be convinced to lay down – instead, he had spent all week seeking out work to do and badly wounded men to aid in their own recovery.
She's gone down the hall and up a flight of stairs in a matter of seconds, and Steve wonders whether children of her size are supposed to be this fast on their feet. Is this normal? Seems like that'd turn the whole house into a potential safety hazard.
He must've looked for a tad too long, because after he's set his drink back down, the man turns to him casually and lifts an eyebrow in question, eyeing him from under the brim of his hat. "I got somethin' in my face?" he asks, his voice a rough drawl with an accent Tony can't quite place.
"It won't be
Next week rolls around, Tony keeps improving, and Steve allows himself to believe in a tomorrow again.
has lulled him to sleep halfway through.
"How was that?"
He hasn’t known that kind of serenity in as long as he can remember, has forgotten what it feels like, when everything
"Yeah, there we go, baby– that's right," he could hear himself say, words drowned out by the blood rushing in his ears. "Tha's where you need it, isn't it? Right there, 's where you're sweetest for me?"
"C'mon, Tony. Remember, before? I meant everything I said. There's so much more here than you're allowing yourself to see."
And it all was thanks to… Stark.
Steve thinks, and suddenly he’s up and racing toward the source of the smell with a single-mindedness he hasn’t often observed in himself. The voices in the back end grow louder, and when he’s arrived at the last wagon, it’s Natasha who comes his way, intercepting Steve’s run.
it won't. 'Lose that which you love'? You could damn well push me off that cliff but it wouldn't do anything because you've proven time and again that there's no
He knows from the way Tony shifts in his lap that he expects him to move. Usually, he'll grab him by the waist and go at whichever speed he's in the mood for at the moment. Today is a little different. What he needs today has less to do with pleasure and a little more with power.
It's almost like there is humor in the indefinable tone of its voice.
And the moments-that-aren't happen occasionally, but after, they shake themselves out of it, brush off the dust and move on. Tony still hasn't voiced any regrets about allowing him to stay with them, and that's already a plus in Steve's book.
"Ah, darling, please–
Cold sweat gathers at his temples, in the hollow of his throat, joining the moist patches that are already there, making his undershirt stick to his back and chest.
“Ugh." Tony stretches, wincing as something in his back pops. "What time do we have, J?”
Tony tilts his head in Steve's direction just so and breathes in deeply through his nose. It's like he's–scenting. He exhales a quiet "Huh, would you look at that," and Steve realizes that that is precisely what he's been doing.
Tony kisses her on the forehead and stands up slowly. "Alright, deal. Three juice pops. I'll come up later, yeah?"
of the Stone. This place is dead."
Anthony smiled, the strain in the curve of his lips gone, its existence only evident now that it had disappeared. "I am glad," he stated, audible relief proving his words true.
There's the flurry of movement all around them, people shouting and running, yet Steve can only drink in the sight of Tony, alive and breathing as if he's never not been. It's okay, like this.
Steve grimaces in sympathy, unsure of whether he should ask how it went. Probably not, though, considering Tony's subtle but very telling reaction from before when he feared Steve might have caught a glimpse of him behind the façade. They aren’t there yet.
Steve remains standing by the sink awkwardly, risking a glance at Tony's daughter who seems just equally as delighted by the situation as her father. When Tony, having apparently collected himself enough to deal with him, looks up again, he meets Steve with an exasperated glare that hits the exact nuance of
The belief that there is any way to quantify the cruelty Tony has suffered at his hands is shameful. As if the scars on his body and soul are to be traded as currency, as if Steve can keep score of how many he has yet to pay for and tick them off one by one.
Tony blinks down at his breakfast, a little dumbfounded and suddenly without appetite. He flexes his fingers. The bandage around his hand isn’t exactly conducive to making him seem more responsible. He shifts in his seat again and winces. Yeah, no, this particular flavor of ache isn’t workshop-related–unless one were to count getting railed over the workbench as a workshop-related incident, which he isn’t.
“You're everything I have,” Steve tells him, pained, and it isn’t what he’s meant to say, but he goes on despite the fact that his voice is already sounding like drowned in tears he hasn’t yet cried. “I’m sorry, Tony. I love you. It’s why I have to try.”
"Is it true?" he blurted nevertheless, unable to quench his curiosity despite promising himself he would not ask. "I– well, I am aware you and Captain Rogers are close, but–"
Nobody asks and Tony doesn't tell. There's no use in hiding but he isn't going to shout it from the rooftops either, and so the matter goes unaddressed, hanging heavily over the compound like a storm cloud ready to erupt at any given moment.
"Everything that happened, everything that would happen–did you know?"
Maybe– he should be angry. Instead. Yeah. How about that, huh?
The door falls close and Steve pushes the unreviewed reports aside. Relics of the past is what they call physical copies nowadays; Steve prefers the term 'safety guarantee'. He's learned from Hi-dra’s mistakes. There will be no digital record of any of his dealings because everything that's ones and zeroes can be accessed by an outsider with the right amount of skill and grit–Anthony E. Stark is only the tip of the iceberg.
Steve sits hunched over at the edge of the mattress when Tony all but stumbles out of the bathroom, dead on his feet and yet immediately alert when he sees the man’s back shake. He sits down next to him and doesn't even have a second to register what’s happening: Steve lifts his head out of his hands, revealing red-rimmed eyes, blood and dirt littering his features, and then Tony's dragged into a hug he couldn't break out of even if he wanted to.
He receives a kiss on the cheek and a smile-almost-leer that makes something in his gut stir awake, chasing the discomfort away for the moment. Steve nibbles at his earlobe, his breath cool on the spit-wet skin when he says, “I trust you’ll tell me all about it later.”
After another moment's silence, Tony clicks his tongue and brings the flat of his hand down on his thigh, signalling that they've lingered long enough. When he gets up, moving to go back upstairs and finally get some well-deserved rest, Steve follows suit without complaint.
"Oh," Tony says, for the second time. "That sucks."
Ever since Bruce had first taken up permanent residence in the Iron Castle, he would watch the Lord go out on rides into the deep woods and lush plains of Mar'vill every fortnight only to return with various aches he frequently and vocally complained about in his physician's presence.
“Alright, so, uh, our buddy Stone? He thinks of this as a lesson. I told him 'no' one too many times and now he thinks he can throw me to the wolves and then eventually I’ll learn to roll over and take it.
The fresh, midsummer breeze is perfect, the sun high on the cloudless sky and the temperatures bearable.
James saw him smile in a way he would consider lovestruck, almost timid, were it not for his friend's generally non-timid demeanor.
They could’ve been good. Together. Tony wheezes out a breath that might’ve been a sob if he had the energy for it. He fears every single one to be his last. They had the potential to be something great but were somehow destined to fail, pawns in this cruel game the universe plays. Some things would always be too good to be true.
“You gonna do something about this?”
“Lube,” he just says, blindly reaching over to the bedside drawer behind him to get the bottle.
It was only a fraction of what Steve had to give, and Tony
Tears glitter in Not-Steve’s eyes. Tony wants to sink his fingernails into them. This man doesn't have the right to cry, not with the things that journal alluded to he did.
Rhodes had spared no expense and gifted him a S'vjetian Red Devil, a great, hot-tempered hunk of a horse that lived up to its name. The rare breed had once been reserved solely for their people's warriors, favored due to its stamina and resilience in battle, but lost popularity with time passing and extended periods of peace when the population began to seek more agile and flexible mounts.
Steve starts him out slow. Tony’s grateful and annoyed about it at the same time, because while going easy on his body will minimize soreness later, he wants that circumstance to not factor into the way Steve chooses to treat him for once.
. Matter."
Next to him, there's noises on the other side of the wall. A scratch and a bump, followed by silence until the sounds come back, repeating like a broken record. They don't startle him like they used to. His guess is that rat colony has taken up residence in these walls a long time ago; Tony's been told it's neither his problem nor his business when he mentioned the matter to the owner, so he let it go. It's true, anyway.
His breath flows across Tony’s skin in gentle puffs as he whispers, almost inaudible, “Missed you so much, y’don’t even know.”
Of course, it's too late to pull up now. It's been too late for all of five seconds. All he can hope to do at this point is brace for impact and hopefully shield Steve from the worst of it. He knew the odds when he moved past the point of safe recovery.
They've done alright so far and all things considered, this is just another bump in the road–because the reality of the matter is, Tony'd rather be stuck with him than go on on his own, and that is proof enough for Steve that he dreads the prospect of losing him, of being entirely alone with nothing to live or die for just as much as Steve does.
His words taper off into a shuddering exhale, and then he's suddenly hovering over Tony and leaning down, lips closing around his for a fervent kiss before Tony can think of something deflecting to say or mildly self-deprecating to joke about. While Steve's tongue pushes into his mouth, his fingers continue to play with the plug, only pulling it free once he's coaxed another moan out of Tony that he muffles by smashing their mouths together again.
“Who are you?” a small voice asks just as he turns around frantically, ready to deal with the suspected intruder in his wake.
Nobody has moved yet, but it's a minute later when Rhodes suddenly stands and exchanges a few hushed words with Pepper, tear tracks on his face but his lips a thin, determined line. She nods in response to whatever he's suggested, and then the man turns to Tony's body and picks his best friend up with ease, as gentle as can be.
Tony wouldn't have guessed it would take him less than a day to miss Red Rock and its saloon with the rats and the watered down booze, but here he is. Miserable. Rogers is probably just waiting for him to crumble and turn his horse around, which is exactly why Tony can't. He's always had the incessant need to prove people wrong, especially those assumptions related to his person and his perseverance.
Frankly, he expected many things when he went to pick up this most treasured personal possession. He expected – well, Tony doesn't know what exactly he anticipated. Maybe to be disappointed. Disappointment would at least have been safe. This, however, is far from it. This means everything and nothing at once. It might be the man simply got tired of other motives and Tony caught his artist's eye, or Tony is intriguing him in a way that has nothing at all to do with their relationship, platonic or otherwise.
A few minutes pass until they’ve both recovered from the effects of their orgasm, breath and pulse slowing in tandem. Stark isn’t really lucid and won’t be for the next few hours; he smacks his lips and hums in content as he presses his rear back. The movement shifts Steve’s knot in a way that makes them both suck in a sharp breath in near perfect synchrony.
pretend it’s any other night, long before all this came to pass and they didn’t know any better; when these moments of togetherness were what they fought for, knowing they would return home and be in each other’s arms to forget about the world for a while.
When James confronted his friend about the matter and asked why he didn’t take credit for his craft in the first place, the young man only smiled privately and explained that he did the work for the work’s sake and not a pat on the back.
They set up a couple of traps in the beginning, courtesy of Tony's ingenuity, and the haul is usually much larger than this. It was much larger last month than it was a week ago, too. They might have to move on one of these days, when Tony is better–the city is picked clean for the largest part, and staying too long in one place has never proven to be a smart move.
reverberating in the alarmingly empty space of his mind, presently focused on nothing but survival. Before, there was cold creeping into his every bone, but he doesn’t feel it anymore, as if his body has accepted it as his natural state of being. Tony knows that doesn't bode well for him; his core temperature might already be falling. Maybe his heartbeat has slowed, he isn’t sure.
it be Sir Rogers who accompanied him on his forays into the Far Lands. While the man kept an open mind and welcomed every voice that spoke up among the commons, not a soul dared to dissuade him from this.
Oh God, he wanted it. He
Throughout the evening, he would entertain and joke with his guests like not even the jester of the court could, and laughter filled the hall at all times. His humor was as quick-witted as the man himself and by the end of it, he had charmed every Lady in his presence, no matter whether she had a husband sitting to her left or not.
"And I should– I think whatever it says about me that it was never a question of whether I still loved you can't be good, because fact is, you're a real–a real fucking asshole sometimes, Steve, and I. I can't really tell where you draw the line, or–if there even is a line anymore, and it terrifies me."
Never did the man attempt to make her duties more cumbersome, just like he did not allow anyone to go easy on her during their trainings. It was on her to earn her keep – and Carol did.
There is nothing to hold on for except this. Only this.
"They would–" he paused, Adam's apple bobbing once more. Sir Steven moved in a way that elicited a sharp intake of breath from the other man. "They would call me the
“Most of all, I love feeling you and being with you like this,” Steve mumbles against his skin as he presses open-mouthed kisses there, the words almost drowned out by the wet sounds their bodies produce. “Because you glow when you let yourself go, and every inch of you is just–gorgeous, it’s real and it’s you and I wouldn’t want it any other way.”
While Tony gets himself off, Steve takes hold of him and slams him down on his dick like a ragdoll. Or another kind of doll, come to think of it. Either way, being manhandled like some fucktoy is criminally hot, and Tony feels himself shake as the pleasure ripples through him in building oscillations. God, he’s so close, he just needs–
Fury glances down at the papers on his desk another time and then his brows suddenly furrow a little, a micro-expression lost to most, and the corner of his mouth twitches minutely like he's spotted something that's of interest.
The relief that overtakes him when Steve nudges his legs apart and then slides back into place without the littlest resistance is almost better than another orgasm would be. It feels right. Steve belongs with Tony–it’s a natural fact, like Newton’s laws or the sky being blue. There’s no argument to be made against it. They just are.
Not in a hurry, he climbs down from his bunk at a measured pace, letting the others take the lead while he trails behind. Then, he spots Bucky, pushing through the people in the opposite direction and waving Steve to him when their eyes meet.
some time and some screaming fits, but me and Steve made up. After I, like you already mentioned, returned from the deathtrap that is the boundless void of space,” Tony explains carefully. He places his chin in his hand and eyes Steve as if he’s trying to gauge his reaction.
He's stranded somewhere in a thick broadleaf forest. The trees are painted in different colors and in the process of shedding their leaves. Strangely enough, a feeling of familiarity arises within him as he regards his surroundings. Steve frowns, tries to think of a place he knows that fits this description, but comes up empty. He'll have to gather more information before he's able to make an educated guess.
Allowing the team to help had been a decision they'd agreed upon together. All of them had forged a bond that went far beyond amicable companionship in the last years; secrets no matter their nature were practically non-existent, the need for privacy no longer prevalent and intimacies exchanged freely. Privately, Steve thought that at the end of the day, they were not unlike soldiers seeking comfort in one another during times of war, and there was no judgement.
It's strange that Tony wouldn't build a failsafe into this suit like he's done with so many others. In case of emergency, he's always had multiple alternative energy sources ready for activation should the main arc reactor be damaged. Clearly, this one's been built for speed and maneuverability and therefore, protection and armor plating had to take a step back in favor of making the suit more lightweight, but something still rubs him wrong about this.
When Carol only met her eyes with a befuddled expression, Maria sighed long-sufferingly and elaborated, "Your intentions to spare them and yourself an uncomfortable confrontation are
Nebula looks at him strangely; more than she usually does, and the liquid dark of her eyes that says everything and nothing at all jolts Tony back to their conversation.
Tony, he always winds up looking at the man. Somehow, Steve can't even blame himself. His presence alone is magnetic. (Always has been, no matter the universe or the point in time.)
Arms wrap around him from behind.
They had bridled and saddled the horses.
He inspects the clothing, two button-ups and jeans that appear to be his exact size, swallowing around the lump in his throat when it becomes clear that this was part of other Steve’s wardrobe. Tony must’ve never gotten rid of it in the first place.
for those of you still with me, thank you for your patience. it means a lot, and i hope this (extra long) chapter meets your expectations.
Tony swallows his wounded pride and counters, "With all due respect, but you talk like you got a dozen other applicants to choose from. And from what I've been hearing, that's not really the case, is it?"
Steve tries not to listen to the voice in his head that tells him Tony stripped the armor of possible life-saving functions because he never expected to make it out alive in the first place.
Tonight, Steve makes an exception. Whatever that scent was, he doesn’t want to explore his reaction to it any further. The taste he’s gotten so far is enough to know it’d only cause trouble if he were to be subjected to it any more.
When he splays his fingers wide to work the kinks out, his palm glows orange. Correction: the
Soon after learning of the man's impairment, Bruce was shown the system the castle's masters had worked out under Stark's command – a silent language, spoken through gestures and movements of a person's hands.
Steve breathes out. He backs off and out of Stark's space entirely, and only then does he say, "We do need you. So by Christ, I hope you ain't bullshitting us. For your sake."
When Steve explains the fact of the matter to him with audible enthusiasm, Tony's amused smirk gradually wanes, softens, into something more delicate and finally, brittle. It's one of the moments they'll try to pretend have never existed later, the next time they come across one another with renewed strength to hold up their respective poker faces.
Sometimes, him and his daughter will go out, and Steve has the house to himself.
, and wouldn't that be just terribly boring?
Not to mention that it wouldn’t work with just anyone else. That much he’s forced to admit when he finally gives up on trying to imagine anyone but Steve being with him after the first two attempts have brought him nowhere near relief.
He noticed soon enough that it looked to be only slightly off from those the other knights wore. Not that the work had been done carelessly; it was quite the opposite, truth be told.
After a beat, Steve comes up onto the bed as well, his reflection in the mirror approaching from behind and then sitting down to pull Tony back into the V of his spread legs. He goes willingly, reclining against Steve's chest at an angle that's relaxing but (unfortunately) gives him an excellent view of his reflection.
The further he descended into the lower floors of the castle, the colder the air became. Moss entwined the old stone here, moisture making it appear slick and lustrous in the faint light of the odd candle lit in a rusty holder long ago hammered into the rock.
The cabin is, surprisingly, larger than it looks from the outside. There’s a reasonably sized oven with two hotplates sat on top, a square table with three chairs that squeak when sat on, a raggedy sofa in front of the fireplace and a narrow set of stairs crammed toward the back that leads up to small, second storey. It’s like an attic up there; the ceiling is low and slanted, and the entire space is occupied by the double-bed pushed away from the stairs and up to the tiny window overlooking the landscape outside.
In light of everything he has to have been through, reduced to a pretty face next to Stone's larger-than-life persona, used for his abilities and finally robbed of his creations as Stone carried off the laurels – there's not much animosity toward the former first-class in Steve left.
One evening, just as the sun is setting, Steve returns from the forest nearby, small game slung over his shoulder.
if he were one to use that word.
this. Steve had known he'd like it, had seen it in his nervous energy (fidgeting hands, bouncing on his toes, exaggerated expressions) and of course, the subtle bulge in his denim when they had, in every sense of the word, propositioned the others. But this– this was something else. A large portion of his enjoyment stemmed from Steve in him, but another, equally strong one originated from the knowledge that he was being watched, assessed, taken apart by prying gazes just as he was by Steve's dick.
James only barely refrained from reminding him that the King was not a magical fae who would fulfill his wishes if he just asked nicely enough. Barely, but he did. His friend had stood on the brink of death just recently, and the knight felt it was right and just to allow some leniency.
She meant to take an account of what would have to be taken care of the next day, but slowed in her step when she heard… curious noises from one place inside the building.
Although they planned to take turns sleeping, they end up outside, sitting together in silence more often than not. The atmosphere in these late nights would be almost comfortable if not for the cold.
As their bodies meet, joined so tightly you couldn't fit a sheet of paper between them, Steve lets them catch their breath for a second. He places fleeting pecks across Tony’s shoulders, ghosts of kisses as tender as he’s ever been, the beard a magnificent contrast to the softness of his lips. (Tomorrow, he’s going to want that between his thighs. No self-respecting man passes up some good beard burn.)
All the puzzle pieces come together the moment Steve rips the shield off his arm and breaks into a run toward the edge of the cliff. The shield comes clattering down on the floor in front of the Red Skull, who pays it no mind but instead watches the man who once foiled his plans jump to certain death with mild interest.
Tony freezes where he's standing when the howls re-emerge, closer this time. Much closer. Close enough his brain suddenly suspects all the shadows around him to turn into the shapes of wolves any given moment. Tony looks around him, rotating in place frantically, but even the light he's carrying doesn't do much against the dark of night.
"Yeah, well. I knew you would."
“It’s all pretty complicated,” he says hesitantly, voice gentle in a way someone would speak to a spooked horse and shoulders hunched to appear as non-threatening as possible. “And I don’t really understand it myself. But I’m not here to hurt you, or Tony– your dad. I just need to get back home.”
This should be easy. Here's Tony Stark, there’s a problem. Go solve it.
Much to the dismay of her late mother, who had desperately tried to betroth her to a wealthy trademan from her sister's husband's family until the day she breathed her last breath after a short but severe sickness.
More forcefully this time, he repeats the movement. The side of Stark’s face scrapes over the concrete below, and the sound forced out of his lungs might be one of both pleasure and pain. Steve’s pace doesn’t falter and doesn’t slow.
To his surprise, Rhodey only hesitates for the better part of ten seconds before he answers, "Alright, Steve," and that's that.
Tony heaves a long-suffering sigh but gets up anyway. As he fits himself against Steve, he places his own sock-clad feet on top of Steve's and winds his arms around his shoulders from below.
But he can’t
He thinks of Pepper and her wistful smile, telling her husband to rest and not worry even as tears fall down her face. Thinks of Rhodey, unable to look in his best friend's dead eyes as his last breath left him. Thinks of little Morgan, who will have nothing but stories and history books to remember her father as she grows up.
After this incident, he had been invited to the castle on more than one occasion. He had declined the request the first two times on account of having to help out his aunt (although in truth, he was simply anxious for his life), but was made to go by the woman herself when the messenger arrived for a third time.
He shuddered, knowing everyone was watching and came again, instinctively rocking his hips into the softness of Tony's rear as far they'd go. A futile endeavor, as he was already balls deep, but it still felt good to oblige by the urge and calm that old, animal part of his hindbrain.
One of the most notable ones is on the desk next to his old drawings. It’s a photograph of them on their second anniversary, courtesy of Bruce, who took it right there in the communal kitchen when they were too busy smiling at each other with mirth in their eyes and laughter on their lips to notice their audience.
He doesn’t get to contemplate the thought for long. The wolf moves, and so does Butterfingers. There is a brief moment in which Tony is aware of her rearing, but the knowledge doesn’t help the fact that the world turns upside down and he goes flying shortly thereafter. The clopping of hooves all around suggests that his little caravan is splitting up and straying everywhere without any regard for the bone-chilling panic
His eyes have gone wide and dark, whole entire being pulled taut and unmoving, like the eye of the storm or the string of an instrument that's close to ripping clean apart. There’s no way to smell fear, but he feels it clogging up the room nevertheless, a great, invisible entity that takes every hope and spark of joy Steve’s held onto until now and chokes it out, obliterates it in its entirety, cruel and remorseless.
Hardly any knight of the Iron Guard was fit to hold a candle to her and the skills she had made her own. Some of them were not enthused about this fact, hurt in their pride and manliness, while some others warmed up to her after a while.
The drive to the facility at the outskirts of New York is long and tense. When they arrive, he's first sent to medical – that figures. Steve sighs and bows to his fate. Isn't his first rodeo, in any case.
When he's pried the plates from Tony's neck, he removes the pieces from his arm bit by bit. The metal is singed and the shine of red and gold gone; Steve cuts his fingers more times than one as he hurries through the process. He wants to get them off quick as possible, like the moment the ugly blackened layer over Tony's skin is gone the memory will disappear as well.
Carol, though it pained her, could not comply by her last wish.
Tony has revisited this riddle countless times, wanting to solve it, thinking he was going to go mad with the inability to and wished any of it would just
Tony, too, has learned long ago not to bare thoughts the likes of these to the world and especially not the men they are aimed at. He thinks it must've been at the age of twelve when his father overheard him speaking too fondly of a boy in his class; Howard Stark beat that particular notion out of him with his belt and words that stung more than any beating ever could.
Steve makes the mistake of pausing for just the fraction of a second, and Tony grabs onto that reaction, white-knuckled and unrelenting.
"I can't do this to them, Steve," he says. It's supposed to be a simple statement, a matter of fact, but the words that leave his mouth sound like a plea. "It's not fair. Not like this."
Doesn’t mean they shouldn’t try. Doesn’t mean they can’t not try. They have to, for the sake of the people and everything still right and just in the world. Even if that everything isn’t much, and the world has considerably shrunken in size.
Anyway, he’s going to stick to the more nebulous term of self-proclaimed visionary and leave the whole oracle shtick to Strange (Sorcerer Supreme, Master of the Mystic Arts and Keeper of the Time Stone, or however he referred to himself on a normal weekday. It’s a mouthful for sure. And the guy had the audacity to comment on
He never spoke the words out loud. They sound right but leave a bitter aftertaste on his tongue. He figures this is how missed chances must taste. Tangy but stale. Rainwater.
“Well, I can’t exactly give you a demonstration, can I? But I can show you how to take these apart. With the supply we have here, we could get five, six dozen smaller doses easy.”
"Welcome back," Tony mumbles. "Love you."
"So good, Tony," Steve huffs in-between shallow breaths. "You're so tight, feels perfect. You're so beautiful, sweetheart, I could shoot my load just looking at you."
Ruminant, Steve tilts his head as he looks down at the man in his wake. Yeah, he will ask for the privilege to break him in. And Pierce will grant his request because he's done a better job hunting Stark down than anyone else ever has or would have, and that is deserving of a little treat if nothing else.
Steve didn't have to be told twice. He was hard again, for the fourth time – had barely ever gone soft, in all honesty. How could he, with Tony in his wake?
"You could make it up to me." He squeezes around Steve's dick and musters up a grin, although he doesn't have to see it to know it hardly passes as one.
At least, his old man thought he did, because Tony still grew up to be the
"I'm sorry," he says, unsure for what he is apologizing. The torture, the betrayal or the refusal to give Tony the dignity of his choice? Can he be truly sorry, when he did what he did with the knowledge that he'd cause this?
“I love you too, Tony, I do,” Steve answers, lips brushing Tony’s hair.
The sounds of battle fade with their enemy, screams and shouts and metal against metal dying as they do. Steve looks around him, jovial,
The floor disappears, and Tony goes with it, falls and falls. For a blissful moment, he floats somewhere far away where none of this has meaning and the whole world hasn't collapsed in on itself with none of the beauty and all the destructive force of a neutron star.
“Okay,” Tony breathes through a sigh. “Should I show you to your room? It’s a little cramped, but it should do for the night.”
His back curls inward in hopeless search for a respite from the pain. Every breath is fire in his lungs, but he can’t let it go. “What did you do?" It's supposed to be a demand but the words leave him in a strained wheeze that belies only the effort it took to voice them. "What the fuck did you
He responds to get Tony out of his misery. "Yes, thank you. I could do with some OJ."
"This is what I meant to explain to you," Thor said from somewhere, but his voice seemed far away, echoing in the wonderfully empty chamber of Steve's mind. "To join the men and women you join in battle in another kind of ecstasy is unique. It is special. You will know more of them after one act of love than in thousands of violence."
He isn’t as smart as he thinks he is, because I know something he doesn’t.”
"Assuming you're telling the truth and you
They've closed his eyes. It would've been peaceful if not for the sight of his face, deathly pale on its left and scorched a reddish black on his right. Steve promised himself not to look, but now that he's here he can't bear to treat this like it means nothing, like he hasn't been in love with this man for the better part of his time in the 21st century.
It took its time, but when Anthony eventually came around, he quickly began to seek out Bruce's company every day anew.
"Yeah, we're good. She's treating me well. Pretty sure she's going easy on me because she can tell I'm out of practice," Tony answers, chuckle dry in his throat.
After months of being pestered to take better care of his own well-being – not only courtesy of Sir James but Ms. Potts, newest member of the castle and without question the most qualified steward and wittiest personality Mar’vill had ever seen – Anthony yielded to their requests.
Steve lodges their mouths together before he gets to ask, but the question is rendered redundant anyway once he tastes himself on the other man's tongue.
Crossing the soft carpet laid out over the better part of the hardwood, Steve approaches the king-sized bed, which is a mess. He lays Tony down tenderly, placing him in the middle of the giant nest of clothing items and other textiles. A nest: Steve figures that is what it is, based on all the educational reading he's been doing. He grabs the comforter from the foot of the bed and covers Tony's sleeping form with it, tucking it in around the edges of the nest.
Today, he's writhing in the sheets, halfway to delirious, mumbling unintelligible nothings underneath his breath. Steve wishes he could take the pain in his stead. Were it possible, he'd have done it from the very start without hesitation.
No, in fact, the brain behind this operation was maybe the one person Steve (and every other outsider) would have suspected the least: Stone's omega, Howard Stark's son, bonded to the alpha for business purposes but also, as it seemed, to milk him for all his Stark genius behind the curtains of a public bonding born out of necessity.
There’s a second of silence, both of them frozen in anticipation.
So, even now that just about everything seems preferable over yet again meeting the man who's going to sit him down, tell him just the right amount of things and then direct him to his place in this new world – even now, Steve smiles at Tony, grateful for the news yet not, and soldiers on.
"Who do you think sent the messages?"
On the other side of the portal, he sees Bruce–who brings with him the tale of a Mad Titan and the promise that this is the endgame.
It would have been beautiful if Tony wasn't cold, exhausted and ready for something with a high enough percentage of alcohol to warm him from the inside.
The reactions are as positive as one would assume, but Steve surprises him. Tony expected him to argue, maybe shut him down with a ‘we don’t have time for this’ or a curt request for him to focus, but all he does is heave a deep breath and pinch the bridge of his nose.
"It wasn't– You were
Depending on the day, Tony then locks himself in the workshop or leaves for SI. Either way, they won't see one another until the sun's set over New York, which gives Tony enough time to prepare for Steve's bitter expression the next time he enters their living room and JARVIS says, "I can confirm Captain Rogers is currently in the right place."
“Please, settle down,” a female voice speaks. It’s a cold, aloof one he wishes he’d not recognize immediately. “The occasion for our appearance here is a joyful one. Mr. Stone himself has sent for this one here to be brought to you and done with as you please. Do consider it a gift from him to you.”
While Nebula navigates them through the boundless void of the cosmos, Tony occupies himself with other things. There’s no use in trying to identify their exact whereabouts, so he tinkers with his suit, assembles the leftover nanites until a somewhat functional helmet remains.
Tony leaves early in the morning, just before the break of dawn.
Stark is half-hard when Steve takes him in hand, and his cheek is visibly torn open as he jerkily shakes his head and moans “no”, the first time he's uttered anything even close to a plea.
The last shreds of daylight are gone and Tony’s hands are stiff from the cold when everything is finally over with and they're ready to retreat inside. The animals are taken care of and secured under the shelter, the equipment stored away, and there’s enough firewood inside to get them through the night.
Turning on his heel, he sprints back into the alley that won’t take him anywhere and Steve lets him, wanting to indulge in a little play of cat and mouse. What’s the harm? Might even be a bit of a challenge for a change.
The initial urgency has ebbed, leaving only comfortable pleasure that is lazy in its climb. They could probably keep at this for hours. Tony has to bite his lip at the idea. Steve fucking him for hours on end, rubbing his hole raw to the point of
"I don't need you t'keep watch. One of us'll do. Just, ah, keep the fire goin', yeah?"
Steve nudges him gently, and Tony makes himself answer with a jerky nod. "Everything else–it doesn't matter. We matter.
Steve Rogers isn't a pretty marble statue void of emotion. Who would have guessed?
Pepper
It takes him a beat or two to come back to reality enough to realize what the slightly uncomfortable sensation in his pouch-area is. Steve is… squeezing. Squeezing it. Tony almost snaps at him to not
All that tension strung so tight finally snaps when the piece of metal he’s been trying to attach breaks loose for the nth time, and he flings the unfinished construction across the room with an angry roar.
And then, the woman who introduces herself as Carol Danvers carries them back to Earth with ease and speed both of which make Tony rethink the angel theory as he sits there, strapped to the seat in the cockpit that shakes with the force of their velocity.
They're there for half a day, and then, after having inspected everything twice with probing gazes and Geiger counters and all that other equipment Steve doesn't know nor thinks to ask about, they pack up again. The collective disappointment about the eagerly anticipated evidence failing to materialize hangs over their heads like the blanket of clouds on the pale september sky.
"Are you alright?" Anthony inquired, not quite able to keep the amusement out of his voice as he regarded the boy.
The choice of entertainment surprised him when Steve took his pick. They watched an episode or two a few months after the Avengers had moved into the tower, and he recalls Steve not being into it then. Tastes change, Tony supposes. (Not always for the better, but it is what it is.)
"Let's try something else," he says easily–ominously–and rolls his shoulders back.
Back then, Steve was too weak-willed to finish the mission. Today? Today, he’d see to it that the man wouldn’t get the chance to speak a word. Even if it were to happen, Steve wouldn’t be bothered anymore.
Better than nothing, Tony figures.
Bain smiles brightly, a flash of teeth between lips red like blood. Steve feels his facial muscles spasm as he fights an angry grimace, but the invidious woman is forgotten the moment he’s made it all the way through the crowd to the front row.
It hits him like a ton of bricks, a gut-punch or something a little more pleasant: this is a
Natalia mused that he was likely to simply enjoy watching a group of men in a show of brute strength, but she opted to keep this notion to herself.
Trusting Steve.
Sir James regarded him silently for a beat, the man struggling to stay upright as exertion and injury drained him of his remaining strength. He did not belong to any royal guard nor did he seem to have been hired to fight; it appeared he was there simply for the cause, willing to lay down his life in a war against uncompromising evil.
It wasn't long after the Avengers moved into the tower together to fully embrace their status as a team that he'd begun explaining the ways of Asgardian sexuality to the lot of them. Back then, just after Loki and everything that came to pass in New York, they'd still been treading carefully around another and evaluating boundaries – Thor's
Tony bites his lip. No, the super-powered manhandling is never not going to be hot.
to that?
"It seems our Man of Iron is ready and eager to continue," Thor commented through a low chuckle from where he sat cross-legged at Tony's right with enough distance to observe the other man's reactions. Apart from him and Steve, the demi-god was the only one in the room fully unclothed, fist around his impressive length and entirely unbothered as he stroked himself and enjoyed the show.
And yet
James considered this to be a rather strange way to introduce oneself, but he was tired from the long day and aching in his back since he'd fallen off his mount as someone put an arrow clean through its head, and could not be bothered to make a mention of it.
As soon as she's out the door, Steve pushes Tony off his lap and bends him over the desk instead. One hand in his hair roughly mashing his face into polished ebony and the other bruising his hip, Steve thrusts into him without consideration or grace. His movements are sloppy and uncoordinated for their desperation, and it all falls apart in minute's time.
It's 2010 hours. He should be on his way back.
Nobody besides May and the other workers had ever taken notice of his newest invention. It was simple enough: Two buckets, one on the floor and one on the cabinet, connected through a tube of braided twigs and leaves so as to keep it leak-proof. The perforated end of another, similar tube was in Peter’s hand, producing a steady spray of water that varied in intensity depending on how quickly he worked the pedal at his feet that was connected to a mechanism within the base of the bucket and helped pump the liquid upward.
With the feeling of 230 pounds of very much
Sometimes, he'd feel like cuddling up to Steve and/or participating in a compound-wide movie night or just doing literally anything but getting a round of actual, honest cardio in. That wouldn't be so bad on its own, but then on other days his back or ankle or hip would hurt and he wouldn't feel up for any kind of endurance training, and then on others he'd feel under the weather or banged up from a recent day in the field–
Lord Stark laughed out loud, a bright sound that echoed along the chamber's ancient walls and chided Peter for his youthful naiveté.
Tony refuses for all of ten seconds. Steve tightens his fingers around his shaft with enough pressure the pleasure promptly turns into pain. This, he stands for maybe a moment or two before he lifts his head and looks, gasping, at Romanoff, whose expression remains unreadable. Her hands are clasped in her lap right over her crossed legs, posture straight but open like she's interviewing for a position she knows is hers–in fact, that might be an apt description were it not for Tony wrecking himself on Steve's cock.
lies down on the sacrificial altar to cut his chest open and give his bleeding heart to the world.
He begins to pull at the bandages with a fervor and a shaking hand, fingers clawed and movements erratic. Like he needs to see it to believe. Like he needs proof of what his memory tells him Steve has done.
A response comes in the shape of Steve’s hard-on giving a noticeable twitch. Ah. Why does he have a feeling that man's going to be insatiable tonight?
Steve leans in, wraps his hand around the other man's jaw to press a kiss to his lips that is as much proof of life as it is a display of affection. It's quick and seemingly lackluster like any of their affections shown out in the streets, because indulging would be a distraction they can't fall prey to. What they lack in passion out here they make up for in the safety of their shelter; it's the one thing Steve spends every day looking forward to.
Steve matches his crooked smile with one of his own.
Freed from the shackles of misguided morals, Steve has discovered that the criminal scum of this city are cunning. They have to be; the ones that aren’t go as quickly as they come, ants under Hi-dra’s boot. Who knows whether the man’s daughter existed? His tears may very well have been just as contrived as the raw desperation in his words, his cries a trick to sway the emotional parts of Steve’s hindbrain.
Steve moves on, follows the dusting of hair on his torso down and down, his hands a steady point of contact at Tony's sides. He reaches Tony's stomach and draws a circle of kisses around his belly button.
Tony snorts but feels his smile grow soft. "He can, yeah."
It's long after that people start slowly saying their goodbyes, the more distant acquaintances first. Steve eventually turns to go as well, leaving only Tony's closest family and the Parker kid behind, but Pepper walks up to him and holds him back with a hand on his arm.
wire in this whole god-forsaken hell-train. And you know why I do? Because I. Built. It.”
Tony backs off not suddenly but gradually, their lips' uncoupling stretching into infinity for a long moment until the point of contact is no more. The bliss, however, ends rather abruptly when Steve's met with the storm of emotions in the other's eyes.
She grins and, with an 'oof', heaves herself back upright. "No, I like them. Sailboats are totally cool. Daddy promised we'd go sailing to the Maldives next summer," she informs him, flopping the small stack of paper with her calculations on it over to its blank side. "There. More paper."
Again, Steve drove in at the same angle, with more force this time. Tony
His eyes don’t have problems adjusting to the lighting conditions, so it takes him a moment to put a finger on what feels different about the room when he stands and walks to the bed.
Yes, the days where he could get off just receiving are over, and it’s yet another in a long series of age-related developments that grind his gears. Even though Steve "Hopeless Optimist" Rogers would argue that, well, it just means everything they do in bed lasts longer, and that should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a hindrance.
he nudges Tony’s legs apart and positions himself behind, pulling Tony's rear end further up to meet his pelvis. Tony moans at the feel of the thick length against his thigh, feels the moisture of precome smeared against his skin. It’s a heady feeling, to be wanted this much, and he doesn’t think he’ll ever quite get over it.
Steve and Hi-dra aren't one.
Then,
but he resists the temptation. Instead, he hangs his head in quiet defeat and looks up at his daughter with fondness in his gaze.
Soon, he'll take Tony and run. And one day, this will just be another among many close brushes with death.
Surprisingly enough, it takes the rest of the compound longer to catch on than anticipated. Most of them are Fury’s lot after all, so Tony expected to be found out sooner.
Tony cries out, then, in a bare-bone agony that is less figurative and more horrific for it. Even compared to all that lies in his past already, it might be the rawest expression of torment Steve’s ever witnessed, and with every tendon that gets severed there’s another layer of Tony peeled back, all of him stripped away until this is everything he is, a flesh-and-bone being suffering through something it has lost the words to describe.
Steve's had a lot of time to think these past days, watching over Tony and pleading with a higher deity that doesn't exist for his recovery. He has come to plenty of realizations–but his burgeoning understanding that his motivations aren't always noble doesn't mean anything to Tony, who doesn't have the privilege to mull over the philosophical intricacies of his rescue.
He doesn't want him to stay, so he says, "Okay."
And then there Steve's reflection appears next to him in the mirror, in all his date-night-ready glory, Tony's favorite sapphire shirt stretching over those shoulders (although he's just as attractive in partially sweat-soaked gym gear or just sporting sweatpants and a bedhead) and Tony just… Tony doesn't
And what breaks Steve's heart is what remains unsaid: if there was another option, Steve would not be the one he would choose. It hurts but he figures it’s fair. This pain is a price he'll gladly pay in exchange for the privilege to leave this town with Tony by his side. As long as they're together, in any capacity, Steve will make do.
With Tony added to the equation, they wind up in a triangle-like formation, facing one another in some sort of parody of a mexican standoff where instead of guns it’s the impending emotional fallout that poses the central problem.
When they depart, Steve leaves the butcher's knife in the door.
Steve is overcome with instant relief whenever, after a long day, he hears familiar voices on the porch and the door unlock, and it gives him pause.
"You, um. You get it, right? That's why I can't," Tony sniffs and fiddles with his sleeves, "I can't let Maria see you. And you can't stay here, no offense. It would just– she'd understand, I think, but she shouldn't have to, not after going through all of this."
“I said
"And what do you think of our armory as it is?"
He looks up and is met with the dozens of heroes that have gathered around as the fight came to an end. When he walks, sensing Rhodey’s and Pepper’s presence close by, the crowd parts around them.
"Hey, big guy," he drawled, weak smirk accompanied by a wink. Big was– an understatement and Tony knew, but Steve felt like he'd never let him live it down if he pointed that out (even though it
Maybe it's madness disguised as a sudden bout of false self-awareness, but it's
“Your brain is beautiful,” Steve says, smiling, and then leans down to map out a path from Tony’s cheeks, over his jaw, to his throat and neck, all the while repeating the phrase in different variations but the same, reverent tone. It’s cheesy and Tony is surprised he hasn’t burst into laughter yet, but a part–tiny, microscopic really–is unreasonably charmed by the unhampered display of Steve’s attraction.
Too bad for the big man in front. Because Stark, well, he's – a former first-class, and sometimes he complains about the most trivial of things like how he craves coffee, misses music, and would kill for a clean towel (Steve refrains from commenting that he'll get to do that soon enough) – damn fucking witty, and resourceful, and when Steve accidentally calls him ‘genius' in a roundabout way, Stark’s gloating makes him almost want to take the words back. But then he doesn’t.
here and sometimes it–I'm mad because I can't possibly put it into words or explain how–"
Believe him, don't believe him, it's all the same to Tony, but he actually does still have a moral compass. He knows this is all but right, invading another person’s privacy the way he's doing right now. And yet – even knowing better, Tony does it, like he has done so many things that came before it.
If he sees Rogers looking at him with brows furrowed in disapproval out of his peripheral vision, Tony doesn't mention it. There’s just no pleasing that man; maybe it was a close call, but nothing happened in the end. How is it that even when Tony’s being useful for once, he finds something to nag about?
Days pass, and Tony is conscious and lucid sometimes. Most times, he is not.
Tony takes another shower.
Out of the three of them, Bucky volunteers to keep watch. It's necessary – not so much to keep the omega where he is, but to keep everyone else away from him. Some very courageous individuals are bound to try something during the hours of the night, and they don't want that to happen. At least not until such a time when the man's usefulness is determined.
As if following a command, Steve looks down at where they're connected. Where he's driving relentlessly in and out of Tony’s body, marking him and assuring him that he
It appeared he’d been unsuccessful in this endeavor, since a few moments later, Lord Stark inquired what it was he was doing there. The young man could only stutter at being addressed so suddenly and called out for his behavior – until the Lord smiled and pointed at Peter’s workstation, “That is quite the interesting contraption. Who thought to make it?”
He screams, first in protest. Begging for mercy, which feels wrong and unnatural coming from Tony. “NO! STEVE, STOP!
He smells it before he hears the commotion all the way in the back: distress, acrid and sharp. There’s a hint of something else underneath it, a sweet and alluring undertone that is overpowered by the fear it shares the scent with.
Given the opportunity, he wouldn't even have hesitated to trade his own life for this man's.
He returned with the mixture wrapped in cloth and handed it to Lord Stark, who pulled a displeased face at its strange smell. "You will want this," Bruce simply remarked. "Inhale it."
Her eyes are red, but she's stopped crying sometime ago. Instead, there's the hint of a smile on her face, even if it's crooked and wistful.
James was very well aware that Anthony had a passion for the forge, but this explanation seemed unbefitting. Truly, the Stark heir was not one to expect to be showered in compliments for an unprompted act of kindness, but this was not to say he did not crave or go so far as to avoid them.
The look Steve shoots him makes Tony's throat close up. There's something dark and wickedly determined in his eyes, like he's--like he's considering going through with this.
There were various misdeeds she frowned upon; the love of two who loved deeply and genuinely was not one of them. If ever one found this secret true as she had and used it to bring harm to the men involved, she would be more than delighted to bring that wicked person down with her very own hands.
He's cursed to watch without the ability to relieve the pain once more, and Tony is no soldier. But because he's the man Steve loves and this is something he
The more the merrier, after all.
Tony winds his arms around Steve's shoulders and looks up at him, trying and failing not to appear sheepish. He doesn't want to keep repeating this same pattern over and over, but the downward spiral gets harder to escape the longer he entertains it.
A short pause. Then, the man jumps off his horse’s back in the matter of seconds, approaching with great, long strides that seem to cut through the snow like a knife through molten butter.
Steve lays down a fleeting kiss on the top of his spine and Tony feels the lips on his skin twitch with an unidentifiable emotion.
Steve swallows, nods, and approaches the last column of bunks, looking up. He doesn't know if Stark will even want him to – help. Heats are tough, but it's not that they can't get through them alone. Without any real relief, most of them just hurt; at least that's what he was able to tell, as an outsider. Steve already knows Stark can take a beating, and this probably shouldn't be all that different.
He drags his hips back, barely enough for Tony to tell a difference, and then pushes back, working them up to an actual fucking. The tenderness surprises him–there’s still an understated urgency, but ultimately, Steve’s slow and gentle, rubs his hands up and down Tony’s sides, legs and everywhere else he can reach. Tony fists one hand in the bedsheets and holds onto the back of Steve's thigh with the other, needing the contact.
Like that's going to make it all just, what, disappear? Poof. Gone, only a cloud of magic
Then, the dam breaks.
"Dreadful. We would not last a day under a larger attack, and you are aware of it."
Things get worse by the day.
downstairs, locking him out of dreamland to instead have him deal with Steve, unwanted houseguest who couldn't keep from fucking up that one task he's been given.
There is no time.
Tony locks his legs tighter around him and pulls himself up by his shoulders, lengthening his neck to bridge the last few inches and press an open-mouthed, breathy kiss to Steve's lips.
"Do you want me to go upstairs and get my jizzed up pants from the hamper? Because I'll go and get them if you need physical evidence. There's paper towels in the bin because I came all over the– I'm not fucking delusional, Steve, I–"
It’s only after Tony has quieted down a bit that Steve dares to speak up cautiously, "Tony, maybe it'd be better if, uh. Maybe I should think about moving in with SHIELD."
encircled by Steve’s arms, his front plastered against Tony’s back and hands rubbing up and down his torso as though he doesn’t know which part of Tony to shower with attention first.
Steve doesn’t pretend there’s any use in hiding his grief. Despite his leader-shtick, Nat was essentially the person who kept the remainders of the Avengers (for the most part) together and occupied in the recent years. And now, after stepping up and holding on through the worst of it, she wouldn’t even get to see the fruits of her labor.
Maybe the seventh stone was meant to be broken.
Steve lays him out on their bed, located in what was once a living room. It’s a grand room with a high ceiling and a fireplace, which is why they’ve barely set foot in any other part of the house at all. Everything they need is here, and in case of emergency, they’ll be able to gather up all their belongings faster. It’s a survival strategy turned habit.
just let me go in peace.
With the weapon as firmly secured as could be, Stark cleared his throat and resumed his speech, "I bestow this greatsword upon you to consolidate your position amongst the people. Carry it as a symbol of the responsibility placed in your hands, and carry it with the deliberation and wisdom of the men that came before you."
"I missed you," Steve breathes against his temple, squeezing a little tighter.
To the young James Rhodes, the walls of the Iron Castle seemed vast and insurmountable, and the guards looked grim and frightening in their shining armor with polished steel at their hips. He would spend many weeks weeping and begging his mother to return to her father’s homestead in town until he begrudgingly accepted his fate at last.
And after that, the man suddenly pauses in thought and goes, “So, ah. Steve, is it? I think we haven’t been properly introduced.”
Days pass. He doesn’t, as promised, tell Steve all about it.
The light streaming in through the window takes on a golden hue in time and announces the day’s impending end by bathing the room in its warm colors. There’s no clock around and Steve hasn’t got a watch on him, so it’s hard to gauge how much time has really passed. He’s used to his circadian clock being dead on time just about always, but this unprompted weekend getaway through dimensions left his head spinning in more ways than one.
He needs to–
"Oh, uh, we built a miniature speedboat together? Two, actually. And now she's very determined to take it for a spin every day because last time she raced her friend she lost," he answers, the memory causing a faint chuckle to escape him. Tony gathers a cup from one of the cupboards and proceeds to fill it to the brim, not noticing as Steve smiles quietly into his fifth omelet.
nobody here wants to straight out tell him that they'd rather keep this Captain America 2.0 that conveniently fell out of the sky and into their hands for themselves than send him back home. Just a guess, though.
Steve puts one arm under Tony's and the other under his knees and lifts him up gingerly. His legs feel like they're about to give out then and there, but that's not an option right now, so Steve doesn't let them.
He frowns, freezing where he’s standing and reflexively bringing his hands up in defense. Sure, he can do well enough without it, but
Bruce was not the kind to ask many questions, so he did not find much difficulty in obeying the rule. Being of a rather reserved temperament himself – long as no-one dared to anger him – he knew to leave others to their secrets.
For a few minutes, the world seems to come to a standstill in silent grief over the loss of its best defender. The noise of battle and bloodcurdling screams fade into somber tranquillity as the reality of Tony's sacrifice takes hold.
The knight's face darkened at the question. Bruce suspected an unexpected encounter with raiders or other men that meant them harm, but his assumptions were thrown overboard when Sir Steven cast a pointed glare at the Lord, chagrin audible in his next words.
Five years later, Howard Stark died en route to an allied neighbor, three dozen raiders decimating his guards and torching the wheelhouse he had traveled in.
, because at its core, this is humiliating and he doesn't need any more of that today. No, thanks a lot but no.
It's not right.
The longer he looks, the easier it gets to uncover the two most obvious and confusing truths about this room. It's old and out of place. The floorboards aren't as spotless and shiny as the ones downstairs and the tapestry is even peeling off in one corner. Its combination of furniture is messy, the colors don't match, and none of it looks like it really belongs here. Funny, how Steve fits right into both those categories.
Tony's gaze shifts away from Steve and up, where a still, clear lake makes way for endless sandy hills in the distance. It's eerily quiet but for the sound of the water. The sky is drenched in otherworldly shades of red and orange, and none of their surroundings seem familiar.
Tony's first official act of the day is activating the coffee machine, which comes as a surprise to no one. He's leaning against the counter as he waits, stifling another yawn. Steve realizes he's stopped eating in favor of watching their interaction take place and is now watching
Steve’s having none of it. His fingertips brush Tony’s parted lips, then, and Tony almost immediately stops resisting. As soon as Steve slips his fingers inside, his mouth closes around them and he’s sucking and lapping at the two digits like it’s all he’s been waiting to do from the start.
would your people say if they saw you right this moment?"
Then, his tired, wounded heart seems to leap out of his ribcage.
“–no?”
The image would be amusing to witness if their situation wasn't what it's turned out to be, because the Skull's every word makes it painfully obvious that he's long transcended the state of being that once earned him Captain America's righteous fury. Steve, on the other hand, is still coming to terms with that reality.
“I guess, I. You, uh. I know you think the gray makes me look
There’s a distinct tremble in his voice. Tony can tell, if the way he’s looking at him is any indication. He’s still facing toward the hologram, but his head is turned to the side just so and he’s observing Steve from the corner of his eye. “It was, um. It was the other way around, here. Last time I checked, Nat was with Laura and the kids. Survivor’s guilt,” he says quietly, blinking a few times before he turns away again.
At the very least he now has a fighting chance. And that’s everything Tony Stark has ever needed.
Over the back of the couch, Tony's gaze meets his. It's sad, but there's something else beneath that wistful glaze that is a little less somber. A touch of gratefulness, even.
At the age of two, he'd seen inside the Iron Castle.
But together, in one way or another.
"Got a cut there. We should clean that," he says, but his gaze isn't focused on the matter at hand anymore. His eyes have wandered down, and that's Tony's mouth he's looking at now. Tony holds his breath in anticipation, but nothing happens.
. “You really are unbelievable,” he says, but there’s no heat behind the words. He seems rather fond.
24 days is his personal record for longest time taken to pin down a criminal on the loose, but seeing as the fourteen previous attempts Hi-dra made to apprehend Stark failed miserably, he reckons the result is acceptable. Pierce certainly seemed satisfied when he delivered his last status report.
They just about manage to keep the fight confined to the vicinity of the compound. The building gets leveled in the first fifteen minutes, but Tony would take that a million times over the casualties they’d see in the city.
Steve almost utters an outright growl at the statement–because who is she to insinuate what he's to do with his conquest–but gets a grip on himself in the last moment.
Steve, having found yet another rule he determined fit to be broken, couldn’t keep up the pretense they had silently come into agreement about. In those moments before the final wave of pleasure swept them up in short-lived oblivion, the emotions they’d so expertly shoved aside returned with a vengeance.
The words coaxed a deep, guttural sound out of the man whose eyes rolled into the back of his head as he swallowed noisily, grip on the ringmail spasming.
Steve feels his mouth run dry. That makes…. sense. He might not have been in contact with any omegas for a while, but he still should’ve known, should’ve been able to tell the signs. Not only his scent shifted – Stark also complained about being too warm despite the ever-freezing cold seeping in from outside. On top of that, he was constantly on edge, twitchy and irritable in a way that, combined, should’ve alerted Steve to what was going on.
"I hear JARVIS is already spilling all my secrets," Tony says, successfully derailing Steve's train of thought.
Tony humors him, although he does it with about the same amount of enthusiasm you'd manage to muster up for a colonoscopy.
"Stop. Shut–shut up! Just
Reminding everyone of their shared hatred for the man almost always makes a lasting impact, and tonight's no exception. Some affirmative shouts and growls emerge from the men and women in front of him, the group disbanding as one after the other leaves.
Steve finds him clutching the truth in his hands.
Anthony wound satin-clad arms around his neck and smiled, carding his fingers through the strands of hair at the back of Steven's skull.
The process itself is evidently harder, if only in consequence of Tony lacking a second arm. Usually it would be routine maintenance, but with the way things are, it becomes yet another task he has to re-learn the same as he needed to re-learn how to change clothes and prepare food. This might be the most difficult task yet, and he struggles accordingly: clamps the contraption between his knees to hold it steady, pulls at wires with his teeth, screws a nut in with his mouth.
“So… JARVIS.”
As they move closer, the disembodied voice speaks again.
What's this supposed to be? A vision of death? Some interdimensional waiting room on the brink to afterlife? Feeling panic clogging his throat, Tony squeezes his eyes shut again and exhales shakily as he listens to Steve's faint breathing.
That and a lot more is stored here; whatever the hell the thing is Stark speaks of, he’s got no idea.
Steve, Stevestevesteve, please–"
(Barnes was different. Their forever-to-remain-anonymous informant–Tony guesses a rat or someone with cold feet–pointed them toward a computerized Arnim Zola when SHIELD was still nazi-infested. Aside from the minor detail that HYDRA had taken Bucky against his will, well. It was also a lot more personal. Finding out about his parents was a lot on its own. Accepting that the hands of their murderer belonged to a man who was as much of a victim as they were? That took some time to digest.)
"Don't do that again. I ain't goin' on any search and rescue missions anymore."
excess pounds below his league but also always getting on his nerves and it
Steve fucks like it's his last time, buries himself deep and spills his release with a shout and the image of Stark wrapped in colorful silk cloths hovering in front of his inner eye.
Tony was the one to jolt him out of his musings, his hand coming to lay over Steve's at his hip and squeezing in a silent inquiry. And then, his tongue darted out to wet his lips and he voiced that quiet demand in a loud and needy manner.
"These are both very cool. I'm impressed." Steve sees a familiar strain around Tony's lips, yet everything he does is pull his daughter in with one hand and press a gentle kiss to the crown of her head. "There's my little artist, huh? You haven't drawn anything for me in months, glad the creative streak's back."
What can he say? He likes his showers hot; scaldingly so, according to Steve, whom he spent the last shared shower with practicing a lot less sexy-time and a lot more wrestling for the temperature control than anticipated. That whole thing transpired notwithstanding the fact that FRIDAY could meddle with the settings just as well and with less effort – which she ended up doing, if only to force a compromise onto them. She averaged out their desired water temperatures and therefore rendered their increasingly slippery and hazardous shower spar useless.
and he hasn't had what you’d call a good track record with those.
"I wanna hear you say it, now. Not moving 'til you do. Tell me you're beautiful."
Sometimes, Tony wants it this way. Wants it to hurt, to ache, to burn. He goes above and beyond to test his body’s limits, test
he’d said under his last breath, apologizing as if Tony wasn’t the one who’d sworn and failed to protect his life in the first place.
The man jumps and lunges for the metal staircase against the exterior of the building, his robotic arm bending at an odd angle as it curls around the banister to pull him up. Steve remains in relentless pursuit, taking the steps four at a time.
Or has it?
Tony doesn't answer but neither does he argue, and that's enough. He might never truly forgive Steve, or trust him again; it's alright, Steve prepared for it. But he thinks–he thinks Tony understands, and that is not to say he anywhere near agrees or thinks that what has been done was justified, but he gets it.
The next morning arrives in form of watery dawn light filtering through the window overhead.
Steve strictly refuses to meet the man with kindness and curbs such feelings as soon as he notices one emerge in the depth of his chest, but there are times when he allows himself to feel a certain sympathy.
"Tell me, Stark. How much of you is really dead?"
So, what Tony says, finally, to give both of them some peace of mind before he goes, is something that Steve often forgets and needs to be reminded of. And now, too, it’s of importance–because Tony needs to know, even if Steve grieves for a long time, that he won’t clutch onto the emotion forever, even after it has long expired and has no right to exist any longer.
"Too late to go lookin' for the herd now, we wouldn't make it back before dark," Rogers shouts at him from over his shoulder. "We'll have to go first thing in the mornin'."
"Why, Anthony, answer the doctor's question. What
Tony can't alleviate either emotion. The inability leaves him hurting. It's out of his hands, now.
Mostly for the sake of a self-aware joke, he then makes a show of spreading his legs and dragging his hands down the insides of his thighs like he's this ripe, young thing ready for the taking–which, as established, he is the polar opposite of. He didn't account for the sense of accomplishment that overtakes him when Steve's throat bobs and his pupils dilate to the point the black is visible from Tony's spot on the bed.
, Steve.”
The realization comes to him in a rush.
He's – well, he's loud. Steve promised they'd at least try and not let the whole place in on their quick-and-dirty, didn't he? The alpha reaches up to where Stark is currently drooling into the sheets, fabric underneath his face already damp with spit. He shoves his fingers – his open fist, really – into the man’s mouth, and there’s a moment where Stark clearly doesn’t know how to react to the unexpected intrusion: He bites down and harshly sucks in air through his mouth, gagging, until he eventually realizes it’ll be much easier if he just breathes through his nose instead.
Steve heaves a heavy sigh that is intended to sound over-exaggerated but doesn't come across as all that comical. Part of him probably means it–constantly having to pull someone out of their spiraling thoughts will sure as hell become exhausting somewhere down the line.
Steve mutters angrily underneath his breath as draws himself up tall to push through them. "Thank you, Donna," he tells her, smile grateful but strained, and then raises his voice to address the crowd.
Tony knows that, too, because he groans in frustration meant to mask his fear and drags a hand over his face to (not so) subtly wipe the tear tracks away even before Steve opens his mouth to decline. “You’ll need to restrain me at least,” he adds, with a finality.
Stark’s breath stutters for a moment, but he manages to respond. “That– is not the same thing, and you know it. I was completely out of it and people were asleep. This is, is like performing for an audience.”
Because there’s Tony, and he’s now frantically scrubbing his forearm as he pours water over it in excessive quantities.
Anthony, of course, claimed that he did not need to be escorted by half a dozen men who could do many other, much more useful things with the time they now wasted, but James chose not to listen. He was the Captain of Guard, and he would not take unnecessary risks.
Apart from the humiliatingly obvious and near constant
It is better this way, less of a hassle. Easier to run from his demons, too.
“Uh,” he answered, intelligently.
There were hymns and hero's tales written about this Lord, yet she could not see how or why the Lord Rhodes she knew would speak so highly of this man.
Steve's pace grows more confident after a while, long pulls and deep pushes that leave Tony breathless. He’s close already–a little harder and a hand on his cock might tip him over the edge. Tony considers telling him to go slow, doesn't want it to be over so soon, but then Steve grips his hips in earnest and starts pulling Tony back onto him in time with his more urgent thrusts and the thought evaporates into nothing. Instead of words everything that comes out of him are small, needy noises that keep rising in pitch, Steve wringing his pleasure out of him with each movement.
Tony whimpers when something pulls inside, a resistance that Steve, although he must feel it too, completely disregards. He breathes out Steve’s name, his voice an octave higher due to either shock or pain. Steve doesn't stop or even falter. He works himself deeper in tiny rocking motions, and Tony feels more raw and open with each one.
Peter just barely kept from gaping at the woman in bewilderment. “But that’s where they keep the– Where the family tomb is…?”
Anthony froze visibly, fingers tightening around his horse's reins. A second passed in which he neither breathed, blinked nor moved. Then, he turned to look at James, searching his gaze – and slumped in either relief or defeat. Whatever truth the brunet discovered in his eyes must have been one that placated him however, because he exhaled deeply and nodded at once.
It lasts for the rest of the month, varying in intensity.
Finally, after making sure that Tony isn't awake anymore, Steve stands up and pulls the brunet securely into his arms. When he walks, the boards croak loudly underneath his feet, but Tony only frowns in his half-sleep and exhales a shuddering breath into Steve's shirt. Steve carries him into the house and up the stairs into his room, wrestling with doorknobs and handles in his way but ultimately succeeding.
about you and not wanting to be saved?"
Tony thinks, resigned. He's got an ever bigger problem than he ever knew to plan for.
Nobody inflicts something like this upon someone else and calls it love, do they? Steve isn’t sure when he’s become a monster, but this has to be proof.
For a moment, it looks as if Steve’s moving to get up, but then he relaxes against Tony's back again. Tony allows himself to bask in the haze of the afterglow while he still can.
He figures it's now or never. After he has handed over the animals, he returns to address the man who's clearly in charge. "So, ah, we were wondering whether you'd be inclined to get us something extra for the next one."
"I wouldn't've
"She's aware of the time?"
He feels sick, but there is no reason or time to embrace that feeling turning his stomach inside out. He knows how blood smells, how exposed meat looks, the way it feels looking at a bone knowing it isn’t supposed to be in a place you can see it.
Plus, there was the added not-benefit that every piece of clothing would pinch in the groin area if not tailored to his exact measurements, and witnessing even the ever-impassive Coulson do a double-take at the sheet where Steve had written his numbers down for that exact purpose was a whole other type of embarrassment Steve hadn't thought he had still in him to feel.
"Yes. He is a good man."
Holding Tony a fraction tighter, he sighs. “I know I was wrong to do it like this,” Steve tells the sleeping man. “But losing you– Just the idea of it, it puts the fear of God in me.” He huffs a self-deprecating laugh. “I would’ve never forgiven myself if you hadn’t made it because I spent too much time arguing with you instead of, of acting. You know I’d never cause you harm if it wasn’t the last and only option. Hell, I’d rather the whole world burns before you do. You know that, don't you? You
His being awake is unmistakably courtesy of his daughter, because he's definitely wearing the look of someone who'd still be sleeping if he had gotten his way. There's an evident pillow crease across his cheek and his eyes are in the process of drooping close when Maria's excited voice hogs his attention.
Now, Rogers does turn around, a scowl hardening his features. If he's doing him the favor of looking at him because he has just finished his work or because he needs to be scowling at Tony for what comes next is anyone’s guess.
This time, it's Tony who is caught staring. He pretends as if he doesn't mind this happening, casual as he saunters back to the camp. Tony sits down on a log close to the fire and rubs his hands together, warming them over the heat of the flames. When he looks back at Rogers, he is met with a raised eyebrow.
Rogers scoffs through an eye-roll and Tony makes himself snap back to reality.
Rogers pulls him in, and something rustles. He has produced a scratchy blanket from somewhere and is now wrapping it around him, tucked tight around Tony’s body up to his nose. Then, they ride. Rogers does.
Steve, insufferable, wonderful, beautiful Steve, looks at him with sorrow and guilt and many other unspeakable things, his eyes wide at the sight of Tony. They're haunted with nightmares of ash and dust, just as Tony knows his own are. Then, Steve gasps in shock as Tony tips over and into his arms, finally,
"My answer ain't gonna change, Carbonell. Can join me if it helps your conscience."
The building's layout is unlike any he's used to from his days at SHIELD – then again, they've never had major headquarters in NYC, either. It's curious that this is one of the few things that would be different. Steve follows the agent's lead up an elevator and through a variety of corridors; he memorizes the way they came, just in case.
Her tiny frame is standing in the door that connects kitchen and living room, barely filling out the space, eyes narrowed in a scowl. Everything about her demeanor speaks of Tony’s influence, but if he allows himself to look more closely, there are some typical Rogers traits, too. (The way she lifts her chin an inch in response to his stare, her stance ramrod straight as she meets him head on, arms crossed over her chest in a no-nonsense attitude and  inexorable determination that tells him she'll plant herself like a tree right here until she gets the answers she demands.)
Tony smiles half-heartedly, a brief twitch of his lips that just shows he isn't even in the mood to pretend. Steve's crossed arms leave a window that bares the circular patch of scar tissue where the arc reactor once sat. Tony forgets it's there, most days, but today it's just another mark of imperfection and another flaw to remind him of how very vincible the apparently Invincible Iron Man really is.
anything, right?" he asks, all soft and cautious like he hasn’t just implied Tony's been hiding an addiction to hallucinogens for years on end.
Anthony did not pretend not to understand. He searched for Rogers' face amongst his men and smiled.
He'd never admit it out loud, not to Rogers or anyone, but those moments in the storm left him with an existential fear shaking him to the core in a way he doesn't think he could explain even if he wanted to. And at the same time, it gifted him with the awareness that he cannot afford to wait, not now or ever.
Steve hears him cry out his name, some nights, while he throws his head side to side and whimpers and moans and mumbles
i'll be honest: there most likely will not be another upload in the next months (school sucks and it's my last year, so double the stress) unless i accidentally do crack and experience a sudden burst of writing fever, so i apologize in advance. but again: i won't abandon this fic and it's definitely getting finished, so no worries.
"Agreed. How about, I don't know, say– next week, when I can walk again?"
And that's when he feels himself spacing out, strings of words falling from his lips without his permission or any conscious decision made, "I've always had a nice, ah, piece of ass, haven't I? Thighs too, that's all–all squats, baby. And I, mhhh, I haven't lifted he–ah–vy machinery all my life for no reason. I know it shows, in my back, and you always stare at my arms when I–that's why I keep wearing tanks around the workshop–"
Tony flopped back down onto the covers entirely, head on the side facing their teammates, which was definitely a deliberate choice on his part. They'd get to see his coming undone, every twitch and raw detail as he'd be taken apart by Steve's dick in him, his every emotion bared to the people around them.
“If I don’t–” His voice is throaty, a result of the two days he has already gone without water. Three hours.
There's a group of people in the recording, all in varying states of inebriation and some of them wearing pointy party hats. Steve's pretty sure he can see Natasha on the left and, of course, Tony, right by his counterpart's side.
Tony deflates. The rage is still sizzling somewhere in his gut, but it’s subdued, forced beneath the surface again. As is always the case, Rogers isn’t particularly affected by his moods, and there lies no satisfaction in lashing out when the reaction is so unspectacular. In any case, what Tony really needs isn’t to blow off some steam. The actual solution to the problem is apparent.
"I am everyone," she says.
Ross seems to consider this for a moment, but eventually nods and waves him off with a dismissive gesture. When Tony’s in the process of pushing the door open, the man speaks up again, making him freeze in the doorway.
Every inch too much too soon had the potential to hurt, even tear, no matter the amounts of lube and prep applied.
Tony, most days, tries to sleep well into the afternoon.
Tony has managed to lift and turn his head and regards him with glazed-over eyes, swollen from crying but alight with white-hot fury. Sweaty strands of hair stick to his forehead, and he’s pale as a sheet of paper. It doesn’t come as a surprise that he passes out a moment later.
Steve rushes to explain himself. "That's not why I suggested it. You know there's nothing I want more than to stay here, but it's not working like this," he says, forcing out the words that are like barbed wire in his throat. He's fought multiple battles he thought he wouldn't return from, and yet this is one of the hardest things he's ever had to do.
Steve thinks, the words having turned stale and meaningless.
"They didn't conveniently leave out our terms and conditions, did they? This is why I don't like being passed off to your secretaries. Middle-men are bothersome in negotiations."
This time, and all the ones to come, he’ll do right by him. Whatever that may mean, in the end. If it means to never even come close to touching Tony again, he’ll do it–with a bleeding heart, but he will do it. As long as Tony’s here, alive and breathing, Steve is going to cope.
Detecting movement in front of him, the Captain raised his head only to be met with the other's midsection blocking his field of view. He did not get an opportunity to speak – Anthony climbed onto the large chair as well, moving with astounding speed as he placed his knees on either side of Steven's lap to sit down without a second of hesitation.
"I'd like to. If you'll have me," he answers and hopes some of the gratitude he feels seeps into his voice.
There's nobody in the house, but Steve hears the two Starks from the garage on the other side of the building, and so he uses that opportunity to have a shower and put his sweat-soaked clothes in the wash. He won't put anyone through the misfortune of being in smelling distance of his body odor after a five-hour run if he can help it.
They spent many a day in one another's presence, Anthony's head appearing in the window of the wheelhouse more often than not to greet the swordsman riding next to him with some jest or other. Even during the evenings, they would be caught speaking in hushed voices in the light of the fire.
All that we have known will be an echo
Not anymore.
Ever since, the castle had grown towers and barricades and dungeons at a pace like no other; the old rock and the new alike held their own against a dozen armies and many more dozen cold winters, awarding it the name it carried the fateful day a lowborn mother carried her son inside the castle gates.
“You’re serious?” he asks, just to be sure. Stark snorts and gestures up and down himself – his bruises have turned a greenish blue and he’s wearing an old, dirt-stained set of shabby linen clothing they bought off a shorter beta in exchange for their ration of nutrient blocks for the day. “Do I look like I can afford to be joking?”
Steve curls his hands around Tony’s waist, rests his chin on his shoulder with a smile and says, “I want you to fuck yourself on my cock and tell me why
remember when thanos gave tony the ol' stabby-stabby? like, in the abdominal area? yeah... sorry.
A sweeping gaze over the vale that lay before them revealed that they were not alone, however.
Everything left of his deed is guilt and an unnoticeable trace that blends into the snow.
He can't explain it. Everything is more primitive here; if you happen to come from back east, it's like going a few decades back in time. For some reason, all is more filthy, too, except for the night sky. The crescent moon seems to glow brighter, and the dark of night is clearer than Tony can remember it ever being in New York.
Tony doesn't mind, although he does seem a little surprised when he looks up from the car engine that just a moment ago swallowed his entire upper body.
Among the leftovers is a steel box with a combination lock that likely got crushed underneath the debris. Tony gets distracted.
Steve was positive he'd been as transparent as a slab of concrete during their first meetup, but it seems Romanoff has figured him out regardless. Ideally, she would've stayed oblivious to her own upper hand until the very end. The truth remains that Steve needs her more than she needs them and while he hates relying on outsiders, there's no one better equipped to do this job.
waiting for it your whole life will make you mad. Steve's learned living in the past doesn't help, and it takes no genius to figure out neither does living in the future–maybe that is something Tony has yet to realize, self-proclaimed futurist he once was.
Yet, Lord Stark had led armies to war, and his heart had not ceased beating. To some, he was the Man of Iron, to others he was Lord Stark, and to a precious few, he was simply Anthony.
Steve isn't sure where to he's walking. Away from the destruction, away from the ruins that he's once considered home.
