Tony: I think he gets that. To him it’s more that he wants to save people and making the world a better place. I think there was someone he couldn’t save and now he’s trying to make up for it.
CoulsonPJ: He’s fine. According to Simmons, he has a few injuries though, but only a few which is surprising considering a building collapsed on him earlier tonight.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. Greetings from the road. You’re getting this now because today I have an hour of free time and the hotel has Wi-Fi. I’ve won’t be able to reply to that many reviews but I will when I’m able to. This is our longest chapter so far because Tony and Steve have a lot to talk about.
The Mechanic: BTW we don’t use actual names of the under age or any of the Avengers on this frequency even if it’s encrypted. Your nephew’s call sign is Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider, TMNS or Benjamin if we are using civilian-ish names. I added a filter after Benjamin slipped a couple of days ago.
“Somewhere safe, but Agent Barton doesn’t know the exact details.”
The new consultant: Just incredibly obtuse. I really wish you would’ve figured out your ridiculous behavior regarding Benji was a crush when we were freshmen.
Nomad: You could've told her I am pansexual or bisexual or whatever.
The Princess annotations:
Me: He already knows we are in contact. There’s no point in hiding it. Ross or rather his assistant is going to read these and just realize I am totally absolutely in love with my boyfriend. Friday is still scrubbing the messages, she’s just not filling them with porn anymore.
HSBF: After Siberia, yes. I’m sorry.
Red phone: Cuddle bunny, you’ll be happy to know, I got out of the Pentagon without getting arrested.
“If Director Rhodes was the one in charge of negotiating the original Accords I think I would have at least come to the table with an open mind. I think it might be a good thing if he ends up at State.”
“Who is he?”
“Terrorist attack?” Sam asked.
Tony: Same fears here. Although, the fact that you’re not asking me what the shocked was makes me feel like you already know, especially because you chatted with the ex-girlfriend.
Purple arrow 2018: I will. I love you, and I'm sorry. Nate says to bring him chocolate.
Me: True
(See the end of the chapter for
"But he wouldn’t have reacted the way he did if I didn’t try to keep the fact we are together a secret."
Counselor Laura: Is it safe to assume that Mr. May-Rogers never worked with a therapist to deal with any of his issues? Has anybody here seen a therapist?
Nomad: Are you up to actually doing any of those things?
Genius Princess: That would be most prudent.
Nomad: I also stumbled over a simple question in therapy.
To be continued
Tony: So I did the math and Benjamin’s uncle Riley was killed in an armed robbery two weeks before the first clip showed up on YouTube.
Steve: I vote for after. Where are you going with Laura?
Red phone: It’s not good for a high school guidance counselor/child psychologist to have a government stalker. It scares the kids.
To be continued.
"Although there are some pictures of my mom that I don't think I have anywhere else. I still wouldn't go back for them.”
"No. He won’t come looking for you. He just said to try not to cross his path and keep your head down. Ross still wants his trophy back and Talbot will not give him the satisfaction.” He’s not even surprised they see him as a thing instead of as a person. Tony warned him.
Friday 2023: Of course, Agent Barton.
"Yet that’s no reason for you to banish him to this place. Now we have no idea where he is.” Thor yelled at his brother.
Captain tight pants: You knew Peggy?
“I’m new to this having a sibling thing, but I think you’re supposed to want them to be happy. Of course if you don’t make him happy, I will find a way to kill you.” Fitz threatened. “By the way, I think Robin drew a picture of the two of you holding hands at my wedding to Simmons.” Hunter was not even surprised.
Cuddle Bunny: I’m not even surprised. Hydra definitely wouldn’t want you anywhere near them. Me neither, for that matter, which probably explains that ridiculous way they tried to ease me into the truth.
Tony: I am all but 12% committed. But I still need to talk to Pepper. She is coming up late Monday. We’re going to meet with the board and others on Tuesday before the SI Thanksgiving break begins. That could push me over.
HSBF: Not long. I didn’t know about it until her brother caught her reading the messages and told me. Now that he’s back together with his ex-girlfriend, his sister likes to read our text messages to keep “entertained”.
Tony: It wasn't me.
Steve: That’s not us.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are so fabulous. Welcome back to the "better choices were made" timeline.
Purple Princess: That is not a horrible hypothesis. I’ve got to show these to MJ.
Me: At least you left the safety of my nephew in the hands of someone qualified. It still doesn’t answer my question of why you didn’t tell me? Or Laura for that matter. I have a feeling that she knows.
“Most people would’ve had a venue chosen like six months ago. Of course, we didn’t set an actual date until last week when we realized that the Mumbai agreement was actually happening. Because of that, we have to choose a location immediately, or Julie, our wedding planner, will start hurting people, starting with me.” Tony explained.
Agent Laura: Flash and Peter. You and Steve are Stony.
“This is going to happen?”
Counselor Laura: Missions? You mentioned taking down the Watchdogs.
Me: I took the suit away.
HSBF: Even though you’re running off to catch bad guys in Baltimore.
“A ring that you made him get rid of."
Me: I know for a fact Benji won’t, so why should the Royal genius be any different.
I guess I really wish he would’ve actively shown that he loved me. You can get somebody all the things in the world but that doesn’t mean anything. It’s just money or toys or cars and that doesn’t make up for the lack of hugs and kisses. I had Mom and Jarvis. But it didn’t make up for the lack of Howard.
Iron Dad: I don’t know. You know I am the one in charge, so I’m going to go ask your almost step-dad to come to DC.
Me: I’m surprised I have to tell you this because you tend to stay off the tabloids, but I’m not that big of a slut. Are you aware that Pepper is the only person I’ve had sex with since 2008?
Anthony: Of course, my cuddle bunny. They have referred to me as narcissistic so many times during this that I think I could make a drinking game out of it. According to Friday, they’ve used the term six times in the last five minutes.
At times I wish it was normal. I mean, now smart kids get to go to high school and college at the same time. I feel like that would’ve been better. Maybe I would’ve turned out halfway well-adjusted, if I was around people my own age at least part of the day. Which reminds me, I have to propose something like that to scary May, the mom not the spy who is also a mom to a wayward superhero that she adopted. OK, from this point on I’m just going to go with Agent America to cut down on confusing. Normal school is boring and a bored Benji is a scary Benji. Gifted kids are dangerous. Bored, really gifted kids are extra dangerous.
Nomad: Yes. I decided it would be good to lay low for a couple of days. Although, contrary to what you think, I did not almost died yesterday.
Tony: I saw that picture, and it made Hunter very sad.
Counselor Laura: Something like that. If we successfully bring him back here, you need to get him out of that house. He can't stay there. It's toxic for him. Unfortunately, Flash takes out his issues on other people. Even though he's 18 now, he might feel stuck there coming back from this.
Counselor Laura: As soon as you figure out how to send me back. Will I even get back in time to make a difference? It's already been a week.
“I’m aware.” Steve tells him. “There was a transcript of the post-Afghanistan press conference in my welcome kit.”
“Some things can’t be fixed,” Steve tells her.
“I’m working on that.”
Me: I’m trying to distract you.
To be continued
Welcome back to the “terrible choices were made” timeline. This conversation takes place about a day after the last one in this timeline.
BITC: Did she get pictures? Did she get his autograph? Did she try lifting the hammer? I bet she could lift it.
Monkey lover 2: Considering your stance on marriage, I assumed you asked her to create a new identity?
Tony: Of course, they would pick that as the wedding day.
Venom: Also, you let me down gently for the same person twice. A person you have yet to make a move on.
Venom: That’s your great advice?
Me: You put Sharon on that list, but not your best friend?
"Still doesn’t mean that they won’t try something. I may be actually halfway successful. Ross could be in on it too because, again, he’s golf friends with at least Prick and Dick. I think his assistant called my assistant three times because he wants to yell at me. Fortunately, Yo-Yo just kept routing her to Rhodey." That concerned Steve. He doesn’t like Ross playing games with Tony.
“Although, I feel like if you’re still going to be giving Steve away at the wedding, you should at least let me know if you are okay with the prospective location. Simmons sent a 15-page email with tips.”
Anthony: But then he prevented a mass shooting from having more than three fatalities by melting the assailant’s gun on vacation. Now people like conservative WHiH commentator and ani-enhance person activist Jonathan Windom West wants to lock Joey up and the watchdogs tried to burn down his house. The fact that Joey is Hispanic and a member of the LGTB community just makes them even more rabid in their hatred. Again, a terrorist group tried to burn down his house, with him still in it.
Me: Because the Watchdogs and similar organizations have been using it to target people with powers. But if you use your powers to protect yourself, you’re the one who gets arrested. Don’t you just love double standards? Practically everyone else on the list would just bring us one step closer to enhanced person internment camps.
Me: Oh, there was no waiting patiently about it. We’ve been in here for the last 20 minutes. God, I hate Manhattan traffic. Wow, you really did stay up late to play with me.
“Yes because I want to spend our last night together without worrying about everything else.”
This conversation takes place on October 2, 2016.
Me: Yep. He is DC in the bosom of Agent Agent after his adventures on the Virginia/West Virginia border. I think Laura is going down to DC tomorrow for the sole purpose of kicking his ass. I hope someone gets video footage of it.
Nomad: I’ve always liked him.
“Fitz?” Tony asked, probably too afraid to ask why his friend was not available. Although, Steve would like to believe that this AI would tell Tony if his friend was missing.
Cuddle fiancé:  Everything?
“That would be useful. So what’s happening with the Morales family?” Steve asked, genuinely concerned.
Blue phone: Which is why you're complaining about going to ATCU ordered therapy.
Nomad: We did share a room a couple of times during the great Hydra hunt.
Cuddle Bunny: Sorry, I would’ve texted you earlier, but it took me a couple of days to find out where Clint put my phone. He hid the thing in the ventilation vents.
Agent L. Barton: I’m not even going to ask about the Instagram incident. I feel like it’s better that I don’t know.
Anthony: Don’t we all. Don’t worry, he’s dead now. Agent Campbell took out the last echoes of him before dying.
The new consultant: That’s partially my fault. I told Flash to text Benji to talk things out before they ended up sharing a room tonight. Why are they sharing a room? I know the lighthouse is enormous.
That night when Steve found a platinum wedding ring hidden in the condom box, he said nothing. Either Tony will give it to him when he’s ready or Steve will find it when he’s ready to put it on. They have time.
I don’t hold you accountable for what happened with the train or what happened afterwards. Only Hydra and maybe myself. I’m working on it with the doctors here.
Friday: Have you watched that movie? It’s quite excellent.
From: Tony_Carbonell
Blue phone: Although, when you put your new team together, you should try to focus on acquiring someone who is at least old enough to vote.
The Mechanic: Well, not normal fishes and spiders. In the case of the fish, it was contaminated with an agent that can trigger metamorphosis in individuals with a certain genetic marker.
Blue phone: I’m sorry.
Tony: Let’s see where we are. Okay, the next question tells me that Jane Barnett is a fucking sadomasochist.
Tony: Thankfully, nobody’s using it against me personally, probably because the royal genius has been reading our text messages to each other. I think she has a better opinion of me because of that.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation, you are all absolutely wonderful. So I did see infinity were already and it may influence some elements but I am sticking to my original ending. However there’s probably going to be more chapters than I originally planned. I’m sure none of you are that upset about that.
Additional notes: I also recently re-watched AOS episode 3.22 and realize that the writers engaged in rapid soap Opera aging syndrome when it came to Robin Huntington. She went from stroller size to seven years old in about a year and a half in universe. Because of the beauty of fanfiction, I’m going to correct that. So in this story Robin is 5 ½ years old and already has her powers.
Venom: I thought you consider the Princess a friend?
Anthony: Good, Friday will have it on my official Twitter in about 10 minutes
Tony: With backup in case he gets crushed by a fucking building again. Still pissed about that.
Nomad: I don't know
Okay your current job is horribly underpaying you. That’s our normal starting salary for Avenger medical staff. Normally, we don’t throw in the things like free tutors for the kids but circumstances are different here. I also appreciate a parent trying to protect their child. I feel like I never got enough of that from my actual parents. Thankfully I had some great surrogates like Aunt Peggy and Jarvis and his wife Ana.
Me: Thank you for that. The urge to go to the liquor store has passed. Talking to you really helped.
Me: This happened at the wedding? Piper said he couldn’t keep himself from text messaging you. Apparently, he kept smiling a lot.
Venom: Just us?
MayMQ: No bruising or furniture being broken. So how much damage was done to the plane?
“Who is Karen?” Steve asked.
Blue phone: I know.
This chapter takes place about four days after the last one and the reason why it’s been so long will be explained in the chapter.
Me: Because there are other people counting on me. The kids need me to not be like Howard. And there are a lot of them in my life right now.
HSBF: I thought you said no to the New York Times thing?
I’m not used to there being no right solution, just compromises. I hate that there is no right answer. It was so much easier before when you know who the enemy is, but there’s no enemy. Right now there are just different people trying to do what they think is the right thing. Even if it’s the wrong way to go about it.
BITC: What? Why? How? MJ doesn’t cry.
Girl Friday: Why do you have a 10 AM with the president?
I do wonder if I should design something to control when she sees the vision instead of blocking it all together. Dr. Leopold says we do not need these visions to change the future, he already has seen the future. I believe that the future has changed too much for what he saw to come to pass. But I feel that there is a threat upon the horizon that we need her for if we are to survive it.
BITC: You really have to stop doing that. I am so texting Afia.
TMNS: I’m young. We pick up things faster.
Person my boss is in love with: There are moments where I wish for a super villain time machine just so I can go back and knock some sense into Howard.
Me: Okay
Also, I swear I chose this title at least a month ago.
Me: Which may be a while.
Counselor Laura: Probably because Tony kept his distance.
Ana Jr: Of course, Sir.
“You know, normal people actually ask somebody to marry them before they start planning the hypothetical wedding,” Steve replied.
Love: And Ross could easily manipulate him into doing what he wanted.
Original A/N April 2020: Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are so Absolutely Fabulous.
Me: Which explains why TMNS told me nothing, but you’re an adult. Why didn’t you tell me the truth when you realized that my teenage nephew was running around the five boroughs attempting to get himself killed as a vigilante?
Me: Now I know where our Intel came from.
Hunter: So why can't my boyfriend know what happened to Simmons?
“It is a good thing I’m not a stranger. We even cuddled in bed together last night. You are the best blanket ever. All warm and soft. I like that about you. I bet you have always been a cuddler.” Jokes were his best weapon of defense right now.
"Because he was so disappointed that I couldn’t make things work with Pepper. I wasn’t even joking when I told you that he got a ring. He’s been carrying it around for forever in case I wanted to propose."
Me: Several. The anti-bullying one is my favorite. You should check YouTube.
Hunter: I'm glad to know you're open to it. We'll talk about that when I get to the compound. I’m still on my way. I’m in the parking lot of the diner texting you.
Tony: I really don't. Although it wasn't your boy. Hydra didn't want to bring out the big guns until they had to because the big gun would break when he's faced with the ghost of his past.
Me: Sort of, anyway. Okay, you got the leaders of the Avengers on speaking terms, which is what matters.
Nomad: Sharon said they put sunflower in everything.
DILF: I've wanted to ask you why you made him chief creative officer for years. How did that happen?
Nomad: She’s seen my work?
FRIDAY: Even though you based our personalities after Anna and Edwin Jarvis, Vision and I do not have a romantic affection for each other. We’ve always seen ourselves as siblings and your children.
Agent M: Yes. He tried to leave, despite the oxygen mask.
MayMQ: You love my new tactical suit. It’s easier to deal with the consultant when I can actually hit him or when is at least busy. But he’s still recovering from the assassination attempt we did not prevent.
Me: He is 15.
“And now, they’re together at a wedding in Mumbai when I could actually use him. May is getting worse,” Simmons said worriedly.
Boss: It’s my fault Ross is targeting his family. I still can’t believe they fired Laura today.
Football Hunter: Our lives are ridiculously strange.
Nomad: That's a movie right?
Me: Yes, and I’m surprised you remembered his name. Leo had some very compelling arguments as well.
“A friend who may become the next Deputy Secretary of State. I am still wrapping my mind around that one.”
TMNS: Yes, considering you don’t call me Penis [redacted] anymore. Although that name has taken on a different context. I’m starting to think the first time it was a Freudian slip, and you tried to pass it off as an insult.
Red phone: Apparently, I really need one after having a tiny breakdown on her couch. Crying was involved
To be continued
Girl Friday: Image one attached.
Lily bear 2018: Did they need your help because of Thanos?
Boss: Seriously, why do they keep using the honeypot technique on Cuddle Bunny and why does he keep falling for it?
Me: I miss listening to you to.
Red phone: Sometimes I think you have a death wish. That you hate the present so much that you wish you could be gone. Since you believe in heaven, maybe you think that you can join Peggy and Arnie and all the commandos in the afterlife. Or maybe you don’t think that and you think that if you’re dead, you just won’t feel anything anymore. I don’t know.
Although now that he thinks about it, Tony made a lot of comments about their possible wedding today during the ceremony. He really shouldn’t be surprised. Jokes were Tony’s number two coping strategy, just after avoidance.
Friday’s Tony Stark’s complicated relationships soundtrack:
Anthony: Sometimes I’m still typing when you’re new response comes through. I called Zephyr One to ask Agent if he would mind pretending to be you or rather Stefan for an evening.
"Agent Coulson says he is still drafting the report and will need to speak with Spidey before completing it. However, he will send you a copy once the preliminary analysis is ready in exchange for you not accessing the FBI database without authorization." The AI replied.
Anthony: Also Sam was always just your friend and he just tolerated me for the cool wing upgrades. Wanda kind of has a right to hate me.
Girl Friday: Pants were still on, but their shirts were off. Allegedly, it’s too hot. That room was 65°. I am rolling my eyes so hard right now. As well as sending the picture to both the princess and MJ. MJ never turns down shirtless Benji.
Anthony: It was Red. Yes, you saved 30 people from their captors, but if it wasn’t for the new spider fabric, I would be flying your body back here right now. You barely recovered from your wounds from before, but you can’t help yourself from running into the metaphorical burning building because in your mind, this is how you make up for not saving Bucky. Would he want you to keep doing this to yourself?
“That’s not true. You pretended to be my neighbor for months. I had no idea you were not Melinda Gardner."
Red phone: I met his grandson too. His team debriefed me after the Extremis fiasco.
In person conversation 6: And Fight the Break of Dawn
Cuddle Bunny: We saw and Clint said that you’re too much in love with someone else to even try to flirt with Laura.
I absolutely love season seven of AOS, and it’s probably my favorite. (Sorry UK fans who haven’t got to see it yet.) That being said, not that much will be used in this story. Mostly what I’m planning to use is related to additional guidance on how the rules of time travel work in the MCU multiverse. As well as some of the background information that can still apply to the current timeline. This is because that season is in a different branch of the multiverse than this story. Somehow this story takes place in a timeline where Hydra didn’t kill Daniel in 1955, and somehow, he found his way back to Peggy. How did that happen? What does that mean? (Other than I can’t have my new favorite ship in the story.) You’re just going to have to sit back and enjoy.
Cuddle Bunny: I think it’s called for.
PPS: I don’t blame you for the great sunflower assassination incident. That wasn’t your fault at all. Self-flagellation is not a good look on you. What happened was not your fault.
Tony: The secret really is open communication, which I suck at. Also, I miss Jane so much. She was the best PR person. I’ve fucking hate the snap.
Me: You do to. I’ve lost count how many times you have lately changed the subject or not even responded to something that I’ve said.
“Yes. Although, you’re going to have to ask her for the details. You are not here to talk about my relationship with Melinda.”
The Mechanic: Of course she did. I think she wants to become a Shield agent when she grows up.
“That would not be surprising. So let's do this differently. Tell me things about you that I don't know.” Because Tony has a feeling, Steve isn’t who he thought he was.
Me: A lot of people have that problem.
“So he did try to get Tony to dump me for Pepper?” Steve asked.
Red phone: You are just too perfect.
“Yesterday before we left. He is okay, just trying to work things out with Laura. Clint is still not happy that Laura joined Shield to get him a full pardon. At least Scott had to make a deal with the FBI and he’s on house arrest for the next two years because of it.”
May: I know.
Iron Dad: The minion was involved as well, which is never a good sign, and they don’t even know about Thanos.
“Why are you crying?” Shuri asked, sitting the tea on the table.
Me: He always was a snake oil salesman, wasn't he?
HSBF: Coulson and his team were the ones who did most of the dirty work with Hydra so I’m going to have to give that one to him.
StarkAE: I don’t even want to know how that was tested. Stefan is glaring at the phone right now. Actually, he wants to know if Melinda did the tests. Also, why wasn’t this all over the Internet after the data dump? That would definitely get rid of the hundred-year-old virgin rumors.
Me: This is a problem somehow?
“But then we would have to talk to each other without a guide. That could dissolve into yelling and screaming. We have to work together.” Tony wants to find the path that leads to their wedding and the two of them growing old together.
Agent L. Barton: I get that impression. We need to come up with a timeline of when he got the stones. I’m worried he might have some already. But he won’t be as powerful as he was in Wakanda.
Tony Potts: OK, I just decided to look at the notes on superhero antidepressants and other medications. I am deeply regretting that I never got to meet the Princess. We have to fix that.
Anyway, Get better soon.
Hunter: Let me prepare Leo for what's going to happen. Because he's going to have to interact with Deke. They can't keep just glaring at each other from across the room. Simmons invited him to the anniversary party. It's been rescheduled.
Me: I was hoping he would stay because we're going to have to send Yo-Yo out to you eventually. Snookums thought that with so many other people with powers running around New York maybe we need some West Coast Avengers. With half of SI still being in Malibu, my assistant was a prime candidate for a job transfer.
Anthony love: I would say something about the fact that I haven’t heard from you in 14 hours, but I’m very happy that you finally wrote back. Are you okay? Where were you?
Me: Oh shit. I was planning to delete that, not send it.
“Also, apparently Dr. Leopold broke into it,” Steve remarked.
“Crying while driving is the absolute worse. I try to avoid it whenever possible.” When in doubt, joke.
Agent M: Don’t call me that.
Friday: @WHiHOfficial_JWest or maybe you’re just bitter that @Iron_Man is an out and proud bisexual and you’re a self-loathing closet case
D FitzSimmons: I vented. I'm not going to punch Bobo out. I just think he's a bit of a dick. Nana has been working tirelessly to get him back, and he's just been running around fucking Hunter and living his best life as the head of SI.
Me: Good thing my island is a sovereign country, sort of.
Anthony: Him I really do want to punch in his perfect teeth. You, I would like to push onto a bed or up against the wall or any hard surface would do.
TMNS: Actually, you could probably tell her because she knows. She probably knew before I did.
Kitty brother: I’m in Norway working on a special project related to the current situation. However, unlike you, I know that sleep is necessary. I’m planning to return home with the artifact. Stark feels it’s safer with us.
Nomad: That’s a good statement.
Me: I never told him about Artie. I was always afraid that he would leave me.
Nomad: Tricorders are a Star Trek thing?
“I thought Philip was that AI?” Steve asked slightly confused.
Anthony: Laura is dealing with the teenager aspect of it and I get to deal with everything else. I think she’s forcing him to go to his DC field trip that he was avoiding because punching robbers and destroying bodegas is so much cooler.
Chief Mechanic: Agent Scary survived, but lost most of the team, buried Phil again, and married Steve. That May also adopted a bunch of Inhuman kids to keep them out of the system and probably away from whatever evil things Ross was trying to pull off. Who knows what that man could be doing? Perhaps something just this side of super-villainy.
Anthony: Apparently the way I save people is self-serving and a means to build my own ego.
Tony Potts: We should probably get busy.
Remember, we have a 30-day moratorium in effect for all spoilers related to new MCU content. However, if you need more Loki, please check out my short story Love is a Dagger (My Heart Has Been Stabbed Many Times).
Me: If I have a better opinion of you because of that, then it’s obvious she would.
Anthony love: Two days after we beat the purple son of a bitch.
Melinda: No, we’re trying to make new futures, but all the mistakes we made that led us here are still there, and they must be dealt with. Texting Tony is your first step.
Cuddle Bunny: So you work on your end and I work on mine and hopefully we can meet somewhere in the middle.
“Especially me because apparently, I had an untreated adjustment disorder.” And his reaction to the divorce request is making him realize that he probably still has an untreated adjustment disorder.
You know I didn’t really like you that much even before I saw you snap my mother’s neck in Siberia. Howard always said good things about you, but I always thought that if you didn’t die then Captain America wouldn’t have went for suicide by nobility and then maybe he would’ve been around to keep Howard from being a bastard. Not that I framed it in those terms as a kid, but I think of it that way now because I know Steve way too damn well. He definitely has a lot of suicidal tendencies when it comes to you.
Me: That’s good.
Melinda: There was an explosion at a power plant in Pasadena because Eli Morrow decided to create his own transformation chamber to give himself powers. He did, but his transformation resulted in an explosion that made Phil, a member of our team, and an asset helping us named Robbie disappear.
“I just want you to be comfortable,” Steve responded instead. He’s pretty sure he was blushing, but hopefully, Tony couldn’t see in the bedroom’s low light.
Me: I think we became friends because you punched one of those people out. Somehow we managed to stay friends despite the stupid stuff I do on a regular basis.
Genius Princess: One does not need reminders of their own mortality. But this is not death. You are literally removed from existing, and the only thing that remains is the memory of you.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hunter: Not you, other you.
Chief mechanic: She may also benefit from Wakanda’s advancements in cancer research. Her successor from the bad timeline is a jackass. I think it would be best for the Wakanda government to make sure he never comes into power. Also, I need to talk to the lawyers about protecting the bodies of my children. That way, in the event of their untimely death, they won’t become government science experiments. They are not sentient weapons, the fucking asshole.
Counselor Laura: My fingers are crossed that you’ll actually get a boyfriend. Potentially Steve, especially if he tried to send you sexually explicit text messages while high.
Anthony love: If there was a miracle drug, I would’ve found it already.
Director Stark: Also, MJ keeps getting you books on polyandry. I think she’s trying to tell you something. Just take the third option.
“I get it. When I discovered the truth about my dad in the shield dossier, I destroyed a punching bag. Then I cried. It probably should’ve been the other way around." Steve explained.
“Did Laura have her phone on her during the kidnapping?” Friday asked.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Different dimensions, but some things are constant. Are you OK?
“I like that possibility. Although in regards to question 19, there was a time I thought I was not going to live much longer.” Tony told him.
“Yes. Yo-Yo knows what’s really going on and they are working on it. She’s going to try to convince the Rider to stick around to help with later on.” And by later on he knows Leo is referring to the big purple guy with the glove fetish. Baby bird said they need the Rider to win.
“And broken up again in under two years,” Davis mumbled behind him. Steve wonders if he is completely unaware of his enhanced hearing abilities.
Anthony: Yo-Yo has SI PR working on it and Happy is not talking to me, mostly. I’m kind of glad he will be supervising moving all the Avenger tech upstate. Did I mention that the tower is becoming purely residential and commercial and no longer a superhero haven? The name is even going to be changed to something else, eventually. With the breakup and Pepper staying out West, more SI functions were happening on that coast anyway. It makes sense to take the Avenger’s name off the tower and finally move everything to the upstate facility. That’s where Vision and the support team is anyway.
Tony: I’m so glad I amuse you. So do we give him back his special lab coat?
When I sat down to write this chapter, several weeks ago, the last wedding I went to was sometime during the late 90s. Strangely enough I did end up going to a wedding during the polishing process for this chapter. There was a lot of glitter, rose petals, broken glasses, and party favors. That being said, I had to do a lot of research on this chapter. So good news, my computer now thinks I’m getting married. The things I do for a good chapter. Additionally, SPNxBookworm reviewed this chapter to make sure I was somewhat accurate. Thank you for doing that. This is in addition to the regular proofreading done by Evespring.
“The first time around, after the fallout with the Accords, the new most likely watchdog-backed Rising Tide revealed the fact that the president knew that Gideon Malik was Hydra, as well as the truth about the missing missile and satellite explosion. President Ellis withdrew from the race, and his replacement was elected.” Leo was not even going to tell them who that was. They wouldn’t believe him.
This chapter takes place two days after the last one.
“That president never bothered finding a successor.” Much to everyone’s frustration.
The new consultant: Which is a good idea because I was about a week from locking you two in a room together to work things out.
TMNS: Well, not missing. We know exactly where she is.
Agent 13: Yes, although I know you won't believe me until you can see him for yourself and it's just not safe right now.
HSBF: Can't your assistant cover them?
Anthony: I have no idea. See the honesty thing is already kicking in.
FRIDAY: That would be prudent. The man accompanying her is a 92% visual match for the image of Agent Coulson on file. However, he has a prosthetic arm despite outward appearances.
Me: No, you’re right. Do you think that maybe it would be easier if he was a full-time Avenger? No more dual life.
But six hours later, when Tony grabbed his hand in front of several dozen cameras, everything fell away.
Agent M: There’s no reason for him to be here. It’s too dangerous.
Cuddle Bunny: That had to be awful.
Me: It is what it is. At least they want to work through it, which is more than a lot of people end up with.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. It is interlude time again because Steve is still working on his listening to Tony thing. It is a work in progress. You have all been asking where Clint is and you're about to find out. He is the "me" in the first section.
Kitty Brother: I have been informed that you are still in your lab at the embassy even though it is 7:42 AM local time. Why have you been working through the night?
“You should.” Steve offered.
SimmonsJA: All relationships have lows. I fell in love with somebody else when stranded on a desolate alien planet for six months and gave up all hope of ever being rescued, when in reality Leo literally went across the universe for me. That was after the year before when I ran away by taking an undercover assignment because I couldn’t deal with my own guilt after watching him almost die for me.
Tony: And somehow you ended up with a Laura from a world where you and I are married?
“Although it’s probably a good time for us to actually get some sleep,” Steve suggested, still blushing.
Morgan’s dad: I’m glad Morgan has a friend even if she is nearly 8 years older than her. She’s almost like a big sister. This is good because, as you probably know, being an only child is lonely.
Me: I’m so glad that the food is now here, so I don’t have to make small talk with anyone for a while. I hate small talk.
PS: Could you not tell anybody anything else I said about Pepper’s new boyfriend? I was being stupid and you shouldn’t repeat things I say when I’m being stupid. I do stupid things a lot. I’m a bad role model.
“Good point.”
“Sometimes that’s hard.
Blue phone: Okay. Just be careful.
Time sent: 03/25/2018 10:45:41
I’ll see you in DC on the 16th. Until then, I promise to call more and actually look at my email at least two or three times a day.
HSBF: How are you blaming yourself for this?
Me: I’m sensing a but coming.
Monkey lover 2: I will add it to the list of things that R&D needs to work on along with the very long-range communication device that Robin suggested. Although, the board wants more things like ICERs and fewer things like Stark phones that last for two years with one charge and prosthesis that function almost like the real thing.
TMNS: Yes.
Cuddle Bunny: It didn’t back during the war. For some, letters were the only connection they had. Also, you pretty much said that you wanted to have coffee with me.
Tony: I’ll try, but my medical babysitter probably won’t allow it. But I promise to hold off on the fainting.
Me: Not everything is about sex. There are platonic friendships.
Me: I have to work on your language algorithms Karen.
Counselor Laura from 2023: At a minimum, I need to do at least two interventions and maybe help Tony Potts work through his Howard issues. It has to be easier the second time around, right?
Blue phone: Is this about the renovation again? I already gave Friday my approval on the color scheme. I'm just happy you're not going with hot Rod red for everything.
Nomad: Although is Commander Spock dating both Lt Uhura and Captain Kirk in the new timeline? It kind of seems that way. I was under the impression that polyamorous relationships were only slightly more accepted now.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. This is another Spider-Man: Homecoming associated chapter. Of course, this probably did not happen in the movie. But the purpose of the story has always been to get inside the heads of our characters.
Anthony: What about Not Another Teen Movie? Although I’m a little afraid to expose you to too much parody when you’re still getting your pop culture sea legs.
Purple Arrow: That is never a good sign, although that may make Stefan feel better. I think I will make contact with Slingshot for transport.
Tony: That makes sense. Of course, I would choose the day of the invasion. My original wedding to Pepper was supposed to be the week after the invasion.
Anthony: It’s just not being able to talk about things like this makes things unbalanced. I mean I am able to tell you silly little anecdotes about Yo-Yo using her superpowers to send me inappropriate jokes about board members that she would like to punch out.
Me: No, I think Hydra covered it up, but Aunt Peggy was smart and she would have seen things for what they were which is why she moved me into her house.
HSBF: Does that mean that Laura is going to stop monitoring him or that Melinda will stop working with him when she’s around?
“Hit me with them.” It can’t be that bad.
Iron dad: I also get to tell the president that she was conspiring with a consortium of aliens that referred to themselves as the confederacy.
This also seems odd because there are many similar beats between this story and season seven of AOS. Daisy even has a long lost family member and a crossover love interest that came about only because of timeline shenanigans. There were even more similarities if you could see my planned outline. I love it. However, I’m going to keep traveling in my own timeline. We are in our own part of the multiverse now. This also applies to what we see now in WandaVision.
HRH: Excellent, Friday.
Tony: Your ex-girlfriend asked her to babysit her daughter until said daughter is ready to go home because she’s being reckless and chasing after the watchdogs by herself because she is still not dealing with the boyfriend who died for all our sins. If you and me could have a child, that child would be Skye Quake. Your recklessness and my computer skills, as well as a tendency for self-flagellation. It’s a deadly combination and she has it.
The “Me” in this conversation is Tony. Steve couldn’t wait for his boyfriend to text message him so he had to do the honors. This chapter takes place at day after the last one. It is also taking place parallel to a modified version of AOS episode 4.8. After episode 4.8, this story goes completely AU for AOS. Although, a few things from season five will be utilized. Yay, Leo. You did it.
HSBF: Spider dad being one of these contacts.
Red phone: I don’t know why she gets to dictate that rule when she is the one who decided it was over because she couldn’t deal with me anymore.
Me: Yes.
Me: How bad was the sugar high?
Red spider: He’s awful at passwords.
Me: The horror. I’ll talk to you when you get home.
“I learned from my big sister.” The AI replied.
The new consultant: You really should. I’m now glad I’m a Jones instead of a Johnson, cool superhero cousin non-withstanding.
HSBF: We do a lot for our friends.
From: Tony_Carbonell
From: The Mechanic
Blue phone: Who?
“You adore me. Go cuddle with Parker, and I’ll go deal with Ned in the kitchen. I will bring food.”
Counselor Laura: What question resulted in you revealing that you used his propaganda poster for personal time? I’m currently texting while we’re driving to meet up with our potential new therapist over coffee. I hope I am successful.
Me: Which is good. You can help us with finding the Superior. Apparently, he’s obsessed with Phil.
“Because you had Andrew and you lost Andrew, but Phil is not Andrew.”
The boss: We should still work on doing what we can here. I want to do an all-hands meeting tomorrow with everybody.
Tony: The drinking got so much worse after Anna died. I guess that’s because he blamed himself since the bullet was for him. Kid me didn’t know that so he blamed himself for Howard’s shitty parenting.
Tony: So I assume that you have safely checked out of the hotel by this point and are on your way to undisclosed location number 623?
Football Hunter: As for the things that will still happen, one of those things is Puerto Rico, which you can actually affect more at SI. The lack of electricity was a contributing factor to what happened from what you told me. SI’s clean energy work can help with that.
“You taste like Cabernet?” Tony said as he pulled away.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You keep me creative.
"For Spidey?" Steve asked his boyfriend for clarification.
Anthony love: Any group that refers to itself as the Confederacy is not a group that you want to go anywhere near.
“I better get a briefing,” Tony grumbled under breath.
"Yes. I just received a text message from Yo-Yo, and apparently, this is not just a social visit for the Fitzsimmons' first-anniversary party. We are having an all-hands meeting with everyone else not in Mumbai right now to sign the agreement. It's probably a readout on the earlier Asgardian encounter. Maybe Daisy made contact. Agent Scary is kind of glaring at me right now." Tony turns his communications watch around so Steve can see that May really is glaring at him.
The Mechanic: If TMNS would’ve been younger like five, you would’ve been told right away. As long as we were sure you would not endanger him. But he’s not a little kid. He’s a 15-year-old who should have some autonomy. He wasn’t ready for you to find out and this wasn’t my secret to tell. Being dragged out of the closet is not fun. I was trying to keep him safe until he was ready to tell you, but you can’t wrap 15-year-olds in bubble wrap.
I want us to be friends again. I want us to build back what we were. No, that's not right. I want us to build something new, whatever that might be. I wasn't sure how to go about it. There was just all this bitterness and anger inside. I also needed time to let go of the notion that I could fix myself to make you love me in that way again. What I needed to realize is that I don't need to change to make you love me. I need to find someone who will love me, fuck ups and all and I have it. Steve has definitely had front row seats to all of the fuck ups. After Siberia, I really can’t see how he can.
Genius Princess: I want to pick up pizza for everybody
“And the same thing happened with Agent Khan?” Tony asked.
Blue phone: I haven't done that once during these text messages and you curse worse than Dum Dum when he's pissed.
“Before Friday was banned from telling me anything, she told me that you and Tony never really recovered from Siberia even though it’s been seven years. She said your relationship with Tony is, and I quote complicated. Is that true?” Laura asked even though her conversation with Tony earlier confirmed that.
Nomad: That’s why I think she’s nice. My mom would have done the same thing.
Venom: That is not surprising. At least I didn’t freak out, nor did I tweet about it. Me knowing Spider-Man would get rid of my pariah status at school. I know they’re still all pissed off at me about losing Damien, our star basketball player, despite the fact he’s a date raping terrorist group joining prick.
Purple Princess: Yes
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. The AOS season finale discussion moratorium is no longer in effect now that the episode has finally aired in the UK. (Although, because Ant-man and the Wasp was just released in the UK, I am extending the moratorium for another month, to be fair.)
Person my boss is in love with: Thank God. I was afraid I scared him off again. Please keep an eye on him and if he does something stupid like drink his weight in Scotch, let me know.
After a comment from Shiningheart of ThunderClan, I decided that FRIDAY will be including her breakup soundtrack suggestions for each chapter when possible. Feel free to suggest your own songs.
HSBF: I’m glad you’re almost here.
Agent Laura: I see Friday being a little Emma is a universal constant no matter what form she is in. I wonder if she’s made any progress on Spider Venom.
Me: I make no promises.
Me: Some things don’t translate directly.
Me: Never. You’re so ungrateful. I think you’re actually being sarcastic right now.
Me: I don’t know because everything I went through gave me character. It made me a better person in the long run.
Red phone: I think that was the archer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. Your words of encouragement keep me writing and coming up with great new ideas. You’re getting this chapter early because I will be at Awesome Con this weekend and I’m pretty sure I’m only going to see my house long enough to sleep, I think. Stan Lee will be there which will be fun.
Me: Yes. Agent Agent in the flesh was weird since I haven’t seen him since New York.
“Regardless of what you call, we are trying to undo it by getting the stones back,” Steve explained
Me: You’re not on North American soil. Or anywhere else Shield has carte blanche to get enhanced persons to sign the Accords. Seriously, the worst thing you’re doing is taking out members of various groups that like to traffic young women in various African countries. Nomad is getting very popular with the UN.
Although, I’m ecstatic that Hydra Lullaby got something really right. At the same time, I’m upset that’s the thing Hydra Lullaby got right. I won’t say what that is due to my 30-day spoiler rule. It’s been so long since we’ve had anything Marvel to talk about in the comments. However, feel free to PM me on fanfiction.net.
Nomad: Do you know his last coordinates?
Blue phone: So are you.
“I guess love is playing a big role in our lives right now because we wouldn’t be trying to undo what Thanos did if we didn’t love people.”
Me: He’s kind of head over feet for Melinda, so I think it would only be a one-off three-way.
“It wasn’t a permanent death, and I acted under duress,” Loki argued.
Genius Princess: Half of the universe.
Chief mechanic: Apparently, you’re just now starting to undo the damage and inhuman internment camps, but you’ve only been in office with Rice for seven months.
Cuddle Bunny: So no coffee dates with your new teammates?
Me: Because at least this way he will be experimenting under adult supervision.
“They’re getting us a therapist. How lovely.”
Tony: I feel like you are despite the fact you said that I could help with this.
Me: I’m aware. Now you can explain why your new AI would be running things at the ATCU if you decide to take the president’s offer. What did the president offered you?
Purple arrow 2023: All good marriages are complicated.
Nomad: He never told me that, but I'm not surprised. I don't like the idea of them using Tony to get to me.
So what do you think is going on that is preventing Friday from her normal AI duties?
Tony Bear: Friday did successfully delete all the images from that one woman’s phone. Although you do have a point.
Venom: We got in a fight because I didn’t want to go all the way. I thought I was ready when I decided to go to California for Valentine’s Day, but I freaked out the moment he inserted a second finger. It didn’t feel right. He was mad that I stopped things and kept trying to talk me into continuing, but I just left and then called you.
“Actually, Morgan is Tony and Pepper’s biological child. Tony called her his miracle baby.” A miracle would be right, considering her Tony was extremely sterile. Although this Steve probably doesn’t know that because his relationship with Tony probably never included talking about his fertility issues.
“You. How I feel about you. As long as I was married to Melinda, and you thought it was a real marriage, I could keep you at arm’s length.” Steve confessed. “I don’t want to do that anymore.”
Kitty brother: What is the other mission sister of mine?
Tony: Maybe, but then you would be able to read everyone else’s minds and you might find out things you don’t want to hear so that’s not something I want. I thought maybe the ability to see the future but that could be problematic.
“And we need to help make sure she gets Daisy back safely.”
BFF Ned: Actually, was it all an optical illusion? He was supposedly in New York Friday, but there are rumors of the hammer being in Norway right now.
Tony: It’s fine. He doesn’t want to kill people which made him a bad fit for Shield and the normal Avengers but a perfect partner for TMNS who is still traumatized by his uncles’ murder and does not want to ever have blood on his hands. They might be good for each other.
“You consider Afia your sister?” Flash asked. It’s at that moment he starts to really comprehend what his friend being an android actually meant.
HSBF: What?
time that they tried to assassinate Howard, so I get it.
Coming February 14, 2020
"I no longer have a desire to kill you. So, I will avoid those things." Sam said as he perused the menu or at least acted like he was.
Nomad: I meant Friday and Agent Fitz.
However, after 15 minutes on the road and halfway through his milkshake, the awkwardness was getting to him. Sure he can text message Steve, but he doesn't know where to start in person. From what he got from Laura, it took his other self getting totally drunk to begin talking to Steve again. That wasn't an option. So Tony will have to go with the other thing his counterpart used to work through his mountain of Steve Rogers bull shit.
Tony: Not at all. The President is making him resign early A.k.a. Wednesday. Although, if it makes you feel better they might ask you to do more of those Captain America educational videos.
Cuddle Bunny: I would have a similar reaction to you as well.
Nomad: You didn’t eat any of them?
Nomad: Friday, what did Tony try to Tweet out that made you go first to Ms. Potts?
Steve: That makes sense. May retained a whole lot of knowledge about Hydra operations because of her time in the framework herself. It’s been useful to her now.
Me: He did not speak to you for six days because he does have a crush on you.
The New Consultant: No
Me: Also if you kept watching you would notice that his wife and now former head of the Jarvis Foundation was also dragged out in handcuffs by Carter, Jr. She would be the one responsible for at least the embezzlement portion of the news ticker.
Person my boss is in love with: Is he going to be okay? The press is going to eat him alive when this goes public.
To be continued
Me: Oh God.
“Kamala knows, and of course, my wife knows. She knows everything.”
“I thought things are getting better between the two of you?" Steve asked.
Cuddle Bunny: This is a new rule right? Because Widow didn't have any powers. Neither did Barton.
Nomad: You’re the one who said he needed to leave after watching the footage from Taiwan from last February.
“This is not your room either.” Tony shot back. He actually got the agents their own suite with private rooms on this floor so they did not have to share with Happy. Even though they were not his agents, he still like them enough not to put them with Happy right now. Seriously, why did Pepper Pop and Director Snuggle Bear make him bring Happy along? Maybe this was their new attempt at cock blocking. He wouldn’t put it past them.
Hunter: You don't want Leo to know all of that?
Nomad: I doubt he said that. Considering he was the worst sex I ever had, I completely agree.
Me: I really hope your Tony-bear doesn’t find out about this. He’ll kill us all because we let you go on a mission by yourself.
Tony: Between everything else. I’m letting Steve drive the rest of the way here to read through reports and send text messages.
Me: The new head of PR is going to have his work cut out for him. Although, I do like the new ATCU uniforms. Very patriotic. Apparently, the Shield agents are the best division of the agency. At least according to twitter.
Me: Okay, that was too much to handle with only having five hours of sleep in the last three days. But whatever.
Agent Laura:  Well, unlike most people, you understand her world complete with multiple timeline fiancés and everything else. You also both speak the language of science.
Also, as a reminder I will be posting chapters either early in the morning before work, during my lunch break, or on the weekends. It’s probably a good idea to add this story to your alerts.
Me: I understand.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. Here is part two. The title from this conversation comes from the lyrics of Save Tonight.
Tony Bear: Since you asked so nicely, that’s definitely a hard no now.
Tony? Is that you. Also, Star Trek was right about meeting yourself not causing a world-ending paradox. Leo and Fitz are like brothers. They hang out with each other all the time.
HSBF: This is supposed to be something you’ve been thinking about doing for a really long time.
Girl Friday: Agent America dragging you out of bed to parts unknown is never a good sign. I would ask if they went on a mission, but right now, everything’s a mission. I hate active apocalypse mode.
Nomad: I’m sure it will get better eventually.
“Why is she so upset?”
The mechanic: And just so you know, I consider Jarvis more my father than Howard. Blood is not everything. So I’m happy to be a good mentor to both of you. At least I haven’t traumatized either of you, yet.
Me: You would think, but no. OK everybody here should probably see a therapist or six.
Me: The corporate executive?
Me: It wouldn't be fair to either of you because they would be in love with this idea that doesn't really exist. Not this tangible being, who despite being an asshole sometimes, has some good qualities. Things would fall apart quickly once they realized that the ideal and the reality don’t match.
Captain tight pants: Near death experiences don't fix everything.
Tony: That is a ridiculously romantic answer, but I feel like there’s more. Be truthful, my little peach.
Morgan’s dad: [Exasperated emoji]
To be continued
“Things are different,” Simmons remarked. “As we’ve just discussed. I’m not sure if Director Rhodes had to make full use of his new exoskeleton to knock May out because she became belligerent after “being touched by a ghost” as Yo Yo described it.”
Genius Princess: Prepare world leaders for the inevitable alien invasion.
Counselor Laura 2023: I’m calling him Mr. May-Rogers. I'm guessing Mrs. May-Rogers should probably be there as well unless she is at Peppers visiting her kids.
"And you are in treatment. They shouldn’t use that against you.” Steve said with a frown. Tony responded by leaning over to kiss him again.
“We need the others,” Robin whispered as she continued to drawl. Who are these others?
Tony: Let’s see during the last eight months I have re-come out as gay, or rather, as bisexual (even though the press keeps erasing that) with a blonde God of a boyfriend who looks a lot like an international fugitive in South Africa at a conference. In addition, said boyfriend is more than a decade younger than me, if we go by the birthdates on the press release.
“Good night,” Jemma said before leaving.
I guess we can’t really do that one the way they intended us to do it in this format so let me just name five positive characteristics about you and then you can send me five back.
Xxxxx
Anthony: BTW that is a handheld device that actually scans for allergens in my food.
Nomad: You are still at the hospital? I’m surprised. You hate hospitals.
HSBF: You never know.
Chief Mechanic: Hunter, did your boy say he was too young to be a grandfather?
Red phone: I would, but I can't because I think Vision deleted our conversation or maybe my security protocol did it.
CoulsonPJ: But it’s worse than usual. Most of the noise is coming from bigots who are pissed about one of the Avengers being gay. It’s times like these that make me sad. Joey decided to go back to the world of construction.
"Not really. I know that there was fighting and he lost his shield but that's mostly because of what I observed afterwards. I know Steve felt guilty for hurting you, but I don't know what really cause that fight to happen. But we have established that Steve is not a sharer. I mean I thought that Sharon was his first kiss in this time until he finally told me about Melinda and the aide to the Senator who happen to be married."
“And searching for me was part of everything else,” Steve said sadly.
Note: Freaking Cool is a US-based fanfiction archive. Stony is the most popular Avenger ship followed by Widow Quake. 52.1% of the stories are rated M or higher.
Agent Laura: That’s horrible. She’s so nice. We’ve visited her a few times.  She adores Afia and Miles. She thinks Flash is a prick, but that’s his defense mechanism half the time.
Anthony: People have countdown calendars. However, I think your suggestion has prevented a similar fate at Shield. I met POTUS’s previous first choice, Jeffrey something that starts with an M, I think. I can’t be bothered to remember. I think SI may have engaged his firm’s services after one of my major screwups before he went to the government sector, but I can’t remember, probably because the major screwup involved alcohol.
Me: We’re having dinner tomorrow to talk about Benjamin and his extracurriculars. Coulson and Yo-Yo will be there with me. I’m almost happy that Clint did something stupid and now I won’t have to deal with two Mays in the same room.
The new consultant: Only for not having Alastair taken out earlier. When will I be getting to the Lighthouse?  You said that I would be coming over.
“I ask myself that question all the time." Tony joked.
Genius Princess: This is not surprising. It's not from Shield, but from the NYPD or local child services. We are taking care of it.
Blue phone: He did tell me that you were OK before he asked about Wanda.
Director Snookums: Of course you would run for Congress just to get your boyfriend back in the country. Sometimes I think you asked that I be Director just so it would be easier for you to have a booty call with Cuddle Bunny.
Jemma: I can’t be mad at him for moving on to you. Because that would make me a hypocrite.
Person my boss is in love with: I did not.
But we as a community had a very rough week. The loss of Chadwick Boseman hit the fandom hard as if it was a direct shot to our collective heart. He brought a character that we needed to life, but from all accounts, he was an amazing human being. It always hurts when we lose one more amazing human being, especially when cancer is involved.
Me: Anonymous fanfiction account. Although, do not read any of the Captain America fanfiction that he wrote before your defrosting. Most of them are self-insert, although if you’re Coulson, I guess that’s okay. If you didn't know him, you would think that he was making this stuff up.
Tony: God, I hate the board. They’re all so evil, all the male members are anyway. And unfortunately, the members I usually like are acting like they don’t like me to screw with the part that genuinely hates me and to make sure operation Leopold succeeds.
Chief mechanic: Sentient metal. I’ve always suspected something like that, but I am still surprised. Did the nearly reconstructed hammer let Joey pick it up?
Steve: Yes
Anthony: So I heard that Clint had to tranquilize you twice to keep you from visiting. I'm flattered that it requires tranquilizers to keep you away from me although breaking peoples jaws is not cool.
Tony: Yes, even though Mary is a capable assistant she’s just an employee, not a friend and teammate like Yo-Yo. Although, since I did the right thing with the robot that could pass for human, I realized I have other friends, besides Monkey Lover and Yo-Yo. Mack is making me watch Chopping Mall again next time I’m in DC. Probably when I get back from fun with you in Mumbai. I want to do something with chocolate sauce.
Me: I still don’t have any idea although Piper and the other agents are apparently not concerned because Coulson will be the real person in charge. I was hoping to talk to Rhodey Bear again but he is still in LA dealing with the situation that has twitter up in arms.
Me: I didn’t think it was possible to be this fucking oblivious (message not sent).
Me: May explained that. Kind of. Although, why is Friday still an LMD?
May: Piper is on her way to your location.
“Chatter,” Steve said as he punched out evil puppy number seven.
(See the end of the chapter for
As a reminder, they do not use the real names of any of the kids in the good timeline. The Bartons have a code system in place. Lila is well aware of the system and uses it as she is supposed to.
Me: No. I prefer that we use the fake shield version when creating Stefan’s history.
Me: Normally I would say yes, but General Talbot is watching so I advise against it.
"Not really. Just annoyed and frustrated with you."
"Especially when you can't watch his back." Sam remarked.
Purple Princess: Look, we managed to make an inner dimensional communication device overnight. I’m currently modifying it to see if we can pick up a signal to where Daisy is. At least we know what part of the galaxy she is in now.
Thank you to everybody who have read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. The end is near. Only 3 chapters left in this story after this one.
Tony: Yes. However, Morgan must be my priority.
Anthony: Bank robbery with alien tech. Of course that has been becoming a regular occurrence in the last few months.
Bcc: Stefan_Carter
Anthony: I’m your stubborn reflection. Haven’t you figured that out yet?
HSBF: It’s really a necessity.
“You really did tell your boyfriend everything?” She asked one eyebrow raised.
This chapter only takes place a couple of hours after the last one.
“Enjoy your sandwich. We’ll talk more later,” she made her way towards the door.
“Of course, we spoke about this yesterday. I wasn’t kidding when I told Ned I’m done waiting.” MJ said as she walked out of the guest suite towards the kitchens. Flash followed behind her.
“I had a ton when I put that plane into the water.” Steve acknowledged.
Anthony love: I’m still trying to figure out how to explain the time-traveling grandchild of Fitzsimmons. He isn’t even from the dimension or timeline that he came from. Apparently, he is from another bad timeline because our life is weird.
“He literally went through the universe for me. I should be willing to do the same for him,” Simmons tried to grab the book again but was stopped.
“Because I was an asshole. I thought we covered this? I’m willing to acknowledge that mistakes were made on all of our parts.” Tony made so many mistakes, several related to not getting sober fast enough.
“That’s not reassuring at all,” Steve whispered, and he was sure Tony was thinking the same thing by the way he rolled his eyes.
“And when exactly will your dad get back from DC?” There was a hint of worry in MJ’s voice that just made Peter place an arm around her. He knew she was scared.
Rogers: No, it was just a hunch, especially when you refer to yourself as Tony’s sobriety companion.
Director Stark: Because you like him like you like MJ and not entirely sure how to process that. Please don’t lie to yourself. It’s annoying.
Tony Stark’s personal cell phone
Tony: Probably.
Red phone: Better than Ross. He is misappropriating half the budget for his own superhero witch-hunt.
“When I was like 25. Sweetie, I love you, but I’m going to have to get you toys or something.”
Purple Princess: As soon as I can get someone to come to get you. Dad said he was sending somebody yesterday, but I can't confirm that with him right now because he's probably texting Cap Dad.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You're all wonderful.
StarkAE: I‘m almost offended. At least none of the rides at Coney Island were damaged because I would not hear the end of that from my sex on legs boyfriend.
Anthony: During development of the Mark II, I think. I may have done something like this more than once. This is why a virtual training module is practical.
There’s only so much flagellation anyone can take sober even when you’re a masochist and Tony is pretty sure that his therapist would classify him as such. Or narcissist, probably a masochistic narcissist. Is that a thing? If anyone could be both, it would be him.
“What about Fitz?” She asked concerned. The two men were very genetically similar.
"Because it’s something I wish was the case before." He tells her instead.
“I've always been the dumb muscle.” He replied.
Blue phone: Pretty much. I think we agreed last time that if we were talking like this before, Siberia would not have happened.
“Given the choice of anyone in the world, who would you want to have as a dinner guest?” Steve read off the question.
“Steve and I have conversed. We hugged in the parking lot. I gave him the Shield. We're good now.” Laura responded with an exasperated sigh.
If I really think about it, this thing you have with Stefan has been building for a while. He was all you would talk about. Granted, most of the time you were cursing his name, but I think I was just trying to cover up the truth. It makes sense. Maybe it can work better than you and me because he gets the part of your life that I didn’t or maybe I couldn’t completely understand. Maybe a part of me is glad you’re going to know what it’s like to be constantly scared that you lose the one you love.
Tony: Go study peanut butter cup.
The mechanic: It depends on his legal circumstance at the time but possibly. I’m not going to tell Steve that his friend can’t be there even if said friend is the reason why my mom can’t be there.
Tony: You will be happy to know Steve doesn't want to wipe out all the babies born in the last five years out of existence, either. So, our kid is safe.
Nomad: No. A romantic relationship would never work between us. We’re better off as friends. I would be the one being suffocated by her thighs.
Nomad: I’m sorry.
Steve: I thought that was what we were trying to do.
Me: True. OK, I will stop writing the fake ones because even though I still have some Sharon issues that are totally independent of Cuddle Bunny, I don’t completely hate her anymore.
Tony: I respect your boundaries. Rhodey is still upset about that but the Framework will be secure.
HSBF: Your turn.
Red phone: In DC, Pepper is not there to remind me that we're just business partners now. I’m not sure if the new paint is really going to help
Me: He actively helped Spidey with the Watchdogs. He melted all their guns. I don’t think he’s that much of a reservist anymore.
To be continued
Nomad: You made the right choice. He isn’t ready yet. You’re not a hero because you have powers. You are a hero because you keep trying.
Genius Princess 2018: That seems in alignment with Leo and Deke’s theories regarding how these messages will travel to you.
Me: I am still not happy about that.
Hunter: I realize that, but I still want one. Is it weird being jealous of your other self even though you're currently sleeping with his new husband’s widow? Although I guess widow isn’t the right word anymore.
Time sent: 03/25/2018 09:59:41
Tony Potts Stark seriously questioned his life choices after finishing his second text message conversation with Steve in two days. Although after recent revelations, he could use some quality Morgan cuddle time. It’s just to get Morgan cuddle time. Unfortunately, he would have to drive there with Steve. Which was fine because he had good fries and a milkshake.
Me: You’re not. I am.
FRIDAY: Lila loaned him her Captain America bear plush. I also have included pictures of that.
Anthony: Yes. Even though this is not the Secretary’s problem anymore. Its Snookums’ problem and he wasn’t that happy either.
Melinda: Yes. Leo and Daisy convinced him to be on our side, since it’s his uncle causing chaos. Leo also apparently made a deal with “the devil” to make sure “the Rider” sticks around. Leo is convinced we will need him in the future.
Me: Exactly, and I do owe him enough to not make him uncomfortable unnecessarily. So we’re just going back to old-fashioned encryption because apparently nobody appreciates the brilliance of porn subterfuge.
Me: Not anymore. Friday loves you.
Francis: That she is sober.
“You did turn it into a PSA against cyberbullying,” Tony said instead of giving his praises for Melinda. “It’s better than those videos you did before. Why did you do those videos?” Tony has been curious about that since the first time Peter mentioned it.
Purple Arrow: So, what have you found out so far?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. We’re back in under a week, thankfully. I really did not intend to do another interlude conversation so soon, but the muse wants what the muse wants. Today, the Muse decided that Director Rhodes deserved some quality Tony time. I don’t think he is happy about that.
Me: Two, Agent May likes you. Don’t worry, it’s mostly platonic at this point. After having one boyfriend/fuck buddy turn out to be Hydra and her ex-husband murdered by said Hydra boyfriend’s minions, she’s kind of off of relationships right now.
“May said I was too focused on the mission that I was obsessed with it, and I didn’t see the big picture.”
Me: Which is why Pepper can’t be in this part of my life. We were never going to come to a full understanding about my need to be a hero. She feels like maybe it’s another addiction. That there’s others that could step up. That I don’t need to put myself at risk. That I am just trying to absolve myself of all the bad things I’ve done in the past.
The Big Boss: I would also like to take this moment to ask you not to do a new sex tape.
Venom: You are too perfect.
Steve: I know you’ve been mostly reading reports, but did you start putting the list together regarding where the stones were in 2018?
Me: So, I assume that your king friend backed up what the ATCU told me.
HSBF: You know I’ll agree to just about anything to see you again.
Red spider: It’s not my fault that they assumed most of the original Avengers were straight, despite Stark’s gay sex tape from the 90s.
Tony: I bet it was hard finding out that Aunt Peggy ended up with Uncle Daniel.
Chief mechanic: Hey, sorry I didn’t get back to you immediately, but Jeffrey decided that prancing around Sunday morning TV was necessary for the sake of the Galaxy. I miss the days when I could go on Good Morning  America. You know what I think of Chuck Todd. Robin is the best.
Cuddle Bunny: It’s fine. Actually maybe you should keep everything. I need to travel light and I trust you to keep everything safe.
Me: Sort of.
HSBF: Fair point. You should probably talk to Jane again about doing this interview.
Anthony: That could be enjoyable. I don’t know why, but I feel like you would enjoy choking. Probably because it happens way too often to you on missions. Do you have any kinks?
“Give that back.” Tony reached over, but Steve kept it out of his grasp.
“If you’re a killer, then so am I. We’ve done a lot of questionable things to save the world. But we still save the world and we will do it again.” Even though he was mere millimeters from Leo’s lips at that point he wasn’t expecting the other man to close the gap. Yet, within seconds, Leo’s mouth was on his and everything else around him fell away.
(See the end of the chapter for
The Boy in the Chair: Or a comic book. The Amazing Spider-Man.
What happens in season five was detailed in the Princess Annotations part two. This time the universe separated Fitz and Simmons by time not just distance. Leo rescues her and they come back to the present to try to save the world. And they do in the canon timeline, but the cost is steep (I tear up just thinking about it) and the finger snap still happens. But hey at least the Avengers are still alive to actually fix things. Others, not so much.
Nomad: What was the item 47 incident?
MayMQ: Is he still mad at you?
Tony Potts: I should totally go visit the kids with the May-Rogers.
“So, this is where all the cool people are.” The man remarked.
“After we lost, truly lost, Simmons joined the remaining Guardians with Deke to find the ship that Fitz was cryogenically frozen on. You at least heard Rocket’s voice on that video. Tony referred to him as a build a bear.”
“With the lack of therapists, I haven't really been able to do anything about it. But I have suspected that as a possibility for a while. It kind of stood out during my counselor training. Reading the description in the book, I thought this is exactly what I'm feeling."
Me: Okay, I didn’t give you an exact timeframe, but I did tell you that he’s not dead.
Tony: I definitely would have liked a sober Howard. The alcohol took my dad away. Now that I’m not drinking or rather struggling with trying to stay sober, it’s more obvious how much I’ve lost because he was so deep in the bottle.
Me: Of course she does. So what are you doing right now?
May: You will be. Just not as my husband. I want you to be happy.
Warning: light references to recreational drug use
May: I’ll call her in a few minutes. So who’s the therapist you want to bring in?
Kitty brother: Why are you drinking coffee? You hate coffee.
“Yes, which was why I had such a hard time believing that you love to me or that my Fitz loved me. And now I’m really glad that you two decided that you would be Leo and he would be Fitz. This is really confusing,” she rambled.
No matter how much you love someone, it may not be enough.
Counselor Laura: I’ve seen stuff like this before. I’ve had more than one kid come into my office blaming themselves for their friend’s or parent’s death even if cancer was the real culprit. And I have others who start engaging in high-risk behavior because their guilt has convinced them that they are unworthy of living. I was worried about them and now I’m worried about you because you’re engaging in the same behaviors.
Steve: So, I heard from Tony last night that Simmons agree to go into treatment.
We have another shield IM chapter because Tony is kind of sort of driving Yo-Yo and May a little crazy. This is happening because he’s in the love bubble and though the rational part of his brain knows it’s for the best that he doesn’t climb Steve like a tree, he is still a little resentful.
“It was a possibility I considered. Sometimes you need a little help. Or potentially a lot of help."
Tony: I’m still sorry. I know you wouldn’t cheat on me. I was just being a dick. It’s my default setting when I’m scared. Nothing terrifies me more than children.
“If we didn’t have to come here after the Mumbai incident it would have been a possibility but I don’t want to risk coming back here until Christmas and I really want to spend Christmas with you. Besides, I know you have plans with Pepper and your kids. It will be good.”
Steve: Flint was the name of the Inhuman that put the White monolith back together in the alternate 2091 that allowed everybody to come back.
“Just because you moved on doesn’t mean the rest of us have. We need Fitz, and I had to take this chance to bring him back.”
Friday: Spidey’s aunt is now aware of his extracurricular activities. You also have an angry message from her currently in your voicemail.
Reminder, the only thing I’m not drawing from for this story is the Inhumans TV show. Everything else is fair game.
Me: I am aware.
Purple Princess 2018: Steve really married May there? That's one hell of a reaction to Agent Agent dying.
“There are a lot of things that can be blamed on your Howard issues.”
Me: Really, just keep Nomad away from the TV and Twitter. 90% of what they’re saying is entirely false. Friday has the kids on total TV blackout because really, they don’t need to hear stuff like that about their favorite uncle.
Tony: Unfortunately, the next question is take four minutes to tell the other person, your entire life story in as much detail as possible. See this is why you should be careful what you wish for.
Me: I really want to punch that guy out.
“I’m well aware of your Howard issues.”
Tony: Me too. However, Afia gave me one in the car before I dropped her off at Midtown. She says it’s one of her responsibilities as my kid. She also made me promise not to curse Hydra and Obadiah in the middle of my speech as well as put Mary and Pepper in charge of making sure I didn’t do that. Afia is now Pepper’s favorite.
Me: We talk about things that we are comfortable doing physically together as well as our hard limits. For example, I can probably do shower sex, but hot tub sex probably would trigger a panic attack. Waterboarding sucks.
Tony Bear: Pepper made me promise not to get arrested, again, in a foreign country. If I tried to make small talk again, then the probability of getting arrested jumps up to 89%. I don’t like those odds.
"Yes. After what happened in Siberia it became obvious that I have a lot of problems that have to be worked through with professionals and drugs. I'm not a healthy person but at least they figured out the right medication mix." Tony joked.
Please review. I really want to know what you’re thinking.
Nomad: Unless Ross is involved.
HSBF: How did they even meet?
Me: Yes. He kept saying no but Patches convinced him to play along. Of course, he decided to do this before he found out his kid is the type of person he Watchdogs want to kill for the purity of mankind.
Hunter: You managed to make a bridge between two dimensions. Imagine what you could do if you were actually sober.
Stephen C: Will you?
Counselor Laura: Are you saying that this Clint could be an alien imposter like the “Ian Quinn” that turned out to be an alien imposter?
Anthony: Is there something you want to tell me?
Me: Also, the project in Oakland already raised the few flags. I think that got announced while I was distracted with the Vulture fiasco. They did have a representative at Johannesburg for the first time and that person gave all the best suggestions. So again, I am not surprised.
Venom: Okay, why does the system redact Penis P’s name, but not Afia?
Me: It’s more complicated than yes, and I'll explain everything in person in a few days. We also need to talk about your superhero future, since you figured out that you are more important than your costume a lot earlier than I did.
Me: Yes. I think by 2018, we will be able to use the acronym. At least that’s what Jeffrey believes.
Hunter: You can’t take all of that on yourself. He could’ve reached out to you.
Agent 13: He's right, you can't be here right now. You would put him in more danger by being here.
Steve: Kamala could stay over and help. Your driver could take her back to campus in the morning. You still have a driver, right?
Lily bear 2018: Yes, especially now that I can talk to you. This made me remember what happened with Ross. It was days before Uncle Phil and Aunt Melinda got you back. I’m scared this will be like that again.
Pepper pot: You can't take back the fact that your other self married Steve.
Ana Jr: Not yet. I will ask him to do so once he returns from breakfast and his tour of the facilities with Simmons this morning.
“There's still hope.” She whispered as she gently kissed his cheek. “We may even have more hope now than before.”
Venom: Oh, my ex parents apparently didn't give a fuck about me being gone. Liz reported my dusting instead of my parents.
“And how does that help?” Steve asked.
Melinda: They’re still under the Accords for the moment and so are we. Daisy’s going to have to sign, despite the Senate calling for Nadeer’s expulsion, now that Daisy is sticking around. Robbie can’t.
Number one May: Okay, now I really want to know what is happening. Tony asked if it’s okay if you stay home from school Monday. He also wants to send Miles and me to his secluded island until at least mid-May. Is this an Avenger thing? Are aliens invading again?
“I hope not anyway. Okay, the next question’s easier. What is a perfect day for you?”
Anthony: I just have to say I would do so much better. You wouldn’t even be able to remember your name when I’m done with you.
Me: Bureaucracy is slow. See this is why you do not screw the married aides of crooked politicians when you’re in the closet. The blackmail potential is too great, especially if you want to stay in the closet.
Tony: And I thought the Starks had a lot of skeletons in our closet, but the Rosses are definitely more screwed up. I didn’t think that was possible. I mean, Howard covered up various assassination attempts.
Jemma: He’s very annoyed with Bobo one.
The Boy in the Chair: Where Aunt May teaches you regular life skills?
“If you add in the post implosion Avenger time, yes. Thankfully, they are counting it.”
Me: I understand. You’re in upstate New York?
Finally, I want to take a moment to thank Stan Lee for creating a lot of the characters in the story. He did not create the Fantastic Four until he was 39 years old after his wife convinced him to write the story he wanted to see. That means I have four more years to find that perfect story. Even though this is just fanfiction, I’m grateful to be able to play around these characters.
Monkey lover 2: Maybe, I can. But I can’t do it alone.
“I like how you try to fix things even when you have no idea where to start. I like that you’re there for me during this when I wasn’t always there for you, and I should’ve been.” Steve acknowledged.
D: And May PR is actually worse than Steve. Do you realize you have two co-parents?
Agent L. Barton: Point. Is Cruz somebody I can tell this to?
“I’m not going to run away from you or us if things start to go badly,” Steve promised and Tony responded by placing a gentle kiss on Steve’s lips.
Monkey lover 2: They’re still other things I can keep from happening.
Summary: Being human is hard. Being a teenager is harder. However, being a teenage Stark trying to pass as a human is impossible (especially when you’re preparing to prevent the end of the world at the same time). But Starks don’t believe in the impossible, especially Starks that have Steve Rogers as their future stepdad.
D Fitzsimmons: You mean she drew a picture telling them not to. She's not exactly the most verbal person.
Red phone: It's the old index on steroids, but with less security. I cracked the encryption in like five minutes and I wasn't even trying that hard.
Anthony: Like your best friend murdering your current boyfriend’s parents while he was brainwashed by a cult that worshiped an ancient inhuman that totally stabbed them in the back. Or, more importantly, the fact that you blame yourself for said BFF getting kidnapped and brainwashed by the cult of Hive.
“I’m going with overthinking but please read.” At Tony’s words Steve does begin to read what he has so far.
Is it appropriate to ask you how your mental health staycation went? I think it’s okay since I’m on a lot of medication and will have to schedule a really long session with my therapist as soon as I get back. I have so much to process. I may have used the wedding in India to float the idea of maybe getting married at some point. I didn’t bring out the ring, but I did mention I want us to have a nighttime wedding because you just know that villains will attack if we do it during the daytime. Also, the paparazzi will just be all over it, especially if I’m able to come clean about who Stefan actually is.
Me: On the bright side, he is paying L a thousand dollars an hour to help him work out his issues.
Anthony: I’m glad one of us does.
Anthony: Beautiful wonderful homework.
This conversation takes place about two hours after the last one.
“Well, I shouldn’t have tried to kill somebody in a roaring rampage of rage, but here we are. I hit you too,” Steve could hear the regret in Tony’s voice.
Please know I’m waiting for other chapters to come back from proofreading so there may be more than a one-week way for the next chapter. But I will resume regular posting once chapters start trickling in again.
Tony: We will die for the world. We both have actually tried and failed miserably, which I’m really happy about.
“Tony.” Steve said, placing an arm around Tony.
Pepper pot: I don’t believe you.
Counselor Laura: Have you been diagnosed with bipolar disorder?
Me: Because Yo-Yo is moving to California?
HSBF: Is she going back?
“I make no promises.” Steve responded and seconds later Tony was completely wrapped around him with his mouth ending up on his. Everything else fell away.
“Is that a hickey on your neck?” Okay what happened when she was with Daisy?
Tony Potts: I try.
To: The Mechanic
Purple Arrow: Good to know in case that happens. Since Hydra is dead now, I am more concerned about Lily drawing you in my place in our happy family picture.
“Well, considering we both had multiple near-death experiences asking us what we would regret not saying before we go, would be a really bad question to discuss. It’s not something I want to think about.” Tony finally acknowledged.
Counselor Laura: It's never the assholes. Afia, or rather Friday as an LMD teenager, helped Flash work through his issues.
Counselor Laura: I will remember that. The problem is we need to get me back. That’s not going well at all. Robin convinced Friday to send all of Deke’s notes to the other timeline.
Me: You make jokes when you’re worried right? I can’t believe I’m just noticing this now.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: I think this behavior may be a residual aspect of the Friday AI that is not necessarily compatible with my current life circumstances. I will discuss it with the Princess in a few days.
DILF: Despite the fact, the wedding has been on hold for five years.
“This is actually one I can answer. You did sell the house, but you sold it to me. The house is empty right now after the last renter left. I still have people that can get the house ready. You put their stuff in  storage, right?” Tony answered.
Me: Even though I also don’t want any of this in the New York Times, I’m glad you came to me to discuss this instead of trying to figure it out all on your own.
"Because, of course, the howling commando widows and children will be there." Tony is not surprised, nor is he going to complain.
BITC: Because you get to live on your own. I would love to live on my own. I’m tired of moving between my parents.
Me: Apparently, not fast enough. The board knew this was going to happen eventually, you know since the sex tape scandal right after mom and dad died almost 25 years ago. So I don't know why they are calling emergency board meeting's now. PR has been working on this for the last week. There was an email. I know because Yo-Yo made me read it, twice.
Blue phone: Yes.
MayMQ: After he unsuccessfully tracked us down after the fall, and his reputation for bombing first and asking questions later. Also, how did he figure the thing out with Stefan? He thought his own wife was Hydra.
Lily bear 2016: Connor is mad at you. It’s why he wouldn't come to talk to you when Afia got us. He said he would watch Nate.
HSBF: How’d the lunch with Pepper go?
Tony: He is my chief creative officer. Although maybe I should've been less cryptic since he's now missing. Pepper is not happy. The board is going to be pissed if he stays missing.
Skye quake: It’s not OK but I am learning to let go. Tell Tasha hi for me.
Me: How many broken bones?

“How did the call with Yo-Yo go? They don’t need you to come back to DC, do they?” Steve asked as he stepped out of the bathroom, freshly showered. He frowned when he realized that Tony was texting someone instead of resting like he should’ve been after their earlier activities. Although at least Tony wasn’t packing. He was worried that Shield was calling because the last time they called while Steve was with Tony in person, Tony had had to go back early.
Me: We will find something. But overall it went good.
HSBF: Understandable. Why have agents Davis and Piper come with you? They’re not here to arrest me on your best friend’s behalf?
Anthony: He also kind of hates Pepper’s new boyfriend and thinks you're some random charity worker I hooked up with after a mission, who is a total rebound. He’s just waiting for us to wake up and see it.
Thank you to everybody who read the last conversation. Unfortunately, there were no reviews for the previous chapter, but I did post it late in the day on a holiday.
Anthony love: God, I love you.
Me: You’re so optimistic sometimes. It kind of makes me want to punch you in the teeth or push you up against the wall and have my way with you. It’s a weird either or thing.
May: I mentioned Laura’s trying to bring someone else to help us plan and help with Simmons. And possibly for Thor. This is why we probably should wait until we have her to go to Norway.
Tony: Mommy is in DC either kicking daddy’s ass or fucking him into the wall. Who really knows at this point? Neither of these activities should be done in front of small children so I’m babysitting, you know, in case Ross decides to ignore his own crumbling house and bust into mine. The compound has better protection than the apartments at the building formally known as Avengers Tower.
The mechanic: Yes. I have to go. I meeting the Princess in like a minute and I’m already at the lab. I just wanted a readout in case I needed to fly out there, and you know punch somebody.
“The next question is supposed to be us using we sentences. I guess the first one is we really screwed up in Siberia.” Steve supplied.
Rogers: And since you’re talking to me, I assume things were sorted.
Hey, my Pepper Pot:
Red phone: I like my assistant and did not want to be responsible for him getting a divorce due to not being able to handle a long-distance relationship. So Pepper now has a husband and wife team to cater to her every need and I have Laura and Friday. I don't want to talk about it.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. So this is something different but I think you’ll like it.
Me: That’s really an actual movie?
“Does this mean you need to get back to New York to handle this?" Steve wrapped an arm around him.
“It doesn’t work. Mom disappeared, other daddy too. They didn’t know each other there, though. They need more help.” Robin said as she continues drawing. This time a picture of another wedding. At least some time she got to see happy futures.
"Of course he is." Steve sighed warily.
The Mechanic: Hey, how is the kid?
Director Snookums: Not always. I hope things go well for you guys, but I am worried. I saw you after Siberia. I don’t want you to go back to that place.
Me: So tell him those things, but no yelling.
Okay, now I’m even more proud of you. You are being a good mentor to Spidey Junior. I know he needs that right now.
“That’s good.”
“Actually, I think we should go down to check on the kids.”
“He was nicer to you than he was to Mr. Stark on the ride here.” Piper added.
Purple Princess: I’m getting reports from Daisy.
Tony: What type of idiot puts a sentient robot in the closet? Dummy still has his own room.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. This conversation takes place late in the day on October 24 Tony’s time.
Me: But you’re still willing to take that chance?
“That sucks. That is also another part of your history that is not in any book. Plus, you being bisexual isn’t public knowledge.”
Anthony: I love you, but I'm not having that conversation with her. That's something you're going to have to man up and do.
This interlude is from the perspective of May Parker-Riley’s cell phone. She is not okay. We are now in post Homecoming territory and we are a month or two out from the start of Agents of Shield season four. I’m tweaking the timeline a little. Also please note that for the sake of this story, the Infinity War prelude comic book will be viewed as Apocrypha. I may pull out things I like but just assume most of it doesn’t happen in this continuity.
Nomad: I assume you’re talking about Sharon. How many times have you been kidnapped?
To be continued
Tosha: No, she’s Laura. She is just a Laura that made different choices. Or from what I gather, Stark made different choices, and she helped. Apparently, they are each other’s AA sponsors.
Me: Because his original plan was dangerous. He thought it was an innovative idea to send the entire toy chest to the new facility at the same time without a whole army of security personnel on board.
“It’s a dad reflex,” Tony argued, knowing better.
I’m working on the next batch of chapters this weekend so your encouragement would be helpful.
HSBF: Wanda told you?
Tony: That is true. Have a good rest of the day, Fuzzy Bear.
Me: Definitely.
Genius Princess: Nothing is written in stone. It can be changed.
Okay, let’s talk about all the things I love about you. I love that I don’t have to pretend with you. You know about who I was before and not just what the history books say about me. You also know who I am now. You don’t see me as somebody perfect and I love that. I love talking to you. I love that you keep me grounded and tethered to the present. You always give me something to look forward to.
Nomad: It may be for the best.
“We should have listened to Hunter,” Fitz told him as they waited in the white holding room together. They were both lying together on the giant bed. Leo is glad that he designed this room for comfort. It was much nicer than when he was locked up by the general. Although, they should’ve put two beds in here. Of course, he never thought they would be hosting two people in the room together (he’s not going to think about the last time he was stuck in this room with somebody else). Apparently, Dr. Suarez felt it was okay to put them in together. (His other self wouldn’t try to rape him like AIDA did). Which would be fine if Fitz were not a cover hog.  Although, he’s sure that his younger self probably thinks the same thing about him.
Tony: Remember when I told you about our new timeline refugee Laura from the good timeline. That Tony decided to get a child through science and made an LMD baby or rather teenager because New York State wouldn’t let him adopt either.
Me: Possibly tomorrow. It depends. Look, me giving you big things isn’t that much of a deal. I mean the house in Malta actually cost a lot less than your gear, if I was billing the military for it anyway. For you, it’s a gift.
HSBF: So we make up answers?
“Excellent point. The fact that you have a boyfriend doesn’t need to be some grant confession. Just mention it casually in the course of your letter. It doesn’t have to be a big thing.”
The Mechanic: Hey, platypus. I heard that the Avengers and the ATCU were responsible for dealing with the Watchdog terrorist attack. And now the media and the public completely adores us. I figured you would have use that as the perfect time to re-launch Shield or at least that’s what Mister PR would’ve suggested.
Nomad: At least there’s that.
Anthony love: In the timeline that the FitzSimmons grandkid came from, Thanos managed to wipe out half of all living life on April 28, 2018.
Anthony love: I realize now I probably should have led with that. I have other agents going there to deal with that. This may be the other reason why Agent America is concerned. Simultaneous kidnappings are never a good sign.
“Even if because of this life, you end up losing them?” May asked.
Anthony: And yes, I finally accept that Captain America and Steve Rogers are two totally different people. Captain America was a god among men and Steve Rogers is a sexy asshole who tries to do the right thing even if he goes badly.
Person that cares about my boss: Sometimes I think you care too much. How can you care about me at all after what I did? If I kept Bucky from falling, then there would have never been a Winter Soldier and maybe your parents would not have died on that December night in 1991. I don’t get how you can still care about me after everything. I don’t deserve it.
Counselor Laura: Friday, how many days do we have until they contact us again?
“Maybe you really should go with the gift basket,” Steve joked, sort of.
“Biology means very little. Howard wasn’t a good father. The best thing I can say about him is he never hit me. Mom tried her best. However, Jarvis and Ana really raised me along with Aunt Peggy and Uncle Daniel. They were my family. I know they felt the same way about me.”
Pepper Pot: Exactly. I would go to them except with Deke MIA and you trying to get him back, I’m not able to take Morgan time off right now. So, they should come here.
Football Hunter: I know. I feel like maybe I should pop off to your office to cheer you up. I’m kind of looking forward to fucking you on your desk. See, that’s another reason why you have to leave Shield. I can’t be with you there. But at SI, I can make out with you in the lobby.
Red phone: I'm even looking at CEO candidates because I'm not sure how much longer Pepper’s going to want to stay at SI.
Tony: Apparently it’s been decided that I’m going to a DC United “football” playoff game on the 27
To be continued
Monkey Lover 2: Shite!
BITC: Oh shit!
HSBF: Are you OK?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are the absolute best.
“If she’s okay with that, then I am. I know she’s planning to come tonight. If you could please change the sheets in the room, that would be lovely.”
25 minutes later while Tony was in the shower. Steve managed to sneak his present into the bottom of Tony’s suitcase. Hopefully Tony wouldn’t open his suitcase again until he got to LA. It was at that moment that Melinda let herself into the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Agent Laura: Good.
Melinda: It’s his cell phone number. I know it because Morgan is always texting Robin from that number.
Tony: Well, Thor probably could, but he doesn't call, and he doesn't write. Plus, we are at least a year out from finalizing our new longer-range communicators. Also, according to Monkey Lover 2, he doesn’t show back up on earth until the day Leo got bounced to our timeline. That is nearly 16 months down the road.
Blue phone: Did you actually say that?
Chief mechanic: This is good because otherwise, I would probably have to ship my daughter off to Norway to see if she could lift it. Although she’s a little bit more mischievous than her older brother. So we may have had ourselves a problem.
Me: I think Aunt Peggy would wanted you to find someone who loves Steve Rogers. I think she would want you to find your own Daniel or Danielle - whichever works for you.
Anthony love: Just in time for the impending alien apocalypse. Perfect timing, snuggle bug.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony Potts: That makes sense. You don't want to know what I said to Stevie after Thanos. I think I just made it worse. I would like to blame it on the nearly dying due to starvation, but I know better. I can be a dick sometimes.
“In some of the countries being represented here, that is still the case,” May said poignantly.
Tony: Because Ben wasn’t ready for her to know the truth. She wasn’t ready to hear the truth. It wasn’t that I was deliberately trying to hurt her it was…God dammit.
Me: Unfortunate side effect of growing up in a house with servants, maids, and Howard.
Me: You really have to stop assuming that any time I don’t respond to you immediately, I’ve been kidnapped by Ross.
"Thank you all the same."
Tony Potts: I don’t want to know exactly what Steve told other me because I want this Steve to tell me those things. I don’t want to cheat. I want him to trust me enough to open up.
Boss Tony: According to Friday, this is your phone number. Strangely enough, it was never assigned to another member.
“Seriously, who comes up with these names?” Steve asked, wiping away a tear as he tried to put himself back into mission mode. Natasha handed him an iPad with his mission report. He was almost glad it wasn’t a Stark pad because that would remind him of Tony.
The Mechanic: Please don’t say State Department. They deserve better After Ross.
TMNS: That would be Phil, but he’s safe now. Or as safe as you can be trying to convince the president to actually do stuff in DC.
Could Peter be keeping a big secret from you? Probably. If he is, then maybe he’s afraid of how you will react when the truth comes out. I never told my dad I was also into men. I was too terrified to. I didn’t want to be different and I felt hiding was easier. I didn’t want to make him even more disappointed in me than he already was. I always felt like I was never good enough for him. I regret the fact we never had that conversation, especially because I recently found out that he knew and was okay with it. Peter will tell you when he’s ready and hopefully you won’t find out via a video from YouTube.
“Five, but let’s just do three.” Because Tony is worried about Steve being able to name five positive qualities about him.
Anyway keep me posted on your mission. We will talk again when I’m in DC. I hope things work out that you will be able to have lunch with me.
Subject: Re: Seriously, Tony! Call me!
Me: Yes. The Junior Archers need their dad back. I can deal with blue balls for a few more weeks.
If you've been following me for a while, you know that I lost two family members to cancer around Thanksgiving 2015. One right before and one right after. Boseman's death has brought back a lot of those memories. I do empathize with his family and loved ones. This is not an easy loss; it never is. It takes time to process grief, and then it's never truly processed. You just get better at dealing with it. Grief isn't linear. You move forward, but you don't really move on. Sometimes moving forward involves a zigzag pattern. But talking about grief helps us move forward, we have to.
“Answer the incoming message from Peter. I will monitor all social media channels for you.”
Me: You don’t need to be. I just survived Director Snookums giving me a polygraph on a machine designed to tell if Nat is lying through her teeth. But I’m not in Vault D so I passed, I think.
Steve: Neither can you. We wouldn’t be trying to do what we're doing if we could let go. Simmons was wrong. Neither one of us has moved on.
HSBF: Pepper awkwardness aside, how did your Labor Day events go?
Me: Probably, but she needs protection. Let’s just say there was a reason why Tony punched out his original doctor and leave it at that. The new shield doctors think that they’re going to be able to lift the sedation by late tomorrow. I’ll keep you posted. Keep Nomad in whatever country you’re in.
Steve: What?
May: Pepper sent that to me while we were talking.
Girl Friday: Okay, I’ve checked your lab, and you’re not there, which is good. You’re also not anywhere else. Not good. I guess it’s time to ask my little sister for help.
Tosha: Where are you? Seriously you’re missing chocolate chip cookies. Some of them have mini Reesie cups in them too.
Anthony: I don’t know. People like Windom West and Everhart are just making it worse.
“Not anytime soon at least. I'm having Friday analyze the Twitter reactions to Clint coming back. So far most of its positive, but Ross is on the warpath." Which was what Tony originally thought Coulson was going to contact him about, not the Spidey thing.
“I’m sure Steve is still texting his wife right now. Sugarplum, ask the wife if she is coming over tonight or tomorrow?”
HSBF: Was this what you are talking about last time?
“Thank you. Can you look into getting me one of the regular Avenger secret phones?” He is not making this mistake again.
Chief Mechanic: That’s a pretentious name for a group of superheroes.
Me: I think she’s right. Looking back on it, if I told you all about my plans to restart the Ultron security project somebody would have tranquilized me before I created a murder bot.
HSBF: Good for her. I guess it is serious?
Monkey lover 2: Maybe, or maybe we are going to keep making the same mistakes over and over again. Or worse, new ones that will lead to the same bad outcome or completely new one. What if nothing I do makes a difference? What if all roads still lead to hell and I’m just taking a different path to get there? I tried to keep Robin from getting her powers in the first place. Instead she got them earlier.
Pepper pot: I understand you thought you were sterile. I thought you were sterile. It's why I wasn't worried when I was not able to get my favorite birth control due to the rationing right after the decimation.
The mechanic: That's pretty much always been Steve's nickname. That should have told Steve Barnes knew about the boyfriend years ago, but my cuddle bunny doesn’t always see what’s in front of him until it slaps him in the face. Sometimes, literally.
To be continued…
Me: Only if you are sincere.
Hunter: I'm fantastic with kids. I volunteer at Midtown all the time. The children love me.
Tony: You’re evil.
Jemma: Okay. I’ll be waiting.
This chapter takes place about four days after the last one, on Wednesday, September 15 2016. In my universe, Peter and his classmates will be at finals on September 16. I reserve the right to make this change because it makes more sense for the event to be on a Friday and unlike the writers of the movie, I can do math. Really, the eight years later thing was the one thing I hated the most and that includes that upstate New York scene.
Tony: Me having a boyfriend would be bad enough for Ellis. He is from the party of “family values”. And me being a liberal leading independent is a hard enough sell with his party already. I’m just glad this isn’t going to need a confirmation hearing.
“Does Morgan need another story? She’s already had three.” Morgan didn’t want him to leave. Although he adored Tony’s daughter, he also needed sleep. Which seems weird. He’s gone for days without sleep because of missions. However, a full day around Tony has mentally exhausted him in a completely different way.
Tony Potts: Why do I feel like there’s a lot I don’t know? I hate it when I don't know stuff.
Anthony: I hope not.
TMNS: I know. Afia probably can tell you things I can’t.
Of course you knew about Artie. Tony says, best friends always know stuff like that. I should’ve known that you would know, but I was just scared and I wasn’t ready to talk about it. Honestly, a part of me was hoping that if I had the right woman, the other part would go away too. That’s how people thought back when we were growing up. I thought Peggy could be that one. Maybe she could have been if things were different, but I wonder if it would’ve been enough.
“Of course it is.”
Friday: Not yet but he will be informed soon.
“Lollipop Lover?” He winks at him.
Anthony: Okay now they’re just making stupid shit up and bringing innocent people into it.
Genius Princess 2018: Yes, I mentioned earlier that he would like to know how his grandmother is doing. Ana said that she's going to push some messages to her through the system. Consultant Fitzsimmons is very concerned with her alcoholism. He asked Flash about his treatment strategy. I'm sure if Dr. Stark was here, Consultant Fitzsimmons would ask him the same questions.
“I trust Tony with my daughter. There’s not a lot of people around that I would, but he’s top of the list.” Steve tells her.
"This means like two dozen phone calls, starting with Jane the PR goddess, the deputy head of security because Happy is kind of sort of suspended right now, and Pepper.” The Pepper conversation was going to be brutal. “Is it late there or early in Malibu right now?" He asked turning to Steve.
“Tony feels the same way. He loves kids but can’t have any without at least a sperm donor because of the Palladium poisoning.”
SimmonsJA: I may have been slightly enamored with you in college. It’s always difficult trying to get your PhD before you’re old enough to have a driver’s license. At least I had a role model in you. It doesn’t make what I’m saying any less valid. If things go well, you’ll be able to see each other more often and then by that point, you’ll be ready to cross the horizon.
Nomad: It was okay. We are still in the getting to know each other phase. I have another session tomorrow so hopefully we’ll get to talk about some real things.
: Phillip J. "Phil" Coulson former director of SHIELD and current agent. According to intelligence, he is the one who knows what he is doing. Died during the battle of New York, but only temporary.
“Although then we will be working on our wedding." Fingers crossed, they both survive this.
From: The Mechanic
FRIDAY: They agreed to my counsel that both Laura and Colonel Rhodes be there.
“Acknowledgement is the first step. We can stop for now, and I can ask you more questions about your time as a bartender at an underground gay bar. That seems fascinating.” Tony really has so many questions about that.
Tony: OK, one last question because I think we should save that emotionally draining stuff for later or for email but you’re sending me yours first.
Blue phone: How many admirals did you tell to go screw themselves?
Rogers: And you have not told Tony.
To be continued…
Me: And then Friday can you text me and let me know what you decide. It’s your call. I will support you.
Red phone: Ridiculously so. Is it cute? Am I supposed to think that it's cute?
From: The Mechanic
Love: Hey nice delay tactic, but what’s true? Are we going to be paying for grief counselors for the kids?
D: You know where Bruce is?
Me: You don't need to know. Don't worry. He won't get anything from me.
The Mechanic: OK, I will send the car. Please send Yo-Yo any menu requests. Though no alcohol because I’m 12 step-ing. You can ask her any questions you have about being a powered person.
Even though Tony and Steve are in the same country, they are still going to end up texting each other, especially during a wedding, which is going to take at least three hours. Okay, Tony is sending Steve text messages despite the fact he sitting right next to Steve and Steve may occasionally respond verbally. It’s a three-hour wedding, not including the reception that will last late into the night because Tony’s friends decided to have it all in one day (instead of the next day, which is more common). Also please note that Tony is not texting Steve constantly. Sometimes there could be gaps for 15 or 20 minutes between messages.
Tony: Okay, he probably won’t be back in the morning. I know you want Deke back, but we're working on it. And to do that, we need Hunter.
Red phone: This is easy by comparison. I know you will never love me, but I think maybe you actually like me as a person now, which is more than what we had before.
Red phone: If I see her when I’m forced to take a meeting with the ATCU soon, I’ll say hi for you.
Red phone: You’ll always be Captain Tight Pants to me, even if Vision tells me you don’t want to be called Captain anything anymore.
I despise this one-way exchange of information. They want to know everything about where I’m from, but won’t tell me anything of use. Of course, I’m holding some things back as well. No way am I going to mention that Leo decided not to look for a way to come back to his original timeline and is essentially married to someone else. I’m pretty sure this Simmons is holding on by a thread. She tried to come to see me once and started crying. I overheard somebody saying something about Fitz also being dusted, which confuses me. I would love for clarification, but again no one is telling me anything.
Nomad: I just walked into that.
Me: Don’t die.
“Do I need to brush my teeth?" Steve asked.
“Last week, I went to him to ask for his help with our attempt to create time travel using the Pym Particles to undo what happened. The only thing he was willing to do was to watch Robin. I think he doesn’t want to help because deep down, he still hates me.” Steve tells her. Laura was personally fighting off the desire to shake Steve. Really, she thought she was so done with Tony and Steve pining after one another. There’s also Steve being too self-absorbed to realize not everything is about him. Here we go again. Maybe she should’ve let Steve come across Tony’s ramblings to her earlier. Perhaps that would help him get a clue.
Red phone: I'm almost tempted to make them their own supersecret communication device so they stop using us as intermediaries for their teenage shenanigans.
Anthony: Maybe Clint is sort of a friend in a ‘thank you for joining forces with your nemesis to rescue my wife from the clutches of the bastard’ sort of way.
"I wasn’t planning to actually send that.” Steve responded with a glare.
Anthony: You know, totally below our pay grade, but we keep having to deal with it because they’re annoying little insects.
May: From what I heard about the kid, that’s necessary.
Venom: Which is bull shit because Tony is such a better dad than my parents. Any child would be happy to have him as a father. He does so well with [redacted].
Xxxxxx
Anthony: And afterwards. She came over to SI from the public sector in the early 90s, probably after Alexander Pierce kicked Peggy out of Shield.
Hunter: I will help you figure it out. You're still brilliant. You just need to come out of the alcohol fog.
Pepper pot: It would probably be best to avoid that. Robin keeps saying that they're going to end up sisters someday. Which makes sense because it happened in another timeline, sort of.
To: baby girl Friday
Tony: I think we are. OK, so blueberry syrup is now covering most of the kitchen. That means I need to get them a bath and you probably need to do whatever you’re doing that I’m afraid to know the answer to, because you’re probably going to get yourself shot at again. I don’t even know what continent you’re on right now.
Cuddle Bunny: Friday told me that it was safe to text message you again. Are you back in civilization yet?
Me: Don’t. I’m wearing it.
Me: Unrequited crushes are crushing.
Me: I’m not going to tell Phil yet. I’m not ready.
Agent 13: But he's breathing on his own. They expect him to be up in the next few hours and I'm sure he will be texting you as soon as your ex-girlfriend gives him back his cell phone.
Counselor Laura: Which means he can't wipe out half of the universe.
Anthony: Now I either get to be babysat by your ex-girlfriend who you had crazy adventurous sex with or your ex-girlfriend's great grandniece/granddaughter who you made out with that one time.
Purple arrow: That’s not good.
Tony: Don’t worry, the only naked person I want to see is you. I can’t wait to take your clothes off.
Anthony: Your glare is adorable. I would totally stop if you didn’t respond. Yet you keep doing so, even though you have to hunt and peck on that keyboard of yours. I bet you are so happy I got rid of the flip phone.
TMNS: Since you’re already bringing civilians into the lighthouse, this might be the time to tell you that Flash is with us. He kind of passed out, and Afia doesn’t want to leave him alone in his apartment.
Me: This is the problem. The accords are dependent on people not being awful being in charge but you never know who you’re going to get.
Thank you to everyone who read or left kudos for the last conversation. Also, thank you to everybody who left reviews for my Loki story. You are all so wonderful, and I adore you for your continuous encouraging words. You definitely keep me working on my marvel projects along with all the fresh Marvel content.
HSBF: Is that you covered with flour and I assume that is Afia with you? All the other kids have their faces blurred.
Chief Mechanic: You might want to read that yourself.
Red phone: You’re not replying. That means I really did do something that stupid.
HSBF: They were with the others. I’m glad there together. I think this is the first time I’ve seen May smile.
Me: Actually, she was just one of a handful of Shield therapists that did not turn out to be Hydra. Most were because therapy sessions were a good way to see who would be loyal to the cause. It turns out some Hydra flunky was the one who really did my profile which explains the recommendation.
StarkAE: Which probably nobody cares about right now due to this making its way onto Twitter. Did Spidey break into the tower to get his suit back? More importantly…. Friday, did you help him? I know he's your favorite baby.
Red phone: You actually acknowledge that. It’s a miracle.
On April 28, 2018, half of all living life was wiped out by Thanos using the infinity stones. The Avengers were not able to keep him from getting all six stones. The last stand happened in Wakanda, which makes sense considering some of Robin's early drawings. I am starting to think that maybe the baby bird can see the future of multiple dimensions and timelines, not just our own. Perhaps she was showing us what would happen if Leo didn’t intervene. I don’t know for sure.
Blue phone: Tony, are you still there?
Me: Well it is in Stefan’s name. The burdens of a super secret relationship when your boyfriend is a fugitive.
Me: I don’t deal with my feelings well or at all. I have trouble saying things, sober at least. And since I’m trying to make it to my fifth month chip, avoidance seems to be my best coping strategy.
To be continued.
I do care about Tony. I have for a long time, longer than I realized. I’m going to try hard not to hurt him again. But I will because, contrary to popular belief, I’m not perfect. I make the same, if not more mistakes, than anyone else.
Blue phone: I would point out how you were hampered by other people's agendas, but instead I'm just going to ask why Queens wasn't with you?
Therapist Laura: The meeting is running longer than Tony anticipated. I was expecting to have the kids back in time for lunch. Now I’m going to have to put the pizza back in the oven. I think it’s going okay considering Tony hasn’t called for a suit to come get him, but I’m not there.
“You married someone to keep your kids safe.” Tony completely realizes that was the real point of Steve’s marriage to May, even if they did have sex.
Me: See for anybody else that would be a completely benign question. But for you your answer is either going to be a not brainwashed Bucky or an alive and no longer suffering from dementia Peggy.
“Not only that, he’s done a lot at Shield these last few months. And I think he’s right to keep it a hidden part of the ATCU. The new name is also a good idea. Superhuman, Inhuman, and Enhanced Liaison Division actually makes sense as a name. It sounds almost like a social work division of the agency.”
Friday: They were already in love with each other before they began speaking to one another per my analysis of the messages.
Nomad: Not just in Siberia, but before. I didn’t even know you and I judged you and that was wrong.
Tony and Steve’s time in Johannesburg is coming to an end, but we have one more night together. The title for this conversation comes from the Eagle Eye Cherry song of the same name.
Red phone: Less than two months before the Accords were thrust upon us, the Australian government locked up an aboriginal man named Eden Fesi because he used his powers to help people.
Tony: Okay, nothing terrifies me more than a situation where I can end up becoming Howard. You know I never want to become Howard.
Me: But Colonel Rhodes and Coulson are. May too. She did directly help in my rescue. You did mention earlier that Coulson would do anything to keep the mother of his godchildren safe.
Nomad: I didn’t notice a lot of things like the fact most people are now terrified of the fact I can bench press a Buick. Anthony being serious with the flirting was the least of it.
Me: A good scientist doesn’t trust their own Genius. Hubris will screw you over.
Anthony: The Matrix is not on your list?
“I’m not surprised at all that you have a place in Brooklyn. Also, I know both girls in my timeline.” For some reason, Laura decides not to tell him that Robin will soon be the stepdaughter of Steve’s childhood best friend. They’re planning a September wedding if the end of the world doesn’t happen first. Well, the end of half the world, her included.
“When we fix this, that’s the first thing you’re going to do,” Tony said, squeezing his hand. “I’ll plan a big reunion in Vegas. It will be interesting to hit the table sober for once. There is also family-friendly stuff for everyone. I’ve never done any of it before, but there’s a first time for everything.”
HSBF: Have you explained to him that you feel you’re better off as friends because you both want different things? Mainly she wants you to stop risking your life and you’re never going to want to stop saving people.
Anthony: Baby, I've been negotiating contracts since nursery school. If there's a loophole, I'll find it and manipulate the hell out of it.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter.
Me: Actually we were already on a break.
Anthony: So are you in the country that has WHLN? More importantly are you somewhere where you can turn on the TV?
Pepper pot: But the other timeline doesn’t have that problem?
To be continued
Steve: You’re the closest thing she has to a mom with both her parents and siblings also gone. You need each other.
FRIDAY: He is with Sam.
“This was why I was asked to chaperone. Kissing is still allowed, but that’s it.” Tony’s assistant explained.
“You were supposed to be alone.” Evil puppy number five said just as Steve punched him in the jaw.
Me: It's the beard and the new hair color. It looks sexy and totally worth the beard rash. But he does not look like Mr. Clean Cut All American Boy Scout anymore, thank Thor.
MayMQ: Did you pick up the package?
Tony Potts: If we bring back their dead friends and children, it’ll be a little easier even if we’re going to bring 1 trillion other complications.
Tony: That’s the American football team. I’m going to watch soccer with two guys from Glasgow, so it’s real football or at least that’s what I’m told I’m supposed to call it.
The Big Boss: You do tend to be productive regardless of where you are when you’re in the mood to be productive.
“Anyway, they did find the ship that Fitz was on. Being nonorganic, Enoch survived the decimation, but Fitz’s cryogenically frozen body was reduced to dust. Simmons actually asked Enoch to help us with the time travel thing, but he cannot interfere because apparently, this doesn’t meet the threshold for ‘extinction-level event.’” Steve explained. Laura should probably ask who Enoch is, but she’s afraid to.
HSBF: I mean Happy Hogan? You know your head of security that you’ve been moping about for days.
Avenger Karen: The old consultant was Mr. Stark-Rogers himself. Your cousin also took on that name for a while. Mr. Stark-Rogers chose that nickname for you. The boy in the chair assigned Mr. Thompson the codename, venomous asshole, during his Shield apprenticeship before his mother removed him from the program. Spidey changed it to Venom because he knew you would want a cool superhero codename. Also due to the various media deals with the Avengers, the use of the codename Flash is prohibited by Warner Media.
"Coulson never made any records of that electronically. At least that’s what Natasha said." Steve explained.
Me: Do you want to do this?
Me: That horse is out of the stable and halfway to Brooklyn at this point. Snookums, Agent Agent, Agent Scary, and Agent Carter Junior all know that I am in regular contact with you. Snookums is counting this as negotiations.
“Like sleeping with the married and in the closet Chief of Staff of the late Senator Ward. That mistake almost got Tony killed.”
Tony: Other contenders for worst memory would be when Anna died, when I was told about my parents dying, when I watched Jarvis die slowly of cancer, when Yinsen died, and of course watching my parents die on close circuit. OK, I have more than a top three which is probably why I’m having trouble coming up with my happy memory. I have issues.
“Everybody is. I know it was a long road to get here but I’m not letting go of Tony. I really do care about him.”
So Obama was elected as president in 2008. I was originally thinking to just make him a senator who never became president, but I decided to go with this, so I hope I’m not contradicting myself now. However, his challenger in the MCU was Matthew Ellis, not Romney in 2012. Also, Obama had to deal with an alien invasion during his presidency. People were terrified and went with the other guy. So he became a one term president. It was going great until aliens fell out of the sky.
Me: You remember that?
Nomad: No, you’re not.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. Oddly enough, this was the second conversation I drafted for this story. However, I realized we needed to go through a bit before we get to Tony Potts and Mr. May-Rogers having a text message heart-to-heart.
Me: So they’re OK with Ultron but not you having a boyfriend?
Counselor Laura: And part of that is seeking help when you need it. I know that you saw a therapist at Shield before the implosion and I think you need to start seeing someone again. You need help.
“I have better taste than the ones that are currently in my age bracket. Thank you very much. I’m out to the people that matter.” Flash retorted.
The Mechanic: Very busy, but that’s because I’m going to have to leave in 3 days. There may have also been some long conversations about what changes need to be made to the Accords for the Secret Avengers to be willing to sign them.
Purple Princess: OK, sometimes I think this is her vengeance on the family line for killing her parents. Which is justified. Although I’m pretty sure it was Obi responsible for the bomb that ruined English night, a.k.a. killed her parents. But again, she’s entitled to vengeance because our name was on the missile. I feel guilty, so I watch old episodes of Malcolm with her in the middle of the night over secure video chat, and I let her make me get sleepy sometimes. I owe her.
HSBF: I heard about that. Please don’t do something like that again.
Agent L. Barton: Because he couldn’t handle me becoming an agent, especially after killing someone in the field. Not anything else.
“The 90s were a strange time as were the 80s, apparently.” Hunter quipped, referring to some of Robin’s 90s era artwork featuring the mysterious Carol and unknown Krees.
Chief mechanic: Agent Agent, but I think part of that decision was because Phil is on the East Coast. I left him behind in DC to get the president to get his head out of his ass. As well as try to get a meeting with Director Rambeau. It’s good for him to have a distraction. Besides, as my BFF, I always try to return your messages myself.
“Did other me not sell the tower?” Tony asked
Me: That’s not too awful.
“Which was another reason why I should have got sober earlier. Your crush should never hear about all those times you got arrested for public intoxication/public indecency in various countries.”
Me: What do you value in a friendship? For me, it’s going to be honesty.
Anthony: I don’t think that’s it considering he has an interview with Secret Service today. I think he’s just mad about me doing something without talking to him first. I’m supposed to talk to him or Laura first before making the big decisions. Apparently nominating him for the head of an agency in charge of policing us qualifies as a big decision.
"Okay, as much as I want to stay with you in this bed and mess up another set of sheets following the letter of Dr. Simmons’ rules, but not the spirit, I probably need to shower and get dressed."
Agent L. Barton: Because if we just undo the snap, it will be chaos. You can’t just bring back 4 billion people and have it be okay. Infrastructure needs to be created or rather re-created because it’s obvious that society has started contracting.
Me: The fact that I’m on the list says that all on its own. I’m pretty much on probation due to creating murder bots. I’m probably only on the list as a legacy or as a means to manipulate me into making weapons again.
Counselor Laura: Steve was a little upset about that. Especially because Sharon ended up reading those messages as part of her punishment after you managed to get her back in the good graces of the US government. So Steve will never ever give other you the real thing.
Tony Potts: Seriously, how do you know me so well or rather your Stark so well?
Agent M: Don’t call me that.
Hunter: Friday can do that for me.
Can you talk to Tony about him going public with the new boyfriend? Him being who he is, maybe it wouldn’t be a good thing. His stock prices go down if he stubs his toe. Although, again, it probably would be better than the other stories currently circulating. Maybe Ross will stop targeting Clint's wife and children if he has someone else to target. I already sent Tony a bunch of gifts under the Carter persona.
Me: Fishes and spiders? They have powers because of contact with fish and spiders.
Me: I know you were there for a brief time, but you do remember what school was like? It's only gotten worse since the 80s.
Some of the events in this chapter have been adapted from AOS episode 4.2 and 4.3 but have been modified for the new timeline. There are also allusions to the events of episode 4.22 as it occurred in the original timeline.  There are some slight references to Ant-Man and the Wasp in this chapter as well.
"That's understandable," Steve responded.
“Is this where you tried to talk me out of dating Tony, because that’s not going to work. I already just came out of one of those conversations. I’m sure you’re aware of how stubborn I can really be so you must realize I’m not going anywhere,” he tells the director firmly.
Subject: I miss the Air Force
“That’s good. We definitely need help. Maybe we got too focus on fixing things to realize that…" Steve trailed off, not sure how to articulate everything he's been thinking about for the last half an hour.
Nomad: You're not drinking anymore. Even though I know you want to turn this into that drinking game. You mentioned earlier. How many days sober?
“Because binge-eating churros was easier.” Steve joked.
But she didn't pull the trigger. She told me afterwards that if she did she would be no better than the one who ended her cousin’s life. He wouldn't want that of her.
The new consultant: It worked for Afia’s parents. They were publicly fighting in an airport before they started texting each other. Now they’re getting married in a month. I know she told you how they work through their issues. If it can work for the future Dr. and Mr. Stark-Rogers, then maybe you should try it, Eugene.
Agent M: We need her. Five-year-olds are literally waking up with superpowers due to chemically contaminated spiders. I don’t want Bahrain to happen again. With Laura’s help, I think we can avoid that situation again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Yes. I like it. Especially all the color.
HSBF: You’re not wrong.
This story is officially a year old. If you go by chapters, this is the longest story I’ve ever did. Although by word count, it’s not even close. A hundred thousand plus words is pretty normal for me. To celebrate. You get an art chapter.
"I have no idea." Steve shrugged as he went to grab the wine bottle from the table to pour the rest of it out only to realize it wasn’t there anymore. Neither was Melinda.
“Which she is probably cool with because she sent him here with a toiletry bag packed with sex toys, condoms, and lube.” Pepper snickered at that. She covered it up by taking a drink of coffee.
The Mechanic: I do. You’re my oldest friend. You also punched Tyler in the Dick after the sex tape incident which I will forever be grateful for.
Me: It’s so great to hear from you after almost a year of radio silence. And even that was a baby shower present postmarked from Arizona. I mean, you could’ve at least told me that your boyfriend wasn’t dead anymore.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. I know you probably have more questions but I hope that the Princess annotations have helped some. More answers to come as the story goes on.
Ana Junior: Actually, he’s been working with a team to prevent Thanos from wiping out half of the world’s population. As I mentioned earlier, James was unaware that his original timeline even still existed.
Tony Potts: You don't have to be sorry. You didn't know that I didn't know. This is a different timeline, so maybe you assumed that I still found out by some other means?
BITC: My dad thinks most of the stuff you send me is Avenger fanfiction.
Anthony love: Jeffrey is furious about the bruising. I think he would be even angrier if they need to deal with a second black eye. You can’t tell the red spider about Daisy now?
Anthony: See, with you that wasn’t a problem because all your muscles are real. I kind of want to lick whipped cream off of all of them.
Counselor Laura: Which is stupid because you shouldn’t make assumptions. I should've realized that you wouldn’t have known because your relationship with Steve was how other Tony found out the truth.
This was why she was surprised to see Phil. She expected him to be part of the damage control since he would be in charge of the Shield part of the ATCU once Director Rhodes was gone.
Chief Monkey Lover: That’s an Ana job.
Counselor Laura: It would just be better to bring those that were snapped out of existence back, even if it would be five years in the future.
MayMQ: Sit rep?
Me: Damn right. The darts barely worked on Liberty. They just stopped him long enough for him to start thinking like the great military strategist he is, instead of a panicky boyfriend.
“That’s right.” Which will be useful to deal with the Simmons situation and maybe even the Thor situation. Tony had Friday keeping tabs on the former Avenger. If the drunken rants during Frontier live streams are any indication, Laura's services are going to be needed. "Of course, this doesn't deal with the problem at hand.” Focus on one crisis at a time.
Director Snookums: That’s obviously Tony for yes.
Chief Mechanic: So that’s what arrangement meant.
Nomad: Tony!
Location: Avenger compound, Medical wing
Me: Laura does and she's not happy. She thinks you resort to violence too much.
Did I mention that your girlfriend’s ex-husband used psych profiles to kill his fellow inhuman because he was worried everybody was a threat.
Me: They’re trying to re-legitimize. Apparently, they earned brownie points for preventing an apocalypse while we were acting like toddlers.
Blue phone: Didn’t you also start the Jarvis Foundation for Cancer Research during this period as well?
As you can see from this conversation, Tony is aware of other people with powers in New York including the Defenders. However, because the defender series is usually released a year or two after the events take place and in relation to the rest of the MCU, it’s a little harder to incorporate specifics. From what I understand, everything so far has taken place pre-Civil War. The Punisher could take place post-Civil War, but that hasn’t been released yet. Basically, I got very lucky with the timing of Spider-Man: Homecoming.
Me: That’s nice, I think.
Counselor Laura: No, she dumped him after she walked in on him, fucking around with some young adult movie starlet. I can’t even remember which one. Her and Happy have been dancing around each other for the last year and ½.
