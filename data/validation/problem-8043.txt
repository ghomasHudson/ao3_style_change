“You don’t know that.”
He sits up for a moment, "And you know I love you too. Babe, what's wrong?"
The genius turns towards them, "What does that mean?"
"You did Sir."
Steve chuckles softly, “I just know my baby.”
"If I wanted other people to see you like this, I would make you work in a brothel. I would let you fend for yourself, I wouldn't have done everything I did for you, Anthony!"
“Hey, Anthony.”
"You fought? Yes?" Bruce adds on.
Tony shrinks in the man’s arms, “Have I got punishmen’?”
"Very well Captain, there has been a conference room booked at 10 00 hours."
"Yeah?" he doesn't look up at her, instead stays focused on fixing his sparkly red nails"
Grabbing his phone, not the latest tech, just something Ma had worked so hard to get him, Steve’s fingers fumble against the gadget in an attempt to ring the only person who’d know what to do.
Steve giggles and presses his lips to Tony’s, to Tony’s soft pink lips.
“I don’t want to go to the door.” Tony’s familiar voice reaches him from somewhere inside the house, or mansion, really. “Why won’t you tell me who it is?” Tony huffs and pulls open the door. Seeing his stunning chocolate eyes causes Steve’s stomach to flip in excitement.
Steve stands up, tall and protective as Tony cowers behind him, he wasn't normally used to this. He pokes his head out a little waiting for the strange woman to say something else.
side .
Tony pulls back with wide eyes "Really?" Steve nods hesitantly with a sad smile.
"Never, I'll never leave" Tony's arms are squeezed tightly around Steve, well, as much as Steve as he could hold. Steve devours the promises, savouring every last drop of Tony's devotion.
For a fleeting moment, he contemplates telling Tony what he was thinking, but decides to shove it down, Tony was here in his arms, in their bed, there was no reason to ruin that. "Nothing doll, I just missed you today, thought something was wrong."
Tony stops for a moment "Why?"
"I know sweetheart. Why don't we go upstairs, it must be cold for you" Steve swipes Tony off his feet eliciting a giggle of excitement from his lips.
"Why did Steve make you change earlier?"
"I like to talk to him. We're honest and open with each-"
"You're back!!" Tony's sweet voice captures his attention as he sees the slim boy run across the room to wrap his arms around him.
The man frowns, "Would you like me to say something?"
It burns, sweet yet so strong. It gives meaning to the rich lavishes, everyone wants. Surfacing feelings and thoughts that ought to stay buried forever.
“Please look at me, baby,” Steve knows that Tony doesn’t hate him, there’s something wrong and Steve needs to get to the bottom of it. Within seconds, Tony is already up and knocking off pictures and paintings from the wall. “Tony stop! Please, you’re going to hurt yourself.”
Almost immediately, Steve's fingers are hooked into the lacy panties worn by Tony, he pulls them down, gently and slowly all while maintaining eye contact. After his legs, he has no patience or care for the undergarment and rips it straight from Tony's body. "Now there's nothing stopping you, stretch yourself", he commands.
, Steve thinks, ever so optimistically. Grabbing his flowers and school bag, he jumps out from underneath the bleachers and strolls towards the student exit.
"Yes, baby?"
Wanda scoffs, "It means he's the better man, he deserves better."
"What would the evil men do if I wore this outside?"
Clearing his throat, Steve nods nervously, his eyes following every movement Tony made.
There it was, the guilt that Tony was hiding something, flickering in his eyes, Steve had spent a lengthy amount of time staring into those brown doe eyes. "I'm fine Stevie, Well I'm a little cold," He grins at Steve knowing he'd wrap those arms right around him. And, well Steve does just that. Tony falls into a deep slumber in the comfort of his boyfriend's arms.
Nervously, Tony fumbles with the box, he pulls off the lid to reveal a gorgeous black silk
Steve growls, low and powerful, he leans forward, breath lingering on Tony's ear. "They'd wreck you" his voice is rough again "You'd be ruined, take you till your innocence tasted like sin. Two? Three at a time? They'd put your little body to use baby"
Tony nods and opens his mouth to suck his thumb but before he could, Steve pulls a pacifier out and gently pushes it in.
"I know you will" he chokes out, "then you'll want to move out, make it for yourself, leave me-"
Tony shakes his head quickly, "Doc says I need to walk."
"They really do love you" he gushes at the red white and blue glittery shower. The Captain plants his hands on Tony's petite waist spinning him around to face him.
"Captain," Nat and Clint sit in their respective chairs.
“You behaved like a naughty boy—” Tony whimpers and hides into Steve’s chest, “—But that doesn’t mean you’re naughty. You’re still my good boy, hm?”
"Hi Tony, would you like to show Natasha your lab?" Steve offers, seeing his boy so nervous calmed his nerves putting away any ideas that he would up and leave after one meeting.
It had been one week since Tony had come home, Pepper's vacation had ended and she'd sentenced him to bed rest; Steve too, knowing he was the only reason Tony would stay. Now that it was safe to walk again, Tony limps his way into the common room, it was still 8:43 am, the man would and should be in a deep sleep, snoring softly but Steve had made sure he'd gotten plenty of rest coddling him and wrapping him up in thick blankets and his strong arms.
Time could not have gone slower for Steve Rogers. Not only was he not interested in anything Miss Hill had to say, there was also a nervous feeling in his stomach churning out scenarios for tonight’s event. It could go: 1) wrong, 2) horribly wrong, or worst of all, 3) dreadfully, awfully, horrifically—
Bile threatens to rise in Steve’s stomach, and his heart drops to his feet. That was Tony. In Hammer’s fancy rich hundred-thousand-dollar car.
. It was meant for
"What would be so bad about that?" Tony's eyes are young, stubborn and filled to the brim with tears that are ready to flow.
Tony struts over to Steve, the red and white pleated skirt swaying against his marked-up thighs. The top cuts down into his chest, hugging his body perfectly. Two metal dog tags hang from his neck, while his silver high heel accentuates Tony's thin feminine figure.
much. And Steve? Well, Steve loved him back. They loved each other with every fibre of their being.
Steve does.
"You know what I'd do?" Tony's hands' fumble at the loose knot, he pulls his thick member out within seconds gently working it in his hands. "I'd wreck you myself. Bend you over, drag you along my cock till you can't form a sentence. That's what you'd be really good for. Maybe I would give them a show, a pretty little thing taking my cock would be a nice little something for them before I killed them. And you baby, you'd take it", Tony pants wantonly, "Without complaint. Spread your little legs for me, when and where I want you to" he leans down so that their breaths mingle "You owe me that".
“Yes, Tones?”
Tony giggled, "We could dance there."
Enjoy ;)
to buy these fancy hundred-thousand-dollar cars. It was okay, though. Steve’s Ma did her best. Steve couldn’t thank her enough.
“Hey Buck, how was your trip?” Steve asks, in a feeble attempt at taking his mind off Tony.
"Sure baby" Steve sighs, he knew the game he was playing, checkmate he thought, "You'll be gone, away from me, after all, I did give you everything, food, shelter, a warm bed, a good education. You'll forget it all. Everything I did. You'll even forget me."
Scrunching up her eyebrows, Nat crouches down. “Steve didn’t give you a letter, though.”
Fuck. This isn't what Steve wanted. "I am happy for you baby. I'm sure Natasha is a really nice person. I guess it's time" Steve sighs heavily "If you've really got your heart settled on meeting her, you should call her over, I'm trusting you okay" Guilt eats away at Steve's conscience for reducing the boy,
"Really baby", he wipes the tears tracks with his uniform sleeve, "But you promise me you'll stay safe and the moment things seem off you'll come and tell me".
Tony walks back out into his room, he plants his hands on his hips and struts around the room for Nat, who cheers him on supportively. "Tones you look wonderful", he blushes at the compliment.
A smirk tugs at Steve's lips, a tribute to the fact, his boy is still innocent and sweet.
Steve blushes profusely, realising he must have spoken out loud, “Wait.” He pulls back nervously, although his hands stay on Tony’s back. “What about Hammer?”
“Steve. Relax.” Nat nudges him, knowing that her friend was getting inside of his own head. “Stark has liked you for ages. There’s nothing that could possibly go wrong.”
“I won’t upset him again. I promise.”
Which he just realizes the true meaning now. Buried beneath an abandoned building, listening to Steve’s chatter.
“Damn right you are! Now leave because we are done.” He didn’t know that Steve was moving during their conversation. And it’s already too late to escape because Steve was dangerously close and turning his chair to face him. He manages to flinch backwards, though, avoiding Steve’s hand when the blond man tried to tilt his face by the chin. “Don’t touch me.”
“Then get used to it already.”
Bruce was the one he spotted once he was inside, with Natasha sat beside him. He answered Bruce’s wave with a smile before glancing around to find Tony. Whom, unfortunately, nowhere to be seen.
“Then what if it’s me who cheat on you?”
“You know we won’t last forever Steve. It’s not worthy keeping me.”
“Once again, I did that because she said something about Tony, that’s all.”
Tony thought that time that Steve’s best buddy was going to commit suicide but the emo man was still present until this day so he must be took the sentences wrong.
“It torture me more if I can’t be with you.”
“You don’t.”
“Maybe?”
“Fuck off.”
If Rhodey could prevent himself from beating Steve, it was a different story when it was Clint who he met. It was after lunch, went he sat only with Bucky, Donald and Sam, who refused to say anything to him when he spotted Clint walked out of the cafeteria with a familiar brunette on his side. Without a second thought Steve abandoned his meal and ran towards them. But what he gets next remembered him with his encounter with Bucky the day before. Everyone stepped aside immediately when Steve pushed backwards almost collapsing to the ground, neither of those passerby dared to stop and/or watched what happen.
Pepper didn’t even amused. “Can I help you, Rogers?” asked her with folded arms and leveling Steve with her famous glare.
“ – reckless,” Natasha said this time. The static had completely gone making their voices sounded clear in his ears. “Next time he decided to go solo, I’ll shoot him myself.”
“Then why should I believe you?”
The pain in Tony’s leg – so it was his left leg which eating him – started to throb again as he tried to move. But laying position felt so uncomfortable especially if he was in a suit. So gritting his teeth, Tony groaned as he pulled himself to a nearby wall and pushed to sit down. Back resting on the damped brick.
“Because you let her!” Bucky stood up, but his eyes never leave Steve, “I may not at that stupid party, Steve. But I know the whole story. Tell me, are you tired already of Tony you abandoned him and let that blonde bitch to finally get on your pants?”
“You heard me.” Tony nodded. “How?”
“You,” said both of them. And it was Rhodey, who continued with, “You didn’t say it, though, you prove it. In a so coward's way.”
“Is that a date?”
“No.”
Like their kiss that noon, it didn’t last long because once again, Tony pushed him away. The only difference was that the brunette pushed him slowly and there was no slap followed after. He still inside Steve’s embraces when they parted, and Steve let it when that head pressed against his chest.
“But we are, aren’t we? You seem enjoyed me that –”
“Then turned that fucking blonde whore down instead!”
“I already did,” he murmured, but following her instead. They just barely five feet ahead when suddenly that blonde shouted.
“We don’t know what happen in the future, but I will do my best for trying.”
“Can I talk to Tony? There’s something I want to speak with him.”
just a moment before all of the indicator on his HUD blaring red with too many exclamation marks for Tony to count and JARVIS voice popped up to read him all the malfunctions on his armor.
“That sounds wrong when you said it.”
“Apologize to whom, darling?”
It was a small, barely there static which wake Tony up from his unconsciousness. His com has died due to his freefalling and the last thing he heard before the harsh landing was JARVIS’ concerned
“Did you love me when you licked her throat?”
He also missed the Hulk’s grunt as the big man warned the others to move so he could start digging. Or the slightly blinding light which peeked from the debris as it was being lifted one by one by the green man. Revealing Tony’s red armor down below and a chorus of relief sighed from everyone.
“The com chirped back to live – only receiving,” he quickly added when Steve frown. “So, yeah, I love you too Steve, sorry for not noticing.”
“Don’t thank me,” she said after they walked far enough, “I didn’t do that for you – I heard what she said about Tony.”
Cap’s voice. This time it sounds clearer than before. And the static started to fade, replacing by everyone’s voice overlapping each other’s as they were discussing Tony’s possible position. It should be hard for his already pounding head, but somehow hearing them helped Tony from feeling trapped under a thousand weight of concrete and metal.
“Did you still love me when you fucked her?”
Rhodey didn’t follow. He stopped in front of Steve with a stern face saying, “Look, Steve, we all know how’s that bitch is, especially how she feels to you. We don’t mean to blame you – and I speak from everyone’s shoes here – but we just too angry to forgive you. Clear off your mess, I won’t hesitate next time.”
“Yeah, that bitch that you very much enjoyed bullshitting all around saying that she had done something sacred by turned you normal and all thanks to her dirty cunt,” he spat, “And she said that since that day you two are together.”
in love with him.
Steve closes his eyes, hearing that sentences. Among every tantrum Tony ever threw to him when he angry, he never said that thing, and it became Steve’s worse nightmare when Tony said that to him. Though Steve knew Tony still love him, he couldn’t stop the hurt feeling in his chest. “Tony please don’t do this.” When he opened his eyes again, Tony threw his face sideways avoiding him. But that didn’t hide the fact that there was a glimpse of water in his eyes before Tony blinked it away. “You said I only torturing myself. Turn out it was you the one who did that.”
“How dare you show your face, Rogers,” hissed Clint.
But the big L word wasn’t something he dare to guessed would be spoken from Steve’s lips. Moreover followed by his name. Sure Clint always mentioned that they argued like an old married couple. Even Peter – er…, Spider Man, reference them as the Mom and Dad of the Avengers. Steve said to him that some days ago Rhodey gave him his blessing which Tony only response it with a laugh because he believe it was just a joke. And he vaguely remembered that some nights ago, when he found Bucky at the kitchen unable to sleep, and they were ended up having a rare, deep talk, the Winter Soldier said that he trusted Steve to him.
The man was already walking to the door when Tony calls his name, made him stop at the doorway to turn back to the brunette.
“Because I love you,” Tony scoffed at that, “I really do.”
“And it’s Tony Stark who answering.”
It wasn’t a surprised that Bucky got overprotected to Tony. They were a pack, or that’s what people said, forming and bonded over years of friendship. Hell, in fact, they overprotected to each other. But Tony was an exception and there was no reason behind it; everybody just got more overprotected to him. If someone asked if it’s because of his money or brain, they'll just laugh in their face. Because that was not a reason.
“Shut up Buck.” Steve took a deep breath, “What should I do now?”
“Baby –”
“So what if I torturing myself?”
“Get out.”
“Bullied?”
“Worth a try.” They parted after that, both with their own class.
“You gonna punch me?” she gasped in mocking horror, “You were quiet a gentleman before Steve, what happen to you? It must be that faggot’s fault you turned like this.”
“Tony.”
from Steve made him warm, and he lets his mouth turned upward into a stupid grin every now and then because, damn, how could he miss something like this? Was it the first time Steve became this worried each time Tony injured? Maybe no. Knowing it was Steve’s face he saw every time Tony woke up from his unconsciousness in the hospital. Looking like a mess. With disheveled hair and eye bags the super soldier would throw him a relief smile before got up to inform the nurse.
“Then break up with me and leave me alone. Go get that woman.”
“I know,” he said before leaving.
It wasn’t platonic, that ‘I love you’ Steve said earlier. It wasn’t the same as ‘I love you’ Tony said to JARVIS when the AI helps him, nor the ‘I love you’ he said to Bruce when they solved a scientific problem together. Not even the same as ‘I love you’ Steve said to Bucky when they were in the deep conversation and Steve assured him that he was okay, that he was safe with them – the Avengers, that they all could be a family. That ‘I love you’ was the one Maria said to Tony when he was a child.
She huffed before stood to rounded the table and ended up beside Steve. Her hand getting slapped when she tried to caress Steve’s forearm. “You’ll regret yourself, Steve baby. You’ve been blinded and I saved you that night. Come on, honey, I promise you’ll be happy with me and we can spend our day together during practice.”
“Chill out sunshine, better scenario, you’ll survive a zombie apocalypse with that.” Natasha shoved her hard before leaving. Only stopped for a second to glare at the other while breath out, “What? There’s nothing to see here,” and walked along with Steve.
Bucky scoffed, “And I was the one who left behind at hospital.”
“We are not in a relationship anymore. Stop calling me with that name.”
“I’ve talked to her,” no response, “There’s nothing between us Tony, me and her. You cannot believe her.”
“What? – No! Are you nuts!? I still love him, Buck! I’ve tried to contact him, but he ignored me! He ran every time he saw me! I tried to talk to him – I asked everyone but they always turned me down! What do you want me to do huh!?”
“He let me leave.”
Tony went silent for a moment, shifting groggily on his seat. He still refuses to see Steve and turned back to his mechanic instead. Which made Steve sighed in frustration.
If Thor the God of Thunder really did exist, Steve sure he had struck him with one of his thunder. Because upon hearing that voice from Tony but saying someone else’s name instead of his, Steve stunned between anger and betrayed. That was Tony’s voice when he went into submission. The voice only Steve had a right to have. Because Tony was his, not Clint’s. He saw how that brunette disappeared behind Clint as if looking for a protection, begging the dirty haired blond man to shielding him from Steve and that scene was hurt too much for Steve to watch. “Tony, baby.”
“Fine! Go back to your faggot boyfriend! You faggot don’t deserve –” she never able to finish because just in a blink of an eye Natasha was already there. Pinned that blonde to the table who shriek in horror.
Laying his eyes on the stunning sight in front of him, Steve sits up. "Fuck" he mumbles under his breath, "You're so fucking hot".
Tony blinks, "What?"
The two sit, munching away happily, sneaking in the occasional kiss, he'd even forgotten about the absence of the team.
“If you don’t, I will.”
"Ready?"
Building away, Tony moves out from the suit and washes his hands, he'd promised Steve to spend a movie night with the team in an effort to make up for the fight. Steve on the other hand had promised to— well Tony couldn't think of much, Steve was perfect. He'd done everything right and there was nothing much he could ask for, so in the end, they settled on letting Tony decide when the movie night was and prostate milking Tony while he was spread, shaking, on all fours, and a sketchbook in Steve's lap to draw the magnificent work of his fingers. Tony had collapsed, buzzing with pleasure while Steve held him, murmuring soft praises.
"No," Steve decided he needed to do this away from Tony.
The alcohol hasn't fully taken effect, in fact, this is the most it could ever do. It manages to bring up the deepest of desires. Steve's dark desires that are brought out for his lonely nights.
"You'll like it, I just need to put the final pieces together", Tony slides out of Steve's arms and runs into the bedroom to get ready leaving Steve with half a hard-on and a mind buzzing with different scenarios.
Fresh.
Tony's chemise saunters just above his thighs during his long embrace with Steve. He wants to trail his fingers along those soft thighs gently touching them teasing the brunette with a simple touch. Other times... well, other times, he wants to bite down, claim his thighs, mark them up full of his kisses, making sure there's not one inch of skin left that has not felt Steve's lips.
Now it was Tony's turn to uphold his promise, at 6:30, he was ready and showered, smelling like daisies and roses.
"Friend Stark!" Thor's voice booms across the room. Tony flinches nervously, this couldn't end well, "I have reason to believe you have caused pain to the Captain. I ask that you refrain from hurting him."
"As I can be." Tony squeezes his hand and heads towards the elevator hand in hand.
Tony shakes his head, panicky, and holds onto him as tight as he can. “Stay.”
Tony grins and twirls on the spot. "It's what I'm wearing when Nat comes over!" he beams, looking at how proud he is. The dress spins with him flaunting his thinly covered thighs during the twirl. "Do you like it?"
Steve pulls back gently, they stare at each other for a few moments, until his hands travel under the skirt feeling the soft netted material against Tony's voluptuous ass. If Steve was a poet, he'd write sonnets and sonnets about it. Giving it a soft squeeze he nibbles on Tony's earlobe, "You look stunning, sexy and exactly like the woman of my dreams".
"Tony, he treats you like a baby. Like
“Hey,” the freshman’s voice was quiet, hints of nervousness embedded in it. Justin opens the door for Tony, allowing him to climb into his fancy black car. Who said chivalry was dead? “Thank you.” His cheeks flush red watching Justin walk round to the driver’s seat.  “Where are we going?” Tony clears his throat nervously as he fastens the seatbelt.
Tony gasps again, the need to feel Steve's body on his taking over. "Well Captain America, I'm here aren't I? Your girl is in need of a real ravishing. Won't you help?"
"Of course Captain. Mr Stark is currently braiding Miss Romanov's hair" the AI chimes quickly.
"Y-yes Sir" he forces out of his mouth, a clear attempt to keep back any tears.
Tony nods shyly, he spreads his legs, one knee either side of Steve's thighs. Using Steve's hands, he plants them on his own hips. "Daddy, my panties are still on".
"There has been a general sense of uneasiness from all members, but much of the hostility has been from Miss Romanoff, Miss Maximoff, and Mr Barton."
“No X-Box?”
A smile breaks out onto Steve's face, quickly enclosing the smaller man into his large bulky arms. "I missed you boy, but what have I told you about leaving your floor"
“I know everything. I’m Natasha Romanov,” she says, grinning as she turns back to her work. “One way or another, he’s going to end up jumping into your beefy arms.”
"Have I starved you baby?"
Tony had been sitting for hours, a whole day had gone. Not a single soul had passed through that door. The door that he had kept wide open for people to walk through. Steve was busy, the remorseful message he'd gotten every hour, and hour on the dot left Tony a little less lonely. The room looks bare and plain, with no one around to keep him company, not that he was surprised. He leans back thinking about yesterday.
"Everything okay?" Bruce asks as he sips his brew, the man had never been spotted without a cup of herbal tea or coffee.
Tony envelopes in a hug tightly, "They're perfect, baby."
"Sir, Captain Rogers will return in a couple of minutes, may I suggest you return to your bedroom and rest?"
"He has gained weight hasn't he?"
The couple turn to look at each other, apprehensive and alarmed. “He does, he’s liked Steve since elementary school.”
Steve yanks him down and up again, forcing him to move faster, using him like a fleshlight. Hard as steel, he watches the miniskirt bounce and sway with his movement. Tony, of course, didn't disappoint, he cries out each time Steve drags him along his length. Each time hitting him head on his prostate.
Sharon swiftly pulls out a neat little letter from Pepper’s bag. “Tony was incredibly hurt. He’s our best friend, and I don’t want to see him hurt.”
Tony liked
good-for-nothing friends. Steve wants Tony tucked into
Bandaged up, Tony sat alone, scowling at his own feelings. Tony Stark, the genius who doesn't learn, he thinks. Stupid pathetic need to care about other people.
The younger man's face immediately lights up "Yes please!!", he's on his feet within seconds pulling Nat into the elevator. Tony has a blast showing Nat all of his cool robots and creations down in the lab.
"You see this screen," he says pointing at one in the middle, "This screen has constant surveillance on your daughter. You betray us and in minutes she'll be shot down and it will be the only thing you'll see again."
The tower starts to crumble around them, giant pieces’ start falling towards the people below. She feels a hand grab her waist throwing her back away from the edge as it starts to fall. She turns to see the spot where Happy is standing fall away from the building and plummet for the ground below. Running to the edge she tries to reach her hand for him but he’s too far away, leaning towards him she feels the building starting to give way, making her start to fall. Before she can accept it, she feels a hand grab onto mine, looking up she see the other hand, the metal hand, buried deep into the building.
Dylan comes back to the base after being away for three weeks. She's expecting a pissed off welcome but what she gets is completely unexpected.
There are still a handful of cars in the parking lot, maybe six or seven They’re for the kids whose families could
“Drop it, Buck, it’s—”
Tony leans forward licking Steve's angry glistening tip, "Daddy tell me, tell me why I can't work in the brothel, please"
Monday. It's here. Tony's big day. Steve sits at the breakfast table, newspaper in hand, attention focused on the newest dealings of Roxxon. The bright beautiful chandelier hangs above them, diamond-encrusted, Steve's choice of course.
Steve raises his brow. "Why? Don't I feed you enough here? I'm not starving you am I?"
"Penny for your thoughts?"
A smirk appears on Steve's face "I know baby" except, his appreciation wasn't towards the fireworks.
"It will. Buck said so. Now hurry before someone sees us!"
"Yeah, it's fine," Steve runs his hands through his hair, "Tony and I just fought. Nothing much."
The way he and Steve had giggled like blushing maidens as they danced away. Dum-E had joined them halfway through causing the pair of them to end up in layers of thick fire-extinguishing foam. Tony kept his arms around Steve's neck, while Steve had his large palms planted on Tony's waist, fitting exactly like two pieces of a puzzle.
“Please, calm down.”
“The letter, it was meant for you. Every single word on that letter was meant for you. It’s true, Tony. All of it is true. Bucky sold me this ridiculous plan about putting a note in your locker admitting all my feelings for you, and I must have put it into Sharon’s locker by accident. Tony, I don’t have feelings for her, she’s with Pepper, in a happy relationship. If you’d let me, I want to have a relationship with you.” Steve takes in a deep breath and looks up to see Tony’s face. Blank. A blank expression. “Tones? Darling, say something?”
"Not the correct measurement," She smirks and drinks the rest of her coffee.
Tony sighs,“‘m sorry daddy.”
Tony angrily slams the door open; he’s livid with something and bangs his fists on the table wall, knocking over the vase. Steve stands up quickly to see the commotion. “Tony?” Slamming the door back, Tony knocks over the chairs, muttering swears under his breath. If it wasn’t for the supersoldier hearing Steve may not have heard it. “Tony?” he says again, “Come here,” this time louder. His behaviour was getting to unacceptable levels.
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
. No, not like this.
. Defeated and heartbroken, Steve makes the dreary journey home, barely dragging his heavy chest along.
, he rubs the material between the pads of his fingers.
Bruce sits quietly, engrossed in a newspaper and a cup of deliciously smelling coffee. Opposite him, Natasha and Clint chatter away, Tony stays for a moment, contemplating whether to walk in or go back into his room.
"Shut up!" Steve barks in his direction, "We'll deal with all that later, right now he needs medical attention." Helping him up, Steve hears Tony's elevated heart rate, it wasn't adrenaline, this was something else, they head to the helicopter and fly straight to the Emergency Ward where Tony is quickly admitted.
Reaching behind, Tony presses two of his fingers into himself, moaning straight away until Steve grabs his hand. "Turn around, I want to see". Quickly, Tony switches positions and his fingers are back to working him open. Despite the frequent sex they had, Tony was a tight little thing. "Hurry up, I want to see my little slut bounce on my cock"
“Stupid Tony! Stupid Daddy, Stupid everyone!!!” Tony screams louder and bangs his fists against the door.
"You're not adults though, are you? You're children, the lot of you. Bullying?!" Steve spits, "I didn't think you'd all stoop so low. Tony provided everything for you, not once did he ask for a penny of the money spent back, and you have the audacity to talk shit about him? I should've noticed the chatter, the change in tone when he comes around, the snide little comments. But no. I trusted you all to be adults. You couldn't even do that. Either you start behaving like adults or you're off the team. The Avengers are not children. If you can't be trusted to behave maturely, then you don't deserve to be trusted with saving the world. Get out. All of you. I don't want to see you." The team is silent, they walk out quietly, not a single word is spoken, it's so quiet Steve can hear his own heartbeat until there's a quiet quivering voice.
Steve's eyes linger on Tony's face, he takes in all his stunning features; his honey-brown eyes outlined with black kohl, cute button nose and plump thick lips, at this moment coloured in a deep red lipstick. Never had Steve loved Tony more in his life.
Was that—
Tony pulls his chemise down, noticing it had ridden his way up his legs. The baby pink satin covered most of his thighs, Steve couldn't help but look. Legs that were smooth and soft to the touch, not a single hair in sight, not that Steve minded anyway, they were small yet firm. Long, slim and the sight of them wrapped around Steve's hips-
"Stark!" He angrily hisses, "What the hell were you thinking."
------
. Every time Stark has to go and fuck up—"
"Hey, that's totally different! I'm much better than Stark." Clint scoffs, "He's Mr Daddy issues dating Steve and I'm Mr Perfect
"I'll never make any friends" Tony mumbles into his chest. "I thought you'd be happy for me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you upset" he sobs a few more times.
Steve nods, putting his hands up, “When you’re ready darling.” He moves back to his position on the couch, picking up his book and returning to his reading. By this time, Tony had turned to stare at Steve, not glaring, just a needy look. Sighing, Steve places the book down for a second, “Do you want to sit in my lap?” Tony blinks back a few tears but stays silent. After Steve opens his book, Tony opens his mouth to speak but extends his hands for Steve. The man picks him up and places him in his lap. For Tony, holding out his hands meant there was trust in there, he wasn’t ready to speak but needed someone there for him emotionally. Steve was scolding himself for not picking up his tell faster.
"Dylan, you're okay," I say as I place her back on the ground.
Happy
hugging my
"What is it, Steve? Can we help," I say walking towards him with Laura and Pietro close behind.
"Well, how about a coffee tomorrow," she says, "that way I can tell you how a party at Avengers tower equals a full day of work."
"They both fancy your affection," he whispers back, as the two continue to argue in the kitchen.
"Momma, she didn't answer me," Laura says tears running down her face, "Every night since she left I would always use our connection to say goodnight and normally she would answer, but she didn't and I'm scared."
"If I do this, promise me one thing," Loki says.
I sign back.
"To fight as a team and keep Lily safe," Steve says, walking into the area followed by Sam, Natasha, T'Challa, Shuri, Okoye, and Bucky.
"Because" his eyes fixate back onto the newspaper before he lets his desires consume him. "Only one kind of person flaunts their body like that. You will not" The stern Captain America voice is back.
His whiskey stings the back of his throat as he empties the glass in one try. This time, he spends no moment attempting to understand why people drank this rubbish, all he wanted was to get back home to him. The only one who could make it all better. Cigars, pretty girls and the faint singing of the band that cost amounts of money normal people would scoff at, but this was Steve.
"Would you agree if I gave you said details?"
"It's true Nat, he's not good enough."
“Am I a naughty boy?” His voice was small and quivering.
"Turn around baby girl", Steve's voice is rough, delightful to Tony knowing that he has such an effect on him.
Steve grunts, leaning his head back, he was still in power here, the stunning sight below him, Tony finally taking his cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around his tip. "Baby", he chuckles, "You wouldn't last half a shift. All those half-drunk desperate folk, putting their hands on your twinky little body. Their hands up your skirt, no underwear to protect you, easy access to the perfect little pink hole. No baby, you would cry for me, beg for me to stop them, but I couldn't, could I?" Steve bucks his hips forward, hitting the back of Tony's throat, causing him to choke. He smirks at his poor skills, making Tony whine on his cock.
Steve scrunches his nose as if to hold back his disgust and laughter. “I’d feel bad that he lost out on you, but now that I have you, I don’t care for him.”
Steven Grant Rogers is one big muscly guy, but not since his pre-teen days had he felt this small and pathetic. Gathering all his things, minus the flowers — why would he need those now? — he heads for the exit that Tony and his new boyfriend had taken just minutes before. The guy he’d pined over for so long was with
The elevator doors open, swift and clean, inviting the two in the warm space Tony would have called home since Steve took him in. Or, more accurately, since Steve never let him leave.
"And the fact you sit by the swimming pool as he swims, or by the sink as he shaves. You're not blood- related Tony"
"Steve?"
“What?”
“Hi.” His voice is barely a whisper.
"In my office?"
"Sir?" Tony pulls back gently, a hint of worry in his voice, but the sweet thing he is turns his whole tone into one of worry and apprehension. "Are you angry with me?"
“Are those flowers for me?” Tony whispers, his tone much softer than before. Steve nods hopefully, giving him the bouquet.
Whiskey.
Tony blushes deeply, his smile could have been mistaken for the sun, "I love you too", he leans up to kiss Steve. Their lips touching softly, Tony was on top of the world.
“Anthony Edward Stark-Rogers, you will listen to me when I am speaking to you,” Steve bellows from across the room, causing Tony to freeze on the spot. He slowly turns and makes his way to Steve, who was looking more concerned than angry. “What’s all this about?” He asks.
He gasps "It's beautiful" he runs over to her wrapping his arms around her, "Thank you, you're so kind".
“Yes,” With a nod, Steve makes his way through the elegant garden. The flowers that grew on either side of the pathway were symmetrical. Steve quickly walks down a  large gravel footpath, which splits the scene in two. As he reaches the grand door, Steve clenches his fists and knocks gently. After a few seconds of silence, a small but lively woman opens the door. Taking one look at Steve she smiles and places her hands on her hips, “He’ll be right down, darling.” With that, she whisks off into the house, leaving a rather confused Steve at the door.
Pulling him into his lap, Steve rubs his hand up and down Tony's back, trying to ignore the effects of the racy chemise Tony was wearing. "You learnt your lesson baby. It's okay", he comforts.
"What," Steve examines, "..are you wearing?"
"When you say team, who in particular."
"Okay darling, let's get you back to bed," Steve uses his finger to lift Tony's head, gently tilting Tony's chin up,  the man examines his eyes, he looks suspicious, as if he could tell something else was boring Tony. "Everyt—"
happen. But just with H-Hammer instead.” Steve sinks to the ground. “Gosh, Nat. He wants Hammer, not me. I — I saw them. Together, in the car. In
"Daddy come on!!" Tony pulls Steve off the sofa towards the balcony.
"I'm sure you both will look beautiful, but Tony, you will not wear that"
"Barton, that's—"
Devine.
"Very much so."
he'd shouted. Tony, as he did with everything team-related, had scoffed and ignored him, which Steve had taken as no effort.
The confused billionaire looks at Steve unsure. "It's okay, you can get the bag" Tony gulps nervously, letting Steve reach out for the bag. "Thank you Natasha. Tony's just a little nervous".
"Would that include Mr Stark?"
"There has been no recorded evidence of any friendliness directed at Mr Stark."
Steve clears his throat as he checks the flowers for the fiftieth time. “Just a few minutes,” he mumbles to himself. Gosh, why was he so nervous? Maybe Tony was nervous too, maybe that’s why he’s a couple of minutes late. Yes? No? The bleachers Steve is hiding under are quiet. The odd soda can rolls around in the brisk wind, creating as much racket as it can.
"Of course sweetheart" Steve curses himself, the way Tony behaved only caused his cock to harden and his desires to grow.
"Sorry, I took so long, I couldn't shape the cannolis properly," He scratches his neck nervously.
"Thank you", he sits at the edge of his bed flaunting his legs, admiring himself in the mirror.
Steve clenches his fist and jaw angrily, "Tell everyone I want to see them in the conference room tomorrow."
“Steve?”
"Jarvis, what are they talking about?"
Tony bangs his fists against Steve’s chest, he doesn't even flinch, “I hate you, I hate you, hateyouhateyouhateyou.” Tony sobs and falls back against the wall once Steve lets go of his hands.
All this thinking caused the drop, now that Tony thought about it, he shouldn't be so upset. He may have been upset, but surely it was a misunderstanding. Right?
"Oh is that so, Mr Stark?"
"Happy birthday daddy" he whispers into his ear leaving a sweet kiss on his cheek. Steve blushes and kisses his hand in return.
"Do it, come for me", the smaller man speeds up as much as he could, eventually he screams out feeling his orgasm wash over him, the spend all over Steve's strong thighs.
"Nat you don't know what-"
"The team, Sir."
Tony examines the flowers for a few moments before placing them on the little table behind the door.
“Really?”
Tony chuckles, breathless and beautiful.
Tony pulls off with a wet pop. "Don't worry baby, you'll get a lot of practice, won't you?", he lifts Tony into his lap spreading his thighs onto Steve's rather strong large ones. Steve inhales Tony's sweet innocent scent. He wanted to take him till he smelt of Steve and nobody but Steve. "I've wanted you for so long baby"
"This week? How long has it been going on for?" He dreaded to know the answer.
Stepping back inside, Steve walks to his room, he lays back on his bed watching the door intently, excitement in his eyes and stomach, and definitely in his boxers.
"So? His opinion shouldn't matter Tony" Nat's voice is serious this time.
“You really expect me to believe all that?”
having. Unsurprisingly, it took Hammer mere minutes to see Tony approaching.
“See! It’s already working!” she exclaims, more excitedly than she should have.
Barnes nods at him affirmatively, nothing more than acknowledgement, Steve barely registering his own best friend. He knows Bucky will always have his back, even if he doesn't know what goes on in the front. It's no secret he's not against taking a few lives here and there if it was any different.
"Captain, if I may, I do believe I have information that would help you to understand Mr Stark's behaviour."
“Can I?”
Turning to face Steve, Tony flings himself right into Steve’s arms, hugging him tightly. “I really thought you didn’t like me,” Tony mumbles, sounding as if he was on the verge of tears.
She rolls her eyes at him, her tone getting angrier. "You don't understand how dangerous this is. He thinks he owns you, Tony"
"I'll think of you the entire way through," He wasn't exactly lying when he said that.
Hammering into him, Steve didn't stop once, he squeezes his eyes shut just thinking about Tony's beauty and how stunning he looked at this very moment to send him over the edge. "TONY!", he calls out, wrapping his arms around him, just that little bit tighter as his orgasm hit him.
“Stark has been crushing on you since elementary school, when you gave him those pencils, remember?” All the energy Bucky had been missing seeped back into him as he flailed his arms about, frustrated that his plan had all gone wrong.
"A few pounds I'd say," Nat chuckles.
He smiles softly and climbs into Steve's lap, "Slept wonderfully. No doubt thanks to my wonderful boyfriend."
The pair head off to their next class, with Steve desperately trying to push any thought of Tony to the back of his head while Nat concocts multiple plans to cheer her best friend up.
Gaining back some confidence, Pepper clears her throat again. “Well, after Steve sent Sharon the letter, Tony was devastated. I think he may have gone with Hammer to make it easier for himself.”
Mewling sweetly, Tony whispers into his ear "What are you waiting for daddy? Take me".
car. It’s kinda pathetic. That car’s probably worth more than anything I’ll ever make. Anyway, c-call me. I— Maybe, I just need someone to talk to.” With one final heartbreaking sigh, Steve sends the voicemail.
“I hope.”
"Natasha, you say? I don't really know, baby. The world is scary. I'd rather have you here safe and warm where I know nobody can get to you. You have so much potential. All those days I left meetings because my boy needed me. All those days I fed you myself and kept you warm. I did do that, didn't I? For you?"
"What's this meeting for?"
"I know," Steve whispered into the crook of his neck, "You have a cinema, a gallery, a paint room and a laser course."
"I'll come back, Tones," Steve whispers, leaving a soft kiss to Tony's ear.
“That better?” Another nod. “Now we’re going to clean all this up.”
“Come on, Coulson is going to put us in detention if we’re late.”
"Never!" Tony's soft look, now replaced with horror and fear "I could never leave. I won't"
"Right I'm coming sweetheart," He joins the billionaire, pulling his body close up against his own. "You know I love you." Tony blinks up at him and flashes his stunning smile.
"Everything okay?" Steve whispers, quiet so he didn't disturb the team, but loud enough for Tony to hear him.
Movie night had been awful, Tony hadn't felt that bad in a long time. Tired, the genius hides out in his lab, spending all day in there, tinkering away and putting his mind to work. Steve had come and gone while Tony's mood only got worse. It was 12:04 am, the couple should have been cuddled up in each other's arms snoring away, but Tony was in his lab and Steve in their room.
"Ready to burst" Steve rubbed his stomach fondly as he spoke. Sometimes when he touched his stomach one of the babies would kick. Maria had come out of hiding and was just as active as her brother, who still didn't have a name. He had an idea as to what he wanted to name him, but he would wait until he was born to decide if the name would fit.
"Don't forget to make a wish. It is a tradition" Vision told them from where he stood beside Wanda, and Steve wondered if he knew that genuinely or if it was something he knew from downloading it. Steve turned to finally look at Tony, who was already starring at him. This was the first time they had made direct eye contact in two years for more then three seconds. And in two years his eyes had changed dramatically. They were empty, dull, and held no Tony Stark spark. But there was a tiny bit of something in them now, hidden behind the sadness, and Steve dared to believe it was hope.
“You made a loud noise, and they got scared. They got scared of the situation, they aren’t scared of you” Tony tried to assure him, but he shook his head sadly. Tony grabbed Steve’s shoulder and forced him to look at him.
"These kids will be the luckiest kids to ever be born. They are surrounded by so many people who already love them, and that love is only going to grow after they are here" she seemed to like having her hair stroked so he continued to do it until she had calmed down a bit.
"Hey" Tony whispered, and Steve's gaze flickered upwards for a split second before dropping again. Tony wasn't looking at him, instead keeping his gaze on Maria, so Steve kept his on James.
It was a scary thought, thinking about if his babies could have gotten some parts of the serum. Before Steve was in Wakanda he was constantly being tracked down by people who all wanted the serum for themselves. The thought of anyone trying to hurt his babies because of the serum sent a thing of rage through him. Over his dead body would anything ever happen to Maria or James.
"Go and talk to him?" Sam suggested, but Steve quickly shook his head.
"Ya they are" Steve couldn't believe it. They were originally in his stomach and now here they were. He had done it.
"No, this all looks good Steve" Nat smiled reaching for a hamburger to put on her plate. Sam grabbed a hot dog and a hamburger while Bucky grabbed two hamburgers and three hotdogs. Thankfully Steve knew to create lots, or all the food would go directly into Bucky and his stomach's.
"Hello printsessa" Nat cooed, using her Russian nickname for her niece. She made eye contact with him, and he smiled weakly in appreciation. She had cut her hair again, so it fell just above her shoulders, and it was dyed blonde. He doesn't think he'll ever get used to seeing her look like this.
“I do” Steve told him, and Tony must have believed him because he smiled softly.
"I don't know what to do now. I want you to be a part of their lives, you all deserve that. But you can't take them out into public without them becoming exposed, and it would only be a matter of time before the government finds out about them, or enemies. No one outside of Wakanda knows about them"
So the babies are here! I know nothing about labour and pregnancy so if any of that seemed unrealistic, apologizes. I know it seems kind of quick, fourth chapter and the babies are already here but this story was never supposed to be focused so much on Steve's pregnancy, it's meant to be focused on life after and how Tony and Steve find each other again. And we see that Tony isn't doing so great. They will reunite soon, but they've still got a long ways to go before they find their happy ending
"Blow out the candle for them dads"
"Ya. Pretty shitty. I can't even begin to apologize enough for what happened in the Hydra base. I blacked out, just one minute we were fighting and the next I'm bringing my shield down on your reactor. Fuck, I could have killed you. And there isn't enough apologizes I could give for that" Steve bit his lip to try and distract him for the painful memories that overtook him. He really didn't remember much from the bunker. It was all blank, his anger overtaking him. He only woke up when Tony started crying.
"Rogers? You there? Is this a prank call, because if it is let me to tell you that you can go fu-"
"Ya, good thing I got plenty of sleep in the ice" Steve winced as a sharp pain took place in his lower stomach. He rubbed the spot and after a few seconds the pain went away. He had had pains all night, but they weren't strong so he ignored it. But now it seemed to be getting more intense. Was this a sign of labour? He knew it could happen at any time, but the thought that it would actually happen was surreal. He kept quiet though, not wanting to over react in case it was nothing. That didn't last long though, as the time went on and the pains became even worse.
"This is Nomad, I don't see anything" he said into his comm, still walking down his hallway.
"You speak Russian now?" of course, that would be the first question to come to his mind.
"Ya Tony?" he didn't look at him, pulling out the food from the freezer. He couldn't explain his annoyance right now, but it was there. Was he annoyed at the fact that Tony was here, so close to him and he couldn't kiss him? Or that they wouldn't be alone with their kids tonight? Maybe because Tony hadn't apologized when he honestly should? H.Y.D.R.A looking for him which could endanger everyone around him, as well as innocent civilians? Steve was going to take a lucky guess and say it was all of the above.
"Talk to Steve, and then lets go" she told him, and he nodded. So, they weren't planning on staying. Probably for the best.
"I believe he is. I think he's coming with Stark" Wanda no longer spat out Stark, but it was clear there wouldn't be a hugging reunion between the two anytime soon.
"So twins" Sam broke the silence and Steve's mood lifted when he was brought back to thoughts of his babies.
"What if this baby looks like him? What if it's a genius and talks to me about things only their father would understand? Or worse, what if it's like me?" he whispered the last part, dropping his eyes from Nat's not wanting to see the pity he knew he would see. He didn't just mean what if the baby had gotten the serum, he meant what if it possessed traits like him? The baby was already doomed.
"You doing ok?" he asks, and Steve felt annoyance building in him.
"Rogers, eat" Natasha demanded shoving the bowl back at him.
"I'm not sure, we've never performed any tests. This is the first I'm seeing of unusual strength. They have always had a bigger appetite than other children, but I had hoped it just had to do with a fast metabolism" what happens when the world finds out? What happens when his enemies find out that not only does Captain America and Iron Man have children, but they possess parts of the serum? And James is clearly going to be a genius just like his father, so he'll have the brains
"Sweet room" he commented as he got to see it for the first time.
"I just had to call you" was all Steve said, and that was the truth. He had to call Tony. He didn't realize how much he needed to. He should have called two years ago, but at least he's doing it now. He didn't realize something could hurt you so much but also make you incredibly happy, but that's what Tony's voice was doing to him.
So, I'm including the Punisher, because I love Frank Castle. Imagine how badass Frank and Bucky would be together. Should I add anyone else to this little H.Y.D.R.A take down team? I was thinking maybe Deadpool, but idk what do you guys think?
"Ten toes, ten fingers, two eyes, one nose. They're perfect" Adia said as she put a blanket over Steve.
Leading the way he led Tony down the hall and into the twins bedroom.
"Hey Tony?"
"I mean really Pep, how could he not tell me? All we've ever wanted was to start a family, and yet when we do he doesn't tell me. That's not how relationships work" he was just rambling now, saying things that didn't make sense, because he and Steve weren't in a relationship, but still. They could be. Not knowing what else to do he threw the bottle of whiskey, and watched it shatter into a thousand little pieces.
"People forget that even though we are advanced, we are human. We make mistakes, and ya when we do there can be more disastrous consequences than a regular person" and that was the truth. They were humans, and all humans made mistakes. He may be a super soldier but that doesn't make him flawless.
"I wouldn't because I would know that they were with a loving father who was treating them right" Tony gave him a small smile, that Steve mirrored. Well he attempted to copy it, but it probably looked more strained.
Going into the kitchen so he could fill a bucket to scrub the floors and get rid of the yellow paint, he saw the cell phone still on the ground. Bending down to pick it up he examined it in his hands. There was a crack in the screen, but other then that it was fine. He knew he'd never be able to just toss it, even if Tony were to tell him to rot in hell or something along those lines, so he opened the drawer to put it back in its spot, and jumped when it started to ring.
“Excuse me? You may be the Captain, but when have I ever listened to your orders?” who the hell did Steve think he was, to tell Tony he couldn’t be there when the man he loved most in the world was going to be in danger?
”You good? You look a little flushed” the question seemed innocent enough, Steve even did the puppy dog head tilt and wide eyed expression but he couldn’t stop the way his lips slightly curled upwards. Whoever said Steve was a nice man who would never dare tease someone had clearly never met him.
Fury had assigned them on another mission that he thought would lead them closer to Steve's death. It seemed to be the only missions the team had been accepting lately, and Steve had to go along with their plans, with his mouth shut. It should have been a simple in and out mission. Obviously the base they were checking out wasn't involved with his death, it wasn't even a H.Y.D.R.A base.
"Need a hand?" Wanda asked from the nursery doorway, but without waiting for an answer was already bouncing through the door. She had lost her accent, it only came out when she spoke really fast and it was still a little weird to hear her without it. Since being here, and having the kids be born Wanda had started acting more her age. She had turned eighteen recently and it was nice to see her so open. She spent a lot of the time with the twins, and Steve wasn't afraid to admit he started to act fatherly towards the girl, seeing her as another daughter.
"I. Fine" Steve wasn't speaking proper English, he couldn't get his breaths out evenly. He couldn't do this.
There had to be cameras set up in this base. Too small to be noticeable, but with enough power to record everything. However, he couldn't concern himself with looking around for them. He went into the corner of the room where there was a blanket overtop of something. It was old and ripped, something he would have seen in his or Bucky's home growing up. Anything could be under it, he had to be careful. Slowly, he lifted the blanket, careful to lift it straight up into the air.
"F.R.I.D.A.Y call Pepper. Call Pepper now" he ordered, and that was good. Pepper would know what to do, she always did. Pepper would help him.
"Happy birthday dear James and Maria. Happy birthday to you" the cake rolled to a stop in front of them, and Shuri called out, loosing all patience when all she wanted to do was eat;
"Wanda?" he called gently from outside her door. "It's Steve" of course it was, who else would it be? He rolled his eyes at himself. The door opened a crack, and Steve took that as an invitation to talk in. Wanda was sitting on her bed looking out the window, and it was the pose you would see in movies after a girl or boy had their heartbroken. It was all fictional, it was never a look that was supposed to be on Wanda. The kid had suffered enough.
"What are their names?" this is the part Steve knew would get emotional, because the names had meaning to Tony, and he hoped he could control himself enough to keep a level and steady voice, without starting to get choked up.
"No, Steve really I'm honoured. It was just a shock" Rhodey grinned looking at Maria. He groaned after a second though and Tony turned to him worried.
The party went over fairly well. James had a temper tantrum once, everyone glared at one another, and Maria got cake everywhere but with all things considered the day was pretty good. They had done presents, where everyone argued jokingly over who had gotten the best present. Between new paints, blocks, clothes, stuffed animals, a box collection of every episode of Dora (Shuri had a shit eating grin on her face as that one was unwrapped, everyone knowing how much Steve despised the show. Best present his ass) the kids would never be bored. Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy even got them some baby books. The only one who hadn't brought a present was Tony himself, which upset Steve, but he wasn't mad. He didn't want to be mad anymore. It was exhausting. T'Challa cleared his throat, which gained everyone's attention.
"James. His name is James" at Bucky's look of shock Steve kept talking. "Both Tony and I had a James always by our side. As a best friend, a ride or die, someone who always had our backs no matter how stupid we were being. Maria will have that to" as Steve spoke he let his mind wander to Tony, wondering what he was doing.
Also, chapters will be getting longer now, now that we've gotten to the main plot of the story (getting them together again)
Once that thought kicked in, he hurriedly hit answer before it stopped.
So I found a way to include Bucky in this story. Poor Steve, he's really going through some shit. I wish I could say it gets happier from here, but...
"They can't be in the same place for too long," she says, "there are side effects."
"I know you just said earlier tonight that you're finally home," he says looking down at his hands, "but I need to go find some answers about this arm, and I was won-"
"How do you know she doesn't," I scream, "How can you know if she doesn't love me like I love her?"
"I don't want to hear about your sex life with my father," I say turning deep red, "I think those are words someone should never actually have to verbalize, they should just be known."
"Sorry. Bucky, you have to understand that this is hard," I motion to the area around me, "You have no idea how much I wanted to stay in bed that morning but Tony barged in and brought me back to reality."
“He was found next to the river,” she says, “this is Sam.”
I stand turn slowly and am nearly knocked over by by a quick kick to the shin. I look up and see a brown haired boy run back into the house.
"So much for the story she wanted," Bucky says as the three of us walk out of her room.
"Well, it will be myself, Loki and Wanda, Dylan, and Clint," Steve replies, "Unless you want to be in there, your highness."
"Yes," she snips back, "after my escort was murdered around the time of the New York incident, I travelled for a bit and then came back to the city where I met Ross."
"Hey, Sparky. Where's the happy couple," Tony asks as he replenishes the bar.
Everyone but Laura looks at me like I have two heads, "I know my daughters heartbeat, I've heard it for ten years, I knew that it was hers at our first appointment," I continue, "It's complicated but we're all fine, Laura's powers are now fully evolved, our connection is finally where it's supposed to be and Hydra can't take use us like they've been trying for years."
"We know, but don't want anyone else to know," Dad replies.
"Can we go to the museum? Or the park? Or both?" she asks.
Next thing that happens is Dylan rushing out of the kitchen and heading towards her room, I turn back to Clint.
"Bucky, did you just remember something?" I ask him quietly.
"Well tell him that you aren't going to do that," Dad yells, "And make him heal Bucky so we can all get out of here."
“You saved the city, all I did was stitch a couple of people up,” she says as she walks out of the room to see her uncle standing there.
Bucky sits up wrapping his arms around my waist kissing my shoulder centering me. We hear knocking at the door and I tense up in his arms.
The team is together celebrating Tony and Steve's wedding.
"TMI," Laura and I scream at him.
"If that's what it takes, yes," he replies.
I leave the note on his pillow where I was just laying and leave his room.
"We could ask Tony," Natasha whispers in Russian, "See if he can find her, or if the connection is broken."
"Get a room," Tony says walking behind the couch.
"If we're going to be, whatever this is, we have to be honest with each other," Bucky says putting down the picture, "You can't keep hiding things from me, we're a team in raising our children and I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick not being able to hear their thoughts."
"No, I just misspoke," I say looking into his eyes, "I meant child, I meant Laura, no one else."
I nod walking out of the room heading towards the shooting range. After the light changes I walk into the room ready for a screaming match.
"Get Bucky in here and the rest of the team," I say standing, "NOW, JARVIS!"
"If you want to be a warrior," Odin says, "this extra armor is needed."
"Did he say what he remembered?" Steve asks, rubbing small circles into my shoulder.
"From that, it sounds like you only like having fun with him, you don't want an emotional connection," I say getting out of his hold and continue packing, "It's doesn't matter what I said, I just have to leave here."
"James, come in," I say motioning for him to come in.
"No, well yes, but that's Loki," Pietro retorts, "the one that brainwashed and kidnapped Clint before the battle of New York."
“Answer the call please, it’s starting to stress me out,” Steve says as she finishes up the last stitch.
"You ready for today," Dad says coming up behind me.
We chuckle at him and sit down with Mom, Cooper, Lila, Nathaniel and Laura. We look around at everyone here for the wedding and notice just how small they kept it. I feel a tap on my shoulder, look up and see Bucky standing there.
"Bu-Ja-Sergeant Barnes, you can't leave, not when Hydra is looking for," I pause, not being able to say the next word, but force myself too, "us."
"I am, where else would I go," I reply, "My daughter is an Avenger, the father of my children is an Avenger, my home is at the base."
"See! You go back to who you were before you were rewired. I've always had secrets, I've never changed who I am," I yell, "I can't go back to something I've never been."
"Thor," Bruce says, walking towards him, after he climbs out of Tony's sports car, "you're here?"
"Can I give you a lift back to the base," he asks, "get you in something you can actually fight and run in. There is an intruder on the base."
"Oh," he says, "that. Well for me it was hard but Steve helped me. It's because I had someone that supported me help me through this. Clint or Pietro can help you through this, just like Steve helped me. I still have difficulties with at times, mostly around their birthdays and the anniversary of their death, those days I lock myself away from Bucky but it's getting better."
I nudged Bucky in the arm, he shifts slightly.
"Dylan, you can't marry him," Bucky says standing up walking towards me, "I can't live my life without you, I love you."
"That's a long story," he says, "name's Korg. So, person in charge?"
"Well, I was disgused as Odin when you came back to Asgard," he whispers, waiting for Lily to realize what he means by this. He sees the realization appear in her eyes.
There's a knock at the door, I yell to let them know it's open. When the door opens we see Clint and Nathaniel walk in, I see just how red in the face Nathaniel is. I jump up off the bed and walk over to the crying baby taking him in my own arms.
"For you it is," I say putting the towel in the hamper, "I'm here to talk to you as a friend and your fiances daughter about the wedding."
“I’m sorry,” she says, moving to his side, “it’s just that my dad worked with Tony and you work with Tony so that’s really the only common ground we have and it’s just hard to talk about him at times.”
“Steve, I can’t,” she says, “you don’t know how much even having you here could cost me. You’re a wanted felon and I work for the government.”
Lily grabs one of the blades on her thigh and stabs it into her heart, falling onto the ground at Thanos' feet. After what feels like an eternity, the Soul Stone rises from the limp body on the ground in front of Thanos. He reaches out and grabs the stone, smiling as he places it into the gauntlet. Ross charges at Thanos, fueled by his rage; still smiling, Thanos lifts his hand and in one swift motion snaps his finger wiping out half the universe.
"Right, that. Well I have healing powers, as you know, but I also have the ability to make people tell the truth. It's kind of like Wanda and how she can project energy, mine just makes people tell the truth," I say looking at my hands, knowing that there's more to say.
“My father’s dead,” she spits out, “he was murdered years ago.”
"He tried to take over and enslave everyone on Earth," Happy says, "so there's that."
“Go,” Steve commands as he moves closer to the mess that is the two of them on the ground.
"Yes, and yes," Laura answers grabbing a water bottle from the fridge, "Am I going to tell you? No, I promised both of them I wouldn't."
"The same way you can even think about not helping our son survive," I say meeting in gaze, "The same way you can shoot our daughter in cold blood, the same way you can go back under without talking to me first."
"What does it say," I ask hoping to get a peak at the note.
They land at back at the base, Lily carrying the device in her hands, and walk off the Quinjet. Happy meets them just inside the doors with an exhausted look on his face.
"Momma! You're back, I missed you so much," she runs up to Dylan hugging her. Dylan picks Laura up easily hugging her as tight as possible.
"Laura," I whip around and race out lab heading towards her room.
"You mean if we get married," I reply, sneaking a glance at him and watch for his reaction.
Slowly, his hands move up to the edge of his mask pulling it up and off. Once his hands are back in his lap she makes quick work of checking out his black eye and cleaning up the bit of blood from his nose.
"It can't be," he says, putting the pieces together.
*blip* *blip*
"Dad and Pietro 'eloped' in Hawaii, these are the dresses that me Wanda and Nat had to wear," I start explain, "I'm still wearing it because Tony and Steve are setting up for their party and want the 'wedding party' in the same thing they wore for the ceremony. The only ones that know about this right now are us, Tony, Steve, Wanda, Nat, Dad and Pietro."
"Mind telling me why Bucky's shirt was on fire, Dylan," Steve says in an angry tone.
"Heimdall, Lila is the only thing that can help shed a light on everything," the guard calls out, as a car whizzes past their heads.
I stand up, pulling Pietro up so he's standing. I step up onto my tiptops and place a light kiss of his lips, then follow Tony into the kitchen.
"What's up, kiddo," he asks as I take a seat next to him.
“I just don’t think I could ever love someone as much as I love Happy,” she says, “we just decided that we were going to move in the night before he died. I’ll never be able to get to that stage in a relationship again because I’ll freak out.”
"Gideon Malick, leader of Hydra," Malick responds, "we're coming for you."
"Vision is dead," Happy yells in anger.
“That’s today,” she asks, “I completely forgot. I’m covering a shift at work and can’t go.”
“Captain America is a criminal,” he says, handing her a chart, “SHIELD is looking for him, said he set up the hit on their director, Nick something.”
Steve, Tony, Bucky and myself get in the second elevator and make our way upstairs.
"I shouldn't be here with you, I have to leave this base," Loki says not looking at me, "The marriage does not have to happen."
"Oh, okay then," he says as the doors slide open to the garage.
"I'll help you both escape. I know people that-" he starts.
"Sweetheart, do you really think this trip is a good idea," Bucky says walking back in the front door, "I mean you are due any day."
Once the doors close behind Frigga and the boys, Odin turns his attention back to Dria.
“How long was it before you told him,” he asks pulling on a fresh shirt handing her his old one.
I walk over and pick up the book that she's pointing to, hand it to Bucky and we walk over to her bed.
"I do know," she says taking a step closer to me, "I just don't know if you really want to know this."
"Hello?" I say answering it.
"Not anymore," he says.
"Thor," he replies.
“What the fuck are you doing here, in public,” she whisper-yells at him.
"You're Clint," I whip around spiting at him, "You're not my dad, biologically yes, but emotionally you are not my dad."
"I have to hide this from them," he asks looking hurt, "Why?"
"I'm just pissed that he's here," Happy says, pointing at Loki.
"Dylan, are you okay," I hear him ask as he slowly pulls me closer to his chest.
His fingers loosen and drop from her neck, he sits down and doesn’t move while she works on setting his arm. She tightly ties it to his chest and starts gathering up all the garbage.
Just then the heart monitor starts to pick up a heartbeat. It continues to grow stronger, the containment unit opens. Steve and myself help Bucky over to the table and lay him down waiting for him to wake up completely.
“Avery, you’re the only person I trust left in the city,” he says, “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t absolutely need you.”
"You want him to stay because you're seeing how much he's changed and you want to make sure that the other guy is completely gone," she says quickly, "the main reason behind that is because if the other man isn't gone, you're going to kill him."
"Okay, well after Sokovia I realized that I needed to get away from being the other guy for a while," I start, "So I landed in the water just off the cost of Hawaii, where Betty's been working since Harlem. I met up with her and we started dating again, keeping everything very low key."
I storm out the room racing back to my room. I lock the door and trash everything I had in the room, I find a picture of Laura, Bucky and me and smash it onto the ground. I collapse into the pile of glass loosing control and sobbing onto the floor. I ignore everyone that tries to come see me. I lay down on the flipped over mattress and fall asleep.
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, OH GOD AHHHHHHHHHHHHH," I scream jolting up in bed, "No Laura please."
Clint stands there and laughs, "okay, I guess that's what you'll call me."
Wanda, my twin, I couldn't be who I am today without you by my side keeping me in the right and out of jail. I want to protect you now, as you did then. I love you, sister.
, I don't realize I'm crying until Pietro wipes away the few tears running down my face.
"What happened," I ask looking around for Bucky, "Where is Bucky?"
"So I was thinking," Bucky says after letting go of me, "You, me, Laura, Clint, and Pietro all go and have a picnic today. I've already set it up outside so you have to say yes."
"So, you have how many brothers and sisters," Laura asks looking up at me.
"No, I just forgot we lost him," she says, "it's a little hectic here."
“Steve’s going to be pissed. He’s been looking for Bucky for months and you found him right after everything that happened in Washington,” Sam says.
"I don't want to hear it Steve," Bucky says not turning around, "I don't want you to lecture me anymore. I'm staying, so it doesn't matter why I wanted to leave."
It's been three weeks since we've moved into the facility, I've been able to keep my contact with Bucky to a minimum. When I do talk to him Pietro is always there to keep me centered and to stop me from running out of the room.
"No," she says, barely above a whisper.
"What is making you so happy, old man," he asks, running his fingers through my hair.
"She's at her apartment unpacking," I say looking around at the room, "I''m going to be staying there, I haven't had a code green since Sokovia and don't plan on it anytime soon."
"Don't you know who that is," Pietro hisses at me.
“Oh, okay,” he replies, “well I got to run.”
"I couldn't agree more," I say as I start to lift the cup of coffee to my lips, before I get a sip it's out of my hands, "Pietro, I'm going to kill you if you do that again."
We arrive at the park in two cars, once everyone is out of the cars we walk towards an area that has a small playground and a tree for shade. I lay out the blanket we brought and sit in the shade. Everyone else sits down around the blanket as Nathaniel crawls in the middle.
"Yes and so is Laura," I reply walking into the living room picking up the bag of toys Ras wants us to bring, "Dad and Pietro will kill me if I don't have Laura there for the birth of their kid."
"You are not allowed to leave," I hear Steve yell at someone in the kitchen.
We hear Dad turn on the autopilot and walk towards us closely followed by Natasha.
This stops Pietro in his tracks.
Heimdall looks up meeting her eyes, without saying anything Lily screams out in anger and rushes up the ramp. She walks into the ship and sees a few familiar faces, they just point in the direction they know she wants. She stops in front of a pair of closed doors and a woman dressed in the uniform of the Valkyrior.
She turns and walks out of the room letting the door close a little loudly waking up Dad and Bucky.
"Umm, oh. That, well," I pause trying to find the right words, "So, I'm all you can talk about?"
Dylan meets the team, Bucky seems to notice she tenses every time he enters a room or talks to her. He wants to know why.
I start to calm down some and am able to hear the conversation Tony and Bucky are having.
We chuckle just as he gets the final part hooked in the tree. Wanda helps him down quickly and carefully just as Pietro shows up.
Looking closely, she notices smaller energy sources similar to Vision, two to be exact.
We get to the car and there's a piece of paper under the whipper, Clint grabs it and quickly reads it. He then hands it to Pops, who starts yelling in Russian.
"Holy cow," Peter says eagerly.
"I can take care of myself," Lily yells at the two of them.
"What do you mean 'ability to make someone convulse in pain', did you not tell Steve one of her powers," Dad says looking stern at me.
"Where am I, what is that beeping noise," I asks struggling to open my eyes against the bright light.
“I did, yesterday. I’m supposed to be on my way to the airport,” she says as Tony lands beside them blasting the gang of robots surrounding them.
"No," he says, "to both things. He was a Celestial Being, and it's about Hela."
"I-I knew I wasn't attracted to Laura anymore but I never fully understood why. I just thought I did this subconsciously to protect her, Cooper, and Lila, but no. I didn't do it for them I did it because," he pauses looking up and catching my eyes, "I'm gay."
Thanks for reading so far.
"Should we leave the room," Happy asks.
Meaning behind Pietro's part of his thank you speech:
I hear the door close and look around the room, Dylan's not laying next to me. I reach up grabbing a piece of paper on her pillow and read it quickly. I get dressed, grab the bag I packed earlier that day. I hop onto Steve's motorcycle and race away from the base, hoping to leave the memory of this night and my feelings for Dylan behind. I loose control of the bike and fly over the side of a cliff.
"Sorry, I just wanted to talk to someone about our kid," He says turning to walk away, "but I get it you need your space."
"You're alive," Eric asks looking between Loki and Lily, "and you didn't think to warn us that he was on the ship?"
"James Buchanan Barnes," he replies.
"You just had a panic attack because of something I said." he says looking at me.
"Yes, I actually think he has more than myself," I reply, "Laura and Ras are both of our children, both conceived under different circumstances but both have brought us closer together."
I feel the arms around release me and see a figure go over and hug Bucky knocking him off balance. I straighten up at this sight, looking at this women who appears to be my height with my blonde hair. She turns around and I see a more feminine face of the one right behind her.
"Dylan," Clint says from behind me, "Isn't this your file?"
"You okay," Pietro asks as he places Clint on the ground.
I turn and walk down the hallway towards Bucky's room, knocking lightly, waiting for an answer. He opens the door, obviously just coming out of the shower. His hair is damp and he has a towel perched on his hips dangerously low.
"Just let her sleep, Clint," I hear Bucky say, "When we get back to base and she sees Laura we'll sit down as a team and here everything."
"I'm sorry," he says moving so he can look down at me, "for saying th-"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"If we leave right now, we'll get to Hawaii just in time for their sunset. We're going to have a small wedding on the beach," Pietro says smiling down at Dad.
"You didn't hear? I mean when I lost it at Bucky, I left the speaker on in the room," I say.
"How do Cooper, Lila, and Nathaniel feel about this baby," Bucky asks.
“Does he know the truth about,” Peter starts, trailing off before he finishes.
"I am sorry," he says in a quiet voice, "I know that it probably does not change anything but if I was Bucky back then I would have stopped. If I wasn't the Winter Soldier, I would have taken your life into account."
"How old, what's his name, you know all that info," Pietro asks.
I wake up on the hard floor of a cell. I sit up slowly rubbing my neck where I was injected with whatever they used to knock me out. I look around the room and see a small bed in the corner.
"Shit," she screams, "he's going to Knowhere next."
"No, I mean it's hard enough having children in our line of work but a marriage," I say, "it's impossible."
"You said you don't go back on your word," Loki says to me with a hurt expression on his face, "Why are you doing this?"
"Oh, how could it get worse," she whispers back, looking over her shoulder at him.
"Don't you even fucking try," Dad says from his seat.
"You won't be able to find anything, it's completely paper," I say when I realize that he is actually searching for my file, "Hydra didn't want anyone to find me so they took me offline. That's not the point, the point is that I told Sergeant Barnes to stay here. I could have kept my mouth shut and he'd be gone but I didn't."
"You can't leave," I say and sign, getting weird looks from everyone in the room, "Hydra called. They called the phone you gave me Tony, I've melted it so they can't find the base. They called me when we were at the park. They knew things about me, from my file, and they said they're coming for me."
I lean my head in and kiss him lightly. I pull away and walk towards the door.
"Move," Lily commands.
"Let's get out of here," Pietro says draping his arms around mine and Clint's shoulders.
"He's an intern for Tony," Lily replies, "I asked if he could join us today, I feel this would be a good learning experience for him. If it's not too much trouble, Rett."
"I'll make a call," Steve says getting up and walking into the woods more.
"Please," I say between sobs, "please don't do it. I'm only fifteen, please just let me go."
"Hello," Steve answers the phone, "Wait, Tony slow down," he pauses listening to the other line, "Really," he pauses again starting to cry, "We can come back, I can come home?" He hangs up the phone and faces everyone.
"Tony, I don't want to hear about their night," Steve says smacking him upside the head.
"Pissing you off results in you using the power from the Infinity Stone," Loki says through staggered breaths, "good to know for any future fights we might have."
"I'm a monster, I've done terrible things," Bucky says, "This last flashback proved it. I've done things that you, all of you have forgiven me for but this is one I ask that you don't, this is one I know that some of you will never, maybe can't, forgive me for. Ever."
He flies off leaving Avery and Steve.
"I told you I'd be back," Pietro says in his think accent, as he releases me from the death grip of a hug, "I brought some friends to help. This is my sister Wanda, Mr. Tony Stark, and Captain Steve Rogers."
Thank you again,
"Bucky finally popped the question," Tony yells, "It's about damn time, I mean how many kids do you guys need to have together before you get married?"
"Hydra knew about your power right," Steve asks, I nod, "They have samples of your blood, right? They must have made something that counter balances it."
Happy only nods in return.
"I didn't say anything," he says step in front of me as I paced, "She did all the talking. I thought she was leaving with you and Laura, that's what she said at the farm."
“Right on time,” she says pulling open the door expecting Happy in the other side.
"I'm sorry," Clint says, "I know that it probably doesn't help in any way, but I'm sorry."
"You're going to tell us everything we want to know," I hear Natasha say as we enter the room.
"Wait that infant has powers," Loki says as his eyes grow in panic.
She nods and continues on towards the throne room. She walks into the room seeing Thor running around and hearing the cry of an unhappy baby.
I hear crashing coming from the kitchen and see Dylan walking out not turning around. I cautiously walk into the kitchen and see doors ripped off of their hinges and the dishes that were in them shattered on the floor. I turn around the island a little more and notice Bucky is curled up on the floor.
“Why haven’t we talked about living together,” he asks, “I mean I think we’re ready, but is there a reason you haven’t brought it up?”
"Metal arm, deal with Sparky okay," Tony says from the pilot seat, "I don't want her crying when we get back to base, I need Steve for tonight."
"I hope you'll tell me more about that on Monday morning," he says, "it's not Gala appropriate."
“No, you see my dear,” he sneers, “I know he is very much alive, my dear friend Lorelei let me in on a little secret. And let’s just say I dislike it when someone I kill does not remain dead.”
Walking away to the closed door of the last group of people from the events today, she grabs the six charts and walk in, reading them over as she does so.
As Laura walks out of the room the doctor enters. He checks my cervix and tells me that it's time to push. I start listening to the doctor and allow them to tell me what to do. The machine hooked up to me monitoring the baby starts going crazy.
"He said I have no right to marry you and if I tried he'd kill me," he replies, still looking at his hands.
"Sorry, Momma," she replies.
"The reception is going to be better," Clint says as he intertwines his fingers with Pietro's, "Cause I decorated it."
"I mean, it's hard yes. I'm not going to sugar coat that for you, but I mean if I can make it," I say, "if I can make it at 16 not being able to run to family, you can make it being surrounded by family."
"No, I don't mind it when you call me that," he says leaning his forehead down so it's resting on mine.
She nods, I walk over and rest my hand on his shoulder.
"So I really get to meet Black Widow and Hawkeye?" Laura said as she bounced around Steve.
They sit and talk for some time until the pizza is delivered and then they continue to talk as they eat. Once the last piece is finished she starts to clean up a bit.
"We're here for our appointment," Bucky says smiling down at me.
“I got it,” she says, pushing off the counter, “my phone’s been ringing all day so I don’t really want to answer it just yet.”
"Kronan, he's a Kronan, named Korg," Eric says.
"Are you saying that if I leave with the guy I love, I loose my family," I spit out, "Maybe we weren't a family to begin with because a real family wouldn't make someone choose between their father and the father of their children."
"We're not here to discuss this," Lily says, "Rett says you're the smartest person he knows and that you'd be the best person to ask for this kind of help."
"Okay, that's fine, you have control of it correct," Steve asks, now kneeling down so he's level with me. I nod in return, "Okay that's awesome, it would be a different story if you couldn't," he chuckles trying to lighten the atmosphere.
"Happy, what is this," the smaller man asks, "another of Tony's inventions?"
"You gave Thanos the Tesseract," Thor yells, spinning around to look at Loki.
"I love the Avengers," Laura says as she still hugs me, "I came here with a superhero mom, and now I have a superhero dad and grandpa."
"I'm sorry, I'm still jumpy around people touching me," I pause looking towards Bucky, "old habit from when Laura and I were on the run."
I watch as they walk into the base and look back at the table, it's only Wanda, Bucky and myself left at the table; Pietro dragged Dad up onto the dance floor. I look at Wanda sway in her seat to the music just as Vision makes his way over. He asks her to join him for a dance and she happily accepts leaving me and Bucky alone.
Clint say from the open field in front of us.
"Pietro, what is going on," I turn to him blocking him in the kitchen before he can race out after my Dad.
"Ow, shit," I scream, nursing my bruising hand.
"Yeah, he's the man that just tried to kill us and right now we need him alive to answer some questions," I spit back.
"No, no, Pietro, no," Bucky says calming him down, "We aren't engaged."
"Momma, Tony and Steve are getting married today," she says once I sit up.
“See, she just waved goodbye,” Happy says, “if she thought that I was actually alive and standing here she would have run over here. She’s moved on and I can’t wreck that.”
"Where have you been Bruce," Tony pries sitting next to me on the couch, "I want to know everything."
“What happened,” someone asks, she’s unsure of who it is.
"She's the best at what she does," he says as he steps back from the machine, "I wouldn't bring you here if I didn't believe it."
Just a heads up that this has Captain America: Civil War spoilers in it, pretty much a complete summary of what happened. So don't read it until you see the movie, or you know don't mind spoilers.
"I don't know how you did the whole single parent thing," he says as Nathaniel happily eats the cracker in his hand, "I have three kids and feel over whelmed with raising one on my own in this career."
"It's going to track Dylan's inhuman abilities and help us find her," Bucky tell Pietro in Russian.
“Thanks,” he says, “my name’s Peter.”
"Well he did save an entire race of people," she says, "twice. So, I don't understand why you're so mad at him."
"Okay, let the girl breathe some, Roadrunner," Clint says before taking me into a small and softer hug, "Where's Laura?"
"How about grandpa-hawk," I say with a small chuckle, still rocking the baby.
