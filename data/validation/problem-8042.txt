Beep. Beep. Beep.
He could feel it, destroying the core was incredibly important.
Steve submitted.
As she un-curled herself off of the floor she choked back a sob.
He helped Becka into the other child coat. He looked around the boxes before finding the boots that accompany the coats.
Steve swallowed thickly.
This was how Peggy found them later. Eleanor gesculating wildly as she got into the climax of her adventure and Steve listening engrossed as he tried not to burn their breakfast. Both somehow had gotten flour all over them.
“But you didn’t…” Bucky replied sharply.
“Of course they are.”  Tony retorted with an eye roll.
Why was he meant to endure so much pain? He just got his heart ripped up all over again not two days ago. Wasn’t just one enough? Why did it have to happen so many more times?
“I did Cap! I really did! I did it based on yours and Thor’s intake with a thirty percent error margin.” He said shaking his head.
“Seeing as the main threat had been neutralized, I came back for the time being.”
'Shit!'
Steve truly believes Tony can save the world.
The waitress had bright red hair pinned up in thick pin curls, even redder lips, and was wearing a black polkadot dress with an apron. Her name tag read Beth.
That gave Tony pause. His response of 'because it's the right thing to do' was completely caught in his throat. It was something that kept gnawing at him constantly after learning exactly what was going on inside the minds of the people she cast her spell upon.
Tony felt chills run up and down his spine, his very blood felt tingly as if it were simultaneously on fire and frozen solid. His skin broke out in goosebumps and the hair on his arms and neck stood on end. After each sequence Barnes completed, a strange wave of energy pulsated through Tony’s body.
He sighed heavily knowing that this was it. The moment he rejected her deal it was truly going to be the end for Steve, Captain America, one way or another.
Yes, really.
'It's just as well.' Tony thought.
“All right, let’s gather as much information as we can about this thing.” Steve smiled mournfully to himself.
“You have no idea what I felt when she grabbed my wrist.” He continued, his fingers lightly touching the black markings on his left wrist.
"Oh, hell no!" The man exclaimed. "There is no fucking way I'm doing this, I'm out!"
Wow, ouch, that hurt a lot more than he thought it would. He shook it off quickly. He knew security would be coming to catch him shortly. He had to keep moving.
“That would be eighteen for me and twelve for you, Dumbass!” The soldier declared jovially.
Tony could swear the soldier’s subsequence screams in agony at the sudden vile resurgence of pain matched the screams that erupted from his very own soul. He barely registered as Natasha grabbed his face trying to get his attention. Xavier, Wilson, Barton and Fury closed in around Barnes in an attempt to subdue him.
"Yesterday?" The man asked.
“I doubt it.” He replied coldly before breaking through the glass and diving out of the window.
Steve nodded.
Just as he issued the command the flight stabilizers ceased and Iron Man went down. The impact with the Earth was jarring without the help of the stabilizers.
He turned his attention rapidly back to the piece he was working on.
Charles smiled at them; he saw them as the troublesome kids they were at heart. Fury stared at them incredulously; he was just as lost as the others that had just started to file in.
He took in his surroundings with a critical eye. An empty hospital. It was disturbingly eerie. Then he looked at the girl again.
Blow after blow sent Steve reeling.  There was something else about this character that unsettled him.  He could not put a finger on it.
“I am seven years old.” She thought for a moment before asking, “Daddy, are you sick again?”
Harker may be dead now but Graham Rhododendron was still running the show. There's no way to know if Graham was pulling the strings all along and Harker was the true puppet or if the Rhododendron, now master less, and thus aimless, was in possession of some truly devastating power and now out of control.
“Stay here.” Steve ordered.
“You ready? There are three more corridor doors and two more elevators before we reach the exit point.” Tony supplied.
“Sir, access is granted. Entry through portal B – 03 is advised. Safe swim.” Jarvis informed.
It was not an easy pill to swallow, jagged as it was. A grand swirl of complex and wretched emotions permeated the air.
“Johnny, we are about a mile from the perimeter, can you get to us?”
Bucky kept shaking his head.
The blanket was turned to ash instantaneously and Iron Man was closing in on him rapidly. Steve lunged to the left and targeted a flight stabilizer on the armors right dorsal area. He’d have to slow Tony down piece by piece if he had to. Unfortunately, Tony was expecting it or Jarvis saw through his movements. Iron Man grabbed his shield and yanked it away tossing it aside.
However, he did not know what that could mean for his family, for Peggy. He could not decide what to do. To admit something like that out loud…
“Jarvis?” He whispered after peaking around the corner.
“Come on, I’m trying here. I just want to keep you alive. Just talk to me.”
In the end, it is what it is and what should never be, will never be.
“It’s an honor to meet you, Sir.” He said.
At last the texts were in their possession. And so it was Captain America and Thor were on their way back to Earth.
Bucky put his one hand up placatingly, seemingly looking contrite. But Tony was able to discern a few lingering tendrils of mirth beyond his gaze.
A nightmare indeed! He was about to- about to-…-With a man. And not just any man, this strange mystery man that had haunted his dreams since day one.
Entertaining was one way to describe the chaos that descended upon the Raft when Tony Stark decided that it would be a good idea to break James Buchanan Barnes, prisoner 86, out of prison.
“Why keep it from me?”
“You are acting like a pathetic child. It’s such a shame that the fate of the universe is in the hands of a sniveling whiny brat.”
Never.
“Tony!” Steve shouted in the best authoritative voice he could muster then.
Sam smirked.
It wasn't so much that he couldn't think of anything at all, it's just that he had wanted to know so much that he really didn't know where or even how to begin. This creature standing on the palm of his hand had the power to do extraordinary things. So extraordinary that her abilities affected entire worlds and even the entirety of the universe itself.
Steve nodded waiting patiently.
“Come on man, do you really think it’s a good idea to talk to her??” Scott whispered apprehensively.
“Probably as good as I look.” Steve replied earning him a smile.
"Ind- indeter- minable."
‘Yes!’ Tony thought exuberantly. ‘This is what I’ve been looking for!’ He waited for the soldier to continue.
“Ow!  Hey man I’m driving here.”  Tony shouted still laughing.
"Yes?" He called out.
“But it is! I should have realize sooner. I don’t know what I would do in your place.”
“Steve listen.” Tony spoke a bit louder and enunciated his syllables.
No wonder his team went down so easily. As it was, Jarvis couldn’t even hack it. Where in the hell did they get this piece of tech? Visually speaking it looked like a souped up radar gun. But Tony knew it was much more sinister. If it can take down Falcon, War Machine and the Quin Jet so easily, he knew they were in trouble.
What? Where did that come from?
“We were just discussing what to do with the drive Calamity gave us.” Clint replied, Jane nodded.
Steve merely rose an eyebrow, unconvinced.
“The key is to wake everyone up simultaneously. After I gauge what’s going on in their minds, I’ll sync everybody together on a timer and release them all at once. And before you ask what would happen if she stops me or retaliates, the answer is: it doesn’t fucking matter because we were all fucked from the start trying to fight against an alien that is basically a celestial God.” The genius replied snappily.
“Well, I’m ready regardless. Go sit at your usual spot and we’ll get you started.”
“Sir, six agents will be approaching you from behind in two minutes.”
In a blink of an eye she was nose to nose with him. He felt the heavy, intense force of her presence instantaneously. He swallowed thickly, every fiber of his being was screaming at him to run away, fast and far, far away from this dangerous creature before him. He stood his ground however, somehow.
The Super Soldiers expression changed so fast that it would have been extremely comical except the look that ended up on his face screamed ‘If you don’t walk away from me now I
Tony shook his head. He detested feeling this vulnerable.
“That is so sweet! Look at you all hopelessly trying to protect your Captain.” She laughed merrily. “What do you think of my surprise Steven? I chose you as my Keystone! Isn’t that wonderful!?” She exclaimed brightly as she began to float gracefully to them.
"Hope to see you again, my boy." After handing Steve the stone in a small paper bag, Frank held out his hand again.
“Hey there? How does that feel?” He asked timidly, taking care not to startle him.
“Come on, Tony. How is it that if Steve felt like this, did it all go to hell? What did you do?” Clint supplied.
“And before you can protest, wasn’t one of your first thoughts maybe if you killed yourself she could not have you?! Admit it!”
Still the Professor remained calm, all the while searching Steve’s features as if trying…  As if trying to figure out what his thoughts were…
"Walk, Ellie!" He shouted but she likely didn't hear him.
Steve bolted, jumping roof to roof trying to stay moving. Tony and Thor flew to the air searching for the Winter Soldier. The Captain saw a glimpse of that arm a few buildings away. He also noted Calamity sitting on a water tower on a high building watching them.
Wanda hugged herself and looked away. Tony pressed his lips together into a thin line. The soldier did not need to finish what he was going to say. The genius knew exactly what Barnes was thinking. Ironically, Tony was once sure of the same.
“No computer on earth has the capacity or power to process that much information in its entirety. Except maybe Jarvis. If those were my only obstacles then yes, I would be done by now. However, like Jarvis, whatever is on that Crystal is also an independent entity. I can’t figure it all out without the key.” Tony finished dismally through clenched teeth.
Suddenly, the man turned all the way around. The Captain felt almost as if he had been hit with a jolt of lightning. Steve let out a gasp as he gazed at the man fully and the man stared back. It was like they were frozen in time, everybody else seemed to fade away and he and this man were the only two people in existence. Before Steve could even comprehend any measure of the multitude of torrential emotions that he was feeling, a bus pulled up in front of him, cutting off his view of the man and breaking him out of his trance.
“Great! Since you are so vulnerable and essentially at my mercy, how about I even the score a bit.” He said as he began removing his over shirt. Now he was standing before the soldier in his under tank with his arc reactor clearly in view. “You know this.” He pointed to his arc reactor. “It is one of my biggest vulnerabilities, for many reasons, as you found out yesterday…” Yeah yesterday, moving on. “It’s exposed to you as you are to me.”
His feet, however, had somehow led him to the last place in the world he would ever think to look for it. He found himself planted outside Barnes’s assigned quarters.
“My dear, I can only imagine what this information does to you. To learn that one of your father’s first valiant conquests of his youth was misguided and based purely on conjecture.” Thor shifted uncomfortably.
Xavier was feeling much better after trying to control the inevitable temper tantrum of the Hulk.  He had vastly underestimated how much the big guy wanted out.  Of course it didn’t help how exhausted he was to begin with.  Clint eventually woke up in time and was currently nursing a glorious black eye and busted lip. He was feeling quite admonished after his fit.  Later, still jaded from his temper tantrum Bruce woke up and decided despite being on standby he would help and aid Hank and Tony with whatever they could come up with.
A/N: Sorry for the late update! Seriously it’s still better than waiting a year so no complaining! Lol. I pretty much had to work a week straight after the fourth and then Pokemon Go happened… I am not sorry. So here it is, enjoy!
“JARVIS! Music!” Steve shouted over the incredibly loud guitar chords of Tony’s Music.
Speaking of, Calamity has now claimed 894 people.  The media was going nuts.  The CDC just keeps shaking their heads.  Steve just sighed.  It’s not a disease people.  It’s something far worse.
“What if we pulled more people in? It would be cruel but I’d want to know and I’d want the chance to fight.” He replied firmly.
“What happened, Barnes? Why did he leave?” Tony demanded again. “Please.”
‘Shit!’ They may be close to the surface but are still a very considerable distance away from the tower!
“See? You are totally in control. Now, after what happened yesterday and skimming through the journal-“
Tony groaned.
After she placed him back in his seat and removed her hand they noticed that his wrist was black and purple.
End Chapter Twenty-Four
“What the hell are you doing you useless piece of shit. You’re supposed to stop him!” The nasty fat man screamed out.
Tony went strangely silent for a while as he watched Steve prepare his bed. Steve grew concerned over Tony’s silence and wondered if he had passed out. He looked down to find the genius staring at him. He found the intensity unnerving. He gulped thickly.
“Excuse my language, please, but it was necessary. Don’t you see what is happening? This is starting to be just like what happened with Loki.” He paused as he gave them all reprimanding looks.
“You’re such a sick man Stark, a real sick bastard” He told himself.
"It hurts." He muttered in pain. "Please, Anük, please save them." He pleaded. "If they all die now there won't be anybody to retest in a few thousand years."
“Stop wearin’ holes in my floors. Take a day or something… You’re also on standby.”
“Well, Babydoll, we are here.” He said opening the door for her.
Steve swallowed again. He knew from the burning sensation deep in his throat any attempt to utter a sound would be perdition.
This was his absolute last resort. He could blow the suit up from the inside. The only thing that gave him pause at this point was if he went through with this there would be no one to stop Calamity. But then again there would be nobody left to save
"For the case of tin, right?" The boy answered quickly. "I'll get it right away."
“Random! If it’s a new one I want to figure out the moral.” She said excitedly.
"I knew you were behind that…"
“Please.” The soldier whispered pleadingly.
Two youthful figures approached from the shadows.  A woman and a man.
Steve swallowed thickly, he had to remain calm.  He began to edge closer to the man.  The guy began to laugh sinisterly.
“Oh my dear, you amuse me so.”  She laughed.  “Which is why I feel the profound need to apologize to you.”  She declared earnestly.
'It's so odd,' He mused. 'How obsessed I am with this man.'
But Calamity took him.
The genius glared up at him, not happy at having the Soldiers ass so close to his personal space.
Steve nodded.
The entire room lit up as the holographic rendering of the data exploded into view. It twisted and curved into the gnarled visage of a vast ancient tree, energy branching out and connecting and colliding with others. It was magnificent. Jarvis was but a tiny little orb amongst the codes enormity.
He sighed heavily.
“Yeah, from what Thor told me it’s pretty straightforward. I shouldn’t be doing anything overly strenuous.” He smiled despite himself.
“Say it. Say why you can’t ask him yourself. I’d really like to know.” He provoked, his tone deadly sharp.
The fact that Bucky could survive after everything to this point despite, well, everything he could go a few hours without those IVs.
"Shit, one of those nasty birds broke out of the containment field!" Hawkeye warned over the coms.
"Power to do so, yes." She sighed. "However, even I am bound by the laws the great mother has bestowed upon this universe."
What?
The scene changed and Tony’s lab came into view. A few seconds in the genius strode in distraught, grabbed the nearest liftable object and threw it across the room. It appeared to be a toolkit.
Bucky despite himself fought his captors to reach for Steve in return. His right arm broken and useless lifted minutely, painfully reaching out. The agents tried to force him back but he was unmoving only continuing to reach. Steve could feel Iron Man grab the back of his neck in an attempt to subdue him. The raging torrent of utter desolate pain was unbelievable but he pressed on. His mind losing focus on everything but his brother.
But was it even possible?
This was just torture.  However thinking back, they had always seemed to tease him this way.  Always insinuating that he and Tony had done something together.  He merely rolled his eyes in response and remained silent.  Natasha and Clint were a little put out that the Captain was not giving in to their taunts.
As they shot through the sky back to the helicarrier, Steve marveled at how wonderful the cool fresh air felt against his skin and in his lungs.  Sooner than either of them wanted, they made it back to the helicarrier.  Tony had Jarvis open the bay doors and they flew right in.
“Wouldn’t wanna be any where else.” She added.
Before he sealed the box he had one more item to place. Under his shirt he pulled out a worn red leather bound journal. He traced the black star on the cover with disdain. This was essentially his instruction manual. He loathed its existence. He had originally planned on destroying it, however, there were far more secrets in that book than just how to operate a winter soldier.
“You done?” The soldier inquired. He was amazed by the genius’s dramatic antics.
Hank paused for a moment confused at the new voice but continued, “Well, to put it simply, the patients are happy.  Really, really happy.  I have no idea what is going on in their noggins but whatever is happening they are extremely happy about it.”
"One hundred and twenty-eight." She answered automatically not recognizing the severity of Steve's tone. "Please, Daddy. I must have her! Please?"
“I believe so. Anything is better than nothing right now. It’s just as Captain Rogers said. If we are doomed to die we can at least gather everything we can about this calamity so that someday someone could stop it from happening again.” Fury stated.
“Carnations.  Roses are overdone.”  Fury replied not missing a beat.
"First they fall a few at a time then the rate increases exponentially. Hundreds upon thousands will soon fall all at once. Soon the ones untouched by this calamitous enchantment will drive themselves mad with fear and sorrow and the unknown until they completely and utterly destroy themselves.” Thor spoke with nearly a tremor in his voice at the end.
Natasha continued taking the lead.
"Pägrwa Erta Lanr Anük."
"Steve! Steve!" She shouted as he caught her hands. Panic began to set in. "It's Peggy!"
Tony’s expression perked up. “Yeah?” His tone almost hopeful.
“Well.” He said. “If you will all excuse me, I’m going to go change my pants.”
“Because in a weird very stupid way I am.” Tony replied deadpan.
Steve took a deep calming breath. It had been three months since the closure of their last biggest mission, the Calamity case. He and Tony barely had any time to spend together while cleaning up the aftermath of the battle with Calamity.
Tony was hoping Barnes could lead his team in the ways he could not. All his attention needed to be focused on solving the Calamity case and saving the world. The soldier certainly had the skills, he just needed the drive, the will. Hell, he even had the loyalty, more or less, already. Natasha trusted him and Clint trusted Natasha. Tony hoped Rhodey would trust his judgment (a longshot, but hey, as long as we are doing the wishful thinking thing.) Wilson was up in the air. Lang and Parker where pretty much along for the ride. And Storm and Grimm could respect a strong leader. He had his suspicions that the Professor already approves, therefor the rest of the X-Men did and Tony figures the twins already trust him. Barnes just needs to trust himself.
Sure enough, he had succeeded. Steve stared down at his drawing of the man with shock, awe and… Reverence?
Having read his medical history the Captain seemed to get out of most skirmishes with nothing but a few inconsequential flesh wounds. Never since coming out of the ice was he ever treated for broken bones, this was serious.
*~0~*
“You are lucky he’s awake or I would have you forcibly removed again.” She stated with no room for argument.
The makeshift distorter he fashioned wasn't able to hold up to the incredible demands forced upon it. He knew it was a possibility that it just wasn't going to hold up. He didn't think he was capable of closing the hole entirely at this point.
At first Steve could not decide (and from the looks on other people’s faces he’s not the only one) whether or not Clint was trying to prank them. However, having worked with him the last several years he found that Hawkeye was being completely serious right now. It’s just the things he was saying were… Silly?... Ridiculous? Steve was far too exhausted for this.
He started thinking about those times almost 100 years ago.  So much was so cut and dry, so black and white back then.  Or at least it seemed that way.
Steve’s smile was strained but managed to reply.
Tony had already ran out to the common rooms activating his suit.  Steve was hot on his heels.
It was so familiar yet so far away. That voice, that glow was all too familiar to him. What even was that? Whatever that glow was, was immensely important.
Steve pulled away and let Peggy bend down and scooped up Ellie and her arms. She began to kiss Eleanor all over her face making the child giggle and squealed in delight. Steve was so lost in the moment watching them that he nearly forgot what he was doing.
“Tell me!” Tony demanded again, waving the wand over a sensitive spot by his shoulder blade, forcing the soldier to bark out a laugh as he lunged for the wand again.
He clenched his hands over his arc reactor and began to sob wretchedly.
“Excellent!  Give it here.”  The fat silhouette demanded.
Steve paused for a moment wondering just what this young woman is or can be capable of. Professor Xavier is the leading telepath in the world, but even he couldn’t get passed Calamity’s mind barrier.
"That wasn't all." She assessed. "There was one thing you came to realize that finally shattered my illusion."
Please leave a review and tell me how much you like it so far.
Tony was lost in Steve’s warm expression for a bit. Realizing almost too late that he was asked a direct question.
“Just be careful Steve.” He finished awkwardly.
Steve really, really did not know how to respond, at all. Tony pulled away slightly.
“N-no it’s not- I don’t…” He groaned into his hands in mortification.
“AAWWWW!”
“It’s Yggdrasil.” He murmured.
Steve sighed as he walked into the studio and took in his, Peggy's and Ellie's recent works. Rocky's girlfriend is indeed the most magnificent and radiant pony in all the lands. Steve smiled. Next to Ellie's work was Peggy's watercolor paintings, she had just finished a royal purple bearded iris. Her technique was exquisite.
Xavier smiled. This was the man of whose mind he was listening to.
As if on cue the mother emitted another deafening wail that sounded more like a triumphant roar.
“So, tell me what’s going on with you two. Why are you on the run and who’s after you?”
They never even got a chance. If he hadn't been so stupid and overly cautious, if he hadn't kept Tony at arms length, they could have thrived! They could have really been something explosive!
“Look, I did not know about Barnes.” Fury responded almost exasperated.
“You asked where I wanted to eat, and I want to eat good old fashioned American Food.  Just find a place nearest here that makes the best bacon cheeseburger and we will go.”  Steve stated resolutely.
The relief mixed with the foreboding was utterly nauseating. Good thing he just vomited up all the contents of his stomach not two minutes ago. His arm throbbed mercilessly but he managed to ignore it for now. He forced his mind to focus. They may have a lot of extra people now but that won’t help them in the least if those damned robots can adapt to every single thing thrown at them.
Steve stopped himself from applying with something scathing.  Instead he looked Tony over while trying to calmly absorb what the genius was telling him.  He had to remind himself that Tony was trying to keep him safe, that he should trust him.  Even if his teammates could not trust him in return.
He stopped. The closer he got the more he was able to make out the fine details of his long-lost best friend. Like the way he was hunched over staring at his clasped hands in his lap. Steve could see the strain on his face but was happy to note that he was stable and in one piece.
“A mission. Something has come up and we need everyone on this.”
“Hey! He stopped bullying us!” Steve defended.
He couldn't.
Tony lost his grip on the pavement and was violently sucked into the sky. His heart beat madly with fear as the wind rushed past his face and tangled through his hair.
Her little fists bunched up over her nightgown were her heart would be.
Steve smiled impossibly wide.
“Hmm, I figured you may have a condition like this.  As far as I can tell it’s temporary.”  Hank said pensive, more to himself.
Some of the others slowly looked at Tony paying attention fully.
The coms crackled, the bomb shelter basement making the signal go in and out. From what he could make out there was a new wave of the fur balls coming in and Ben was trying to barrel his way into the source. A new wave means that no place was safe, he needed to get these kids outside the perimeter to safety.
"Oh no! She's materializing!"
'No! I can't think straight.'
“Jarvis, does Tony still not want to be disturbed?”
All comments and theories welcome!
Steve shrugged, “Like the restraints work anyway.”
After one more go at Steve's plan, the Avengers found that the alien robot thingy made really good fireworks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know I lost a hundred bucks today?”
"It all ties into what exactly had happened here on this little planet all those eons ago…"
Bucky looked at Steve’s intended location. “That’s just a bunch of factories and warehouses over there.” He remarked.
He thought he was going to vomit from the pain but pressed on.
“Obviously I am little nervous.” Steve smiled abashedly.
“Are you sure? That looks pretty nasty.” Asked Bruce.
If you must know, there was a need for an MRI for the soldier, Barnes snapped.
Once he had completed the devices and checked and rechecked each one of them he and his team were going to place them on the foreheads of each person afflicted. He didn't like that he was going to have to literally rip all those people out of a generated heaven but he had to in order to save everyone. He figured he'd at least figure out a way to pay for everybody's therapy.
Steve nodded.
When she was out of sight and all Steve saw was the tile floor and all he heard were heart monitors, he got a gravely sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He knew without a shadow of a doubt that he loved Peggy and his family but there was a strange sick nagging feeling that what he felt for her paled in comparison to… Something else.
Without any warning he grabbed Natasha and threw her against the wall opposite of the window. He pinned her with his shield.
“I can it’s just difficult. It feels like you have a fence or wall blocking me.”
“Oh? What about that time you hid that frog in Freddy’s jacket?”
Then he had gotten that taste, that single drop of unadulterated heaven. That twisted vision of what he and Tony could have created together, impossible or not. The memory of that beautiful little girl's face will surely haunt him for all time.
End Chapter Twenty-Two
A little unnerved, Tony spoke to him. “Okay, if that answered your question, are you ready for step two?”
For months, this was what he had been aching for! Suddenly, Steve slid his hand through Tony’s dark hair and clutched the back of his head to deepen the kiss. He moaned desperately into the Captain’s mouth.
'Come on Steve, think!' He urged himself, barely registering that his wrist almost began to burn.
“Well, with that I believe I will sleep well.”  He smiled as he had tired written all over his face.
He stared at her shocked. He had no idea what she was talking about. He shook his head. He tried to think back. He couldn’t think of where Steve had come to that conclusion unless Calamity had tricked him somehow.
“Get off!” Steve smacked his hands away.
Pacing in his quarters that day felt like such a long time ago.  When really it was only yesterday.  He had thought of finding a common room of sorts but quickly dismissed it not wanting to interact with other agents.
“Where did you go last night?”
The Captain’s concern bled through his usual stoic leader face. Tony noticed the look and transitioned into serious mode.
“Listen, it’s just sleeping. You can handle that, I’m sure.” She smiled into his chest. “Trust me, there will be no hanky-panky for a while yet, darling.” She gestured to her belly. Peggy smiled deeply at the way he visibly reddened everywhere.
Tony was openly glaring at her from behind Steve shoulder.
This case is making every one edgy. The lack of information is driving everyone mad. They need this. Something solid, something they can be sure of. Not knowing anything is a horrifying feeling.
Did this devise hurt that special person?  He would destroy the core to protect someone.  Someone with an artificial heart…  Heart…  He holds his heart.
Of all of the things his arc reactor was capable of it could not stop his heart from falling to pieces. He doubted he could ever create something that could. He hadn’t felt this utterly helpless since his parents died. There was no puzzle to solve, no mission to accomplish, no villain to fight, no plan to escape and no foe to outsmart. It was just him, his fragmented team, his broken life and his shattered heart.
Her brother nodded in agreement. Bucky almost made to decline Steve’s offer before the Captain shot him a look that screamed, ‘If you do not eat now I will personally shove it down your throat.’
God damn she was beautiful! He pull her in close and kissed her deeply.
All of Tony’s thoughts came to a screeching halt.
Becka’s hands found their way to his hair. Her near death experience forgotten in favor of Steve’s golden tresses. Steve smiled kindly at her.
“Yeah, and how about that one? Giving a complete stranger complete access to your mind?!”
“I dreamt that you got me a flying pony!” She squealed happily.
“Steve!” He turned swiftly to the familiar voice. He got a glimpse of Peggy’s smiling face before he got an arm full energetic child.
Steve was beside himself with horror and humiliation.
-(0)-
Steve breathed in deeply.
Tony does not need to be the one trying to do everything.  He is just one man after all and they are a team.
Even though he knows all the reasons why he should take a break and get some proper rest, he just simply can’t get past the guilt of it. He can’t just take it easy knowing that the entire world is on the line, even more so now that it feels like they are running out of time. Now that they know that the keystone plays an important role, when once it happens, there’s no going back.
“Barton, what’s the sitch?” Iron Man voiced over the com line.
“My dear Steven, you know this answer also.” She said softly.
JARVIS muted the music as Steve entered in to the shop further to find Tony hunched over one of his work tables tinkering with some piece of tech. The loss of music threw Tony into an obvious annoyance.
Okay, he definitely sees why he feels caged but Tony absolutely does not understand Steve’s animosity to the genius. They were fine not an hour before, weren’t they? Of course Tony had assumed Steve may had been faking at that point anyway. He was likely faking the whole time, Tony thought.
“Got it.” He replied as he quickly dodged an incoming attack from one of the goons.
Even more distressing was the very perceptible sound of heart monitors all around him. One, in particular, had him nearly on the edge of his seat. He could tell, it was getting slower, ever so slightly slower each passing second.
He looked around and thought a moment.  There was a five story building next to the one facing the open window.  Maybe just maybe he could jump from there.  He could do it easily at full strength, but in the condition he was in now?  He couldn’t help but to think he could barely clear a puddle at this point.  But he had to try nonetheless.  For his team, his family, for Tony.
Tony had a very difficult time bringing himself to do that last part, however. He vehemently insisted that he was the one that needed to set the device on Steve but had avoided it till now.
"Oh yeah, you have that baby shower for Nancy today."
“I’m sure.” He replied still clutching desperately to his convictions.
Steve eyes widened and Tony continued,
“Don’t worry about it Tony, how much you spend won’t mean a thing when the world ends. But it means everything now, to all of us.” Steve replied reassuringly.
“My dear Steven.” She approached him steadily and Tony’s grip on his hand tightened with no sign of relenting, his fingers digging in.
Many, especially Tony, visually relaxed just a little.
He hated how thankful he was that Calamity's code was so complex. He had learned a lot about actual impossible encryptions. To make sure the Rhododendron could not undo his work, Tony left a nasty encryption that would give himself a headache if he had to decrypt it.
Bucky eyed the suit skeptically but nodded in assent.
“And I have something very special in store for you, Love.” She said mysteriously as she’d reached up and planted a kiss on Steve’s forehead before completely and utterly disappearing.
All questions, comments and theories welcome.
“Nah ah, me first.”
“You defied a direct order from the president himself. An executive order.” He stated.
*~0~*
Back to where he failed and betrayed his team and back to a place where Tony hates him.
Steve followed this look and shrugged. “Not that I can think of.” Steve replied.
“Now Kevin!”
Okay, pity party over. Tony did not like this attitude. He finally got a hold of himself and remembered why he was here.
“Sir, the restraints OS is disabled.” Jarvis alerted.
He knew his statement was rather stiff, he hoped Tony would take is as exhaustion.
She sighed, "Because, we are all connected through Yggdrasil yet at the same time completely disconnected. These past eons as the universe expands, we have all been slowly pulling apart. I want to reconnect us.
The projectile came from another creature from a different tribe. I can understand if it was done because they needed her flesh for sustenance, needed her furs for warmth, or her tools for work. I could understand because such unfortunate happenstances occurred in nature.
On the other side next to Maria were Bruce, Natasha then Clint. The Director was at the relative front walking about as he continued.
The Other Side~
The man beamed. "What can I do you for today? That hoe holding up well, I hope?" He inquired in a gruff yet kind voice.
“It gets better.” Clint cut in knowing what the others were thinking.
That was always one of the things that fascinated him most about Tony Stark, he never knew what was going on in his head. Just when Steve thought he had him figured out Tony, without fail, would pull a 180 on him and he’d have to start all over again. Sometimes he didn’t mind. He loved how Tony was a complicated puzzle like that.
“I used to receive large hand-me-downs when I was younger. I’d do just this so I wouldn’t trip.”
Steve shook his head unable to explain.
Steve was now really biting his tongue.
“Were any of those worlds war torn at the time?” Asked Bruce.
It can’t be!
Tony gaped at him. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He didn’t!
“Or tear you limb from limb?” She supplied.
He could only nod, his bottom lip quivering as he began to get caught up in all of the emotion.
“Oh yeah, Thor said the same thing when I showed this to him.” Tony said. “He was able to confirm that it was an accurate representation of Yggdrasil but could not ascertain much else, even after consulting the historians of Asgard.” He shrugged tiredly. “I’ve personally explored as much as I could about the lore. I honestly have no idea how to fit anything I found into a working key for the data.”
“Heh, that’s smart, good strategy.” He looked sideways at the siblings worryingly. They looked back equally concerned.
Keep in mind that I started this story way back in 2012 after the first Avengers movie came out. That being said the time line is so wonky it is pretty much no longer cannon. Its cannon adjacent. I'm still pulling elements from the other films so it's close enough.
Chapter Forty-Three: When It's Do or Die
The Avengers are now officially on the case. They pooled their information and resources. SHIELD had only a little bit more information than Tony.  The genius acquired most of his information by hacking into shields mainframe anyway.
‘Wait WHAT??!’
“She was right. You’re not worth it.” The genius turned abruptly intending to leave. Instead he paused for a moment’s turning slightly. “God, I wish they hadn’t dug you out of the ice. You should have been left there.” He stated finally before walking away leaving our dear Captain completely and utterly devastated.
But why?!
"No! I'm forgetting again!" He realized with horror.
Tony whipped around instantly.
Oh God, if he only knew. He probably tried to kill Tony… Again.
Is it just me or is his skin taking on a slight greenish hue.
“On it.” Clint replied.
His own heart cried for her. It wasn't fair that she had to do this incredible thing with only the nurses and doctors to support her and not her family.
Looking back he realized that he never did have the desire to do that for anyone else but Tony.  But now he knew.  No matter how hard he tried he knew he could not lie to himself anymore.  But he tried anyway, and thus his night was spent as such, going back and forth between knowing and realizing the truth to trying to make excuses and denying it.  And that is how the morning found our poor Captain in such a state.
“Do… Do you know when?”
“Fine! You’re right, dick.” Before Tony got up he leaned in and claimed another kiss. “I’m glad you’re okay.” He whispered standing up.
They held their gaze as Steve began to lean closer, their noses touching softly.  Both were hoping to convey everything they were feeling through this deeply tender contact.  Just as Steve was about to take that final leap and press his full lips onto Tony’s firm ones, he froze momentarily before whipping around abruptly, quickly pulling Tony behind him, shielding the genius from their new visitor.
‘Steve…’ Tony understood.
Just as he was going to go through another round of instant replay in his head a shadow loomed over the thick glass panel of his cell.
“Because you are not ready. One does not simply pick a fruit before it is at its sweetest nor a flower before it is at its loveliest if one is seeking perfection, the absolute best out of something.” She explained with an air of reverence.
“Excellent! Make the proper preparations!”
Steve looked down at himself and realized that he was still pretty much in his pajamas.
Tony hated this. He had no idea how to proceed.
When ‘One Last Breath’ by Creed started, Tony breathed a sigh of relief. Barnes visibly relaxed then fully turned to the monitor to begin his mission to rifle through Tony’s files anew.
Answers.
It didn’t help one bit that he hadn’t been eating either. He groaned miserably as he rolled back over and began to wrap himself up in his blankets making himself into a Tony burrito. He concentrated on his breathing until it resembled something moderately akin to steady. He sighed restlessly when he realized there was no chance in hell he was getting back to sleep. He wiggled his way to the other side of the bed and begrudgingly hauled himself to his feet, blankets and all, and began to make his way to his workshop.
A/N: I hope you all enjoyed this little piece of domestic fluff. This will be one of the last major Steve centric chapters until we start really getting into the rising climax. Now we are going to have to figure out what Tony and the others are up to. What plans does Tony have for Bucky? And what role will the twins play later on? Well, you gotta keep reading to find out.
When Xavier and the others arrived they had been briefed with the harrowing news and had jumped right into brainstorming ideas after being sworn in to secrecy. They had even began to assist Tony and Bruce with the simulations in addition to aiding Natasha and Clint in detecting a pattern.
His glare turned to ice.
The soldier shook himself out of whatever thought he was in and made to re-engage.
“Okay. You may have already noticed your current pain muted somewhat.” Bucky nodded slightly in affirmation.
Suddenly, an all-consuming clap of thunder resonated throughout the area. Tony might have grinned impishly.
“Hello Captain Rogers, I am Dr. Lillie Davidson and I am the physician attending you this day.” Dr. Davidson greeted.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
“Because of you they will.”  Said Becka’s mother.
“You meant the world to him you know. Honestly, he would probably kick my ass for coming up with such a stupid plan.” He sighed again. “But I think you and I both know he would still go along with it being that it is the end of the world after all. We can’t give up now.” He said softly.
“When has that ever worked out for you?” Steve teased.
Steve looked around at the halls of the now empty hospital.
Steve's eyes widened, "You just did that all in your head."
Back to all the pain.
“Enough!” Steve shouted. Wow, he didn’t actually think he was going to.
"No." He shook his head.
But instead of making a big deal about his word usage he remained silent.  Steve learned from past experiences that to get worked up and defend his words only served to make the situation more amusing for those involved.  Especially with Natasha and Clint.  They would tease him relentlessly.  So this time he chose to keep silent.
Steve couldn’t help but to think that he probably looks like a lost puppy.
Loki was an incredible opponent and a very skillful magician. The things that he was capable of on a normal day were frightening enough but with the added power of his freaky deaky staff, the tesseract and a Chitori army, he was nearly unstoppable. Now they were going to deal with yet another alien foe? Oh, how fun. Well at least they still have the Hulk, yep that’ll work.
So here Tony was, wallowing in self-misery yet again. He seemed to be doing that a lot lately. He took a sip of his expensive scotch and hummed in derision. The others have been taking turns posting guard over the soldiers assigned quarters.
“I never really sleep, not fully, not deeply.” He clarified.
“Sir?” The AI’s voice resounded from seemingly everywhere.
Steve helped him sit up and rubbed his back soothingly.
"Yeah, get out of here, Rogers. Take all that bad karma with you." She said with a wink.
Tony nodded slowly, ideas, probabilities and possible solutions quickly forming in his own brain.
Steve slowly looked from the little radio in his hand up to Natasha’s shocked expression.
“Just a sec. Here.” Tony announced.
“We shall see.” Tony replied conspiratorially.
Steve eventually got up to the Calamity case and talked about his “date” with Tony that led to his stunning revelation and then everything he went through after that. He stuttered his way through the first kiss he shared with Tony after he woke up from his run in with the giant zapper. He went into how lost and confused he was over Tony’s behavior after that and what it felt like coming to the realization that they could never be together after learning he was the keystone and everything that meant for them. He stopped just before waking up in the tower.
Steve merely shook his head equally lost. At first he was immensely uncomfortable with Calamity being incredibly touchy feely with him. He knew he could do nothing to stop her. Any attempt to do so could have led to his death or the death of any of his team. He would not allow that.
Steve woke up with a start. He opened his eyes and immediately regretted it. His head was pounding and all he could see were bright white walls. His whole body felt like he somehow survived an encounter with a meat grinder. He groaned.
“Yes sir!” Ben saluted.
They sat in fragile silence for a bit, staring at the sky. The stars shining like precious diamonds.
“Uh, no not really.  It was a house in Heartland, Massachusetts where my grandmother lived.  I would walk past it on the way to the market.  It was the long way there, but I avoided the other kids that way.  I had always stopped to admire the house, it looked so…  Peaceful and warm I guess.”  The captain trailed off when it seemed Tony was looking a bit dazed.
I apologize for any and all errors.
Holy fuck that hurt!
“Well, fuck me.” He sighed.
It felt so real…
“Tell him Captain, he needs to know.” Wanda suggested from her brothers arms.
“Yes, I know! Exactly the point I’m making. After all that, it got me thinking that all of this is very invasive and still takes away what little stability and control you finally and painstakingly regained. You’re still so utterly vulnerable that you would instinctively fight tooth and nail to keep that control. So, I’ve come up with a deal for you.” Tony said as he started checking himself out in the monitors.
“Likewise Captain Rogers.”
Johnny merely nodded and pulled all the kids to him. And he never loosened his hold even when they struggled and fought.
“Ah!” Bucky squealed.
“I told you Nat-“
“Why won’t you tell me!? Please, I need to know!”
The others nodded and Bruce groaned resting his head in his hands. Natasha patted him on the back reassuringly.
Steve sat at his desk staring at his blank sketch pad.  He let his thoughts run all over the place before he could no longer decipher them.  He absent mindedly put his pencil to the paper and began to sketch.
“I guess it’s good that I can get back on track but what I still don’t get is why Nat got so bent out of shape over this. You know she threatened to put a bullet in my head? Like three times.” Tony whined.
"I guess I understand. Was that a unique trait she had?"
"Dammit!" He choked back a sob. "God, I am so stupid!"
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony without thinking and fell asleep instantaneously to the slight illumination of his ark reactor. Tony was mildly shocked at first by Steve’s absent minded forwardness but settled in and listened to Steve’s strong and steady heart beat. Like the most enchanting the lullaby Tony fell asleep quickly enough.
“Cap! Cap, you gotta see this!”
“Shit, move Dumbass!” Tony shouted at Hawkeye.
Leave it to Tony to come up with a new wily idea.
But no! He just had to be a jackass and jerk around with Tony's emotions. He knew deep down he truly trusted Tony with everything. Tony was this unique, quirky, enigmatic, genius asshole that he couldn't help falling in love with and yet Steve managed to fuck it all up.
“You play the piano.” He blurted suddenly. ‘Real smooth.’ He winced to himself.
"Would ya?" She asked hopeful, her face tear stained.
On the other side…
“Well then get to it.”  Commanded Fury in a haste.
“Excuse me, but,” Barnes cut in. “What is Lego?” He asked confused.
Steve smiled.
"Hmm," he hummed, looking around the floor and spotting the elevator in question. "I don't see why not, let's go." He smiled tugging her hand.
The other children were starting to really lose it and Steve couldn’t hold them off.
He looked around at everyone with a grin on his face.
Tony ran his worn hands through his dark messy hair trying to calm himself. He promised himself he wasn’t going to get emotional over this, that he wasn’t going to give that conniving bastard the satisfaction…
Now, Steve was scrambling to fix dinner while Ellie prattled on about her day at school and the things she was learning. Steve found that it calmed his nerves considerably listening to her talk, so much so, he almost didn't burn the other pork chop.
Bucky somehow managed to curl in on himself making his hulking form seem so small and broken.
“Or, that time you helped me cheat on a test.”
“It can be a bit of a rush your first time, so brace yourself, my friend.” He paused before looking up to the heavens.
The soldier merely glanced at him.
The Rhododendron had figured out how to use the suits weapons system. His first target? The containment field.
Steve…
“Yeah, get lost, I’m done looking at your face.” Tony replied with a smirk.
He had failed.
"Are you falling asleep on me?" He smirked.
Tony looked at Clint a long while. Loki tried to take control of him the same way he did Clint. Somehow his arc reactor shielded him, an artificial heart not so easily swayed. In that moment Tony was truly afraid. All of the weapons he had access to, his suits, his life’s work could have been completely at Loki’s disposal. Everything he painstakingly built to protect people with could have easily been used to destroy them.
But now the element of surprise was gone and the Rhododendron was lined up to retaliate. Tony knew this because now his weapons were aimed at Clint.
"ETA on suit arrival?"
“Jesus Christ, this chick is no joke, is she?”
Honestly, they say curiosity killed the cat for a reason but in Tony's defense he sure as hell did not expect to be sucked into Steve's mind reality so thoroughly that he was actually capable of interacting with him. What he did know, however, was that any interaction with Steve was going to end in a glorious blaze of catastrophe. When Tony realized that he was never going to exist in Steve's little perfect world; it was, for lack of a better word, devastating.
“Yeah I’m good.” Tony chuckled out as he let out a few more snickers.
“Yep!”
The scene laid out before Steve seemed to be so familiar like déjà vu… Damn it’s the Loki incident all over again.
He looked down fondly at her. "As long as you behave today. I don't see why not."
It had been three days since his talk with Steve and in those regards Calamity. And in that time, he and his team and several of his sentinel robots and iron legion prototypes had traveled the world trying to get each and every device in place and activated. Unfortunately, that had left what was left of the Avengers mercilessly spread too thin and the Rhododendron knew it.
Tony bristled.
"No!" Tony shouted, angered at her superior attitude. "No, it's not over yet! Take me instead! Please, this world needs him more than me. Please let me take his place!" Tony bargained.
“So… Howard is engaged?” Steve asked still a little befuddled.
“Now let’s continue, come on people we are here for a reason. From what we have gathered what are the possible causes? Professor Xavier, what is your opinion?” The Director asked Charles, his unspoken question if a mutant is behind this crazy chaos lingered in the air unsaid.
“Yes, I can’t wait to meet them.” She replied shyly again.
“There you go.” Steve said as he pulled away.
A/N: Oh boy! Sorry again for the late update, but I am so happy that all of you are still following along diligently. Thank you all so much for taking the time to read and review, you make me happy. Without any further ado on with the show!
He returned her smile.
"What does it mean?"
“What does it matter if we can’t save the people who are already gone?”  He shouted angrily.
He did not know how this whole thing worked but knew there was a possibility that he needed to die for her to achieve her goals.
“If things go south, which I’m not going to lie is an extreme possibility, you take her and run.” Steve implored to Pietro. “Don’t look back, just run.”
Tony frowned at her. “Yay for irony.” He replied sarcastically.
“Okay people, this is obviously becoming horribly redundant, Mr. Stark what if you got?”  Fury stated with tired resignation.  It has definitely been a long couple of days.
"Excuse me? What was that?" He ground out lowly, pronouncing each word crisply.
The fat man pulled out a gun and held it to the temple of the translator.
Hours had passed in a flash. When Tony had gotten back to his lab he had gone straight to work. He created program after program an attempt to solve the puzzle, but to no avail. It was digital complexity at his finest. There was no way he was going to solve it without the proper key. It was a massive digital mess. Petabytes of ones and zeros and without the right key or program to read it there was no way to figure out how to actually use it to create a device to reverse Calamity’s effects.
Now that he was alone with his thoughts, he noticed something odd. He was surrounded by the sounds of heart monitors and one in particular, he had realized with remorse, was slowing down ever so slightly.
“It’s encrypted. It’s going to take a while to hack, it’s pretty complex.” Tony replied dryly. They all deflated dramatically.
There was no safe place in the entire city as long as there was at least one of these things floating around. The coms signal came back again and he didn’t even know his blood could run colder.
“Figures.” He sighed. “What happened?”
Tony’s chest constricted and he dropped his head in his hands again and tried to contain his dark emotions. He took several shuttering breath’s, each more jagged than the last.
Everybody seemed to stiffen in fear. The genius could swear he saw his life flash before his eyes. She was about to reach for him, but Steve caught her wrist in a vice, his expression was severe and he growled in warning.
‘Finally!’ His heart screamed.
“I am never going back there!” He bellowed as his anguish washed over him like a tidal wave.
It was now just a little after breakfast, and we find our Captain on dish duty yet again. After calming down considerably after that… dream, he apologized to Peggy for his abrupt dismissal and reassured her that he was fine. He had also established that no, he was not too overwhelmed to take care of Ellie today and yes, Peggy should go help with the baby shower and that yes, he was well enough to finish his errands.
"What limitations?"
Maybe, just maybe…
No, this was all going to happen anyway. Calamity would have ensured it.
Tony smiled and left. As he walked down the corridor door to his lab he frowned slightly. He thought about how Steve was likely in a lot of pain right now and they couldn’t do anything about it because his body metabolized drugs too damn fast. He had to do something about that. He put a pin in that idea for later. Right now, there’s one thing thousand times more important to focus on. If there was even the slightest possibility that he could figure out a way to save Steve from Calamity’s clutches, then that’s exactly what he was going to do. She said she couldn’t be stopped but what if that was because she was sorely underestimating Tony Stark? If the possibility existed, then he needed to find it asap. A good place to start was to figure out what was exactly in that code…
“You are! I only know of the one, are there more?”
"There is nothing we can do."
No Fucking shit!
“Why?”  He asked almost brokenly.
“Well if the brat is going I gotta make sure he doesn’t kill anyone.” Ben replied.
Bruce, used to the oddities that always seemed to involve the various members of his team which included the notorious Tony Stark, ignored the said man and went straight to Professor Xavier for introductions.
He can’t really imagine working on anything mechanical in there. To be honest anything that has to do with mechanics and technology was most certainly not his strong suit. He usually left those kind of things to Howard and… Bucky. He shook himself.
“I don’t know what you think was going on but that man loved you! He was hurting!” She shouted harshly as fresh tears fell from her face. “I know this whole thing is messy and you’re hurt and angry right now, but you need to pull your head out of your ass for one God damn second and figure this out!”
“That must have been awful.” Ellie commented sadly.
A/N: Woot! Now things are really getting down and dirty. The next chapter is going to be quite the doozy. Don’t forget to leave a comment and tell me what you think.
“What all that means is that it will be insanely painful. I’m not joking in the least. Are you ready?”
"Wait, you mean Tony and Pepper never…"
“I know the feeling.” The soldier muttered dryly. “I don’t know how complete this is,” he murmured remorsefully. “I memorized as much of it as I could, when I could.” He lifted his hand away from screen. “It’s the best I can do.” He paused for a moment, looking over his work, and snorted in derision. “It’s stupid that it took seventy years for me to get this to you.” He mused regretfully.
She said that last time, then it hit him.
So good, in fact, that he had sacrificed himself to save millions of people. He couldn’t possibly have been real.
"If you're sure…" Frank murmured slowly.
Natasha took his silence as pensive reflection and resignation.
The drawing depicted a sunny day illuminating an old country house with a large oak tree that had an old fashioned rope swing with a plank of wood as its seat.  It had a large yard, large enough for children and pets to play freely.  The land was bordered with a white picket fence that had various rosebushes lining its path.  It was a picture of the age old vision of the American dream, truly picturesque.
But before Steve could figure out how to calmly talk things over with him, the man had disappeared out of thin air just as Ellie rounded the corner.
Supreme conquest.
“You seem to be a different model from the others” Captain America observed noticing its different shapes and curvatures.
Her harsh words startled him, throwing him back to that fateful night…
He could see his team relax significantly in the corner of his eye. Even Natasha was standing down. His full attention was brought back to Tony as the genius began to kiss him, in front of everyone!!
And that was something he would never forgive himself for. If only, if only…
"Oh, you are so tempting, soldier. I fear one day I'll give in to you completely." She whispered leaning in for another tender kiss.
He caved.
Tony continued watching as Steve hobbled back to his medical room. Tony showed up sometime later a tad disheveled himself now sporting casual wear.
Tony sighed he already had made up his mind to go talk to Steve.
“Yep!” She exclaimed.
Both scenarios made him sick as fuck. The tears began to spill unrelentingly. How is this is life? His next thought was by far the most sickening and wretched. He thought with forlorn hope that he couldn’t wait for Calamity to take him. He laid back down and stared at the ceiling.
He did not know how much he would come to regret that scream.
He absently became aware of the fact that he was in a cell. A super max design for enhanced individuals. He was bound in chains and with bitter irony realized he was strapped into that steel straitjacket that Fury threatened him with all those days ago.
As the Super Soldier ushered the babbling drunken man to his room, the crazy genius started to utter some of his most profound secrets that not even Rhodey or Pepper knew. Needless to say he had to completely trust Steve to keep his secrets safe. Somehow, though, he found that it really wasn’t all that difficult to do so.
“Oops!” She said as she smacked her hands over her mouth.
He couldn’t bring himself to really get into a new piece of work when the whole world was on the line. Thankfully Tony understood.
Tony looked relatively unconvinced but accepted it anyway.
“Something’s happening.”  He whispered.
“No!”
“Tony, unit two is coming in. Pull back and begin ring formation.”
Steve shook his head.
He did not know. Obviously he was wrong. Steve couldn’t trust him and it hurt so much.
“Oh my God!” Hawkeye spoke out over the silence.
After putting the finishing touches on his drawing, he could not help but to think he was truly fond of this man. He must be a very important friend, if not his best friend of this time. He cursed his amnesia for the umpteenth time since waking up under the large Maple tree. He detested not remembering his life with Peggy and Ellie, he hated not remembering his neighbors and members of the community and now, he found his lack of memory of this mystery friend of his utterly loathsome.
It turns out that 74 and 75 were related. They were siblings that had been separated after a family tragedy.
Steve’s instincts weren’t the only things dialed up past ten. His other senses were insanely remarkable also. He could sense the way his small team subtly moved and twitched as they struggled to stay focused and aware of their surroundings. He could see the little movements of their surroundings, a stray cat here, a pile of garbage there. He could taste the salt in the air, the industrial district being so close to the docks. He could smell the odor of rusting iron, crumbling firebrick, exhaust fumes and the unmistakable scent of sweat coming from his team in the anticipation of the looming battle.
Bucky glared at him but surprisingly complied. Tony paused searching for the right words. He stared at the jagged remains of Bucky’s left arm. Despite the deplorable condition his torso is surely in, Tony’s willing to bet the soldiers arm is by far the center of most of his pain.
About an hour later we find our Captain finally releasing his left hand out of a restraint. He had finally developed a rhythm of gentle tugging and twisting to slowly inch his hand free. After losing patience with that, in a fit he dislocated his thumb and yanked his hand free. He reset it with a sickening pop after releasing his other hand.
She laughed, "No, not in the way you think. Yes, I have conjured this illusion I am showing you now. However, this is a real place very far from here." She said almost remorsefully. "At least, it once was."
To sooth the uproar he knew was coming, Professor Xavier cut in,
She gracefully strode over to Thor and ran a hand down his cheek.
'Free from who? What's going on?'
Queue fiery catastrophe.
Steve looked out over the skyline of the cityscape from where he stood on an isolated balcony of the Avengers tower as he anxiously awaited Tony's arrival.
Family…
Tony rolled over and vomited the meager contents of his stomach onto the floor.
losing it. He was afraid that after everything was all said and done he was not going to be functional anymore, that he wasn’t going to be ‘Tony’ anymore.
The Captain was his anchor.
On the otherside…
He started laughing as Thor went a bit red in the face. Thor immediately turned and clomped out of the room leaving a very annoying genius and an unfortunately lost Captain behind.
They gestured crossing their hearts. Steve smiled
The top layer of the beverage was the pale yellow lemonade immersed in the crystal like ice cubes and the bottom layer was this gorgeous almost fluorescent like purple liquid.  They both stared at the glass transfixed for a little longer before Steve slowly put the straw to his lips.
Now Tony was even more lost. “Give what back?”
His body began to lift off of the ground.
"One-"
Tony and the others stared at her warily. Most of his team, he realized with a start, had begun to congregate into the crater.
“Oh my gosh, Tony, this is delicious.”  Delighted in surprised at the wonderful flavor Steve began to suck on the straw more vigorously.
“Heh, I figured that much. You always thought of the dumbest ways to do things.” Bucky sighed.
Steve sighed heavily. "Tony, always." Steve replied.
"I'm sorry." Somehow, Steve was shocked at how sincere he truly was.
Tony was casually dressed, donning a light dark gray sweater shirt, deep blue jeans and a pair of chucks. His hair was just the right amount of messy, he was absolutely stunning.
(See the end of the chapter for
Chapter Twenty-Two: Last Night On Earth
“I know.” Steve cut him off. He looked him square in the eye. “But the people who think you did are looking for you now. And they’re not planning on taking you alive.”
“They’re fine.”  Natasha smiled. “Johnny made sure each one had been reunited with their parents.  All of them were in perfect health, even Becka.”  Natasha verified.
“Just say ‘thank you Steve’ and move on.” Steve laughed.
"What are you thinking, James?" Natasha inquired, also apparently catching on to his silence.
He was thinking about ending the meeting right there on a positive note while everybody was in a slightly better mood and they had a plan of action under way. Let’s face it the sooner the meeting ended the sooner he could go find some peace and quiet meaning some shut eye.  But Natasha, one of the only other agents beside Steve and Tony to actually get a bit of sleep, had thought of a wicked realization.  With a head more clear than most she had quickly thought of something a horrible and shocking, something that seemed to escape the others.
Steve only nodded.  He pressed a kiss into Tony’s hair.  Tony leaned up to look Steve in the eye.
That's all he had. Five minutes to rebuild the spatial distorter that ten minutes ago he believed only existed on paper. Five minutes to solder tiny delicate machinery into something that would have taken himself hours to assemble. Five minutes until the hole grew large enough to suck them all into its pseudo-void and simultaneously unleash who knows how many hell beasts into their world. Five minutes until the end.
"It's something Calamity said." He replied. "I re-watched the footages a couple of times, trying to get a feel for her, trying to figure out her angle." He explained.
As he floated along the vast empty space he couldn't help but to sigh and shake his head at all the stupid decisions that led him to this very moment.
So, much to Tony’s ire, Barnes’s playlist consisted of the oddest selection of music; bouncing around between jazz, swing, classic rock, punk rock, metal and soul. Tony could not begrudge him of it however, because incidentally, music calmed the soldier down immensely. It’s affect at soothing him was even greater than that of Wanda. When their burn war proved to no longer distract Barnes from his personal hell while installing the new hardware, his music became invaluable.
Enter the Winter Soldier.
He had the soldier pinned to the asphalt. He was putting up one hell of a storm of a struggle, but Steve was adamant to see what was behind the mask. He knew once he found out there was no going back. That the answer he sought would surely destroy him. However, he decided that not knowing was infinitely worse. He wasn’t going to let this soldier slipped through his fingers, not this time.
“You’re going to trust me right?! Steve, please trust me. I will bring him back.” Tony pleaded with him. “Please, just stay here please.”
“Eleanor, darling, why don’t you go show Daddy your other drawings while I get dinner started.” She suggested with a wink.
“But at least you’d be alive.”  Tony replied.
"That would be the next logical step, unfortunately, there are not many life bearing planets in the Midgardian realm. Even less with sentient souls, one in fact." She admitted.
“Enough!” Steve shouted before Clint and Tony could get into it further.
Why is it this on top of everything!?
'Not here.'
“So I see,” she paused.  “Do you need my assistance?”
“Yeah, definitely Tony.”
“So, that’s it? Just slap it on and call it good?” Barton asked.
"Then let's go home. Please Daddy. Let's go home." She grabbed his hand and rubbed the strange dark bruise on his wrist. "Forget about this." She whispered then kissed the mark. "Let's go home." She smiled up at him.
The three old friends began reminiscing about a few of their more hairy missions, weaving intricate details of action, mystery and mayhem. Both Ellie and Maria were hooked.
“Tony what is going on?”  He finally asked lowly and desperately.
He took a deep breath and began to read. He did not know how right he was in assuming the contents of the letter. What he truly was not prepared for, however, was the fact that it was a love letter.
Steve smiled as he began to ascend the stairs and hear Eleanor singing to herself. As he got closer he recognized the song as “You Are My Sunshine.” His chest tightened as he listened. Her voice was so melodic and clear, it was enchantingly beautiful.
“Yes, you by far brought us the most concern.”  Hank replied.
“Okay!” She squealed excitedly as she ran up the stairs.
I could understand if her death meant someone else could survive. But this murder I could not understand.
“Yep, which makes me desperately vulnerable to you right now.” Tony stated seriously.
He began to wind around the front of the house. There he could clearly view the place the way he had all those years ago. It’s nearly the same as it had been before. He walked out to the street to get a better view.
"Yours is a special case. You already have the capacity for great empathy. However, one cannot go through all this pain without learning something of value from it. Tell me, why did you reject the little niche of heaven I created for you? You could have been very happy there. Even when you were aware enough to know, you rejected it, why?"
Chapter Twenty-One: Point of No Return
"Sounds like a nice fantasy. I don't see how that is possible without encroaching on free will." Steve replied skeptically.
Dumm-E followed close behind him holding onto a large stainless-steel case.
He grabbed his chest as his heart pulsated painfully.
After thinking it over he came to the conclusion that Steve’s hands were the absolutes safest for it. Then he learned his brother doesn’t have much time. After reading the letter Steve ment to send to his team he decided that it would best be in their hands. Despite his reservation about various members, he trusts his brothers judgment. He left a note on a piece of paper trying his best to quickly explain such a sentiment. He placed the Journal and notes in the box and sealed it. He proceeded to follow Steve’s instructions and prayed to God that he did not make the stupidest mistake of the century.
Back on the other side…
Back to the point, Tony did not have to wait long after such a serious and complicated operation to go ahead and fuck with the newly installed bone anchors and mount a prototype. Indeed, the worst of the healing was mostly completed by this point as evidence of how much whining the soldier managed yesterday. It was still two hours yet till 2 o’clock, so Tony decided to go ahead and work on deciphering Calamity’s data load.
What?  The alien attacked the ‘School for Gifted Youngsters?’  But most of the occupants were just kids.
Steve was the very symbol of hope and strength unmatched. In that moment he was truly the personification of hero.
He was doing something important.  He blinked again only to discover more people in the room.  Director Fury was talking to Hank and Charles.  When did they arrive?
Steve frowned. He was immensely uncomfortable at finding himself in such unfamiliar territory, completely unsure of how to proceed. So he stood there in silence until the King acknowledged his presence.
Steve was so lost in thought he barely caught Peter asking him a question.
“What is it Boss?  Is it not the right one?”
“Oh Steve, thank God for small mercies.”  Tony whispered as he planted his face into the crook of Steve’s neck holding onto him fiercely.
“Thank you. It’s true I don’t want to talk about it but I have to. I need to.” Steve replied not breaking eye contact.
Steve laughed bitterly.
“It was the strangest feeling. I sensed a… force of sorts that penetrated the minds of the victims. At first it felt somewhat similar to how I pick up on thoughts. However that is where the similarities end. Whoever it was penetrated the victims mind with a force that I never felt before. It was in no way human or mutant. The energy exuded was definitely not terrestrial. Thus, we are likely dealing with an extraterrestrial entity.” Xavier finished his explanation with elegance.
He smirked reveling at how easy it was to confuse these things.
She leaned up and kissed him once more before leaving the kitchen. Steve smiled to himself as he listened to Peggy say her goodbyes to Ellie. He gently scrubbed at the ceramic dishware, thinking how incredible his life had become. It's like his wildest dreams had come true.
He had to get free.
Finally, Tony heard the voice of an Angel.
The genius waited for him to continue a little concerned.
His mind instantly took him back to a Hydra factory self-destructing, flames everywhere and a distraught Bucky refusing to leave without him.
Bucky only blinked. Steve found them and got them to safety that night. He idly wondered what would have happened if his brother arrived any later or not at all.
“It’s even riskier with you going.” Bucky argued.
"No, no, no, no! What have you done!?"
And, of course, don’t forget to leave me a review and let me know what you think so far! You guys rock.
But why? And what does it all have to do with a heart monitor?
“You ready to go, Babydoll?”
Tony liked jazz as much as the next guy, but Barnes’s playlist consisted of some of the more obscure and absurd tracks he’s ever heard. Right before a clasp was to be attached the soldier would change the track to some upbeat swing. It annoyed Tony to no end. Even more so when he realized that, after a time, Barnes was doing it on purpose to all irritate Tony further having recognized the genius’s initial annoyance.
Steve paled in realization. The baby's coming. Now a different kind of panic set in.
All they needed now were a few leviathans, a couple of OP Asgardians and maybe a Death Star. Then they could really get this party started.
"Why give your race a fighting chance?" She asked exasperated. "You sound just like your mate." She muttered. "I am not inherently evil. My methods may seem harsh and barbaric to you but I assure you I have the universes best interests at heart." She replied. "You asked me yourself if this all was a test and I answered.
Seriously, you can’t write this shit; because apparently the best friend of the man he was in love with murdered his parents.
“What I am saying my friends, is that there is very little hope for you, your race and your planet. We know next to nothing about this being except that the few times it has appeared throughout the millennia it has brought nothing but chaos and ruin to all the peoples of its chosen planet. Nothing had ever been able to stop it, to even touch it.” He stopped and looked at his team’s forlorn faces.
“Try me!” Bucky challenged before looking up at what Tony was working on. “What the hell is that?” He said pointing to the holo-screen.
Beep. Beep.
Tony landed with an agonizing thud.
“We’re definitely going to want to talk privately.” The genius suggested as he began to move to head back to his lab.
He thought for a moment.
Crap!
As soon as the door was open the hidden occupants of the little room began screaming. He emerged promptly to reveal himself hoping his presence and identity would alleviate their fear. He was not disappointed as three children stopped immediately and gaped at him in awe.
The sound of shattering glass cascaded around him once more. The walls cracked, no, not just the walls he realized, the entire vision seem to be coming apart.
He had just come up with the most insane and stupidest idea by far. Seriously, he should get an award for coming up with the stupidest solutions possible in any given situation. He must be half crazy or delirious considering he began to agree with the others that he should have remained locked up. Why did they not do a better job?!
“I’m sure you can agree that eating just that one apple today is not all that healthy, why don’t we find someplace where we can have an honest to god dinner?”  With that Steve looked relatively appeased.  A nice hot meal would do them all good.
‘Tony!’
"Daddy?" Ellie asked tugging his hand.
On the other side…
The haze felt thicker.
Natasha had reunited with Clint as soon as she was free. She had planned to regroup and come up with a solution only to turn around and realize that Steve was not with her but convulsing on the ground with the doom bot just above him. There was nothing either of them could do.
Director Nick Fury looked at his team. Really looked at them. If this was truly the end, he couldn’t think of a finer bunch of people you would rather share the end with.
"And how long is soon?" Asked the man quirking an eyebrow.
He scratched his wrist.
Originally I was going to have Sam tell him but Steve and Johnny had surprisingly developed such an odd relationship I could not help myself.
“Then explain it!”
It’s almost blasphemous.
"No! It needs to be bigger! She needs to be brought into this world!"
During his movements, as he went about taking out the agents, he strategically moved Rumlow away from the elevator. Now Bucky stood between Tony and Brock. Bucky dropped the now unconscious agent at his feet and faced the sixth agent head on.
“Honestly, I’d rather beat you with the chair than even sit in it.” He sighed heavily. “But that isn’t going to help save the world is it?”
I found out very quickly that ripping their souls out of their bodies caused the most pain. After that, I ripped out all the souls from the entire tribe. When that did not soothe my pain, I ripped the souls out of every single living creature on the entire planet. And when that could not satisfy me I tore the essence of life itself out of the planet.
“Brace yourself, three, two, one-“ Tony flipped the switch mechanism.
It wasn’t until almost an entire week after the Fuzz Buzz incident did Steve finely get a reprieve from the constant stifling and anxious atmosphere that seemed to follow him around while he was in the presence of everybody else.  And it came in the form of Johnny Storm of all people.
“Not with the stealth activated, it would be impossible to find you.”
“Meh.” Barton shrugged dismissively, clearly intending to irritate Tony.
“Ah, right to the point! Wonderful! I like that mind reader.” She said boisterously.
“Tony!?”
At the very least in his attempt to motivate Barnes he had somehow inspired himself. Like he told Bucky, he couldn’t give up now, he could deal with his demons later, now was the time to get to work.
The claw unlatched from the soldiers leg and Tony swooped in and grabbed Bucky instantly and proceeded to shoot to the surface. As soon as he broke through the surface of the water his warning systems blared and alerted him that there were missiles launched from the subs in pursuit heading right for him. Tony made evasive maneuvers before deploying flares. The missiles explosion rocketed them into the sky further but the percussion was jarring.
“No common physician or scientist has ever encountered the likes before and have concluded a new possible strain. Our people, however, know different. Thus this meeting.” Bruce concluded and took his seat.
“No problem.” Clint winked.
“Take me to bed!” He bellowed between fits of laughter.
Beep.
Wow, nothing to pass this child. Really, he only had himself to blame.
‘Oh yes! I get to deal with this Tony again.’ He thought sarcastically. Here’s to hoping he doesn’t get handsy.
‘That bastard’s buying shit on Amazon!’ He had realized too late.
Steve gave him no sympathy and nodded in agreement.
They weren’t going to let him live after that. He knew exactly what everyone’s orders were going to be.
“But!” She began again. She put her hands over her mouth and began to whisper. Steve leaned in closer to hear. “Between you and me, Daddy, I bet she was fibbing. I bet it was a tall tale.”
No. He knew he had created these pieces of art, he remembered every line, every brushstroke. And he knew Tony was here.
Steve looked up with an un-amused pout.
“Wow, Tony this place is beautiful.”  Steve stated his eyes never leaving the sky.
Steve, Ellie and Angie had been waiting in the waiting room of the maternity ward for nearly 6 hours now. Ellie was asleep on his chest and Angie was asleep next to him. Steve and Ellie were not allowed to see Peggy due to some potential complications that have Steve quite worried.
"What the hell are you doing here?!" He demanded as he stood shakingly.
“I’m Maggie,” the eldest replied. “And this is Eli.” She gestured to the infant in her arms.
To say the flight to Rhode Island was awkward was the understatement of the year. One X-Man, half of the Fantastic Four, and a ragtag crew of the Avengers were all together under Steve’s command.
Steve looked away in shame. Despite knowing her influence over the course of events that had transpired, he also recognized the fact that he had his own responsibility to bear in all of this. He could have reacted better to the various situations given to him, they all could have.
“I’m watching you! You had better behave yourself, you got me? Or else you’re out of here.” She eyed him intently.
She seemed to be in taking a massive amount of air as if she could just taste each of them. Some of the fuzz buzz even seemed to get swallowed up. Just when Tony thought she was done sucking he heard a series of clicks emanating from the back of her throat. Before he could even consider what that could mean the caustic fluid ignited.
Bucky sighed heavily and turned back around in the chair and began to rifle through some of Tony’s personal files.
Ahem, He stayed in Alaska to study criminal justice before he entered the military.
Tony’s eyes widened almost comically and read Steve’s words with a hunger he’d never known before. He was a broken man dying of thirst receiving the elixir of life. Tears spilled from his eyes as he began to weep openly. He took in each line desperately, sometimes even rereading a part just to make sure he got it right.
“We heard you had gotten hurt badly that day, we wanted to see you in the hospital but no one was allowed in.”  Maggie’s father said sadly.
Back to a place where Bucky was dead all over again.
The bullets continued to rain down and Harker continued to cackle.
“No, at least not yet.” Steve scratched the back of his head thinking of the best way to introduce the subject.
He made to pick her up before she leveled him with a glare that sliced into his very soul. It reminded him of… He did not know but he was sure he had been on the receiving end of a glare that promised castration. Perhaps he was remembering Peggy’s but could not shake the notion of piercing green eyes and fiery red hair.
“You’re reckless Steve. Do you honestly believe you would have been fine just sitting on the sidelines without us forcing you!?”
“Here,” he handed Tony two of them, “by all means eat up.” Steve smiled at him.
“Well what if the Asgardians help somehow? How many could fit through the Bifrost? There are ways Asgardians have to evacuate a plant aren’t there?"
Tony still stuck in a somewhat state of shock did not know quite what to do, he looked up at Steve for guidance and he gave Tony a subtle encouraging nod.
"You're a complete nuisance." Tony intoned, looking Barnes over.
'But as time goes on you come to realize that all things happen for a reason. Just as things had been taken from you, many more have been given at the same time.  Back then you lost your friends and mission all at once and nearly your life.  But in this time you have gained your life back, you have made new friends and have a new mission.  There will be a time in your life when you’ll remember these words and understand them completely and utterly and hold them close to your very soul.’”
Suddenly, a silver haired boy appeared several yards away. He was now holding the radar gun. All at once Tony realized who these people were. It was the kids they fought in San Jose. The very one spotted with Steve and Barnes before he found them at the docks. But whose side where they on?
Tony was about to retort when he felt the intense stare of three and a half sets of eyes. He turned to see his team staring at him slack-jawed.
Without any further ado, on with the show!
“It starts just as you see. People falling into an eternal sleep. They never wake up no matter what science or magic is executed.
She grinned long and feral. It’s surprisingly reached her sharp steely eyes.
Not theirs!
“Oops!” She uttered placing her hands over her mouth quickly.
“Most assuredly, I would bet my very existence.” Xavier stated with resolve and absolute assurance.
Then the small child Tony began to play Moonlight Sonata. The whole thing was so shocking and beautiful it nearly brought our Captain to tears.
'Heh, he said my name... why does it sound so fucking good coming from him?' was The Captains last thought as he fully relaxed and allowed himself to fall into nothingness.
This is serious.
‘Here it comes.’ Steve thought.
“Because, it’s the end of the world. There’s no way in hell you are going to let yourself take a backseat for that. Look,” Tony sighed heavily and turned around. “I know getting experimented on is like the last thing you want to even experience again. Trust me, I know.” He could not stress enough how he really knew. “But, I desperately need your help.” He stated finally.
"Couldn't have pulled it off without you." Steve replied.
“Okay.” Bucky agreed, wholly unconvinced.
This got Steve’s attention immediately.  He realized with a start that Johnny was going to tell him what had gotten his team so tight lipped the last couple weeks.
“Are you sure you are okay?” Tony asked.
He sighed heavily, "Damn amnesia." He cursed.
Okay, weird, the Professor was someone who does not waste words.
Steve continued to look away, contrite.
He lifted it jerkily and splayed the fingers on the left-hand. He began to open and close them, all of them at first, then one at a time. When he got the hang of it he obviously could not resist to twist the metal hand around and flip Tony off.
Tony nodded, "Okay, makes sense. How long since you woke up in this time? When does your memory start up again?"
“No! That wasn’t…” He paused. He quickly took out his phone. “Jarvis! Did Steve leave the infirmary on the fifth?”
“What!?” Was Steve’s shrill response.
“W-well I-I…” Steve stuttered.
“How is that possible?” Pepper inquired shocked.
“Oh, it’s one of those kinds of talks.” Clint waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
BANG!!
“And…” The soldier spoke again. “I slept.”
"Yes, quite the individual." She drawled. "You on the other hand, there was still the possibility I could sway you. You have no idea how much work I had to do to get you to say yes. The lengths I had to go to break you."
“N-No we were doing anything!” He replied nervously.
He tore the letter out of the satchel and slammed it against the glass.
Just as Tony was able to knock out the second guy shit hit the fan. Bad guy number three took out Spiderman with an electric net shot from something like a grenade launcher. Before Iron Man could stop bad guy number three and bad guy number four from attacking the projection pods, Tony’s suit froze.
He recalled how he stared at Tony almost the entire time he was asleep engraving his visage into memory. Later after the genius woke up and went back to work Steve re-created the scene with tender passion.
“Do not worry Captain, I can read his mind even now.” Xavier reassured.
“It’s fine.” Steve tried to sound reassuring.
“You all give valid points, but this is my choice. If I’m going down I’m going down my way.” He said.
Tony called ahead to make arrangements of sorts.  They went into the back door and were lead to a secluded booth.  There were very little people in the restaurant which was fine.  Tony stepped out of the suit and had it slide into the booth before he did.  Steve was really digging the restaurant.
“Ah ha… Okay… Yeah…” The genius drawled out as he read the content displayed on his devise.
He knew exactly how he would like to spend it. This wasn’t a fairytale with a happy ending or some cheesy romantic comedy. He knew realistically what he could or couldn’t have. A romantic relationship with Tony was just not in the cards. Just like a quiet life with Peggy wasn’t either.
The moment the door swung open fifty guns were trained on them.
A/N: Welcome back everyone! I am so glad that all of you have come back to read this next chapter. I love you all!
He has so many questions but does not know where to start. He does not want to bug Peggy with a multitude of questioning when perhaps in just a few days he would remember everything he needed to remember. Like the doctors said he just needed patients.
Tony honestly did not know what to do. The entire world was under attack and there were but twenty members of his team left, and one of them was somewhere in outer fucking space. He had sent his Iron Legion prototypes to deal with the fuzz buzz and doom bots popping up everywhere. Unfortunately, the doom bot knockoffs were truly a major threat. However, being fakes, there were some obvious weaknesses he could see from observation alone that were quite exploitable. Jarvis was well-equipped to deal with those vulnerabilities. Regrettably, his Iron Legion prototypes were hilariously outnumbered. If they were taken out too soon a lot of people could die.
“Yes, right away, Jar. The sooner the better.” Tony replied.
“Are you sure you are all right, darling?” She asked with a chuckle.
“Stand down! Do not engage. Please just sit back down.” The last part came out forceful and strained.
No matter how hard he was desperately trying to deny it, a very large part of himself actually did want to kiss Tony.  Wanting the genius’s words that were likely a joke to be very serious.  For the longest time he had been trying to deny that these feelings stirring inside him were nothing but a figment of his imagination.  But after experiencing the incredibly strong desire to kiss his best friend he could no longer ignore what was happening.
He smiled a bittersweet smile.
He’d done it again, mentioned Steve offhandedly without even really thinking about it, only to realize too late and have it all crashed back on him. He had been doing a good job, keeping himself busy enough not to think about him, then bam. It always finds a way to sneak up on him.
