He warmed his hands on his mug as he leaned against the counter. The hot drink warmed him from the inside out, lulling him further into his exhaustion instead of waking him up. Even the coffee was failing him…
No. Tony shuddered and shoved the thought away. Steve would never—there was no way. They must have gone to the forest beyond the field together. But why? What the hell had happened?
Something grabbed at his arm and pulled. Hard.
Those were stories Steve didn’t want to hear about things he didn’t want to see.
“We shouldn’t split up,” Rogers said, finally.
“I take pride in it, too.” Tony grinned wickedly and returned to his shop, wondering what Fury could want with the two of them, and hypothesizing all any way he could get out of it.
“They’d be the perfect balance.”
Slowly, as though it could spring to life at any moment, Steve went to undo the ribbon, but stopped short, his hand hovering in the air. “Am I seeing things or is my name gone?”
Thanks for reading!
“If you’re planning to kill me and bury my body out here, I feel like you could have picked a better location.” Steve said, moments after joining Tony. A joke? Who would have thought?
Steve flustered, “No! I only—Could you just wait a second? Maybe there’s someone in the back, or we could at least leave a note.”
“That’s not how reverse psychology works.”
It was something Steve failed to realize, apparently: even when he was silent, Steve seemed to be telling Tony he was better than him. No one deserved to be this righteous; war-hero or not.
Bears? Boars? Aliens? The probability of each was unknown.
Steve’s suit had transformed into a stunning sea of dark blue, like the color of confidence or intelligence. A stylish row of shimmering silver buttons ran down the front. Matching threads glistened throughout the suit, weaved through the blue in a elegant wave of pattern. Even the shoes had turned from a dull beige to matching blue suede.
“Was?”
Princess. They tend to like the bad boys.” Tony controlled his temper and gave Steve his best smirk, enjoying the way the man’s nostrils flared with anger.
. Tony turned around and began walking down the path of fine sand that veered to the right. “Then don’t.”
______
Tony let silence answer for him—they both knew this wasn’t their home. He voiced his own concern: “I still don’t understand why we haven’t seen anyone else.”
Two paths cut their way through the vegetation, going in opposite directions.
Steve wiped his face with a towel and slung it around his neck. “Can I have your permission to shower first? Or did Fury give you orders about that too?”
“Howard — I knew Howard.” Steve clarified. As if Tony had another father Steve could have been referring to.
Suddenly Tony became very aware of his crumpled-up t-shirt and the motor oil on his hands and arms that he hadn’t bothered to wipe off.
If this was some kind of game Fury was playing, he’d kill him. He’d kick them all out of the tower too. It had felt like he was flying—both of them had felt it. Could Fury do such a thing? Tony sure as hell hadn’t given him the tech for it.
By that Friday, Tony had lost track of how many hours of sleep he’d gotten—despite it being a frighteningly small number. He was on an autopilot mission to get coffee when he ran into Steve. If he had more energy, he would have blamed Jarvis for not warning him—or maybe Jarvis had told him, but Tony just hadn’t heard him through the fog.
For a moment no one said anything. Fury didn’t have to convince Coulson and Hill of that truth. Coulson had seen it with his own eyes, and Hill was bright enough to understand everything the two of them had told her.
“Tony…” Steve trailed off in exasperated worry, his eyes raking over Tony’s body for injuries and answers, leaving no part untouched. When their eyes met Steve’s latched on to his, looking beneath the skin with troubled blue eyes.
Part of Tony wanted to scream, but another, scarier part of him wanted to laugh hysterically at the sheer lunacy of the day. “Maybe there are, like, tiny people in this world, or something?” His eyes darted to the suit that claimed it could turn the wearer invisible, but it was still there.
“And without Rogers, there’s no order or authority or trust. He’s the guy you know you can fall back on, the one who will keep fighting for what he believes in no matter how slim the odds. But he can be blinded by his own views and out of sync with the complexities of it all.” Hill added, thinking out loud.
Steve’s head snapped up, eyebrows knit in confusion.
“Fine.”
This was it. This would be the help they needed or the enemy they didn’t want to know existed.
A gift.
“Could you at least be proud that I’ve timed my sleep deprivation perfectly?” Tony asked through the phone. He put up with the parenting since Rhodey had to endure far more, but that didn’t mean he didn’t give him shit for it.
Two square cards rested on top of tissue paper.
“You going to watch me undress, Capsicle? Because I don’t mind.” To prove his point, Tony slithered his belt off of him completely.
“Fine?” Clint said slowly, as though saying something too quickly would frighten off Tony’s agreement.
“Half naked holding a can of whip cream that’s been duct-taped to a bottle opener?”
“Are you ever going to tell me what happened?” Steve eventually said when they stopped, after the dirt path had transformed into a firmer road paved with prismatic, glittering, stones. The cobbled road stretched farther than the eye could see—disappearing into the towering gates that pressed into the sky.
“No.” Steve had stood up now and was brushing leaves from his clothes. “Should I remember something? What did you do?”
your hearing.”
“Get me in the shop when you’re done.” Tony turned to leave.
For now, he’d play the part, listening and nodding like a good team player. As Fury droned on and Jarvis chipped away at SHEILD security, Tony started on puzzling out the team.
“Jarvis broadcasts, he’s not an upload. No Jarvis; no Earth. There’s no other explanation.”
Steve didn’t look any more certain.
“My father, you mean.”
He was a sinfully beautiful man. Bright blue eyes in the shade of desires and dreams sat on either side of a perfect nose. Could noses even be attractive? His was definitely the most attractive nose Tony had ever seen. The man’s blonde hair looked as if nothing softer could exist on earth. His biceps were bigger than Tony’s own head, for God’s sake.
Tony jerked around, still gripping the suit. “If I’m being completely honest, I don’t see how that’s relevant right now.” Who in their right mind would be concerned about thievery while they were stranded on an alien planet?
The man ushered them inside the gate, closing the giant doors behind them. They had entered into a giant garden that spread out before them in a vegetative fantasy. Glowing bugs and plants sparkled against the dark sky and their light danced on the vibrant colors of exotic flowers.
“You could be doing the same.”
“It’s wrong.”
“I take it back,” Tony grinned, “I’m definitely jealous.”
“Sounds like you’re a great host.” Rhodey chided him.
Had he thought falling asleep outside was a brilliant idea? How had he gotten to the forest at all? How long had he been lying there?
“Let’s just hope they’re all at that game.”
“What about the best friend discount?” Rhodey asked incredulously.
Tony turned back to Fury, ignoring Steve’s comment. “It’s not happening, Nick.”
“Do we really need to go over it again? Fury wanted us here, yeah?
“I’ll be honest, I’m not that thrilled with the idea either,” Nat confirmed.
They walked quickly, Tony having to take giant steps to keep up with Steve’s breakneck pace. They reached the gate just in time.
No option was never an option.
I'm not really happy with this chapter, but I wanted to get something up. There will be more action soon, I promise!
The admission must have shocked Steve, since he was no longer looking at him like he was crazy. It was always disconcerting when someone who always had an answer had nothing to say, like the knowledge they once had held so tightly to had broken free, slipping out into the world and breaking away into a million pieces.
The suit fit perfectly, as if tailored specifically for him—and it probably was. Gven everything that had happened here, it wouldn’t be surprising. The deep maroon emphasized his dark eyes and gave color to his face. The tail of the coat elongated his torso and gave him the illusion of height which he sorely lacked.
He should have listened to Pepper. He should have abandoned the suits, dismissed the Avengers and gone with Pepper. Why did he have to care about Iron Man so much? Why couldn’t he just have gone with Pepper and accepted that he couldn’t change things that were out of his control.
The shore was a blurry mix of greens and tans, but he could tell it wasn’t too far away. He didn’t move towards it. He wasn’t really there.
“Tool.” Steve muttered, when he had caught up to Tony.
Tony looked at the invitations, golden writing glistened on the back of more green paper.
Tony had slept with enough men to know that anything said by a them right after they woke up next to you could not be believed at all.
And then there was only darkness.
Steve agreed and they set off, reluctantly leaving the warmth of the shop for the night’s chill. The stars hung like jewels in the sky, shimmering brighter than anything Tony had seen before. It was otherworldly, but it brought calmness to his mind.
The drab, colorless beige suit resembled a sack of potatoes, and Tony said as much, earning him a sharp look from Steve. “Guess I can’t be hurt I didn’t get a gift anymore.”
“There!” Steve pointed down the road, reading a sign that was farther away than any normal man’s vision could see. “Falon’s Formal Wear. Sign says
For once, Tony knew Steve’s words weren’t meant as an insult. The soldier was just trying to figure out their situation, and Tony couldn’t blame him.
Tony gave her his most vicious glare. She looked at him like a raptor determining whether to eat a helpless mouse.
“I don’t see him.”
One angry hot shower and two steaming cups of coffee later, Tony found himself stepping into a dimly lit SHEILD meeting-room full of Avengers seated around a conference table. It was an unsettling sight: the walls were the color of whispered secrets and double agents and the edges of the glass table gleamed razor sharp.
“Yeah, kind of.” Tony let out a bitter laugh. “Think of your laptop, tv, or whatever. It doesn’t have the shows downloaded onto it. You need to be connected to the signal to access the programs.”
“Let’s get it over with,” Fury nodded at them. Their reports on the Avengers Initiative had been nothing but a headache for him the last two weeks, but if they could pull it off it would be worth all of his suffering.
Clint answered Fury with a carefree shrug, walking forward to the end of the table. “Are you asking if we actually want to join you? Because I can give you my honest answer. Coulson and I have been working on this honesty thing.” Clint put his right hand over his heart and raised his left, “I solemnly swear that I am —”
“Thrimilci, of course!” She worried her lip, “But it couldn’t have begun yet, it’s not supposed to start until nightfall.”
Tony told himself he needed to escape before Steve woke. But he quickly dismissed that too, realizing that only one car was waiting for them, parked near that abandoned field. Tony liked to irritate Steve but stranding Steve out here would be cruel, and Tony despised cruelty.
The man grinned wolfishly and exited back out of the gates, leaving Steve’s question lingering in the air. They turned around and began walking.
“Clearly.”
If so, Tony could think of
Tony looked away from that one quickly. “I think the cold is starting to screw with my vision.” His words came out sounding shaken and far away.
“I know enough.”
This had to be Clint Barton, the hawk-eyed archer—and Natasha’s partner in crime. If Tony wanted to make it through this team alive, it’d would be good to have someone like him on his side.
probably for as long as I plan to work.” He met her grin with his own lazy smirk. “It’s going to be a while, but it’s not hiding.”
The look Steve gave him was threatening and scary.
Tony found the cup three cabinets down from where it should have been, and turned to make the pot of coffee. He was stopped mid-turn by a mini-panic attack, startled by Steve’s presence at the counter.
Now, a surprisingly comfortable silence filled the room, each man occupied with their coffee and staring into space in silence.
“I don’t understand.”
“Jarvis,” Tony finally bit out.
A headache pounded against Tony’s brain like fireworks in his head. He popped another pill in his mouth, swallowing it dry, the fourth one today. It left a bad taste in his mouth but he didn’t stop to chase it down with water.
The guard cleared his throat, recapturing Tony and Steve’s focus.
To be fair to Pepper, there probably was a smell, but Tony had learned to love it—the synthetic smell of motor oil and the metallic tang of copper wire mixed with the heat of blow torches and sourness of sweat.
He closed his eyes and slowed his breathing.
Steve shook his head, “We checked every inch of this store—there is no way we missed someone. And I would have heard the door open.”
Water kept pouring over his face. Over and over, it filled his mouth, tinged with the metallic twang of blood.
Please leave comments and kudos! I'd be really interested to have comments on what people like/don't like about my writing style!!
“It was good time!”
“Are you crazy? We don’t know what it is,” Steve reasoned, his eyes searching Tony for any indication of sanity. “We don’t even know how it got here.”
The only sound was the crackling fireplace as they both stared at it. It was certainly something to behold—nothing at all what either of them had thought it would look like.
The guard’s eyes went wide: “You two are the guests I’ve been hearing about, then? I recognize the names!”
And it seemed like that’s all they were going to be doing for a
“That’s the bad news.” Steve agreed.
Tony swung his arms violently, grappling for anything to cling on to but grasping only air. His stomach hit his throat as the world turned into a blur of color.
More time passed in silence. What were they supposed to say to each other? Falling into a foreign world hadn’t changed the fact that they had nothing but animosity between them. Besides, Tony was too busy worrying over the fact that he didn’t have his suits here to care about much more.
Tony looked down at the invitations, where now only two words were written on them, the same on each:
“I fell.” Tony explained, lamely.
His eyes caught on the fireplace blazing at the side of the room. Tony’s feet stumbled over each other as he practically ran to the fire: the cold had reached his bones and his teeth were chattering.
“I can take care of myself.” Tony’s voice was hard and low, a mix between a threat and a promise.
Tony opened his eyes slowly and was shocked all over again by Steve’s presence. This had been the longest they’d ever been in a room together—each one usually finding ways to avoid each other or storming off in frustration after seconds of interaction.
“And I need to stay alive, Tony. It doesn’t matter where the hell you are if you’re dead!”
“If you really think I knocked you out, dragged you to the middle of a forest and planted myself beside you—just to lie in the dirt until you woke up—you’re way more dense than I gave you credit for. Impressive, really.”
A muscle ticked in Steve’s jaw, betraying his anger. “That’s my friend you’re talking about.” His voice was low.
“In the shop.” Rhodey finished for him, disapproval in his tone. Was there ever a time it wasn’t there?
Until he wasn’t.
“People generally don’t do stuff like that for others, Tones. People generally aren’t that kind.”
“You want to follow her?”
Right. Now wasn’t the time to contemplate Harry Potter. It was a good question. For a man born without any of this technology, Steve was quick. “I designed his server myself—there’s no place on Earth he can’t reach. Jarvis’ back-ups have back-ups.”
the best friend discount!” Tony scoffed. “Just weld another machine gun to your shoulder, I’m sure you’ll find room somewhere.”
They stood in silence, squinting in the sunlight. Steve looked around, slowly turning in a circle with his hands on his hips. Tony searched as far as the computer in his glasses allowed him to see, looking for anything.
Tony had decided a long time ago that he didn’t need to be present at a meeting for someone to tell him where to throw his money. He’d thought Fury had recognized that too.
It wasn’t very hard to avoid people while making it look like you weren’t avoiding them when Jarvis was on your side, Tony thought to himself.
“And what if you’re not as brilliant as you think you are?”
“I was in that foggy haze of autopilot which comes from just the right combination of exhaustion and caffeine when the team showed up. I didn’t have to suffer through any of the awkward meet-your-new-roommates stuff since I crashed right after showing them in,” Tony argued, adding “All your talk about time-management really paid off.”
“I made a few tweaks here and there for each of them, but—”
Tony nodded, motioning for Steve to continue with the unwrapping.
With an exaggerated sigh, Tony dragged himself over to Steve, who was standing near the front table and frowning at a box as though it had personally attacked him. The white package glittered, seeming to attract all of the light in the room. A translucent, deep green ribbon snaked delicately around it.
Tony let out a sigh, “I think you may be using reverse psychology to admit that you need me.”
He looked up and saw everyone staring at them.
“Miss what?” Steve asked.
He rubbed at his chest, desperately trying to gain some warmth, his hand colliding with the smooth metal of the arc reactor. He latched on to it, his waterlogged eyes shooting open.
“What’s a Jarvis?”
He was on the damp ground, feeling far, far away from the bright, weightless thing he’d been back when the colorful light had surrounded him, when wonder, terror and awe had consumed his mind. Tony had reveled in it until it had felt like he was floating.
Both men stared out into the empty field before them.
The man gestured to the paths. “Players to the right, watchers to the left. The game begins at sunset tomorrow night.” He handed the tickets back to Tony. “But you must find your lodgings before daybreak.”
. What do you want?” He didn’t bother hiding the animosity in his voice. He knew why she was here, and he knew how this was going to end—but that didn’t mean he’d make it easy on her.
He lagged behind Steve and ran through equations in his mind, warding off his hostile thoughts. It did no good to consider how much easier everything would have been if he had a suit. Instead, he was nothing. Useless.
With her eyes trained the weapon, she spoke: “I don’t mean any harm! I’m sorry—I’m—I just” She took a breath to collect herself.
“Did you get an invitation as well? Will you watch or play? The prize is a wish this year—isn’t that crazy? Imagine what you could do with a wish! But I’m not sure … I’m almost frightened to play.”
Tony didn’t want to think about that, either. “We should keep moving up this hill. Maybe we can find high ground and get our bearings.”
“I’m not giving you that kind of validation.”
But they went in different directions.
“We understand them too.” Steve was quiet for a moment, and when he spoke again his words were wistful. “Maybe we’re still on Earth?”
“You don’t remember anything?” Tony swallowed hard.
He couldn’t be in Afghanistan. He couldn’t. There wasn’t a car battery attached to him; the sand under his knees and the breeze in the wind were not found in the cave. It was just a flashback
Tony looked around to find something that would fit him. His choices were limited to extravagant variations on suits and tuxes that were all stunning. One in a heavy glass box claimed it could turn the wearer invisible. On a better day, Tony’s curiosity would have gotten the best of him, but instead he grabbed a suit near to him and the fire.
Steve’s face scrunched in concern and he worried his bottom lip. “I don’t know. But I don’t think we should open it.”
“It’s better than nothing.”
“What happened? Jesus, Tony. Are you okay?” Steve looked deathly pale, and Tony imagined he didn’t look much better. “God, I was so worried.”
Clint seemed an eager participant, luckily.
“I don’t know. The light—maybe?”
Tony snorted softly. Clint was absurd—in an oddly charming sort of way.
“I’m surrounded by idiots,” Fury muttered.
Hope you enjoy the chapter! Please leave comments or kudos, I'd love to discuss things with you all!
“Fury’s right.” Steve said, in a commanding voice that irritated Tony more than it should have. “If we’re going to fight together as a team, then we should know each other as a team.”
Fury ran his hand down the back of his head. “They have a leader.”
“I don’t know, its … I saw this rainbow of colors, so bright I thought it would burn me. Loud as all heck.” Steve spun around, his blue eyes searching. “I swear I felt like I was flying. It sounds crazy, I know, but—”
The shop was a spacious rectangle of sharp corners, sleek designs and dark reflective colors. Tony thought it was by far the best room of the tower, though Pepper had always seemed to dislike it. Whenever she had entered, her nose scrunched up like she’d caught a nauseating smell.
“Do you have the 4 million on you now, or…”
A small part of this dialogue is from a comic book; those words are not my own (the ones involving rhodey’s suit) and I do not take credit for them as my own.
“They can’t even stand being in the same room.” Coulson laughed ruefully.
The footsteps grew louder, and a tall, lean girl jumped from the shadows, skidding to a stop. Her eyes landed on Steve’s spear and her mouth parted in a squeak of surprised fear.
“Rogers is a man out of time—and I’m not saying that he has no clue how to operate in the 21
The corner of Steve’s mouth quirked up, as if daring Tony to test out what other strengths the soldier had. A frightening desire within him wanted to take the dare.
Tony was a man of logic. Science and math; numbers and equations. Everything had an explanation, even if it was an undiscovered one. They were on another planet—all the evidence pointed to it—but that didn’t mean he knew what the hell was going on.
“I don’t know, Rogers. Someone clearly went through a lot of trouble to give you that gift.” Tony’s hands drummed on his side. “You don’t want to piss off the aliens.” It was a poor attempt at a joke, and the tilted smile he gave Steve melted quickly at the soldier’s funny look.
Fury’s argument was more reasonable that Tony cared to admit—in fact, it was similar to the reason he kept building so many suits. But so what if Fury
(See the end of the chapter for
“Invitations,” Tony breathed out.
“Neither,” Fury grinned. “I’m going to make a long-distance call.”
Sudden anger washed over Tony, hardening his vision. Why the hell did things like this keep happening to him? Was there some great cosmic plan with the only goal of screwing Tony Stark?
Still, he sipped at the drink, formulating a response. What was he supposed to say
Hi all! This is a pretty short chapter, but it sets up everything to come.
“That I wanted to test gravity?”
“We can both change facing each other too,” Tony grinned, taking far too much satisfaction n the way the tips of Steve’s ears matched his pink cheeks.
Tony swallowed hard.
“Stark.” Fury mused, admiration and irritation for the man always warred with each other when the genius idiot was brought up.
A terrible sound shrieked through the air, obliterating Steve’s sentence. In an instant, Tony’s world was drenched in the brightest light he had ever seen. He felt weightless as a multitude of colors raced around him. The sharp, deafening noise hammered its way into all of his senses; everything crackled with howling electricity.
Tony blinked hard.
Tony couldn’t help but smirk. Any man that could put that look of exasperation on Fury’s face was a friend of his. He and Clint would get a long just fine.
“Don’t worry, I’ll save the whip cream and can openers for when you’re around.” Tony assured him as a goodbye.
“Because hope is always a practical plan of attack.” Tony muttered to himself.
Tony couldn’t help but wonder, did a super soldier sweat more or less than the average human? What about the smell? He slammed a wall down before his mind could push further. Experiments like that always got him in trouble.
He wanted best Steve. To prove him wrong. But there was only one way to do that.
“I want to be practical,” Fury corrected him. “Some
“Magician?” The girl was speaking so fast, it rivaled even the way Tony spoke when ramped up on caffeine. Neither Steve nor Tony knew what was going on, but maybe he had heard her wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
Magic? Dreams? Though he had been joking about magic before,  the speech had suddenly made everything seem all very real. He had the horrible feeling that he was entering a game like Jumanji, though he had been given no guarantee of pieces being reset at the end.
Tony kept walking.
Tony’s anger bubbled within him. “Do what you want to do, Rogers. I’m playing. I’m winning. And I’m going home.” His eyes narrowed. “With or without you.”
Tony glared at Steve’s side. “You shouldn’t be allowed to comment on anything that someone without super hearing wouldn’t hear.”
There was a bit of green in them, Tony realized, making them a much prettier color than the water he’d just swan-dived into. “What happened?”
Tony slid into the slacks and went to retrieve the matching socks and shoes from by the fireplace. In the process, he caught sight of his reflection in a long, elegant mirror at the end of the room.
“You don’t have to wait for me. I can get there myself.”
He opted for something less bitter: “Smart guy, huh.” It was a good response, Tony congratulated himself again, it didn’t forward the conversation, but it included nothing angsty or bitter at all.
if I don’t think throwing you narcissistic, chaotic solo-acts together at the last minute, when some maniac decides to threaten our world, is the best idea.”
The sun was getting lower in the sky, signaling it was the late afternoon. Sunlight peeked through the trees, mocking them in a joyful dance among a never-ending stage branches and leaves.
“Stop!” he cried out, praying someone would understand him. “Please—I don’t—Help!”
“That’s because every time I invite you somewhere, I end up drunk or with a random girl, or —”
Fury raised an eyebrow.
“Glad you’re finally joining us” Fury said dully as Tony entered the room, stepping right into the director’s piercing gaze. It didn’t sound like Fury was glad at all, really.
Tony watched as Steve shot up from the ground when his mind caught up to his senses.
She ignored him.
“Tony.” Nat warned, for whose safety he couldn’t tell.
Tony stiffened.
“It’s got some character,” Tony sniffed.
Slowly, he opened his eyes. “I don’t know where we are, Steve. I don’t know.” The panic attack made it hard to be ashamed of the crack in his voice.
Tony really tried to hold back his laughter, but he blamed his fatigue for failing miserably. “Are you joking Rogers? No? Wow.” Tony grinned wolfishly, “Just pull up a YouTube video or Google it. Better yet I’ll go put on the suit. Or did you forget that I’m kind of leading the industry in flying machinery?”
Steve’s eyes furrowed together in confusion.
Natasha’s unexpected visit caught him off guard. Of course, everything about her was designed to be unexpected. “Who said you could let her in, J?” Tony asked.
Steve was looking at him with wide eyes and a furrowed brow. “Tony, you’re acting crazy.”
“I knew your father.”
Please leave comments and kudos!! Thanks for reading!
Steve ignored the jab, though anger flashed in his eyes. “You’re being reckless Tony. Could you at least think about it, before you go rushing off and fall down another cliff?” Steve’s eyes narrowed accusingly at him.
“For the sake of us all,” Tony scrunched up his nose in exaggeration, “Take a shower first.” He gave himself a point when Steve’s face pinch up irritation. He’d begun to make a game out of it, trying his best to get the worst looks he could from Steve, and awarding points when he did.
With another groan, Steve stretched beside him. His large hand landed on Tony’s lower back, warm and firm, and far more tempting than it should have been.
“What is he talking about?” Steve asked, clueless.
A touch of color filled Steve’s cheeks.
“What happened?”
Tony and Steve looked at each other, too stunned to speak just yet. Apparently, he had been foolish to think things couldn’t get any more perplexing.
Her fiery hair caught the sunbeams of the workshop and her coal-black eyes latched on to his. “It’s unfortunate for you, but I don’t operate based on your plans. I may have disapproved of your position on the team, but Fury wants you there.”
Hill met his gaze straight on as she always did, undaunted. “I’m not sure if it’s the best idea to have a leader who might not know where he’s supposed to lead. Or who believes so whole-heartedly in something that he can’t see the complexities of the other side.
“Nowhere,” Steve answered. Because that made sense. “It just showed up. It wasn’t here and then when I turned around, it was.”
Tony had grown comfortable with the arc reactor in his chest and the scars that littered his body, but Steve would want to ask questions.
long time. They had to have been walking for over two hours, neither of them daring to say what they were both thinking: Either they had picked the wrong direction, or Tony was right, and they had much bigger problems than being late for a meeting with Fury.
suit is great, of course. But when am I going to get those updates you were telling me about?” Rhodey questioned slyly.
“Where’d you find that?” Tony asked.
He hadn’t.
No matter how much practice he’d had, Tony could never get his carefree smile to hide the violent fire in his eyes. It had gotten him in trouble on more occasions than he’d cared to admit. Fury’s lip twitched as he met Tony’s telling gaze, but he didn’t flinch.
“We could do worse for shelter.” Tony half-heartedly tried to a joke.
playing, really. It seemed as though his life was one big game after another, and this was no different. He was just playing for higher stakes now. Tony nodded, “Maybe this Magician guy will help us get home. And out here, what are we going to eat? Where would we sleep? How would we pay for anything? I don’t really see any other options.”
Astonishingly, Steve kept going: “He was such a great guy — even though at first I wasn’t sure if he actually wanted to be my pal or if he was just interested in the science part, you know? And man, he sure loved the science. Did you know that he made a car actually fly? Somehow the wheels just turned and I don’t even know what happened next. That was before I actually knew —”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hey everyone!! School has started so posting might become a bit irregular (I hope not though).
Tony trailed off at Steve’s glare, pulling at the stiff, soaked fabric around his legs. His jeans clung to him like soggy cardboard, threatening to chafe in all the wrong places as they started walking. He stifled his shivering, running through equations in his mind to block out the cold as they continued their seemingly endless walking.
That was the wrong question, Tony wanted to say, but it came out as a garbled choking sound. His vison swam and he sank to the ground, shoving his head into his callused palms.
The name of where they had to go before morning came, apparently.
A fog had clouded his mind and vision, washing out the color of the room; his voice seemed farther away than it should have. He needed to get out of there. “Call me if, you know, you need anything else.”
He let out a tense breath moments later when he heard Steve’s footsteps behind him.
“I’ll wait for you in the common room. But shower first,” Natasha turned to slip away up the stairs, feeling kind enough to leave him with another order. She scrunched her nose. “This whole place reeks.”
Like everything Steve did, even asleep, he was good with his hands. He idly ran his fingers up Tony’s spine to his neck, lazily digging into his hair just enough to make his back arch. The old soldier was clearly more experienced than Tony had pegged him to be.
“You always cling to things.”
“I love those rims,” Clint added in adoration.
“At least I’ll have a fair fight in a game. And no one we’ve met so far has been any threat to us, or did you forget that it was you who raised a spear to a girl in the woods?”
The beginning is heavily influenced by Stephanie Garber's Caravel, and if you enjoy it credit her not me. If you hate it, credit me, not her.
“Where are you taking us?” Steve wore the frown that his face seemed to permanently exist in. Maybe Tony’s mother had been telling the truth when she’d said faces could get stuck after scowling for too long.
Three weeks went by in three excruciatingly short seconds. Between renovating the penthouse and designing company projects, Tony’s work on the suits had been dramatically underwhelming. Late nights had become even more sacred to him during those weeks. The vacuous sound of empty rooms and corridors was his music, the hiss of a blow torch and the sharp clangs of metal his prayers.
Tony heard his name again, and this time the voice was familiar, filling him with a bit of much needed warmth.
“Are you sure about this Tony?” Bruce asked, though his eyes showed that he knew there was no way out for Tony now. It was kind of him to ask, at least.
As he walked out the door, Tony thought he should have felt triumphant that he’d been able to render Captain America speechless and proven him wrong in their first encounter. But instead, Tony sensed that this meeting had gone exactly the way Nick Fury had intended it to—and that was somehow the worst of it all.
“Thrimilici?”
“Try harder Rhodes. As insults goes, that’s pretty lame.”
“Was this Fury’s idea, then?” Steve redirected his anger.
rolledhis eyes.
“Hey—tell me about your new roommates,” Rhodey quickly added, knowing Tony wasn’t one to discuss heartfelt feelings. “They’ve been there two weeks now?”
“I’d be pretty stupid to be discontent; don’t you think? Ungrateful, even.” Tony kept his voice light despite the weight in his chest.
“That’s not the answer I’m looking for.” Fury said with irritating calm, like he had already won.
“I don’t understand.” Steve had whipped out his phone, hoping to prove Tony wrong with a simple phone call and being let down. It was only going to get worse from here.
It was just a pair of glasses, sure, but his work was a part of him—and one of the most vulnerable, unfortunately. Pepper always had called his inventions his children, and Pepper was always right.
“Well either Fury wanted us to bond over how pointless this was, or you’re horrible at practical jokes, but—”
He wasn’t just Tony Stark now: he was Iron Man. But the past had claws and it fought to stay alive.
“You want to play?” Worry tinged Steve’s expression, drawing his brows into a frown.
“Tony what’s happening?”
Manipulation, then.
“You’re always off having all the fun without me,” Tony whined.
After combining their survival knowledge—which was impressively inadequate for how many people called them superheroes—and scanning for moss and sides of trees with overgrowth—which was unshockingly less than helpful—they had made their best guess at south. Marching in that direction, Tony tried his best to not think.
Natasha ignored him, leaning back against the doorframe and looking all too comfortable in Tony’s space. “I see you’re not at all hung up on the consultant bit.”
“Or the perfect disaster.”
“Is that a jingle you came up with? The Avenger’s motto, maybe?” Tony scoffed. “Of course you’d agree, Capsicle. Do you even have a home, or do you just live in a laboratory?”
He leaned against a tree, resting his head on the sharp bark. Spots swam in front of his eyes and his heartbeat raced.
He had really thought that they’d had a mutual agreement that it was too late for words.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him, “No clue. But I know I want to be inside by nightfall.” His eyes darted around, landing on the hidden pathway the girl had taken.
Tony could think of a lot of things about showers and permission right now, but none of them involved Fury. He pushed the images out of his head, along with a theory that began to for in his mind. Science was always getting him in trouble.
Coulson and Fury turned from Clint and looked at Tony expectantly, as if he were holding some kind of answer. He always had answers, but they were never the kind guys like Fury wanted. He opened his mouth to speak, but was stopped short.
Coulson spoke first: “Rogers is a better choice than handing the team to a guy who might understand the complexities of the world better, but doesn’t think of the consequences.”
do? How on earth could this be something I did? You weren’t the only one who woke up not remembering anything!”
“I could never keep up with him, he was always working on so many projects at once. In the same month he’d have traveled all over — different states, different countries. And he taught me all about, uh —
Steve shook his head, but he didn’t disagree—neither of them knew what they were dealing with. The soldier stepped closer, squinting at the package. A vein in his neck popped outward and his face paled.
It wasn’t that he didn’t know how poisonous these thoughts were. Tony knew that his goals were impractical—there was no way he could fix everything that he had done. But what kind of man would he be if he didn’t try?
Tony didn’t know if his fatigue or the cold was making him hallucinate—it wouldn’t have been the first time—but on top of unnerving stillness, the shop signs didn’t make any sense.
Steve gave a sideways look to Tony, who shrugged, nodding to the man, “We sure are.” He put on his flashiest smile, “You wouldn’t know where he is, would you? Could you point us in the direction?” Maybe they could skip the game and go straight home.
Tony felt his lip curl up in a sneer as Steve looked at him with anger and disgust.
Please leave comments and kudos! If I sound desperate, it's because I am. You should feel sorry for me, and then leave me a comment or kudos to make me feel better!
“They have no reason to trust each other,” Coulson agreed. “They have no reason to follow one another, and they have no reason to fight for one another when the time comes for it.”
“I’m sure you can super-boy, but that would be a waste of gas. You don’t want the paparazzi to hear that Captain America doesn’t care about the environment, do you? Bruce may never speak to you again.”
Either way, he didn’t have nearly enough sleep to deal with a super-soldier-sized problem.
Steve groaned in response, flopped to his back, and squinted up at the trees. The hands that had just left Tony’s back tingling were now digging into the dirt around him. “Where are we?”
Fury’s glare pinned them down, looking like a teacher chiding unruly school children. “Would you men like to join us?” He sounded like one too.
Tony wondered what it would take to make Steve blow. It seemed as though Steve existed in the middle of nowhere, a pot that had been left to simmer, never getting the cathartic release of a screaming boil but remaining too hot to eat.
He was flying and weightless. He was surrounded by glowing, blinding light.
“I didn’t care about his opinion then, and I sure don’t care about it now.” Tony growled after him. He brushed the mugs into the sink, uncaring if they shattered. The dregs at the bottom dripped like blood down the drain.
Like gasoline to a fire, it told him there was something happening. It was the smell of ingenuity, intensity and creation. It made Tony want to do more.
“This is going to be a great team,” Bruce sighed, leaning back in his chair.
Tony pulled them out of his coat pocket and handed them to the man.
It was twisted, but it was fun—in a mad, death-defying kind of way.
Rhodey pouted through the phone: “I think I need to rethink our friendship,”
Tony’s face fell. How could they ask a man for help if no one knew who he was?
Even when he was silent, Steve seemed to be telling Tony he was better than him. A sinister voice inside of him whispered that Steve was right. Tony’s life had been full of people who had left him behind—all for good reasons.
There was no doubt that Steve had taken one look at him and seen Howard.
It was amazing how much more terrifying falling was when you had been able to fly.
“Besides, if
(See the end of the chapter for
.” Steve chuckled when he said the word, like it was an inside joke, and looked up to see if Tony had understood.
The path that had once been neatly carved into the cliff had become a rough trail as it cut a jagged route down the steep cliff. Boulders, fallen trees and overgrown shrubbery obstructed their way. It seemed as though every ounce of nature was against their journey—and Tony couldn’t disagree.
“Welcome!” A man greeted them with open arms. His luminous white coat gleamed even brighter against his dark, midnight skin, seeming to match the stars up above. “Do you have an invitation?”
A silence swept the room as they both looked to Fury. But he was miles away—planets, actually. A plan had begun to formulate in his mind. It was one that was extremely reckless and more than a little dangerous, but most of his plans were. “Then we’ll just have to get Stark and Rogers to play nice.”
“You can complain to him about favoritism when we get there, Spangles. Let’s go.”
“What are you talking about?” Steve’s voice was pinched, betraying his concern.
Tony pushed him off yet again, “I’m okay—really!” He tried to sound annoyed, but his shivering made him sound much more fragile than anything. He tried giving Steve a lopsided smile, the one he used for getting away with things, “Would you believe me if I said I wanted to go for a swim?”
Tony kicked at a stone, watching as it grew smaller, tumbling to the far away ground and dashing against the rugged terrain of rocks and fallen logs.
Tony followed his vision. A thick expanse of trees stretched to all sides, surrounding them in a blanket of deep green that faded to a harrowing sea of shadows. The sky told him that they’d been unconscious for far too long. They must have wandered deeper into the forest than he’d initially thought.
Had Fury really thought this would work? That he could bring Tony in last minute to clean up a mess he couldn’t handle?
Tony’s chest tightened. “What thing?” Had Steve seen it too?
“Wait up,
The guard must have read the disappointment on Tony’s face. “Not to worry,” he said. “Win the game and he’ll grant your wish!”
“It’s good to hear your voice, buddy, it’s been crazy over here,” Rhodey said after a moment.
“Wears ascots, has perfect teeth, you know…”
Now Steve’s eyes were narrowed with concern and confusion, a mixture of troubled thoughts that made his blue irises dark and foreboding, the color of hidden thoughts. It was crazy, how much Tony noticed Steve’s eyes, he knew, but they seemed to hold the only indication that beneath the rigid soldier was an impressionable man.
Steve’s jaw ticked as he weighed his options, and Tony tried his best not to storm off alone. Bust something told him that Steve would cave.
Please leave your comments and kudos!!
Tony wanted to throttle Steve. “What did
Tony hadn’t really thought about
“It’s ugly.” Steve said finally, summing up everything Tony had been thinking.
Steve turned around, looking off into the woods before him. “I don’t know what that thing was, and I just figured it was some type of tech.”
Tony didn’t bother telling Steve that the caffeine would have no effect on the super-soldier since his body would process it too quickly, but that would have required a lot of energy to say. He also might have offered to make a drink that could give him an energy boost, but that would have required him to like Steve.
“You customized their rooms?” Rhodey asked.
“I may have a slight obsession,” Clint joked, gesturing to his attire.
When he hit the surface, water drowned everything, shocking his senses alive. His nose filled with freezing water and his lungs fought to make oxygen out of liquid. Tony’s chest screamed for air as he fought and struggled towards the surface. He swam towards the light, praying that way was up.
Steve stood up, his every move so commanding that space seemed to actively scramble out of his way. The soldiers face was schooled into impassiveness but Tony could sense his surprise, could feel the gears turning in the soldiers mind.
Tony pulled his glasses off of his face, remembering Clint’s comment. He honestly wasn’t sure which pair he’d grabbed in his dismay of leaving the house. The metallic lenses flashed, their dark purple shimmering in the light. The Stark Industry logo was etched faintly on the side into the dark silver metal.
There were diners that claimed to feed your desires sat next to a shop selling plants that guarded homes. Suits of armor and seeds that grew dreams; bags that could fit anything in them and eyeglasses that could see the soul.
Not daring to open his eyes, he groaned and brushed bits of nature from his hair, wishing some of the other memories of earlier that day could be as easily swept away. Everything reeked of pine needles, singed plants, and secrets. His skin itched and crawled, and the only thing worse than the spinning in his head was the twisted soreness in his back and neck. The rims of his sunglasses bit into his cheeks.
“That was one time!” Rhodey groaned miserably.
Followed him where? Hell if he knew.
“Open it.”
“How is this reckless, Rogers? You heard what that girl said. The prize is a wish. If we win, the Magician can get us home. I need to get home.”
Only he could have built a computer like this, Tony chided himself. “Complicated how?”
The deep maroon of the suit flashed in the light of the dancing flames. The coat looked like a mixture of a classic blazer and a classic suit jacket; it tapered at the back into a short tail. The trousers’ cuffs were ribbed, cinching at the ankles. A soft shirt of the same color hung underneath the jacket.
“Ten points to Gryffindor.” Because, let’s be honest, there was no way the sorting hat would even need to touch Steve’s head to paint him a brave lion.
“Whether I like it or not.” Tony could hear Rhodey shake his head. “But quit changing the subject Tones,” Rhodey ordered. “Tell me about the team!”
“That thing is a safety hazard, Tony, and I keep telling you to get rid of it. You’ve had that junk since college, and I swear it’s a different color each time I see it.”
don’t realize what is out there, but I’ve seen it.” He pointed to the sky, his single eye scanning the room. “We
Tony shook his head furiously. Or maybe it was his whole body that was shaking. “You don’t get it. You don’t get it.”
Tony felt like a ping-pong ball, shooting back and forth around his workshop. One minute his hands were manipulating a hologram in the far side of the room, puzzling out how to defend the suit against and EMP, and only a few moments later he was attempting to speed up the suit-up timing in the opposite corner. He was in constant conversation with Jarvis and his bots: directing movements, shouting out orders, talking through ideas.
The door creaked as it swung open, and they stepped into a small store filled with hats and clothing. Fabric in every imaginable color lined one wall, some shimmered like the night sky while others glistened with soft fur.
She radiated relief: “Has it already started? Did I miss it?”
“They need a leader, sir.” Hill elaborated, “You know better than anyone else that these are highly trained and skilled individuals—and that’s all they will be if they don’t have someone acting as a glue.”
“It has my name on it.”
Anger shaded Tony’s thoughts, and he continued to put on the suit. “Do you know how irritating you are?”
“I don’t know, Rogers!” Tony threw his hands in the air, “It doesn’t seem too far-fetched that a place where you can buy bottled dreams also has invisible gift-bearing creatures!”
Tony tried not to flinch at Steve’s accurate description. Hearing it from someone else made it seem frighteningly more real. “I’m fine.” he repeated quickly,” trying to assure himself as much as he was Steve. His attempt was seriously undercut by some delayed coughing up of water.
“Should we risk it? There’s no one down there.” Steve pointed out, squinting as though his more than perfect vision was feeding him false information. “Where is everyone?”
I think it is a very individual decision—and I'm definitely not suggesting that these crooks are undeserving of punishment—but I think it's important to really think about right now. Specifically the relationship between the art and the artist: should we stop watching movies if the lead actor is now a convicted sex offender?
“This isn’t a hotel, Rhodey! I’ve spent too much of my life entertaining and gossiping. I have better things to do now. You know that.”
“We’ve got to get dressed quickly, Rogers. The gates close at midnight—that’s only a few hours away, assuming time works the same way around here.”
Please leave comments or kudos, I'd love to know what you think!
“There’s been a bit of trouble getting approval from all the required departments for the Initiative,” Fury began.
In fact, nature probably had made a law against it, but Howard had just sent a giant ‘fuck you’ to the universe, like always.
“At least we look like them, otherwise that could have gone a bit differently,” Tony offered, in a sad attempt at optimism.
“Fine.” Tony sighed, putting the suit back on the rack. The cold had begun to seep from his bones, but it was replaced by a chilling exhaustion. He fumed to himself as they both looked around the shop for an employee, not surprised when they found the back of the shop as empty as the front.
Tony pushed the spear downward, pointing it away from the girl.
At any moment thoughts of Pepper and her accusations shredded at his heart, while fears of things out of his control snaked around his lungs. He couldn’t build the suits fast enough; he couldn’t fix things completely.
Hill gestured for Coulson to start. “Sir, it appears that nothing has improved. Clint continues to report that there is a complete lack of cohesion among the team.”
Tony took a step forward, taking his time to ensure Fury was fully irritated. “You’re the one that sent Natasha after me, Nick. And why was that, by the way? I thought we were pen pals, but maybe email wasn’t enough for you? I know I’m just irresistible in person, but you could have tried Face Time if you really want to see me.”
She wasn’t wrong—Hill rarely was—and she knew when to speak her mind when it most counted. But even if her concern was valid, who else could lead the Avengers? Fury’s mind buzzed as he searched to find a solution, pushing down the small voice that suggested maybe there wasn’t one.
Steve looked at him and nodded shortly, his jaw set. “This is the same chap that girl mentioned. The Magician.”
One moment his feet pounded against the rugged path, beating the earth into submission; and the next—he wasn’t touching anything.
“That’s stealing.” Steve’s disapproving tone grated in his ears.
“No! I mean yes. Wait.” Steve’s face was a furious shade of red, “Could you ever go easy on me? Just once?”
“The serum didn’t make him perfect. From what I understand, it intensified everything in him—he’s still human, maybe even more so than others.” Hill finished, leaving the room in silence once more.
“I read the important ones.” Tony explained. He stopped and turned to her, “I didn’t think a glorified bonding session sounded very important, did you?”
“Do you realize how horrible this is?” The question burst from his chest, frightening away the silence.
“You don’t know anything about me.” The words sounded strangled, much to his confusion. The arc reactor pressed heavy against his chest. It always seemed bigger when things were getting shitty.
But Tony could see a bit of his father in Steve too: in the expression that Tony had grown up staring into. Disappointment.
I think this chapter brings up a really relevant question about how much we as a society should be willing to forgive. Especially in this era where authors, producers, directors, actors etc. are being exposed we have to decide for ourselves if these are horrible people or normal people who have made horrible mistakes.
He’d known she was planning something, but how could he have guessed this?
The gruff voice was still calling out, but the jumbled mess of foreign sounds had turned into something familiar. The muted sound of his name fought to get past the frigid water that had filled his ears. He clung to the voice, anchoring himself to something familiar instead of the violence in his mind.
Tony blinked hard, taking in the man that had slid up next to him. And what a site to behold. He wore black combat pants and a deep purple tank-top which clung to his body in all the right places, showing off his lethal muscles. One side of his face bore a swollen bruise in a hue that matched his shirt; the other side had a nasty gash on his cheekbone that looked like it was also turning purple.
They all knew he was the only other option. Nat and Clint were out of the question. They’d spent their whole life feeding off of lies and surrounding themselves with isolation. Banner wasn’t reliable, and Fury was keeping information about Thor to himself for now.
So he cranked out updates for the suits—sending software to Rhodey as soon as he could after their conversation, labeling it ‘best friend discount.’ But in between the company, charities and mandated Avengers meetings, the only time he could get to the shop was at late at night.
The soldier stayed silent, processing the Tony’s nonsense. He was more tired than he’d thought he was, Tony realized. But then again, that was usually the case. It was simple to keep going while he was working, but the moment he stopped was the moment he crashed.
Tony blew out a frustrated breath. “Yeah, you’re right. I can think of a lot of worse things than getting stuck on an alien planet,
Tony screwed his eyes tight and struggled to all fours, spitting up water, his body shook violently with cold and shock. How many more days would pass like this?
“What can I say? You make it so easy not to like you.”
much fun.
. I’m talking about after that—when you were acting like I was trying to kill you!”
Nat ignored him and pushed off of the doorframe, walking into his shop and invading his territory like a hunter does to its prey. Apparently, she was done with their verbal sparring and had decided it was time to pull the trigger. It wasn’t a decision Tony was thrilled about.
Tony must have misheard; water was still in his ears, and he was sure Steve had been wishing he would fall off a cliff right before it actually happened. He ignored Steve’s until the man grabbed him by the shoulders, looking him over for injuries.
“Magic?” Steve’s eyes were wide. The blues of his eyes were electrifying, matching his attire.
“All due respect, sir,” Hill spoke up. “He won’t cut it alone.”
Steve brushed past him. “You bother me.”
His limbs prickled painfully with the warmth, but he was still frozen to the bone. Steve had been right: he needed to get out of his clothes.
Steve’s eyes told Tony that the soldier thought he was crazy. But who knew? Maybe he was. “How can that be possible, Tony?”
have a point? Tony
“Because I used Pepper’s access codes.” The room was filled with Natasha’s signature smoky voice, which she had perfected for deceit, espionage and manipulation.
“I told you, Fury wanted to meet with us.” He was being an annoying prick. But it was just
“Beyond even the Skrulls,” Hill reasoned, intuiting what the men were thinking. “Politicians, spies, back-door deals, black markets, media outpouring—it’s impossible to know where anyone stands and who anyone truly is. The line between right and wrong, good and evil—it’s questionable if there even is one.”
It was charming and enchanting, but even more unnaturally still than Steve had noted on the cliff. The shops were closed and their windows dark.
“They were nice pants.” Tony mourned.
“Yes, I
“Why?”
“Shoot one of them?” Coulson guessed.
Some days he didn’t make it to the couch and woke up draped over a table or using a faceplate or shin guard as a helmet. It was better this way, Tony told himself. Working himself to exhaustion maximized hours of productivity and fatigue chased away his dreams at night.
“Why?”
“Because you’ve done such a good job of that already.”
“Do you care about anything else besides you and your suits?” Steve’s words slammed into him, carrying memories of Pepper’s similar accusation.
Tony breathed out a laugh, holding out his glasses. “Here. Take ‘em.”
“Did I not just say that I don’t remember anything?” Tony figured leaving out his hallucination of flying in a magical light tunnel was probably for the best now. Steve already looked at him like he was insane. “I swear, it’s like the serum affected everything
The field was a dusty haze of level ground, baking in the New York sun, which had seemed to bleed the color from the grass, turning it to tarnished gold. The ground was swallowed by a forest of evergreen trees in the distance, their presence looming over the field. The field, which was very much empty.
“I saw it too.” Tony said quietly.
Tony choked—again. “I’m sorry did you just ask me to undress?”
Tony closed his eyes. Maybe he should go to bed—his actual real bed—like Rhodey had told him to. He was a smart guy, that Rhodey, maybe he should listen to him more.
The sun was low in the sky now, and darkness threatened to overcome them. Steve looked at him intensely, with something Tony couldn’t name. His eyes reflected the evening sky. “We should keep moving, or I’m going to freeze.”
The man laughed, a full-bodied sound that implied Tony’s question was the funniest joke he had heard. “No one knows where he is!” the man got out, when he had regained control. “He takes on a new form each game, always working behind the scenes but always right under your nose.”
“You should have done that a long time ago, buddy. You’re in for good now!”
“This isn’t Earth.” Tony repeated, as if that would suddenly enlighten Steve and he wouldn’t have to explain the worst discovery in recent history.  And he’d had some pretty crappy realizations over the years, too.
“Don’t bother. I was insulting you.” Tony spelled it out for him, making his way to the coffee machine. “But you messed that up too,” he concluded, muttering to himself. Exhaustion always removed his filters, and he didn’t bother filtering anything when Steve was around anyways.
“There’s no car Steve. There’s no tower—and thereis no team.”
Tony began kicking off his waterlogged shoes unbuckling his belt but Steve wasn’t moving. Instead, his eyes were darting back and forth between his own bland clothes and Tony’s.
To the right of the table was a man with curly hair. He was folded in on himself, making the large office chair seem to loom over him. Tony couldn’t help but grin.
Tony continued with the update, pleased that Rhodey didn’t press the issue further. “Steve keeps trying to have team dinners ever since he discovered that Bruce was such a good cook, and Clint seems to have an unhealthy obsession with movies and video games, along with the color purple. Movie nights were his brilliant idea. I’ve gotten out of most of it all since I’ve been working in the shop and sleeping—”
“Fury wants to see us.” Tony stood at the door of the gym, ignoring the achingly beautiful way sweat glistened off of Steve’s shirtless, muscular back. Of course his father and the doctor had to pick an already attractive man to get injected with the serum. It was disgustingly unfair that someone so insufferable could be so insufferably beautiful. Nature should have made a law against it.
Not for the first time in the last few months, Tony fought the urge to scream. It was a scary feeling; there was something lurking at the bottom of his chest, pacing back and forth like a caged animal, threatening to claw its way up his throat.
Tension muddled his mind as Tony tried to sort out what to do. He didn’t need to be an Avenger—he didn’t even want to be. What he wanted was to be a better man than he had been. He wanted to be Iron Man and to protect and fix what he loved.
“That’s an understatement,” Tony muttered.
The sharp sound of Tony’s mug hitting the counter finally with a bit too much force put a much-needed end to Steve’s rambling. “Not really a hard thing to do” Tony said, his jaw tight. He should have just gone to bed instead of coming up here. Blue eyes widened.
You wouldn’t
“Real helpful Barton.” Coulson interjected from his place beside Fury, cutting Clint off.
“I wouldn’t do that.” Tony assured him, the corner of his mouth quirking up as he shot Steve a devilish look. “There are much more efficient ways of getting away with murder than this.”
Amid the towering trees and the untamed greens of the forest floor, Tony had flashed open his eyes just long enough to glimpse a golden head of hair, milky skin and a twitching frown.
Tony’s pulse quickened, and his eyes darted around the store. “Is someone here?”
The suits were his best chance at redemption, Pepper not being able to see that didn’t make it not true.
“What are you going to do?” Hill asked.
Tony walked around and tinkered on his various projects, not wanting to give her his full attention. “Little last minute, yeah?”
“Us?” Steve grunted. Even that was hot.
Steve nodded grimly, and for the first time in his life, Tony wished he wasn’t a genius.
“Agent Romanoff is on her way up, sir.” Jarvis informed him.
But now he was face down on the cold, hard forest floor.
“I haven’t gotten nearly enough sleep to deal with your crap right now,
Steve’s fingers stilled.
Steve ignored him, per usual. “Did Fury even tell us to come here?”
“Only if you don’t read your emails.” Nat said.
Or do you not care lol. Just let me know!
He was falling.
“Tony?” A hand pressed into his back, and Tony tried to hold on to the solid weight. “Tony, talk to me,” Steve ordered him. His voice sounded distant against the beat of Tony’s heart.
He looked every part the nerd: thick-rimmed glasses, a tucked in purple button up, unruly hair and a tweed jacket. It was as if he was doing every-thing he could to make the world forget he was the Hulk.
“Figures that difference would matter to you.” Steve stepped closer, “I’ve seen the footage, Stark. Are you worried we’ll mess with your daily routine of getting drunk and sleeping around?”
--------
“I knew you were going to be a backseat driver.”
“I’ve been working so hard not to call you Captain Obvious, but you’re making it extremely difficult.” Tony got out of the car and started walking. Minutes later, the slamming of the passenger door told him Steve had followed.
“Not really. And if you’d recall, he didn’t get it to work. His calculations were sub-par at best and he really should have used a different alloy for the coils.” Tony looked up when he heard a snort. Of course, Steve didn’t understand any of that, but it probably wouldn’t stop him from commenting.
Hi everyone! Its been crazy with midterms, but it is fall break so I am going to write as much as I can — thank you for being patient. There is a welcome to Thrimilici speech here that is taken directly from Caravel, and as usual — almost none of this is mine: the plot, world, characters and more are either Caravel or Marvel's!
“You’re freezing too.” Tony pointed to Steve’s lower half, soaked from when he’d grabbed Tony from the river. “We just need to keep moving,” he said, pretending not to hear the chatter in his own voice.
What Tony saw only enforced the conclusion he’d come to many, many years ago. He did not like Steve Rogers. And if the tick in Steve’s perfectly chiseled jaw was any evidence, the feeling was mutual.
Steve protested: “We can’t be too far from the car. We’ll be at the tower by nightfall and we’ll laugh about it with the team.”
Rhodey hummed his agreement, not sounding like he believed him.
Tony didn’t want to say the words aloud. He didn’t want to taste the awful bitterness that the truth would leave in his mouth. Once he said them, there would be no more pretending.
“But how do you know we aren’t on Earth?” A valid question, though Tony wished Steve would just accept it for what it was. Words were garbled in his throat, trying to force their way back down and away from reality.
Tony struggled to stand up, pushing Steve’s hand away when he reached out to help. “I’m fine. I’m fine.”
“Is it hard, being disliked by everyone?”
without a war.” Anger threatened Tony’s reason, pushing past his jokes and sarcasm. The arc reactor sat heavy in his chest, the same way he always got when people mentioned his past.
He was not alone.
Rhodey didn’t answer right away, most likely on account of the deep voice shouting out commands in the background. A few seconds later his friend told him he had to go. “But try not to get into too much trouble while I’m gone.” Rhodey ordered.
Tony counted that as bonus points.
Natasha’s eyes widened just enough to betray her surprise at his sharp words, yet her voice remained a pleasant tone, “Fury called a meeting for the Avengers. Today.”
After several moments of furious silence, Steve pressed him again: “Well? Did he?”
Steve spoke up, “What happens at daybreak?”
Tony closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair, trying to memorize the way he felt. It wasn’t always like this after talking to Rhodey, especially not on the days that Tony had seriously screwed up, but most of the time bantering with his friend left him light and happy.
Any comfort Tony had been feeling was strangled out of him. The silence was suffocating, replacing the coffee taste in his mouth with vile bitterness.
The corner of Steve’s mouth quirked at the sarcasm. A partial smile? Who knew the soldier could do such a thing.
“I’d like to see you do it, then.” Steve’s hands gripped the cup hard, his knuckles flushing white.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, wanting to end the nightmare.
“Just get over here!”
Steve barreled on: “You put on a suit of iron and think that can somehow change who you are? It doesn’t matter how expensive the suit you wear, you’re still the same war profiteer—”
Tony wondered which she was up to now.
“I don’t even know what the hell happened,” Rhodes complained. “And I still don’t know where my pants ended up.”
“Nope.”
Tony wasn’t competing against anyone—but for the record, he was definitely winning.
“Would someone tell us why you two are staring at each other like you know something we don’t?” Bruce asked hesitantly, his fingers drumming rapidly on the table.
Tony nudged Steve out of the way and picked up the card. Sure enough, it was the same material and ink Steve’s name had been written in. He read it out loud:
“It’s not any tech I’ve ever seen,” Tony admitted. But magic? Tony rubbed at the arc reactor as his mind tried to comprehend what his eyes were seeing. There had to be an explanation—there was no such thing as magic. Tiny mirrors, or multicolored thread, was woven into the suit maybe.
A couch which hunkered in the back-left corner of the room had become his bed, though it had certainly seen better days. It’s upholstery was so stained with coffee, grease and other questionable substances and experiments that the color of the couch was unrecognizable. Now drool joined the mashed-up mess of brown and black stains.
“What’s new …” Tony grinned as he pictured the amused look of disapproval he imagined was on Rhodey’s face.
The soldier’s eyes hardened and he shook his head. “I don’t care how many degrees you have, if you’re not a decent person.” Steve turned and walked away, leaving his coffee behind. “And no matter how smart you are, Howard would be disappointed.”
Tony came to a stop almost halfway into the field, brushing off the stickers that had clung to the legs of his pants with his feet.
Tony sighed, “I’m sorry—I thought—Should we do this again?” Tony pretended to look confused: “Fury wants to see us.”
“Your tech needs to be connected to the server to access Jarvis.” Steve finished, and Tony confirmed with a sad nod. “Okay, I get that.”
If he let it loose would he finally be free and able to breathe? Or would it continue to terrorize him from the outside?
“Don’t you start too, Stark” Fury practically growled.
They bustled down the street in a blur, the prospect of warmth energizing their steps.
Bottled dreams and nightmares were offered in one shop that was perched on top of a particularly scary looking window advertising mirrors that could show the darkness in one’s heart.
Somewhere along the way, Steve had picked up a jagged rock and a sturdy branch. Now, he held a simple spear in his hand, tied together with a piece of vine. He was ready for something, but for what, Tony couldn’t say.
He narrowed his eyes, trying to read her. Nothing this woman did was careless.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Comforting,” Steve muttered.
The cogs cranked away in Fury’s mind.
His lip was split and Tony realized that must have been what he had hit when he was fighting and flailing his arm. The familiar sting of guilt washed over his senses.
Steve took Tony’s response as an invitation to talk more, unfortunately. Maybe his communication device was broken or something?
“There really isn’t that much to say,” Tony tried again,
“We’re not in New York, Steve. I don’t know where we are—but we’re not on Earth.”
“Then we pick a direction and hope we find the car.”
“Get what?”
It shouldn’t be forgotten, Tony knew, though he hated to admit it. He couldn’t change or fix what he had done, but shouldn’t he be able to move forward? Was there some type of redemption test that would allow him to move on, or had he already failed?
Steve broke the silence first: “If we’re in here at night, we’re going to need shelter.”
Steve couldn’t be all that bad, if he liked coffee that much, Tony decided.
“Yeah, but what’s there to tell?” Tony said lazily, ignoring Rhodey’s snort at the question. “I haven’t seen them much, in between work and sleep.”
Hi everyone!! sorry this is so late.
There was just enough foreboding in her voice that Tony wondered if she was threatening him. He didn’t wish to dwell on it long. “I’d extend an invitation for you to move in, but I don’t want to.” It was one of his weaker insults, but to be fair, he was running on only a few hours of crumpled up sleep.
Steve handed them to Tony and pulled out his gift. “It’s a suit.”
A cold chill ran through Tony’s body, reminding him of the time his father had made him sleep outside after finding him in his room with a boy. Tony kept walking; he did not want to sleep under the stars tonight.
Tony stopped, his blood turning red hot as Jarvis spoke in his earpiece. “No, I suppose coercion works better in person.” He laughed, a dry, hollow thing.
Optimism had never been his forte.
more enjoyable ways for him to be screwed—and none of them involved Steve Rogers.
“He’s AI. Artificial Intelligence,” Tony clarified when Steve’s brows knit together. “In the most mundane terms, he’s a computer program that can handle an insane variety and capacity of tasks. He runs everything from programs like security and air-conditioning in the tower to algorithms and experiments in my shop. He operates in the Iron Man suits.”
Things are starting to happen—which means cliff hangers!!
Steve nodded his agreement. “You need to get out of those clothes.”
“He didn’t call me.” Steve panted after finishing a brutal combination on an abused heavy bag.
Clint looked at him like he was offering up his first-born child: eyes wide and mouth parted. He spoke with grave sincerity: “Nat might kill me, but you’re officially my favorite on the team.”
Tony sighed, “Don’t tell me you’ve come all this way just to watch, Rogers? Didn’t we already go over this?”
“Argh.” Someone grunted the not-quite-satisfied sound of a person on the verge of waking up.
. “They’re easy going enough, I guess. They made a big deal out of their rooms.”
Thank you to everyone leaving comments and kudos—Its so wonderful knowing that people are enjoying the work!
“That is the less favorable option, yes.” Tony raised an eyebrow, “How do you know that your way won’t get you killed either? You could be walking into a den of aliens who want to eat your brains.”
“You know I do this kind of thing all the time—it’s not that special.” Tony really hadn’t done much. He was a mechanic: he designed, invented and created for a living and a hobby.
She was clever, but not in the nice way. It reminded him of his father—the way Howard would use Tony as a show piece, pretending that Tony was his world when they were around other people, then throwing him aside like a used machine as soon as they turned their backs.
“Probably because they know something we don’t.” A grim voice rang out like thunder, breaking Tony’s gaze at Fury. His eyes flicked to the one corner of the room he had tried his best to ignore until now.
“I see it too,” Steve’s voice was quiet, probably trying to decide if the shop signs spoke truth or not. Tony was trying to determine the same, and the possibilities prickled at the back of his neck.
