Then he realized that he was alone in an interrogation room with Captain America. He tried to get his heart to calm down. He really needed to work on that. If he was seeing a doctor about his heart, his doctor would be prescribing him all sorts of things like meditation and quitting SI. It was alright, he was alright. He could thank his childhood hero for saving him and then walk out of this room any time he wanted to. Nothing was holding him back. Not a thing.
“Oh, that thing?” Steve laughed, putting the cookies in their appropriate places. “Does that mean you want to watch it again, Tasha?”
Hopefully it wouldn’t take them this long to cool down after a fight. God, he wasted so much time being bitter and just as narrow-minded as the lord and ladies who stared at him when he initially knocked on the front door not even fifteen minutes ago.
“So, J, got any info on where this terminal is? And what the credentials are? Find me multiple ones so we got options. I want the person we frame to actually be in the building when we do this. No room for error.”
Steve was starting to blush, wringing a rag in his hands. “You always come in early, around eight thirty, not long after the morning rush. The afternoons are more random, but I didn’t see you at all this week.”
Peter’s eyes darted away for a moment. “Yes? It’s really hard to concentrate and remember things sometimes. I try, and my dad has been helping a lot, but—it’s hard!”
Tony blinked and then frowned deeply at the tall, burly man before him. The room he was in was empty and basic, save for a table and some chairs. What sent a chill down Tony’s spine was seeing the skull-and-octopus on the wall and the man’s uniform.
“Do I need to make a bouquet?” Tony asked quietly. “And attach the meanings of every flower to it? Do I need to shout it from the tops of the Tower? I could write odes about you. How much I love how fierce you are? How even though you look like a breeze can break you, nothing actually does? How perfectly you fit in my arms, how much I love that you end up holding me when we wake up? How much your beauty surpasses even the most loveliest of beings from classical paintings and sculptures? How little I care for those buxom beauties or proportionally perfect fabrications?”
He remembered Peter’s mother. Dates matched up. Her pregnancy had to have been an accident, a fluke. Condoms weren’t always successful. But why she didn’t contact him again—or had she and his father send her away? Did she not want Tony in her life anymore than he already had been? If that was the reason, he didn’t blame her, but child support! He would have agreed to that!
Maybe he could reduce the power needed for those guys, redirect it to other areas, like an underwater life support system and if he’s going to really be flying, he needs to make sure that it can withstand the temperatures up there …
“Hey, it got us together,” Steve said. “Who knows how long we would have danced around each other without the threat of apparent death by flower petals?”
So, no one else knew how he survived. No one else knew about the arc reactor in his chest or how he was developing better versions of it
Pepper glanced over at the cake sitting on a stand, obviously fresh from the oven. “It looks like apple cake if you ask me.”
They came to a row of windows, giving them what normally would have been a lovely view of the city around them. The blueprints he looked up before he made his escape only told him so much, but that view confirmed his suspicions.
He racked his brain for more information, but it looked like the delirium that he was in and out of prevented him from doing basic cognitive functions. God, this was not how today was supposed to go
So, it was pointed out to me that I didn’t really explain what happened in the previous chapter by Trez26 … Well, I guess it was a good thing, because here’s the continuation! Enjoy!
Tony noticed Peter’s leg was jumping up and down as Happy drove them to the school shortly after five in the evening. Normally, they would be going to the school at this time for some sort of extracurricular activity, like robotics club or some sort of competition. Peter would still be fidgeting, slightly anxious, but it would be born out of excitement. Eager anticipation.
Steve looked up from him then, using his finger as a temporary bookmark. However, instead of having a contemplative look on his face, he almost had a pout.
He might not have known about Peter until he was about ten years old, he might have been considered an ‘irresponsible parent’ and ‘unfit’ to raise a child, but dammit, he proved them wrong! He got custody of him and found his biological aunt and uncle! He made sure to involve them in Peter’s life! He got him into a good school, made sure he had a routine, and he was not going to let some … some …
“We still saving up money to send them on a honeymoon someday?” Steve asked. “Or have we moved that up to when Betty graduates and can move out?”
Tony laughed and swatted his shoulder. “That’s still me, not you! Besides, you said yes. Now look where we are. I don’t think we would have this if we weren’t friends first. We might have gone months before we properly crossed paths.”
“Sir, I found the computer that is the source of many of the communications,” JARVIS said one evening.
Captain America rolled his eyes and informed someone else of the change of plans through an ear piece. Once he was finished with the call, he waved his hand to follow him down a hallway.
Mr. Rogers stood and Tony quickly did the same, though he stepped closer to Peter and put his hand on his shoulder. Peter automatically leaned into him and Tony still felt his heart swell every time he did that. Most kids, after learning about who their absentee father was, would be leery of them, especially after being shuffled around in the foster system. Peter, however? He acted like Tony was the best thing that happened to him, like Tony had never screwed up once in his life.
Bucky shook his head. “No. This hit him like a train. Pretty sure it’s not the flu, because we made sure to get our shots early.”
Bruce sighed deeply while looking at the ceiling and then turned the tea kettle off. “You’ll have to forgive me, but I’m going back to bed. It’s too late in the morning to deal with something out of a Disney movie.”
“Okay, okay, maybe not everyone,” he amended. “But it might be a good idea to let us give you some water bottles and vitamins. Maybe some soup. When have you last eaten?”
Slipping his shade over his eyes, he pushed himself away from the meeting table and stood up. Everyone else, all dressed in dark suits like it was someone’s funeral, looked away from the extremely
He also saw that Steve had a mole on one cheek, right near the center of it, but on the other side, another mole was closer to his jaw. There were some more on his neck, following the lines of his throat. God, Tony wanted to—
“They’re fine! I got them right—” The man made a noise of dismay when he saw one of the paintings had some smudges of dark oil on them. It was a landscape, featuring a number of trees and a meadow. “I am so sorry.”
There would not be silence for long, Steve knew. Silence meant Tony was thinking and Tony tended to put his thoughts into action sooner than later.
belong to him, he rolled up his sleeves and started to tackle the kitchen. It was kind of a mess—his mess from earlier that day. Oh well. He was still far from a stereotypical homemaker, but at least they wouldn’t have to worry about unloading the dishwasher or stepping into something horrifyingly mysterious in their socks when they all managed to come back home at ungodly hours.
Steve started talking about how his art was finally taking off, glad that vintage styles were finally coming back into style and people were appreciating his historical references.
where the police ignored a panicked person on their emergency channel. There was clear evidence that something was going down.
“Pepper, I am offended, wounded. Fresh air is important! Didn’t they come out with a study recently about getting two hours of fresh air improved people’s lives?”
The sniper was silent for a moment. It was kind of creepy, not being able to see his expression, but Tony had a feeling he was weighing their options. Tony was as well, but with so many variables, it was hard to pinpoint if they could get to the roof safely.
“It’ll be okay,” Tony said, looking over his shoulder at Peter, who was clearly worrying himself into an early grave. He reached over and took his hand, stopping Peter from picking his nails. “We’ll go in there, see what your teacher has to say, and sue the school if we have to.”
Steve still tossed some water on him when Tony revealed that he recorded the entire conversation where Steve’s accent and slang came out more than usual. A classmate, who was putting on a production of
He walked up to him and extended his hand. “Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Emphasis on philanthropist.”
“There’s nothing wrong with having a disability or being different,” Mr. Rogers said, coming over and kneeling on the other side of the desk Peter was sitting in. He was so tall that it only put him at eye level. “Do you remember how I told the class I was colorblind?”
The kid was too kind, too compassionate. Oh, they had their moments. What parent and child didn’t? But Tony always would stand by what he had said before: Peter was more than he
She gave him a smile and came into the kitchen specifically to pat him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, you’re only obvious to everyone who knows you. I approve, unless I find some dirt on him. But most importantly, you have a good head on your shoulders. Whatever you decide, or whatever happens, we’re here for you.”
But when everyone was drunk and you had the best archer in the land and other highly killed soldiers armed with magic and alchemy on your side?
That night, while everyone else slept, Antonius risked the danger of darkness to find stones that would be suitable for making arrowheads. The work was difficult. He had only the dimming fire to work by, which he made sure to keep fed so everyone else could continue to sleep. The stones were harder than he expected and he had to work quietly, but he was determined.
Mr. Rogers smiled brightly—and wow, was that smile like sunshine. “Of course. Have a good day, you two. See you tomorrow, Peter?”
But what took his breath away was the wall before him: from the bottom to almost the top and spanning the whole length of the wall, hands were scattered, outlined in reds, blacks, and whites. They were of different sizes, some overlapping, and some were more faded than others. The people who made this obviously sprayed the paint somehow, but why—
Tony rolled his eyes and cuddled closer to Steve, which soothed him. Steve snuggled in further. They could think about all that later.
Tony winced, remembering. That had been a miserable time—not only was he sick, but projects were delayed and the shareholders had panicked.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Someone gave you Hanahaki Disease. I don’t care what I have to do, I am going to make sure you get better.”
“Well, as long as she learned her lesson,” Steve said, hesitantly. Given how Alice was pouting with crossed arms, she probably had not. Hopefully, the family would keep any magic textbooks or items locked up from her for more than a week. And hopefully their brother was back to normal too.
“No clue,” Tony replied, leading Peter out as well. He had been given the rest of the day off, given what had happened. Peter looked like he could use a break. “It’d better be a wakeup call at least.”
In the end, Tony decided to stay away. How could he meet someone he admired and resented at the same time? How could he not say something that would get him punched? Or possibly escorted out of the not-so-secret building they had their meetings?
Something told Tony that winter this year would be a bitter one. Frost was still lingering on the windows despite the morning sun and some people were worrying over storms and winds affecting winter festivals and events. The autumn events were a hit like always. Rhodey wasn’t able to go to the Comic Con, but Pepper thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate festival and all it had to offer. Sadly, Tony was steered out of the coffee festival after one hour. He did have to admit, it was probably for the best. Coffee beans boasting three times the amount of caffeine wouldn’t be good for anyone’s heart, no matter the condition.
“So this isn’t an attempt to create a squirrel army.” Bucky’s voice was absolutely serious and deadpanned.
“Go get something to eat and some fresh air. It’s been over twenty-four hours again. You agreed that you would reduce these binges.”
Everything in the hallway was in chaos, people rushing from the lower floors. The alarms were blaring and the white lights above those alarms were bound to give someone a seizure. Why someone approved such blinding lights when—no, no Tony, focus.
Tony put the wrench down. “JARVIS, you are the most sophisticated, powerful machine in the world, surpassing everything and all. Why can’t you make with the hacking?”
“While I am happy to do that on our servers,” JARVIS said, “I am afraid that it would be unethical for me to delete such files from the personal servers and devices of Mr. Rogers, Ms. Romanoff, and others.”
“Until we can get some actual doctors here, can … can you just stay? Please?” Tony asked desperately.
Stiofán beamed. The pigment would likely dry a little darker, but … Antonius felt a warmth in his chest that he could not ascribe to the strange symbol the gods had placed within it.
“I’ve been trying to hint at this for weeks, but either I was being too subtle or you were being too blind.”
“Oh god,” Tony moaned, burying himself further into the scarf. “Thank you! You sure you aren’t cold?”
“And I’m sorry someone’s making you go through this,” Steve continued as if he had no idea how much of Tony’s world he just shattered. He probably didn’t. “I kind of want to rip them a new one, for being cowards. I know the media paints you one way, but if they’d just tell you, I know you’d give them a fair shot.”
Anxiety and suspicion clawed into Tony’s chest, cold and razor sharp. He struggled to keep it down, but ultimately, he couldn’t help but question everything he’d known upto this point. Were Steve and his friends planted as undercover agents? Were Sam and Natasha aware of what was going on? Did they open that shop so close to SI specifically to lure him in? What did Agent Coulson and the rest of SHIELD really want from him? Did they know about HYDRA resurfacing and planning to kidnap him? How deep and how far did their intel go?
“Like all mental issues, it is hard to pin down why someone has a condition and someone else doesn’t, even in the same household,” one of the professionals said. “It doesn’t mean that there is anything wrong with Peter. He just needs to learn different coping skills than say, someone who has dyslexia or someone who is on the autistic spectrum.”
He was not one for much introspection, but figured what else was he going to do at this time? Trying to figure out math or design another schematic was too much at four in the morning when all he could smell was pollen and perfume and green things.
Tony’s smile was blinding. “Later. This is about you right now, because I am determined to drive any and all thoughts about you being unworthy out of your head. Those other alphas? Assholes. They didn’t know what they had. You let yourself get
Steve looked up at Tony and Tony responded with a slight smile. Clambering out of Tony’s lap, Steve went over and settled onto Peter’s. Peter was surprised for a moment, but it took him only a moment to start stroking Steve’s back.
“You—you cannot think it will go well,” he choked, his mouth deciding to forego English altogether. “There is …”
. This amount of beautiful people congregating in one place only happened in the movies. Why was this happening? What was reality anymore?
After that, it was a long and tedious waiting game of espionage and planning. In between planning this attack and pleading for aid from his allies, Steve wracked his brain, trying to figure out why he didn’t see this betrayal coming sooner or why he could not have figured out that Schmidt was coming for them on his seemingly random pillaging spree. Did he not enforce the laws fairly? Was he not merciful whenever he could be? Did he not keep them out of war, give people aid during famine and drought? Did he not do all he could to be a good king?
“It can be,” Mr. Rogers said, turning back to Tony. “There are other factors involved, but about eleven percent of students have ADHD in some form or another. Peter isn’t alone in this. But before we get ahead of ourselves, how about we set up a meeting with our paraprofessional and rule out anything else? ADHD is a possibility, but that doesn’t mean it is what’s going on.”
Tony had to admit, later that evening, as he tried to work through another panic attack, that they had a point. Even as he tried to justify his actions with ‘hundreds of weapons that could no longer hurt anyone’ and ‘so much intel on so many criminal activities’, they had a point.
Tony didn’t like it, because there was this thing called ‘hours of productivity lost’, but he woke up feeling … a lot better than usual, if he wanted to be honest. The scent of bread and coffee started to waft up from somewhere and Tony couldn’t help but follow his nose.
At least until someone put various snacks in front of them, including some bottles of water. Both of them jumped in surprise.
But Bruce knew what long nights at the lab were. He understood technical jargon and the bitter defeat of projects that needed to be scrapped. He knew the dangers and consequences of working with anything that required some risk taking, beyond board members changing their minds or terrorists wanting to use his genius for one horrible reason or another.
“Yes. It’s the one Pepper and Rhodey told me about,” Steve explained matter-of-factly. “I’m to find a newspaper, roll it up, and swat you with it until JARVIS says to stop.”
Thor chuckled. “It has been my fortune to have been going through the same. Or should I say misfortune? My brother has been complaining of the house being stuffy.”
Tony could hear the sniper say something, but the static of the voice over and Tony’s own coughs prevented him from making the words out. He tried to wipe some of the dust off of his face and out of his eyes, but it was useless. It just smeared or rose up in dust clouds again.
“Seems like you got that mostly covered,” Captain America said, before grabbing Tony’s arm and looking him over. “You alright? Are you injured anywhere?”
Lunch dissolved into discussions about various plot points, fandom wars, and quickly stuffing their mouths and rushing off to class before they were late. But despite that, bringing up the possibility that his father had ADHD too nagged at the back of his mind for the rest of the day.
Steve shrugged. “Looking back at it now, I think our whole friendship was leading to something more. Don’t know why I didn’t see it.”
It was just Pepper, he had to remind himself. Even though the workshop was in SI, there were no security cameras, no bugs. No one was allowed inside without a code, unless the building was on fire, and even then, he had safety protocols that went above and beyond normal regulations. There was no way that Obie would be able to get in and see what he was doing.
“Ever since finding out about you, he’s done his best to be the father you deserve,” Pepper had told him fondly. “And I haven’t seen him happier.”
There were few tribes or clans who had been able to amass much of anything, let alone enough to kill over. To simply kill for the thrill of it—
“Whoa, don’t worry about it,” Bucky said as he put the cut up fruit into containers. “Your phone rang, so we answered it. It’s fine.”
“What do I have to do? Make it a law for you not to be kidnapped? I will single-handedly lobby Congress if I have to!” Pepper exclaimed when he finally made it back to his apartment. “I swear, I am so sick of—oh thank god, you don’t have any flowers!”
There were so many other differences … He found himself questioning what the gods were thinking, sending him here. He was so far removed from everything he knew. There was little possibility to recreate his forges and kiln. He drew designs and plans in the dirt with sticks, dreaming and yearning for what once was.
Growing up, I had the fortune to have a dad who was really into science fiction and who loved to share these books, movies, and shows with me. I have a lot of good memories with him because of that and there will be more of these memories featured in this story. My dad has been gone for a while now, but the books mentioned in this chapter are the ones I distinctly remember him loving the most. A bit of a tribute to him, if you will, as he helped me find reprints of the Captain America comics before he passed, simply because I loved Captain America.
Tony leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees. One leg was jumping up and down nervously. Steve looked impossibly stiff. Who knew that there was a form of standing at attention when one was sitting?
“Oh, okay,” Ned said, looking a little uncomfortable. Peter knew it was because he didn’t know what to say, not because he actually minded.
Tony sneered. Where had this man been the last two years? Every tabloid and some news outlets reported the whole process it took Tony to adopt Peter. That he was his father should not have been a question.
Tony felt a pang in his heart. It was all too easy to forget that people took such risks to take on businesses and make something of their own, rather than work for someone else. Making money was difficult; few people really struck gold. Fewer people didn’t worry about bills or rent coming due or if they would have gas for their morning commute or even tuition for school. His mind instantly went to writing them a check, but that instantly felt cheap. It would solve their problems, but it wouldn’t. It would be better to make a donation to a veteran’s charity in their name or leave it anonymous. Then no one would ask questions.
“—and I don’t care about your medical problems, because I know you’ve been getting healthier since the university started that health program, and I swear, if none of your classmates have asked you to pose for them, they’re blind and shouldn’t be in art—”
Tony also knew that sometimes, Pepper denied herself a little bit too much. She worked three time as hard as anyone, put out so many more trash fires than imaginable, and hardly got the credit or recognition that she would have gotten if she were male.
Pepper put her phone away when they entered and looked around. She hid it rather well, but he could tell that she was surprised. It was hardly a Starbucks. But then, a little smile came over her face and he saw the tension in her shoulders ease just a little bit.
“The meeting with Mr. Rogers,” Peter repeated. “I saw you leaving the school between periods. Unless you were speaking with the principal? Or someone else?”
. They were small and out of the way and only locals ever heard of them, or hipsters, but generally, they had awful drinks that he could complain about and random things to look at on their walls. Their employees were also potential subjects to complain about or marvel at how weird humans could be. Same with fellow customers. Most importantly, no one cared who he was. They were all on the same mission: to get coffee, pretend to support local businesses, and choke on their own self-importance.
“Ha, ha,” he deadpanned. “But seriously, if you’re not going to divide it up, I’ll happily buy the whole thing.”
“A little past eight,” Steve said. “Don’t worry, I already called Pepper and explained that you would be a little late.”
Weighing his options, Tony ducked into a supply closet. He didn’t see anyone on this floor, but that meant nothing. If HYDRA of all things was still in operation, that meant they had to be smart and well-funded. They weren’t your run-of-the-mill white supremacy organization with handmade explosive and just a single plan to send their message to the world.
of Hanahaki,” Steve sighed, rolling his eyes fondly, as if Tony was an idiot. “I looked into it as a possibility last night. I’ll be fine, if not single-handedly keeping Kleenex afloat. Besides, if they’re not ready to tell me their feelings or if they are working through something, I gotta respect that.”
“We’re almost done!” Peter said proudly. “JARVIS really helped with adjusting the range of movements Mr. Stark has now, not to mention the different proportions.”
They rushed out into the downpour, following JARVIS’ directions to where Happy was in traffic. They attempted to avoid puddles, but with how they were running, splashes were inevitable. At one point, as they rushed past the gridlock, some car sped around a corner and sent a wave of muddy water. Steve adjusted the umbrella, thereby shielding them from the worst.
It would … it would be nice to get to know Steve better, outside of the coffee shop. See movies, have takeout, wander around and people watch. Find out what he did when he wasn’t being a geek over classic sci-fi or running a coffee shop. Learn what inside jokes he and Bucky had, hear more stories about his other friends and family. He wanted to be able to share all those things with Steve too. See where they differed or didn’t mesh well or how well they could get along.
It was another morning. The wind had a little more bite than usual, but the weathermen were predicting good weather for the trick-or-treaters. Tony was replaying everything that Cap—
Tony was the brilliant handyman who knew everything about science and mechanics, chemistry and physics. Steve was the temporary gardener who knew how to work the land and knew a thing or two about art thanks to the local parish allowing churchgoers access to their library. They shared a sense of humor, a fascination for the world around them, and the possibilities it held. They agreed on many topics regarding equality and reform.
“And given that Peter picked up on it, yes, you need to talk to someone about this. Though I’m glad you already know that it’s not ethical to date your son’s teacher.” Pepper patted his arm comfortingly. “But I know your priority is Peter.”
Tony kissed him again. “See? That’s another reason to love you. You’re thinking of me as a person, not just an alpha.”
The sun coming through the window felt wonderful. It was probably because of all his fur that he felt warmer than he normally would have, but …
In the end, any worries Steve had about their relationship rocking the boat in their social circle was for naught. Pretty much everyone muttered, ‘about damn time’.
“So it can be fixed? You can undo this?” Steve asked, padding over. He hoped the girls would stop arguing.
“That’s alright.” Mr. Rogers’ voice was gentle. “I know you try. You are one of the most determined, persistent students I have ever had. You do your best and I appreciate that.”
“Dandelion seeds, or really, the fluff of them,” one doctor said. “That is all it was. I would stop all medications now, Mr. Rogers.”
He was that Shakespeare quote—little, but fierce. He was a tempest in a teacup, ready to thrown down verbal smack down as quickly as he was to put up his fists. Often times, he did both.
Tony resumed rubbing his hand up and down Steve’s back, the warmth and repetitive movement comforting.
Stiofán pulled him into a hug. Antonius buried his face into Stiofán’s bony shoulder and didn’t hold back his sobs.
He couldn’t say the same for others. Some of his coworkers had been complaining about the cold and the future storms all day, along with the usual complaints of overdue books and people who forgot that they had books placed on hold. At least the library was warm inside.
As soon as Steve was in his bathroom, Tony left the bedroom. Everyone else respected his wishes and stayed out as well. The food got delivered and paid for, Pepper left to pick up the candles and other items she had looked up. They felt only marginally better about the whole disaster, but the best thing to do was take it one step at a time.
“What else?” Tony bemoaned as the mice helped make Cinderella’s dress. “Do you have a brick for a cell phone? Do you still have a landline? An analogue watch?”
Steve smile and closed his eyes, pulling Tony closer. He took in a deep breath, smelling smoke and fresh air, the scent of hot metal and magic, the honey soap Tony always managed to keep on hand.
There is definitely attraction on his part. If he asked, there is a high probability that Steve would say yes. It would be fun. They’d do something simple, like get ice cream and walk around a park, enjoy the good weather and each other’s company. He seems like the kind of guy who would appreciate something simple and old fashioned, not flashy cars and fancy dinners.
A dozen different answers came up, which caused Betty to find the hat they always relied upon to prevent arguments from going too far. They attempted a rotation schedule, which they lost track of, and voting was not much better either. The night was young, but as they learned over and over again, they could argue among themselves for eternity.
Ned paused in eating his lunch and MJ glanced up from the book she was reading. The rest of the cafeteria continued as normal, with shouts and chatting and eating, but it was like time had paused for a moment around their small table.
The HYDRA agent did not look amused. “We have plenty of money,” the agent said. “We need something else from you.”
recipes followed, but Steve did not miss the subliminal messaging throughout the whole book. The obvious opinions the author had about omegas made him shudder.
He could not describe the weight that had been lifted off his shoulders. He thought he had angered the gods by doing too much, for reaching too far with his tools and projects. He thought that in going into their caves, he had incurred their wrath and so, they removed him from all he knew and loved, leaving their mark in a way that could not be ignored. He thought that he was doomed to never know what happened to his friends, those he cared for, even as he started to build a life here. The shadows of what he had done would always mar any life he might have.
What was it about the damning evidence being on Stane’s personal computer that was so hard for him to swallow and wrap his mind around?
So many people judged him on his looks. Tony knew that no matter how hard he punched or how many times he said he ran every morning to improve his health, Steve felt that judgement keenly. He would see ads and movies and never, ever see himself, except for when someone was being used as the butt of a joke or some cardboard stereotype. It pissed Tony off that so many aspects of their society was still twisted and manipulative like that, but they had a literal medical disease that made people suffer unless they had open, honest communication with loved ones.
“It’s filled out, with our names,” Tony interrupted. “I got it just in case you couldn’t take a hint or ultimately said no. It’s not Alpha Night yet, so I’m still not breaking any rules here. As a matter of fact, I’m following the rules because I’m asking you if you’d like to be mine. All you have to do is say yes and sign. Then you don’t even have to worry about Alpha Night or someone else stealing me away or worrying about me saying yes, because I already have.”
Ned happily described some of the chemical changes, like the one where water was turned into ‘gold’ and another where a blue liquid was turned into an amber color one. They had written down the chemical equations, along with their observations, for him to copy later.
Tony laughed his head off, slapping his knees as Steve continued to debate different shades of blue with some kid named Pissarro. Bucky was sitting next to him, shaking his head and grumbling, because of course he would get into arguments about
One night, when his board of directors were hounding him, when the media was stalking him, and when the whole world just became a buzzing sensation of noise, Rhodey was suddenly on the phone and Pepper was holding him. He was covered in tears and the armor’s helmet on the floor, half taken apart, pieces of the second design scattered all over.
He closed down those thoughts, not wanting to send himself into a spiral of anxiety, not when he had just pulled Tony out from doing the same. If anything happened, he knew that his team would be alright. They were all capable beings and he would find some way to give them support too. They had plans, training, and their own unique capabilities to defeat the crisis of the week.
He loved it when Steve’s cheeks flushed in embarrassment or his eyes flashed with righteous anger. He loved his laugh. He loved how passionate he could get. There were many nights where he dreamed of just running his hands over Steve’s smooth, pale skin and enjoying seeing love bites last on his skin for much longer because there was no tan to hide them. He was intelligent in ways that Tony wasn’t, loyal to his friends, and just … good.
Today had started out so normal, so nice. The sun rose, the birds sang, and his bagels were perfectly toasted. He made it to work on time and without incident. Most of his shift would be at the front desk, checking out books and answering questions as needed. He also had some filing to do, which included some forms he had printed out at home.
. I don’t need any romance. I mean, it would be nice, but it’s not a top priority for me right now.”
“That’s great,” Captain America replied. He seemed to be satisfied that he wasn’t hurt, though the concern seemed to be out of place. “Did you have an escape route or anything in place? My partner and I were going to secure a pathway to an exit where SHIELD could safely pick the three us of up. We already have other men surrounding the building discreetly.”
“You missed one,” Natasha said, giving him a smirk as she plucked the pink petal off of his shoulder.
He was sweating and ready to collapse from the effort it took to get here, and people would surely be whispering about this over their fancy teas, but he
Steve bumped his shoulder. “How about we go on another date before you pick my old timer’s brain for war stories?”
Screw Flash and figuring out a resolution between the students or anything else. The kid was old enough to know that such behavior was stupid and wrong. Sure, he needed to be held accountable for his actions and behaviors, but Peter could be kept out of it and away from him as much as possible. Tony didn’t want him
, making him just slightly taller than Antonius. With him was another child, much younger. She couldn’t have been older than seven years.
“Of course, come here,” Tony said, climbing onto the bed and pulling Steve to him, blanket and all. Steve snuggled into him, letting out a deep sigh.
Steve knew that his mother would box his ears for the behavior he would soon be partaking in. She taught him better manners than what he would soon be displaying—she taught him many, many things so he would not have to suffer the way she and her generation had. He may still be poor, practically in poverty, and he might not have a drop of blue blood in him, but at least he knew how to speak proper English and he could read, write, and calculate.
start. We can try other things, like getting you a planner or seating you somewhere else in your classes so you can focus more easily. Once we get a diagnosis, we’ll know more of what to do, but it doesn’t mean you will be put on medication. That is between you, your dad, and what the doctor will recommend.”
“You’re still paying, or would you make a friend pay for their own coffee while visiting you?” Natasha asked. She didn’t even bat an eyelash at his worst glare. Rhodey only snickered.
The man came back and handed Steve a cool, damp cloth. He was cleaned up a lot more, but missed a smudge of something right by his cheekbone.
Steve chuckled and hoped a few of the scholarships he had filled out would get accepted. Pepper had spent the last few days helping him go over essays, make sure everything was in order, and even found him a couple of lesser known scholarships for their school. Every penny would help combat against student loan debt that was mounting up for him and Bucky. They still had about a year to go before they got their degrees, but jobs after graduation were not guaranteed.
Tony looked up from the contracts he was looking over (and having JARVIS double check in case he read something wrong) to see a shorter man with blonde hair come into the coffee shop. Steve came from behind the counter and gave him a fist bump. He did that from time to time with random people, but they all seemed to have the same look about them. Tony figured they were either old friends or they were in the Army with him, Bucky, or Sam.
After that, Steve personally learned that Tony was brilliant, intelligent, gorgeous, he had a hilarious sense of humor, appreciated all movies and music … he could go on about everything that made him an amazing person. Steve could compose sonnets, write songs, paint pictures. If he did any of those creative pursuits … well, no one really had to know.
Bucky, Natasha, and Sam were all sitting in the apartment’s living room, tense as if someone were on their deathbed.
He opened the plastic container and the scent of apples and cinnamon wafted up. It was still a little warm, the thin drizzle not even hardening yet. As he stuck his fork in, the piece of the cake came off easily without crumbling. Further into it, he saw real apple slices in there.
Somewhere, somehow, Steve pissed someone off. Pissed someone off royally. And the best form of revenge that they could think up was to put someone completely unattainable within his reach. Why couldn’t he have been a mechanic? Wait, no, if Tony was a customer, it would still be a breach of ethics. God, he was screwed no matter what he did. Why couldn’t he have been—no, barista would do the same thing. Purchaser of a Stark Phone that happened to somehow run into Tony? Nah, statistical impossibility given the population of Manhattan.
He didn’t mention how there were all sorts of other little signs, going back to when they first met. The slang from the 1940s, how he’d had to catch up on so many books and movies. A lot of his world views, from politics to veterans to climate change. Telling him all those details was a little too much right now. He could see this conversation going in all sorts of ways: anger, resignation, denial. The breaking of whatever this relationship was.
Antonius remembered there being water. It dripped from somewhere up high. The ground beneath his feet rose and fell. Sand and rough grit stuck to his legs and arms. Large rocks broke up the sandy ground, causing him to stumble. He scraped his knees and palms. His temple bled from a thrown rock. His lungs burned with cold.
Apple had nothing on all of the applications he had, with plenty of memory leftover. It had yet to hit the market, he wanted to get some opinions from Rhodey first, but when it did … boom. The market was going to be revolutionized, the phone would be cheaper, and he was going to make sure a portion of the sales went to ensure technology was actually, properly cleaned up, and set up programs to legitimize so-called ‘recycling centers’ in other parts of the world that were just
Steve felt his cheeks begin to flush. He had to be mistaken about the look in Tony’s eyes. Well, he hoped that Tony would look at him with that kind of heat, but it was way too soon. Tony hadn’t even shown any interest in his courting attempts. Not that many had been successful, but surely he wasn’t that oblivious. Then again, it wasn’t like his flirting was going anywhere. His attempts to cook were disastrous at best.
Not with how the sun caught in his hair and made it a few shades lighter, like some sort of halo around his head. Or how his eyes lit up and became even bluer when someone said something funny or he recognized a customer. Not when he remembered what was going on in everyone’s lives and genuinely asked about their days. Not when his simple cotton shirts did nothing to hide his amazing arms or how his apron accented his waist just right. He blushed easily, smiled often, and Tony swore that if he could bottle his laugh, he’d be three times as rich.
The acting was really different too. More gestures, more facial expressions, but nothing over the top. Not being able to hear inflections—and those text cards—really stopped him from being able to immerse himself in the world before him. But every character looked different and unique, from their costumes to heights and body types. Without sound, little details like that needed to be more present, more authentic. There wasn’t an accent that could give an audience all the context they needed for someone’s background. They had to pay attention.
Then it dawned upon him. Just like there were asshole alphas out there who made him feel like next to nothing, who had him staring in the mirror and wishing he was small again, there were omegas out there who made alphas feel like they were worthless. How many times did Tony stare in a mirror and wonder what was wrong with himself too?
When Peter didn’t answer right away, Tony pulled back to look at him. Peter’s lip was wobbling and he saw it was still swollen. His cheek was bruised as well. He imagined that Peter had some other bruises and scrapes under his jacket and jeans.
“I can confirm that,” Mr. Rogers added, stepping forward. “I heard the commotion from inside my classroom and came out to see what was going on. The two of them were on the floor and various books were scattered. Peter was on top of Flash momentarily, but I only saw Flash punch Peter. I did not see any actions prior to that. I then went over and separated them. Flash resisted quite a bit, which is why I called Mr. Thompson later on.”
And as much as he adored Tony, they were friends. He was lucky enough to get that. He was not going to blow that out of the water on a two percent rate of success.
The man gave him a smile, and maybe would have said more, if someone else didn’t come up to the counter right then. Tony gave him a quick wave and headed out.
“Yeah, I do. Everything you, Rhodey, Happy, and Bruce do for me—I can’t begin to repay you. I know I haven’t been the best … friend, boss, person … I stumble and fall more than anything else. So, thank you is gonna have to be a start.”
Black tactical gear made up the man’s entire outfit. There was even some sort of mask covering the lower half of his face, goggles obscuring his features further. The only bit of skin he could see was his fingers, because apparently gloves got in the way of using the sniper rifle he was carrying. He wondered, then, if his loose hair was a liability or a stubborn fashion choice.
He refused to apologize. Tony should have been honest with who he was. He shouldn’t have led him on like he did. He could have gotten Steve fired! He could have caused a scandal that would have made it impossible for Steve to live! Finding work that wouldn’t kill him was hard enough! Working in the factory, hot, sweaty, and cramped, was a torture. Bucky insisted that they could find something else for him, something easier on his lungs, but they needed the income.
“By some unholy sacrifice or Pepper being that amazing, I am sure. But what about Natasha?” Bucky asked, grinning.
“Yeah. But really. Thank you. The school library didn’t have a copy, the bookstore is out of them, and it’s costing over a hundred dollars!”
. Crushes on celebrities or so-called ‘nice guys’ thinking they deserved love because they treated someone like a human being did not count. That was another part of it that made Tony sick, because this meant someone truly loved him, but thought that he would not feel the same.
It was not wrong, people had told him throughout his life, to have feelings. Feelings were natural, normal. A part of the human condition and experience. However, Steve felt that all of the people who encouraged him to feel or act upon his feelings were not considering a major aspect of emotions: the circumstances surrounding them.
(No, seriously. He was randomly asked to be a part of a tester sample group and he was not the most vocal about his disdain for that drink, among others. He was sure that little old lady made some of the employees weep. She was adamant about expressing her fury towards them for, quote, ‘Ruining one of the most underrated, underappreciated vegetables that should just stay in pies and other forms of baking, not liquid atrocities.’)
“Yes,” Tony said, shaking his hand as he came out from behind his desk. He had a good handshake, as if he practiced. “Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Rogers.”
At least he had his friends, he thought, as he flipped through a few more pages of a book about courtship rituals omegas could initiate. Bucky, Sam, and Nat at least appreciated him. They didn’t think he was worthless or needed to fit some sort of societal expectation. Sure, they poked and snarked at him, but he gave back what he got, and he knew that they would always have each other’s backs. They had covered shifts, helped with chores, picked up dinner without being asked, and did so much more. They didn’t bother with keeping track.
But as soon as everything stopped getting thrown around and the dust settled, Tony swooped in and convinced Bruce to stay where Ross couldn’t touch him.
She smiled and placed his phone on the bathroom counter. “You’re running a bit late. JARVIS called me, saying you maybe needed to talk to a person.”
Steve sighed deeply, forcing a fresh wave of embarrassment to the back of his mind where it belonged. “I don’t know.”
He still chuckled at the memories of the alphas who thought that just because he was an omega, he couldn’t throw a punch. But his amusement would die pretty quickly when he remembered the dreams they tore apart with their narrow views and high expectations. This last breakup had been pretty bad, with this latest guy doing some pretty awful—
“If you can guess correctly, I’ll give it to you for free,” Natasha said as she made some other orders.
Everyone knew that they were the sacred realms of the gods. They were places to be feared and respected, avoided except for when the gods demanded tribute. No one knew how deep they went. No one knew where they went or what was to be found inside them, beyond the horrifying legends of the underworld and the lands of the dead. To go into one, to go beyond where the sunlight lingered, was to bring death and ill fortune upon the clan, for the gods would never forgive the insult of a mortal crossing into their world.
“Yeah. He’s not the only one with a complex like that. I don’t know if it’s worse than what I did as a kid, but I can’t exactly promote violence.”
Tony scowled. “No. If it was Steve, he would be like a bull in a china shop. He’d confess two seconds into a crush. Why would he think he wouldn’t be good enough anyways?”
Antonius tried to keep up as they spoke, glean any information that he could, but he could barely figure out any of their names. The man with wheat hair apparently answered questions as best he could, but Antonius could tell from his expressions that he could only answer so much.
There was a little nook with an old table and some wooden chairs with soft green cushions. A professional set up filled the rest of the room, all sleek and modern: a huge island in the center, plenty of cabinets for storage, a huge refrigerator, an industrial sized mixing machine, and just about everything else a team of bakers would need. All the scents of the coffee shop were in full force here. A single breath was all it took to get Tony’s mouth to start watering.
Steve smiled, brighter than the sun as always, but Tony saw the sharpness in his eyes. “Great! I hope you like bran, I made them
There were more people in regular, civilian clothes, looking panicked and alarmed, but he had no way to know who was HYDRA or not. He initially tried to hide among the crowd, but someone clapped their hand on his shoulder.
he found in the bogs were harder to manipulate for something decorative, but he was proud of the results anyways.
The walk was still too long and by the time they got to the coffee shop, Tony felt like he was about to burst out of his skin. He
Steve was sitting on the edge of his mattress, his bath towel wrapped around his waist. His hair was still slightly damp and he looked absolutely miserable.
He wanted to hug him from behind and bury his face in his neck, feel his shoulders under his hands, know what it was like to have his arms around his shoulders …
The guards outside the chamber’s doors left, being ordered by a messenger to give support, as there were apparently rebels all over the castle.
When Peter told him that one of his teachers asked him to attend a parent-teacher conference, he was nearly in tears. Lately, he had been getting detention for not paying attention, forgetting his school supplies in his locker, or turning in assignments incomplete. There was no doubt that his son was brilliant—past grades and performances showed this—but everything had been spiraling out of control. Arguments and fights with his classmates. Insomnia. Losing track of his possessions at home and getting overwhelmed more frequently than ever.
Peter knew that if he ever needed help, he could call Tony. It didn’t matter where he was or what happened, he would come for him. He would do whatever it took to make things okay again. But then it circled back to the fact that Peter wouldn’t. He would duck his head, avoid someone in the hallways, and insist he was fine. He would try to ignore the problem until it went away or would figure out some ingenious, clever solution.
That section of the library was empty for some reason. It was usually filled with various omegas, typically younger ones like him, looking for information about how to be attractive to alphas or get over bad relationships or make progress on the one they were currently in. He might have picked up a bad apple, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t something helpful.
Knowing better than to throw a loaded gun, Tony held it out in front of him, seconds away from firing a bullet through the man’s skull if he had to. His hand shook a little. His throat burned. He was tired of being out of his depth. He was tired of being caught off guard by bombs and goons popping out of nowhere and having to abandon every plan to get out of here.
He wasn’t sure what was going on, but he knew he hired smarter people than that. He knew that those people were smarter than that presentation. He trusted them to make good decisions and use their skills wisely, but that meeting did not sit right with him.
for their age and that was likely where some of the bullying came into play. No one knew that Peter took after his mother’s side of the family, which meant that he was going to be a bean pole sooner rather or later. Peter walked close to Tony, enough that their arms and elbows bumped into one another. He seemed to do better being grounded this way, at least until they got to Mr. Roger’s classroom.
“Should have never let me have a computer,” Tony quipped. He gripped the pipe he was still holding onto. It would be worthless in a gun fight, but it still gave him some measure of comfort.
“You probably shouldn’t be hosting me. If your father were to find me, he’d blow a … what is that term? Fuse? Gasket?”
Steve looked up from the book he was reading. He was manning the library desk today, ensuring that people found their books and didn’t have too many hiccups with the new self-checkout stations. Overall, it had been a quiet day, until now. Peter Parker, who was a freshman and something like Tony’s mentee, came running up to the desk in an absolute panic.
Steve got up, picked a newspaper up from one of the convenient stacks, and before Tony could even get out of the way, lightly swatted the top of his head.
Steve snorted, amused, and went to make the drink. Tony paid and went to his usual table, pulling out his tablet. He had schematics to work on and this was perfect. Absolutely perfect. No one else was in, the streets were quiet, and Steve must have been the one who changed the music to smooth jazz instead of the usual top hits or whatever kids listened to these days. Sure, he preferred to blast out AC/DC, but this was good too. Something different.
From the looks of it, he was in a cave once more, but it was obviously in use by the living. Skins and hides were arranged around the floor, save for areas reserved for cooking and preparing food. He was on some of those skins with a large amount of cloth covering him, made from wool, but it was dyed a deep blue color. It had to have been expensive—only the richest of kings could afford to get cloth of this color and quality.
“Morning,” Tony greeted, like he had only arrived there a second before. Really, he was savoring the difference between his singing voice and his speaking voice, committing the whole thing to memory and wishing JARVIS was able to record it. He seemed to have a knack for knowing when to capture moments for posterity. “Vinyl, nice.”
Steve had an umbrella and a scarf, but he was hesitating to go outside himself. This autumn was slipping into winter quicker than usual with bitter winds and foul weather changing every other second. Even the kids were complaining. One little girl muttered that if there wasn’t any snow or frost to stomp around in, why was the weather bothering to be all wet and gross?
Still, he followed them closely, carefully, not willing to put anything more to chance than he had to.
“Hey there, welcome in,” someone called from the counter, bright and cheerful. “You just missed the breakfast rush. What can I get you?”
“Oh, that,” Tony said, putting the wires down. “It went well. Quick meeting. He was just checking in and letting me know how you were doing.”
“Especially—” Tony held up a finger, interrupting Natasha. She raised her eyebrows as if no one had ever stopped her from speaking before. This was probably the first time in history. This was probably going to be his last moments on this sweet, sweet earth.
However, he was still the head of the R&D department, a major shareholder, had a position on the board of directors, and still owned the whole thing too. He knew that it was imperative for the future of the company and their on-going efforts to provide jobs in hundreds of sectors and push the world into more sustainable technologies. In order to do that, he had to accept that he was the face of the company—which meant he could not always go home at the end of the day.
“Sir,” JARVIS insisted. “This is a matter I believe deserves your attention. I would not bring it up if I did not believe there was a ninety-eight percent chance of there being credibility to the claim.”
“I know I’ve sunk pretty low, but this needs to be done,” Steve whispered as they went down the long tower stairs and into the main corridor of the western side of the castle. Everything was deserted, men leaving their posts to fight the main battle that should now be in the throne room. He once knew this castle like the back of his hand, but even though he still knew the layout and recognized every brick and archway, it felt completely foreign to him.
She smiled, just a quirk of the corner of her mouth. “Then it looks like I single-handedly keep this place afloat.”
Now that Tony had a set of parameters to compare, he understood Peter’s actions and behaviors a lot more. He just assumed that Peter was energetic and took after him in terms of intelligence.
Steve grabbed and stuffed a dumpling into his mouth to give himself more time to think before he said something he would regret or have to spend ages explaining.
“Uh, yeah,” Steve said, standing up from what looked to be a massive amount of paperwork. From what Tony could see, a lot of it had to do with bills or government stuff. “About ten minutes ago, but I could—”
“We did not want to mention it until you did,” Stiofán admitted. “But perhaps, you did not even know. Toní, you have a mark of Lugh—you have been blessed.”
“It’s just the same insecurities that keep popping up,” Steve confessed. “Except now it’s all because I’m apparently an alpha. Jeeze, as if the universe didn’t pick on me enough.”
“None of that either! I happen to like your broad shoulders! And our height difference! If you ever decide to pick me up and fuck me against a wall, believe me, I am
Tony nodded and guided Peter in, soon followed by Mr. Thompson and the other kid, and finally by Mr. Rogers, who then closed the door.
, but he also knew she wouldn’t act upon that knowledge unless she felt he needed help or was getting into a bad situation. Now that he knew more of those red flags himself and had a few months of therapy to help him, he was sure that even if something did go south with Tony, he would come out alright.
Tony scowled and waved a paw in the air. “Fine, fine, we’ll just hold off on solving this for a little while longer. Tell everyone I’ll do voice conferences or emails, no video meetings. Tell them I’m sick and still very vain.”
“Yeah. I’ll admit I don’t know much about it, but I’m gonna become an expert in it before the weekend is over.”
The little girl gasped, clutching her to-go mug with star-struck eyes. “You like hot chocolate, Mr. Stark?”
But Natasha was working on making pastry cream, Sam was checking on cookies and muffins, Steve was finishing up the inventory check, and Bucky was working on some cake batter. They all chatted as they worked, nothing too out of the ordinary or serious. It felt like the morning he came in before they opened. Everything was warm, soft, and cozy. It felt like he belonged. There was no pressure for him to do anything; he could just exist if he wanted to.
“It’s fine, really. The offices are just down the block. Literally across the road. Besides, you need to get back home too.”
Everyone had heard of Manet’s famous café discussion groups. He and his friends were some of the leading artists of the day, even if they were associated with the movement that had yet to be named. Steve admired them from afar, knowing their talent for art was so much greater than his. He sometimes daydreamed about joining them, but—
This place was nothing like the country estate where he originally met Tony—back when he thought Tony was another member of the working class like him. Back when he thought they were on equal grounds and didn’t have things like social class in between them. Bitterly, he thought of how the country estate at least had more room to move around and larger windows to allow in sunlight and fresh air with views of the gardens and forests surrounding the house.
“See, that’s part of the reason why I love you,” Tony said. “You’re loyal. You can be kind, but you can be vindictive and I love how you hold grudges. I love it when you get all righteous, unless you disagree with me, because lets’ face it, I’m always right—”
“I’m going to make it illegal to drone on and on like those guys did,” he continued, watching the coast line of Manhattan draw closer. “If someone can’t be excited for what they are presenting, then there is clearly a problem with it.”
“I mean it,” she insisted. “Do you know how many people would just go for it, without regarding any of the consequences? I don’t know how many HR incidents I have had to work through because someone didn’t take a moment to think. But, for all the people to develop a crush on, you could do a lot worse than a very dedicated, understanding teacher.”
The man with wheat hair suddenly appeared, speaking in rapid tones and holding onto Antonius like he could shield him with his thin body. The others seemed to calm down rather quickly and they soon put their weapons in a neat pile by the entrance. That did not stop them from giving him odd looks and murmuring to each other as they sat around the fire.
, because Tony was amazing in so many ways and he wanted to spend the rest of his life expressing that to him.
Steve? Steve with his heart on his sleeve? Steve who couldn’t resist picking a fight with a bully, even though he was a grown adult? Steve who couldn’t lie to save his life? Steve who could be a little shit and never saw a point in beating around the bush?
“So,” Steve drawled out, feeling nervous. Hopefully the nausea would go away soon. “Wanna go see a movie? Dinner? And not just because it’s Alpha’s Night?”
Tony hadn’t even noticed he finished the first cup, but … yeah. Two hours had gone by. He had gotten a lot done, which was nice, but wow. Time flew right past him. Those were two hours he was never getting back, and looking over his work, he wasn’t sure if they were spent well.
They should have known that going up nine floors without any more hiccups was too much to ask for. After they punched another hole into a maintenance closet, they realized that their coms were down. Captain America and the sniper clearly did not like the lack of outside support, but they seemed to roll with it.
“So,” Tony drawled after some relaxing silence. “We gotta think of a game plan here, sweetheart. You can’t hole yourself up in your room once a month for the rest of your life. I’m thinking we get you a decent doctor, do some tests, rule out any other underlying problems, and confirm if you’re an alpha or omega.”
Tony allowed the change in topic and turned back to the mess of electronic parts, explaining the problem that had been going on with the microchips in one of their latest products. He was giving the problem a go, seeing if he could give their engineers some more insight before they made changes and sent it through another batch of beta testers.
As promised, Mrs. Elison returned to the classroom a few minutes later, but Flash was nowhere to be seen.
“I know.” Steve sounded horrible, his voice strained. “I felt like I was coming down with a cold, but I was going to come anyways, but then I started feeling even worse by lunch.”
Giving food was a traditional courting gift. It went back thousands of years, apparently, when food could be scarcer or less reliable than it was these days. Being able to provide a mate with food or some sort of material security was still a desirable trait regardless if they were an alpha or omega. Steve also knew that Tony would appreciate something homemade.
“I’m not following,” Bucky said. “Why would he be going through a rut? He barely goes through heats! It’s impossible! He’s not an alpha!”
Tony shook his head. “Nope, we gotta be fair here if we want this relationship to work. Pepper has yelled at me enough for me to know communication should be a priority.”
Steve smiled at him appreciatively. “I keep telling them that. I’ve got a lot to catch up on, but this is a good start. I’m supposed to be getting some
Despite knowing the plan inside and out, dread and adrenaline ran through Steve’s veins. The room he was in was circular, completely made of stone, and hundreds of feet in the air. Guarded at all times, the sliver of a window barely allowed for any light to ever get inside. It was easily defended, hard to infiltrate. One wrong move and they could easily be cornered or fall. And in a few moments, he would be committing high treason. It was one thing to protest and encourage reform, to get into the faces of corrupt police officers and yell, but to do this—
“If anyone asks, I just say my parents couldn’t resist,” Steve protested. “It works. Most people just laugh.”
He wanted to hug Peter and bundle him up in a blanket and feed him chocolate forever. He had been through so much. Why did the universe keep knocking him down?
Tony used the distraction and ducked into a stairwell. There were others already going down the stairs, but the crowd was much thinner. There was so much empty space. So many openings for someone to shoot and only two ways go to: up or down.
Steve sighed then, as if he were going through some kind of torture. “It’s still demeaning. An omega doesn’t need to steal an alpha to prove they’re worthy or equal to an alpha. We do it all the time by literally doing all the things you guys do. Every day.”
“Nat, stop trying to kill people,” Sam grunted as he worked more flour into the dough. “It’s not funny.”
In the distance, there was a fiery explosion that shook everything, even the floor of the tower they were in. Men shouted, word spreading quickly of an attack.
This is a little personal, but I just wanted to write it out and put my thoughts/feelings into words, because this was something I did very deliberately:
If he threw it out there for the whole world to know, the tabloids might have a field day, but the person in love with him might realize this and fess up.
Perhaps it was the soft ocean-blue of his eyes. Perhaps it was his thin and skillful hands. Perhaps it was because he was stubborn and prone to proving himself when there really was no need to. Perhaps it was because when someone else would have killed Antonius when he first stumbled out of the burial mound, dirty and bleeding and marked by the gods, Stiofán reached out to him.
“And I got lots of experience with financial stuff, or at least, I can hook you up with someone if you need someone’s services.”
Peter’s cheeks reddened some more and he fumbled with his presentation board awkwardly. Steve helped him not trip over his feet and then proceeded to announce the next classmate.
“I know about Thompson,” Mr. Rogers told Peter. “I’ll be addressing that Monday morning with his parents. His behavior towards others is inappropriate and needs to stop. But we are focusing on you and your needs for now, okay?”
This latest meeting went smoothly. Everyone chatted, the numbers were all correct, and everyone was optimistic about the contracts that they would sign once their lawyers had one last look over them. It had been a good day, as far as good days at SI could go.
With everyone around him grumbling, and an old woman giving the man a glare, the guy started to look a bit pale.
He never thought he would be thankful for getting kidnapped in Afghanistan. It was the mother of all wake-up calls and he wished that so many people didn’t have to die for it to happen.
“Espresso with milk, cinnamon, and honey,” Natasha said. “A friend of mine told me about the drink he had while on a layover in Spain.”
As he left the meeting room, he was already texting JARVIS the necessary information and various emails were going to be waiting in his draft folders by the time he got … uh. Somewhere. Anywhere but where he had to listen to someone drone about numbers and he
After watching a few movies, Tony fell asleep on the couch. Steve texted everyone to let them know, and of the replies he got, everyone was more surprised than offended.
Over the next weeks, Antonius created and created: he made arrows, lengths of metal that could hold pieces of wood together, small parts that made the loom work better, and more.
Below them, nobles were partying like there was nothing wrong. Like thousands of their vassals and countrymen weren’t starving or wasting away in dark jails for petty crimes and the slightest insults to the king. Like their enemies weren’t looming on the horizon with armies and their allies were slowly slipping away, not wanting to be associated with their kingdom. Like they hadn’t betrayed—
Hearing this, as if he didn't care about how skinny he was or that he could more easily catch black lung than the average person who had, oh, he didn’t know, consistent access to clean water, decent food, and medical care …
strangled. The way Steve’s shoulders filled out that leather jacket, how it tapered down with his hips, was downright sinful. It was another Classic All-American Look and Steve just pulled it off effortlessly.
Whenever he mentioned that he hated the season, everyone always gasped, because weren’t artists supposed to love spring? The flowers and dew sparkling in the sunlight? The trees beginning to bud with fresh leaves after the long, harsh winter? All the colors?
Then, in a swift movement, Peter put the book on the counter and leaned over, hugging Steve tightly. “Thank you, thank you, thank you!”
Mr. Roger nodded, seemingly unfazed by Tony’s attempts at trolling. “Yes, I apologize for that. I wanted to discuss the subject fully in person. Sometimes emails don’t convey everything well. But first, I want to start on a positive note. Peter is a delight to have in my class. He brings many interesting points of views to our class discussions and I have always enjoyed his projects. Many of the directions he takes them in are quite original.”
“I know, Pep, but I swear, I went to bed last night and woke up like this. Unless I was sleepwalking, I didn’t do anything.”
“A little. I’m wondering about his intel, how he knows where to go and who to target. He’s got no support out there.” Steve started to busy himself with rearranging the cups under the counter. Tony could hear the soft clinks as Steve did his best to be careful.
In front of him were three large stones, coming up past his waist, with more of the swirled carvings. He had never seen such a style of carving before. It was wholly abstract and gave no clues as to its meaning or if it was meant to represent a god unknown to him. To his immediate right and left, high walls were made of dark gray stones—but only until the curve of the entrance ended. Beyond them, the rest of the walls were made of rounder stones that shone bright white in the sun. What should have been an impressive roof of more stones and walls was instead a mound of dirt, grass and flowers already beginning to grow. Eventually, he could predict, it would blend into what might be more hills and mounds in the surrounding area.
It was a lovely rendering of a nearby park, people milling about and the trees full of leaves. Nothing was defined or overly exact; the shading was kind of messy, but it gave the scene more dimension that way. Not quite
But now … Now those who meant the most to him were here, safe and sound. And from the looks of it, maybe two more than he expected.
“She promised that we would get to do an outdoor experiment with driftwood later this week,” he added. “So that will be something to look forward to.”
He hoped they wouldn’t fight about it. He hoped he would say some smooth line and everything would dissolve into a wonderful make out session.
This time, they were not heading to something that catered specifically to Peter’s strengths or interests. They were not even heading to some sort of school-wide event.
But why would he? He had money and lawyers and fame, and with those three things, people were willing to forgive and forget a lot.
The omegas didn’t prove anything by taking on alpha-like behaviors. They proved it by going to school and earning degrees, paying bills on time, volunteering to clean up a public park, taking second jobs to support their families, by being good partners through thick and thin, by being good friends and neighbors and helping those in need.
Tony had met Peter’s mother a little more than twelve years ago, during his wilder days, during one party or another. It was always his policy to be careful and safe, not wanting to burden a woman with a child he was expecting or landing his family (and later, company) with a scandal. No one deserved to have to be swept under the rug and god, no one deserved Howard’s wrath.
He followed the scent of coffee, sugar, and motor oil. It was a strange combination of scents, but he would recognize what Tony smelled like anywhere. He also got another strange scent—something acidic. Not like lemons, but … He couldn’t place it.
. He told me we’re going to talk about what’s been going on lately at school, but he didn’t want to talk about everything without you present, but I have no idea what else there could be to talk about besides suspension—”
Tony shrugged and focused back on the conversation instead of the mysterious sniper’s whereabouts. “What can I say? When you get kidnapped on a regular basis, it gets kind of boring. I also got some insider info about these guys too.”
Tony frowned, not sure what to expect. If Peter weren’t already in advanced course, he would assume Mr. Rogers was going to suggest accelerating him, like other teachers had before around the beginning of the school year. He
Pepper was in the penthouse waiting for Tony and Peter to come back home, wanting to see how he was herself. Fights were not unheard of, or even uncommon, in school, but Peter was like the nephew she never had. She wanted to hug him and send an army of lawyers after whoever thought it would be a wise idea to go after him in any way. She wanted them to rue the day they thought they could hurt Peter and reassure him he would always be protected.
While continuing to catch up, and offering more congratulations, Steve didn’t cough or sneeze any more flower petals. It was such a relief. While it was nice to have some sort of confirmation that his friends cared about him, he wished that the universe didn’t manifest signs of it through flower petals. He could see it in their expressions, hear it in their words, feel it through their actions. Why would he need the universe reminding him when he had all that?
Steve shrugged and spat a few more of the tiny flowers out into their bathroom sink. “I think they’re Natasha’s favorite. Maybe Bruce? I don’t keep track of this stuff.”
“Hey, J,” he called. “Find Jimmy’s family, see how they’re doing, and then find that reporter I keep ignoring. See if she has any evidence I don’t already.”
Peter’s class was having one of those project presentation nights. Specifically his history class. With Steve Rogers. The class with the teacher who was too hot to be real. Who was also too amazing to be real, because dear god, people like Steve didn’t exist anymore.
“It’s not like fine art doesn’t have a role in society,” Tony said. “I mean, I don’t get a lot of it, but there’s whole sections for it in bookstores for a reason, right? Some theory about humans and a need to create or express themselves?”
“But I am going to be right there with you,” Tony said. “One hundred percent. Whatever it takes. You are amazing and beautiful and you are one of
Steve mentally cursed, but refused to look up from his book. He could see Tony grin in his peripheral vision, but he refused to look any closer than that.
That brought out a laugh from him, more of a giggle really, but Tony was glad to hear it. He couldn’t help but lean in and plant big, loud, and silly smacks along his cheeks, which resulted in more laughs.
Tony wanted Steve to kidnap him on Alpha’s Night. He didn’t care if Steve wasn’t able to do it ‘properly’ by getting him into a fireman’s carry or even get down on one knee and propose with an expensive ring after breaking into his house. Tony wanted him to just do something on Alpha’s Night. He wasn’t sure of the exact reasons, but it might have to do with the fact that he saw Steve as an equal and wanted their relationship to start off with that equality.
“Yeah,” Peter said, still holding onto the book like it was a lifeline. “Thank you again, Mr. Rogers.”
Across that gaping abyss, he saw Captain America and the sniper look at him almost helplessly. They were covered in dust too, shrapnel causing them to bleed where it tore through their uniforms. He knew that he was likely bleeding too, but he was clearly too shocked to register any pain. He hoped there wasn’t anything life threatening at the moment.
“Hey, hey, we’re going to talk about this,” Tony said. “All parties. We’re gonna get the whole story, so don’t apologize yet, okay?”
JARVIS pulled up the public records that stated he was the father of a ten-year-old boy. His records had only
Steve held the door open for Tony and opened his umbrella before either of them stepped out into the rain. “One … two … three!”
He probably should have been more concerned with the potential for spilling the chemicals or getting caught up in some ‘horseplay’ and having his lab privileges taken away, but—
“Don’t be,” he said kindly, giving him a smile. “You were amazing out there. Just hang on until we can get to HQ. Then we can get some food in you.”
Natasha’s grin was downright evil. “A little cold doesn’t bother them, but humidity? Then they are nothing but the most pathetic of creatures.”
Rhodey sent a few photos of Tony absolutely disgusted as an apology when Steve coughed up a few marigold petals. The payback was worth it, though.
“No, no,” Tony interjected. “Let’s go with this and look at the facts. Ignoring everything we know about him, his symptoms sound just like a really bad rut, with territory issues and everything. We’ve all just assumed he was an omega. Has he ever been to a doctor to confirm?”
Tony was just at the other end of the counter, ducking out of another meeting. He really should buy some coffee, or even one of the in-house donuts, but the puns and lack of descriptions under the specials menu was taking up all of his thought processes. It was an eclectic grouping of names and he was sure that like
When they came back, the two of them were going back and forth with a level of ridiculousness she had never heard before.
But everything was now replaced with absolute dread. The letter in the inner pocket of his jacket burned against his chest, along with his thudding heart.
“Whoa, whoa! No way! I am not letting you get suspended!” Tony exclaimed. “If that was happening, he’d be bringing in the principal!”
“It’s good,” Tony said, taking another drink. “Classic, but not. Never heard of demerara sugar before though.”
All the plans, all the hopes and dreams, all the nervousness and having to gather the courage to approach an alpha in hopes they might go along with the kidnapping and then say yes in the morning for most of them to break an omega’s heart. Alpha’s Night was the one night where an omega could put their heart on the line and take the plunge instead of wait around for an alpha to take a hint and take them on a date themselves. Hell, half the time the omega chickened out or the alpha laughed in their face, because any omega who relied on Alpha Night must be deficient in some way.
Hopefully, he would get to the bottom of this. It was sweet, in a weird way, that his son wanted him to have a love life, but with his history teacher of all people? Sure, he had a crush on Steve. He was very crush-worthy. But this hyper-focus wasn’t like when he was on that old school NASA binge or when he wanted nothing but strawberry flavored cereal for a month.
Steve flushed, looking away. “It doesn’t matter. I know I’m not the … most desirable omega out there. I mean, I tried, but—”
That got a good laugh out of Mr. Rogers. “That’ll be the day! Really, with you as his dad, I think Peter is going to be just fine. Do we want to keep checking in, say, once a month?”
The next time he came into the coffee shop, ‘Tall, Blonde and Gorgeous’ was not at the register. Tony tried to hide his disappointment, but something must have shown, because the redhead behind the counter smirked at him as he came up. She was too gorgeous to be real as well, with flawless skin and wonderful bone structure. Her hair was cut short, but there was enough to display the natural curl in it. He glanced down and saw that her name tag said, ‘Natasha’. Did he miss the other guy’s name tag? At least his eyes were on his face as he thought about inappropriate things that were likely to get him sued.
Suddenly, an arrow with a suction cup at the end hit the wall right in front of him, missing him only by a hair.
Tony wondered if this was punishment for something, because if someone loved him, truly loved him, to the point where he would be coughing up flowers because of that love—surely they would gather the courage to tell him so he wouldn’t suffer like this.
The average human could jump about ten feet, if they had enough strength in their legs and a good running start. He would need about sixty feet if he wanted to make it and … yeah, that was not a possibility. It would be a huge risk, one he didn’t think he could make. Looking to the walls, he tried to figure out if there was some way he could climb over to them, but …
and his boyfriend was lounging around in nothing but a t-shirt and jeans. Okay, sohe was also wearing socks, shoes, and had a light sweater on the hat rack in the breakroom, but that was beside the point. Steve was comfortable and it was
God, he really hoped he could get to the bottom of this. He wanted to keep his promise to Yinsen and end this nightmare.
Pepper stared at the two of them for a moment. “Peter, why don’t we get some more ice on your lip and I plot some legal revenge, while your father orders some dinner? Your father can crush on your teachers all he wants, but it would be a legal nightmare for them to date.”
“Thank you, for everything you did,” Captain America said. “It was messier than the usual rescue, but it would have been worse if not for your quick thinking.”
“Sweet, sweet New York …” Tony sighed happily, almost pressing his window to the glass of the airplane’s window. “Thank god.”
“Yes. It’s usually caught before now, but if I recall correctly, Peter was in foster care for a few years before you adopted him?”
Steve held in his laugh as hard as he could, his shoulders shaking from the effort, but as soon as Tony started snickering, they soon dissolved into hard laughter. They managed to calm down a few minutes later, sides and lungs hurting.
The rest of his visit was filled with harassing one another, a lot of eye rolls, Tony avoiding paperwork, Pepper leaving copies of said paperwork all around his apartment, and then stealing Rhodey so they could catch up. Tony grumbled, of course, and muttered when Rhodey threatened to not bring him some dessert or let him have his leftovers from wherever they went.
—had been saying for weeks now. He didn’t even think he could peg the exact moment that turned it from a crush to love. No, seriously, when did it happen? Did it even matter if he remembered or not?
“You make sure you are never alone with him,” Tony begged. “We can’t trust him anymore. God, we should have never trusted him. Keep Happy around at all times, just in case.”
“But I had the umbrella! It was only polite! Besides, we’re friends! That wasn’t going to stop just because I wanted to court you!”
“We know some German and it’s a classic literary trope,” Bucky said, rolling his eyes. “Now shut up, this is getting good.”
“Yes, Steve,” Tony said gently, reaching forward and taking his book. Some pages were now bent, but it would live. Then Tony held his hands properly.
There was no getting dressed for corporate executives. There were no phones ringing off the hook for him. He didn’t even pull out his tablet—he had left it back at SI.
The rest of the movie passed with relative peace, until they stopped to get something to eat. Dinner ended up being an affair of leftovers and cobbling together random items from the fridge before they spoiled. Having fried pieces of pepperoni, ham, turkey, and chicken wasn’t the worst meal in the world, but Steve found himself craving chocolate.
“When you advertise that you have the first and only flush of a certain tea grown only on a certain mountain in China made a certain, special, secret way, but it turns out to taste just like PG Tips? That is when it becomes pretentious.”
“No. No nausea either, but I haven’t been able to check on him because he’s barricaded himself in his room.”
He must have looked around for a long while, because Bucky had that smug look on his face that only spelled trouble for him in the future.
“I am capable of many things,” she quipped back. “Those idiots are lucky to know how to roast and bake.”
Steve kept Tony in the loop, gave him regular updates about how Peter was doing in is class, and helped Tony figure out all of the information Tony was getting from all of the other teachers. He answered questions about IEP plans and if Peter would need a 504 plan. JARVIS filtered all of Steve’s messages at the highest priority and any phone calls never went to voice mail.
of all times? He knew Stane had to be stopped! He knew he had to do it himself, because if he went to the cops, he would weasel out of it unless there was damning evidence, and except for the file of the kidnapping, he had none! Tony could see him squirming out of that as well, saying he had no idea what the terrorists were saying and that they had to be mistaken, or that he’d only gone along with it in a failed attempt to get Tony back …
“I should have told you,” the man sneered. “I’d blast your brains out if you got out of that chair.”
Steve stopped in front of a terraced house. The door was painted black and framed by two columns. He recalled the differences between Italian and Greek columns. Unlike the house’s neighbors, these were definitely of Tuscan design. He shook his head and steeled himself even as his throat burned and his lungs struggled to work properly. He could do this. He had not marched up all the way from St. Giles to Mayfair for the fun of it. He did not avoid pickpockets, multiple propositions, and the suspicious eyes of coppers just because he had some fancy whim.
“I really like that department, though,” Tony said. “Being able to create and toss ideas around and solve problems … sure, I have to manage projects the company decides to do and not everything will be approved because ‘money’, but I like it better than paperwork and lawyers.”
“Hi,” Steve said, wishing he could pull Tony into his arms and kiss him. But that was a little hard to do right now. Tony stroking his head was really nice though.
His mind whirled. He couldn’t even focus on anything beyond that fact, even as Tony started to ramble.
He appreciated Stiofán’s story most of all: upon his birth, Stiofán was so weak and frail, that his original clan did not believe that he would live. His mother, loving him so dearly, used all of her powers and knowledge as a healer to keep him alive. The gods spoke to her, Stiofán explained, telling her of new medicines and herbs that aided his breathing. They did not know why the gods had cursed him with such a weak body only to keep him alive, but Antonius had a feeling that the strength of his limbs was put into the strength of his spirit.
Getting Steve into the shower took longer than expected for two reasons. One, because Steve was reluctant to let go of Tony, and two, because they had to attempt not to trip over the ‘remodeling’ he had done.
“I sent him to the principal’s office,” Mrs. Elison explained, as if she could read his mind. “I just wanted to check in with you. You okay?”
It spoke to how much comfort Steve needed when he immediately hugged Tony with a vice-like grip, burying his face in Tony’s chest. He felt feverish and was trembling and Tony frowned from how his hair was damp with sweat.
“Briefly?” Steve replied. “She knew Peggy better, but yeah, she and Antheil were a real help with radios.”
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Thompson, please sit down,” the secretary begged. “The principal will be here in a few minutes.”
A growl escaped his throat, but Steve didn’t bother to hold it back. He pulled out one of the many pens he had on him and signed the license before something could come along and prevent him from doing so. Knowing Tony, he likely had more copies in his bag.
That explained why no one came after him in the stairwell, Tony thought. Captain America and his partner probably used the fire alarm to their advantage. Good.
“Indeed,” Thor agreed. “Perhaps it has roots in the different ways the college education systems have developed, at least in comparison to Europe. Though how did you know about lilacs?”
“Is that why you’ve moved seats in class and are allowed to have your phone on your desk?” Ned asked. “Do those things help?”
Tony’s whole demeanor changed: his shoulders slumped; he looked down at the floor as he picked up a rag from a nearby table and started wiping his hands.
The man started to rant once more, his choice of words becoming more vulgar. A woman somewhere behind Tony gave a gasp and he knew some kid’s ears were being covered.
They had clearly given him power in their clan: though he had given Nat the arrowhead as a gift, she had returned it. He could see what would be happening in the future. If someone wanted or needed a tool, they would have to ask him to use it first. He would never refuse them the chance to bring more meat to the clan or sew a cloak, but that they would respect the tools he had made and thus respect him …
. Steve tried not to jump to any conclusions, but he felt a little warm inside, thinking that maybe, just maybe, Tony felt safe around him and knew he could be counted on.
“Kind of rotten,” Scott replied. “I’ve been trying to work on some engineering projects, but I keep sneezing my head off and having to clean up mountains of chrysanthemum petals!”
Tony blinked, pausing in his list of professionals to harass for resources and information. “Sure. Today or over the weekend?”
When they told their friends the good news, somehow, Clint pulled bottles of champagne out of nowhere and Pepper had glasses on hand. In the background, Natasha and Bucky exchanged money, but it was Bruce of all people who came away richer that night.
Steve then surprised him by leaning forward, baring his throat. Tony’s heart skipped a beat, but he leaned forward the rest of the way and nuzzled him, breathing in deep. Despite what Natasha said, he still smelled like summertime warmth and oranges.
At least Peter seemed to be taking the diagnosis better than he was. While Tony’s mind had been swirling with terms like ‘accommodation’ and ‘504 Plan’, Peter nodded along as the professionals discussed what could be done to help and answered all their questions as best he could. He didn’t put up a fuss, only zoned out twice, and fidgeted the whole time.
People were putting pumpkins on their stoops, everyone was going crazy over pumpkin spice lattes, and kids were starting to talk about Halloween costumes. Trees were beginning to turn colors, fog was setting in earlier at night and lingering longer in the morning, and now that the weather wasn’t trying to kill them, a lot more outdoor festivals were getting set up.
Tony had done his best to help: more alarms and reminders on Peter’s phone, a check list of items for Peter to confirm were in his backpack … but even JARVIS could only do so much.
Tony was pushed and prodded down a carpeted hallway until they reached a room with a few computers and not much else in it. There was a small window, but the blinds were shut. He couldn’t gleam much information from the hallway alone, but the walls lacked any cracks or crumbling plaster, and the carpet was rather clean, so this wasn’t some abandoned warehouse.
Tony was grateful that they were in a meeting room and not some sort of interrogation room. The bland beige walls and even blander impressionistic paintings were just what he needed to see after everything that happened in Dallas. He had yet to see the news, but he would eventually. When he could get his heart to calm down and he stopped being so jumpy.
He wanted the suit to be more than functional. He wanted paperwork to do itself. He wanted Rhodey to not have to go on such long tours all the time or for Pepper to deal with such long meetings. He wanted to be prepared for when he took the armor out. He needed the suit to be absolutely perfect, none of this flying into a heap of sand and waiting for some miracle (Rhodey) to come pick him up. Besides, Tony was sure that he was out of miracles and—
“You are currently in your bed, sixty centimeters from the end, thirty centimeters from the left edge,” JARVIS replied. “You appear to be approximately seventeen centimeters long.”
“I—I thought—” Steve swallowed, obviously trying to sort his thoughts. “I wasn’t sure what I thought. I always assumed I would never be appealing to anyone. I mean, you guys tell me all the time … but Bucky’s like a brother and everyone else is my friend. You’re
“What?” she asked, grinning. “Can’t I appreciate and adore my friends? At least sunflower petals are edible! Put them on a salad!”
, JARVIS said, not saying that Tony had already asked him to do so. That was nice of him. He wasn’t thinking straight. It was good that someone was. His hands were shaking so badly. He had to stop Stane. He was overreacting. Putting everyone on high alert and moving them out of the country would tip someone off. But he had to protect—
Steve had given him his number and while Tony didn’t have the courage to start texting him yet, he did send Steve a starter message so he could be added to his contacts.
Around them, some people were starting to get a little bored. There was more rustling, more murmuring. Tony munched on some popcorn and glanced over at Steve, only to have their eyes meet. In the dim light, he could feel his cheeks flush. Steve looked a little embarrassed too.
The coffee was good. It wasn’t as bitter as a cappuccino, cut with milk, but it didn’t have any foam like a cappuccino. It was sweeter than a latte, but … the flavor was different than if he had added sugar or simple syrup. Huh. He didn’t see him go for any of the flavorings. Tony took another drink, chasing the flavors, trying to figure out what it was.
And there was something in the way that Tony spoke and moved that seemed like he was putting on some kind of front. Like he was disappointed.
presentation. Despite what everyone thought, he knew all about the figures, projections, and estimates. He could predict how some of them would go, with minor adjustments.
As a beta, Tony didn’t have to deal with heats or ruts himself, but he always tried to be there for those who did. Sometimes it was as simple as ordering take out for his friends, other times, it was as complicated as looking through all of SI’s policies with some lawyers to give everyone equal protections as employees. Everyone’s experiences differed, from the lengths to the symptoms, but as far as he could tell, few people had a pleasant time.
kind of surprise. Tony was still trying to wrap his mind around it, trying to figure out some way to
Bucky smirked and went over to the coffee machine, making Tony’s order. “Just because you don’t get them, doesn’t mean they’re lame.”
Captain America was shaking his head, but it looked like he was trying to hold back a laugh. Okay. They were used to this. Gun fights and war zones and killings. He had to remember that they literally came out of fighting a war that changed history. This was normal for them.
Bucky and Sam were laughing their heads off. Natasha looked like a cat that got a bowl full of milk and a cage full of canaries. Steve was blushing hard again.
So, he explained as best he could. Stiofán nodded along. It was obvious that he did not understand everything, but that he was willing to listen, made Antonius’ heart warm.
Steve winced at the rain that was coming down like buckets. His day had not gone any better. Due to the rain that had started earlier that morning, traffic had been worse than usual, resulting in him nearly being late. And also, he burned the pie.
Building it, testing it, and taking it out to fly had been some of the best moments of his life. Here he was, doing what he was meant to do: creating. Sure, he had been creating things since he was six. Maybe earlier, he didn’t have the best memory going that far back. The flashing lights of cameras, the glamorous parties overflowing with drinks, and all of the other vices he’d indulged himself in were … not mistakes, but he hadn’t learned the lessons he should have quickly enough.
Near the mouth of the cave was a fire pit that allowed for light and warmth to come into the rest of the cave. He also could make out shelves where bread was stored above ground and a loom away from the fire. In the back of the cave were more supplies hanging on the walls, put on more shelves of wood tied together with leather strings, and a niche carved into one of the walls. He could not tell what was inside it. He knew better than to look.
“Looks like you found our discussion board,” Mr. Rogers said. Tony jumped and spun around to see Mr. Rogers looking at him sheepishly. “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you.”
Steve felt his cheeks straining from how wide his smile was. His heart thudded wildly in his chest, he was so deliriously happy.
“And then he took one of my books,” Peter mumbled, wringing his hands. “Then he tore some pages out of it.”
Then Stane happened and he had to forget about the parties, the drinks, and so many other aspects his wealth ‘afforded’ him. The betrayal had been a huge wake up call. He needed to think about the future—beyond stock markets and sales and what outrageous headline he could get printed next. He needed to get his head out of his ass, because he couldn’t be blind anymore. Not when his inattention
Steve was a wonderful friend. So were their now mutual group of friends, even though their busy schedules reduced them to texting and phone calls more often than actually meeting in person. Maybe all Steve wanted was to be friends and ignoring Tony’s flirting was his way of politely letting him down and not rocking the boat of their friendship too much.
“Idiots!” some commander or another shouted. “Leaving the dungeon undefended! I’ll have their heads!”
“Alright. Food it is,” he said, walking out into the hallway with Steve. “And something in black and white?”
Of course, my grandparents on both sides of the family grew up in this era, so my parents easily could have learned this slang and then they passed it onto me.
. He had weird quirks and habits, was not the best at communicating at times, he could be such a snarky little shit, and … and yeah. He was dating Steve Rogers.
Mr. Rogers was quiet for a moment. “He’s lucky to have you. I’ve had parents outright dismiss my concerns and seen the students suffer for it.”
Pepper was already on her phone. “I’ll order some of Steve’s other favorite foods. I know an excellent bakery that’s close by.”
He tried his best to move quietly, but with how empty the hallways were, it felt like even his breath was echoing. They were setting a pace he could keep up with, not that he couldn’t keep up with their typical pace, but they hardly knew that he was training himself to be more than a typical technological giant living off royalties and martinis. While the slower pace was making him nervous, it was allowing him to look around the building some more.
Bruce came in about an hour later. Tony had finished half of the nuts and some water Natasha poured into another bowl. It was awkward and a little humiliating, but surviving this was a little more important than what little dignity he had left.
Looking around some more and refusing to go too far from where he was, Antonius realized he was standing in the entrance of a mound. A burial mound. He not only had entered the realm of the gods, but he had traveled through the sacred resting place of the dead. The dead of people he did not know, of gods he did not know. He shook with fear.
Tony laughed. “Exactly. But I’m sorry I got grease on your painting. I know how hard it is to make something, no matter what the end product turns out to be.”
As Steve continued to laugh his head off, Scott’s mutterings turned from annoyed to promises of never having a reliable internet connection ever again.
“But he never did it in this class before, now did he?” MJ asked. She had a pleased look on her face and Peter knew she was going to draw everyone’s shocked expressions later.
It would be worth it, though. If Peter got the help he needed, if he was able to learn skills and get tools to help him succeed in school and manage other areas of his life better, if it would help him adjust so he smiled more and worried less about lost headphones or incomplete assignments, Tony would sit in a hundred boring meetings back-to-back. He would go to hell for his kid.
“It is being repaired by the librarians,” Mr. Rogers said. “I was able to locate it in the hallway after the fight was broken up and they were brought to the front office.”
Steve closed his eyes and enjoyed the warmth of Tony’s hand as the narration for Beauty and the Beast began, the piano playing in the background.
Steve’s hands shook. He just couldn’t comprehend … he just couldn’t and his tongue was stumbling over itself, trying to figure out how he wanted to say something in English when it wanted to come out in Gaeilge. A part of him had hoped he meant every word of that letter, every syllable of waxed poetry and longing and devotion. The promises of fidelity and assurances of sincerity, of how if they could just meet and talk, all would be well.
He held up a finger. “Nope. You’re going to get an email from me. So will some other key people throughout the company. Act accordingly.”
The professor lodged complaints, but given that no one was breaking any rules and were doing their assignments, the counselors could hardly find grounds for punishment. Class meetings led to study sessions which led to going to the movies, which led to Steve meeting some of the best friends in his entire life (besides Bucky).
He scribbled down a note to look into that and JARVIS filed it away. Perhaps he needed to probe his company a little. Look for new, mysterious servers or emails with certain trigger words or if someone was working odder hours than he was.
As the commotion grew louder, Antonius approached the entrance and looked out. He had been designing another kind of arrow, one that could stay attached to the shaft without leather string or needing to be taken off for cleaning. It could allow them to carry the arrows on their back and reduce damage. Normally, nothing would have pulled him away from creating, but he could have sworn …
Rhodey’s eyes darted down to Tony’s chest for a moment, but he quickly covered up whatever he was thinking or feeling. Tony let it slide too. He was only back for a short time, probably. He didn’t want to spend the time moping around or angsting. Brooding? Either way, he wanted to spend his time laughing, sharing jokes, maybe a few rounds at a bar. Watch a horrible movie and making Pepper groan at all the popcorn they threw around the penthouse living room. Buy a Roomba at an ungodly hour, reprogram it, and watch it zoom around better than before.
If there was an alpha that Steve would attempt to kidnap on Alpha’s Night, or meticulously plan so the kidnapping would be successful, Tony would be the one.
Heat flooded his cheeks and he hastily returned back to his book, even though he couldn’t tell a single word apart.
was that a look of disappointment. Those eyebrows. “I don’t like that. Not to mention it’s really late. Have you been working all night?”
Peter was doing wonderfully. There were some hiccups, some added stress because of class changes and medication reactions, but they all worked through them.
They might have taken his phone, but he doubted they got into it or even noticed that JARVIS was running. Not that they would have seen him even if they did get in. Huh. He wondered why someone didn’t wake him up, demanding his passcode. Did they make a clone? He was going to have to massively scrub it or trash it altogether. He wouldn’t even risk making a backup.
Sure, they had seen him at his worst, but he was getting better. Not just because he wanted to clean up his public image. Not because he wanted to prove total strangers wrong.
Bruce gave him a look. “Monks don’t give away their tea blends to American corporations. It would take away the reason why they make the blends in the first place.”
Steve grinned and nudged him with his elbow, giving him a sly grin he had seen on everyone else’s face all week. The one that included the waggling of eyebrows and unspoken suspicions of romance and goo-goo eyes and lovey-dovey stuff. Not that he understood why they were doing it, but if they couldn’t take what they were giving, oh well.
was the one trying to deny it: he was falling in love with Steve. He’d crossed that line a long time ago, like everyone else—Pepper, Bruce, Sam, Bucky, Rhodey,
“The therapy sounds okay,” Peter said, after it was explained that it would be behavioral therapy, not something akin to Freudian head shrinking. “It’ll be like a life coach.”
Tony held out a handkerchief, which Steve took gratefully as he wiped his eyes and face, trying to take in a breath. It was hard, though, because he wanted to cry his heart out. He and Bucky needed the work, the job, the recognition. If they didn’t make rent, then they would be kicked out onto the streets, and sure, it was little better than their current conditions, but autumn and winter would be here soon enough and with his health …
Tony nodded in agreement and enjoyed his muffin. It took some talking afterwards (and a lot of kisses he was happy to give and receive), but they concluded that okay, they had some emotional hang-ups they needed to work through, but it was better if they worked through them together, and the short-lived Hanahaki case was completely unneeded.
Before he could second guess himself, Steve stood on his toes and grabbed Tony’s shirt, pulling him down into a kiss. Tony’s arms came around him, holding him close, and oh, that felt nice.
“You don’t eat what you make,” Natasha said with the most serious face he had ever seen her don. “That is for fools and idiots, of which I am neither.”
Fun fact: following the ‘write what you know’ rule can be really fun, because you can insert all sorts of random things into the most unusual places, and it makes for a really interesting story.
She sighed and crossed her arms. Walking across the room, she pulled the screwdrivers out of his mouth and hand.
of all places. Thank goodness they were on the same page about being as vague as possible, should anyone be listening. “Kiddo. It’s a bad idea.”
“True, but you might be a little biased. While you heard the struggles of a loved one, Darcy was hearing a broken record. But I heard you two got back together?”
“Huh,” he said aloud as he looked over the different handwriting. The sticky notes were colorful and over-sized, perfect for those with longer questions or messier scrawls.
“Knowing you, you’re going to think too much about it and make it complicated. Just don’t blow something up.”
Sometimes he had to take extra-long business trips around the world. Sometimes he had to work long hours on weekends and holidays. Some nights he felt that weight pressing down on his chest; some nights he felt glad he could actually do something.
“Oh, right there,” Steve said, leaning his hand into Tony’s. He didn’t even know he had an inch there, but it was likely all the fur. Something was bound to get irritated.
Steve reached up and shifted, pulling Tony closer, so their foreheads touched. “I’m sorry. I’m okay, I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
Such as that pipe wrench. It totally would be missed. It belonged to my great-grandfather. I would hunt someone down for that wrench. Even if it helped save the world.
He would probably be called in sooner or later. They would need his side of the story to collaborate with Mrs. Elison’s report, right? But what if Flash twisted it around or threatened the family lawyers again? What if—
“It’s still demeaning. An omega doesn’t need to steal an alpha to prove they’re worthy or equal to an alpha. We do it all the time by literally doing all the things you guys do. Every day.”
Tony wondered how differently people were going to regard Steve. How many places he would no longer be welcomed, how many people would edge away from him … Alphas had a somewhat bad reputation, with the common assumptions that they were brash and forceful, had bad tempers, and used their instincts as excuses for doing whatever they wanted. Sure, omegas had their own damaging stereotypes, but Steve was going to have so much to adjust to.
Tony narrowed his eyes, not sure if he should be offended or not. The bowl wasn’t full of peanuts, but a spicy mixed nut blend. All sorts of stuff that was probably good for your heart, if not for the sodium content. “Since when do you know anything about squirrels?”
He wasn’t expecting anyone, so maybe it was a package. Bucky or Natasha could be expecting something, or maybe Sam got off work early and forgot his keys again.
Tony groaned and ran a hand through his hair. Now he was thinking about holding Steve and Steve holding him in a variety of scenarios. Great. Lovely.
Yeah. The drug was still messing with his head if he was thinking his life was currently playing out a Saturday morning cartoon episode. Pity they hadn’t used ropes to tie him; the zip ties meant that they were a little more forward thinking than a typical mad scientist.
There was unpredictable weather. Tomato plants not protected by frost cloths were killed overnight even though it was past the last average frost date. One minute, it was bright and sunny. Then, suddenly, everything was soaking wet because the weatherman assured the population that there would be no freak thunderstorms. They should have known better.
Steve shifted, sitting closer to him, so their legs were touching more. It was nice, being grounded like that.
He was going to say ‘understand’, but then Tony whipped out a piece of paper from his bag and slapped it down on the table in between them.
“With the works,” Tony grinned, holding up two delicious smelling bags. His own stomach was growling with the need for grease and salt. He had run all the way from the burger joint to the library, wanting to maximize the time he had with Steve. Maybe hour lunches were good for something after all.
He prayed. He prayed for mercy. He didn’t want revenge. Ovadyah could do whatever he wanted. His power would only last for as long as he could control the people he gave the tools to or managed to bribe with whatever wealth he managed to collect or steal. But unless he found a more clever way of maintaining power than through fear, the warriors would eventually rebel against him. They would want more power, too.
He was still uneasy about Peter being bullied. He wouldn’t let the matter drop forever, but at least he knew about it and knew a name to go after first should anything happen to Peter, physically or emotionally.
Pepper looked surprised for a moment before she started smiling. “Please tell me it was that barista—Steve, right? Bruce keeps saying that every time you see him, it’s like you’re walking on sunshine.”
However, as he was dropping off some groceries before heading out again, there was a knock on the door.
It was too much. There was literally four inches of table separating their hands. He could see the curve of his eyelashes, the quirk of his lips. God, he could really notice the
A week later, a cold front made the whole city chilly. There was frost on the windows, slush in the streets, and fogging breaths everywhere.
, something he had not experienced in a long time. Tears started to prickle in his eyes. He wished—there was so much he still had to do, to atone for—
“Nice job,” the sniper praised, his garbled voice still odd to Tony’s ears. He and Captain America looked winded now. How many goons were waiting for them on the roof? How long had it taken them to take them all out?
Somehow, Captain America got him that cup of coffee, before going to get cleaned up. The coffee was awful, tepid and bitter, absolutely nothing like Steve’s. But he drank it anyways, holding onto the paper cup like a lifeline.
A smile broke out over Tony’s face and his eyes shone brightly. He swung Steve up into his arms, practically off his feet, and kissed him. Steve pressed his body to Tony’s, barely holding back a moan, as Tony held onto him close. He pulled away, needing air.
not knowing what this was going to be about. Why did his teacher have to be so vague? Why had he only sent a physical note? Why not some sort of lengthy email that he could have JARVIS pick apart?
Natasha reached over and placed her hand on one of Bucky’s, which calmed him down a fraction. It was still better than nothing.
Tony’s hands shook. Steve had a lot of aliments that lingered from childhood, but he was getting healthier. He was getting stronger. Anyone who knew Steve longer than Tony could attest to this. His asthma wasn’t knocking him out as much anymore, his scoliosis was gone, and even Bucky commented he recovered from colds easier. But it was still a fear of Tony’s that something would come around and take him away for good.
Tony never had one sleep schedule or any other kind of consistency. It led to a lot of interesting moments and some downright crazy ones, but being texted around three in the morning about a revolutionary new idea was kind of tame.
Steve knew there were thousands, millions of parents like Tony Stark. He just wished there were more of them.
