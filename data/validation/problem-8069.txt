“That — That’s exactly what I was going to do this evening, too.” The stranger said as he referred to someone else. “I told myself that I had to tell him the truth and confess my feelings for him, regardless if he returned them or not.”
───────
On the inside, admittedly, Tony knew that Rhodey was right, even if he really wanted to disagree with him. He knows that he doesn’t have as much common sense as his friends but he didn’t need Rhodey or Pepper to come bursting through his apartment and lecturing him for a good hour or two. They may have more common sense than the average person but Tony had his own reasons for not wanting to take up the job offer.
“Oh… But what you said about me, Steve — have I really been ignoring you that much?” Tony’s eyes started to water. “Oh my fucking god. Look, I’m really, really, sorry about avoiding you, it’s just—“
“I don’t find you bothersome,” Steve tried to soothe him.
The room appeared to be infinitely crowded with outsiders from different kingdoms, and even different lands. Bodies, limbs, and masks spilled into every cranny and nook of every corner of the castle’s grandest ballroom. There was already a classical song playing, performed by the kingdom’s royal orchestra and many people were already paired up as they drifted across the marble-tiled dance floor. An exquisite, diamond chandelier embellished with assorted rubies and sapphires dangled above everyone’s heads, bathing the party in a dreamlike luminescence that made the shadows casted within the area under it, a wine-purple. The illumination of the light overhead reflected off the varying and unique masks of the people gyrating across the glossy ground, onto the walls around them in splashes of sparkles, almost like stars.
“Babe?”
Steve observed that the atmosphere had immediately plummeted when he entered the room. The royal sentries who were guarding the Americandian castle’s main entrance, all dropped down to one knee and the guests within the room followed their example by bowing down before the prince.
“We would,” Tony stated nonchalantly without taking his eyes off of his boyfriend’s lips.
“Doesn’t matter,” Steve murmured into Tony’s ear, drowning out the cars and the wind in the background. “I’m going to repeat it every second of every single day, if that’s how I have to remind you how much I love you… — I love you.”
“coglione” - asshole
Steve gave his consent, reluctantly, “Okay. I promise.”
The prince gaped at his friend, the dressed-up General of the Americandian Royal Guards, who was holding the hand of a lady that he almost didn’t recognize.
! You function perfectly fine at 6 AM! Otherwise, Steve wouldn’t have said that he loved your
They played more games, — Tony absolutely destroying the physics-based ones, — and won even more prizes — all of which they had to deposit into the trunk of Tony’s Chevrolet Corvette before they headed off to the main attraction of the carnival.

Maybe in a couple of years, after Tony had really saved enough to be able to do whatever he liked on his own, he’d finally get back at Howard for all that his dear-old-dad has done to him. And there was a lot that Tony had in mind. Screw trying to make Howard proud - he gave up that long ago when he realized that Howard Stark was practically incapable of loving anyone else other than himself - right now, all he wanted was justice.
Rogers merely sat on one of the plush leather couches and licked his lips while he set the empty plate on the coffee table in front of him.
“Alright then,” Pepper smiled as she closed his office’s door. “Good luck with the rest of them, I’ll be back in a few hours to check up on you.”
“And don’t think that I’m scared of you or your little ‘football captain, boyfriend bodyguard,’ Tony!” Tiberius turned to Steve and snarled. “Just because you’re the football captain of Columbia doesn’t mean that I’m sc—“
Surprisingly, there were a handful of students older than him scattered around and in-between the shelves, lying in beanbags or sitting upright at various tables, all reading books from their respected section. Coming from a university dedicated to the most recent scientific and technological advancements in the world, Tony was honestly astonished to be actually seeing some of its students reading fantasy and teen-fiction books.
Bucky let out an awkward chortle.
Tony honestly believed that there was absolutely no fucking possible way, —
Tiberius Stone. Oh, shit.
“Hey!” Rhodey just had to abruptly appear at this time. “Sorry for interrupting whatever’s going on here, but Steve, Director Fury was looking for you last night.”
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
Holy fucking shit.
Clint suddenly spoke up, “How’s Steve going to reach Tony?”
“Oh, Steven…” His mother cast him a dismayed expression. “Please have a little more confidence, darling — maybe he really is meant for you, and you just don’t realize it yet. Even if the two of you don’t work out, there are still plenty of fish left in the sea, honey.”
“No!” Tony exclaimed, his whole body quivering. “This isn’t perfect because I just forced all of my feelings onto you and I didn’t even think about how you would react and—“
“Actually I do, because it means just as much as it does to me
Just so y’all know, currently, Tony is 23 while Steve is 25 in this story.
Clint grudgingly allowed Bruce to watch over the bowl and slumped, slightly miffed, back against the couch, next to Sam and Bucky.
“Sure,” Steve acknowledged him while the rest of the Avengers chomped noisily on popcorn.
But even in Tony’s favorite books, everything must have an eventual end to it. Pulling apart was like separating two magnets — hard and reluctant-to-go — but their human bodies were too greedy for oxygen for them to dismiss.
time. For you.”
Bucky’s disappointed glare softened as he slowly approached Steve’s desk.
Steve lifted his hand to tuck back a short strand of brown hair behind the brunet’s ear.
“What, why?”
“Tony?” He furrowed his eyebrows. “Are you alright? Was it something I said?”
why the lead role is suddenly so important.”
Tony looked at him puzzled and wriggled out of Steve’s grasp.
“Hey… Look at me — This is perfect because all that stuff that I was chattering away about this extraordinary human being… Well, it was all about you, Tony.”
The blond was encased in a thankful, optimistic, rush of reassurance.
“I — I truly can’t tell if it’s disgust, or if it’s irritation, or maybe even hatred, or possibly even all three of them combined — No, wait, I take that last part back.” The masked-figure shook his head. “He’s too perfect… He’s just too good of a person to ever hate anyone, even if it’s someone as troublesome as me.”
“That’s definitely interesting. You know about this place, too?” The stranger suddenly asked.
“I love him so much, and we’ve been such good friends — maybe even more at some times, — for so long that it hurts whenever I look at him and remember that he’s still not mine, yet. It pains me whenever I have to call out his name but I still can’t ever add the word, ‘love’, to any of the sentences that I say to him. Even in my dreams, I can never muster up the courage to admit my feelings for him and ironically, I suffer for it so fucking much, both in the real world and in my imagination.”
“Tony. Shut up.”
The brunet sighed happily, “This is so fucking perfect, Steve. I mean — just how? How did you manage to do all of this — for me?”
Tony grinned, his eyes twinkling with mischief, “How about, by-the-second? After all, my wish is your command.”
“Patriotic-my-ass.” He heard the genius mumble under his breath. “The only thing patriotic about them are how ugly they make your kingdom.”
Nat nodded in mock-agreement, “What he said.”
Tony’s most recent ex was the same person who was playing the person that Alexander Hamilton cheats on Eliza with: Maria Reynolds.
The blond looked down at his boyfriend sprawled on the ground with an amused look — God, he loved this man — before replying in a soft and tender voice.
“Hey, sweetheart?” Steve called out to the brunet who was currently lounging on the couch with the other Avengers, waiting for Bruce to finish making the popcorn before the team started their annual Christmas movie night. “Can you come over here for a second?”
Steve sighed with an undeniable smile on his face.
, Steve. You haven’t mentioned anything about him to me in so long, that your persuasiveness just doesn’t feel
─────── ♡ ───────
So Rogers knew his last name, and now he definitely knew that he was related to Howard and his glorified empire of 5-star restaurants. Wonderful.
“Surprisingly, I could say that my situation is almost exactly the same as yours.”
For an instant, Tony was almost completely convinced that he was dreaming. Or maybe he had left Earth, altogether.
Tony apprehensively came out of his hiding place as he ran over to where he had last seen the blond.
Ouch.
, Tony thought.
Steve watched from behind the curtains as the story progressed through the musical and couldn’t help but stare along with the audience as Tony conquered the entire performance, altogether. The brunet truly was made to be out in the open, in the public eye; born to be awed and admired as he was both a natural on camera and on stage. Even though tonight was the university’s very first open performance night, Tony was still nailing every song spot on, and his raw talent unanimously captivated the audience’s attention and every person observing him from backstage.
He heard the other laugh, and he knew very well that Steve had probably just read his mind according to the unmistakable shade of pink on his face.
Accepting defeat — and with the encouragement of his family and friends, Steve stepped onto the pristine, white floor and was immediately swarmed with impatient women, eagerly awaiting him to choose someone to dance with. Ignoring them, he pushed his way past the bodies flooding around him and scanned the room for a dark-brunet prince.
He instantly knew what to do.
Sighing in defeat, Tony leaned against his kitchen counter with his eyes carefully watching his baking
“He keeps distancing himself from me, what more proof do I need waved in front of my face for me to realize that he doesn’t want to be around me, anymore?” The mystery-person asked no one in particular. “I guess he still tolerates being near me, but it doesn’t feel the same — it doesn’t feel the way it used to, back when we were younger.”
“heavenly,” was an understatement.
, he scolded himself. But Steve knew that even he, himself, didn’t believe his own words.
“Can’t wait.”
Steve nodded grimly.
“Of course.”
He was nowhere to be found.
“I’ve been living with you guys for 5 years now, Tony. I think I know how to be careful. Especially around those two.”
pounds is not ‘barely changed! Before you know it, your metabolism is going to fucking eat your entire body up!”

But as he waited outside of Steve’s Art, Culture, and Technology (ACT) classroom, Tony suddenly realized that he just couldn’t do this.
“Celestial.”
Laughing uncontrollably, Tony wiggled under his boyfriend’s grasp but wasn’t able to shake him off.
All throughout high school, the blond just assumed that it was just some stupid crush but he knew for absolute certain that his crush was way too big so for some middle school fling. And after his first year of college, when he asked his other friends about whether or not it was normal for someone to feel this way, almost all of them confirmed that he was crazily—and idiotically—in love. Although, in Steve’s opinion, their brutally-honest assurance wasn’t really helpful in his desperate situation.
The brunet sighed, “‘Right. Bye Honeybear.”
“I miss him being there for me — after college, after going to the gym, after a god-awful day — I miss him being there, not to comfort me because he knows that I have boundaries, but to just lend me his presence because he knows that that’s what I need the most in the end. I miss everything about him, but it was just his simple
“Sure, why not?” Steve grinned, amused by Tony’s directness. “How about tomorrow, at 9?"

Tony Stark >> I’m so sorry Steve
Steve felt a flicker of hope ignite in his chest. But it didn’t last very long, and neither did the surge of confidence that had accompanied the flash of hope.
And when the
Everyone spilled into the room without a word and when Sam shut the door, Steve urged Pepper again.
you’ll be stuck with me and the rest of the team for the rest of your life.”
“In the kitchen; go through that doorway,” Rogers pointed in the direction of his kitchen and Tony immediately strode in its direction.
Steve looked at him nonchalantly, “Everything.”
The red-headed assassin shrugged as she blew at her cup of freshly prepared hot cocoa, “Well, at least you learned your lesson. I’m just surprised that you didn’t even try to prank them back.”
The redheaded-queen raised an eyebrow at him but gestured her understanding with a flick of her hand as she dragged a cackling Bucky away in the opposite direction.
“Woah,” Tiberius sneered mischievously at Tony’s small but defensive form. “Chill, Tones. I just wanted to congratulate you on your

“I love you. Just so you know.”
Steve just laughed under his breath, shaking his head, and went back to cuddling Tony while watching the movie.
and picked up his phone, tapped the screen a few times, and held it up to his ear.
“Of course,” Steve beamed. “How else am I supposed to express my love for you, sweetheart?”
“carpaccio di manzo” - beef carpaccio
“Why?” She asked straightforwardly, curious at what Steve had come up with in his head. “Why do you plan on kissing him instead of just instantly apologizing?”
Apparently, the brunet was just not aware of his own feelings enough to actually notice his quickened heartbeat whenever he cheerfully chatted hours away with Steve, or his heightened senses whenever the blond accidentally brushed his shoulder against his while they were walking to their afternoon classes side-by-side.
“Tony, calm down,” Steve laughed as the brunet grabbed his arm in impatience. “The callbacks just got posted; I’m not sure if this is even the official casting list.”
“Yeah, that’s right! Tony got told last night but when the talent scout went to go tell you the good news, you had disappeared and no one knew where you had gone so I told the the talent guy that I would tell you about this opportunity first thing tomorrow morning.”
Tony, his best friend for who
Nostalgia and memories of Tony’s complicated childhood filled his head as the two of them wandered through the fair, exploring each one of the possible money-scammers and time-wasters that were practically calling out each person’s name at the carnival, beckoning them to come over and blow away their cash at games that were physically and mathematically-impossible to win. Unless you were a blond football player that was a fucking god at basically every sport that ever existed, of course.
The brunet innerly groaned in frustration; no decent chef could even think of cooking in such a high-tech kitchen if it was this dirty. If Rogers is expecting for Tony to prepare his some food worthy of his money and status then Tony would have to let him know that he’d need to at least clean up the kitchen first if he wanted to use the many alluring kitchen appliances and tools that littered around the room; they were practically beckoning Tony’s name and his fingers itched to finally grasp a hold of them, especially that coffee-machine. It probably had a whole AI built into it that announces when a person’s coffee is ready in a steamy female voice. Maybe Tony should stop imagining everything in a millionaire’s kitchen to have a voice and a thought process - some ideas invented in the kitchen were just never meant to be.
He wasn’t sure how long he could keep this mask up to conceal against the uncontrollable swell of emotions inside his chest.
“Yeah…”
“Absolutely,” Rhodey smiled at the couple and pretended not to notice their fingers beginning to lace within each other’s. “All sound good?”
“I don’t regret ever loving you but I do regret never telling you how much I loved you before… before leaving you.” Steve halted and caught his breath but his passion drove him on. “I know you don’t want to hear me apologize and you never liked me pleading with you either, but right now it’s the only way I can explain how I could love you so much but leave at the same time. I never left. Listen to me, Tony, please, because I never truly left you. I never truly left you because you had never truly left me, ever. In all of my fucking pathetic life, you never left my side, you were always there for me; physically or just in my heart, you were consistently there for me, supporting me, encouraging me,
Steve cocked an eyebrow at him and laughed lightly, his voice filling in the silent void of the library, and ultimately making Tony’s train of thought crash into about a million trees.

“Why don’t you just see for yourself, Tones?”
“Hold on,
It was odd to see such a rich and famous person willingly help out his own personal chef to clean up his kitchen and frankly, Tony was still a little skeptic about Steve’s behavior but for some reason, the brunet just couldn’t shake off the realization that Steve Rogers was genuinely a good person. In fact, he’s probably one of the most down-to-Earth rich people that Tony’s ever met and Tony’s met a lot of rich
Steve perked up and scrunched his eyebrows in confusion.
Steve rolled his eyes, “For the last time, Tony, it’s patriotic! It’s the colors of our kingdom, so personally, I think that there should be more flowers than what we currently have now.”

“WHAT THE FU—!”
The younger prince stared up at him obediently.
“Hey, Steve! It’s Bucky!” One of the masked-figures shouted in his face.
It felt like his personal laboratory at the university and he thrived in it. The brunet knew that he had always worked best under pressure; his brain just automatically pushed harder and more efficiently for certain ideas while under the careful judgement of others — it started doing that as soon as he had learned how to build his first engine, when cruel and controlling Howard began to constantly lean over his shoulder, watching Tony, as his son built away in his utopia of inventions and machines. And predictably, six-year old Anthony Edward Stark, would be desperate for his father’s approval and purposely performed better whenever Howard was watching him. But e stopped trying after two years.
“Hm? Just what?” Tony mumbled, his eyelids drooping, slightly.
There was no way that Steve would go to his grave, before he had found a way to show Tony how much he truly cared for him. If only he had the courage to act upon his feelings before he loses any more chances. But to the blond, it may already be too late.
“I would do anything just to see him smile again, just to hear him laugh again, I would literally do anything.”
“I told him that someone was here to see him,” She informed Steve’s tense form. “Go get ‘em, tiger.”
“merda” - shit
The orchestra started cleaning their instruments and packing up as the remaining guests exited the ballroom and the castle. A few minutes later, the only people still standing in the ballroom were the castle’s maids and servants, Steve, and the stranger that had not dared to leave the prince’s side.
Steve turned around, picked up the frappe, and passed it to Tony.
The brunet pouted and shook his head, “Rhodey, I appreciate your help, I really do. But this is my life and I intend to live it how I want to. You can’t control what I do, Rhodes - and you definitely cannot pick my career for me. I don’t want to wait on some rich guy hand and foot and you
───────
He lazily sucked a careful hickey into Tony’s skin, savoring each quiet moan that escaped the brunet’s parted lips and kissed his jaw and chin, not-stopping until he felt completely satisfied. Desire took control of his actions and Steve couldn’t resist his cravings anymore, caving in to his own hopeless thirst, as he grazed the nape of Tony’s neck with his fingers and pushed their faces together, once more. Concupiscence and passion erupted between the couple once again, resulting in Steve nibbling and chewing at the genius’ golden-basked lips that had transformed into an enchanting, carnation-pink color as they flushed with blood, — and time seemed to fly by as he desperately tried to take in as much of his lover as he can within the passing seconds of each moment, and Tony, unconditionally, — let him have it all. After yet another round of ceaseless, love-consumed kisses with bare skin pressing against bare skin, and the taste of cotton candy flooding his senses and mind, Steve reluctantly pulled back but continued to cradle the brunet, cuddling into the other’s body as if he might suddenly disappear from his grasp.
A poignant period of silence entered the room and left just as quickly.
───────
Tony huffed adorably — in Steve’s opinion —
“I never forgot. I remember everything about you; your irresistible cuteness, your beautiful blush, and not-to-mention your fucking perfect kisses.”
“Anytime, your majesty. Do enjoy yourself, tonight.”
“His heart’s just crushed and shattered into a million pieces, his pride basically crumbled into ashes and dust, yet here he is. Still head-over-heels in love with you. You’re all he ever talks about. All he ever worries about. He never cares whether his own body is functioning decently because he’s too busy wondering whether you really hate him or not, or whether you got out of his house okay without his father finding out about you. He’s obsessed with you like you’re one of his own inventions.”
The blond blushed and peered at the pen in his hand, avoiding both Bucky and Rhodey’s questioning looks.
Steve’s senses ignited sparks inside of his chest and he felt his nerves numbing the rest of his body and only allowing him to focus on the sweet sensation that was taking over his lips. His eyelids instantly fluttered shut as their lips shifted against each other’s, sending another round of adrenaline-spikes shivering down his spine in a ghostly pattern that Steve undoubtedly knew he could get used to. The prince felt Tony relax under his grip and wrapped his arms around the genius’ neck, stroking the back of it in order to conciliate him further.
that could ever accurately describe his undeniable perfection.”

Whether or not Tony had heard his compliment would be forever unknown to Steve as the brunet abruptly started to hyperventilate.

“Cut to the chase, already! Did you get in?!”
“He’s right, Buck. She’ll be anticipating something ordinary and predictable like that.” She turned to Steve with an unreadable emotion on her face. “Steve, you love him, don’t you? Let that fuel you to come up with a half-decent answer so that Pepper will at least let you catch a glimpse of him, can you do that?”
Love y'all 3000,
“I got the lead.” Tony repeated to himself, under his breath. “Oh fuck, I actually get to play Hamilton.”
He flashed her an indebted, appreciative, but uneasy smile before he dived into the bright room.
“And I haven’t gone blind yet, have I? ‘Cause I can still see your marvelous face, clear as day.”
“You should’ve just asked,” the genius laughed as he gratefully accepted the kiss. “After all, when am I ever going to say no to you? Especially when you’re asking to kiss me?”
“Shit, when did you get so charismatic, Steve?” Tony giggled. “Usually, I’m the one charming the fuck out of people.”
Tony stared unfazed, in the direction of the door that led to the Avengers’ common room. “See? Nat’s got it all under control. We don’t have a thing to worry about, Stevie.”
“That’s so not fair!”
Only fate could tell him. And that answer would have to wait until tomorrow.
“I’ve just got so much work to do, ugh. I’ve barely even started these personal letters and they were supposed to be finished over an hour ago.”
Suddenly, his office doors creakily opened to a James Rhodes standing in the doorframe, covered head to toe in some sort of dried modeling clay.
“You’re welcome, Steve.” Pepper took in a calming breath and she flashed him a polite smile. “Why don’t you wait in here until Tony comes back from MIT and then you can try to confront him. If you’re all going to stay, I’ll bring you guys some food and and snacks for lunch, in case you get hungry while waiting for him to get here.”
“Tony!”
Now, over a year later, he was standing in front of Pepper, stuck with distressed dread as his brain sped through miles of options of what he should say next. He had to say something; anything that could bring him even an inch closer to seeing Tony again, anything that could actually bring him a fighting chance.
Steve’s breath hitched in his throat but he loosened up his sudden reaction with a deep exhale.
,” but had to remind himself that he was still a virgin. Yeah, he couldn’t believe it, either.
His eyes widened at the heartwarming quote and pricks of tears began to cloud his vision.
“Dammit, Tony.” Steve shut him up with a squeeze. “Just enjoy the moment now, alright?”
“It’s truly an honor to meet you, Mr. Stark.”
Honestly, perfect first-kisses like
“He’s…” She stopped for a second. “There’s nothing you can do, Steve. Because you’ve already done enough — and look where he is now.”
After all, his mind was completely set on only one specific guest — who he couldn’t even find in the midst of his own overly-vibrant party.

Steve cracked a smile but ignored him.
“You’re not going to push me off, are you?”
Casting the brunet a worried look, Rhodey said, “Tony, at least think about it, please? You are honestly the smartest person I’ve ever met and you’re more than damn hell capable of using that big brain of yours to think about this decision. Use your smarts for once and think about all of the benefits that you can get from this! Think of all the freedom that you’ll get and creativity that you’ll be able to express once you start working in a high-tech kitchen that’s not one of your dad’s! Think of all the Howard Stark drama and pestering that you can escape if you make this choice - the right choice! Think of not having to go crawling to Obadiah every time that you fuck up in the eyes of your dad! This is

After several minutes of devouring the whole damn thing and reminiscing his Ma, Steve finished the entire dessert and leaned back in his chair, satisfied and oddly feeling a little bit fuzzy inside. He twisted his face in both confusion and in contentment - it was so weirdly relieving that a simple meal was solely responsible for doing this to him. Who knew that a
“Yeah,” The stranger visibly swallowed. “He… — I was supposed to meet up with him tonight, but I couldn’t find him. I suppose he just didn’t want to be seen with me.”
, and the
“Should I go check on them?” Steve asked, worriedly,
“Yeah,” Tony exhales in almost pure relief at the sound of Steve’s promising words. “Definitely.”
Carnival lights and street-lamps below glimmered like stars and bathed the people and rides below in bright, white hazes of luminosity. The setting sun shone brilliantly ahead right onto the Ferris wheel and caused it to cast a shadow a-quarter-of-a-mile tall, draping over the pavement below it in a twisting pattern of light and dark spots. Thousands of people roamed beneath the couple, their faces blurred from the sheer distance between the top of the ride and the ground. Many more attractions formed stark silhouettes against the fiery sky as the sunlight streamed past each rollercoaster, The sunset-clouds and stars above seemed to be so close that Tony felt like he could literally reach up and touch them.
“I heard that!” Steve shot Tony an unamused look.
“Thanks, Pepper.”
The brunet yawned, “Mm… Sure, cupcake.”

“besciamella” - bechamel
“Tony, you could never lose me because I promised myself that I would to be with you until the end of the line. And I’m sorry for being really distant, lately. I guess, I just didn’t want you to notice
‘Of course.” She started walking towards the door before promptly halting to quickly address him something.
Love was such a strange feeling, Steve couldn’t help but think to himself. But he was more grateful for it than he would ever openly admit — all because it had caused him to have Tony as a permanent part of his life. And it made him feel so
known Steve Rogers?!”
“I-I,” Tony fumbled, “I just don’t like this Rogers guy, okay?”
Pg. 33, Lines 4-8: "You got on at DeKalb and sat across from me, and we made eye contact, briefly. I fell in love with you a little bit, in that stupid way where you completely make up a fictional version of the person you’re looking at and fall in love with that person. But still, I think there was something there.”
“Hey!” Tony made an offended noise and pulled away from Steve to smack his arm but the blond could tell that he was way too exultant to properly care about anything else, right now.
It felt like he had been with the genius for an eternity, but it still wasn’t enough; the blond wanted to stay insanely in-love like this, forever — that’s how meaningless and overall forgettable, Steve’s life had been like without the brunet.
“I could never hate you, why on Earth would you ever think that?” Steve cupped his cheeks with his hands. “In fact, it’s quite the opposite… because I love you.”
. Rhodey thought that I should make some fresh food just in case; apparently, you’re often stuck at home with leftovers and takeout for food - not the fabulous meals that I’ve always envisioned millionaires eating.”
Fucking hell. The books did no fucking justice for this.
“No, I’m perfectly fine with it,” Steve said as he grimaced at his own pathetic voice. “I guess I’m just nervous, I’m sorry.”
They broke apart for a minute to catch their breath.
What if Tony didn’t want the kiss to happen at all even if it was just part of the show? What if Steve randomly got sick right before the performance days and his understudy took over his role and when the kissing scene finally takes place, Tony falls in love with Steve’s understudy instead of him?
“Yeah… Big event, isn’t it?” Steve stretched, lazily. “It should be fun, though. With all the panic that’s starting to build up among the kingdoms due to Hydra’s nonstop rebel attacks, holding this ball should relieve some of the stress among our people.”
The prince and the masked-person fell into another period of silence but the chirps of the crickets hiding in the tall grass filled the soundless void that they had left behind.
Tony made a sarcastic-startled noise, “Steven Grant Rogers, are you asking me out on a date?”
“Tones, are you blushing?”
Steve’s eyes glistened whimsically as he registered the idea, “No, why?”
After all, Tony admitted to himself, he should have expected for it to be hard to resist absolute perfection. Especially when it’s in human form.
“I’m begging you, Pepper. I know I should have done this sooner, I know I should have tried to apologize right after I had left; but I’m doing this now and I’m willing to put everything I have on the line here, I’m honestly willing to. For him.”
, out of all the beings that exist on this Earth.”
“And when do I get paid?” Tony asked, annoyed, as he watched the two shake hands.
After preparing his
The blond was truthfully not expecting for Bucky to slap his bionic arm against his forehead.
The brunet scowled and said, “I’m fine! And I don’t have any intentions of working for Steve Rogers and I’m only at home so I can be here to see if I’ve gotten a letter back from Obie’s and once I do
Steve’s voice faltered a little bit at the very end of the song but he managed to push through it, nonetheless. His breath hitched in his throat as his face drew nearer to Tony’s, and with one fell swoop, no practice, and a complete lack of coordination, Steve kissed the brunet.
Scrutinizing Rhodey’s suggestion, Steve said, “Do you really think that would be a good idea? I’m not so sure about inviting a stranger to come into my house, guys.”
“Thanks,” Steve breathed and Tony’s heart just skipped another three-thousand beats. “I’ll bring it back as soon as I can — this book is just too good to have only one copy in this entire library for the all of MIT to share.”
“Told you this was a bad idea.” The blond grumbled as he shook while straightening himself back up.
, an Italian dessert,” Rhodey responded while he walked outside, returning to hand Steve a clean fork from a plastic bag that he had left outside. “It was freshly made just this morning and it’s been chilling in my fridge ever since. Try it, it’s delicious, trust me.”
“…And I just can’t help falling deeper and deeper in love with him.”
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
And truthfully, Steve wouldn’t change it for the world.
Although Steve felt a special and surreal connection with this stranger, he knew that his heart truly, and only belonged to a certain Prince Anthony Edward Stark.
The blond grinned sheepishly before leaning down to press a light kiss against his lips.
“Alright, then. I’m lighting a medium-low fire for you and Captain Rogers right now. Have fun and Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to the two of you.”

“stronzo” - asshole
“It was the holiday season, Nat!” Clint grumbled in annoyance. “I thought those two would have calmed down with the pranks by then.”
“My god, Tony!” Rhodey said, the annoyance he previously possessed slowly turning into frustration. “Steve is literally one of the nicest people I’ve ever known and if you work for him, I
Clearly, Howard Stark would never be impressed by even his son’s best efforts to prove his worth to him — but the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be — after he had presented his new project to his class.

“First of all, Tiberius,” Tony hissed through his gritted teeth. “Don’t call me ‘
“And then the year after that,” Steve hummed.
“But I’m willing to try.” Steve harshly whispered, only loud enough for Pepper to hear his message. “I
The genius inhaled sharply before wiping off all remaining bits of politeness from his face.
“Have you ever built a miniature snow-castle with an actual tiny moat and drawbridge before?
“Tony, I swear. You look like an angel compared to me.”
“I’m sorry but can I ask what you’re holding?” Rogers eyed the containers with curiosity.
“Not at all,” Rogers promised him and Rhodey shook his head in agreement. “Everything was as perfect as that
“And the same goes to you, Steven Grant Rogers. Just remember, to stay in
Tony was cut off by a sudden kiss.
His friends could be real assholes sometimes but he wouldn’t trade them for all the gold and riches in the world.
As the sea of people coursed by Steve, he scoured them all as he searched for Tony, only to give up after the last, few unmasked guests disappeared into the darkness of the night.
“YOU DID WHAT?!”
The blond instantly blushed at the mention of Tony’s pet nickname for him; even after all the flirting and compliments that he had endlessly showered the genius with all evening, Steve was still able to blush at the subtlest word that Tony said. It was confounding how he still got flustered even after hearing Tony calling him “cupcake” for years, neither did he know why he called him that, but he loved the brunet for it, nonetheless.
The room’s attention turned to Steve.
Being social, compared to his critical thinking and engineering abilities, was never — and presumably never will be — his strong suit. Especially when Tony grew up with such a cold and uncaring father like Howard, that never even bothered to greet his son when he arrived home from a business trip.
“I know,” Steve fondly smiled. “Love you too, Tones.”
The genius grabbed Steve’s hand and hauled him through the leaves, undisturbed by the amount of plants that brushed past their bodies as they came to a stop in a clearing right under the shade of the giant tree. A small bridge sloped up and over the river that Steve had seen earlier, its metal railing glimmered with a fresh coat of midnight-black paint and it’s oak-wooden planks creaked under the pressure of their feet.
“I knew you could do it,” The brunet breathed. “And you did it perfectly, too!”
“Sure, Tony,” Steve just smiled wider. “Then how about we get out of here and — I don’t know — maybe, get some dinner? Preferably together?”
◝◟◞◠◡↝
He inclined to her declaration in an instant.
The blond bit his bottom lip.
Once the final song of the evening started to play, Steve and the brunet slowly soared throughout the ballroom, capturing the curiosity of the people around them as the whole castle seemed to watch them dance. The two of them took each of their steps gracefully during the orchestra’s performance, and gave no thought to the crowd that parted and gave way to their waltz. They passed by jealous onlookers and interested royal families as they maintained their artistic and fluid composure until the very last second of the musical piece.
All of his chances and every moment that they had shared and cherished together would be lost forever — thrown to waste if Steve was actually never into Tony in the first place. But the brunet chose not to focus on the possibility.
Maybe Tony was just preoccupied with entertaining the guests somewhere else inside the castle — he was probably on a totally different floor. Beyond everything, he still is a prince, and some of a royal’s most important duties include conversing with their fellow people and subjects. However, the thought of it still wasn’t enough to satisfy Steve’s unsettling stomach.
───────
“You still love him, don’t you?” Pepper questioned with a deadly stare.
“Steve,” Tony’s words were shaky and uneven. “Yo-You didn’t have to do that for me.”
He resumed, his words becoming softer with each sentence, “I’m not going to beg for his forgiveness, especially since I don’t deserve it. And kissing him will at least give him a hint of how badly I want him back; by showing him that I still love him, that I still care for him, and that all of me has always been his forever, despite what I had done or said before. It’ll at least get his attention. Maybe he’d even be willing to comprehend at least a bit of what I’m trying to tell him. That I just fucking love him so much, and that I had never stopped loving him more than anything on this fucking world. I love him more than my own life.”
sauce went over it, shredded mozzarella was sprinkled on top, and then finally another layer of pasta covered the top of the dish. Tony repeated the layering process again until his layers nearly reached the rom of his pan, spread one thin layer of
And with those final words to feed his unsettling guts, Pepper strode out of the conference chamber, her high heels clacking down the hallway towards the elevator before the sounds softly faded into a comfortable silence.
“Have you finished those personal letters those clients that have purchased your most recent artworks, Mr. Rogers?”
“Steve...?” His voice was shaky but shortly turned to irritation. “What the
Right. It was Friday, April 10th. The day Steve was supposed to be going out with his friends to eat at their monthly restaurant of choice. It’s been a tradition ever since he was a kid but lately, Steve’s rarely had the time to even think about dinner.
Steve just simply smiled against Tony’s lips.
“I’m just so—wait, did you get cast as well? I don’t really want to be in it if you’re not in it—I mean of course you got casted, you’re literally one of the best performing and visual arts students Columbia’s had in like, a century.”
“Ha!” Thor bellowed as he instantly reached for at least three cookies, all at once. “Luckily, I am a god, therefore my fingers don’t burn as easily as you mortals’ do.”
Tony didn’t look so convinced but shrugged it off nonetheless.
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
Okay, so maybe sassing your new millionaire boss wasn’t the best idea for first impressions but for some reason, Rogers actually didn’t seem to care and instead, found the quip surprisingly funny. If this was Howard, on the other hand, Tony would have received about a thousand verbal insults in response to his wits.
“Yup,” Steve affirmed. “Most likely. Can’t be right all the time, even
His heart twisted into a huge knot and unraveled too briskly. He had realized the effects of him avoiding Tony long ago, even before Pepper and Rhodey had came barging into his house that day. His love for the brunet was too strong to ignore back then and it still is now. But back then his stubbornness had clouded his judgement, essentially causing Steve to fail the one person he had promised to always be there for.
↜◡◠◟◞◜♡◝◟◞◠◡↝
Steve almost wanted to pull away, but when he eventually forced to due to the increasing lack of air in his lungs, he instantly focused his sight on Tony’s flushed face and a small grin began to etch its way onto his face when he saw the starstruck sparkles that danced through the brunet’s eyes as he looked back up at Steve.
───────
“Uh, are you sure about this?” An uncertain blond asked his enthusiastic boyfriend. “Tony, you know I’ve never been ice-skating before. Don’t you think I should at least learn before stepping foot on an actual lake?”
“You’ve been so out of it lately, I never know if you’re actually being honest or if you’re lying straight to my face when you say that you’re okay.”
Is this what Steve’s mind has become? Will there ever be any minute where his thoughts aren’t consumed by this certain brunet that managed to capture the hearts of and charm the fuck out of everyone around him? Is this what was meant to happen? For his head and heart to become so obsessed that he couldn’t tell that the clock always sped up by 400% when he was around Tony or that the worst days on in the history of planet Earth—where his professors would just constantly pile up useless information for him to study—could instantly be fixed and suddenly become a million times better just with Tony’s simple but genuine smile?
Tony visibly swallowed while taking Roger’s outstretched hand, “
He had beaten Tony almost to death.
“But, uhm, yeah. It’s the same for me, too — the whole love thing I mean. As in: I love
Their royal friends constantly joked about how they should marry each other in order to complete the final rounds of coronations, but Steve pretended that their comments didn’t stab just him in his lungs and proceeded to laugh at the joke along with everyone else. The pain in his chest devoured all his emotions every time he forced himself to act like it didn’t torture his heart when Clint mentioned Tony’s name and how he was last seen with Lady Whitney Stane, or when Natasha kept pushing him to confess his feelings to the genius before it was too late. The blond wanted to tell her that S.H.I.E.L.D. would probably collapse before he ever revealed his love for the brunet to his insanely-attractive face — but refrained from it and politely declined every time she nagged him to, “Just tell him already!”
He nodded and while Rhodey was just walking out of the door, Steve finally placed the
“Too late now,” The brunet smirked. “I think I’ve already gotten the message.”
“Yeah, Buck,” Steve grinned, jokingly. “If I can withstand the entire room’s eyes on me while they’re bowing in my presence — because they’re scared I would cut off their heads if they didn’t — why can’t you grow some balls to at least ask out your wife before she has to do it for you?”
Rolling his eyes, Steve packed more of the frozen ground into uneven spheres to hurl back at Tony.
A muffled, “For fuck’s sake, Steve,” came out of the brunet’s mouth as Steve wrapped his arms around his waist in order to calm him down.
you get me for Christmas?”
His boyfriend had the audacity to cheekily roll his eyes and Tony scoffed at the sight, tugging the blond into the maze of amusement rides and prize booths — because for once, he could be wasting the night away without a care in the world.
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
They’ve already exchanged phone numbers and have hung out on several occasions — and Tony would consider all of it “progress” — if he wasn’t almost-one-hundred-percent sure that Steve had no interest in being anything other than friends with him.
Tony grumbled, his mind still set on refusing Rhodey’s offer, “What if he’s just like Howard? Or even worse, what if he’s at first, super sweet and then over time as I continue to work for him, he turns into a person like Howard?”
On stage he was able to live the life of his dreams, with Tony captured in his arms, holding onto Steve like his life depended on it, but when he stepped out of the spotlight—that’s when every little dream, scenario, and act he was able to dedicate time towards and fixate himself on, suddenly crumples to the ground and shatters his hopes in about a hundred-million pieces. Out in front of the audience, the act and the experience was all he ever wanted in life—only for it to be revealed to his heart and head as fake, once he left the stage. Everything in his life was just turning to absolute shit, at this point.
LEFT him there with that
Instantly, a crackling fire ignited itself in the fireplace in Steve’s art studio and the following immediate warmth pleasantly contrasted against the dropping temperatures outside of the tower.
He gave his best friend a bone-crushing hug and waved him goodbye as Rhodey’s face disappeared through the cracks of the elevator doors.

Sprinkled across the sky were the tiniest specks of stars, barely visible to the naked-eye. Barely any managed to peek through and shine their light bright enough against the radiance of the setting sun, but Tony admired how hard that they were trying. One particular star right above the couple’s heads, uncannily resembled and made the brunet think about his
“Yeah,” Steve breathed in relief as he gripped Tony’s arms even tighter than before. “Yeah, okay.”
. Now, before you go and do whatever you need to do before dinner, I just wanted to let you know that I’ll have to dust your entire kitchen first before I can make anything in it so whatever food that I cook might finish sometime later than your usual time for dinner. Sorry about that.”
“He’s back.”
Once “Helpless” started to play, his palms started to sweat and the auditorium suddenly reached a hundred degrees. Ignoring both his heart and his brain pounding within his body, warning him about the catastrophe about to ignite, he forced his voice to start and gradually, the words flowed out of his mouth as smoothly as they did during rehearsal.
“Okay, Tones,” Rhodey said. “I think it’s almost time for dinner for Steve - we’ve just eaten lunch after all - why don’t you start getting started on it? Plus, I’ve got to leave for that new art exhibition, anyways.”
Surprised, the other Avengers swiveled in their seated positions to look at the bird-themed superhero, intrigued.
time, at least.”
He glanced at the blond’s cheeky grin.
Essentially, Steve was senselessly-in-love with Anthony Edward Stark.
He sighed contently, “I love you.”
A satisfied sigh came out of Tony’s parted lips as he shifted to gaze in the direction of the castle.
───────
you that he is not going to turn into your father! On the other hand, if you do accept, I can promise you that you won’t regret taking this job at all!”
Kingdoms united in the S.H.I.E.L.D. coalition required royals, like kings and queens, to pass down their title and positions once their children had been married; many of the kingdoms have already assumed new rulers and the commoners of the alliance welcomed the new generation of royals with renewed joy with each individual coronation. By now, the only two kingdoms who haven’t officiated their successors were Americandia and New Ironingham: Steve and Tony’s kingdoms.
Steve sighed and ultimately decided to shrug it off. Tony’s dealt with worse things and people than Ty and if he needed it, Steve would always come rushing over to defend him if he needed it. Hopefully, the genius knew this before he got himself in any serious trouble or off-stage drama with his ex.
“Oh, yeah. Uhm… right…” Tony flushed with embarrassment. “So… Are you going to come over here — and kiss me, — or…?”
“God, Tones. Don’t scare me like that, please. Are you okay?”
“Honestly, I’m not surprised,” the blond told the brunet who obviously wasn’t listening. “Not only are you an actual genius but you’re an amazing actor, too.”
“Cotton candy clouds,” Tony sighed like he was living a real-life dream. “That’s definitely something that I could get used to seeing every evening. Especially, like this. Especially, with you.”
“Steve,” Tony shakily inhaled a gulp of air as he halted to a stop a foot in from to Steve, unlike the distance that they would normally speak to each other at.
“Steve, Tony!” Sam yelled at the still-kissing couple who hadn’t moved from under the mistletoe. “It’s been ten minutes and you two are still smooching away! The movie’s about to start!”
Steve gave Tony a sympathetic pout and the brunet immediately felt bad for ranting about his life’s problems to this random college student in the library, out of all the places. He didn’t want to scare away this insanely-gorgeous guy right after he had just met him.
“See? You’ve got this already.” Tony continued to encourage him as they did a small twirl in place together while holding on to each other’s arms. “Okay, ready to let go now?”
He gestured towards the copy of “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda” in the brunet’s hands.
to try. Please, just give me a chance.”
“Steve — I’m so fucking sorry for evading you and trying to avoid you… I was just so scared of what you would think of me if you ever found out that I had this huge-ass crush on you. And I thought that if you did, you would probably leave and move to another kingdom, oceans away from me, and I didn’t want to lose you that way…”
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
Tony bit his bottom lip, hesitantly - a millionaire asking a commoner to call him by his first name as if they were a personal friend? As far as Tony knew, all of Rogers’ friends consisted of famous singers, artists, dancers, and other various celebrities that all referred to him by his first name. This was certainly odd but Tony knew that it wasn’t exactly uncommon. Maybe there was more to this guy than what Tony had seen just fro the museums displaying his treasured art.
Now with Pepper’s approval, there was no possible way that he was going to screw his only chance up.
“How — just, how?”
“Tony!” Rhodey exclaimed and gave him a light, but forceful shove. “Sorry, Steve. This one here can’t really control his mouth sometimes.”
After her satisfaction was fulfilled with her final remark, Pepper sauntered out of the coffee shop.
“Chocolate-hazelnut frappe with chocolate chunks and caramel drizzle,” the genius whispered in disbelief. “You remember.”
Based on Tony’s calculations — yes, it was a thing he did now when it came to Steve — he should have a decent 70.0529% chance of achieving success — that is if Steve actually supposedly has the same feelings for the genius that he did, for him. Relatively speaking, Tony’s friends would definitely consider that pretty goods odds that would most likely turn out in favor for Tony — but he had to remind himself that that’s where the other 29.9471% falls in: mainly into two categories.
“Steve,” the blond said with kind eyes. “You’re a Stark? I’ve heard of your father, before.”
The Ferris wheel began to spin once again and the couple’s seat slowly rose to the top as the carriages under them exchanged passengers every step of the ride’s revolution. Every time the attraction would stop, it rocked the benches attached to it in a soothing, delicate manner.
The brunet smirked, while his blush still visible, tilted his head up and stood on his toes to press a loving kiss to the blond’s lips.
that made me fall in love with him in the first place.”
Students around the two who were still anxiously scanning the list for their names looked at the brunet in annoyance before backing off as Tony glared right back at them.
and walked over to his pantry to grab the ingredients that he needed, including all-purpose flour, garlic cloves, fresh basil, and grated nutmeg. He gathered the organic tomatoes, ground sirloin, unsalted butter, whole milk, and mozzarella from the fridge. While first forming his pasta and then prepping everything else to start cooking, his mind began to wander to what Rhodey had said before he had left.
“So… This guy that you were waiting for — What’s he like?”
“You’re an idiot, you know that right?” Steve chuckled as he peppered kisses all over Tony’s forehead and nose. “You get the chance to go out there and make a huge name for yourself, become rich and famous, and you would give it all up, for me?!”
Oh, and he should probably hope that Steve returned his feelings for him. That was probably the most logical thing to do right about now.
Love y'all 3000,
Now Steve was unmistakably sobbing. Small tears pattered onto the floor but he didn’t try to hide them. He thought that his chest couldn’t be impaled anymore by his own emotions than it already had been, but he was just proven wrong.
The brunet slammed his jaw shut.
because he thinks that he made you feel not worthy of his attention and his love when he’s actually listening to his father for once, trying to get on his good side, so he could actually have the chance of being with you later on!”
They were together almost 24/7, yet neither of them had gathered enough reason to act upon their own feelings, and when one of them finally did, the resulting emotion was almost too unbearable to tolerate, but they did, because they, with all of their being, wanted to.
“It’s alright, kiddos,” Tony smirked as he bent over to pat the kid’s head. “You guys can go back to ice-skating now. Just try not to knock over anyone in the process, sound good?”
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧

The prince glanced at the stranger again, paying closer attention to his elegant features and continued to let himself be guided through the horde of waltzers and intoxicated guests. Coffee-colored hair ruffled in the breeze that was created as they were swept across the room, and calloused but delicate hands gripped his shoulder and left palm. Everything about this person that he had just laid his eyes upon, was already robbing Steve of his breath and his consciousness to think properly.
Ever since the day that Tony had fixed his mother’s family heirloom, a necklace that Steve had accidentally dropped it, the unmistakable truth had crashed down on the blond: That he had fallen in love with the brunet and he had fallen fucking hard. Steve thought that it should have been more evident to himself, after all, he had known about his not-so-secretive crush on his best-friend for years before Tony had offered to fix his mother’s most-prized possession.
“Oh, right. I forgot,” The stranger recalled. “We were supposed to take off our masks hours ago, weren’t we?”
Okay, maybe not the last bit, but definitely the “in love” part.
When Steve glided across the dance floor to greet his next dancing partner, he was immediately met with a pair of the most entrancing eyes he had ever had the chance to witness. It felt like the air was just stolen from his gasping lungs.
Pepper just quirked up an eyebrow.
Steve had no interest in any of them and politely declined each of their on-coming invitations to dance with them. Soon after, countless more women of-all-ages, individually sashayed up to the prince as each one of them attempted to attract or seduce him into spending the night with them. He turned down every single lust-filled and disturbing offer.
“Yeah, we were.” Steve agreed. “Would you like to do it now?”
Inside the book would be another note with the inscription: “
“Thanks.” The other smirked. “Where’d you learn to dance like that, by the way?”
“You have to take this opportunity, Steve. If you ever want to see Tony again.”
“ with Tony’s fancy signature at the bottom.
Rolling his eyes with fondness, Tony took one last sip from his Captain America-themed mug of hot cocoa and set it down in order to turn towards Steve and press his head against his chest. Their legs and hands entangled within each other as warmth continued to spread into their bodies from the fire and their close contact. The couple peacefully snuggled until several faint crashes interrupted their tranquil moment.
He scoured the bookshelves until he arrived at the start of the fiction-based area, where a blond college student who looked like a football player, was looking for something in the shelves. Ignoring the stranger, Tony glanced at each book’s spines for the correct last name and once he had finally found what he’d been searching for, reached up for the only copy, only to bump his hand with the blond’s while doing so.
“Tell the manager, I said, ’Thank you’.”
“Helpless~”
How did he never notice this look in Tony’s eyes before?
“I love you, too. And I’m sorry again for everything—“
“Right now in this land, each one of our kingdoms are rejoicing together for the day that we were united as a whole! In doing so, not only did we become stronger and more powerful but we also bonded together — not just as a coalesced land, but as a family.”
“So what did you have planned for this evening, Captain?”
anymore. If you truly wanted to make it up to him, you should’ve have went to find him as soon as you could.”
Lightly grunting as he got out of his very comfy position, Tony got up and quickly headed over to where he had previously heard Steve’s voice call out from. Surprisingly, he was nowhere to be found.
“Tony, I don’t know if this is a good id—“ Steve’s words suddenly got cut off by the force of several kids who were just learning to skate, plowing into his body. Thankfully, Tony caught and steadied him before he could fall face-first into the lake and make a complete fool of himself.
“I refuse to leave, I refuse to just give up, because you’re here to at least consider giving me a chance.” He stomached down the sharp stabs occurring in his chest. “I refuse to leave; not when he never left me, not when he never gave up on me, not when he may still love me.”
Tony bit his bottom lip as he cooked the meat and garlic in a large pan with olive oil for his
Rhodey and Tony argue about whether Tony should take up the job or not; Tony makes some lasagna.
“No! I mean, you’re fine. You’re just perfect, actually… Maybe even more than perfect—“
Rhodey smirked, “Just wait until you try the
Tony spotted several copies of “Harry Potter” in some people’s hands, while others happily read “Percy Jackson,” and still others were clutching copies of “The Land of Stories” in their clasp. He smiled as he read the titles of each individual book, recalling the exact years he had first read each one, during his lonely childhood. Tony was pleased to recognize a lot of the different works of fiction that many of the people around him were holding, but none of them particularly captured his attention, seeing as he had all of his most beloved books’ storylines from his youth, memorized by heart.
This was it.
Tony hummed in response.
“Were you expecting me to bring Steve dog food?” Rhodey gaped, annoyed, and took the container out of Bucky’s hands. “Just let him eat already, you asshole.”
Truthfully, he was expecting it to be mediocre at best. He knew what good food truly tasted like. Due to his social and economic status, and shamefully to his morals, Steve knew exactly what the best types of exotic fruits and vegetables tasted like. He knew how to distinguish the tarty sweetness of fruits from the buttery and milky sweetness of bread, and as much as it hurt him to admit it, being somewhat wealthy did have its advantages. Along with his sense of taste, Steve managed to expand his horizons on all of his favorite cuisines. Not everyone gets to say that they’ve eaten fried scorpion from Southeast Asia and Steve only halfheartedly regretted the choice. Despite all of the strangeness that emanated from foreign foods, Steve loved trying new things and desserts were among his favorites.
↜◡◠◟◞◜♡◝◟◞◠◡↝
“Has it come to your attention, Steve, that Prince Tony may have possibly developed a love interest for someone else?” His father randomly told him. “I spoke with King Howard the other day, and he described a ‘longing’ look in his son’s eyes as he stared out the window while at a dinner party.”
Rhodey grinned, “Yup. I couldn’t help myself. I had originally intended to leave it for dessert after dinner but…”
“Oh, shut up,” He laughed lightly. “I don’t need to know the whatever theorem of calculus, just let me quietly celebrate in peace.”
“Most likely?”
Pg. 240, Lines 15-17: “And I think about how loving someone is kind of like being president, in that it doesn’t change you, not really. But it brings out more of the you that you already are.”
“Okay,” Steve sighed, “What is this stuff, anyways?”
“Okay, calm down,” Steve came back into the living room with a tray-full of extremely hot cookies. “I made sure that there’s something for everyone — just don’t burn your fingers, everyone.”
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
Fuck’s sake. What has he done?
Sometimes, on the infrequent occasions that Steve does spend time with Tony, each minute he’s next to the other prince feels like his entire body is being consumed by an excruciating pining; his heart aching for the one who was so close yet so far from his reach. He eventually rationalized with himself and supposed that it was a good thing that Tony seldom visited him anymore if each time he even looked at the blond, a piercing sensation of stinging accompanied his gaze. At this point, Steve accepted any excuse to try and evade Tony and to save his heart from its own tormenting, even if it meant that it was only hurting himself more.
Steve found his voice shaking with a gut-wrenching combination of fear and heartbreak, “Yeah — okay, — I will.”
“Here he is,” Rhodey pushed Tony one step forward.
“Tony? Tony!”
“Hey, Tones,” Rhodey chuckled as he took in Tony’s in-awe face. “Yes, we finished the whole thing that quickly - you don’t have to ask.”
Shit.
Bucky and Rhodey try to get Steve to finally go out and eat something that isn't leftover frozen pizza.
“Okay, okay! You win, for God’s sake, Steve,” the brunet laughed as he collapsed onto the snow while Steve gingerly scooted off of Tony to rest down next to his head.
A whole twenty-four hours passed before Tony had received a response from Steve, — oddly, in the form of a notecard saying: “
“He sounds like a marvelous person.”
He swiveled around to see the queen approaching him carefully.
“Nah,” Tony murmured as he reluctantly got up to reach for his cup of hot cocoa.
The masked-figure delayed his reply for a minute, “Sure — But don’t be expecting anything fancy, okay?”
Absolutely none.
The scientist smiled as he returned to the movie just as Sam spoke up, “I’m down to watch ‘The Princess Switch.’”
“I can’t,” Steve inhaled deep as he responded. “This is Pepper, she’ll be expecting me to say some stupid and cliche answer like saying sorry and it won’t be good enough for her. Anyone else would automatically say that they’re just going to apologize, but any answer that obvious and simplistic is always wrong according to Pepper.”
“The one right by my side.”
This would be interesting. And extremely awkward. If the two exes didn’t kill each other first before the final performance weeks.
As if to seal a deal involving the sacrifice of Tony’s soul, Rhodey extended his hand to shake Rogers’ and the conclusion was determined: Tony was one-hundred percent stuck with cooking Rogers like fucking Cinderella.
Steve happily complied and dragged his lips down the side of his boyfriend’s beautiful face, leaving behind a trail of tingles and absolute euphoria upon the brunet’s skin, and settled his mouth right on top of Tony’s “sweet-spot” which the blond could find from pure instinct and memory — right under the the genius’ jawline on the left side of his neck.
Now all that the genius could do, is wait in his dorm room, try not to create a hole in the ground with his foot’s constant tapping, and hope that Steve understood what Tony was trying to tell him: That he was overly-idiotically in love with him and was too much of a coward to openly admit it to the blond’s face.
“Of course.”
The biggest concern that kept pestering him was whether or not Steve Rogers would be a decent human being. But every time he tried to think about the most detestable outcomes that this occupation could bring him, - like what if Rogers was secretly a cannibal in disguise as an artist - his brain reminded himself of Rhodey’s words and he quickly shot himself down.
Since when did this virgin, oblivious-fuck of a blond god, get so goddamn smooth?
know why.”
Steve grinned lovingly, “Oh, so you admit that you daydream about me?”
“And why is the lead role suddenly so important?” Tony grumbled in frustration. “Tiberius Stone just got cast as Maria—“
“Please, Pepper,” Steve rasped. “I’ve lost everything; my father, my mother, my entire biological family, my discipline, my… my pride. I can’t lose him, too. Not when I’m this close to him. Just give me the key, Pepper, you’re the one holding the key to him, just let me borrow it, just for an hour. Please.”
“I can’t believe that I had ever trusted you.” Pepper had snapped at him. “
Rushing water flowed underneath the bridge, mixing in with the natural sounds of the surrounding environment and the soft breathing of the two princes. Birds chirped and sang aloft their heads, the branches draped overhead rustled as a calm wind flew through them, and speckles of fire-orange sunlight soaked the emerald-colored grass in spots that seeped through the leaves of the tree above. Wild flowers and berry-bushes dotted the ground in vivid bursts of color and a faint, indescribable but pleasant, smell streamed through the air; the radiance of the entire sight constructed an almost romantic aura that enveloped the area in a welcoming warmth.
“Oh.”
Too bad Tony was too deeply buried in his anticipating-thoughts to do so.
Steve beamed lightly as he planted his lips on Tony’s marvelous and sweet-tasting ones once more, cherishing it deeply, as he reached down to grip the genius’ hand.
“C’mon, speak to me. Or we can just open up these doors and walk right in - it’s your choice,” Rhodey offered.
The blond casually shrugged, “Sure, why not?”
The couple were best friends already and the last thing Steve wanted on Earth was to screw that all up so for four years, he kept his secret crush to himself and watched from the sidelines as Tony dated and looked truly happy with other people. He tried dating other people himself, of course, but the only people who wanted to be with him were girls who suddenly took an interest in him after his sudden growth spurt in the middle of high school that transformed him into a 6’ 2’’ dork in a model’s body. All of hell knows that he’d rather stay single forever than hook up with one of those girls who only chased boys for their looks and their money.
How four hours of pure bliss with his favorite person in the entire cosmos could suddenly turn into his worst nightmare becoming reality was honestly purely comedic and almost ironic in a sense.
“Is there a contract or some kind of waiver that I have to sign?”
He swore he saw the golden-boy’s eyes widen at his unexpected declaration.
“What?” Sam shrugged as he glared at Clint’s entertained look. “I like romance movies, damn, why is that so bad? Steve knows this! Go on, Rogers, tell ‘em.”
“Jarvis, light a fire for us.”
“Hey, you know that word that I said was stuck on the tip of my tongue, earlier?” Steve asked without lifting his gaze off of the brunet.
───────
“I’m winning this battle, Stark. Understand?” The blond persisted in tickling his partner, hoping the other would finally give in.
Promptly after the final note of “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” the audience erupted in applause in order to shower the performers in their absolute awe of the performance.
“I was waiting for you to say that,” Tony laughed and returned the favor by pecking the blond on the cheek. “C’mon, before we waste the entire night making out — although I honestly wouldn’t mind doing that — and the carnival closes before we can even step foot in it!”
“Ouch, no need to be so harsh,” Bucky pouted but snickered anyways. “It’s our job as best friends to absolutely annihilate each other’s bowels. Your ‘best friend’ doesn’t do that to you?”
, was the brunet’s first thought.
“Wait, no — that’s literally impossible,” Steve muttered in-between kisses. “Because you’re this beautiful, everyday.”
“Same, — although one of the biggest reasons why I love this book so much is because of Simon’s struggle to come out to all of his family and friends. It’s something that I can really relate to.” The genius gave a sad frown as he referred to his father.
In the corner of his vision, he saw the brunet’s eyes glaze over in thought. A melancholic frown began to settle onto his face and Steve instantly started worrying.
Fuck it. Cotton candy was worth it.
Steve shook his head and smiled him as he got up off the sofa, “Well, let’s get that sorted out then, shouldn’t we? Here, let me help you with that - no worries, I have plenty of time to help you get my kitchen cleaned up before dinner.”
“That’s alright, Rhodes,” Rogers reassured him. “I thought that it was actually kind of clever.”
Bucky shook his head and frowned at Rhodey, “I’m not worried about that, Rhodes. I was just surprised that it looks more than edible… it actually looks kind of good.”
Fuck’s sake.
“Well, Steve Rogers might or might not be looking for a personal chef right about now,” Rhodey informed him. “He’s a busy guy and honestly, me and the others are worried about his health with him skipping meals more and more frequently now. And I may have recommended you to him and told him that you’d be his personal chef.”
Another crash rang through the building and the remaining Avengers in the living room erupted into a heated argument hot enough to probably warm up all of Manhattan.
How an Italian dessert could remind Steve of his mom, he didn’t have a damn clue but it wasn’t bad. Not at all. On the contrary, the intense espresso and coffee flavor of the treat tasted astonishingly similar to how his mother had liked her coffee in the mornings. The chocolate tasted a lot like her chocolate-cake recipe and the scent of vanilla made his heart skip a beat as he breathed it in, reminded of how Sarah Rogers always smelled like vanilla, no matter how long she’s been away from the kitchen. He and his mother almost never had enough money to purchase heavy cream like the one he could feel upon his tongue, and it was the smoothness and silkiness of it that made him almost choke on just the thought of how hard his mother used to work to be able to afford the exceptional, milky-sweet cream that Steve used to love having his birthday cake slathered in. Everything, as a whole and as its stand-alone tastes, felt like the sensations of being caring and thoughtful, and Steve instantaneously knew that whoever had made this cake had loved cooking almost as much as, or even maybe more than, his mother. After all, when Sarah Rogers didn’t have the money or time to go to Spain or France, or to some tropical location such as the Bahamas, she always did have the money and time to bake something sweet and remarkably mouthwatering for Steve to feast on. And it was always the smallest of details, and the sweetest of gestures, that really catapulted Steve’s brain right back to his treasured Ma,
“If only he really was made for me… If only the cosmos would give me some kind of sign, some kind of confirmation, that me and him were just meant to be… but that hasn’t happened yet and I highly doubt that it’ll ever happen in my entire life.”
Before he could even muster up the courage to fire back, Tiberius scrambled up and fled back into the auditorium, no doubt to complain to some of his bitch-ass friends about what just happened. Whatever, Steve couldn’t care less right now. All he cared about was keeping Tony safe.
As the brunet discovered that he had wandered aimlessly throughout the fiction section for the past five minutes, he suddenly remembered the name of one of his all-time favorite books that he had read a couple of years ago before he had started university.
“Well, that’s because you don’t know me well enough,” came the response.
At first, Steve wasn’t sure what to expect of the taste. He could tell that there was some kind of powdered chocolate or something on the top so he mostly thought that it would taste like chocolate. Additionally, the piece that Steve had sliced from his fork was extremely light, not thick at all, which was definitely not how the cakes that Steve was used to eating behaved.
The blond shook his head as he reached for another sheet of computer paper, “I’m not going to risk it, Buck. This is my life now - might as well accept it. I have, now it’s your turn.”
Just merely observing Tony’s sparkling like crystals while he stared at all the enormous, golden and pink clouds in the sky and his tranquil surroundings — with the cutest expression on his face in the history of humankind, — made Steve smile like a child who had been just gifted free cake.
While he cranked his pasta machine, Tony brainstormed all the possible outcomes that a job such as a personal chef could bring him. Freedom was a clear benefit and the thought of being able to independently work in a huge kitchen and create whatever the hell he wanted, made him crank the handle just slightly faster.
The genius smiled in satisfaction and towed his nervous boyfriend behind him towards the center of the lake. Cautiously, Steve began to gain some confidence as he gradually got used to gliding around on two very sharp and dangerous blades stuck to the bottom of his feet. Not that that bothered him at all — because it didn’t. Obviously.
And somehow, Steve’s radiant smile managed to fill the coldness of the entire library with a sudden comforting warmth.
Was it that big of a problem to the point that even Steve’s friends are noticing how blatantly apparent it was that Tony had fallen stupidly in love with the blond?
“Oh honey, don’t fret,” His mother reassured him, her voice rapidly bouncing across the empty room as she sent a glare at the king. “Even if Tony is seeing another person right now, I’m positive he’ll fall for your charm and dazzling character, sooner or later.”
thing?!”
Tony looked up at Steve with a cautious, but heartfelt expression.
Letting his imagination run wild, the blond sat down on the curb of the sidewalk and stared out at the blend of pinks, oranges, and yellows, beginning to fill in the void of the sky as speckles of stars danced and twinkled in the far distance, almost completely-invisible to the naked eye.
week have been nothing but cheap takeout and granola bars! Everyone’s worried about you seeing that you’re always crammed up in this office - you haven’t even finished a whole painting in a month! We really think that you’re too busy for your own good.”
“C’mere and kiss me, you dork.” Tony casually demanded, cutting off Steve’s thoughts. “I’ve been deprived from my hourly kisses for too long.”
↜◡◠◟◞◜
“Oh, — I’m sorry — I was actually looking for someone that I was desperately hoping would come so I could dance with him. But I guess he never showed up,” Steve sorrowfully sighed.
Pepper’s ice-cold eyes continued to carve a wound through Steve’s heart and soul as he grimaced, racking his brain for acceptable answers to the redhead’s cruelly specific request.
“Can I get a kiss to go along with that?” The brunet appealed playfully to the blond as he took another sip from the frappe in his hand.
“Then that means that you weren’t doing enough, Steve.” Pepper took a sip of her coffee. “Rhodey knows what’s best for Tony more than I ever will and if he’s repulsed by you, then that means you just weren’t good enough.”
The genius exhaled calmly in awe and steadily walked over to the blanket, sitting down charily beside the blond. Once he had found a cozy position to snuggle up against Steve, Tony tucked his head into the crook of the blond’s neck as his free hand still moved to grab some of the cotton candy nearby.
The kitchen’s oven beeped a bell-like noise that was familiar to almost all of the Avengers — which could only mean one thing: Steve had baked something.
Tony rolled his eyes before allowing Jarvis to unlock the basement’s storage unit for Clint.
The genius pecked his cheek.
The blond smirked while he covered his boyfriend’s mouth with his hand.
“Tony.” The blond interrupted him and nervously smiled. “I think that right about now, is when the main characters are supposed to kiss?”
“Buck? You get his ass out of that chair yet?” Rhodey caught sight of Steve’s perplexed stare at his outfit and suspired, “I’m guessing not, judging by the fact that Steve’s ass is still glued to that chair.”
“Uh, I guess I never had a reason to. I mean, I always just eat whatever leftovers I had for lunch as my dinner. Plus, I just never thought of it.”
“You are so paying for that!”
Bruce was the first one to openly agree, “Can we watch ‘The Princess Switch’ or ‘The Holiday’? We haven’t watched any romance movies during our previous Christmases together as a team.”
Streams of sunlight poured over their bodies, encasing them in a warm luminescence as a dainty breeze brushed past the trees overhead. Along with the hot summer air, nature had automatically created the perfect conditions to just sit outside, cuddle, maybe make-out a couple of times, and watch the sunset.
The brunet almost punched the unexpectedly-attractive man in the face right at that moment. Tony was the only one allowed to call Rhodey “Rhodes;” who was this guy to call his best friend by such a close name and just who did he think he was?
“And please, please, Tony, believe me when I say this,” Steve’s voice quivered. “But I had never meant to leave you. Never for this long, never at all. I was jealous and upset and it made me make the stupidest, most fucked-up decision in my entire goddamn life: Leaving you.”
“Why not?”
apparently, you gave him some of my other stuff?!”
“S-sorry, misters.” One brave kid out of the bunch apologized to the two superheroes. “W-we didn’t m-mean to hurt y-you.”
Four feet in front of Steve, the blond motioned for him to stop walking and Tony halted in his place. The genius tilted his head an inch to the left, puzzled, as Steve grinned and signaled for him to start reading.
Gritting his teeth behind his lips, Tony firmly nodded and when he was sure that he was out of Rogers’ view, he shot his best friend a highly-irritated face that practically screamed, “You’re not my parent,” but Rhodey blatantly ignored him.
“No! No, it’s not you… ‘M-probably just tired, I’m fine.”
Too bad he was stuck at the library for a Mechanical Engineering project at MIT.
His perfectly-chosen words earned him another round of kisses from the crimson-faced brunet.
He opened his mouth to articulate something valuable from the lump in his throat before swiftly shutting it, swallowing a bit of bile down.
“Cap?” Tony called out to the blond. “You good?”
“That’s no problem,” Rogers answered for Rhodey. “We can sort that out tomorrow morning; it’s getting late after all. I don’t know about you but I prefer not to have to continue doing paperwork after business hours are over.”
It felt like Steve’s entire life had led up to this moment. The moment where fate would decide whether he deserved Tony back in his life or not. But he wouldn’t have had to go through this heart-rending situation if only he had stayed and listened to Tony on that day over a year ago. If only he had chosen his fate better back then, then maybe fate would’ve also chosen better for him now.
Come to think of it, Tony hadn’t read a full, proper novel written by an author who wasn’t an aerospace engineer or a quantum physicist, in years. Maybe he should check out a book while he was here - One that was actually worth his time to completely finish from the beginning to the end.
,’ because I am never, ever, in all hell,
Somehow the brunet knew that Rogers had requested to try one of the dishes that Tony had brought along with him and his head began to fill up with fears all based on the possibility that Rogers will actually start to hate his food. The cocky and confident part of him tried to calm him down; it was unlikely that Rogers would just randomly start to despise his food since almost everyone that’s ever tried something of Tony’s has immediately fallen in love with the flavors and taste of his recipes - but it was still a possibility.
Dark bruises littered over his body, and gashes, cuts, scraps, everywhere; most likely etched upon his beautiful face by the glass bottle of liquor that Howard Stark always carried around with him. He possibly had also received a concussion, a few broken ribs, a swollen eye, and he probably had been in so much emotional stress that he couldn’t sit up for at least a week, much less properly sleep and eat.
The blond wrapped his arms around Tony, spooning him as they kissed, deeply and ever-so-passionately.
Groaning, Rhodey shoved Bucky, who stumbled a few steps back but didn’t seem fazed. “You fucking asshole; I’ll have you know that my
He saw Thor who stood to the right of him, beam and gesture for him to resume.

how long it's been.
“Uhm, alright. But why would I —”
Maybe he shouldn’t have listed so many pages. What if Steve got Tony’s meaning confused and thought that he was pranking him or something like that, but worse? The brunet had to be reminded by Thor that Steve would never accuse him of something that sinister, and the rest of his friends reassured him over and over again that his plan would work and that he should stop, “shitting his pants.”
“Of course,” Steve smiled down at him. “Who else in this world, would I be talking about?”

more captivating?”
Tony groaned as he eventually comprehended what he had just said.
in triumph.
“Now, don’t you talk to me like that, Tones,” He snapped at the brunet. “We all know here that all of your success in theatre really is because of me. After all, I’m the one who first introduced you to theatre and brought you to your first play! And this is how you repay me, years later?! By yelling shit in my face?!”
A regal, welcoming-trumpet-melody suddenly rang into the cool, night’s air.
Tony was honestly not expecting a handsome, giant hunk of a blond to come bounding towards the elevator like a giant golden retriever. The man’s hair glistened in the golden sun that shone through the window, his sharp, yet subtle jaw outlined the bottom of his face in an eager and pleasant smile, and he was wearing a dark-blue dress shirt with a black tie and a pair of black pants - a little overdressed for meeting your personal chef but Tony didn’t mind - the blond’s outfit wrapped his figure in all of the right places and his muscles were exposed where he had rolled up his sleeves. Tony
Perhaps this really was the best option for him and if all goes well, Tony’s life might seriously improve after cutting away all of his ties from his dad. What else could the brunet do as he tried to pick his whole life up? He can’t just sit around his apartment and keep waiting for his life to truly start again - to really break free from the boundaries that Howard had enforced onto him while he worked for his dad, he needed to work, he needed action… he needed a high-paying job.
“Oh, you’re one to talk, your
Cursing himself for over-fretting, as usual, Tony reminded himself that it’s probably nothing that Steve’s super-soldier body couldn’t handle and that he was probably freaking out over nothing. But he couldn’t relax until he had solid proof in his hands that Steve was okay and not currently lying on the snow with a brain injury while simultaneously contracting multiple cases of memory loss.
“Lasagne al Forno” - baked lasagna
“That was…” The blond surprisingly found himself at a loss of words.
“cazzo” - fucking
“Alright, alright.” Sarah shook her head and eyeballed her husband who sat cheekily on his throne, watching the mother and her son bicker, fondly.
“What for?”
“Yeah, I wouldn’t count on that,” Natasha snickered as she grabbed her favorite mug from the cupboard to make her own batch of hot chocolate. “Last Christmas, you were the first one to fall for one of their ‘festive pranks’.”
“Because this isn’t the life that I’ve always dreamed of—and I can’t believe that I haven’t realized this until just now…”
It was chaotic.
Yet, Steve couldn’t remember the last time that he had Italian, much less Italian dessert, that wasn’t from Howard Stark’s restaurants. It had never been one of his favorite cuisines and only Howard Stark’s places served Italian that was worth its price. And even if Steve used to frequently visit Howard’s establishments, he almost always ordered the same Italian dish there for it was by far, in Steve’s opinion, the best option of Howard’s entire menu. Everything else Italian that Steve had ever tried always ended up being too cheesy or had too much sauce. Screw him for being picky, and he hated it because it reminded himself of how snotty and wealth-influenced he’s become but Bucky had always told him that the was allowed to have an opinion, even if it was just about how there was gorgonzola cheese on his authentic-Italian pizza instead of mozzarella. But Steve trusted his friend, and if Rhodey said it was worth a shot, he was more than willing to give it a try - especially when he was this hungry and hadn’t had a proper dinner in a week.
And then the music stopped— finally, after the recommended time for Alexander and Eliza’s kiss ended way long ago, the pair eventually, and for Steve, reluctantly pulled apart.
“Well, that’s because Steve never cooks, isn’t that right, punk?”
“Tony, hold on…” The blond told him, calmingly. “This is perfect beca—“
The prince scowled but shrugged, trying to act friendly in front of the curious eyes of the many people beginning to crowd around him and his friends.
“Absolutely not.” Pepper announced to Steve for the second time. “You’re not going anywhere near him. You broke his heart, and he’s still feelings the effects of you leaving, even to this day.”
For now, he would go with happy, despite the rising dread currently developing and bubbling up in the pit of his stomach.
Or did both of them want to?
He strained a smile down at the genius. His eyes were met with the stare of two entrancing, magical chocolate orbs that shined with an enchantment that was brighter than all the sunset-clouds and the stars in the sky, combined.
This guy was unbelievably cute when he stuttered. Tony innerly-squealed and congratulated himself on a flirting-well-done.
“You do whatever you think is best, Pepper.” Steve acknowledged her, anxiety faintly beginning to overwhelm him as he thought about how Rhodey would react to him wanting to talk to Tony. “Again, thank you for even letting us into the tower.”
“OH, IT’S FEATHERS NOW, IS IT? WELL, YOU’RE ONE TO TALK, BIRD-BRAIN!”
Relieved to be free from the tension and uneasiness that had crawled up his throat while he was talking to Rogers, Tony stopped in his tracks to stare at Steve Roger’s gigantic kitchen with wide-opened eyes. The only other kitchen that Tony had been in his entire life that was this spacious was Howard’s and not even Howard’s could have possibly been this high-tech.
“I don’t care. I still think it’s astonishing, nonetheless.”
The prince beamed and continued to spread tiny kisses all over his partner’s hand until he saw that Tony’s attention had diverged onto something else. Steve followed the genius’ gaze up to ultimately admire the scintillating stars above them, although he would much rather prefer to explore and fix his sight on the person directly beside him.
His best friend rubbed his forehead and said, “For goddamn’s sake, Tony!
The brunet anxiously clutched onto two glass containers full of food and shook his head, “Tell me why I agreed to this again.”
Suddenly, Rhodey roamed into the kitchen and plucked the container with the
“I should probably get this checked out,” Steve suggested and held up the book up in the direction of the front desk. “See you later?”
“More than you could ever know.”
“Okay, fine… Maybe — just maybe, — I do…”
“I can’t believe it,” Tony confessed. “I-I’m fine, I just never thought in a million years—I honestly never even considered that they would ever cast me as the lead, this is—“
Frowning, Tony could only stay silent as it wasn’t the best option for his financial status but it wasn’t downright awful so he’ll eventually learn to deal with it. He just hoped that the next two weeks will fly by in a flash so he can finally stop worrying about the next time that his bills roll in and he’s unable to pay them.
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
The total and unquestionable clarity of Steve’s true intentions and unlimited love for the brunet — and knowing that Tony felt the exact same way about him — showed how much the two of them meant to each other. It only confirmed to Steve that Tony was the only person in the entire universe that he was undeniably willing to spend the rest of his life with.
sauce, and his mind wandered over to the topic of his salary. He unquestionably wasn’t making any money presently, and he definitely wasn’t going to make any extra cash by giving his neighbors free
“Don’t worry, Tones. You’re not the only one,” The blond teased affectionately.
The redhead’s gaze intensified as he carried on.
The genius ultimately decided on finishing his work later at his dorm room while he quickly grabbed a black coffee from the library’s own coffee shop. Not his favorite flavor, but he liked to keep up his appearance when the other people in his classes stared at him in awe as he downed entire cups of the bitter liquid in a matter of seconds.
“Couldn’t agree more,” Tony beamed as the blond began to shuffle away from their momentary position in-between the fiction-filled bookshelves.
“Surprise,” Steve’s voice was brushed away by the whistling wind and overcome out by the echoes of the view below them, but he grinned warmheartedly, anyways.
learn how to keep mine to myself.”
“Although I forgive you, that doesn’t mean that I’m just going to drop all these memories down the garbage disposal and forget about what happened. After all, all
Steve couldn’t remember a time in his life that he had ever been happier than the moment that he had learned that he and Tony would be attending Columbia University together and he would get another four years with the irresistible brunet.
Pepper’s expression changed to a petite form of surprise.
In-between the creases of Page 272 and Page 273, was a plain, white slip of paper and a pink Post-It note stuck to the right side. As he took out the first piece of paper and held it gingerly, Tony realized that there was a singular Oreo drawn expertly onto the bookmark. The brunet automatically smiled as he continued to hold up the thin sheet and examined it more thoroughly.
Steve wholeheartedly knew that he should grateful but he didn’t ask for this. No one ever asks for mounds of paperwork that people could literally drown in; he didn’t ask for the responsibilities that came with thousands, maybe even millions, of young artists looking up to him. He only wanted to paint and make a stable living off of it. It wasn’t his fault that his fellow college art students
“Just face it, Tones. You should’ve never quit your job at your dad’s in the first place.”
“I know the feeling,” The person nodded, painfully.
“Language!”
However, if Steve didn’t reciprocate what Tony felt; well that’s where the remaining 18.0704% would come in to ruin everything for him.
Loud gasps reiterated around the room as many people found that they had been conversing with some of their closest friends throughout the whole duration of the party. Most of the guests were too busy flummoxing at the array of different faces and features throughout their vicinity to join in the light, barely-audible applause commending the queen.
“Nice. Same, here.”
“Yeah — Howard Stark — that’s my dad alright. But we never really got along as much as the media thought we did.” Tony explained. “Having a world-renown scientist as a father isn’t as fun as everyone thinks it is. It gets hard having to live up to his expectations every, single, fucking, day.”
— although Steve would
The blond swore that the smile he received from Tony could light up a million cities.
As long as he had known the genius, Steve had never been so close to him without more than just friendly intentions. Sure, they’ve cuddled and slept on each other during sleepovers and movie nights, but no matter how many beguiling memories Steve is able to accumulate of their friendship over the years that he’s known Tony, this feeling of desperateness had never existed until how.
with everything he had or could conceivably offer — that he could ever become anymore capable of loving Steve even more than he already did — because right now, he just couldn’t love him any harder.
“I love you.”
Why was easier for Steve to lie to about a dozen different people who asked if he was okay than it was to tell Tony that he loved him?
“That’s what you get for forcing me to ice-skate with you, Tones!” Steve shouted right back at him as he began making more snowballs of his own.
incredible voice repeat the word “sorry,” for hours-on-end.”

He almost declined Roger’s request when he saw that the blond’s eyes were almost pleading him to agree so he caved in, “Alright,
“Huh, I guess we’re both just chasing daydreams, aren’t we?” The stranger painfully smiled.
“Of course, Steve. But unfortunately, some representatives of your company’s business partners are visiting today and I’m afraid of them thinking that we have more than just a professional relationship.”
He promised himself that he would never take everything that he had for granted and he never did as he learned to be thankful for every little smile and every small gesture of kindness and friendship that Tony displayed towards Steve. It was unlikely for the brunet to ever get so close with someone and Steve had never been more grateful for being one of the few people in the entire universe who had been gifted with that power. The only cruel catch was when reality slapped him across his cheek and reminded him that he was only Tony’s best friend.
“Steve, can’t you see it? This… This could be the
◝◟◞◠◡↝
“If you insist.”
And Nat took another sip of her delicious and perfectly safe hot cocoa.
The gold-covered stranger tried not to acknowledge the blond’s kind words because he felt like he didn’t deserve it.
However, nothing could hurt more than the very depiction of Tony’s disgusted look if Steve ever told him how he truly felt about him — how he wanted to pepper Tony in kisses until his face went numb; how he wanted to wake up next to him, dreary-eyed and tired but content, every morning; and how he wanted to feel Tony’s fragile form underneath him, pressured by the weight of Steve’s body and his love at the same time as they expressed their passion for each other in the ocean of a bed, that they would share. No matter how much Steve tried to shove away his agonizing thoughts, his mind always wandered back to Tony, whether it was because of a blissful memory that he had just recalled, because of a random line of dialogue that one of his butlers had said that sounded like something Tony would say, or because of the way one of his subjects smiled at him, because Steve knew that Tony had a more irresistible smile than his entire kingdom fused together.
“That’s all I ever needed to hear, Tony.” Steve breathed out. “And just, so I can get it out one last time… I love you.”
, going to be in a relationship with you.”
“Thanks, Tones,” Steve let out a breath that he didn’t realize he was holding. “You’re absolutely amazing on stage—actually, you should probably get back out there, shouldn’t you?”
“You’re looking pretty good, yourself,” Tony said as he laced his fingers through Steve’s. “Not bad, Rogers.”
“I’d love it.”
to decorate the Christmas tree.”
───────
Rhodey inhaled sharply but didn’t flinch, “Sorry, Tones, but you can’t sit here in your apartment all day waiting for your culinary degree to just magically put itself to use. You’ve been stuck at home for almost a week now - you’ve got to go out there and actually work! After all, how are you going to go on those baking sprees of yours without any money to actually buy the ingredients?!”
On the other hand, many visitors who were uninterested in dancing, sailed across the room in search for friends, food, drinks, or even a possible date. Even though the party’s many attendants were undeniably different in every feature and form, the range of cultures and races made the aura of the undivided room feel completed. The diversity of S.H.I.E.L.D. as a domain altogether, was truly exhibited within the four walls of a singular ballroom and it empowered Steve to stride forward with a surprising sense of pride for his homeland.
Steve was so ready for this party to be over.
“Don’t think like that, Stevie,” His mother gave him a firm hug. “That boy with begin to love you soon enough, just you wait. He’s just plain stupid if he still hasn’t perceived how caring and loving you are to him.”
“Bucky? Natasha, is that you?” Steve’s face broke into a relieved grin. “Thank the gods — I swear — I don’t seem to know a single person in this room other than you two. By the way, Buck, who asked the question to come here, tonight?”
At first glance, Tony saw that there was a piece of paper was stuck to the front of the red-hardback and he eagerly but carefully, scanned over its words.
Four days before the start of the show, dress rehearsal ended in a total disaster.
No amount of words could ever describe how euphoric this feeling was. Forget synonyms for amazing or nice; fuck trying to find the right words to properly express whatever was happening between the two, right now — there was only one word that fit this feeling, flawlessly — it was just fucking
His feelings and thoughts would have to wait. After the the first few weeks of 9th grade, suddenly everything started to come second only to Tony and the burnet will always continue to be his top priority throughout the rest of Steve’s life. And he wouldn’t change a thing about it.
“You were cast as Eliza?!”
“I could say the same about the guy that I was looking for, but you’re also pretty spectacular. Especially at dancing. And looks-wise, too.” The stranger flirted effortlessly.
If Tony wasn’t so devoted to graduating at the top of his class at age 18 so he could finally escape his parents’ chokehold on him, he would definitely be partying all day and night without a care in the world.
that you made for me this morning. And yes, he told me he loved it and that he ate the
Steve groaned internally.
“It is so on, Steve!” Tony hollered at his chuckling boyfriend who so happened to be hiding behind a mound of snow that he had built while he was on his jog earlier this morning, just so he could attack his boyfriend with snowballs from behind it later on in the day.
And although the moment was passing quicker than the two of them were imagining, Steve fought his body's urge to become nauseous as he began to just grasp the realization that he had actually
The butterflies that had been previously caged in his stomach, suddenly escaped from their captivity, exploded outwards with a tide of newfound emotion, and surged outwards in one massive wave; the flutter of their wings tickling his stomach and lungs.
He definitely needed to capture this moment in his heart forever. Steve made a mental note to paint this entire scene on canvas, later. If his memory ever failed him, he’d be sure to have something to remind himself of this evening — something that Steve would make sure would last forever. Just like it his love for the certain brunet sitting next to him — as cheesy as it sounded.
“But Ty does NOT deserve to be in this musical because he’s a huge, fucking dick to everyone who works with him in any performance, no matter if they’re cast or crew!” Tony hissed at the blond.
If Steve was going to lose Tony to a random stranger tomorrow, he was going to spend and treasure as much time of the next evening as possible with the brunet first, not caring whether the other prince would hate him for it or not.
Tony spun around and ran off, abandoning Steve to drown in his overwhelmingly longing for him.
The disappointment and desolation of his fading existence within Tony’s life, ate away at Steve’s energy and chewed at his mental-stability, wounding him more than any fatal injury from a war’s battlefields ever could. Now, all the prince needed to wait for to give up on his love life, is a ravishing, attractive, and honorable royal who can keep up with Tony’s fast-paced mind, to sweep the genius off his feet and carry him far, far away from Steve.
“Fine,” Tony reluctantly agreed and peacefully trudged into his kitchen while Rhodey silently cheered in his head. “I’ll
Perplexed but honestly satisfied, Tony shrugged Steve’s decision off with only a hint of uncertainty and headed right into the kitchen to aid the millionaire who was cheerfully humming a tune to listen to while he worked.

“I’m fine,” Steve assured him. “What were we doing again?”
“Fuck, Steve… You already blew me away with the carnival — I thought that was already such a perfect date — and now this?” The other licked his lips in concentration. “What did I ever do to deserve you?”
“Cool. Steve?” Rhodey looked at him in question with an expecting smile.
The blond nodded, wanting to relish his time with Tony for a little longer, but decided that it would be best to return back to his royal duties.
As the blond quickly scanned the unofficial "Broadway-Backwards" casting list that was tacked upon a bulletin board
And with Tony’s genius brain, he decided to send Steve on a little quest.
And what better way, than to enjoy their well-deserved time at the carnival?
“Steve? Are you okay? If you’re faking hurt, this isn’t funny!”
“I…” Steve’s gratitude was stolen right from out of his mouth as he gently accepted it. He then proceeded to stare at her in wonder. “I… Thank you. So much. You don’t know how much this means to me, Pepper.”
“Maybe a little bit of both,” he admitted before going back to kiss Tony again.
“Oh yeah, I almost forgot,” Tony smiled and pushed his face into Steve’s, locking their lips. “Happy Four-Year Anniversary, Steven Grant Rogers.”
“Thank you, each and every one of you magnificent guests, for coming to our magical masquerade-ball in celebration of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s 45th anniversary!” Whoops and hollers overwhelmed the air and the king raised a glass of wine in order to toast the ceremony along with the people.
can’t believe that we had ever trusted you to take care of Tony.”
Maybe Tony did have a chance with his absurdly-handsome crush, after all. But he didn’t want to make any assumptions until he had read Steve’s actual message.
He frankly didn’t want to entertain the thought that Tony might not actually want to even look at his face. He had to seize and hold onto every little and last bit of hope that he and his friends could offer himself.
“I swear I didn’t mean to—“
to make them.
and some
“Sorry, Buck.” The blond nervously chuckled. “I think I’m going to have to skip out on this month’s dinner. Again. Sorry…”
Enjoy this prototype chapter! Please let me know if you'd like to read more!
“Aw, come on, sweetheart,” Tony flashed him an adorable smile that seemed to melt all the snow around them. “Please, just this once? I promise that you’ll get the hang of it super easily and then you’ll learn to love it.”
His friend raised one of his eyebrows and said, “Really? You haven’t? And can I ask why, Steve? Why you, one of the smartest people that we know, haven’t just hired a personal chef or a caterer by now?”
“I found this place not too long ago and I’ve been fixing it up little-by-little each time that I’ve visited the castle.” Tony revealed to him, his voice barely discernible. “I’m not a carpenter or a blacksmith, but I’ve managed to patch up the broken and rusted railing, reapply the paint, and reinforce the structure of the bridge. The only thing that I haven’t replaced yet, are the wooden boards.”
The mystery brunet spoke first, “Hey— Are you okay? You looked like your heart just shattered into a million pieces.”
Pepper sighed and gave him a pitiful look.
He stared at the spot where the brunet once stood and whispered a sentence that was never meant to be heard by only his one pair of ears.
Steve was about to reply before Rhodey butted in before he could defend himself.
well-made food could have such a dramatic effect on him? Or maybe this feeling was all caused by the fact that he hadn’t had an actually delectable dish in a very long time and because of how he’s mostly skipped dinner for the past month or so.
“May the rest of your evening be filled with happiness and commemoration of this unforgettable event! Thank you all again, for attending our celebration!”
Steve felt the brunet’s hand slip down to graze his, and he let it linger there for a second before it was suddenly pulled away from him. He could only hope that he had hidden his disappointment well.
And for once, his mind decided to be actually helpful in his despairing situation.
Rhodey shot him an irritated look, “Tony, you don’t actually have any reasons to dislike the guy! Hell, I bet you don’t even dislike him at all! You’re just saying that so you don’t have to go to his house and cook for him! And can I ask you again: Why are so intent on not cooking for Steve? Also, I’ve asked you this already but you do realize that this is your opportunity to literally cook anything you want with the tech of a millionaire’s kitchen?”
“It’s settled then, a chocolate-hazelnut coffee and a kiss. Tomorrow, at 9. Don’t be late.” Tony smirked. “Or else I won’t get either one of what I’ve just been promised.”
“Pfft,” Tony blew air out of his mouth in an exasperated, but loving tone. “Just wait until it’s time to open presents on Christmas Morning. That’ll be a nightmare to deal with.”

he wanted to tell him. It hurt like hell that he still didn’t have the courage to do so, after so fucking long.
“Uh-huh, sure, babe, sure,” Tony sighed contently as he buried himself deeper into Steve’s embrace. “But we both know that I’m right
pan into his preheated oven and set the timer for 45 minutes, the prospects of an actual good boss and all of the benefits that came with working in the house of a millionaire allured his head and Tony’s rapid brain sped off again; this time, he was determined to find some cons that could prove his point to Rhodey if he decided to turn his best friend’s offer down.
“Sounds perfect.” Steve turned around and started walking away when he abruptly spun back around and ran back to the spot where he previously stood. “Except for one thing: Can I ask what your classes are?”
───────
“You do know that he blames himself, right?!” Pepper glared mercilessly at him. “Right now, he’s sitting on my couch, blaming
“Oh, yeah, right,” Steve nodded and looked back down at his desk. “Sorry, I forgot about them. I hope that they’re not bothering you too much. I’ll let you know when I’m done with these letters, Ms. Potts.”
“He’s still helpless over you, are you aware of that, Steve?” Pepper said after a while and surveyed him with her eyes. “You broke his heart by leaving him behind to deal with his horrid father and yet here he is, in my home, with his thoughts still tainted of you. Always you.”
“Are you boys done fighting? My hot cocoa is literally shaking from the combined vibrations of your voices!”
“That’s fucking amazing, Steve!” The brunet’s cheery voice cracked the cage his brain was already building around his burning chest.
The prince of New Ironingham laughed gingerly, “Definitely. Or at least, I hope so.”
“And Tony, I know that right now you’re probably telling yourself, ‘He’s only slightly-interested in you, it’s nothing serious,’ — ” Steve said with an amused expression on his face. “ — That’s literally how well I know you — but I promise you; it’s definitely love that I’m feeling right now. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have used my favorite book to tell you.”
Tony suddenly perked his head up, “By the way, Steve, what
“Steve, I never stopped loving you either. You’ve always been there to push me on through just plain, daily life. You might not realize it but in all of the time that we’ve been apart, all I could think about was how much you’ve ever done for me and how much you meant to me. All I could find my mind drifting to is just the way you smile to cheer me up, the way you pick me up after a fight with my... with Howard, the way you scoot over on your bed to give me room when I just didn’t want to go back to that bastard, the way you just fucking
“Wait, what?”
Way too damn long, as far as Steve thought.
If the book that the genius was still holding had been housing a secret portal, in-between the creases of its chapters and pages, and magically teleported him into a whole new world where Steve actually wanted to take him out on a date, Tony didn’t want to go back to reality. This was unquestionably an unbelievable fairytale or some dumb teen-romance fiction, come true.

Steve sighed, quickly swallowing down the last bit of his meal before running after the brunet, occasionally stopping to greet some of the gardeners that had already started working in the castle gardens.
“You’re right,” Bucky agreed. “I changed my mind. I bet it’s actually going to explode in your face and give you explosive diarrhea. Hey, Rhodes, how much you wanna bet?”
Queen Sarah smiled at the foreigners scattered throughout the ballroom, “Now is the time of the masquerade that we all must remove our masks in unison! Although, we are each as unique as the appearances that we wore this fine night, underneath these intricate disguises lay a cascade of the common faces of humanity, which we are all entwined and connected by, altogether.”
The couple was standing somewhere in the capacious field of Central Park; strangers filed past them as they shouted and spoke in excited tones, each one of them eager to enjoy the last bit of the day at the traveling-carnival.
Tony cocked his head to his side and smiled lovingly at his boyfriend, “Yeah?”
“Unless you don’t want, then I guess I’ll just take someone else out to eat and to shower them with my love.”
“Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?”
Tony exhaled, completely at ease despite knowing that there will be an inevitable ruckus awaiting them when they go back downstairs.
“Don’t say that,” Steve chided him. “Who could ever hate someone as fascinating and easy-to-talk-to as you?”
He loved him back. Or at least, he returned some amount of Tony’s emotionally-painful feelings. It didn’t matter; at least he actually had some form of a chan—
“God fucking dammit, Rhodey,” Tony sighed and flopped down on his couch. “Whatever at this point. And tell me - why did you give him my food and why are you telling me this, again?”
The genius muttered almost incoherently, “You heard me.”
Clint snorted while Natasha just smiled knowingly, and honestly, neither one of their immediate responses surprised Tony.
“Oh, shut up, you worry-bug.” Tony swatted playfully at Steve’s offering hand. “I’m fine, I told you. I guess I’m just worried about tomorrow night.”
“I’ve been tolerating your ‘
With a swift spring back onto his feet, the brunet slid off of the table he was resting on and strolled over to the non-fiction section of the library, scanning its shelves for a potential pastime to indulge himself in. When he didn’t find a single title that interested him or a subject that he wasn’t already an expert in, Tony found himself casually making his way over to the fiction-based area.
“I was actually planning to confess my love for him tonight, but I never found him amongst all the people in the masquerade.”
Steve cast his best friend an unamused scowl. “Not funny, Buck. Literally, I checked my weight three days ago and it’s barely changed - it’s only gone down about five pounds. Again, I’m really fi-“

Steve released the breath he had been unconsciously holding.

sitting in his office and gently placed a glass container of food onto his desk. Bucky, who was previously leaning against Steve’s desk, perked up, swiftly picked up the fragile tub, and squinted his eyes, examining it and its contents closely.
, deeply In love with — Lately, he’s been getting more and more distant — and every time I try to have a proper conversation with him, all I can notice about him is that he’s staring at me with this nameless expression on his face.”
Perhaps it was just Steve’s imagination, and because of his closed eyes he wasn’t able to see Tony’s face, but he swore he could feel Tony reciprocate the kiss as hard as Steve was initiating it. The genius’ lips pressed into his mouth with a vigor that Steve could only dream of and the sweet taste of sugary coffee infiltrated his mouth and his senses. The fake bouquet of flowers that he was holding for the song, dropped to the ground, unnoticed by the couple as Steve snaked his arms around Tony’s waist and the brunet retaliated by clasping onto the blond’s neck, pushing their bodies closer together than ever before.
Next thing the brunet knew, Steve was leading him to the back of the carnival, away from the noise and the rides, and towards a set of hills in a random patch of Central Park that Tony had never bothered to learn the name of. When they finally reached the top of the tallest hill, the genius gasped in surprise as his eyes swept over the breathtaking scene before him.
, Steve wanted so badly to say but the words just got caught in the back of his throat and dissipated within the release of an unsteady breath.
“Yeah, exactly,” Steve grinned, “And
The days after their meeting turned into weeks, and then those turned into months, and eventually, the months sped into a whole year of rambling to each other about their favorite books, movies, professors at MIT, historical artists, historical scientists, formulas for quantum mechanics, and basically about every possible subject under the sun.
“Wait, so you guys didn’t mind the raw beef?” Tony asked in shock. “I’d thought that at least one of you would have a complaint on that.”
“Well, guess what, Steve?” The genius raised an eyebrow as he beamed at the other. “Tonight, I get to be your angel. Sound good?”
As he exhaled the breath he was unconsciously holding, and with love and fondness and his heart throbbing with an indescribable pain, the blond picked up the small brunet and carried him in his arms back into the backstage of the auditorium where he placed him down on a nearby couch and watched over him as he slept. Occasionally, a bewildered cast or crew member would walk by and Steve only had to hush away and dismiss their questions with a single look before they scampered off to continue commissioning the show.
You fucking moron, he scolded himself as his brain immediately began to replay the images of Tony’s hurt and betrayed face as Steve backed off as their mouths were just about to come into contact. He knew how much the musical really mattered to Tony and by refusing to kiss him, Steve felt like he had just personally ruined the entire production of the show.
performance all throughout this week. I also thought that, maybe, just maybe, we could talk, preferably alone, for a few minutes?”
The brunet kind-of wanted to stick around Steve just to see the possibilities that could blossom from their conversations.
Tony’s hazelnut-chocolate eyes shone and glittered brighter than all the stars in the night sky combined before he closed them to lean up and kiss Steve.
“You gave
For some odd reason, Tony just knew that he would get caught, unfortunately, under the mistletoe once more, later tonight. Christmas Day just couldn’t come fast enough.
If the brunet wanted an effective way of communicating his dumb feelings to this incredibly-amazingly-talented god of a college student, he was going to have to do something much more of his style; something that didn’t include walking straight up to Steve and blurting out random, incomprehensible words that would probably just make him weirded-out enough to walk away.
Auditioning for the Columbia University’s unofficial version of Broadway-Backwards Hamilton and actually getting in wasn’t the hard part; the hard part was fighting to keep a straight face as Tony ranted on happily about how excited he was to be sharing the spotlight with Steve. However, the blond didn’t share the same enthusiasm because all throughout the rest of the day he kept having to remind himself that he and the brunet were just friends, despite how much Steve wanted them to be more.
“Everything just feels right about him, Ma, Pa. I know this sounds foolish but he just fits so perfectly in my arms whenever I wrap them around him. He smells like my daydreams; filled with carnations and daises, and the fresh aroma of nature, and he looks like an absolute angel.” Steve breathed out. “Everything abut him is just so captivating, so astoundingly right; like he was made to fit into my embrace or made to be the perfect height for me to rest my head on top of his. It was like the universe created him flawlessly, just for me.”
“I mean, I was going to ask you either way,” He argued with his wife. “It’s just, I was so far away from you at the time and you just happened to be already riding horseback all the way to Americandia from freaking Redinaroom— so what if you asked first?”
“Tony?!” The prince almost didn’t believe his own eyes.
Holding a masquerade ball to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the amalgamation of all six original kingdoms into the land that is now known as S.H.I.E.L.D., had seemed like a bad choice to the young prince at first, but Steve soon found himself impatiently itching for the evening to arrive so he could finally find Tony and ask him to dance with him, without having to worry about the brunet thinking he was unworthy of being seen with him.
“Hush, Steve.” Tony grinned as he led his unfairly-tall partner onto the thick layer of ice covering The Pond, one of New York City’s many lakes located in Central Park. “Just let your feet guide and glide you. It’s easy, c’mon. See?”
What Steve had in store for him couldn’t be good if he only needed one line of text to express it, right? Or maybe, Tony could be completely wrong.
An announcer with a plain white mask, called for the party’s attention, “Everyone, please welcome his royal highness, Prince Steven Grant Rogers!”
Right. The mistletoe.
Tiberius took a wary step back.
“Can I talk to you real quick, baby?”
His pupils swiveled around as he eyed the two of them.
“You were supposed to treat him right! FUCKING HELL, STEVE!” The recent college-graduate howled in the room, and his ears started ringing in reminiscence. “YOU WERE THE ONE PERSON WHO
And the best part about his boyfriend: was that Tony knew that he would do the exact same for him.
is for someone that’s much posher and richer than I am.”
───────
“Sorry Tones, but I have no regrets because now I have the upper-hand,” Steve grinned as he began to mercilessly tickle the genius. “Now surrender.”
Steve didn’t expect for this many guests to be attending the ball.
“Tony.”
Tony grinned, “So, I take it you’ve read the book first and then watched the movie?”
A slight breeze gusted through the space in-between the two as they locked their hands together.
This was everything that he had ever wanted in his life — and with everything that he currently possessed, he was more than just simply content.
“Thanks a lot, Katniss.” Tony huffed in amusement. “We appreciate it, we truly do.”
An awkward silence fell between the two and the brunet suddenly had the urge to interrupt it.
“Seriously, Thor?” Tony frowned as he looked up to face the dangling, taunting piece of mistletoe hanging above the living room’s doorway.
Looking back at his friends, who all motioned him to follow the redhead, Steve shot up out of his chair and clambered up after her in an effort to look presentable to the genius. His nerves fluttered thought his stomach but he pushed through them, gripping his clammy hands into fists as he traveled up a few floors in an elevator and approached a grand, metallic door.
Steve groaned at the mention of the nickname that Tony had given to him when they were children. The horrendous idea came together in Tony’s mind after a certain horse trodding by — that the previous Captain of the Royal Guards had been riding on — broke an icicle from a nearby rooftop, which fell on top of Steve’s head while the two of them were playing outside in the snow. Thankfully, he had only received a mild bruise that lasted a few days, but the humiliation that he had suffered through after the incident persisted on for over a month. Steve knew that Tony only called him that to get on his nerves, but the thought of the accident, even after all these years, was still able to bother him. Sometimes, Tony’s insanely-smart brain was a curse to all the kingdoms combined.
“Promise you’ll be there?” He mumbled into Steve’s chest.
King Joseph cleared his throat to call for the room’s attention.
There he was. Tony, with his tousled and casually swept, brown hair, his brilliant and gleaming, chocolate-hazelnut eyes, and his pink-tainted lips which were currently displaying a breathtakingly, entrancing smile.
Tony took in a deep, calming breath, and while feeling Steve’s eyes closely watching his every move, cracked open the front cover to “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,” and flipped to Page 273.
“Goddammit, Steve!” Tony pried Steve’s hand off of his mouth as they began to playfully wrestle. "I was so fucking worried — don’t you ever do that to me again, you hear me?!”
Below the text was the pink sticky note that Tony had glimpsed earlier but didn’t get to read. As if the first sentence wasn’t enough, another set of words — but this time written elegantly onto the Post-It — managed to pry open and fill the brunet’s heart up with emotion, a tiny bit more than before.
“Tony,” Steve sighed, “You’re causing a scene… again.”
Finally, Steve and the brunet parted and the prince stopped in front of the stranger to regain his serenity and waited for the other to do the same.
The blond’s eyes twinkled and he closed them as he bent down to press light kisses across Tony’s nose and forehead.
“Goddamnit,” Steve whispered as his eyes traveled up and down his boyfriend. “Tony, remind me to close my eyes next time you decide to look this beautiful. I think, I might just go blind.”
sauce went on top of the pasta, a layer of
“Goddammit, Steve.” Bucky put his arm against his forehead, again. “What the hell are we going to do with you?”
As far as the blond knew from personal experience, never.
The prince just simply could not stop thinking about the young Stark; each night his dream’s were filled to the brim with the genius’ quirky and sparkling, hazelnut-eyes, and Steve would often be startled awake from his fantasies to the ghost of a kiss tingling on his lips.
“Ma, that’s entirely untrue, and you know that.” Steve sighed, a small smile inching onto his face as his mind began to fill up with thoughts of Tony. “He could never be stupid because every royal family in this world knows that he is by far, the most brilliant and creative royal to be born and raised, in centuries. He’s just too incredibly clever, especially for someone like me.”
Steve, thanking the cosmos for blessing him with the perfection that stood in from of him and the new chance that he had just been granted, chuckled; his voice vibrating with love that erupted from the inside of his chest with every sound he made.
“Well, I guess the feeling’s mutual, isn’t it now?”
“Just, treat him right this time, okay? He deserves so much more than he believes he does. And truthfully, I trust that you truly are the one to make him see that.”
Tears threatened to leak out of the corner of Steve’s eyes and he wiped them away quickly, silently hoping that no one had seen him.
Warning!: This chapter is quite cheesy. (Ha! Get it? I made a food pun.) Nevertheless, I hope that you enjoy reading it! Stay safe out there!
The masked-figure sighed as if he was grudgingly accepting his unfortunate fate.
“I love you, so fucking much, you know that, right?” The brunet turned around, mumbling into Steve’s chest.
Was this not all just Steve’s imagination tricking him into seeing what he’s been dreaming and always wishing to see since high school?
Abruptly, Pepper looked up to survey his expression. Her face lifted into a minuscule, but true smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve just gave Tony’s blank face a knowing look as the genius blinked a couple of times as if he still hadn’t processed the information in his head yet.
“I-I…” He faltered.
The worker gave them a small bob of her head and left.
“Just shut up and kiss me.”
No matter what his co-actors were probably thinking about them right now, no matter how loud the audience was cheering and clapping, no matter how many snickers the two could hear coming from the back of the stage, no matter how many phone’s cameras clicked and snapped pictures of the two, Steve was determined to hang onto this one miracle that happened right in this moment for as long as possible.
“Please — Just, promise me that if you’re feeling disappointed that you’ll hide it from me. And hide it well.” He pleaded desperately, his brown eyes full of distress. “Please. Just promise me.”
Tony gritted his teeth, “I already fucking told you why I left that
Tony chuckled, “Steve, if I force my body to be any closer to you, I think we might accidentally glue ourselves together.”
“No worries, babe,” the brunet assured him as they drifted towards each other, meeting in the middle with their torsos pressed up together. “C’mere. I’ve got you, m’kay?”
Tony had barged into Steve’s room in the Americandian castle, at 7 AM in the morning, and practically dragged the blond down through his own castle’s garden, to show him something that he had apparently “just discovered the other day.” Normally, Steve would refuse to leave the comfort of the castle grounds without eating a whole meal first, but this was Tony who he was following, and Steve would honestly follow him to the ends of the Earth.
───────
Taking the note with him, the genius raced to the library after all of his classes had ended, logged onto one of the building’s public computers, briskly opened up the library’s catalog, and searched up the book belonging to the class number in Tony’s hand.
His friend sighed and said, “Steve, you really know that you can’t keep doing this forever, right? I’m- We’re
“Tones! Do you mind if Sam, Bucky, and I got a head start in decorating the tree, right now? Those two are itching for something to do that doesn’t involve snow or ice.”
Pepper handed out various chips and other snacks to Steve’s friends and left the room just as fast as she had arrived.
“This is so much more better than my daydreams,” Tony exhaled suddenly in faint, relieved puffs of air.

was Steve doing to him? How was he opening up so quickly to this random stranger so quickly?

sauce, and topped it all with more mozzarella cheese.
“Thanks, Jar,” Tony sighed in relief as he carefully flopped onto the couch against his boyfriend’s comfortable shoulder with two cups of thankfully, untampered hot chocolate and handed the one with the Iron Man-themed mug to Steve.
“Don’t worry, Tones, I am. I could never be uncomfortable around you.”
The brunet seemed so far away…
The last couple of precious minutes that they had at the very peak of the Ferris wheel were affectionately-kissed and whisked away, and all of a sudden, the two of them were back on the ground again.
By the late evening, the masquerade was already in full-swing as many of the guests attending the party began to shuffle onto the now-full, dance floor. The people who refused to join the waltz, stood to the side of the ballroom, and stared at Steve, clearly waiting for him to pick a partner and participate in the dance. Steve saw a group of young ladies loitering near the grand-stage, giggling as they ogled their eyes and fluttered their eyelashes at him, each one of them anticipating an appropriate time to snatch a chance to speak with the prince.
Suddenly, the Ferris wheel slowly halted to a stop and the couple’s seat began to dangle back and forth right at the very top of the ride.
A short break started for the two as “Satisfied” began to play on stage and Pepper Potts began to belt out in her powerful and entrancing voice.
“Will you two just let me eat already?” Steve barked. “I don’t need that image in my head right now!”
“I’ll see you tomorrow at the gala, right?” Steve asked Tony, innerly-wishing that he didn’t have to leave so soon.
The view was breathtaking. Almost as beautiful as the person who stood next to Steve, drinking in the sight of the landscape along with him.
movie?!”
Sure, he could afford food for weeks and maybe even months to come, but that didn’t always mean he wanted 5-star meals for the rest of his life. Sometimes a nice inexpensive burger could really satisfy Steve’s cravings, especially after long hours holed up in his art studio. Speaking of which, a burger and some fries sounded really good to his appetite right about now.
“Then prove it.” She declared in a harsh, even tone. “If I were to give you one choice, one option, one move, just one simple action, in order for you to express that you still cared for him, what would it be? How would you show that you still loved him after all this time; how would you even start an attempt to win him back in the absolute most sincere, caring, and passionate way possible? What would you do, in a way that you can describe in four words or less?”
After walking down all the way from Columbia University, the two of them were due for a date — especially since it was their four-year anniversary and they haven’t had one in well-over a month.
“He really misses you, he really does. I know deep down that he still loves you, although he might not let you onto that at first because he’s still completely broken over the fact that you had just left him without any word whatsoever, but I assure you that he’s still over-the-moon in love with you — no matter how much Rhodey and I have tried to tell him to move on.”
. Perfectly, perfect in every single way that Tony’s mind could come up with at the moment. Perfect in the way that their noses and fitted so well together, perfect in the way that Steve hugged the genius by his waist with gentle hands, and perfect in the way that Tony’s arms were just the right length to fully wrap them around the blond’s neck.
Tony was falling fast for Steve. And he was falling hard.
───────
“Hold on, before we start,” Steve pulled Tony back in for another spellbinding kiss. “Happy Four-Year Anniversary, Tony.”
“Of course, Ms. Potts, take all the time that you need.” The cashier acceded, led them to a door in the back of the shop and unlocked it.
And Steve pounced on him.
Steve finally shut him up by smashing his lips onto the other prince’s, causing the two of them to stumble into the bridge’s railing.
“You know what, why don’t we just let Bruce hold onto the bowl?” Tony suggested as he shoved the popcorn into the scientist’s hands to keep it away from Clint. “After all, he is the one who made it for us.”
“It’s almost the exact same for me,” The brunet whispered as his eyes traveled across the scenery that was splayed in front of them.
As if by magic, everything had suddenly just clicked right into place, all within the span of a day, all within the words of a single message from a good friend.
“Right,” Steve nodded in appreciation as he picked up the hardback. “Sorry, I — damnit — I just apologized again, didn’t I?”
How did he just realize it?
“And I am not throwing away my shot!”
“Doesn’t matter, babe! The only thing that mattered is that I got you to successfully ice-skate with me for the first time in your life without any one of us getting injured! And you had a good time, which is a bonus!” Tony smirked while throwing back even more snowballs.
Several minutes later, two unidentifiable guests, a male and a female, strolled towards the blond and one of them waved an energetic arm back and forth as he greeted him.
“I wish I could show you this guy that I’m talking about. He’s flawless — literally. He’s unrivaled throughout all of fucking S.H.I.E.L.D., he’s goddamn hot as all hell, undefeated in sparring and horseback-racing; he’s got the best manners out of anyone I know, including my own parents, and my parents are super-strictly professional. He’s the nicest human being that has ever existed on this planet; no, make that the entire fucking universe. His smile not only illuminates my entire fucking world, but I swear it could light up an entire kingdom brighter than the actual fucking sun.”
Tony giggled as the blond cracked a shy smile.
“Hey.”
“Wh-what?!” Tony groaned as he buried his face into Rhodey’s chest. “Rhodey! Why would you give a millionaire my crappy, barely-have woken up
“Pepper,” He mumbled. “You’re entirely right. You always have been and you always will be, but you’re not aware of what I’m trying to convey. I still love him, Pep.”
Love y'all 3,000!
The brunet had never finished his sentence. He couldn’t because Howard had proceeded to snatch the phone from out of his hands and smash it into the ground, but not before Tony had sent the text. The screen had cracked upon impact, not unlike the way his father then commenced to slam his own son’s body into the ground, beating him until not a spot on him was covered in blood or a bruise, and leaving him to whither in his pain.
The genius sighed as he shut his eyes, stood on his toes, and pecked Thor on his cheek before quickly taking a step back away from the doorway and its “cursed” mistletoe.
didn’t do it at all, but thanks anyways.”
Steve took the pause that subsided between the two as an advantage to peer closer at the mystery person’s eyes. They were a mesmerizing, chocolate-hazelnut brown, and if Steve looked hard enough, he could count every single one of the stars’ reflection glistening inside them. Each individual flicker of glowing white and yellow, stood out against the midnight-black of their pupils, forming the picture of a practical fairytale inside Steve’s vision and mind — and he just couldn’t help but be absolutely captivated to an infinite extent. The sheer beauty of this stranger was unpredictably but also familiarly overwhelming.
Steve’s stomach lightly growled at the thought but he pushed his mind to concentrate on finishing those letters that he was supposed to have done half-an-hour ago. He could think about food later after he’d completed the rest of his ever-growing mountain of paperwork.
Maybe it wasn’t fair to Rhodey and his side of the argument, after all, how bad could Steve really be? If Rhodey was speaking so much praise about this one guy, then he must really be a sucker for Rogers because Rhodey almost never expressed general admiration for anyone. Although he still wasn’t one-hundred percent convinced, it was oddly soothing to hear his best friend comfort him and assure him that a future-possible boss of Tony’s would actually be a nice person - a major contrast against all of the bosses he’s worked in the past.
“I’m glad that you and the others are worried about me, Buck, but I’ll be fine. I’ve got leftovers and some
at home and I desperately need to finish this. You know how important this is to me.”

, or slices of chocolate cake. As much as he regrets admitting it, Steve kind of started to miss those awful barbecue grill-outs that Bucky used to host once every two months. Extra well-done yet questionable meats sounded much better than the half-eaten pepperoni
“Hey! Those scraps of paper are actually recipes that I’m working on! Don’t you dare criticize them!”
Steve hastily nodded and waited patiently for Pepper to come back through the door, his hands still queasily gripping the drink she had gifted him.
Love you all 3,000!
“Yeah, but is this work really that important when it’s messing with both your sleep schedule and your eating habits? I swear that if you stepped on a scale right now it would start flying because of how much weight you’ve lost!”
Perhaps he shouldn’t have chosen to prepare
“I miss it so

Everything was blurring by so quickly; each song started and ended like bullets flying through the air, dropping to the ground with a clatter as quickly as they had shot out, and it was no help in calming down Steve’s nerves.
that I had tasted before.”
This beautiful, brilliant, absolute-captivation of a person had just gotten the lead role in a huge campus-round musical and he cared more about whether his best-friend had gotten in than his own personal, and well-deserved, success.
“Yeah,” The unknown person — Golden, as Steve started calling him in his head — said. “That’s probably a good idea. I’d love to spend some more time with you, Mr. Americandian Hercules.”
’ ever since elementary school,” Steve groaned as he sat down on the bench next to Tony. “But that’s fine, if it means I get to spend the rest of my life with you — then I’ll happily live through it.”
“I DON’T KNOW! UGH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT, FEATHERS!”
Tony scoffed, “Did you just want an excuse to drag me out of my very comfortable spot on the couch so you could kiss me, or is this just a way to make-out with me without the team complaining?”
as this guy’s introductory dish to Italian culture and cuisine - it had never been the most favorited among his wide-selection of recipes by those who have tried it before because of the raw meat in the dish, but Tony knew that it was still a fairly well-crafted recipe and he could only hope that he hadn’t accidentally screwed up something while in the process of making it. He hadn’t tasted the dish beforehand because he wanted to preserve it in the freshest possible condition for Rogers but he desperately did not want a repeat of the day that he had accidentally mistaken a glass bottle of salt for sugar in one of his dad’s restaurant. The result ended up in one of the customer’s

Inside his head, Tony facepalmed himself but somehow allowed his face to display the teasing smirk that his reaction was unconsciously urging on, “I’ve spoken one word, Mr. Rogers and it was literally just ‘Hi.’ If this is your definition of
His voice choked on light tears.
Steve, because he was the one who baked all the cookies in the first place, speedily scooped up one chocolate-chip cookie, blew on it until it cooled down enough, and handed it to Tony, then briskly plucked a sugar cookie for himself, knowing that the small burns he received, in turn, would heal in a few minutes.
“Yeah, someone brought me here before and I guess I just really liked the peacefulness of it.”
“WHAT THE HECK, CLINT?! HOW THE ABSOLUTE HELL DO YOU COMBINE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT TOGETHER? THAT MAKES NO GODDAMN SENSE!”
“dannato tiramisù” - damn tiramisu
“Tony?”
Throughout the couple’s countless dates, Steve was sure that this one has been, by far, the most perfect: Almost like a daydream.
The elevator dinged and Rhodey gazed at a very still Tony, awaiting an answer.
“Follow me,” Pepper directed him.
Bucky started to cackle but thankfully Rhodey forced him out of Steve’s office, finally bringing some peace into the room.
The prince almost rolled his eyes in front of his new, absurdly-beautiful acquaintance. He knew he shouldn’t have worn such a mask as flashy as the red, white, and blue one he already had on.
The couple collided together and went tumbling down, landing onto the soft snow with a subtle crunch under their bodies.
✧ ─────── ♡ ─────── ✧
Tony must be really invested in this musical, otherwise he wouldn’t be kissing him so hard right now. The thought of the brunet’s dedication to the believability of the performance was both amusing and heartbreaking at the same time.
Pepper entered the room to reveal a chocolate hazelnut frappe with chocolate chunks that was covered in caramel drizzle in her right hand, complete with a singular straw. She held the delicacy out to him.
Glaring at his best friend, Tony glanced at his clock, checked the time, swiveled around, and started to walk towards the kitchen, “Now if you’ll excuse me, since we’ve been arguing all morning and now that it’s 10 AM, I’m going to go start making myself some
real: It was just too good —
“SURRENDER, ANTHONY EDWARD STARK!”
He paused for a cathartic second.
And when Tony persisted in doing everything he conceivably could to ensure that both of them got into the same college together, Steve had finally snapped to his senses and realized that he was chest-deep in love with the genius.
Within seconds, Steve had already won four giant stuffed-animal prizes for Tony and summoned a small crowd around him, each person gawking at his throwing skills, as the blond knocked over dozens and dozens of milk bottles without breaking a sweat. They ended up keeping only two of the plushies because they gave away the others to two crying little kids who they had comforted in the middle of the carnival after they had gotten separated from their parents. Later, when the children were reunited with their family and had successfully stopped sobbing, the parents had thanked the two of them immensely, sincerely. And if Tony was going to be truthful — he actually quite liked the proud feeling that blossomed inside his chest afterwards — it made him feel like a real-life superhero.
“I already bought us some,” The blond told his confused partner. “Follow me.”
As his eyes began searching the area around them for the nearest snack stand, Steve gently tugged at his arm and shook his head.
“Surrender, Stark! Last chance!”
good; Bucky’s undoubtedly done it a couple of times before, too - especially with Sam’s mom’s hot fudge lava cake, - but Steve couldn’t remember the last time he loved a dessert so much. It was definitely more than just a strange craving and he was certainly not starving for sweets, so it must’ve been the specific way that the recipe was followed that could flip his stomach like this. Was this how Rhodey felt whenever he ate one of these dishes? How could he have such self-control to not have eaten the entire thing?
“Hey, shouldn’t you be preparing for the ball right now, anyways? Your kingdom is hosting it this year, so no-doubt that everyone’s trying to do their best in making the castle look presentable. Although, no castle should have this many red, white, and blue flowers out in the front yard.”
By now, Tony had already turned around, facing the doorway to his kitchen but Rhodey knew for sure that he had been listening. Frankly, it was pretty had to get Tony to listen to him but if he just threw in the perfect words and formed it all into some kind of semi-emotional speech, he was almost guaranteed a positive response in favor of Tony’s own health.
“I — I just can’t believe it…” Tony said. “All this time, you were talking about how much you love
“No, I think I’ve known you long enough to assure you that you’re quite an amazing and compelling person, and anyone would be extremely lucky to be able to date you.” Steve said.
The two locked eyes.
“It’s
Suddenly, Pepper received a notification on her phone, paused to see Steve’s intrigued reaction for a moment, before ultimately pulling out her device to review whatever had just interrupted her appointment.
“FOR FUCK’S SAKE THOR, HOW THE HELL DID YOU MANAGE TO KNOCK DOWN THE ENTIRE CHRISTMAS TREE?! IT’S LIKE THREE TIMES YOUR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT COMBINED!”
“Tell him that I couldn’t make it today and that I promise to be there next time. And make sure to let him know that I’m sorry, really sorry.”
Suddenly, the blond realized something as his mind reignited and recalled a statement from a few minutes before that he had left unfinished.
The entire ballroom erupted into applause and cheered as the king and queen bowed, graciously descended the platform, and left.
She still didn’t look very convinced.
It just had to be pure luck that the annual traveling-carnival had just popped by in New York City and constructed its grand palace of lights and amusement rides within a huge section of land in the middle of Central Park. And Steve and Tony knew without question that this was their opportunity to take the rest of the week off before they had college to worry about again.
hog the bowl! If anything, it’s Thor who keeps eating all of the popcorn because of his huge appetite!”
This one pierced through him more painfully than the others usually would. However, Steve was expecting it so it didn’t catch him by surprise as much as he thought it would.
“You must be in deep-shit love with me or something, because that’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.” Tony joked. “But I don’t blame you, I am irresistible, after all.”
“That’s a surprisingly really good answer, Steve.” Her eyes brightened up a lot more and she focused on him.
into his mouth.
He just missed Tony so goddamn much. He missed his love. So if it meant suffering here in this cold, noiseless conference room wallowing in his own guilt and self-deprecation, would give him an opportunity to see Tony’s captivating eyes just one more time, he would undoubtedly comply.
“Goddamn it.”
She turned her head halfway before deciding to not see the impression on Steve’s face. Her lips parted to let out a deep sigh that vibrated around the room.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
“But I’m glad that you did because it helps me remember that you’ll always be with me through every shitty thing that life throws at me… and us.”
“Hurry up, Capsicle!” The genius shouted, directing his voice to Steve, who was right behind him. “It’s right outside of the castle gardens!”
───────
“Good,” Tony said, flashing him a beam as bright as the sun. “‘Cause I intend on sticking with you for quite a while, so get used to it.”
“Yeah, I get it,” Steve smiled, and stuck his fork into the dessert, slicing out a small bite.
However, despite outright declining his friend’s offers of payment and refusing to speak about the subject of his salary, it had always been one of Tony’s biggest worries. But if he worked for a millionaire, and the millionaire liked what he was doing, Tony was sure to at least make enough to last until the next year - and if he had any extra, he’d for sure be spending it all on those pricey bittersweet chocolate chips for his
Rhodey let out a very audible breath and contemplated Steve’s figure still frantically scribbling somehow neat words onto his letters.

Steve drank in the stillness of the conference room as all eyes were on him.
Tony raised his head to peek over the top of the book and his mouth hung wide open, gaping at the blond behind the hardcover’s covers.
He inhaled a ragged breath.
Tony had repaired the pendant out of the pure-goodness of his heart, and Steve had always known about the unstated kindness of his actions, no matter how many times Tony had denied it as a favor that he had owed to the Americandian Queen. The straightforward act of thoughtfulness he had exhibited on that day had just confirmed the suspicions Steve was having about his feelings. Since then on, each selfless, charitable, and good-natured deed that Tony conducted, shifted the key another click in the lock to Steve’s heart.

Rhodey rolled his eyes and placed his hands on Tony’s shoulders, “I gave
About a quarter of an hour later, Pepper materialized from the tower’s hallways into the room.
“Here I am,” the brunet cast his best friend an annoyed look. “Where do you want me to set these?”
Birds chirped high in the air as they began to settle down for the end of the day and occasionally, a butterfly would flutter past, floating down onto the tips of nearby leaves or buds of the park’s flowers. The floodlights below them dotted the rolling fields in an unusual pattern of bursts of luminescence and casted long and narrow, dark shadows at the same time. Scattered throughout the tall grass were a handful of fireflies, and the glows of their tiny bodies just made the view around Tony even more mystical and welcoming than it was already.
“Don’t worry, Stevie!” Bucky patted him on the back. “I’m sure you guys will confess your undying love for each other soon enough; but honestly, you really do need all the help that you can get, you oblivious idiot. By the way, where is Tony, anyways?”
“Yeah, of course, Tones.”
“Hey Steve,” Pepper momentarily stuck her head through a crack in the door. “I brought you something to increase your chances of winning him back. A peace offering, at most.”
The sky began to get increasingly darker and more faint shimmers of stars started popping up and getting more intense in the night sky. However, the last bits of the sun still peeked over the New York horizon and its light continued to tint the west edge of the black void above in a candescent glow of different hues of pink, orange, and yellow.
“Tony. Listen to me, please.”
“For fuck’s sake, Tony,” The blond couldn’t help but crack a smile. “Just get in the goddamn seat.”
The brunet gasped dramatically, “After that moment that we just had? Absolutely, not. I’m going with you, whether you like it or not.”
He tried exhaustingly squirming out of it and pulling away in an attempt to fight back before reluctantly letting himself be held by the stronger person, and surprisingly found himself kissing back.
“In your dreams, Capsicle!” Tony retorted as he chucked a fistful of snow at Steve’s head and resumed his struggle against the blond’s hold on him.
“Why don’t you find out for yourself?”
The blond remembered when a month ago, he and his friends had spotted Pepper across a coffee shop in mid-Manhattan. She was ordering two drinks, a coffee and what seemed to be a frappe. Before she could recognize Steve in the crowd of customers, he sprinted over to her to ask her if he could speak to Tony. The redhead’s eyes had hardened straightaway when she had identified Steve as the one talking to her.
If he was imagining this or if this was all just a dream, Steve begged his brain not to stop now.
He breathed in deeply and looked up at the blond, smiling softly.
“And the year after that,” Tony went on.
“OH WILL THE TWO OF YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP AND HELP ME CLEAN UP THIS MESS?!” Clint roared, probably loud enough to be heard from space.
Clint and Thor, along with Tony, perked up the most in their seats as Steve untangled himself from his boyfriend to get up and take out the Christmas-themed cookies that he had plopped into the oven about an hour ago.
↜◡◠◟◞◜♡◝◟◞◠◡↝
“Exactly!” The blond clamped his mouth shut from his sudden outburst. “Damnit, I’m so sorry. It’s hard to control my voice when I’m talking about something that I’m really passionate about. But yeah, people should really read the book even if they’ve already seen the movie. They’re just missing out on so much from the book that never made it into the film.”
She looked down at the other cup in her left hand. The one filled with a chocolate hazelnut frappe with chocolate chunks and covered in caramel drizzle: Tony’s secret favorite drink from any coffee shop that could make it.
What if one of the snowballs that Tony had thrown at him had hit his head and now he’s in so much pain that he can’t even speak? What if he has a concussion, or worse, what if that snowball had knocked him out and by the time Tony finds him and manages to wake him up, he’ll already have a severe case of amnesia and won’t be able to remember all his years dating Tony at all? What if he’s dead?!
And somehow, Tony was okay with that.
That was a whole year-and-a-half ago.
“Oh, admit it! You enjoyed it!”
“Because I’m an awesome, fantastic best friend and because you needed to pull your life together.”
But when Tony slowly wandered back into the living room where Rhodey and Rogers were currently talking, his feet stopped as his eyes feasted on the sight of his best friend and his boss blissfully munching away at the remaining pieces of what used to be the
An all-too familiar book jutted out an inch farther than its neighbors out of its shelf, catching Tony’s attention within a few seconds of arrival.
’ was heard as it echoed, bouncing off of the walls. There was a wet rag left on the countertop that had previously gone unnoticed by Tony’s eyes and he examined more closely once he had realized it was there. It seemed as if Rogers decided to do some last-minute cleaning before his personal chef got here - the thought of a millionaire personally taking the time and effort to clean up their house for their future “servant” made Tony raise his eyebrows in appreciation. However, Rogers hadn’t gotten very far into his cleaning before Rhodey and Tony had shown up and the rag sat on the countertop, completely forgotten as Rogers and Rhodey happily raved on about some new art exhibit that had recently opened for amateur artists.
The sheepish and guilty-faced children nodded their heads before hurrying — more like scrambling — back to the nearest side of the lake as they chased each other in a mad dash for their parents.
“Language,” the genius chided his boyfriend in a mocking tone, as he climbed into the wobbly carriage awaiting them at the bottom of the Ferris wheel.
A million questions raced through Tony’s head as he felt his heart start to pick up its pace, the longer he stared into Steve’s handsome face — Was there any other synonyms that Tony hadn’t used yet to describe the absolute perfection of this person’s bodily features? The brunet was sure he should have run out of words that had the same meaning as “beautiful,” by now.
“It’s just — the carnival date, the Ferris wheel, winning all those prizes — and now this? You did all of this… for me?”
Steve and Tony gave each other unsurprised looks as they continued to listen to the commotion coming from downstairs, aware that the Christmas tree decorating, which had previously been paused so that the team could watch Christmas movies together, — and was now resumed — hadn’t gone as planned.

“Leaving for Broadway isn’t what I’ve been dreaming of my life being because in my dreams… you were always there with me,” Tony confessed. “This isn’t my dream life because
Steve went back to pecking his lips across Tony’s ethereal face and when he felt the brunet tense up under him, he planted his mouth firmly against the genius’ temple and softly dragged it down to his jawline without lifting it off his skin. Immediately, Tony shuddered, biting back a moan, and began to fall limp in Steve’s arms and the blond cradled his loosened form against his own body. He took this as an opportunity to run his hands through Tony’s feathery and silky chocolate hair, rubbing his hands in certain spots along the brunet’s scalp that helped relax him even more. When Steve pulled back, the other prince in his arms whined weakly and clung onto his torso, refusing to let go.

delicious treat, you’re definitely, truly forgiven.”
“That’s what I thought.”
A blanket was lain across the ground at the very center of the hill, constructing the most perfect spot to spend the rest of the night watching the sun finally lose its last traces of light as it crossed lower and lower into the sky, eventually dipping under the horizon. Oddly, there was a vase in the middle of the cloth, but several sticks of cotton candy were arranged neatly inside the glass container, along with a few different shades of pink roses.
“Wait, Steve!”
“Do you want to get something to eat?” Steve asked, maneuvering through the hoards of people as he tightly clutched Tony’s hand. “Cotton candy, maybe?”
Tony’s words struck a chord in Steve’s heart like a brutal knife slicing through a piece of cake.
“He’s — just so, indescribably,
“Tony.”
Maybe he could actually survive until the end of the song. Until the part when—

“No.” She stated, instantly.

Around a fanatical, 14 seconds later, which Steve had counted in his head, he pulled back and cradled Tony’s head in his hands, forcing the genius to pay attention to him.
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologized in a bare whisper and he could feel Tony barely clutching onto consciousness in order to listen to him. “I guess I’m just nervous. I know how much this musical means to you—it’s your favorite, in fact—and I just don’t want to be the person who screws it all up.”
The mystery-person hesitated before pressing on.
The golden-boy hummed in approval and seemed to be smiling at a memory in his head.

“Hey, I asked you a quest-“
“Just remember to stay in
His heart stopped.
The brunet smiled, his mind immediately thinking of the sweet-tasting fluff and all of the cavities that he would soon be getting.

Steve gestured to the carnival bursting with bright lights and life around them, “What do you think, Tony?”
Steve glowered at his best friend, “Bucky, for the last damn time: I’m fine. Go enjoy your dinner with everyone else, I’m staying here to finish this stuff up no matter what you do or tell me. You could try dragging me down to the lobby for all I care, it’s still not going to work.”

for lunch.”
“What…?” The other’s voice had diminished into a hushed tone. “Wait… really?”
“Steve?...”
“That’s right.” The younger one laughed and began to walk backwards, his attention still turned towards Steve. “Look, I have to go now. I’ll talk to you later, Steve.”
Thoughts and contemplations of the past and the future like these, were what drove the blond crazy with bittersweet melancholy and quiet thankfulness; both directed at the universe and its ever-confusing ways of carrying out its plans for each individual’s destinies. Although Steve knew that his boyfriend had never believed in fate, — or “that bullcrap,” as Tony liked to refer it as, — he had always learned from his mother to wholeheartedly trust the cosmos’ constant judgement. And currently, Steve had never been so glad that he had listened to her, because now — after all the hardships and setbacks that he had ever faced in his life — he was finally being rewarded with the company of something, or rather, someone, that had truly made everything he had ever suffered through, all worth it.
Queen Sarah clucked her tongue in mirth, “Nonsense, Steven, that boy is truly oblivious if he still cannot notice your feelings for him, no matter what you do. I might as well have to slap him in the face with your bleeding heart before he realizes that you love him.”
“Liar,” Steve shot his best friend a look as he cautiously accepted the food from Rhodey’s hands. “Since when were you the optimist around here?”
Natasha snickered, “No offense, Steve, but I just wanted to wish you good luck, along with Bucky here, in finding a certain prince, tonight.”
that you keep running back to; he’s not going to protect you and you sure as hell know that he’s not on your side! Just because he treats you better than Howard doesn’t mean he’s a better person; he’s just as much of a con-man and asshole as Howard! Steve is really the best option that you can go for right now and hell, if you do decline, I bet you won’t stumble upon a job opportunity that’s twice as good as this in 10 years after today! He’s a trustworthy person, Tones; I know him personally and he has an incredible personality! And if he even dares to think of treating you like Howard does, I swear on my entire art studio that I’ll cover him in all of my clay, roll him into a ball, drop him off at the top of Mount Everest, and watch him roll all the way down to the bottom! I’ve got your back, Tones, and I’m trusting you here to make the right choice to actually improve your life from this stinky, sad situation that you’re currently stuck in.

“You know what, Steve? I know that you’re not always going to have time to eat meals with us anymore but that doesn’t mean that you should always miss out on your meals! Have you tried hiring someone to do the cooking for you? A professional who can just make you the food and deliver it to your house or your office every day?”
“I honestly wouldn’t mind that,” the blond admitted with a cheeky grin.
“I’m not sure what it is exactly, but…” Steve hesitated. “It’s just this…this absolute bliss that emerges from my heart and my guts whenever I’m around him, it feels so comforting. It’s like he’s subtlety rocking my heart back and forth without even realizing it, but it just feels so right.”
A sleepy murmur whisked through Tony’s parted lips, “You could never ruin anything, Steve. If anything, you make everything and everyone around you thousands of times better than they were before. I promise you. You’re one of the best fucking people I’ve ever m...”

The prince of Americandia exhaled softly.

. A little extra money for his effortless talents frankly seemed like too good of a deal not to take.
“You’re good,” the genius replied as he rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment. His fingers tingled in the spot where he had felt the blond’s skin against his.
The blond took in a rough gasp of air.
He was weak-at-the-knees at everything the other prince had to ever offer to the world because Steve knew that anything Tony ever presented to the universe had to be his very best — after all, Starks never settled for anything less than absolute perfection.
“Uh,” the blond tugged at his dress shirt’s collar. “No, not yet, Pepper. And you know it’s not necessary to address me by that name, right? We’re friends after all, aren’t we?”
