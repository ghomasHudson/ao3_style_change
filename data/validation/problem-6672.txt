"But," the teenager hesitated, looking from the chopper to the blue Mazda RX-8, "I have to finish here first!"
Steve didn't answer the obvious provocation, just smiled. On his way back home, he would have to stop at pharmacies and do some research on nicotine gums.
"You must be really somewhere else right now. Not that I am complaining," Red Velvet finished putting the earrings on and reached for the transparent lip gloss, applying a shiny coat on top of the red lipstick and smacked her lips together with a wet sound, "but it is the first time when seeing me change didn't give you an instant boner."
Before Tony could make a move, Steve took his wrist, stopping him. He eyed Tony up and down, despite the growing confusion of the other man. Was this the same Tony who days ago had complained about being covered in mud?
“It is okay,” she confirmed, leaning her head closer and letting out a soft gasp in surprise when she was suddenly lifted up, Steve’s hands landing below her butt and squeezing as with a twirl of fabric and black hair, she landed on the sofa, a solid weight following right behind her. “Oh wow,” she gasped out, a bit dizzy and delighted with the fact that Steve took over the initiative, and she felt hands roaming over her body and lips pressed against her neck. “It was a while since someone swooped me off my feet,” she giggled and Steve’s heart did a little flip. Red Velvet was a dream come true for him. Tony was a dream come true for him.
Words were not needed, but actions. When they kissed, it tasted tangy and delicious. And Tony was right, the fruit salad didn’t need any honey, it was already sweet as it was.
“I am just saying,” Steve said, grinning a bit too broad, knowing that they were heading into a dangerous topic, and leaned closer, minimizing the distance between him and his friend, “the world changed, Sam. Masculinity and femininity are not that far apart anymore. And who would be better to talk about this than a drag queen?”
"Looks who's talking!" Bucky laughed, remembering the small fry he had left. "Growth spurt did wonders to you, pal."
Steve turned his tired eyes to Tony, really hoping that the question was ’do you want to wait outside for me?’ By the way Tony was smiling, Steve could already say that it wasn’t.
Steve just smiled, not seeing a connection why photos of a pair of kids in dungarees and with bruised faces could be so harmful.
"Oh God," Tony slumped in the armchair, holding Peter close and letting him eat. "Yay," he cheered quietly, sounding exhausted. "Good boy," Tony praised, looking at Peter with adoration, tears drying on his cheeks.
“Tadaam!” Red Velvet smiled, looking at Steve in the mirror. “This is how I start my drag. I like to do it at the beginning, it keeps hair in place while doing makeup,” she said, running a hand over the cap as if checking if it sat right.
“See, this is my favorite moment,” the not so stranger grinned, putting the sunglasses into the breast pocket of the jacket. “The realization. I will take my coffee at my booth,” he turned to the blond waitress behind the bar, “anything for you?” he turned back to Steve, “they have really good pastrami sandwiches.”
“I am taking you out for a very late dinner,” he said with a charming smile, pulling Red Velvet to a sitting position. “I can’t allow my lady to be hungry.”
Steve sighed dramatically, even if he expected such a turn of events, and changed direction, carrying Tony into the kitchen. Call it a weakness, but Steve couldn't deny his favorite belly and favorite person anything.
"Uh, your engagement party went on and on, and by the time it finished, I was too tired to get to my own place, so Sam allowed me to crash on the couch in his bakery," Bucky explained in a bread obscured hum.
“Shut up, I wanted to make a good first impression,” Tony ducked his head down, feeling embarrassed again.
"Only if you leave," Tony said, sounding humored by his young lover's playful behavior. "It is not fun to gossip about you while you are here."
Steve grunted, closing the door to the closet, just in time finishing the vacuuming. "Really, Tony?" he called back, his feet tired enough as it was.
Tony scoffed, raising his arms dramatically. "Bad reviews! Do you know who writes those bad reviews? Bored kids like Peter."
The further they went, the surroundings changed. It wasn’t an empty corridor, but a place full of light and racks with clothes and mirrors and music seeping from rooms. Steve read the signs, such as ’accessories’, ’shoes’, but also names of the other queens working in the club.
"No, I did, I did," Steve denied quickly, knowing what Tony wanted to ask and already feeling bad for ruining the post-sex bliss. "It was great, babe," he soothed, running the back of his palm over Tony's cheek tenderly. It wasn't a lie, and it truly was great. It just wasn't exactly what Steve needed at that moment, but being so close and intimate with Tony was always great.
"You are working today?" Steve asked. From what he knew, it was Tony's free day. "Did something happen at the Olive?"
"That's my boy," Sarah praised and Steve leaned his head for a hello kiss on his cheek. "Go wash your hands before dinner."
"Hah... Hah..." Tony let out a long breath, feeling overwhelmed and blissful, and allowing Steve's hands to guide him until he was snuggly pressed to his husband's front. "Mhm," Tony hid his face into Steve's neck, needing a moment to compose himself and enjoying being wrapped in muscled arms he knew so well.
"We will work on it," Steve said with a smile, still addressing Tony's stomach directly, watching his fingers pressing on the material, prodding the skin underneath, and watching it jump back. "I have some niiice chocolate brownies for you. And chocolate syrup. For later," Steve said in a low murmur, finding Tony's outie under the material and gliding his finger pad over the small nub, softly rubbing it.
"Hey, Red, do you have some aloe? I think Nat burned some of my skin," a male walked in, right past Steve on the couch, rubbing his armpit with a scowl.
"Nah. He should be relieved. Now he can go out with his friends and throw eggs at passersby or something. I am kidding!" Tony added, seeing Steve opening his mouth to deny that no son of his would behave like that. "Also, what party? He invited two friends over."
“I love you too,” Tony answered, his heart hammering from the ticklish rush and all love he had for Steve.
It was somehow hilarious, that both Steve and Tony had to try very hard to convince Sarah that the woman in the photo and the man sitting on the couch next to her are the same person. At least three times, Tony had to explain the whole getting into drag process (sparing the gruesome details, like covering up eyebrows and tucking in) and Sarah listened with sparkling eyes, at awe of Tony's skills. After hearing that he performed as a singer and wrote his own songs, Sarah became full of hope to hear Tony sing, who suddenly became bashful, claiming that he sings only in drag, which made Steve laugh because he heard Tony sing multiple times under the shower. After a lot of requests and encouraging applaud, Tony sang some lyrics in front of his boyfriend and his mother, much to Sarah's delight and Steve's happiness.
“I didn’t want to lose you,” Tony admitted, sobs breaking his voice, “you were so secretive around your mom and then when I met with her, she was so kind and - and I guess I didn’t want to lose her either.”
Steve felt like falling off the couch in shock, and by Tony's face, he knew his boyfriend thought the same. The long look Sarah gave Steve became clear now - not even knowing the meaning behind the word, Sarah had to make sure that whatever the words meant, Steve was okay with it, and when she saw that Steve was, she had accepted Tony too. Steve always knew that his mom was a special woman and she was just proving it to him every day. Smiling, Steve took out his phone and selected the photo album titled 'The Pitted Olive' planning to introduce his mom to Miss Red Velvet.
"Huh?" Steve looked up from his bowl of sugar frosted cereal. They had such a lazy, long morning changing into afternoon, that none of them felt like preparing a proper breakfast, settling on Tony's secret stash and choosing something to go with the already lazy day. They even stayed in bed, getting crumbs all over the bedding. "You are kicking me out?"
Tony moved away from Steve, showing a confused face. That kinda felt like mocking him, but Steve’s face was honest. And it would certainly change the mood and make Tony feel better about this whole day. “I don’t know,” Tony said, just to be safe, “do you want to do it?”
Steve raised an eyebrow. He mouthed ‘beer, really?’ with an evilly happy smile and Sam clenched his teeth and gave a signal with his eyes to not push it. Despite being a regular like Steve was, Sam still had problems to order drinks with a straw and a small umbrella.
sorry for the delay! was having some health problems, but I am slowly getting back to myself. not to brag, but from all the chapters I posted so far, this is my favorite! hope you will like it! comments are welcomed and needed.
Steve always woke up early. It was how his body was functioning and he came to terms with it a long time ago. And Steve really loved mornings. He loved how quiet it was and how he could plan his day in peace before the usual chaos started. Today, he didn’t have any plans. He stayed in bed, laying on his side, with his head propped on one hand and watched Tony sleeping, taking in every second. The sun just started to rise and fill the white apartment with sunlight and Tony looked absolutely gorgeous. He was on his back, arms placed over his head in a carefree manner and some cute curls were falling on his forehead. His skin had some divine glow to it, and his lips seemed moist and plump and invitingly wet and shiny…
"It's embarrassing, okay?" Tootsie hissed. Steve didn't know if she meant Red's overly motherly behavior or the fact that his friends and coworkers knew that kid Tootsie used to have a bowl cut, just like half of the kids back in those times.
Steve laughed nervously, feeling his cheeks heat up, unsure if it was a genuine compliment. "Thanks. I will see you later!" he waved goodbye to Thor and took his usual route to enter the club from the back.
“Bath bombs. You drop this into a bathtub and it fizzes and the water turns colorful and scented and amazing. You need to try one!”
The silver curtain was pushed open and Red Velvet walked on the stage in a round of applause and almost a collective gasp echoed through the audience. There was no doubt, that the woman on stage was Red Velvet, even if at first glance she didn't look like it. The dress she chose was simple in cut, long and draping over the floor, with subtly widening sleeves covering wrists and a jewel neckline, hiding collarbones, almost not showing any skin. It was tight, accentuating the perky butt and round hips and a lovely hourglass figure. The most surprising was the choice of the material - it wasn't red, but all gold and shimmering, a little bit crinkling and catching light from every angle. Red Velvet looked as if someone poured gold over her body and let the precious metal set, shaping a dress over her. Such rich dress didn't require any fancy hairstyle and her black hair was combed neatly to the back and forming a low bun. Red smiled, light falling on her radiant face and glossy, red lips.
"I don't know why you are so upset about this, Steve," Tony said lightly, digging in the box he brought with himself, having prototypes of everything he brought. "And look, Figaro doesn't mind!"
Steve leaned in and placed a lingering kiss on Tony’s forehead. The story he just heard was filled with sadness and grief and although Steve couldn’t relate, he would do his best to understand. Words couldn’t describe how happy he was with being allowed into Tony’s past and it was a warm, wonderful feeling.
"What-" Tony immediately got up from bed, running to the window, hoping to see his boyfriend. It turned dark already and he didn't see much. "I am coming for you, stay where you are."
"I didn't ask for your help!" Tony yelled more, almost falling back into the mud. He felt so overwhelmed. He didn't want anyone to get into trouble because of him. He was fine with suffering alone.
Peter just stood there, not understanding. He could hear his dad, talking to MJ and Ned, and he felt that if Steve would lecture him in front of his friends, MJ would never allow him to forget about this.
“Fried rice then,” Tony decided, still feeling a bit weak in the knees after the kiss. But it felt good. As if they made it official. It felt even more than good.
Steve was completely speechless. This wasn't like any version of Tony he knew. Red Velvet was poised, with perfect posture and perfect makeup. His Tony was always in ironed out clothes, with socks matching his shoes and the newest model of sunglasses on the top of perfectly stylized hair. This Tony… He wore a typical blue mechanic coverall, with sleeves rolled up to his elbows. There were some smudges of car grease on his hands and face. He seemed heated up, and there was some sweat on his forehead, strands of curly hair falling on his nape and forehead, the coverall hugging his body-
"Hm," Red Velvet looked at Steve, and she smacked her lips together delicately. "It… Is actually really good," she said, smiling in surprise. "Really good," she said, offering the rest of the cupcake to Steve, and Steve did the playful thing and took a bite of the cupcake while she still was holding it. Moist cake, a bit salty frosting. Sam did it again. "Good, right?" Red asked, and Steve gave an approving hum. "I thought your friend is miserable in his job, but his cakes don't taste like that."
"Hmph," Steve huffed, when Tony moved away, straightening up with a self-satisfied grin and the tip of the pink tongue peeking out to lick at the corner of the upper lip. Back straight, relaxed belly and a smile that made Steve feel weak. A very tempting sight. "I am gonna buy you a gag ball," Steve joked, smiling back at his husbands, and holding to Tony's wonderful hips as Tony started to gently roll his pelvis.
"If you want me to continue, you will stay quiet. Got it?" Steve said, grinning too smug for Tony's liking, his finger rubbing against the throbbing opening.
There were pictures, that without context seemed innocent, like an array of feathers on a pillow. Some were less subtle and showed a part of sucked in stomach, escaping from a coming closer feather duster. The gifs were the most intriguing - a tied up, blindfolded man, laughing and squirming, while a different man was…
“I am serious, babe,” Steve tried again, gently poking his finger all over Tony’s bare belly, making him squeak funnily and curl up, “write on your Tumblr. Everyone has to be worried.”
"It is from your friend, right?" Red Velvet asked and she took out one cupcake, turning it in her hand and looking at it from every angle. It smelled like cocoa and the white frosting was swirled out perfectly. "It is cute, but I am not actually a fan of red velvet cake," she smiled gently.
“Oh, I know,” Tony smiled, “Loki is just doing his job. He usually stays in the back, and steps in when things get ugly.”
"What?!" Tony shrilled out, not believing that Steve would go so low to first turn him on and then deny him. That was really, really low. Unworthy of Captain America.
Tony smiled, a cheeky little smile, “a woman never gives her age,” he answered smoothly, “but I am something some would call a seasoned queen.”
The previous amusement immediately disappeared from Clint's face. He stared at Steve, eyes wide open in shock and at loss of words.
"Beer?" still chuckling Bucky offered to Steve, holding the six pack and encouraging Steve to take a one. "You seem like you need a one, pal."
"Just like mom taught you. Is that a way to speak to your mother?!" Bianca yelled and the crowd laughed, enjoying this mother-daughter encounter.
Steve bit his lower lip. Why Tony didn't tell him about being in touch with his mom? Was it because of the last time and the freakout he had when his mom saw him and Tony together, and Steve started to panic that she might suspect something? Seemed so… And Steve felt really bad, that he was ready to kiss Tony in front of strangers and basketball teams, but felt too guilty to hold his boyfriend's hand in front of his own mother. And Sarah seemed to get along well with Tony… And…
“I was thinking we could eat outside, but you ruined it,” Steve continued to complain, beating egg whites for omelets. He already cut up some fresh fruits for a fruit salad, made freshly squeezed orange juice and had chopped mushroom and sweet bell peppers on hand, ready to toss in the eggs mixture when needed. It was quite amazing how well stocked in fresh vegetables and fruits Tony’s kitchen was.
"WHAT THE HELL!" Tony yelped, unsure what to hold to, and clutched to the armrest, curling feet to himself.
Tony nodded, barely standing from being so tired and not arguing with this one. He sent a last, love-filled look directed at their son and cat, and silently walked out of the bedroom. Steve took a blanket from the back of the armchair and sat down, covering himself, staying just in case, which in the morning turned out the be unnecessary as Figaro was wonderfully patient and Peter was happy to wake up next to his furry friend and there was no usual morning fuss happening.
"Um, can someone fill me up?" Red reminded them of her presence, holding in her hands a stick of aloe vera.
"What the-?!" Tony jolted his head up, bleary eyes coming to focus. He looked around, slowly realizing that he was down in his workshop, a holographic screen in front of him and a ton of papers scattered all around. No immediate threat, just this throbbing pain in his forehead, when he had lost the fight against staying awake and slammed his head into the desk.
Steve took his phone from the coffee table and looked at the hour. It was well after midnight so he kept tossing on the couch for almost two hours. He stood up and patted the couch tenderly, apologizing quietly for the previous offense, and walked in the darkness in the direction of his and Tony's bedroom. Slowly, Steve opened the door, some soft light illuminating the room and in the middle of the bed, still awake, was Tony. After noticing Steve in the doorway, he sat up, the covers falling a little bit, showing his naked torso.
Steve blinked again, already repeating Tony’s name in his mind over one thousand times, wanting to remember it forever. Wanting to remember the person forever.
"Oh," Steve replied, staring owlishly at the other man. Was it about the kiss cam? "I am sorry, um, did - did it bother you?"
For goodbye, Steve hugged his mom, and Tony got a hug too, and they went out, strolling down the street in the crisp air, Steve holding a bag with food his mom had given him. They didn't walk far away, when Tony stood on his tiptoes and out of blue smooched Steve on the cheek.
Steve had serious doubts if he could survive back waxing. Or back sugaring, as Tony used his homemade sugar paste on him, claiming that it was more delicate than traditional wax and there was minimal risk of ripping off the outer skin layer. That didn't alarm Steve at all.
There was an excited whooping from the crowd and Tony looked at the screen with the score, seeing a heart in the frame, scanning the crowd for couples.
Sam cleared his throat before answering, knocking his fist on the table. “Beer, please,” he said, sounding an octave lower than usual.
“Of course,” Steve said quickly. “I will use your stage name,” he assured and Tony nodded, taking a sip of his coffee.
"Hey, Steve!" Bucky grinned at his friend, tilting his head up and creasing his eyebrows. "Huh, I thought you were smaller."
"Was it the same bar where you met Tony?" Sarah asked in an enticing voice, not knowing the full love story behind Steve and Tony's relationship.
"So, can I come back to bed?" Steve asked, making his voice lighter to try and brighten the atmosphere.
"Yes?" Sarah turned in the direction of the voice, getting startled when met eye to eye with the muscled, grim looking bouncer. She had to raise some suspicion by lurking around the entrance to the bar, but then she realized that the bouncer knew her name. When the bouncer smiled, his face changed from intimidating to kinder one, showing that he had a gentle heart.
“No, please,” Steve rushed in, and Tony paused. “Please let me pay. You found time for me, this is the least I can do.”
"Hope you two will enjoy it," Sam said hurriedly, jumping to the huge deck oven and checking on the apple pies. The hot scent of baking apples and cinnamon drifted to Steve and it was heavenly. "If you want something to go, just tell Kamala, she will pack it for you!"
Steve smiled in apology. “It wasn’t easy, but I never expected it to be so. And ma - she was shocked, for sure, but she said that it doesn’t change who I am and she just wants me happy and - Tony?”
“Wha— how did you know?!” Steve asked, minimally leaning his head away and that made her stop again.
Steve's finger slipped in with ease, Tony already stretched and slicked from his cock. He pushed in deeper, angling his finger and pressing on the tight walls.
"I guess you were right, Steve," the brunet said, shaking his fist after the punch that would leave a nice black eye on Hammer's face.
“True,” Tony agreed, “But it doesn’t hurt to find out again,” he said and lowered his hands, fingers running over Steve’s stomach, hips, ribs, and over any other spot he could reach, searching for the best, giggliest reaction.
"Shh, Tony, I am having a moment here," Steve shushed his boyfriend, focusing on the mentioned boyfriend's belly instead. Tony snorted, knowing that Steve had a thing for his stomach and allowing the situation to develop, curious where it would lead them.
The soft sound of breathing was much better. Carefully, Steve slipped out, helping Tony lower himself completely into the covers and peppering soothing kisses along the line of shoulders.
"I am not sure of it," Steve grumbled, remembering the way the bodyguard had eyed him during his first visit backstage and continued to look at him every time he showed up. "I think he might have a thing for you, you know."
Steve typed, standing behind the silver curtain. Thanks to the headlight pointed at the performer, he could see Red Velvet, chatting to the guests as always before starting, her silhouette contoured by the light and he could remain unnoticed to everyone else. He saw a chair in the middle of the small area and guessed correctly that it was left for him.
"Ha! Straight!" Arrow hollered, swirling prosecco in her tall glass. "Your boyfriend is so cute, Red."
A short message in reply just seconds after. Tony stared at the screen, knowing that Steve was busy, but this sounded cold and before he could decide to not bother his husband anymore, another message showed.
"Now I know this!" Tony announced happily and Steve smiled back, hearing genuineness in the voice tone. Tony was recovering remarkably.
“This whole time, I thought that you were some out of this world, divine creature who is way out of my league, but you have flaws! This is great news!” Steve continued to laugh, putting the cornflakes aside and smiling at Tony. Every time he saw Red Velvet on stage, he was completely mesmerized - her make up was flawless, she never stumbled and her voice was always clear while singing, not a single false note. She was perfect. And here he was learning that the guy under Red Velvet’s makeup was a regular human being who liked to binge on junk food and felt insecure from time to time. In Steve’s eyes, both Tony and Red Velvet were perfect the way they were. Tony, with his stunning appearance and wit and intelligence, had some imperfections deeply rooted in him, but they made him tangible and close. Red Velvet was a dream, but Tony was the real thing.
"Keep your mouth opened," Tiberius said, and Tony dropped his head, feeling desperate and hopeless. No, he didn't want this. Stop. A hand wrapped in his hair and yanked his head up roughly, and Tony whimpered in pain, tears rolling down his cheeks. Tiberius smiled cruelly, enjoying the sight of the other teen on his knees. "Anything you want to tell me?" he asked, giving Tony the last chance for an apology, and maybe, maybe he would go easy on him.
"Leave now," the blond advised, his stance showing that he won't hesitate to deliver another hit if Stone would try to stand up.
"Now, you admit that I am the true Captain America!" Steve made a show and wrapped arms around his boy's smaller frame and squeezed him, leaning forward and crushing. Just enough to let him feel it, but not strong enough to do any damage. Just one of the typical bear hugs, Steve liked to treat his son with from time to time.
"Sup," the guy turned to Steve briefly and Steve raised his hand in hello. Wow. It was fascinating how such a bulky guy could transform his body into a perfect hourglass figure. That had to require a lot of padding. He also had strong facial features and a stubble, but makeup had turned his face into a rounder, softer one. Dark, shoulder-length hair which was usually hidden under frilly, big wigs. "Mom, aloe, okay?! I am dying!" she urged Red Velvet in a playful whine.
“Oh fuhahahck - ” Tony wriggled uselessly, his stomach sinking in when Steve gently ran fingertips over the soft skin. “Steve, Steve, pleaheehehehese!”
"Sorry for the delay. Let's go to my office," Tony turned to Steve, taking his hand and guiding him away. Steve looked over his shoulder, taking a last glance at Rhodey, who kept explaining something to Harley in a patient voice, slowly making the nervousness go away. Seemed that Rhodey was only harsh to him for some reason.
"So…" Tony started, sounding somehow timid. Steve looked at him because Tony rarely was timid. "You like doing that a lot, huh?"
"I AM NOT LEAVING MY BEST GIRL BEHIND!" Steve hollered and yanked Tony up, holding his hand and running to a safe place. Tony cursed loudly, not having a different option than to follow. He hated being a guy guy.
"Sure, he is," Steve agreed, just for the sake of agreeing. He would have a close eye on Loki too. Just in case. Yet, if it would ever get to a confrontation, he would prefer to face Thor, the bodyguard who usually stood in the front of the Olive. Loki seemed like a type that carried a hidden blade in his pocket and wouldn't hesitate to use it. At least, he could dodge and block punches, knifes not so much. "Do you want to get a drink? I think Bucky's show is about to start," Steve asked. He had no more plans for today, and ending the day at the club seemed fitting.
"What are you talking about?" Steve asked, putting the bag with food away and sliding feet into his sneakers.
Steve creased his eyebrows in thought before his forehead smoothened again. "You mean paintball? It is fun if you have the right people around-"
"Tootsie?" Steve's mouth fell open. Tootsie was the drag queen he usually saw behind the bar, pouring drinks or sometimes on the stage, singing grungy music. With her smudged makeup and love for plaid and animal prints, she didn't resemble Red Velvet's poised style in any way.
"Make up for it?" Steve asked in humor. "More like cramming last five years into it," he answered himself. It wasn't like he and Tony lacked romance in their relationship, it just simmered down into something more steady and comfortable in the last years. Being together for almost a decade developed their relationship from the wild and not having enough of each other into a sturdy and comfortable feeling of knowing that the other person would be always there. The love was still present and growing, not needing outbursts of feelings, but small everyday gestures of devotion. That's what their last Valentine's days embodied which took a form of a shared dinner over a movie and cuddling on the couch while in sweatpants. And it was as good as during the early years of their relationship when they had decided to meet in a hotel under fake names, romance each other all over again, and spent a wild night together.
"You are not worthless, Tony," Steve quickly said, and hearing that Tony thought about himself like that, was already painful.
" stood in front of her. Steve was wearing a shawl collar jacket, white shirt underneath and black slacks, and a black bowtie to match the whole look. It would be a very calm, classic set if it wasn't for the material the jacket was made of. Blue velvet. Shining and shimmering with a light blue undertone.
Second - he didn’t have time to keep his theoretical accounts active and post new content regularly. Or more, he didn’t want to make time, preferring to spend it on reading or training or hanging out with Tony or anything else, really. He had been gently suggested, that some celebrities (Steve’s eyes widened a little after hearing that - was he a celebrity?) hire someone else to run their social media accounts. Steve shook his head at the proposition, knowing that none of his teammates did that and so he shouldn’t either, not mentioning that everything posted wouldn’t be sincere.
Peter wheezed, still trying to wriggle out from his pop's clutches. "Dahahahad! No!" he had enough of humiliation for one day and much to his horror he noticed that MJ and Ned nodded enthusiastically to Tony's offer. "Pops, stahap! Stahapstahpstahahp!" Peter jumped when somehow Steve managed to claw under his arms.
“Maybe not problems, but a lot of confusion,” Red Velvet answered, walking out, in a short silk robe in vivid gold color. Steve felt stunned again, noticing the bare feet and silky smooth, shaved legs. In fact, Tony as a whole was very smooth. His arms and the part of the torso peeking out from the material didn’t have any body hair either.
It was a matter of time until people would learn that they had a cat, and one time, during a walk, someone snapped a photo, of Tony and Figaro and the press went wild. And Tony, being the businessman he was, already saw an opportunity in the whole commotion.
Since that day, the school was buzzing with gossips and everyone was making their way to Steve, trying to urge him to talk. Steve remained silent, replying to many questions in the simplest way, never going into details. Days were passing and Steve was worried, not hearing anything from Tony and not daring to make his way into the Stark mansion. Maybe Tony wanted to forget about it all, and Steve was a part of that sorry chapter in his life. Maybe forgetting about him too was a part of the healing process. Steve could understand and hoped for Tony to find peace, but he still felt a sting in his heart.
"Hey," Sam smiled a toothy smile when Steve walked into Momma's Little Bakery. It was as pink and frilly as always, but Sam seemed much more relaxed, busing at the counter and stacking freshly made buns and cookies for the early customers, already in his white and pristine work clothes. "How are you feeling?"
"No," Tony smiled broadly and Steve gaped at him. "I decided to stay. I want to show everyone that you can recover from being bullied and that is worth it to stand up for yourself. If I can do it, everyone else can too. I am gonna be like a phoenix, reborn from the ashes!"
The guy eyed Steve critically. "He is tall!" he called back and Steve didn't even have time to feel offended when Tony's laughter rung in the workshop and his boyfriend emerged from underneath one of the vehicles.
"And let me guess, you must be Steve's mom! I can tell because you both have that lovely face structure," Lady Mint said friendly and Sarah just couldn't take eyes off of the colorful and beautiful person next to her.
“Facial mask. This one is blueberry and chamomile oil. It calms the skin and makes it more radiant. I am gonna need some of it, but we will take it as the last thing, it needs to stay cold.”
“Ma?!” he gasped, suddenly finding himself in a new situation, one that had written DANGER all over.
It was an eventful day for the director. Parents were walking in and out, together with their children. Tony's mom was crying, seeing her son's bruises, and not understanding how she didn't notice anything earlier. Tony's dad was fuming, breaking the deal off with Viastone, no matter how much negotiating and diplomacy Stone's father tried to use, the contract was out of the question. And Tony was in the middle of all that, forced to say his story, again and again, missing classes and after talking with the school's psychiatrist getting a week off for self-care, and it was the minimum Tony's dad demanded before suing the school for neglect. In the end, Stone and Hammer were expelled, Killian was suspended, and Steve was told to not fight and let go, without the incident going into his permanent record.
“What?” Tony asked, not feeling as much embarrassed as angry. Steve had too much fun in his discomfort.
"And Mint is not only the funny one, but she also has Ph.D. in nuclear physics and biochemistry," Red said and Steve whistled quietly, because, well that was impressive.
"And now your face matches my dress," Velvet joked, standing up and smoothing the red satin draping over her body.
"Thanks, ma," Steve smiled, taking his fork and watching his mom reaching her hand for his empty soup plate. "Please, ma. Leave it, I will clean later. Sit with me for a while."
"Okay, now," Sarah started, discreetly wiping her own tears when Tony drew away from her, "one of you boys explain to me what exactly a drag queen is."
Steve heard some hidden sadness behind those words. “Did you ever have problems because of your orientation?”
"Me?" Steve asked. Sometimes he felt that he should be the one thanking Tony. After all, if it wasn't for Tony's confession, Steve would be kicked out of school and he knew how much it had to cost him. Even his record remained spotless, and Steve knew that it was solely thanks to Tony and his dad, who was set on protecting the teen who saved his son from further abuse.
"Yeah, I had a feeling you might want one," Sam nodded, turning to the shelves and taking off a perfectly baked brioche, light and fluffy, gold and shiny, and put it in a paper bag. "I have fresh baguettes too, will pack you a one. Anything else?"
Steve bit his lip, his thoughts spiraling deeper and deeper. His dream woman would remain a dream. But… underneath all that makeup was a regular person. Oh, the irony. He had to listen to his own advice after all.
"Ooooh, did you ask him, did you ask him?" Bucky came skipping to them, grinning from ear to ear. "I bet he answered with something stupid!"
“I understand you not telling your mom who I am. It is okay. Your mom is a sweet lady, but I think that hearing that her son is hanging out with a drag queen is beyond her limits.”
Steve stretched, he opened his eyes and looked around, before his eyes locked with Tony's. His husband was sitting in the middle of the bed on his knees and holding a tray and singing gently.
"Um. Yeah, so?" Tony asked, sounding amused. He was always loud. Being quiet and being Tony Stark never went in pair.
"Wanda is here with her twin brother, Pietro," Tony continued, pointing to the currently empty seat.
Some kicking, some wrestling, and some mutual screaming later, Steve managed to press Tony down into the covers and trap him in, taking the torture tool out of his hands.
Steve tried to focus on the feelings. The way his front pressed to Tony's back, covering the trembling body. How he braced one hand on the covers, crumpling them in his fist, the other hand pressed to Tony's hot lower belly, his hand rising and falling with every rapid breath. The tight feeling around him, as he moved in and out with a wet sound.
Sarah took the bouquet with a gentle smile and smelled the colorful flowers. In the meantime, Steve managed to pull his shoes off, and looked at Tony with a frown on his face. His usually so confident boyfriend, looked as if expecting to be kicked out any second and Steve knew that they would have to work on that, bit by bit.
Steve huffed a laugh, feeling that it was pointless to argue with the AI. And Friday had an eye on every corner of the Tower, so she certainly knew what she was doing. Even more, it seemed like she was covering for Tony... And if Tony was doing something truly dangerous, Steve trusted Friday to let him know. So, considering it all, it couldn't be that serious.
“Actually, it is better to store your wigs like that. I just put some balled up tissue paper inside to keep the shape and put a hair net around the wig. It keeps it from tangling and keeps the dust away.”
"Red is just very proud of you," Steve kept smiling, easily picturing Tony going from one person to the other one, showing the photos to everyone who didn't manage to escape on time.
“You left,” Barton said matter-of-factly, “and then Steve stepped in when Bruce got too anxious. Tony doesn’t really trust Nat and me that much, and Thor was gone too frequently, so that left Steve to do most of the work. One thing led to the next, and here we are.” He made a vague gesture.
Yet here they were, and Rhodey was hearing from Pepper that Tony got along well with his teammates. Although as Pepper was now on the west coast and away from Tony’s particular brand of chaos…and hadn’t
“You two are in a relationship and that’s why you’re the only ones who can talk with the…Melnussians?” Fury squinted up at them disbelievingly.
The usual modus of operandi with Tony and his workshop was that unless you needed something, you didn’t spend time in it. Doing so usually ended up being roped into shenanigans or having tools dropped on toes by a clumsy Dummy. Or, on one memorable occasion, being wiped down with an oily rag because Dummy’s camera had been smudged and he’d confused Rhodey with the suit fabricators that he’d been supposed to be cleaning.
Steve pressed his fingers to Tony’s shoulder, pulling him closer. “Yeah,” he said quietly, something else burning on his tongue that he knew Tony didn’t want to hear. “I do.”
Tony shrugged. “He didn’t know. As I said, Thor wasn’t exactly forthcoming with any information before he went off to play diplomat. Which – for the record – is probably a really bad idea. Who remembers the giant squid?”
Steve waited a moment, probably for a response Tony didn’t know how to give, before shifting his weight and crossing his arms over his chest, shoulders hunching in. “How are
Pushing back his mortification, Steve slid his chair closer until their knees knocked together and he could lean forward. “I’ll tell you over and over, as many times as you need to hear it. Because I love you and can’t believe you said yes to this.”
(One had Rhodey in the background with a rather disapproving expression and a story proclaiming him to be a disapproving friend who thought the relationship was going to go down in flames because Tony was luring Rogers to the dark side. Rhodey couldn’t remember giving a statement to that paper and sicced JARVIS on the publication with no regrets.)
. He loves you. He said it himself.” Granted, Tony had been talking in his sleep, but there weren’t many ways to misconstrue “I love you, Steve” even when the speaker was asleep.
“We’re not in a relationship,” Tony said when Steve remained silent. “I don’t think it would be good if we go to the…er…Malnussians under false premises.”
Tony could have asked what Steve meant by “this.” The first time they kissed? The first time they stood next to each other at a party filled with Avengers?
that they are meant to be a part of my life. A part of my team. It’s how I chose the Howling Commandos, back when we were all deployed in the same unit. They followed Bucky and I back to New York, so it turned out to be the right choice. And it’s how I built the Avengers.”
“And now you’re caught up in everything again,” Tony pointed out with a grimace. “You left New York to get away from SI, and now you’re stuck with the man who hurt you in the first place.”
Tony gave him a sheepish smile, and scratched at the back of his neck. “Hi. So that’s Pepper. She’s a menace hell bent on embarrassing me in front of as many people as possible. I tried to push her out the door before you got here, but she insisted on seeing you in person.”
Steve heaved Tony up into his arms, shouting out orders to his teammates to get the hell out of the building and secure the perimeter. Only Bucky stayed behind to cover Steve’s back while he carried Tony.
He took the basket when it was obvious Tony was struggling with the weight, but didn’t offer to pay for the groceries when they reached the register. The flush of embarrassment painted across his cheeks was enough to tell Steve that his generosity wouldn’t be appreciated here. Instead, he just carried Tony’s bags to the backseat of his truck, politely ignoring the younger man’s childlike inspection of the vehicle.
Steve had. A month ago, Joseph had let himself into Steve’s room, pacing slowly along the line of expansive, bullet-proof windows as the fading sunlight crept away. He wanted his son to begin thinking about the legacy he one day hoped to leave for the Howling Commandos. Each generation grew their family in different ways. How would Steve measure up?
The Howling Commandos began small, just as any successful, self-respecting organization should. Rogerus and his two best men dealt out an array of popular drugs at the time, marijuana and heroin, until they brought on a brilliant German scientist, the world’s very own Dr. Abraham Erskine, who could create something finer and purer than anything available on the market. The Howling Commandos went from low-level dealers to the most desired suppliers in the state of New York in a matter of weeks, turning their payout from hundreds into thousands, which eventually grew to millions and billions under the watchful eye of the Rogerus, now formally known as
to break the tense silence, Steve spoke up. “Why does it look like you haven’t been taking very good care of yourself?"
As promised, the morphine had run out by the time he had woken up again. Agonizing wasn’t a powerful enough word to describe the pain Tony was in. Every breath and every movement was labored. All he wanted to do was curl up on the hospital bed they had strapped him to and sleep, but they weren’t giving him that option. With the threat of the bomb looming over his head, they thrust Tony into a makeshift workshop with a list of SI weapons they demanded to be made.
Tony rubbed his hands together greedily as he stood up in his chair. “I’ll be right back. Give me five minutes.” As promised, five minutes later Tony returned with a large cart of weapons, which he rolled over to the front of the room.
But now he had this new mission to focus on, along with putting the finishing touches on his project. Tony could sit and worry about the things he can’t control in the future, like when and where his enemies might strike, or he could put all of his time and energy into moving forward in life. Making the world a better place by introducing them to the world of artificial intelligence, and then hopefully in the not so distant future, a miniaturized arc reactor. Or helping the Avengers rescue men, women, and children who have been kidnapped by sex traffickers. Those were the things he could focus on instead of the crippling fear that Hydra and his father instilled in him.
Stane leaned forward so close that the pungent smell of cigars and ash filled his nostrils. “The fuckin’
“Mr. Stark, please remember that you are on bed rest for another week.” The nurse implored, her eyes wide with exasperation. “If you have to come back to have your stitches re-sutured, Dr. Selvig is not going to be happy.”
About ten minutes before his demonstration was set to begin, something happened that was most definitely not part of the plan.
But for now, they had a briefing to sit through, so Steve pulled away, but kept his hand in Tony’s, squeezing his fingers. “Nat, Clint, you’re up.”
Turns out Bruce had a surprisingly dry sense of humor, one that matched well with his own witty sarcasm. They had so much in common, and had run into many of the same people in their life, it was a little worrying that their paths never crossed. SI is contracted with the United States military, and General Ross, the same jackass that was after Bruce, is one of SI’s contacts. Tony himself had charmed the beautiful Betty Ross into dancing with him when he was eight years old at a fundraiser. The scientist was generally pretty closed off, but the fondness and affection in his voice when they spoke about Betty was undeniable. It was fairly obvious that Dr. Banner was still very much in love with his ex-fiancé.
She let him lean his head against her shoulder as she thought about it. “Sure, but only because you’re basically one of us now.”
Bucky’s jaw twitched as he shook his head. “I couldn’t live there anymore without being consumed by anger, and Stevie was losing himself to the Captain. We both needed a break. Boston has been good to us.”
“You look like you’d be able to hold your own.” There was a wicked gleam in Tony’s eye as he hopped into the passenger seat of the truck, back facing the interior so that his legs hung out of the open door, and Steve smirked at how close to the money Tony was.
The corners of his eyes prickled, and he wiped a shaky hand across his face. Tony cleared his suddenly tight throat and shook his head. “Uh, okay. Can you make it a medium coffee with just one shot of espresso?”
Natasha apparently had enough. “Shut up, both of you.” Bucky and Clint quieted down immediately. “Cap has a date, that’s all.”
“That’s who Clint is to me. A year ago, I got myself tangled up with some bad people. Clint tried coming in to break up the party, but they just went after him too. We can handle ourselves, trust me on that. But when you are out-manned and out-gunned...sometimes there isn’t a way out.”
He tilted his head slightly. “I mean if we were to let you go, what kind of plans do you have? Do you want to go to school? Get an education? Find a job?”
And then it all came back to him. Tony telling Steve the truth about his name, their night together, Steve’s strange behavior the next morning, the car…
“Man’s got a point.” Sam smirked, half-turning in the passenger seat so that he was facing Tony. “Give the man what he wants, I want some cool new toys. We’ve got plenty of dough from the Hydra score.”
Surprisingly, it was Thor who huffed out a laugh at his little joke. Tony smirked, happy to know that an Avenger other than Clint had a sense of humor. It even earned him a small smile from Peter. “Nice to meet you, Point-Break. Thanks for uh…” The corners of his lips twitched upwards, “for helping move all of my crap here. I feel a lot safer knowing you’re looking out for me.”
The noise was finally too much for him, and Tony collapsed to the ground. He still held the bomb in his hand and contemplated just setting it off, but he didn’t want to hurt the Captain and his Avengers. They were here to wipe out Hydra, and after what they did in New York, Tony trusted them to get the job done.
“We’ll talk about this later, love.” Steve whispered against his hair before turning to the nurse. “Ma’am, give him whatever he needs.”
Thoughts? Feelings? I hope you enjoyed it! I'm having a blast writing this, and thank you to everyone who has given kudos/bookmarked/commented/subscribed to this story. I appreciate all of the love!
Steve shrugged. “Apparently it’s their way of making sure no one catches onto their relationship. Coulson did his job, well I might add, considering he was able to find us in the first place, and no one suspects him of being in league with a mafia gang. He’s been promoted to Supervisory Special Agent, so I’d say whatever they’re doing is working.”
Tony chewed on the bottom of his lip and accepted a glass of water and pain pills Bruce offered him. “I don’t know about that, he’s known the Avengers for much longer than he’s known me.”
“The Parker kid called, I told him to come by tomorrow to drop by Tony’s school work. Pepper texted twice, something about a Sex and the City marathon that will be streaming on television this weekend, and…”
I hope you enjoyed this. Thank you for reading! I'd love to hear your thoughts/feelings about everything.
They both laughed together when Pepper nearly pushed him off the bed. “Okay, first, your best friend is right here. We competed for the title, and I won since I have to continue dealing with you on a daily basis. Second, Jim will be so excited for you. Do you want to give him a call?”
But there was too much evil here in Boston to leave the city on its own. New York was at least being protected by Peggy and the Howling Commandos, but Boston’s police department, led by one Nick Fury, wasn’t winning any awards for keeping the crime and violence down. Ever since Coulson took the job in the FBI, Fury couldn’t seem to close cases anymore. Steve had read through enough data to know that the Avengers were making a difference here in Boston, and he knew he couldn’t just walk away from the life if there were people still in danger.
“Seriously, go to class. You’ve been working so hard, and you love your work. I want to see it, and I can’t see it if you don’t finish it.” He tried pushing again, pleased when Steve finally moved off the bed. “I’ll be fine. Your friends are going to stay with me, I’ll be here when you get back. I promise.”
Yeah, that wasn’t fucking happening. There wasn’t anything Stane could do to him to make him give up Steve. Not that he ever planned on letting him so much as try. He was
The corners of the man’s lips twitched. “I said you should eat. You look like you’re in danger of being blown over by a stiff wind. And in this weather, that might just be a possibility.”
He looked around at his team, all willingly prepared to do whatever it takes to get Tony back, and nodded, sending them all into motion. Steve swallowed down on the consuming rage and let revenge fantasies flit through his mind while heading back towards the building from which Tony was taken.
Tony and Bruce would stay behind at the warehouse, tracking their team’s movements and providing support where they could. With Tony’s final Thesis Defense coming up, and Steve’s singular focus on keeping him safe, Thor opted to stay behind as well.
The man in question grumbled incoherently and turned his head away from the overenthusiastic commotion.
Steve’s fingers clenched into tight fists, and he cracked his neck. He rose slowly, picking up the file and typing out a group text to his team.
At that, the rest of the Avengers stood to their feet and surrounded him, adding in their praise. Tony stood there awkwardly with a fierce blush across his cheeks, but his new friends didn’t let up on their gratitude. Steve reached an arm around his shoulders and pulled Tony flush against his side to whisper into his ear, his warm breath mingling against Tony’s hair. “I’m thinking you’re finally healed up, don’t you?”
He was broken out of his thoughts by a knock at the cracked door, where Bucky flexed the hand of his metal prosthetic arm open and closed again. The wiring had gone to shit, and Steve knew it caused his best friend more pain than he would even consider letting on. “We’ve got something you’re gonna wanna see.”
Tony nodded slowly, breathing in deeply as if memorizing the smell of Steve around him. Finally, he swallowed past the lump that had formed in his throat. “Uh, yeah. I think I can handle that.”
He shook his head, the frustration starting to rush unpleasantly between his ears. “Nothing happened.”
He followed her out into the wide conference room where fifty reports waited with their cameras flashing and their microphones outstretched. Rhodey waited for him by the podium, sharply dressed in his military uniform, and Tony didn’t miss the faint blush on either his or Pepper’s face as their eyes roamed over each other. Steve was sitting down on stage, Tony’s personal guest, with Bucky at his shoulder and Nat, Clint, Sam, and Thor posted around the room as personal security.
More screaming and more gunshots, and the tension and panic filling the room was practically choking him. Someone cried out in english, “It’s the Avengers!”
And then Steve had rushed in with Tony in tow, which was surprising enough on its own. Steve had been adamant that he didn’t want his boyfriend around the Avengers, at least not yet. Apparently, Tony was some kind of genius who was also from New York, so it wouldn’t take too much for him to put the pieces together. So it didn’t make any sense when they both appeared in the living room looking completely disheveled and disgruntled.
Thirty minutes later, they pulled up to a decent sized condo and Steve shouldered Tony’s overflowing backpack again before taking his hand. Tony wanted to rip it away and demand that Steve explain what the hell they were doing here, but it would be like talking to a brick wall.
To his surprise, The Captain leaned down, cupped his hands around the back of Tony’s head, and pressed their lips together. A rumble of pleasure escaped his throat, and he moved to the side to whisper in Tony’s ear, warm breath tickling against his skin.
Peter was there the next time Tony stirred, along with Bucky and...some greek god of a man. He was leaning against the back wall, chatting easily with an anxious Peter, wearing a giant, goofy smile on his face. Tony figured this was the famous Thor he had yet to meet. The man before him certainly fit the bill. Bucky watched the two with an air of caution, but must have sensed that Peter was relatively harmless. Tony let his eyes wander over Bucky’s metal arm for a few moments, cataloguing the whirr and clicks, before clearing his throat.
“Tony, love, everything’s okay. I’ll fill you in as soon as you get home. Focus on your presentation first.”
Rogers raised his brows expectantly. The breeze coming off of the lake was cool as it ruffled his blonde hair. “Care to be more specific?”
Natasha smirked and leaned back in her chair. “Guess it’s time to live up to your promise, Captain.”
Rhodey gave a hearty laugh at that. “That’s what I like to hear. I’ve gotta go, but stay out of trouble. Love you Tones.”
Steve agreed, and determined that once they had a handle of his current movements and a location where they were keeping their victims, he and Bucky would go after Zemo and his closest associates, while Sam, Clint, and Natasha would perform the jailbreak, taking out as many members of the Masters of Evil as possible.
They were both panting hard, heavy breaths mixing together through the proximity. “I, uh.” He started, gently caressing Tony’s face, fingertips outlining his trimmed beard and trying to renew the blood flow to his brain. “I need to get you home.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and looked down at the concrete floor, too ashamed to meet Bucky’s eye. “I can’t even begin to tell you how sorry I am. It’s my fault that you lost your arm, and it’s my fault that all of those innocent people are dead. They used my weapons, and...and…”
Tony’s arms snaked around Steve’s neck and held him tight, fingers slotting themselves between Steve’s fine blonde hair. “I love you.” Without pausing to take a breath to think about what he was saying, he continued. “Dammit,
And then they were both suddenly too caught up in the movement of their bodies together to say much else. He writhed on top of Steve, movements erratic and desperate. Steve, the real genius in this relationship, got control of his hands for a moment to reach under to grab handfuls of Tony’s ass and lift them up in one fluid motion. Tony squeaked and wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, clinging to him without pausing his assault on his boyfriend’s neck. The mixture of lemon-scented soap and the faint hint of sweat swirled around Tony’s tongue, and he nipped a harsh bruise with his teeth, marking Steve as his own.
The archer raised his hands in defense, “Woah, woah. I only watched him for that week you asked me to, Cap. I swear. I have no interest in seeing what happens when you two turn off the lights.”
Sam looked positively ecstatic while Steve’s frown deepened to the point that Tony was afraid it would get stuck like that. “Tony, what are you talking about?”
“I don’t know about that.” Steve countered thoughtfully. “We might not have gotten to know each other the way we did, but I don’t think I would have been able to stay away from you for long.”
The Winter Soldier kicked in the door with one powerful boot, sending fractured, thin pieces of wood flying. The Captain threw his shield up in front of them both, letting the rain of bullets ricochet back towards the shooters, and he counted three men down with their own ammunition. He lowered it fractionally, giving the Soldier plenty of space to unload his round into the seven men hovering around the room. Shouts, curses, and screams erupted around them, but the Captain paid them no mind.
“Me too! I don’t see any problem with this.” Tony bit his bottom lip and willed for Rhodey to see reason.
Also, you might have noticed that Steve and Bucky's conversation was a little different than the movie. I'm not into victim shaming. Ever.
Tony wasn’t sure what to say to that. It was true that all of the abuse, destruction, and heartache he’d endured over the years had brought him straight to Steve. He could admit that if Howard and Maria Stark hadn’t been such shitty parents, and the Hydra mole in SI hadn’t sold weapons, then he and Steve probably wouldn’t have never met. If Tony hadn’t decided to break free from weapons manufacturing, he would be back at SÍ by now, working under his father and probably being groomed to take over the company one day. Who knows how many people would be dead? And...would the Avengers have come after his family eventually? Could he have been a potential target down the line?
Rogers shrugged absently. “Mob bosses can be Gryffindors too, Tony.” His face grew serious once again. “I need your word that you’ll be careful.”
“Thank you both for speaking about the attack, I know how difficult it must have been for you.” Steve told the teenagers earnestly. They were good kids who’d been through an ungodly amount, and his heart ached for them. He wasn’t sure what all he could do for them, at least not without talking to Tony first, but he did want to help. Besides the addition of the Maximoffs, Clint and Sam’s report was pretty standard.
Sam just stared open mouthed between Tony and the package, blinking intermittently. “You’ve gotta be shittin’ me, Tones. Just how smart are you? This is incredible.” He wondered aloud, eyes still wide.
“Hydra believes they can crawl out of their long buried grave and rise up in Boston. They are wrong. The Captain knows all, and sees all. You won’t give up your superiors, I know your kind too well. But you can pass along a message for me. Tell your boss that the same Captain who ended the Red Skull’s life with his bare hands will do the same to you. Hydra thinks they can regain strength? Regain numbers? They are wrong.”
Part II: Thirteen years later. I have 4 chapters of this part completed, and will probably write 2-3 more to finish off the story.
A stack of files, put together by Natasha and Clint, his two best intelligence operators, were strewn out in front of Steve, but he was interested in one in particular. An old enemy of Steve and Bucky’s from New York had resurfaced here in Boston. Their history with Baron Zemo went back further than the Howling Commandos, back to when Steve was about one hundred pounds lighter with an even shorter temper. Zemo had been one of the nastier neighborhood bullies in Brooklyn, one that had an appetite for choosing girls who didn’t want him.
Tony hesitated, his eyes flickering back and forth between the three of them. “I can go with Steve?”
Hope y'all have a great rest of your week! All of the comments and kudos are REALLY appreciated. Seriously, it's my favorite thing in the world and encourages me to keep writing.
Steve scooted closer to him on the couch and took one of his hands and gave it a squeeze. “Just talk to me, sweetheart.”
“It was a team effort,” Steve replied easily, voice calm. “But Tony was the one who took out the last of them. We don’t normally aim to kill people, but we weren’t given much choice.”
But his luck being what it was, Steve eventually pinned him down when Tony went to find a quiet spot to breathe.
“I want this!” Tony reassured him, reaching up to brush a hand through Steve’s hair. “I just meant…we don’t have to change anything about we were doing before, right? Because historically speaking…I haven’t been the best at relationships. And what we were doing before seemed to work pretty well?”
Tony really wanted to go and hold Steve’s hand. He wanted to curl up next to Steve like he had been doing for
Once upon a time, Tony Stark had met Steve Rogers in person and told him everything special about him came out of a bottle. And Steve Rogers had told him he knew men worth ten of Tony and that he only fought for himself.
Steve’s answering smile was gentler than Tony had expected given his earlier expressions. “Hey, Tony.”
have this now, and it was something Steve always liked to remind him of whenever Tony got a little too maudlin (which was often).
They eventually had to break apart for air. Tony felt flushed, heart racing in his chest and his breathing just as fast. His lips tingled, and he couldn’t help but look at Steve’s to see that they were flushed and slightly swollen.
on their doorstep, the near death experience and missed call to Pepper’s phone, and the superhero team now living with them, it hadn’t lasted. From one day to the next, Pepper had packed her things and left for the west coast, promising that she was still CEO and Tony’s friend but couldn’t be more.
Something flickered across Steve’s face that he wasn’t sure how to interpret. Only a second later, Steve returned Tony’s smile with a rather strained one.
That required a hell of a lot of trust if Tony was understanding K’salk’adi right. While one half of a paired leadership would discuss and set up treaties, the other half could do other activities to build up a strong relationship. Because of course Malnussians did everything together. (Earth nations would probably try and take this opportunity to stab each other in the back.)
“The living room needs cleaning,” Steve fired back, giving Clint a pointed look. Clint hastily shoved something under the couch. “Trust me, I can come up with something suitably creative.”
Because the Malnussians didn’t have mouths. No, they had something resembling mouths out of which something disconcertingly like clicking and hissing came out. Tony and Steve would have been lost if not for the translators they set up, conveniently tuned to Earth’s languages
Tony’s digging hadn’t turned up anything conclusive other than a super shady past and so Rhodey wasn’t likely to trust her.
Maybe everything wasn’t perfect, but it was far more perfect than anything else he’d ever hoped to have in this life. He had time to work the kinks out, and he wasn’t alone anymore.
Natasha had been directed to a different room, as had Thor. The Malnussians’s spaceship was definitely large, and Tony would
Tony wasn’t sure if he was breathing. He definitely wasn’t blinking, staring at Steve. It didn’t…it didn’t make sense. What Steve was saying…what Tony knew…things like this didn’t just happen, did they?
Steve sighed, sliding up on the bed until he was on the same level as Tony, sharing the same squishy pillow. “I love you, too.” He said the words like they were a challenge, but his eyes were soft.
.” Tony yanked off a gauntlet, frowning as it crackled ominously. He let it drop to the table before pulling off the other. “I’m protected against that – you aren’t.”
“I have seldom seen a pair of shield-brothers in such sync as you two,” Thor said fondly. “It brings me joy to know that you two have found your way to each other.”
“I guess,” Steve said, darting in to place another kiss to the side of Tony’s mouth. “Do the other dozen or so times not count?” He pressed a second kiss to the other side of Tony’s mouth, lingering to whisper, “We shared a bed last night, didn’t we?”
So just by the process of elimination, Steve had been the one to take care of Tony in the aftermath of Pepper. (Or not “take care of” as Tony wasn’t an infant and he hadn’t lost all powers of judgment after being broken up with.) Steve just…hovered.
Steve shook his head, standing as well. “Let’s table further discussion until Thor gets back. There’s no use making plans if we don’t even know what we’re facing.”
But Steve was also stubborn, ridiculously idealistic (which was as much a point in his favor as it was against), and emotionally dense. He was the guy who insisted he was fine even when there was a burnt hole in his
“C’mon, Tony. Did you think you and Rogers were being subtle? Because you weren’t. I was here for five minutes and figured it out.”
At least it hadn’t been anger or disgust. Tony didn’t know what he would have done with that (no, he would have holed himself up in his workshop and told himself to
And then, while Tony watched, Clint somehow drove completely off the road on the only track in that map and…ended up in space?
“It happened slowly,” Tony said quietly, “and then all at once. One day I looked up and realized…I want this. I want this every day for the rest of our lives.” Never mind that it had only been scant days since Tony actually
“I try to be,” Tony said, feeling his own cheeks heat. He brought his glass up to hide the telltale flush.
Tony dropped the pillow-like thing to see what Steve was talking about, half-expecting some monstrosity like in the deleted scenes from
“You threw the book across the room,” Rogers said, sounding amused. He had a fond grin on his face, eyes crinkled.
Rhodey knew Tony was bi. Or pan. They hadn’t ever really specified on which it was, only that Tony liked everyone regardless of genitalia.
Steve had never once told him that he was interested in men. Or in anyone, actually. Steve had been a pretty insular guy who only hung out with his teammates. (Natasha had tried to set Steve up on dates; they failed pretty badly and in often hilarious ways. There’d been dumpster diving involved for one of them.)
Totally doable. (Even with Steve’s hand still resting at the small of his back like he’d forgotten it was there. Tony sure wasn’t going to tell him to move it.)
Tony turned his head to kiss Steve back, the touch brief before he pulled away. “Is that a plan, Winghead?”
Rhodey smirked. “So long as you’re aware of it.” He reached out for another piece of bacon, only to be thwarted when Tony jerked the plate away.
They were aliens, but Tony had been through enough meetings through his work with Stark Industries to know politics. This was just…slightly higher stakes.
But the two clearly weren’t in the closet with all the dates they had. Rhodey had seen a few tabloid covers with photos of Tony and Rogers on their outings, and those rags were
.” He reached out to take hold of Tony’s still hands, loving the warmth and feel of calloused skin against his own.
Tony would definitely like to check this new bagel place out. Tony would also— “Are we dating?” Oops, that had not meant to slip out.
Not that he cared that much about his joints. Was he going to get any sleep tonight by sleeping next to Steve? He’d shared beds before, but that was with one-night stands or Pepper. (And Rhodey, but Rhodey had sworn off sleeping in the same bed with Tony after the third time they’d done so and Tony had sprawled on top of him.) This was…totally different because he would so like to date Steve but they weren’t actually dating yet everyone thought they were dating and so they had to keep up the pretense and to do so they had to share this alien bed or Earth would be blacklisted.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat at the mention, and he wasn’t sure what expression his face was wearing.
I am to know you. How lucky I am to have you as my friend, and I can’t believe I lucked out on having you like
“I got in around three this morning,” Rhodey said, “and found Tony sleeping on top of Rogers. I wouldn’t normally think anything of it, but this is
“Probably because he doesn’t want me to know. I asked him this morning and he says they’re friends.” Rhodey paused, giving Barton a pointed look. “They were sleeping on top of each other.”
hanging over their heads like an ominous omen) and he didn’t think he wanted to hear it so he continued speaking, “Hope you’re enjoying yourself. It’s not a party if you aren’t.”
Yet it was far too easy to remember how close he’d gotten to not having this. How many times he’d almost let this slip through his fingers due to his own stupidity and selfishness.
“That wasn’t a dream.” Tony dropped his eyes to their hands. “But…I thought…I thought you’d move on. Since I wasn’t…I wasn’t giving you what you wanted.”
Steve stared at Tony for a few moments, clearly thinking of several arguments. But he didn’t use any of them, leaning in to rub his nose against Tony’s. “If that’s so…do you want to spend the night with me on our…” He glanced back at the “bed.” “Squishy blob that looks like a mattress?”
“Uh-huh.” Rhodey snatched another piece of bacon, appreciating the crispiness that was done just right. Tony definitely hadn’t cooked this. Last time Tony had cooked bacon it had been too rubbery; before that it had been burnt black because he’d been distracted by something shiny. “There something you want to tell me?”
Their eyes were pure black, much like insects, and their eyelids closed sideways and in sequence, which was rather hypnotizing when one paid attention. Evolutionarily speaking, it was a relatively good idea to have two sets of eyes looking at all times. Much better than what humans did with their measly one set of eyes.
“It wasn’t flirting.” Natasha looked between Steve and Tony. “But I guess if it’s with Tony…you should be fine.”
“So let me…” Tony managed a breath, unwinding enough to be able to gesture, release some of the manic energy under his skin. “Let me get this straight. Because, uh…I might be misunderstanding some things. You said –
Rhodey gave it a fond pat, ignoring the gaudy red, white, and blue color scheme that he’d been talked into a few months ago by the U.S. government in hopes of inspiring recruitment. Tony had never let him live it down, joking that it looked like Captain America and Iron Man had a baby.
The difficult thing with everyone believing you were in a relationship even though you honestly weren’t was that there was no one to talk to.
Once outside S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony grabbed hold of Steve’s elbow unthinkingly (he really needed to rethink absolutely everything considering he hadn’t even noticed becoming so familiar with Steve’s personal space). “You seriously okay with this?”
Rhodey sighed, rolling his shoulders and picking up his pace as he walked over to the couch. He opened his mouth to wake Tony up, intending to say something along the lines of, “You know you’re not twenty anymore, Tones” when he realized that Tony wasn’t the only person on the couch.
There was someone sleeping on the couch, so Rhodey softened his footsteps, creeping around the edges of the room. He stopped upon recognizing Tony’s feet.
Although Steve’s kiss had been to the metal of the suit, Tony’s cheek burned like it had been to skin instead.
That didn’t mean Rhodey wasn’t going give Steve some kind of shovel talk in the future. But that could come later.
“Mal-whatever.” Fury gestured to the door. “If you’re not going to redeem me my twenty bucks you’re gone.”
“I didn’t always,” Tony said, remembering one awful year when he’d been unable to attend because of being framed for murder.
Steve Rogers was just as conked out as Tony, one leg and arm dangling off the couch while the other was curled over Tony, keeping him in place while they slept.
He couldn’t have predicted the fallout after Tony carried a nuke through a portal to outer space, but he had known that Pepper wasn’t the fondest of Tony’s Iron Man activities. That had just been one too many black marks for her, and there went Tony’s heart.
Steve’s ears were pink now, and Tony resisted the urge to reach up and stroke a finger along the edge. “Oh, um…” His voice was soft, shy in a way it didn’t usually sound like. “That’s…I’m glad.”
Tony looked up, managing a weak smile when he saw Steve there. “Cap, hey.” He wasn’t entirely sure what Steve wanted to say (with the weight of what had happened
“Of course he does,” Tony said, although it seemed to be said on autopilot. “I’m likeable. Why wouldn’t he like me? That’s like da Vinci not liking painting.”
Tony had no time to react at all before Steve leaned and pressed his lips to the spot on his faceplate where his cheek would normally be. But he could feel his cheeks burning and his stomach turn over several times in no way related to the eggnog.
“I think you lost the metaphor there.” Rhodey patted Tony on the shoulder. “Good talk, hm?” He finished his coffee in one big gulp, really needing to leave. “By the way, Pepper knows. She’s probably only a
“It’s not false, though, is it?” Steve asked, shrugging. “You said platonic is fine, right? Tony and I are good friends, so it should work out.”
“We wouldn’t want that, would we?” Steve murmured, a genuine grin crossing his face that quelled some of Tony’s panic.
Not that Rhodey could…fit into Tony’s suits. He was just a bit bulkier than Tony in the shoulder area. (It was the thought that counted.)
The warm body in his arms didn’t feel like Pepper as Pepper wasn’t this muscular and didn’t quite smell this way either.
“It need not be romantic,” Thor said. “The Malnussians simply prefer a lifelong bond – be it platonic or romantic.”
Only it had probably started with the handshake after the aliens in New York and continued when Tony invited the team to live in that “ugly” tower. Steve had come along without complaints, although he hadn’t interacted much with Tony at that point.
Tony glanced up, seeing a sprig of mistletoe overhead that he was relatively sure hadn’t been there before. Not that he’d checked before standing here, but surely he would’ve noticed that before?
Tony found him several minutes later playing Mario Kart with Clint, Natasha polishing her knives on the armchair in the corner as she watched. Bruce was snoozing on the other couch, glasses askew on his face. Steve seemed to be winning while Clint was in last place behind even the AIs.
“Man, if I had to make a list, I’d be here all day and I definitely don’t have time for that.” Rhodey smiled wryly. “You guys really aren’t subtle. If you want to keep it on the down low, maybe stop going out as much? Or cuddle less? Have less inside jokes? Hang out less?” He paused. “No, nix the last one. He makes you happy, Tony. I’m still not sold on whether Rogers deserves to have you but
A muscle tensed under Tony’s grip, but Steve didn’t otherwise react, looking forward as he walked down the sidewalk to Tony’s car. “Yes.” The word was clipped.
Tony narrowed his eyes, taking a pointed bite of his bagel. He regretted a second later when the peanut butter stuck to his palate. There was no way he was saying anything with a sticky mouthful of peanut butter.
“I love you,” Steve blurted out. And then his voice stuck in his throat and he couldn’t get anything else out.
“That was both of us, Tony. Shellhead.” Steve’s smile was weak. “I think we know better now, don’t we?”
Tony cleared his throat, drawing their attention back to him. “I’m not sure how things are on your world, but Earth has enough smaller nations that we have multiple leaders.”
“Yes.” Steve’s expression morphed into one Tony was keenly familiar with and which was entirely out of place in a party. It would be more fitting for a fight, and Steve didn’t
bed in the accommodations they had been provided by a very eager guide with a name too full of consonants for Tony to comprehend.
“Here we are,” Rhodey repeated, running Barton’s explanation through his head. “I…geez…” He rested his head in his hands. “Why didn’t he
Rhodey would have liked to protest, but he hated it just as much. Just…very quietly. Where no one could hear.
“Don’t remind me.” Rhodey hated remembering Tony in that kind of state. It never got any easier no matter how many times he’d seen it happen. Granted, it had significantly decreased since Tony became Iron Man, but that just made the occasions when it did happen so much worse.
Steve took a moment before responding, picking the words carefully. “Can’t I be happy that I’m in a relationship?”
Tony didn’t have to ask what Natasha meant. If they were able to fool their teammates, if they were able to fool
Rubbing a hand over his hair and patting it down, Tony sat up, eyes dropping to Steve’s side of the bed. He reached a hand up to where Steve had been breathing into his neck, eyes stinging.
“Well, I can’t help it, can I?” Steve’s grin crinkled his eyes, and he ducked in to press his nose to Tony’s temple. “My best guy’s standing here, looking all happy…”
“Screw the Malnussians.” Tony slid a hand under Steve’s arm and over his back, pulling him into a hug. “I’m going to give Rhodey a year’s worth of upgrades the next time he visits.”
“Well, uh…” A faint tint of red covered Steve’s cheeks. “The rest of you aren’t shut up in labs all day, are you?”
Steve didn’t seem appalled, laughing and giving Tony a bright grin that had his heart fluttering. “I’d date that, too,” he agreed. He stepped closer, reaching out to take Tony’s other hand. “I’d…definitely date that. Although I think we’ve been dating for months now.”
Steve was silent for a long moment, expression lost. “I don’t want to miss another chance because I waited too long,” he said eventually.
The gentle press of Steve’s lips to his hair tugged Tony’s attention back to his partner, more specifically to the distant expression in his eyes.
Tony really wanted to ask if Fury was as sold on the relationship as everyone else but they’d agreed beforehand to keep that secret as close to the chest as possible.
Steve studied Tony for a long moment, eyes searching. He slowly nodded, giving a small smile and reaching up to squeeze Tony’s elbow gently.
And whatever made Steve upset (which was this fake relationship if Tony was brutally honest with himself) wouldn’t make him compromise this mission, would it? Steve was a better man than that.
When Steve drew back, his eyes were bright and his cheeks flushed. “I…” He bit his lip, looking uncharacteristically shy. “The mistletoe was just an excuse before. Jan helped.”
days ago – that we were only friends. That you were fine with that. Now…you’re…not?” (Had it only been three days? It felt like an eternity.)
Rhodey could talk to Banner but JARVIS told him he was sleeping and Rhodey wasn’t about to go poking any sleeping giants. He at least had some sense of self-preservation.
glad to be in a suit that fight. The mosquito bites the others had gotten had taken a while to clear up.
“It was a last minute decision,” Rhodey said, heading over to the coffee machine. There was enough coffee in it for one last cup. He took the last of it with absolutely no shame. “I got in around three. Suit’s out on the balcony.”
Of course, at this point everyone thought he and Steve were in a relationship. Why on earth would they think that they hadn’t been able to get along?
Tony’s disbelieving snort came out before he could stop it. “That’s hysterical, Thor. Pull the other one.”
Tony looked up as Steve walked off, seeing the offending piece of mistletoe strung up on the ceiling. He didn’t exactly remember ordering mistletoe, but apparently he must have done it.
Tony turned his head enough that he could get a vague glimpse of Steve’s profile, but it wasn’t like he could make anything out from the shape of Steve’s hair.
It would be easier if they just went to sleep and tackled the problem again in the morning but what did Rhodey know. Apparently nothing according to Tony. Sure, he’d graduated MIT and gotten an awesome degree and job out of it, but he wasn’t anywhere near as neurotic as some
. (That assessment still burned when he thought about it, even if it had been rather painfully accurate.)
Tony looked rather like someone had hit him over the head with a wrecking ball, eyes wide and mouth slightly open. “You—”
, etc. Also the man could…maybe not cook, but throw together a semblance of a meal with a recipe that JARVIS provided.
– Steve reached down to take off the chest plate. Once it was gone, he stepped close and hugged Tony to him.
Steve shot Tony an indiscernible look. “I didn’t think we were dating,” he said slowly. “I thought…we’re friends, right?”
Steve had been roped into further discussions with A’gel’fush. Tony had been about to join them when K’salk’adi pulled him aside and offered to show him the ship and some of the technology.
wanted to go back home and not have to worry about pretending to be in a romantic relationship with Steve. Unfortunately, the Malnussians were somewhere in the orbit of Uranus, and the only reason Steve and Tony were here instead of somewhere still in outer space on whatever spaceship Tony would have thrown together was because of the Bifrost.
Gathering whatever courage he could, Steve surged forwards. “I love you,” he repeated quickly. “God, Tony, you’ve no idea how happy you make me. I hope I make you as happy as you’ve made me, and I never want to stop fighting by your side. You’ve been a rock in this future, and I can’t believe how damn
Fireworks went off in Tony’s brain, even as the rest of him whirled in confusion and his hands fluttered uselessly (because what? This didn’t make
Tony set his glass down on the nearest flat surface, turning blindly into Steve to wrap his arms around him. “I’m glad you did.”
“He’s not lying,” Natasha said after a moment. She raised her eyebrows in Tony’s direction before dropping them, face returning to its usual impassive expression. “But Clint’s right, Steve. You do tend to favor Tony.” A sly smirk started to dance at her lips. “It’s not like you bring lunch to any of
“All right. I’ll trust that either Romanov or Barton will be there to provide backup should you need it. Or Thor, much good that he’s been.”
The Malnussians didn’t have the same sleep cycle as humans but they did need to sleep and they had bedrooms that were suited for humans because of their humanoid physiologies. (Though Tony was curious about their spines. Did they have the same spinal problems humans did?)
A few hours and some more negotiating later, it was with a great deal of trepidation that Tony walked back to their shared bedroom, unable to resist shooting glances at Steve as if he could read the other’s mind. (But even Steve’s face was blank, and that didn’t reassure him at all.)
“You’re the only one who does dishes by hand here, Steve,” Tony said. “Everyone else uses the dishwasher for what it’s there for.”
It had been six months since then, and Tony had recovered with the help of his new team. Rhodey wasn’t yet sure if he could call them
Rogers was in the workshop when Rhodey sought Tony out. He wasn’t talking to Tony but sitting on a chair by one of the tables and sketching. He had one of Tony’s disgusting green smoothies next to his elbow and was actually drinking it with a straight face.
“He tends to do that,” Tony said. “I wouldn’t take it personally at this point. I think it comes of being a prince…”
They’d made up during their impromptu dimensional trip where Tony had been stark naked and Hela had a bone to pick with Thor, but that didn’t mean things were back to normal. If they were, then Tony wouldn’t be feeling so goddamn awkward around Steve. If they were, then Steve wouldn’t be looking at Tony with this unreadable expression that honestly scared the shit out of Tony.
Yes, Steve was apparently queer, but just because someone was queer didn’t automatically mean they were attracted to everyone. (It didn’t mean Steve was attracted to
Clenching his fingers into the squishy pillow, Tony squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to focus only on his breathing and the feeling of the mattress. It worked for a few minutes until Steve shifted and the mattress shifted with him, keenly reminding Tony who he was lying with.
Tony didn’t say anything else, but he almost dropped his glass when Steve gave him a hug, followed by a tender kiss to his cheek.
Tony was working his usual magic, some of the holograms flickering too quickly for Rhodey to read. The ones that were still let Rhodey see that he was working on some suit modifications, some explosive compounds for arrowheads, and a stretchy kind of fabric.
“For once not me!” Tony shot Rhodey a bright grin. “When’s the last time you got a video of me sans pants?”
Steve’s answer was another kiss, this one on the lips. It was gentle and dry, simply a press of lips, but it was so tender that it warmed Tony’s chest. When he drew apart, he murmured, “You don’t even have to ask, Shellhead.”
Coughing, Tony stepped into the room, giving an unsurprised Natasha a nod. “Having fun?” He walked over to Bruce to wake him up, poking him a few times in the forehead. “Hey, I thought we agreed no naps in the day. It just makes you grumpy.”
political leaders for Earth realized what they’d done, but better this than being put on a blacklist. “Where should we get started?”
The uncomfortable chest tightness was back, accompanied by a tight feeling in his throat that Tony had to swallow against. “It’s okay,” he managed, dredging up a smile that wasn’t as cheerful as it should have been. “What’s a little snuggling between best buds?”
He didn’t have much time to wonder what was going on with Steve because he was being kissed in the next instant, Steve’s warm hands holding his face tenderly and his lips gentle but firm.
Thor had been the only person capable of speaking to the giant squid and he’d said something to piss it off. Maybe he’d brought up calamari?
“Mistletoe,” Steve said, pulling back. What was visible of his face under the cowl looked faintly pink. “Merry Christmas, Iron Man.”
“I’m not.” Tony held the glass to his chest, biting the inside of his mouth. “I was just…remembering.”
Tony slowly slid the straw out of the mouth slit of his faceplate, relieved when it didn’t get stuck. It had happened a few times before when he did it too quickly. “Jarvis’s special recipe,” he answered warmly, giving Steve a smile that he couldn’t see. “I should probably ask you that. Eggnog any different from your time?”
Steve’s mouth was back on his, but it was gone before Tony could kiss back, only for Steve to press kisses to his cheeks, his nose, his forehead.
baseball, art museums, and – one time – a motorcycle show that wasn’t at all boring (he suspected it was pity for subjecting Tony to a four hour tour of an art museum that had Tony near bored to tears).
“I just wish you’d take better care of yourself,” Steve muttered once they were alone. “That’s all, Tony.”
“You should just quit while you’re ahead, Clint,” Natasha said, smiling in amusement. “Remember what happened with the fishing game?”
When Tony had woken the next morning, it had been to Rhodey giving him painkillers and forcing a few glasses of water down his throat. And when Rhodey had to leave several days later, it had been Steve who stepped in.
Tony backed out of the bathroom before he could say anything else incriminating, sitting down heavily on the bed. The soft, squishy pillow-like substance of the mattress depressed alarmingly under his weight but held.
“You’re the furthest thing from a coward I’ve met, Steve,” Tony said immediately, almost on autopilot.
Barton was watching TV in his suite and eating something that looked sickly sweet and exactly like the cereal box in Tony’s cabinet. He was also drinking coffee out of the pot.
“Of course, Shellhead.” Steve stepped closer, ducking his chin slightly. The tip of his ears were pink, but there was no reason for him to be embarrassed that Tony could make out. “I miss you when you’re not here.”
Standing, Tony went to dump out his cold coffee. He could get edible coffee at the bagel place. What self-respecting bagel place didn’t have coffee? “Let me guess…Natasha?”
Tony paused, eyes flicking over to Steve. It was a long moment before he responded, his voice quiet. “You and me both. Why do you think I do it? If one of us has to get hurt, it should be the one who can take more punishment.”
Tony frowned. He…hadn’t actually used that cot in a while. Largely because Steve tended to usher him out of the workshop when it was late enough and he was going to bed (and when had it changed from Steve leaving Tony in the workshop to Steve taking Tony out of the workshop with him?). “I’ll get a new one,” he said eventually.
“You have breakfast yet?” Steve asked, smiling brightly. “If not, I thought we could go check out this bagel place that just opened up?”
Tony looked relatively perky the next morning. Which probably meant he was on his third cup of coffee. He also had a plate of eggs and bacon in front of him, which Rhodey hoped he had
It…made him out to be rather stupid. Insecure. Like he was seeking validation and boosting for his ego.
about those books, right? I can now with confidence say that the only good thing about them was how they make the hours go by. One moment you’re reading about Bella moaning about biology class and the next thing you know there’s a weird vampire pregnancy thing and it’s morning.”
Heat flushed through Tony from all their points of contact. He was acutely aware of how their lips moved together, Steve’s hair under his fingers, Steve’s hands at his waist, and where their chests were pressed together. He spared a brief thought for the arc reactor digging into Steve’s skin but it was quickly forgotten when Steve shifted his head slightly and used the slight height difference to angle Tony’s head back.
Natasha was still sitting on the armchair, knives laid out. She shrugged in response to Steve and Tony’s glances. “You can’t pay for better entertainment than this.”
“I saw them for two minutes last night while they were dead asleep and I could see that. But it takes more than sharing a couch to make a relationship.” Rhodey stood. “I don’t want to have to put him back together again.”
,” Tony said, investigating the cooling mechanisms. “We’ve sent robots out to Mars, the third planet in our solar system, and there are satellites that were sent out to explore the further planets. Maybe one day but…” He blinked, looking up at K’salk’adi. “Short answer is no.”
“False advertising,” Steve replied easily. “And a catchy song that if someone starts singing will lead to dish duty.”
“Nah,” Steve disagreed, shaking his head. “I mean, put me in a fight with a clear plan and I’ll go in swinging. If there’s a right thing to do, I’ll do it, even if it’s difficult. But this? I’ve never been the one to make the first move; didn’t have a clue how to.” He smirked self-deprecatingly. “I wouldn’t have this time either. But…I missed my chance last time, you know? Went under the ice, woke up seventy years later and missed my date.”
. He was genuinely sweet, funny, kind, and so…amazing. (Ugh, he sounded like a lovestruck teenager there. …Wait.)
“I’ll have a look at it later,” Tony promised, which was definitely not the reason why Rhodey was here but a bonus. “Are you finally taking off the gun?”
Shaking his head, Tony checked the trackers in his arms to be sure that they were tuned to the right suit. Despite initial bugs and the sad death of Mark XLII in an unfortunate explosion during one of their villain fights (that suit had been buggy as hell from the get-go but Tony had been too fond of it to scrap it after he’d developed XLIII), the trackers were more convenient than putting on the bracelets.
“And now it’s in my cup.” Rhodey took a delicate sip, unwilling to burn his mouth. Once done, he said, “So you and Rogers.”
Actually, was it even a bed? It didn’t have a bed frame or the requisite mattress expected of a bed. There were pillows but they looked like various soft, squishy things that the Malnussians had put on top of another soft, squishy thing that would appear to be their mattress. The entire setup was on the floor. There was a thin blanket provided that Tony wouldn’t even use in the summer unless he was on the beach.
“That’s good,” Tony said, pressing lips into Steve’s hair. He mouthed three words into his hair because it was probably too soon to actually say that, right?
Some minutes (three to be specific) later, Steve said, “Do you know if Mr. Stark’s going to be here?”
Rhodey shook his head fondly, heading outside where Tony had parked the suit after doing the upgrades.
Tony smiled into his glass of non-alcoholic eggnog as he saw Luke hold Dani up to the tree, letting her reach out to tap at one of the less fragile ornaments. Most of the ornaments weren’t fragile, but there were a few nicer ones tucked away in the top branches. They’d survived this long simply because no one wanted to face Jarvis’s wrath if they were broken.
“That didn’t sound fine. That sounded the opposite of fine to me. You could stand to sound a little more excited.”
“Fine.” Tony twirled on the chair, the holograph popping up in front of him with Fury’s face. “What can I do for you, Director?”
Steve scowled, crossing his arms over his chest, biceps bulging impressively despite the long-sleeved shirt he had on. (Or maybe because of it; Steve’s shirts tended to run super tight. Tony had never cursed it more before.) “So now you admit you were sick,” he said. “Maybe next time you’ll actually stay in bed!”
But that was then. Now…now Tony couldn’t quite map out the trajectory that had led to their current relationship.
Tony was tempted for a one horrible second. “No. That’s a terrible idea, and that’s coming from me. No, just… This is going to go badly, isn’t it?”
No, it was safer to observe from another seat. He got a conciliatory fist bump from Barton and a candy bar.
“Yes,” Steve groaned, rubbing the side of his neck. “Just…” He sighed. “I’ll talk with her.” He brightened a second later, giving Tony a sidelong look. “Bagels?”
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve said again when he joined Tony on the couch, slinging an arm around his shoulders.
Tony guessed the antennas picked up sensory input, but they did seem to wiggle enticingly when the Malnussians greeted each other. And they brushed the antennas against each other in greeting, so some kind of handshake?
Tony considered pretending he was asleep for all of five seconds before answering with a low “hm?” That was casual enough, wasn’t it?
Seeing no help from him, Tony turned back to Thor. “Can you go back and tell them it was a mistake?”
“I am not joking,” Thor said, looking only vaguely offended at the notion. Time was that Tony would have had to explain the metaphor; thank God Thor had picked up enough Earth slang to follow along.
Yet it was impossible to miss Steve’s body heat as he moved closer, coming to stand directly by Tony. His friend was in civilian clothes this year, although a hint of blue chainmail peeked out of the top of his shirt where his collar was slightly disheveled.
, but Tony put his body through enough punishment that he wasn’t going to be any happier than Rhodey would be if he slept in that position.
By the morning Rhodey had to leave, he had a plan in mind, sidling up beside Tony and stealing the last of the coffee.
A sweet grin stretched Steve’s lips, his eyes crinkling. It was a look that transformed Steve’s face, and Tony had never before realized just how much he
“Yes,” Rhodey said slowly, “that thing where two people who like each other very much eat together, hang out, and cuddle? Or maybe not cuddle. But you definitely cuddle so that’s going in the list.”
He beat a hasty retreat before Steve could respond, cursing his newfound feelings to hell and back. He was not going to let them get in the way of his friendship with Steve. He was
“Yeah?” Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist, tucking his thumb into Tony’s waistband. He pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s temple. “That should be my line.”
“War Machine,” Tony responded blandly, taking a pointed sip of his coffee. “Although at this point I can’t even call it War Machine. Looks more like a trussed up party favor than a lethal suit.”
“I have a perfectly serviceable cot in the workshop,” Tony said, not quite sure how they’d gotten to this point. The others were watching them like a tennis match. “You’ve slept on it.”
Normally Steve would love to see Tony tinker away at his suit, but now was not a good time. Not with the nerves still swimming through his stomach and making him decidedly queasy. “Tony.”
“Why did it take us so long?” Tony didn’t realize what he was about to say until he said it, the words quiet and almost lost to the noise around them.
From there it had turned into more outings, Tony dragging Steve to tech conferences and some of his university lectures and Steve retaliating with
“I would have thrown it out the window but at that height it would have killed someone and I’d have been blamed instead of Meyer for writing that.”
“The last time you were asked to flirt with someone as a distraction you said something about it being a very nice day and then started talking to them about what drinks at the bar were any good.”
“The last one.” Steve pulled a face as they reached the car. “Both. Okay, maybe the guys living in the apartment down the hall from us were in a relationship and not just really good friends. But nowadays you can’t even hug another guy without someone looking sideways at you and thinking you’re gay. I mean, I’m sure as hell queer, but that doesn’t
Tony managed to swallow the bagel and washed down the last of the peanut butter with the coffee, narrowing his eyes and leaning forward over the table. “You just wait, Rogers.”
Tony looked up from the glass of eggnog he had been contemplating to see Steve standing there, looking strangely shy in a manner not at all befitting Captain America.
“Of course.” Steve leaned in, kissing him gently. He tilted his head when he drew away. “Should we send the Malnussians a fruit basket?”
“You’re not about to drink a motor oil smoothie because you’re not paying attention,” Steve said, looking rather uncomfortable with the current line of questioning.
Rhodey had pulled a few all-nighters himself in his heyday, but he was in his forties and his body didn’t really appreciate all-nighters anymore. Even less when alcohol was involved. Rhodey should just stop letting Tony weedle him into a martini that ended up turning into lines of shots because Rhodey wasn’t
It had been Steve who extended the olive branch, hesitant as it was, with an invitation to a baseball game. Tony wasn’t at all a fan of baseball, but something about the raw look on Steve’s face had made him say
“Of course not! They would see it as a mortal insult and inform others that we are not to be trusted.”
the details. He had standards and TMI was not something he was into it. But the dates! The romance! He was into living vicariously and making sure people treated his best friend right.
“I do, you know,” Tony told Steve eventually once he was sure nothing of his true feelings would escape. “It may not look like it, but I do take care of myself.”
“Steve.” Tony was glad that his voice didn’t shake, and he gave his old friend a smile that was hopefully not too bright.
fudge the math with?” He pointed the end of the screwdriver at Rhodey’s chest. “My suit. Cough it up.”
Narrowing his eyes at Rogers, Rhodey slowly backed away, making sure not to wake either of them. It was rather surprising that he hadn’t woken a so-called super soldier up, but he supposed that Rogers was sleeping too deeply to hear anything.
To Tony’s surprise, Steve went pink and averted his gaze. He mumbled something that Tony didn’t catch and stumbled off to the bedroom, nearly tripping over a stray shoe.
“Being electrocuted was part of the plan?” Steve asked, annoyed. He was glad that the rest of the team had scattered after debriefing, clearly sensing there was going to be an argument.
“Did you miss the part where neither of us are diplomats? I’m not sure my skills at pissing off board members will do any good here.”
,” Tony had blurted out. He immediately tried to calm down. “Er, I mean, absolutely. I am definitely interested in learning more about your technology. But aren’t we needed elsewhere?” He’d gestured in the direction of K’salk’adi’s partner.
Tony smiled, shifting his eggnog glass to his other hand so he loop his own arm around Steve. He looked up in time to catch young Sam sneaking off with an entire plate of what looked like Jarvis’s special cookies. Miles was right behind him.
When Rhodey went to look, the only brand of cereal available was the sugary sweet kind with a shit ton of marshmallows. It was empty except for a stray piece at the bottom.
“We should bring S.H.I.E.L.D. into this,” Steve said, reaching up to squeeze Tony’s shoulder comfortingly. “They’ve got resources we don’t, and they’re supposed to handle these types of situations. We’re a line of defense, Thor.”
Finally, something in Tony’s brain seemed to kick into gear, and he was able to touch Steve, his hands coming up to where Steve’s were holding his face. “I’m here.”
Iron Man was the best of him, but Iron Man was an ideal. A suit. Tony put it on because he had something to do, something to achieve that he couldn’t otherwise. He’d used it for a few irresponsible things (like throwing terrible birthday parties) but that was in the past. Tony wouldn’t do that now (not with his
“Oh, Tony.” Steve drew back, bringing a hand up to stroke the back of his fingers along the side of Tony’s face. “Don’t you know? It was always you.”
Whatever response Tony could have had to that died at the simple honesty in that statement. He blinked, completely flat-footed. “Er…no,” he managed, wrinkling his nose in mock offense. “Why would I miss him? He stole my suit!”
“Are you a coffee thief now?” Tony asked, shooting Rhodey a look of utter betrayal. “Is that how far we’ve come? I take you into my home, feed you, clothe you, give you free upgrades, and this is how you repay me? By stealing my coffee?”
“Jury’s out on that,” Rhodey said. “I’ve got a few days here. Maybe I’ll see about spending some time with him. See if he’s got what it takes to be in a relationship with Tony.”
Exhaling lowly, Tony had the lights turn off, using the light of his arc reactor to guide him. He didn’t hesitate to head over to the bed and slip under the blanket. He was promptly surprised at how warm the blanket was, belying its flimsy appearance.
Tony picked one of the soft, squishy things up as Steve went to inspect their bathroom. He squeezed it between his hands, finding it highly malleable. It regained its former shape the instant he let go.
Steve didn’t seem deterred. “I’ve always wanted you. I just never knew how to say it, and I didn’t want to ruin what we had. But I’m tired of waiting and you almost
“Sorry!” Steve was wide-eyed, hair rumpled and sleeping shirt askew. “I…I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
This wasn’t the first time Tony had to sleep away from home for business related reasons (disregarding the
Several arguments, a civil war, and an alien invasion later, Tony found himself standing in the same room as Steve and not in an argument with his former best friend. That it was Christmas probably had something to do with the matter.
Glancing over to see their hosts occupied with greeting each other, Tony sidled over to Steve, lowering his voice to ask, “All okay? There wasn’t any trouble, was there?”
on the balcony, opening up a second later to let Rhodey out. It closed up behind him and powered off except for the soft blue glow of the arc reactor.
Tony shrugged, waving a hand. “I don’t know! I’ve been…told that it looks like we may be dating? So…uh…are we?”
Steve was in bed under the flimsy blanket when Tony finished his routine in the bathroom. His back was towards Tony, so he wasn’t able to see what kind of expression Steve had on his face.
It was more of a surprise to find out that Rogers wasn’t as straight as history had painted him to be (and how the conservative groups liked Captain America to be), but Rhodey knew better than most how history liked to whitewash events.
Tony forced himself to keep his breathing even despite the increasing pressure in his chest. All drowsiness was long gone. “Change to what, Steve?”
They should probably go out and finish up their negotiations so they could go back home and enjoy their new relationship in peace and quiet (or not so much quiet because the rest of the team was there). But all Tony wanted to do right now was just cuddle with Steve.
When Steve forced himself to end the screaming, he pressed a hand to his rapidly beating heart, chest having with every breath, eyes wide and darting from the contents of the bathtub to Tony, sitting calmly on the edge of the bathtub. Opposite to Steve, he was opened and relaxed and kept looking at his boyfriend with his head tilted to the side gently, both interested and amused at the way Steve flattened himself against the door in panic.
Sam nodded, not understanding the change and glancing over at other drag queens in the bar, but everyone seemed puzzled as he was.
Steve looked back, and scoffed, at Figaro who stood on his hind paws, and was curiously glancing inside the box.
“It is how I usually show up. I think it would ruin the experience if I entered as a male and walked out as a female on the stage,” he explained himself with a shrug.
"You are not fine!" Tony decided, batting Steve off of him and pushing out of the bedroom, "Claritin is the kitchen cupboard, take it!" he ordered in a firm voice which was a total contrast to the half-naked torso and loose tie. Before Steve could react, Tony slammed the door shut, needing to air the room out first.
Steve drew his eyebrows together. Tiberius got transferred to their school at the beginning of this year. That's how long. "Tony, you have to tell someone-"
Tony took out one pump and ran his fingers over the shiny surface, and Steve saw the red sole of the boot. Then he took out the other one and held both of them in one hand.
Tony didn’t reply, just stared, his brown eyes widening. Steve was… apologizing to him? Not the other way around?
"I can't tell anyone, because my family depends on it!" Tony yelled back, pressing fists against his eyes to stop a wave of crying. Steve was taken aback by that.
"The alcoholic one!" Tootsie exclaimed, holding her beer can high, the rest of her sisters joining in a cheer.
Tony didn’t answer, just kept grinning and very soon reversed their position, with Steve this time on his back and Tony climbing over him. Maybe Steve let him, or the neck tickling weakened him, but Tony would take it either way.
"AHA!" Steve called in triumph, holding the tweezers. "Let's see how you like it!" he said with an evil grin, leaning in and planning to make Tony taste his own medicine.
So, basically, Steve had used one of the best, if not the best, agents SHIELD has ever hired to work as a glorified pizza boy. And the said pizza boy looked delighted with receiving direct orders from Captain America. Seriously, Tony had to fight an urge to chase Coulson down the corridor and wave his wedding ring into the agent’s face, but he was above such acts of childish jealousy.
Steve’s brow furrowed as he watched the gif, frame by frame. There was no doubt that it was tickling, fingers gliding over tied man’s armpits and sides. Steve expected this to be a prelude, something more to follow, but it was all. Tickling was the main point. Steve blushed when he realized that if there were gifs, there had to be a video and who knew how long it was. How many minutes would it take to bring someone to the brink of hysterics, to make them crumble, but at the same time make it pleasurable? People were not forced into filming porn and following that principle, there were not forced into filming tickle kink videos.
Reality hit him hard hours later, while he stood at the gate leading to a cemetery. After a sweet morning and pancakes for breakfast at Tony’s favorite diner, he didn’t expect their route to lead them here. Tony trotted back to him, holding a bouquet of sweet smelling white gardenias and a plastic bag with two grave candles. Steve took the bag and they entered the cemetery grounds, Tony leading the way.
"Hey, we just saved your ass, be a little grateful-" Bucky yelled back and Tony lifted his head up, his face set in anger and tears on his cheeks.
“Yeah, okay,” Steve agreed in a small voice, hearing Red Velvet leave. His stupid body had to betray him in such moment.
"Yeah, sure," Steve assured breathlessly, focusing back on his gorgeous boyfriend. Whatever it was, he would be happy to assist.
"And what if you need to use the bathroom?" Tony asked with a laugh, seeing some major flaws in the plan.
At first, Tony thought that Steve meant kissing. He would be very happy if Steve meant kissing. Instead, five fingers were running up and down his side in quick movements, digging in his soft skin.
And so Steve, feeling scolded, got back to his and Tony’s shared floor, planning to hide, except that he was assigned a very simple task for the week.
"Oh, you want me to do more?" Steve asked, and somehow Tony didn't like the tone of his husband's voice. The bathroom door opened wider, and Steve stood in it, holding his phone up and snapping a photo.
Steve saw a teenager, popping his head from above a motorbike he was working on. Just like that, Steve bugged his eyes out. It was a prime condition Harley Davidson Panhead Chopper. A model from the 60s. It was an old-school type of bike and Steve never saw a one up close.
When Tiberius opened his eyes he saw two guys, people he didn't pay attention to earlier, but knew that attended the same school. They were juniors, like Tony, and members of the football team and if he wasn't wrong, the blond one was the captain. He noticed that Tony was free, on all fours in the mud, and escaping Killian. Coward. He would pay for this.
“You are performing drag for how many years?” Steve asked, scribbling intensely in his sketchbook. His hand was starting to hurt, but it would look suspicious if he suddenly would stop making notes.
“Any wishes for breakfast?” Steve asked, putting one hand behind his head and making himself more comfortable. Just a slow morning while he was holding a person he could proudly and loudly call his boyfriend. It was a good morning.
“Captain Rogers sends his regards,” the agent continued, pointing Tony’s attention to a pizza box, one Tony didn’t notice before.
"No, I didn't expect it! Yeah, a total surprise. What do you mean by about time?! Girl, you are older than I am and got married two years ago! By the way, my invitation still didn't arrive. I know, right? Damn post, always losing things..."
“Are you holding tweezers?” Steve murmured out in his half-awake state, not bothering to open his eyes. He was not falling for the same trick again.
The concept of snacks wasn’t strange to Steve. Heck, back in his apartment in his own pantry, he always kept a stack of animal crackers for the days he felt nostalgic, and always had on hand a bag of salted potato chips to have something to snack on during watching TV. Having snacks was perfectly normal. But this… This was numerous bags of pretzel sticks, potato chips in five different flavors, pop tarts, sugary cereals… Clearly hidden away. And so the abundance of fresh products finally became clear.
Steve curled his fists out of frustration as he watched Tony changing into dry clothes lend by Bucky. It seemed that Tony's school life wasn't as dreamy as everyone thought.
Red Velvet was a part of someone else. Someone else Steve didn’t know and probably would never have an occasion to meet. Everything he ever imagined about Red Velvet might not be true.
"Maybe later," Steve started walking out of the kitchen. Sam always offered him free pastries and Steve was grateful, but sometimes it felt as too much. Although, he wouldn't say no to some cheesecake. "Hey, I will see you this evening, right?"
Thankfully no one had commented on the distinct lack of alcoholic beverages this year. Tony wasn’t sure what he would have done if they had beyond shrugging loosely and pretending it didn’t bother him.
His only response was a shrug. “I dunno. You hang around long enough you become one with the wallpaper?”
On his birthday, Steve had woken up exactly four times before leaving the bed. Which was rather unusual as on most of the days, he had a very regular sleeping pattern, but was a light sleeper, schooled to react to every sound, a skill he had acquired during his years as a soldier and which continued as an Avenger.
"Don't worry, I will leave you this one," Steve said, pointing to the cigarette Tony already had been holding, "for goodbye. And tomorrow I am buying you a nicotine gum."
And that’s how he ended here. Waiting and growing more nervous. Red Velvet agreed to meet with him, but there was no guarantee that she would show up. He only hoped he didn’t appear creepy to her and she agreed just to get rid of him. That won’t make things awkward at all.
