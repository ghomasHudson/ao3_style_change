And then all at once he rubberbands back into his own skin, back here with Tony in his arms, with Tony whispering kind words in his ears, desperately chanting gratitudes into Tony’s neck.
“Don’t worry, Tony, it’s getting easier. Being with the team, at the mansion, it makes it - now - feel a little bit more like home every day.”
“You need a ride back to the mansion?” Tony offers, after a few minutes. “I’ve gotta get back into the office, hit the books.” Even his grimace manages to look handsome.
“Oh my gosh, Tony? Are you okay?” He stumbles over parts - maybe from the armor, Iron Man damaged it in their last outing - and sets the tray down on the coffee table in front of the couch.
Part of the problem is that Steve is very good at going unnoticed. His looks at Mr. Stark are surreptitious, brief, and casual. He doesn’t let his eyes roam - not like he wants to - and focuses on parts at a time. Just on his wrists and his hands covered in scars and calluses. Just on his nose and the play of his lashes on his cheeks.
He has to wait until everyone else is done with their food, gets up, and wishes him good night before he can stand and shuffle awkwardly to his room, desperate to deal with his aching cock.
Sharon’s face is perfectly blank when she sees him, just like Tony’s is. It’s a habit whose barbs they’ll have to carefully unhook from their skin. She leads Tony inside without touching him, without greeting, and it feels like a relief that she understands.
“I’ll never leave you. Never. And I would marry you, if it were legal and if it weren’t too fast for your poor romantic heart. But,” Tony swallows, “I can make it so that you will always have a home, and you will always be taken care of. That no one will be able to take this away from you, even if they take me away from you.”
When he’s back in that headspace, overfull and light and full of warmth, where his mouth opens and he speaks without thinking, Tony asks him questions again.
“Tony, Tony, please, you have to tell Cap and Ant-Man about that time Angelica passed out while you two were dancing. I thought I would die of laughter.”
They never touched like Sharon is touching him, like even the barest of contact will do. It still hurts, but it doesn’t feel like a weapon against his skin.
“But when they let me onto the team, and into their home, I didn’t care if it was the future or not. Someone cared about me, enough to trust me. Enough to give me something I needed so very, very badly.
Steve nods immediately. “Yes,” he says breathlessly. “You - god, Tony, you have no idea how hot you look right now.”
“I just - I don’t want to presume,” Steve stammers out. “You’re a busy fella, and I’m - I mean, I wouldn’t blame you, I guess is what I’m saying. If you didn’t.”
“He didn’t have to be persuasive. I would have done anything you’d asked of me, anything at all, if it made you happy. The only thing I want is to make you happy and I can only ever fuck that up. I’m so sorry,” Tony said, his voice breaking and cracking into sobs. Steve wasn’t sure if he was sorry for not helping enough or sorry for saying all of this. Maybe both.
of questions. Why would Tony Stark be interested in whether or not Steve was okay? Shouldn’t he have more glamorous, exciting people to be talking to? Or better, more interesting projects to work on?
Steve nods, keeping his mouth closed around the beef short ribs - he thinks Tony called them “kalbi” in a strange accent - sucking meat from the bone. Tony looks pleased with himself, and Steve feels an enormous swell in his chest that
“I hate when you talk to me like that, because I don’t deserve it,” Tony said instantly, face still in his hands, whole body clenched tight in on itself like a fist ready to strike.
Tony doesn’t remember Sharon being pregnant, but he knows she isn’t lying. He knows she’s looking at Tony as she says it because she’s really saying it to their Steve, to the Steve who isn’t here, the Steve who doesn’t make them touch him.
Steve nods. “The first time I met Tony, I thought he was a robot. And I remember thinking that there was no way this was the future, if Mr. Stark's robot was less convincing than Jim had been.
He holds Tony’s hand in his, and Tony seems to come back down from wherever he was looking. Like he’s focused the spotlight of his attention on Steve, instead of whatever peril he thought faced them in the future.
Steve pulls out his sketchbook from the side table instead. He knows what he’ll draw, same as always, but at least he can get lost in the drawing. He opens it and flicks through the pages until he finds a blank one. It’s a lot of drawings of the same subject. Tony laughing, Tony smiling, Tony looking serious - from a press conference - Tony winking, Tony yawning, Tony with his hair mussed up, Tony with his hair slicked back, Tony with the paper curled under his arm, Tony holding a briefcase, Tony wearing his nice suit, Tony in a tux, Tony in a sweatshirt. He has a page of sketches of the parts of Tony that draw his eyes the most - the slender arch of his fingers, the hook of his nose, his lips, his forearms, his neck.
Iron Man is a lifesaver. He listens to Steve, cares about Steve, and fights alongside Steve. Iron Man is his best friend in the future, and might be the closest he’s ever felt to anyone since Arnie. So he should be able to talk to Iron Man about his crush, he should be able to share his feelings.
“I… okay. Okay,” Tony says, because she’s not wrong. His guilt complex could level countries. “But, why meet them…?”
It doesn’t help that he gets nervous around Mr. Stark. He’s normally very aware and in control of his body, but when Mr. Stark is around, Steve becomes harshly aware of every minute movement of his own body, desperate not to make a fool of himself by revealing his feelings. All of his grace leaves him - he’s never knocked over nearly so many things, or hit his shins nearly so much, since he was hit with the VitaRays.
He built the Invaders, he pieced them together with a fierce determination that said “I will not lose this family too.”
“You got eyes for Cary Grant?” He says to Steve, laughing. His robotic laugh is so strange, but Steve likes to hear it.
Steve rushes to his side, kneeling down in front of the couch. “What can I - are you - how,” he stammers, hovering his hands over Tony, not sure if he’s allowed to touch.
He can see a tear tracing the wrinkles in Sharon’s cheek. She nods, gets up, and goes to the kitchen. She pours a glass of water that neither of them will end up drinking.
“And I mean, I’m just a kid, really, especially, you know, with this stuff - I’m just turned 24, at least if my math is right, and - I mean, I haven’t even gone to university like you. You’re - you’re just. You’re real swell, Tony, and I’m nothing, not without the shield, and I don’t want to be Captain America when I’m with you, you know? I don’t - I want you to like me, not - not him.
“I thought maybe if I wasn’t around you, it would be easier for the both of us. You would forget about me, and I would… stop feeling the way I do about you. It sounds like both of those things were misjudgments on my part. I’m sorry that I made you feel like that - if I had known, I would have held you close even if it meant I got hurt.
“You’re not weak,” Steve said gently, trying to ignore that Tony said he wanted to kiss him as he inspected the wound in Tony’s arm.
He doesn’t know why he’s so afraid to talk about Mr. Stark. It might be that the man is Iron Man’s boss. It might be that Iron Man would feel jealous. It might be that it would make it too frighteningly real. Being sweet on someone you’re living with is massively different than being sweet on a distant movie star.
The thing in Steve’s skin loves that they look at each other. “The two most important people in my life. You should love each other just as much as I love you,” it says, and Tony wants to vomit. The real Steve, wherever he is, doesn’t love Tony. He loves Sharon. He’s always only ever had eyes for Sharon.
Tony had found receipts on Steve’s card for pregnancy tests during the war, during a period Tony has no memory of. He’s found appointments to doctors who specialize in fertility treatments.
She folds her wrinkled hands together, hands Tony has seen in places and contexts he never would have wanted to, and Tony can’t help that his eyes are drawn to them. Such a subtle shift now would have been an earthquake in the facility. A desperate cry for attention.
It’s a certainty, a knowledge still in his chest, nestled next to his heart, right next to his own name.
Steve wants to reach out and touch, wants to let his fingers explore every inch of Mr. Stark until he can see him with his eyes closed. He thinks about what Mr. Stark smells like, in his fancy clothes. He thinks about Mr. Stark in his workshop, developing the Iron Man armor. He thinks about Mr. Stark covered in engine grease with his perfect hair tousled.
“How about you?” Steve hears himself asking, only aware after he says it that he is genuinely curious. “How are you doing?”
They were all facts, as she was saying them, but only at the last one did Tony startle, his shoulders twisting against Steve’s stomach, looking up at him with wide eyes.
Tony doesn’t get the things he wants. Not without a fight. Tony doesn’t just get to have Steve like this.
Tony wants to vomit. He wants to dig his hair out if his scalp. He clamps his teeth around the soft flesh of his cheek and clasps his hands together so tightly they go white.
Steve has a history of falling for beautiful, unattainable people. Bucky and Toro would tease him for it, in their easy way, when he was with the Invaders. They would take him to the pictures when they had leave and watch his face to see who his eyes lit up at.
“Something so precious that it feels like, when you lose it, you won’t be you anymore? Like your chain has been cut from your anchor?”
Steve lets out a massive sigh of relief, before nodding. “He does. God, that’s good to hear. I was in conniptions thinking you hated me, or Tony. I really didn’t want my friend to turn out to be a homophobe, especially like this.”
Tony laughs weakly. “You’re good - great - god you look so hot right now, holy shit Steve, I just - kind got stuck,” he pants.
He’s glad Iron Man and Mr. Stark have such different schedules, because he’s sure if Iron Man saw the way Steve acted around Mr. Stark, he would know what Steve was feeling immediately.
Tony calls a car to pick them up, and if you asked Steve what they talked about on the way home, he could not tell you.
spoken to Steve like that. “I appreciate your concern for him. You know how much you both mean to me.” Tony feels like the world is falling out from under him. What is happening?
“That’s easy to say when you didn’t build the weapon! Knowing that people are using the things I am responsible for to kill innocent people, or anyone at all, it’s awful. It feels like the blood is on my hands.” Tony isn’t looking at Steve now. His hands are folded in his lap and he is glaring intently at his plate. Even the bags under his eyes and the exhausted pallor of his skin don’t do much to diminish how wickedly handsome he is to Steve, though.
“I know, I know, it’s ridiculous. He’s obviously - you know - he’d never think of me like that. Can’t help it, though. Like you said, uh, when we were watching that film. Hot brunettes?” Steve smiles a little sheepishly.
Steve loves the mansion. Not because it’s fine, though it is, and not because it’s large, though it is that too, but because Tony is there. Iron Man is there. He sees it - them, really, as the stability he needs for joy to grow.
“Oh, hey, it’s okay. Some dicks are different than others, but all dicks are beautiful.” Tony sounds so earnest when he says it. Steve can’t help from laughing.
“It’s cool, I have some, just wanted to save it in case we got up to something more,” Tony pauses, smirking, “penetrative.”
Tony smiles, his breath catching for a second. “Yeah it’s a good start. You wanna tell me you love me again, I bet that’ll help too.”
The broken sob that rips up from his chest is entirely involuntary. He must still be dreaming, but it feels so real. Steve’s lips are soft and warm on Tony’s, his hand curling in the hair on the base of Tony’s neck, his grip firm. It feels so fucking real.
“I thought, I mean, when I saw it, I thought maybe you’d like to - to try it out. I was hoping to surprise you,” Tony admits sheepishly, “but I forgot how…
“Sure, I might say that too if I were pissed at him.” Steve tries to think of a time in recent memory when he hasn’t been pissed at Tony. Back when they were making the Avenger’s Machine, spoke by spoke, and it felt like maybe hope was something he could hold in his hands.
Steve didn’t see anything in the news, but he supposes they might be the kinds of things that don’t get shared with reporters.
he thinks absently. That’s the prettiest smile he’s ever seen. “Cleared my schedule, just for you. You’re an important member of the team.” He claps Steve on the shoulder.
The clothes she gets for him are much tighter than he was expecting. His movement isn’t impeded, thankfully, but he’s not sure if the effect is very flattering.
“Well, I don’t think he’s busy right now - I’ll call him and have him come over from the office. Why don’t you go meet him up in the library.”
The Korean Barbecue is amazing, and Steve can thankfully avoid saying anything too embarrassing by stuffing his face. It’s spicy, sweet, sour, and nutty. There are so many little dishes of things, Steve feels like he’s eating a feast.
Steve didn’t know what to say, so he took out a disinfectant wipe from the kit and cleaned the area of the wound.
He pulls out a small bottle from his pants pocket and squirts out lube onto his fingers. Steve doesn’t have time to react before Tony is carefully spreading it over the head of his dick and onto the foreskin. It’s cooler than he was expecting, but it feels amazing against the heat of his cock.
“Need you - need you - pull down my pants,” Tony grits out, raising his hips to let Steve pull Tony’s pants down his thighs, revealing the curve of his ass, inch by inch. Steve doesn’t have time to process that Tony isn’t wearing any underwear before he can see the barest peek of some kind of color between Tony’s cheeks.
When it’s out, like a plop, Steve can see the shape of it - curiously curved, sloping at an angle from the base. It’s not what he had expected Tony’s vibrator to look like, though then again he’s not entirely sure what he
But he can’t. He can’t think about those things. That’s not what Tony wants, could ever want, so he’s better off keeping those fantasies far away from Tony.
Tony tries to call for them, but even flexing his vocal chords makes them feel like they’re shredding. What the hell happened to him that his body is acting like this?
Hydra Supreme would smile as he made them do it, run a hand lovingly over their bodies, whisper kind words of encouragement to them. Tony isn’t sure he’s ever hated anyone as much as that man, in those moments.
This isn’t so coordinated, though. This pain feels raw. Tony doesn’t have quite the words to describe it, but he’s known quite a lot of pain in the years he’s been Iron Man. This pain feels like a whole body acid exfoliation. It’s as if every cell in his body has had the phospholipid layer stripped away, and now sits vibrating in place, organelles exposed. He feels like every scratch of blanket against skin when he shifts is scraping exposed muscle underneath. Every breath into aching lungs tastes like coppery blood.
“I’m so weak, Steve. All the other you had to say was a few words of encouragement and I was wrapped around his finger. I fucked up the second most important friendship to me, not that you can really rank this shit anyway, because he told me nice things. How does that make me anything but weak?”
“I thought the worst part of my life would be that year when I was director of SHIELD. During the skrull invasion, you were dead for all of it so I can’t blame you for not - anyway. I thought that trying to live on when you were dead was the worst thing I would ever experience. I probably would have erased my memories even if Osborn weren’t going after the database, you know? But I was wrong. That wasn’t even half as bad as you leading the Secret Avengers or whatever stupid name you called them, or when you were with the unity squad. When you were dead, I could be convinced it was my fault but that maybe you cared for me, even a little bit. Even if it wasn’t in the way I wanted.”
expected. In his drawing, he left it as vaguely egg-shaped like the ones he looked up online - certainly not as long and phallic as the thing still buzzing in his hand.
Tony’s digging his hand into Steve’s pants, under his underwear, and Steve can feel calluses on his dick. Wow, that’s… it’s intense. The scrape of Tony’s fingertips on the shaft of Steve’s cock feels like teeth and it’s way hotter than it has any right to be.
Steve slides up Tony, not wanting to break contact but wanting to reach his lips. He feels Tony’s semen through his t-shirt where he rubs the damp patches on Tony’s fancy shirt. And then he’s kissing Tony, falling into a rhythm they’ve already established over the last week, panting open mouthed into Tony’s lips, rutting his tongue against Tony’s and swirling it through Tony’s mouth. When he breaks the kiss and pulls away, Tony’s gaze is unfocused and his breaths are heavy.
Steve’s fingers, drawing slow circles on Tony’s hands, feel a flutter of a pulse before his thoughts, like ice floes, drift onto the knowledge that Tony is alive in his arms.
“I’m, uh, oh, wow, well, if that’s, if you’re sure that that’s, I mean, whatever you like is fine with,” Steve fumbles out, cutting himself off before he makes a complete fool of himself.
He can feel the weight of her presence on his mind, blanketing his thoughts, compelling him to speak true. It’s a heady, frightening feeling, especially with Tony in his arms and so much unspoken between them.
When Tony leans in again, it’s slow and careful. Tony’s lips are parted and his eyes are lidded and he looks so beautiful. Steve doesn’t want to stop looking at Tony, but as he sighs into the kiss and opens his mouth, he can’t bear to feel anything but Tony’s mouth and Tony’s tongue.
“I already told you I want to,” Tony says, looking up from Steve’s abs and grinning. “I want to hear you moan. Want to hear you beg for it when I make you feel so good. Want you to know it’s me around you.”
Tony hasn’t seen Sharon since they were freed from Hydra Supreme. It's not just that she’s been around Steve, the real one, who Tony can’t bear to face.
This. This is so much more. This is Tony seeing him, seeing all of the ways that poverty has twisted and bent him, and putting an arm under his shoulder, helping Steve walk anyway.
He can hear the voices again, on the distant edge of perception. Steve and someone else, someone he doesn’t quite recognize.
Bucky and Toro didn’t mind that he was over the moon for certain male actors. They didn’t seem to take his infatuation as seriously as Steve did.
It’s not just a delusion of martyrdom, an inkling of “I don’t deserve this.” Steve thinks it would be easier if it was, if he didn’t think he could deserve kindness.
“It’s like. Sometimes, the people you love hurt you. They don’t mean it, probably. And you hurt them too. And sometimes the hurt is too much, and you can’t be with them, even if you love them.
Before the Universe can continue this play of theirs, this choreography that Steve isn’t aware of dancing, he continues.
But it has kidnapped him, and every moment it makes him pretend to love it, to tell it what it means to him, to kiss it and fuck it and -
Steve’s hand is the right size. It feels right; how many times has Tony sat in this position and Steve stood in that one? How many times has Steve looked down at him with concern and scolded him for getting himself hurt? How many times has Tony dreamed that Steve’s concern would mean something more than just as a teammate, than just as a friend? How many times has Tony dreamed of this happening?
While they were in the submarine, heading back to New York, he asked Iron Man if they had movies still in the future. The robot-man-thing bent over with laughter. “Oh, Cap,” he said, “I can’t wait to show you everything you’ve missed.”
Tony lets out a sharp laugh. “Are you not getting enough food at the mansion, or are you always this hungry?”
“He didn’t have to. He could have gotten me my own place, or could have let me live there but not welcomed me like he did. But the thing about Tony is that giving someone something so precious isn’t even a question to him. He’ll do it like it’s instinct.
But now it’s not just Mr. Stark’s face he gets to moon over. Sometimes Mr. Stark - call me Tony, he said to Steve, and Steve couldn’t quite bring himself to do it - takes off his form fitting suit jacket and Steve can see his arms, his shoulders, his chest and his back. Steve can see the powerful shape of his thighs and the curve of his ass. It is overwhelming. And, if Steve was really lucky, Mr. Stark might roll up his sleeves and bare his forearms to the world.
“I… I don’t. Can’t. Not really.” Iron Man sighs, a breathy vibration. “But that doesn’t mean I won’t fight for what I have.”
“Hey,” Mr. Stark says, stopping them, his voice warm but firm. “What did I tell you when we first met? You call me Tony, understood?”
Steve decides that he loves Tony’s laugh. Sometimes it’s a huff, just a small puff of air from his nose. Sometimes it’s surprised, when he doesn’t expect Steve to be sarcastic or dry, and it comes from his throat and it sounds like a bark, like even he wasn’t expecting to make it.
“You can and you will,” she says, “because your guilt complex is a mile wide.” Sharon smiles slightly. The Hydra Supreme would never have let them say something so carelessly cruel. It feels like she’s hit him, but also like cool water poured over Tony’s skin.
“It’s not your fault,” Steve said, disassembling the armor pieces around Tony’s bicep, trying to get a better look at the cut. “You can’t control my happiness, that’s something on me, not you.”
It feels true. The rest of breakfast is full of laughter and stories Steve has never heard about some of Tony and Rhodey’s more off the record exploits. Steve hasn’t laughed this hard since the night Dum Dum Dugan got so drunk he shit in his own boot, forgot about it, and then put it on the next morning. Good times.
Steve knows Tony.  Or he thought he did.  This feels unprecedented.  The confusion must show on Steve’s face because Tony gives him a small, self-deprecating smile.
This isn’t exactly a conversation he wants to have at stupid o’clock in the morning. Howard’s reaction had been complicated, as most things involving Howard were.
Steve had already dealt with one too many sex tapes for his liking so anything more than a brief kiss was a no.
Steve received on the helicarrier.  But Tony knows he might as well be punching the wind.  Steve’s got that backed-into-a-corner look in his eye and nothing good will come from a confrontation. Not when he’s like this.
Steve leaves to go fetch a glass of water from the kitchen.  When he returns, Tony’s awake.  He hasn’t moved and he’s taking in the room looking confused, moving his head as little as possible.
Natasha and Clint flip over their placemats and they’re off.  Bruce and Steve talk about a new stroganoff recipe and about a science documentary they’ve been watching on Sunday nights until the food shows up.
Steve’s teasing has the desired effect and Tony laughs as he finally swats at Steve a little harder and then after a few seconds gives up and wiggles down the bed to get away from the pillow.
The guard doesn’t look impressed, but he does seem a little less skeptical about the odds of this working.  He types something, waits, types something else and then nods toward an elevator that has opened from the blank wall behind him.
“She was.  And so was Mr. Jarvis.  It’s funny.  I always called Ana by her first name, but I called Jarvis by his last.  They never corrected me.”
Bruce has a few medical supplies with him, hidden away in a corner with his second bag, and he walks over to dig through it, pulling out anything that looks remotely useful. When he realizes it’s more than an armful, he starts to shove it all back in.
a better time and place for this discussion and that time and place does not involve him holding a bucket of somewhat volatile chemicals.
“No, because he’d be playing AC/DC and making it work over your school’s PA system. Do not trust this man. He’s a menace.”
“Careful,” Clint groans to Bruce. The wind is knocked out of him so it’s little more than a hoarse whisper. “Survival instincts. Bad.”
“Steven,” Nanna scolded, but she was clearly teasing.  “What did I tell you about setting a good example?”
It’s the one excuse Tony can’t argue with. Rhodey doesn’t get to see his daughter enough as it. He really isn’t going to try and get in the way of that.
it was Bucky.  Nobody but him could ever make callin’ me ‘Captain America’ sound so much like an insult.  'Least till I met you.”
Steve must be thinking the same thing, because he backs them up against the mattress and they topple down on top of it.  The wooden floor under the bed creaks with a loud groan that no doubt reaches downstairs.  They both go perfectly still, wondering if they’ve been caught.
Steve looks at him with apology in his eyes.  “So you understand why I’ve got to do this? Why it has to be me?”
Now that they have an audience, Tony seems more confident.  His public mask is back in place so he sounds like himself again.  Steve knows he’s the one who looks sad.  He’s not good at this like Tony is.  His Captain America persona can shield him from a lot, but it can’t mask the pain of watching yet another friend head off into a battle where Steve can’t follow.
All he ever draws is the past, and it intensifies the loneliness he feels, even after a year.  It’s better not to think about.  Better to distract himself with the screen.
“As soon as any of these assholes go looking for you they’re gonna figure out you aren’t home,” Clint continues. “They’ll hack security cameras and the traffic light feeds. They’ll talk to the taxi drivers. They’re gonna know you’re at Steve’s before long.”
“You think I’d put Iron-Eggsy in a nest prototype?” Tony asks.  “I’ve given myself enough concussions from suit testing to know better.  I'd have to be egg-stremely irresponsible to risk it.”
“What’s the right word?” Steve presses.  He keeps his voice even, trying hard not to be defensive about this.  Just because it isn’t his fault doesn’t mean it’s not valid.
“You are not your father, if that's what you're worried about,” Steve says.  “Just look how you take care of the team.  If and when this is a conversation you want to have... I can’t say I haven’t given it some thought, too.”
You just don’t want to admit you lost, Rogers. Should have known you’d be a sore loser after all that whining.
“I’m not going to disagree with you,” Bruce says. “But Clint brings up a good point. Would you consider letting me call Steve to tell him you’re with us and ask him to back off until you’re ready to see him? Then he’ll have no reason to keep running into trouble.  It’s up to you. It’s not your job or responsibility to protect him.  I just think it might give you and him
He’d taken every ounce of his anger at Howard and he’d put it into his game. Scored three goals. The whole arena was electrified. Tony’d never felt so fucking alone.
“I’m sure she did,” Bruce confirms. “And as soon as the swelling is down we’ll get you fixed up-- we’re going to have your wrist back to new. We can do that.”
James speaks in the disinterested tone of someone who is worried that showing too much interest in any given thing is sure to mean it will be taken away. Bruce has been there.  He gets it.
Steve doesn’t pull away until Tony’s almost breathless and then it’s only to whisper one word.  “Deal.”
The atmosphere in the studio is like one big USO rally.  A whole party devoted to dehumanizing  Tony Stark.  There’s so much enthusiasm for this train wreck that the hosts have to wait a moment for the noise to die down.
“People make mistakes.  In your case, you’ve made some big ones.  It doesn’t mean it always has to be that way.”
Steve reaches for the paper and Tony puts his hand on top of it, pinning it to the table.  “Leave it,” Tony says.  “I’ll get it back to Professor Armand.”
“I don’t want to make promises I can’t keep, but if you’re tolerating StarkBars, I don’t think it will take long to build up to other things. It’s probably not a permanent malfunction.  We can work on it together, if you’re interested. ”
Clint scrambles out of the car, as Natasha fixes Tony with a look that dares him to try and then climbs out with steady grace.
“Not a problem,” Tony says, his voice carefree and just-this-side of flirtatious.  It breaks the tension. “Just do something impressive today.  Blow up something awesome.  Make it worth my time.”
It’s their first charity event since Tony’s return. The only reason they are here is because it honors the last World War II veterans, and there are so few of them left now, Steve doesn’t want to miss. He isn’t sure how many of them will be left when next year rolls around.
“Not up here he’s not,” Clint warns. “Whether he’s got two working arms or one working arm, we are all kinds of fucked if he’s awake.”
“I have found somewhere that meets your requirements.  I’m sending you the information now,” Jarvis says.
"By definition, yes," JARVIS says.  "Agent Romanoff consulted with Sir before her departure, and he left his bed immediately.  He is currently in the kitchen staring at his coffee, in what is a convincing mimic of wakefulness.  I am unconvinced."
“You’ve got quite the group of Superfriends,” Tony says.  “Not what I expected out of the delinquents on the 7th floor.”
Clint looks torn and then sighs. “Fine. You’re coming out on YouTube. Do you need help setting up a channel? My friend Kate’s good at that kind of thing.”
“I don’t mind at all,” Steve confirms once they're outside.  “Thanks.  For everything, by the way.  The last few days, especially.  I was in a bad place.  Guess you must have noticed.”
Once they’re on board the plane, Steve lays Tony on the cushy cabin sofa and tucks a blanket around him.  He finds a trash can and places it on the floor in front of Tony in case he wakes up and gets sick, and then Steve just ends up sitting down next to it on the carpet, because he’s not sure what else to do with himself.
Steve’s bacon-cheeseburger and fries are exactly what he wants. The large Iron Man milkshake makes him feel a little blue, though. Mae must notice because she gives it a nudge toward him.
Steve sees Tony a few times a month after that.  Never for any logical reason, never with any warning, and generally announced by the most obnoxiously loud rock music Tony can make happen.  Once he even hijacks the speakers of Steve’s SHIELD-issued phone during a major debriefing to make his entrance.
It did seem like a prank that could be played.  Ditch Captain America.  Tony and Bruce laughing their way down the elevator.
“Thank you,” Bruce says, and sounds relieved. “I know he’s going to ask-- are you interested in meeting him at some point?”
“JARVIS could broadcast a message,” Tony says.  “Something... I dunno... old-timey.  Something he might notice.”
“I’ve got a visual on Barton,” Tony says, through the comm. “Get Romanov out of there. I’ll meet you at the hospital. SHIELD’s 2 minutes out. They’ll clean up the mess.”
Tony is ready to grasp at anything that will make Bruce stop sounding so fucking sad and this one word gives him his ammo.
“I don’t get how you’re not puking from the pain,” Bruce says.  Clint’s wrist is deep purple and swollen and Bruce can no longer make out the shape of the bone he thought he noticed earlier because everything is way too swollen for that now.  “Sam, could you bring up the holo-baton?  I’m not going to see much of anything without it.”
.  Tony's pretty sure Bruce isn't trying to build a Birdkilling Bomb, but Bruce's handwriting is so bad, that's the best Tony can make out.  He needs to poke at this.  He needs to find Bruce.
The table goes silent.  Hell, half the room goes silent.  Clint stands as well, looking plenty ready to have Steve’s back, just like any Howling Commando would.
“I want to put your wrist in a splint. If you’ll keep it in a sling the swelling will go down more quickly and then you can either get help from a real doctor or I’ll fix you up.”
Steve considers it. That’s what he wanted. Or-- well, he’s not sure what he’d wanted before. It’s what he wants now.
“Must be nice to have a supersoldier metabolism,” Tony grumbles under his breath as Steve beings unwrapping breakfast.
Bruce feels all the tiny hairs on the back of his neck prickle.  Logic keeps him in control. James isn’t upset and he isn’t aiming his guns anywhere. Honestly, he doesn’t seem nearly as alarmed by the distant intruder as he does by the cutesy-wootsy house.  Bruce can at least take a breath.
“That’s bullshit,” Steve protests. “Completely unfair. What about second chances? What about forgiveness?”
I can scan him again but the wires are all fixed in place.  I’m pretty sure what you’re looking at is an exact match for the first scans I took in Switzerland.
“You don’t need to babysit me, Steve,” Tony says. “Go. Mingle. I’m going to sit with Rhodey and Pepper, drink my water and watch my trophy boyfriend do his thing. I’ll be fine.”
Steve shakes his head. “It doesn’t bother me. I know I’m good and I know Bucky is better. People expect me to be jealous but it’s never bothered me.”
“JARVIS? Do me a favor. All that data that Romanoff dumped-- see if there’s anything that mentions me. Actually-- scratch that. I know enough about myself to last me a lifetime. See what HYDRA had on dad, will you? And go straight to the Restricted Section. I only wanna read what I was never meant to see.”
Steve chuckles though there’s an unmistakeable touch of sadness in it.  “I guess that’s a silver lining, yeah.”
Steve feels a pang in his chest.  His own mother was a saint.  They hadn’t had much but he’d never doubted once that he was loved, safe and wanted.
Steve’s smiling again, and no doubt still looking at Tony like he’s made of something sweet. He can’t help it.
“That’s not how I saw it at the time,” Tony says. “I believe you now. I know... I know how protective you are.”
“The vultures will be gone by now,” Tony says at the same time Steve blurts out “I’m sorry about that interview!”
“I was never really into that stuff. It just took my mind off things I didn’t want to think about. Made me numb. Gave me an outlet for the punishment I thought I deserved. I’m not even sure if I’m any good at... I mean, Shayla said--”
Steve sputters a laugh as Tony derails his spiraling depression with his ridiculous sense of humor. Tony may never realize how much of a comfort he is to Steve, but this is why Steve sees them as equals. This is why Steve needs him so badly.
Tony gets it, he does.  Steve doesn’t want to be alone.  For that matter, neither does Tony.  He’s got a lot on his mind and if he lets his brain do its own thing, that’s just asking for a panic attack or nightmares or insomnia.  This is better.  Company is good. They both deserve a break.  And Tony’s not sure when’s the last time he’s eaten anything that’s not yellow and shaped like a sponge.
Tony nods.  “He’s the son of a competitor.  He got himself into some trouble and then his parents disowned him and I recognized his name in the paper.  I know a little something about how that feels.  Went to check on him.  Offered to pay for his rehab.  I was stupid to think we wouldn’t get caught together.”
Which causes Bruce to groan and practically trip over himself in his hurry to apologize and assure James that isn’t what he means. Which gets the first real laugh out of James for the afternoon.
“While I’m standing on an exercise ball,” Clint says. “I learned to do it when I was twelve and no one ever appreciated it.”
“You aren’t perfect,” Tony points out.  “If you were, you’d be a lot less interesting.  But come on-- now I want to hear your USO hand job stories that had nothing to do with the chorus girls.  Who was it?  The guy who played Hitler?  Some townie from Podunk, PA? You’ve got to spill or I’m gonna fill in all my own blanks.”
“Rhodey’s crap on ice,” Tony says simply. “Jenny’s got potential though. Sounds like I’ll be back on the team in a few days, but I’d already decided if I was out for the rest of the season I was going to see about coaching her team. Don’t know if anyone wants to let me around kids but I think she’d have liked it.”
“Tony Stark is not on trial here,” Steve says.  “We agreed to answer your questions about recent events as a courtesy.  If we’d known the only reason you asked us here was to rake our teammate over the coals, we’d have told you where you could shove your invitation.”
“It’s the best,” Steve agrees sarcastically.  Or well, it’s meant to be sarcasm though it comes out absurdly sincere.
Thanks to Tony’s habit of improving tech every time he can’t sleep at night, it’s easy to get the stretcher unlatched from the medbed and then to hover it down the Quinjet ramp. They’d all agreed that James had the best chance of not freaking out if he woke up outside, so they parked him in the shade of a tree not far from the back porch.
His brain isn’t going to let a ‘blame Tony’ moment go unchecked.  Blame Tony seems to be the default for SHIELD, even though Tony’s been gone for 6 damn months.
return if he asked. Seems pointless to test it out when right now Bruce’s text company is the only thing keeping Tony afloat and it’s a hell of a lot better than nothing.
“Fuck Shayla,” Steve growls. “She wanted her 15 minutes of fame and she got it. I never believed one word of her bullshit.”
Bruce rolls his eyes.  Clint knows damn well that Tony isn't his boyfriend and their friendship has no romantic basis. "Science boyfriends" just seems to be a thing Clint and Natasha like to toss around when Bruce and Tony have been cooped up in a lab together for a couple days and both walk out with rumpled clothes and mussed up hair.
Bruce laughs. Clint is scary good at knowing exactly the right thing to say to ease Bruce’s quickly multiplying self-doubt spirals.
“Fine,” Tony sighs.  “I’m not sure if I’m more irritated someone wants me dead or that this has turned into the ultimate cockblock situation, but whatever.  Let’s find this fucker so we can get on with our lives.”
Bucky reaches under the tattered carpet at the rear of the van, gives something Tony can’t see a hard yank, and a false floor pulls out.  Not only had they been riding with a frankly terrifying assortment of flammables, they were riding on top of a goddamn armory.
“Exactly like that.”  He pauses, and then picks up another bagel.  “I’m gonna eat this in the elevator, shower fast and then meet you back up here.  You’re really okay to leave?  I know you’ve got a lot--”
Tony lifts his phone, smiles for the camera and gives a thumbs up to text over to Bruce, along with an address.  It’s not a real smile, but Tony’s so good at faking happy mischief Bruce will never know.
“You thought the two tight-lip-super-spies and the man with the big, green secret were going to out you?  Bad plan, Rogers.”
He’s quiet as he walks out of the bathroom.  Steve strips, showers as quickly as he can, and steps out of the water to find Tony’s laid out pajamas for him.  Steve dresses and walks to the bedroom to find Tony in bed.  Steve slides under the sheets and scoots closer, wrapping an arm around Tony’s wait to drag him back toward him.  Tony’s entirely pliant.
It surprises Steve when Tony drops the bag to the floor, closes the space between them and pulls Steve into a tight hug.  Tony’s fingers wind into Steve’s shirt so they’re tucked together tightly.  He rests his forehead against Steve’s shoulder, keeping his face hidden, and he stays there, holding on to Steve like he has no intention of letting him go. Steve hugs Tony in return.  He buries his face in Tony’s hair and breathes him in.  Tries to memorize the way he feels in his arms.  It’s what he would have done with Bucky before they’d swung onto that train, if he’d known it was time to say goodbye.
He’s so angry, Steve wishes he knew what he'd done to earn this ire.  This isn’t the petulant upset of a billionaire playboy who’s used to getting his way.  Whatever’s eating Tony is deeper than that.  Darker.  Steve recognizes something in Tony’s eyes he’d seen plenty of in the war.
Tony nods.  “I really do.  Now come on, Captain Lazy.  Unless you’re a fan of sleeping on the floor we need to get started on the bed.  J?  You get permission from Clint or Nat yet?”
Rhodey strapped to a chair.  Tony smells the blood and the electricity.  The tang of a car battery and burning skin.
“Let’s start with your knee, if that’s okay?” Bruce asks from across the barn. He glances over his shoulder and James nods.
Good Morning New York is his favorite.  They’ve tried to book him a few times but he’s politely declined.  It’s nice to sit back and watch and just... not.  The publicity tours are just about the only thing about his old life he doesn’t miss.
It’s a tense minute. Still, Tony works fast and James holds still, and as soon as the scan is complete Tony steps back several feet and swings the scanner away with him.
“You’re sayin’ you’re treating me like a friend,” James says. There is so much skepticism in his voice it sounds accusatory.
Under the cracked table, a flicker of movement catches Tony’s eyes.  Clint’s fingerspelling two letters over and over. O and K?
“It’s for my sort-of-niece. Rhodey’s kid, Jenny. She calls me Uncle Tony like I’m something important to her and she’s a big fan of Barnes. His biggest fan, maybe.”
“Incapacitating cartridge emitting rail-gun,” Natasha explains. “I know the kid who designed it. He’s good people. Whatever we gave James is safe.”
“Very mature,” Steve muses. “And sure. Why not? We can make it an Avengers channel. Everyone can take a turn.”
“Let Tony go check,” Bucky counters.  “You and me have to make a trip to the store for the rest of what we’re gonna need for Nanna and Kate’s uniforms.”
“You should probably make yourself comfortable,” Rhodes adds.  “And call me Rhodey.  Looks like you’re in it for the long haul.”
“You’d be a great coach. The whole time we were playing just now, some of those comments you were making were kind of helpful. I know I shift my weight too much on slapshots. Coaches told me that for years before I moved to the goal. But none of them ever had much advice on how to fix it, except to tell me to stop. What you said about my hips... I don’t know. It felt better, even if we were only messing around.”
“I get it,” Tony says.  “I’m the wild card, here.  And for the record, I’m with you on Steve’s trust issues.  Shoot me once, shame on you.  Shoot me six times...”
“Yeah. Yes, everything is fine,” Bruce confirms. “Better than fine maybe. Ummm. I guess there’s no non-dramatic way to put this, so I’m just going to say it. I’m here with Clint and James. The James Barnes you’re looking for.”
“It’s great,” Bruce says. This awkwardness is the part where he fails at friendship. “Exactly what I needed.”
The kids get off on the fourth floor, with smiles and waves.  When the door closes, all Tony’s cheer vanishes with them.  Tony leans back against the wall of the elevator and closes his eyes. He looks bone-tired.  World weary.
“I can’t imagine what that must be like,” Tony says. “I never felt like I could be anything but the best. Howard drilled it into my head: If you’re not first, you’re last. Didn’t make me popular but it did make me good.”
“Wooooooooah baby,” Mae greets when she sees him.  She stops wiping down the counter to admire Steve. “You going on a hot date or something?”
If you follow me I always refollow and I may post more random backstories from this universe there, since I also have some Bucky/Clint stuff I've never used!
“What’s not to enjoy?” Tony asks.  He’s smiling an awful, fake smile, that makes Steve’s chest hurt.  “Bondage is great.  Don’t knock it till you try it.”
“If you’re done with the Who’s Going To Kill Us All First Game, I’m awake, and I’ll keep watch if Bruce wants to go get some sleep or a shower or something.”
It turns out the stocks are from the year Stark Industries was founded and they are worth a whole lot of money.  More money than all of Steve’s back pay combined.  More money than Steve’s conceivable pay in the near future unless he lives for a couple hundred years.  It feels wrong to take that much.  Undeserved.
“I’ll ask,” Bruce says. “I won’t do a medical procedure without his permission.  That includes scans.”
He’s absolutely not pacing. Or checking his phone what feels like every two minutes to see only 10 seconds have passed. And he doesn’t jump at the sound of the doorbell and force himself to wait a few beats before walking in that direction.
Jarvis assists with the calculations to keep the stretcher level as Bruce floats it up the steps. Clint leads the way, and they walk through a kitchen and a living room, then down a short hall to a bedroom on the ground floor. When Bruce steps in, he can tell that either Jarvis or Tony had walked Natasha and Sam through how to set up the room because all the monitors are where he’d expect them, and everything he might need from the jet is plugged in and turned on.
Once Tony’s standing on the sidewalk, Clint dusts him off with a series of sweeping thwacks up and down his chest and legs until Tony’s forced to shove him away.
Steve could carry him easily, but he’s never been in Tony’s room and it’s probably rude to scoop someone up in your arms and put them to bed after they’re past the age of ten.  At least without some kind of prior consent.
It’s - it’s too much. Too much from Tony, the most handsome person he’s ever met, currently riding the high of orgasm and saying nice things about Steve just because he helped get him off. Steve sighs and leans his forehead against Tony’s bare thigh.
“Well,” Tony begins, leaning forward towards Steve and grinning fiercely. “Me and Angie were what you might call adventurous. We had been drinking and flirting the night away, during one of those endless galas, and we were both very bored, as you can imagine. She was there representing her father’s company - she’s their head of marketing - and I didn’t know anyone there besides her and Janet.”
“Then what is it, Steve?” Tony asks, his voice pleading. “I just want to make you happy. I just want to give you something.”
“I would stay near you even if you were covered in battery acid,” Steve murmured, probably too soft for Tony to hear.
Iron Man shakes his head and lets out a breathy laugh. “Don’t worry, Cap, that definitely won’t be an issue.”
And Tony is making the most erotic noises. Steve’s not sure if Tony even can tell him to speed up, but even that initial rhythm is enough to pull Tony to pieces. Not even thirty seconds later, Tony is coming, spraying his cummerbund, jacket, shirt, and even a few drops on his bowtie.
They maintain an easy patter from there, talking idly about each other. It feels… Steve wants to say comfortable, but the truth is that it feels
“Of course, yeah. Should I change?” Steve asks, looking down at his uniform. “Guess that’s a silly question, don’t really want to go out as Cap, huh? I’ll be - I’ll be right back.”
Tony’s gaze darts around the room, he laughs breathily, and then swallows. “I don’t - I mean, ah, maybe?” He tries to smile, but it’s very small and fragile. It’s kind of amazing that stammering, nervous Tony Stark is somehow just as beautiful as composed, smiling for the camera Tony Stark.
“I was afraid that my feelings would get in the way, or hurt you, or lead to more fights where I said all of the wrong things and made you feel less than you were. Are. I… I didn’t - I
Steve asks Jan several times if Mr. Stark is a model. He’s sure the man must be. Jan explained the concept to him when she told him about what she did outside the Avengers, and he’s convinced Mr. Stark could make anything he wears look like it’s a million bucks.
If Sharon weren’t here, Tony isn’t sure that he would be strong enough not to enjoy it. That he wouldn’t succumb to the illusion just for the sake of being able to have
“You took him off the painkillers?” the woman asks, voice full of concern. Her tone is clipped, like she’s holding herself back. Tony usually associates that tone with people being pissed at him but not wanting to say it outright, but most of the women in his life don’t struggle to communicate their anger with him. Who is this person?
Jarvis had been the one to track down this particular therapist.  He had his doctorate (which Jarvis felt might keep Tony from railroading the guy) and he was known for working with ex-child stars and professional athletes.  Apparently there wasn’t much he hadn’t seen before.  That would probably come in handy.
Steve shakes his head and laughs, but does open the back.  Inside there are four massive crates.  He lifts them out one by one.  Each is labeled with one of their names.
“M’not your date, bro. And I’ve got Jenny for the weekend. I’m picking her up as soon as I get you out the door.”
"Walk me through how to get from here to there," Tony says.  "And write up an office transfer for me.  See if we can fit him somewhere up here."
“You can pick it up,” Tony says. “I was pretty rough on some of this stuff when I was a kid. It was only when I got a little older that I understood how much it was worth.”
“You aren’t useless,” Natasha says.  “Someone needs to keep an eye on Tony.  Someone needs to keep an eye on you.  You two can watch each other, then no eyes are wasted.”
“He talked about you a lot,” she says. “I know it’s not any of my business but I’m wondering.... hoping... is this more than friendship for you?”
Clint takes the post-it and raises it, waiting for Tony to give him a slight nod before pressing it to Tony’s chest.
Bruce lets out a slight laugh, because Clint’s right: James is going to fit in great if he ever joins the club.
“I was the kind of needy kid who was always getting in the way.  It’s probably my fault he couldn’t--”
“The short story is that he cheated on me,” Pepper says, in her business voice.  She’s sitting up straight and Steve can tell how hurt she is, even now, by what Tony had done.
“That’s our cue,” Steve says.  “We should have plenty of time to get down the hill on one of the side roads before they get this far.”
James listens and gets that look in his eyes that he gets when he’s trying to reconcile what he’s being told with his own experiences. He stretches out his knee again a few more times, and stares at it so hard, it’s almost like he’s trying to pin it to the floor.
“Let me buy you a milkshake,” Clint says, reaching down to pull at Steve’s arm in an effort to get him off the ground.  “There’s a place down the street that named one after you.  They put a whole piece of apple pie down in the blender with the ice cream.  It’s awesome”
“Thank you,” Steve says appreciatively.  “I want to talk to Clint and Natasha, too.  I think they’ll understand, but if they don’t, I don’t want them blaming you.  This isn’t about me trying to get him back on the team.  I just want him to have his milkshake.  That’s all.”
That seems to catch Steve by surprise. “Me and Buck and Clint stay late some nights after practice,” Steve explains. “We goof off. Act like idiots. Reminds me of all the pick-up games I played as a kid.”
Now they’ve got new problems. They’d had to cut and snip and rearrange enough wires that James’s metal arm will be useless to him. JARVIS had brought Tony in for a consult at one point, and once the correct wires were cut, he hopped off comms to go get started on a fix. Whether that fix would be to mend what was already attached to James or to create something new had yet to be seen. Hopefully it will be James’s decision eventually, and Bruce prays the man will forgive him for disabling him in order to save his life.
Then promptly rolls over the egg, splattering what’s left of it and tracking it across the floor of the lab in a gruesome blur of yolk and white.
“Depends on what I’ve been doing in bed,” Steve says.  His tone is pure innocence, but his smirk gives him away and Tony’s mouth drops open slightly.
Steve bites at the bottom of his lip and looks up at Tony with as much affection and lust as he can manage.  His hand goes to Tony’s pajama bottoms and he ghosts his fingers around where the waistband meets his skin and then he gives them a rough tug.
Half the bar turns to look at them, and Clint flings himself over the table, leaving Bucky struggling to hold on to Clint’s leg to keep him from crashing face first into the ground.  Tony laughs so hard his side aches, and then as soon as he catches his breath, Kate does a dramatic re-enactment of Clint’s antics and they’re all laughing again.
“In that case,” Tony says with a smile that definitely means trouble, “I think we better take this outside.”
JARVIS pipes in then, with new instructions for saving James and Bruce loses track of everything else after that. He can hear Clint and Nat talking, and then Tony and Steve as well, but words aren’t registering. For Bruce there’s really nothing other than JARVIS’s efficient instructions, Sam’s quiet reassurances, and a whole lot of blood.
“You are such a baby,” she calls back.  “But fine.  Get over here.  I guess now that you’re mostly clean we can share.”
“Are we done here?” Tony asks, glancing up at Steve with all the petulance and irritation of the young teen he was when he’d written the damn thing.  He even crosses his arms.
Not that he hasn’t spent long, long nights in ice rinks before, but he’s lost his privileges to his home ice for now and nothing else is going to be open.
“You do realize it’s going to be my ringtone from now on, right?” Tony asks.  “That’s what you’re getting into with this.  With... me.”
It happens while Nat, Clint and Steve are on a mission with Rumlow and his STRIKE team.  Everything goes fine until they realize their intel’s bad and they’re about 140 miles from where they ought to be.  They can’t get from one place to the other in time and the mission is called off.
It’s calming.  Peaceful.  It makes Steve realize how much he could use some sleep, too.  He just needs to recycle first, take a quick shower, and then hope like hell he can pass out on his pillow before the guilt of the day catches up with him.
Which makes sense.  Of course Howard would have collected his stuff.  That was Howard.  And it makes sense Stark Industries would loan it out.  The hurt he feels, that no one-- well, Tony in this case-- would think that maybe he’d want his stuff back is unreasonable.  It doesn’t belong to him now.
“I wanted to,” Steve says.  “I mean... I figure as long as you’ll have me, this stuff is all kind of my responsibility, too, right?  I should help where I can.”
“I do,” Bruce confirms. “I absolutely do. James, when you defied your orders, maybe it was a malfunction or maybe it was the fundamental
Nevermind that the von Trapps didn’t climb any mountains en masse, as far as Bruce knows, and they most definitely took a train to Italy when they left Austria. His escape isn’t defined by its historical accuracy.
Apparently the only thing that can make Free Fry Friday more awesome than it already is, is the prospect of 12.5 shots per person from the top shelf of the bar. Tony can’t stop laughing as he watches Clint and Kate bounce up and down like excited rabbits for the whole six blocks to Lido’s.
He stops the stretcher next to mattress. The monitors begin to ping James’s accelerated heart rate and elevated respiration. James’s eyes open at the noise and his working hand grips the handle of the knife more tightly.
“Keep letting Bruce and Clint handle things and pray to whatever god is listening that they can pull off a miracle.”
“Did you catch that interview with Stark’s ex?” he asks after they place their order.  “It was brutal.”
James’s eyes widen slightly and he doesn’t say anything in protest but Bruce can feel the force of words that aren’t there. James’s face is a study in controlled misery and he takes in sharps breath as he goes still.
“I’ll see about getting something to scan you, where we’re going,” Bruce says. “There isn’t much I’m going to be able to do now. I can splint it to keep it straight. I’m just not sure how much that would help.” Bruce scratches behind his ear, wishing he could do more. “I’m going to touch you again to roll your jeans back down.”
“The man you’re talking about-- the man you’re so eager to rip apart-- I’ve never met that man,” Steve continues.  “I was on ice when he was kidnapped.  The Tony Stark I know is the man who returned.  The one who shut down a profitable company-- his family legacy-- and has risked his life time and time again to fix his past mistakes.”
“Not that it really has much affect on me at all, but I’m glad for you,” Bruce says.  “And technically you’re well past retirement age.”
“Might be shorthand notes to himself,” Sam says.  “We’ve already asked JARVIS to see if he can make heads or tails of it.”
“Bucky was such a shit,” Steve says.  “And just the best-- the best friend I could have ever asked for.  And on the phone just now, that wasn’t some guy named James talking, it was Bucky. I
“Disappointing,” Tony says.  “Follow up question. JARVIS can you be sure to save the audio of this and make Steve saying ‘handjob’ over and over his ringtone please?”
“I don’t know when it got so long,” James says quietly.  He lets out his usual huff of frustration when expressing himself takes effort. “I don’t remember.  I don’t like it.  I
Tony’s eyes light up with perfect mischief and his mouth forms an amazed oooo.  Steve doesn’t mind going to hell for a lie, if this is the reaction it gets.
“See how delicately they’ve shaded her face?” Steve asks.  “And how that contrasts with the strength in her pose and in her build?  It’s perfect.”
So if Tony opens his home to Bucky, or acts with the rest of the Avengers to keep Bucky safe-- that’s not without sacrifice.
Not wanting to play hockey anymore is the worst of all, but he doesn’t. Not because of the loss. Not because of this game. Not because of anything revolving around the championship. This isn’t what Tony wants. And it’s hard to say goodbye this way.
His voice is solemn, and his eyes are sad, and it’s so unfair.  Tearing the bunk bed into pieces, and then cobbling those pieces together into a king size bed had been the happiest Tony had seen Steve in months.  They’d laughed so hard Tony’s side still hurt, and now Steve looks like the wolves of time have eaten his every last dream.
Loud enough that people skirt around them and Steve just shakes his head and smiles again because there’s a definite part of him that wishes he could swear publicly like that. Sure, he swears in his head and in private just fine, but his mum raised him for polite company. Old habits die hard.
Tony sounds insistent. Steve’s mostly stuck on the part where this might be the first time he’s ever heard Tony use his given name.
“That’s the plan,” Steve says. “I won’t go on a talk show. I had Jarvis look. He couldn’t find a single one that didn’t badmouth at least one of us. So I’m doing this on my own terms.”
Tony’s fingers fly over his keyboard.  JARVIS helps, of course, and Tony finds Bruce the best house within the location parameters, and he’s careful not to choose anything so over the top that Bruce will regret ever making the request.
Steve kicks off his shoes and then follows Tony into the kitchen. Tony pulls down two mugs and starts up the fancy little machine.
“Whoever isn’t on bait duty,” Clint says.  “We can use a distraction to draw out some of that security.  Give whoever goes in a better chance of going unnoticed.”
Reading about himself is mistake. He thought he could handle this one. Sam had texted and said it wasn’t that bad. He was wrong.
When Bruce opens the door, Clint is standing there with his hands up in surrender and a nervous grin.
“I’m Clinton Francis Barton, I’m 31 years old, and  I like long walks on the beach, archery practice, and giving the best blow jobs in the city.  My perfect man would be--”
Which is apparently a signal because Clint, and Natasha and Bruce and Pepper and Rhodey all stream in from the kitchen.  There ware party hats.  Roses.  Cheering.  Seven people cram into a booth made for four.  And maybe most surprising, Pepper and Rhodey climb in to join Steve’s side, and Nat and Bruce join Tony.  Not surprising anyone at all, Clint attempts to sit on the table.
Tony doesn’t have the benefit of super hearing so he’s got no clue what was going on in there.  Yeah, he could’ve asked J, but now that he and Steve are kind of a thing it makes being a creeper seem a lot more wrong than before, so he’s just got to pace around and wait it out.
!  I always follow back and tend to post a lot of Tony, Steve, Sam and Bucky love in all sorts of random combinations.  OH!  And Clint.  So much Clint. <3
“Bruce, just stay there for a sec,” Clint groans as he lifts himself up off the ground. He’s cradling his arm against his chest. “You got this?”
Natasha is there, carrying two glasses of water and a bottle of tylenol that she has tucked under her arm. She’s wearing purple pajamas spotted with little pink bullseyes.
needy.  It’s sad.  He’s only fun when he’s drunk and-- that-- that gets us back to where we started with the...”  The woman holds up her finger again and lets it droop down slowly.  She’s giggling so hard she can barely stay in her chair.
Tony can’t tell if this kid is hitting on him, or just being a brat, but it’s refreshing.  Bruce and Pepper are the only two people in the building who ever treat him like a real person.
The overhead lights flicker as Tony and Steve walk down the stairs.  Tony can see why right away, when Steve leads him into the dining room and Clint and Bucky are seated at a dining room table that’s been turned into a makeshift security command center.  They’ve got mangled together tech all around them.  Half of it looks like stuff that would have been ancient ten years previous, and some of it Tony thinks ought to be in the Smithsonian.  There are three laptops held together with bread ties, shoelaces and duct tape.  There’s a giant satellite phone, and what might be an ultra old-school global positioning system.  All the devices are plugged into the same two outlets.  Those outlets are humming ominously.  Occasionally there’s a spark.
“All correct,” Bruce says, feeling a lot more calm. He has an idea about what’s going on but wants to confirm it a little before he discusses it with James. “May I touch between your knee and ankle?”
They all calm considerably once it’s clear from the notes the surgeons are inputting that Clint’s going to be fine.  Natasha, too.
“Why don’t you take some time and find out?” Tony asks.  He abandons all pretense of making sandwiches, to step around the counter and rest his hands on Steve’s hips.  “I can keep you financially secure and I am
“What?” Bruce asks. “No. No, I didn’t know Clint was anywhere around here. Do you mind if I call him?”
“Or two-- you and I get Barton’s permission to dismantle this thing, we grab some tools from the Quinjet, and then we Frankenstein ourselves a new frame.  Or I could make separate beds. Obviously. Two beds, separated I mean. I wasn’t trying to assume.  And anything I do will be better than these bunks...”
The next twenty seconds are agonizingly long. When he got to Nat, she’s bloody all over. Dead bodies litter the ground around her. She’s too weak to stand.
Bruce says it so sharply that Clint chokes on a laugh. “I see how it is, doc. Wait till I can’t shoot my bow and
James’s eyes blink open. He stares up at the leaves and though he stays very still, his whole body tenses. The heart monitor alarms go off as his pulse begins to race.
Tony crumples up the slip of homework paper and tosses it into the trash can by the door.  He makes the shot perfectly.  Steve smiles.
“So I’ve heard. Maybe next time we do this while you’re asleep,” Tony suggests. “Small talk has changed in the last 70 years. Let’s keep it to the weather, Mr. Van Winkle.”
Bruce grows hungry around noon, right after they’ve done a full body scan of Clint, and suggests they take a break for lunch. James hesitates to agree. He doesn’t outright say no, of course. He just looks unhappy and frustrated and opens and closes his mouth a few times wordlessly.
“Here’s where we’re stuck,” Bucky says.  “Looks like Stane’s involved.  Looks like Hammer Industries is involved.  But the machine that sent the message to the murder posse is locked down now.  If we want any proof, someone is going to have to go to their server farm and do a manual download.”
Steve pauses, takes that in, and then nods.  “You know what you’re risking.  If you’re in, you need to be armed.  Then we’ll all make a run for it together.”
“You’re right. You don’t have far to go,” Bruce insists. “Are you even wearing your pads out on the ice at this point?”
“You sure there’s not something good hidden up high somewhere?” Steve asks, with the hint of a smirk on his face.  “You might have missed it.”
“I’m hanging up now,” Bruce says, chuckling at Clint’s observations. “Do me a favor: keep where I am and who I’m with under wraps until we can talk about it all of us together.”
Tony shrugs. “It’s better than some stupid fundraiser where some asshole reporter is going to ask me about my new DWI.”
Maybe Howard had gotten his head in the wrong place and ended up valuing collectables more than he valued time with Tony; Steve won’t make that same mistake.
“I’m not going to transfer you to the bed just yet,” Bruce says. “I’m not sure I can do it without causing more damage, so you’re stuck on this thing until I’ve got that figured out. Is that okay?”
“It’s a relief to know he doesn’t hate me,” Steve admits.  “At least I don’t think he hates me anymore.  With him it’s hard to tell.”
“Hey Clint, what do you get when you put a translator and a genius together in the back of a cab?” Kate asks.
Bruce is 100 percent certain that if he texts Tony with a few parameters, he’ll have them a place before Bruce can finish packing his things. He’s usually shy about accepting Tony’s generosity, but desperate times, and all that.
Tony hops down off the counter and puts down the Starkpad, finally meeting Steve’s eyes.  “C’mon, it’s all back here.”
There are times when Tony talks to Bruce in the field where every other word flies right over Steve’s head.  But when Tony’s actually taking his time and explaining something meant only for Steve, it’s crystal clear.  Tony’s a natural teacher.  And maybe more surprising, a born encourager.  He validates Steve’s questions with nods and verbal affirmations and launches into new answers, tying in everything from military history to Greek mythology to the moon landing.
“No,” Steve insists.  “It’s him.  And if you stay with him and he hits you again I’m going to rip off his arm and beat him with it.  I mean it.  It’ll give a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘stop hitting yourself’.”
Steve’s happiness lasts for all of about three seconds when reality socks him in the stomach.  As happy as the memory was, it’s tainted now.  There’s no one else who remembers.  They’re all dead.  And Bucky might be something even worse.
“And I want you to only buy me things because it makes you happy.  Not ever to apologize.  When you apologize, I want you to use words.  I don’t want to be bought off.”
“Then you need to get your eyes checked, grandpa,” Tony says.  It’s supposed to be a joke except his voice cracks.  He turns his face toward the window, to shut Steve out.  The car will park soon.  Steve will leave.  They can laugh about this in a few days.
Tony hasn’t been to Steve’s place yet. It just makes so much more sense (when they’re sober) for them to go to Tony’s which is spotless, and fancy and where they have all the privacy in the world and a giant, soft bed.
“If anyone would call me on my shit, it was Bucky,” Steve agrees.  These memories are a new kind of ache.  Like scrubbing bleach into a wound.  A lot more painful than any broken bone. “So fine, you want to know about my healing abilities I’ll tell you anything you want to know.  Is the injury something specific?”
“Well, a gay Boy Scout who punched somebody,” Steve says. “Think that means they’ve taken all my merit badges away.”
He sounds so apologetic that Tony feels weirdly bad for him. Especially because Tony’d gotten the joke right away. He hadn’t taken it wrong. There’s no reason for Steve to feel like he’s made things awkward.
“And somewhere that isn’t going to trigger him,” Clint adds. “He doesn’t like chairs, that’s for sure.”
"Bruce, I’m still here.  We were out on the street, but I’m inside now," Steve rambles, both relief and panic edging into his voice. "Is everything okay?"
It’s probably good they’re getting this out to the public now because there is no way the paparazzi are going to miss the way Tony looks at Steve. And Steve knows his eyes are equally lovey. They’re too into each other to hide.
“I only wanted to protect you,” Steve says.  “To be someone in your life who you know really does think you’re enough.  Just you.  Not your money.  Not your name.”
“Steven, show Tony upstairs to your room and get some clean clothes for the both of you.  I’m going to make coffee,” Nanna says.  “Oh, and mind your weapons, dears.  I moved the gun basket to under the shoe bench.”
“Has anyone ever told you how hot it is when you get indignant?” Tony asks. "Because I kind of want to jump you right now."
Not monetarily. Or yes-- it is worth a lot of money. But Tony more means how much it’s worth to him personally.
that name.  I saw him punch a guy once, just cause he wouldn’t stop calling him James even after Bucky asked nicely.  So why's he want to be called that now?”
“Can I be of some assistance, Doctor Banner?” JARVIS’s voice speaks at high volume through the phone in Bruce’s pocket. Bruce digs it out while Clint uses his good hand to pull a knife from his boot.
James nods and then slowly, with effort, relaxes more fully into the stretcher and stares straight up at the tree. “I’ll go in the house. Clint can be close. They-- they should stay out of reach.”
There really is something incredibly weird going on with this family, but since at this point they are allowing Tony to be a part of it, he isn’t going to complain.  When he and Steve finally get some time alone though, Tony is going to have his explanation.
“The truth,” Steve says.  In contrast to Tony, he says it with all the confidence in the world.  “I call things like I see ‘em.”
“A week later, he asked me to take him back," she says.  "He bought me closets full of clothes and shoes and when they were full he tried to buy me new closets.  It didn't matter that I didn't want them.  That I didn't ask for them.  He's not good at apologies, but he tried.  He was so sorry.  I've never seen him so sorry.”
“Wouldn’t call an uncomfortable shirt any kind of suffering,” James quips.  “The shirts Hydra dressed me in were different.  They...” James trails off and looks up at the ceiling.
“He didn’t recognize me,” Steve says finally. “I don’t know what they’d have had to do to him to convince him to kill your folks. Bucky
“I just couldn’t get past the scars, you know?  They grossed me out.” She wrinkles her nose and the audience laughs with her.  “I get that he can’t help that he got kidnapped but like... plastic surgery is a thing for a reason.  And that blue light.  It’s
Steve pulls out a paintball shield that Tony has stealthily painted to look like an arc reactor and snuck into Steve’s stash.  Steve’s got guns, too.  So many guns.
Steve tilts his head and waits for permission.  Tony gives him a slight nod.  Steve tugs his own t-shirt off over his head and tosses it to the side, then puts his fingers to the buttons on the front of Tony’s pajama shirt.  He looks one more time for confirmation.  Tony reaches up to help him, and Steve can take it from there.
“To me, too,” Bruce says.  “And you’re smart not to trust words alone.  I think actions make for much better data.  And right now Steve’s actions indicate he’s not going to give up looking for you any time soon.  Why do you think that is?”
The soldier walks on, as if Bruce hadn’t spoken at all. His hands are free of weapons, and he keeps them where Bruce can see them. That helps keep the Other Guy from shoving his way to the surface.
It’s been 6 weeks since SHIELD fell and 5 weeks since Tony called Steve. Between all of Steve’s efforts and Tony’s satellites stalking they haven’t turned up one single decent lead on the Winter Soldier. Steve has made more than half a dozen trips abroad, and Natasha and Sam have done the same. The only reason Steve’s not on this particular wild goose chase is that he took a bullet a few days before while poking at a Hydra nest and Natasha had threatened to nail Steve’s feet to Stark Tower if he didn’t take a few days off to rest.
Steve has no clue what to say to that.  Tony’s voice is so soft that without super hearing Steve probably wouldn’t have heard him.  He props himself up on an elbow.
It makes Steve’s stomach churn to see Tony look at him the way he is looking at him now.  The same way he’d looked at Jonathan after he’d been hit.  He’s waiting for a punch.  Steve wishes they had Tony’s Iron Man suit with them just to give Tony somewhere to hide.  Some way to feel protected.
“It’s nice… it was nice to have someone understand. Without having to explain to them. I don’t - I don’t like explaining this…” Steve waved at himself, between them, all around the room, “stuff. Thank you for listening anyway.”
Tony sighs. “You got me. Just boring meetings, trying to convince our board of directors to move away from army contracts.”
She nods. “He’s never been good with… he doesn’t understand. He thinks he can have the two people he loves most. He doesn’t see…”
“Surely that must be Iron Man,” Steve says, but his face flushes at the thought that he is Tony’s favorite. Then he is struck by Tony’s words. “Better? Sounds like your day wasn’t going so well before?”
“... and then you disappeared for two weeks. I didn’t see you at all outside of Avengers Alerts. I thought you were avoiding me because you were uncomfortable.” Steve looks down at his hands.
Sharon removes her fingers from his shoulder carefully, like she’s afraid sudden movement might cause Tony to explode. He doesn’t blame her.
“I know your feelings about me and Tony being together might not be positive, and if that’s something you can’t handle, I understand. I’m not, I’m not
“You don’t have to make it sound so horrible,” Steve bites back, a bit defensively. “I know nothing’s going to come of it, it’s just a mild crush. Nothing I’ve never dealt with before. I won’t bring it up again if it makes you that uncomfortable.”
Steve tries to keep his face deadpan, but he can’t help the corner of his mouth from quirking up. “Whenever…?” Tony laughs.
Tony’s mouth settled on a wide O. “Oh. That’s. I need us to stop talking about this right now or I am going to tear off the groin plate with my hands and find out just how experienced you are.”
. His back, his legs, his arms, his face, his eyes: everything hurts. Tony has rarely had call to think of his whole body hurting; usually he can compartmentalize pain into sections and handle them individually.
“I value your opinion, even when it’s different from mine, is all I’m trying to say. I like it when you push back, make me think through what I’m talking about, you know?”
“You won’t - is it really that horrible?” Tony’s voice is so soft, now, so feather soft that Steve is afraid he might lose it. “Am I - are the things I want to give you really that bad?”
But he can’t unlearn his lessons so easily. Everything is ephemeral. You never know when disaster will strike. Everyone leaves.
When he can unclench his muscles and relax enough to look up at Tony again, the man’s jaw is open and his eyes are wide. “Did you just - just from me? From - no touching?”
“Tony,” Steve said, voice full of fond exasperation. “I’ve given blow jobs before, I know what I’m doing.”
If you want something to last, you have to build it with your hands. A gift will always be a mercy, but that means relying on people who will leave you, or hurt you, or die. But a job, a house, someone to care for? These are things they cannot so easily take away from you.
“Oh, yeah,” Steve answers, a little embarrassed. “I pick up languages quick. I was stationed in France for a bit before I joined up with the Invaders, you know, and I spent my free time learning and talking to locals.”
“And now I fucked up everything with Carol, the one person in this whole world, probably, who wouldn’t be happy to see me go - maybe besides Rhodey - because other-you smiled at me. Now I don’t have anything left but this team.” His voice was impossibly soft, probably inaudible to anyone who didn’t have super hearing. “If you kick me, I’ll probably do it. I don’t think I’ll be able to stop myself, I’m not sure that I would want to, and no one else cares. But I would leave if you asked me. Even if it meant I would die I would do it.”
“I can’t… I can’t…” she says, face carefully blank but voice wretched. “I can’t look at them every day and see
. Steve thinks maybe he would be more comfortable in a diner, where he can see Tony’s face better, but that doesn’t stop him from enjoying the food.
There is a piece of paper in front of him. Steve can’t read it, and although he wants to, he shouldn’t pry. Not when they’re still tender like this.
“Can I…?” Steve asks, reaching tentatively for Tony’s dick, wanting desperately to hear Tony whimper and moan like he had before. Steve realizes he’s holding the vibrator in his other hand and drops it on the table, next to the abandoned tray of food.
The thing that people don’t tell you about being uncircumcised is just how sensitive you get. Of course, people say that you feel more pleasure during sex, but that’s not quite accurate. Sensitivity can translate into pleasure, but sometimes it’s just painful.
Steve knows there aren’t any magic words to fix this mess between them.  Even if there were, Steve wouldn’t use them if it meant a shortcut around all the pain.  Tony needs rehab.  He needs time.  He needs to heal.
“That’s up to you,” Bruce says, assuming the him in this context is Steve. “Steve will probably be upset with me when he finds out I kept you a secret, but your right to privacy trumps his right to know.”
“That’s good of you, sweetheart,” Steve soothes.  “Really good.  See?  No reason to think I’m going to jump to the worst possible conclusion.  I know you wouldn’t cheat on me.  That’s not who you are anymore.”
“Kind of the point of a musical,” Steve breathes out.  He needs this to be a real conversation but the way Tony’s looking at him is making it difficult to think.  Impossible.  “You wouldn’t mind?  If I spent some time...”
Nanna seems to sense Tony’s discomfort, because she drops the subject.  She hands him a holster belt, and he puts it on before sliding the gun in securely.  He tugs his shirt back down and it’s hidden.
“Careful there, Obie,” Tony warns, "Or your face is gonna stick like that.  Now if you’ll excuse me?  I have some important information I’d like to share with the class.  Everybody, ready to take some notes?”
“Exactly,” Rhodey confirms.  “I met Tony in a robotics lab.  We were assigned to the same workspace, and at first I thought I was going to have to kill him and bury him out in the quad if I was ever going to graduate.  But one night I was there late and he came in with a black eye and a split lip and he just looked so young, you know?  He didn’t want to talk about it and I was worried my grade in that class was going to cost me my scholarship, so I didn’t push.  He stayed until the next morning, and explained everything I was getting wrong in a way that opened robotics up for me.  I asked him if I could buy him breakfast to thank him and he looked so surprised.  I found out later it was because that was the first time anyone on campus had ever offered to buy him anything.  People just figured he was rich.  Why offer?”
Dinner leads to a walk.  A walk leads to gelato.  Gelato leads to coffee.  Coffee leads back to the penthouse.
I was going to say,” Tony agrees.  “I have thoughts on Barton’s secret hidey-hole-farm-house thing, and I’m kind of dying to know who thought handing Barnes a butcher knife was a good idea, and I have
“K-rations... Think ham loaf.  Malted milk tablets.”  Steve makes another face.  “There were times I thought I was starving and I still couldn’t force myself to eat another one.  I’d have rather eaten pig slop.  One time I actually did.”
It turned out, Steve’s fixation was on the brainwashing techniques HYDRA’d used on Barnes.  Ugly stuff.  Old School.  Having once been on the receiving end of similar torture, Tony was only able to spy on Steve’s screen for about a minute before he grabbed for the nearest trash can and threw up his dinner.
Steve takes a seat at the table at the third computer.  “I think it was something like ‘Clint’s a delicate snowflake and we should all be extra careful we don’t ruin him’?”
Every single word Tony speaks seems to take an extraordinary amount of effort. Like he’s bracing himself for Steve to reject this. To decide even this tiny request is too much.
They all three laugh.  It’s exactly what they need to lighten the mood.  Which is probably a good thing since it’s late and the restaurant has mostly cleared out.  They need to go.
designing weapons.  His flea drones are meant to be more of a nuisance than anything.  They’ve got nets and smoke bombs and magnetic fences.  It all started as crowd dispersal stuff mostly, but in JARVIS’s capable control they are quite an army.
To drive home the point, he rests a hand on Tony’s hip.  It’s a tentative sort of touch and Tony leans into it with absolutely no shame.  “You seem awfully sure where this is going.”
“Order it all,” Tony repeats. “This from Captain ‘Rinse-That-Plastic-Fork-Because-We-Might-Use-It-Again’ Rogers? It seems a little wasteful.”
“It’s similar to what they might do in a hospital, but the formula Tony keeps in the Quinjet is years ahead of what’s out on the market. It lets us use a smaller needle and a thinner tube. Your body can start using it right away, and you shouldn’t feel any discomfort other than the initial insertion. The risk for complications is low,” Bruce explains.
Steve has no idea what to do when Tony just repeats what he says back at him. “Yeah?” He’s having a hard time keeping his thoughts away from what Tony’s mouth looks like hanging open, and it makes him feel slow and stupid.
Tony nods. “You know, you don’t have to keep food like that. You can eat until you’re full.” Steve starts to interject but Tony continues, “and just ask Jarvis to make more if there aren’t any leftovers.”
It’s possible to shrug off the words, because you can convince yourself, “I’m different,” or “that’s bullshit,” or “I can’t, even if I wanted to.”
“Tell me. Tell if something happy and beautiful, Steven Rogers. Help me remember.” Her voice is barely a whisper. “Please.”
Maybe himself now. Maybe he’s willing to hate himself more than the Hydra Supreme, because he got Sharon
Tony’s hand, just below the black silk cummerbund around his waist, is grinding against the tent in Tony’s dress slacks. Steve can’t help but eye the line of Tony’s thigh, the close fit of the wool against his skin, the way the satin side stripe curves where Tony’s leg bends.
The voice of Captain Universe is deep, booming, and strangely echoing in the diner despite the shattered windows. Only the barest hint of Tamara comes through, a scared voice under 1.5 x 1053 kilograms of mass.
Tony laughs, laughs with his full body, when he sees Steve tear through the meal he ordered for them. “You must be pretty hungry, huh?”
He tries to ask where he is. He tries to ask what’s happened - the last thing he remembers is the fight with Carol. But the only thing that comes out of his mouth is a rasping whisper even he can’t parse.
“You’re pretty bright, Rogers, I’m fairly certain you know your letters.” The words are sardonic but Tony’s voice is full of fondness.
At least Tony doesn’t stop talking to him after what must have been a truly disastrous dinner. In fact, he seems even more determined to be around Steve, inviting him down to the workshop or offering to watch films with him.
Steve tentatively put his hand on Tony’s gauntlet, and laughed when Tony began struggling to quickly remove the thing. He threaded his fingers through Tony’s and looked up at him. “I think we need to take this slow. I think we need counseling before either of us is ready to try dating. But I… I really want to. I’ve wanted to since I first met you.” He reached up to push a stray strand of black hair from Tony’s forehead. “Sorry, that’s been bothering me this whole time but I didn’t want to interrupt you. I love listening to your voice,” Steve said, filters off, before frowning to himself. “I can see why this was so distressing for you.”
Tony tries to crack an eyelid, tries to see, but Steve just leans down and… kisses him. On the mouth.
The last also is dismissed - Tony has done a lot of awful things in his life, some of which he can’t even remember, and there’s never going to be a moment when he is absolved of all of the wrong he’s done. There’ll never be a moment where he doesn’t deserve to repent for it either.
Steve’s not sure if he wants the answer to be yes or no. He doesn’t want to frighten Tony, or push him into anything too quickly, but the thought of Tony seeing it, of enjoying it, sends heat all through his body.
“I’ll be honest,” Steve said, which got a snort of laughter from Tony. “Hearing you say that you want to kill yourself when you’re not with me is very frightening. Not because - it’s not because it makes me not want to be with you, or it does a little bit -“ and Steve raised a finger to pause Tony from thinking whatever fool thoughts were in his head, “because I’m afraid that I could fuck this up and make you feel like that again. I don’t - I think we both need some help. In the whole, how to have a healthy relationship department. Before we do anything. But I want to. I want to do anything with you.”
But the first time he almost had his chance, when he found a tiny little scrap of metal sharp enough to cut, Sharon had met his eyes while the thing in Steve’s skin wasn’t looking and shook her head so sharply that Tony felt her fear on his skin.
Tony is kissing him, touching his face and his shoulders and his back and his ass and his legs. He feels like his whole body is tingling with warmth, like Tony’s hands are unlocking some hidden tension in his muscles.
“You know, go get lunch. I want to know more about you, see how you’re holding up. Iron Man said that you were adjusting well, but I mean, I want to see for myself. Plus maybe I can answer some questions you have about the future.”
Steve has come to see the mercies, the gifts, like portents of doom. If he accepts them, even one, he is opening himself up to a hope that can never be true.
Steve let himself believe that Doom’s truth poison made him pull Tony into a hug that made the other man squeak. He didn’t have to pretend as he whispered into Tony’s ear, “I’ve missed you. I’ve missed you so much.”
“You’re not the only one who needs this,” Tony says, his finger still on her shoulder. “Take care. For them. I’ll tell them all about you.”
He’s thought about this a lot, about how this might go, but his thoughts haven’t even reached the moon’s periapsis yet and so he lets himself focus on the sensation of it.
Steve smiles back, trying so hard to look unmoved, even if his erection is pressing tightly against his uniform pants and his breathing is as labored as it is in battle.
They sit in silence, more companionable than Steve would have expected considering the earlier heat of their argument. Steve is a little worried that Tony will hold it against him, but Tony just looks appraisingly at Steve.
Iron Man doesn’t say anything, which Steve takes as assent to drop the topic. He’s a little hurt that Iron Man would react like this to Steve crushing on Tony. It’s not illegal, or anything, and it’s completely harmless for Steve to pine.
“Tony would tell you that everything he touches withers, but that’s only because he can’t see what joy he’s given us. Given me.
“Sure, we can go outside if you want,” Steve says, completely lost and more than a little flustered. “I think our jackets are -“
Tony turns his head to look at her, his eyes a little dazed, but when he looks back at Steve he’s squinting accusatorily. Steve laughs and combs his fingers through the hair at the base of Tony’s neck.
He leans into the touch, smiles gratefully at Tony, feels his heart lighten at the smile he receives in turn. Feels his gut stab as he looks past Tony to see the beautiful - too beautiful - motorcycle behind him.
“Of course not.” Her voice is just as even as it always is, but Steve doesn’t trust the veneer of calm after the way she attacked Tony earlier.
Tony nods. “Thank you, Sharon.” He touches a finger to her shoulder, barely there, and she looks up quickly, meeting his gaze not in fear or disgust but surprise. Maybe even gratitude.
The Universe has put away all pretense of hiding what she feels and drops her face into her hands. Steve continues anyway.
“Mmm, hey gorgeous,” Tony says, looking hungrily at Steve through heavily lidded eyes. He’s wearing the kind of suit Steve drew him in - sleek black wool, almost silky smooth to Steve’s eyes, peak lapels reminiscent of the formal tailcoats Steve saw in the pictures back in the day, and closely tailored to Tony’s shoulders.
He meets Tony out front, jogging down the steps in new clothes - a simple pale blue button down and dark slacks - and Tony looks a little surprised to see him, as if he thought Steve might have run off. Steve frowns to himself; he doesn’t like that Tony is so hesitant just because Steve disagreed with him. He hates feeling like people don’t feel comfortable pushing back on what he says just because he’s Captain America.
The Universe opens her mouth and closes it again. It is perhaps the most human thing he’s seen her do tonight. He wonders if Tamara is fighting to get through, fighting to say something. Or is the Universe just that lost for words?
He stays with the Rothsteins, and that is a gift too. Steve thinks, in his grief, that maybe he doesn’t deserve it here. But in his heart of hearts, the truth is that he is deathly afraid of losing this precious thing. Like he lost the only other thing that matters to him.
“Sorry,” Tony says, though he’s not sure what for: for bringing it up; for reminding her of that time; for being here at all; or for managing to survive.
She’s asking him but surely she must know. Maybe this is some kind of play and she’s waiting for him to give his lines. Was this all rehearsed, without his knowing? He hates feeling like this, like there’s a great big joke he hasn’t been let in on.
But Steve’s mind snaps out of that warm place his brain has taken him to. He needs to get it together.
“Steve. My - uh, my name is Steve,” he hears himself gush. He immediately regrets it, both because he sounds stupid and because they’re not supposed to reveal their identities as part of the Avengers charter. If Mr. Stark - if Tony - isn’t actually on the team, though, then maybe it’s okay.
“I’m afraid that one day he’ll be taken away from me. And I will be left with nothing but my hands, and nothing built from them to hold on to.” Steve looks at his hands; clenches them, unclenches them, reassuring himself that they are there.
“I hate myself,” Tony said miserably, covering his face with his hands, sitting down to slump on the battlefield strewn with doombots. It figured Doom would want to embarrass Tony in the most traumatizing way possible.
Steve nods decisively. “Of course. Sounds like a plan.” He’s doing his best to fill his voice with the kind of surety that kept the Invaders going, when they felt all hope was lost. “Uh… is this…” he asks, looking down at his clothes. He is wearing workout clothes, a simple t-shirt and sweats.
“American lives aren’t worth more than Afghani. If I were building weapons and they were being used on American soil against everyday Americans, no one would blame me for wanting to stop.”
“I can’t let myself,” Steve says, his voice just as feather soft as Tony’s was, and Tony throws his hands up in the air and storms out of the garage.
“Yeah, big boy. Does that feel good? Am I making you feel good?” He can’t look down but he knows Tony must be grinning.
Tony doesn’t wait for Steve to freak out about his dick, however. In the span of moments it takes for Steve to begin his thoughts, Tony is choking out, “tighter, a little tighter babe,” and when Steve tightens his grip, “yeah, just like that, perfect, you’re so perfect for me, now just - just jerk it down and up, yeah, god you’re so good, a little slower at first, okay? I’ll tell you when to speed up, don’t want to come all over you and the tux quite yet, huh?”
Tony looks at his hands. A mistake; he remembers when the Hydra Supreme made him touch her, and it’s worse than seeing the couches.
Iron Man is sitting in his usual armchair, legs kicked up on an ottoman, reading a book Steve doesn’t recognize. He closes it with a snap and sets it down on the table next to him.
That mollifies Steve slightly. “Then if we go out to eat again, you won’t mind if we skip over menus with this kind of pricing now that I’ve been exposed?”
“I like it when you touch me,” Tony said, and his eyes went wide and his face paled. “I hate that I like it, because I shouldn’t, because I don’t deserve that, and I hate that I’m explaining this to you even if I can’t stop it because I’m just putting all of my issues on you again even though you’ve been struggling more than I have, with the Hydra thing. And I hate that I even brought that up because now you’re going to look sad, because you think that’s all people see when they look at you, but all I can see is the best man I’ve ever known. I hate myself,” he finished lamely.
“Have you ever had something taken away from you?” Steve asks, not sure where the words are coming from.
There’s something about seeing her that fills Tony with dread. She knows exactly what he did, what he had to do to survive. She watched him, lips wrapped around Hydra Supreme’s cock, as he imagined it was Steve’s cock. There’s no way she knows, she can’t possibly, but something about the idea eats away at Tony. He can’t see her because he’s afraid of himself and how he’ll react.
He thinks about the look Tony gave him in the restaurant, when he saw Steve looking full. That pleased contentment. The joy in his eyes. He starts sketching insistently, because he knows that if he lets himself drift in his thoughts of Tony, he may never land back on the ground.
I was so furious, not at you or at him - well, not on this front - but at myself, for letting it get that far. For not having the courage to say what I feel.
When the man saunters down the foyer steps, suit jacket over one shoulder, Steve’s breath catches in his throat.
Tony thought he had ‘world’s guiltiest man’ on lock, but something in Sharon’s gaze makes him rethink that. She said his guilt complex was a mile wide, but somehow he has to wonder how big hers is.
Tony simultaneously needs to leave and to never move again. He feels it so viciously, so violently within himself, that desire to die. He’s fucked up too much, destroyed too much good in the world. He can’t come back from this.
Jan opens the door wider, motioning Steve into the room. Ant-Man is thankfully not there, probably still working in his lab. Steve stands just inside of the doorway, unsure where to go or what to do with himself.
He’s not sure he can place the scents - his nose is usually quite good - but he thinks it must be sandalwood with hints of citrus. There is a woody, earthy undertone to it. It’s heady and delicious and not helping Steve concentrate at all.
“To eat?” Steve hears himself asking, distantly, his stomach wrapping itself in knots as he tries not to think about Tony talking like that right next to his ear, or chest to chest, or with his mouth on Steve’s -
“Is that enough, Steven Rogers?” Her voice is pleading, the first time any of her words have sounded like questions and not demands.
Tony nods. He’s surprised she’s telling him about this instead of just getting an abortion quietly. Tony doesn’t think this is a punishment, doesn’t think that she wants him to know so that he will blame himself and suffer, even if that is what’s happening. But he doesn’t have any other explanation.
After their bird rescue mission, Steve had decided to burn off some energy with a run around Manhattan and Tony had tried for a little bit of work-week normalcy. He's not making much progress, since he's pretty sure his eyes have been staring at the same page of the last Stark Industries Board Report for the better part of a half an hour.  Not that he's great at this boring, bullshit paperwork even at the best of times, but he is floundering to find a reason to care now, when so many more important things are happening off in Europe without him.
“Third base?” Tony asks.  “You pull out some Battlestar Galactica that’s an inside-the-park grand slam.  Guaranteed.”
Well, that explains some things.  The anger and hostility are aimed at Howard and Steve’s a living, breathing reminder of the man.  They’ve never really talked about Howard.  Steve knows he’s pressing his luck with even a simple question, but he doesn’t have it in him to back away from the subject.  If Tony’s going to hate Steve, Steve wants it to be for a better reason than a grudge against his father.
“I think I’d rather just ride it all out and get back to hockey,” Steve says. “Though I do appreciate you stepping in. It’s been a rough couple of weeks.”
Steve finds himself wondering if the men are in the middle of some kind of lovers’ quarrel, because for the first thirty minutes Sean doesn’t say a single word to Tony.  Technically neither does Steve, but that’s because Tony won’t make eye contact with him.   (Or with anyone else for that matter.)  Not even with Barton, who has taken the seat to Steve’s left and whose company makes for a welcome relief from the rest of their dining companions.
Tony sees all this, but isn’t entirely sure what’s happening.  Steve’s words are still playing on repeat in his head, though none of them slot into place in a way that makes any sense.  It’s not that Tony and Steve aren’t friends-- Tony knows they are.  He’s just always had the feeling it’s based on necessary tolerance and mandated team unity and unavoidable mutual friends.  That Steve might genuinely like him-- might respect his work and how hard he tries to make things right-- has honestly never crossed Tony’s mind.
"We're all good, Cap," Clint supplies helpfully. They must be on speaker.  "You know, just in case you didn't get that from all the times Bruce said okay.”
“You want to bunk over?” Tony asks. “I have a couple of guest rooms. I promise it won’t be a problem.”
The barn is absolutely silent as Bruce ever so carefully thumbs over James’s knee. The kneecap feels structurally intact, though the swelling could be misleading. They need an x-ray machine or similar. Bruce would like to think if the knee is truly jacked up, James wouldn’t have been getting around so well, but that seems optimistic. No doubt he’s got a pain tolerance that’s off the charts.
Now it’s the young man’s turn to smile. “She never forgot about you. She taught me and my brother all your lines from the stage show and we’d put on little plays with her in the backyard. We’d fight over who got to be you and who got to be Hitler but I always won, on account of my name.”
Tony’s a little dazed, and it isn’t helped by feeling Steve’s hands on him.  But when he’s finally out from under his latest project, he’s smiling.
Bruce looks up at James and waits for a nod before he begins rolling the jeans up over themselves. The smell is unpleasant. There’s no way around that. Thankfully his travels have made Bruce immune to most human-related smells. Hospital cleaner still unravels him, but that’s not a problem here.
“For me it’s always the memories,” Clint confides.  “What if Jarvis puts something on the screen and Bruce props you up a little? I like cartoons,” Clint suggests.
He works for several minutes before Tony’s eyes close.  His breathing slows.  He’s still upright so he must be awake, but it’s as calm as Steve has ever seen him.  Tony slits open one eye when Steve switches from the left hand to the write, but that’s all the reaction he gets from him apart from relaxation.  It’s nice.  Steve could happily continue long past where it might get weird.
