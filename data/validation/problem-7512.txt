“He would say that. He always said his mate would have the full works. You’re gonna be wearing his clothes for a while until your bond settles.” Peter clicked, crossing his legs carefully. It was strange but the whole picture reminded Tony of a cat lounging. At least Peter seemed more relaxed.
But she doesn’t know that. When he looks up from his desk and meets her eye, he sees a shadow there that wasn’t there before.
"Why are you really here Tony?" Carol asked with a pinched expression. "Did he ask you to come here? There's no way Steve would call you here when he knows how everyone feels about-"
Tony thinks to himself and remembers the relieved look Steve would send his way. The look of absolute relief and gratitude that would flood his face whenever he saw him waking up. Steve would always be happy to see him okay.
“What do you mean?”
Tony’s heart completely sank. He felt like a complete fool for continuing to hope. Would he never learn?
"My boots. I'd totally forgotten about them. I would've just let you carry on with them on." Tony explained and chuckled softly at the image. His first time with Steve and he'd be wearing Shield issued white boots. Who'd have thought?
Tony let the words continue to sweep over him. He didn’t care-
“I...well here’s the thing.” Steve finally sighed and beckoned Tony closer. When Tony was within reach, Steve picked up a piece of paper from one of his infinite piles and handed it to him.
“I’ll come back as soon as I can.” Steve says with confidence even though Tony can see his hands shaking. “I won’t leave you to go through it by yourself.”
Rogers is staring at Tony like he wants to hold him. Like a puppy that’s aching for a hug.
“How did you find out?” Tony said quietly, feeling like he’d just stumbled into a bear trap. He felt humiliated beyond belief but at least Steve wasn’t about to start mocking him again. Instead, Steve’s expression had gone pinched.
The thrashing stopped. The screams calmed. Through Steve’s chest, he could feel Tony’s heartbeat start to slow and his own did the same.
“You and I don’t get on. That’s what I know about us.” Tony says and suddenly the room goes heavy with a sick scent and Roger’s eyes are wide. “You told me I needed to stop pretending to be a hero. That you knew men who were worth ten of me.”
Remnants of the dream flitted through his mind. Words he dreaded to remember.
“Shhh-“
Silently Hank handed it to him and didn’t stop him as he tucked it into his belt. Once it was in place, Steve stood tall and nodded.
“No one?”
“Explain yourselves. Now!” Carol demands and Steve steps back from Strange, creating a meters distance. If anything, that makes Strange struggle more.
There was something Tony had been wondering for a while. Something he’d been hoping to ask.
And that meant it was only a matter of time before Steve would find out too.
For instance, when Pepper told him about the SHRA and the fact that Steve had been-
“He’s scared, god.” Steve said just as softly and then slowly manoeuvred his hands to free one and begin to stroke it on its back. It seemed to have a soft Iron-shell around it, and when it felt Steve’s finger on its back, the shivering started to settle and it slowly retracted its face-plate.
“Excellent!” Thor said and slammed his hand on his back a few times. “He will be most pleased!”
Though reluctant, Tony could see that Steve would be too focused on him to properly fight himself. So he had no choice but to stick with Steve.
Then the words registered and rage flooded Tony’s body.
“Did you just say he-“
Tony’s eyes widen. It
“I’m not gonna hurt anyone.” Steve said in a low tone to Maria, but his brows shot miles upwards when Tony felt a sigh escape his lips. Steve’s gaze darted to his lips and sought out his tired eyes.
Tony would say he was determined. The real question was about what.
Tony’s eyes glistened in the starlight. He kept trying to mask his expression but every time he met Steve’s eyes, he just smiled like he couldn’t help it.
It was Steve-living, breathing and in the flesh. No part of him was out of place and that was good-very good and Tony couldn’t ask for more. A healthy, happy Steve was just perf-
Tony almost wanted to comfort him and reassure him that he knew. Steve didn’t care about him anymore. That wasn’t the relationship they had now.
A bark of laughter startles him. Reed is laughing at him again, just like before.
Whatever happened, he’d do his best to listen.
“It does make it difficult, I admit.” Tony snarked and instantly shut his mouth when Zeke paused in laying out his packs on the bed.
Robinson sighed and released him. “I don’t mean to disrespect your company. Or the efforts of the workers. But I cannot overlook your value. You’re fascinating.”
Slowly,
“Whoah. I forgot how insanely strong you are. Could give a guy a complex.” Tony said faintly, not registering Steve’s hand slip around his neck.
A few minutes passed. The tears had started to fall down his cheeks silently but he didn't move or say anything, knowing it was too late. Carol was watching him and he couldn't bring himself to really do much else. He prayed for the silence to suffocate him and put an end to his misery. He prayed for a world where he hadn't ruined the best thing he'd ever had.
“He has already answered. He has nothing left to give.” Strange supplies and Steve somehow thinks it’s meant to be accusing. Still, he soldiers on, stepping closer to them with his hands out.
“Are you hurt?” Tony heard in the coms and watched Steve lower the shield and straighten up. He still didn’t turn towards him. “Tony, are you hurt?”
“Why didn’t you report me!?”
“ZEKE! ZEKE, COME QUICK!” She continued to scream, crying out every time she so much as looked in Tony’s direction.
It all felt...wrong.
“He doesn’t understand. That’s fine, we don’t expect him to.”
“No thanks.”
“...I’m tired Steve.” His quiet voice said and more tears leaked out of Tony’s eyes. “Really...hurts...”
“Hey buddy, you alright?” Clint asked quietly and thankfully that was enough to make Tony focus.
“I’m glad Captain.” He says, and leaves as quietly as he came.
It had happened once before. It could happen again.
The voice sounded like a young man’s. Maybe a young adult. Tony blinked tiredly against the floor and pressed his cheek harder into the sharp edges, letting his tears fall into the ground.
"That you're human." Steve's eyes glistened as he spoke. "And that you deserve some kindness too."
“Tony?” Steve asked quietly into his ear and then guided Tony around to face him. With both hands settled on Tony’s hips, he looked him over and frowned.
Tony took a bread-stick from the centerpiece and snapped it in half, scowling at the crumbs as they fell. His life had improved massively since Steve had walked out. He didn’t have anyone nagging him to eat or sleep or do something stupid like go for a walk when he had at least twenty jobs to do. He didn’t have anyone sitting on his head all day, making the stupid rustling noise with sheets of paper. No coffee mug stains other than his own. The ones he chose to leave behind, instead of finding them everywhere. Steve was surprisingly messy with his kitchen ware. And just about everything else. And he meant
Fingers slipped between them and stroked Tony’s chin, a light brush under his jaw. Instinct took over and Tony opened his mouth.
Or maybe he was just missing home.
“Nick, just-I need to get back.”
He’s settling into the bed with a small smile on his face. He closes his eyes and things fade.
Steve didn’t hesitate then. He couldn’t hold back anymore and as a wave of emotions swamped his entire being, he slipped his arms around Tony and sat them both up, pulling Tony into a tight hug. Then he held on like he was afraid to let go and cried into Tony’s hair, keeping Tony close because this was the first time he’d gotten to touch him since Tony was trapped and they had been through so much even then and Tony was
Not that there’s much to that package now. In fact, it’s almost laughable, how little there is. How
That had been when he’d given up. Had dropped the pretenses and stopped lying to himself. He’d finally accepted the truth.
"You mean all this time?" Tony looked at him desperately, not sure whether he could dare to hope. "You can't seriously-"
Who was this man? Why couldn’t he know? And more importantly...
Just as he’d finished filling the suitcase, he heard a knock on his door.
“Every time you saw them, you’d cringe. I had a feeling but-“ Steve huffed and shook his head. “Thanks for telling me.
It had been the best meal he'd had since he'd set foot on the Helicarrier. And the heaviest meal.
“Oh, I have something for you.” Steve said lightly and pushed the chair back a little to reach under the island. He swiped the plastic bag and placed it on the table, pushing it in Tony’s direction swiftly. Eyes like a hawks’, Steve linked his fingers on the table and leaned forward.
“Tony? If you can hear me, I’m not leaving you. Not this time.”
“What do you mean?”
“They look perfect on you. You look really good tonight Tony.” He said quietly and looked up hopefully, catching Tony off guard.
"I threw up outside your apartment. Could barely stand afterwards..." Tony trailed off, remembering the guilt and fear of what had been coming. He was starting to feel the same now.
“Is it viable?” He added, watching as Hank slipped the syringe into an large injector that almost looked like a gun. The whole mechanism locked with loud snap.
Reed’s head shoots up. His eyes are blank.
-“ Tony moaned quietly but Steve squeezed him closer and sighed.
“Does it matter? We have a job to do.”
At least, that was how he felt.
There was a brief pause where Tony watched them glance at each other with a knowing look. Finally one answered.
"Very careful. Has always been. He never wanted to take risks." Pierce sighed, shaking his head a little. "I'm just so glad he listened on this one. Thank god it worked out okay, otherwise Shield would've probably hunted both of us. Hardliners, I'm serious."
Squeezing his eyes shut, he bites his lip and shivers. It’s
“You think I can get life insurance from both? What do you think? Perks of being omega and all.”
Tony walked forward until he approached Dugan. Holding out the drink, he smiled and tried not to look at Steve, who’s eyes had been fixed on him since he’d arrived. It was hard to ignore.
“You’re a piece of shit, Stark.” She growled and twisted his arm back, squeezing so tightly the bone fractured underneath.
“That’s not funny.”
“For research purposes. C’mon, how often do people get to see such a great view of Captain America’s ass?”
“Tony.” Captain America breathes and heaves a sigh of relief. “Thank god, I was so worried.”
“Of course I’m incredible. I have roller skates in my boots remember?”
Tony didn’t have the heart to tell him there was nothing like that for him. That his body had been washed of all that hope and joy and excitement. The promise of happiness that he lost all those years ago.
“Yeah. Natasha was starting to lose it. She even threatened to call Clint back to shoot his ass. ” Peter laughed but then he stopped and leaned forward.
“No you don’t. You can, but you choose not to. Because something about me scares you. And I don’t know what-“ Steve held up a hand when Tony made to speak. “You don’t trust me to take your side.”
“Easy. You’re gonna be shaky for a while. That’s just how it is.” Steve said and gently tugged until Tony was inches away from Steve’s shoulders.
Taking a leap of faith, he stepped forward and cleared his throat.
Tony smiles when the pup yawns and looks up when he notices scurrying foot steps. Steve enters and leaves the room with various blankets in tow. Finally he dumps several on the floor and takes the softest one.
So he skipped breakfast. No big deal. Made his day easier anyway.
“Five days. You must be hungry.” Norman acknowledged, holding the door open for him. “I’m surprised you haven’t gone feral yet.” He commented with a raised brow.
you.” Steve cut him off sharply with a fierce glint in his eye. “I do care about you. More than you know.”
Confused, Tony paused behind him. “I mean. Vampire. Kind of goes without saying. Bloodsucker. Leech. Monster.” He felt something shrivel inside as he spoke. His good mood vanished and he looked down at the juice in his hand once again, weighing it in his hand.
“You make me sick.” Tony growled sharply and all of a sudden twisted out of Steve’s grasp and latched onto his collar to yank him into a fierce, scorching kiss. Tony pressed and pushed and pulled and tugged and took and didn’t let go.
“The guy was lying.” Tony sighed and looked around. “There’s nothing here.”
“Well Sharon, it’s nice to meet you. I’m-“
“Well it doesn't matter I should think.” Reed says and it’s almost a breath. “I’m sure he’ll be thrilled to know you don’t care.”
Steve’s mouth falls open. The sheer-
Curious, Tony headed into the tower, nodding to the receptionist and a few employees. Managing his precious bundle with care, he waited for the thankfully empty lift to descend and maneuvered his way into the lift. The lift began to rise and so did Tony’s nerves.
Tony had one goal in mind. The only thing important enough to make him put the suit on.
“Sorry.” He whispered, wanting desperately to be alone. To sit in his room and just pretend he wasn’t about to be given away as nothing more than property. To pretend he would have a future with someone like Steve.
“Fine. Everything’s fine.” Steve smiled tightly, dropping into the seat opposite Stark. Not be choice of course, only because there weren’t any other seats.
like the bike incident. Steve even had that same eye twitch going on.
“S-Steve... you look great.” Tony stuttered, uncrossing his legs and leaning forward. Suddenly feeling self conscious, he closed a hand over his mouth to hide how much it was hanging open. Steve looked...he looked
Tony is given a full recount of what happened. Apparently he was fighting a group of Hydra agents who had attempted to attack Shield’s New York station when one of them had blasted him out of the sky. He’d taken a heavy fall and Captain America and the others had called for medical and finished up the fight. And there the team had discovered the news.
Undeterred, Zeke simply laughed and faced the two children. Tony had to hold back when they flinched under the gaze.
He heard a scream. Then the sound of rapid fire gunshot. The sound of shouts and heavy artillery.
"Well, firstly-“ Steve pulled open a draw under the desk and retrieved some forms. “Your contract hasn’t been fully signed. I need your signature.”
The showers had been next which, again were public for male agents and not exactly what Tony would call a good time. At least they were tiled and had sensors near the shower heads to reduce contact. There was enough sharing going on already in his opinion.
“Aye Captain! And what of the woman?” Thor bellowed, punching the last of Ty’s men into the ground.
“Just like old times!”
“No thanks. I’ll wait here.”
“Yeah, sorry. Just a little tired, I guess.”
“I suppose. Wasn’t really my idea honestly.” Steve answered coolly, arms crossing over his beefy chest. “You were a suggestion. Thought I’d agree.”
“You’ve never had an interest in me before. Now suddenly you want all of this? I just don’t get it.”
Tony hadn’t been there. He’d hidden from him as usual,
“Tony? Are you okay?” Steve asked sounding worried behind him. He came closer until-
He doesn’t look back. He doesn’t want to give the man the satisfaction of seeing how much he’s blinking.
Fury frowned and glanced at Maria. They both seemed to have a silent discussion before he put his drink down and stood from his chair.
And now Steve wouldn’t be the one out of the picture. If
“Steve. Come in, Steve.” Tony bit out, struggling to think beyond the pain. But he had to, he needed to find Steve.
Steve was blushing. His lips were quirked up but he wouldn’t look at Tony, no matter how stunned Tony looked. He shifted from side to side on his feet and chewed his lip a little to keep from smiling. He looked so cute.
"It's things like this that got you into this mess." He said quietly, folding one of Tony's shirts neatly. "Why didn't you say anything?"
It’s on a night where Tony is thinking about this, that he gets a visitor. A man dressed in uniform, holding a gun and stepping out of the shadows to face him. Just the man Tony’s looking for.
“You have an alpha. You told me yourself.” And doesn’t that just make him want to scream?
Things had started to go wrong about the time Stane stole his company. The loss of his team, his work and finally his suit had been the last blow. Or rather, that had pushed him to the edge.
"You should just leave me. Leave me to die." Tony cries into his hands and his vision is so blurred and he feels lower than the low, like he's worse than every single rotting piece on earth. He's tainted and awful and so far from what Steve and everyone else deserves for what he's done and it's about time everyone realize they're better off without him. Hell, if they won't let him die, maybe he can just delete his memories, even that will be enough for him-
“I know what you’ve been doing. Don’t blame me if I’m a little skeptical.”
“Well, you’re pregnant. You definitely shouldn’t have been fighting in the suit. You put yourself and the baby at risk.”
“You...ah, you’d make a great couple.” He said quietly, finally deciding that maybe it was time to let go. Steve wasn’t meant for him, no matter how much he’d hoped and he was kidding himself. He always had.
“To give Tony the extremis virus again. To synthesize a strain, I mean Steve-“ His eyes flashed as he stared at Steve, mind ticking away behind the glasses. “This is designed exactly for a recipient with an existing strain. And with simulated tests on adult males ranging from thirty to thirty-five years, with a medical history of heart conditions and previous extremis injections. Steve, you can’t seriously believe it’s not obvious who it’s for.”
“Steve.” Tony begged, feeling his voice break and Steve froze instantly.
“What? No. I meant about buying me a suit worth thousands of dollars! You realise I’m rich right? I can afford it. You didn’t have to pay!”
Once he was part of the row, he realized with a start that his work here started now. The uniform was the first step and this show of control was Steve’s posturing. It was clear.
He leans over and presses his lips against the ones of the man he's loved for so long, and gives his breath like it’s nothing. It’s easy. It always has been. Steve always took his breath away, regardless of whether they were sparring in the mansion or taking down the Skull.
“What?”
“We’re not...solitary. It’s a common misconception but vampires actually do like company.” Tony sighed and faced the empty street, thoughts swirling in his head.
“The doctor told me this was okay. I figured we’d start with something light before we work our way up.”
He cries quietly for hours. It’s dark when he finally looks up. He can’t take it anymore. He doesn’t want to do this anymore.
“H-here.” Tony mumbles and pushes himself to stand. Sucking in a deep breath, he forces his limbs to stop trembling as hard and stands on his own two feet.
When Tony looked up, he could see the devastation in Steve’s eyes. He looked close to tears.
“What happened? Is all well?” Tony asked, pulling his eyes away from the Stanes to look back at Whitney who was leaning against the entrance with her arms folded. The gold trails on her mask glinted in the light of the flickering candles. Her red eyes followed him as he made his way to the book shelf opposite the bed.
“I...” Tony bit his lip and looked at his hand like he’d only just realized. Then slowly he lowered his hand and turned towards Steve. His eyes were wide and so dark, the blue was almost gone.
"I'm afraid that you might get so bored without me tonight. I mean, you can't live without me, I can tell." Tony joked quietly, and hoped Steve didn't notice the tremble in his voice. "So I'm willing to spend another day with you, commander. Since I know you need it."
"Oh my god, Tony, are you okay? What on earth are you doing here?"
“You’re probably right. I mean-“ Steve glanced at him briefly before turning back to his window, brow furrowed unhappily. “-I’ve been treated like a Captain for the last few years. Since working with Shield I’ve had to balance out a dominating persona with not being seen as unfair. I guess it’s habit that I kind of take charge.”
“Easy soldier.” Steve said from behind and Tony froze.
“Tony-“ Ty sounds terrified and when he feels the first contraction, he realizes then why.
“Shhh it’s okay, it’s okay.” White lies but better than the truth. Tony was far from okay, it was obvious and Steve-
Reed pauses by the door. It’s not a favor, Steve knows that. But still, he thinks Reed loses some of the tension in his shoulders.
It sounded nice. Tony wondered if maybe his dreams would be kinder tonight.
Sounds are starting to fade. All Steve can think about is the man
“Ste-
Only the hallucination doesn't let him. The grip on him turns painfully tight, tight enough to leave bruises. He's pulled back so that the hallucination can look at him.
“Okay.” Steve said quietly and something broke in Tony as the instant regret of what he’d just done sunk in. “Okay.”
“Wh't...ext’remis?” He whispered and when he rolled his head to look up at Steve directly, his pupils were blown wide and bright blue, with faint lines running across.
Ty is also here too. And he does not look happy listening to Captain America.
Releasing a sigh, Tony took a step forward and decided not to interfere. It wasn’t for him to know anyway. It wasn’t his place.
Stark industries goes to Pepper, Maria is named Shield’s designated director after him and Bucky and Sam are made to lead the Avengers. It’s all going to plan. All that’s left are his personal affects.
“Steven had something to say about that day too. He told us later, ‘I think I found somethin’ real special. I’ve never seen anything like ‘im!’. And I swear that boy was all teeth that day.”
Steve’s hands reached up to curl around Tony’s waist. “That’s not the response a person expects.”
Moments passed. Then, when Steve spoke, Tony shivered at the sheer anger in his voice.
When Steve woke up, everything was quiet. The bed underneath him felt warm and smelled faintly of cotton and he could hear the distant sound of cabs, and the distinct murmur of Manhattan. It was evening time, he could tell.
Tony stared at him in shock. “You’ve
Steve stopped short and gave him a marginally irritated look and for a second, Tony genuinely panicked and wondered if he’d overstepped. He probably needed to make amends.
“It’s nice to see you like this. You seem happier. I guess Norman wasn’t kidding.”
“I’ve got my army uniform. But yes, a few things have been added.”
Tony looked like he wanted to say something there but he didn’t. Instead he sighed and turned to look out the window. For a moment he said nothing and Steve continued to stare at him. Until finally he spoke.
“Get water instead. He doesn’t know what he’s talkin’ about. And Stevie...” Gabe glanced behind Tony and sighed.
Tony gave him a brittle smile that didn’t even feel real. “I don’t mind Steve, really. If you need me to do something else, I don’t mind, I promise.”
Tony’s had enough. Frankly this can’t continue and it’s clear that something's gone massively wrong.
“Would you be okay here? I just need to do some rounds and say hello to a few of the brass and I’ll be back. That sound okay?” Steve asked quietly but that glimmer of joy was staying. It was like Tony had taken down one of Steve’s walls and now-
Steve is gone. Tony is alone once again.
“Promise me Tony.”
“I’m fine. I had a lot of-a lot of injuries when I first woke up-"
“So why-“ Tony’s eyes widened and he checked the sheet again. “There aren’t any weapons on board?”
Sharon wasn’t sitting with Steve. She was in the seat furthest away.
“And why do you want me to do that?”
“It’s yours. I bought it for you. It’s a gift.” Steve interrupted him, but without any heat. The shine in his eyes...it was hopeful but hesitant. “You don’t need to return it. In fact, I’d rather you keep it. Maybe you could wear it for our other events?”
“Secretary.”
“Tony is mine.” Rogers says and sounds like he’s gonna choke. “You can’t say things like that. I won’t let you take him from me.”
“So how long have you and Rogers been together?”
Steve. He hated that he loved Steve.
He’s a murderer. A cold-blooded killer. Everything Steve made him believe he wasn’t. It almost makes him hate Steve for throwing him off from the truth. It borders on
For a second Tony wondered if maybe he’d gone too far. There was a line and maybe he was far beyond it. But at the same time, he was done. He was finished.
“Sorry pup. Gotta run. But it was fun while it lasted. See you later. Or never.” Tony said quickly and immediately sprinted across the ledge and took a leap of faith.
“Thor and I will move the asteroids out. If you can bring the quinjet in, we’ll try to land. We think the air is actually breathable. Readings are showing oxygen levels are thirty percent with nitrogen levels at sixty. Other measurements are similar to earth.”
Tony gets sized for his outfit and Steve makes a suggestion.
“As soon as we’re done here, we’re gonna go out there and finish our damn meal. This is my restaurant and we’ll use it how I say we'll use it.”
“Steve? What is it?”
He hadn’t had this in so long but he still remembered every bit of it.
Feeling his heart sink, he steeled his nerves. “I’m so
“No. I don’t need to.” He smiled. That part of his life was over. It had been since Osborn.
Reed wouldn’t be looking at him like that. Reed wouldn’t be staring at him like he was the monster.
Steve lets go of Reed like he’s been burned. It’s the fire, the sheer anger in Reed’s eyes that throws him.
Some things just...weren’t meant to be.
’!” Steve barked and if he was affected by Tony’s flinch, he didn’t show it .
A knock on the door pulls him out of his thoughts. With a sigh, he says the words.
Steve was not going to let that happen.
“Yesterday...this morning. Before the mission.” Tony cracked open his eyes and watched as the doctor’s head shot up, his eyes narrow and searching.
Tony groaned but shifted from his curled up position, his newly claimed dressing gown tucked around him. Something eased in Steve’s heart.
“Nothing.” Tony frowns and tilts his head. “I’m dead aren’t I?”
Thankfully when he arrived at the cafeteria, there was plenty of food. Majority of the tables were filled with Shield agents and once Tony collected his food (simple roast chicken with vegetables and potatoes), he struggled to find somewhere to sit.
Methodically, he gathered his best items and put them in the simple cloth bag. Five tins of water and four tins of protein. It was half of what he had left, but he felt it was worth it. What if there was someone who needed help?
How long had he been out here? His throat was so dry, he was sure it would hurt to speak. Words seemed so far away, almost as far as the blue ship.
There was still hope! He could still make it-
"And drinking? Smoking?"
He’s not sure how many days go by but he knows he’s not doing so great. He feels unsteady on his feet all the time now and sometimes people do a double take when they see him, almost as if they can’t quite believe what they’re seeing.
“I obey our father Whitney. Maybe you should too, lest he ask to see what’s under that mask.” He fired back, knowing he'd pushed his limits.
A loud hiss escaped Whitney’s mouth and somehow Steve took that as his chance to brag.
“That-that’s it. Good job. You’re doing great.” The voice above him said shakily and Tony drank more. His head spun with the taste. It was so good!
Something hardened in Steve’s gaze. His blue eyes turned to steel even despite the pain lining his face.
“Ah, you know what? I still haven’t finished-“
“Ah ha, I don’t know about me and heroes, but he’s definitely something.”
“Reed!”
There was no point mentioning it though so Tony just hummed quietly and reached for the torch.
Tony scoffed. “No pressure.”
“Tony!”
Tony feels his body tense at that.
“Put me down!” Tony cried but couldn’t move with Steve’s steel grip around his body. He didn’t let Tony even squirm much, and only dropped him back on his feet about ten minutes later, when they reached the entrance of his block.
It had been a long time since Tony had enjoyed sex like that. Once he’d turned, no human or creature would look at him the same way, and his life had been contained in one place full of strict rules and no place for that.
A shiver runs down his spine. For a second the ice threatens to encroach him again.
With a broad smile, he leaned back in the chair and spread out his arms.
Tears welled in his eyes at the words. He couldn't believe what he was hearing and yet-
Steve’s voice gets thicker. He struggles but doesn’t stop. “You’re gonna be the best of us kiddo. We’ll make sure of it.”
Before Tony could open his mouth to say anything, Happy had quickly turned away and was rushing back to the pavement where the car was parked. Soon enough, the engine purred and Tony was abandoned with only his gift in hand.
In the morning Tony wakes up and feels arms around his waist and feels something for the first time in months. A feeling so strong it almost envelops him and makes him whole.
It left him feeling empty, but relieved. He was relieved for Steve because he knew Steve wouldn’t have to put up with him any longer. At the end of the day, Steve would go back home, knowing full well that Tony was a mistake.
Sucking in a deep breath, Tony pulled them down and stepped out of them, taking off his socks too until he was just standing in his boxers and nothing else.
“We’ll see.” Steve said firmly, looking like he had laser focus and was about to commence the most important mission of his life. Nat on the other hand looked incredibly smug andTony nearly wanted to scream. How did they not get it!?
“Yes uh, just some water please.”
“You like it rough. A little bit of biting, and bit of marking and being held down. And sometimes you want me to give it to you and sometimes you want to fight me. It’s fun and pretty intense.” Ty shrugs like he’s not ashamed to reveal their secrets. “I once remember a time during your heat where I held you down and you took it for hours and-“
"I know. You'd do anything to keep me safe. Including take the blame for a fight we both started." Steve whispered. And suddenly he looked so upset.
He snatched the newspaper page out of Tony's hand and tore it to shreds.
Tony was on him in a flash. Enhanced by the continuous supply of blood in his veins, he used his newfound strength to shove Steve back against the wall. Curling a hand up into Steve’s hair, he guiding his body gently, leaning forward until he was inches away from Steve’s neck. From here the scent roared and filled Tony’s lungs. Vanilla, pine, warmth-all the things that Tony now associated with Steve were there. Tentatively, he licked at the point where the scent was strongest.
“You owed me! Do you know how long it’s been?”
“Oh god, oh god am I-no, I can’t be-“ Suddenly Tony slammed both hands on Steve, shoving him back hard and scrambling away only to almost land in the mess. Quick as lightning, Steve’s arm shot out and curled around him, not letting up even when Tony thrashed, clawing and howling at Steve like an animal. It wasn’t his fault, Steve knew, even as he gritted his teeth and pulled him out of the bed.
It was lucky Steve hadn’t found that too strange. Tony could hardly believe he’d just said something that soppy but he couldn’t pull it back now. Plus it was true.
“Whitney, what on earth are you doing!?” Zeke’s voice echoed and Tony watched as Whitney turned back in horror. Zeke had just approached the door.
There he was in the corner of the tape, furthest away from the growing press. He seemed to be talking to some creature, one that looked similar to a human from this angle, especially in those civilian clothes.
He loved being there. It was the closest thing he had to his old life. And maybe he’d be caught by that werewolf again but at least he’d have something to smile about.
“So you’re telling me,” Steve began, seeming to get heated all over again. “That I nearly lost you over...over what-“
Today was the day he left. He would start work tomorrow, but for today it was just travelling and getting used to his quarters. At least he had a bit of time.
“Ah, the memory issue. Well, it doesn’t matter because I’m going to remind you. You need a full medical exam.”
“Hey Thor? Do you have a soulmate?” He asked, and watched something soften in Thor's gaze.
"Not like those others."
“I have a reputation to uphold too. Mines’ far more important. Trust in me Tony. You won’t be disappointed.”
Once he read it, he met Steve’s eyes. “These are weapon designs. For the Helicarrier.”
Tony wanted to stay here forever. A sad seed of want planted itself in his gut. That sick feeling returned.
Or he used to. Things were not the same anymore.
“Thank you big brother.” The boys said quietly in unison and like they always did, they helped Tony stand and waited patiently as the fog of blood loss slowly vanished. It was a faster recovery than last time. He was getting used to this.
“Them, it’s not-“ Steve sent the door a look that Tony thought was deadly and somewhat unlike Steve. “You need to be based somewhere else.”
Steve sighed and leaned back, stretching his arms across the back of the seats. He crossed his legs and leveled Tony with a solid gaze.
When he turned and looked down from the roof, he saw the man staring back at him with a frown. Then he took a step forward and Tony took that as his cue to leave.
“You’ll get your fill once the father allows it. Ezekiel is fair. You will both be fed soon but you need to behave.”
“Here.” He says and holds out a set of boxers and a shirt Tony’s never seen before. “Try this.”
“Of course.” Tony replied dully, feeling his body start to go numb again.
“Sure. Why not?”
“If you need me Tony, you just need to tell Jarvis. I’ll be right here all night okay? And your suits’ here too.”
Reed is silent as he inspects it. He tilts his head and laughs bitterly.
“You wouldn’t remember but after Osborn took over and you were in a coma, Pepper sent out a call. And we all came. Not just me but Thor and Rhodes and Maria and Natasha-even Dr. Strange was there to help you. Do you know why?”
Does Steve like it up here?
He was paying the price. And he’d left it on such bad terms.
"Mmhmm." Tony smiled tiredly and pressed a kiss to Steve's lips when he leaned closer. "That w's amazing."
because of him?
With a sigh, he gets up from his bed and rubs his eyes so hard they sting. Maybe if he tries hard enough, this one will be the nightmare and the flip side will be the reality.
He bent even closer. “You’re an ingrate. Turning your back on the family to sell yourself to the wolf. I bet you begged for it, didn’t you? Like a little whore.” He snarled and slid his hand into Tony’s hair, pulling his head back so hard, Tony felt strands tear.
been a shock.
“I don’t want any complaints. Talk. Or I’ll talk for you.” And with another clap on his shoulder, Fury let him go and settled into the chair opposite.
“Are you seriously surprised? After everything you’ve done.” Fury said lazily and sat back down, gesturing at Steve. “We both agreed.”
Tony didn’t care. As long as he had space to work in and a guarantee from Steve, he was fine.
He prayed that would work. Even though that was unbelievably pathetic-
He told us alllll about this new vampire he’d met, and how perfect his eyes were and how sharp his jaw line was, and how great he smelled-“
His throat closed before he could speak. It felt wrong to say it and a part of him wanted to disappear through the emergency doors before saying a word about it. How could Fury expect him to actually admit he was...not recommended?
Steve didn’t stop starring at him. In fact, his hands were still hovering over the space where he’d been holding Tony’s.
The library isn't really a library. It's more of a small room with a small seat and a cupboard with books. They feel dusty and forgotten and Tony feels something ache at the thought. It quickly fades however when he takes a seat and fishes out a book.
Carefully, he took a deep breath and smiled. "Yeah. I'm okay, I promise. I just-" Tony looked down and mustered up his courage. "It was a good day. A really good day. I guess I'm just afraid that..."
Robinson managed to crawl under but issued a series of commands, and in the blink of an eye, they were caught off guard.
“Do what?”
"Good. Now get out."
Silently Tony shook his head against Steve's chest and exhaled. Then shakily, he pulled back and looked up.
“Mr. Stark. How are you feeling?” The doctor also asked and walked to the other side of Tony’s bed, picking up a pen light from his pocket to wave in Tony’s eyes. Tony jerked back when the doctor gripped his chin and held him still.
“Oh, and I hope you keep that happier outlook. I can’t wait to enjoy it when I sink my teeth into you. I’m gonna put the mark so high, everyone will see. My own personal prize.” She added sweetly and Tony clenched his fists tightly, walking faster.
“It’s right Tony.” Steve smiled. “You’re a part of this team as much as any of us.”
Grant’s head shot up the instant he heard the word. It had to have come from the man running towards him now at almost god-like speed, and in the distance, Grant noticed him holding his arm out with a large disk attached to it. It seemed to be brightly colored and detached as he lifted his hand up and swung.
Just as he was considering the risks and benefits of telling Whitney he was diseased, he thought he heard a shout. Then, when he followed the sound, it led him to more screaming in the main cavern area. The sight made him pause.
“What-“
“He wants to speak to Stark. We should let him. After all, Stark got a chance to with him.” Reed spits out, jerking a finger at Steve like he’s poison. “After the Registration Act. It’s only fair.”
The silence of the room was pressing. It felt like a growing weight that wouldn’t leave, a heavy feeling on his chest. Tony hated it. The silence that grew so loud it would threaten to drown him and do nothing to hide the ever present fear of bloodlust. There was nothing he hated more except for that final loss of control.
It’s cold. He doesn’t want to think about what it’d be like if it’s colder.
“Yeah. You really do.” And that was enough. Shaking himself out of his stupor, he decided to take the compliment and enjoy it. Everything else about the evening had been abysmal but this had been something at least.
Tony felt his palms start to itch. It was a rare feeling but he hated being the center of attention here. It was the equivalent of getting a target drawn on your back.
Limbs stiff as he walked, he settled in front of Steve and sat down gingerly, taking a deep breath as Steve did the same. Similar to the first time Tony had entered this room, Steve leaned forward and clasped his hands on the desk.
But then Zeke pulled Tony aside and told him the good news.
The soft clip of footsteps caught his ear and when he turned, he recognized who it was. Maria Hill stood before him, giving him a strange look. She was surrounded by four Shield agents of her own and not one of them gave away any expressions. Only Maria’s gaze was scathing.
Okay. So maybe he didn’t like Mr. Stark. He was ashamed to admit it might’ve had something to do with him keeping Iron man away from the mansion too.
Biting his tongue, he tightened his grip on the folders and made his way over as discretely as he could. Ten minutes later, he found himself frozen in front of the door.
At the soft click of the door shutting, Tony turned to say this was a bad idea when all of a sudden-
He’s at the funeral. Steve’s funeral. And it’s loud.
Steve paused and looked at him. “What do you mean?”
“I’ve ordered some more bodysuits for you. Just in case.”
Whitney attempted to protest but Zeke held his hand out, a guarded look on his face. Still, he allowed Norman to pull Tony out of the crowd with a hand and inspect him from the front.
There was nothing in the tower anyway. He’d pretty much lost it all when Osborn had taken over, but then the remaining had been sold to eager buyers and fanatics. He didn’t even know where half of his cars had gone and it wasn’t like his memory was helping him.
“Ha. Definitely. It’s not like they even put effort. I mean look at this table.” Tony huffed, gesturing to the hideous steel table that looked like it’d been taken straight for a high school canteen. At least Peter’s school was better.
He was wearing a jet black suit that had a similar style to Tony’s, only the lines on his wrists were a thin gold. Tony couldn’t see exactly what his cuff links looked like, but they were also gold and glinted in the light. Following down from that, the neat cut suit traced the lines of Steve’s body with a fine hand, showing (but not overtly), his superior strength and muscles. His hair was attractively styled with a little bit of spike and his eyes gleamed in the light.
I have read each and every comment from the previous and I am extremely grateful! It’s late where I am now and I need to sleep because of work but I will reply to each and every comment tomorrow because you guys are SO WONDERFUL AND IT JUST MAKES ME HAPPY!!
“So you think he’s involved with someone else?”
“We must rejoice! I believe a celebration is in order!” Thor explained and stepped closer until his broad arms wrapped around Tony and pulled him into a warm hug.
“TONY! TONY, WHERE ARE YOU!?”
Just then, he felt something hard and flat in his briefcase and pulled it out from under his various clothes and other things. It was the Avengers picture from back home. The one with him and Steve smiling.
“Whitney-“
“It wasn’t Stark. If that’s what you’re wondering.”
“Steve?” Tony asked but Steve just clamped his mouth shut and shook his head, gently turning Tony around until he could see his back. Then he just stopped.
“I can’t lose you. And definitely not because of my actions.” Steve said, voice muffled by Tony’s neck. Tony’s breath hitched when he felt Steve’s lips brush lightly against his skin.
“Here.” The water was placed in front of him. “Drink up.”
“Well, of course, but you need to understand that we have a way we work here-“
Ben was stood in-front, and scowling, but when he met Tony's eyes he faltered. Maybe because he could see how livid he was.
“Reputation Tony.”
It’s strange to imagine.
“As soon as you learn, we’ll get rid of him. He’s out to steal from me but this will show him.”
“I just-.” Steve shook his head and blinked. “I forget you don’t remember. You’ve been director of Shield before. That’s a monumental job and you don’t remember any of it.”
“Whoah.” Stark said faintly and blinked up at him. “What was that?”
“I’m okay. My ears are sore and my head hurts but-“ Steve instantly crawled towards him and cupped his face in his hands carefully, ignoring his surprised gasp. Then, ever so gently, he tilted his face to look at his ears and hair carefully.
Tonight Tony knows he will see him again. And this time, he’s ready.
The doors slid open with a ping and Tony sauntered in, dropping his jacket on the couch in the empty TV room and walked into the kitchen. Inside was Steve, looking damp and flushed from a shower. The wet towel was still looped around his neck and a sports bottle was brought up to his lips.
Steve looked wanton, debauched and so angry, like a man starved and almost maddened with desire. Fire burned in his eyes as he brought his hands up to slip under Tony’s shirt and reached up. One hand began to brush his nipples while the other began to sink lower.
“Oh I don’t.” The blond said quietly, tilting his head just a little. “I just figured you had better balance. Last time you were able to jump in the air like a bird. Generally you need to be quite skilled to do that I thought.”
Zeke grumbled under his breath and raked a hand through his brown hair. It looked like a complete mess.
Shaken from his thoughts, Tony shook his head and looked at the Cap-tsum that had his eyes fixed on his mate. Carefully, Tony set Cap-tsum down and watched as it instantly went towards Iron-tsum and began to circle it carefully, making encouraging peeps and nuzzling Iron-tsum’s sides gently. They were together. A
“You’re controlling him.” Steve commented, letting his eyes catalog Tony carefully.
Within seconds, Tony was spun around and held against Steve’s chest with his mouth just brushing Steve’s collarbone. They were so damn close it made Tony’s head spin.
“I’m not needy. Is it too much to ask for a little more?”
As the night continues to drop in temperature, he feels his body beginning to weaken. It hurts when he shivers and his nose is running and nothing will warm his fingers no matter how hot and cold his cheeks feel-
Any alpha would want Tony Stark this way. He was too beautiful.
Steve just stared at Tony. Then, without breaking eye contact, he bent down and pressed a kiss to Tony’s cheek. Despite the amount of anger coming off from Steve, Tony has never felt him be so tender. His lips brushed his skin and then he pulled Tony into a firm hug. In his ear, he spoke.
“You know what, I’ll call you back. My lunch date is here.” Tony said and cancelled the call before they could be disturbed anymore.
Steve stared up at him in shock. Tony’s beard was looking slightly blurred around the edges. His dark blue suit was seemed to be brand new but when Steve squinted, he could see the faint creases in the material. Tony’s hands shook where they were now hovering around his knees, and his shoulders seemed to fall out of relief on seeing Steve wake up. And Steve could understand why.
Pierce’s eyes sharpened at that. Then he pursed his lips and clicked his tongue with a shake of his head.
There were at least a thousand different ways to interpret that.
“It burns! Oh, god, oh god-“
"Don't you ever get up like that again." Steve heaved a sigh of relief and slid back into his place, running a hand through his hair as he did. "You scared the living daylights out of me."
All thoughts in Tony’s mind froze. It was like someone had poured a bucket of ice over his head and now he could barely speak. Was that what Steve could see? Was that how he was coming across?
Do you know what day it is?” Steve said softly, keeping his eyes fixed on the table between them. If he was affected by what was about to come, he didn’t give any hint of it whatsoever.
Tony is left standing. He’s wearing the same clothes as the last time Steve saw him.
“I won’t be alone.” He insisted, even though he could feel the shadows of doubt growing. His own fears multiplying. “I’ll have Shield and a team-“
. This is stressful enough.” He said quietly, trying to picture any way he could make this better for both of them. He’d only just broken up with her and ironically, the reason hadn’t even been present at the time. Then only days later, Steve had gotten the call from Carol.
“I see.” Norman said and stopped in front of him. His eyes searched Tony’s.
He spotted flashes of Thor and Carol in the thickest smoke, just like Steve had said. Determined, he pushed on and flew towards them, taking out a few robots and helping a few agents along the way.
“You look better now. More color to your cheeks.” The voice, a man whispered softly, and the material under him shifted as the man seated himself beside him. He was on a bed.
“We don’t.” Tony confirmed, tilting the bottle in his hand again. “I found it.”
Tony watched and felt the realisation begin to dawn. Instantly he felt his face burn and his heart begin to race.
They went up the elevator in complete silence. Tony said nothing and so did Steve. There was nothing to say. Just the truth.
. The team would be eating in relative silence and maybe Sam or Bucky or Nat would walk in. Tony would get up within seconds and offer his space to them, calmly,
The next half an hour was spent navigating his way to the labs. He’d learned the route but it took time to get there from the quarters and his little trip to the cafeteria had added to that. All for food he was never gonna get.
“Oh.” Tony said quietly, no doubt thinking about that. “Did they know you were courting me?”
gotten hurt if I hadn’t intervened! Admit it!”
Sometimes he had surreal moments. Ideas of what to do and an uncanny ability to do it. Like the wound stitching and the bunker repairs and the little work he could do to repair his only item of clothing. This strange plated armor and mesh suit of red and gold that seemed to both support and tire him.
“Tell me.” He orders and Reed seems to struggle with an answer. But he does come up with one.
For a minute, Tony watched several emotions flicker in Steve’s eyes. Fear, joy, anger, pride, affection and-
“I’m really so-“
“Tony.” He whispered, feeling his body go cold. His senses felt washed out, like he was about to give out. Only he heard a sound-
“And that Captain. Don’t forget that beast.” Zeke added, tipping his drink into his mouth.
"I'd really, really like to hold you. Please."
“I thought you were there. In that building. I’d gotten a lead and I was gonna talk to you. See if we could talk things over one more time. Then there was an attack and I thought you would get hit.” Steve said lowly, meeting Tony’s watery eyes when they looked at him. “I thought you would get hurt.”
Fear seized his body and mind. In a desperate burst of energy, Grant began to run towards the blue ship.
“Yep. Fine.” Tony mumbled, chewing his nails and hunching forward to stifle his stomach ache.
Steve’s eyes widened. Then they narrowed into thin slits and he leaned back on his feet.
He ignores it and doesn't give the traitors a second glance.
The mission was first priority. He had to get the shield to Steve.
“They’re soulless Carol. Inhumane. What do you expect?” The panel beeps and he walks in. He hears her follow.
“Give me the commanders coordinates. I’m heading in.” He said and after inspecting the lifted up his gauntlets and took aim. He fired and the door swung open helplessly.
Things were going to plan. Tony was hopeful everyone would come out unscathed.
“Thanks for finding you attractive? Or thanks for telling you to hurry up?”
He repeated the mantra over and over in his head, and leaned his head back against the wall with a dull thud.
“I tripped in one of the alleys. And sadly it...reeked.” Tony said, allowing his head to fall.
Standing beside Steve, Tony’s chest was throbbing in a harsh rhythm. Like his heart was trying to beat out of his chest and lava was flowing down his body. It would’ve freaked him out if it hadn’t been for the way his body was dulled.
“You seem very pleased. I bet you’re enjoying the outdoors aren’t you pet?”
If Mr. Robinson was pleased, he didn’t show it. Rather, he just glanced back at his laptop screen and tapped something else out. He didn’t say a word.
The next day had been uneventful. Zeke had requested the details of his excursion in front of Norman and had naturally asked for a full description and Tony spared nothing regarding the blood hunt.
“He’s strong. Resourceful. Will do as told.” Norman added, giving Tony no hint of what was going on.
"Hey team." Tony grinned, and turned around to face Ben and a small group of his friends. Trish and Sam had joined him too. "Long time no see."
“Until this contract is over?” Tony confirmed because he wasn’t about to give himself false hope. What was up with Steve anyway?
“Like a booster shot?” Nat asked, staring at it like it was harmless. Steve wasn’t so naive.
Now that sparked Tony’s interest. And Steve’s too by the looks of it.
“Shhhh, there’s a good boy.” Zeke murmured, stroking his back comfortingly. Somehow, he shuffled them to the bed and sat, Tony not letting go even for a second. He continued to swallow the blood happily, the bright red liquid filling his mouth.
Slowly, he turned on his feet and approached the five shield escorts who were busy mumbling between themselves. It seemed like they’d forgotten about him, when obviously they hadn’t.
“I’m not lying.” Tony promises but Steve scoffs and shakes his head.
“It was.” Tony looked down at the clothes all around him, knowing Steve was smiling now. “The best.”
”It means we’re under attack! Heavy fire!” Ben yelled, suddenly looking terrified as he seemed to search the room for something. Around them, agents left their stations and ran for the doors, including Trish and Sam. Ben however, seemed to be scanning the room sharply, even in the chaos. Then he looked at Tony again and his eyes sharpened.
Dating. They were going to
“You tell me whether we’re going to improve from this. I think we need to talk it out. I want to forgive you and- “Steve swallowed and pulled his hand away. “I want you to forgive me too.”
The pattern of events continued. Steve would lead the team. They’d win. He’d spend time with Iron man. Eat, sleep, repeat.
Symbolism. Someone had once mentioned that at a conference after he nearly fell of the stage. Everything happens for a reason.
“If you need anything, you come to me.”
“They’re not vampires pet. But they’re a group of creatures who claim to restore order to an unjust world. As if they can decide what is right for our kind.” He scoffed, reaching under the table to pull out a glass and a bottle of whiskey. Carefully, he poured out a measure and screwed the cap shut.
“I understand. I hope you can remember that when the time comes.”
"No." She said sharply, looking irritated. "There's no way he'd do that to you."
“Well, not exactly.” Tony said, feeling his hands start to twitch. He slid his hand out of Steve’s and clasped it behind his back.
“You asked for this Captain. This is what you wanted. Don’t come crying to us when you regret it.” Reed says quietly, but the words scream louder than any shout Steve has ever heard from him.
“I thought it would suit you.” Steve continued and Tony listened to him as he pulled the heavy watch from the velvet interior. “It should fit okay. I talked to Happy.”
Maybe they’ll never remember him at all.
“Take your time. I’ll wait.” Steve said casually and settled on the couch, both legs spread and arms sliding along the top of the pillows. His eyes traced Tony’s form and went half-lidded.
That answered his question. It wasn’t his hope talking anymore. This really was Steve. And he really did care.
Tony crouched down, and closed his eyes. The sounds of punching and skin colliding with concrete filled his ears. He honed in on the voice he was looking for.
Rhodey flies him there in record speed. Tony passes out before they even get there. Everything fades to black.
Blood starts to trickle from his nose. And that’s when Tony knows for sure.
would not be told no, not for anything.
“Which home?” Tony murmured quietly, cracking his eyes open as he sighed. He looked out of the window, watching the neon light of the gas station sweep by. Ty was probably gonna scream at him once he got back. Maybe dump him somewhere else.
It gave him once less thing to worry about in the cavern. But there were plenty of other things.
“My team is good but it’s not perfect. I’m always looking for new potential.
Then his eyes snap open and he freezes. Then he closes his eyes again.
“Norman, I’ve already considered it. The answer is no.”
They stared at each other for a full minute. Then-
It took a minute to digest. It couldn’t be right, Tony was sure. He’d seen the papers, he’d woken up that day and been given them first thing, and they’d needed his signature for the post because it was first class.
“Sir, the commander ordered us to make sure you stay here-“
“I knew your dad. He was a sharp one, I tell ya. But he was no good with the connections. Still, he was the smartest man I knew. That we all knew.”
Tony huffed and smiled a little, almost with disbelief. How was this his life? “It’s mine. You know it is.”
His head spun. His world narrowed.
Whitney laughed; the sound of chimes ringing in a silent mansion. “How quaint. You need to do better. You should always please him.”
It’s probably even worse then, that he wishes he were dead. Just so that he could stop feeling altogether.
He paused and strained his ears. That was odd. Steve wasn’t alone.
“Can you give us some time alone please?” Steve asked, giving him a knowing look, and Tony’s head shot up in awe. The doctors seemed just as surprised.
Tony is nothing in comparison. People see him and look the other way.
“His numbers are starting to drop. I’m giving him-“
He’d be selfish one last time.
“What happened? Maria did you-“
“Two whiskeys coming right up. I prefer the hard stuff. Puts the iron in your back.” He said with a wink.
"Have, Tony. Nothing's changed."
The world is spinning.
“This old man troubling you Tony? Don’t let Gabe frighten you, he’s a real softie underneath. Kind of like our Steve.” Dugan ruffled his hair a little and let go, pulling the seat out on Tony’s left. “Troublemakers, the lot of them!”
“Jarvis, is the med team ready?” Rhodey says instantly and though he's angry, he still scents warmth and safety as he picks Tony up and powers his boot thrusters.
“Your temperatures’ coming down. You’ll be okay, that was the worst of it.”
“Hey! I’m nearly done, just a second okay?”
“He called them the
“Oh jeez, don’t look. I’m so sorry Tony, I couldn’t help it.” Steve groaned tiredly, scrubbing at his face harshly. His cheeks were bright red; hot with shame.
“Shellhead?”
HAVE A SOULMA-“
Tony’s heart sunk at that. It was a sore spot for him and one he’d really struggled with. He owed it to everyone to try.
No one had touched him in so long. He hadn't felt this in a long time.
So he’d lost his killer streak. But maybe it was worth it.
”We made a pup. We have a baby.”
“Mister Stark, I believe we have hundreds of workers on board. I’m sure some of them are capable of smoldering wires or assembling missiles, or even completing the designs. This is a spy base after all.”
"It'll be here in the office. Finish signing the papers, I'll be back soon."
“It’s your smell.” He explained, feeling Tony pause his squirming and freeze like a deer in the headlights.” You and him. You both smell ...”
Shame and frustration coated every inch of Tony’s body. He was trying. That was all he could do, wasn’t that clear enough?
Distantly Tony started to wonder if he should be more concerned. He was Ironman, an ex-Avenger with a belief in the future. He was the futurist on the team, after all.
"I'm real." Steve says and his eyes burn into Tony's very soul. He looks angry and he's shaking now, looking ready to sprint. "You haven't taken anything. I'm alive."
Dugan chugged his drink and more or less slammed the glass down. “Shush boy. None of that talk. These morons are ridiculous. Back in the day, Cap would’ve taken them out back. Hi, Nick, how’re you doing?”
“Oh, well! It was phenomenal, wouldn’t you agree?” He clapped his hands, looking at Norman once again.
He hopes so. Maybe he’s just imagining it now and that wouldn't surprise him with how exhausted he feels.
Did everyone know Steve better than he did? Did they all know how to calm him down and say the right thing and just put their hands on him and tell him to breathe?
Steve croaks and shakes his head. "I was too late. I was too
“As if my omega wants anything from you.” Ty rolls his eyes and waits for Tony to go first. Soon enough they reach his bedroom and Tony lets them in.
This...this didn’t even come close to heroism.
“Why’s that?”
The human groaned as he slumped and Tony loosened his collar. Pressing two fingers to the human’s throat, he sighed and stood up.
Steve looked at him in surprise. “No?”
“Tony won’t be here for much longer. If you have anything you wish to say, now is the time.” Reed says and stands up, pushing his chair out with a soft screech. When he looks back at Steve, it’s full of pity and regret.
“Heya cappuccino. How’s it going?” Tony smiled as he placed all the coils on his workbench. There were plenty.
"Yeah. I guess Steve-the commander must've filled it out for me." Tony replied and stuck his hands in the hoodie pockets. "Just a little break. Nothing to worry about."
“Well in that case...” Dugan seemed to make his decision. He leaned back and crossed his arms casually.
That was a close one. Screamers were bad because they drew unnecessary attention from the wrong creatures and drove other humans away from the source. Tony would need to try the other alleys for a while.
“No, she‘s fine! Honestly they’ve not said a word to me, I promise!”
“So what’s on the menu tonight? Star Wars? I vote Star Wars.” Tony butt in, cutting off that conversation with a flashy smile. It did the job because Steve immediately stopped and Nat just stared at him.
Sliding into the seat, he pulled the black briefcase close and inspected it. There was a shield logo imprinted on the top but otherwise it was pretty box-standard. Flicking the latches up, he gripped the top and slowly pulled it open.
He couldn’t have heard that right,
Before the SHRA, Steve had cared about him a lot and had always been there, always. As in, he’d always make sure he was okay after attacks, would always bring him food and ask him for meals every day, and hell when they had been living together in the mansion, Steve would always train him. Lots and lots of physical training.
“I-I’m good thanks.“
“You’re not any alpha. You’re...you wouldn’t hurt me...” Tony said quietly, and Steve felt something dampen his shirt.
They’d only just started talking after all. About the SHRA and everything.
The door hissed shut behind him, leaving him in the empty lab. The sirens continued to blare.
“Oh no, no need for that.” Robinson said casually, waving away the idea. “I am interested. After all who wouldn’t be?”
Beside him, Steve cleared his throat and stretched his arms out.
“How was your mission, my lord?” Tony asked politely, clasping his hands behind his back while he waited for Zeke to turn. His shoulders loosened a fraction when saw the look of delight in Zeke’s eyes.
Ducking under the ledge of his home, he snuck in and quickly grabbed the small sack he had stitched together with a sewing needle and string he had. He’d found it in a tin in the bunker, back when he’d just woken up and found himself covered in cuts and bruises. He’d had to use the needle stitch his own wounds at some points.
“Any...mates?”
On seeing Tony, Pierce lifted his hand and waved.
Tiredly he looks back down at the photo. A face he no longer recognizes.
When he looks up, he can see Rogers looking stricken. Ty just looks upset.
There was pin-drop silence for a moment. Then he heard Steve's chair scrape the floor. Footsteps approached until-
It took exactly one ring for Maria to pick up.
Tony knew what he was referring to. He’d never pictured himself in Steve’s shirts either.
"Hope. New beginnings. A future." Steve smiled, watching Tony's eyes widen. "We may not be there yet but I have a chance. To prove myself to you. If you let me."
“Why not?” Steve felt the smile slip off his face as he inched a little closer. “Do you think it’ll affect my feelings for you? It’ll only make me feel more.”
“What?”
“So what about you? I hear you’re a journalist.” Tony asked politely, and the minute he did, he knew he’d won the kid’s approval, especially when his mandible hung open for a few seconds.
Steve nodded as he listened. "You're definitely concussed. It looks old. How long have you been here?"
“Hmm Janice right? She’s a sweet old gal isn’t she?” Steve suddenly stopped and turned to Tony and smiled.
And what a world it was. The familiar stench of Manhattan streets permeated the air and the tired groans of creatures returning home late could be found in all corners. Street lights directed the paths clearly but several flickered whenever some bats and birds swooped past, and cabs horned at each other in the distance. Tony recalled seeing a billboard that said
wrote for him to read.
“ETA five minutes. Everyone prepare for suits. Thor and I will go out first as agreed.”
When he looked at the lamp-posts, he didn’t feel anything anymore. Instead, his heart sank lower into his gut, and he felt an even stronger urge to throw up.
“That’s enough.” He whispered, and felt a gush of air leave his chest when they thankfully pulled away. His eyes threatened to close and the cold stone floor seemed like a tempting place to rest. But he couldn’t. Ezekiel could return any minute.
It was the very definition of military. It was borderline prison in Tony’s mind. A large room with rows of bunk beds and nothing else. Simple steel flooring and plain white sheets. There were pairs of lockers between each bunk bed for each inhabitant but other than that, there was nothing.
“I’m so sorry. I don’t want to hurt you, I never did.”
“You’re not going anywhere near him.” Steve cut him off sharply and started the engine. “Not in this state. Hell, I’m worried you’ll catch a cold and get sick the way you’re going. You need a bed and sleep. I’m taking you home.”
“You know my orders are just. Don’t you? Anthony?” Zeke’s hand slipped further back into his hair.
As Tony skulked through the corridors, he continued to play back the conversation in his mind. For all that Zeke claimed he did, not once was he willing to let Tony prove himself, even though Tony was certain he’d been playing his part well. Though maybe he had Whitney to blame for this. His life would be absolutely miserable when he bonded with her.
There was a red carpet rolled out all the way to the entrance and the sides were brightly lit with lights and glitzy dresses and smart pressed suits. Cameras clicked and lights flashed and instantly Tony remembered some of the red carpet events he’d attended in his life. This was normal. This wasn’t new.
“Why? What Tony and I do is none of your-“
Tony started to cry, tears streaming quietly down his face as his body quaked and writhed against his will. He grimaced but didn’t do much else, waiting with eyes full of resignation as Steve reached for his hand.
“I know.” Tony forced a smile. “It won’t happen again, I didn’t know any better.”
And with that, they began their long journey home.
“I’ve been a useless host.” Steve said firmly, letting his eyes trace Tony carefully. “Here I am, with one of the most amazing people I know, and I haven’t even sat down and talked to them yet. Not properly at least.”
Silence filled the space between them. Steve didn’t say a word to that. All he did, was take a deep breath and nod with tight lips.
Tony took a deep breath and focused his gaze just passed the man’s shoulders. “I need your help.”
“It’s so...” Tony lifted up a hand and waved it around until Steve caught it. “So easy.”
A shudder ran down his spine. He felt cold and hot at the same time like he had a fever.
"Of course. Go for it."
Zipping up his hoodie (Steve’s dark blue hoodie), he pulled on his boots and slipped out of Steve’s room.
To put it simply, he was glowing.
Earlier, he’d spotted a couple wearing Christmas hats. They’d been sharing a hot chocolate and giggling at a small family in front of them.
Tony wondered if he’d imagined the slight disdain.
“I have some assignments on the tablet there for you. Just give them a read and work your way through. When you’re done, come find me.”
“104 degrees. I’ll prescribe something, provided you promise not to take it alone. And you need to rest so I’m going to have you take some time off. No work for at least three weeks. I’m sure your doctor has already mentioned-“
He had the exact same mark but it was just as big and almost completely covered his back. It started past his shoulder blades and encompassed his whole back, diving down into the small of his back. It was huge. It was
Alpha of the pack. Alpha of the omega.
I’M ALIVE AND STILL KICKING! ITS BEEN TOO LONG, HOW ARE YOU ALL?!
Thankfully he didn’t have to. Steve smirked and reached around him, starting the ignition again. He revved it once more, leaning over Tony again. Then he pulled away and sat down, glancing over his shoulder.
A moment passed and Tony briefly tried to picture a way in which he could just run without being mocked for the rest of his life when-
Steve gave him a bright smile showing an impressive row of sharp teeth with blood dripping down his furry chin. His lupine features emphasized how shockingly happy his eyes were. The gold was brighter than ever.
Both served Steve's purpose.
“Yes you were.” Tony blinked and took a step forward, feeling his lips curve up. “You were.”
“It’s mine too.” Steve added quietly and walked until he was right behind him. “All of it.”
“No, don’t. He doesn’t need the trouble.” Tony said quickly, knowing he’d been caught red-handed. Funny, he didn’t think he could still feel shame.
“You’re going on another excursion?” Tony’s head shot up, even though he knew what it meant. He’d be forgotten again.
“Director on deck!”
“Yeah. Me too.”
Slowly he brings his wrists closer and lets his fingers brush the edges of Steve’s cowl. He shouldn’t, he knows.
As things started to fade, he heard Steve say one thing. Tony thought he almost sounded sad.
“Hey. What’s going on?” Steve said with what he hoped was a pleasant smile. Having worked with him for a short time however, they instantly seemed to pick up on how fake it was. Natasha simply shook her head and sighed.
Heat began to pool in Tony’s stomach. Like molten lava churning and boiling him from the inside. Steve just made him so
It was a private room though. The same one he or any of the Avengers were put in for injuries. It was a simple room with a window and a TV. And of course, the medical equipment and the highest security to get in.
Maybe minutes passed. Maybe an hour did. But he stayed there, eyes facing up and simply breathing the air in. Maybe he could stay here forever and the world would just let him.
“I wish you’d stand up for yourself more Shellhead. He can’t keep sending you off without giving you a break.”
A part of him longed to say something more. And just offer a soft touch to Steve’s shoulder, and maybe just ask him what was wrong. In another universe where Steve and him were close, maybe he’d even pull him aside to ask what he could do to help, like a friend would.
“Absolutely none.” Steve confirmed and after a moment of hesitation, he pulled Tony into a hug.
They were
“No, I got it.” Tony snapped, and snatched the napkin out of the bastard’s hand to wipe at the stain hastily.
The woman paused, giving Tony a chance to inspect her. Her hair was white and cut short, and her body was small and hunched over from the loss of strength to her spine. Her feet shuffled from side to side, distracting him from her plain civilian clothes and her sharp brown eyes darted from his hands to his face.
“Fine.” Tony blinks and smiles at Steve and then the baby. “Look, he’s kicking.”
“Mr. Stone. Tony is exhausted and he needs to rest. You better leave before I make you. I won’t repeat myself.” Steve says and suddenly he’s right beside Ty and has his hand fisted into his collar and has-
Tony screamed so loudly that Steve’s hands instantly shot up to cover his hypersensitive ears. Obviously the minute he did that, the omega shot up from where he was lying to reach for Steve’s belt around his waist. Thankfully Steve clamped his hands down around Tony’s instantly and didn’t let go until Tony jerked his head up at him and snarled, teeth bared and eyes wild.
He understood. It had been incredibly tough to decide who would see Tony through his heat but in the end, the choice had been obvious.
His lips tasted like iron. His limbs were shaking.
Today was the same as every other day. Tony got up. Waited for Ben and Tyler to say something to him-today it was something about his shit coding and that apparently, he needed to rewire the missiles again. For the third time this week.
“They’re not listening.” Jeremy sighed and stood up behind them and reached for his jacket. “Call me when you’re done Tony. C’mon Josh.”
“Anthony?”
“This boy...” Dugan flicked his eyes up at Steve. “You’re sure?”
He kept his eyes closed, just relaxing and allowing himself to sink into the soft warmth, wondering why he was struggling to open his eyes so much.
“What do you think?”
“Sort of. I kind of run my own special unit and these guys are part of it. We work pretty closely with the police though.”
Tony jolts sharply on the bench and looks to his right. The stranger is stood right above him and-
“Oh but you are.” Tony didn’t like the gleam in his eye. “You are and you have to. You don’t have a choice.”
“Steve, looks like you’ve made a friend.” Tony chuckled and pointed at the little Cap tsum who was staring at Steve like he’d taken his favourite toy.
When Tony looked back up, he noticed Steve staring at him carefully. He was leaned over the table and resting his chin over his joint hands, but his eyes were solely fixed on Tony.
Steve did not rise to it. He simply tilted his head and raised a brow.
The sound of steps entering grew louder. The man was getting closer. Odd how heavy those footsteps were.
After some time however, he hears a knock on the door. With a soft groan, he blinks his eyes open and rolls over. It's quiet for a moment but then the knocking starts again and he pulls the duvet over his head and ignores it, feeling a pit in his stomach. No one can know what he’s about to do. Come morning, no one will see him like this again.
He’d screwed up. From the second he’d decided to support the SHRA he’d ruined everything. Like one big snowball, his life was tumbling down.
Carol didn’t call him out on it. She didn’t bother. She only asked one thing.
Steve’s nostrils flared. “You sent them to me first. I didn’t start this.” He stated firmly, finally lifting his eyes up to meet Tony’s. They were dark and stormy and looked ready to wage war.
“I just...” Sharon sighed and leaned back in her chair, folding her arms as she glanced at the crowd. “You know Steve.”
people being late. He’d always hated it when the team had run late and he was always early himself. Tony couldn’t say he was the best at time-keeping, especially with labwork and spending time on the armour, but he always tried to be punctual, if just for Steve’s sake.
He wants that. What Steve describes. He aches for it.
“Yup.” Steve grinned and glanced at the pile too. Dumbfounded, Tony did the same, as if that would offer some explanation. “That’s why I was so angry. I had to hurry you up, otherwise you’d notice.”
“Steve-“
"Whether you choose to use it or not is up to you. I can't force you. But at least one of your suits should be here in case something happens."
“I sent nothing to you.” Steve repeated blankly, and this time it came out monotone. Tony distantly registered Steve sounding like he was in shock, but he was too wrapped up in his own mountain of problems to deal with it.
“It’s...” He can’t say it, he can’t, he can’t-
“What’re the odds.” Steve said calmly with a closed off expression, only when he looked over at Jeremy he frowned just a tad.
“What?”
“Then?”
In his arms, Tony’s shoulders shook but no noise came out and somehow, the feeling of Tony's fingers trying to find purchase in his suit made the whole situation so much worse. Feeling his heart plummet, Steve hugged him even tighter.
“You’ve just suffered a severe case of bond shock. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about Mr. Stark. In fact when I-“
Steve talks about the little things. Like what he likes to eat and what they laughed about the first time Steve brought food for him in the lab. What he usually does when he comes home after meetings and how Steve usually meets him for movies nights which usually end up as hot steamy make-out sessions which Tony manages to pry a few details out of Steve.
“You’re not some big shot anymore.” She said, tightening her grip on the remote like she wanted to break it. “You may act it, but you’re not an Avenger anymore. And you aren’t Ironman. You’re nothing. Time to own up to it.”
There were no more pretenses. No more games. They were here to kill him.
Steve looked up at him and smiled.
Tony blinked at him. Was he talking about his armor?
“Take it off-“
The gunfire was dying out. He thought he could hear Steve shouting.
“Security.”
“Boy?” Gabe said quietly with a knowing look, and the furrow of his brow started to loosen. “Are you alright?”
Slowly Ty’s voice fades. It’s just him and Cap walking towards his bedroom and suddenly-
Only then he pulled back with a soft gasp and took a deep breath. Tony struggled to gather his thoughts while Steve looked at him and shook his head.
“Yeah, I got that.” Tony snapped tiredly but couldn’t stop looking at Steve. The soldier seemed just as fixated on him and suddenly Tony wanted a moment alone with him. Even just a few minutes to talk.
"Oh, wow." Tony breathed and panted at the sight. Steve had just torn his suit off him with one hand, leaving him in nothing but the white boots that were made for him. Even the straps had come away.
The last of his funds are gone. He has nothing left.
“Steve-“
“Oh, no, please don’t be afraid little guy.” Tony whispered softly, feeling his heart break when the tiny being began to peep softly almost like he was crying. The creature was frozen with fear and wasn’t any bigger than a small potato. How would it defend itself?
A few feet in front of them stood Zeke and Tiberius. Behind them were Whitney and Norman and a few other masked vampires. Blood covered all their body armors like war paint. They'd stocked up.
“I can never leave you.” Steve says lowly, not letting himself look away. “Where you go, I go.”
“Like home.” He breathed and smiled happily. He could stay like this for a long time.
Reality had started to sink in. And yet somehow the dream had still been easier to cling onto.
“You wouldn’t dare.”
“Mr. Robinson, it’s good to see you.”
Tony gasps and feels his eyes widen. “St’ve?”
The floor felt like it had left Tony’s feet. How could he have been so careless?
“Hey!”
Something sank low in the pit of his stomach. He’d never move on. Maybe he never could.
Appointment? He didn’t have anything except a meeting at one.
“I-you said...”
Tony couldn’t help it. The situation, the complete weirdness of Steve, it drew something out in him and his lips twitched.
” Steve blanched and Tony sighed and looked away, feeling lower than dirt.
“Yeah. Yeah. It’s good to have you back.” Steve swallowed and started to blink rapidly, feeling for all the world like he really had let Tony down. How had he let the man he loved, fall into the hands of that-
People didn’t like him. That was the point, and that was what he was dealing with here.
Three weeks went by. Nothing changed. Nothing got better and nothing got worse. Life on the Helicarrier was turning out to be fairly uneventful, even after Steve's little display.
“You mean Captain America? That’s him?” Jeremy gasped and tried to look up to catch a glimpse which was just great. Tony didn’t need Steve coming in and upstaging him. This was bad enough as it was.
“Anything?”
for Steve to knot him flooded his mind. The way Tony had looked, the way he’d been so scared, something no one but Steve had ever seen on the great Tony Stark...
“I’d hardly say that’s fair, Mr. Stark.”
“Don’t do this-“
“Have you...?”
Feeling his cheeks heat with his new found blood, Tony rolled his eyes. “No. You’re too wolf-y.”
“I must’ve changed the course when I changed in Afghanistan. That must’ve been the reason.” Tony sighed and turned to look out of the window again. The rays painted a code of color around the room, and in the center, Steve stared back at him.
He felt like he was gonna be sick.
At once, the robots surged forward. All of the ones the agents had been dealing with turned towards them and began to close in on them. It didn’t take Tony long to realize the giant one was doing the same.
He begins to crawl forward towards them. It’s not dignified but who gives a shit because-
They were in the Commanders deck. His own private office. Probably the only place with any privacy on this plane. The clearance level for this had to be through the roof.
“Nothing happened.” He said through a forced smile. “Everything’s fine.”
“Come this way Mr. Stark.”
Oh, and his body. Jeremy had a slimmer frame with far less muscles and more cushioning. That was nicer to relax on, not like when he’d lie on Steve’s stomach. Steve was built like a tank-all stone, no cushion. Tony still remembered being able to feel each ab underneath his cheeks.
freeze in his hold. “I didn’t even consider until now. But-” He took another deep breath. “That makes perfect sense.”
“It’s a shirt I gave you during your heat. One of your favorites.” Rogers says from across the room and Tony hates that he instantly loves the way it feels and smells on his skin. Apples and vanilla again. Seriously, what alpha smells of
Tony felt his throat go dry. The weight of the bag he’d brought was just that much heavier. Was this what really where he was going to sleep? His armor couldn’t even fit between these bunk beds.
He nodded eagerly, feeling Zeke’s harsh stare on him. “Of course. I wouldn’t even consider an alternative.”
Steve was...he was...
So he wandered the streets of Manhattan at seven in the morning, taking a seat on an empty bench to stare at the lifeless world.
“Yes sir. It’s the standard set address. Everyone on a mission is issued a title.”
“Shhhh, you’re okay. We’ve been searching for some time. As soon as we clocked onto your coordinates, we began the retreat. The others are coming, I’ve already sent a signal.” Steve said and pressed his lips to Tony’s hair. "You're going to be okay, we'll deal with it, whatever it is."
The earlier encounter with the science department didn’t sit well with him. Since that blatant rejection of his invite, he’d kept his distance, heading straight to his corner to tap away at one of his tablets, but he’d kept playing it back in his mind.
“I never sent you a thing.” Steve said with a dangerously quiet voice. His face was totally blank. “Not a goddamn thing.”
“Barnes.” Tony murmurs and stands from his desk. Carefully, he slides open a draw and takes hold of the letter-the one Steve’s lawyer gave him.
“That’s Peter. He’s a budding journalist although the guy he works for is an idiot. Keeps making fun of my outfit. Although maybe you’d get on with him.” Steve chuckled, shaking his head lightly.
Somehow Tony didn’t like the way this guy was sounding. Something about the wording put him on edge.
“You’re Iron man. I can tell.” Steve repeated and suddenly he was hit with the realization that he had worked it out. He had
He hopes Steve will remember him. He thinks of Steve everyday.
Together, they left the bike and walked towards the restaurant. It didn’t look like a typical joint but at the same time...
It wasn’t okay. He couldn’t allow that, even if it was probably (definitely) true.
“...Uh...”
Tony spoke before he could really think.
A hand settled on his shoulder, hesitant at first but then firmly curling its fingers around him. Then it slid around him and pulled him close into a warm body. Tony’s chin brushed Steve’s shoulder gently and he felt a hot breath in his ear.
He wasn’t smiling. In fact, he almost looked angry.
The grey dusty smog is gone. It’s bluer and more fresh than ever. And sounds come back to him in slow waves but it doesn’t sound like there’s danger.
Another battle cry appeared and Thor, the mummy Steve had mentioned and had shown him, the one he’d seen in that photo Steve had up in his apartment-
“Stark, what did he say to you?” Fury tried but Tony didn’t really want to say much. He just stared at the table decor. The lights that gleamed and dance a little around the center.
He’d been on this planet for as long as he could remember. Or at least he believed so.
A predatory look appeared on his features then and he smirked a little. “Anthony. Tony?”
A cough sends him reeling. His chest aches under the force and threatens to overwhelm him. It’s late and his coughs echo in the street.
Well that cleared that up. He huffed and tossed the phone on the table, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms. He squinted at Steve.
Feeling his fangs press against his lips, Tony opened and closed his fists. He took a silent breath and checked his surroundings.
Steve huffed but didn’t argue it. Instead he focused on the negotiation. “What is it you need?”
Tony coughed and pressed his arms close around his chest.
“How...” He looks up at Steve hopefully and watches Steve take a shuddery breath.
Tony twitched when Steve’s hands tightened. What had happened to his shirt? Where was it when he needed it?
“You want to hear what he has to say? Sure. Sure, of course. We will arrange it.”
“You’re more too.” Tony found himself saying and Steve just shook his head and reached for his pencils.
“Well.” Tony blew out a breath and stood up slowly. “I think it’s time I leave. You know where to find me. If you change your mind that is.”
“I’m done.”
Everything fades away. Tony feels his heart stop.
“Stark?” Maria’s voice sounded distant. “Pay attention.”
“No way.” Steve said after a moment and shook his head, and even Maria scoffed. “You’re not coming.”
“You know I could have you arrested? Right here. All I’d have to do is make one call and that would be it.” Tony said darkly and reached into his pocket to hold up his phone. “One call.”
By the time he got back, it was late. The dark dim alleys of the city reached out to him like hands, almost waving at him to join them. New York was always dim at that time of night but for some reason the world felt particularly colder on this night. In an unusual show of humility, Tony left the nameless chauffeur a few blocks away from the tower and decided to walk it, feeling like he needed the fresh air.
Tony ran his fingers through his hair and blew out a breath. What were they missing?
“What brings me here is the fact that its six in the morning and you guys are watching a film while some of us are trying to get some sleep. I had a long day yesterday so I’d really appreciate it if you could-“
He didn’t know what they were but he knew when they came. Every other sunset, when the blue sun was farthest away, they’d arrive in gleaming red ships, just like his own, only instead of just having a small piece of it, they had the full ordeal. Heavy duty metal ships that flew through the sky on repulser based energy, and had blinding lights that seemed staggering even from a distance.
“No, you don’t need to-“
Steve’s face went blank. Tony dropped the papers and cut himself, hissing at the sharp sting.
“Sorry.” He murmured, looking away and stamping on the burning feeling of his cheeks. It couldn’t really get worse, he figured. He was disgraceful that he kept thinking this way when Steve was just trying to get the job done. And Tony knew he was a handful.
Steve notes. The faint smell of iron hits his nose. Feeling his body start to shake, he looks down at the body in his arms.
Did Steve really care about him? Even
Gunfire. And a lot of screaming.
“Are you hurt?” Steve said and Grant...Tony looked up to face him.
It was just him and Steve. No one else...
“Please stop.” Tony breathes and places a shaky hand over his stomach again. There’s barely a bump but still...
“Yes.” And despite his nerves, a slow smile grew on his face. Tony could still recall how nice Steve had felt. How hot and firm and full he'd made him feel.
Tony rubbed at his face tiredly. “Yes.”
“You mentioned you went to MIT.” Steve powered on, completely ignoring him. “That’s a human only institute. Vampires don’t age quickly I hear and you look about my age so I’m guessing you’ve been a vampire for about ten years.”
-is standing in that same long trench-coat that hides almost everything. But now Tony can see the hint of the star from his uniform peeking under the coat, and the red boots that Tony is all too familiar with on his feet.
Strange chokes over his sobs and doesn’t continue-he
“How about my tastes in bed? What do I like?” He smirks and hears Rogers groan.
“I know you did something. I know Tony was okay when I left. You better get out and hope I never see you again otherwise if I find out you caused this, well.” Steve huffs but from what Tony can see, his body is taut as a wire and Ty’s face is pale. “I’ll destroy you. Believe me, I won’t hesitate.”
“He should be seen to. Otherwise things could go south fast. And you both need to talk.”
Strange and Reed look at each other. Finally Reed answers.
Well. Him and Steve would’ve been together at least. That’s what he’d first thought when Pepper had told him. He hadn’t mentioned it to her. Some things were best kept under lock and key.
“Come in, Anthony.”
“Sorry, are you seriously gonna tell us that your beauty sleep is more important than what we all want to do? You gotta be kidding me.”
“Uhh what are you doing?” Tony asked hesitantly, resisting the urge to bite the hand like a newborn.
Too soon Steve pulled away but didn’t let go of him and instead just looked at him with a trace of fear in his eyes. But there was a brightness to them that showed how happy he was too.
Sighing, Tony picked up his phone in one hand and kept the other pressed firmly over his abdomen. He could wait. It was fine.
Finally they arrive and Tony feels the exhaustion starting to catch up. His body throbs tiredly and his stomach twists with worry. What if he’s making the wrong choice? What then?
Approving, Steve nodded his head and gestured back to the bench. Tony accepted the invite and sat back down.
They fell into a thick silence again. For a moment, Tony could just picture it. The grass under his shoes, the sound of his Audi turning the corner. The phone in the car seat starting to ring just as he’d pulled out-
Steve glanced at Tony’s hand and met Tony’s eye. Then he swallowed and unlinked his hands. Tony was shocked when he saw them shake slightly.
Tony tried not to look too smug as he broke the news. That was until he saw the sheer fury in Steve's eyes.
omega?” Rogers grits his teeth. “Who the hell do you think you are, telling me Tony’s not my omega? You better get out before I rip your head off.”
The evening was effectively ruined, as far as he was concerned.
“You never killed him. If anything, you killed yourself first.”
The questions he wants to ask are simple. What’s changed, where is he now? What’s happened to the company, why is he now fighting Hydra agents with a team of superheroes when he’d been declared a consultant?
When Tony finally arrived, he was greeted by a young man with brown hair and brown eyes who wore a white labcoat that had a badge with the name Tyler on it. He hadn’t stood out to Tony at any of the times that he’d spoken to the group, but after Ben and Sam and Trish, Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to meet anyone else.
“Steve Rogers. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.” Tiberius said, surprisingly, especially considering how he had no business with Steve whatsoever.
Steve pulled Tony’s hand away from his neck and rubbed his nose against the mark gently. Then a spark appeared in his eye and he yanked Tony against him, snaking a hand into his hair to kiss Tony hard. The rough clash of Steve’s canines against his fangs made Tony gasp in surprise and that gave Steve the perfect opportunity to slip his tongue in, like he’d done all those many nights ago.
“I know. I-” Steve sighed and paused, waiting for Tony to stop too.
. Either way, he couldn’t really say much to that.
"Stark, wait." Steve ordered, and Tony turned to see him standing over the desk with narrow eyes.
For once, Tony was completely speechless.
When he opens them, everything is still except for the snow. The man is gone and it’s only him again. And this time-
“He used to say Stark men are made of iron. And you know how I felt that day? Like crap. No iron, or nothing. Just crap. Because that’s all I had from him. I never got more. Thanks to your friend.” Each word was a carefully formed dagger that he aimed directly at Steve’s heart. It was only fair, he thought. Steve should suffer too.
He would go towards it. Perhaps there was a being he could be allies with. Someone to maybe keep him company.
he chanted.
“Yeah.” Steve whispers and reaches out to take his hand under the blanket. Steve’s hand feels warm and so much like home around his and suddenly Tony can remember all the times someone would turn away and not even spare him a second glance.
“Tony Stark.” She smiled and held out her hand and yeah, he liked her already. “I know who you are.”
“Yeah. Be carefully Tony.”
Tony pulled back and met Zeke’s eyes. “I’m not a monster.”
“You were human weren’t you? And no human wants to be a creature.”
“Steve, look out!”
“Tony-“
Some unknown force seized him. Before he could even think, he was pushing himself up, despite the pain and reaching out.
Sharon was looking so unsure. Like he’d tell her she wasn’t good enough when that was obviously untrue. How could he tell someone like her that? He’d be lying because he knew what wasn’t good enough. Or more specifically who.
Tony had always figured that he would be the one to go down on Steve first. It never once occurred to him that Steve would want to do the same for him, let alone make him cum first.
“Not for spiders no. I prefer the more humanoid types.” Steve said lightly, scanning the small group for someone else.
Before Maria could continue, Tony jumped up from his seat. There was no way in hell he was gonna sit here and listen while they just-
“Babe-“
“Tony, have a seat. You look like you need a moment.”
“It’s also your favorite color.” He smiles and then straightens it out and wraps it around Tony’s shoulders, allowing the scent to flood Tony’s senses and make him feel so warm.
“Perfect.” Tony noted that Steve seemed especially pleased, and mentally patted himself on the back. “I’ll be there soon.”
“I was k-kidnapped?” The idea was horrific. Was that why he had been covered in so many wounds when he’d first woken? Was that why he had incomplete parts of things?
Steve was standing there with his back to Tony holding the shield high in front of their bodies. A few feet away, five agents were collapsed on the tarmac with multiple bullet wounds.
“Sir, you may enter now.”
“Wolves need a full moon to turn. How are you gonna make me howl now? Tony-” Steve implored and suddenly stepped right into his space. “What are you gonna do?”
Instead of answering, Reed blinks and turns back round. He continues to tinker like nothing’s changed and yet, everything’s changed.
“I nearly lost you over a set-up. When we could’ve had another chance.” Steve says coldly, and there’s an icy jaded sharpness to his voice that Tony’s never heard before.
It was almost surreal. In the last thirteen moon cycles, Grant had not seen a single thing like it. With that, he lowered his hands from his perch and nodded.
They had about four hours of driving ahead of them to get to Washington but thankfully that was more than enough time for Tony to compose himself. He needed it.
Stern looked shocked for a moment. Even his little pack did too. But then they started to mumble to each other.
All of a sudden, Ty stops stirring and looks at him. A shiver runs down his spine at the look.
It doesn’t make any sense.
“Well.” Pierce sounded tight-lipped, and really, it was the only reaction Tony could see him having. “For what it’s worth, I think you’re an excellent Avenger. I mean, no one is Captain America, sure. But you’re exceptional Stark.”
Tony closed his eyes and felt his mind relax. For once it was empty which was a complete blessing considering his state.
Ben rolled his eyes and tossed a tablet from under the table in front of Tony.
, he sees Steve’s eyes filled with tears and fear and roaring pain.
So, taking a deep breath, Tony stood and stretched, holding his arms above his head and loosening the cricks. Then, he waited as always for a perfect victim.
“He’s a good one isn’t he? Honestly, the best choice.” Pierce beamed, pulling Tony close and Fury eyed the gesture but didn’t comment on it. Instead, he fixed Tony with a concerned look.
“You need to be more specific Steve.” He said blandly, rolling his eyes when Steve just nodded.
and looks around to see if Steve has reappeared.
A shiver runs down Tony’s spine but he can’t help but nod.
The obstetrician ponders that for a moment and then her eyes grow pinched.
But Tony didn’t give in. “You can’t mean that-“
What had happened? What was Steve talking about?
"Yes sir!" Tony said and for the first time in weeks, felt brighter for it.
He took a few moments to gather his things. Methodically, he put his clothes on one side of his suitcase, and his shoes on the other. But as he swept his hand under the bed, his hand scraped against something sharp.
It was a cop. Off-duty, but Tony could see his belt with weapons. A tall, really well-built cop with a gun and weapons and-
“You shouldn’t.” Reed says bluntly, and that catches Steve off guard. “But you don’t need to worry. I won’t use it. I never could.” He says, suddenly turning to the ground as if he hoped it would swallow him whole.
“Mr. Stark. Have you ever sparred before?”
He stopped chewing. “What?”
“I thought you hated it.” Tony said quietly and exhaled shakily when Steve pulled him off his lap gently.
“Tony!” Steve gasped and instantly pulled Tony back up, gripping him tight by his shoulders. Tony froze in his grip, feeling stunned.
. Since he was back in uniform, it made sense.
Steve’s hands clench. Vines slide over his hard and squeeze so hard it burns. The thorns dig in and feel like agony.
While he could hear Steve ordering his men to scour the area, he tapped open the details from the investigations as well as some of the camera footage again.
His body screamed in protest as he began to cough and suddenly he found himself smiling.
Rogers scrubs his face with his hands and swallows. “You are my omega Tony. Don’t let him take you away from me. From what we built together.”
A heavy weight began to settle on Tony’s shoulders. So nothing new there.
All thoughts slammed to a halt at that. For a moment, Tony was speechless.
had Steve gotten so close?
That was simply another way of saying Whitney would cause trouble at home. Exhibit A was this cavern fight. Tomorrow it would be some taunts in his direction. Tony couldn’t
“There, see? I brought him back in one piece. Just as promised.” Pierce said, patting his shoulder as he guided him back to Fury. Fury and Maria were back to sitting in their seats at the table, but Dugan and Gabe had disappeared and Tony briefly wondered if the wine had finally gotten to them. How much had they had?
The way he spoke set something off in Tony. Like natural fear response-an oppressive feeling of unease. He’d never seen a vampire like him.
“Yes.”
Sucking in a breath, he carefully placed the letter down and ran fingers through his greasy hair. What were Steve and Fury even thinking? They knew the government hated him-they must’ve known. And yet he didn’t see Natasha’s name on the letter.
Something wet falls on Steve’s cheek. Tony jerks a little when he sees.
The metal frame felt cool in his fingers and somehow that made him pull it close. He’d been happy once. He could be happy again.
That had caught his attention. Tony nearly banged his head under the bike.
The man was lucky. Tony didn’t have any plans to murder him. Yet.
“What are you
The tense moment shattered instantly. Steve groaned and covered his face with his hand.
“Yup. I dare say I think even Cap’n America looks up to you. I mean, you must be somethin’ pretty special to have Cap’n America like you. Iron man.”
Steve made to say something but Tony held a hand up. “I know you’re different. But I know that now. What were the chances Steve, that I wouldn’t end up bonded to the strongest alpha? After the accords I think everyone was expecting you’d bond me just to keep me in line.”
“What?”
It had all started when he was six years old. His mother had pulled him aside from his circuits and had placed him on her lap with a gentle smile.
“Cap, go!” Nat yelled and Steve didn’t stop. He ran like his life depended on it. And when Tony was only a few feet away from his outstretched hands-
He hadn't. He hadn't been able to. The very thought of thinking about Steve had paralyzed him. But more than that, the sheer amount of regret and loss and guilt. He'd killed Steve. They'd fought before he died. Steve had died thinking they hated each other when it was only half true. Tony had never had a chance to say goodbye.
“Can we get it back up?” Tony asked and felt his stomach twist anxiously when Andrew shook his head.
“What’s so funny?” Tony scowled, slipping his hand out of Jeremy’s to turn and try and catch Steve’s eye. Steve continued to just laugh.
“Find her yourself Stark. I’m busy.” The woman replied and stormed off before Tony could say another word.
He smiled broadly and looked Steve in the eye.
“His wrists...are they-“
“What?” Tony Stark blinked but no, Steve had to be sure.
“Well?”
He sits back down. It’s hard to clamp down the intense hurt he feels.
Steve shifted and leaned forward, seemingly intrigued. “You mean the issue with the suits. When that senator demanded you hand them over.”
Tonight he just wants to dream. One last time.
Mr. Robinson had always been a bit of an unknown to Tony. He’d only really met him a few times, and that too because he’d turned down various invitations to discuss join investments. As it stood, Tony didn’t really know what to expect from him, other than the fact he was a tall, dark and handsome type in his mid-thirties who was the CEO of AXO, a recent start up technological company that had grown fairly quickly in the time he’d been running from Osborn. A self made entrepreneur.
Rage started to built up in Steve’s heart and just as he was about to lash out that Stark was the reason Iron man had to keep this secret he-
“Get it yourself Stark!” Ben snarled into the coms breathlessly and to Tony’s absolute shock, started to run the other way.
Silence. Pin drop silence.
They hadn’t really spoken much though. Maybe this friend of Steve’s would be different and after the week he'd had, Tony was in desperate need of friends.
“You don’t need to be afraid.” He said, waiting until the wave of pain passed.
Steve saw the moment Tony’s eyes widened and the realization hit. He knew Tony understood, he just knew. Tony was fully aware of the implications and Steve knew he understood the weight of his decision. Steve had risked everything too.
“Thanks. It’s nice of you to notice.”
Ensuring his boots and chest plate was secure, he dusted the torn parts of the gold mesh on his arms and legs and stood tall. He had to get ready first.
“Armor override Steve Rogers, Code three-four, four-four, five-four, six-four.”
Tony felt the air leave his lungs and looked at Steve with a sick feeling in his stomach. Steve was completely still, and wasn't looking at him, but Mr. Robinson.
Jeremy mouthed the words and then he gaped.
“You won’t build this. And starting today, you’ll be monitored twenty-four seven Reed. Better start thinking of other ideas quick.” He says and leaves without another word. Outside the lab, he hands the blueprints to the head Shield lab worker and issues a simple order.
“You know us. Then you know why we’re here.” He said sending a meaningful look Tony’s way. It wasn’t surprising he’d work out that Tony told Steve everything about them.
Even as he spoke, his heart felt heavy. Like someone had taken what was left of it and burned it. He hadn’t ever imagined he’d be so upset. Why did this even affect him so much?
“Wait, I haven’t even-“
Steve gave a bright smile and curled a hand around Tony’s waist lightly. He tugged ever so slightly so that Tony was an inch closer but something changed.
With a sigh, Steve shook his head and stared out of the front. The vast expanse of space stared back at him, revealing the distant stars. They were in space and he still had issues that seemed bigger than that.
Tony was...moving on. He could feel it. Maybe Steve could too.
No. I'm okay." He promised, feeling sick to his core. Liar. He was a liar.
Steve wanted him to wear Captain America cuff links. And even the suit now that he thought about it was a really similar color to a stealth suit of Steve’s. Maybe it was a coincidence but didn’t he have a blue and silver battle suit? Tony was pretty sure he did but maybe he was mistaken.
"Good." Steve said with a smile and leaned closer. "I can't wait to get to know you, Iron man. The real you."
“Please Steve. Let’s figure something out.”
He’d take what he could get.
“Yes Tony. Everything’s gonna be okay.” Ty adds and brushes Roger's hand away. “I’ll take care of you.”
“Should’ve let you see? Smart fella like you would never have let it go.”
“Tony-“
Tony thought with an ache in his stomach as he felt Steve’s arm wrap around his shoulders gently and pull him close. Maybe in some other world a Tony and a Steve could be together. Maybe that Tony would’ve been stronger, and would’ve come out of Afghanistan whole instead of broken. Maybe they were a stronger, better person than he was.
A blond haired man with crimson eyes and a clean grey suit walked in, with Whitney hanging off his arm. He wore human clothes but somehow it added to his authority. There was no smile on his lips and not once did he blink, even when Zeke clapped his hands.
“Hey.” The blond man said softly, pulling his hand back a little. His eyes shone as he looked him over. “I’m not going to hurt you. Do you-do you remember me?”
“Don’t-“
“Don’t worry, I’ll get you home and you can have as much as you need.” Steve growled, thumping his tail quickly against his back. “I’ll take care of you Tony. Anything you need.” He said earnestly and Tony’s smile broadened.
“You do know who I am right?” Tony smiled, trying to stifle his laugh when Ben just went red with anger. The poor guy.
"Hey Carol." Tony said softly and let his knees fall so that his legs stretched out in front of him. It was too late though, she'd already seen him before. "Long time no see."
something.
“Wrong thing to say Robinson. Of all the things you could’ve asked for-“ Tony shook his head and sighed. “That was probably the worst.”
Then, before Ty can even squeak, Steve pulls Tony close and presses a scorching kiss onto his lips and claims his mouth there and then. When Tony gasps, he takes that as a chance to slip his tongue into his mouth and pulls Tony even closer, until all Tony can taste and feel and smell is Steve.
“I mean I know about the deal Tony.” Steve fired back, not shifting his gaze either. “I know Osborn split the company and spread it across several shareholders, some of whom remain loyal to him. And I know you happen to only own about fifteen percent of what’s left of the company.”
“What?”
“Thank you. I decided not to go for my army uniform in the end. I feel this is a bit more...subtle.” Steve said lightly, lips twitching as he stepped forward and suddenly he was bathed in the bright light of Tony’s living room.
He missed home. It was horrible but he was starting to think that there was no point anymore.
“Uh yeah. Peter Parker. It’s good to meet you...Tony?” The young man hesitated, stepping into the room, wringing his hands a little.
A small hushed noise escaped him. It sounded muffled to him but he thought it was the sound of him gasping reflexively. It was getting...fainter...
“Home.” Tony filled in quietly, and Steve looked at him warily.
“Steven Grant Rogers. And my partner, Anthony Edward Stark.”
"No. But I can guess."
It had something to do with the recent excursions. Zeke and the others had been going on many recently and Tony didn’t know why. But he did know Ezekiel had been giving him less and less each night.
“I’ll be with you soon.” Tony whispers quietly and presses the frame to his heart and he stands up to leave with new resolve.
“Oh don’t worry about me.” Steve waved him off confidently. “I’ve spoken to a few friends. I can take anything you dish out to me. But I wanna help you.”
“But I do belong to you in a way. You can do whatever you want.” Tony shrugged tiredly, looking down at his uniform in resignation. “It’s only fair, I guess.”
Rage and sorrow almost boiled over. It threatened to spill until there was no saving him. He couldn’t lose control and he couldn’t show it. At least not here.
“I’ve said nothing. Did you see Nick?”
His words completely left him when he saw Steve crouch. Then he gasped when Steve soared into the air and landed beside him with a heavy thud.
It sounded like a question but it wasn’t. Tony knew it wasn’t.
Tony hadn’t thought he’d be sat here on this table, in this room. Plain walls and soft black couches. One window and one square table built to seat six.
“I don’t need your money!” Because that would’ve been a cruel joke in itself. Tony Stark asking Steve Rogers for money. Shield for money. That wouldn’t be great even if he was desperate.
Tony's heart sank.
self from the world, all because he feared that he wasn't good enough. When he was. He clearly was.
“Excuse me Captain! But do you mind getting your hands off my omega!?”
No. A murderer. A
The mark of Steve’s shield on his back. His love and protection and care and soul. The mark set in his skin forever.
Thankyou so much to everyone who’s commented on this! I hope you liked this chapter and I’d really appreciate your thoughts on it! Can you read Steve better than Tony can? What are your thoughts?
The tour didn’t last much longer after that.
Then he sighed, and dropped the act.
Tony didn't want it to end. He was afraid to admit that he was dreading the morning when he'd no doubt realize it was all a hallucination in his comatose mind. It would be just his luck if that happened.
But Steve wasn’t convinced. “You are bonded. There’s something else isn’t there?” His eyes had taken a hard edge, looking like liquid gold in the dark.
Something softened on Fury’s face and he laughed gently. He looked pleased and somehow...less strict. “Don’t be. You want me to tell you what to do?”
“I can’t.” Bucky says and stares at him with a face full of regret. “I can’t be him.”
“Oh you don’t need to be shy.” Tony’s smile grew and he turned, folding his own arms.
“You got yourself a deal.”
“Drink up kid. There’s a whole evening to go yet.” And with that, Pierce handed him a drink, straight off the rocks. There were two cubes of ice in there, just the way Tony liked it.
It took him a good moment to respond. Probably because he was too busy looking at Ben’s expression. The glee on his face was even more irritating than Trish.
“What kind of things?”
“So...he cares about me. That’s what you’re saying.” Tony said quietly, and suddenly it was like a weight had lifted off his shoulders. Like someone had given him air again.
Startled, Steve jumped back and cursed mentally, feeling his heart begin to pound. He yanked the shield off his back and held it out, squinting his eyes to look for the danger.
“I never want to see you pull a stunt like that again.” Steve said sharply, his face morphing into glare as he drilled his gaze into Tony like he was pinning him down. “I’ll only say this once. You will never put yourself at risk like that again.”
Then he paused. And took a slight step back as something twisted in his stomach.
Finally Steve spoke, but not before tightly gripping Tony's arm. His knuckles were white under the fingerless gloves, and the squeezed tighter when Steve saw the picture.
Tony blinked at him but didn't break rhythm. "How do you know that?"
And loves. Even now.
It was surreal hearing this. Like Gabe had a spyglass and could see right through him. But there didn’t seem to be any punches in the words. Just...
“And why can’t it be you?” Bucky asks, though his expression is grim like he already knows.
“Keep going, I’m just checking.” Steve said, sounding focused as he then brought his hands to Tony’s face and scanned his eyes.
“You’re gonna be there?” Something loosened in Tony’s shoulders. He had someone to direct him if he wasn’t sure where to go or who to talk to.
“Tony.” He heard in his ear and couldn’t help but let out the breath he’d been holding. “I hear you load and clear.”
Steve nodded at that. “You shouldn’t ever be pressured. Never feel like anyone can pressure you into anything.”
Until the end at least. Then he was free to go home and forget the whole affair even happened.
Tony closes his eyes and wishes for the end. His head throbs and he can’t breathe. He doesn’t even try to move or speak as Bucky pushes him harder into the wall.
“But you’re not wrong Tony.” Steve clenched his jaw and looked away. “That’s what I’ve been doing, purposefully or not. I’ve been punishing you. Making your life miserable.”
His fingers touch something wet and instantly he swipes his face and holds his hand up. There’s no blood thankfully, or none that’s fresh but there are tears
Denial set in and Tony did what he did best.
“Sir, you have a message from Miss. Potts. Do you wish to hear it?”
“But why not? He can handle himself well enough and knows Manhattan well. Did he not grow up there?” Norman pondered, holding a hand out in Tony’s direction. “Plus, he’s intelligent enough to know how to behave. You’ll do as you’re told, won’t you Anthony?”
Then suddenly, as Tony crossed him, he snapped. Tony couldn't say he was surprised. He may have forgotten their fight but he could never forget how Steve got when he was right.
“Stay away from the robots.”
Still, that didn’t help Tony. What was he supposed to do with this new information?
“C’mon. I’ll take you to your baby. We won’t hurt you, I
The cavern was quiet at four in the morning. Slowly he made his way through, making no noise as he did. When he reached Zeke’s room, he knocked on the door lightly.
“You’re still in your first trimester-“
“Agent Hill, good to see you.” Tony acknowledged and Maria smirked a little.
“Well, when they came through, I thought it was perfectly clear-“
“Everyday.” He said and laughed tiredly. “Ask Sharon.”
“I don’t care either. I want people to know.” He said, watching Tony’s eyes widen as he leaned closer. And behind Tony, shadows began to appear in the mist.
What are your thoughts? Can it get any worse? How will Steve pull things up when Tony's just said that? PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW WONDERFUL PEEPS :DDD
He wondered just how obviously high his voice had gone. Judging by Steve’s unimpressed expression, he wasn’t doing a very good job of hiding how excited he was.
The gold filigree font stared back at him as he rubbed at his mouth in awe. This wasn’t a joke, he’d really been invited.
Still, it felt wrong to push it back.
“He’s omega. The way it’s going, I think he’s going to be an exception.”
“I’m not sure yet. But something has to change. Keep working on those forged documents. I’ll have Tony starting on these by the end of the day.” Steve promised, holding up the bag of pills. Four months. He’d make it count.
Steve brought out the best in him, as he always did for everyone. He would always approach you with a smile and a clap on the shoulder and a compliment of some kind. Tony had always done everything to go above and beyond for that praise.
“Tony?” Steve heard himself say before he could stop himself and Tony jerked once before jolting up.
This was bad, it was so unbelievably bad-what had he been
“Steve!” Tony chirped, waving a hand as he went over. “It’s good to see you!”
To Tony’s complete and utter surprise, Steve just shrugged. “So? Why would they have a problem with you?”
“Don’t worry. I will feed you when I get back. Be good and do as you’re told.”
Through the quinjet cameras, Steve watched them fly through the asteroids. They continued to give commentary on what they found, noting increasing signs of space metal. The asteroids seemed to be increasing in size as well. Steve knew, with a sinking feeling, that that did not bode well for anyone on this planet.
And with that, Tony slipped his other hand around Zeke’s neck and pulled sharply. Zeke was dead within seconds.
Leaping from roof to roof, he crossed all parts of his block in sequenced order, checking the humans he’d left slumped in each dark corner. None had moved but all of them still thrummed with life and so thankfully, there would be no deaths here tonight. Not that Zeke cared; his rules had been clear.
A soft huff left his lips. What would it be like to be admired by someone like Steve? Tony wished he knew.
“Are you calling me fat?”
Tony was gobsmacked. What kind of coward would just...
“St-Ste-“ Tony tried to speak but his body shook and broke into a stream of coughs. He sounded like he’d swallowed a packet of nails.
Tony lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He feels close to bursting, he's so excited. “Steve.”
“They’re mine. But you have them.” He said confidently and Tony glanced at the tags before looking up with apprehension.
, Tony thought.
“Thanks.” He said softly, not looking at Tony as he curled his hands in his lap. “That’s nice to hear.”
“He doesn’t care.” Tony insisted but even he knew he was lying now. It was obvious.
Cheeks turning a hot red colour, he kept his head down as two other men and women in the waiting area stared at him. He tried his best to subtly press his hand against his stomach and leaned forward.
"Yeah." Tony said softly, starting to smile. "I think I will, Winghead."
“Thank you doctor. Please make sure he’s...”
The burn started to spread to his ears. Slowly he let the arm go and felt his eyes linger over the links again. He was drawn to them like a magnet.
His voice barely carried amongst the chatter. No one turned and no one answered, something he tried not to feel stung by since usually he stood out in a crowd and was usually heard.
He was also extremely burnt out. Iron man had taken a hit.
Headlines over the last few weeks had been repetitive. Lists upon lists of added figures-more bonded pairs cropping up with each day. Photos of happy alphas and happy omegas, hand in hand as some news reporter commented on how this new law had given life to love.
, he thought. It was ironic that Steve was sat before him today as they finalised the papers. That they were here on the same day as back then.
of them.
Still, Tony beamed and clenched his fists to hide his nerves. After what Steve had said in the car, he couldn’t help but think he’d not been paying the Captain enough attention.
, things began to ease up a bit. Steve didn’t talk. Tony didn’t talk.
Lips brushed against his forehead. And when he cleared his vision he saw Steve standing over him with tears in his eyes.
“Of course, of course!” Zeke rubbed his hands together and smiled. “Everyone please return to your rooms. Anthony, you stay.”
If Steve noticed, he didn’t say a word, so Tony didn’t either. They followed the signs and stepped inside and suddenly they were greeted with a brightly decorated room with bright crystal chandeliers, and long satin curtains draping over the windows. There were circular tables all around the room with various guests having already chosen their seats. There was a large circular space which Tony was certain was for dancing, although currently there were groups of politicians and the like having individual conversations. A few men and women were recognizable from the news, but Tony didn’t really know anyone else.
It was only a matter of time really. Maybe Pepper had been right.
Still he listened. For old times sake.
“I wanted to ask if I could be join the team. Carol said there was an offer on probation-“
“I need to head back.” Tony said after he touched Fury’s shoulder to get his attention. Thankfully Fury had just finished talking to some white haired men and was just about to turn to Maria. At the touch, they both turned to give Tony an odd look.
For a moment Steve was carefully blank. Then he cracked.
“But how can we work together when we barely get on anymore?”
How can he be pregnant? The last thing he remembers is waking up to Captain America telling him they won after the Chitauri. How can he have forgotten so much that he didn’t even remember being
He laughs a little and shakes his head, even as his eyes plead with Tony to believe him.
“We have hand held weapons. Guns, laser-based and explosives. But right now that’s all we’ve got. And the Avengers team off course.”
“You got it! Let’s do this!”
Steve’s eyes were fierce when they looked at him. They ran over him quickly and sharply.
They have a family now. This is their family. Their
Steve looked hurt. “You mean you were lying?” He whispered, sounding horrified. Those golden eyes were starting to glisten.
“I know Tony, I’ve got this. Don’t worry, this will be quick.”
That...
“You didn’t speak to me.” Tony muttered back. “I just did what you asked.”
“The Howling Commandos.” Tony finished for him, feeling a little awestruck as the two old men in soldier outfits turned his way and grunted quietly. They seemed to cast a brief look at him before turning back to their conversation and for a moment, Tony’s heart sank. Even these people thought he was a waste of time.
“T-Stark. What are you doing here?” Steve asked even though Tony knew he’d seen the folders. Still, he somehow looked shocked to see him.
“Send scans. Now!”
"Do you know the exact number?"
“I’m-I’m so sorry, I just thought-I’ll just leave now-“
“Tony-“
With a huff, Fury clinked their glasses. He wasn’t smiling, but it was a damn near thing and Tony thought he saw something lift off his shoulders. “Doesn’t change the pants on these monkeys.”
“Sure. Because that stopped us before.” Steve continued tiredly and Tony groaned because why did they have to do this? Why couldn’t they just...move on?
Even as Steve spoke, he could see Tony was already starting to understand. Areas where the armor had been damaged started to heal with a gold mesh under-suit that escaped from Tony’s skin. As his eyes glowed in the faint light, the gold began to climb up his neck too, and stop just short of where Steve’s hand lay. Then it retracted a little and Steve could finally relax.
He’d done it in less than ten seconds. Tony could barely close his mouth.
Steve was quiet. Then-
“So no bread?” He insisted but Tony wasn’t fooled.
“No. Her scent has imprinted. We can’t risk it.”
“Yes, of course.” Tony replied smoothly, hoping his complexion wouldn’t give him away. While Zeke didn’t allow mirrors in their haven, Tony had been told he often became paler when he lost blood. Some vampires did and some vampires didn’t; a strange phenomenon among vampires that no one had figured out yet. Tony’s cheeks exposed him too often.
Steve stopped. A headline caught his attention.
Elijah and Zachariah both nodded and Tony couldn’t help but smile at the praise as he joined the line further down. It seemed things were really looking his way.
“What exactly do you mean by that?”
” Tony choked and began to sob quietly, feeling for all the world like he was the worst person out there. That he was so cursed and awful and selfish that he'd killed Captain America. That he'd killed the person he loved.
“Did he also tell you not to send backup in case something went wrong?”
”Yeah we did. We really did.” And Tony knows Steve’s smiling a little and doing that cute thing where he ducks his head down to hide his blush.
"I'm glad." Steve said softly and when he opened his eyes, he saw Steve looking at him with a tender expression.
Steve always affected him like this. Always made his body call out for more.
“Steve.” Tony murmured and sat up. “How do you feel?”
Tony is gobsmacked. His head spins as he stares at the mess and the hallucination standing over it. Maybe he's finally lost it. But hallucinations are never that real-
Steve opened his mouth to say something but then he snapped it shut and stared. Then his eyes flicked between him and Maria.
He seemed to hesitate. Then;
The logical part of Tony knows it’s the next step. It had always been part of the plan, especially if things hadn’t taken a turn for the worst. Shield needed a leader. And it was gonna be him only...
“So you take the couch. I take the bed. That’s how Steve did it yesterday and that’s what we’re doing today.”
Something had shifted after that dinner. Tony didn’t know what it was but he was struggling to motivate himself all of a sudden.
Tony shouted, waving his hands out to shut
The armor was flat on its back, and seemed to be an older version of Ironman. The helmet was engaged but no lights were on and under Steve’s palm, the chest plate was cool. Steve couldn’t tell whether Tony was even inside.
“Not good enough.” Steve shook his head. “You’re not going. And that’s an order.”
“I apologize Ty. He will do better I promise. He’s not usually like this.”
When he blinked his eyes open and stood up straight again, he felt red in the face. Pierce just looked at him like the reaction was typical. Hell, maybe in his world, it was.
Tony's eyes stung. This worse than anything he'd imagined. He bit his lip and turned to Zeke, sending every pleading sign he could.
Then they have an argument.
“Try again. I’ve got a firm hold this time.” Steve said with clarity and that Captain edge of his and Tony felt the vibrations of his voice in his chest. It was massively distracting and made his breath hitch with the brush of the tape. Steve’s touch was completely different now. It had a slightly stronger feel now, like he was trying to cover him or-
Zeke’s smile grew but the skin around his deep red eyes grew tight. “So why did you give it to them? Do you wish to lose favor-“
“Tony?”
“You don’t know who I am, do you?” The man asked blankly and frankly, Tony felt a little gleeful at being asked that. He hadn’t pictured the man as arrogant but he loved to stun people, especially ones with a stick up their ass.
Some time between being declared an Avenger and that conversation with Steve, Tony’s awareness of the situation had heightened.
The documentary had made them sound primitive. Tony was starting to feel like maybe they were.
“Zeke, I was just playing with him! He was being a bad boy and I simply-“
“He’s waiting for you.” Maria urged but something stopped him. Like a physical chain around his waist that pulled him back, no matter how much he tried, he couldn’t free himself to move.
“Not a clue puppy. Who are you? Some distant cousin of Frankenstein?”
“What’s there to take in? There’s me and you and it’s all done. Gone.
He must’ve been drinking. Why else would he-
Tony ran as fast as he could. His enhanced hearing told him he was being chased by two vampires-most likely Norman and Whitney.
Reed does not like him. Or rather, he hates him. It’s obvious. Since Steve brought these people in, they’ve all been avoiding him like the plague but Reed has something more. There’s something else.
Tony didn’t bring his hands under the tap this time. This time, he planted them against the white porcelain sink and stared at his reflection. In the decorated mirror, water trickled down his face, one after the other until they slowed to a single stream of drops.
Only Tony would believe he’s not good enough. And it’s ironic because Steve has only ever pictured Tony as the perfect key to his puzzle.
“Is that so? Well, why don’t you stay with me in the truck there? It’ll keep you nice and warm while we wait? How does that sound sweetheart?”
Steve was staring right back at him with wide eyes.
“You-you know!” Tony waved his hand up and nearly knocked one of the medics. “You jumped in front of me! You took
“He’s n-not breathing-“
“Next week!?” Tony cried out, and wanted to smack himself for his own stupidity. Horrified, he clapped his hand over his mouth.
“I’ll wear the armor-“
“I don’t know Rogers. I need to get to know him.” Tony tosses over his shoulder and waves a hand. “Jarvis, help Ty find a guest bedroom. Cap, follow me.”
“Thank you Maria.” Steve turned away from the call room and began to head towards the cockpit, not bothering to address the concerned glances he was getting his way. The Avengers team he’d assembled, consisted of Carol, Thor, Natasha and Hank-an amalgamation of both the secret corps team led by Nick and Maria, and the other, more well known Avengers group. It had been on his request as commander that they assembled.
Dinner was a well needed break. After he’d realised he was in desperate need of food, he’d headed straight to the cafeteria, and mentally prayed there’d be food there. He didn’t think he’d manage the night if he didn’t eat soon. Goddamn Steve had gotten him into good eating habits when they’d lived together and now, he was back to remembering them. He didn’t know if he followed that during the SHRA and Norman Osborn’s reign, since him and Steve hadn’t been talking then, but if his weight loss was any indication, he’d say he threw all good habits out the window.
be first? I’m your alpha Tony, I have always been-“
Tony wasn’t sure how long it had been. He could’ve been sat there for hours as far as he knew.
"So are you. But I already knew you were."
Peter rubbed a hand over his neck and turned his eyes to the floor. “I’ve never seen a vampire before. I’m not sure what your take is on spiders but...”
Whitney shifted on her feet at that. She eyed him through the mask with distain.
At least Tony could be honest about this. “I haven’t. I’m sure.”
“Please don’t...don’t cry.”
He tried to and quickly realized. Had it really been that long?
But they weren’t friends and this was their new normal. He needed to stop forgetting that, because it wasn’t gonna change.
As Tony made himself comfortable, he resigned himself to the inevitable questioning there’d be. As always with this kind of thing, someone was going to ask him and he wasn’t prepared. He could never be prepared, no matter how many times he was asked.
Ben didn’t seem to have an answer. For once, the man looked gobsmacked and Tony almost wanted to warn him about flies and open mouths but the man simply shook his head and stepped away from the desk, turning away with a scowl on his face.
The trip back to the mansion was bleak and long. It felt infinite, like the possibilities Steve had dreamed of with Iron man.
Nothing.
“I’m okay.” Tony says just as quietly and for a moment, he can’t help but smile a little. “And for the record, I don’t hate blue. It’s just-“
Eyes fluttering open, Tony lifted his head and looked around.
“I don’t even know where I’m going.” He mumbled, slumping ever so slightly. Was this a ploy against him? Some elaborate plan to mock him and his feelings?
Inside or out, room or not, this life was punishment. And they were all the same in that.
“Turn around Stark. I’ll hold you from the front.”
Steve's lips pressed against his again. His arms circled him once more, holding him by his waist. Slowly, one hand traced up to his neck and pulled him closer, making him moan softly in Steve's mouth. In answer, Steve pulled him closer and kept kissing him like a man starved of oxygen.
Tony felt like smacking the agent. What was wrong with him? "Of course I'm not! Where are they?!" He snapped and thankfully the agent pointed ahead towards the largest tower of smoke.
A part of Tony’s heart sank. Would he be told he was no where near as good? Was this going to lead to how similar he was to Howard?
He doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry.
So he put down the tablet, ignored the usual mumbling of the other agents as he walked past, and headed for the door.
The room began to chatter, the vampires turning anxiously to one another. Tony couldn’t move, he was frozen in his spot.
“Of course my lord. Should I leave you to work?” Tony asked dully, knowing he’d gain nothing here.
Finally Zeke spoke. “Alright. Settle down. He’ll go. But there will be strict rules. For one, he must wear armor.”
He was met with irritation, confusion and then a look of dawning realization. Then Clint’s face went completely blank like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
He felt no pain. Only softness and that blissful warmth.
It all made complete sense. Steve was the Captain. He was
“They’re waiting for the police but that’s them there.” Steve pointed, leaning closer to Tony to guide his sight. “You see that kid there?”
Steve's expression turned to steel. "My feelings for you are real Tony. You don't know just how much they mean to me. Just how much I care about you. Sometimes-" Steve shook his head tiredly and looked away. "Sometimes it scares me, just how far you can make me go."
Anxiety rising, Tony pulled on his mic and gave it a try.
"How? How
“I don’t want to fight you Steve. Not again.”
“Of course.” Steve said after he stopped and smiled at him innocently. “There’s a lot to work with.”
“Sorry, what?”
“It’s like you can read my mind or something.” Tony mumbled into his drink, hoping to fill the silence.
I won’t.”
It smelled like Steve. Like safety and warmth and
“They’ll find him.” Natasha said quietly and Steve nodded wordlessly. They had to.
He looks and Tony and stares. Slowly he closes his mouth and his eyes narrow.
“Those aren’t yours.”
He loved Steve. More than anything. More than even himself.
“Tony? Hello?”
“I hate you.” Tony mumbles and instantly goes for his wardrobe to find some clothes to change into. “Stupid alpha making a mess.” He grumbles under his breath for good measure.
Obliging, Tony tipped his chin down and let his lips curve into a smile.
“No-no Mary here.” Tony said a little unsteadily and Steve squeezed him tighter.
Tony will fade away. Like a memory of something once lost.
He’d smelt this before. He’d
Several agents started to mumble and some of them stopped him at the door.
"I'm sorry. I'm
“Jarvis? Why am I-?”
Under the helmet, Tony went bone-white.  The world blurred around the edges and narrowed onto the bullet wounds that were now starting to pour blood, like a burst pipe that had finally let go. Steve was panting heavily and had his eyes shut and his head ducked down. His whole face screamed pain and pure agony.
Somewhere in the crowd, Tony was sure Sharon and Steve were laughing together. Maybe they weren’t even talking anymore. Maybe they’d left the room to find a quiet area, somewhere private for just the two of them. And Steve would smile kindly, and tell Sharon she looked beautiful, and she would smile back and have the guts to say that he looked good too. Then they’d share so much together and Steve would be strong
And everything was...fine. The streets were quiet and only a few humans traipsed back from work, dazed enough to not notice the vampire and werewolf walking side by side in strange outfits. Tony couldn’t see any creatures, but he wasn’t going to curse anyone for that.
"I know you Shellhead. You aren't that different. And I'm hard work too."
Steve
He ran and ran, feeling his heart race in time with his breathing. He continued to run for what felt like hours when he realized it had only been minutes.
“Bait? You know, fish, hook, worm, that sort of-“
“Ah, see Stark, we have the designs in place, so we just need you to do some fine tuning for us. Simple and easy.”
“No. No, I don’t think you should do this.” Tony smiled and finally looked at Steve with lips that trembled. “I just want you to be happy. Be with the people you care about. People who can help you and give you what you need and know what to say. People who would make things right-“
Everyone slowed down and stared at him. The silence in the room was heavy.
Then Tony cleared his throat and addressed the whole room. "Or maybe I should go through all of your things. Maybe wake you all up at five in the morning, or blank you when you greet me? Or better yet, why don't I just tell you what I think of you? Each and every one of you."
“Almost seems kind of cruel.” Steve mirrored in a soft tone. “Leaving people in a place like this.”
He’d had sex before. With men and woman when he was in his twenties and decidedly human. Back when he could see the blue of his eyes and taste the burn of a good malt whiskey. He remembered enjoying it-the warmth and feel of another person’s body. Their lips pressing against yours after sharing a wonderful moment of pleasure. Feeling for all the world like you were not alone.
The planet was solid under his feet. The ground didn’t crumble away and thankfully didn’t swallow him whole. But other than a dark grey dust that felt like clay, a baron wasteland of a planet contained nothing. There was a slight mist that seemed to follow the same slow movement as the asteroids, but nothing else.
“How’s Jenny at the reception? I wonder if Pepper knows-“
“No.” Tony rolled his eyes and clasped his hands together firmly. “It’d be pretty hypocritical to judge.” He shrugged and to his delight, Steve relaxed his shoulders a little.
“Why do you...?” Reed frowns at the image mounted on the wall. It was by Steve’s request and had been there for months since he became the head of Shield. It had served as a reminder of why he did his job.
Now he’d chosen to put it on. He’d chosen to wear the suit again after months of not coming near it. He owed so much but this had been his choice, always.
Silently, Tony stood to his full height on the his perch. From this angle, the pale moonlight with a mix of street lighting hit, and Tony thought he could see blond hair.
Pressure built into a single point on his lower back.
“Fire away. Your wish is my command.” Tony spat out, resisting the urge to mock Steve with a bow. It probably wouldn’t help but that didn’t mean he didn’t feel like doing it. Some things never changed.
“He would probably say yes.”
“Yes.” Steve said softly and then lay him down on the bed. He knelt beside him and began to pull his own shirt off.
Tony watched him lean over the bar and rap the surface impatiently. He didn’t take his hand off Tony’s shoulder but for once Tony didn’t mind. Comfort from any corner and all that.
“Good, good. Now...” Zeke’s eyes darkened and he gestured to the door. “Your punishment. You know what you did.”
I can’t stay here, I can’t.”
"No. I seem to remember just how much convincing it took. He ditched the file the first time I brought it to the office."
“What would you like to eat?” Steve nudged gently, barely managing to keep his own sorrow away. He’d just watched the omega he loved go through hell.
“Steve.” He begged and squeezed his eyes shut until he heard a sigh and felt Steve pull back.
“Definitely.”
“Course. Was the least I could do.” Tony smiled tightly, hoping to get something out of Steve but there was nothing. Steve was a sphinx.
“So Stark. Had enough of these clowns yet?” Fury asked giving the wine an unimpressed look. But then again, when did he ever look any different?
Clearly, he’d been delusional. Steve had honest-to-god meant him. Did that mean anything?
It didn’t go down well. The woman who’d said it just scoffed and gestured as if to say ‘look’ and the rest of the crowd tutted like a flock of crows. It was ridiculous and unbelievably petty and yet, he still felt unsurprised somehow. Maybe because it always ended up this way-it was always gonna happen sooner or later.
Tony was sat there, fast asleep and slumped over in a chair. He looked exhausted.
“What if I told you that Shield can get a larger share in the company.” Steve said quietly like it was some inside knowledge. Tony wasn’t convinced though.
“That wasn’t because of the color. It was because it reminded me of you.”
“How come you know so much about me?” Tony whispered, barely making a sound as he basked in the feeling of the arms around him. He wanted to stay like this forever, feeling safe in this place with a warm heart beating in his ear. The warm heart of a kind man who knew what he needed.
“Wait here. Sit down and rest.” Steve said and patted the chair again, feeling elated when Tony gave a little roll of his eyes and did as he was told. Steve wanted to hold onto that eye-roll with both hands and hope that it was a good sign. He really hoped it was.
“No-no, please no-!” He cried, pulling away so much that Steve yanked him back, grabbing his wrists and pulling his back to his chest, locking Tony’s hands in front of them. Like this, Tony couldn’t hurt himself but he did scream.
Tony made it count. It was like a higher power had given him a go at seeing the world before sending him down for centuries.
“I need you to go out tonight for the claims. It’s the last time I’ll ask you, but Ty needs to discuss things with me and I know you know the routes. Do this last thing for me pet and I’ll bless your bond happily.”
Strange looks stunned at his partner. “Reed, don’t-“
“Hey easy!” Steve thumped his back with just enough force to help and when Tony could sit up again, he glared at Steve.
He liked Steve. He
Ben had amended all of his work today, as always. He was already behind.
And he knows, better than anyone that they’re all fucked for it. Tony knows it completely. He’s about as useful as Steve is right now.
“It’s never easy. But it’s these decisions that separate you from the rest. It makes you a braver man.”
“So how was your morning? You had a mission right?”
- Steve had always been kind to him, had always inspired him to be more.
Everything had been going perfectly. Tony had never enjoyed Manhattan so much.
“He’s starting to stabilize Captain, we’re keeping a close eye-“
“I love you too, you know.”
“I’m not uncomfortable, it was fine-“
“Checking pupil responses. The Captain says he’s not injured but he seems to be going into shock. Mr. Stark, can you hear me?”
It was hard not to smile when he heard that.
“I didn’t know what else to do...” Tony croaks and curls up when a contraction hits him again. His whole back feels soaked with sweat and he’s shivering and-
He’d rather enjoy it while he still could.
There weren’t many options to hide in. His bunker was too far and the closest thing was the blue ship. He was almost torn in his decision to push further.
“Don’t play this game with me. He’ll be fine on his own.” Rogers looks at Tony and raises his brow. “Won’t you, Tony?”
"You shouldn't forgive me for assuming you were cruel. You're not a monster Tony. You could never be." Steve blew out a breath and shook his head.
For a moment, they just stared at each other, and the soft white light of the lamps reflected off the curves of Steve's face, highlighting the soft, concerned look Steve had as he watched him closely.
A lawyer on his left. A lawyer on Steve’s right.
.” Steve said coldly, and put down his pen, leaning forward. “I’m your commander and you’ll do as I say Stark. If we are attacked, I may need all hands on deck. Which means that while you’re here, you might need to-“
Putting everything into his legs, Tony kicked and screeched, doing everything to shove Norman off. If he could just get back on his feet-
Tony wondered, feeling the metal warm under his fingers. It was just as smooth as before and still made him calmer. It was a nervous habit he’d absorbed, anytime Steve would go on missions without him, or there would be something major happening. This was huge in comparison.
“No you’re right. Of course you do.” Tony sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I don’t wanna hurt you.”
“He’s gone. He can’t come.”
The small picture of the Avengers stared back at him. He’d had it framed in a nice glass trim, and kept it on his desk as a souvenir. And maybe because it was one of the things he was most proud off in his life. In the picture, Ironman was leaning against Captain America, while the rest of the team was smiling alongside them. In this snapshot, their happiness and friendship was captured and immortalized.
With a bit of guidance, he was back to being vertical before he knew it. And the doctor was back to scribbling on his paper.
Steve’s gaze sharpened just a fraction. “It’s Commander. I’m not Captain America anymore.” And really, Tony had to scoff at that.
“Oh...thanks.” Tony sighed, fully aware it would taste of ash in his mouth.
“Thank you. Guess that means I owe you.” He grinned and launched himself of the edge, landing gracefully besides Thor. He said something to his friends and quickly waved in Tony’s direction.
Goddammit. “Fine.” Tony mumbled and did a quick check to make sure he was indeed wearing a t-shirt rather than anything more revealing. “Tell him he can come up-“
"I know." Steve said quietly and spoke softly. "I forgive you too. I forgave you, the second I saw you again after Norman. I'm sorry for what I said. I was just so angry."
“Don’t make me laugh. Please.” Steve says, feeling disgusted. “You people have no humanity. No sense. As if you feel anything for anyone anymore. You’re selfish. In fact, you’re just like-“
“And hair-gel.” Tony added and pointed at the sweep of dark hair on John’s head.
“L’ve you St’ve.”
Nothing changed in Steve’s body language but as soon as Tony said it, something didn’t feel right.
“Where are my assignments?” Tony paused and sniffed a little, feeling a wave of exhaustion sweep over him. It was okay. He just needed to finish the stupid equations and then he’d be free to spend the day in bed. Would Ty or Ben let him leave early?
