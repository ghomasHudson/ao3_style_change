, because his past wouldn’t leave him alone and because he and Pepper had the terrible luck of getting caught away from their home and from their pack. The alpha leader’s omega and a den beta alone and on their own against Hammer and his - his
“Sir, before you go into a self-induced panic, please take a deep breath. I am still present and I am unharmed.” Jarvis trotted over to him. “You must understand. I can offer a different perspective of the field. If I am capable of spotting dangers others could easily miss would it not be logical to take that risk? I can not simply stand by without acting when my input can help prevent injuries and keep you safe.” The cockatoo hopped to stand on Tony’s knee. “If you were to come to harm while I didn’t act I feel the responsibility falls on me.”
from having sex with Steve was perhaps the most terrifying moment of his life. There was no way he could’ve said the truth with them listening.
He wondered if Jan and Hank had a past of trying to cause a heat and getting their hopes crushed after each failed attempt. If that were the case, had they tried for a pup and were left heartbroken after each negative result? Deciding to give up after too many attempts and were left with depression over what would never be?
The pure happiness he felt almost threatened to burst out of his chest. He wanted to howl it out and show the world. Perhaps one day he’d be able to do so at night with Steve. He shouldn't push his luck, but he could happily imagine it.
Steve licked his lips, locking his eyes with Tony’s. “I- I’m interested in you, Tony, and I’d want nothing more than to get to know you. I know this is sudden. You don’t have to join if you don’t want to. Don’t feel obligated to because of my interests, but if you maybe feel something for me and you’d like to get to know me as much as I want to get to know you, we’ll be waiting for you over by the river where we left the pack.”
“Hulk, our pack is down there and they’re in trouble. They need our help,” Tony said to his large friend. For his effort, he received a sniff and a snort from the giant before he stomped his way to see their pack and waited as if expecting orders. Curiously, Tony wondered about that. Bruce was an omega, no doubt about that, but what of Hulk? He couldn’t tell from just looking or scenting. Hulk’s biological structure was different and Tony wasn’t about to ask the large brute to spread his legs to get a proper look, and from just scent alone he couldn’t place Hulk in orientation. It was similar to a Thor and Loki situation. Tony only had a logical conclusion.
Soon, the consequences of his choices were going to catch up with him. Either his pack would decide enough was enough and act appropriately for his behavior by letting him go, or their bleeding hearts would get the best of them and offer him one last chance.
Pepper came running to greet Tony and Rhodey first. Happy came in shortly after. The saints that they were, they had dinner ready for them with rolls fresh out of May’s kitchen. Tony’s mouth was watering from just the thought but found the scent different when they finally entered their home after so long. When he expected to smell something warm and sweet he found it smelled… odd. Pungent. Which wasn’t right. May’s rolls were always delicious and sugary. The smell of them had never once been off in all the times Tony had bought from her.
“Sorry, Ty,” he really wasn’t, “my boy is calling me.”
Everyone turned to him. “Care to repeat?” Loki said.
would I leave him when I lo -” he snapped his mouth shut, realizing at the last second what he was about to say.
Clint hissed in sympathy. “Tough. At least it can finally be over.”
pack. We have scars from battle and even scars that are not from battles. We aren’t exactly blemish free so why do you think I’ll get disgusted seeing yours?”
“She'll snap me in half if I even try.”
Tony covered up the gauntlets again and stood. “Come on. We’ve got plenty to pack and hardly anything done.”
Steve released a whine. “You should’ve woken me up. You’re probably tired and I’m keeping you here. Does anything hurt?” The alpha probably took notice of an involuntary wince when Tony tried to move his feet.
He kept his eyes completely focused on the cockatoo, never realizing the rabbit was leading them closer to a road that went through the forest commonly used by shifters. There was a ditch that separated the forest floor from the road that Tony spotted through the bushes. Without thinking and intending to continue after the cockatoo, Tony jumped, breaking through the bushes only to skid to a sudden stop. On the road, right in front of his path, was a very large golden wolf that had two of his paws in mid-air as he casually walked. The alpha instinctively turned to the noise, locking his blue eyes with Tony as Tony sank his paws down on the ground in order to stop. He had too much momentum and ended up sliding the last few inches before stopping right in front of the alpha, touching nose to nose.
Tony had assumed, perhaps rather quickly, that Steve was fine with the news of a child. Steve had been enraged at the idea of Tony risking their pup earlier before the fight. Was that just his instincts acting up from seeing his mate in danger? The need to protect his family when in reality Steve wasn’t ready for what a child entailed?
They agreed.
It seemed the cockatoo knew him too well. “Bruce and I went on and on about joining the pack that we never even asked you or Vision about it. What’s your opinion about going with the Avengers?”
“Good night, Jarvis. Vision.”
shifter, and he was huge and most likely an alpha, and he was part of a pack instead of being the leader of a pride. In all the years that Tony had read about the Avengers, he had never heard of a feline in the pack. One would think with a lion involved it would be the first thing mentioned from a famous war pack, but apparently not. No wonder Vision was excited to roll over to them.
“What have you been teaching the kids, Tones?”
, as some bigots would often call them) centaur of their town. Tony had seen him a couple of times. He knew of Steve. Knew his name. Knew the wild centaur lived in the forest but would occasionally make a trip into town for one reason or another.
“Dinner is served,” Clint said after putting the fish he carried down. “You're welcome.” That earned him a snort from Natasha, Bucky and Loki. “Where'd everyone go?” he continued after noticing three of his pack members gone.
“Oh,” he took a deep breath and his heart returned to a regular tempo. He hadn’t overslept. He hadn’t missed the Avengers, not yet.
“Did you… enjoy it?”
Bruce quickly got the hint and looked apologetic. “Sorry, Jarvis. I wasn’t thinking. I keep forgetting you’re not actually a shifter.”
“It’s tempting,” Hammer squeezed, “to have a whore like yourself warm my bed, but you’re more useful to me as a smithy than you are as a piece of ass, but what a
Steve pulled away as if burnt. Understanding crossing his face. “Sorry. Sorry. No hands. Promise.” His hand didn’t return, but his mouth did, making Tony arch again with a moan.
A deep breath, heart reaching his throat and adrenaline rushing in his veins, he made a mad dash through the trees. He couldn’t give them a chance. The trees thickened as he went further and he maneuvered as best as he could around them. At first he heard nothing except for his own footsteps crunching on fallen leaves. For a moment he thought he was free, thinking the shifters decided not to do anything and leave him be. He should’ve known better. False hope nearly shattered him when the telltale signs of multiple footsteps echoed behind him.
for answers. Obviously, they both didn’t know what was going on.
Rhodey, Pepper and Happy frowned. “You don’t even want us to defend the den?” There was an accusing tone in Rhodey’s question. Not understanding why they were staying at all if that were the case. The alpha in him not wanting to be left behind most likely. Being new to the pack and not having accepted Steve as his pack leader yet was probably causing his instincts to challenge the younger alpha’s command, no matter the logic behind it. Tony was worried a fight would occur and was ready to jump in and soothe the situation as much as he could.
“Oh,” Tony sucked in a breath. He never thought he’d be so thankful for his magic. “That’s good. That’s… there’s two.” His mind was still circling on that bit of news. “Steve there’s two.”
- I can’t speak for Steve. That’s a conversation meant just for the both of you, but you have to believe me when I say Steve has waited for far too long to throw you away like you think he will.” Jan sounded so confident, so
“I know.”
Hank gave a more sedated greeting, “Good morning,” while Loki gave no greeting at all. He just rested his chin on his hand and stared lazily.
“Who’s turn is it this time?” Bucky said as he stripped his armor off.
Tony decided to just play along instead of making the child feel a fool. “Is that so? Well, you better grow up fast.”
“I’m sure Steve will show you all the beautiful spots we have around here,” Jan said, shooting Sam a look. “And even if you do more than walk it’s none of our business.”
Tony hummed, remaining in place and closing his eyes to rest them. He was just going to rest for five more minutes. Just five.
“We got something for you. You need to get down so you can get it. Come on. Down you go.”
“I think they are! They are den omegas.”
“Ugh,” Clint said, appearing as revolted as a canine could. “Doing it in public. In front of us all. You two disgust me.”
“Tony I'm telling you I am. You may not believe me and I don't know why you're so adamant not to, but I know what I want and that's getting to know you. I'll court you day and night for the rest of our years if that's what it takes, as long as you let me.”
On their way out of the building, Steve handled what was left of their business with the owner. They thanked her and with a wave bid goodbye, much to Tony’s relief. Leaving meant finally getting food and he was starving at that point.
“We don’t need a scent for me to want you, Tony. You just have to ask.” Tony released an undignified squeak when Steve suddenly thrusted, tugging and pulling his walls with his knot.
“I will.” Tony guessed now was a good time as any to get talking. He hoped Hank wasn’t too harsh in his reprimand. While deserving, Tony didn’t believe he’d be able to handle it without his emotions peaking so shortly after his heat. The last thing he wanted was for the image of the Avengers soiled by their omega crying in an Inn.
The Avengers could help, maybe, in finding them, once he got their good graces to deserve asking them for aid.
Tony frowned and thought about it. Now that Steve had mentioned it… on more than one occasion he had caught everyone appreciate how tight Thor’s pants looked on him. He had assumed it was to admire his thighs… but it was always from the front.
“Try to get some rest, Tony. You’re going to need it.”
Steve feels bile rise up as he recalls the taste of it. The taste of his best friend’s blood in his mouth. He has to pause the footage to run to the restroom and throw up nothing. Nothing but the water he forces himself to drink. His appetite having been long gone.
The silence that follows was near deafening. Rogers had no words. He scowled at Tony with a look that could kill a man, but miraculously Tony was still standing and Tony could clearly see a strike of red across Rogers’ face that didn’t come from their earlier arguing.
He had been right from the start. The Avengers bothering to talk to lowly omegas such as Bruce and himself and Steve holding his hand and letting him borrow his coat and showing him the slightest hint of interest. It was all a prank, payback for Tony having run into the traveling pack that morning without warning because the golden wolf Tony was currently looking at was the same wolf he had ended up rubbing noses and nearly colliding with.
Right as they were about to reach the stairs Tony stopped abruptly. Steve, ever the worried one, frowned in concern. “Tony?”
“You think you can just come here and take the spot for a pack that we deserve?” Prior looked as if he was about to strike but before he could make his move Vision came barreling down and rolled over his foot.
Tony frowned and looked towards the distance, not believing there was truly nothing. They found this place by moving the wall that he presumed was the only opening and it was no coincidence that the land was similar to the very land they had discovered and cursed them. There was something, even when there was no statue to curse them further. There was something.
the Hulk was. No one except for Tony, Rhodey, Jarvis and Vision, and from what Tony had seen, Natasha.
“Well?” Hammer shook him. He always hated being ignored. “What will it be, Darling?” He inhaled. Took in a long sniff. The grip on Tony’s throat suddenly tightened, causing him to choke. For a brief second Hammer’s face grew darker. Murderous. He looked ready to kill Tony on the spot.
Tony understood a thing or two about fear. He was aware of it. He wouldn’t want the others to ask him questions he didn’t want to answer either. “I won’t say a word, but will they be all right?”
“My past is nothing unique,” managed with no emotion. He was actually surprised at himself for being able to say something nearly as expressionless as Loki. Maybe it was to spare himself reliving the nightmare that was his life, or maybe it was to spare Steve from discovering how broken and tainted he truly was, but the idea of sharing his past closed him off instantly.
Bravery was just so… difficult.
“As flattered as I am, Tony, it’ll never work out between us,” Bruce chuckled and sat down on the table in order to wait for their meal.
Jan followed along, “and now because of his new environment and because of Steve, he’s entering a normal cycle again?”
“Let him calm down a bit. He’ll be raring to play some more once he’s dried up.”
“You are really lucky Steve isn’t here right now,” Jan growled. “I have half a mind to skin you. Steve would have already made you into boots.”
Steve looked to be straining from saying something. “Not doing any recruiting today I’m afraid. Perhaps another time.”
“I had a best friend who’d growl at anyone who looked at me wrong when I was growing up,” Tony said before he really thought about it. It just slipped out.
will walk away after a night with him.”
When declared good enough, Colonel Jim tumbled away and Tony ordered another to join him. Thor marked his turn by stomping over, ready to bulldoze anyone in his way. Bruce continued to snore on his shoulder. Thor leaned down and gave a great big smack on Tony’s forehead, earning himself an indignant squawk from Tony. Tony still kissed his cheek and dragged him down further to kiss Bruce’s forehead.
Tony blinked at the last part. The snake knew of Steve? “Who are -?”
“I can search from the skies if need be,” Jarvis offered, spreading his wings and ready to take off.
Tony thought belatedly. Loki had just used a spell on him to prevent distress from happening.
He’d say the word family lightly now. After having joined the Avengers pack, having his Rhodey, his Pepper and Happy, his Jarvis and Vision with him, he finally understood the true meaning of ‘family.’ It was clear, after spending so much time with his packmates and having a basis to compare to, Hammer and Stane were not, and have never been, his
He knew the same saying fell on their packmates as well. Though it was shocking to see it in person, the sight of every, single, one of them standing by the road near the mansion and pacing back and forth with concerned and impatient expressions was enough to nearly make Tony’s eyes water. And the pure relief they expressed when they noticed the two wolves making their way towards them was the sole reason one or two tears escaped him.
Heavy steps crunched on the dead leaves of the ground, signaling the arrival of the Hulk. It grabbed everyone’s attention, including Jan and Hank’s. All except for Steve, who began to groom behind Tony’s ears. Not appearing worried one bit and choosing to focus on what he believed to be more important matters. That apparently was the act of giving Tony affection. Tony suspected his heat had something to do with it and if their environment had been appropriate, no enemies and perhaps no packmates, he would’ve indulged in everything Steve was willing to give him. It had been so,
“What question are you talking about?”
Vision came rolling on the corner of their eyes and gave Rhodey a good, affectionate, repeating bump on the head accompanied by a high whistle that made them cringe and lower their ears. “When did you both get so damn rambunctious?” Rhodey said in-between Jarvis’ pecking and Vision’s bumping.
Tony wisely kept his mouth shut as he was led around the water and towards the opposite direction of his home. Pepper continued to struggle and attempted to call for help, but with the cloth wrapped around her mouth, she was left with only muffled sounds that could barely be heard beyond the trees.
The brunette went right for a hug. Steve eagerly reciprocated it, grinning from ear to ear. Then Tony’s heart stopped for just a second when the blonde shifter went, not only for a hug but also leaned up to give Steve a kiss on his cheek. Tony noticed it was awfully close to the corner of his lips.
How could Steve say no?
Tony turned to join them and stops in his tracks when Steve skidded to a halt right before him. He pulled back as their noses touched.
“No more hiding, Tones. Please.”
“I would love to say he’s lying and we don’t actually get scared with his tricks, but what he lacks in running compared to us, he more than makes up for in jumping down from trees and scaring the fur clean off of us,” Clint grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest in a huff.
“And I’ll watch for the lovely Virginia Potts,” Peggy said, grinning when Steve and Bucky looked at her in surprise. “What? Just because I don’t advertise it doesn’t mean I’ve never read the comics. I was quite fond of Pepper. She was one of the few strong woman in comics that came out in the 40’s. Besides, without her Anthony and James wouldn’t have survived for half as long as they did.”
Bruce shot his hand out and landed it next to Tony’s arm, wanting to touch but unsure whether it would be appreciated. “
His mate proved it right. “This is the mixture I mentioned before. Hank dropped it off with the owner. According to this note, he’s going to wait with the Hulk outside and join the others when they arrive.” Steve held the bottle carefully before yanking the top off. He leaned back, ready to take a drink, and Tony reacted.
Tony and Bruce exchanged looks, remembering these shifters were the very same Avengers, famous war pack of the land. How was that possible?
Tony didn’t pay them any mind. His attention still on the door. Any moment now Steve and Sharon would walk in and march right up to Tony to talk about how their relationship will go forward. How they will share their time and who will be responsible for what.
“Steve? Could we head for the heat rooms? I, uhm...,” he kept his voice low. A bit embarrassed. He hoped his mate understood what he meant.
As a reward, Thor took it upon himself to grant Tony’s little wish personally and went to him upon the first day of Yule to be his friend for the whole day. While at first apprehensive at Thor’s presence, Tony soon warmed up when Thor revealed he received his letter and came to grant him his wish.
Steve didn’t answer, already closing his heavy eyes and dozing off. He might have felt mildly guilty for not even giving Buck a chance to decide who took up watch but sleep was too tempting. Not even a minute later he was dozing off to the soft tremble of the jet and its humming.
it was as if a lever had been flipped and he couldn’t believe this was his - his
“Four days?” Steve hummed in thought. “That is strange for it to last only one. The reason for it could be anything.”
Tony shook his head. Not in rejection or denial. Just in fond exasperation. To his alpha, it was really that simple. Just love. As most things in life should be.
“You know what,” Sam said as he walked back to his original spot and fixed two plates. “I’ll take it. Biggest compliment I will get here.” He placed the two plates in in front of Hank’s seat and Jan. “Just wait until you try Bucky’s cooking. You’ll never want to eat anyone else’s.”
Facing his past. Nearly impossible.
That made Tony realized that he had been looking at Steve’s smile for who knows how long and the Avengers had been watching him. He fought down the blush that threatened to appear on his cheeks and for the most part managed to hold it off, that was until he caught Bruce motioning to something to his side. Tony hadn’t realized that Steve had placed his hand over his uninjured one resting on the table’s surface, not exactly holding it but one muscle movement away from it. It was warm and comforting and such a sweet gesture that it made Tony feel happy for a moment. His eyes snapped to the alpha in question, heart speeding up.
Tony shivered. Promises always came at a cost for the promiser when it came to Hammer, and Hammer was going to demand something large if he was willing to allow Tony to carry his child to full term.
For being a war pack highly praised by shifters all over the east side of the continent they sure were energetic and free spirited and not at all in the serious way that was expected from warriors to behave like. It was safe to say Tony was surprised at how easy going they all were, including Loki, considering no one that somber would have put up with a pack such as the Avengers and not lose it.
in front of him.
Clint and Sam lowered their ears and responded to the sounds with their own whines, running to the edge and pawing at the water for Vision. Tony jumped to his feet and ran to the machine, knocking Jarvis off his shoulder and forcing him to fly for the river in the process. If he had to jump inside the water he’d do so without hesitation, his self-consciousness be damned. What he hadn’t expected was getting splashed down without even reaching the river’s edge.
The giddiness he had felt earlier returned and he couldn’t stop the laughter that bubbled up even if he tried. He was grinning, grinning and scrunching up his face because he couldn’t keep his eyes open and continue staring at the ridiculousness that was occurring over him. He snorted and covered his face with his sleeve, his laughter filling the air.
“I didn’t,” Tony, for all his want to carry a child to make Hammer happy, didn’t actually sat down and imagined himself in a happy family life with Hammer and their pup. He just could never bring himself to love Hammer.
Tony and Bruce scrambled to keep up. For a snake Loki was surprisingly fast and agile and didn’t let the grass or dirt slow him down. And while Tony had a glimpse of hope with how this was going to turn out something Loki had said got him curious. “You said your… pit left an hour ago?”
He prayed to anyone that wouldn’t be the case.
Bruce nodded in understanding. If anyone would know about others taking advantage and forcing you against your will, it was Bruce. “Know what? Don’t know what you’re talking about,” he repeated after Tony.
In the direction the alphas vanished to, Tony caught sight of a golden dingo rushing through the trees and a coyote right on his tail. Sam was catching up with Hank by the second and right when it looked like he was going to pounce a mighty roar broke through the trees and out jumped Thor, catching the two under his paws. The canines gave shrieks of surprise before tumbling under Thor’s weight. Thor stood proud over them and rumbled in his success.
With a groan Tony rested his head on the ground. While it was true he was able to handle the weight of the pile on him he was unprepared for the act itself and didn't have his muscles working to combat the mass and lessen the strain on his ribs and lungs. He wondered how Jan was able to run already when she herself took the near same weight he had, and by all accounts she was smaller than him, at least by a little. Taller sure, but how much strength did she possess in her thin frame?
“Do you feel the use of them will be required, Sir?”
“That was easy. I think we’ve found a sure way to chase Clint off now without a fight.” Steve made his way towards the bed to grab the visible chest plate. All hide with spots of iron. The iron covering fatal points on the torso and the hide layered just enough that any sharp objects would not penetrate unless forced multiple times.
told the alpha right from the beginning.  He knew what he was getting into, but he had thought himself capable of handling it when the time came, back when he had been too damaged to see. He had believed himself strong enough after years of living under Hammer’s care and surviving, but nothing he suffered through could’ve compared to this feeling. To finally have it within reach, only to be taken away, ripped from his arms. It would crush him.
“I’m sorry, I’m -”
“Don’t want to mess with her when that happens,” Rhodey agreed. “Let’s focus. According to the Captain it’s going to be a long walk with dangerous enemies. Let’s make sure we don’t give Pep and Happy a reason to worry about
Clint crossed his arms. Each step taken swaying his shoulders. “I’m not doing it, either.”
“My hat!” Peter cried in panic. A gift from his aunt and uncle, who were already struggling with money, about to be trampled by brute centaurs mere minutes after receiving it. Neither he nor Tony could do anything about it. They could only stare at it despairingly as the racing centaurs grew closer and closer, passing each marker as they got nearer.
Steve bared his teeth.
“I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry -”
The instinct to hide Vision away flared up. It was a simple question, but the alpha was still a stranger and still an alpha and Tony had no idea what he was capable of, and if the alpha suddenly had an interest on his little machine who knew what he would do to him.
Bucky wasn’t going to give up so easily. He pushed against Steve’s forehead harder in tempo with each name he said. “Steve, Steve, Steve, Stevie, Steve, Steven, Stevo, Stove, Rogers, wake up.”
Sam’s words echoed in his head.
Hesitant, because he couldn’t bring himself to remove the warmth but it had to be done, he laid a gentle hand over the wolf’s head, petting softly and tapping a finger to encourage wakefulness. Steve stirred and the twitch of his ears were the signal that he was conscious, but instead of getting up like Tony had hoped he decided he still wanted to sleep and tucked his face inside the coat Tony was wearing and rest his snout over his side.
be thinking about is,” Sam gestured to Jarvis and Vision, “telling us about your two friends here. I'll take a guess and say Jarvis here isn't like any regular cockatoos and we don't even know where to start with Vision. No offense to you, little guy. We don't know how to talk about you.”
A life of misery. Continued as if nothing had changed. As if Tony had not just lived the best months of his life under love and care.
Leave it alone.” Tony backed away when both Rhodey and Steve moved closer to him. The former seemed to realize how much Tony didn’t want this subject to continue and nodded, silently promising to not say another word.
. Tony ended up crashing with another shifter who thought he was being rude and shoved him to another shifter who repeated the process. Many were shouting “Watch it!” and “Move” as they played a game of ball with him.
“Now, now, my Omega. Don’t be so crude. It needs a little fix-up sure, but nothing so bad to warrant that reaction,” Hammer grinned. “It’s because of you that we have to settle down with this, you know, but on the bright side, no one will bother us here. We’ll have all the privacy we could ever want. All for us. Aren’t you happy?”
Rhodey gave the separated wall chunk a few more pushes before a loud crack happened and it suddenly slid without resistance out of his grasp and further in. The three watched it cautiously until it vanished and fell out of sight. They continued to stare long after it was gone, refusing to move until they were absolutely sure no danger was going to come out of it.
There was no color on him, he was sure of it. He was probably as pale as the white pants he was wearing.
Steve’s tongue twisted and pressed against his skin as he bobbed his head up and down. When Tony managed to control his movements and stop trying to stab his mate Steve held his erection with one hand and pulled away to breathe. The friction never stopped, but Steve’s dry hand prevented any pleasure from happening, nearly chafing his skin clean off. Now
Tony blinked. “Uh, sure. I have no idea what’s going on, but sure.”
“My reaction was uncalled for, especially in a moment where you were very clearly distressed. I ignored the signs and only thought of saying my peace. I didn’t consider what you were going through.” Hank sighed, appearing uncomfortable. “Emotions aren’t my strong suit.”
Tony ignored the little pain in his chest. How lucky they must be to have the opportunity. The one thing he could never do. “Not all war packs. The Avengers pack was formed with young shifters. I don’t think starting a family is in their minds yet. Could be they’re just curious to see the potential.”
“All right, all right, no one will follow into the bath,” Steve chuckled, twitching his bitten ear to release it. A wet tongue licking the base of Tony’s hairline on the back of his neck soon started after Jarvis wandered back over to nest next to Vision.
His Steve. His Bruce. His Rhodey and Pepper. His pack. His
“Not a bit. They were completely ridiculous,” Nick said with a roll of his eyes. “But they surprisingly lasted a while with the change. That is until the end when they traveled to Sweden in their last issue.”
He couldn’t let that happen.
Under Stane’s icy glare was a stern look. Disapproving and displeased. The look a parent would give their child when upset after the child had been caught doing what they weren’t supposed to. A look Stane often gave over the years when Tony was under his care. A stare he continued to give now as if Tony wasn’t over forty years old.
For two weeks, Tony stayed silent. It was all he
“Beautiful, for one,” Sam said, “gorgeous, breathtaking, sensational, elegant, handsome, charming, ravishing, graceful, take your pick.”
One of which, who had been present near the start, was making her way to him now. Pepper. Beautiful as ever and a light that couldn’t be ignored.
All right, this was going to be interesting.
The one facing Pepper spoke next, “I had expected to meet you again in your full bodies and yet I come upon you still trapped. Can’t even win against pathetic humans.”
Clint clutched his chest. “Rejected. Woe is me. You want me, right, little guy?” he asked Vision.
“Yes, Sir,” the three of them said.
There weren’t many that surrounded them to start with but they dropped like flies in no time. Tony had been almost… disappointed, but he was also grateful. He hadn't gotten injured. Rhodey hadn’t gotten injured. Bruce hadn’t… Bruce wasn’t even there anymore. The spot he had previously kneeled on was empty and the omega was nowhere to be seen. Tony near panicked at the thought of Bruce having been hit in the crossfire or taken while Rhodey and Tony had been distracted.
“Nothing that the pack won’t know until I’m ready to reveal it. They can send whoever they want, but my answer will be the same.”
“No.”
Belly not so full but not starving either Tony was set to join his pack for a travel for the first time. Outside they all made their way. Jarvis at one point joining him on his shoulder and Vision sitting comfortably in a bag held by Rhodey. Pepper and Happy followed them outside but didn't join them further than the front door. They waited patiently while Steve ordered everyone to double check their items, made sure everyone was well and prepared and gave a quick speech for morale sake.
“No it’s not, it’s
Much to his mortification his stomach let out a loud rumbling. One that no Avenger, no matter how far they were currently lying or sitting, shifted or not shifted, were unable to hear. All eyes turned to him, each Avenger looking almost shocked to hear such a loud noise. Even Loki, who did an incredible job keeping his face expressionless, eyed him critically. None of their reactions compared to Steve, though. No, he was looking at Tony as if Tony had obtained a wound and was bleeding out. He appeared seconds away from demanding to know if Tony was alright.
Sam shook his head, giving the blonde beta a long look. “Modesty.”
Couples:
“Rogers, you and I both know I’m just going to ignore everything that comes out of your mouth. Save the lecture. I’m not in the mood.”
What would Steve, respectful and modest and a hero, think if he were to know of it? Would he run away? Turn around the moment he could and take back all the small courting gestures he had done? Refuse to take an omega that had been used, and in such a humiliating manner? Tony wouldn’t. The memory of those pasty and out of shape bastards staring at him, drinking in every detail, as if he was a slab of meat to sink their teeth into and envy because they’ll never have a taste.
A particularly loud moan escaped him when Steve reached down with both hands to grab the base of his dick and sneaked two fingers in his folds with the other. Out of sync and with no rhythm his alpha stroked with a rough edge and rubbed with a gentle touch. Tony had to grab hold of Steve's legs for balance when his hips rocked back and forth. His toes curled from all the sensation numbing his control over his body. His legs jerked and his nails dug into the meat of his alpha’s thighs. At some point he had thrown his head back and rested it on his alpha’s shoulder, crying shamelessly next to his ear along with the wet, slapping sound echoing the room. Face flushed red no doubt.
, Tony thought, feeling the disappointment stab him through his chest. And he had been overjoyed by the attention he was receiving from the alpha, from the Avengers. Now, however, he wanted nothing more than to crawl in his and Bruce’s shared shack and curl up and possibly sleep for two days straight, or for as long as it took to forget about the Avengers in general.
New outlook, new experiences, and a new mark. Tony was ready and eager to finally appreciate his new life and love Steve with all he had.
“Rhodey?”
“Oh, thank you,” Bruce grabbed the stone and placed it over the fire, arranging fish from the ones given to him and given to Tony.
On the roof there were what looked to be smooth branches creating a web of thin curving bridges. Some of those branches connected to trapdoors that seemed to open to the second floor. That was one way of reaching it, Tony thought. He certainly won’t be using it. Thankfully, on the left side, all the way to the back, there were a flight of stairs. The Avengers each disappeared up those steps, leaving Steve and Natasha to apparently give Tony and Bruce the tour.
“I found I’ve forgotten how to walk,” Loki said dryly.
“No one is tying anyone up,” Steve said in a tone that suggested that was the end of that subject.
Tony found Steve’s sheer will to resist incredible. As far as the alpha knew he had a willing body straddling his lap with clothing the only thing standing in the way. Tony’s body was giving off the scent of heat, of an omega ready to mate, and yet Steve still stopped himself to think about his well-being. That made Tony want to please him even more. Steve deserved it and Tony wanted to show him how much he loved the alpha. If that required him pleasuring his mate with his body than Tony was willing to do it, pain and all. For Steve it was worth it.
He was ready to accept going for days without any knowledge of his packmates when Rhodey suddenly pulled back. His eyes shined with determination. “A little moral support never hurt anyone. Come on. Just the thought of standing idly by and doing nothing is getting my fur all mangled.”
the little things without blowing them out of proportion? Why did he have to make a situation more than it was? Steve had only offered an option for them. Tony was the one who created an unneeded scene.
Tony felt his ears perk up. Natasha? Tony couldn’t imagine anyone managing to scare Natasha and live to tell it, but he guessed if anyone could it was Bruce. He might walk away with his limbs attached. “You got Natasha?”
Tony’s eyes never left the window. Surely if green light was present Loki was still possibly awake. Could be because he ended up getting the task of keeping an eye on him and Steve, even though the serpent wasn’t actually watching them, or it could be because Loki couldn’t sleep.
Bucky huffed, making Tony instinctively lower his eyes and his head. Tony had no right to make eye contact with him. His second in command was about to berate him for what he had done, ensue his punishment, or at least he was meant to, but a growl from Rhodey put it all at a stand still and before he knew it Rhodey had moved in front of him, making himself a barrier. Rhodey lifted his front leg over Tony, making his chest cover his entire front and continued growling. The display made Steve growl back and he took a paw forward.
“No.”
It was his finest work, his pride, and he had to hide it away in shame after Stane had used those very same gauntlets to ‘test’ their power and hurt the innocent they were meant to protect. Then he had to steal his own work in order to prevent them from ever being misused again.
“We’ll handle that,” the first beta said. “Come on, deer hunting time.”
Apparently, their sorry excuse of a conversation was too painful to watch. The Avengers sitting nearest to them facepalmed and groaned while those furthest were a mix of disbelief, annoyance and somehow found the whole exchange hilarious.
“Thank you,” Jan huffed.
"Promise me to make it worth my time,” Hammer grinned. All his teeth were showing. He was a predator openly staring at his next opportunity. “I’m looking for the next big sale. The arm that will bring down armies, decide administrations and crown kings. All unleashed within someone’s very
“We’ve been trying to hint on it, but obviously it’s not working,” Sam continued.
This was the very last issue of the comic ever printed before Marvels was completely canceled. Many who believed they were the true fans for fighting against the changes cheered for the cancellation, claiming it was the first and final action to giving the comics the respect they deserved. Steve, on the other hand, was disappointed. He wanted to continue reading about Stark’s adventures, wanted to continue reading about the friendship between him and Rhodes and Potts. He didn’t care what direction the comics went to so long as they kept the characters the same. Tony, Rhodey and Pepper still said and behaved how they always behaved since the start and that was all Steve needed. Sure, he missed the famous silver armors, but so long as the comics still had Tony Stark in them he didn’t care if dragons were involved or mermaids or even elves.
While he had been busy with his internal monologue Clint had finished removing his armor and was down to a simple shirt and breeches. The shirt was gone before long and revealed a toned torso that had Tony gaping a little. It had been a long time since he was allowed to look at someone else without repercussion. Whenever one member of Hammer’s pack stripped down in order to shift Tony had always looked away. Hammer hated it when he stared at someone other than himself and always reminded him of what would happen if he caught him gazing at any of their pack-mates. Tony had always been careful not to. Ironically enough. It wasn’t as if any of them had anything to drool over. They were business shifters after all. They were mostly pasty with bulges for stomachs and hardly any inch of muscle. However, the betas Hammer added for security measures, now
“Who’s up?” Bucky said through a yawn.
“I can’t breathe,” Jan managed from somewhere squeezed between Clint and Tony.
of him. Now, he didn’t want to know what his mate thought of him after all this.
Of course a bath couldn’t hurt, but Tony didn’t see it happening tonight. The Avengers all looked to have claimed a turn on the bath, and it appeared to be a first claim first serve situation. Maybe tonight Tony wasn’t going to get a chance to bathe, but perhaps tomorrow he’d have better luck.
Steve kissed his shoulder. “Stop overthinking it, Sweetheart. If you don't want us to bathe together just say so. I'm not obligating you, just asking permission.”
A particularly harsh pulse in his abdomen reminded Tony of his little predicament. The sensations were slowly moving from an annoyance to a desperate need. Already he could feel his groin pulsing with want and heat. It was taking everything in him just to keep his member still. His body was reaching the peak of his cycle and if they didn’t get a move on soon he feared he would enter the brunt of it out in the open where everyone would see.
“But I can!” he repeated. “I can do something, or I can remain hiding among the trees. I don’t care. I don’t mind it. I just don’t want to be left behind, Rhodey. I can’t stand not knowing.”
, no, how would it be possible? If it had only been Bruce then it wouldn’t be a problem. Bruce would just have to only mate in human form and not get the option to spice it up in bed with his four legs. However, this was two in one body, both Bruce
“I was hoping you’d forgotten that part at least.”
“No time as the present. Wouldn’t you say?” Steve had the audacity to give him a grin as he said it. “Do you trust me?”
They accepted the answer, even though most of them frowning signalled they wanted to say more of the matter. Small conversation continued as the three canine alphas finished their food. Through most of it Steve took the time to bump his elbow against Tony’s gently and in retaliation after the fourth bump Tony couldn’t resist kicking him softly. Steve changed from elbows to legs and continued kicking. At one point he hooked their feet together and swinged them lazily. Tony’s chest fluttered at that. He didn’t know if anyone noticed them doing it, seeing as he was looking at his plate as if it was the most interesting thing in the world and Steve sat straight and showed nothing, but he doubted they didn’t have an idea of it. They were the Avengers after all. Great warriors and incredible hunters. They had to have sharp eyes.
. Steve truly is a lucky alpha.”
It was a shield designed just for Steve and Tony had to admit he was impressed with his own handy work. Their pack and even the Howling Commandos agreed. They had sung their praise, commented on his skills and let Steve know that he had “picked a good one!”
Instead of Jarvis answering it was Vision who decided to make an attempt and released a very loud and high pitched sound right next to his ear. Tony shot up to his knees, clutched his chest and gave Vision a heated glare. The little machine didn’t look apologetic at all.
So I actually tried finishing this chapter up for the 12th, but ultimately couldn't make it. Three days late isn't that bad, right?
, hissed.
He gifted Tony a tour of his father’s Midgardian workshop. The very place where Odin created the gifts to have delivered every year.
“A most admirable suggestion.”
“Tony?” Ben called out.
(See the end of the chapter for
He blinked. “I- I… it’s not adorable!”
“On the contrary -”
Tony was well aware about the numbers. Hydra packs were notorious for going out of their way and doing what most shifters considered an oddity. Forming multiple packs of different numbers and sizes with different leaders in charge and all living under the same name. They were out there chasing the same goal, causing panic, and taking from others. Their name had long made them infamous, and while many war packs took up the mantle to take them down they were persistent and recovered their numbers within months.
“I’m thinking she’d just plain kill him,” Clint made a waving gesture. “She’s vicious if you disrespect her,” he said to the four who didn’t know who this ‘Peg’ was.
parental embarrassment.
“I don’t think they have the courage to say anything negative about you.”
Anything further was lost as their home got closer and out came two figures that Tony had missed so. Pepper and Happy came rushing out, welcoming them with smiles and open arms. Their near-two-months absence hadn’t been planned, but both Pepper and Happy had taken the shortcoming as victors. Going so far as to patron a couple of small businesses that had recently set up near Hattan in their spare time and gaining a little income besides the few coins Steve had sent over with the help of Jarvis and Redwing.
Tony nodded. In a daring move, he leaned his head close and licked Steve’s nose. The action was unexpected to his mate but it didn’t keep the alpha still for long. He crawled even closer until his front legs rested over Tony’s. He craned his neck and rubbed against Tony’s own, scenting him.
Their pack might tease Steve, might taunt him, might pull his tail occasionally, but in the end they respected their Captain and trusted him to lead them home. It showed when every single one of them listened intently. It showed when Thor, who was an alpha leader in his own right, lowered his eyes in esteem. When Loki kept quiet. When Bucky nodded. When Natasha, Sam and Clint bowed their heads ever so slightly. When Jan, Hank and Bruce remained focused on his every words. When Rhodey, Pepper and Happy showed understanding in their eyes.
it was no burden at all, but he was an old wolf and, much like the saying, ‘old habits die hard.’ It was especially true when they were disciplined to his person in a manner that was meant to show ‘care’ by others he once thought family.
She must have noticed him struggling to find an answer. “I’m James' mate, or Bucky as everyone else calls him.”
The pack passed through the doors one by one, Tony and Bruce lagging behind with Steve and (to Tony’s teasing benefit) Natasha. Once they passed through the doors Tony found the amazement they experienced from seeing the outside of the mansion was nothing compared to the inside. It was grand with a shiny wooden floor, rugs on certain spots, display cases on the sides that showed off a collection of knives, patterned shields that held no purpose except for decorating the walls, pistols and one scepter placed on mantels, chairs scattered in no visible arrangement, one large table and a chandelier.
“You seem to do more than just clean it.”
Rogers’ hips jerked up, rubbing against Tony’s own. It quickened Tony’s heartbeat. His own dick was now throbbing in his pants. Hot and angry from being denied release earlier and wanting more. His hips moved without his say, searching for that friction. Searching for anything. It burned his body in ways he had never felt before. In ways no one had ever managed before. None of the woman and never once with his hand.
“Why is there a bird on his shoulder?”
Tony remained curled up on the ground when Steve finally joined their little circle. The alpha was shifted and walked carefully to his spot, remaining calm even when he noticed Rhodey awfully close to his mate. Tony noted the way his alpha narrowed his eyes but held himself back to whatever he wished to say or do. He also noted how his alpha’s eyes were still dilated, remaining interested.

“Is too.”
of Ty, grabbed the hat that was waiting innocently for its impending doom and moved out of Ty’s way seconds before Ty plowed him over. Steve skidded to the barriers, jumped and disappeared into the scrambling crowd, trying to move out of his way in a panic.
Steve looked at him in wonder, making him squirm a little. “That’s incredible that you understand.”
for the very reason he had once feared would put his alpha off. For being a brazen omega with uncontrolled urges. The reason Steve now seemed to be eagerly taking part in and even encouraging.
He was carrying. His and Steve’s child. With Hammer and Stane holding him captive.
“And if I’m right?” Tony failed to notice the small fear in his voice.
Undeterred, Tony went anyway. What he finds was Steve hanging out with another teen. Friendly and very close, like peas from the same pod and glued to the hip. The best of friends.

was scrawled on the bottom. Messy and in red. He wants an item for his mother and a friend for himself. He’d been good all year. Had helped with chores and had gotten good grades. All he wanted was a friend to have fun with.
“You do?”
Heading for their shared shack for the Avengers to finish eating their meal was probably a bad idea. For one, the shack was too small to fit them all in. For another, that was Tony’s and Bruce’s shack they slept in and they still weren’t absolutely sure about the Avengers. One instinct that all shifters shared was the need to protect their dens, their little homes, the place they rested in from outside dangers. Other shifters outside their pack were dangers for sure and since the Avengers were a well-known war pack, they were definitely
“Only a day-long heat? Is that normal?”
“What are you thinking, Captain?” Natasha asked for everyone.
“Luckily for you we’re here. No need for rod making,” Clint flicked his tail and posed. Turning to Sam he said, “Whoever catches the most fish wins.”
The Captain’s shining blue looking into his own brown eyes. Tony found in those blue eyes, as the Captain continued to stare, unspoken emotion swirling in them.
There was something to be said about the manner in which Justin Hammer presented himself.
He wasn’t ready for it. He was scared of the inevitable outcome that was slowly making it’s way to them. He just hadn't expected the outcome to happen so soon by
“I am afraid it is not my story to tell,” Thor looked grim. “This is a fear placed upon them a time ago. Mayhaps one day they will speak about it, when they feel it proper time. For now it is best to allow them to heal. Avoid bringing said subject as best as you can.”
“I’m sorry I never told any of you.”
“Ready to go. I don’t know about you but I just want to lay down.”
The sound of footsteps making their way down signalled the return of their alpha leader. Steve was wearing nothing but a simple loose, white shirt and loose pants and no boots. Even though there was no shape or form thanks to the looseness of the clothes Tony still appreciated the sight he created, as if having just recently woken up.
“Maybe, but it will be all for nothing. I’ve finished them already. I’ll be revealing it soon. Just wait until Steve and the others come back. I have something for everyone.”
Sure they had shared a table and had talked a bit and changed their stranger status to that of acquaintances, but this was their shelter and centuries of survival had engraved the instinct to defend their den deep in their subconscious. So in a silent agreement, they had decided going to their shack was a bad idea, and in another silent agreement with the Avengers they also decided staying in the common area was also a bad idea. Unless, of course, they wanted a repeat with all the betas and omegas surrounding them.
Steve placed the missing bits at the end, “And you want to see if they can become allies to us.”
He didn’t flinch when he felt Jarvis land on his shoulder. “Sir, please, believe us when we say you appear phenomenal. Captain Rogers will not be able to keep his eyes away. Neither will the residents.”
“Not sure that makes me feel better, but I’m glad you both managed to join in even without the running.”
“We can always get those bones of yours stronger.”
Steve leaned in, closing the space between them. Nose to nose. “When you ran into me the smell didn’t change. You still smelled of home. Now more than ever. You’ve given me love and now you’re growing my family. You’re asking me why. The simple answer is, I love you.”
“Keep that promise and there’ll be rolls included in your payroll. Nothing like warm sweets after a hard day's work.”
Tony steadily realized what she meant by that last statement. All of their packmates, from Rhodey down to Loki, had moved to surround Tony and Steve sometime during the little conflict. It wasn’t an obvious circle. More as if they shifted just a little to enclose them both from danger. Their fronts facing the direction Peggy and Bucky stood.
forward with all his might. His right gauntlet released a blast of energy, white, bright and full of bone-breaking force.
His searching must have caught Steve’s attention for his alpha gave a questioning look. “Something wrong?” Tony barely heard him over the loud clattering of dishes and the loud and cheery voices of their pack and friends.
“I thought we agreed you’d save your breath. I don’t want to hear it. My subconscious doesn’t want to hear it. Jarvis doesn’t want to hear it. Save it.”
” Clint added, saying his name as if it was a curse.
Silence fell over them. A very tension filled silence, until, “Then I’ll be returning to the shacks. Nothing else I can do. You, on the other hand, will be staying with them.”
“That’s her. Met her already, have you?”
“Hi, I’m Tony.” The kid smiled.
He had to think about it before he realized the meaning. A pillow went flying and striking Steve’s head when he did. “
The beta gave Steve a seductive smile and offered his hand. “Hi, I’m Prior.”
He had to take Tony back home. Back to his Midgardian life and back to his father, but much to his shock Loki stepped in. His little brother fought him tooth and nail to allow Tony to stay.
“A house is on fire,” Bucky continued trying, “Clint fell down a well, Sam fell off a tree, Thor ate all the sweets -”
“I’m not

“It was Rhodey who told us. Sent us a letter about you becoming packless and going out to search for you. We couldn’t just sit still and do nothing.”
want to court him?”
Steve led them to the trees, stopping at just the edge of them and claiming the spot to place their clothing. While everyone was busy grabbing the edges of their shirts and pants Tony rushed to the nearest tree to hide behind and take his shirt off. He ignored the scars on his chest and made quick work of his pants, starting his shift even before taking them off.
From the way Sam explained it that actually sounded nice. Tony almost couldn’t wait for his first trip to Hattan and enjoy the sights. He remembered the town of Hattan. He had liked the town. Hammer had done plenty of business with the surrounding areas that required having to pass through Hattan. The place reminded him of his childhood hometown and the few good memories he had in it.
“I can’t wait to get home,” Clint said with a stretch. He raised his arms and arched his back, creating a satisfying crack of the bones. “I’m never leaving the bed once I touch it. Ever. I’m going to hog it all.”
“Just because Vision has a rune doesn’t mean
Tony gave his friend and cockatoo a dry look. The effect probably ruined by his pinkened cheeks, but still he tried.
That was until a four-legged body jumped over the fence from the outside, long after the racers passed by there, and joined in on the running. Tony was a little more than surprised when he recognized the body as Steve. The wild (or
“You don’t have to go,” Jan said, offering an encouraging smile. “Stay with us.”
Tony’s walls allowed Steve to enter with little to no resistance and in one smooth move Steve was all the way in. Tony released the breath he didn’t know he had been holding. His eyes were wide and he was staring at the ceiling in wonder. There was no pain, no bleeding, nothing of discomfort and Tony couldn’t believe it. The feeling of Steve pulsing inside him was evident enough it was all real and
“Yes,
Tony never imagined this to be his future, and while the path to reach it was a long and hard one filled with sorrow, heartache and pain he wouldn’t change it for the world if it meant Steve was at the end of it.
“You and Jan?”
Get ready! Here comes the fluff and the fun and the special someone!
Some of you may have noticed and some of you might notice now, there's a total number of chapters now!
“Please,” he tried again softer. “Please don’t leave me behind.”
He didn’t know if that was a good thing or bad.
“H-how many?”
“I rushed out the door when I realized you had only taken your bag. All your clothes were still in your room and I thought maybe you went out for a walk, but I couldn't find you anywhere. Going to town was the last option and I prayed all the way that I'd catch up to you on time to convince you to give us another chance.”
“Obviously,” Loki muttered and was ignored.
“Good morning, I wasn’t expecting you today, or even this early.”
While in his high he was vaguely aware of his alpha's erection still pressing against his lower back and the grunting sounds Steve had done in succession before feeling a string of heat land on his skin.
Hank and Thor appeared ready to jump over the table, not to harm him - and Tony must’ve been imagining it - but to sooth him. Even Loki looked ready to flip anything within his grasps. Tony must've been losing his mind if that was what he was seeing.
“I’m fine, why wouldn’t I be?” Tony hastily answered.
Sam accepted his response. “Fair enough, but if you’re ever curious just let us know.”
something worthwhile, and also helped him discover worth, and
. A chance at a child was now a possibility rather than a desperate fantasy. He had a wonderful and sweet mate, Jarvis and Vision were still with him, he had a pack with his best friends, he had a home and more.
Tony sighed and looked to the three shifters still awake. Bruce, even through his sleepy haze, chuckled at the situation he found himself in. Natasha and Bucky both looked at their leader and gave very exaggerated eye rolls respectfully, probably wondering why their leader was taking extreme measures and making a fool of himself for the sake of a joke.
“I believe owning someone is illegal now, especially if it involves famous comic heroes. The public will raise hell.”
“Since when did they join?”
“We’ll have to do it quick then. There’s no point if they all come out before we can. If they sound the alarm it’ll be all hands on deck.”
Tony whined when a finger slowly accompanied Steve’s attentions entered him, rubbing softly against his walls before the finger pulled back and entered again. Two stimulations and now Tony had no control of his legs as they spasmed. The pleasure going through his body was intense and overwhelming. He had already gone through one climax, and while his dick didn’t seem interested in trying again, his cunt was pulsing with heat and want and soon with Steve’s gentle and skilled care he was reaching his peak again. He arched high when his second orgasm reached him and cried in an ecstasy he was unfamiliar with and couldn’t believe he had been living without.
“No, but they are the most important household item. Therefore we worry about pots and pans first.”
Ultimately the town let him be. Steve didn’t cause trouble and the town saw no issue in his wandering, but that didn’t necessarily mean the townsfolk were welcoming either. The spiteful and angered folk of Nome would sometimes go out of their way to let wild centaurs and fauns know where they stood. Often that meant screaming and throwing items at them.
. Adults have sex. If my slutty behavior offends your delicate sensibilities then look the other way. It’s as simple as that. All you and the Avengers need from me is Iron Man in top shape. I’m always in top shape. Leave me alone.”
He felt the feathers puff up against his skin, not from any tension but from the affection in the words. “Always, Sir.”
“If you want to I’d really like to do it again.”
This one's a doozy and sorry it took so long.
The only thing running through his mind was how handsome the alpha was, even though he was staring at Tony in pure disbelief and gave him a rather unflattering look. Then the eye contact was broken when one of the shifters in the crowd shouted “Get out of here, old man!” His thoughts quickly changed from how handsome to how completely
With a shove, Tony was put in the cell. The bar door was rusty and beyond use, but the cell still held purpose. It enclosed him. Made sure to mark where exactly Tony was expected to be.
, Tony found himself thinking.
know?
Tony’s sighed in relief, grateful for having Bruce by his side. “Yeah, I think it’s time for lunch.”
A moan got stuck in his throat as Steve licked at his thighs, cleaning at the dry slick he had produced earlier. It only caused more slick to coat his skin in a new fresh layer. Steve held no quarrel licking that up, too. His thighs, his folds, every inch of skin within his reach the alpha licked and pinched. All Tony could do was remain still and remember to breathe. It was made difficult with Steve.
His heart jumped when hands grabbed his hips, thinking Steve got impatient and was ready to take matters into his own hands. Tony instinctively hunched and readied himself for the pain that would flare, but it never came. Those hands didn’t force him down like he had expected. No, those hands lifted him
“No, I don’t think so. Looks like you both are having a lot of fun there,” he said as he began stripping his boots, Steve’s blue coat that he carefully folded, and his waistcoat, leaving him with nothing but his shirt and pants.
Tony refused to admit it, but he knew for a split second he had pouted. Face flushed and pouting, he could only imagine what a sorry image he created, and Steve was not helping as he proceeded to tighten his paws and hold Tony even closer.
“The others talked about you.”
“I'm sorry about Bucky,” Steve’s blue eyes swirled with shame that he had no reason to carry. “His mouth tends to run sometimes without him thinking. He doesn't mean to be rude or rash, unless he's talking to someone who deserve it.”
“I said I’d make you my omega when I was grown, and I have.” Steve had the audacity to shrug nonchalantly, as if Tony wasn’t in front of him reeling from the revelation he had just disclosed. “Simple as that.”
“No,” Tony admitted. “No they don’t.”
To his side he heard a chair get placed and Steve made himself comfortable on it, setting his plate down and smiling. “Good morning, Tony.” Besides him Natasha pushed a chair to sit next to Bruce. Bucky went around and made a spot for himself between Sam and Hank.
“Just seeing where you were,” Tony whispered, receiving a noise of acknowledgement before he place the coat back down and covered Vision. He patted the lump the little machine created with his sore hand, taking notice how it didn't hurt as much as the day before. Cautiously, he wiggled it experimentally, and felt relieved when only the soreness made itself evident, before settling his head and pushing back slightly so he could come in contact with Bruce. The warmth of the other omega’s back eased him and the presence of the pack - of
He paused. Now
Tony and Bruce rushed to their feet and gave each other a quick glance to make sure they were hearing exactly what they thought they were hearing. When they confirmed it they began running to the direction of the howl. Because he was on two legs Bruce began lagging behind, as did Vision, while Tony continued cutting the distance in a faster paced. The cockatoo still on Tony’s back sank in his claws in order to hold on and had his wings out and ready to take to the air the moment Tony reached their destination.
Steve had never been in love with something as much as he was now with these statues. Someone had created his favorite characters life-sized and he was struggling to keep down his excitement and releasing a very high pitched sound of pure joy. He didn’t even care that the person responsible had added features to them besides their wings. Steve loved it.
Once the party who was waist-deep in the water were clean enough, or at least acceptably so, they didn’t waste any time in splashing each other and rejoicing when they managed to land their targets. At one point Bucky had made the mistake of aiming for Sam, thinking he had a sure hit, only for Sam to duck under the watery projectiles in time and instead struck the Hulk’s face. The big wolf furiously shook his head, gave Bucky a rather intimidating glare that drained all color away from the alpha and pounced.
Hank ran a hand over his face, clearly trying to keep his emotions down. “We used to live in a town with a family pack. We were settled. Had our careers going. Jan a clothing designer and I an alchemist. We didn’t lack necessities and business was high. A perfect environment to raise one of our own, but it was difficult. We had agreed for Jan to carry, but after five heats with no results, we decided for me to try. I was no better,” he gave a decrepit laugh. “It took multiple attempts. So much that the very mention of heats left us anxious, but finally we were expecting and it was I carrying.”
This chapter is dedicated to those who have seen Civil War/are about to see Civil War. You are all brave souls and you make the world a better place. Come back to me safe and sound, ya'll hear?
Tony’s heart was beating rapidly.
Steve’s eyes widened. “Beta
Rhodey hummed in response and just continued to hold him. For a moment Tony believed he wasn’t going to do anything, allowing the alpha in him to bow to his instincts and keep any and all omegas safe. Something that Tony never had to worry about before with Rhodey, but time apart caused changes.
“May I remind you that you have already obtained Mister Rogers’ eye, Sir. And if I understand your Shifter appeals correctly Mister Rogers is aesthetically pleasing.”
This chapter might be disappointing, but I hope you enjoy Hulk's spotlight either way!
His alpha trailed his hand down to his side and gently pulled him upwards while leaning his head down, meeting his chest in the middle and kissing his scars. Kiss after kiss he placed, growing hotter and lasting longer with each one on different areas. Being pulled closer Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair in response, needing something to hold on to.
Thor received the letter days later, surprised and delighted to see it addressed to his father and not the fictional jolly man Midgardians had created and catered to during the winter festival. Even Loki had been shocked and later impressed by the Midgardian child.
Tony had heard the difficulty betas went through in order to trigger one or the other. The ‘balance’ they carried that allowed for both options also proved to be the reason for their difficulty. The sudden influx of hormones caused problems, took time and was not recommended until the season for pup rearing came upon them for the health of the betas in question. Female alphas and male omegas also struggled with this if they went opposite of what their orientation assigned. Female alpha pregnancies were on the difficult and careful side while male omegas trying to sire have a hard time even planting roots in their partners.
Steve barked an order and had the pack rearranging to best build a defense and offense. Once settled he picked up the pace and down the road the Avengers went.
Tony sat up, trying to regain mobility of his legs. “It’s fine,”
His nose led him down the hallway, down the stairs where he had to carry Vision, and across the common room to where he discovered the kitchen and dining area was located through a door connected with the common room. He stopped inches away from going through, remaining in place and hovering near the door. From his spot he could see Jan, Hank, and Loki sitting on the large circular dining table, chatting and waiting for what could only be breakfast.
He made a wounded noise. “I’m sorry. I didn’t - I wasn’t thinking… about my actions.”
“Down. Stop it.”
Loki gifted him with a ceremonial knife when he heard the news. “There is little danger this far north, but you never know who could come knocking behind this door. Use this well.”
“No, no,” Jan reassured.  “We just…” she looked thoughtful. “We could use a little help getting under Steve’s skin. We can only do so much, but with you catching his eye and playing along,” she winked at him. Steve released a rumble, and from the way he quickly stopped himself and appeared sheepish the rumble could’ve only been involuntary. It made her grin. “This is going to be fun.”
“You do, Tony,” Rhodey said, “and you're an idiot for leaving the pack and going alone when you're starting your heat. Even if you smell awful, you should never leave your company. Solitude is the last thing you need right now.”
War Machine’s voice is equally heard trembling, even through his filtered system. “
Tony always saw these shacks during his travels with his ex-pack and he remembered always giving the shifters pitying looks. A shifter without a pack was hardly anything at all on their own. A pack was everything for them. A home, a status, wealth, a
But when he turned and accidentally locked eyes with the Captain and received a wave and a shy smile he figured it couldn’t be that bad. He only wished the Captain would stop looking at him so friendly, so fondly, as if they were acquaintances when he had never met the alpha before in his life.
“Did they leave without you?” Tony hadn’t meant to make it sound as if the pack had abandoned Loki, but that was essentially what they did… right?
! You’re trying to kill us all.
Unable to resist the contagious laughter and antics Tony joined along. Another sensation joined his stomach along with his hunger. The pain that came from laughing so much in one go.
“Hasn’t stopped you so far.”
“If you cannot say anything that isn’t an apology than do not speak.” Through the doors Loki appeared, face annoyed and eyes stern. “You should not ask for pardon so easily. It is demeaning and pathetic.”
That should
Thank you everyone for voting again! Here is the winner of the tiebreaker!
The familiar sound of metal against metal stopped him in his tracks. He’d recognize that sound anywhere, engraving it in his very soul, and it was coming from the one building made from nearly black wood that gave the image of a home made of ash. There was no visible smoke, but surely this was where the blacksmith was located.
Tony felt his shoulders hunch ever so slightly. “I didn’t do anything for you.”
Thor was at a loss. He brought little Tony to make him happy, yes, but it meant to be temporary. A small light to brighten his day before he’s taken back to his unhappy life as the child of an uncaring man, broken and ruined by the loss of his wife. Odin was no longer in charge of the workshop. That leadership had gone to Thor many years ago, so ultimately it was his decision.
That left little of their pack behind. It was not enough to create the footsteps they were hearing. They were far too many and far too loud to be any of their packmates. The figures that appeared proved them right. None of them were their packmates. In fact, half of them weren’t even in proper shape to represent any of the Avengers.
Tony could feel his dragon wanting to burst out and sink its teeth into one of the hydra’s neck. He could feel it wanting to end its life once and for all even when this was the first time Tony came face to face with it. He could only imagine what Rhodey’s and Pepper’s own beasts were feeling. The manticore and griffin no doubt wanting to join the dragon in killing the hydra.
“How do you feel?” Jan asked carefully, cautious.
for goodness sake. His libido
“Where are you keeping him!” The new shifter commanded, completely ignoring Jan. “Where are you bastards keeping him!”
“- Hank is about to explode the place -”
“You don’t think I deserve it?” Tony challenged.
“You believe me, right?” Steve held his gaze. Stunning, blue eyes never faltering. Determined and strong.
A beast that sent their own into a frenzy.
Tony followed after Steve and Natasha with a bounce to his steps. Bruce was probably walking with his own bounce if he was as excited as he. He knew Jarvis was for sure, seeing as the cockatoo was puffing his feathers in anticipation. Overwhelming, almost, since he flew off Bruce’s shoulder and nested on Tony’s in order to curl up against his neck and nuzzled a bit. Vision was showing his own excitement by swinging as much as he could in the bag while Tony still carried it, earning himself a small bruise on his hip.
“Please,” Tony begged his alpha, and in turn his leader and his pack, “drop it.”
“Well, you called him an it,” surprisingly it was Steve that answered. “Last I heard, calling someone an 'it' is disrespectful and insulting.”
“If I were you, I wouldn’t raise my voice to me again. I’ve been patient so far, Tony. Your damn rat is the one who caused trouble, not me. I promised no harm. A quick death is kind of me. I would have tortured the rat. My leniency stops here. You will behave yourself or I will make sure you lose more than just that bird.”
The Avengers had already done so much for him. He had no right to ask of more. So with a heavy heart he put on a smile for them.
The red falcon that Tony assumed was this Redwing nodded, as if able to understand exactly what was said. He wouldn’t be surprised if the red bird could. Jarvis was proof enough birds, or even wild animals, in general, were capable.
“Nothing, absolutely nothing. Ignore any noise I created moments ago and let’s get back to our run.” Tony tried rolling to stand back up, but Steve placed all his weight down on him and kept him in place.
ask or force you to take anything that muddles with your body in that way.”
Tony had walked away from the exchange the moment he realized what would occur. Not wanting to witness the poor soul being nicked from their hard-earned coin. There wasn't much Tony could do to stop Hammer and Obie. He was only an omega after all. Instead, he had walked around the town a bit and watched parents and their children and the elderly sitting and enjoying the sun. There were family packs left and right. Packs meant for the folks who didn’t want fame or wealth and only cared for family. They raised children and cared for the elderly and kept an eye out for each other. These were the folks who stayed permanently in one place instead of traveling the lands. They were the reason why towns and cities existed.
omega, he had been the son of Howard Stark, the future of weapons and the future of an industry.
Tony blinked again, idly realizing he’d been staring at his alpha without response. “Yes?”
Being put on the spot and unprepared Tony simply blinked, frozen in place. Living with the Avengers as his pack had taught him that quick wit and sass that brought laughter was how they interacted and usually was encouraged, appreciated really. Steve even made the effort to laugh at any witty remark he attempted with them, no matter how horribly timed or plain they were.
In the middle of his seventh step he had to stop, instincts nagging him that something was wrong. He scanned his surroundings, finding nothing amiss, but something was causing his nerves and the hair from the back of his neck to rise. A bit unbalanced he pushed through the feeling and continued down to where the blacksmith was supposedly located.
His father thought it stupid to write a letter for someone who he claimed didn’t exist. Tony did it anyway. He wasn’t writing to Santa. Not this year. He was writing to Odin, who Tony had learned about months prior.
“Positive. When have I ever given you reason to doubt me?”
“Would you ask her that same question you asked Tony?”
“Sorry, Sweetheart,” Steve said with a little remorse, “It’s going to be uncomfortable, but we have to get a move on. Hulk can get you there faster.”
This particular forest had a collection of hyperaware rabbits. No matter how quiet Tony tried walking the forest floor every single rabbit heard him miles away and disappeared from sight. The only reason Tony managed to catch the last three was thanks to a very large part to Jarvis for knocking them down over and over until Tony got close enough to get them.
He couldn’t respond. The aftermath of the sudden burst of betrayal leaving his body cold and numb. His breathing became shaky.
Whoo, what a doozy this one was.
Without another word, both Clint and Rhodey began shooting their arrows and bullets in rapid succession. Having been discovered there was no point for discretion against the enemy and they weren’t going to chance it. Now it was a matter of breaking through and reaching the rest of their pack. Strength in numbers, and at that moment they surely needed the numbers. They were about to be overwhelmed by Hydra responding to the call; inside the fort and around the forest.
“Just making sure.”
Multiple heats? No wonder the mere mention of a packmate entering their cycle had caused Hank to lash out. While heats are usually perceived as a pleasurable and emotional experience, it was still a strain to the body. For a beta, who didn’t experience heats or ruts naturally, the strain placed was even worse. No amount of pleasure would make the exhaustion endured after worth it.
With every step, they got closer and closer and closer until Steve led them off the roads and into the forest with no accurate destination besides taking cover with the trees and sneaking deeper. At one point Steve had ordered a “now, Loki” and the serpent shifter was quick to hold his left hand out with the palm open to the sky, building up magic and focusing it. He whispered an enchantment Tony couldn’t hear and swiped his arm out in a half-circle to the ground. The green light he had created floated downward to their feet, swirling as if made of smoke and disappearing upon contact with their legs, in Vision’s case his entire body. After everyone received their dosed he nodded to Steve, spell in place.
For a moment they remained like this. Steve still had his mouth on his neck, kissing the tender skin. Hard breathing filled their ears as their bodies calmed down from their high until eventually Steve pushed his arm between the bed and Tony’s chest, held him close, and moved them so they were lying down on their sides. Similarly to how they had woken up.
He knew Tony was going and he wasn’t about to turn around, give into his instincts and order him put at the last second.
close to ordering them put, but he knew he had no right to, not when he practically begged Steve to take him along for the contract because he feared being left behind. Jarvis and Vision, similar to himself, didn’t want to get left behind either. He couldn’t go against them unless he wished to be a hypocrite.
have felt as endearing as it was, but the wide eyes that were looking at him as if he was a treasure, the most prized possession the little alpha could ever have, made Tony almost tear up. It was adorable and childish and made Tony feel
Tony interrupted them before their talked themselves hoarse. “It’s not that, I swear. I just don’t want to leave Bruce alone.”
Simultaneously, the ones who openly showed expressions smiled and waved at them in a welcoming manner. Jan and Thor patted the empty seats next to them cheerfully.
old. His age also stopped any chance with younger mates, so that prevented any possibilities from happening. Frozen in its tracks before it could even start. If his embarrassing first meeting didn’t send the alpha running the other way his age certainly would.
“Thank you, Steve.”
They both lifted their arms up in victory.
He curled around himself. There was a rational reason why he couldn’t do a thing. Fighting against Hammer and Stane and their pack alone was not ideal without his gauntlets. Even then it was cutting it close. Hammer’s pack had no qualms firing their pistols at anything. At most Tony would be able to punch once before a bullet pierced him. Taking him and his child down.
They still tasted the same, however. Nothing different there. He chalked it up as him being tired from their travels. Probably all in his mind. His nose would return to normal after a good and well-deserved rest. Yes, that was it. A nice bath first that had him struggling to get out of Steve’s octopus-like grip as the alpha had gained a habit during their travels to always place his hands on Tony’s hips and middle. No heated times since they were both tired. Just a quick bath and spending the last few hours of the day relaxing in the common area as the others took their turns bathing.
But how to ask him? He didn’t want to assume Steve would want to.
This was the other side of Steve he had yet to see, and now that he was he realized just how lucky he truly was. This man could have easily been a tyrant, could have showed off his strength in the most violent of ways, and still earn the same respect as now, but instead he was gentle, sweet, caring and took a great deal in protecting his pack.
The Avengers continued staring as Natasha offered more fish and then gave them a glare and a growl, causing them to continue what they had been doing and act as if they didn’t witness anything.
Tony thought and covered his eyes with his hands.
“Be nice.”
Thor would pat him on the back and congratulate him on another job well done. Then goes off to ramble about how if Tony had Asgardian years on him he’d nearly rival Zeus himself on his sexual ventures. Not a great thought when one considered how the Greek lightning god sired nearly half of the pantheon over there. The thought of Tony being the father to half of the Avengers was something he never wanted to imagine ever again. It wasn’t a pretty thought.
“Yours?” The Hulk said, his voice so deep with growls it echoed in Tony’s chest. He pushed his large, abnormal wolf arms forward to show Tony’s armor and clothing and gauntlets in his claws. He held them in an offer. That was awfully thoughtful of the giant wolf to pick up his items.
“Just keep walking. It’s not far from here. Say hello to the blacksmith for me, won’t you?”
Tony had long passed his time to be something worth cherishing, but he could imagine and possibly dream about it instead. It was as close to happiness and worth as he was going to get.
Mated. She was mated to one of his packmates. Who could that be? Loki? Thor? Was she a third in a triad relationship, much like Rhodey, Sam and Clint? Were his packmates keeping her quiet from him? They never mentioned anything… had they?
It would take a miracle for anyone to find wherever their destination was. A miracle, or a very stubborn man.
They all do as told and take three steps back before Hawkeye fires. Then it all happens so quick. The agent with the camera panics the moment Steve lunges forward. Everyone scatters, desperately avoiding him. The footage resembles the film phenomenon of found footage. The orders to run. The panicked sounds. The camera barely able to distinguish anything as the monster on screen chases after the films cannon fodder.
“You win this round, Jarvis. Next time you won’t be so lucky.”
Tony managed to stay on his feet and through the shoving and pushing spotted Vision again not that far. He maneuvered his body to be moved forward towards the little machine and just as he was about to kneel down and grab Vision someone said “Stop shoving already!” before they tripped him over.
Three more licks later and Steve decided his work was done. He was apparently still asleep because the next thing the alpha did was push against Tony, forcing Tony to lie on his back instead of on his side. Steve then continued to cuddle up over Tony’s chest, paws placed over his shoulders and snout still in place by his neck. The alpha sighed and made no further movement.
“Not anytime soon,” Steve said as he pulled Tony close to him. “You’re not getting close to a forge. Not in your current state.”
to join us, if you want,” Sam stressed the invitation and Tony was at a standstill as to why.
He hadn’t considered Steve joining him, however.
Tony wasn’t sure but for a brief moment, he thought he saw Steve almost glare at the beta. He accepted the hand either way. “Steve.”
“Enjoy something you see?” The alpha had a smirk on. Chest out in a small show, preening from Tony watching him.
Rhodey opened his mouth to say more but Steve was quicker. “I will not allow it and that’s final.”
Jan nodded in disappointment. “We can’t risk living smack in the middle of settlements in case enemies attack us personally in our own den. We don’t want to put the citizens in danger or cause property damage, but it is a struggle.”
The disbanding crowd made it hard for him to move much. It was so difficult he was forced to stay put for a solid minute or two as the bodies parted way. Something that frustrated him. Peter’s hat was somewhere and Tony couldn’t do a thing to find it!
He had half expected Jan to have followed him, or even Bruce after the Hulk bid his farewells, but seeing Rhodey appear in his line of sight with Jarvis on his back and Vision by his legs had been a pleasantry. He still didn’t dare lift his head up, however. Not from its spot on his front legs and his eyes aimed downwards.
“Oh. knock it off,” he muttered, glaring at the two. “I’m not a child. If I want to share the same room for the night I will and you both better leave if you don’t want to see.”
, Tony thought. “Don't go blaming me for your mistakes.”
“Tony,” Steve said softly. “I don’t want to push you into answering, but I don’t want you to be uncomfortable with us. Please, be honest with me, did anyone do anything you were not fine with?”
“Trust me, I’m not uncomfortable with this,” Steve’s eyes studied him. “Are you?”
Pepper recognized them, too, if the way she inhaled sharply and took a step closer to him were to go by. It was her feeble attempt to protect him, but they both knew, against the sheer number of shifters surrounding them, weaponless and without means to call for help, they were at their mercy.
Rhodey paused briefly when he reached him, most likely studying him, before going around and squeezing himself between the tree and Tony. Had Tony not known Rhodey as well as he did he would have begged the alpha to leave, to allow himself to breathe without the scent of his heat making him nauseous, but Tony knew Rhodey well, and he knew even if he asked Rhodey, the alpha would refuse to leave his side. So Tony kept quiet, hoping his scent wouldn’t be as potent at the start of his heat. Lying right next to the rotting corpse didn't give off the most pleasant smell after all.
“Sir,” Jarvis said softly as he perched on one of Tony’s arms and tucked himself against his neck, comforting him.
“Nice to meet you, Bruce. This little feathery menace on my shoulder is Jarvis,” Tony pointed at the cockatoo.
” Tony moaned when his mate pressed all he could. His erection pulsed inside. The heat Steve’s body released overwhelming. This was new and his mind didn’t know how to fully process the new sensations, but the pleasure was pleasure and his body reacted accordingly. He thrust up, wanting more.
The cockatoo snorted again before nodding. “I believe you are correct, Sir, but young Vision is prone to picking up conversations during our travels.”
“I’m glad you’re well.”
“Pretty sure Loki has us beat with that and will be holding that record close. Spells his clothes invisibile,” he explained to Tony when Tony gave them a questioning look at that confession. Made sense. “There a reason why you’re poking your head in?”
“Good. Be dears and open the door, will you?” he called out to the two betas nearest the fort. The brutes obliged and forced the doors open, their arms and legs straining from the force they needed to exert. “Welcome back, Omega,” Hammer pushed him through the door.
“What?” Tony managed to say just as the Hulk moved an arm under him, squeezing between his legs before lifting him up. A squeak of embarrassment escaped him. “Put me down!”
“You asked, Sir.”
“Steve…”
Tony pulled away with a shout and gripped Rogers hard as he came. His body twitched and trembled as he inhaled and exhaled heavily and willed his heart to slow down. His limbs were heavy and couldn’t hold on anymore. They went limp. Dangled uselessly by his sides.
Steve hummed in thought before crawling on the bed and leaning close to him, nose to nose. “Plenty of ways we can spend our time with. The note doesn’t say we can’t use our mouths or hands.”
“They probably thought I was somewhere in a ditch or something. Walk with me?”
“No, only the strong fight. They’ll end up hurting themselves if they do.”
He exhaled. They
“Hammer,” Stane interrupted. “We don’t have the time. Handle your dispute later. We have to go.”
“If we buried someone after catching them doing the do we would’ve turned over all the dirt in our territory a long time ago,” Clint said. His eyes were open now but his hand still covered his nose “Trust me, this isn’t the worst I’ve run into. I caught Thor with his pants down and let me tell you
“Oh, aye?” Rhodey stared at the cockatoo. “You both are adults now? You got a job then?” he deadpanned.
The television has remained untouched. Steve’s own thoughts are his source of entertainment and the view of the window his source of fear. The innocent people walking by, the couples, the children, the families, that could so easily be disrupted and destroyed by his own two hands.
Tony was unprepared and jumped a little when Steve suddenly turned around to face him. The eyes of the female shifters followed his gaze and pinned him down. Tony felt a cold sweat.
His ears flinched when he felt another flick, this time over his hip. He cautiously looked up when he felt a third flick and managed to catch Hank’s tail responsible. Hank didn’t say a word, but his expression said it all. Guilt, regret, hesitation. Tony hadn’t known how to react. Hank was to apologize, according to Jan, and Tony had wanted to prevent it, undeserving of it, but if he were to say something now as Hank built himself up it would seem ungrateful on his part.
Friend, perhaps? Perhaps doing so would earn him favors when finally asking the blacksmith if he could work. “I will. Thank you, Ma’am.”
Wait.
Tony felt so warm and safe and secure. So satisfied. So fulfilled. He felt almost untouchable. As if the worst of society couldn’t lay a finger on him. His past couldn’t touch him, nor could his fears and struggles.
“So what’s stopping you?”
“Thank you, Jarvis, for that observation,” grumbled Tony.
Tony ducked his head down. There was the scolding. Well deserved.
He hadn’t changed. Neither of them had.
“Harsh. You wound me.”
She eyed him curiously, most likely wondering why he of all shifters had asked her that question. From somewhere behind her Scott bounced over with excitement that shouldn’t be capable at this hour. “Blacksmith! Blacksmith, blacksmith, can I?”
“Thank you.” Tony stared at his lap, unsure on what to make of Steve’s kindness. Why did he care if he had gotten hurt? Plenty of shifters got hurt on a daily basis, and now that he thought about it he saw a few betas living in the shacks that had injuries. Why didn’t Steve, or any of the other Avengers, go to them instead?
But then again, Natasha didn’t appear as the type of shifter to waste her time on something as foolish as pranks, even though she was currently doing one on him. Had she been ordered by Steve to follow through and put up with their joke? That would explain why she was participating. After all, she looked like she’d kill any inconveniences that served no purpose and got in her way.
The egg was given to him by Rhodey as a gift. A white oval with brown spots that needed Tony to cup his hands together in order to hold it. It wasn’t a normal bird, Rhodey said as much. He didn’t reveal the species but he did say that the bird was unique, was a person in its own right, and extremely loyal to those who earned its respect. To this day Tony couldn’t figure out what he did in order to win Jarvis’ respect but the fair sized cockatoo, that should really be considered a giant owl since he took up Tony’s entire shoulder and stood taller than his head, refused to leave his side. When Rhodey handed Jarvis over he failed to mention Jarvis was a species of bird beyond the sea, wasn’t like any of the umbrella cockatoos around the area, was smarter than ravens, crows and even jays, and had the ability to learn
Tony didn’t see what had happened. His main concern was keeping Jarvis and Vision safe and so he stood over the little machine, pressing his belly against the metal body and shielding him. He had reached out for the cockatoo still on his shoulders with his mouth and gently sank his teeth in order to grab him and tuck him in next to Vision, curling himself around them. He was facing the ground and so only heard what had happened. There was a shot, a grunt from Bruce that stopped Tony’s heart, the ripping of clothing and then a mighty growl that echoed through the night. The raiders started shouting and screaming as the growling continued. The screaming and the growling continued and continued and continued until it all stopped at once, stopped just as fast as a candlelight being blown away.
Soon enough they were all ready to head for the town. Everyone remaining promised to meet up with them as soon as they were done. Jarvis and Vision were to stay with Rhodey and aid with the search. Something Tony was both grateful and worried about. Grateful because it meant they were not going to be subjected to his cycle. Worried because of the risk of finding more enemies. He calmed his nerves by remembering Rhodey would never allow them to get hurt. He trusted Rhodey to keep them safe.
The alpha crawled closer, licking one more time on his jaw before tucking his snout over the side of Tony's neck, in-between his shoulder and back of his jaw. Tony stiffened momentarily for having Steve so close to his unprotected neck. He didn’t believe Steve would mark his neck without permission, but Hammer had fooled him before. And he knew he shouldn’t compare Steve with Hammer - the alphas were completely different to each other - but the shock that Tony had felt when Hammer went for his neck for the first time without a single warning was unpleasant and nauseating and just so
Sharing his food with a mate, Tony’s head supplied. Steve was doing it again and confirmed it this time in his shifted form. He actually saw Tony as a potential mate.
Accepting his fate Clint shifted, his fur breaking through the skin and his bones changing. The dirty golden jackal Tony remembered from the previous night shook his fur and gave his tail a wag. The brown dingo that was Jan ran up to him and gave a pounce. The golden lion that could only be Thor followed soon after, knocking them both down in his excitement. They looked like they were about to start a wrestling match when a large dark brown wolf appeared and barked for them to stop.
“Tony,
“I was…” Steve's voice quivered a bit. “I was so
Tony looked up to him. Giant eyes glistening with purpose, but also with worry. Something no youngster should be feeling. “Can I go to him? Be his friend like Thor did?”
“W-what time?” Tony managed after getting his bearings back.
Slick meant he was moments away from succumbing to the need and they were still a distance from the town. Too far with the pace they were going. He wasn’t going to have enough time before it hit.
“No, leave it on, please,” Tony said, pleading.
Tony smiled. He’d love nothing more than to say he didn’t mind but the language barrier and difference in vocal cords between them made it impossible. So he was left to simply listen and hope his face expressed what he meant.
They walked down the stairs and made their way to the kitchen room without missing a beat. Bruce had been right about most of the pack already being present. The only ones still missing were Steve, Bucky and Natasha.
Fret not! This fic is not abandoned, just has many reasons why it was pushed back.
“Of course,” the alpha’s smile wobbled a bit. “We'll be leaving tomorrow. If we don't see you, then we'll know your answer and leave you alone. If that's the case then… I'd like to do something, with your permission.”
He basked under the shining sun, enjoying the sounds of the dirt and pebbles crunching under his foot. Then he felt Jarvis yank strands of his hair none too gently and his instincts began screaming all over again.
Tony wanted to pry, but he trusted his alpha and he trusted Rhodey. So he left it alone.
“Maybe we can share shoulders,” Clint suggested with a waggle of his eyebrows and a shake of his shoulder in an effort to tempt the cockatoo.
“He cast a kind of silencing spell and neutralizing spell on me and himself. No matter where we walk or step on there’s no noise from it, and we smell like nothing. As if we’re not even here.”
“Isn’t this-?”
way. The only reason I’m not trying to hump you is because you’re my brother and I have two potential mates already. I’m not affected, but I bet you anything Steve is out there already humping a tree waiting to get to you.”
Tony was listening, taking in the reasoning, but the possibility of ‘what ifs’ was too strong for his liking. What if - what if something went wrong? What if Hank measured incorrectly or mistakenly got the wrong ingredients that caused permanent damage? What if Tony’s bad luck reached Steve and out of the thousands of possibilities Steve ended up getting the worst?
” He shrieked. Only a little. Perhaps a bit more than a little.
“I’m sorry,” Hank mumbled. “I was fine all morning. I don’t know why…”
Steve continued grooming him well past the time he had estimated going to town and returning to the mansion. He was lying on his belly now, Steve settled next to him and licking down his shoulder. His dark fur shined under the sunlight. The parts where Steve had worked on were no longer mangled, soothed in place and running smoothly over his figure. The work was nowhere near done, but Steve had done a reasonable job with the time given to him that was signalled to a stop when Tony’s belly rumbled in hunger.
Tony swallowed. He was perhaps the luckiest omega around. “O-one day?”
“S-Steve, Steve - please -
“It is.”
Tony felt his stomach drop even before Steve finished the question. The idea didn’t sit well with him. In fact, the idea was painful to think about.
“Have I made my point clear?”
“Our Captain is able to smell misery in the air,” Loki finished without hesitation. “Your earlier show has left a large trail for him to follow. He is simply concerned for your well-being. A wonderful mate, is he not?” The serpent shifter lazily stared at him.
Tony waved a hand, not understanding why the kid was even apologizing to him. “No reason to apologize as long as you’re fine.”
“I know you didn’t mean to, Steve.” Tony kissed the golden locks. “I - I know controlling… and that wasn’t controlling. You were possessive, sure, but you never ordered anything of me. You just… became a second shadow to me. A very intimidating second shadow.”
“Right,” but it was a chance. His heat had returned and he might actually be able to
He sighed. Now what was he supposed to do? If he were to tell Steve the truth at that moment everything they had done would be for naught, but if he allowed it to continue it would just make everything worse… not only would Steve’s heart be broken along with his own, but their packs’ heart as well. They
“It matters not now. I have done what I came to do. You say you are unable to reproduce, but what I sense from you tells me otherwise.”
Ben?”
“The pains aren’t that bad, actually, and I don’t
“I heard that’s a big problem these days. Hey
Looking at the heartbroken expression on Steve’s face nearly made Tony cry himself. There might have been the beginning of tears building up, the stinging sensation there but not entirely acknowledged. His focus was on Steve and how the alpha leaned forward to try and kiss the tears away.
“I'll have to talk to Bruce first.”
“Come on and join us already. Got an exciting day ahead of us. You’re going to need all your energy, Tony, so you better eat up because when I’m done with you your thighs are going to be on fire,” Jan patted the seat a few more times.
“You're so good to me, so beautiful. The sounds you make, wonderful. You're perfect, Sweetheart, so perfect. ”
“I'm sorry -”
“And so the dragon and his pets have returned,” one of the hydra’s heads said. One of the two facing Tony.
… but I am not an unreasonable soul. You carry a lucky star on you, Darling.  I will take you back. I’ll have you by my side again. I’ll even let you keep your bastard. All you have to do is promise me one thing.”
painful injuries. Perhaps a broken finger for every misbehaviour on your part. You don’t want that now, Darling. You
Rhodey accepted his promise, considering it enough for now. A moment of silence passed over them. The rustling of the trees managed to soothe the tension Tony carried, letting it simmer down to a comfortable state. It was still present, but other matters took importance, such as his heat and only having Rhodey by his side as his apparently
“Steve…”
Tony frowned. A sight to see on an eight-year-old. “I want to be his friend.”
His cheeks gained color from the shame of pressuring them to act against their will, to gain an emotion forced upon them by his body’s alarmed response. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know I was -”
“As ready as you are, Sir,”
“And we’re set. Rabbits for breakfast,” Bruce said as he patted his hands in an attempt to get rid of the branches’ aftermath.
Natasha was first to speak. “Word around the area. Hydra
Eventually, with pure will and some encouragement by their packmates stomping up the stairs and shouting down the hall for them to hurry up, Tony was armored and ready for the journey ahead. Their bags full with trip necessities, Tony’s gauntlets safely tucked away and the buzzing of it’s magic reaching out to him to show it prepared, they made their way down the hall.
“No!” Tony cried as he pushed his way to try and reach the betas now holding pistols aimed at Jarvis. “No -
“Positive. Besides, Loki invited me to join him in scaring all of you. That’s going to be fun.”
Tony gave Bruce a pleading glance and only got a raised eyebrow and a shrug as a response. He didn’t know what to do and couldn't figure out why Steve Rogers, the
Next to them was the big fellow that Tony couldn’t identify, Thor, and the other tall fellow who Tony also couldn’t identify, Loki. There was something about them that Tony just couldn’t place. It was like Bruce all over again. Something smelled off, but what was it this time? What were the odds that there was another Hulk in their shifts? If that was the case then it’d be perfect for Bruce. He wouldn’t feel like an outcast and alone, but Tony highly doubted the possibility of it.
He knew he probably still didn’t have the right to just walk wherever he pleased, but curiosity was eating at him. He had no clear destination, not until he found himself gazing at two doors that had a green light shining through the edges. Clearly the doors connected the mansion to the tower and somehow he had managed to find it. He didn’t acknowledge what his subconscious was thinking but clearly his subconscious knew exactly where it wanted to go. He feared knocking at the door, not knowing if it was all right to disturb the serpent or if he was even welcomed in the tower, but after standing a good few seconds in front of it the choice was taken from him when the doors suddenly opened. He certainly jumped an inch in the air when it happened.
Jarvis nipped his ear affectionately. “We would not have it any other way.”
“Shut it up!”
And as if reading his mind somehow Steve repeated what he had said and left no room for doubt. “No one deserves me like that. I’m not some prince that everyone has dreams about mating. In fact, Thor is more a prince than me. I’m just someone who our pack mates seem to think is the best to lead them, even though Bucky and Natasha are just as equally good to lead us.” Steve kissed him on the lips. “I don’t want better, I don’t want worse, I don’t want anyone except you.”
” Bucky repeated with a frown and made Tony’s heart nearly stop.
The sounds of Hulk’s heavy breathing, his large claws scratching the ground and Steve and Hank’s footsteps slowly lessening accompanied him all through the run down the road.
“How - how long were you waiting?” Tony managed. He felt brave. Braver than he had ever felt in their presence, and yet still his hands shook and his palms were sweating. He attempted his hardest to stop it. “How l-long until you made your move?”
“You're not interested in me,” Tony blurted without thinking.
Tony nodded to Steve in goodbye as he was led away. He looked back briefly at the wild centaur. Steve was about to say something when he caught his eye but was interrupted by Ty, now branding the winner garland around his neck, barging in. Ty blocked Steve from view and nearly made Tony jump at the sudden appearance. Something Tony didn’t want when May was still holding his harness.
Curiosity ate at him. Third time the name was mentioned with no one offering a description. “Peggy?”
He wanted to enjoy this moment for as long as he could before life decided he needed to return and face issues that still required to be handled. For one, what had happened to the pack in the time he and Steve were indisposed? Had they suffered injuries from the fight? What of the Hulk? Had the town gone into a frenzy after having the giant omega barrel down its doors? Did Hank and the others handle it? For another, how much time had passed since his heat had officially taken over? Hours? Days?
One final attempt and Tony gave up, turning around to look for the one person who was capable of nearly moving everything. James Rhodes stood with his arms crossed behind him, a smirk on his face from watching him struggle with the stone.
Tony imagined having Steve within sight on every minute of every hour of every day just for the sake of keeping watch over him and mindful of any dangers. It sounded like a hassle. He probably won’t have any privacy in the near future, but Steve was doing so out of worry, wanting him safe. Steve cared.
That was when it hit Tony.
“No, no they didn’t do anything that I wasn’t - they
“Do not talk of them, but enlighten me in your treatment.”
They were all gathered in the common floor of the tower. The walls decorated with lights and green and candy canes. A giant tree on the corner filled with presents. A table full of the many drinks they each provided and a line of snacks, chips, cookies and chocolates. There was no shortage of anything.
“Will you?” The alpha ran a finger down Tony’s neck and to his shoulder.
Clint took long strides forward to reach them. “What’s this about fresh meat trying to escape?”
“Well, there’s plenty of potential for them to see here.”
The crunching of grass and leaves with the sound of the occasional chirping bird were the only sounds that decorated the quiet forest. The light of the campfire slowly disappeared as they got further away and the shadows of the night began to fill the space of the sun’s light. Before they knew, and with no small amount of relief for Tony, the shacks appeared over the horizon and if Tony didn’t have Vision in his arms and Bruce by his side he would’ve made a run for it and curl up on the ground and sleep the night and perhaps the next day away.
“I get why you thought that, but this is pack. There is no doing it alone. Every pack and it's alpha leader works differently and place their own rules, but you've been with this particular bunch long enough to know they want to help. They are there for each other, and your mate? Don't even get me started on him,” Tony sniffed at the mention of Steve, feeling guiltier and guiltier. “He's good people. They all are. You're part of their pack, their family. There will be hiccups here and there from both you and them, there's no avoiding that, but you can't just run away and hide when things get tough, either.”
It was something at least. He just wished he had thought beforehand to grab the seasonings and spices to give the meat the extra taste to it. While he loved the bloody and raw flavor of a newly killed rabbit or deer like any other shifter, Tony favored the cooked option that gave crunchy results. He wouldn't object if the food came in a soup with vegetables or, hell, was just salted, too. Personally, he thought the food tasted better when eaten on two legs. Then again it could be his biased side talking. He preferred his human side more than his wolf side. Humans had opposable thumbs and him being a tinker, of course, he was going to prefer the side of him that had full mobility of his fingers and capable of grabbing things.
Steve smiled as well as he busied himself scrubbing at all the dirt that covered Tony’s skin and smelling content all throughout the task. Tony imagined his body was releasing his own content scent in response, easing his alpha’s piece of mind. It also helped that Steve’s hands were gentle as he brushed his fingertips over Tony’s figure.
The pack was kind enough to continue without commenting on them or what was said. “So no going through the west side,” Steve concluded, “and the south is out of the question for those without Loki’s spells. How many were spotted patrolling the area?”
Tony blinked. His thoughts were interrupted from going any further down the depressing road of his past. Instead, his mind became preoccupied with Steve’s glowing and smiling face. The alpha was covered in dirt with his hair tousled and armor unkempt. His shield had, unsurprisingly, dented during the first few contracts they had accepted. It had a good run, but ultimately a thief had gotten lucky and landed a hit with one of many large stones thrown out of desperation. Steve had blocked it in time, but no reinforced, magic-less shield could withstand the force from that stone.
“Just promise me I won’t have someone follow me to bathe.”
The two adults double-checked everything. When they were satisfied they eventually gave Tony the green light. “Go on, but be careful, okay?” They were opting to stay behind and let Peter go on his own for his first try. No doubt staying close still. They were showing a lot of trust in this decision.
Tony wished he had that courage.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Steve’s eyes softened. “Sweetheart, I’d never be against it. It’s no sacrifice on my part. If you want me here I’ll be here.”
,” at the beta. The threat fell on deaf ears as every one of the Avengers were nodding in agreement. All of them except for Natasha, who was busy giving her attention to Bruce.
Tony gave a slight turn in order to look at the coat and boots in a different angle from the mirror recently placed in his room. The short coat with the color of crimson was beautiful and well designed, the daffodil buttons and edges really strengthening the intensity. The onyx long boots, reaching up to his knees and shaping his legs made a beautiful contrast with the white pants it wrapped around. The pants themselves were tight and left nothing to the imagination when it came to his thighs, hips and rear. Thankfully, the coat was long enough to cover part of his rear, but it couldn’t do anything to hide where it connected with his thigh, and now that he was finally noticing Tony was amazed to say that he had gained weight. His thighs had not  been as big before, and neither had his ass. In fact he never recalled his face being filled out, either. His sharp cheekbones were still there, but they weren’t as noticeable now, and his arms were bigger. His stomach was even sticking out slightly, and as he squeezed into his pants he noticed a small pouch just below his navel.
It was a hydra.
The familiar stinging of his eyes, the benning sign of tears, and his chest feeling tight. Self-pity was truly becoming his friend.
The alpha worrying over him had him feeling odd, a
Enjoy!
So this was Tony Stark when he traveled. He was the one who, wolf or human, walked on roads or rode a carriage with a giant umbrella cockatoo on his shoulder and carried a bag that had a lump inside with the head of a machine poking out. Even now as he left the pack and was temporarily living in the shacks Jarvis and Vision remained by his side. Jarvis had a reason now more than ever to leave his side. Now that Tony was packless and unable to provide the cockatoo with a home. The same went with Vision, especially since Tony couldn’t afford to buy the necessary items to repair should the little machine suffer a severe injury. Only the great deities of the sky knew how long it would take for a pack to take Tony in. They were going to live on the road for quite some time.
The staff moved. He hadn’t realized his eyes were locked on the weapon until Loki held it up in an angle that caused Tony’s gaze to meet his. The serpent raised an eyebrow questionably and with a smirk. “Have you spotted something to enjoy, Dear Anthony?”
“I sure as hell can’t go back and stop my alpha from taking so much from me if it meant giving my father’s pack a home. I can’t go back to stop any of them from tearing me down to nothing and leaving me…” Tony had to laugh bitterly. Remembering the very words Stane had used for him. In the privacy of locked rooms. “A damn, broken omega.”
He let out a long, withdrawn sigh. His snout was tucked over his front paws and his ears were low in the ground. Without his notice, his tail had curled between his legs. A visual show of just how remorseful he felt. The tingling of his abdomen caused by his heat a sensation long pushed in the back of his mind. It hardly held importance in the current scheme of things. He apparently hadn't known his body as well as he thought he had. Nothing more and nothing less.
“Incredible,” Bruce spoke his thoughts.
“How do you keep doing this to yourself?” Bruce said as he examined his wrist again.
Tony preened. The praise made him feel accomplished and the idea of finally getting food in his stomach nudging him forward to their goal. Walking down a strange town with unknown faces out and about and having recently just gone through a heat, Steve kept close to him. He wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders protectively, ready to defend if any dangers presented itself.
, stated it?” Jarvis repeated. “He is not
Bucky lifted both hands up, accepting defeat. “I get it, I went too far. I wanted to tease you so bad I didn’t even think about what I was saying.”
Jan shushed him, reaching out but stopping just an inch away from his arm. “Don’t apologize. You did nothing wrong.”
“You will see soon enough. We will reach the pit in a matter of minutes. If you wish to make an impression I suggest preparing now.”
what he was doing, too.
Tony swallowed heavily. “I want to…”
Rhodey appeared at odds about that, shooting Tony a questioning glance.
He jumped when Loki appeared within sight. Having crossed a couple of feet within seconds and no sounds to show it. He was just as shocked as everyone else. “Am I losing hearing in my ears or has Anthony just stated what I believe he has stated?”
“You never willingly went to enemy territory, though, did you?”
“If I may, Sir.”
When it was all done he couldn’t help but say to himself a 'what s job well done.' There was little for him to be proud of, but this, smithing,
Tony’s fur was the only reason why his embarrassed flush was hidden from the world. “
Hammer and Stane knew him as Tony the omega. For now, he would behave as such. Not a hard task when more often than not his behavior as a helpless omega was true, but Tony had to remain in control. If he surrendered himself too much Hammer and Stane would dig their way down and rip any and all progress Tony had gained under the Avengers’ care. Dig and plant their web of lies and manipulation and make it nearly impossible for Tony to claw his way back out a second time.
“What do you want to eat?” Steve asked against his skin.
It was odd. Steve and Peggy had been nothing but friendly and courteous to each other. Steve welcoming her back like the old friend she was and Peggy naturally inserting herself into the dynamic of the pack. It had all been smiles and unity. No troubles. No mishaps. No arguments. Nothing so outlandishly different that would cause splits within packmates.
“I’m not!” His grip was turning white under the rising pressure he exhorted. Emotions boiling to a breaking point. “I’m not painting it as anything. I know it’s not acceptable. It’s not something a leader does and it’s not right. I know that now!” Now, he knew that now, because of the Avengers. He knew because of Steve and Jan and Sam. He knew because of Rhodey after the alpha spent
Another pack pile and this time with Tony shifted, strengthening his role amongst them. Everything he had supposedly dreamed of was true. It had sincerely happened, and it had come all together into a bonding pile.
