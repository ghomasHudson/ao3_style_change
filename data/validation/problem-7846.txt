You ever write something, re-read it a few days later, and then realize it makes no sense?  That's what happened here :(
"Always?  Do you get into fights a lot, Steve?"
“I can’t believe you managed to piss off the new kid on the first day.  What did you say to him?”
"Have you tried asking your mom?" Bucky replied.
"His death.  My ma always said that spirits with painful deaths sometimes get caught in a loop.  They relive their death.  And now, Kevin is-"
“Steve, did you see what happened?” He asked
"These look like they've been bandaged up nice and tight." The doctor said.  Steve nodded.
"No. Do you hear dead people?"
"He just shows up around Halloween."
“No, it’s not like that at all.  I just thought… it looked so real.  Kevin died in a lot of pain and for a moment it was like it was happening for the first time.  It was so...sad.  I just thought I could help.”
“You know,” Tony said softly and Steve jumped.  They were the only two students left in the room, and Coulson had already begun separating their homework into piles.  “At least the other kids have the decency to not pretend they aren’t staring at the new kid.  I get it; we’re always freaks.  But there’s something about you watching me out of the corner of your eye that’s really pissing me off.” Tony snatched his books off his desk and stomped out of the door, pushing past Bucky, who had been loitering around for Steve.
“That’s not true,” Steve argued, though his voice held no heat. He looked at Tony earnestly. “When you got picked up by that spaceship, I said Earth had just lost her best defender, and I meant it, Tony.” Tony blinked, shocked into speechlessness. That – that was news to him. The original Steve had never told him that; he wondered if that Steve had said the same thing, or if this was unique to this world’s Steve. But Steve wasn’t done, either, continuing in the same sincere, impassioned tone, “You’ve always been the best of us. You fought for everyone even when they hated you, you fought with
Tony grinned wryly. “Welcome to the world of the rest of us flawed individuals, Cap. If it helps, I’m pretty sure you’re the best of us.”
The flight to Thanos was both blessedly and terribly short. Tony called Happy on the way, asking if he could get to the Compound as quickly as possible to watch after Morgan. FRIDAY was keeping an eye on her in the meantime, but he wanted someone with physical hands to look after his little girl. Saying goodbye to her had been awful. She’d been so quiet, watching him with her too-intelligent eyes, drinking him in like she thought this was the last time she’d ever see him as he’d pressed a kiss to her forehead, told her to be good for FRIDAY, and that he’d do his best to be back in time for supper.
“Nebula said Thanos doesn’t do anything without reason, so there has to be a reason he needs Tony! If we could figure out what it is, maybe it’s key to bringing him down!” Steve argued.
“Hey, no, these are the sticky arrows, not the pointy ones! Your property will be fine,” Clint reassured him. Tony was not very reassured.
Ugh. So. He was going to have to do Emotions, which he
The whole backyard when still and silent, the snow dripping slowly off Natasha’s blank expression, and Clint looked terrified.
And actually the more he thought about it, the more he was glad it
Bolstered by the thought, Tony pushed himself out of bed and pulled on some casual clothes of his that were still in the dresser drawers – and a little touched that the team had never cleared them out, had left his room exactly as he’d had it before he’d left the Avengers. Eyes bright, he opened the door and wove through the hallways, heading for the kitchen, fairly certain that was where he’d find his daughter – only to be disappointed.
to be sympathetic and sweet and funny and amazingly sarcastic all at the same goddamn time. They’d been spending a lot of time together over the past two years, helping with reconstruction efforts and just generally living in the same building, and the tentative friendship that they’d crafted before it had fallen to shit had reformed and then become full-fledged, with Steve spending enough time doodling in his lab that Tony had made him a special “art” spot – purely for safety reasons, of course.
Sure, Steve still hasn't solved the Kevin problem or figured out what's going on with Tony, but he does eat cake, so his Saturday wasn't a total bust.
Tony swallowed.
Also, my high school had one of those old-fashioned elevators, just like the one I described here.  I rode in it a few times and it was terrifying.  I'd rather just limp up several flights of stairs than ever ride that thing again.  It was the slowest, lurchy-est elevator and part of the reason I always take the stairs when I can.  The way that grate door clanged shut when you yank on it was not for me.  It didn't help that my high school was supposedly haunted with the ghosts of the students and faculty that had died there, back when it used to be a boarding school.
Waldorf-Astoria: An opulent Art Deco hotel in Midtown Manhattan, it was known for being prestigious; a reputation that lives on to this day.  It has since been partially converted to luxury condos.  It opened during the early years of the Great Depression & Langston Hughes made a parody advertisement for it, writing, “ “All the luxuries of private home. . . ." / Now, won't that be charming when the last flop-house / has turned you down this winter?”
"St-stop...please!" Kevin gasped for air. "I-"
"This isn't right!" Kevin shouted from the other end of the hall.  Steve felt the room grow chilly, and he knew the other students could feel it too; he saw a boy shrug on his jacket.  He stumbled his way to the plaque.  "I'm not dead!  I'm right here!  You can see me, right?" He tried to grab the arm of a girl passing by, but his hand only passed through. "What?" Kevin muttered.
“So nice of you boys to join the rest of us.  Being late won’t get you out of turning in your reading assignment, I’m afraid.”  Coulson pointed to a pile of papers on his desk.
"My advice is this; you can't go in swinging without a plan.  Of course, you shouldn't be hitting
“Steve; fuck you.”  Tony spun back around and hastily hurried down the stairs.
Steve rolled his eyes.

have been what got Steve mad in the first place.  If Steve's mother hadn't shown up at that exact moment looking so tired, Steve might have jumped on Mark again.)
“Bucky, will you stop it?  I wasn’t staring at him because he’s cute-”
, Bucky."  Steve glanced down at his watch.  "Shit, it's 2:04."  That's when Kevin died.  There was a ghost who liked to haunt the records room and Steve had promised her he’d fish out her ring from under a vending machine and mail it to her granddaughter in exchange for Kevin’s death records.
Bucky whistled. “Congrats, Stevie!  You’ve managed to piss off your first crush.  It happens to the best of us!”
He fell to the ground, where he lay crouched for a few moments, before sinking down onto the ground.
"Jesus H. Christ, I wonder what her problem is." Bucky huffed.  Steve glanced at him. "Okay, yes; I technically know what her problem is,
"NO!!" He shouted and let his backpack fall to the ground.
Bucky immediately cut Steve off.
Fun fact! Kevin Sydney is a Marvel character who died young! He was introduced as an X-Man, dying at the end of his arc.  His codename was Changeling, hence his epithet.  He's later briefly raised from the dead.  He also makes a well-loved appearance as Morph in the animated 1990s X-Men cartoon.
"Something like that.  About all these scrapes; I know I'm just an old man, but can I give you some advice?"
“How do you fight an angry ghost?”
"Sarah Rogers," Steve puffed out his chest a bit. "And she's the best nurse in the whole hospital!  She always bandages up my scrapes and stuff real nicely."
It was only a week until Halloween, and they’d been reading some gothic literature to get in the holiday spirit.  Clearly, it worked, since a chair being knocked over got most of the class worked up.
“I got you into the best damn school in the country, boy, but you couldn’t keep yourself behaved for ten minutes, could you?!” A sopping wet man in a business suit was yelling at another student, who happened to be sitting right next to Steve’s empty desk.  “I don’t even want to know whatever it was you did to get yourself sent here.  But now you don’t even pay attention in class?  This is unacceptable!”
“I've never seen this before..."
"Spooky." Bucky finished with a grin.
Steve never saw any ghosts around his apartment, nor did he see any around his daycare, new as it was.  So when he saw the strange man, he had no reason to suspect he was not like Steve.  The man had been dressed like a doctor in a movie Steve had seen, and, in Steve's professional opinion, looked like a much more serious doctor than Mark McCarthy's dad.  He had salt and pepper hair and a stethoscope dangling around his neck.  He was also shorter than Marc McCarthy’s dad, and that made Steve like him instantly.  Shorter adults were usually nicer to Steve.
Windsor Terrace: A Brooklyn neighborhood that is nestled between Green-Wood Cemetery and Prospect Park.
"...Tony, have you been having a lot of near death experiences, lately?" Steve asked.
"You know what I mean! " Bucky muttered back. "Tasha swears this school is haunted, and I bet her 20 bucks it wasn't.  I mean, I’m
“He’s not my first- I mean, I don’t have a crush on him!  God, what are we, five?”
Green-Wood Cemetery: One of Brooklyn’s historical cemeteries, it boasts plenty of wildlife and several celebrity graves.
"You're okay now.  You're alright.  You're safe," Steve murmured in his ear.
"Kevin, I'm right here!"
Bucky bumped Steve’s shoulder.
"You have decked me for my mouth before." Bucky laughed as Steve bumped his shoulder against Bucky's.
"What?  You can't go running for help every time you almost get hurt."
"Oh?  Who's your mother?"
"Don't say it's--"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not yet.  I just don't think I should get involved."  This time it was Bucky's turn to give him a withering look. "He's really angry, Bucky.  Each year he gets worse, and he's been doing it for over 20 years now."
"Dr. Stuart!"
“It’s Steve,” Steve called, weakly.
"Listen!  We just saved your ungrateful ass!  Steve here could have just let that ghost kill you, but since he's actually a good person, he saved your fucking life!"
"Let me rephrase that, then," Bucky said. "Have you been having a lot of very frightening
And true to Sarah’s prediction, Steve had never seen Dr. Stuart again.
(See the end of the chapter for
And my soul is sorely shaken
As always, thank you for reading! :)
Steve groaned.
"I certainly hope not." At the frown twisted on Steve's face, she quickly added, "He's been here so long.  It's about time he went into the--retirement.  It's about time that he retired."
“Fine, you don’t have a crush on him.  You’re 'romantically attracted' to-”
On the first floor landing, they could see Tony Stark at the end of the hall, standing in front of the elevator and fiddling with his phone.  He was all bundled up (looking "
what the ghost had in mind.
“Hell yeah, I’m in!  We’re like the Ghostbusters, dude!”
And there was nothing Steve could do to help him.
The man reached down to grab the boy’s arm.  Holy shit!  Ghosts usually couldn’t physically touch people, but the boy’s arm jerked as if the ghost really had managed to hold on to him.
“Oh, come on, man!  Why are you ignoring me, too?  I can’t take this anymore!” The kid slammed his books on his desk and stood up so fast his chair tipped over.  The other students jumped.  The blonde girl in front of Kevin accidentally flung her pen in surprise.  Steve felt bad for her; Carol was nice and one of the toughest girls he knew, but even she was frightened by Kevin’s outburst.
-ed shut.  Steve broke into a run.  The scarf was tightening around Tony's neck, and Steve could see his face getting redder and redder.  He was close enough to make out the face of the ghost now, too; he was staring down at Tony through the window on the outside door with an odd expression as the elevator kept climbing upwards.  Steve couldn't tell if it was filled with anger or confusion, and he couldn't waste any time trying to figure it out.  He began to yank on the scarf but he just wasn't stronger than an elevator and an angry ghost.
“Quiet, please!”  His teacher called.  Mr. Vell was a nice, unassuming man with a fondness for argyle sweaters and earl grey tea.
you hit him right in the-"
Prospect Park: Adjacent to Windsor Terrace, Prospect Park is an urban park that took inspiration from Central Park, as the architects also helped design Central Park.  It’s about 150 years old, and was actually built around a private Quaker (Society of Friends) cemetery that is still in use by Quakers today.  The cemetery is off-limits to park goers.
"So, that blast of cold air back in English... was that you?"
"Not to worry," Dr. Stuart waved her off. "He's a delightful young man.  Maybe you'll help people, like your mother?" He asked Steve.
"Ooooooh, spoooooky," Bucky whispered with a grin.
Steve and Bucky stared at him.
"Have you tried talking to a teacher about him?  I think Mr. Vell's been here that long, along with Dr. Pym.”
"Thank you!" Steve whispered back with a delighted grin.
“Yes, you’re probably right.  I’ll get the maintenance men on this after school,” he nodded again, assured.  “Does anyone else notice it gets a little drafty in here this time of the year?”
Steve knew to keep his head down, though.  He had tried in the beginning, he really had.  Steve still remembered the first time he'd seen a dead soul.  He had only been four years old at the time, and his knobby knees had been skinned after a tussle with a schoolyard bully.  (His name was Mark McCarthy, not that it mattered.  Anymore.)  The both of them had been suspended from the hospital daycare, so Steve's mother was minding him while she worked.  (Mark McCarthy's rich dad had been able to pay for a private babysitter, he'd smugly informed Steve while the two of them waited in the time-out chairs for their parents to come pick them up.  His taunting a friend of Steve's who lived down the hall from him and couldn’t afford new shoes this season
"Momma, where did he go?" Steve tugged on her sleeve.
Steve blushed. "Not unless they start it, sir." He dropped his head a little.  "Hey!  I didn't give you my name!  Did the other nurses tell you about me?"
“I didn’t
"Is it that one kid?"
"Let go!" He shouted in frustration.  Bucky began to tug on the scarf, too.  He loosened it just enough that Tony finally slipped out into Steve's arms.
"I just saw Kevin die." Steve brushed a tear away.  "Bucky, I think someone might have killed Kevin."
Lest an evil step be taken,-
Before Steve could hop off his chair, the Dr. Stuart leaned in and whispered, "They keep the cookies in the top drawer."
But of course Kevin did not see Steve; all he saw were more ghosts, long forgotten and just as dead to Steve as Kevin himself was.
"Seen what?!" Bucky asked.
The two of them turned to see Mrs. Rogers in the doorway.
The bell rang, but Tony didn’t move.  Steve slowly gathered his things and watched Tony out of the corner of his eye, who resolutely kept his eyes looking straight ahead.  The other students quickly filed out.  He quickly jerked his head at Bucky, who nodded back and followed his classmates out.
"I don’t think I have the time, honestly.  I only have until next Friday.  He’s always vanished before November second."
“Well, aren’t you going to hurry home, boy?  I’m sure Jarvis is waiting to coddle you.”  The ghost sneered.  “I’m not sure what-”
Brooklyn Bridge Park: A series of mini parks that were built on salvaged piers.  Pier 4 is technically a beach, but visitors aren’t allowed in the water.  Other piers include: sports fields, playgrounds, wildlife preserves, tidal pools, picnic lawns & art installations
"What happened to your leg, son?" The doctor asked.  There was something funny about his voice, but Steve had been so scared of being kicked out that all he could squeak out was, "Nothin', sir."  Steve had always been aware that his being there was conditional on how unnoticeable he was to the doctors.
Steve would have been more upset about the whole thing, but his mother hadn't been too angry at him and the other nurses kept slipping him cookies behind his mother's back.  The other nurses always cooed at Steve and were more than happy to let him color quietly in their break lounge.
May not be happy now."
Steve couldn’t focus on the lecture at all.  Good God, but the ghost next to him was distracting.  He wasn’t talking anymore, just glaring angrily at the boy, Tony.  There was no way Tony could see him, but Steve knows he saw Tony jerk his arm earlier.
“We aren’t sure. He’s gathering his forces right now, but his army hasn’t mobilized in any specific direction – they’re just sitting dead in the air, waiting. We think he’s trying to gather as many of his troops as possible, then he’ll transport them using the Space stone.”
Iron Man on the field. I’d say the only major strategic change is that we need to keep as much distance between Tony and Thanos as possible, but I’m guessing Tony already thought of that,” she said, turning a raised eyebrow on Tony, who shrugged.
So he’d left the Avengers, and he hadn’t spoken with them since. His memories told him the Accords had still happened, and he had still signed them in case he needed to fly individual missions as Iron Man (though he hadn’t, not till New York). But in this world, he hadn’t gotten involved in the process – he’d stayed home with his family, he’d let them work out the Accords on their own. He’d played with his daughter, helped Peter train, taught Harley about arc reactor technology, loved his beautiful wife.

Tony snapped his fingers, knowing the cost, knowing it was the last thing he’d ever do with his life, holding one single thought, one directive like a lifeline and
Tony’s brow furrowed as he tried to decide how to answer that. “I think losing a battle doesn’t mean you aren’t a hero, it just means you’re fallible. I think you only stop being a hero when you stop trying to help people,” he said finally. “And…I dunno, maybe this isn’t the right attitude, but I just don’t really care if people consider me a hero anymore. It just…it just doesn’t seem to matter, not after all we’ve lost. If I can do something to help, well…at the end of the day, who cares whether the ones I’m helping think I’m hot shit, ya know?”
“Oh, no no no!” Bruce called, holding his hands up. “Unless you want the Big Guy to come out and play, you better not hit me with any of those!”
hadn’t created a murder bot, his program had been corrupted by the stone’s influence – even in the face of irrefutable evidence that had been accepted by the courts when he was exonerated. They hadn’t believed him, they’d blamed him, and they hadn’t trusted him. And when he became even more insistent about the looming alien threat after the vision Maximoff had given him, they’d dismissed him, rolling their eyes about his ‘conspiracy theories’ and ‘you watch too many movies, Tony’ and ‘we have
“What about the other 12%?”
“He’s not kidding.” Peter and Tony’s heads snapped toward the living room door where Rhodey was entering with a smirk, sauntering over to them and plopping down in a chair across from them. “Once he gets his tentacles in you, you’ll never be able to get him off.”
The feeling of impermanence, of the transience of a life, never got easier to bear, as Tony had discovered during his years; he wished he could wipe that pain away for them, but he had to admit that the renewed feelings of loss he’d experienced when one of his loved ones was dead in any universe he’d visited were part of what reminded him that he was human.
Well, fuck. That meant he had to handle this delicately, and, if there was one thing no version of Tony Stark would ever be, it was delicate. Thinking through Harley’s words, he tried to parse out why this particular subject would be so meaningful to Nebula – then realized the only real father figure she’d ever had was
“I want to go to Kamar-Taj and learn magic,” she responded calmly, as though she wasn’t saying the most nonsensical thing in the world.
Tony had barely had a moment to explore this newfound knowledge when the door was swinging open, Morgan sweeping into the room with a tray. “Dad, I brought – ,” Coming to a sudden halt, she stopped and stared at him, wide-eyed. “ – breakfast,” she finished. She stared at him, and he stayed silent, giving her a chance to take him in. Carefully, wordlessly, she sat the tray down on a dresser, then came to sit on the bed.
“Tony – “ Steve started, and Tony shook his head, pinning him with a glare so furious it could melt vibranium. But when he spoke, his voice was low, soft and dangerous.
“Yessssss, FRIDAY, tell me you recorded that!” he crowed.
“Gotten
“What? I have
problems to deal with here.’
. Oh God, he’d be able to raise Morgan. He could see Pepper again to tell her how much he loved her. He could be there for Peter and Harley. He could re-adopt Nebula, since he hadn’t done as much as he’d wanted to in his original timeline – if he could tear her away from the Guardians, that was. If not, weekly space calls could be a thing. They would work it out.
“I didn’t know the new arrows Tony made for me were going to be
Carol, her face drawn and serious, nodded once. “Earlier today, I was assisting one of the planets that was hit especially hard by the snap, with a lot of their infrastructure getting damaged. This planet was a known haven for a couple of Thanos’s…children and, as such, there were rumors that some of his army took up residence there after the snap. While there, I overheard a conversation. Some of the locals were discussing what seemed to be a mass exodus of all of the beings they’d suspected of being supporters of Thanos. This sounded odd, so I reached out to my contacts on a few other plants, who all said the same thing. A few of them issued the same warning: Thanos is on the move.”
“Call me Neb again, dipshit,” Nebula hissed.
, his grey-streaked hair falling in soft, luxurious curls around his face, framing fury-filled eyes.
“Right, well. There’s three bedrooms, so we’re all going to have to double up,” Tony instructed, and Clint immediately grabbed Natasha, to no one’s surprise.
,” he shouted, and Tony’s eyes went wide as the kid stomped over to him, looking murderous.
. But the realization that what happened on Titan for him and what happened on Titan in this world might be two different things tempered his words. “Who told you we fought? No, we didn’t fight Thanos. Thanos wiped the floor with us, got the rest of the stones, and left us in the dust.”
. He gets to pull the ‘saving the entire universe’ card,
Harley sighed, the sound scratchy over the phone. “Mom and Emily are gone.” And Tony’s stomach dropped.
, coming after
Tony smiled, eyes shining with joy and delight. “It’s a long story, Steve – but we’ve got lots of time.”
. That I better stop pretending to be a
“Who is this?” Harley’s voice was guarded, and that more than anything told Tony that something wasn’t quite right. But he kept his tone light, regardless.
“Sorry about that, Mr. Coulson.  American Lit was, uh, really hard for Steve today.  He’s just very shocked about Edgar Allan Poe.  Tragic, really.” Bucky lied.
"If I was your mom, I would have decked you for your mouth," Steve replied.
The title for this chapter is from Poe's
“I didn’t know he died like that.  If I had, maybe I would’ve-”
"Will he be back next time?" Steve asked.
Steve felt a prickling chill fill the air and the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.  Someone had tracked water in here, all right, but it hadn’t been a student.
“Bucky, not now!” Steve opened the classroom door.  The door handle was wet.
Bucky raised his eyebrows and Steve blushed.
"Steve, what are you-!"  Bucky took off after him.
Steve didn't really stare.  It was just that he had seen Kevin do this for three years now.  Every year, during the week leading up to his death date, Kevin would reappear, live his 'life' for a few days, and then vanish again.  Last year, Kevin had blown up in the exact same way, but it also ended with him trying to jump in front of a moving car.  Steve had to admit it had been a quick way of testing a theory.  Steve assumed he'd been doing it since the '90s, when he'd originally died.
The teacher scoffed again and closed the door.
Steve fixated on the lecture, staring rigidly at the board in the front of the room.  That was the point of sitting in the back of the room; no one was supposed to notice you.  He knew he couldn’t be seen talking to Kevin Sydney.  His converse shoes were just as beat up and worn as Steve’s own shoes, but unlike Steve, he wore a dark striped sweater and an even darker pair of worn out jeans.  Steve’s mother never let his jeans get to that point; she’d usually drag him to the charity shop long before that, and coo as he tried on every pair of pants in the store.
The doctor laughed but Steve didn't think what he said had been particularly funny, so he just nodded politely.  Mrs. Rogers stared at them for just a moment longer before gesturing to Steve.
, but if you do, it better have a purpose, you hear me?  Smaller folks like you or me have to be smart with our punches, you see, and we've got to get it done in only one punch if the situation calls for it.  So, if you get into this position again, take a step back, and then
“That has to be a new record for you.”
So I started to rewrite it and then life throat-punched me and this took a backseat.
“Hey, can I meet up with you after school to work on the lab report?  I can’t figure out the part about the strawberry enzymes,” the kid sitting next to Steve whispered.  He was leaning in very close to Steve, so close that Steve could feel his desk neighbor’s cool breath on his face.
"Kevin, are you alright?" Steve ran towards him.  He tried to grab onto Kevin's arm, but his fingers slid right through.
"Ghost?"
"I should have known this one belonged to you." Dr. Stuart said with a warm smile. "He has your talents, no?"
"I appreciate your time, Dr. Stuart, but we really must be going now.  Steve, go grab your coat."
Steve clutched Tony tightly as the other boy trembled in his arms.
"Holy shit!" Bucky exclaimed.  "I'm going to get Ms. Hill."
"Yo, Stevie!  Wait up!" Bucky hurtled towards Steve.  A physics teacher stuck her head out of her door to send a harsh "Shhhh!" at Bucky, who rolled his eyes and muttered, "Sorry, Ms. Storm."
Steve just stared.  Bucky grabbed his forearm and dragged him to his desk.
"Steve, man, what happened?"
Steve couldn’t blame them; he’d be just as scared if he hadn’t seen it unfold.  Of course, Steve was still terrified that he could see it in the first place.
"Mind if I look?" The doctor smiled nicely.
"No!" Tony protested, wriggling out of Steve's arms.  "It's fine!  I'm fine!"
“You did the right thing, Steve, by trying to help.”
"Nope.  I haven't died yet so they clearly weren't near death." Tony said, smirking.  His hands trembled a little.
. Goddammit. “Fine, fine, no booze.
“Are you incapable of being serious for one damn moment? You’re really just going to sit here on your ass and let the rest of us do the work? You
do that again,” she’d commanded, and he’d smiled at her.
“Just a kid from Tennessee that I have a connection with and his family. If they’re all okay,” he added, his tone flippant but his heart racing at the thought that they might not be. Steve gave him a long look.
Because that’s what you did last time. But he couldn’t say that, so he shrugged. “Just seems like something you’d want to do. Right the wrongs and all that.”
And now Tony was blinking, off-balance, peering up at him. “Uh. I mean, I’ve heard the stories – you and Peggy Carter?”
“When is it ever?” he muttered, mostly to himself.
sounded. Tony turned to see his daughter holding up her camera phone, a shit-eating grin on her face.
” Tony gasped, shocked, and now Steve’s eyes were wide and panicked, but Tony was having a moment of panic of his own. “Oh my god, Cap, you have to know what a bad idea that is. I mean, you’re
“She’s going to be as bad as you one day,” Pepper said, her eyes sparkling warmly as she moved to sit on Tony’s work table. Tony smiled, taking one of her hands and tracing the fingers.

the major milestones – to see her graduate high school, then college, then grad school. To see her get married and have children of her own, and to get to be a grandfather for those children. To see her blossom, take over first as head of R&D
And then the spy twins sashayed away, leaving Tony staring after them until he shrugged. “Guess we better get going, then,” Tony said, turning to look at Steve with a smirk, only to see Steve gazing at him with an inscrutable expression. “What, do I have something on my face?” Tony asked, rubbing at it self-consciously.
“FRIDAY,” he started, eyes narrowed to slits.
“Yeah, but on you, it’s different.”
“I…am…Iron Man.”
But even with all that, Thanos appeared more vaguely amused than anything; it was clear he was just toying with them, likely bored while waiting on his cronies to bring Tony to him and seeking out a way to entertain himself. He could destroy the Avengers facing him with the stones in a heartbeat if he really wanted to, but he was fighting lazily, countering every attack with unerring precision.
“I’m pretty sure you adopted that new girl – what’s her name? Nebula?” Steve added, and Tony shook his head vehemently.
“I know, you did that already – twice now,” Tony said, unable to suppress his confusion. The stones only looked amused, and Tony got the feeling he was missing something.
This chapter was partially a request by NightHunterDeath (I promise to get to the rest of the request ASAP, this one-shot just ended up having a nice spot to end on, so the rest of your request will be in a diff one-shot in this collection!!)
,” he screeched, reaching for Peter’s hand with his free one. “C’mon, Pete, let’s go bleach our eyes.”
“Hey, Cap.”
“Tony, no, you can’t – “
“Oh, and you might wanna approach the subject with Thor delicately. Big guy’s going through a rough time right now.”
And still, the split had happened. Steve, Barnes, Sam, Scott, and Clint had still teamed up – though Wanda was notably missing from their ranks, having stayed with Vision on the other side, along with Rhodey, T’Challa, and Natasha. Spider-Man had been conspicuously absent, with this world’s Tony having kept Peter up-to-date on what was happening with the Accords and cautioning him that he didn’t

kid, Tony?” he finally asked exasperatedly, though a fond smile tugged at the corners of his lips.
He’d almost made it to the kitchen when he came across someone he wasn’t totally sure he was ready to see yet. “Tony,” Steve greeted him cordially enough, though his expression revealed his hesitance.

“Tony Stark,” one of them growled, one hand (claw?) reaching to press a button on its other wrist. Welp, that probably didn’t bode well for him. He took advantage of the momentary distraction to blast that one, then turned his repulsors on the last one, only to find that that one had already run off.
He eyed her contemplatively, then slowly nodded. “When I took the infinity stones in that battle, a lot more happened than what everyone saw. I lived over 14 million lives before the stones brought me back here to this one. And now they’ve granted me another,” he said simply.
Tony grinned at Steve, who smiled back at him. “You handled that really well,” Steve said softly, and Tony felt something warm flutter through him.

about it being bedtime.
“Seconded,” Peter agreed, voice high-pitched. The duo exited the room, slamming the door shut after them.
“Oh, are we sharing a bed?” Steve asked casually, with none of the horror and pearl-clutching that Tony had expected, striding across the room and tossing his duffel bag on one side of the bed. Tony took a second to pick his jaw up off the floor, affect a disaffected demeanor, and saunter over.
Tony scoffed. “Please, I refused Stan Lee’s offer to go out to lunch one time, and that guy’s more of a god than Thanos will ever be.”
- he and his family were
“I’m sorry!”
“You’re here because of your wish, Tony Stark,” Steve said, his voice soft, caressing his name. And when Tony met his gaze, he could feel
Tony gasped, clutching his chest in mock-offense. “From my own daughter? Such betrayal! I didn’t save the universe for this!”
“Why Tony, dear, I love what you’ve done with your hair!” his husband said brightly, coming out of his meditation-hover to stand in front of Tony, running a finger through the curls. Tony batted his hand away, pouting at him.
Tony nodded, swallowing. “Right. Okay,” he said, his voice raspy, the words hard to get out. “Go. Go suit up then.”
And his tone was so earnest that Tony had to blink and convince himself he hadn’t just hallucinated the conversation. “Really? I thought you’d be chasing after Thanos by now.”

“I will give u sum blood….. if u go on this date wit me.” Thanos says and I gasp.
“I see how it is” he said and got up to slit his wrists more in his room but I  started to cry “no tony please u mean so much 2 me‼‼”

“OMG THANOS‼‼” I screemed and I tried 2 run away but he grabbed me and pulld me closer.
“she is my soulmate too but I wont argue wit u rn bc saving scar is more important!” vampire yelled and tahnos laughed.
I ran after tony wit eclipse and demon bc they were super worried but they didn’t love tony bc they knew that all the boys lovd me and they weren’t gonna bothr. We ran all the way to tony but they didn’t go with me to him bc they knew it was my thing to handle.
Suddenly somebody came onto da ship. We all gasped we didn’t kno who it was. Dey appeared around da corner taking off dere spacesuit… it was Dracula‼‼ (KILLER DIS IS U)
“hya he does….” I replied but then I heard a gasp behind me. I turned around. A guy was in the doorway with lots of eyeliner and he looked super shocked ans aad. He was super hot and looked like Gerard way too an. He started to cry and run away.
Spiderman!
“OMG NO U $#@!ING PERVERT‼‼!” I screem
“omg thanks gurl.” I said back and we laughed and drank blood together. Suddenly demon and eclipse showed up (this is u guyz!) they were lookin so hot.

Da wall blew open and everything exploded and dere was fire and yelling. In da hole in da wall there was a man in a red suit but it wasn’t red it was black and said mcr on it and had cool guns and knives coming out of it. He had a helmet on so I couldn’t see who it was. A man in a black suit but it had da face out of it and a black and red shield wit a pentagram on it was beside him. Wit dem was…… Natasha, Darkness, Thor, Eclipse, Demon, Bucky, hawkeye……
I gasped.
“omg eclipse demon‼” I said “u 2 look so good.”

“scar that was so good I love you” I fell asleep
Hawkeye and antman video taping me out da window‼‼‼ I screamed and pulled the towel over myself and used da gun to shoot them. Dey fell out of da sky and people ran to where they fell and tony grabbed dem. Antman had gotten away wit da camera but tony dragged hawkeye to jail.
“what is it scar?” eclipse and demon leaned in they were so curious. I blushed a lot and screamed at them.
Thor was wering a blue ripped mcr tshirt with mesh underneath but like in a cool guy way and he was wearing ripped blak jeans wit a chain belt and  black leather boots. He was wearing white fondation and had a strip of green in his lon hair and he wasnt fat he was supr ripped and hot. He had lots of errings in of guitars and bats and  nives. Darkness was waring a black tshirt dat said “reel goffs 4eva” wit a long sleeve underneef and white and blak striped leggins and black converse but dey were all bloody and rippd and he had lots of black eyeliner on and lots of real goff band brcaletesx on his rist that was bleeding bc he was slitting them.

He was wearing a hoodie tho not a shirt and he had his hood on 2 hide his face it was supr white naturally and he was sooooo hot. He had black ripped socks on  that went up to his dick and dey were all ripped up and had spiked and on them and black combat boots.
“Of course I think of Nebula as one of my kids!” Tony said, voice perfectly affronted, as though any other idea would be ludicrous. “I adopted her on the Milano two years ago, and, as I told Petey back then, once I’ve claimed you as my own, I don’t let go. She’s
Tony jumped to his feet, eyes scanning the room until finally,
And then they’d sent him back, and he’d woken up in a hospital bed with his beautiful Pepper sleeping in a chair beside him, worry written into every gorgeous line of her face even in sleep. Morgan was dozing against her neck, but she opened her eyes when Tony’s heart monitor sped up.
. But the words continued to pour out of him. “She didn’t want to do the decorating though, she just wanted to enjoy the final result. Well, and show off to people when she hosted for parties. She always had the maids do the decorating. Jarvis let me help sometimes, though, when he could get away with it. My favorite part was when he’d lift me up and let me put the star on top of the Christmas tree. Felt like a Hallmark movie or something, like I could really feel the Christmas spirit.”
, at least on Tony’s part, though he didn’t think he was imagining Steve returning his heated glances or staring at him a little too long when he was dressed up (or down, apparently Steve wasn’t picky) or dropping particularly flirty lines. He hoped he wasn’t imagining it at least, though he’d been out of the game so long with…with Pepper that he couldn’t be entirely certain.
He yanked his eyes down to meet Steve’s who was gazing back at him nervously. Distantly, he heard Thor ask, “What is the meaning of this mistletoe?” and heard Bruce answer him. Clint started chanting “Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” while Natasha’s judgmental, expectant silence rang through the air. But Tony just focused on Steve.
“Guess that means it’s us, then,” Cap said with a small, shy smile that made Tony’s stomach flip. Well, shit.
“No – you can’t do this, Tony! You can’t – you can’t leave us! You’re my Mechanic, you’re – you can’t leave me!” Harley called, and
Tony gaped at him. “Wait, really?”

But she responded anyway. “None.” Tony, for his part, was baffled; they hadn’t interfered with the past, they hadn’t made
He expected the burning sensation this time, the stones’ power sliding like liquid fire through his veins – but it still hurt like hell. Gritting his teeth, he focused, mentally pushing forward the same thought, wish,

“Bruce, we’re going to need the Hulk for this.”
“On it, Aunt Nat!”
“But Stephen, this is soooo at least partially your fault! If you weren’t a cool badass sexy magician, this would never have happened!” Tony argued, and Stephen’s brow furrowed before one eye peeked open, mouth opening to retort – and then promptly splitting into a wide grin.
“Daddy’s awake,” Morgan had said, and Pepper’s head had whipped around so fast Tony was surprised she hadn’t gotten whiplash.
Tony looked at them. “Why
For the record, Tony would like to say that it was all Fury’s fault.
“Four!”
Rolling his eyes, Tony stood, offering a hand out and tugging Rhodes to his feet.
“Whatever. Not like it matters,” she growled out, then stomped off. Harley and Peter frowned after her.
The gauntlet slid off easily, so easily Tony stumbled back a few steps, nearly ending up on his ass. And then he was holding it, staring at it in awe, a strange sensation settling in his chest – a feeling of rightness, of being steady when he hadn’t even realized he was adrift.
And so every night when Tony closed his eyes to go to sleep, he had to remember the look of what could only be described as
“You are sad,” Steve said quizzically instead of answering his question, peering at him. “Why?”
Thanos continued, voice steadily more and more deranged, “I can’t take it off, either – it won’t come off. Just keeps whispering your name, pulling at me, tugging at me, until it feels like it’s tearing my mind apart. So I came. I’m here, and I’m going to kill you so that the damned thing will be silent
“I’ll have you know I’m a man of my word, Cap,” Tony said solemnly.
“I’ll have you know I am

“Aw, you say the sweetest things, snookums,” he goaded, and Maw lashed out, sending a few cars hurtling in his direction. Tony blasted them out of the way, then fired the big cannons, blasting Maw off his feet. Tony followed, not waiting for Maw to get up before he blasted him again. Maw threw out a hand, and Tony went flying, catching himself with his repulsors before he could crash into a building. The alien seemed to have anticipated that, though, because a car flew his way, knocking him out of the sky even as he caught himself.
And then he was getting an armful of spiderchild. “Thank you, Mr. Stark,” Peter said fervently, pulling back and giving Tony a watery smile.
you – as in past tense. That trumps what you need,” he spat, and Rhodey’s hand settled on his shoulder in a way meant to offer support rather than restraint. He knew his Rhodey bear had been just as infuriated, just as irked that Tony had been disregarded at the cost of half the universe in his old memories. It bolstered him to know he still had his Platypus’s support in this. “I seem to recall telling you this was going to happen – for

“Eh, Thor, Rocket, and Peter are late sleepers, I can
“Hey, bambina,” he said, his voice sounding strange and distant to his own ears. Detachedly, he noticed Rhodey shepherding Peter discreetly out of the kitchen, leaving the two of them alone.
“You’d think they didn’t know people fucked anymore,” he grumbled, rolling so that he was tucked into Steve’s side, cheek resting on his shoulder. Steve pressed a kiss to his forehead, smiling indulgently.
“I won’t,” he’d promised.

“Hey, Stark, what’s a guy gotta do to get some booze around here?” Clint called from what Tony would bet was the living room. He walked through the halls, rounding the corner to see Clint sprawled across one couch, Natasha perched on the arm, and Thor sprawled over another, while Bruce was curled up in the chair closest to the fire.
they landed on the most amazing thing he’d ever seen. She looked exactly as he remembered, dark hair rumpled around her shoulders, deep eyes blinking at him in innocent intelligent curiosity, sleepiness tugging at her shoulders.
The stones exchanged a look. “Would you like to alter your wish? You can do that. We will not stop you,” Nebula said.
“Wow sugar bear, I’m only home for ten minutes and you’re already cheating on me with the new girl? I can’t believe you!” Tony lamented dramatically, and Rhodey’s expression shifted from confused to surprised to embarrassed.
Morgan had just returned from her second year at Kamar-Taj, draped in those ridiculous, weird, fashion-disaster robe things, and Tony would never
Tony had gotten the scolding of a lifetime from him after waking up in a hospital, exhausted but alive, to the shock of his friends and family.
, he thought desperately.
“Tony Stark. At last,” Thanos intoned, the smile on his face made entirely creepy by the emptiness in his eyes. Steve and Rhodey drew closer, flanking him on either side, none of them taking so much as a step forward, allowing a rubble-strewn expanse to stretch between them and Thanos.
Silence greeted his pronouncement, grim and stricken. Even Carol, who had stood strong and confident the last time he’d made a similar speech, looked a little rattled. Nebula and Rocket were wearing matching hard, black expressions of agreement, Nebula from having grown up with Thanos as her father and Rocket from having heard Nebula’s and Gamora’s stories of the destruction Thanos wrought. Thor only looked grief-stricken and empty, while Steve and Natasha were varying degrees of horrified and shell-shocked. He couldn’t see Peter’s or Rhodey’s faces, but he’d bet they were somewhere in that spectrum as well.
Tony had dealt with the disaster waiting to happen that awaited him back in the master bedroom the same way he dealt with every problem that he didn’t have a solution for: by ignoring it and hoping the problem would solve itself in the meantime.
“Stephen, you have to fix me!” he whined, and Stephen nodded seriously.

They were attacking as one, coordinating in the way that only a group of people who’d lived together and worked together as long as they had really could, even if the past two years hadn’t seen many battles. Nebula was the main wild card, but she knew her father inside and out and compensated for her lack of experience with the others fighting alongside her with an intimate knowledge of how Thanos was going to attack and how best to counter him.
into trouble
“Do you have your own forms?” he asked curiously, and Pepper’s lips quirked into a smile, so like the real Pepper that Tony felt a pang of longing.
Steve cocked an eyebrow. “Peter.”
“Thank you.” Morgan’s relieved voice snapped him out of his glee, and Tony glanced over in time to catch the look of pure
But there was no talking them out of it. He didn’t technically have the right to keep Peter out, and Harley was too stubborn to be left behind.

“Thor, if you can assemble any Asgardians who would be willing to fight, that would be helpful,” Natasha commanded.

When Steve finally pulled back, they were both breathing hard for different reasons. Steve looked at him expectantly – expecting what, Tony couldn’t say, dazed as he was. “You said fuck,” Tony said dumbly, and a small smile quirked at Steve’s lips.

And then he was gaping at her, and she snickered at his expression. “Oh, come on, Dad, like I didn’t see the way he’s looked at you, and the way you’ve been looking at him since you moved on from Mom,” she said, eyes dancing. “You’ve been

adopted Peter, he’s my protégé, there’s a difference,” Tony insisted loftily. Steve rolled his eyes, unable to hold back his smile.
! Ugh, your super soldier healing bullshit
“You two are dumb,” Morgan declared, folding her arms and rolling her eyes and looking every inch like Tony’s daughter. “She was really, really happy, she just shows it differently than you two idiots.”
Tony was going to tell Fury that, too, when he was inevitably called to the pirate’s office for traumatizing Captain America by springing an awkward boner.
But when the next two days on the ship passed exactly as he remembered, complete with Captain Marvel appearing in her brilliant stream of blue-and-red-and-gold light to steer them home, that hope became more and more distant.
And over the past couple of months or so, that friendship had become something…a little
Thor got most excited for the tree, loudly booming that it was a tree worthy of the halls of Asgard’s palace as he and Bruce set it up, decorating with the gold, red, and green ornaments. Natasha ended up in charge of the wreaths, and Tony was very decidedly not going to ask how she got them into some of the locations. Clint continued to wrap the string lights around every wrappable surface he could find, which left Tony and Steve in charge of winding the garland around the banister of the staircase and decorating it.
“That’s slander, Mrs. Stark,” he said, pointing an accusatory finger at her. She stood, moving closer and wrapping her arms around his waist.

“We can be ready in three days. We’ll send you the coordinates for where to meet.”
would make you happier.”
“I’m sorry, Harl,” he said finally, one hand coming to rest in the kid’s hair. Harley finally pulled back, and Tony could see the kid’s eyes were red-rimmed. His guilt level hitched higher – just in time for another voice to pipe in.
“I’m good, Point Break,” he said, wiggling his fingers at him. “See? Everything’s working just fine.”

on his daughter’s face and felt his heart twinge at the sight.
With the kind of stubborn denial that had made him such a handful for Pepper to deal with all those years, Tony pushed those thoughts to the back of his mind, deciding they could wait until after breakfast – until after what was inarguably the most important part of his day, since, if this Morgan was

by how readily she’d agreed, and how she’d stuck to calling at least once every three days unless something urgent came up. It always made him a little nervous when she missed one of her calls, and he knew she was aware of that and called as quickly as she could when she finished whatever was holding her up – he knew because she’d video-called him while wiping blood off her hands more than once. It would make him feel like a silly, sentimental old man, but she seemed to appreciate the calls as much as he did and worried when he didn’t pick up, which happened only when he was in a meeting he couldn’t leave or in the middle of a battle. He always called her as quickly as possible after, too.
Tony’s heart panged. “I’m glad you’re alive, too, kid. How are you?” He left the question purposely broad, leaving it up to Harley as to what he wanted to reveal.
“No, that’s right, you
“I do,” Thanos responded, eyes glittering as he stepped closer. Steve and Rhodey tensed, and Steve tapped him on the arm as though urging him to back up. Tony didn’t move, eyes locked on the armored purple monster and having the strangest thought that the most dangerous being in the universe looked strangely…
Steve shook his head and smiled fondly. “Sure, Tony.” He stood up, then offered Tony a hand, which Tony took, and they clambered back to the rest of the group. The fight had devolved to Natasha, Clint. and Thor all giggling and throwing snowballs at each other with impunity. Tony wasn’t sure when Clint and Natasha’s alliance had died or how, but they weren’t holding back on each other now, the two spies doing all sorts of bendy things to dodge snowballs and Thor aiming with what was probably excess force.
, never letting anything stop you from protecting everyone, even the people you’re trying to protect.”
“Well well well, someone’s looking particularly alert this morning considering they haven’t even had their coffee yet. Are we sure that’s Tony Stark and not some clone?” Rhodey teased from where he was seated at the breakfast table, coffee in hand and plate of eggs and bacon in front of him, and though Tony knew he was joking, he felt a jolt of fear run through him – they didn’t
moves that might be construed as trying to fix what Thanos had done – so what was he up to? Maybe another planet had started doing what they’d originally attempted, and Thanos was after them?
“Oh my god,” Tony whispered, mind blank with shock. “I – that really wasn’t what I’d meant.”
was real and here. But if she hadn’t been sleeping…Tony could only assume that was his fault. Rhodey was right, it was better to let her rest – neither of them were going anywhere. He nodded, relenting, and Rhodey gave him a small smile.
. I can’t – I can’t
he’d just been gulping down bottles of water not minutes before.
“Rhodes is down, Nat,” he heard Steve say quietly over the coms, and then Natasha’s voice cut off abruptly.
“She’s asleep, Tones,” Rhodey said softly, steadily, resting one hand on Tony’s shoulder. “She hasn’t been sleeping well lately. Why don’t you let her rest and see her first thing in the morning?”
God, why had he thought it would be a good idea to marry a wizard?
“They weren’t? Well that’s a damn shame, I like my boys as big as I can get ‘em. 10 inches is the minimum.”
didn’t get to be concerned for his health right now, especially not at the expense of his Morgan.
“Harley?”
It was going to be a long night.
Tony smiled softly, thinking back to the spunky, snarky kid he’d met in a garage all those years ago – literally a different lifetime, for him. “His name’s Harley, and he’s my other protégé. Smart kid, reminded me a lot of me when I was his age.”
Harley and Peter had been there to welcome her to the Avengers when it was time, the two of them having done a lot of the recruiting for the newest generation of superheroes. The seemingly eternally youthful Carol and Steve had ended up as co-leaders for the Avengers after the others had retired, though Carol started passing on a lot of the duties to Harley when Rhodey got older. To keep her husband entertained post-retirement so he didn’t go getting himself into trouble, she’d joked at their Christmas party, but Tony had seen the way her eyes followed Rhodey that night, had seen the look on her face. It was the same one he often saw on Steve’s when the realization that he was going to outlive the people he considered family hit him especially hard.
. “Steeeeeephen!” he called, dashing out of the bathroom to search for his errant husband. Stephen would protect him. He half-ran down the hall until he made it to the living room, where Stephen was doing his meditation stuff. Ugh. Tony didn’t know how anyone could sit still like that.
Steve nodded. “A couple of kids decided it would be fun to explore one of the abandoned buildings that got hit but hadn’t completely fallen.” Tony groaned, already guessing where the story was going, and Steve smiled grimly. “Yeah, it started coming down pretty fast once they stepped inside. The fire department was on site first, and they issued a call. I was nearby and happened to hear it, so that’s where I ended up all afternoon.”
“Steve,” Tony responded neutrally, making to keep walking when Steve’s hand shot out and wrapped around his arm.
abandon his children if it was within his power.
, like it was something he had experienced, or something he was experiencing right then, or something he was going to experience, except that didn’t make sense because April 26th, 2019 had already passed and his Morgan was right here. But the dream had had the same feel as the one with Natasha – a dream, certainly, but a dream that was also something more. It made him think back to Natasha’s words – what questions should he ask about this dream, then, that were the right questions? How should he be looking at it if he wanted to see it?
Unsurprisingly, Thor and Steve were two of the first two throw their hats in, followed quickly by Rhodey and Nebula.
“But…but…
“But for now, we must send you to your next universe,” Pepper said. “Prepare yourself, Tony Stark, and be safe. We will watch over you.”
Well, no. He planted one on Steve Rogers, the man he’d been progressively falling for since the day they’d met. The man who was way too cheery in the mornings, who was an excellent breakfast cook but burned literally everything else, who sat in his lab and drew in his sketchbook for hours without complaining about the volume of Tony’s music, who had taken like a duck to water to the future and all the opportunities it presented. Who was his childhood hero, but was
“Makes sense,” Tony muttered, disappointed.
Well, it looked like his hideout had been found. Of course, considering said hideout was his bedroom and he was currently sitting on his bed reading, he’d expected it would be.

“Please, you know I’ll be getting the shovel talk from Rhodes. And probably Peter and Harley, once they get over their squeamishness at seeing their dad so thoroughly
a cuddler. That’s slander, and I will not have that kind of lie being spread about me.” He pointed a warning finger at Steve accusatorily. Steve had pushed himself up so he was sitting, grinning with an amused fondness.
“Mom always liked to have our place decorated for Christmas,” Tony said, not sure where the words were coming from. Steve was looking at him intently now, blue eyes focused on his; Tony did
And in the end, there was only one answer he could give them knowing that. “No. No, I don’t want to change my wish.”
At the sound of that voice, that
“Tony?” she’d breathed, eyes wide like she was afraid if she closed them, she’d find out she was dreaming. “
out of me, Platypus,” he scolded, and Rhodey gave him a weary smirk.
“You’re welcome to start that ass kicking any time, now,” Valkyrie called, and Tony turned in time to see her get knocked off her feet by the Power stone. Thor and Nebula charged, coordinating an attack from behind, but Thanos swatted them away without so much as turning to look.
“I’m going,” Peter said firmly, and what
Tony huffed, and Steve’s eyes twinkled.
“I can have FRIDAY lock you out of your suit,” Tony threatened, and Harley scoffed at him.
“Good, I’m glad to hear it,” Steve responded warmly.
had happened to them.
but that it just wasn’t the right time.
He glanced around, wondering at the location – and wondering at the emptiness. There wasn’t a soul in sight, none of the Chitauri, none of his friends, not even any bodies left behind. It was empty, and it should’ve been eerie, but mostly it was just
“Yeah, it’s me, kiddo. I wanted to check on you, make sure you were behaving, hadn’t gotten yourself into trouble again, yadda yadda.”
And he hadn’t had a chance to ask, either; Pepper had woken up at the sound of her daughter’s voice, blinking the sleep out of her eyes.
so,” Tony said staunchly, crossing his arms, and as the two started to voice their protests, he held up a hand. “No no no no no – this is where you zip it. I’m the adult here, and you’ve both been saying you’re my sons. Well, that means I get to make the dad decision – you two are staying here, where you’re
He could feel Rhodey and Steve jolt in surprise beside him. Behind Thanos, the other three looked equally startled as they slowly recovered, pushing themselves back to their feet. Hiding his own shock, Tony quipped, “Well, I hope they were saying nice things. I get sensitive when people talk behind my back.”
He heard Steve’s footsteps getting close and turned to see the super soldier hot on his heels. Desperately, he threw his arsenal, hitting Steve in his impressive chest and abs. This, unsurprisingly, did not stop Steve.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice called to him, cutting through the certainty, and Tony turned his head. The rest of their rag-tag six-person team was standing, looking at him with various expressions of triumph, elation, uncertainty, and worry.
. “What?” he croaked, not letting himself get his hopes up until he had confirmation that they were saying what he thought they were saying.
“Daaaad, come on, you have to tell her,” Harley whined.
. And you’re just not gonna go? You’re just gonna let us risk failing our mission because, what, you’re just
Tony has two adopted sons, an adopted daughter, and a biological daughter, and he just wants all of them to be happy.
from her, which was as good as a ten-minute laugh from anyone else.
, because without another word of protest they were nodded silently.
Yeah, Tony hated Fury right now. Because sharing a bed with his childhood-crush-turned-reluctant-attraction-turned-full-blown-crush was one of his worse ideas, and it wasn’t even
“I’ve told you before, little Boss, everything you do in the suit gets recorded,” FRIDAY responded from Harley’s suit, her voice slightly exasperated. Harley grinned.
“We’re not drinking, we’re bonding!” Steve called back firmly as Tony flopped down beside Thor.
“Steve,” Tony rasped when their faces were just inches apart, and Steve’s lips quirked into the barest hint of a smile, leaning forward and closing the distance –
Steve frowned. “Well, yeah, but don’t you have a term for that now? Bisexual? I’m pretty sure someone briefed me on that in all the cultural updates I got.” Steve shrugged uncomfortably. “I didn’t know that’s what I was growing up and all, but I always had an eye for both the men and the dames.”
“You will pay for this, Clinton Barton,” Natasha said calmly, and Clint looked like he was about to wet himself.
It was a perfect Christmas.
. I doubt anything in the last 24 hours has suddenly given anyone any insight to his plan. All this development really tells us is we need to not only take out Thanos and his forces, but we also need to make damn well sure that he doesn’t get anywhere near Tony.”
“I do
“Like I haven’t built a million things of my own I can take to shoot down some aliens. The suit would just protect me while I do it,” he retorted, and Tony couldn’t hide his flinch.
“That assclown really couldn’t come up with a better insult than

got when he snapped his fingers.
On the bright side, he had a nice, cozy little cabin that just
“You don’t have to tell me,” Tony added quickly. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have pried.”
The footsteps that padded his way were much calmer than he’d have liked, and he heard her before he saw her. “You
“It would seem so, Boss,” FRIDAY agreed cheekily, and Tony let out what he assumed was the world’s longest sigh – which was a phrase he could never say in front of Peter or Harley, as he’d discovered to his eternal chagrin, as they would immediately pull up some YouTube video called ‘the world’s longest hell yeah.’ At this point, Tony was just resigned to being the unwilling audience for his children’s shenanigans.
“That’s terrifying,” Steve muttered darkly under his breath, but Tony still heard him and smiled winningly before swanning out of the room.
And that was how a Norse god, two spies who could kill him with one strand of tinsel, Captain America, and a man who spent some of his time as a giant green rage monster ended up decorating his cabin for Christmas.
, Tony thought but refrained from saying.
Tony squawked. “The disrespect in this household! And you’re not even here yet!”
“’Night, Cap.”
“Well, if we don’t say
drool!” Tony squawked, deliberately ignoring the incriminating damp area on Steve’s annoyingly muscular right pec.
I'm at that point of just really really wanting to fix endgame, so this chapter happened already
“Had lots of practice with the Howlies,” Steve said with a bashful shrug.
“No, but it’s looking like I might be in another couple of seconds,” he said, bewildered, as Harley got in his face, poking him in the chest, face red and livid.
Dr. Stuart appeared in 'X-Men: The Hidden Years' Volume 1.  He is a obstetrician, so it's not out of left-field that he has a fondness for children :)
best friend and it’s not like you’ve ever lied to me before."
Yes, cosh, sinh, and tanh are only second year calculus, so it would not be that interesting to a fully grown Tony Stark/engineer in general, but it is impressive for a high schooler, imo!
This chapter came out much longer then I thought it would, so I split it in two, which means this is going to be a longer fic than I had planned for.  This does mean that I'm going to have to rewrite the next two chapters, so I can't promise they'll come out in a timely manner :( sorry!!
"Would God I could awaken!
“Why’d you try to grab him?  D’you think you can touch ghosts now?” Bucky sounded excited, like he always did when Steve would talk about ghosts with him.
Out of the corner of his eye, but carefully so Kevin wouldn’t notice, Steve watched him stomp out of the room.  The remaining students began nervously chattering to each other.
Steve jerkily nodded his head.
Steve scurried to get his coat on.  He turned around to give Dr. Stuart one last wave before he and his mother left, but the man was already gone.
