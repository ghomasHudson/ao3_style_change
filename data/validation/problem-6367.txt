Steve couldn’t dislodge the punching bags due to their recent upgrade. They withheld so much more damage and strength no matter how hard Steve had punched at them. It was satisfying and not all at once. It was satisfying in the way that his muscles ached and burned as proof of his stamina and strength, and it was not in the way that Steve couldn’t quite stop. There was no release.
“Is this the reason why you didn’t want me to say it?” his voice is nothing above a whisper, but Tony hears him loud and clear.
Steve couldn’t help but chuckle to himself whenever Tony rolled his eyes at a move the pair of assassins would take, and just a few moves in, the assassins’ jaws dropped as Tony smirked. “Checkmate.”
It didn’t happen overnight, and he is reminded of how much time has passed when Pepper walks into his office with two slices of cake and a proud, warm smile. “Happy one-year sober!”
"The people of Alfheim. They refer to you as Earth's Defender," Thor smiled, but Tony's panic was escalating.
And so, Tony looked on the road ahead and said, “Hey, Steve? You’re gonna love Howard’s study room. He’s always kept a bunch of photographs of you guys together around. You can take a look when we arrive there.”
“Meh. Trial and error,” he replied coolly with a shrug, and Steve wondered if anything was phasing the driver in the moment.
“I used to come here with a bottle or two and get drunk out of my mind. Back when I was some angsty teenager. You’ve seen it...” Tony said as he sat by the soldier. “So ignore whatever weird shit you might come across.”
“Three hours?” He whispers innocently. “Is that how fast time passes by when you lament over your dreary days?” He says dramatically. “Let him in.”
She walked over to him and greeted the bots. She sat right next to him on the floor and started talking. “Are you angry at us?” She asked.
Steve excused himself to the bathroom, and practically ran out of the entire gym area and to the bathroom on his floor. He had never felt as ashamed as when he shoved his hands down his pants, his mind flooded with nothing but images of Tony’s body, Tony’s hair, Tony’s voice, Tony’s smile, Tony’s laugh, Tony’s lips
“Dude, yeah! If you want, anyway. He will keep himself locked in that lab of his, anyway. He really doesn’t like Christmas.”
They sigh, and at some point, Clint frustratingly yells a message, “Fine! Be like that! But you should know better. This is not some problem you can throw dollar signs at and watch as it magically gets fixed.”
While Steve sketched mindlessly away, Tony was tinkering about. However, a hologram of a tab was among the various other tabs, and it read:
“You’re looking at me like I'm fucking crazy. Is it that? You think I’m losing my mind?” Tony’s voice is escalating in volume, and it catches Steve off guard.
The short genius didn’t respond, instead pretending to be too busy stirring the concussion in the pot. He felt drained and tired, but he knew he won’t be getting any sleep for as long as he’s here.
“I never understand your behavior. But I understand one thing. This was orchestrated. You planned this. Why?”
It felt so peaceful to talk about the past for what it is: the past. He had struggled to come to terms with the fact that he will never live through that era ever again. He didn’t want to hear it when all what people would say was that he was made for the future, and he wanted to scream whenever people answered his questions by shoving bright screens to his face. Whenever he did speak of the past, it felt constricting to his lungs and heavy on his heart. There was a part of him that continued to deny the ticking clocks, the digitalized calendars, and the smart watches that felt like cuffs on his wrists.
“Bruce, I will literally buy you Gordon’s kitchen if you want. Besides, don’t act like you don’t take note of the creative insults we come up with,” Tony said.
He thanked the will power that prevented him from breaking his progress of months and months of sobriety upon hearing the news alone. Thankfully, he has mastered the arts of keeping it together on the surface for far too long, and right now, he was drenched in terror and panic, but his eyes didn’t spill a thing. He put his hand over the steering wheel, driving himself closer and closer to a hell he pathetically thought had been escaped.
No one ever speaks of the loss a suicidal person feels claw at their chest when they attempt, only to wake up the very next day. It's a dread that creeps into his mind like bugs crawling up his body to infest his rotten brain, and he can't quite shake them off as they pinch and bite. It's like building a tall pyramid just to watch it fall into ruble and debris, and the Pharaoh's curse of eternal agony echoes through the walls of his skull. He feels hallow, empty, and lonely. The Avengers and Rhodey surround him by his bed, and he wants to cry out in misery because they feel twice as far.
She kept looking into his eyes with a soft smile on her red-less lips. She chuckled, and Tony thought perhaps her mind has bent reality yet again, but then she spoke, “You, Anthony Edward Stark, are extraordinary. I always saw it in you. No one put that out. No one dared to scratch that. Because somewhere along the line, I put a piece of myself in you. And Jarvis did so too, before the cancer ate him away...” her eyes blinked back tears, but she carried on. “We raised you. Jarvis and I. Strong, big hearted, witty, and absolutely beautiful. We put the best parts of ourselves in you. We really did. Because we love you.” She held his hands in a tight grip, and Tony let his tears flow freely.
mind you that the alt ending won't be a happy one. im debating this because idk if ppl even like this story lol so please comment your thoughts!!!
“Tony? You’re hurting yourself. Tony, your hand is bleeding!” Clint tried to get a hold on his wrists to stop the manic man from tearing through his room’s wallpapers with the shard of glass held tightly in his grip. Tony ignored him as his wide and frantic eyes looked for more, more, more. The siren in his mind was loud, maddening, deafening. And yet, it was music to his ears. He pushed the archer away as he marched to his parents’ room. He tore the mattress, pillows, the wallpaper, broke the vases, the mirrors, the doors of the closets and dressers. Before he left, he looked at his bloody hands, and wiped them off against his father's clothes that were in the closet.
Steve notes the icy, biting tone of the genius, and decides to backtrack. “That’s not what I’m doing, but I can always leave if you want me to.”
It made them feel horrible and guilty to know that through all this time and through all the verbal abuse they threw the engineer's way and the inconsideration of his feelings, they were contributing to something much bigger. And they exchange a look that was enough to confirm that the genius is right; if they hadn’t known, they most probably wouldn’t have stopped. Their third eye would not have opened to see that this wasn’t normalcy, it was abuse.
“Who the hell was that absolute legend who had won against you?” Clint asked with wide, curious eyes.
Tony didn’t have the time to react to the use of his own quote against him, because Natasha has spoken right after.
Natasha nodded once and started speaking in a soft, hushed voice. The room got colder, which was JARVIS’ way of trying to help. “Hey, Tony. You’re in the tower. The Avengers tower. It’s November twenty-first. You’re safe and in New York.”
They had to keep it together for Tony, whose car was pulling into the driveway. Natasha hurriedly carried the box of tapes to the study room, and Clint turned the TV on to some random channel and feigned normalcy. Thor shoved his hands under his thighs and sighed heavily. Bruce tried to sit still, but his legs were shaking. Natasha’s face was as neutral as ever, but Steve saw the slight crease of a frown by her lip.
“I don’t wanna start something and then... just... leave you hanging, y’know?” Tony muttered anxiously.
“Everything’s alright, Tony. We heard you fall and thought it was an intruder. That’s all. Maybe you were sleep walking,” Natasha lied casually, which Steve nodded in agreement with.
With that being said and done, Steve was able to wrap his head around the scenario Peggy has established in her head. He had wanted to tell her that this wasn’t Howard, that this gem of a man could never be Howard, but she had started talking to him about their days during the war and memories he couldn’t quite recall being true, but he went with the flow and found himself smiling and laughing against himself whenever her mind came up with a funny story.
“Pretty sure I politely told the government to go fuck itself just a few weeks ago. Besides, Iron Man is not SI’s property, just mine.”
Tony couldn’t hear her as he was approached by a nurse who let him know that visiting hours have started and that he may enter the room now.
Tony turned to see Steve saluting an old man who seemed to recognize him. “Yeah, that’s the legend himself.” The genius couldn’t miss the way Steve had looked around the place as if it were where he was supposed to be, and he walked to him and put a gentle hand on his chest. “You okay, Steve? Was this a bad idea?”
Tony slowly but surely got better with confronting his past, aligning himself with his emotions and feelings, standing up for himself, and most importantly, giving himself validation. Sure, the weather gloomed and rained occasionally, and some nights were much stormier than others, but he knew better than to simply pray the rain and whistling wind away. He had figured out that his healing process had truly started with him the minute he simply knew better.
Tony bit back tears as Peggy’s words rained down on him. He had wished her words gave him strength, but all they did was drench him in shame and guilt for not being worthy of all the love and strength she passed on to him. Poor Jarvis was probably watching in on him with disappointment, and he found himself apologizing. “I’m so sorry. I’m not strong enough. I can’t do any of this. I wish I was better.”
“I also swore I wouldn’t join this super-secret boyband,” Tony said with a groan as his head throbbed. “Clearly, I’m regretting this so much already. Gosh, can I please have a painkiller?”
There was a precious tape of Tony conducting his own test runs building a very familiar robot to them. His big eyes shone bright as he leaned towards the camera to set it up in place before taking a step back.
“I know that, but your tinkering is falling under an unhealthy coping mechanism. It has developed into an addiction to make up for the drugs and alcohol. Don’t you want to try to find something better? Something that could make you feel good?”
“Fuck you. You don’t fucking care. You’re just doing this to rid yourself of guilt and to make yourself feel better. So fuck you.” He can’t stop. He knows he’ll regret this, but he can’t bring himself to care. “Fuck you for being his friend. Fuck you for being so perfect and noble and righteous. Fuck you for being everything I couldn’t be. Fuck you for knowing everything I never wanted you to know. Fuck you for not being found—”
He throws a heavy vase filled with sunflowers against the mirror and smiles at a reflection of himself against a broken shard amidst the yellow-black flowers. He walks out.
“You muted me last night, remember?” JARVIS said teasingly. “Besides, it sounds like a delightful surprise now.”
“I don’t know,” he answered, which was nothing short of the truth. “I guess a part of me wishes you guys never watched those. Another is… okay with it.” She didn’t speak, and he sighed and carried on. “It’s just… every one of you guys acts a certain way because of something. Steve doesn’t like the cold because it reminds him of the plane crash. You don’t like loud alarms because it reminds you of the Red Room. Bruce doesn’t like explosions because it reminds him of the incident. Clint doesn’t like long car rides because they remind him of the car crash that made him deaf. Thor doesn’t like being lied to because it reminds of his brother’s betrayals of him. I know these things because I asked. Because you guys were given the chance to talk. It feels like… it feels like that’s been… taken away from me. That’s the part of me that wishes you guys never watched the tapes.
“I’d say sugar daddy sounds more fitting.” The Avengers exchanged looks of amusement. Tony Stark surely does know how to handle the media. It’s his superpower.
“Is that so?” Pepper said, but Tony could hear her calling bullshit on that just fine. “That’s funny. Because the British AI Empire aren’t conducting meetings now. In fact, they haven’t conducted any meetings for months now.” He sighed loudly through the phone. “Where are you, Tony?”
“Afghanistan? Of course...” Steve whispered as he felt sick. Just how much torture has Tony endured in his lifetime already? “Afghanistan was pretty recent. It hasn’t even been a year yet.”
“Yeah, Rhodey told us it’s your favorite. And lucky for you, I had ordered a bunch of authentic spices the other day,” Bruce said. “Take a seat. It won’t take long.”
"Tony? You wanna share the blanket?" Steve suggested upon noticing the engineer shivering violently.
He was screaming the words out, and they tore right through Steve’s heart. The man who gave them all a home was struggling to find one. He has designed each one of their floors to cater to their needs and wants, to be a haven they can all heal and grow and bond in. He stayed hidden floors upon floors under them in a lab. They never truly bothered to reach out to him. They always thought he was too much of a selfish snob who wouldn’t want to waste his precious time with them.
He came across the videos of his parties. Loud, bashful, colorful, and bigger than life. Tony was heavily drunk and drinking more than what his liver could handle. He was dancing to music louder than what his ears could handle. He was touched by hands groping, yanking, and tugging on more than what his delicate skin and mental state could handle, and everyone
The pained grunt that escapes from the figure under him snaps him out of his thoughts, and his fisted hands unfold and shake as they drip with blood. Hands are on his biceps dragging him out of the room, and he doesn’t quite process any of it. His vision blurs the world and his ears muffle the voices around him, and he smiled.
Steve shuts his eyes and tries to take a deep breath, but the punches, although harmless to a super soldier like him, are distracting, nevertheless. However, the angry tears that fall from the engineer’s eyes and the shallow breaths worry the blonde, and he tries once more to contain him.
) and he was already dreading calling Fury back after he has left him thirty missed calls. To be lectured and questioned by a group of concerned superheroes? He’s not a fan.
“Gosh, Tony. Help me here,” a voice that grew in volume with every step it took towards the door said. Steve concluded that it must be Happy: Tony’s driver. Steve went to open the door, and found a drunk Tony leaning heavily on Happy. “Oh god,” Steve muttered as he reached to hold onto Tony. “Thank you, Happy. I’ll take care of him from here.”
“Oh, Anthony. Don’t you remember? Don’t you remember me?” the man fake cooed. “You’re gonna break my heart.”
The Avengers kept the brunet company and their conversations didn’t stop. In their heads, they were beating themselves up for not doing this much earlier. Tony was incredibly fun to talk to, and easily put a smile on their faces and made them laugh. Clint laughed until there were tears in his eyes. Natasha laughed until her stomach hurt. Bruce’s cheeks were tinted with a color that wasn’t green, but a red that came out of how much his cheeks had hurt from how much he was laughing. Steve and Thor laughed so loud, the nurses walked in with a glare and a warning.
“Welcome home, Sir. You were greatly missed,” JARVIS’ voice chimed in. His tone was as fond as ever, and the team had to remind themselves that the man from the tapes won’t walk in on them any minute now.
Tony made the mistake of looking up at the sky full of stars. He could hear the Avengers marvel at the sight, and his head lowered in shame and hatred for himself.
“Tony, I’m incredibly grateful for the effort and thought you put into ensuring our safety. Thank you,” Steve said.
“Shut up,” he found it in himself to mutter. There was anger and finality to the way it came out, and he mentally patted himself on the shoulder when he heard the silence. “Fuck you and fuck the government. Iron Man is mine. He’ll live with me, and he’ll die with me. The government has War Machine, and that’s enough. Fuck your respect and fuck your orders. And fuck me for coming in here in the first fucking place.”
Steve winces as he recalls the altercations from a day not as far behind them as the soldier might have thought. “Tony, I wasn’t aware of what I was truly saying back then and—”
“Simmer down, children,” Bruce would shout with a smile from the kitchen, while Rhodey would shout new prank ideas for Tony and Clint to try.
“Remember that mission Captain was on a month back at one of HYDRA’s facilities? He came back with his suit torn, which by the way, once we reach the tower, I'll hand you an upgraded version. A stealth suit. Shit’s tough as nails. Bulletproof, cut proof, burnproof, needle proof, yada yada. Nothing can get to it,” another spoonful of Lucky Charms. “Right, well. I placed a new piece of nanotech in Steve’s suit. A tracker. The tracker’s linked directly to JARVIS, and that’s exactly how these bastards got to my precious AI.”
“Welcome, Virtual Basketball Lord,” JARVIS said and went on to explain what was there to the place. Natasha smiled with glee as she walked around to see all the games and designs of the place. She chuckled upon seeing a hyper-realistic hologram of a card tower. There were even digitalized versions of Russian games she had once joked about to the team, and a surge of warmth and endearment rose to her chest to know that Tony was listening. “This is... oh my god, this is the best thing ever!” Natasha said as she touched the hologram of the card tower and watched it topple over. “Guys! Do you see this?! This is the best Christmas gift ever! Thank you, Tony!” She shouted to the ceiling, to which JARVIS chimed back “Sir says you are most welcome.”
“So? Innocent people die while the Avengers kick ass, and nobody calls you bastards ‘terrorists.’ Besides, that’s kinda rich coming from the Merchant of Death.”
All his thoughts were thrown off when Tony slowly but surely started laughing. The laughing escalated to hysterical laughing. He held on to Steve’s shirt much tighter than before. He laughed and laughed, then suddenly, a sob broke out. Loud and clear against Steve’s chest. He sobbed loudly; the drugs and alcohol keeping his shame at bay as his mind threw up all its emotions onto Steve’s warm chest. His knuckles turned white as he held on tighter and tighter.
Tony’s heavy tongue couldn’t quite cooperate, so he nodded. He couldn’t help but feel a surge of anger and shame wash over him because he genuinely thought he was getting better. Why is he still having those mental breakdowns? Why is he still so weak?
Tony resisted the urge to parrot the words in awe and coughed awkwardly to prevent his vocal cords from betraying him. “Why that song?” he asked instead.
Halfway through, Clint accidentally fell asleep on the couch by his side, Tony got a blanket to put over the archer and watched him snuggle to it and sigh in his sleep. He smiled to himself and wished his friend a peaceful sleep. And as he walked to his lab, he came to learn that he didn’t necessarily need someone to perfectly understand him, he simply needed someone who put in the effort to.
“My point of reference is after Afghanistan as well,” Thor said as his face reddened with anger. “It seems that Obadiah did not stop his brutal act of violation even after Tony came wounded and weak.”
Steve has been deployed to a two-months long solo mission, and if he’s being honest, he didn’t expect to miss the blonde as much as he did. He felt so out of place in his own tower now that Steve wasn’t around.
“Man of Iron, I don’t recommend you be left alone at such time. Allow us to share your pain,” Thor says.
All Tony could hear was static. All he could smell was expensive liquor. All he could feel were veiny hands and tugs on his hair. All he could taste is—
It takes him eight more months to ask Steve out on an official date, and he has never felt happier as when he threw his money at a fancy restaurant to reserve the entire place to themselves and watch Steve blush profusely at his flirtatious remarks as he chewed on steak. After that, Tony had taken him on a cruise around Brooklyn, and watched the blonde roll down his window to listen to a street artist play the saxophone. Steve had his arms propped against the windshield’s edge, his chin resting atop them as he felt the breeze of the night caress his face and the melody ease his soul. The blonde turned his head to face the brunet and caught sight of the drooping eyes, the dopey smile, and the rosy blush all over the man’s face.
Suddenly, Tony’s body was unmoving, and Steve gasped, but Thor hummed, which was enough of a signal for him to not reach out just yet. Thor’s face scrunched in concentration and pain. Tony finally opened his eyes, but they were a bright golden color, and Steve’s breath hitched at just how beautiful he looked. Thor kept mumbling words and phrases in a language none of them understood, and Tony’s body was slowly unfolding from its tense clutch and his head started healing right before them. Tony’s golden eyes skimmed around the room, and his lips croaked a hoarse “Woah,” to which Steve sadly smiled at. Whatever Thor was showing him was clearly putting the panicking man at ease, and Steve whispered his gratitude to Thor when he pulled away from Tony’s space. The bright gold in Tony’s eyes started to dissipate, and Tony blinked a few times before he focused on the first thing he came in sight with.
Tony wanted to cry right then and there. It always felt overwhelming to be noticed like that—for someone to take notice of little things such as his love for a specific song, not because he mentioned it, but because someone noticed. He could never quite get used to such thing, no matter how many times it has been displayed to him.
“I always saw that place on TV growing up. My dad used to watch those interviews of Howard’s in his house with his jaw on the floor,” Clint shared. “Can’t believe I'm gonna see it in real life! Might pay my old man a visit just to tell him all about it. Not to mention how I’m dying to see your room.”
“We’ve come up with an alternative form of lithium dioxide. It’s gonna momentarily reverse the blood poisoning. Force the palladium back into the arc reactor rather than just roam freely around. But it’s still temporary, and unfortunately, we really don’t understand how your arc reactor works, so a solution to this is gonna lie in your hands,” a nurse with a syringe in hand said. The other nurse held a metal chip and instructed that Tony takes the arc reactor out.
“You would’ve loved her. She was young and full of life. Even when she got sick, she was still on the move,” Steve let out a breathless chuckle as he remembered how his mother refused to stay in bed because
Tony shrugged, and Steve held his chin up to look at him. “Hey. You’ve come a long way. You’ve got all the time in the world.”
Tony watched the sun rise through Steve’s window, and looked down on the man in his hold. His eyes softened and his heart skipped a beat when Steve looked up to him with a shy smile, and he blushed profusely when Steve gasped upon the pace of the heartbeats he felt under his palm. It occurred to him in this very moment that he isn’t scared of the Captain and hasn’t been so for a while now. He smiled to himself and landed yet another kiss on Steve’s forehead, who grinned in response. The sun shone brightly, and its rays smothered them in warmth, promising a kind, new day.
Somehow, that put his mind at ease. It felt validating and freeing to know other people think the man was not as good as his sick brain had sometimes painted him out to be just to mess with its beholder. He did hear it from Rhodey over and over again but hearing it from more people was a kind confirmation. And he supposed this was the first opportunity to practice the art of seeking warmth out of the fire without burning, so, he raised his chin up and muttered, “Yeah, fuck Obadiah.” It weirdly felt liberating, and he relished in the proud looks he received from his team.
The brunet stood there awkwardly for a solid minute. He felt exhausted and on edge, but he swallowed down his panic at the mention of the God of Mischief. Because although Loki was of no reason and one could smell crazy on him, he was Thor’s brother. Tony still remembers how Thor had explained how unfairly their father has treated Loki, and Tony automatically found himself sympathizing for the jet-black haired god until Natasha had reminded them that he killed eighty people in two days.
Thor was crying. He out of everyone should’ve been the most understanding. He saw his father wrong Loki in many ways, and saw the absolute misery Loki grew up in. But Loki had a brother, Stark had no one. He should’ve known that his teammate would be suffering immensely even if he presented otherwise. Not to mention how he saw images and heard the cries of the little boy Stark has once been not through the screen of the TV, but through the man’s mind. He was still suffering, still dwelling in those memories, still hurt. And Thor was too busy wincing over wounds that weren’t his instead of tending to the man suffering them.
“The Man of Iron was what you Midgardians call ‘cute’,” Thor cooed as he smiled fondly at a photo of Tony smiling wide at the camera while holding a circuit board.
“Does anyone want breakfast? I’m hungry. I want pancakes,” Clint said to change the subject, which worked. Tony was too tired and too mentally exhausted to think of why his head was bleeding, but as he tagged along behind the Avengers to the kitchen, he looked back at the not-so-white-anymore wall and smiled.
He looks at her with glossy eyes and a sincere smile. He nods once, and she smiles. No red alarms in her dark eyes, only in his.
They ate the chocolate goodness and exchanged casual talk, but the elephant in the room insisted on declaring its presence, and Tony actually wanted to address it.
Tony, who was still wearing last night’s clothes and sat up against the bed of one of the guest rooms he decided to reside in during his time in the mansion, was not feeling up for this. He woke up just five minutes ago after twelve hours of sleep with a terrible headache and a sore chest (
Truth be told, his anger and resentment did exist, just not towards them—not towards anyone but himself. Natasha seemed to understand that and tilted her head for Tony to talk. But he didn’t.
“Pretty much,” Tony said casually. It worried Rhodey beyond belief. “I can’t live like this. I can’t, Rhodey. What am I even living for? All I've been doing my whole life is just taking whatever people give me, whether that be bad or worse. I do nothing but go on my days trying to prove people wrong, but even that I no longer have the energy for. I just let it happen. Because I'm tired. Because this is no way to fucking live. And no one wants to hear the rich kid’s sob story.”
She nods once with a grimace, and he figures she knows who he is all too well now. “Thank you for doing better.”
The team noticed his silence, and he quickly and smoothly joined into their conversations. They talked to him and about him with so much respect. They weren’t stood on one side of the table arguing and spitting venom in his face like they always did. They talked to him like he was human, and although Tony was smiling and laughing along with them, he wanted to scream.
“Of course. Because my universe has just got to revolve around that motherfucker,” the Agent says furiously. The Avengers and Rhodey sit in an uncomfortable silence, until they hear Tony’s loud voice from the hallways demand coffee. Rhodey does not miss the smile that snakes its way on the Captain’s lips.
A part of his brain couldn't help but protest heavily against this. He still felt small and vulnerable under the Captain's gaze, but he also found an overwhelming sense of comfort and safety around him. It baffled him. One minute he's the Captain America he could never amount to, and
“I’m here, Steve. Alive and all,” Tony whispered. “Hey, look at me.” Steve pulled his head away ever so slightly to look up at the engineer through his wet lashes, and he bit his lips as hard as he could to prevent his loud sobs from interrupting the brunet as he spoke.
The truth is that Tony insisted on not being helped when it comes to fixing the arc reactor because he wanted to shut that one voice in his mind up. He really did want to give life another chance. He wanted to see the good in it for once instead of pain. He knows he shouldn’t be alive unless it was for a reason; especially with everything he’s gone through. He seems to be cheating death way too many times for it to be simply be disregarded as a mere coincidence. He still can’t help but yearn for death, but he also yearns for a better life. He really wouldn’t be craving death all that much if his life was simply bearable.
He pushes ruble and debris away and tries to rebuild what he can. The locals of the town watch him from behind brick walls for an hour, before they start moving from their hideout to look around what the red-gold flying suit has fixed. The young girl he has spoken to still holds red alarms in her eyes, but the stone she was holding on to is no longer in her hand.
Later into the night, they talked and rambled on whatever came to their minds. Tony loved lazy nights like those. Steve looked so young and happy as he spoke and cuddled him, and Tony was pretty sure hearts could be seen in his eyes.
Thor sighed heavily, his hands reaching to pinch on the bridge of his nose. “Our friend’s memories are flooded with sorrow and pain. It seems that the man who did not deserve to father him was not the only one to—”
The Avengers waited for their consultant to lead the way. His shaky hands and aching heart opened the door to the mansion, and a string of impressed phrases erupted. The house was grand; neutral colors painted the walls to bring out its elegant design, antique furniture embroidered with gold and clad in silk, immaculate white ceramic floors, and golden staircases that looked like they would lead to heaven.
“I get it,” Natasha finally said after the long silence. “I get why it bothers you that we’ve watched those tapes. If I’m being honest, I wouldn’t want anyone watching what I did during my time in the Red Room. But it’s been done. We watched them. How do you feel about it now?”
A few minutes later, a ring was set up around the lab, and Tony handed each one of them protective glasses. “It’s gonna get real messy and real bright so just stay aside and watch in silence.”
“Okay, well, try to finish up quickly, okay? We’ll wait on you,” Clint smiled, and Tony bit his tongue and plastered a perfidious smile.
“My babies. My children. My loves. I missed you all so so much,” Tony said when he pulled into the tower’s garage and saw his collection of expensive cars.
Steve slowly crawled towards Tony, slowly took his cold, trembling hands into his own, and slowly pulled him into his embrace. “Cry. Scream. Hit me if you’d like. Whatever it is you wanna do. You don’t have to be alone tonight.”
“In Howard’s study room. He’s been in there for a while now,” Bruce answered. “I’m gonna go check on him.”
“Tony,” Steve’s tone is stern. Commanding. Authoritative. Tony freezes. “I don’t think any less of you because of what I know about you now. I promise you. What I know about you has only merely helped me understand you and your actions better. Do you understand?”
A broken sob escapes the brunet’s lips. His shaky hands reach for the soldier’s chest and gently lay flat atop him. “I-I’m so f-fucking s-sorry. I d-didn't mean an-anything I s-said. P-Please don’t b-be mad. P-Please d-don't...” he chokes on a sob. “P-Please d-don't leave.”
Clint looked through the various playlists of movies they set up on screen in search for Tony’s favorite while everyone tossed around pillows and blankets to set up the room.
“I found it,” he whispered to himself, but the soldier's ears heard it just fine. He followed Tony’s eyes, and his own watered in warmth and pride. Tony turned his head to face the soldier. “I found you.”
“Which I can fix if I get to my lab.” He sighed heavily as he raised his head, and his eyes landed on the concerned and sad (
The engineer and the spy pointed at each other to speak of who started it first in unison, and everybody on the table laughed at just how childish they are being. Steve, however, was all infatuation and heart eyes for the childish brunet. He smiled a little wider when Tony batted his eyelashes innocently before flicking yet another bean at the red head, who opened her mouth to chew at it and stuck her tongue out when Tony whined. “Sore loser!” She exclaimed.
Once he’s alone in his lab, he opens a new tab on his computer and starts typing away. Once satisfied with what he’s written, he goes to his room to get ready. He showers and spends a few extra minutes under the warm water and
“No word of this to the others. Okay?” Thor nodded and swore not to tell as he left off to his room.
He sat up quickly and avoided looking at the Captain, and Steve let him do whatever he was comfortable with. “Good morning, Tony.”
A comfortable silence washed over the hours. Steve breathing in Tony’s scent and occasionally tracing his fingers around the glowing blue, Tony running his fingers through Steve’s hair and occasionally landing kisses atop the golden locks. None of them dared to move, no matter how numb their limbs grew to be, and none of them got any sleep. It was simply too good to miss on.
“Duh. You used to be not a pile of walking muscle. And global warming wasn't one of Earth’s biggest issues right after aliens.”
“I slipped? I don’t even remember leaving my bed,” Tony asked with furrowed brows. “And why are you all awake? Is everything okay?”
With that being said, she threw a punch, and Tony's reflexes avoided it just on time. "Good," she praised. "Now let's practice some more."
He watched as Steve’s steady hands unbuttoned the buttons of his shirt slowly and carefully. Once the shirt was unbuttoned, Tony shook the fabric off him. For a solid minute, all he did was stare at Steve’s eyes. He felt naked not in the way that he had no shirt on, but in the way that displayed all there is to him: weak and weary with efforts of chasing after normalcy.
“Colonel,” Steve hiccupped. “We’re gonna do whatever it takes to do right by him. I promise you we will. We... we didn’t realize we care about him so fucking much. We were so fucking horrible to him. God, I was so horrible.”
“You don’t belong here either,” Tony said, and Steve’s eyes softened. “Technically, I do,” Steve argued.
“She might, uh, recall me as someone else. Don’t deny it and don’t try to correct her. Don’t be cruel to her,” Tony whispered the last part as if to himself, and Steve understood.
“You need to get them out of the tower as soon as possible, most preferably by noon, until we can make sure the tower is safe. These HYDRA agents are sneaky, and I’m sure they must have bugged the place if they were able to get through JARVIS as easily as they did,” Fury murmured. “Any idea how that might have happened?”
They spent the night on the roof after the prank was carried out, which turns out Natasha had known about Bruce and Thor’s conspiracy against the archer and went to warn him. Natasha and Clint conducted a prank of their own and ended up getting the Doctor and the God of Thunder first. Tony and Steve watched from afar as Thor tried to remove the wet hair strands away from his face. “You shall feel the wrath of my pranks alongside the incredible Hulk soon enough, traitors!”
Bruce’s eyes skimmed over the glowing blue arc reactor, then over Tony’s face. Alive. Breathing. Glowing blue.
“Does anybody ever win in a war? But we believe that you can kill the messenger, not the message. And we definitely let them know of ours.”
“We’re not enthusiastic about the cooking, we’re here for the competition and insults and—damn it, Joe! That gravy looks runny as hell!” Clint yelled yet again.
Steve’s feet would’ve jumped in excitement if they hadn’t felt so light. He felt like one of those girls in those chick flick movies Clint loved so much where the girl finally gets to go out with her crush. He couldn’t contain his smile as he went to shower and sing. He threw away various items of clothing carelessly until he found the black bomber jacket Tony was referring to and kept sighing in frustration when his hair didn’t look as perfectly as he wanted it to.
Clint cut himself short when Colonel James Rhodes walked in with a box of doughnuts in hand. “Hey guys,” he greeted them, but his raised brow showed his confusion. “So he’s locked himself in, huh?”
Steve is taken aback for a solid second, but it passes by quickly and is replaced by a nod and a tight grimace. Tony’s blood is not boiling, it’s simmering on a dangerously low heat.
"Sei al sicuro. Sei lontano da quel posto. Sei qui, in America. Nella torre. Stai bene." = You're safe. You are far from that place. You are here, in America. In the tower. You're okay.
“You are too much of an unstable, spontaneous prick to be handling these suits. There! I said it!” Fury yelled, and the Avengers’ eyes widened. It was clearly meant to be a secret between them, but Fury’s patience was wearing thin, and Tony’s emotional anger and numbness were too comfortably mixed for him to take offense.
“Damn right! You can see he added too much butter. My man Joe’s going home for sure,” Tony said as he shook his head at the contestant’s futile efforts.
Tony nodded once as he lowered his gaze, and Steve quickly realized his tone was authoritative and commanding. He sighed. “I’m gonna try again. I’m gonna keep trying.”
He turned around and saw the superheroes hold various looks on their faces, but the look of pity was still there. He avoided looking at them as he flipped the coffee table. Somehow, the rubies looked much prettier shattered and scattered around the table rather than sticking to it. He wondered if he would look just as pretty with blood scattered around him in the same fashion.
Steve held on to the small body in his arms tighter as he listened to slurred, yet pained words that he couldn’t quite comprehend. His own eyes were stinging as the wails reached their peak, but Steve understood. This was years and years of emotions bubbling above the surface as they poured over like lava. This was a wild animal finally let out of its cage. This was a broken child finally let out of a broken, luxurious home, only to seek refuge in it when life gets shaky and unsafe. It’s almost as if Tony was doomed to never find a home—to never be safe. He was constantly moving from one unsafe place to another, and constantly hiding from one threat after the other. But they all seemed to chase after his tail until they bit it, and the worst part, he let it. He let himself come back to the mansion. He let Steve talk about Howard. He let Clint criticize him for calling his father by his first name and never “dad." He let Natasha not recommend him. He let Thor constantly underestimate him. He let Bruce constantly point out everything wrong with him.
Steve’s heart broke and he immediately removed his hand as if touching Tony burnt his skin, and the engineer retreated to practically bashing his head against the wall behind him. Steve had to stop this, and his heart sank in terror when Tony screamed, “OBI STOP! I DON’T WANT THIS I DON’T WANT THIS STOP MESSING WITH MY MIND OBI! GET OUT OF IT GET OUT OF IT GET OUT OF IT!”
major apologies for the delay in updating/replying to the comments, i had BURNT MY FUCKING HAND and had to take the time off for it to heal :)) not fun.
“Actually, yes.” Steve revels in the blush that phrase leaves on the engineer’s face. “Watcha’ working on?”
He’s grown too familiar to the genius to know so much about him. How he’s like when he’s nervous, sad, scared, happy, and how he drinks his coffee.
“I have a guest with me, Peggy. Remember Steve?” Tony said and signaled for Steve to enter. Steve walked over to her slowly as she kept blinking at him in disbelief. He held his breath as he took a seat by her bed and held her wrinkled hand. “Hey, Peggy,” he whispered.
Steve did as he was told, trailing his hands over Tony’s shoulders as he went along. Tony’s muscles didn’t tense, and Steve took that as a good sign.
“Ladies and gentlemen and raging monsters, it is an epic moment in history. The moment where Tony Stark, THE Tony Stark, the MVP, the genius of all geniuses, the legendary Man of Iron, plays against American patriot, Nazi-puncher, and veteran Steve Rogers, who we thank for his honorable service,” Clint said in a faux narrator voice.
Tony blinked at the archer. He didn’t quite comprehend the statement, but it did have a warm, gentle hold on his heart. “Thank you,” he whispered again.
Tony sighed and stepped back, suddenly feeling incredibly raw and exhausted. Steve sensed it and asked if whether he should unlock the door or not.
"It was not better, Tony. We're so sorry. God, we're so fucking sorry. It wasn't normal either. We were so horrible to you," Clint said as tears rolled down his cheeks.
The next clip played, and the Avengers realized that Tony must have compiled these videos in one tape. However, someone was holding the camera this time around.
On the nights when Steve wouldn’t be able to sleep, he’d wind up in the communal kitchen. Tony was on his way to check up on the soldier after JARVIS had told him that the Captain appears to be crying. He had meant to walk in there and do whatever it takes to comfort the crying soldier, but he stopped dead in his tracks upon peeking his head and catching a glimpse of a black and white photo in his hands that he knew all too well—a picture of Captain America alongside Howard Stark.
He can’t help but take a short, shaky breath. “Do whatever you want,” he whispers it this time around, and Steve’s heart clenches in fear of the connotation behind this simple phrase.
Tony rolled his eyes, but smiled, nonetheless. She laughed when Dum-E beeped in protest and pulled at the hood, and Tony made the mental note of buying more hoodies for the redhead.
“Tesoro,” JARVIS corrected. “It’s an Italian word. A term of endearment that means ‘sweetheart.’ Its literal meaning, however, translates to ‘treasure.’”
Alzheimer, Tony learned, is a bitch. There were so many things he had to consider before he gets to walk into the room. He has changed quickly in his car into his MIT hoodie and sweatpants, combed through his hair so the hair strands would fall onto his face much like how it looked like back then, and wore red sneakers because dressing shoes could be enough to confuse her. Now he fiddled nervously with the hems of his sleeves as he watched nurses walk in and out of the room as they changed bedsheets and cleaned the rooms, a routine that ensued before visiting hours would start, which he had to wait for five more minutes before he was allowed to be let in. He used the time to pray to whoever was hearing him that she wouldn’t confuse him for Howard like she always did, or fall asleep. He knew she couldn’t help it, but today was the last time he would see her, and he wanted to drift off with a beautiful memory of her without it getting tainted because of him.
Tony slept peacefully for a few hours through the night, and the Avengers plus Rhodey watched over him. They hadn't known they would enjoy the sight of watching someone's chest steadily rise and fall as they breathed, or the sight of the glowing blue arc reactor shine bright and light up the dim room. Not to mention the sight of Tony's face on its own was enough to knock the air out of their chests. He looked so young and stress free. A few strands of hair fell on his face as he stirred, and Natasha delicately brushed them away. She felt her heart warm and break all the same when Tony leaned into the touch.
Except Tony held on tighter when Steve tried to do as Dr. Banner instructed. He could hear the man cry “no no no no no” the more he tried. He tried to get his face off his chest, and in an attempt to do so, he made the wrong move. He tried to tug on the billionaire’s hair, and he immediately realized his mistake as the brunet flinched violently and fell on his side on the floor. He hunched in on himself as he hugged his knees and his panic doubled over.
It takes him twenty-five more interviews for him to tell the host off sternly “One more mention of Obadiah, and I will walk right out.” He came back home that day to a proud Rhodey who ruffled his hair and hugged him tightly as he cheered “That’s my boy!” and a smirking Natasha who fist bumped him and kissed his cheek. “Good job, Antoshka.”
Truth be told, he didn’t see progress. All he saw were his slip ups and bad days. His therapist always reminded him that progress is not linear; there will be inflection points along the way. Tony Stark is a man of logic and science, and he understood things most human beings wouldn’t, but this was simply too hard to grasp the concept of. He was not going to give up on therapy, however. Not now, anyway. He needed to give himself more time. He understood that aspect of it solely because he has tied it to science and his ways of collecting data. Collecting data takes time to understand and improve. Surely this is the case with him.
Tony shut his eyes as he attempted to focus on Clint’s voice. He felt his chest constrict as his mind fought for the chase after the light in the lyrics of the song.
However, Thor seemed to have an idea to put an end to this. He reached out slowly with both hands towards the engineer, and spoke softly as he told him of every move he was taking towards him. He placed his hands against the screaming man's temples and closed his eyes.
She thought), she would always hear Pepper remind him of the time and the setting whenever he grew agitated throughout the day. Of course, Natasha had known of Tony’s case of PTSD, she just never really saw much of the symptoms, and therefore, ignored it completely.
“Whatever I wanna do?” Tony sniffled as he held onto Steve’s blue shirt. His eyes were big and innocent as he looked up to the Captain with tears pouring out of them, and Steve couldn’t shake the image he has seen of his tear stained face on a big screen gulping pills on straight vodka. His heart sank all the same when Tony whispered, “All I wanna do is kill myself.”
Tony Stark is a young man—in his late twenties. And even if he wasn’t so young, nobody quite moves on from things like that. He remembers after one of their movie nights together, everybody shared their commentary on the family-friendly movie about a child’s relationship with his parents. Everybody spoke of childhood memories the movie reminded them of. Even Natasha, who Steve came to know didn’t become part of the Red Room training team until her teenage years. Looking back on that night, he realizes that Tony had stayed silent, and eventually excused himself to spend the rest of the night in his lab. It was the first and last time Tony has ever participated in their weekly movie nights.
When a TV channel in the background blared its opinions of Tony, Clint muttered “Man, y’all should go straight to hell,” and flipped the channel over to a basketball game he’s passionate about. Tony simply shrugged. Despite anything ever, the media still found a way to place him under a bad light, and he’s gotten pretty used to it to properly care. Besides, he doesn’t quite blame them. If anything, he can’t comprehend the fact that the general public seems to take a liking to him, but then again, they seem to only like the funny sarcasm and the arrogant persona he has molded himself into, not to mention the Fuck-the-Government anarchist movement he seemed to lead these days that nowadays teens seemed to be great fans of. So he figured that for as long as they don’t like who he actually is, everything’s peachy.
“This calls for a celebration,” Rhodey said as he shoved a piece of doughnut in the genius mouth, to which he accepted with a smile. Steve couldn’t help but crave this casual intimacy with the brunet.
“Jerk,” Tony muttered with a lighthearted glare. “And what do you mean ‘smells different’? I take a lotta good care of my clothes.”
But nothing felt as warm as seeing a glowing blue emit form Tony’s chest. Nothing felt as warm as being in the presence of Tony.
Bruce showed up a few minutes later with bowls of food to the people residing in the lab, and Rhodey showed up shortly after with extra boxes of doughnuts. Tony took a break to enjoy the food he’s been spoiled with before he delved yet again into work.
Tony often lied to himself, that much was true, but he also knew that he was tired of himself. He was tired of those screams in his head and of the images of a weak and vulnerable state of himself living in the forefront of his mind.
“There’s a grand present for each one of you awaiting you in designated floors in the tower,” JARVIS explained delightfully. “Kindly take the elevator so I can show you. Also, Sir wishes you a merry Christmas.”
"Here. It's an electric heating blanket," he gingerly wrapped it around the Captain. His hands were shaking, and Steve didn't have to strain his eyes to see it.
“That’s not how you like your coffee,” Tony pointed out as he took a seat on the stool opposing the soldier. “Something’s on your mind.”
This was supposed to feel good any minute now. He was supposed to let go of the restraints of the past and shake its hand as he smiles at its face to say
Tony’s calloused hands tried to comfort the Captain. One hand was rubbing his back, the other running through his blonde hair. Although he did feel sensitive to the touch today, he pushed that aside and focused on soothing the soldier. Steve was shaking and trembling hard in his arms, and although the room was getting too hot for Tony’s liking, he urged JARVIS to increase the temperature a bit more. Steve’s body finally felt warm at that, but his left ear was right over the glowing blue, and Tony’s heart was beating out of his chest. He moves his head to face the brunet, who looked eerily numb. There was no light in his eyes. Steve might as well paint on his face for it was an empty canvas. Steve shuddered, and stopped Tony from ordering JARVIS to raise the temperature by saying, “Stay. Don’t leave me. I can’t lose you too.”
Tony was having a full-on panic attack now, and Clint would’ve called someone like Steve or Rhodey to do something if it weren’t for the fact that everyone was out of the tower on solo missions for a day, leaving him and Tony alone to binge watch shitty romcoms and chick flick movies and accidentally set food on fire.
“I don’t care about the liberal agenda anymore, Pepper! It’s boring, boring, and I'm not gonna—OO! Hey there, big guy. God, do I love that hoodie on you,” Tony beamed at Steve before he addressed Pepper again. “I need about fifteen million dollars donated to the students of MIT. That’s final.”
as he bows his head and wait for the next line of command, but the rebellion of a broken teenager and the anger coursing through his veins mix comfortably, and he whispers a venomous “Fuck you” to Captain America.
It took three weeks, fourteen therapists walking in and out of the tower, and sleepless nights in which Tony’s mental breakdowns lured his mind into a dark abyss. Some days, he would be able to sedate those thoughts and keep them at bay. Other days, he would feel hopeless. He was at constant war with himself and never truly knew whether his emotions deserve validation or not. All he knew is he couldn’t risk scaring anyone ever again, which meant he had to be all smiles and typical casual snark around everybody. And of course, they saw right past him, they just refused to pressure him into talking about it especially when he has already made the progress of admitting to his need for therapy.
“You’re such a mother hen, Rogers,” Tony teased, but something about Steve’s eyes clad in fondness sent yet another surge of pain through the glowing blue.
“We still got a few seasons to watch of Hell’s Kitchen,” Clint tells him upon taking a seat on the kitchen table.
“I know you would,” he whispered. “Which is why I didn’t call or text. I didn’t want anything to change my mind. I just... wanted to leave.”
The doctor nodded as she clicked her pen to write something down. “Do you not see a middle ground? Is the Captain either totally bad or totally good in your eyes?”
Steve smiled warmly and read the excerpt from the page he was on out loud for Tony to fall asleep to.
Tony’s lips frowned in understanding of where this was coming from. Rhodey had told him that Bruce was in the surgery room when the doctors had almost given up and verbally announced him dead. For someone like Bruce, he figured out it must have been traumatizing.
There’s something beautiful about the way the daylight comes through the windows of Tony’s lab. It hits the scattered pieces of metal and Steve marvels at the sight of illuminations decorating the walls. He watches the bots rise from their sleep and tilt their heads (
Nothing warmed his poisoned heart more than realizing that the Captain has been with him all afternoon, and celebrating along with the bots and AI the results of the compatibility check:
Steve’s heart breaks right then and there because he knows this was nothing but a product of years and years of absolute misery and silence. He knows those rough, calloused hands have felt more pain than what they tried to exert fisted against his chest. He knows those eyes have seen more pain and poured more tears than all the times they had thrown a mean glare. He knows those lips have been made to speak and to shut under humiliating subjugation more times than they have ever come to voice out the snark and sarcasm Steve has learned to love.
“Sir, Agent Fury is demanding your presence in the upcoming meeting. He says it’s urgent and that there will be consequences if you fail to show up,” JARVIS eloquent voice says. “I would also like to remind you of your meeting in the afternoon with the British AI Empire.”
He was discharged a few days later, which was nothing short of a miracle to him. SHIELD wanted to put him under surveillance (
Steve’s heart feels solid and heavy. It feels and sounds wrong to hear those words come out of Tony. Something feels wrong and rotten. The air around him is no longer warm or welcoming, and he resists the urge to hold onto Tony’s shoulder and beg him to shoot a snarky comment at him, to make a silly joke that would make him uncomfortable yet blushing, to attend the meeting Fury has been practically begging him to attend and distract everybody with his comments while spinning his chair around childishly, to be Tony Stark.
The grotesque ruins of Gulmira make him shudder under his red-gold suit. Gray ashes dance around the land of destroyed houses and men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. There are children who peek their heads through the brick walls with their dark doe eyes in fear and fury. A young girl stands right in front of him with hair matted in gray ashes and her cheeks smeared with dirt and blood, but her fists are curled around a sharp stone. There’s no fear in her eyes, just red alarms. He asks JARVIS to translate the words to her that he’s not gonna hurt them. She doesn’t move.
“Yeah, um. I know. Okay. I'll come up with something new. Oh and Pepper, make sure the gala on Thursday doesn’t get any form of media coverage. And make sure you invite that other billionaire I always forget the name of. He always leaves a lotta money behind,” Tony said as he gave a warm smile to Rhodey when he left him his plate of cake on the counter.
At some point, Natasha came down offering help and was shut down. She sat around for a while reading a book next to Steve, and then played a game of virtual basketball against Butterfingers. She demanded JARVIS that she be named Virtual Basketball Lord on the score board after she had broken Tony’s high score. “JARVIS you follow with that and I swear to god I’m donating you to the nearest community college.”
Once the wall was devoid of any pictures, he tilted his head in appreciation of the sight. The glass shards decorated the floor, the pictures laid ripped and wrinkled alongside the sharp shards, but he was still not as satisfied. His hands weren’t shaking, they were itching for more of this.
“You know, my mom used to have this garden. She used to plant herbs and flowers. Her favorite flowers to plant were tulips,” Steve said as he picked on a daisy by his side, his eyes glazed with reminiscence over the past.
Thor crouched by Tony’s side and pried the panicking man’s hands away forcefully and demanded that Steve keeps holding his hands as Tony started to flail around.
He shut his eyes tightly. In his mind, he was kicking himself for being so vulnerable, and he looked up again. He could see the stars alright, he just couldn't admit that there was much beauty to them, for all he could see was
It took killing him and spending two weeks alone with Rhodey, whose eyes widened in horror when a heavily drunk Tony casually told him he misses the sex with the deceased man, only to spill more and more information and confessions a sober version of Tony would never speak about how it all started when he was sixteen. Rhodey sat him down for a long, long talk that started off with,
Tony refused any help when it came to fixing the arc reactor. Steve had tried to help by lifting heavy objects to where Tony would want them to be, but the genius threatened to kick him out. “You can sit around and watch but other than that, don’t do anything. And don’t give me that beaten puppy look of yours, I'm not changing my mind.” So Steve let out a loud puff of air, and marched back to a bench where he continued sketching. Tony quickly took his shirt off to reveal a black tank top he wore underneath, and Steve had to force his eyes back on his sketchbook before he embarrassed himself. He knows that now’s not the time to be expressing his infatuation and what not, and he doesn’t mind it. As long as he gives Tony the time and care that he needs, he’s a happy man. He considers it a privilege that he’s been given the chance in the first place.
“JARVIS, what is this? When the fuck did all of this happen?” he whispered as he shook his head at the sight of a woman scream and try to pull her husband’s crushed figure from under a collapsed building.
“We know enough,” Steve put a hand over the tape in Tony’s hand. “Please don’t do this to yourself.”
“Yeah, yeah. But it’s the only thing keeping him alive. Without it, the shrapnels lost in his chest will get to his heart and mince it. It’ll be a very slow and painful death...” Bruce shuddered and so did Steve.
. He complied. Shaking the heavy blazer of his suit off and taking his tie off, he rolled the sleeves of his dress shirt and sat on a short stool behind the Captain. Steve talked of how the mission went as Tony washed away dirt and blood out of his hair and listened intently. He couldn’t help but plant kisses to the back of his head and shoulders as he went about, and Steve’s heart skipped beats.
“No, we don’t wanna throw no party. We just wanna celebrate with you, but it’s okay. Maybe next year,” Clint said with a smile.
“Any other point in your life where stress is nonexistent? Do you recall a point in your life, even if it were in the past, where you have felt safe?”
It’s been sixteen hours and twenty-nine minutes of SHIELD’S nurses and doctors rushing in and out of the emergency room where Tony’s surgery was held. They were able to remove just one shrapnel that got dangerously close to his heart but removing any more was a huge risk that they decided to not delve into. Bruce went inside to help the medical team, but when the heart monitors started blaring a flatline, Bruce’s skin turned a dangerous shade of green as he fell to his knees and started screaming for Tin Man to wake up, and the roar of the green rage monster was enough to have the team stand in absolute shock and denial of that god awful flatline laced with the Hulk’s roar. Rhodey had knocked on the locked doors of the room with all his might as he screamed for Tony’s heart to beat on. “You’re my family! I need you here! Please don’t go! Please wake up, Tony!”
“Nothing. I’m good,” he said and coughed violently. Natasha caught sight of purple veins forming a pattern around his neck. “Your arc reactor. It’s giving you trouble.”
"That's flattering. Really, it is. But I'm no defender. I'm just a man in a can," Tony said with a shrug.
He had fallen to his knees. His chest heaved as he trembled and clutched fistfuls of hair to tug on. But his mind didn’t stop pushing one image after the other. He was frozen yet again, but he heard the genius ask JARVIS to increase the temperature of the room, and felt the warmth engulf him instantly when Tony knelt in front of him and landed his palms upon the Captain’s shoulders.
And when Steve walks into the lab, Tony lifts his eyes off whatever he’s working on to look into the soldier’s baby blue eyes and throws a smile that Steve has come to learn is only reserved to him.
He didn’t know the word to this back then, and he didn’t know that it was bad. All he knew was that he was drunk, Obadiah was almost always around him and away from his wife, and something about how Tony owed him just that much.
“Then congratulations. You are not a Stark.” His eyes blinked at her with a glint of love and warmth. The same love and warmth he has for Rhodey, for these were the only two people who know how he’s like and how to love him not in the way that suited them, but in the way that suited him. He wanted nothing but to reach out to her and hug her tightly and smell her signature floral perfume, but he wouldn’t do that to her. It’s enough that she’s sat closely by his side. She’s pure, beautiful, and intelligent. He didn’t want to taint her by his touch.
It didn’t matter whether he improves by the next minute, the next hour, the next week, the next year, or even the next decade. What mattered is that he had a purpose, something—
“Quit bullshitting me, Stark. Why did you do it?” Stern, commanding, authoritative. Tony felt cornered, and that’s when he rebelled the most.
“I wouldn’t let you go there alone,” a feminine voice said and sat carefully next to him. “I wanna help him too. We all do.” He looked around to see that the other members were emerging from their rooms to accompany their Captain.
He opened his eyes with a choked scream and saw chocolate eyes wear worry and relief. “There you are! You had me worried, big guy.”
“Is this what this meeting is all about? Can I just go now?” Tony feels agitated and uneasy, and he’s realizing that time is fleeting and
God knows just how much Tony had needed to hear words of comfort when he lost Jarvis to cancer. He had screamed and drank himself to sleep almost every night. It didn’t help that Aunt Peggy was almost always not around due to her work. He had craved for someone to be around, to tell him it’s okay to grieve, to allow him to. All he ever heard from Obadiah was
“See? She doesn’t believe you,” Tony said. When Steve sighed in defeat and sat down, Tony’s eyes narrowed, and his head tilted in confusion. Steve wanted to scream it right then and there—how good,
Thor’s hands went to wipe at his tears, and Tony placed his hands over them. “Let them fall. It’s okay, I promise. I can go if you want to have the moment to yourself.”
“Calm down, friend,” Thor whispered as he knelt on the floor to sit by the raging scientist. “At least we know that man failed in his doings. Tony is safe now.”
A steady sound he could hear in the back of his mind that annoyed him. He wondered if this is all there is to the afterlife—darkness and beeping sounds.
“You don’t gotta be so sad as to sleep off your shame of being beaten in virtual basketball. It’s okay, Tony. I’ll let you win when we spar sometime again,” Natasha teased.
“Tony,” Steve whispered softly. The engineer flinched and looked up at the Captain. Bigger than him, stronger than him, faster than him, could easily pin him down...
“Beat their asses in chess,” JARVIS said smugly. Tony laughed as Clint’s jaw hung open and he looked up to the ceiling, “Oh, screw you, JARVIS! And here I thought you were the coolest AI ever.”
“Waiting for someone to decide for you...” Steve spilled out what Tony’s tongue fought to say, and Tony bowed his head further and nodded.
“Rhodey and I used to pull pranks all the time on people we didn’t like,” he said with a fond smile, and his doctor couldn’t help but mirror that smile as he spoke of their miraculous pranks. He spoke with a glee his therapist has not seen on him before, but it died down quickly. “It was always worth it. Seeing Rhodey laugh and smile because we got a bastard good. But I was heavily monitored by the administration there because of my father’s orders. So I always got in a lot of trouble whenever I returned back to the mansion for the holidays.”
“Yeah, I kinda put on a real show for them. Had one of my mental breakdowns or whatever those are called, and I may or may not have broken everything in that place,” Tony said coolly as he bit down on another doughnut.
“How so?” Steve asked. And that’s the thing. He doesn’t know how. He just feels it. He shrugs and taps on the surface of the glowing blue symbol of life. Steve can see how nervous and on edge he is. He can tell Tony’s mind is racing with something he could say to change the subject. So he spares the man the trouble.
“Try to keep him company. I’ve already set up another therapy session with him later on this week.” Rhodey’s eyes widened with pride. When the doctor left and Tony came out to the kitchen for a cup of coffee, they insisted he stays for dinner with them. He agreed under the condition that Rhodey would cook, and the Colonel had instantly started getting all the relevant ingredients he would need to prepare the genius’ favorite food.
“Yeah, yeah. No need to thank me,” the genius said as he narrowed his eyes at the god. “Something’s up with you. What’s the matter? Something happened on Asgard?”
Tony winced as he recalled the words. Part of him still believed that he has been asking Obadiah for it all along, that Obadiah didn’t break and brainwash his mind enough to force Tony to ask for it.
“No,” Steve answered with a grimace. “SHIELD gave me a fake address. Said it was keeping her safe that way.”
Too late. Steve has always been too late. Even when he had grown to take a liking of the man, he’s been too late to let him know. He’s aware that any act of expressing his feelings is bound to come out as an act of pity and sympathy, and although he did feel sympathetic, he did not want those feelings to mold into one. Tony has built high walls off an egoistic persona, which is enough to indicate that he is not waiting on anybody to pity him. It sounds as awful as it is knowing they didn’t become so friendly to the engineer until they have watched the tapes, and it makes him wince to recall how unsettled and confused Tony was by their respectful acknowledgement of him—how he was constantly asking if they were alright—because this was the first time they have been included with him in the same setting without it ending in arguments and hurtful words thrown around (
“Don’t be silly,” Tony whispered. His heart broke as Steve’s fingers started tracing around the diameter of the arc reactor with mutters of “H-He’s a-alive" accompanied by pained sobs. The panic coursing through Steve’s mind wouldn’t calm down. Tony has never thought he would ever feel guilty over his suicide attempts, but now, that’s all his heart aches over.
Rhodey was conflicted and uncertain of what he should do. Every time he walked into the lab, he held his breath until he saw his best friend working and tinkering about. Alive and glowing blue. For the first time, he found himself at complete loss on how to deal with Tony, and he was Rhodey. Tony’s Rhodey. The guy who knew of the billionaire better than anyone else in the world. And when Rhodey admitted his worry over his best friend with no suggestions of a solution, the Avengers looked horrified.
FOR HOWARD. Smudged. Old. Dusty, except for a few fingerprints leaving their mark against the dust and—
“Like the best person on planet Earth. In all realms. In the entire galaxy—hell, the universe!” He went over to the table where the box of doughnuts was and filled his mouth with fried dough and strawberry frosting goodness. “God do I love you.”
“You really like to test how much I love you, huh?” Pepper said through her tears. “I pulled a you during the meeting with the Romanians. Walked out during the middle of the meeting and told them to go fuck themselves when they tried to hold me back. Am I a Stark now?”
Steve marveled at the sight before him: a large field of what the soldier believed had all types of flowers. It smelled of spring and blooming hope. There was a large tree in the far-right side of the field by the daisies. Steve couldn’t help but think of how much his mother would’ve loved this place, and his hands itched for a pencil and a sketchbook in hopes of capturing a fraction of such beauty.
“Don’t. Don’t talk to me like that. I’m your family, and you are mine. I’m not gonna fucking watch my family die. If not for you, then don’t do this to me. Don’t take my family away from me. You have no right.”
“Simmer down, Captain,” Natasha tried to comfort him, knowing full well that Steve had such a soft spot for the billionaire. “Alright. I have found an unlabeled tape. Let’s watch.”
Tony nodded and gulped. “You’re much bigger than me. You all are,” he whispered as he ran his hands yet again over the broad shoulders. “Much stronger than me,” he ran his hands over the Captain’s biceps. “Much taller than me,” he tiptoed as his hands ran up again to trace over the face of the man before him. “You could... easily...” Tony whispered as his chocolate eyes welled with tears.
for Steve’s sake. They didn’t fail to notice that there were no pictures around the place of a young Tony Stark, but only pictures of the Stark couple. Finally, they stopped right in front of his room. “Right. This,” he pointed to the door frame, “was my room. You do not under any circumstances enter it. You hear that? It’s locked, but I know it’s nothing a bunch of superheroes can’t break. Nevertheless, I do not want any of you in here. Please. I never say please, so this should be enough for you to realize that I really don’t want you in there, okay?”
“When I started paying attention to you instead of constantly argue and condemn you, I realized how much of an idiot I’ve been. I saw your determination and kindness. My own pride and ego kept me from reaching out to you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry it took watching these tapes for me to do away with my pride and ego for your sake. I should’ve done that much earlier. Should’ve told you. But I didn’t, and now it all comes out wrong and not how I want it to be and it’s because I fucked up. But Tony, I promise you with every inch of my fiber that I'll do better. I swear by it. I know none of us have your trust, but we’ll earn it. We’ll prove we’re worthy of gaining it, and I promise you that when this day comes, I will never take it for granted. I just need you to believe me.” By the time Steve was done talking, his eyes held warm tears that didn’t pour out until Tony spoke the words the soldier’s tightened chest loosened over.
Tony flinches violently at that and takes a step back. His fisted hands unfold and shake as they drip not with blood, but with shame and dissipating anger—anger that he had for himself all along, and has poured into the Captain’s chest; the haven that once served as a source of warmth for his safe and sound sleep. The low heat has gone out, and now Tony’s blood and stomach are sickly warm.
“Okay, but I’m not an idiot! Take it back, Tony!” the Captain crossed his arms and feigned taking offense. Tony rolled his eyes, but smirked as he said, “I have a thing for idiots, anyway,” and watched Steve’s jaw drop to the floor.
Clint’s eyes widened before they softened yet again. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I didn’t know…”
“David, you absolute moron, you were supposed to pour buttermilk instead of cream!” Tony yelled at the TV.
Steve ran his fingers through the dark hair and placed a kiss on the man’s forehead. “Thank you. Thank you so much,” he whispered.
Tony’s eyes furrowed in confusion, but he decided that they must be concerned for the doctor and let his confusion seep out of his mind quickly. He focused on calming the man in his arms, and soon enough, the doctor pulled away with a shaky smile. “I’m sorry. Got your shirt all wet.”
After a heated argument with a SHEILD agent, Tony found himself hunched over where he was sat in the kitchen table. Steve and Natasha exchanged looks of concern every time Tony’s hand slipped under his shirt casually to hold onto the arc reactor. After the phone call was over, Tony got up and immediately rushed to his room. He took off the bandage he had wrapped around his torso to ease the pain and found the skin around the arc reactor covered in purple veins. He took the arc reactor out momentarily to adjust it comfortably, which surprisingly hurt an awful lot.
He stood in front of the fireplace; the team of superheroes left sat behind him, their calls for him left ignored.
was supposed to be, which he understands must have referred to the stacks upon stacks of money he owns, felt like nothing all along; his life had felt like swimming in a pool of nothingness.
He always held his chin up high for no other reason but to trap the tears behind his eyelids. He didn’t know any better. All he ever knew was to be a man of iron until he quite literally became one.
He didn’t know what to do when Tony started teetering on the edge of panic. He didn’t even know what triggered it. They were sketching robots together and talking about Thor’s long absence, which led to speaking about Loki, which led to speaking about the battle of New York, which led to—
Tony found his voice, and along with that, found anger. “I find it flattering you asked. But oh, wait! There are no tapes of my time in that cave. You guys are such visual learners.”
“Uh-huh. And since we’re being oh so technical, then technically I just called you beautiful,” Tony winked and marveled at the blush that crept along the blonde’s cheeks.
Everyone was soon gathered around going through the pictures that included Tony, which were noticeably few.
"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning—
Natasha was drowning in guilt. Her training had always eliminated the idea of giving people the benefit of the doubt. Thus, she came to know people by looking for the worst in them. She hadn't looked at Stark's self-destructive tendencies as a coping mechanism to make up for his suicidal ideations, and she definitely hadn't looked at his so-called narcissism as an attempt at seeking love and care that his attention starved childhood and brain were robbed off. For the first time in her life, she feels stupid.
They all got out of the car with Tony lingering longer in there as he slowly switched the vehicle off. Every hair and pore in his body was demanding him to run and not look back, but he knew he had no choice.
“I take the word ‘legend’ back,” Clint said with casual disdain, which shocked Tony. He expected them to drench him in pitiful looks, but all he heard were mutters of agreement upon Natasha’s phrase of “Glad the fucker’s dead.”
He resisted the urge to sprint to the lab now that Rhodey had said to give him time, but that didn’t mean that his heart wasn’t clenching in worry and fear for what that could have possibly meant. He was all smiles and laughs during dinner, and Steve figured that perhaps Rhodey is right; giving the brunet time seems to work.
Once they had reached the interrogation room, Fury left off a couple of pieces of advice and let him know that he will be monitoring through the comms as well. He was given an earpiece and Steve’s worried look.
“Nightmare,” he muttered as his eyes sought after the blue light emitting from the engineer’s chest.
“Ayye,” Clint beamed when he saw the small glowing triangle in the middle of Tony’s reactor and gave him a fist bump. “We’re gonna celebrate.”
Tony witnessed as Steve profusely wiped at his tears and got up towards a lit scented candle. The room that had smelled like warm vanilla soon smelled of burnt paper, and Steve’s tear stained face grimaced at the sight of the fire eating away at the picture. Tony decided to go back to his room. He found himself coming blank of any way he could help the Captain through this, and if he’s being totally honest, the presence of
“I don’t even know, man,” Rhodey sighed. “I mean. He seems to be doing okay? But then again he has always looked okay before shit hit the fan.”
Steve is about to admit to all his faults. He’s about to tell him of how wrong he was for being as selfish as to look for the Stark from his past rather than accept the Stark of the present. And when he accepted him, he had started to fall in love. But being the man of time that he is, he was too late. He’s about to fall on his knees by Tony’s side and beg him for forgiveness. He was about to say so much, but Tony’s next words stab right through his guilt-ridden heart.
A few still pictures of Tony from a few hours ago showed up. His clothes were crumbled on him, and his eyes were bloodshot red. Tony giggled and pointed at the screen, “Looook! It meeee!”
Tony twirled around on his chair as he listened on to Fury’s debriefing of their most recent mission. Steve and Natasha had been on a mission with the objective of bugging a secret underground facility of a terrorist organization, and Tony had hacked his way through the databases via said bugs. Fury was reviewing over the information he was supplied with, and Tony was too bored to care for what the director was saying.
It haunted him and tugged at the strings of his brain. He knew that suicidal ideations don't quite die when the body is saved—that they'll continue to nibble on his mind and wear him down until the ideations turn into actions, the attempt into commit.
He walked in on the gym again, and Tony’s eyes immediately landed on the soldier. He excused himself out of the ring and went over to the baby blue eyed man.
There’s no price to be paid. There’s no discomfort as he slides his tongue into the blonde’s mouth to dance along his own, and there’s no pain when he guides Steve’s hands on his waist and hips. There are only blooming flowers.
Now, he punched through the bags until JARVIS had notified him that Tony was back in the tower after the long meeting he had attended. Steve stopped and ran quickly into the bathroom to shower the sweat off, and picked out a fresh pair of gray sweatpants and the red hoodie Tony had once complimented him on. He took quick strides towards the communal area where Tony’s voice was coming from and saw as the team amusedly watch Tony argue with Pepper from the kitchen counter he was stood on.
Rhodey took the time to process the situation at hand and found himself shaking his head in disbelief. “Fury done did fucked up putting you back in that mansion.”
“S-Steve...” Tony gasped, but he was sure the soldier wouldn’t have been able to hear him. He reached desperately for the arc reactor, and successfully was able to get a hold on it, but his hands shook badly to be able to put it in his chest. He didn’t register when did Steve enter the room or when he took a hold of the arc reactor and told Tony that everything’s gonna be okay before inserting it in the genius’ chest, who gasped in relief upon seeing it glow again.
Tony, however, seemed to always avoid conversations about anything that revolves around his health, whether that be physical or mental, and he'd find clever ways to change the topic or shut the conversation down immediately. The Avengers stayed patient and refused to pressure him. They figured that the therapy sessions would be able to get to him once he starts attending them. For now, they worked on keeping him safe and under their warm care.
“I love you, Anthony. Jarvis loved you dearly. You will never know how he looked at you when you slept, or how he would kiss your forehead and run his fingers through your luscious hair when you’d catch a cold. You’ll never know how much we truly love you. And my boy, I'm not going to lie to you. Your life has never been easy. Any of it. Not your childhood, not your teenage years, not Afghanistan, not the New York battle, not Obadiah, not becoming Iron Man, and definitely not fighting alongside Captain America.”
“So it’s either be the government or SHIELD’s bitch? I’m not handing my property to any of you,” Tony says as he throws the file back to Fury. “Regarding this shit in my chest,” he points to the arc reactor, “I’m working on it. Trust me, it doesn’t feel all that great to incorporate heart attacks into my daily routine. And Iron Man? Yeah, that’s my property. You won’t touch it.”
He looked through the rearview mirror at Steve to see that look of excitement still in his eyes. He knew that visiting the mansion was Steve’s chance to connect to something from the past. He could tell that the soldier grew depressed over his inability to find closure with how the past has ended. Steve’s therapist always reported back to Tony as the consultant of the team to let him know of how the soldier’s mind was functioning, and she explained that forcing Steve to look on the bright side of events and to accept the future falls under a toxic sense of positivity.
“Go, Steve,” Natasha told him. “You guys couldn’t stop gazing into each other’s eyes the whole time.”
“If... say I didn’t care, which I do. I really do, Tony. But... say if I didn’t. Would you have still considered therapy?”
“Steve? Oh my god, Steve! Steve!” she cried. “I missed you so much! Oh my god! Oh my god, Howard! You did it! You found Steve!”
They don’t listen, and neither does Tony. Their voices mold into something he can’t comprehend. All he can think of is running away and leaving everything behind. He can’t live with this: the knowing. His brain refuses to believe that they know him for what he truly is.
As he grows weary with sleep, he comes to the realization that what he has now surely isn’t perfect; the burdens of the past and his sick mind are bound to trouble him. However, the warmth and sweetness of what his life is like now had once been thought of as luxuries he simply couldn’t have.
But there was no war and he wasn’t a soldier. He was the Merchant of Death, and he realizes that no debt would be hefty enough to hold him accountable for all the destruction he has caused.
“You don’t get it, do you?” Anger. Crimson red chunks of rubies. Cold, biting weather. “I need you to leave, Captain.”
Tony looked over at the entrance of the living room, where he heard a heavy sigh escape pink lips that wore a frown and saw blue eyes clad in a sheen that ached his troubled heart.
The Avengers weren’t quite convinced by that, Tony concluded. However, he could see that the green tint all over Bruce’s skin was absorbed back into the Doctor’s skin the more he spoke and the more he joked and teased around with his science bro. The rest of the members watched on fondly as Tony scooted the Doctor over so he would lie properly in the bed to calm down, but he stayed sat up, just closer to a safe, and alive Tony.
When the call was over, Tony excused himself to the lab and promised Clint to not take long. “I’ll be here in time for the show. Don’t you dare start it without me.”
“I’m—CAKE!” Tony hopped out of his stool upon seeing Rhodey pull out a chocolate cake from the fridge. He waited patiently for his best friend to place his slice on a plate but got interrupted by JARVIS notifying him of Pepper’s call. “Sure, put her through, Jay.”
A few minutes later, Steve came up looking like a lost puppy. “Guys, is everything alright? JARVIS said it was an emer—”
“S’f-fine. J-Just... s-stay,” Tony said through shallow breaths as he started clawing on the area around the glowing blue. Clint nodded miserably and promised to stay. Seeing Tony like this absolutely pained him, and he genuinely wanted to make him feel better and retreat to their silly conversations. Touching was out of the table, at least not when Tony was like this, so holding the engineer or running his fingers through the dark hair was a bad idea. The archer rummaged through his brain for another way he could help, and he prayed it would work.
“Yes,” Tony grimaced as he recalled the fear and the hot, white terror that washed over him when he had lost the chess round for the very first time in his life.
They took the elevator up to floor #34, which was Bruce’s. The floor was much bigger than the other floors, with its ceiling much higher. It was a lab, each item safe enough for the Hulk to be around of. There was also equipment big enough for the Hulk to use. The lab looked much better than Tony’s own. However, with a press of a four-code digit to a screen on the wall, the counters turned into those of a luxurious, grand, and modern kitchen stacked with all the spices Bruce didn’t even know existed. Much like the lab, the equipment was safe for the Hulk and there were bigger versions of it for the green being to experiment with.
“You think?” Rhodey fired back bitterly. “You were fucking cruel. But I should’ve fucking known it. Every fucking time I’d come to the tower, the tower that he named after y’all ungrateful fucks, he’d be alone in his lab. Always. I have never seen y’all near his floor ever. The only time you care is after you watch those fucking tapes. And you wonder why acting like you guys care all of the sudden is a tough pill for him to swallow?”
He broke all the vases and TV screens, tore through furniture and broke its wood, flipped all the chairs and tables, ignored the calls of the team, and walked right past them when they tried to stop him from tearing through the wallpapers or punching through the walls. He ran to the lounging area to do just the same thing around the room. It was not enough to sate the mania coursing through his veins, and his body shook with the need to do more. He ran up the long spiral of stairs and broke the door of his childhood room as he lunged at it with all his might. The room that he has once asked the team not to enter no matter what the circumstances are, he has welcomed them to walk through as they saw him tear through the mattress, the pillows, the sheets. He opened the closet and ripped all the Captain America posters he has kept with his hands and teeth. Not once did it cross his mind that the Captain was right there watching. He simply didn’t care.
They sat there in a comfortable silence, with Tony held tightly against Steve’s chest. The brunet couldn’t help the sigh of content that escaped him as he nuzzled his face against the blonde’s warm chest, often hearing his heart skip a beat. For the first time, he didn’t feel so small. If anything, what he felt was pleasantly strange. He didn’t know the word he could use for it, but as he turned his head towards the tree that witnessed his miserable years and held angry carvings as proof of so, he knew what it was.
Steve looked over at Natasha who gave him a wink, and he heard Tony giggle as he caught on to it. Tony pulled on Steve to follow him by the fabric of his hoodie to the elevator. He didn’t tell Steve where exactly they were headed, but Steve figured out it was Tony’s floor, which was always quiet and... lonely.
Late at night, and a few hours into his work, Tony received a message of an attached document from Thor. He opened it, and a hologram of gold-silver-red castles built on a realm came into view.
Tony pulled away as he breathed heavily. His eyes were dazed with the toll the act of intimacy must have taken on him. Steve was perfectly understanding of that, and he greeted the dopey smile on the brunet’s face with a warm one. “This was so good. You’re so good. God, you’re the absolute best,” Steve said breathlessly. Tony giggled as his eyes drooped and his head rested atop the soldier’s chest.
The scientist glared at the archer and promised Tony that they’ll wait for him, and the genius left off to his lab with a smile.
He shuts his eyes tightly and bites at his tongue to stifle a sob. When he thinks he’s got it under control, he nods, albeit frantically. “Yes. Yes, Peggy.”
And then there was Steve; he stood in the middle of the living room. His eyes shifting from the door Tony would enter from any minute now to his teammates. His blue eyes were dark, his skin itched with anticipation to hold the genius, and his body was trying not to cave in on itself in pain.
“What’s up, Bruce? You alright? Talk to me, buddy. You’re getting me worried,” Tony asked as he ran his fingers through Bruce’s hair.
“Oh god,” Bruce whispered. “Turn it off! I can’t watch this!” He bolted out of the room as his voice laced with that of the Hulk’s as his hands formed shaking fists. The team was too focused on the scene on screen, and too horrified, to react to anything else.
Steve didn’t get to finish his sentence as Tony tiptoed on his feet and put two slices of bread on each side of his face. The Captain could feel the brunet’s minty breath fan over his face as he said, “What are you?”
But Bruce scrambled to his feet as he snatched the medical devices from the physician’s hands as the Hulk’s voice dominated the scientist’s vocal cords. “Shut up! Tony hurt! But Tony no die!”
Steve blinked in shock. He couldn’t comprehend this anymore. In the span of one year, Tony has been kidnapped, his body altered and modified after a near-death experience, fought his way out only to return to the man who has abused his body and trust, watched the man who he had mistakenly trusted die, came out to the world as Iron Man, and nearly lost his life to aliens when he carried a nuke into a wormhole.
please leave comments of your thoughts and/or criticism of the chapter!! maybe even leave requests/prompts of what you would like to have me write in future works.
“It’s not fair to you either,” Steve whispered as he wrapped his arms around the brunet; his hold loose enough to grant Tony ease to escape, tight enough to hold him together.
One day, Steve decided to hang around in the genius' lab. He brought his sketchbook and pencils and a chlorophyll smoothie for Tony, who took a sip and muttered a "Nope." It wasn't the many benefits of said smoothie for someone with a high level of blood toxicity as his, but the Captain's puppy eyes that the genius didn't know would get to him half as much as they did, and he found himself snatching the bottle out of the soldier's grip as he groaned "Ugh, fine!"
—he has even once yelled at Tony that he could never amount to be half as great as his deceased father.
They put their sketches on hold and went to the communal area to watch yet another chick flick movie.
“No one knows of this place. It’s my getaway, and the first thing I bought with my inheritance money,” Tony said when Steve’s eyes focused on him.
A few minutes later, Fury calls to confirm JARVIS’ words. “We found him, but he refuses to speak,” he tells Tony through the phone. “Says he’ll only answer to you.”
“Captain America,” Tony whispered. The begs weren’t said, but they were heard, nevertheless. “Leave.”
“I don’t like when I lose to you in chess. Yeah, yeah you always win because you’re a smart bastard, but it still doesn’t change that I’m sore over being checkmated,” she said with a shrug. “How do you feel?”
Cold dread washed over Tony’s body. He took a step backwards as if the words had pushed him. He could hear Fury instructing him to get out. “This isn’t worth it, Stark. He’s messing with you. We’ve already got everything we wanted out of him.”
“Tony?” Steve spoke with a fondness in his voice that Natasha noticed was reserved only for the billionaire. Tony didn’t answer in fear that his voice would betray him to reveal just how much of a wreck he is. He drew a shaky breath as he flipped the paper around so they could read what he wrote.
“I believe you have slipped. But do not worry, Man of Iron. I have prayed the god’s of Asgard to heal you, and surely my prayers fell on attentive ears. You just ought to wash the blood away,” Thor smiled.
“Welp, thank god for serums and vaccines. I’ll go get you another blanket before you turn into an actual Capsicle,” Tony said with a pat to the Captain’s shoulder. He knew that somewhere in the house, they had an electric-blanket that he wouldn’t sleep without during his teenage years. He tries to recall where he had kept the blanket. In his old room? He looks there, and he can’t find it. He manages to find way too many suicide notes, however, and he lets out a bitter laugh as he chucks them away carelessly. He looks in the guest rooms, and he can’t find it. He enters his parents’ room, whispers a declaration that it’s not here before he could even make it past the doorframe, and walks out with a headache. His brain can’t recall where he has kept it. The last time he has used it was when he was fourteen, the night before Christmas, and—
So he let himself have bad days. He let his mind wander. He let himself be dramatic as he lamented over his exhaustion and frustration. The best part? Everyone around him engaged with him in it. When he sprawled over the couch, a frown etched on his face, Natasha sprawled on the floor next to him and started talking about an interesting conspiracy theory she came up with. When his mind wasn’t quite there to focus on the movie they gathered around to watch, Rhodey held him close to his chest and ruffled his hair like he always did. When he couldn’t focus on any of his tasks in his lab, Bruce dragged him to the lab of his floor instead and worked on an entirely new and fun project together. When he almost cried at the media’s recall of his days working with Obadiah, Clint turned the TV off and took him to his cloud-like vents to listen to his favorite music and eat as many blueberries as he wanted. When he couldn’t sleep at night, Steve walked into his room and took him into his embrace as he read a book out loud and watched the brunet fall into a deep, peaceful slumber.
“The contracts that you have on screen clearly state a single buyer’s name rather than an organization. Whatever the buyer chooses to do with what he has bought is out of our hands. We didn’t even know those weapons would be shipped outside of the USA. We do, however, admit that our former CEO has been involved in shady business. No denying that. And we ask the general public to separate the company, as well as Mr. Stark, from this narrative.”
He really needed space, but he also didn’t want to be alone, which ended up with him grunting in annoyance at the littlest of things as he sipped on bitter coffee in the kitchen and glaring at his mug as if it offended him. When Steve had walked up to him all smiles and sunshine, he felt a bit at ease, but his frown and glare didn’t falter.
“Is he really, Clint? Is he intimidating or are you, you son of a bitch, intimidated? Huh?” Rhodey seethed. “He sure as hell doesn’t look so above you now. Does it really have to take him to fucking kill himself for y’all to fucking care?! So when I, his only friend, am not on time to save his life, it’s a fucking robot that does? When he fucking lives among not one or two, but five super-fucking-heroes!”
“Your reckless behavior reminds me of him. My son. He did a lot of what you did. Lived life on the edge. It cost him a hefty price. I lost him too soon,” Fury muttered bitterly, and Tony’s wide eyes and tight frown were enough to speak for him. “I could care less about headlines. I just... I worry it’ll kill you one day. The media’s constantly talking about you. The government has tied our arms behind our backs and is not giving you a break. I can’t help but worry. I know I’m sometimes harsh on you. I just don’t know how to get you to stop. I’m sorry.”
“Well, how do you explain the Californian branch of the company still up and running?” The reporter asks.
"Don't." It came out harsher than Tony intended for it to be, but Steve wasn't about to point that out. He did see that blanket in Howard's study room, and he knew that Tony must have gone through much internal turmoil just so he won't turn into a "Capsicle."
The team mindlessly went through picture after picture until Natasha caught a picture of what came off as an innocent family photo posing in front of a Christmas tree. Various people were in the frame, and she easily recognized Peggy and Obadiah. That’s not what caught her attention, however. Tony’s face did. His eyes looked glossy and the skin surrounding his left one looked slightly discolored from oxidized makeup. His smile didn’t stretch to his eyes, and his stance looked quite defensive. It didn’t settle right with her, but she figured perhaps he was probably upset that day and let it go.
im also trying so hard to incorporate fluff here and there, but i feel like it's not working out..? i don't know? please let me know of your thoughts.
“Tony,” Steve started sternly, yet softly. “Do you think you owe me the reciprocation of my feelings to you?”
He stands by the doorframe of her room and watches as she brushes through her red hair. She looks at his reflection from the mirror, and smiles when the glowing blue’s light jumps off the reflective glass to twinkle on the wall of her room. A moment of silence diffuses into the air, and she lets it.
His therapist has basically drilled it into his head that he doesn’t owe people anything for simply tolerating him, and he did try to practice the art of saying “No” and of not feeling bad about it, as well as learning how to shamelessly change his mind even if it meant leaving people hanging.
Walking into the tower and seeing the bots whir and spin around enthusiastically at his presence had definitely stirred his emotions. Dum-E, especially, had wrapped its arm around its inventor with its clasps holding onto his shirt and whirred in content. "Thank you for saving me, you little snitching bastard."
“Christmas is coming up, Tony,” she said softly, and Tony’s breath stuttered ever so slightly. The super soldier’s ears picked up on it just fine.
Although this issue was up for mostly SHIELD to take care of, the media and the American government didn’t stop from there. They kept pushing the narrative of “Can Tony Stark really be trusted as Iron Man?” to which Colonel James Rhodes answered the senators and generals with “You do realize this is an issue that another man should be blamed for, right? The only real problem here being that said man is dead. Iron Man will always outweigh the liabilities. We are far past explaining this again.”
In his head, he was constantly cheered on for his decision. It made sense. He had worked nonstop for the past few weeks to ensure nothing would be affected by his departure. There were countless updates to the Avengers' suits and weaponries. He had built various War Machine suits for Rhodey to inherit. An official contract of passing his ownership of the company to Pepper was issued; it was just waiting for her signature. All his money was divided equally among orphanages, funding students’ projects and researchers seeking a cure for cancer, various organizations to end global hunger and homelessness, and organizations in the Middle East to help reverse the damage inflected by the US army, civil wars, and terrorist attacks. Not to mention how the Avengers were bound to receive their fair share of millions of dollars.
As the days passed by, he knew better than to lament over such thing. After all, he had people around him now. He doesn’t think these people realize just how crazy he would’ve gone if he had remained isolated and locked away in his lab, but he’s grateful it’s not like that anymore. He was left alone only when he absolutely needed to be, which was rarely ever. He didn’t have to be alone. It took him a while to learn how to reach out to people, because his therapist has raised quite an important thing to take note of: people can’t just read his mind. It was hard to grasp such idea, but as he stayed up through a work binge once upon a night, intrusive thoughts started feeding on his brain. It was right then and there that he had somehow understood what she had meant by practicing the art of reaching out, and so, he had inquired of Steve’s whereabouts. He walked into the dimly lit art studio where the artistic blonde sketched away.
A part of him was grateful that the tapes have told his story for him, but a part of him was also angry for that reason. It was suffocating and confusing. His mind was back to crying for normalcy.
Thor shot him a weak, genuine smile and nodded his acknowledgement. Tony went back to his lab to resume his work. If he had felt drained and on edge just an hour ago, he felt a mixture of sadness and relief all at once. Sadness for what Thor must be going through, and relief over the fact that he didn’t have to go through it alone. “Hey, JARVIS? Try to talk to Thor, okay? Keep him company and all. Maybe he’ll find it easy to open up to you.”
Thor then went on to talk about space and all the knowledge he has retained from his many adventures around different realms. Natasha found the topic interesting enough to be taking notes on, and Steve, Bruce, and Clint asked many question. Tony was just trying not to have yet another panic attack. He came out of his trance when Thor mentioned him.
But this was the something that everybody goes through that changes them—something that becomes the juxtaposition of who they are now and who they were before, and Thor wasn’t immune to it. Thor trusted the genius to see who he is now, and although Tony felt emotionally drained, he did somehow find it honoring to be trusted that way.
“I feel safe when I tinker,” Tony mumbled as his eyes darted around the room as if searching for an answer.
“Hey, Tony, you’re alright! You’re safe. No aliens around, I swear,” Clint said and quickly realized his mistake when Tony flinched at the mention of aliens. “Right, right! No talking about that. Um, god, what should I do? How do I help you?”
Rhodey warned) and walked in through the dimly lit lab. He walked slowly and held his breath in fear of what he might find. He heard sniffs and choked sobs come from a lit corner of the room and saw Tony’s head buried in his hands with his knees pulled to chest. Dum-E was running its clasps through the crying man’s hair, and YOU rested its arm on Tony’s knee for comfort. Butterfingers' whirs were melodious, and Steve himself found the tune soothing.
With a desperate cry, he surged the electricity right over the arc reactor, and let out triumphant cry when a heartbeat echoed into the room, and that lovely shade of blue shone like a beacon of hope. The doctors took over from there yet again as Bruce sobbed in disbelief. He didn’t even process being pushed out of the room and meeting the Avengers’ bloodshot eyes again.
“Yup. He got Natalie Rushman a pretty necklace,” Natasha said as she walked into the communal kitchen where the pair of men were.
Tony watched on with a wide smile on his face as the Captain tried to get himself out of the awkward situation, and he felt his own cheeks heat up when Steve shyly made eye contact with him again.
Steve suggests that they leave to the meeting together, but Tony urges him to go before him and to tell Fury he’s gonna be late.
“Let me guess. You had it sport the abandoned-building look to keep intruders away, huh? ‘Cause gotta say, y’nailed it,” Natasha pointed out.
The floor was designed to look like a field, and he didn’t dare step into the grass when JARVIS told him that it was real. The place smelled of flowers and the windows displayed nothing but a blue, cloudy sky. The dogs who were barking and running around were now running to him and tackled him to the floor. The archer giggled and petted the Golden Retrievers until they wiggled their tails happily and licked at his cheeks. “How did he know? This place looks like heaven!”
The team looked on the scene with a mix of fondness, amusement, and sadness. It didn’t take a genius to realize that Tony’s bots were ultimately created to fill a void in his teenage years and to give him what he has been robbed off. The bots were childish, silly, and friendly; they were everything Tony needed, but didn’t have.
“Alright. There are just two more tapes and—wait. One’s labelled for Howard. The handwriting’s just smeared off a bit. Which one do we watch first?” Clint asked as he held both tapes.
They continued bickering and chatting. Tony would occasionally mutter a few words under his breath as he worked on his tablet. However, Steve could see that Thor seemed troubled, and has been so since he had pulled Tony out of his mental breakdown. He excused himself to go after Thor who went back to his room to change his shirt that Clint has accidentally spilled orange juice all over.
thank you so incredibly much for all the support :') i honestly didn't think ppl would like this fic let alone read it lol
They continued watching on until they finished the season. After that, Tony ran off to the kitchen to grab two pieces of toast. “JARVIS, can you call the Captain up here? Tell him it’s an emergency.”
"Huh," he whispered to himself as he took one book after the other out of the shelf and realized that a box was hidden in there. He took it out, placed it on the floor, opened it, and was met with a bunch of tapes stacked perfectly inside. He was about to close the box and put it right where he found it. It was probably recordings of his father conducting experiments he could care less about. But a particular tape called out to him.
Tony loved when Steve would share with him stories or memories of his past. The soldier somehow looked much younger whenever he spoke of them. “How was she like?” Tony asked, and was all ears when the blonde’s lips naturally curled in a radiant smile as he spoke.
Rhodey nodded once, then stepped in and the doors shut right after. The rest of the team sighed in defeat and left off to their floors.
“Shut the front door! This is so cool!” Bruce exclaimed as Tony carefully placed the triangle piece of glowing metal in an arc reactor. He slid his hand under his tank top to take his poisoning reactor off and exchange it for the new one, and gasped as soon as he felt his heart beat easier than before.
And this is why he had come to hate his solitude. He always asked for it, he couldn't deny that, in fear of being a burden. But he hoped for someone to see right through his perfidious confidence and stay around, to lift the burden off his shoulders for some time until he gains enough strength to carry it again.
“The unlabeled one,” Steve said immediately as he hoped it would display yet another heartwarming footage.
Some of the tapes were labeled, and they only said FOR HOWARD STARK. Steve was the one to pick, and he started off with an unlabeled tape. They all settled in on the same couch, except for Bruce who sat on the floor.
Even his body, his broken soul’s home, was tearing him apart. Somewhere in the back of his mind amid all the screams and sirens, he wondered if he’ll ever find a home.
He made it to his lab and tinkered about. He was weary and sleepy despite the drill in his head that kept him up and drenched in anxiety. He appreciated that the team didn't pressure him into hanging around with them, but now his loneliness was lurking in the shadows behind his eyelids.
Thor has arrived from Asgard. The god walked in on them throwing his usual smile and warm, tight hugs. Something that Tony admired about Thor is that he didn’t hesitate to hug him the same as everybody else, but the genius did notice something unusual about the god, and it wasn’t just the black strand of hair braided into his blonde type.
although i don't receive that many comments, i can't express just how happy i was to read that you guys think this is well written :') thank you and i hope i don't disappoint you.
"I can't wait to love you how you deserve to be loved," Steve whispered. His voice was barely audible for anyone else in the room to hear as he shut his eyes to the sound of steady heartbeats beeping through the monitor.
“I’ll visit you later today, okay? I’m handling the press and everything. Don’t worry, SHIELD’s medical team are helping me keep everything as confidential as possible. The Avengers, too. I’ll see you again. Love you.”
He has a troubled heart, a group of misfits living under his roof, an irrational fear of sexual intimacy, a loyal best friend of many years, mental disorders that hindered his functioning, and a loving, patient partner who he loves with every inch of his fiber. The money of the world couldn’t have spared him the trauma of his past, and it couldn’t have afforded him the company of the great people he’s surrounded with in the present.
He glanced over Natasha’s face and saw her eyes narrow in thought. “Do you, Tony Stark, think that the shit you’ve been through makes you weak?”
“Sir?” JARVIS speaks. “Captain Rogers has been standing outside of your door for the past three hours now. Shall I let him in anytime soon?”
Clint made the first move, and Tony was already grinning mischievously. “No shit. He’s looking at Clint like he’s the world’s biggest idiot.”
Tony wanted to ask. Instead, he asked “Are you guys alright? It feels like something’s off. With you guys.”
Steve should have known better, but he didn’t. A few hours of uncomfortableness would never compare to what Tony went through and continues to go through. So he sat there in front of the TV as his fingers toyed with the tape in his hand, until he finally found it in him to play the rectangle box.
“Love you too, Peps,” he says as he rounds the table to kiss the CEO on her cheek, to which she rolls her eyes again, but with a smile this time around.
“We care, Tin Man,” Hulk’s voice erupted from within the scientist’s throat. “We always care about Tin Man.”
He only ever cared about the media when they broadcasted news on Gulmira, which was evidently getting less to no coverage ever since his last visit to the town. Although it doesn’t help him sleep any better at night, he still felt ease lighten his heart to check in on the town and see the people live better. It does, however, tug at the shrapnels around his flesh to know that they would’ve been living much better if it weren’t for his weapons and his contribution to the US Army propaganda.
“I’m sorry for your loss,” Tony said after a moment of silence. Fury nodded once with a tight grimace. “What was his name?”
“I watch the news, darling. Don’t be silly. I haven’t lost it all yet,” she smiled and playfully punched his shoulder, and he lets out a breathless laugh. “You don’t owe us anything for loving you and you never will. But my darling, I just ask this of you. Don’t let anyone, not even yourself, take away what we have given you. Live on. Carry the weight of your past not as a burden, but as a legacy.” She holds on as tightly as she can to Tony’s hand, and a gasp escapes his lips upon the strength her hands exert. “Don’t waste your life.”
Tony’s concerned eyes continued to inspect every inch of Steve’s face, and when Steve gave a weak smile, he took in his right hand to kiss the soldier’s palm. “You’re not okay, tesoro. How about I take you out, hm?”
Texting didn’t solve the issue, especially when Steve stopped replying at some point due to going undercover. Tony couldn’t sleep for the love of him. The team noticed his behavior and teased him for being such a love bird, which he had replied to with “Pfft, what?! I’m just worried and… I… misshimsomuch…”
She got up from her crouched position on the floor to walk around the grand study room. The bookshelves hid the walls, and dusty books were stacked neatly in them. A book titled in Russian caught the redhead’s attention, and her lithe fingers took it off the shelf to skim through the epilogue before deeming it not up to her taste. As she made her way to return the book to its place, she noticed a piece of cardboard jut out of the empty space. Out of curiosity, she took more books out of the shelf and realized what was hidden behind was a dusty, taped box. She placed the books on the floor to take the box out. Soon, her and Clint were carefully opening the box. “Oh, this is gonna be fun. Guys look what Nat found!”
He takes it further because he wants to and disconnects the kiss to place his mouth on Steve’s neck, who’s eyes droop in a haze of wonder and marvel at just how warm and good—
“Shh, none of that, okay? I love you,” he planted a gentle kiss on the brunet’s jaw. “I love you, I love you, I love you. What you feelin’ up to, sweetheart?”
He drops to the floor as he bites down on his hand to keep from sobbing loudly. Here he was approaching his thirties and still wondering whether Obadiah raped him or not. His broken, filthy mind always loved to tell him that it can’t be rape when he had enjoyed it so much, and not when he became a notorious playboy off it. But a fraction of his mind loved itself enough to point out that he was sixteen, mentally unstable, and almost always drunk and high on drugs until he couldn’t remember his name. And even when Tony wasn’t drunk, Obadiah has memorized and studied Tony’s body enough to know what would instantly give him a hard-on and what wouldn’t, and he always made it his mission to turn Tony into a babbling, pathetic mess.
Steve’s punches have always carried speed, force, and the intent to hurt. His mind, however, always sought after more. It’s why every Wednesday afternoon he sat across a woman with jet black hair who asked too many questions and reported the answers to Tony. It's why the gym was warm and images of the date and time always displayed before him. Because Tony Stark happens to care, but his own mind happens to not. His sweat was cold, his fingertips were cold, his lips were trembling because he felt
“Gosh, this kitchen looks so lovely. Why don’t you install the designs in the kitchen of the tower, Tony?” Bruce asked.
“No. I just need to see her,” Steve said as he shuddered. “I need to know she’s okay. This place... looks like she doesn’t belong here.”
The tape got cut, probably from lack of battery life. And the Avengers sat in an uncomfortable, heavy silence. Steve looked around in a daze. He wasn’t crying. He felt numb. He couldn’t think. His head kept screaming at him that this was all a movie. It wasn’t real, but it was. He looked around to see everyone else look down at their laps in shock, except for Bruce who cornered himself on a couch, his knees drawn up to his chest and his hands in his hair as he rocked himself back and forth trying to contain the beast within him that kept growling “Tony hurt!” over and over again.
"In hand to hand combat, you must train your eyes before your hands. You gotta understand that my hands or whatever weapon I could be holding is only a distraction," she said as Tony set his eyes on her instead of her fisted hands. She gave a satisfied smile and continued. "Your real and true problem is with me, not my fists or whatever weapon I could possess."
Steve stared at the fallen king piece in awe. His jaw was open in shock and he looked up at a smirking Tony who sat on the golden-framed chair like a true king. Steve shook his head in disbelief and chuckled. “Well played.”
“I want you safe and sane and happy. That’s all I truly want. Whatever else comes with that is just a bonus.”
Natasha sees as Tony takes the tape out of the player, throws it into the lit fireplace, and inserts another one. She can’t see his face, but when he sits down, he's slow and careful and he keeps his head low. It’s enough to tell her of what’s going on in his head.
brushes against the boy’s thighs or resting a warm hand on the boy’s chest where his thumb would purposely rub against a nipple into hardness and sensitivity, and Tony’s blood would drench in guilt and shame and absolute pleasure. He would ask—
“No, I like it,” he said with wide, pleading eyes. He didn’t know what it is that he felt around Natasha, but it was warm and cozy with a dash of chaotic. Almost, dare he say, sibling-like. “Good night, Tasha. Sleep well.”
“I talked to Fury. He wanted to let you know that HYDRA tried to attack again. The SHEILD agents handled it well and JARVIS wasn’t hackable this time around. He actually disabled a lot of their weapons. But the place is filled with more bugs now. They’re gonna take longer to debug the tower,” Natasha explained.
“Tony, wake up!” Steve exclaimed with much despair in his voice. Tony finally opened his eyes in wide horror as he sat up and cowered away from the figures in the room. “N-No m-more no m-more n-no more p-please,” he hugged his knees as he rocked back and forth against the couch,
“G-Good morning, Cap. Sorry about that,” Tony muttered as he started rubbing the sleep away from his eyes. Steve’s breath hitched in his throat at the sight before him. His hair is ruffled. His eyes look better rested and it serves his entire face greatly as it brings out the clearness of his skin. His lips are pouted and pink and Steve resists the urge to just as much as trace his fingers over them. His goatee could use a trim, but it compliments his face so well. And when he blinks and turns his head towards a ray of sunshine that has creeped its way in, his left eye falls under it and becomes a beautiful shade of hazel.
A sixth punching bag dislodged out of its hanger, and Steve marched to the next one. He designed them all according to Steve’s strength because he heard the complains about how they never handle his brute or strength and always rip open. Although these bags don’t rip open, they do dislodge, and Tony had promised that he would fix the issue.
There are too many emotions coursing through Tony's veins. All of which overwhelming his senses and dominating his chain of thoughts. It’s dangerous because he knows this is when he gets the most self-destructive, but he can’t help it. He especially can’t help when the most overwhelming emotion of all is anger.
And that’s how he ended up in his lab alone holding onto Dum-E's arm as he cried and cried. What seemed to bother him more than anything was how under constant display he was. He hated the vulnerable state the Avengers seemed to always find him in, because there’s so much more to him than his mental turmoil. He just wanted to be normal or at least free of mental breakdowns for a solid week. Was that truly too much to ask for?
“Behold the talk,” Thor instructed when he heard Natasha and Tony’s footsteps come back holding pillows and blankets. Tony gave everybody their blankets and pillows and threw a Captain America pillow Steve’s way. The genius smiled as he propped next to the Captain, but Steve’s face paled when he recognized that the pillow was featured in one of the tapes.
A few hours passed by with Tony breaking things, putting them back together, lifting off heavy tech, and JARVIS supplying data with whatever is asked of him.
Worst of all, he thought, was that he got put on display yet again. He couldn’t stand the sight of Steve’s sad baby blue eyes. He felt like burning his skin off.
Steve ran to an empty bathroom. He locked himself in an empty stall and fell to his knees as he sobbed. He tried to hold his shuddering frame, but all he could feel was the ghost of Tony’s sleeping body. Alive. Glowing blue. Stirring to chase after comfort. Nuzzling his head into the Captain’s chest. Feeling his heartbeat against him. Beating. Alive. Smiling. Because he always fucking smiled. He was all laughs and giggles just a few hours before he tried to kill himself. He was smiling. He was laughing. He looked okay. He was hurting. He was in pain. He tried to kill himself.
“I could handle that, no worries,” Steve grinned as he wiggled the fingers of his right hand, and Tony rolled his eyes as he jokingly punched at the soldier’s chest.
“He’s probably worried about the tower and what happened to JARVIS,” Bruce suggested as he wandered near the fireplace. There were pictures of Howard and Maria Stark hung above. Young, carefree, and rich. There were multiple pictures of a pregnant Maria Stark in what seemed to be a professional photoshoot. Howard was nowhere to be seen in at least one of these photos.
“Kinda does. My heart feels light...? I can’t tell exactly. Anyway, it works and I’m not getting poisoned, so I guess it’s cool,” Tony shrugged.
The painful reminders of said years stood right above the fireplace where the tapes burned. They were pictures of his parents, young and happy. He could easily admit that he loathes his father, but saying so about his mother felt heavy on his heart. He couldn’t say he loved her, either. After all, you can’t love someone you don’t know. He remembers the last time he has seen her, just a few hours before she left off on the trip to death alongside her husband.
Every step towards that room physically hurt, but he was too angry at himself to let a room scare him so much. So he bolted in and felt the shrapnels tug at his flesh. He walked around slowly and carefully, looked around, and surely found the blanket over the antique chair his father favored so much.
“It doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re gonna fix it. And your gonna fix your issues with the damn government.”
“Don’t worry, Legolas. JARVIS doesn’t tell me if you’re perched up in the vents to plot your pranks or whatever. It’s just during missions.”
“You don’t have to blame yourself. Odin’s ways with your brother are not your fault,” Tony whispered.
And Steve understood all too well where this was coming from, but he couldn’t help but feel the weight of the world and his misery and the dazed face of a touch and attention-starved ten-year-old Tony Stark being told
“Thank you, Tony,” Thor whispered as he smiled back. “You are man not just of iron, but of gold, too. I will never forget this.”
Tony looks inside the box again and notices more fingerprints leaving a clean mark against the dusty rectangular compact boxes. For a solid minute, his body breaks in cold sweat. He reaches for his Stark Smart Phone, and scans over the fingerprints.
Steve’s eyes were narrowed in something foreign—something he didn’t want to associate to the older Stark as he watched the events unfold.
The voices got clearer and clearer; like when his captors in Afghanistan had pulled at his hair to bring him up from the hot water he’d suffocate and choke on, and he’d feel his ears slowly but surely push the muffling water out of his ears, and he is just as confused as he was when he heard those men scream a language he didn’t understand because he can’t make out anything that is being said now. His mind feels dazed and hazy, and his tongue and eyelids feel heavy.
“I missed you too, sweetheart. God, look at you! And look at Steve! Thank you for bringing him over here. And thank you Steve for coming. I thought I'd never see you,” she smiled.
He goes through all the tapes, and the mansion starts smelling of burnt plastic. They are still in place by the entrance of the living room. They peek their heads and watch as the man stares into the big, black screen. A few minutes pass by with him just sat like that, before Natasha takes the first step into approaching the engineer. They don’t bother hiding or pretending they weren’t looking out for him, and he doesn’t seem to be here to mind. His eyes are as unseeing as they were in the last two minutes of the tape during the night before Christmas, and of the tape where Peggy promised to rush Howard’s work contract.
“Yeah, good. I’m keeping his car here. I’ll park it in the garage for him. SHEILD agents are gonna pick me up, if he asks about it,” Happy said with a smile and waved goodbye.
Tony was anticipating some snarky comment come his way from Clint, but the silence of the night fell heavy on his ears. He turned to Clint, who held on to the blanket like he wanted to tear it apart. He looked over Bruce and Thor, and they both wore sad looks. He looked at Steve again, and saw him hold the Captain America pillow tightly to his chest and bury his face in it. That’s not to mention Natasha, who Tony’s mind insisted that right now she is Natalie.
He didn’t have it in him to be cruel to her. He just left her brain make whatever it wanted out of reality, all while holding her wrinkled, lithe hands.
Steve’s heart felt a pang of pain for Peggy, and warm love for Tony. Clearly, this is a man who had frequently visited the old woman and has been incredibly patient with her. To hear him talk of her with so much love and care had made him want to hold Tony’s hand and apologize a hundred times for ever thinking that man was selfish.
Tony didn’t want to talk about it. If anything, he wanted to walk Steve to his room and sleep on his warm chest, hearing the echoes of his heartbeats against his ears, and feel the weight of the world lift off his shoulders as calloused fingers run through his untamed hair. For now, he just grumbled at any mere inconvenience.
he remembers the words of Aunt Peggy and the pat on his shoulders that gave him strength upon the media’s harsh words of him as a teenager, and wishes he could take her away from that house she’s in to keep her with him forever, but he knows she wouldn’t want that, and he doesn’t know if she would be the source of his strength and patience once she starts confusing him for Howard.
“Fast forward to when you are finally old enough to sign shit, the manufacturing started. And Obadiah gave us all the weapons to make up for the money your old man owed us. Such a shame you shut it all down a few years later. Well, not quite as shut down as you thought. Obadiah was nice enough to grant us access to the manufacturing company’s branch in sunny Cali.”
When he growls in frustration, the Captain doesn’t comment, but his shoulders visibly tense. Tony doesn’t understand why or how such little things are getting to him so much. All he understands is that he can’t stop it.
Tony’s hand held onto the rim of the arc reactor as he clicked on its mechanics with his fingernails to detach it. His mind was flooded with panic and dread, but peace was blooming amidst it all.
Steve's heart fluttered as he recognized the voice he was hearing through the big screen. How come Tony never told him he knew her?
“Stark’s acting weird,” Natasha said as she landed heavily on one of the couches in the living room.
“I don’t know what to do,” the Captain whispered frustratingly, and Rhodey gulps down his admittance to that too. Instead, Rhodey guides them both to the round meeting table and finds that Fury’s pacing serves as a great distraction. “So he’s not coming.”
He grabbed the framed picture of his father. Young, smiling, healthy, and rich. He threw it carelessly on the floor and relished in the sound of hearing the glass break. He grabbed another picture and noticed how his hands were the steadiest they’ve ever been since he got here. He smiled, but not before he had broken another picture frame. And another. And another. And another...
“You always get me worried. I never understand you or the reasons behind your actions. And not gonna lie, you are one reckless bastard. But we do need you, Tony.”
Steve held on to the shorter man reeking of alcohol. His hair was disheveled, and his eyes were half-lidded in a drunken haze. He kept moaning miserably as he tripped over his feet but giggled as soon as Steve swept him off the floor bridal style and sat him on his lap on the couch. The rest of the team held their breath as they watched the man giggle to himself in the Captain’s lap.
"Mhmm," Tony hummed as his eyes closed. He opened them with much struggle to address the Captain one more time. "Read out loud for me. Doesn't matter what part," he slurred and rested his head against his folded arms.
“Inception,” Rhodey answered and tossed a pillow Natasha’s way. They were all moving around with tasks to get this night right, except for Steve who paced around with worry.
Tony stirred again and rested his head against a tube that was wired to the monitors from one end and the arc reactor from the other. "That's not good. Try to get the tube away from his head," Bruce instructed.
When they reached the communal kitchen, Tony hopped off Rhodey’s back and squeezed himself between Clint and Bruce as they cooked traditional Italian food and looked at the two as though they were not real. “You guys cooked my favorite food?”
“Steve?” Tony whispered as he knelt before him. Steve suppressed a gasp when Tony’s hands cupped his cheeks. His hands felt sweaty and warm,
“My point is, if you wanna celebrate, go ahead. Tony won’t stop you and he wouldn’t want you not to do whatever you want. He just won’t be a part of it. And you could ask Tony himself,” Rhodey shurgged.
“I’ll tell you what, Hannah Montana, we go a round against each other right after dinner. If you win, you’re granted your wish. I win, you don’t get shit.”
He tried to speak, but his tongue felt so heavy. Then he recalled that dead people can’t really speak,
“Nope. Nah-uh. Absolutely not. We do have to do this,” Clint said. “You deserve to hear a proper apology. We never really gave you one. We just kicked the ice cubes under the fridge. But we’re gonna do better. Because we have become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability. We’re shutting that down.”
The light got blindingly bright before it dimmed down quickly, but a small triangle kept its bright glow. Tony threw his glasses aside as he approached the glowing object, the four people in the room following him closely by to sneak a curious look.
“N’tasha?” Tony hiccuped as he lifted his head enough to peak his eyes through. He blinked the tears away to get a better view of the redhead before him.
“You’re warm,” Tony slurred yet again as Steve leaned over to take the drunk man’s shoes off for him. Tony giggled as he wiggled his socked feet and nuzzled his head against Steve’s chest. Steve couldn’t help but giggle too. It was contagious.
Steve watched on amusedly as the pair engaged in harmless combat, and it seemed like Tony was holding up well to it all. He smiled proudly whenever Tony landed a kick or a punch to the redhead or whenever he deflected her attempts of attack.
Steve could hear steady thuds from his room, but he mistook it for the throb in his head. However, the thuds grew louder and quicker, and they were accompanied by pained grunts.
“Oh my god, that’s hilarious,” he said in between laughs. “Have I ever told you that in my mind you are always Natalie? I used to feel so bad for thinking that, but now I'm patting my intuition’s back.”
“Oh no, you won’t get lucky,” Rhodey said from across the room. “Trust me, I gave up on winning against that bastard a long time ago.”
And it’s hard. It's hard to come face to face with you after all those years and be constantly arguing with you and for his words to not ring a bell. I’m always anticipating it. I'm always anticipating you ramming your shield straight through this thing and shutting it down for good,” he pointed to the arc reactor, and Steve shuddered. “It’s wrong. Because you are not like that. You are good. Talking to you for just the few minutes we would have before an argument breaks out makes me feel good. Learning new things about you outside of the bedtime stories Aunt Peggy used to tell me or the history books I read or all the things he’s told me... is good,” Tony feels
“The day his parents died...” Natasha whispered. Clint, Thor, and Bruce perked up in concern in their seats.
“Nope. No celebrations. Just coffee,” Tony muttered as his eyes drooped. He really was incredibly sleepy and weary, and a pounding headache was taking over. He took a seat on a stool by the kitchen counter and slumped against it. He would never admit to this to the team, but he did feel immensely grateful that they had stayed while he created his permanent fix of the arc reactor. After all, the concept in itself had reminded him of the sleepless nights he spent alongside Yinsen in the hot, humid cave building the device. It’s why he had avoided looking for any other solutions until now.
“And I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that. It... it wasn’t your fault. You’re good. Pure. You’re... not what he made you out to be. But that’s all I've thought of you. It’s... what I’m struggling not to think of you right now. I’m sorry. But there will be none of those thoughts. None of those struggles anymore. You deserve much better.”
“You are not the strongest man alive, that much is true,” JARVIS voice chimed in, and Tony fell to his knees by Dum-E's side. “But Sir, I have watched you work and fight and sacrifice so much of yourself and time for what you believed in. No matter how much I urged you to stop for a break, you didn’t. Nothing and no one could stop you. Not the panic attacks, not the nightmares, not the Avengers’ harsh words, not aliens. This, Sir, is formidability. You are formidable. Don’t—”
Tony watched in stunned silence as videos of Stark Industries missiles bombed poor cities, villages, and “Gulmira,” he whispered as he saw dead bodies get carried out of rubble and debris.
If they hadn’t watched those tapes, they wouldn’t have treated him like this. If they hadn’t known, they wouldn’t have excused his behavior instead of insulting him. If they hadn’t watched him breakdown, they wouldn’t have considered him human.
Steve’s eyes were on Tony’s face the whole time as he spoke, and he couldn’t comprehend how someone as hurt as Tony could simply think of someone else’s feelings as a motive to heal not for the sake of healing, but for the sake of being better to that someone.
A beautiful hometown that would’ve prospered if it weren’t for the debt a dead man left him off to pay.
Steve sighed heavily as he ran out of photos to look through and got up to see what Clint and Natasha were rummaging through. He decided he would ask Tony upon his return if he could keep a few pictures. However, judging from the box Natasha discovered, he still had a box of tapes to watch. “Is there a tape player in this place?”
Steve glanced over to Tony who grimaced before plastering on a paparazzi smile. “Told you I'd do it, Peg.”
Rhodey gave the Avengers his code of access to the lab. Although he was staying around in the tower to keep a close eye on his friend, he knew that the genius is as spontaneous as ever, and if Rhodey isn’t fast enough, surely someone else would be. He also told Bruce of Tony’s condition, and with the help of JARVIS, they came to the conclusion that Tony’s suffering palladium poisoning. “Unfortunately, the only thing that’s keeping Sir alive is also killing him,” JARVIS said.
Natasha shrugged. “I think you’re pretty cool. You’re hella smart, a bastard at times, and fun to be around. Your sense of humor is the best and your sense of fashion is impeccable. And you’re so damn competitive and stubborn, it gives me headaches.”
“Sir has designed this place according to your love for dogs and nature. You may change the atmosphere and the landscapes the windows may display for you. The vents have also been made bigger and redesigned,” JARVIS said as he opened the vents up to display its interior design. “Sir describes it as ‘chilling on the clouds.’”
“He w-was d-dead. He—” Bruce sobbed again as he fell into a sobbing Rhodey’s arms. “I-I’ll n-never get th-that out of m-my head. He was... He w-was announced d-dead.”
Something in the back of his mind shifted to the forefront, and its voice increased in volume. He chased after it, and found strength in wearing its collar as he obeyed the command it gave, but not before hearing screams and shouts for his name as he cut through his palms and watched the blood pour over the expensive, soft fabric. The white wool looked much prettier as it absorbed his shade of crimson red, and the gold frame of the seat sure did look elegant, but with droplets of blood cascading down its curves, it looked extravagant.
As if by some miracle, Fury called him to tell him that he’s needed in the tower. “We found a few bugs and disabled them, but we want you here to figure out the codes and technology of it all. JARVIS is refusing to answer to us. Apparently, your bot is too paranoid that someone will hack into it again. Keeps saying it’ll only answer to you.”
They went through more and more tapes, and they weren’t that different. More beatings, more insults, more comparisons and references to Steve, more visits from Peggy, Tony caving in on himself more and more with every tape, and Jarvis trying to hold the broken boy together. In one particular tape, Howard has beaten up a fourteen-year-old Tony to a literal pulp for being sent a letter from the school for talking back to a teacher. Tony was halfway through explaining that the teacher was taunting him and had humiliated him in front of his class but was immediately shut down with punches and kicks until he was left on the floor of Howard’s study room bloody and crying silently. The teenager took a few minutes to get up successfully after and limped his way out of his father’s space.
"My friend, they know you for putting a stop to the Chitauries. The army has been terrorizing tribes of different realms for centuries, and the people of Alfheim fell victims to them, but no more! All thanks to your act of bravery, which they now tell stories of!"
He eats the food with much gratitude and suppresses the tears dire to roll down his cheeks. All he can think of is that he doesn’t deserve this. He doesn’t deserve the warm, simple food or the breeze hitting his face that feels like gentle kisses atop his skin.
) in an inquisitive manner upon the presence of the Captain. Dum-E tilted its arm down as if to look at its sleeping creator in the Captain’s arms and started whirring fondly before walking away towards the coffee machine. Steve’s brows were raised to the roof as he watched the bot prepare a cup of coffee and whir frustratingly when YOU accidentally poured motor oil in the mug. YOU lowered its arm in shame and whirred sadly, and Dum-E started the coffee machine again upon bringing another mug.
Tony did relish in being wanted and for his presence to be requested for something beyond meetings and missions, but for the purpose of being a source of enjoyment to someone’s time in such an innocent way.
And here it comes: the admittance of just how much power Steve has grown to have over him. He whispered, “Because I’m petrified of losing him.”
He grabbed a large glass shard to rip the satin off the antique furniture. A surge of energy shot through his body with every piece of this place that he ruined. A part of him liked to believe that he was avenging his childhood and youth, that he was ruining this place just as much as it has ruined him.
“You still drinking, right? I mean, we saw the pictures. What happened to you publicly stating that you’re quitting that stuff for good?”
THERE WERE NO WOMEN WHERE HE WAS. YOUR VOICE WOULD MOST PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SNAP HIM BACK TO REALITY.
At that, Natasha glanced over at the Captain who had looked absolutely wrecked; because of course Steve didn't know much about Tony other than catching glimpses of a few acts he took as the man outside of the egoistic persona that he wore as easily as his armor, but it was enough for him to develop a crush. Steve could easily admit that Tony is quite a handsome man. He has the prettiest eyes Steve's ever seen, a gorgeous smile he didn't blame the population for swooning over, and a lean, muscular body he couldn't help but stare at sometimes. His looks, however, were just a bonus and he did feel optimistic enough to look forward to learning more about the brunet outside of the internet and the media (
But the answer never came. Instead, Tony had lifted his head to stare into the baby blue eyes, and then got up to stand right in front of the soldier. He never broke eye contact as he cupped Steve’s soft porcelain cheek and ran his thumb over the delicate skin. Steve’s breath hitched in his throat, and he didn’t dare move. Tony’s fingertips were soft and gentle against his skin. Both his hands came to gently cup his neck, run against the skin there until goosebumps emerged on the surface of the soldier’s skin, and continue to run down further and further until Steve’s blood ran cold as Tony got on his knees.
Tony rolled his eyes but blushed anyway. She bent down to his level to peck his cheek, and he closed his eyes to relish in the gentleness of it. “Good night, Antoshka.”
They walked around the field as they talked and joked around and laughed until their hearts felt full. Steve saw as Tony’s chocolate brown eyes became pools of honey under the sun, and although the man stood amid flowers of all colors and types, he remained the most beautiful creature among them all.
“I’ll... be here. Okay?” Steve says as he sits on a bench. There’s visible distance between them that the Captain intentionally puts, and Tony’s confused, sick brain can’t help but think that the blonde must be disgusted with him. A sane part of his mind understands the Captain’s intentions of respecting his boundaries, but then the irrational part of his brain, which Tony favors most of the time, is screaming at him that he’s being treated like a weak victim.
“She asked why I finally agreed to therapy. Why now,” he mumbled as he started pushing around crumbs of cake with his fork. He refused to meet the soldier’s eyes. “I told her that I actually wanna be better and do better. I wanna... wanna be good. For you. And to you,” he whispered those last few words too lowly for his ears to hear, but Steve’s been too attentive not to hear them. “I wanna reciprocate what you have for me because I have it too, I just... I always have those memories... and those other feelings. Scared, paranoid, angry... you don’t deserve to be around someone who feels those things around you.”
They watched through the labelled tapes, which Steve was right about. They all came from kidnappers who demanded money. One of these tapes, however, displayed a teenage Tony knocking the kidnapper out and taking a hold of the camera to smirk and say
“Shit’s fucked up!” Clint threw his hands in the air in defeat when he lost his third round of chess against Tony, who just stuck his tongue out at the archer when he accused him of cheating. “I’m a genius. Duh.”
“Woah, so you knew of Man of Iron’s father on a personal level? I thought it was only a matter of business,” Thor asked.
The brunet rolled his eyes again and threw a pillow at the soldier. “M’not cute! And I don’t blush!”
“Did... did Nick Fury just say he’s sorry?” Tony’s jaw hung open as he whispered his disbelief. Fury rolled his eye and smirked. “Don’t make me regret it.”
Bruce held onto Tony tightly as he nuzzled his head against his neck and cried. Natasha held her breath as she anticipated Bruce doing the wrong move of telling Tony about everything that they now know about him. She looked over to Steve, Thor, and Clint, who were all seated on a large lounging chair next to the bed, and they seemed to share her same unspoken concern.
Somehow, paparazzi caught onto them and chased after the car. Tony noticed. “Might as well get it over with,” he muttered under his breath and pulled out his signature obnoxious sunglasses from his jacket when the cameras approached as he stopped at a red traffic light.
He looks to himself in the mirror and sees Tony Stark: genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
But Rhodey, the only human being who knows about this, wasn’t here and Tony was losing his mind again. He couldn’t move. He was frozen in the narrow and bleak hallways of the mansion that seemed to know no end, and his mind was screaming at him not to have a mental breakdown now.
“This is horrible,” Bruce said as he hugged his knees to his chest. “He was so scared. He looked like he was having a panic attack. Gosh, he was four. He was only four.”
“Anthony Edward Stark thank fuck you have finally decided to pick up the phone!” She exclaimed angrily. He rolled his eyes and pointed to the ceiling. “See what I gotta deal with?”
“But he doesn’t know that we know,” Steve said. “Thor did... magic... and saw what Tony was recalling.”
Her face brightened with a smile as she extended her arms. “Anthony. Oh my god, Anthony, my love. My precious boy. Come here!” He walked over to her and fell into her open arms. He nuzzled his head into her neck and took in her ever-comforting scent one last time. “Hey, Auntie. I missed you so much.” He pulled away after a few minutes of pure bliss in the form of a hug and took a seat next to her bed.
“You don’t wanna be. Please Tony. Please don’t…” the words hung in the air for a solid minute, but Steve has had enough of not saying what he wasn’t comfortable with, because what he wasn’t comfortable with was often the reality of things. “Please don’t kill yourself.”
Tony looked around the beautiful mess that is his lab. “I’m gonna miss you,” he whispered as his hand traced around the diameter of the arc reactor.
“—chant of Death. He had publicly stated on the very same day he had returned from Afghanistan that all of his weapon manufacturing companies would shut down for good. So it is extremely bizarre to see all those missiles launch straight from his California manufacturing branch. Is this a man we could really trust?” A reporter said through the large screen.
He resisted the urge to slap himself right across the face as hard as he could. Instead, he got up to wash away the cum on his hands and the tears on his cheeks, but couldn’t quite wash away the guilt and misery smothering his heart.
“This is extravagant! My dearest gratitude and appreciation for such lovely surprise,” the god smiled as he placed firm, gentle hands by the brunet’s shoulders. “You have been a great friend, Man of Iron. This lovely surprise was much needed. Thank you.”
“That’s because he is,” Tony said and made his move. Clint scoffed and made yet another move. “I’ll have you know I am one of SHIELD’s most favored assassins and an excellent spy.”
Bruce finally calmed down enough to mumble a “Thank you, Tony,” to which the engineer smiled widely (
“We wanna plant these trees,” Natasha says and points to the tall trees put in large glass containers behind her. “You don’t have to do this alone.”
“Seeing as you guys are so enthusiastic and passionate about this, I take it you would be so enthusiastic about helping me in the kitchen,” Bruce said.
He talked and talked, and often engaged in various therapeutic exercises. Some worked in his favor, like the breathing and drawing exercises—which always ended up with him sketching robots alongside Steve and often making paper airplanes to fly towards Natasha with the message
Steve’s hands yearn to touch him, his throat itches to say what he has been told not to say, and his eyes want to cry in anger and despair.
“You guys are a pain in the ass,” Tony said as he made a move, and Steve nods in agreement and makes his own move, to which Bruce hums in amusement. “Good move, Steve.”
“In all my glory,” Tony smirked and took a seat as head of the table. On either side were Rhodey and Steve, who Tony longed for resting his head on his warm chest again.
the next chapter might come a bit late. i have everything planned out, but im struggling to make the ideas flow well. feedback is appreciated and very much needed. please let me know of things you would like to see, and maybe they'll flow well enough with what im trying to accomplish!
“Watch him get kicked out of the competition in a few minutes because he’s such a fucking idiot!” Clint yelled shortly after.
"It was normal enough for it to become a routine. For it to become all I expect out of you," Tony said as his eyes drooped with exhaustion. "But I don't care. I want it back. It was better. I was better. I was useful. There was no pity or treating me like I'm small. I want that back."
Tony naturally found himself taking a seat next to Thor, who appeared to be holding tears in his blue-green eyes. “He wasn’t allowed to walk through her funeral. Odin knew of how much he loved her. He still didn’t allow him. Only then did I see...”
She smirked and pulled the hood over her head. “They’re super-duper comfy and I look much better in them, duh.”
“But you were thinking it and you’re thinking of it right fucking now!” Tony’s full on yelling at this point, and it’s too late for him to contain himself now. The lava’s just eating through whatever it’s running against.
“Sore loser,” she muttered as she stuck her tongue out at the genius, who simply scrunched his face and stuck his tongue back at her. Steve watched on with amusement as they lightheartedly argued over who’s the MVP of virtual basketball for a solid fifteen minutes, before Tony had to eventually focus on soldering wires together.
Two more days until he can happily hop his way out of this prison in luxurious disguise. Two more days until he can go to his bots and his precious JARVIS and his haven of a lab and not come out of it until the world is in shambles. Two more days and he’ll drink as much coffee as he wants instead of shoving one sleeping pill after the other just so he could sleep the days away. Two more days and he’ll be able to have his mental breakdowns and practice his self-destructive and borderline suicidal tendencies without worrying about the team witnessing it.
Tony nearly gasped at the sight of the God of Thunder’s tears rolling down right before his eyes. All he ever saw on the God’s face were either smiles or wrath upon enemies.
The Avengers let out a gasp as it happened, except for Steve whose heart silently dropped to his feet.
"I'm sorry, Tony. I'm sorry I never saw the good in you. I'm sorry I let my training and work get in the way of building a genuine friendship with you. I'm sorry," Natasha started, and Tony was taken aback at the genuine emotions her emerald eyes exerted. He nodded awkwardly in acknowledgment and shifted his eyes towards the next speaker: Clint, yet again.
In his mind, the fire was still out of reach. Sure, there was sharp heat fanning over his face, but he was yet to burn, so he stretched out his arms further.
After half an hour of just trying to get a grip, he decided to walk into the communal kitchen for a cup of coffee. It was three AM, and he didn’t expect anyone to be awake, but when JARVIS alerted him that Bruce was there, he instantly felt better. He won’t be alone.
Steve read the room, and he attempted to make himself appear smaller by hunching his shoulders and sitting on the floor across the genius, who instantly felt much better when his neck didn’t have to crane to look at the Captain.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony waved a hand and finished his cereal. “Bruce, you feeling better, honey bear?”
Tony resisted the urge to nuzzle his head against the man's chest, and even if he didn't, he was sure that his brain was bound to mess with him in more ways than one by reminding him of how much larger Steve is compared to him, how much stronger, how much faster, how he could pin Tony down, how he could be brutal, how he could—
“Longest two days of my fucking life,” he muttered when he saw the calendar on his way to the tower from a headache inducing meeting.
“Shame,” the man shook his head. “I’ve been in bed with you far more than I have with my own wife. And you still don’t remember me?”
He blasted AC/DC and hummed along to the tunes. He stopped by a sushi restaurant and sure enough got Pepper a platter of her favorite food. They all exchanged looks of confusion and discomfort, except for Natasha who has seen this before. Still, it raised a question they didn’t quite know the answer of. Is this how Tony Stark... is?
But he had looked so happy playing chess with them, even if the matches got redundant. He had looked so happy watching Thor and Bruce fall victims under Clint and Natasha’s prank. He had looked so happy whenever Steve interacted with him and threw nothing but smiles the Captain’s way to prove it.
Tony took time to progress that. He was flattered, but he felt his shoulders sag under the weight of his shame and self-hatred. Here he was trying not to panic over simply stargazing and trying not to lose his mind over recalling childhood memories.
Steve was about to open his mouth to express how thankful he is for the amount of thought Tony puts into their gear and weapons to ensure the team’s safety, but Clint beat him to it by asking a question.
The night was quite calm and content. They ate the food Rhodey had made with the help of Bruce and talked about random things. When Tony asked about Thor, they told him he has gone off to Asgard yet again. He doesn’t like when the god leaves the tower, but he knows the blonde prince must have other important matters to attend to and feels a sense of honor upon recalling that the tower is a place the god could always safely reside in upon his arrival.
