“I made an elephant,” Steve said with great dignity, and shoved the crumpled purple elephant at Tony. “See?”
Thinking of the two Steves as separate people was also neater and easier than having to think about what this all meant. After all, if there were two Steves, then he was perfectly within his rights to prioritise the rights and welfare of the child.
“I need a copy of all the data you have,” he said, and Barnes nodded. “Everything, Barnes. I’ve had enough of this cherry-picking.”
Barnes looked away and said nothing.
Wait. “Wait,” Tony said. He flicked back to the earlier set of data in his data pack, comparing. “Wait, hold on.” He found it. “The spike in the radiation levels. Doesn’t that seem...”
Comments make me indescribably happy.
Tony glanced up, surprised at the emotion there. T’Challa had said that the Wakandan group had dispersed pretty early on, but he hadn’t expected Wilson to be one of them, or to be on the outs with Rogers. If that was what it was, of course; Wilson certainly seemed to have a lot of emotion going on there, but it was difficult to read what exactly had him so wired up. Probably seeing Rogers as a kid wasn’t helping any, but Tony doubted this was the reason for why Wilson seemed to be the most hostile of the lot of them, given everything. He’d somehow expected Barton to be the one out for blood.
He thought about taking her hand in his. (Felt the chill down his back at the thought.) He leaned back in his chair instead. “I just wanted to keep you safe.” It sounded like a confession.
Tony swallowed down the instinctive protest. He reached out a hand and wrapped it around Rhodey’s, rubbing at the cold skin. “So tell me.”
Had he bothered to explain to him what was happening? No. He’d just carted him around half of Wakanda. No wonder the kid was anxious.
He was in Malibu, and Pep was unmoving on the floor of the house as it slid into the ocean -
“That woman hates me,” Tony muttered.
Tony inched forward a little bit again.
“And the surgery?” He’d had the updates, of course, and Rhodey was quite clearly out of hospital and back in a normal bed, but that wasn’t quite the same thing as hearing it from the horse’s mouth, so to speak. He studied Rhodey carefully. There were signs of fatigue, of course, which was to be expected. And he’d lost weight he couldn’t really afford to lose. But he was only a few days out of major surgery, and he was quite clearly moving about at least as easily as he had been when Tony had seen him last. But, of course, that didn’t mean that the surgery had achieved all it had been intended to. “How’s… everything?”
Bad enough that Barnes chose this as a bonding moment, all Tony needed was Steve thinking he would be part of the fight. “That’s enough out of you. You don’t get to have an opinion until you’re taller than my shoulders. Come on, let’s get you ready.” With a bit of help from Steve, he managed to get the child into the large coat that Dhakiya had sent and zipped him up firmly, making sure that the Kevlar inserts were properly positioned over his back and front.
“He’s fine.” Was it Tony’s imagination, or did Vision sound a little… off? “When will you be back?”
. He's not bitter; he can't help feeling just a teensy bit impressed.
Tony thought, but did not say. An awful lot of the team’s success had hinged on blind luck in the past; he could only hope that it wouldn’t abruptly run short. He cleared his throat and tried to focus. “OK, so Interpol got into it. Then what?”
been Barton making it.
She looked a little discomforted at M’Baku’s scrutiny, but at Dr Foster’s encouraging look she nodded. A screen unfolded between her and Dr Foster, their calculations spooling out across it. It was pretty much what Tony had expected - a whole lot of work on the radiation from the portals - but there was something else in there. Tony squinted at the notes on the bottom right, which seemed to be a little… odd.
“He knows.” She smiled a little. “And believe it or not, I didn’t need anyone to tell me how you’d react. You’re pretty easy to read when it comes to him.”
Her smile got a little wider. “A pleasure to meet you, Colonel. Dr Stark, if you and your ward are ready, I will escort you to your quarters.”
, no.)
He planted himself in front of his tablet and managed an approximation of his usual ‘investors’ stance - shoulders back, limbs loose, big smile - before tapping the ‘accept call’ button. ("Always take important calls on your feet, Tony," Obie had used to say, back when Tony had been learning the ropes. "It makes you more alert. It also prompts people not to waste your time."
For all of Barton’s carping on the subject, the obligatory ‘goodbye’ gathering was actually fairly small. Sam and Rhodey were still in Birnin Zana, due to return back with Vision in the next few hours (once Tony and Steve were safely out of range). Barnes and Barton were of course accompanying them to the US and were already in the plane, double-checking they were ready for lift-off. Okoye was the only Wakandan present; T’Challa and M’Baku presumably busy doing whatever it was the Wakandan aristocracy did in the middle of the day.
There had been a lot of shouting. T’Challa had kept order, and M’Baku had mostly disagreed with everyone, and Shuri had eventually conferenced in and had been
he thought, staring at the sleeping face. He could take the child, and he could...
This chapter just wouldn't come. :/ I'd originally planned to start on the whole Tony & Wanda relationship a bit later on, but quickly came to realise that in Tony's current state, he wouldn't let her anywhere near Steve. So we'd have to go through some of those issues before anything could move on. (Of course, saying it and having it be resolved are two very different things; it's good that they've opened lines of dialogue, but there's very little trust there.) I know that a lot of people don't like Wanda, and believe that as she is an adult, she should be treated as such. I do agree to some extent, but I'm very conscious of how erratic my own reasoning was in my late teens/early twenties, and that was
? For God’s sake, how often do I have to do that before he passes me? Any more repeats and I’m gonna start wondering if the interest is purely professional!”
Yup, he was in hell.
There was definitely something there. Tony made a mental note to watch out for any sorcerers and wizards when he was back in New York, if they were running some sort of holy place right under his nose. Not that he’d be able to necessarily spot them, of course, if they were anything like Mordo, of course, but - well, if they were anything like Mordo, the body count would likely give them away.
Well… if it meant he’d take care of Rhodey, Tony wasn’t going to pretend to be anything other than relieved. He didn’t know Wilson, hadn’t spent any time with the man. Hadn’t even traded much in the way of pleasantries with him, before it all kicked off. He wasn’t going to lose any sleep over Wilson’s prior traumas, as long as they didn’t make things worse for Rhodey.
There was an awkward silence.
“That okay?”
Okoye and Barnes set off to meet with T’Challa upon arrival. “He will consider what must be done,” Okoye said. “It is late, and there is nothing to be done right now. We shall talk more in the morning. Rest while you can.”
Rhodey shrugged. “The same the world over, it turns out.” He looked across the room to where Wilson had busied himself fetching three cups of coffee. A small smile touched Rhodey’s face as he watched Wilson set a cup beside Tony’s papers.
Wanda, of course, wasn’t wearing her bracelet (it was tucked into Okoye’s belt). “And how do the ‘precautions’ feel about that?”
Correction: he was already in hell.
he thought, but did not let it reach his face.
’ll be there,” Pepper said, rolling her eyes, as if Tony was being even more ridiculous than usual.
“Then it is lucky that it is not for sale,” Mordo said, just as sharply. “Hundreds of my compatriots lost their lives in fighting Dormammu and his followers, and all because our
had turned out. “Fri? You’re scaring me.”
“Taking him across international borders as your legal ward,” Pepper finished faintly. She still hadn’t taken her hand away from her mouth. Her eyes were very wide. “I - I don’t know where to start, Tony.”
They weren’t anywhere near the top of his list.
“Well, this is very nice and not at all terrifying,” Tony said in the sudden silence, looking around with frank curiosity. “Training for something, are we?”
Tony could take him back to the US, could put Steve in school, could see Pepper and Happy, could check on Peter and Harley, could make sure that everything at SI hadn’t caught on fire while he’d been hiding in a cave (again)...
, from his majesty.”
!” Steve slumped against Tony, clearly exhausted from his spirited re-telling of the Great Zoo Trip.
Tony had bigger priorities to deal with.
Steve gulped in air, wet and pained-sounding, and twisted in Tony’s arms to bury his face against Tony’s shoulder. “‘M sorry, I didn’t mean to be a bother, I tried to be quiet, I‘m sorry -”
Tony felt his breath catch. “His lungs -” He wasn’t intubated, at least, but...
Which was all fine, except for one large problem that had just been slipped in there, sight unseen. “Wait,
Well,
“Of course.
“Er… aren’t you forgetting something?”
Kudos to all those who figured out that Tony being out of the loop was odd/deliberate/both. And yeah, I figured that, on paper, the 'let's trap the bad guy by dangling some bait!' plan would look good, but you stick a kid in there, and all of a sudden it sounds less appealing. That said, Tony and Clint are the only two Avengers who are looking at Steve and seeing him as a child separate from the adult, rather than just a pint-sized version of Steve to be restored to adulthood immediately. Hands up who thinks this will cause problems further down the road? (Yup.)
Barton looked away. “Not really.”
“Yeah,” he said, hearing the disbelief in his voice. “Sure.”
Pepper’s briefing pack had been crystal clear that the ‘secret love child’ story would be enforced from day one, in all conversations that could possibly be overheard. That pretty much meant everywhere except the secure housing set up for them, and vehicles were more vulnerable than most other locations. The driver had put up the limo’s privacy screen, of course, but that meant nothing. Not even Pepper could guarantee that every vehicle, room and public space they went to wouldn’t be riddled with bugs and surveillance equipment, so ‘secret love child’ it was. Tony only hoped that Steve would remain conked out from the journey until he could explain it to him.
He marched out, barely able to keep a hold of his temper until he made it back inside the control room. “Goddamnit!” He slammed his fist into the table. Predictably, it buckled under the force of a gauntleted blow.
He closed his eyes, breathing out slowly.
“Yes, ma’am. Don’t worry, I’ll keep an eye on them.” He squeezed Tony’s knee again.
“There is no one else,” T’Challa said. He looked away briefly, looking troubled. “Mr Barnes has elected to go back into cryogenic suspension. And Ms Maximoff would attract too much attention if she leaves Wakanda.”
Steve’s voice said from all around him, quiet and sad, and Tony closed his hand tight over the pebble, his breath coming hard.
were two very different things. And Tony was not going to put down roots here while the rest of the team(s?) went traipsing around the world to track down Dumbledore.
An hour out from Hong Kong International, he switched seats with Wanda.
"She has attempted to reach out to the Captain, but she cannot find him. Either he is out of range, or something is blocking her." T'Challa took a deep breath. "The Captain - I believe he sent you a way to contact him should you have need of him. I regret that I must ask first, on his behalf. Will you help?"
Romanoff came to collected him about twenty minutes later. Tony hastily extricated himself from the suddenly frantic Steve - repeating his promise to come back straight after the meeting, and to bring Barnes with him - and followed her, hurriedly throwing on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt to replace his fetching open-backed gown. (The hospital didn’t kick up a fuss about him leaving, which just made him suspect that neither he nor Steve were technically registered. T’Challa would probably not want any paper trail of their visit.)
he thought, in unconscious echo of Lang’s earlier comments. All of a sudden, he was uncomfortably aware of how pale-faced Barton was.
4am. Even royalty couldn’t expect you to be perfectly coiffed in the middle of the night with 30 seconds’ notice. It would do.
There was a short silence while Rhodey stared at Tony and Tony stared at his feet.
Rhodey’s hand landed on his thigh under the table, squeezing gently. “Easy,” he murmured quietly.
Tony bared his teeth at Mordo. “Lucy, looks like you’ve got some ‘splainin’ to do.” He stepped around them, visibly disregarding them both, and let himself into the still-cloaked jet.
But whether the truth of it, it was obvious that the Mind Stone was the key to it. It was fairly clear that it had allowed the temporary connection between Steve’s two states - Vision’s proximity being the only differing factor to the previous attacks - but that did not mean that they knew what would come next. Would it only happen if Vision was nearby; if so, what did ‘nearby’ equate to? And what if that connection wasn’t the equivalent of a conductor between two separate states, easily remedied by removing the child from Vision; what if it was a wrench turning a tap instead - small drips at first, but continuing drop by drop until there was a torrent? How would they cope with that?
, as if Tony is some helpless thing cowering in a corner, instead of glaring at him in his own fucking workshop.
Mordo had said, but he did not view Steve as a child and there were plenty of ways Steve could be hurt that would not involve Mordo inflicting the pain himself. And if the alternative was worse, if the consequences of Umar winning were so dire, did what Mordo had planned still count as ‘hurt’? Or was it, in the basest sense of the term, an act of mercy?
That drew a startled laugh out of Mordo, and a snort from Okoye. “As I said. My apology is quite genuine. My sole intention is stopping Umar; I have no quarrel with you or yours, Mr Stark. I do not do this for fun. I do it because it is necessary, and because to
“You said to stay put
Tony thought uneasily to the book placed carefully in amidst the child’s other belongings, and to what the drawing might mean.
. . . Well, it was tempting. But he’d draw more cattiness if he got
As Steve reached down to undo Tony’s belt, he wondered if it was actually getting a little too warm.
“With pleasure.” She gave them all a lethal smile.
(Oh. Right.) Tony’s guts gave a little twist. (Shit.)
After twenty minutes of suggestions, however, Mrs. Rhodes finally said, “I’ve always liked
“Hey, Tony? You hungry?” Rhodey called from the doorway. “Steve and I are gonna hit up Ray’s—wanna come?”
“Wow,” Clint said. “Uh, tell me how you really feel.” Tony glared and opened his mouth again, but Clint held his hands up in surrender. “No, no—point taken! I hadn’t really noticed that, but yeah. Ok. I see what you mean.” He paused. “So, maybe I should join you for some
Tony whipped around to look at him, startled. (He’d been expecting Romanoff to translate.)
His mouth quirked. “Pep telling tales? Or are you still in contact with -” with Romanoff, he almost said without thinking, but caught himself in time. “With Rushman?”
“FRIDAY. We’re going to be heading back to the US in a little bit. I need you to do some digging for me in the meantime.” The suit was already in the jet, and FRIDAY would be able to speak to her main presence through it. With any luck, she’d have most of this sorted out for him before they even lifted off. Tony had already alluded to some of this with Pepper, and between her precautions and T’Challa’s influence, he hoped that this would be enough to stall anything Ross might throw his way if he ever got wind of there being something odd about Steve. But he didn’t want Wakanda to be his only option if things went wrong. T’Challa had created the paper record for Steve, and if T’Challa changed his mind for any reason… He looked back at the closed bathroom door. “I want a third country option if things don’t work out back home. And - some thoughts on how to make sure any fall-out doesn’t hit Stark Industries if Ross decides to go nuclear.” He sincerely hoped it would never come to that, but it never hurt to be prepared.
is the Master of the Hong Kong Sanctum and was killed and then un-killed in Doctor Strange.
Rhodey took pity on him. “Yeah, he’s been pretty wiped out, so he’s sleeping now. ”
; it should have been a prayer. Liminality was where the devil waited.
Tony looked back at Steve again. He’d burrowed down into the suit so that only the top of his head was visible. The suit was still in sentry mode, the arms extended and the repulsors powered up. And now that he had the main system up and running, he could probably keep an eye on whether anyone was returning. “Should be okay.” But… “Once we’re out of here, we’ll need to contact the authorities,” he admitted. “Some magic user has been through here, doing some pretty twisted stuff, and they’ll need to mop up.”
He hugged Steve to him one final time and then stepped away. “I’ll be back soon,” he promised, and patted Vision’s arm.
Tony turned, tensing. Maximoff and Barnes were both there, as if summoned by magic, or by… OK, well, that just confirmed that he was being surveilled.
Beside him, Barton glanced over, his hands steady on the controls. “You’re in a foul mood.”
(He dies on the icy ground, his metallic heart in Barnes’s hands, the small child crying, Steve frowning down at him, and Captain America turning away, disappointed.)
) rooms, Barton at his heels. “You really don’t need to follow me around everywhere,” he said to Barton, a little more mildly than he had intended. “Seriously, I'm fine.”
soldiers on the team. People that can make that call for him. So that betrayal... it feels personal in a variety of ways.
She nodded. “We’ll check just the same. And if you come with us as well…” She took hold of his arm and gently led him to the gurneys. “We can check on you while you keep him company, yes? Just to make sure you’re alright.”
She gave him a knowing look and pushed the door open.
For all of T’Challa’s sanction, for all his,
Romanoff just sighed. “If you two are quite done…”
“What about Tony?”
A small hand slipped in his, large blue eyes blinking up at him.
“I don’t,” Tony bit out, and turned up the unibeam to full power.
Like a compass homing north, Steve’s gaze soon lands on Tony among the crowd. Tony is talking animatedly with Harley, a kid Tony had encountered in Tennessee two years prior who assisted him during the Extremis incident. Harley’s family stands near him, half in awe to be in Tony’s presence which is equivalent to that of a celebrity and half smiling as Harley and Tony chatter with infectious glee and loop them in to join.
Steve parks his motorbike at the first empty spot he sees and then heads into the racing stadium that he tailed Tony to, pushing his sunglasses higher on the bridge of his nose and tugging his cap lower over his face in hopes that no one would recognize him.
“Jets,” Tony corrected, as they both tossed their drinks back. Clint promptly crumbled to the ground and Thor let out a blissful sigh as he said, “Another!”
. He’s dangerous. He is only released because he’s Asgard’s prince!”
“You’re welcome,” Steve replied with a laugh.
Thor settling a careful hand on Bruce’s arm might have helped.
Thor poured another cup of golden Asgardian mead and extended it to Natasha in offering.
“She’s smiling!!” Tony hissed to Steve in mock-surprise and delight, shaking Steve’s arm excitedly, and Steve’s laugh spilled over as he tried to admonished, “Tony!”
“I’m not forgetting this!” Tony warns, even as his hand, calloused and warm, settles into Steve’s. When Steve stands up, Tony slides forward and slots his body against his.
Steve feels a grin tug at his face, even as his anticipation rises like everyone else. Loki really is similar to Tony, he just hides his need to impress a little better. “Good luck, JARVIS.”
Even before the announcer has finished speaking, loud cheers erupts amidst the crowd. Below on the track, Tony grins and waves, taking a bow and pressing kisses to his fingers before sending them out, accepting his fans’ adoration as his due and sending back his own in kind. It creates a vicious cycle that spurs both sides on, encouraging them to escalate. It is Tony at his most purposeful obnoxious self and they both know it too.
“JARVIS?” Steve says, terrible hope and fear unfurling in his chest. He finally pulls his gaze away from the race track. Steve has a trash can lid roughly the size of his shield in one hand and is pulling up a kid who has fallen on the ground among the pandemonium just before he gets trampled.
“Hmm, nope,” Tony said. “Good guess. Don’t yell at me, but I mighta just been sipping on some of Thor’s mead.”
A holographic screen appears in front of Steve, displaying a video feed of the kitchen. “JARVIS?” Steve whispers, trying to figure out what’s going on and why Loki is in Tony’s kitchen, but JARVIS doesn’t reply. Steve looks at the screen.
be racing in a race car and who’s means will very much be a surprise!”
“JARVIS? Please call the Roombas off,” he said, as seriously as he could manage. There was something hilarious about Thor trying to thank and calm the overeager Roombas from trying to eat his shirt.
Steve sighs, not surprised by yet another reference to him following them to the race. “You’ll be sick of mentioning it one day,” Steve says, more of a wistful thinking to himself than any actual hope. “Right about now sounds great.”
Bruce and Thor were sitting next to each other with their heads lowered together, so close they were almost touching. The black curls of Bruce’s brushed against Thor’s straight blond hair, a lovely contrast highlighting and enhancing the other’s individual traits, and their gazes were concentrated and bright as the fire’s light flickered across their faces like a caress.
he knew how this would look to the others, especially to Barton and Romanoff.
“It distressed him,” Tony said bluntly. “He was aware of the presence of the other Steve’s mind inside his own, and it was very frightening and possibly painful for him.”
T’Challa seemed to concur with that assessment. “To join her?” He asked softly.
Much like what he was - belatedly - trying to do with Peter. Trying to make it right.
(Because if there was one thing that Tony had known he’d always excelled at, it was in hurting people who loved him.)
Maximoff made a sharp sound suddenly, then covered her face with her hands, looking mortified.
Tony thought incredulously. Really?
I really don’t think you’re in any position to -”
“Alright. Well, tell Rhodey we said hello. And call at least once a week, OK? None of that making FRIDAY do it.”
“You really didn’t like the plan?”
“Right.” Tony folded his legs and leaned back in his seat, spreading his arms in as easy and welcoming a gesture as he could manage, given the lingering strain in his shoulders and back from spending the night slumped in a chair. “The child. You know what happened - the portal, the mind stone - when I was away?”
Because it was obvious even to him that Barton wasn’t. That Barton hadn’t been sleeping, and hadn’t had his wounds tended to. And where was everyone else, other than ‘deployed’? Not that he was in any fit state to be of much help, of course… “Well, given everything, I guess we’ll have to raincheck that round at the gym, huh?” He said instead, tentative. He wouldn’t have thought that Barton would care that much, but…
Tony thought, suddenly certain. Romanoff would have backed Barnes, and the others would have fallen in line, willing or not.
Steve nodded, looking pleased at this.  “I drawed it because you’re sick, and my friend always draws me pictures when I’m sick. And then I drawed him ones back!” He beamed, as if this had been a panacea.
“No.” He hoped. “But, I can take you to him.” He thought. He’d have to either go outside - leaving the kid sans suit-heater again - and set up a link there, or get the communications working from the inside. The base still had a power supply, albeit in the form of generators, and the exit hadn’t been orderly. He could probably get that sorted out just as easily from inside the control room. And he’d be able to contact FRIDAY at the same time. It’d be a little more time consuming, but he didn’t want to take the kid out of the suit any earlier than he had to. “Tell you what. You stay inside the suit and warm up, and I’ll have a look at getting com- uh, a phone line up and running.” He’d be able to get at the data back-ups at the same time, see if there was anything useful in there.
” Tony frantically converted the time zones in his head. “05:24 local time - that was in Oakland, right? So that would make it...middle of the afternoon, Wakandan time.” He turned to T’Challa. “Right around the time -”
“Hey! Just because you’re taken doesn’t mean the rest of us can’t flirt,” Tony said crossly. He smiled at Dhakiya. “So, raincheck on the walk? I’d love to see a bit more of Birnin Zana.” Especially the labs of whoever had come up with Barnes’s new arm.
The air -
(So he still had issues. So sue him.)
Half of him wants to tell Rogers that the tachycardia, the low blood pressure, the presyncope,
At this point, Tony was not entirely sure what the answer was to that question. “Absolutely,” he said confidently. “They need to lull both assailants in a false sense of security and then…” He trailed off delicately. “Why, d’you have an alternate solution?”
“Yeah,” Barton said slowly, his expression troubled. “I know what kids are like.” He started to say something else, then seemed to think better of it, lapsing into silence.
Well, it couldn’t hurt, could it?
He’d originally planned to leave early in the morning, but practicalities had immediately intruded. It was gone noon and they were still nowhere near leaving.
He sighed. Who he wanted - he realised with a sudden jolt - was
have anything to do with you, okay?”
“He’s
The screaming was growing fainter and fainter, as if the world was easing away from him. As if he was falling, and if he looked up he could see the surface of the water receding, the light flickering and fading. He strained against it, trying to drag himself back up to where the screaming was coming from, to where he could hear the child in severe distress.
- and took a wobbly step. “Rhodey, please, I need to -”
Steve said, and for a moment, Tony thought he meant the kiss.
impossibility of wanting his mother - and he almost didn’t dare believe that it was possible. That he could have this small slice of normality back.
It didn’t matter in the end. If they were wrong, either way, it would be Steve who’d end up paying the price.
terrible - but it’s also true. Bucky has no one other than you.) Sam left behind a sister, a nephew, and a mother, and they are entitled to… something. You’re not sure what, but Tony had provided for each of you, and even though none of you had touched those balances in all the time you’d been apart, there is no time for delicacy now. Sam’s mother will need a nursing home soon, and his sister lost her brother and her husband and had a small child to raise.
Steve exhaled suddenly, as if in a rush, and went limp under Tony’s hand as he fell back asleep.
(How the hell had he survived?)
“Okay. Well, you have to promise to keep your eyes closed, then. Deal?”
“You’ll have it.” He nodded towards the bedside table, where the pebble still sat. “I will have it uploaded. And…” he cleared his throat, suddenly sounding awkward. “Have you listened to Steve’s audio entries yet?”
Vision looked back at him, his expression open. “Stark.
“Perhaps we should wake the others,” Okoye broke in gently, glancing between Minoru and Tony. “We have a long journey back.” At Minoru’s nod, she led both her and Mordo towards the quinjet, looking at Tony over her shoulder then steering both the magic-users away.
Tony swore, freely and at length, and then kicked Barton as hard as he could on his retreating arse.
Steve nodded.
“I’ll set it up,” Barton said, and got to his feet.
First the massacre at the base, then the realisation that he was on his own, and now someone was actively after his head.
“He’s fine,” Rhodey said, which made no sense. The kid was in the
Her lips thinned. “All right.” She sat down, little-girl prim, her ankles folded away to one side, her hands clasped in her lap. She’d swapped her leather boots and skirt for one of the long printed dresses that seemed to be in fashion here, a thick belt buckled around it awkwardly. A necklace of tiny red and orange beads hung heavy about her neck.
Tony was once again forcibly reminded that Barton had tried his own variant of that, and look how that had worked out.
there wouldn’t be any visible tech, not if they wanted to make Steve feel comfortable. He’d taken pretty well to the Iron Man suit, but Tony still wasn’t entirely sure whether Steve had simply assumed that it was also a form of magic; certainly his reference to Galahad had raised a few eyebrows.
Mordo had told them, looking somewhat nonplussed to have been handcuffed to his seat.
Barton left them alone with the art supplies after a couple of hours, presumably going off to do whatever it was unconcussed people did: reading Jane Foster’s notes, planning a trap for their evil portal-maker, passing notes to Rhodey, Tony wasn’t very clear on this point and didn’t much care, as long as he was left alone to nurse his headache and try to get some sleep.
Umar, who might be terrible enough that Mordo viewed whatever actions he took to stop her as nothing more than a necessary sacrifice.
He had managed precisely one hour of uninterrupted sleep - Steve drawing peacefully by his side with intense concentration - before he was rudely woken up by -
Barton’s jaw clenched so much Tony was half-expecting to hear his fillings crack. “Yeah, well, I wasn’t real keen on having you stroke out on me through fear before we could get you under, and my options were limited. Forgive me for doing the best I could with a shitty situation, OK? Mea maxima culpa.” He looked down at where Steve was idly unwinding the loose threads from the blanket covering Tony’s bed. “Hey, kiddo. How about I get you something fun to do, huh? Maybe some crayons and pencils?”
He rubbed at his face tiredly. He’d half-known what she was going to say; for all her cynicism, Nat had an annoying habit of expecting the best of them.
“Boss,”
Surely.)
“But, with witnesses…”
But no, that made no sense, they’d clearly despised each other from the very beginning. “Not a fan of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, huh?” His voice was too loud; he could see Wanda shifting, startled.
Tony nodded tightly, not trusting himself to speak.
“Right.” Barton was silent for a long moment. Then, “alright, what can I do to help?”
Mordo might have been many things - psychotic and disturbingly persuasive were chief among them - but one thing he was evidently
Wilson wasn’t going to fucking tell him, why the hell should he? If he’d thought that this was some political move, some deliberate move on the part of a few governments to stamp what they thought as ‘acceptable’ on the Avengers… Tony had always wondered how a fucking
Tony blinked at him. Barton swayed, separated out into two and then came back together again. That was strange. Wasn’t that strange? “Um… I - warfarin,” he mumbled.
“What is it?” Rogers bites out, his hackles well and truly up. The flush is still there, high up on his cheeks, and for an idle moment Tony wonders if - no.
Tony scrutinised the drawing and took pity on the kid.
“Why am I still here?”
The pen felt heavy in his hand.
There is a small pause. “What variables, boss?”
FRIDAY’s voice was even more strained. “Yes, boss. Right away. Are you able to maintain contact until help arrives?”
? “You are unhurt,” he said, and he sounded angry. “I could have - but I did not.”
He nodded back. “I know. Thanks, Rhodey. And I really am glad you got your dick back.”
“Yeah, you’re a real prince,” Tony sneered, but he did not step away from Barton. Weirdly, Barton’s flash of rage made him feel a bit better to know that he was not the only one struggling with this. That he was not the only harbouring a grudge, or obsessing over things said weeks ago. Instead he matched his stride to Barton’s until they were almost marching shoulder to shoulder, both furious in their solidarity.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut and curses the day that Rogers was ever born. “I'm not holding him fucking hostage,” he says wearily, even though he knows he was doing exactly that. Fuck Rogers for calling his bluff.
Tony stayed perfectly still, listening to Steve’s breathing slowly evening out before he slipped into an exhausted sleep. From this angle, Tony could only really see the top of his head, and the curve of one ear. He was so
Okoye elbowed him sharply. “Master Minoru,” she said - and turned to the woman at their side. “I apologise for my error.”
“The king’s best friend was a knight…”
He didn’t want to listen to all of it in sequence, not if it was a mission briefing. Not when he’d already gathered all the data he needed from the hard copy.
It was gone again, he’d just had it, and it was gone.
T’Challa gave him a sharp look. “Oh?”
“I wasn’t aware I needed a defence. Not with you.” She looked up at him from under her lashes. Once upon a time, she’d used this same move to ingratiate herself as Natalie Rushman; later, she’d used it again and again to tease, to show him that she trusted him to handle it. To let him see all the tools at her disposal. Now…
“I have been busy,” Mordo said, his eyes flickering between Minoru and Okoye and then - finally - coming to rest on Tony. “Mr Stark, I did not harm your friends. You may wake them now, if you like. I merely wished to demonstrate that this charade is pointless. I am not working with you under duress, but because we need to cooperate.” He half-turned, Minoru turning with him, her hand still on his chest. “We could just -” He stopped, and looked down. “Wait, what are you -”
Ah, of course. In the end, didn’t everything boil down to money? The Avengers subsidiary had been pretty effectively ring-fenced - and had been in the process of splitting off from the main SI parent company - when the whole Accords fiasco had blown up at them. Either way, SI would have an impenetrable liability shield, but that didn’t mean that the sub wasn’t vulnerable. As things currently stood, the Avengers didn’t exist in a legal sense as anything other than private security (and they certainly didn’t enjoy diplomatic immunity, no matter what anyone might have wished). It meant that the government couldn’t direct them or take charge of them, but it also meant that they weren’t covered by government guarantees or other protections if they were sued. Just like any other company operating in private security and disaster recovery, any screw-ups meant a pay-out.
With luck, he’d start repeating
Across the room, Steve continued to stare, unmoving from his place inside the suit.
As the therapist opened up his bag of torture devices and foam pads, Tony stared up at the ceiling. “There is literally no one in the world I don’t hate right now.” Almost as soon as the words left his mouth he wanted to call them back. If there’d only been adults in the room, the vociferous hate he had for all forms of physiotherapy would probably have been fine (and dear God, he was going to get Rhodey a punching bag that could clip on to the chair, or a stress ball, or
of that. Although, judging by the slow exhale Romanoff gave beside him, she’d been thinking it for some time. Tony quirked an eyebrow at her.
“Stark, hurry up,” Barnes said finally, sounding displeased.
“It’s totally SkyNet,” Barton muttered, sotto voce. “Steve is probably a reincarnated John Connor.” He smirked at Tony. “Hey, does that make you his mom?”
apologising to
Another shrug. “I woke up in clothes that were a lot bigger than me. And - I wasn’t lying, before. I saw the b-bodies.” He breathed sharply as he said the word, almost hiccuping. “They looked like - like they were bigger, before, before they -”
They sat in silence, Barnes watching the outside and Barton’s eyes occasionally glancing between Hill and Tony, his brow furrowed. In Tony’s lap, Steve murmured and shifted in restless sleep, heedless of Tony’s attempts to soothe him.
“Was it my advanced drawing course in October you sat for?”
“Oh, okay. Good, good.” Tony hesitated. “But if you wanted it remodeled, you know with chrome and granite, something more like this, we could do it.”
“I’m glad,” Steve said haltingly. “That was-- I dunno. Harder and easier than I was expecting, if that makes sense?” Tony nodded and squeezed his hand. “Stephen was easy to talk to. And I knew you’d be watching.” He shook his head. “I’m glad to be done.”
Steve looked up startled, then gave a rueful smile. “I think I need 70 years to study.”
,” Steve breathed. Tony was pretty sure that it wouldn’t take much more for Steve’s breathy
“Yeah, that’s right,” Jerry said grinning, like the proud parent of a dim toddler.
(Shit.)
(Still didn’t go under. Not even for him.)
(See the end of the chapter for
Tom grinned. That was
“Sweetheart, you don’t have to do some sort of strip tease or put on some sort of performance.  I just want to watch you take your clothes off.  Because I told you to.  Okay?”
Who cares what some stupid tabloid wrote about him.
(And likely to get even better.)
“Oh, okay. Great!” Holding Tony’s hand loosely in his, Steve led Tony over to the couch. “So, I thought maybe you’d like to—“ he gestured.
Tony shook his head and laughed. “If I start at the beginning-
“The steps of the arbitration process are in Section 42, subheading 8,” she said. “Assuming your own committees couldn’t resolve the issue, the matter would be referred to court-appointed negotiator.”
Rebecca shook her head as she continued, “Ockerman’s convinced he’s found Erasmus’ hand in the marginalia of MS.47-79f. I’m pretty sure it’s wishful thinking, but we’ll see. Anyway,” she gave a little shrug, “I’ll have my cell phone on me at all times and will be able to pick up within five minutes—I just have to leave the reading room. The number’s in your phone.”
needed to talk to Rhodey.)
“Good.” He patted Steve. “Gimme a sec.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve came back at that moment, arms full of (still-wet) paper. “Come back to the rooms with me,” Tony suggested instead. “We’ll talk there.” He looked down at Steve, who was tugging urgently on Tony’s hand. “What’ve you got there, kiddo?”
Barnes frowned up at it. “Too many windows.”
Barton looked up at that, like a shark scenting blood. “Oh, this should be good.”
Umar, who seemed to belong more to the tales of Ur and Babylon than in the modern world. Umar, who tore open the membranes between worlds with the pain contained in children’s bodies.
“And you’re one of them?”
Tony shot him a startled look. “For me?” Not for his mom, or his - his Bucky? (He wasn’t gonna dignify the Barton thing with a comment. Sure, Barton had asked for him. Had asked
Natasha was waiting for him when he left the room a few minutes later, Barton busy at the little kitchenette, making a fresh pot of coffee. “He’s OK?” She asked, sounding a little uncertain. “We had some trouble getting him to bed. He seemed to quieten down when M’Baku put him in your shirt, though, but we had to leave the nightlight on.” She bit her lip, uncharacteristically abashed, as if the shirt - or the concession to a child’s terror - had been some great transgressive act. (Perhaps, for her, it was.)
The kid hesitated at that for a moment then shook his head again, burrowing into Tony’s shoulder.
The pebble sat in the centre of his hand, inert, as he thought about it.
Tony glanced up. Barton was rubbing a hand over his face, fingers skirting the edges of the bruising that had still yet to completely fade.
They might fight him on it, sure, but what could they really do?
“You in there, Rogers?” He waved a cautious hand from a safe distance. Three metres was good, right? Not close enough to panic the kid into a sudden movement. (The last he needed was explaining to the world why he’d allowed a pint-sized Captain America to skewer himself in his presence.) “Hey, Steve? You recognise me, right? It's Ir- it's Tony. We’re friends. You remember that, right?” He inched forward carefully, his eyes on the blade.
The Master wrinkled her nose, as if he had said something offensive. “No. We do not use weapons in the same way as you do; in this instance, they would merely compound the damage already done. A method of entry would be a way for us to undo what has been done. Ordinarily, we would lock away the attack into another dimension, so that there is no damage here, but that cannot contain Umar. This dimension is as alien to her as any other, and so she would merely continue in her attempts wherever we put her. No, it is clear that a fixed point would be our best option, if it exists. If not, we can -” She stopped, her eyes flickering between Okoye and Tony. “There is a problem?”
Vision tapped his communicator, disquiet on his face.
Steve looked up at Tony shyly and turned a little pink, shaking his head and hiding against Tony’s side instead of answering.
Well, he’d trusted Pepper on this so far and she hadn’t steered him wrong. Smile and offer cooperation, and then stall at every opportunity. The Accords weren’t going anywhere - especially not with 117 countries signed up to them - but a signature wasn’t ratification. And there was many a slip ‘twixt the cup and the lip, as the saying went. The Accords would hold, at least for the time being. Ross would hold. Even - God help him - Richard Smith would have to hold, probably frothing at the insult.
(See the end of the chapter for
, as if Siberia was just an embarrassing domestic that everyone knew to carefully ignore?
- whatever visiting hours, magical torture or other hideous activity Tony had agreed them to attempt with the kid. Who Tony as now in charge of.
T'Challa is very much the Wakandan James T Kirk. M'Baku is... I guess the Wakandan Spock? (Don't overthink it.) Anyway, they're both leaders, they are both used to setting their personal feelings aside for the greater good, and frankly, if they can work with (a controlled, monitored, under their thumb) Mordo to prevent what is a big crisis about to happen, they damn well will.
When she smiled, it rather reminded Tony of a shark scenting prey. He wondered, suddenly, if she was as young as she appeared, or whether that, too, was another feint.
Which probably explained why Barnes had bolted at the first sign of rejection on the part of kid!Steve. Tony didn’t buy Rogers driving Barnes away, not when he’d burned his entire life on the pyre of getting even a fraction of him back. But Barnes could have run, sure, if he felt that he was in danger of being rejected. He looked down at the child in his arms. Maybe this version of Steve was too familiar to what Barnes remembered?
“Bet you're not supposed to touch knives either, huh?” He was almost close enough to make a grab for the knife. “I bet your mom would have a lot to say if she saw you waving that around.” He could probably grab the knife. He should. He should just - “Give me the knife, Steve. I'm not a bad guy, and I'm not here to hurt you.” He held out a hand.
he decided at last. He rounded the corner back to the PICU, pausing outside once again. Steve was still stretched out on the bed, tiny under the heavy hospital linen. After a minute or two, he went inside and took a seat by his bedside.
Because - of course - it didn’t matter if Tony had figured it out. He wasn’t going to expose Steve to more danger by attempting to move him if there was still a chance he’d have a stroke mid-flight, not unless they were definitely under attack.
(Could he trust her at his back? Her, and Barnes, and Wanda?)
“Yes.” Tony took a deep breath, watching T’Challa carefully. “But that’s not enough. We don’t know why it’s happening, and we can’t do anything about it here. Now that Mordo is working with us and isn’t a threat to Steve, there’s no reason to stay in Jabariland.”
Steve nodded obediently at that, his face hidden against the crook of his arm.
Natasha answered the door. “You’re early.”
He put Steve back down to re-attach the boot and showed him how it joined back to the leg. “There, that’s all fixed, now.”
No one could. It was on him, now. It was on
A couple of minutes later Rhodey reconnected the call, the background indicating the living room rather than the bedroom. “Sorry, didn’t want to wake Sam.”
On Tony’s other side, there was a metallic
When he looked back up, his eyes were full of tears.
Steve nodded and ran off to collect his artwork.
“What the hell do you want, Barnes?” Tony looked down at the wriggle in his arms and let Steve slide free to promptly hide behind his leg. “Look, you frightened him. Nice work. Kill any rabbits lately?”
“I couldn’t have done it at all without yours and JARVIS’ help,'' Steve says finally, turning back to Pepper. He raises his glass, indicating towards her and the ceiling at JARVIS. “Thank you.”
“Thor’s mead - !” Steve remembered the last time he drank some of the Asgardian mead and how just a few cups could make even him drunk. He should have realized that wouldn’t be the end of it when he stopped Tony from trying it last time. “Tony!”
“Cheap shot!” Clint protested, emerging from where his entire body was sunk chest-deep into an adult-sized bean bag chair so only his head could be seen, and even without looking over, Steve could hear the pout in his voice. “C’mon, Tasha, Tony would’ve caught me.”
“I was saving the president,” Tony said, turning with a flourish to include the rest of the group, who had been patiently waiting for their conversation to play out. Natasha caught Steve’s eyes as he followed Tony’s movement and tilted her head to the side in camaraderie, a shared ‘what can you do about it’ shrug of exasperated fondness. “I was thirty, forty feet off the ground and had to jump to avoid a blast from Extremis-crazed minions. JARVIS caught me with a suit well before I was anywhere close to the ground, and then I went to beat some fiery asses and save the day.”
Tony gave him an incredulous look. “ Ex-fucking-cuse me? I can so go another fucking round buddy. You’re the one who falls asleep after one round. I am so not a minute man.” Tony growled.
Tony felt the blonde shift and rest his head between his legs.
Rhodey was much like his Rhodey. He was nice to him and cared for him. One day he even picked out his clothing for him. He noticed what he was doing and explained he sometimes did it for the other Tony. He didn’t mind. It reminded him of his Rhodey. However, he was dating Sam, which was different. His Rhodey was definitely heterosexual. Rhodey said it was nothing serious and that it was more of a friends with benefits type of thing. But Tony doubt that. Sam seemed pretty attached to him and Handsy.
“ Pietro thinks Steve is sleeping with Tony and he wants him to tutor him.” Bucky supplied.
“ So.... you do know you can add another right?”
“No it isn’t...”
“ I- I was trying to catch you. You’re fast,” He panted.
“ He fell through the ceiling,”Tony said calmly.
Steve chuckled. “ That would be your prostate sweetheart.”
“ Director is fine. But I also reply to Johann and Schmidt.”
“ I don’t like Paris,” Peter grumbled and pouted.
“ Like hell we are. Do you how long we tried to set you up?”
Peter unlocked his phone and looked for the picture that Harry and sent him of himself. It was easier to just please him then to hear him whine. Peter showed him a picture that Harry sent of him after he had just finished working out. He was shirtless and had sweat dripping down his muscular torso.
Tony’s head shot up. What the hell?
The alarm blared overhead.
Tony sighed as he took off his tie and jacket. Today was going to be his first date with Winghead aka Steve, according to one asshole wizard. He stripped the rest of the way down as he thought better about wearing a Tom Ford suit with Winghead. He then placed on a full length wet suit. Yep. He won’t care if Winghead got this wet and torn if he decides to beat the shot out of Tony like some of his gruntled dates do.
“ Grant what the-“
Tony felt another weight on the other side of him.
“ I’m just saying. I know that you aren’t very versed in athletics. So i thought I would just help.”
Tony  opened the enclosure and walked in, making sure the door was closed behind him.
I wanted you to mention this as I want Tony to be aware of your past. He has the right to know no matter how terrible.”
“ You know what I mean.”
“ I would never intentionally hurt Tony,” he snapped. “ As for the other asshole, I can’t promise as much.”
Steve frowned.
“ If I were to use some of that serum, would I get these types of abs too?”
Strange nodded and turned to Tony. “ I hope we meet again.” Strange placed a soft kiss on his forehead before flicking his wrist and disappearing.
He also decided to sabotage his car so it wouldn’t start when he was heading out for the day. Steve offered to take him in his bike. Because who doesn’t think a motorcycle is sexy. He just said his dad will pick him up.
“ Tony you- “
Tony rolled his eyes, but went with it. “ Yes your grace.” Might as well try and please him, he did say he was getting his friends back.
The blonde threw his hands in the air. “ Fine! I’ll look at them. Then you must leave me alone for the rest of the week. Is that understood? Because unlike you I am a real busy person and I have a desk full of papers back at my office.”
Sam sighed. “ I guess this is the end of our sessions”
Tony looked around Fury and saw Strange.
The angry brunette strode in the room and gave him a quick once over. “ Seriously, you ditched me so you can get your rocks off? I was waiting for you!”
Peter tried not to wince. This guy did not give up. They started walking to their next class together.
“ Tell them anything but what you just said! Tell them you don’t hate gays!”
The Commander stiffened and didn’t answer. Natasha tried again.
“ What the hell are you doing here?”
“ You will. It’s not that bad.”
Peter nodded.
“ Huh, Thats interesting. Well he was a superhero. The Tony in our world used to dress up as him for Halloween when he was a child.” Rhodey said.
Tony was sobbing at this point and Rhodey gathered him in is arms rubbing soothing circles across his back. He let him nuzzle into his chest, really more snot onto the white shirt. He hoped it came out in the wash later. But there in Rhodey’s arms after his talk about Steve and the team, He had never felt more safe and loved in his life.
“ Are you shitting me?” This was not right. He had to get out of here. Tony looked out of the corner of his eye and saw rows of suits. He just need to get over there...
Which led to Tony strapping the intruder into a “ Hulk-proof” chair and him calling Rhodey for extra back-up. The man was the least likely to be judgmental out of all the Avengers.
Peter looked at his face and saw a decent size bruise.
Steve blushed and look away, trying to cross his legs to hide his growing erection.
“ Maria, you can’t just go and spoil the boy even more. He did something dangerous and he should be reprimanded.”
Steve just rolled his eyes. He wouldn’t understand. He didn’t have his heart and soul die. He didn’t have his life crumble right in front of him. He just wanted Tony back.
“ Tony, what do you want? You are being an ass right now,” Steve growled.
He picked out a good name indeed.
“ Nat it’s me Tony. Get up here quick. Bring the tranq gun. We need back up.”
“ Umm... some lingerie.”
Thanks for all the support so far. I hope you all continue to support my story. Also please comment as I love to hear your thoughts.
Wade never finished as Peter slapped him across the face. He felt the tears run down his face and blur his vision.
“ Yes, i know. Wanda explained to us when I found that your ass was in police custody. As an adult you handle it with the appropriate adult: you should have talked to the principal.”
When Steve’s knot deflated and he was able to roll to his side to look at Tony the man gave him a cheeky smile.
Steve huffed as he sat down next to Tony, wrapping an arm protective around his body.
Quentin turned and saw Peters worried face. He looked around and saw that he appeared to be in a hospital room.
Tony dropped the book on the bed and crouched next to him.
“ Shy? That’s not really your type.” Howard said.
Here is the  second:
“ At the compound.”
They all turned to him, confused.
Tony scooted closer and threw  a leg over Steve’s hips so that he could straddle him. Steve looked up at him.
“ Peter, are you okay?”
“ Please! Please, Steve,” Tony whined as the super soldier thrusted form behind. The cuffs had been undone and Tony had been placed on his stomach and re cuffed to the bed. Steve roughly bit at his shoulder and neck, leaving a series of bruises.
“ And it works for your wife?”
“ Really?” Tony asked in disbelief.
“ Really? What does you dad have to say?”
“ Harry?”
“ Tony be careful, you are going to hurt yourself.”
chance to follow.
“ So...” Tony started.
“ Pour some on one of your fingers and rub it around my hole. The girls seemed to like that.”
“ It’s not that-“
“ That good?”
Bucky shook his head.
Harry smiled at her and walked over to Peter and sat down next to him.
“ And then you just let Tony back in there after he sang?”
Tony threw and arm around Grant and have him a kiss on the head when he heard what seems like a muffled sob.
Thanks for reading my story so far! I have read the comments and I hope this peek into their family life is as good as you all hoped. Please keep commenting. :)
“ So like  a threesome?” Sam asked.
Steve shook his head. “ God... They make me want to get drunk.”
Tony smirked. He had him, he knew he did. “ Hi, honey, are you going to come through with your promise and rail me?”
Tony scooted over.” Hey I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.”
Natasha sailed Fury’s number on her cell phone.
‘ What now,’ Tony thought.
Harry looked at him stupefied. “ No baby, no. It’s not that. You have a boyfriend remember?”He cooed as he rubbed his exposed hip.
“ Is this really ok? I mean I don’t want Tony it feel left out,” Steve asked Sam as he helped carry the beer and the finger foods to the common area.
“ Fucking A Pete, it smells like a fucking whorehouse,” Morgan groused.
“ Shut up,” he said with no venom in it.
“ What did they do exactly? I mean  it’s kind of hard to not notice them.”
Tony looked up and saw the gaping hole in the ceiling. He decided not to comment.
“ Yeah something like that. Supposedly Bucky was used the most according to the report. The others were being trained. Nat was saying there were more. But They didn’t make it. Who knows how many of them were killed.”
“ He said you look good on your back”
Fucking idiots.
“ And why are you so nosey bird brain?” Tony asked as he chewed on a piece of bacon. He had been eating meals semi-regularly ever since Steve took it upon himself to drag him out of the lab. He had never noticed before how poorly Tony took care of himself when he insisted on caring for others.
Tony climbed on top of Cap and squirmed around, pushing down on CAps head at one point, until he got a glimpse of...,
“ Totally after with the geeky and awkward part.”
“ It’s not that.”
“ Peter this isn’t funny. You’re going to get hurt.”
“ Wade, you are a terrific boyfriend. It’ll just take them time to see that.”
“ You could have burnt down my penthouse!”
“ You can’t sleep in your shoes.” Harry tried to reach for his other foot.
Tony hummed.
“ Well I understand your point of view. I wouldn’t want to be with Someone who hit me either, but you have to also look at it from his point of view. His mate was in danger and despite him harming you he was worried that you would kill Him. And their kind are often physical with one another to get their point across. So that hot would actually be more of a love tap one someone from their kind to just serve as a warning to not fight. He didn’t anticipate that he would actually hurt you.”
There was a snarl to Tony’s back and he turned in time to dodge the two large wolves tumbling into the coffee table.
2 hours earlier
“ We don’t think like that doll,” Grant whispered as he rubbed a hand a crossed Tony’s back.
Peter sighed as he walked up the steps to his school and into the building.
Tony wanted to roll his eyes. This guy really needed to up his flirting.
Tony glared at his new bedmates until he fell asleep that night.
Steve has noticed that there was writing on it during lunch earlier and when he asked about it, Tony proudly showed him the signatures and messages of heir fellow teammates and SI staff. Steve has offered to put something in the cast and Tony had excitedly gave him his arm.
Tony was to tired to try and ride Steve so he laid boneless over Grant.
Grant stepped forward, smiling. “ Tony, Steve and I have a surprise for you.”
He never noticed what a nice smile the man had.
“ I can ask the same of you”
Tony Dropped his head against the floor. Why the fuck goes he need to have this type of luck?
“ You’re not hurt are ya? You’ll tell me right doll?”
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
“ Woah there Pete. I don’t need you following. Come on let’s get you to someplace a little safer.”
He sat down a bit away from him.
Morgan snatched the phone from his brother. “ Hey give that back!” Peter snapped as Morgan quickly typed out a text and sent it. “ What did you say?”
Tony sighed and raked a hand through his hair. “ Ok, sweetheart, I have to go.”
“ Shh... it’s ok babe, I didn’t mean to scare you. You don’t have to be nervous.”Steve cooed as he placed a hand on his upper thigh.  Tony didn’t even realize how scared he got.
“ Ok, so nothing to much... we’ve been having a relatively quite time. So first thing on our list is the fundraiser this Saturday. We need
He was interrupted from a the sound of plates breaking and the brunette cursing.
“ Yeah. Pepper recommended it. She said she usually buy you take out from here.”
“ If he was so great he wouldn’t have been caught and would have crash landed elsewhere.”
“ What? What is it Nat?” Clint asked excitedly .
Steve smiled back. “ Ok then let’s go.”
Tony could feel his eyes water. “ I want to.”
When Maria called them up for lunch, they saved their worked and headed up to the main dining hall.
“ Oh, Fuck that shit. I’m not going,” Bucky grumbled.
“ Young sir, as much as I enjoy hugging you, I believe you should eat as you are quite thin.”
Tony liked up when he heard voices coming near.  He glared when he saw his jailer at the door. He glared back as he opens the cage and reached inside to grab Tony by the heavy metal  collar around his neck to pull him out. He felt it dig slightly into his skin and he winced in pain.
Wade sat next to Peter bringing him to his chest. “ Shhh.... it’s alright babe. It can be scary the first time.”
Tony cowered at the angry sight of his mother. He had forgotten how made she could get. And of course Rhodey had ditched him. The damn coward.
Steve ignored him.
“ Sure why not?” Steve smiled and traded places with Bucky and positioned himself behind him.
“ You’re telling me.”
Steve and Grant blushed and looked away. Tony smirked. “ There’s two of them Nat, it takes twice as long.”
“ Shit. This changes things. Call in the Avengers.”
The balding man stepped forward. “If I may, we have Ellie here. She’s quite beautiful as you can see and a virgin. I have no doubt that you shall find her suitable.” The man gently ushered forward another girl.
“ Tony where are your manners? You do not eat that way at the table. Now straighten up and do not roll your eyes at me young man.”
He was not going to be fine. He is not fine. He must have died and gone to heaven.
“ Mr. Stark, if you don’t comply I’m afraid we will have to make you comply.”
The balding man glared at him. “ You should thank his grace.” He growled.
He felt himself release with a cry. He felt steve release not long after.
He roughly flipped the man over and draped himself over his back. He tightly gripped the man’s wrist and pushed it over his head.
Tony was interrupted when the alarms started to blare. Needless to say they were not happy with Dr. Doom and his little stunt at all.
“ Oh my god, Steve. Oh god! So good!”
“ Good friend,” Tony mused.
“ Then why all this bullshit, huh?”
“ Yeah...yeah baby just like that.” Tony panted. Tony grabbed his nails up and down Winghead back, and was quite sure he was leaving welts in their wake.
Tony felt himself go cold as the blood drained from his face. Steve instantly saw the shift.
Good idea. You know I don’t always get to say ‘ I told you so’ to you.”
Steve looked at him with hooded eyes and he made quick work of his belt and fly.
“ He was the one that led the army, Tony. He was the mind behind everything. He is their leader, their king. Bucky’s his second in command.” Wanda finished.
“ He is upset Tony isn’t receptive to his courting-“
“ Well, that’s just a normal reaction to me. Don’t worry, I definitely won’t mind showing a good time on our next date. “
“ We were able to retrieve a blood sample and do a quick scan. It’s a He. Anyway, his singing is deadly. He already killed three fishermen who were trying to catch from that alone. He can either sing a certain tune that can cause them to die or lure them in and manually kill them. “
“ Yes. What do you think wine is made out of?”
At that moment a very naked Bucky strode into the room. everyone looked at him in shock as the man sunk to his knees and placed his head on Tony’s lap, giving him a wide smile.
What the actual fuck. What god damn rabbit hole did he fall down in where the Red Skull actually lowers to argue with Clint and watches Dr. Oz?
“ Not the image i want of our father.”
“ The What? And by the way what should I call you?” Tony asked.
Tony felt his held being gently coaxed back the a large hand as a wet tongue licked its way up the column of his throat, and then switching to sucking, without breaking the skin when he reached his jugular. Tony wrapper his arms around the pain in the ass, encouraging him. He wanted to be extra good today so that Rhodey could perhaps get out of his jail time a little quicker. The dumb ass had struck the vampire after catching him giving him a kiss on the check. Yeah it wasn’t a good idea for a servant to hit a king. The only thing that prevented him from getting executed was Tony.
“ Nana!” Tony turned to see Ultron jog up to the table.
Bucky rolled his eyes. Clint stuck his tongue out at him.
“ Let me see, is it because I offended you somehow? Did I not kiss up enough to you this time around? What is is spangles?”
Rhodey smiled at Maria, “ Mrs. Stark, we are just friends. I’m pretty sure Tony could find someone better than me.”
“Tony, I think it’ll be a good idea if you, Clint and I  discussed some things regarding our resident merman.”
The man sighed. “ Steve will probably want to mount you tonight. That’s the reason why he got you.”
When they finally reached the ground, Tony noticed two things. One: he was being Carried bridal style. Two: Grant had on his compete Hydra attire. Well, fuck that was going to be a PR disaster.
“ Umm... thanks.. you know for what you did.”
“ Peter wait!”
“Well I know that now.”
“ What!? You almost drowned.”
“ Do you really think it’s wise to let him cook our food?” Clint whispered.
They sat in silence for a while. Tony really had no clue where he was. He looked down at his clothes and noticed they were matching Steve’s.
“боишься, что он бросит тебя, как только увидит, что мне лучше?”
I didn’t have a place to stay and we were always real close so I had used her address and I thought it would
“ It’s Fine Your grace,” Tiny interrupted quickly as he sat down on a cushion. He can bed down, thank you very fucking much you fucking bastard. He just wanted to eat and didn’t want hear anymore Bitching.
Tony asked.
I know you don’t  trust us. Whether it is us that remind you about from own universe or maybe it’s just because we are basically strangers, but I can tell you now we won’t hurt you. You don’t have to tell me or anyone else here anything about your past, but we won’t hold it against you. We want you to know that you are safe and we are here for you.”
Peter rolled his eyes. “ You are so corny.”
“No time girl.” Tony threw on the head piece and felt his body being encased with silver metal.
Bruce have a small chuckle, “ I don’t sleep here often. I’m often in Nat’s room.”
Tony motioned him to continue. “ Well?” He whispered impatiently.
Peter didn’t know how long he had been standing there until Wade was in front of him.
“ Why did you join Hydra?” Nat asked.
It wasn’t exactly a lie.
“ Yeah. You told me every night before I went to bed. Is there a reason for you telling me this? Those were just stories. “
“ You hate Spider-Man. Everyone thinks he’s a stupid hero a-and no one likes me...” Peter kept sobbing, his face red and blotchy now.
“And, I doubt anybody’d ever call you ‘helpless,’” Rogers ventured, then added with a cautious smile, “Or ‘
“Mmmm,” Tony mumbled and rolled over, pressing himself up against Steve’s body.   (Oh fuck!)  Steve could feel Tony’s morning erection rubbing against his thigh.  He bit off a little moan.
“Cool.” Tony glanced around. Bruce was almost certainly in his lab, but where--? “Hey, where are the super agents?”
Flustered, outraged, and ashamed, Steve fled.
“Oh, yeah, I’m not that good with kids,” Tony rambled awkwardly, “and this is kind of Steve’s special place, since his best friend grew up here. It was his idea and he’s the one who went out and selected all their presents and wrapped them himself—well, I mean, I tried to help, but it turns out I really su--,er,
“Dr. Banner.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony murmured, stepping closer to hold out the blanket again. “It’s just me.”
Tony had made reservations at the ten most expensive, exclusive restaurants in New York one after another and cancelled all of them in the end.  Happy had the night off, so Tony drove them in the Bentley.  Usually Tony would just double park in front of the restaurant and assume they weren’t going to tow it before he finished with dinner-- his parking tickets had probably funded an entire highway by now--  but Steve frowned on that kind of thing, so he left their wheels in the parking complex a few blocks away.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
“Likewise, Cap,” Tony said, still grinning.  Rogers grinned back.
“You won’t follow.”
Clint slammed the DVD into the drive.
Rhodey snorted. “Probably not.”
And he did.  He may have felt a little silly, with his blue button-down done up, his trousers and underwear around his ankles, and his softening cock exposed to the air and (more troubling) the open bedroom door, but it was okay.  Tony had looped his arms around him and worked a hand up under Steve’s shirt to caress his stomach lightly.  Tony pressed a line of open-mouthed kisses to his neck, then pulled away to drag the duvet around them.  Steve sighed and settled back into Tony’s arms.  He synchronized his breathing to Tony’s, a soothing rhythm of in-out, in-out.  They laid like that for several minutes.
Steve held in a sigh.  He stopped and waited while a young woman walked quickly down the corridor to catch up with him.  She was very beautiful, like a film star, with perfect white teeth, glossy red hair, and a luminous complexion.  Actually, she looked a little like Ms Potts, though her figure was more of an hourglass.  She was built like a pinup girl from back in his day and just as pretty.  The thought made Steve uncomfortable.  He cleared his throat.
“Good boy.”
It was half whisper and half gasp, a small helpless sound of want that Tony instantly wished undone. His brow furrowed. (Off script.) He frowned. (Was he allowed to—)
The Captain took a deep breath and said in an even tone: “I’m sorry. I think you’ve lost me.”
Gratitude forever to thatwhichyields.  Loves you!
“I’d be doubly honored,” Steve answered, then whispered, “I’ve been thinking of nothing else all night. I’ve got something special planned for you tonight, sweetheart.”
“Jesus, Cap! What the fuck?”
Sitting on a giant throne was a thin, frail looking man.  He was dressed in a thick blue robe that looked too big and a simple golden circlet balanced awkwardly on his head.  The throne--massive dark wood, elaborately carved--dwarfed the smiling figure sitting on it. For a moment, Tony thought he was advanced in years, but as he drew closer--keeping his face blank--he realized, to the contrary, the king was quite young: bright blue eyes, elfin cheekbones, pale, snowy skin.
“You think?” Rhodey asked hopefully.
The Agents fought in the perimeter for the most part, while Cap and Tony took hunter duty—speeding after the runaways before they could get to more populous areas, taking them down as fast as possible, then moving on to the next without getting too far from the perimeter.
“Hmph.”
(Go on. Pretend it’s Tony. It’ll be good. He’d like that.)

“You do that, Tony,” Natasha said, her tone amused.
“The boys baked you cookies,” Nat said, clearly amused. “All afternoon. Careful though! Don’t eat any that Tony made!”
The driver was mangling The Shirelles’ sweetly anxious “Will you still love me tomorrow?” as they pulled up to the Tower.  Steve told him to keep the change and gave Tony his hand as they stepped from the cab. It was freezing out; Steve stepped around him to block the wind for the short walk into their private entrance. (Sap.)
“Pep, you’ve lost me.”  Tony squinted at the screen where Pepper was giving him this funny smile.  “Why wouldn’t I want to go?  I mean, besides the obvious ‘high society events are tedious and self-congratulatory’?”
“She does sound pretty great, though, and I’m hard to please,” Tony admitted with a rueful smile. “Apparently she’s a military historian at Columbia. She read Rhodey’s Masters Thesis on the Tuskegee Airmen and wrote him a letter about it so they started nerding out about history and media representation and stuff. Apparently, she only just realized he’s The James Rhodes, as in War Machine, so it’s not like she’s just into the celebrity or whatever. So, uh, yeah. Anyway, looks like Rhodey’s coming for Thanksgiving to see his girl, and his mom’s coming too.”
at Tony, running his eyes up and down the armor, glancing away, then back again.  Uneasy, Tony flipped his face plate down.
“It’s cold in New York! Besides, aren’t you happy to see me? I thought you could use a friend—you know, after Aunt Maggie and all.”
Steve laid caresses on every bit of skin he exposed—Tony’s ass, his flank, his thighs, his knees, his ankles.  With a little nudge he got Tony to step out of his trousers, tossed them aside, then resumed his meticulous explorations.

“... Tell me you at least don’t have a floor in the Tower with Loki’s name on it?” Steve says.
“You drank too much, Tony,” Steve sighed as he brought him up to his room and settled him onto his bed a few minutes later. He took off Tony’s shoes and dropped them onto the floor, despite knowing that he would hear about those
“JARVIS?” Steve says, knowing JARVIS would hear him even over the party’s music and chatter, and the woman smiles, wide and insincere. Steve’s phone buzzes with a text message and even without checking it, Steve suddenly knows what it says. A wisp of her hair curls just above her eyebrow. “Loki.”
“Cheat!” Clint called, grinning. “You’re lucky I want to try this Asgardian mead.” Clint made a
“I didn’t expect you to show up,” Steve says honestly, letting her implications slide off of him because they simply aren’t true and Loki knows it too, “especially not as a woman, though in retrospect” - he gazes at the multitude of invited SHIELD agents throughout the room, who, although Loki is no longer a criminal, would not be amused by her presence - “perhaps that’s a wise move on your part.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, lowering his glass with a grin curling his lips. It dimmed just a little as he caught sight of Steve’s expression. “Hey,” he said, letting go of his glass in favor of cupping Steve’s face with his hand. Steve leaned into it. He wanted to catch Tony’s hand, hold him in his arms, and never let go. “What is it? I’m whole and fine, aren’t I? Not even a wear or tear from it, Steve.”
“And nothing,” she confirms, says again, “with a shitty father and no one who understands. It’s not much, but just enough for a lifetime of scarring and the start of a beautiful friendship.”
“Are you okay?” the father asks, and Steve nods.
“That, sir,” Tony says, leaning down as Steve meets him halfway, “you have a monopoly on.”
Tony grins and says, mock chastising and lecturing, “Captain Rogers, relationships are based on ‘mutual trust and communication’. Lies are a big no-no!” He giggles at the despair on Steve’s face. “I’m just kidding, I do not have a floor in the Tower for Loki. I don’t think we’re at the moving in together stage yet,” he says with a teasing wink, well-aware of how misleading that sounds.
“Please do. I’d ask JARVIS, but I’m not sure how much Tony is willing to share,” Steve said. “Especially of this.”
Loki glances across the room, where Tony is accosted by one of his many guests trying to wish him a happy birthday. Tony smiles dazzlingly and, as much as he looks like he’s enjoying the talk, looks like he’s trying to extricate himself as soon as possible. He looks over and mouths ‘don’t move’ in their direction, before going back to his conversation with his professor he hasn’t seen since MIT days. “Make it quick,” Loki says.
Tony pulled away from Steve to face him fully and look him in the eye. The space that Tony vacated sapped all warmth from him, and Steve held back the instinctive need to pull him back.
There was a snap and when Steve glanced over, he caught a flash of Natasha putting away her camera.
Tony grabbed Steve’s arm just as he was about to leave. “Don’t go,” he said, sitting up, a sad whine in his voice. He pushed his face into Steve’s stomach and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist like a monkey. “Don’t go, Steve.”
Steve still remembers his aimlessness after the battle in Manhattan and the intense relief and gratitude he felt when Tony extended an offer for him to live in the Tower. More than just a place to live, Tony has given him a place to call his own, companionship in the form of the gathered Avengers, and later on, to Steve’s incredible fortune, Tony himself for Steve to share his life with.
Cheers and shouts of Tony’s name rise, drowning everything else out. Tony performs a midair twirl in celebration, eye catching and gorgeous, and in that split-second, Loki teleports ahead of Tony and pulls ahead.
That seems to give Loki a pause, though not for long. “Is that so?” she says, tilting her head to the side. “And you approve, Captain?”
of you are traitors. It’s my birthday! You’re all a Level 5 hazard to my health now,” he declares.
Bruce looked down at their joined hands, startled, and then back at Thor, who held his gaze warmly and earnestly with just the faintest trace of trepidation, and then Bruce nodded. “It would be my honor, Thor.”
“To the private jet!” Thor exclaimed, despite having no idea what that meant. He knocked glasses with Clint.
Her words spread and transmit a few feet radius around her and then in no time, like a rapid game of telephone, Tony’s name echoes across the entire stadium like a tidal wave. It feels like the entire stadium rises at once as the crowd rushes forward to peer down at the race track, everyone elbowing each other out of the way in an attempt to catch a glimpse of Tony to confirm his presence for themselves.
Steve looked up at JARVIS for confirmation.
Tony taps the button on his chest for the Iron Man suit, and Loki rolls his neck in a stretch.
Thor smiled. “All is forgiven, my friend,” he said, and Bruce’s smile warmed. Thor’s gaze flickered to their joined hands, which Bruce seemed to have yet notice Thor had yet to let go, and Thor voiced only after a moment of hesitation, “If it is all right with you, Bruce, may I have the honor of keeping your hand as per the custom of Midgard -- Earth?”
“You just want to build your own stand mixer and connect it to your AI, Stark,” Loki says, just as his gaze drops. Steve pulls his foot back, half in plain sight from his abortive move towards Tony prior, and Loki smiles. It’s disconcerting to see a smile grow increasingly insincere even as it widens. “Your knight on a bike is back,” Loki says, canting his head towards Steve.
“Oooh, I got it!” Tony said excitedly, and Steve turned to him with an indulgent smile. “I got it!  Never have I ever said goodbye to my father before he died!”
A hint of baked sugar wafts over to Steve when he stops by Tony’s floor after an afternoon ride through New York City. Steve invited Tony to come along with him earlier that morning, but Tony mumbled something about having plans later and then promptly buried his face back into his pillow after telling Steve to have fun. So baking was the plan.
“Good,” he says, closing his hand around Tony’s, “because I’m never letting go.”
