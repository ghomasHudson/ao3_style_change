She opened the fridge with a thoughtful hum, taking the juice from the fridge and turned around, only to blink when she saw a doll sitting on the counter gazing at her. Natasha shivered at how the porcelain doll looked a little bit like her with the red hair and green eyes, though the doll had half of its face broken, and the white dress she was wearing was drenched with a red substance.
. He never ever wanted Tony to change, he was just tired and in pain and he wanted to let his anger and pain and hurt loose, and Tony; Tony was the victim of that, the first one Steve saw after the heartbreaking news he received. Steve has long since stopped looking up to the future, afraid that if he let his son slip from his sight just for a second that will be it, and Steve was going to lose him; but Tony, Tony always looked up to the future, he always gave him hope. If Tony stopped looking to the future, then who will give Steve the strength to move on?
After that day, Steve can say that he wasn't feeling as well as he wanted to, a trip to Bruce's office with his husband informed him that it was normal at the beginning of pregnancy to become forgetful and sometimes have misleading memories, something about all those hormones shifting and changing. Steve, he was feeling guilty and a little sad for how he nearly accused his husband of breaking his promise to him, though, the Alpha only shook it off with a laugh, and start talking about doing a digital diary if Steve was going to be that forgetful, which did get a small smile from the Omega.
No matter how much the Alpha reassured the Omega he loved him and that he will stay with them every date night the two of them had which so far was only two dates, but the Alpha hoped to change the Omega's mind because the Alpha knows that he could no longer live without his Omega and son, the Alpha was tired of going to the penthouse every day by the end of the day, staring at the empty place hoping that Steve and Peter were there with him to cheer him up.
"Yeah, she is… she is going to be a heartbreaker… and a troublemaker just like her brothers," Steve said after pausing a little, which did nothing but gain a happy chuckle from Tony, for he already knew what his husband meant by that… they are already outnumbered with both Peter and Harley, add a little girl to the mix would be a nightmare, especially when she would probably charm anyone into believing her innocent… it would be a nightmare… a beautiful nightmare that Tony want and long for.
When Tony reached the gym he blinked his eyes when he saw Thor sitting in the corner while hugging his knees, rocking himself back and forth while sucking his thumb as he sniffled, letting out whimpers now and then as he shook in his place… how the mighty have fallen… the rest of his teammates were surrounding Thor, trying to snap the whimpering man out of it, but the thing is, when Bruce pulled the man's thumb away, he was greeted by an ear-piercing scream, that caused Bruce to jump back and for Clint to return Thor's thumb in his mouth, which seemed to shut the man up.
"So where did you two go to? I can't imagine that you will take so long as to return the next morning." Natasha asked her eyes were cold and hard as they took Tony in, making the genius wince and tried to back away when he saw Pepper tilt her head in confusion. In the back of his mind, Tony begged Rogers not to take the bait that Natasha throw; Tony was so going to die…
Tony couldn't help but let out a keen, shaking as he was getting closer and closer to finishing than his husband. Tony couldn't help the noises that were leaving him and they seemed too beautiful to Steve for his Alpha had to hold his growl every time he saw Tony getting more lost in euphoria. Tony's quivering thighs couldn't help but tighten up around Steve's waist, not letting the Alpha have any room to pull away from him, which did nothing but caused Steve to groan and thrust deeply, pulling a keening gasp from Tony as his mate hit his prostate. "R… R-right there, Alpha!" Tony moaned, holding tightly to Steve, shivering when his Alpha let out a dark growl and speed up. "Please! Knot me, knot me…" Tony whimpered softly to his mate before hiding his face in Steve's neck; Tony was slicker and slicker with each thrust and his husband had to pull and push more to have his body accept him. "Alpha…" Tony whimpered, already feeling closer and closer to finishing with each second that passes.
He opened the door and his breath hitches as he saw Steve, he was lying on the sofa, singing like he doesn't have a care in the world, his voice was so beautiful; when Steve turned to him he smiled gently making Clint's heart pound in his chest, as he enters the room and closes the door after himself…
"Papa…" Peter said as he gave a big yawn which made Tony stiffen his chuckle at that and kiss the pup's forehead, then standing up, stretching for a little bit and turning his head to the pup who was making grapy hands at him which made the Omega chuckle and carry the pup in his arms, going to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face.
after coughing and covering his face he returned to look at the dark hole, only to see a set of stairs going down…
As much as Starkad wanted to tell his babe to stay with Braes, his son followed him, sending him angry looks that shut Starkad, for deep down, Starkad knew that this was partly if not all his fault, and if the foolish Omega never wakes up after today, not only his son will blame him for the rest of his life, but he will have an orphaned child who will resent him and seek revenge for being the cause of his mother's death, and let's not forget the headache of the Omega's followers that will plan his death like it was nothing.
When one of his hands finally moved, Steve nearly shouted in victory, after a long time and finally, his hand was moving! Too slow to his liking, Steve managed to move his hand to his stomach, panting as he did that. The sensation that greeted Steve made him pause; trying to make sense of it before he lost his mind, because surely, what he was feeling was not right at all, right?
After the earth-shattering kiss, Steve and Tony shared; the inventor couldn't believe his luck, the breath left his lungs as Steve bestow another kiss upon his lips followed by another one. A kiss turned to two, turned to three, and then turned to many kisses until Tony said enough was enough and dragged Steve away from the gala. It wasn't like it was the first time that Tony ditched the gala to do something, and it won't be the last, but Tony had a feeling this time that Pepper won't mind him doing this, especially when before he left Pepper to send him a cheeky smile and a wink. This only informed Tony of how much teasing he will get when he was going to leave his room today, but thinking about it did nothing but making a huge smile stretch his lips.
It ends up with him seeing Rhodey after two years and a half, and for the older Alpha to hug him tightly, telling him how proud he was of him. He met Carol Rhodey's fiancé, a fierce Beta in the air force like him, their wedding was in three months, and believe it or not, he was the best man.
"This weather? Do not insult me, foolish king, I may have lived in the south, but before that, I lived in Asgard, and weather like this is just springtime there… too warm to handle." The Omega complained, twisting his hair around until a small ball formed on top of the Omega's head; Anton though could only twitch, too warm? What kind of crazy place was Asgard that weather like this is considered warm? Well, at least it would explain why Thor always drops on the side of the roads and complaining about dying and going to Valhalla in the summertime.
"Shut up, he is not my mate, he is my son's neighbor that's all, and he needed help with his son." Tony said as he shifted from leg to leg, trying to will himself to stop with the blushing already, he thought that his answer will stop Darcy from asking any more questions, but the woman looked at him like a shark who smelled blood.
"He really did it…" The older Alpha said with a cruel smile on his face. "He really fooled you into believing that he was a Carbonell." The Alpha snorts as he took out a small card from his wallet and throws it at Steve making the Omega flounder to catch it, but it ends up falling in the end… "Read this boy." Steve glared at the man as he picked up the card from the floor, it was an ID.
"Mommy!" Peter called out, his whining intensifying when by the second when it seemed that Bucky won't let go of him; which caused Steve's lips to twitch up and let go of Bucky, rushing toward his baby who seemed better than he was a few days ago.
Opening his eyes after such pleasant dreams always left him drained and hollow on the inside, more so after a Hiti or as the Southern calls it 'Heat', not something new to him, after all, it had been like this ever since he was taken from his land by the king of Hydra, he did not know how long he had been here, but he was sure it was more than a decade. He let out a tired sigh as he pushed his cover and sat on the bed, looking around the room with distaste showing clearly on his face, if it was up to him, he would have burned the whole castle to the ground and everyone with it, but as it stands, a lot of good people here were taken from their home and were forced to work under the tyrant that called himself a king.
"Rise…" Odin ordered in a booming voice which made all of the Avengers stand up and look at the man/king/God? "As you all know the reason I summon you here, is because of the traveler and the ominous news he bought with him from his universe." Odin started turning his face to Steven as he said those words, making Steven raise his head higher at that. "Tell us son of Sarah, what have you witness in your universe?" Odin said which made Steven narrow his eyes at the old man.
It would have been a heroic story if Steven didn't die. Steven Grant Rogers as the articles stated was a good man, a kind man, he was a good son and a good friend, and cared about his town and the people living in it. Steven Grant Rogers who always stood for what was right and pursue justice no matter what were the consequences, even when the kid ended up with a broken arm because of the bullies that followed him, who pushed him down and stole from him… a kid, when Tony gazed at his picture he couldn't help but let out a sob; the kid (He was just like a kid) was nothing but a scrawny kid that was ninety bound soaking wet, and that was the nicest description Tony can come up with, the kid looks like he was thirteen years old instead of eighteen as he smiled happily at the picture.
"You are alive and you a-re my…" Tony let his words trail, getting a nod from Steve, which made the Omega lean on his bed. "I saw my parents, they weren't dead, right?" Tony's voice cracked, he looked at Steve who paused and gives Tony the newspaper to read. The Omegas lips wobbled as he read about the Starks reappearance a year after their supposed death. By the end, tears were running down Tony's face, it made Steve tear up, suddenly Tony turn to him with fear. "My baby! Oh, God, where is my baby?" Tony nearly screamed, making Steve move fast to calm the Omega.
"I missed you so much…" Steve whispered between silent sobs and groans, his nails scraping Tony's back. It's easy for Tony to feel his pain because he feels the same, his chest aching from longing even though Tony is right there with him.
They start looking at him with so much caution and concern that it made Tony shake on the inside, afraid that they discovered his secret, the disgusting secret that kept him awake at night, sweating in fear. After that, Tony stopped; he stopped talking about Ty, he stopped sleeping in Peggy's house, because the woman sure as hell doesn't need him disturbing her calm life with her husband. Tony forced himself to stop flinching and start smiling; he forced himself to leave what happened a month ago in the past, even when he has the ultimate evidence on his body that backed his words.
"It won't, sweetheart; I won't allow it, nothing bad would happen, I am here," Steve whispered, holding Tony tightly and refusing to let him go trying to calm him mate before Tony started thinking unnecessary things and panicked. Personally, Steve won't mind having another child; a baby that was part of him and part of Tony sounded like a dream come true. In the end, it was Tony's choice, and so far, Tony was terrified by the idea of getting pregnant, fearing that the baby would end up having the same fate as Tony's first child. For Steve, it may have been irrational fear, but he knew that for Tony, the Omega was terrified by that thought; that's why the two of them never talked about having a child of their own. Adoption, they talked about it, they even talked about fostering children; but when it came to having their own baby, Tony became a mess, that's why the two of them postponing this conversation as much as they can…
So what if Tony kissed Pepper Potts? What if he did more than that with her? Steve should have been grateful that Tony let him be in their home and didn't raise his hand on him. Steve should have been just like his mother, he should have listened to her advice and just kept his head down, letting his husband do what he wants if it meant that he would return home to Steve and his daughter. His mother done the same thing with his father, and the two of them stayed married until she died; even when it hurt both her and Steve, the two of them managed to get by until Steve went to college. Why should Steve be any different? Why did he decide to open his big mouth and argue with Tony about a stupid kiss if it would have ended up like this?
Personally, Nebula would have preferred to be away from all of this madness, away from Thanos, away from the war, and away from the Ancient One, that Nebula couldn't help but petty for the dark fate waiting for him in Thanos' delusional grip. Not for the first time, a spark of envy light inside Nebula as she remembered her sister Gamora and how she managed to escape Thanos' clutch while Nebula was still slaving away like a dog, trying to save herself every second. Another part, a small part inside Nebula's heart couldn't help but feel a little betrayed, betrayed with how her sister escaped and left her to rot away beside Thanos without even helping her or reaching out to her.
Bright, bright, brighter… Steve made sure to shine as bright as he can, ignoring the shrieks and screams and cries of pain that was heard around him, ignoring how his core and magic was burning everything and anything that it came in contact with; only those who were blessed or had a lucky star watching over them would survive. Everyone closed their eyes tightly to protect themselves, trying to Shield their vision of the brightness that burned and burned.
"Ha-ha, laugh all you want, see if I'm going to make you breakfast today for this stupid prank." Steve said as he gazed at his Alpha who was leaning on the wall for support, continuing with his laughter, especially now that Steve's face turned red from embarrassment.
"Yes!" Steve almost shouted, just to show Tony that yes, he desperately wants him, and they should probably move before the heat hit fully which then meant that the two of them will be too out of it.
Steve took the small present box from the table, gazing at it with a little sadness and equal part anger, wondering why Tony would lie to him after promising that he will come, and to rub the salt on the wound, the Alpha hadn't even called or sent a text to inform him that he will be late, a complete radio silence… Steve deflate like a balloon when after checking his phone for the hundred times that day, he didn't see any missing calls or texts, making the blond wonder if he should bag the dinner in the fridge, considering that he has no appetite for today has vanished.
The sound of the AI made everyone jump and look at the ceiling. "You do?" Bucky asked with hitched breath not believing his ears, does JARVIS really knows where Steve was, his heart was pounding in his chest at the thought.
As for Rogers the man wasn't even looking at him, he was looking away from Tony like just the thought of facing him was repulsive, if you counted the displeasure shining in his face as anything to go by. "Are you done? I would like to return to my room soon." Rogers stated, and God, if Tony wasn't angry before, he was sure as hell angry now.
Pepper… well, Pepper had wanted to stay with him, fearing that he will relapse somehow, but Tony knew that he couldn't be in anyone's presence right now, he even begged the woman to just leave him alone for a precious few days, he just wanted a few days for himself, and he promised himself that when the time was over, he will leave his house and smile and try to pretend that nothing happened that everything was OK, but he just needed few days to do that…. Thankfully the Beta gave him his few days, which turned into weeks, which turned into a whole month of Tony doing nothing but staying in his lab working, sometimes sleeping if exhaustion took over his body, and he was forced to eat by Pepper who always come to check on him.
Jamti gave his friend a sad look, knowing the reason why his friend refused to marry and bear the whispers and sneer that sent his way all these years; as much as it broke Jamti's heart that he will give his friend the bad news, someone has to tell him that enough is enough, it was the time that Anton starts taking the threats of the elders seriously. "I know, Anton, I know, that is why Magna and I have spent the last few weeks fighting for your right to choose; you were granted the choice of who you mate." Jamti's soft tone caused Anton to look up at his friend, the fight leaving both Anton and Jamti when they saw the tiredness swimming in each other's eyes.
"I should have known…" Steven murmured, a soft smile taking over his lips, though his eyes became distant and sad, causing Tony to shift toward the star in concern. "You were always kind and forgiving… I wonder since when I start forgetting that…" Steven looked at his feet with a sad smile, causing Tony to shift in his place in discomfort this time.
"'s OK…" The small boy whisper, causing Tony's eyes to widen, for this was the first time Harley spoke to Tony directly. "Peter told me that you are a good Omega… not a bad one." At that, Harley glances up before pursing his lips and looking down once more. "He said that you and Mr. Steve are gonna get married soon, and you will become his Mama from now on... that's nice… congratulation?" Harley sounded so confused as he said those words, causing a smile to twitch on Tony's lips; the boy was so precious! He now knew why Steve was attached to the small boy, he sounded just like Peter when Tony first met him.
Tony took a deep breath as he looked at his house… the house that he brought so that he will start a new life with his baby, only for him to lose the child long before he was able to hold him in his arms. The Omega closed his eyes tightly and leaned on the wheel, taking deep breaths before the urge to scream became stronger.
If only Tony can leave this place and accept Rhodey and Pepper's offer; Tony though, knows that if he showed his face anywhere near his friends or near anyone who knows his father it will be the end. Not only will Howard lock Tony away for the rest of his life to marry him to the next person who will pay more than Stane, but he will also get rid of Morgan, in the most painful way possible while making Tony watch (Tony still remembered the cat he owned when he was just a kid; he still remember how Howard run it over when he disobeyed him) And if Howard knew about his Mom involvement in helping him escape, God's only know what he will do to her.
"But… but you said it yourself. Tha… the purple grape villain will stop at nothing to have Mr. Steve as his bride!" Peter huffed at those words, and Tony, Tony had to stop himself from laughing until his sides hurt; 'The Purple Grape Villain'? The Avengers will have the delight of their lives when they are going to hear that name.
Thankfully Peggy and Bucky seemed on board with helping Steve not embarrass himself more than he will if he dared to dance with Tony. That was the start of Steve's two weeks of beginner's guide to ballroom dance, which so far ended with Steve feeling like an idiot and Bucky complaining about having sore feet, which caused Steve to feel guilty and offer him a foot rub. The foot rub offer always ended up with Peggy smacking Bucky and warning Steve about Bucky taking advantage of his kindness… these two were strange.
It was a few minutes of coughing and hacking and for Jarvis to try and air the kitchen before Tony managed to look up, glaring with his teary eyes at Loki who was smirking mischievously. A groan behind Loki pulled Tony's attention from the God, and Tony's eyes couldn't help but widen in shock, this time the tears that clouded his eyes were not from the green mist, but because of the person who was leaning on the wall clutching his head in pain. "Steve!" Tony cried out, running toward Steve, hoping against hope that this was not a cruel dream he was seeing, that Steve was here with him.
him and not like the usually courting of these days that ended up with a quick fuck and heartbreak on the Omega's side with nothing but a pup for a reminder of broken dreams, no the Alpha was really interested in him… like really, really… for a lifetime really.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness a lot of it, a near-death experience, and Tony losing his mind, and finally! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated....
… was the mantra that repeated inside Steve's head, but Peter's happy laughter made the Omega let out a huff after all this was for Peter, not him.
The woman though only raised her eyebrow at him. "So he was talking about me…" She murmured to herself, and no, Tony defiantly didn't see the creepy smile taking over her face, or how her eyes sparkled creepily. "Tell you what normal; you really have the guts to shoo a witch, something that any other witch will curse you for." The woman grins darkly, and Tony was so sure her face will split in two with how wide she was grinning. "But you are interesting, I will give you that, as interesting as a chew toy." The woman walked until she was standing in front of him, her eyes glimmering with danger. "If you break his heart, I will rip yours and eat it, got it?" She snarled, causing a shiver of fear to go down Tony's spine, but he steeled himself and glared at the woman.
"That's sweet but tough…" Tony said tried not to be awkward which he was failing at twenty out of ten, God, this was embarrassing! Here he was walking with the ultimate Alpha to ever Alpha, and he was acting like an awkward teen who didn't know what to do! Tony was sure that the Alpha was probably thinking that he was a danger to his pup. "So how are you and your mate finding it in America? I am sure it's tough moving from country to another." Tony said as he kept a sharp eye on the pup, hoping that the pup will not run away, it was obvious that the man and his pup were from another country especially with the English accent the pup sport, but the Alpha beside him stiffened at the mention of mate which made Tony turn his eyes to the Alpha.
Bucky's joyful voice made Steve snapped out of whatever dark thought he was spiraling to… blinking his eyes, Steve looked around the place hoping to catch Bucky, only to find that he was alone and that Bucky was nowhere near him.
"No, baby, no, your Papa is a good man… He is Captain America… who are you going to trust if you can't trust Captain America?" Tony whispered to the shaky boy, hating himself for causing the confusion and pain that shone in his baby's eyes. He hated himself for thinking that things could go back to normal after what he did, he hated the rift he caused between his baby, Alpha, and himself… But the thing that he hated the most was Stane and how big the man's hold on him was even when they were miles and miles apart. Tony could just have as destroyed the only good thing that was in his life ever since he was free from Stane's hold…
And her spouse, Bucky Barnes, and what kind of names is Bucky or Peggy? Steven is still struggling to figure out. So far no luck. And there we have the birdbrain who prefers to put on too many purple, still irritating, not much to be told about him because Mrs. Carter warned him to stay away from Steven. Then we have the redheaded woman whose name turned out to be Natasha. Not that Steven was introduced to the woman who seemed visible one second and invisible the next. Then we have Dr. Banner who by far was the most rational and reasonable one out of them, the calmest even, Steven doesn't mind spending most of his time with the friendly doctor if only Tony doesn't spend most of his walking time beside the doctor. There was also Thor, but the man ceased being as irritating as when he met Steven for the first time, Steven at least trained him out of panicking every time Steven let out a groan of exasperation. And not to overlook how Steven was transferred from the tower he was in when they arrived into a mansion deep in the woods that Tony owned, something about being prepared to protect him here entirely, with no causalities, causing Steven to roll his eyes hard.
"Need something, sweetheart?" The rough edge to Steve's voice is gone, schooled back into place by his steadier husk. The one Tony usually calls his commander's voice; it always ended up making Tony feel hot and bothered when he listen to that voice. "You need my knot, Tony, is that it?" Steve croon causing Tony's breathing to hitch
Speaking about sanity, Steve didn't know why, but he raised the paper to his nose and sniffed it a little, and the paper fell from his hand at the realization… that faint scent… it was the same scent that the Omega in the park had, the same scent that made Peter purr when he smelled it on the toy… suddenly, his meeting with the Omega today made more sense, the toy he carried, Peter telling him about the Omega crying, and the Omega looking so tired and haggled… everything took a turn to something darker, and it made Steve raise the paper to read the words again, his heartbreaking a little at the thought…
"Is Tony OK now?" Peter asked in a small voice which made Steve give a tired sigh at that and hold his son tightly as he rocked him gently.
"Mr. Steve…?" A small voice questioned, and Steve turned shakily behind him, to see Peter standing there, looking afraid but happy at the same time. "Mr. Steve!" Peter let out a sob and rushes toward Steve, hugging him tightly around the waist.
It started with Tony being terrified of his pregnancy, trying to deny the baby he was going to have desperately; it ended with Tony finally gathering the courage and going inside the one room in his home that stayed closed for years and years. Going inside the room, the hurt and nostalgia took hold of him as his eyes took the room, smiling sadly when he saw how clean and tidy the room was, no doubt thanks to Steve who always took care of this room when Tony was too wired up to even go inside.
How hard can it be? Tony asked himself as he marched to his workshop, planning on doing it in his lab, the fear of Steve waiting for him in the gym is too high for Tony to consider going there; Tony really doesn't need his blood pressure going through the roof too, he already has enough on his plate. Tony come prepared though, he came prepared with a yoga mat, sports drinks, everything! Again how hard can yoga be? You just have to repeat a few poses and stay in them for a little amount of time before moving on to the next pose, easy! Pepper always tried to make him do yoga, so it was no harm in trying, especially when yoga seemed to calm Pepper down, maybe it will help calm him a little, and if it didn't work then Tony will move on and try another thing, no harm done.
Steven said with a smile, which made everyone's eyes widen like they could not believe what their ears were hearing.
Tony's eyes could only widen in fear and terror, thinking that the people who dragged Steve outside the closet had found him and Morgan. Tony couldn't hold back a cry of fear as his free hand tried to find something to defend Morgan with. Fear clawed Tony's heart, and his heart skipped a beat when his hand came across a heavy book; Tony doesn't know what he was going to do, he only saw the shadows getting closer and closer, and Tony feared that they were going to drag him to the lake and drown him with Steven Rogers, what are they going to do to his baby when he dies?
A few seconds will tick by on the digital display, Tony usually will gaze at that clock hoping that time will run faster and that his time with the doctor will end so that he may leave and never think about this session like he did the others, but he already knows that he was lying to himself, that he will think about this hour over and over again dissecting every small detail when he was back in the safety of his lab, or in the boxing ring when he will scream at the Alpha to attack harder, only for the Alpha to frown and then hold him, never caring about Tony breaking down and crying on his chest after.
"Go to hell, I will never be yours!" A snarl leaving Steve's bloody lips but it did nothing but turn into a choked whimper when the titan tightened his hand around Steve's neck. Anger clouded the titan's face, and he took one of Steve's arms and twits it hard, causing Steve to scream in pain. Tony let out a cry of terror when he heard the sound of the bones snap every time Steve repeated his refusal to the titan's proposal, and in the end, it ended with Steve's heart being ripped out; Tony tried to run, tried to save Steve, to scream, to do anything, but everything turned white once more, leaving Tony shaken to the bones.
"You are married?" Now Tony really felt like shit, not only did he borrow the rings without permission and damaging them, but the owner in question made them from his Shield for his husband who was probably waiting for the super soldier in his universe.
"Husband?" Carter hissed, turning his harsh gaze from Tony to Steve, and Tony could only gulp when he saw her squeezing the present box so tightly that the wrapping papers nearly ripped from the pressure. "I left for a short while and you already start cheating on me with some floozy and getting him pregnant!" Carter screamed, nearly throwing the present box at Tony if it wasn't for Steve standing in front of him protectively, and catching the box.
"What's your name?" Rogers asked when his eyes fell on the inventor taking a step after step towards Tony, and the brunette wondered why he didn't already back away like his life depended on it, but as always Tony was stubborn as hell, so he stood his ground and glared into Rogers' eyes, which apparently was a mistake, because the man's eyes shined at that, and unfortunately Tony couldn't see the rest of his face curtesy of the Winter Soldier mask that hide the rest of the blond's face that the man didn't seem to want to take off.
As the time passed, Anthony realized that he stop responding to the name Stark, as the time passed he realized his wish to be Anthony Carbonell and not a Stark, it made Anthony pause and thing, he will daydream and fantasies about him and Steve living far away from here, he fantasy about a home that had a little lab for him, and a studio for Steve, he will dream of the small footsteps running in the hallways and the laughter that will follow, he will dream of opening his own business away from this draining work, away from Howard and Stane, and he always see Steve smiling proudly at him, maybe he will open his own garage? Away… away from this painful life, creating the perfect one with Steve, having their own home, their own family, with his mother, aunt Peggy, Jarvis, and his wife in them, away from Howard and Stane's poisonous influence.
Betty's sobs made Tony close his eyes, counting from ten to one and repeating the process while taking deep breathes, hoping that he will calm himself and not start shouting at the poor Beta because of a fit of misleading anger. "OK… OK, calm down Betty, calm down and tell me what happened. Please…" Tony breathed out his eyes not leaving the boy who was rubbing his eyes with his fists and yawning ready to go to sleep any second now.
"It is rude to ask an Omega about their age, everyone knows that, but considering that you are nothing if not a rude person my age is 32 summers…" The queen reply, which made the king frown and snorted into his cup, it seems that the Alpha spoke too soon, the Omega was infuriating.
"Very well, your highness." The leader spoke, catching the room by surprise, and Steven could feel the relief coming from everyone, but Steven just shook and brought his son closer to him, hiding his child's face, even when the pup turned his head to look. "Unfortunately for you, for your disrespect, you do not deserve my name, but I am sure you have heard of me, The Iron King they call me…" Steven couldn't hear the rest of the king's speech, his blood left his face at the name he heard, the Iron King a name Steven hoped to never hear of, a legend who awoke seven years ago recruiting only the strongest out there, burning the Christians down to the ground, leaving no one alive, they don't force themselves on the Omegas, they do worse, they kill their children in front of them and gave them the knife to finish themselves… they take no hostages, no slaves… no nothing…
Steve blinked his eyes, his mind wandering to the small box under his bed, hiding under a loose floorboard, a box that contains all of the drawings Steve draw for the man in his two weeks stay at the hospital, drawings that were writing on the back of one of them
It had been a tough couple of weeks for Clint; he couldn't believe what took place just a couple of weeks ago, he was still trying to wrap his mind around it, but one thing was true and that it was all Tony's fault! If only he wasn't Steve's love interest and cast a spell at him to gain his love, this wouldn't have happened at all! But as always, Tony middle with things and caught Steve's eyes, which not only led to Steve loving him, but it also led to his friends nearly dying from the horror they were subject to! First, it was Nat two weeks ago, then Thor four days ago, God he hoped that Tony will be the next; at least then Clint will know if it was really love or that Steve was angry at Tony and was taking in on them.
The feeling of pride, gratefulness, and elation lasted only a second in Starkad's heart, because suddenly the queen froze in his place, and fell to his side, still frozen unmoved, Starkad gazed at the scene with wide eyes, when he noticed the bloody blade in Hamar's hands and the cruel smile on his face. Suddenly an enraged roar shook the place causing everyone who was gazing at the brawl to freeze, and it was only a second before Starkad realized that the roar came from him, but by then that didn't matter, for Starkad was already descending upon Hamar, making sure to break his face with the strongest punches he was throwing, for he was not holding back anything.
When he was back home; Tony shook away all the thoughts about his lucky star, deciding to call it a coincidence or hell a glitch. Then he starts making the armor, he wanted to right the wrongs he did, to sit everything right like how he promised Yinsen, but what he really wanted was something as a reminder of the warmth he felt in that desert, and he thought that the armor was it.
"Tony, Tony, look at this!" Peter said, finally getting bored with the adults talking and ignoring him and finally decided to butt in, which was cute, as Tony chuckle and turn his sight to the boy, only to see a cute chocolate brown bear with a red bow tied around its neck, Tony's lips twitched up before he gave the bear a kiss on the nose, which made Peter gasp in betrayal, followed a small throaty laugh that Steve let.
Tony wondered to himself if he was going to start crying any minute now because there was no way… just no way, that Stane and his father already knew about his plan, no way! Tony's lips start trembling at that and he was sure there were tears in his eyes by this point, and the teen wouldn't care if he starts crying, because his dream was just turned into dust once again by his father and Stane, he can't go to Atlanta now, not after Stane buying a cabin there, it doesn't matter if there were a million others there, he can't be seen by Stane or his father!
Tony didn't know what took over him, but he ends up in Steve's embrace holding tightly to the Alpha, trying to keep his sobs quiet last he woke his baby who was dozing happily in the Alpha's arm…
tell me, were you ever going to tell me that he died thirty years ago? Were you ever going to tell me that Ty and Stane were real or were you just going to let me think that I went crazy? What action you made for me since I start living in this damn house spell out the word 'safety!" Tony ignored the guilty look that crossed his ex-friends' faces; they have no right to do that, no right to look at him with pain in their eyes when they were the ones who nearly caused him and his daughter to die several times. "Morgan died… my baby died because of you… she died because of the secrets you hide, I nearly died because of the secrets you continued to hide! Tell me, is this what it meant me being safe?" Tony's lips trembled as he tried to contain his sobs, he was so, so tired, so tired… Tony wanted to go home, but the thing was he doesn't know where his home was anymore.
Maybe it was a trick of the light, maybe he was sleep-deprived, maybe he was going crazy. No, Tony was sure after counting and recounting them; Natasha has eight eyes. Tony could only tilt his head and let out a stupid 'Huh' already knowing that Steve has reached Natasha a long time ago, because if he didn't, Tony wouldn't have been looking at a spider-Natasha glaring at him; in the back of Tony's mind, the genius couldn't help but think that it was fitting.
And finally when the party nearly winded down Steve and Tony sneaked away from their friends and family, wanting to have their alone time; both of them vibrating with anticipation and longing, for tonight it will be the night the two of them will finally dare to touch each other in the way the two of them longed for, for two years now.
; it hasn't happened for five centuries, and it never will! The ones who did that were punished severely, they were disowned from the family, had their possessions seized, and were banished far away from their spouses." Serpentine stated causing Tony to blink his eyes at Serpentine words… OK, this was the first time Tony heard that the Addams had laws of their own… and it was kinda reassuring to hear that. "If an Addams raised their hand it meant they broke their vows and marriage, so it's within their spouses' right to get rid of them in any way they desire; so it was within my right to kill Joseph. It's also within your right to kill or divorce your husband
"This is Yggdrasil." Steven said after he added the final touch to the drawing, smiling happily when his son missed up saying the Yggdrasil's name a few times, a pout taking over his face when he failed for the fifth time. "No love, it is called Yggdrasil, Y-gg-dra-sil." Steven said the word slowly, chuckling when his son grin happily when he was able to say the word. "Yggdrasil, the tree of life, its branches stretch out over all of the nine worlds." Steven said as he draws a small nine oval shapes waving themselves in the branches. "This is Niflheim, the world of mist." Steven said as he pointed on one of the ovals. "Muspelheim, land of lava. Asgard, home of the Gods and Goddess, their supreme ruler 'Odin' lives there. Midgard, our home the mortal realm. Jotunheim, the home of the giants. Vanaheim, the land of sorcery and magic, and Odin's wife and the queen Frigga is from that realm. Alfheim, the land of the light elves. Svartalfheim, the home of the dwarves. And Helheim, the land of the dead." Steven explains to his son, smiling when his child 'Oh' and 'Ah' as he gazes at the drawing with wide eyes.
Tony sang under his breath as he took Steve’s folded shirts, placing them in their place, ready to turn around until something strange caught his eyes. It wasn’t actually something significant, nor was it visible, it was just Steve’s leather jacket, even Tony didn’t recognize what the different thing that captured his eyes, after all, he saw that jacket over and over repeatedly, he even asked Steve to wear it for him a few times, because he loves the way his Alpha looked in it.
"You say dangerous, but I have the feeling that you meant stupid." Steven said as he tried to think about the first part of her speech, what does she mean by destroying the flow of time? The woman smiled at that instead of only her lips twitching a look of amusement took over her face.
His question caused the doctor to give him a soft smile, probably she already felt his tiredness and pain, and she knew that he was on his last nerve. "Of course, Mr. Rogers; in fact, little Peter is doing great! I even suspect that today or at least tomorrow his fever will break." The doctor gave him a reassuring smile that Steve didn't know what to do other than give her a dull smile, before turning around returning to Peter's room.
"Yes, it's great." Tony hummed at that nodding his head as he turned toward Steve with a smile pasted on his lips. "Though I couldn't help but wonder, who are the Parkers? I never met them before, and I practically met every one of your friends, even that scary Natasha, which by the way I am still angry at her for arresting me, even if she was an undercover FBI." Tony rambled hoping that his words will distract the Alpha from his real goal.
The next time Tony woke up, he felt tired and drained, he felt like the world was against him, like any minute now he was going to fall apart and there will be no one to catch him, he was tired, he was so, so tired, always getting his hopes up only for them to be dashed when they are not even fully developed. Today when Tony woke up with Steve holding him tightly in his arms, hiding him away from the cruel world, Tony made an oath to himself, a promise that he will forget all about the child that destroyed his life, an oath that no matter how much everyone told him about his child that died, Tony wouldn't care about what he heard, he wouldn't get his hopes up, he will completely forget about that wretched parasite that destroyed his already fragile life.
"It's a little late, don't you think?" Steve said with a sarcastic tone, which only made Tony swallow. "You know, I promised myself that the first thing I will do once I see you will be punching you in your perfect teeth, but the thing is… you are not worth it… not anymore." Steve said looking at Tony giving him a once over before looking at his side. "Goodbye, Mr. Stark." With that Steve turned and starts walking away.
"What do you mean?" Peggy said with a shaky voice, it was shocking, too much shock to see Steven sleeping peacefully one minute, and the next he was having a seizure on the bed, it was even more of a shock when that strange woman came through the portal and offered them help, not only that, but she also told them that this Steven who had been with them for over two months now was nothing but a soul in a temporary body, a soul whose body was still in his universe, until today when Steven decided that he had chosen their world and let his body die.
Short I know, I thought about including their travel to Asgard in this chapter too, but then it will be too long, and I kinda want their trip to Asgard to be its own chapter.
"The thing is you don't have to! Working three jobs isn't healthy for you, nor is it healthy for Peter when you only see him once a week for a few hours! What if something happened to you, what would happen to Peter then?" Tony plea with the Omega which made the blond hiss at him, clenching his fist on the inhaler to stop himself from throwing it at Tony's head, which was hard not to do. "Please, if not for yourself then think about Peter, please." Tony plea which made the Omega sigh and runs his head through his hair.
The universe that Steven came from is the MCU universe, it followed the movies from the start of CA: TFA to Avengers: Endgame, if you read the first chapter you will notice the changes I made in Endgame that affected the universe Steven is from. In that universe, Steven's Shield was indeed destroyed, though you will have to read the story to find out :D
A hand shot out and took a hold of the front of his suit pulling him down, Steve's breath left him as he regains his balance only to gaze at the Omega's brown eyes…
"You know, it isn't fair that Stark got to have the only thing I spent half of my life chasing after." Bucky stated bitterly, and Steve never felt as pained as he did when he saw the sadness in Bucky's eyes. "Isn't there any way?" Bucky asked, and Steve didn't dare to mention the desperate tone in his voice.
"Why is Papa angry?" Peter asked as he took his small cup of ice cream from Tony's hand, purring happily when he took the first bite of his chocolate ice cream, the sudden question caused Tony to pause, pursing his lips before he sighed.
"Mr. Stark." Hearing his name startled Steve and caused him to jump out of his chair, looking at the woman like a deer caught in a headlight, the nurse though, was nice about it, as she gave him a gentle smile. The woman, whose name turned out to be Darcy, guided to the examination room, leaving Steve all nervous and jumpy as he waited for the doctor to show up. "Wait in her Mr. Stark. Dr. Cho will be with you any minute now." Said Darcy after leading him to sit on the chair when his legs couldn't support him anymore from how nervous he was, Steve, swallowed at that and nods his head in thanks as he saw the Beta leave feeling like he was going to be sick any minute now.
"A dead cat possessed by a demon, not too common around here… you needed to bury it or the demon wouldn't leave the body and rise in the next full moon to cause chaos…" Rogers said with disappointment coloring his tone, which made Tony give a choked sound and turn to the man.
A sob left Tony's lips, followed by another and another until tears were running down Tony's face uncontrollably, the last few minutes finally catching to him and crushing him under their weight. The only thing that Tony could think of that will keep his baby safe was the lake, the lake that never failed to protect him and Morgan no matter what; Tony's only thought was for Morgan to reach the lake before that ghost (Steven Grant Rogers) touches her…
. Come inside me, baby, fill me with your cum, and let me feel your knot." Steve stated breathlessly causing Tony to moan loudly,
"Do you know why you are here?" Starkad asked calmly, shifting in his throne, Jamti, and Magna who were standing on each of his sides send him a look; probably the two of them were shocked about the calm tone he spoke in, in contrast to his angry and raging scent that was suffocating the hill they were hosting the 'Thing' on. Hamar on the other hand was flinching and whimpering every time he moved, probably still in pain after getting his face rearranged. "Do you?" That question was asked in a shout, making everyone flinch, even Magna and Jamti, who knew that no harm will touch him and that only those who were kneeling at Starkad's feet will be met with a dark fate tonight.
Tears cloud Tony's eyes, and he opened his mouth to answer, to stall, to get more time, just a little more time… the loud sound of the gunshot made everything freeze, even the howling wind seemed to stop. Stane's eyes were wide, and Tony couldn't tell if they were from the surprise or shock; Tony only knows one thing, the gun went off…
"A-and then, I held him from his hair and cut it!" James puffed his small chest and put both of his fists on his waist; the little boy was sitting on the bed beside his mother as he told him the tale of how he punished the bad guy who hurt his mother. Steven gave his babe a soft smile, he was feeling good today, and his child's cheerful energy helped him forget about the hurt that was eating his heart from the inside out.
Anthony start saving money, as much as he can, he knew that if he wanted the life he wanted with Steve, he couldn't stay in America, so Anthony start thinking, they could go to France, he was sure that Steve would love living there, studying in the place of art and beauty, or they could go to Italy, the natural places there would inspire Steve, he could imagine a home for him and Steve there, with a beautiful garden for their children to play in, or they could go to Ireland the place Steve was originally from, he only met Sarah Rogers a few times before her death, but she always used to talk about her home there in Ireland, about its beauty, and about the amazing life she and her husband had before the two of them came here. For Anthony it didn't matter, he could live anywhere in the world as long as he had Steve by his side, he made sure to sell a few cars that he got as a birthday presents from his father's partners, Anthony never used them, so he thought they will be useful that way, being the ticket for his and Steve's future.
thing he is good for… please don't go back to him…" Bucky pleads, his words causing Steve to feel uncomfortable as he shifted in his place, wondering why now of all time Bucky was acting like this.
"Well, Peter had told me that Howard and Sarah were getting alone lately… something about them forgetting him in the supermarket and regretting it…" Steve said, grimacing as he said these words unknowingly making Tony's heart drop at the news.
"What did Bucky do, Pete?" Steve asked in a joking voice, causing both Bucky and Peter's head to snap in his direction, the twin expression on their faces caused Steve to chuckle at the wide-eyed look the two of them send his way.
"Look around you, it's night, stars don't sleep at night." Steven hissed as his eyes returned to glare at the cuffs. Well, that was better wording to that piece of accessory, but then again, Steven got a blue stone necklace that doesn't want to detach itself off him, that Steven wanted it to stay away from him after knowing what it was, so Steven may not be the best person to decide on what was fashionable to attach to his body without consent and what was not in this wasteland.
The third and final time he woke up, thankfully he wasn't sedated, so that provided him the opportunity to take in the barren room he was in; raising his head to see why he couldn't move his arms, glaring darkly when he noted that not only he was naked and that the sole item of clothes on his body was his suit slacks, but also his hands were bound; a few tugs to the shackles informed him that he could break free from them, but if he did that, then whoever kidnapped him won't show up, and that will leave Steven with more question than he needs, especially with his kidnapper having a powerful enough sedative that was able to knock him out, no sedative was strong enough to work on him, and the last one that work was fifteen years ago and it only knocked him for ten minutes before his body became resistant to it.
"Tell me about him… please…" Tony whispered harshly as he hides in Steve's chest, shaking uncontrollably as the Alpha croon while rubbing his back, trying to calm him down.
"You mean the fruit bowl?" Anton asked with a tilt of his head, wondering what his son would want of a strange metal sheet that did nothing for protection. What made Anton's day though was the splutter James let out, the betrayal look in his eyes, how his face turned red, the curses he throw at Anton, made the Alpha snort and hold into his laughter, wondering why the kid would get this worked up for a sheet of metal that refused to be melted or shaped. "Kid, this Shield does not offer protection against arrows or swords, it is too smooth to be of use, and the metal refused to be shaped, this is not a Shield as it is a hindrance to whoever uses it," Anton explained as he stood up, getting the Shield from the bile of unwanted metal and offered the Shield/bowl to the kids, ignoring how James glared at him like he was the stupidest person to ever grace the earth with his present… yeah, Anton can see how much James take after his mother, they make the same faces.
"Five hundred years ago, he warned us about Thanos… but there was a lot of bitter blood, so everyone ignored his warnings, and not a year later Thanos went against the nine realms." Thor tried to explain as best as he can. "But what really changed everything, was two years ago, when I was banished to Midgard… after that, everyone realized that his actions were for a reason and that he can see what is to happen in the far away future, stars respect him for that, and wished to follow him… I tried to change after what happened in Midgard, hoping that he will see me as worthy when he sees that I have changed…" Thor looked down at his feet, feeling ashamed as he told his friends how they treated one of the people in their realms.
"What I am is of no importance, what is important is what you want…" Nebula stated in a monotone, blinking her eyes as she gazed around the destroyed room, scrunching her nose at the dead bodies in the corner, being eaten by mice and insects. What a messy child, she couldn't even kill her targets right. "You seek revenge, do you not? Revenge from the one named Iron Man. I can help you gain your revenge on him and his teammates for a price of course." Nebula stated, not blinking her eyes when the witch's eyes turned red with anger and bloodlust; a part of Nebula thought that the witch's eyes looked just like Thanos in one of his fits when he lusts for violence and blood, and maybe, maybe that's why her father ordered her to make the witch their ally.
"Oh? What did you bring me, Steve?" Tony asked as he took the book, smiling at the Alpha when he ripped the papers to show the book inside, thinking that it was nothing but the manuscript of Steve's next comic and that the man wanted Tony to see it, but when the decorating papers were all gone, Tony froze in his place when he saw that he was holding an album in his hands.
OK… that was getting creepy… "Can you understand me? And how do you know who am I?" Steve asked sitting on the chair that was facing the computer, too interested to stop now he can blame that amazing smell for this.
"The glasses…" He muttered making Steve look at his side to see a black-framed glasses, it warmed him to see something so old as glasses, as they weren't used since 2034. He took the glasses and gave them to Tony only for the older man to shake his head. "Take it… i-it will h-help you." He said as he pulled his hand out of Steve's hand putting the glasses in it and pushes it toward Steve's chest. "It's c-called E.D.I.T.H…," Tony said making Steve look at the glasses.
It was a week later that Tony heard about the clinic from his mother, the woman was telling Tony about the hospital and the clinic that specialize in helping Omegas, but what made him tick was when his mother mentioned to him that she would like for Tony to come with her to the clinic, and meet some of the doctors working there, it made Tony held into his screams and tried to smile, his mother was never subtle no matter how much she tried, his baby was asleep and he didn't want to wake the pup who was purring happily and contently while hugging the toy and the blanket the Alpha gave him.
"You are welcome, little bambino…So Mr. Rogers, fancy seeing you here." Said Tony as he stood and turned his face to Mr. Rogers who was looking at the two of them with soft eyes that it made Tony a little flush, which was strange because the Alpha was scary just a few seconds ago.
How are you holding up, Tony? Steven asked, which gained the younger man's attention, and Steven couldn't help but take in Tonys figure, taking in the lovely dark suit he wore, and how put together he always looked. Nostalgia slammed into Steven, reminding him of his late husband.
"It's January 25th, 2012, why?" The other Steve said, hearing that made the air rush out of Steve's lungs, he felt like the earth had opened and swallowed him whole, he felt like he was falling, and falling, and falling and there was no way to catch him, how is this even possible? He died! He knew he did, then how was he here? With a young Peggy! The Peggy he met in 2012 was an old woman in her nineties, not this young woman in her prime, and to top it all the Avengers are here too! That doesn't make any sense; it doesn't make any sense, none, nothing was making a sense! Fear, despair, and pain took hold of Steve's heart, making him chock and held into his sobs, as he felt sweat sliding down his back.
"That's were Tony come in." Steven said smiling gently at the Omega which made the smaller man look at him with a questioning look. "Considering that the Helicarriers being made with Stark's tech, I am sure Tony will like to leave them a little surprise on the takeoff." That made Tony grin and took his phone out of his pocket and called the number he wanted firing orders left and right to Jarvis and his AI when they picked the phone up ignoring the rest of the team as they looked at Tony who whines about meetings tomorrow but feeling light on the inside.
"Don't cry, sweet thing, you said it yourself, Peter needs to interact with other people and make friends, I don't think that our baby would enjoy the company of grown-up that much even if he love us; plus even with Morgan being there, she is more of a little sister than a friend… and she is three years younger," Steve whispered, cooing and showering Tony with kisses until the man calm down. "Just imagine, baby, our Peter would come and tell us all the crazy stories he went through; the friends he would make, the teachers he would terrify… the poor souls he would torture… it would be a good experience for him to choose his victims instead of us." Tony nodded along with Steve's logical explanation, a pout taking over his face at the thought of how numbered his days were now… at this rate his baby would not need him anymore!
"Why don't we just stop running around the bush, OK?" Tony stated, putting his cup of coffee down and gaze at his friends who were sending him concerned looks, which made Tony hate himself a little. "You are thinking that my house is haunted by a ghost and wanted to take me and Morgan away from here, isn't it? I mean sure, everyone talked about the place being haunted, but until now, nothing happened." Nothing bad happened anyway, nothing that going to the lake hadn't fixed yet; maybe the monster was a little angry at Tony because the man ignored him the past month or so since he had Morgan? Maybe Tony should leave an offering to placate the monster? Maybe Tony and the monster can reach an agreement?
No matter how much Steve tried to calm Peter down the boy, continued to cry louder and louder, and it was that moment that Steve felt a little resentment for Tony, the Alpha knows damn well that his help was needed, but still, he didn’t come to check on his crying son, when the boy needed him. Peter suddenly stopped crying, and that more than ever made Steve worried and concern, because normally when Peter cry, he won’t stop unless he and Steve were in bed, with Steve telling him stories about his father, but when Peter looked up at him for a second, he stretched his hands toward him. “Mommy…” That was all Peter could whine before his eyes closed and he fell down, causing Steve to let a panicked cry and rush to his baby.
!" It started with Tony screaming his name; terror and fear clear on the Alpha's face as he rushed to Steve, who was still shaking in his place. Cops, nurses, doctors, The SWAT, the fire department; everyone was rushing to the supermarket, trying to rescue the hostages that were shot, trying to lead the criminals they arrested away, trying to put out the fire that somehow was light in the supermarket.
A shine caught the Alpha's attention and his hand followed the path to it, his right hand touched a silver chain which made the Alpha hum at that wondering how he didn't notice the Omega wearing something as fancy as that, just as the Alpha was about to pull the Omega's chain so that he will be able to see the shape of the necklace a hand took hold of his and squeezed harshly making the Alpha look at the Omega's tired eye, watching as the Omega's blue eyes widen when they fell on him and the queen pushed his hand away. "What did you do?" The Omega snapped at the Alpha making the Alpha frown at him.
Natasha hummed to herself as she switched the lights, grumbling when the lights flickered on and off, she is so going to have a talk with Stark about how to maintain his house. The storm raged loudly in the background, but the redhead didn't give it that much thought, going to the fridge with a hum, pausing when she saw the shadow of a man on the wall when lightning painted the sky white followed by a clap of deafening thunder.
"He did, they died that night; same as Stevie, for Rogers, couldn't save him. Unfortunately, it seemed like Johann and his partner kept in touch with one of the higher-ups in the government because one week later, the government raised our town trying to find Rogers… it was a miracle that one of our own worked in the government, because of that they never found Rogers." Natasha explained, her story getting a nod from Tony who was gazing at the lake in thoughts.
"You always love your acronyms," Steve said looking at his husband, who was looking at Steve with a concentrate look like he was trying to print Steve's face into his memory.
"Y-you know me?" The woman asked with a wobbly voice which made the pup pause and nods his head at that, the old man behind her took a step forward which made the pup look at him with a grin and extend his arm that was not holding the toy to hug the man, who was shaking.
And it must be a dream, because even if this person was his Steve, his love and mate; he was so different; this Steve was… he was healthy, that was the best Tony can say without being lost in his gentle eyes and soft aura. This Steve was flushed pink, health and happiness on his face, no dark bags under his eyes, no pale face scrunched in pain because of the poison and many illnesses holding him back. This Steve was sitting straight, while his Steve always sits hunching down on himself because of his scoliosis. This Steve wasn't the twig his mate was, no, he was flush with health and a body that was the picture of perfect Omega, even his arms has lean muscle in them, his ribs didn't show like they use to. This Steve… this Steve was the Steve that Tony dreamed of when he thought about his mate without the illnesses that weight him down.
"Maybe I will go with you after I tidy the house, I wanted to see the boathouse in the back and maybe try and collect as much as I can of firewood, if today is as cold as the night before then maybe I should." Tony mumbled which made Natasha raise her head and glare at him, making the teen shiver.
Steve was stupid, he was so, so stupid because he left his home and let Tony get to him, he had endangered his baby's life because he couldn't handle Tony being with someone else, he nearly hurt his baby who was innocent in all of this; how stupid can Steve be? He knew that someone was stalking him, but he still went to his friends' unprotected apartment, not only endangering his life but theirs as well.
"First of all language!" Snapped Steve making Natasha glare at him. "Second of all, what the fuck did you think, breaking people's phones like this?" That made Natasha look at him with an open mouth then she closes it and looks at her hand and wince.
"It's OK, Tony, he is already falling asleep," Steve said running his hand through the pup's hair getting a sleepy yawn one more. The sight in front of him made Tony let out a small hum tears gathering in his eyes once more, how many times had he imagined his baby looking this happy and content? Too many for him to count, Tony thought and let out a small sob, he felt a gentle hand touching his arm and he turns to see Steve giving him an understanding look, opening his arm for him.
Since Hydra refused to show its true face Steven had to swallow his pride and wait a little longer, even if it meant smiling tightly at Pierce when the man starts kissing his ass and start digging to see if Steven was going to be on Hydra's side, Peggy and him had to make a full proved plan, Steven and her even discussed the idea of him going undercover, considering no one but the Avengers know about him or his life considering that he was from another universe, which gave him many advantages, especially considering that he wanted to infiltrate Hydra.
The doctor sighed at that taking his glasses off, that display made Steve's heart nearly stop, but the doctor starts talking. "The pup had a severe case of Pneumonia, but he as getting the medics he needs." That made Steve sigh in relief and he took a deep breath to calm himself. "Vaccines are usually administered to prevent infection by viruses and bacteria, but considering that the pup was born into captivity…" The doctor swallowed, he couldn't even finish his sentence. "Did anyone of you held the pup for a long period of time?" The doctor asked changing the subject, making the group fall silent at that.
Meanwhile, Hydra was on the move, the loss of Zola was crushing, and they knew that they needed to do something, preferably catching Steven once again, for the strength they witnessed was too much for them to let go; for Hydra Steven was now more important than getting back the Winter Soldier, with that in mind, Hydra made their move a few months later, waiting for everything to settle down, unaware of Steven and Peggy's decision of finally making the move to overthrow Hydra.
"I see…" The Omega said with a scowl on his face as he followed the Alpha until they reached one of the officers that were waiting near the corner, who jumped in fear as Tony's glaring eyes fell on him. "If you don't mind I will take my leave now." The Omega hissed which made the officer wince and nods his head, letting a sigh of relief when the Omega left with the Alpha.
"Did not! You were running when you know you shouldn't and ran into him! I'm so going to tell Dad!" The girl state crossing her arms, ignoring the squeak from the boy; it made Tony wonder if he could sneak away and disappear in the wind before the two of them notice that he was still there.
"We can't! We brought breakfast from Angie's diner, you know it's a sin to let it get cold and not enjoy it while it was hot, right?" Clint grinned, which made Tony narrow his eyes, only opening the door and invite them when the two of them showed him the goods, and Tony's mouth watered, his tummy made grumbling sound, making the teen flush when Natasha sent him a knowing look.
"Do you know what happened?" Tony asked, stalking to Steve and pulling him away from Bucky, causing Steve to shift uncomfortably when he became the center of attention of the two Alphas. God, could the two of them act like civil people for an hour? Someone just trespass on the property and broke the office window!
One thing Sarah Rogers didn't believe she will ever see in her life was her grandson talking and interacting with Omegas without him screaming and crying out in fear, a problem that the cause of was the pup's insane mother, and Sarah being a nurse prepared herself for her son and grandson distrust of Omegas, one failed mating was enough to shatter her son's low self-esteem of himself while destroying his pup's mentality.
When the two reached the door Tony spotted the female with the strange red hair and throw her a glare only to get a smirk in return which made the Omega hold his growl and power walk out of the door, after saying goodbyes to Mr. Rogers, he still has his manners, after all, it was until he returned home that he realized…
Tony gave a wobbling smile, rushing to Steve to hold the Alpha, taking comfort from him; it has been a month since the Omega saw the man, a month since he nearly destroyed everything because he refused to talk and explain to Steve, forcing the Alpha into something that hurt them, but when the Alpha held him tightly and kissed his forehead, the Omega let out a relieved sigh, the hope of fixing what happened increased that now Steve knew what really took a place that day.
1989. Steve becomes the CEO and The Starks and Peggy went into hidden, Tony gives birth to Peter by the end of the year…
It was a harsh blow to Tony, thinking that Harley was forcing himself to interact with him, forcing himself not to flinch every time Tony touched him or smiled at him; as much as Steve reassured him that Harley genuinely enjoyed his time with Tony, it was hard to believe it. For some reason, it really broke his heart and made him feel useless; Tony never realized how different Peter's situation was from Harley until then.
Today Tony agreed that he was going to talk with Mrs. Rogers; Tony know that no matter what it looked like, Mrs. Rogers will be the first one to oppose his marriage with Steve, something that even now, the Omega didn’t know the reason for, and it hurt him, how Mrs. Rogers, the woman that once told Tony to call her ‘Sarah’ became cold to him, just because he was dating her son now.
Growling Starkad could only stalk the roads in search of his son, hoping to catch where the foolish Omega had gone to and with him his boy. "Starkad!" someone called out to him, which caused the Alpha to whirl around and glare at the person who dared to disturb his search, only to raise his eyebrow when he saw Braes running toward him with ashen face and fear in his eyes.
The voice on the other end of the line made Sam give a tired sigh and start walking back toward his office. "Hey, do you want to go to Loki's tonight? I could use a drink… or two." Sam said making the line go silent for a little while.
"Hey, kid!" Tony called out as he walked toward the boy, hoping that the kid wouldn't run and make his day more difficult than it was a few minutes ago. When the boy turned toward him, Tony blink in surprise and horror when he saw that the kid was no one but Harley Keener, Peter's friend… Tony couldn't help but look around hoping that he had missed Harley's caretaker by chance, hoping that what he was thinking wasn't true; when Tony found no one besides Harley or someone looking for him, he swallowed biting the inside of his cheek.
The wedding resume like normal… if you mean by normal the Viking cheers and proud whistles the Addams family were letting out from their side, and the teeth grind and the killing intent from Tony's side; then yes, everything went pretty normal. It was only when they reached the part when someone objected that a little hiccup happened. If by a little hiccup meant that everyone on Tony's side, sane Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy (Who was crying his eyes out and saying
Today, his father had invited him to their favorite café; it was their favorite until Stane showed up in the picture and took all of his father's attention and love from the family, causing them such heartache and pain, but for once, instead of saying 'No' like he usually do, he said 'Yes' with a sigh. To his surprise their late lunch was pleasant; they talked about what's going on in their lives, what they are planning to do later, Tony even dropped the name he chose for the baby once or twice to see his father reaction; everything was good until his father start opening their argument once more.
It was tempting though, moving away from Brooklyn and starting a new life for himself and his baby, away from the memories of Anthony and the pain and betrayal, Steve didn't have anyone here, not anymore, not since Bucky and his family moved away and left him here, not since his mother died, and Anthony left him alone, it didn't take more than five minutes for Steve to decided and ask the older man to take him to see the house…
"Mommy, he peed!" Steve remembered hearing a child cry, which made him look down at the puddle of water under him, the woman with the child pale a little as she saw Steve sway with shocked and rushed to help him screaming at the bystanders to call the ambulance.
But in the end, the two of them made it work, Anthony was a considerate Alpha, he was smart, kind, compassionate, and a loving person, he dreamed of changing the world into a better place, he was an inventor and an amazing one at that, Steve saw some of his work, the little robot in the shape of claw 'Dummy' and the in-process AI he was making and named JARVIS, both were amazing, and Steve made sure to always tell his lover that he will reach his coal, he is always rewarded with a happy smile at the end.
"Why didn't they tell me? Why did you lie?" Tony's voice cracked as he spooks those words, wondering what kind of excuse Angie would come up with, what kind of lies she was going to tell him. Tony would have understood why they hide it from him; he would have accepted and understood if they told them the town's secret before Stane, hell, even before Ty! But no one told him, no one told him and they let him suffer from self-doubt and fear.
"Oh, I noticed alright, but he is not the one I am interested in, to be honest…" Rogers said which made Tony hum and blink at that, shrugging a little, it wasn't his fault that Barnes'll end up with a broken heart when he learns that his precious 'Stevie' was in love with another person… "You know… it takes a real man to be fearless enough to create his tomb while still alive…" Rogers said as he walked toward Tony which made the shorter man let out a confused noise at that and look up at the man who was caging him, making Tony tense. "If only you could see yourself today, wearing your own armor like a tomb, fighting for your life when any second now you will be crushed into nothing, having the strong will to go down in your armor, and not fearing the destructive power you have…" Rogers sighed dreamily at that, causing a shiver of fear run down Tony's spine as he swallows nervously… "
The creature moves forward, toward the sleeping man resting one dirt-streaked hand on the swing seat, thumb brushing against the fabric of Tony's jeans. Amongst the tangle of thick, dirty white hair are crystalline blue eyes, and the soft curve of lips as the creature leans closer. And Tony furrowed his brows when he felt a breath of air against his cheek, cold and sweet, like damp rich earth. And when Tony opened his eyes he froze at what he was seeing, gazing in fear as the creature draws in a breath, a low hiss against its sharp, big white teeth, and Tony… Tony screamed.
"You know I can't tell you." Loki said in a husky tone from the lack of use, which made Steven lean back in his seat with a small frown looking at the people behind him. "He is watching." Loki's warning made the hair on the back of Steven's neck stand on its ends, letting out a harsh breath through his nose.
Sam stayed quiet for a little time, glancing between Tony and his children who were running ahead and putting whatever they fancy in their basket; the look on Sam's face, made the smile slip from Tony's because the Omega already knows what the Beta wanted to say. "Mr. Stark, I… I really wanted to say how…" Sam opened his mouth and closes it a few times which made Tony swallow.
"Thor…" Steve called out before the prince of Asgard called Heimdall to open the Bifrost. Thor turns his gaze to Steve, confusion, and a little bit of fear in the prince's eyes, and it made Steve hate himself for the way he treated the prince when he first met him. "I know this is a little late but… Thor son of Odin, Prince of Asgard; you are worthy and I acknowledge you as my king." Steve raised his head as he said these words, his eyes not straying away from Thor's even when the prince's eyes were filled with tears. "I presume you are going to be late if you stayed here, will you not?" Steve tilted his head to the side causing the prince to let out a happy laugh.
Steve sighed as he sat up, too drained and too tired but unable to sleep, maybe a little snack would be good to take his mind off things. It hurts, Steve's heart hurt so much after he was forced to see the reality that he ignored for so long. Steve thought that Howard's hatred would shimmer down as the years passed, he thought that he managed to gain his husband's love, that Tony would always choose him if things went south, he thought that Tony's close friendship with Pepper Potts was just that… friendship… Steve should have known that this was just a desperate wish he had.
"That's not what happened Rhodey." Pepper said as she took a step forward toward the Beta wetting her lips. "Howard… Howard admits to knowing about Tony's plan… he did something to the Omega, and he disappeared, Mr. Barnes said his family searched for the Omega for ten years with nothing… and… and Tony implied that the Omega was pregnant." Pepper said looking at Rhodey, only to see the realization painting his eyes.
"You know why I am here." Steven said gently as he set in the seat Loki pointed toward, both of them ignoring then rest of the people who made themselves comfortable in Loki's room without his permission which made the dark hair man scrunch his nose at that.
That made Steve head snapped up and turns around in circles, which made everyone look at him with strange looks… Steve didn't care as his breath starts speeding, the singing was coming… from down… he thought as he looked at the floor. Without a warning, Steve starts running down the halls, going down, down, down! He heard shouting and footsteps followed him, but Steve didn't care, he had to go down…
"Follow me." Odin said which made Steven hum at that and follow the king and queen, not taking his eyes off of the man's back too distrust of him. "So you have met my counterpart…" Odin hummed giving Steven and the Avengers following him a flitting glance, raising his brow at Steven counterpart.
"What… other i-information you have?" Tony whispered as he closed the file, his legs were wobbling that Tony feared he was going to fall any minute now.
Margaret said which made Steven let out a relieved breath at that and held his son tightly when the young Alpha turns his head to see where Margaret's voice was coming from.
"I… I am sorry, something important came up and I couldn't miss it; I promise I will make it up next time, Steve." Tony said, taking Steve's hands in his, probably hoping that Steve will understand why Tony was late; a few months ago maybe Steve would have listened to Tony and let the Alpha explained himself if this was only the appointment the Alpha had missed. This wasn't the first appointment, it wasn't the second, and it sure seems that it won't be the last, ever since they both knew about him being pregnant, Tony starts pulling away from him, making Steve suspect and doubt himself the more he spent time alone without his mate with him.
"It doesn't matter right now; the police are coming, hopefully soon." Tony stated which made Bucky send him a harsh glare for underestimating things, something that made Steve shift as the tension seemed to rise between the two brothers. A major part of Steve was angry at Tony's dismissal, but he knows that this was his Alpha's way of showing concern, a way that Steve hated even when the Alpha meant well.
"Papa, Tony, I'm home!" Peter called in a cheerful voice out as he came inside the house, a huge grin on his face as he rushed toward the kitchen, which made both Tony and Steve give knowing smiles as they wait for the boy, it was only a few minutes before Peter rushed inside the kitchen with a happy grin. "Papa, Tony, you won't believe it! Uncle Bucky said that everyone gonna come to our house tomorrow, he said there will be a party! Can I invite Harley, please?" Peter hopped around the place, which caused Tony and Steve to gaze at each other for a second a happy smile taking over both of their faces.
"It's… a pleasant… surprise to meet you…" The man murmured as he put his hand in his pocket and pulled a black rose out of nowhere trying to give it to Tony, which made the man look at the rose with an eyebrow-raising, wondering why the man will give him a rose that was meant for a funeral. Tony took a step back away from Rogers who was gazing at him with a dark look in his eyes… and maybe Barnes' death glare as he hissed at Tony when the man dared to look at the rose that Rogers wanted him to have was one of the reasons he decided to turn around and walk out of the room, shivering as he heard a mad cackle coming from inside the room.
"His grandson isn't." Fury said which made the woman turn her head sharply toward his with narrow eyes as she gazed at him with a shocked look hidden deeply behind a frown, which made the Alpha in front of her look at the files in his hands going through them.
"It… it's me, Stevie… it is Becky… Bucky's sister…" That made Steve's eyes snap toward the woman as well as his attention, his jaw fell a little as he narrow his eyes, taking the woman from head to toes finally managing to place why the woman was familiar to him; Becky's hair and eyes were an exact replica of Bucky, even the baby in her arms had the same blue-grey eyes but with a light blond hair.
"I become a 'Savage', an unstoppable force and an immovable object at the same time, no one knew about that side effect, everyone thought the serum healed me… it was known four years after defeating Thanos when my husband was attacked and nearly died." Those words made Loki hum and lean on his chair with a thoughtful look.
"Oh, it's OK, look if Winnie asked just tell her I reject you, it will be easier than trying to avoid her which will cause chaos." Tony said noticing how Bucky wince at that and nod his head in thanks before running out of the room, and nearly run back inside the house when Winnie's screams of James's name reached them… Tony really pities that Alpha…
"We killed Thanos in my world, and we will kill him here too, nothing changes." Steven said as he looked at Asgard from his balcony, mind drifting to what Loki had informed him a few hours earlier.
"You had that drink an hour ago you lazy bum! Now come here and say hello to Tony." Winnie glared at the Alpha who let out a long-suffering sigh and grumbled to himself as he walked toward Winnie who was standing near a brunette Omega that wore a fancy suit. "Tony, this is my son James, the one I have been talking about, James this is Tony Stark, you know…" Winnie said as she elbows her son in the ribs when he looked at the Omega with a bored look.
"I wanted to ask something from you," Tony said after letting go of Pepper making the older woman wipe her tears and look at the Omega with a happy look. "Would you honor me by accepting the position of a Godmother? It's a hard rule, and you will most likely help me with changing the diapers and-" Tony couldn't continue as he heard Pepper let out a scream of joy and throw herself at him, laughing happily and crying at the same time.
Reaching the garage Tony rushed toward his car, not fancy ones like his parents, but a car dear to him considering that Tony had to work two summers to gather enough money to buy it, a car that will make a perfect way for running away from this place, considering that no one knows about it. Gasping, Tony, revived the car and drove as fast as he can without attracting the attention of the people and police, all the same, gasping and wiping his tears away trying to focus on the road in front of him, putting as much distance between him and the nightmare behind him.
"Come on, baby, everything is fine now, Sh." Steve shushed the little pup after the nurses were done, rocking the sobbing boy for a few more minutes before he leaned back a little to clean the pup's face with tissues from snot, tears, and spite, which caused the boy to whine at that and push Steve's hands away from him.
Natasha on the other hand had her hands on her hips, no doubt she was ready to give him an earful, but her hands drop down when Clint sends her a knowing look, which made her sigh and grumbles. “Oh God, Tones, look at you!” Rhodey’s eyes widen as he let go, gazing at Tony’s pregnant belly with wide eyes, Pepper not that far behind, though her eyes were sparkling with joy at how happy and glowing Tony was.
So other than a failed attempt to destroy his and his husband's marriage and happiness; the idiot had painted a target on his back that everyone from Steve and Tony to Serpentine was chasing. Personally, Tony wasn't even in a rush to find the fool, he knew his husband would bring him by the end of the night so the two of them would enjoy torturing him before throwing him into the shark tank.
"Tony, can you please come with me?" Steve sighed tiredly after he finished treating Bucky, looking at his husband with a look that left the man in no position to refuse. Steve really wanted to clean up and change his clothes; Bucky was kind so far as to not point out Steve's scent that mingled with come and sex, but it didn't mean that Steve wanted to smell like that when the police showed up.
To be truthful with himself; Tony was terrified to death. Pregnancy was something that he tried to avoid like a plague, fearing that any pregnancy he would go through would end up like his first; with a dead child and a drunken mess that was Tony. He doesn't even know how he ended up pregnant; he always made sure to take his birth control daily and even remind Steve to wear a condom if the two of them weren't too lost in their heat and rut. So it stomped him to be informed that he was pregnant… in his third month no less.
Steve looked up when Tony said those words and gives a sad, so sad smile that made Tony's heart drop… "I don't think he would mind, he always loved curious people… he died two months ago… at least he died of an old age… ninety-five… we never believed we will reach that age." Steven muttered to himself smiling as he took his own ring from the chain and wore it around his ring finger; he then wore the chain with the remaining ring around his neck.
"Please, go to your room…" Steve breathed out as he tried to calm himself, not wanted to do something that he will regret later and it seems that the pup understood how big the situation was, as he rushed out of the room, running toward his and slamming the door shut, leaving the adults alone in the ruined room.
Eleven months after Steve become the CEO, he and Miss Potts stayed in the office that night, they were talking about the trip to Japan that they hoped Howard will attend… it was then that Steve learned that Miss Potts was one of Tony's friends it was an offhanded command that was said by a tired woman, but it held all the truth he needed.
In and out, Tony took a few more breaths to calm down, leaning on Steve's chest and taking his mate's scent further helping his fried nerves to calm. "Thank you," Tony whispered pulling out of Steve's embrace to kiss his cheek, smiling a little as Steve's beard tickled his lips, chuckling softly when Steve nuzzled his cheeks before taking Tony's lips in a kiss, silencing his chuckles.
The flatness that greeted Steve no matter where his hand slide, causing his heart to skip several beats, nearly stopping right here, right now. Gasps were leaving his lips as he tried to force his head to move and look around the room, hoping to catch the sight of his baby in here… other than the gifts he got a glimpse of, the stuffed animals on every surface, and the flowers in several vases around the room, there was nothing informed Steve of the whereabout of his baby, which made a high pitched whine leave his throat.
… and Tony knew deep down that he was lying to himself, because if he did this... if he dared to do this without Steve's consent or the Alpha understanding what Tony was asking then it meant a broken trust… a broken trust that will never be back, just like how him and his father are handling the situation they were in, ignoring and hurting each other, refusing to just sit and talk because the trust was broken, it wasn't there anymore, and they couldn't mend it, it's hard to do so… Tony wondered if he went with this plan of his, would he be another dark history in the Rogers family, just like Steve's ex-mate, someone that they never talked about, but their action ran deep and fractured the family, will Peter return to his old thoughts, looking at every Omega he saw after Tony with distrust and fear? Will Steve look at every Omega like nothing but a potential betrayal and heartbreak? Will Tony prove Sarah right in her thoughts of never trusting an Omega? Will Tony be forgotten and not talked about like how everyone refused to talk about Steve's ex-mate?
A choked sound left Tony and the Omega nearly jumped from his place when the door opened and Steve, yes, his blurry vision spotted Steve, looked at him with shocked wide eyes. "Tony…" Steve whispered which made the room behind him get quiet and for aunt Peggy and his father to rush out of the office to gaze at him with wide eyes, wondering how much did he hear, the gentle hand that was extended to him by Steve snapped Tony back and the Omega sprint toward his lab ignoring his family calling for him, wanting to forget this nightmare and just go toward his safe heaven.
It was a few weeks since Doom, and the world know that there was two Captain America walking on earth now, and Steven had to say that he was nearly about to rip his hair off, not only he was becoming a dancing monkey again because everyone wanted to meet the new Captain or a Commander Rogers as they start calling him that they knew about Shield, but people always made passes at him, especially when he wears his glass and slick his hair back like he always does… Clint joke that it was all in the beard, which usually made Steven roll his eyes at the Omega but smiled at his words as he remembered that the Clint from his universe would have said the same.
"It seems that you knew my counterpart well, son of Sarah." She said with a smile then that smile fell as she looked at Steven. "You must know that son of Sarah, the fates have strange ways of arranging things and one of them you being here. But what I don't understand is why? Why did you choose to stay in this world and let your body die in your universe? What did the fates show you?" she asked which made Steven pause at that.
"Bucky…" Steven gently whispered; his words seemingly settled on deaf ears as the soldier sway before striding toward Steven, straddling his lap, not a few moments afterward, making Steven tense like a bow. "Bucky, don't do this; I can get us out of here." Steven hissed when he felt Bucky moving his hips, rubbing down on his prick, making Steven feel sick to the bones when he felt wetness soaking through his slacks; the knowledge that Bucky, his best friend, and brother forced to this, was enough to snap Steven, he bites his tongue harshly when he realized how glossy Bucky's eyes were, noting how drugged and out of it he undoubtedly was, and it made him wonder if Zola had adopted the same tactics in his universe too, a reflection that made the beast in his rage. "I'm sorry, Buck." Steven whispered as he leaned closer to Bucky, forcing him to let out a gasp when he breathed the hated trigger words in Bucky's ears, hoping that they were the same in this universe.

"Sure, if I come it means I can check that sexy ex-military while I am at it, tell me though, is it true that he is taller than your man?" Natasha leaned over and whispered her question, a knowing smug smile taking over her face, causing Steve to laugh and nod his head; Natasha seemed to be in a cheerful mood today, he wonders what happened to cause her to be this happy.
After all, Steve was crazy, a crazy and coward person, with a dead mate that decided to take his revenge on Steve by driving him more insane… he hated himself for losing the will to live day, after day, after day… Steve raised his head, and looked around the place…
"How do you do it?" Tony asked as he looked at the Alpha which caused the Alpha to turn to the sandbag with a look. "Dealing with the raw feeling, I meant, trying to contain your anger and helplessness." Tony dared to ask which made Steve pause a little and a ghost of a smile took over his face.
"Stevie… sweetheart… I don't know what to say…" Peggy whispered after a short period of silence, her words caused Steve to sniffle as he tried to regain himself least he start crying again. "I… it's…it's not… this life you told me about… it's not real, Stevie…" Peggy whispered after a few failed attempts to speak, her words causing Steve to let out a confused noise and look at her with shock and betrayal in his eyes. "W-what you said… all of it… is not real. Stevie… today is October 10th, 2011. Seven years ago you and your husband James Buchanan Barnes were involved in a car accident, which ended up with you falling into a coma and losing the baby…" Steve froze at those words, looking at Peggy like she lost her mind; because what in the seven hells was Peggy talking about. 2011? That's not true, it's not true, it was 2015, last time he checked the date it was November 21st, 2015; that's aside, the most important question was, who the hell was James Buchanan Barnes?
"And this is the libraries of Asgard you can find anything you want here, we also have all the history of the nine realms recorded and stored here, it's not as big as the royal library but it comes a close second to it." Thor said as he pointed to a huge looking building made from gold and marble, making the Avengers awe at what their eyes were seeing. For Steven he just hummed and nodded his head, following Thor when he entered the library, pointing at the sections and every book kind of book in that section.
"S.H.I.E.L.D. was destroyed." Stated Tony with a deadpanned look, already saying 'fuck it' to his life, after all, why does it matter what he does? He was going to die one day because of either a heart attack thanks to The Addams Family, or he was going to get killed thanks to his friends. The collective shriek of '
Tony let out a breath and looks at the door, then at the phone taking in the shape 'Nokia' was writing in white letters above the screen. Tony took a breath and tried to open the phone, after a few tries he was able to, Tony bit his lips in concentration, for God's sake! He was an engineering student! He graduate from MIT when he was fifteen and a half, a stupid phone was not going to stop him from saving his son! Tony then tried to go to the phone database and sighs in happiness as he accesses the base… he was fascinated by the phone capability, and he nearly sobs as he saw that the phone can send SMS messages! He doesn't have to be afraid of someone calling this number again if they didn't answer Tony the first time, he can delete the message after sending it!
"Explain what?" Tony hissed, holding Morgan tightly in his arms, afraid of letting her go, fearing that they would take her away from him. "Explaining about how you lied to me for months? Explaining about the monster that lived in the lake and how you practically throw me to him on a silver plate? Explaining how you are planned on killing me if I discovered your secrets that you tried to hide? Or how about the monster living in the lake is no other than Steven Grant Rogers?" Tony ended up shouting, taking in the shocked faces that were looking at him. "What are you going to explain? Come on, enlighten me! Tell me!" Tony screamed, glaring at Peggy and Bucky, as he held his crying baby tightly, his nerves were already frazzled enough after seeing Steven Rogers.
"Thank you." Maria could only say as she took the cup from the Omega sighing gently to herself as she relaxed, even more, when she smelled the scent of Earl Grey. "I have to say, I'm sorry that only now I come… I only knew about your existence a week ago, forgive me, I don't know what to do." Maria whispered which made the Omega give her a long look before a sad smile taking over his face.
Steve's breath hitched at that… why was he here? He never went to the cemetery anymore, not since entering Tony's room, not since he found calmness in the teen's room, the calmness that made him stop punching the punching bags in the gym braking chain after chain, and ripping the bags in half, not since he starts seeing his therapist, Bruce "I a-am not t-that kind of doctor" Banner who wasn't a shrink, who worked in Maria's hospital, that Steve volunteer in sometimes, but being near the Beta was calming in itself. Steve stood on shaky legs and start running, he runs past the graves, past the dead trees and bushes, and the fogs.
"W… w-what was that?" Tony asked shakily as the cat ran toward the high fences of the mansion and passed through the bars, it was only five seconds before the people outside start screaming and the cars start crashing into each other, he was sure that he heard a man screaming 'It ripped my fingers!'
"The police are already on their way, and I would really love to see you trying to get away with explaining to Natasha why you are here when you shouldn't," Clint started with narrow eyes, causing Peggy to huff and raised her head high before turning around and walking away.
