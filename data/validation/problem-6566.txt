Steve and Bucky stopped, standing in the middle of the room like they were ready to throw punches and turned to Peggy. Peggy, who was sitting next to her crying wife and son. She stood up and came over, pushing Bucky back to sit down and pulling Steve on the couch with her, pushing back his hair.
Tony ignored whoever was clearing her throat and kept kissing his Captain, tugging him in to deepen the kiss. Weird, he thought Steve was taller than this.
And now he was here, sitting in the hallway in front of Howard Stark’s office, feeling the stares of his secretaries; of the businesspersons waiting there; of Obadiah Stane, Howard’s right hand who was currently talking in hushed tones with one of their associates on the other side of the glass door of his office, their gazes lingering on him and his slightly worn out oxford shoes, on the dark grey suit that was clearly not tailored and a little short on his wrists. This was unnerving. And it probably was meant to be, so he would give up. If Howard thought he would, the man was much less of a genius than people made him out to be.
“We’re gonna rent a bouncy castle.” He grinned. “And one of those big inflatable slides? We’re gonna put them in Mrs Wilson’s backyard and have a big party.”
Steve’s fingers moved to caress his hair slowly and massage his scalp. “What are you thinking, my love?” He whispered, the words making warmth spread into Tony’s chest.
Tony obeyed, letting out a loud moan as his back hit the mattress and Steve smirked, sliding lower between his legs and taking his half hard cock in his mouth, sucking him, teasing him and massaging his balls until he was able to milk a second orgasm out of his blissed out boyfriend. He swallowed every drop of cum and remained where he was, cleaning up the mess of his first orgasm with his tongue.
Tony reached out, cupping his ass and tracing those wonderful abs with his tongue; his finger traced to Steve’s hole and he let out a loud moan. “You came prepared.”
“I just know them better than you do.” He retorted. “And…in the remote possibility that they do marry in different occasions, you can split it. There’s a section about each of them and how much they mean to me.”
“But come ye back when summer's in the meadow. Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow. And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow. Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so!”
“He’s not dressed as Captain America.” She added when Tony started heading towards the familiar white red and blue.
Recently, Steve and Tony started watching Star Trek together and their lovely Captain was a sucker for the team dynamics and stories of a planet united in peace under a same flag that traveled the universe to explore the unknown. It quickly became their thing. Most nights than not Tony would find himself sprawled on Steve’s couch, sharing a blanket and snacks.
Tony yawned and laid back down, closing his eyes, a small smile on his lips as Steve started playing with his hair once more, his heartbeat strong and steady, his deep voice lulling him to sleep.
Sam would call him or video chat with him almost daily, laughing and telling him stories and reassuring him that he would be back in no time. Bucky rarely answered his phone, though he knew he spoke to Peggy regularly. He already reached anger, the rest of his friends were still in the denial phase.
Sam hugged him warmly. “That’s so cool, man! I’m so happy for you. And I can’t wait to see what you come up with. Also…I know the best friend is called James but he’s clearly me, right? I’m Rhodes.”
“You’re naked.” Steve’s sleepy voice interrupted his thoughts right before two strong arms wrapped around him. Steve was also naked save for the sheet wrapped around his waist, which he quickly moved so it was wrapped around both of them as he hugged him from behind.
Tony looked at Steve, joking around with the nurse as if they were family, then back at Sarah. “I’m gonna be here a lot.”
“I had a gorgeous Irish lover once.” He said, moving to the bars and reaching out his mug for Steve, who got up and grabbed the bottle. “Sometimes I couldn’t sleep, I’d remember bad things or have bad dreams, and my sweetheart would stroke my hair and sing me to sleep.” He continued, smiling up at Steve some.
“You’re a genius.” Tony stated, chuckling and bringing his hand up to kiss his knuckles before stopping in front of a gate. The sign and the wall around it were all written and ruined and Steve frowned some, understanding that most of those were declarations of love (names and hearts were the most common things) but still disapproving of the method chosen to declare these kids’ love.
“So where will you go now, Captain? To discover this fine country and all it has to offer to a man out of time like you?”
“Where are the eyes that looked so mild? Hurroo Hurroo .Where are the eyes that looked so mild? Hurroo Hurroo. Where are the eyes that looked so mild? When my poor heart you first beguiled, why did ye run from me and the child? Johnny I hardly knew ye--”
Steve leaned down to pull him in a deep kiss. “I’ve been hard all the way here. I want you inside.” He breathed against his lips. Fuck.
He and Stan had a long talk, wrote down a number of ideas for Iron Man’s adventures that would serve the man for a long while.
He only remembered flashes after that, voices and a siren. At some point, he was almost sure he heard his mother’s voice, felt her fingers stroke through his hair as she told him: “We got you, darling. Stay with me…it’s going to be alright.”
Tony smirked lightly at him and stood up. “You know what would be fun?” He hummed. “I’d love to show you my Malibu house.”
“There is a—grey area, Steven. It appears to be a  growing mass. We would like to get a full scan to check if it’s something to worry about, something we can remove with surgery or if we need to look for…different treatments.”
One month he was doing fine, having nausea every once in a while but mostly spending his days working on Iron Man’s comics, on his art, doing groceries with Peggy, baking with Angie and helping Jacob with his homework.
“I must say…the mustard color doesn’t look particularly flattering. But does it ever?” Tony shrugged. “And, maybe it’s the teenager in me that has a particular kink about this uniform but you look hot, Captain.” He said and reached over, stroking the patch on his chest.
The soft whisper made all four people turn to the bed. Steve’s eyes were open, his lips parted in a small smile. “Stop bullying Mr Stark. Not his fault.”
Stark sipped the water and grinned up at the sheriff, leaning some against the bars. “Say, is there really something like that? Sober Irish people?”
When he was little, it was made of wooden toys, wool clothes, scraped knees and cement. The only softness he could remember was his mother gentle touch, her cotton green Sunday dress, but mixed in there the itchy scarf she brought from Ireland, the way her hands tightened around his wrist every time he got into trouble, the syringes and the shots.
Tony barely had the time to pocket the business card before both Maria and Sarah were standing in front of him. “Husband?!” They demanded, almost in perfect sync.
A small snort. “Why do you bother teaching me love songs when you could write better ballads yourself, Rogers?”
At that same time, Steve got super obsessed with Arthurian stories and couldn’t stop drawing swords and armors all over the place.
Steve raised his mug in a fake toast to his friend’s words before nodding to the outside. “Go home to your wife, James.” He said. “That’s an order.” He added playfully.
Steve stretched his hands some against his restraint, not enough to get free but enough to feel the burn of the soft fabric on his wrists.
“Shh, stop wriggling.” He breathed against the shell of his ear, enjoying the way Tony’s whole body shuddered in response before settling against the mattress again. That earned him a small kiss on the lips. “Very good.”
Steve grabbed one of the spare mugs then and poured some water, bringing it over to the cell and lightly tapping the metal mug against the bars. “Enough of that.” He ordered in a stern but amused tone. It was no news that he had a soft spot for Stark and his ways. “Come refresh ya’self after that concert.” He invited, tuning up the Irish inflections in his words for the blacksmith’s amusement.
She shook his hand and handed him a business card. “We will still need to interrogate your husband when he’s feeling better. You can call me and I’ll come here or you can come to the station when he gets out.” She offered.
“I know the vintage look is on purpose and all but some of these look like they belong in one of those porn magazines I paid my friends to buy for me when I was in college.” He complained, handing over the pictures of the night before. “Can’t we switch to digital camera for once?”
For the occasion he put on a small ponytail hair extension and pulled out from the safe the most garish jewels his mother owned –all in gold, ça va sans dire – to give that extra touch.
They had been enjoying wandering around Pisa, being tourists and taking pictures when the rain arrived. Fast and sudden like your typical summer rainstorm. Except it was fall already, but weather in Italy didn’t seem to care about deadlines. Summer wanted to keep going and Tony had no objection to that as he laughed happily, one arm wrapped around Steve’s middle, Steve’s denim jacket used as an umbrella as they ran back to the hotel. Luckily, with Tony’s money, it wasn’t difficult to get them the best suite in walking distance from the tower and soon enough they reached the hotel lobby and waved at the sweet receptionist as they made their way back to their room.
“I was and you can’t change a thing.” Tony stated in return, kissing him lovingly and taking his hand, pulling him into the elevator. “Close your eyes.”
He didn’t want to spend his last months stuck in a bed, surrounded by doctors and taking 20 pills a day. He wanted to be at home with his friends, eating shitty food, watching movies, and playing monopoly until 5 am.
“No, you’d just pay to get him out of Tony’s life.” Maria accused. “I can’t believe you would do something like that to our son.”
I'm not dead and I didn't give up on this! Just had a 4 days con in Rome working and obviously got con-flu right after. Thanks for the patience! :)
“I decided I wanted my birth name on my comics instead of Carter-Martinelli. But…Kurtzberg is way too long and complicated.”
Sam nodded softly and wrapped one arm around him after grabbing his keys and phone. “Let’s get you to a doctor.”
“Mh, I like it when you’re possessive.” Tony purred, undoing his belt and pulling his pants down, positioning himself and rubbing the tip of his cock against Steve’s hole. “But for once, you’re very very wrong.” He added, pushing in as he leaned so he could press a kiss to Steve’s broad back. “Because you’re the first person I fuck in this office.”
To be able to accept losing Pepper as wholeheartedly as Thor could accept Jane’s decision, to be able to talk about it and
And no one understands. “You can try again”, some people say. “It’s a tragedy, but life hasn’t ended yet. You can still have a family”.
The holo screens come up with coordinates and id from the sender of the warning, Agent Cameron Klein – situated in Washington, DC. – with accompanying shaky camera footage of a large mob walking down an avenue, carrying objects set in flames, chanting loudly and out of sync in a way that makes it impossible to understand what they are saying.
She turns suddenly, her eyes bright and determined, even when clouded with sadness, and she stares at Tony, giving him no way of opposing to her.  He does give her the tiniest of nods, the movement jerky and unsure, but the small
Enjoy the chapter, friends, and know we are not done with Wanda yet, but we will get there. Not now, but when the time is right. But it would be impossible not to mention her now - after all, the end of the world waits for no one.

does when he finds himself in a pinch. It makes something intense twinge inside his chest. Nebula probably doesn’t know their options here, and she is resorting to Tony’s knowledge of hospitals to find them a way out – like he had resorted to her, to help them escape Titan.
Nebula halts for a brief second, staring at nothing, and her entire body goes stiff and defensive all at once. “I am one of the strongest people in the galaxy.” She hisses at
“After last night?” Steve looks up at him from beneath his long, beautiful lashes, and Tony is caught
it for himself. Her hands find his hair and squeeze, not too gently, forcing his head back so she can look at him, her eyes frantic with worry. “Almost the entire state has no energy anymore. Soon water stations will stop too, if they haven’t already. People are gathering in hospitals because some of them still have light, but—”
Thor, who had been sitting silently and watched carefully, stiffens at the sudden attention, his eyes gleaming with some sorrowful emotion too grand for them to comprehend, but he does stand up and faces them to say:
the armor, just as the armor embraces her back, and Tony’s eyes suddenly feel too wet, too hot, too blurry for comfort.
Rhodey makes a weird noise, tight and troubled, shifting in place, but he doesn’t argue. He simply breathes in, stares, and settles. And for Rhodey, that is that.
Jarvis is not supposed to know that, but Mr. Stark has taught him a few tricks, and SHIELD’s security is not as tight as it should be; But he can’t seem to find in himself to feel any remorse for what he is doing. If anyone else in the world knew Mr. Stark had created Tony, SHIELD would know. And they have absolutely no right to keep that information a secret, while Tony is still in danger.
Clint gives him a hard nod, looking like he’s having some difficulty keeping it together, but he doesn’t let himself falter at all. He steps forward and hugs each and every one of them, giving hard slaps on Steve’s and Sam’s backs, and squeezing Natasha and Wanda so hard he almost looked like he was shaking. Maybe he was. Steve doesn’t know for sure.
“Yeah, it’s fine.” Steve tells him, and he doesn’t know if he’s lying or not. “I just wanted to know how you’re doing.”
They’re already leaving when the idea occurs to him.  It’s barely a full thought and he’s blurting it out, careless in a way he hasn’t felt in a very long time, and he interrupts right when Clint and Natasha are done

, but not only that. There’s something she’s reaching for, a specific answer out of him that he has no idea what it is, and it makes him nervous to think he could be saying something wrong. The bubble, the thin frail sheet of imaginary protection around them stretches and pulls taut like a piece of cheap plastic, and Tony desperately hopes it won’t rip.
Tony is an inexplicable mystery to him. In turn, Steve’s feelings for him are just as chaotic, just as disordered and confusing, and the more Steve thinks about it, the
“Can’t kill me that easily, sour-patch.” Tony jokes, and if he sounds like he is about to cry, that’s because he
“We need all the information we can get on those things. Make sure we’re not missing anything. Especially something that might get us killed.” Rogers says, but there is no fear in his voice. Only conviction. Only certainty.
She looks at him with wide, exasperated eyes, nearly pleading for his agreement; As if this is madness, as if hesitation is madness, as if she can't understand why he's saying this, why he's even considering such an outlandish option.
He's - Steve needs this. And Tony wants to give it to him. To give him something safe to hold on to, something he's not afraid of, something of
Natasha sounds like she is choking on her own tongue. Steve has only heard her like this once in his life, and it was when she told him, for the first time, that
“No.” Thor gives an airy chuckle. “I am aware of your aversion to anything that could be called magic, Stark. If you don’t want protection spells, that is your choice. But I do believe, that much like the Sorcerers of the Time Stone can harness power from the universe, and like the Maximoff girl could harness power from the Mind Stone, there can be a way for us to harness power from the Stones even before we manage to take them off his Gauntlet. It would allow us to fight the Infinity Stones with equal power, which might be our only chance to win.”
of explanation. “If they are moving through portals using dark energy, and that’s controlled by the Reality Stone, what are the Space and Time Stone doing? Because portals would have to mess with that, right? Space-time?”
And it sounds like it pains her to admit it. To recognize it. This barrier that still exists between them, not because of their own making but because of their circumstances, the violent separation they have been forced to endure, like the tragic lovers of an old story.
Steve gets a new wardrobe. And some pretty sweet Dodgers merch. Then almost a heart attack, when he finds out where the Dodgers have moved to, and then, he gets tickets to see them
Rogers is on the front garden of the White House, unsurprisingly fine and perfectly healthy despite having dropped from a literal airplane with no chute, looking small and powerless as the crowd roars and brandishes their torches and burning flags and signs from the other side of the gate, like lions clawing through bars, ravenous for the prey just out of reach.
“You don’t have to give money, you know that, right?” He says, trying to sound playful, as he steps into their little circle, pretending like he hadn’t listened more than the last few sentences in the conversation; No need to get knee-deep into this joke, he’ll just weasel his way out of this as soon as he deems it's unlikely Natasha will drag him back if he tries to leave.
“You want to go for full outlaw, fugitive kind of look? Really?” Natasha raises her eyebrows, taking the bait. “Hm. You might be able pull it off. You should do it.”
“I’m sorry, Nat. I’m sorry for lying.” Steve says, his voice cracking at the edges, his vision getting blurry and his breath starting to sound heaved, and he is panicking and he can’t stop it.
“We need to go.” Tony urges, slapping Thor in the arm in quick, frantic movements, to call on his attention. “Get the team. We need to go to DC,
And it catches her off guard, so much Steve sees the flash of hurt in her eyes so clearly he’s sure both T’Challa and Sam saw it too. And she doesn’t pull it back, once it does. It’s almost like it floods her and she can’t hold it in, taking a blow straight through the heart, exposing her feelings like an open wound in a single moment of vulnerability.
Rogers doesn’t look like he believes him. But he also doesn’t look like he wants to argue about it. He looks like Tony is fucking breaking his heart, and Tony has no idea why, because who cares if Tony is tired – they all are. They’re all
, to hear the smallest suggestion of the exact thing Tony feels but never dared to speak out loud, the protectiveness he had been harboring and growing slowly through years of distant vigil over that kid he met completely on accident in Tennessee, was more than enough to make him halt where he stood, and reconsider every single interaction they had ever since they met, made him dread that he truly might have taken it too far with his constant need to take people under his wing.
over Tony, over the Avengers, standing there as Tony is forced to sit down and look up at him, as if the mere difference in the level of their gazes is akin to defeat. “I doubt you would have invited me to your wedding, anyway.”
“Howard…” Maria tries to take a step back, but her body won’t move. She’s shivering from head to toe, eyes brimming with tears, so overwhelmed with emotion she’s not sure what she’s feeling at all. It’s almost too much for her already bruised heart to bear. Howard leaves the keyboard, moving to stand behind her, and he guides her down to the chair with gentle hands on her shoulders, rubbing his thumbs delicately on the tense line of her nape.
“It scared the shit out of me. I almost had a panic attack, I thought it was Loki or something, I almost hurt her when she tried to wake me up. She said I
“Are you hurt?” Tony asks instead, his gaze running through Barton head to toe, eyes sharp on any indication of an injury, but Barton simply takes in a deep breath and shakes his head. Natasha squeezes Barton’s hand even tighter and turns to Tony with a look in her eyes that makes very clear that she needs him to stay away, and Tony nods in agreement and takes a step back.
One night, after too many bad movies and an ungodly amount of cheap microwaveable popcorn, maybe with a sip or two of his best brandy, Tony finds himself alone with Steve in the common room.
“I will reopen the portal for you, just outside this library. You will be safe.” Wong assures them, kindly.
He wasn’t trying to kill Tony, and he knows this; and he knows that at that point, Tony’s heart no longer depended in the Arc Reactor to beat. But if there is one thing that Steve only remembered far too late,
His hands are shaky as he dresses. Once he’s done, surprisingly, Nebula plasters herself back to his side, tightening her hand around his back, securing his wrist over her shoulder with a firm grip – showing him, without words, that she is ready to proceed, and she wants Tony to be alert for it.
if I have to, and I will kill the bastard and bring the kid back even if none of you help me. You wanna go throw yourselves into the fire and see if it works out for you?
“I believe,” Thor says, with delicate consideration, enunciating slowly and clearly, voice barely above a whisper; Almost as if he’s confiding in Tony, something he is not supposed to share but is doing it anyway, leaning down a little so he can be more closely to Tony’s eye level, refusing to let him avert his gaze. “That just like I saw Vision, and like I saw Nebula – I saw you, and the Stones, and I think they are connected. All of them. Whether you admit it or not, you
Steve watches him out of the corner of his eye until Tony’s left leg stops bouncing slowly, and he settles quietly next to Steve, his eyes glued to the screen, relaxed and peaceful.
So when Steve comes back to the front of the Quinjet, leaving Natasha by the small cargo set they brought after she completely shut him out, and sits by the co pilot chair, Sam looks at him out of the corner of his eyes, assessing.
First of all, I want to remind you that this fic won't be Avengers: Endgame compliant. You can tell by the way it started. But not only that - just with the trailer I can already see many problems I'm gonna have with the plot of the movie, despite being very excited for it. I can already spot the inconsistencies. So, trailer or no trailer, the course of this work has not changed. And let me tell you - if my theory of what is going to happen in that movie is correct, this fic might actually be harder on Tony than the movie will be. You can't imagine how that realization makes me feel.
“I know what that’s like. To think you deserve it.” She says in a meek voice. “To think you can’t trust anyone but yourself. When I was younger, I only had Pietro. When he was gone, all I could think of was
“Is this what you guys call talk?” Rhodey raises an eyebrow at him, sarcastic, but it holds for less than a second before he deflates and sighs. “I guess I should have seen it coming – we
Tony had seen Bucky stand behind Steve with a gun on his eyes, guarded and scared, so, so scared, so afraid Tony had followed them to Siberia to continue the fight. Bucky’s mind had been
“Nat.” Steve calls her, softly, hoping they would have a bit more privacy than this; But they are on the Quinjet, going back to Wakanda, and Sam is piloting just a few meters away. The Wakandan aircraft is so sophisticated and advanced it barely makes a sound, even from the inside, and Steve knows that if Sam strained is ears a little, he could probably hear everything. But he won’t. Sam will probably recognize Steve’s whispering tone as a silent wish for some discretion, and he will give them that.
Tony takes in a deep breath, closing his eyes for a moment to gather himself, and honestly, he’s thankful Rhodey lets him do it without interruption. When he opens his eyes, he dares to look at his best friend – and Rhodey looks back with those eyes, soft with concern, the dark color shining with a twinge of fearful worry that makes Tony’s heart ache with the sad realization he’s the one who put that there, the one making Rhodey worry.
Tony knows that. They had done extensive tests to figure out the limits of her powers when she joined the team, and though Tony hadn’t been around, he definitely had been reading the results; Especially after the lovely wind-whammy she’d given him in Sokovia the first time they met. And
Steve does remember. Mostly, he remembers how many punching bags he destroyed between missions, how many miles he ran, how many times he had wanted to pick up a sketchbook but did not, but he remembers. He remembers how lonely he had been. And then, suddenly, there was SHIELD, and there was Natasha.
. Through the armor, Tony can reach Rhodey, Nebula, and Rocket; And that’s it, because they’re the only ones connected to FRIDAY. Rogers has a comm line through Natasha, and Natasha through Clint, and Carter and Ross probably have a line of their own, but
“Alright? There, I said it. I wanna go home.” Clint sighs, running his hands through his hair in aggravation, panting as if he’d just run a marathon. When no one says a word, he grunts and leans forward, placing his elbows on his knees, making sure everyone can see his face as he speaks, with utmost sincerity:
“Sorry if it’s a bit… overwhelming, or something, but I figured it’s better to have a bigger space, you know? You can decorate it, if you want. Barton sure will, he already said so.”
Steve… Steve can’t really fault her for her logic. He doesn’t like that Wanda is blaming herself for acting as her circumstances forced her to act, like she’s
in his own rose-colored lenses and in the raw, unfiltered sight of truth; And in both, she’s so beautiful it hurts to look at her and know she’s stepping away, know the rope that they both struggled to hold on to is not slipping from her grasp, not because something else is pulling it, but because she’s letting it go – and she’s asking him to do it to. For both of them to drop it, even with so much balancing on it.
When they step into the lounge entrance, big glass walls greet him invitingly and spacious, despite the sickly look of the sky outside, the cold light that filters in through the heavy clouds reflecting on the dark floors, and then—
“C’mon.” Rhodey says in a gentle mutter, giving him a supportive pat on the shoulder, his eyes terribly
“Barton is upstairs.” Tony says instead, in a whisper, voice tight between the tense muscles in his throat. He’s not sure if Rogers knows this. He probably does, but Tony feels the need to say it anyway. Though he’s also not sure what Rogers could possibly do about it, if there’s even anything to be
“You wouldn’t be digging up SHIELD files if you didn’t know what’s out there.” The man says, as if he is conceding Jarvis a win in an argument. “I’m not gonna insult you by playing dumb. You’ve seen what HYDRA can do, and you know better than to underestimate them. But you are one of the few. And right now, we who know better have to stick together.”
“What we did to Vision was to fix the connections that were broken or were never attached in him, because Ultron never got the chance to do it. Machines have wires, we have synapses, and Vision had… huh… a very, very complex network of shifting Vibranium particles. It’s hard to explain.” Bruce grimaces. “And we did it on a rush, so it was like – the technological version of a back-alley surgery. That’s why there was no way of removing the Stone without destroying Vision—”
“Could be an alloy.” Rhodey shrugs, throwing the suggestion forward as if he’s just spitballing it. “If it’s used to melt the metal, it probably has to do with whatever they’re putting in it when molding, right?”
And Tony is spluttering, is complaining and being childish, but Steve isn’t really listening anymore.
And as if that isn’t the vaguest response he could have ever given, Sam retreats from his intensity, once again falling back into his more relaxed position, turning his gaze to the clouds as well, seeming to be considering something within the safety of his own thoughts.
Finding balance again in a dynamic who has suffered a massive break is a huge problem. This is an issue I've had not just with Marvel, but with other kinds of media too, the lack of care in showing just how much having trust issues involving
Steve wants to tell her. He is desperate to get this out of his system, even though he knows it’s going to hurt, it’s going to make him angry and defensive and they will
"What are you doing here?" Tony asks, so taken aback he doesn’t really think what he’s asking until it leaves his mouth.
Tony halts, almost knocking against a wall; His hands too busy placing the nanite casing onto his chest to protect him from the impact, his feet unsteady from exhaustion and the rush of adrenaline pumping in his veins.
“You know how hard it’ll be to fix this, don’t you?” Sam murmurs in a sorrowful tone. “I know you want to fix this. It’s just… It’s just the kind of guy you are. I’ve seen the phone.”
When. When had Barton thought better of him? At the Raft, when he spit at the sight of Tony and called him a backstabber, even though he literally broke a promise to his wife and children to help Rogers in a fight he had no business starting anyway? Had Barton thought better of him when he accepted the help of SI’s legal team when his sentence was being discussed after he signed the plea nearly eighteen months after his escape from the Raft, but not once sent Tony a message after his sentence got passed, or even reduced to mere house arrest, instead retreating to his little hideaway as if nothing had happened?
He misses having his shield with him. It’s almost like being naked, going into a mission without it, and he grabbed one of the guard’s guns just for safety’s sake, even though he hates firearms with a passion. He keeps glancing at it from the corner of his eye, just by the keyboard he’s typing in, keeping all his senses alert to any indication someone is coming close to the control room. He knows there’s still a few guards walking around, patrolling the halls and the upper floors. If he’s spotted, Steve won’t ever be able to come out. He’ll be trapped here, just like the others.
“You won’t be a SHIELD agent. That would be like painting a giant target on your back. Bigger than it already is.”
, Tony didn’t quite catch it because he’d been so distracted by the minions he’s unleashed, little things that look like Roombas shooting lasers all over the city. Not difficult to beat, but extremely annoying.
alright!? He got sidetracked. It happens, even to him. Even to the mighty, the good, the righteous Captain
“It really isn’t.” Rhodey insists, sounding maddeningly bored. “People get grow spurts all the time, just because
Steve closes his mouth shut, his teeth clicking together in a painful way. Shuri keeps talking anyway.
She does. She does, she does, so much, so much more than he deserves. He can’t believe this. He can’t believe they’re going through this again, that the ground is giving away beneath their feet one more time and he has no way of grasping for a hold before it crumbles, no escape.
aware of all the ways Tony failed to protect that kid, whether they are true or not, and scorches him like physical pain—
“I want you to try it your way. I know how much it means to you. Maybe more than you can explain.” She says, but Tony is only half listening. A tear manages to escape, and he sniffs, loud, and it feels like hell. “I don’t want you to do something just because you think that’s what I want. We can’t get to a point where you just do something because you think it’s gonna make me happy.”
did to him, when he turned. They used him as an experiment because he had no one to turn to. It’s not right.”
Nebula never rises to the unspoken challenge. She merely stares back, stares until Tony’s eyes are getting tired from the unnecessary strain, dry and swollen, and after an embarrassing amount of time, he averts his gaze and takes in a large gulp of breath, retreating.
He doesn’t startle. The housing case for the nanoparticles is on top of the nightstand, perfectly close to his reach, but thought of picking it up doesn’t even occur to him. Not because he’s over whatever leftover trauma might be hiding in the deep crevices of his mind, because he isn’t, and he’s adult enough to admit it – but because he’s tired, and the touch is gentle, almost fleeting, and warm; And Tony recognizes the weight and the shape of the body fitted against his easily, the head resting on his shoulder and the leg over his, the familiar press of her arm on top of him and the touch of her body against his ribs and hip, like they’re puzzle pieces slotting together. The tickle comes from her fingers, as they barely brush against the shape of the circular scar on his sternum, slightly raised tissue barely making a bump on the fabric of his faded T-shirt, her nails teasing sensation here and there on accident, because they’re too big and the nail polished is all chipped off. But the motion is elegant and soft, just like Tony always thinks of her.
Rogers adds, his brows scrunched tightly in suspicious confusion. “To create a passage for something like New York?
To laugh, laugh nervously and broken, laugh until the high pitched hiccups of joy are loud enough that he can disguise the wet, choked up feeling in his nose and throat as the lack of air, to disguise the tears that spring in his eyes as a joke, as a folly, as something that doesn’t hurt – but it does. It hurts so –
–, and, suddenly, it settles, steady and calm, making a low hum constantly resonate against Tony’s chest.
“And Tony?” Steve asks in a whisper, distressingly, locking in his jaw in an attempt to mask the reflexive gulp he gives, uncomfortable with the aching misery that fills his chest when he says the name out oud.
“Following the trail of her powers is not something anyone could do, Captain, so I wouldn’t worry about it being a risk. The only reason why it was possible for me is because of the nature of my constitution, and the help of Mr. Stark.”
The image mimics the flickering of the light at its core, the constant swirling of energy beneath the smooth surface of the blue cube, and with it, almost like an illusion, the projection board gives the barest of flickers, as if it could feel its power from the image alone.
“You know… I was wondering where he was.” He comments, and his playful tone makes very clear he’s fine with it, but the fact he can’t resist the urge to take a jab at Steve only serves to show that Sam will now
Now he wishes he’d also learned how to deal with it properly. He never has. He dealt with his own nightmares and fears the same way he deals with any other problem, tinkering and trying unconventional options, trial and error, again and again, until he improves, until he finds a way out, until it
Tony suddenly realizes that this is yet another thing Bruce has missed. Bruce had gone away right after they had destroyed Ultron – Tony and Pepper had been on a break then.
, begging him to find a way back to the only scrap of normalcy he used to have? The only period in his life after the ice he actually felt like he was doing something? No, Steve cannot blame Scott for wanting to be with his family.
No matter that Steve now knows that he was wrong. Because he was. Only hours after their fight, Tony sacrificed himself and carried a nuke on his back inside a wormhole to save the city; Fuck, he
was the one who designed it, and Tony actually feels a little bad if he would just make something entirely new from scratch and erase all of Agent’s ideas, that he so obviously added with such enthusiasm.
“Oh, I – I would rather skip my turn on the Truth Circle, if that’s alright.” Bruce laughs, a little hysterically. “I don’t think it would be good for anyone to relive what I saw that day.”
the kind of announcement he’s waiting for. Something on the Accords. Something on Scott. Something on
“And you, Captain?” Shuri suddenly asks, turning to him from where she was standing in front of a bush of brightly colored flowers. “Are you better?”
“He is.” Jarvis nods, a tiny smile making its way known into his face. Ms. Carter gives him an exasperated look, half mad, half fond, and then she sighs – and Jarvis can hear so much in that sigh. It makes him feel nostalgic. It reminds him of the first time they met, their unlikely alliance, and the unique bond they formed over their trials and tribulations together. It makes him ache for simpler times, even though he knows those times were not simpler at all. He just had more time. More strength. More hope. But he feels hopeful now, with Ms. Carter by his side, all steel and strength as she always was, the way Jarvis always remembered her to be. “Thank you, Ms. Carter.”
God, fuck, he did, and Natasha knows. Everything as connected inside her mind now. She stares at him, at his beard, his tense shoulders, his bleeding fists, his locked jaw, his
“I know why.” He says, unkind. “Because for the past two years, no, even longer than that – you have done whatever
! And if you like my writing, please consider going to my twitter and checking out the pinned post there, it might be something you're interested in!
“I don’t think he would have.” Thor says as a defense, fully honest. “The Collector is an odd man, maybe a bit of a lunatic, but he is no fool. Even for someone like him, some powers are not to be careless with.”
And God, had they assumed. Some assumed Pepper had gotten pregnant and Tony freaked out and broke up with her. The same assholes who said Tony made her CEO to get over the guilt of sleeping with an employee, and that it wouldn’t last. Tony has no respect for those bastards. Some said Pepper had finally seen reason and realized how dangerous Tony was, how evil his tech could be and granted – Tony thought so too, sometimes. These ones always got under his skin a little. Because they have a point. What he does
what kind of metal we can find in asteroids and meteorites. We could find everything here just fine, or we could make it. What sort of metal could it be?”
, it wasn’t about being the last one standing.” Tony affirms, to this day still a little frustrated with Loki’s choice to set up his machine on Tony’s brand-new Tower. “It was
Out of all the people who stood by the Accords, the one he least expected to break them would be Vision. Natasha had broken them, but who in the world can make Natasha do anything she doesn’t want to? She comes and goes as she pleases. And although Steve knows he doesn’t really understand why she’s here – she can say she wants to help, but what exactly does she think he needs help with? Not that he’s not glad she’s here, but
He can imagine her doing so before – when they leaked SHIELD’s files to the world. He wasn’t there, but he imagines it. Natasha, completely in her element, as powerful as she is now, unflinching even though he is going straight for the enemies’ jugular, standing in its territory.
Tony has no right to feel like he should walk up to him and lay a hand on his shoulder, but he does. Christ, he wishes he could do
“It makes sense.” Bruce concedes. “No one would want an American group to just cross borders without any explanation, and then… causing explosions and just leaving.”
He goes there as casually as possible when he realizes Tony’s in, firing his repulsors at the training dummies in quick, agile motions, with the ease only a practiced fighter can have. Steve would stop and watch him for a few moments if he could, but that would be creepy, and he’s there on a mission; He doesn’t have time to dally before going to one of the available lanes and taking his shield in hand, ready to sling it at his target.
“That’s why we’re gonna follow you into this fight, and that’s why they will too.” Rocket says, after a breath to recompose himself, sounding much more confident. “We’re all in this for something that’s worth it, ya’ know?”
The being stares at him for a long, long time, before they give him the tiniest of nods, black eyes deep and endless, and locked on Tony’s without flinching. “Then get on the ship. We can go together.”
Tony thinks of the first years into their relationship, how bright and intense everything had felt, the years and years of pining for each other and still keeping a professional barrier between them mounting so many strong feelings behind it that, when the wall finally broke, the wave that came in felt just like being stepping into the sun after decades in the dark. Overwhelming, extreme, and overcoming. How they hadn’t known, exactly, how to transition from one thing to the other. It took work. She had been amazing – and Tony kind of wants to tell her that, it was not her fault, she tried so hard – but she said not to interrupt – and Tony – Tony knows what she means.
Tony may be wallowing in sorrow for losing the woman he loves, but still, his heart finds in itself strength to squeeze even harder in sympathy for Thor’s own losses, grand and raw as they are – his mother and father, apparently, his brother, and sister, his hammer, and his home. It’s enough to make Tony wonder how can he possibly still find the strength to fight.
“You can’t know that.” Shuri argues back, a little exasperated, like she’s talking to a stubborn child. “And you are not being fair to him.”
– when you used the Bifrost, what you opened was an Einstein-Rosen Bridge. I read the SHIELD files, Dr. Foster herself helped to identify the activity in New Mexico.”
“For a while. Wait for things to settle down, wait for another opportunity, and then meet him again. What do you think?”
“Son of a bitch.” Tony mutters, feeling like the ground beneath him is trembling in an earthquake only he can feel, his knees trembling with the pulse of something that threatens to bring him down, muscles weak and bones frail, a rush of cold adrenaline pumping through his veins like his blood is being frozen as it runs through his body.
someone that Steve might have liked to have beside him in battle, and he felt like he would regret forever for not having the chance to tell Tony that.
“I’ll talk to you later, Buck.” He abruptly says, hoping the forcibly light tone he uses it’s enough to hide his panic, to make him not seem so rude, not make Bucky
No. Right? No. He just – He needs to hear it again. Maybe this time it’ll make more sense. Maybe this time it’ll sound less crazy. Maybe, maybe,
“With the approval of the board. UN is the one who decides who has access to the compound. If he’s approved, he’s in.”
He means… He means that after everything, after seeing Pepper make such long arguments against his obsession with his armor – and for a good reason, Tony will admit, even if just to himself –, to see her
“And what if she joins us?” Wade nodded to Yaël, ignoring Peter’s biting question, still frozen like a popsicle. Yaël saw the curiosity in Peter’s eyes as he turned to her, also a bit distracted now, just a bit.
“Look who’s talking,” she tried to sound like she wasn’t crying. This could be the kid’s deathbed, and she wasn’t going to be around to help him. How could she? Yaël was upset, immediately imagining the boy’s funeral. Maybe she should just go to Berlin too, trying to stop the whole fight.
Peter turns to MJ, trying to find what she’s doing. She’s picked up her Italian book again, so it seems. Peter tries to read along for a bit, but gives up rather quickly. In the front seat, Rhodey turns around to address Tony.
“What happened between you two, Tony?” she asks, eyes still full of worry. Tony looks up slightly, feeling extremely guilty at the idea of keeping everything quiet. But it’s what Steve would want, no?
“I, uh, I need to go,” Peter says. He’s not even sure if she just said something or not, since all he’s thinking about is getting away from here as quickly as possible. So soon into his relationship with MJ he doesn’t really want to go down this road. Not ever, actually. No way, he’s not a cheater!
Because the next song, that one being Bohemian Rhapsody, starts. And the ones pretending to sing along to it are all the other Avengers.
“We should sto-stop,” Yaël sounded even more hoarse than usual. Steve nodded and reached her his hand. She took it and crawled back up.
He startles when his alarm suddenly goes off, and that’s when Cap’s voice suddenly comes back into his line of hearing.
“Lopt, there was something strange about him, but I can’t put my finger on it.” Charles looked pensive while he spoke.
But Parked seemed shocked. Yaël had thought the boy would be used by Wades jokes by now. The boy seemed like he was boiling.
King Eerikki looked amused after hearing Lopt’s shitty explanation. “Oh, I’m curious, what do you need?”
He went to his room afterwards, slightly panicked about it. Natasha came to visit him, to find out if everything was alright. She told him to go for it, that he was sure Tony was on the same page, but that he just didn’t know it yet.
“Where are you going, Peter?” Michelle asks. Peter points towards the hallway, phone still in his hand. He knows the screen is pointed at her, and she could easily read what it says. Michelle just leans forward. “What are you hiding, Peter?”
“You’re unbelievable, you know that! Get it in your thick head, Tony: I CARE ABOUT PETER! He’s like a son to me! If you could just stop for a moment with all your crap, you’d realize this!”
“What’cha working on?” Tony asks. Peter doesn’t look up from what he’s doing, something he knows Tony does as well when he’s concentrating really hard.
“Yes,” he assures him. Tony clears his throat and nods then, too. He grabs the book closer and starts to stand up again before letting out another sigh. Then he leans back in his seat and shakes his head.
“You have an awesome son, indeed,” Steve says, pulling himself back up until his head is resting on Tony’s shoulder. With a hand staying on Tony’s chest, the two lie together, staring at the Arc Reactor.
“Yup,” Mr. Stark says, and then he steps out of the car without any warning. “C’mon, you’re coming with me.”
“It’s for you, the gold-eyed goddess.” Korg kept on translating like the woman was talking about the weather.
Yaël had been pulling out weeds for two hours now. For once she was kind of glad with the braindead job she was doing, because all she could think of was the dream she had last night. Who was that man? Did she have to call X now? Is that what he meant with seeing things?
“Alright, give me your arm,” Mary instructs once she’s collected everything and has taken place by a semi-empty desk. Tony gives it a once-over before shaking his head.
As soon as the beeping stopped and she heard a soft crack from someone picking up the phone, Yaël started speaking because she knew X didn’t always have the habit of starting to speak as he picked up.
“Will do, bye son,” Steve says. The three give each other a long hug. But after that, they say their goodbyes. Peter closes the door to make sure his daughter is brushing her teeth, while Tony and Steve head back to the car. As Steve starts up the engine, Tony hums along with the song.
about him… Or maybe she was just trying to convince herself? No! How fucked up would it be if she was missing that one guy who put her through all sorts of misery? Next to the brainwashing into the Chitauri-attack, they had fought a lot too. Sometimes really, physical fighting.
“I’m sorry. I love you,” he returns. MJ freezes on the spot for a moment, but then she starts running. Without responding otherwise to Peter’s confession, she’s out of danger at last. Peter breathes out in relief, glad that she’s no longer in harm’s way. The relief is short-lived. The spider-sense barely even gives him a warning before there’s another kick on the side.
Steve faced Fury, called him out on his lies. Fury, in turn, decided to open up a bit, much to his surprise. Despite it, though, Steve figured that he didn’t really like what Fury was sharing.
It must be minutes when the car finally stops moving. With a groan, both Peter and Yaël start to remove themselves from their seats. While the two of them still have powers, they’re still vulnerable as any other person, meaning that trying to move still hurts like
It's a bit of a slow, calm chapter. Mostly putting a close to the accords. There's no chapter warnings in this one ^^
“Oh great, now I’m gonna hear it again,” Tony groans. Before he can stop her, Hilde’s already reaching for her comm-link to pass along the news. She turns away from Tony as she speaks, so he can’t warn her not to do it. Instead, he throws himself back until he’s leaning against the wall. When he puts his head against the stone, it stings as well. Feeling through his hair, he notices that it’s wet. Blood. Great.
Peter laughs when Johnny throws himself down on the couch after dropping his box on the table. The front door is still open, allowing for the others to come inside and carry more stuff Peter brought along.
That’s when he realizes he took his next turn too late. With the movement too abrupt, he shoots out a web to help with it but ends up with the tires of the car leaving the ground. Then, suddenly, the car tips over, scraping over the ground towards another street light?
“DAD!” he shouts again, knocking the door so hard it almost breaks. Maybe that’s their only solution here, now? “FRIDAY, I thought he was doing better?”
They break their eye-contact. MJ sighs, turning her gaze back to the people in front of them. Peter, too, looks away.
Natasha, though, is on a whole different level. Since the beginning, he hasn’t managed to even spot her a little bit; it’s as if she’s not here at all, though Peter’s sure he’s heard her laugh once or twice right after he gets hit. In agreement with Wanda, he’s made it his personal mission to get her, one way or another.
“You’re frowning, that doesn’t look pretty on you,” the man mumbled nonchalant while still hanging in the chair.
“For you, everything,” he whispers out. Steve leans his head down and presses another light kiss on the top of his head.
“Th-thank you, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, bowing his head a bit while he shows his gratitude. Mr. Stark just gives him a long look before standing up. Then he holds out his hand for Peter to shake, which he does.
; Peter recognizes him from one of the pictures Aunt May showed him when the guy appeared in the newspaper for one of his miraculous saves. He doesn’t pay any further attention on Peter as he walks towards the hospital. Huh, Peter hadn’t even noticed he was here already.
“I forced her to come with me, your highness, because I have an utterly important question for you.” Memory-Yaël poked Lopt in his side with her elbow to make him shut up, but of course he didn’t. “As you noticed, I’m not from around here, but I’m here with the quest to save this planet and probably other planets too. To do so, I need something.”
she returns. Peter rolls his eyes, jumping back up and carefully turning around the lock of the window.
Gwen looks at him sadly, but nods. “I guess we should,” she says. She leans forward and captures his lips once again, shortly. “I’m glad I got to see you again, even if it was just for such a short time.”
Peter looks up, blinking in surprise. The thought hadn’t even occurred him that he could wait with this. Then again, he’s not for nothing Tony Stark’s son; they’re both very curious people by nature, and wanting to get to the bottom of things is just… what they do;
“Well, no, it’s not the new beginning of a decade and I want to take your habits and rituals in account. Steve happened to have the same idea as he actually came over to pick you up and cook for you in the compound. I thought, maybe we could just celebrate with the three of us?” Well, what a weird but wonderful birthday had that been!
Peter nods, glad that she feels comfortable enough to share this bit of information with him. She trusts him. That doesn’t come easy for her, he figures.
The night started with Wade showing up at her apartment, carrying a big box and throwing a piece of fabric at her. The piece of fabric happened to be a very open dress, which Yaël didn’t want to wear. But she came to realization that all her clothes without holes in, which weren’t a lot, were in the laundry.
He tells about the day that Mary met Richard, how her mood changed completely, making her happier all the time. Peter liked her that way, so despite the heartache he felt, he congratulated her when she announced they were together.
With that thought mostly on his mind, he starts making his way to his bedroom. By now, it’s been mostly decorated to make it feel more like his
“I’m all yours,” Steve says, holding up his hands in surrender as he gives all the control to Tony. He, in turn, starts grinning before sitting up again.
“Tony,” Steve mutters, sounding unimpressed. Peter pulls off his belt and throws it on the ground next to his shoes.
The words sound so clear in Tony’s head. It’s impossible to ignore it, making his chest feel warm again. At least now he knows he doesn’t have to worry about it being a possible heart-attack.
Suddenly there are arms surrounding him. Not holding him in the usual embrace. Something stronger, making pressure on his chest. Tony hangs on to it as if it’s the only thing keeping him alive. While counting to ten inside his mind, he tries to keep his breathing steady.
“You just don’t get it, do you?” Tony keeps on rubbing his hand. Only that way, he’ll stay away from his chest. “I thought you were responsible; that’s why I let you keep the suit. But you let it go over your head, you ignored me. You need to understand that things can’t work the way they used to. Things need to be run over with the big people.”
Peter wants to say anything, but the words escapes his mouth. He’s quickly reminded of what he said to Ned earlier; this guy is eccentric and even that is putting it lightly. He’s just never ready whenever it comes to this man.
“Thor,” she starts, letting out another chuckle. “I must admit that when I met you, I thought you were crazy.”
Yaël noticed the change of surroundings and looked up. They were standing inside of one of the dark hallways or the castle.
“I suggest you bring in some more interns, for starters. A couple of young, innovative minds, a few extra hands along with it. See what they can figure out.”
They hang up after that. Peter drops the phone on the bed and sits up carefully to put on some clothes. After that, he decides to finally leave the room. Harry’s right; he shouldn’t make it awkward. Just pretend like it’s just a day like any other.
It’s a small mercy that she’s pretty lucid at this moment. He wouldn’t want Peter to meet her for the first time when she’s… away.
“Let’s agree to talk more in the future, okay?” he suggests. “That’s what people do when they love each other, remember?” Steve nods lightly with a smile on his lips, putting his own gloved hand on top of Tony’s. They stand there for a few long seconds until Barnes clears his throat from behind them.
“Oh, come on!” Yaël didn’t even recognize her own voice anymore as she screamed out her frustration.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m not sure it’s a good idea to just start where he left off. It’s been a couple of weeks since he’s last taken his meds. I think it’s better to take a few blood samples and discuss it with the doctor.”
“We should head home, too. It’s been a long day,” Steve then says a bit sadly, suddenly wrapping an arm over Tony’s shoulder and pulling him closer. Peter nods in understanding.
“Thought about this the entire time,” Steve admits against his lips in a groan. Tony lets out a breath before starting to pull Steve along with him.
his uncle alive for one moment longer is enough for him. The knowledge that he didn’t die here, that he’s healthy(-ish) and alive…
“You do know that, if you didn’t have the Avengers around you when I found out, I might have grounded you for life, right?”
Feeling a strong urge to smash his head against the wall, Peter turns around in the bed until his face is pressed into the pillow. He lets out a frustrated shout, hating the way his head is working in the past few days. Weeks. Months.
-	Yo, Sugarmuffin. Chasin the Squirrelgirl took me a few more days than I expected. Or maybe my decapitation did after I fell from a tree... on an electric fence.  Ukno, the sort with the sharp pin-thingies on top? Like in a jail? Not that I ended up in jail during the6 days we didn't see each other. Hehehe. Well, anyhow, I somehow ended up in Death Valley, ukno, that place with all the sand and rocks? It took me until 2day to grow back arms and hands, so now I'm able to text again. I'm still laying in the sand at the moment, since I still only have grown back baby legs... But I think I'll be back by tomorrow evening. So, what do u think? Wanna hang out?
“It’s still standing, looked like it was doing good despite the hits it got,” Peter offers. By hits, of course he means Harry turning into the Goblin and killing off most of his board members with the help of Electro. “Though I’m not sure they’re going to want you back so soon.”
“What, no greeting for the middle-child?” Peter mutters out when Tony finds himself speechless. Unable to get to an answer, Tony is frozen in place, with a kid still hugging him and two teenagers giving him a murderous look.
“Now you stay here, alright?” Tony asks. Peter turns to his Dad, mouth still fallen open with surprise. He’s got no idea what he’s supposed to be doing here. There are a few other people in here, but Peter doesn’t recognize them.
“I can’t get it off!” Peter calls out, a bit louder than before. Tony gives him a long look before he, too, moves forward and tries to take it off. When he can’t seem to make any progress on it either, Tony hums while putting a finger on his chin.
In the couch, there’s Peter’s friend Yaël, looking like she’s completely out of the world. He shouldn’t be confused she’s here, since she’s been living here for the past few weeks. Despite that, he hasn’t been seeing much of her, given to the fact that he isn’t always in the compound.
The third day, he realizes Peter might actively be avoiding him. So far, he hasn’t picked up the phone at all, and Steve has to do with whatever the news tells him. It goes from alcohol poisoning to hepatitis A to acute liver failure. Steve can’t really follow it, and he wishes he has more to go on. But, with no other way to contact anybody in New York, his hands are tied.
He’s about to make a comment on it, but eventually keeps his mouth shut when Steve gives him a sad look.
So after lots of trouble, he manages to escape from all the drunken fans, and hurries back to his tree where he grabs his backpack. Somewhere secluded, he changes back into his normal clothing. Then, with the promise of actual fun coming his way, Peter hurries back inside.
“He stopped breathing,” somebody behind him suddenly says. When Tony turns around he finds one of the nurses standing there. “Strange intubated him since he’s not breathing on his own. We’re now waiting for him to start up again on his own.”
I wanted to share this one already, because the issue will be often brought up in the second part of the story. I'm sorry if it's a bit... short, and maybe sudden.
“Shut up, asshole,” Johnny mutters towards him, giving Felicia a quick look before seemingly sobering up a little. “And hello to you.”
“I know, Anthony,” Charles returns. “But there’s a thing you’ll need to know about Miss Pryde’s powers.”
! Seriously, how has Mr. Stark not donated you to a local high school already? I’m going to have words with him, and I’ll make sure it won’t by my school you’re donated to, mark my words!” Peter rambles on, drying off his hand on his already ruined jeans. Dum-E only responds by pushing the banana back in Peter’s reaction. With a sigh, he rolls his eyes only to take the half-peeled banana from him.
“Shut up, Barton. When you’re robbed of an awesome day of awesome and endless sex you’ll react the exact same way,” Tony snaps back. Clint’s face pulls together in disgust. Barnes just lets out a sigh.
Without giving the other things any attention, Tony opens the file with a blink of an eye. There’s more documents in there, along with one video file.
He’s going to have to join Tony’s team to face Steve. Steve, Captain America, the man Peter has almost come to see as a father-figure in the past few weeks. This is just all kinds of fucked up. Is it him, or is it getting harder to breathe?
“We’ve apprehended three men, who have been taken into custody. As far as we know, they’re the buyers, and not the sellers, which means we’re nowhere,
"You know what? I'll come to your apartment. Mister Fury and I were planning on checking up on you more frequently, but we're both busy men, as it seems... I'll see you tomorrow, Yaël. Good night!"
Tony had been a bit sad when Steve admitted that he didn’t want kids. He’d thought he lost something before he even had it. He had been angry at Steve without ever telling him, pretended that everything was fine while, for a whole week, he was about ready to decide the relationship couldn’t work like this anymore before he came to his senses.
But then, after a few seconds of just gentle breathing, the spasms seem to begin. It starts in Peter’s fingers, going up to his arms until his entire body is moving up and down on the bed. Like before, his eyes are open, looking lifelessly at the ceiling. For a short second, Tony has no idea what he should be doing here. In only a matter of seconds, his brain directs him to the internet to look up some instructions.
He messes around a bit more, even sticking the Iron Man’s arms against the shattered windows and pulling off his mask slightly while he asks where they got their weapons. But an answer is never given, when the Hulk loads up another gun, and suddenly a purple beam is blinding him. Sparks are flying everywhere, heat coming too close to Peter’s suit – the fact that he feels that means that it’s
Tony lets out a long breath before sitting down in his chair. The smile he gives Peter is faint. He hunches forward, clapping his hands together and observing his fingers carefully.
Yet Steve hesitated. For a few more weeks. Then, when he had to leave, chasing down a lead for Rumlow, he had enough of it.
He gives the doors of the elevator a kick before making a complete turn to get to the stairs. Preparing himself for the three floors he’s about to go up, he starts walking.
She isn’t carrying flowers in her hands, instead holding some sort of silver crown between her fingers. It looks like a smaller version of the helmet Thor is wearing, more intended as a headband or a tiara of some sorts.
Not that Peter minds, of course; he only wants the best for Mr. Stark. But even Peter notices the way Steve is around him. Always trying to touch, but also trying not to touch too much. He’s always worried, calling out for Mr. Stark whenever he only sneezes even. Peter has made multiple mental notes that he should ask Yaël about it, since she seems to know Steve a lot more than Peter does.
“It’s alright. I’m surely just overreacting like you said,” he returns, turning back towards the door.
“Dude, I think you got him fired!” Yaël said as they took the cab back to her apartment. Wade shrugged.
“Okay, what’s happening? Please don’t tell me you’ve invited that douche from security? Or the X-men? Because I really don’t think we have much space in here, anymore.”
“So, do you guys call each other Sweety now? If you get kids, who will be the mom?” Yaël rattled while resuming their stroll. Her thoughts automatically went to Peter. That kid had two dads now, well, kind of. He still hadn’t answered her text. He was coming tomorrow, right?
“No, I mean, you both live in the tower, together. He’s moved into the penthouse. You two are… happy? I don’t know, there are still arguments but…”
Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. As a reflection, Yaël checked on her friends. Peter had disappeared, which gave her an immediate heart-attack. He might be Spider-Man, but he’s also a young guy who can die as easily as any human. Right? Or made the Spider-stuff him immortal? Yaël should research that later.
“In October, I got diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder after my aunt sent me off to a few doctors. They started treating me immediately, giving me meds and sessions. I still failed my classes, but by January, things started to get a bit better.”
I might have finished writing the third chapter of the sequel to Being A Stark yesterday. As it turns out, I'm having trouble finding a name for the title. In case anybody has any ideas for it, don't hesitate to let me know! I'll add a little summary for it in the end notes :-)
Being Spider-Man with the bag on his back isn’t particularly the best way to swing around. It’s a weight, and it messes up his swings or landings. But on the other hand he doesn’t want to risk leaving it around again, either. So the first thing he does is swinging to Stark Tower, where he climbs up the building and lands on the balcony of the penthouse.
“Oh please, it’s not like it’s anything I haven’t seen before,” Pepper says, unimpressed. Tony just holds on to his pants, making sure she doesn’t pull them down.
By the time he gets home again, he’s glad to say that all he’s got was a warning. At least it’s better than being fired, right? His arms are tired and once the door is closed behind him he leans back against it, probably able to fall asleep on the spot. But then his eyes drop back on the boxes full of books. Right, he had left them in the hallway.
Peter sighs, gets to his locker and takes out his books for the next course. Ned is at home, sick for the day, so Peter’s once again walking alone. His earbuds are already in, and there’s some music playing softly while he wanders through the hallway.
Once he gets back out, he almost stumbles against Steve, who is preparing himself to knock on the door of the workshop. The two apologize, but as soon as Steve sees him – and maybe recognizes him – he starts to frown.
“What for?” he asks in confusion. Then realization hits him as he takes another look at the hospital room around him. “Oh, right…”
“Not yet,” he says with a smirk. Right after that, the door opens and a guard walks in. Where Peter would have expected for Steve to pull away and pretend nothing happened, the Super Soldier remains where he was.
They’re seated next to Peter, who is sitting next to MJ. Then, there’s Johnny and Yaël, who are sharing a bowl of popcorn and end up laughing at every scary scene in the movie. They might be ruining a bit, but it helps as well. Peter quickly realizes that he doesn’t really like scary movies. On the last couch, Wanda and Vision are seated. Though they don’t seem to react on the movie all too much, there are a few times where Peter catches Wanda grabbing Vision’s hand without saying a word.
Tony nods, still unable to speak. He lets out a long sigh, allows Peter to pull back. The two look at each other for a moment before Tony points his finger at Peter’s chest.
Peter’s senses are tingling almost non-stop. Just when he’s lost Steve behind him, Vision randomly appears from through the wall, pointing his own gun towards Peter, who shrieks and only barely manages to avoid it.
“Bruce, you’re back,” Steve says the moment he walks in and spots Bruce standing there. Tony is already seated and the other two follow suit.
“Listen, he’s the Vulture-guy Petey was going after. And when he realized Peter was his daughter’s date to homecoming, he gave him the chance to back out, or otherwise he would kill Peter and his family.”
And that’s when he smells it. Peter blinks a few times, taking multiple small sniffs in the air as he tries to place the odor. It shouldn’t be here. Why does it make him feel so uneasy? He stands up, dropping the mask on the couch and heading towards the kitchenette.
There are others that he’s never seen before, but then again there are people here from all over the world. Even freaking Deadpool is wandering around here, though so far he hasn’t come to drool all over Peter, so that’s a plus.
“Yeah, sounds good. I know a few bots that are dying to see you again,” he says with a smirk. Peter guiltily thinks back of the last time he’s seen Dum-E, or U, or Butterfingers. It’s been too long, and he can’t really say why. “And you can finally get to finish that own bot of yours. You haven’t touched the thing ever since I gave you your new suit.”
Still no answer. Tony’s not feeling like saying anything, anyway. There’s footsteps in the background, slowly nearing the bed.
“Dear Loki,” Yaël smiled, “since I have a hole in my leg and my hand and a scar on my forehead, I’m not that easy to look at anymore. That, and I heard you have stools in your showers.”
“No, no, no, I’m not!” Peter says, and the first thing he thinks to do is just press the button to get out of the suit. It comes loose all around him, and falls down on the ground while Peter ends up standing there in just his underwear.
But on the other hand, it’s not like he can see much. Not even ten seconds ago his helmet has been crushed by whatever their monster of the week is, before being thrown away like he’s nothing more than a doll a child doesn’t want to play with anymore.
So carefully he takes him into his arms, carrying him bridal style as he brings him to the bedroom. He nods towards Natasha who is in the same position but only headed to the elevator.
Could it be Venom? Is it actually possible that the thing would seek out Peter in search for a fight? Peter hesitates for a few seconds, wondering if it’s a good idea to open the door. He’s frozen on the spot, unknowing of what he should do.
Peter doesn’t know why; he’s an outsider, nobody they know. How is it that they take him in so easily?
Thanks for the sweet comments and kudo's! I always smile whenever I get a notification. It really helps me through this story! Big virtual hugs to you all <3
“Your dad? Peter I thought you lived with your Aunt?” Ned asks, now obviously completely confused. Peter shakes his head and smashes his forehead a few times more to punish himself. Then he looks up, holding up his hand pleadingly.
“No way,” he mutters, jumping inside of the building. He drops down next to the man with Dr. Strange, who is creating some weird orange symbols that give light out of his hands. Peter would have been more impressed, but there’s no time for it right now. “Dr. Banner! Where have you been!” he shouts.
So this came out in between *cough* studying *cough*. I'm sorry if it feels a bit rushed, my mind is wandering off all the time, it's weird!
Mr. Stark gives him another long look before nodding. Then he puts the bottle with pills away and clasps his hands together.
The song changes immediately. There’s the drum-line that belongs to only one song, along with Jay-Z’s humming. The background goes up into the sky, a group of male dancers start dancing along. And as Rihanna’s voice fills the room, Peter suddenly emerges from behind the umbrellas. The girls holding them stand up while Tony’s son walks forward, wearing clothes that make Tony think back of that one video.
Steve starts crawling to Tony while Bucky is holding on to his leg. Tony bites his lips together to keep himself from laughing. It takes a little while for Steve to reach him at last. He climbs up on the couch, and immediately cuddles up to him. Meanwhile Bucky is still holding on to Steve’s leg.
Rhodey just bugs Tony in that caring way he always does. Where others give up after asking Tony to do something, Rhodey just keeps on asking until Tony either does it because it’s driving him crazy, or until he starts swearing, leading to a shouting match between the two until they both stop and start laughing it out on the floor. They try not to do the latter whenever Peter is present, though.
Steve is quiet on the other side of the line. Peter wonders how it’s like on his side; unable to get out of the rubble fallen over him in the explosion, stuck with his unconscious partner who is probably the only one right now who can calculate their way out of that situation.
Okay, so not exactly like Tony’s team. He knows the Ant-Man and Wasp are only part of the team here because Tony obviously isn’t.
“Where’s your babysit?” Peter asks Tony, putting down the cup of coffee he brought along on Tony’s desk as soon as he nears him. The engineer looks up at his son, and offers him a smile.
“Don’t tell me you don’t know how to get out?” she heard the man mumble bitterly. He made her feel dumb.
Tony laughs then. He’s about to comment about liking his sense of humor, but then T’Challa’s phone goes off. The King looks down to his pocket, and he fishes out a device that looks maybe even more advanced than the latest Stark Phone. Maybe Tony can get some inspiration in his coming few days here.
They go by foot. Johnny tells him it’s not that far, and Peter believes him. With his hands stuck into the pockets of his pants, Peter follows Johnny on the sidewalk. He’s right, of course, when they arrive after only two short blocks. The party is at a large apartment building, though it looks pretty… not abandoned, but it might need a lot of TLC, to be honest.
Tony steps out of the car, keeping his glasses close since it’s his only link with his newest Iron Man suit. Locking the car, he gives the hot sun another glare before walking up the stairs. It’s hot – extremely hot. It’s one of the reasons he’s chosen for a white suit instead of a black one.
But his mother still got the air strangled out of her. After that, the video ends with Barnes aiming towards the camera. After that, it’s only static, which represents exactly how Tony is feeling inside right now.
“Everything alright?” Peter asks, a bit concerned as to why Steve would drive all the way here. The man just nods and lets out a small chuckle.
strong. It feels like an entire building has been dropped on him. Granted, there has been, but that’s not really what matters now.
“Just take your time, Peter. You can even sit down, take a look at the documents. When you’ve found it, just come back to me and we’ll look it over,” Mr. Stark says, putting his healthy hand on Peter’s shoulder and squeezing it shortly before starting to walk out of the room to give Peter a bit of privacy.
“Alright, second time will be better,” he mutters, reaching his hand towards the skyscraper next to him. And that’s when he realizes it.
Yaël never took her sandwich, she just turned around and ran out of the bar. She ran and kept running, she sprinted until she noticed a liquor store.
“Ah, lots of partying, I assume?” Francis asks with his arms crossed and an amused look on his face. Peter chuckles but shakes his head.
“Are you okay?” he yelled at her from above, looking at her, panicked. Yaël looked back down and saw her memory-self laying under her, not moving anymore. Yaël tried to swallow away the terror. “That’s not you! You’re clearly still alive, Yaël!” he pulled once more, and she followed him, climbing out of the grave. Once she was out of it the sigh she let out trembled, staring at the two men who were still casually filling up the pit.
He’s the reminder that he needs to go to sleep. The reminder that he should take his pills at regular hours. His reminder that he’s not a machine and still needs to eat. In a way, he takes care of Tony in a manner that Tony’s not really used to. Sure, his mother took care of him, and Jarvis did, too, back when he was still alive. Even Aunt Peggy took care of him for a while after his parent’s deaths.
It’s not that he wants to do anything with it, but in all honesty they both must have forgotten about it in all the drama. Now that it’s mostly over, he wants to have another look at it. L-
she answers. Then she hangs up without saying anything else. Peter wonders if she’s angry for him heading off without a warning, but there’s nothing more to do about that. Quickly, he turns the phone on silent and puts it aside, turning back towards Tony and trying to appear like he’s not too embarrassed about what just happened.
It’s not that he wants the world to know about Iron Man. It’s more that he needs to get to the Avengers’ base – where-ever that is. He needs to see where they stand, and if they could possibly want to help him out. Or rather… he needs to find Strange.
“The spider that bit Peter… it was radioactive,” Bruce says. Tony understands now why he was brought along with this. “With the way its venom merged with Peter’s DNA over the past few years… it makes the radioactive poisoning rather severe.”
Yaël wished she had come to Asgard on a more peaceful time so she could take her time to look at the magnificence of the Rainbow bridge, instead of seeing it getting smudged with blood by the Hulk, fighting a big black wolves on one side and Asgardians clashing into…zombies on the other side.
When Peter suddenly announces that he needs to leave after getting a phone call, Miles watches him go with mild confusion. The others don’t seem too bothered by it so he’s learned not to ask too many questions. Though, one day if he isn’t careful he’s going to follow Peter around to see just what he’s up to whenever he runs off. Not that he doesn’t trust him; it’s more that curiosity of his that gets the better of him.
He wishes he could say it wasn’t his fault, but he knows it is. The combination of school, the internship
“And you’re sure it’s him?” Natasha asks the person on the other side of the line. Peter goes to the counter where Tony is standing, and offers him a short smile. Tony just nods at him in return, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder for a few seconds.
Steve rolls his eyes, taking Tony’s face into his hands and leaning forward to kiss him on the mouth again.
“Well, we’re fiddling around, you know…Mr. Stark is working on some kind of cool suit for someone but he hasn’t told me who it is for yet.”
Jane; it’s obvious all over his face. Steve’s just glad that his teammate got to find somebody he wants to spend the rest of his life with. “Only hours ago I made the dear Captain listen to the longest wedding vows ever written on Earth, according to him. According to him, I had been speaking for eleven minutes without interruption. But I found that even in those eleven minutes I did not find that I managed to explain all my feelings towards you correctly. Because I fear I cannot put it into words, still.”
Movies don’t always manage to show the fear the heroes feel whenever a love-interest is lost. They make it look like it’s a short pain, and then they do a fast forward to show that the hero eventually is fine. But life’s not like that. It took Peter months, more than a year to finally feel a little bit more like himself after Gwen’s death. Is he over it? Hell no, that’s not really going to be soon, either. But it’s manageable.
So that’s why she stood in front of the apartment Peter lived in the next day. Yaël had bought some ice cream, because ice cream made all the pain disappear, it was pure magic. She didn’t have to teach that day, seeing the job X gave her wasn’t a fulltime one. He couldn’t make her fill in enough hours with these two subjects to create a fulltime job. But she didn’t bother, a job was a job.
Wanda, on the contrary, has her brown hair loose. Her dress is red as her uniform, and she’s wearing some sort of black apron on top of it. There’s the usual dark armbands and necklace. She looks amazing. She’s accompanied by Vision, who looks a bit out of place next to her with his brighter colors. His uniform looks a bit like Peter’s, only his cape is golden as well. His clothes are in the grey/purple variety.
“Holy shit I would just love for this crap with the accords to be over with soon,” Tony mutters, rubbing his brow and shaking his head as he reads the note. “You goin’ out this evening?”
old monitor on the desk, his heart aching at the ancient technology this entire wagon uses, limited by the technology of their time. The screen is lid up, and there’s one single message popping up on the screen.
"- have it checked out, but I'm not sure we'll like the answer," Tony says in the background. Peter gives Johnny a look, telling him to stay quiet. Johnny just gives him a blunt stare in return. He's not planning on talking anytime soon.
There’s no sound around him, everything surrounding him blurring. The only clear thing is the giant holding his son in one hand, lifting him up like he weights nothing. His mouth is moving, but Tony doesn’t know what he’s saying.
on destielallaround.tumblr.com where I'll be posting these once they are completely finished and edited!
“He’s been living here all week,” Wanda explains, but obviously leaving out a few details. She probably figures it’s not her place to talk about this. Instead, she pulls him along the moment Cap starts to walk away, probably on his way to meet Vision. Peter’s eyes still make brief contact with Mr. Stark’s when the man looks up, and a strange feeling passes through him after that.
“You were worried. I don’t blame you.” Steve holds on for a few seconds more before pulling back. “Now, how about we go and check out how he’s doing?”
Wade jumped back up, grabbed Yaël’s hand, pulled her behind him and somehow managed to run passed Logan, back into the hallway. She looked behind and saw the Wolverine sprinting behind them, his claws made horrifying sounds as he made them scrape against the wall.
“LONG LIVE PENIS PARKER!” everybody shouts in return. The following hour goes in a haze; people try to take pictures with him, some girls dance and even lean forward to kiss the mask whenever Peter least expects it, and eventually, he has to admit that it’s time for him to go.
Mr. Stark raises his eyebrow, but he doesn’t move at all. His elbow is on his leg, and he’s leaning forward a bit. His fingers are no longer bound together – though Peter is sure they shouldn’t be out of their bandages so soon.
“Like I don’t realize that!” he was taking over her energy, which made him talk back at her with some frustration. But Yaël could easily handle that, she even threw him a wide grin and grabbed his shoulder.
“Am I wooing you, yet?” Tony asks once he closes up the car, pulling Steve along by his hand towards the destination he has in mind. It’s only around the corner of the street they’re parked in, so it’s not far at all. Steve still has no clue.
“Peter!” Tony calls out, and before Peter knows it he’s got his father’s arms wrapped around him. “It’s alright, son, I’m here.”
“Peter deserves his parents,” he mumbles. This is probably exactly why Strange didn’t want him to go back here.
“You’re lucky you didn’t break anything, you know that?” Steve said while patting her shoulder with his other hand. Yaël nodded.
But they’re going to make the best of it. Because the Carters and Sousas will be there! And while Peter might only have seen a few of them once or twice, he’s been in contact with the younger generations sometimes through Facebook.
Peter gives Tony an unimpressed look. Meanwhile, the girl lets go of Tony and runs towards what Tony figures are her two brothers.
who might look familiar to him. He texted MJ about ten minutes ago, but she’s not coming as she’s preparing another protest with a few of her… uh, not exactly friends since she doesn’t have that many? Fellow protestors, maybe?
Peter shrugs. “Ah, you know, some sightseeing. It’s never dull here in Switzerland,” he says. The two women start laughing again. After that, he listens to their stories about their missions in the past. He feels good, his Dad is about to be better, too.
The quinjet is already on the landing platform on the balcony. Clint salutes Tony once he sees him, but the others are busy talking to each other. The moment Steve is close enough, he asks for a status update. Natasha is the first one to respond.
They play games, watch some awful movies for children, and even go and take a walk in the park when FRIDAY suggests it might be good for Peter to get some fresh air. Today, Peter is wearing his newest Spider-Man onesie.
“Karen you’re still there?” Peter asks while keeping an eye on the girl’s light hair. She should have chosen a darker hair-color if she didn’t want to stand out so much.
Mr. Stark doesn’t react to it, instead turning around and pulling up his phone. In the hallway now the leftover teenagers from detention appear, taking in the carnage that is left in the building. Flash looks in horror when he sees that the football-trophy has been destroyed.
“Spidey! Come to play?” Goblin calls out, and at that time he throws out some of his bombs. Peter is a bit too late to notice them so the jump to the side isn’t enough to avoid getting blown away. He lands with his back against a tree, head hitting the bark hard enough to make him see spiders dancing around him.
“Yeah, uh, I broke a few fingers, earlier this year. Nothing major, and it healed up pretty quickly, but, I don’t know, they’re still a bit stiff so I can’t work on the small stuff as well as before,” he admits. He doesn’t even know why he’s telling him this, not even Steve or Tony know about it. “I suppose it’s just old bones.”
“You’re getting married? Isn’t that a bit soon?” Sam asks, suddenly appearing as well. He doesn’t seem as put off as Clint when it comes to a half-naked Steve Rogers.
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers is here, said he wanted to talk with you,” the woman says, keeping her hand on the door-handle. Mr. Stark nods and waves at her that she can go, which she does without another word. Quickly after that, the door opens again, revealing none other than Steve Rogers.
,” Yaël thought back to Charles. She had just arrived at the front door of the apartment building. She was only a few staircases away from kicking out her shoes and bingewatching hershows.
It took a bit of convincing, but eventually everybody seemed to agree it might do him good to just take some time off and spend it in another country.
Tony looks down at his wrist where the watch Deadpool gave him used to be. He’s glad he thought of removing it before coming here. This watch should be locked away. Sure, he’s grateful for Wade’s help, but a person as instable as him shouldn’t have this on him.
“Thank you, Katie. You can just put it on my desk,” Tony says, seeing her walk to the middle of the room and drop it where he’s told her. Then he watches her go, and his eyes go back to the clock above the door. About ten more minutes before the last kid comes in. Maybe he should just start his research about him? Most kids don’t like it when he looks them up with them around, but on the other hand it feels weird to listen to the kid when he already knows everything about him.
“That thief is not even from this kingdom, the only kingdom. That’s sure. Now, let me look at this girl’s eyes.” Yaël watched herself took a step back out of shock. Lopt looked at her confusedly. The guard grabbed her arm and pulled the fabric away with his other hand. When the memory-Yaël looked down, the guard roughly tilted her head so she was forced to look the king in his eyes.
to something, I’m not sure. Not-just-friends, but not-yet-lovers kind of thing. At least on her part. And now, seeing how Vision got when he saw her… I’m thinking it might be mutual. And it’s…”
“Wait, for real?” Rocket balks, and seems stunned into silence when Tony nods in affirmation. “Well.. Yeah, maybe. That could be useful. I mean, I got a good look at the batteries, I could probably make some if you can get me the stuff.”
chat or asks. I'll be tagging anything related to the movie as "endgame spoilers", to make sure it doesn't bother anyone who doesn't want to see anything until they've seen the movie.
“I’m… still trying to figure it out.” Tony exhales, long and winded. “I know how it sounds crazy, but apparently the fact Nebula got here with me is also a big deal. I’m somehow also involved.”
was? How can he explain, in simple words at least, how the act of simply looking at Peter inspired in him the most overwhelming urge to… be
But she allows the search anyway. It’s illogic, and stupidly sentimental, but she also doesn’t think Steve deserves to have his body lost in the ocean for eternity. If Howard finds him, she tells herself, at least she will have that tiny peace of mind.
Sam has gotten up and is making his way back inside the building by the time Steve comes back to himself. He jerks a little, shaking himself off of his stupor, and he turns around to see that Sam is almost at the door, and Steve still has to say one thing before he leaves.
in him felt like when he watched her fall and thought she’d died. He knows that’s what she felt like when Tony flew the nuke through the wormhole. Or like when Vanko came to him in Monaco, or Ultron, or Thanos. That’s what she always feels.
Steve took in a deep breath, letting himself imagine that for a moment: Tony laying on a table in the middle of the museum, his expression lax and lost, little moans and breaths escaping his lips as Steve painted his abdomen with wax.
“They’re both asshole genius, they’re probably besties.” Natasha said and Tony should have been offended but he could – somehow- tell she was just teasing him. He was becoming rather good at reading her signals. That, and it was kinda true. He and Reed had known each other since childhood. Long before becoming superheroes through accidents that should have killed them.
Tony watched as Sarah moved to pour some water and leaned in to press his lips to Steve’s tenderly. “I love you.” He told him, stroking back his hair. “You scared me.”
“Promise me.”  Tony insisted. “Promise me you’ll do anything you can to fix this. I love you, I don’t want anything bad to happen to you.”
“Where are we going?” He asked gently as he followed Tony one evening, the sun was setting and Steve ached to stop and take pictures but Tony was urging him along.
Dreamt he was sitting on a couch in Tony’s lab and Tony was telling him about his past, about his family and his friends. Eventually, once he was done fixing the piece of armor, Tony came over and sat with him, leaned down to kiss him.
Tony, like the best chess player, was always planning four moves ahead. And with Steve it was a real challenge since the Captain was also a very good strategist.
Clint commented and Tony tipped his hat at him, stumbling over to where the archer was, dressed as a cowboy, and grinned.
He took the box to the room he decided would be his art studio and started placing his drawings in a nice album so he could keep them around. For some reason when it came to Iron Man…Steve put it in a plastic sheet to avoid ruining it any more than he had already and put it back on the wall, right above his desk. He should really give this cute comic another chance. Maybe he could give Iron Man a backstory and a couple adventures, try and sell it to a publisher even.
Okay, more like every word she learned in English, since she’d only speak Norwegian and Sil. But the spy figured out that being some kind of terrorist or being a blind-raged weapon without soul didn’t fit Yaël’s profile. Of course Yaël hadn’t known better back then, during the attack, since the Chitauri had managed to trigger her until she had reached a blind spot.
“I’ve moved on as well,” she admits. “It was hard, and I didn’t want to let you go, but there comes a point where you meet somebody and you think: ‘it’s time’.”
He doesn’t need to say it, but Peter understands it either way. He stands up to take his bag again. Then he starts walking to the opened door. He gives Tony one last look, then a wave. Tony nods at him with a smile. After that, Peter’s walking out.
“Yeah, right,” he mutters out. After that, Barnes and Wanda go to their own spots. When Wanda sees Peter, she gives him a smile and a wave. Peter waves back, glad to see her again after such a long time. They’ll get the chance to catch up later, he figures.
she answers. Figures, the guy really thinks everything through. He can maybe try to hack it? But then again, this is
“Yes, and I’m here to propose something.” Nilla didn’t react, so Yaël continued. “Let’s start over, like completely. You stop being like… this… and I start to be there for you as a real sister.”
“Yeah,” she said, “I told you it was bad.” Looked back down and teared the patches off. It saddened her, she had to carry those scars the rest of her life. For a second, Loki looked confused, then, without another word, he left her alone so she could take her shower.
“Good boy,” he says, forcing up a small smile. He should continue. The sooner it’s finished the better he can make sure that something like the ‘infinity war’ doesn’t happen again. Or, if it does happen, that he’s at least not so easily taken out of commission.
Eventually he does. It falls out from his hands, hovering into the air for a few short seconds until another figure appears. Tony reaches out for it immediately, getting figure a little bit smaller than him in front of him. Tony takes a deep breath at the warm feeling he’s getting while looking at him.
“Yeah, I’ll go take a breath,” Peter says, pushing himself up and getting back on his feet. He’s aware that Francis is saying something else, but Peter doesn’t hear it. He just stumbles forward, keeping his hand on the wall as he heads towards the door that will bring him to the roof.
“Rogers-Stark,” Tony says before standing up. He lives for that wordless expression on Steve’s face as Tony gets back to his feet and starts walking towards the kitchen with his now empty glass in his hands. Then, behind him, he can hear Steve mutter to himself.
“Uh,” Yaël looked back to her students, many of them were staring at Steve with their mouth wide open, as the bell rang right after the two men walked into her class. “Okay, Icarus, it’s your turn to choose next week’s song we’ll be working on.” The teen with enormous, feathered wings, simply nodded before he grabbed his bag and walked towards the door. Right before walking out the door, he stopped and turned.
people who need it. Because this is not a favor I’m doing for you,” he tells him in a low voice. Strange then walks off, returning to the room to continue his conversation with Peter and May.
“You need me to join?” Yaël asked Peter. Sure, she knew that was a bit of a weird proposal, but this Tony caught her attention and she didn’t want Peter to faint out of stress.
“The Helicarriers… They would have… look, Bruce and I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you, so thank you.” Tony put on the sunglasses and started walking out of the room. Steve started to smile, then, looking back at Tony’s retreating back.
How is he any different from his father? At least Howard didn’t beat Tony’s mother… Did that make him better than Tony?
“I don’t know what’s happening? Did something happen? Did they drop the charges?” Peter asks. Steve lowers his gaze and Natasha shakes her head.
“Because it’s a prequel to a major in electrical engineering, and though it interests me, I’m also interested in biochemistry,” Peter explains. His piece of bread is finished, and when he wants to turn to Wade to ask for a new piece, he finds the guy knee-deep into the water while having a conversation of his own with the ducks.
Within a second, Yaël was steering water into her hand, froze it in her fist into a sharp shape and started throwing these pieces of ice, one by one against the cracks she was making with the rocks she was steering with her other hand. To be able to keep making ice, Yaël needed to distract some water from her own body. Which made her, by the time the glass shattered into pieces, dehydrated, cold and exhausted.
Peter gasps out in surprise, though he should have expected for the Goblin to taunt him. Not really in control of his anger, Peter cries it out as he rushes towards the other figure, holding his fist ready to give him a blow in the face. Before he can make contact, the Goblin flies back up in the air and moves to the side, away from Peter’s angry blow.
He’s gently put back into bed, and there’s another hand going through his hair. Though this time it’s different; while Tony really goes with his fingers over Peter’s scalp in some sort of massage, this gesture is more like being petted. He doesn’t dislike it at all, but he recognizes the difference immediately.
“What little guy?” he asks, but then he understands. He means the victims, the people that get to be in these crime-scenes and can’t do anything to protect themselves. “I mean, yeah?”
“Anyway, since she came storming in without an appointment, security dragged her away before I could even give her an answer – which would have been ‘no’, of course,” Tony says. Peter snorts once more before shaking his head. He takes another bite from his apple, and then throws it into the bin with perfect precision.
It’s close to evening already. The sun is already under, and the snow is blowing in Peter’s face. It’s somewhat nice, to have that feeling in his face. It reminds him of the fact that, despite everything, he’s still alive.
Miles startles when his phone goes off. He takes it out of his pocket to check who it is, only to see that it’s Uncle Aaron. He smiles, picking up without a second thought.
In the following hour that Miles spends here he’s greeted by close to fifty people maybe. They’re all grateful for their help, to which they always say that it’s no trouble at all.
“Yeah, I do. But that didn’t stop me from kicking the crap out of him now, did it?” Tony returns with a bitter tone in his voice.
Tony takes him to a little hallway. The door is open there, and Peter can see Pepper standing there. She offers him a smile and walks up to him. When she reaches him, she takes his face in her hands and presses a kiss on the top of his head.
the Stormbreaker. The axe is hanging over his shoulder, underneath the cape. Mjölir, though, is hanging over his hip, looking so in place next to him. It was hard to imagine Thor with another weapon, so seeing Mjölnir next to him is kind of comforting.
Suddenly Yaël heard voices, not coming from the woods or anything. They seemed like they came from nowhere, no direction. The voices were just there. They were arguing, and it took Yaël a while to recognize one of the two voices as the man she had been talking to in her last dream.
She looked so emotionless, like she didn’t even notice what she was doing. Even though her hair had its natural color, it was clearly her. Yaël’s continuously changing eyes were striking. The noise of people yelling and screaming drummed into her ears. Everybody in the sandwich bar turned to her.
But that means that Tony is left alone with Peter; the genius sixteen-year-old teenager with mental issues and who also happens to be Tony’s only (as far as he knows) son. Said son who
“If I fought well,” Yaël countered, “my leg wouldn’t look like a failed attempt at scrambled egg right now. I guess I need more training.”
On the other hand, she also hopes they haven’t yet dropped the case, because this plan could just be hilarious.
Peter obeys, allowing Natasha to guide him to where he needs to go. When she points to a whole group of people sitting there, looking deep into discussion, he frowns.
Normally Tony drives, but he forgot his glasses at home. Steve forbade him to get behind the wheel after it got dark. Tony’s not going to argue about it; he’s 70 after all. He’s all too aware he’s not the youngest in the world anymore.
“The queen told me you’d say stuff like that, but don’t worry. I’ve been keeping an eye on you for a few weeks now, I know who your friends are and where they live. Like that boy with his aunt.” She was talking about Peter! Yaël gritted her teeth. “Or that man with her motorcycle.”
Peter nods eagerly before pulling away and lying down again. Then he grabs one of the books that must have been under his pillow, and he puts it into Tony’s hand.
“Hey, Flash!” Michelle shouts as a distraction, and that’s Peter’s cue. In just a matter of seconds, he’s balled his hand into a fist, and then without a warning he pushes up, punching Flash straight in the groin. The teenager lets out a surprised shout, and then the pressure is gone from his chest and Peter can jump up again as Flash drops down, already putting his hands down in a protective gesture.
Peter’s eyes are a bit wet when Tony says that, but the hard stance in his jaw indicates that Peter is not trying to show his emotions about it. Then he nods and looks down.
change at all. He finds it pretty hilarious, despite the fact that this device could be able to help countless of people.
Peter turns back to the café, seeing the people inside laugh at some sort of joke somebody said. Even Natasha is smirking a bit, though she rarely laughs fully, even with the Avengers.
“Whoah, are we going to make out now?” he asked he with a little, cheeky twinkle in his eyes. The cashier looked a bit horrified at Wade and then back at Yaël, like he was trying to make clear he didn’t want to see an avocado making out with some chick right in front of him. The spit-detailed-horror was clearly readable on the poor teen’s face.
Peter nods, and they get to working. Wanda gets the drinks, Vision and Peter shift the couches around. They pull out the snacks, put Nat’s cake ready to take. There’s like a whole buffet there. When Peter asks FRIDAY to put up the music, playful notes start playing.
“You have anything in mind, Tony?” he asks. Tony opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. Quickly, he turns to Steve, who shakes his head fondly, smiling widely upon seeing his partner being so unprepared.
“Flash, I need your car and your phone,” he says. It hurts his throat a bit to talk like this, but he manages to give Flash a scared look on his face. That, of course, next to adoration. Everybody at the school knows Flash adores Spider-Man.
“I’m not sending these people to run into the dark and get killed by the cold!” Cap snarls back, his eyes flashing with anger. “There’s women and children out there! There are seniors at the back of the crowd! These people in the front start to retreat fast, the ones at the back get trampled and we can’t get them to medical, not in these conditions!”
He doesn’t even know which one is the Tesla. He doesn’t care. Steve will ride the Tesla, or the Audi, or whatever car in Tony’s ridiculous collection; He’ll take Tony out for coffee, he’ll listen to him ramble about his pop culture knowledge for hours, watch him gush over his armor and his bots in the workshop, respond to his jokes and challenge him and
is giving Steve the worst kind of feelings, a weird type of anxiety, far too close to a flashback for him to be comfortable with it. He can remember the way the cold can reach your bones, like it’s growing from the inside, freezing everything but your mind. The body, completely still, the mind, running mad with despair and grief. He wants to believe Bucky will be safe, he will be fine, but Steve can’t trust ice. He probably never will.
“He came to see Wanda, and he says he brought news.” Clint continues, half whispering into the comm’s mic, constantly looking over to the side over the projection.
So he asks Winter Soldier Bucky. Maybe this will provide some other ideas Steve could try to get back to Tony’s side.
The world needs the Avengers. But how can the Avengers be, if they can’t stand side by side when the world pushes back at them? If at the slightest pressure, they crumble, falling apart so completely they can’t fit themselves together again?
Some losses, like Scott’s and Clint’s and Wanda’s, friends who have parted ways in search for other ends – those losses don’t depend solely on him.
Nebula’s eyes gleam, hopeful, even when her expression doesn’t shift. “Yes. A door with a red bar on it.”
Tony will have to fix this. There is no alternative. There is nothing else that matters. It’s either fix it, or die trying.
Tony wants to question this, question himself; He can feel the inkling of insecurity swimming around the edges of his rational thoughts, shoved temporarily aside by the focus and the panic required to keep up with the situation at hand, but it’s not nearly strong enough for him to grasp properly and worry about it. It’s just… something in there, hidden deep. He feels like there’s something happening here, between him and Cap, and he can’t quite put his finger into it – it’s not familiarity, that’s not it, but it’s not… It’s not detachment.  Tony thought he would feel detached. And to be fair, for a second there, right when Cap
He can trust Ms. Carter. He knows he can. If there is anyone left that Jarvis is absolutely sure he can count on, especially with such a delicate subject, it would be Ms. Carter. He has done so before. The idea of parting ways with Tony hurts him on an almost visceral level, protectiveness so fierce it makes the idea seem wrong no matter how he looks at it, but he has
Tony is still blinking owlishly when Dum-E pinches his blood-stained shirt with amazing precision, more than he has ever displayed in all of his clumsy, twitchy years – and he wheels down in Nebula’s direction slowly, taking Tony with him with faltering steps, until they are close enough so Nebula can pull Tony and spin him around so he can sit on a sofa, his body moving mechanically through the motions.
“I’ll be fine.” Pepper assures him. “I’ll do what I can to get those R&D guys with the equipment they need, and we’ll ask FRIDAY for any help if we need to. I’ll help Agent Ross and Agent Carter on comms. I won’t go out there unless they call, and if they do, I’ll let you know.”
“So, how did you get this? I thought you preferred using the hammer.” Tony asks, while he goes around the table for a better viewpoint, and runs his eyes along the sharp edge of the blade, taking in the details and looking for any anomaly.
, for any form of assistance, and he’s surprised to find not Rhodey, but Nebula behind him, her fingers tight on his clavicle and her eyes as dark as the sky.
The sound of a key snapping open a lock makes them all turn their head at the same time in the direction of the door, which opens slowly and carefully with a soft groan of its hinges, only to reveal Wanda and

” Tony exclaims between tight lips, the words strangled between his teeth, fighting against Nebula’s hands.
He looks to the side, where he remembers seeing a clock – yep, there it is, and it says 6:11 AM on it, which is unholy and vile, an hour no one should be awake at, much less a Saturday, and
He takes a deep breath and hopes Sam can’t hear the way it sounds shaky, and Steve tries to disguise his trepidation by inspecting his own hands, his red, tender knuckles, that by now are no longer split open, but still hurt to the touch.
“Yeah, you did.” She concedes, but there’s no bitterness to it. “But I got my drink in the end, so it’s okay.”
“Is that why we’re trying to get in contact with Wakanda?” Natasha asks, sudden clarity shining in her eyes.
Bruce's personality is a breath of fresh air, amongst the Avengers. He is so nuanced and so... careful but unrepentantly straighforward at the same time that compared to the absolute mess that is our main duo, writing Bruce actually feels like giving my brain a rest. His origin story also puts a lot of things into perspective, a perspective Tony could surely benefit from. Not just that - Tony and Bruce hit off pretty well since the start, and this friendship, although not always presented in the right light in canon, is very clear cut and with a potential that AoU only ever brushed the surface of. I can't way to unveil it more.

She doesn’t answer. She keeps her back to him. She trembles. Tony doesn’t know if the tears actually fall down or no, but it doesn’t matter, because he brought those tears to her eyes anyway and that’s bad enough on its own. There’s… There’s nothing else he can say. What else could he say? That he’ll be okay? That he’ll come back? That he didn’t want this? That he
Since we're on the topic of children, I would like to raise a question for us to consider. There's a reason why I brought up Harley Keener. There is a reason why I believe Tony's determination to save Peter Parker is more important to assess his character than his relationship with Pepper. There's a reason why we're only talking about it now. And if I said Pepper is meant to showcase the duality of Tony's priorities and purpose, children - and whatever they might think of as children - also have a meaning of their own, the very foundation of this second big emotional discussion we truly can't escape if we want to get to the bottom of this.  Responsibility.
Tony taps his fingers against his thigh, jittery, scratching his lower lip with his teeth in a nervous tick – should he pull up the simulations of the alloys for the armor? It seemed to hold on pretty well, all things considered. Maybe some of the other alloys could hold on even better, if he went back to the standard model instead of nanotech. What about – can he make something directly with Badassium?
this tone. He knows what this is. This is pity, this is that sad sympathy Steve has heard all his life when he was small, like everyone who tried to protect him from the world by hiding him from it. He tells himself this is not Sam’s intention – and he knows that’s true, he knows, because Sam would never be so disrespectful as to treat him like a child who doesn’t know how to defend himself -, but the kindness, the gentleness, that note of sorrow and sadness in his voice; It’s impossible not to remember the
“What the hell do you want us to do?” Clint scoffs, a laugh that has absolutely no amusement in it, a heave of breath sneering and bitter exiting noisy and mocking from his nostrils. “How exactly was that our fault?
“Can I just—” Tony gulps, and licks his lips, and is glad she’s leaning against him again because this way she can’t see his face as the tears come down without any way to stop them, copious and furious, heavy and consuming, his heart hurting like it’s been dealt a physical blow, like it’s shriveling and dying inside his cold chest. “Can we just – lay down? For a bit? Just – Just – Right here, just a little—”
Steve raises an eyebrow at her, just because, ignoring the faint feeling of white noise fading away inside his head, deciding to focus more on the lighthearted banter between his friends. “You know I can hear you, right?”
Rhodey’s frown grows a little deeper, but when Tony offers him no other opening, he accepts it, and turns back to the front.
Natasha is there, as she said she would be. The really shouldn’t do this outside, but Steve has had enough with Natasha’s evasiveness and he won’t give her the chance to escape this conversation again. And he knows- he knows, somewhere deep down, that there’s a very real chance that they might actually
Tony’s eyebrows raise almost to his hairline, his face all scrunched in confusion. “And that was all it took?”
, I just think we can’t have the entire Sovereign on our asses right now! Wait a minute – Do we have enough fuel to get to the Sovereign?”
And in the other, when he blinks, tiny sparks of white burst behind his eyelids, and the entire world just tilts right in front of his eyes and he gasps when he feels his body swaying and leaning too much to the left, and he almost loses balance on the chair and falls down to the floor.
The problem with many of the MCU's unfinished business comes from this very negligence. It's easy to forget what consequences might've happened to all SHIELD agents who were suddenly exposed in CA:TWS, when all we can remember is a cool, self-assured speech that simply states that 'the world is safer now'. Hard to see the consequences of any sort of dangerous document that might pose a threat or not, when that document is forgotten in the next installment. Hard to gauge what is important, and what is not.
Tony gulps, and his hand unconsciously closes in on the soft cushion of the couch, his fingers digging uncomfortably into the seat. “Thanos was your father?”
Clint looks at them, one by one, taking in their reactions to his words. But none of them says a word. Natasha adverts her gaze and nods, her lips closed tight, as if she
“You started it!” Barton accuses Tony, childishly, but the force of his fury shows none of a child’s inoffensive tantrum. He’s all storm and rage, a man hardened by war. His voice is old, bitter venom. “Are you really gonna deny that?!”
“Where would we take them?” Cap asks, genuinely asks, not a hint of condescension or hostility in his voice – and Tony jumps a little, because he had almost forgotten he was also on the line, just listening to their chatter and, surprisingly, not saying a word.

” Tony plants his feet firmly on the ground, resistant and ashamed, shaking his head negatively. “No. I believe you. I believe you. It’s ok. I just – I have to make it back to the Compound.”
But the idea of it was tempting enough, so tempting, that he couldn’t quit. That’s all it takes, sometimes; Tony needs to see the big picture, he needs to see the future he so desperately wants, to feel it close but just outside his reach, so something in him ignites and bursts into flame, and pushes him forward. And that had been Pepper. For him, she had been it. The idea of finally reaching a point where they both met in the middle, where he finally reached the balance between his mission and his love, that was the goal Tony had always been trying to reach.
“Put me in comms.” He tells Cap, and with no preamble he flies, up, higher and higher, hoping to get a good look at the fence before he
He’s glad. In the end, he is gladder than anything else, because if the ten years sentence means that Scott won’t be going to the Raft, Steve will take that as the silver lining that it is. He’d expected to feel more anger. Hell, to be honest, Steve had imagined he would be
He’d really thought he’d be able to get through this, didn’t he? Stupid Tony. Stupid, naïve Tony. He really thought he could

that floods Tony’s insides is as primitive as the sound he makes when he exhales, something that’s so instinctive he can’t even try to stop it before it has already left his lips, low and afraid, anguished enough to alert her of his distress. He knows she is analyzing him. He knows that of all people who have ever seen the armor, Nebula is probably the one who could come close to figuring out how it works, simply because of what she
There’s a huge projection in the far back wall, a blue hologram that FRIDAY projects large enough that it bathes the entire room in its hue, electric and encompassing, brightness sharp and hypnotic before their eyes. It reflects against the light countertops and workstations, the clean, minimalistic design of the almost bare floors and walls, but barely gleaming against the dull metal of the mockup gauntlet that rests on the table; They watch it, transfixed, almost unblinking, as they gather before it like subjects before their deity – in fear and determination, in challenge of its threats, when an image of a familiar glowing cube presents itself right in the middle of the panel, almost like a mockery, the main star presenting itself for the show.
“I know you care about him, champ. But we’re… too much has happened, and I can’t stay with him and pretend everything’s fine, you know?” Peter blinks for a moment.
“Aunt May, come on, I’m not getting married!” Peter counters while trying to take a step back. He’s strong enough to force himself out of her hands, but he holds himself on. Her affection isn’t all that bad.
He just can’t wait until he doesn’t have to take them anymore. It would surely make his life a lot easier.
It’s when he jumps out of the shower that he takes a good look at his reflection. Much to his surprise, he finds his whole chest covered in bruises, as well as his legs. What the hell happened? Peter certainly didn’t go to sleep like this, that’s for sure!
Another coughing fit gets the better of him, and Peter groans in annoyance. He had been correct to think that almost drowning would leave him sick. One day after walking around with an extremely sour throat, Peter had caught a cold that kept him in bed for two more days. His nose had felt horrible while leaking all the time, and he couldn’t spend one minute without ending up coughing his lungs out. Even now, he’s still not feeling one hundred percent better, but he doesn’t want to postpone this.
“I’m afraid not, Hilde. Non-alcoholic only,” he explains. Brunnhilde gives him a shocked look, and Tony just chuckles.
“This spider is not going to sleep until she knows her nephew-spider is safe,” she says. “Go on to bed, we’ll bring you guys up to date tomorrow.” Barnes leans forward to kiss her on the cheek before he follows Clint and Sam to the door. They nod towards Scott and Hope.
The guilt goes on like that, and Peter has to lower the journal and take a deep breath. So, his mother slept with the guy he’s just had pleasant conversation with? That’s just… wrong. Did Mr. Stark even know about his father? Was he aware that Mary had been in a relationship?
“There’s a prisoner here. His name’s Adrian Toomes,” Tony starts. Steve knows who it is, even got in conversation with the man once or twice, though he has no idea why he’s been taken in. He doesn’t know it about anybody, afraid that he would get angry enough at any of them to start throwing punches. His goal is to get out
He’s surprised when he sees a mob of faded purple hair standing at his door. Yaël is there, looking with a frown, seeming a bit worried. She appears tired, and also hesitant, as if she’s not certain she should be here.
“Tony, don’t go in there,” Steve assures him. Tony ignores him, of course. He storms the two by, going through the door where he sees Bruce, Helen and a couple of other nurses surrounding Peter, who is jumping up and down on his bed, head lolling to the side, eyes looking up at the ceiling lifelessly. Helen is holding some sort of syringe in her hand, though not looking like she’s close to inject its content into Peter’s bloodstream.
Then Peter is swinging away. But he’s not going fast enough this way. So he drops down on the first car that he sees arriving at the school. There might be a bit of smugness when he sees it’s Flash. Remembering the Batman movies, Peter scrapes his throat, masking his voice.
Once injected with it, Harry turned into the Goblin. He took along the flight suit and the glider, and hurried off into the night in search for Peter, who was once more trying to fight off Electro. He had tried to keep Gwen away from it – she always knew how to find the danger – but she had come anyway. She saved his life.
“Dad, we got trouble! Liz’ dad is the Vulture-guy, and he threatened to kill me and everybody if I didn’t leave him alone, but he’s going after your plane loaded with all the Avengers-stuff that you were going to move so I have to stop him and-“
He reaches out a hand, searching for Tony’s and linking their fingers together the moment he finds it. In his mind, he tries to think back. Back to that moment where his heart decided that being friends with Tony wasn’t enough.
By the time he’s arrived at the Pizza-place, he quickly changes into his uniform and greets the boss, who only grunts at him in response. Deep inside, Peter knows he’s a good man. He just has trouble showing it, sometime.
Yaël needed to warm her water, so she cooled off. If she wanted to take a warm shower, she couldn’t enjoy it because her body temperature lowered itself. So, of course, Yaël got a cold. Working in gardens with a cooled-down body didn’t help her cold either.
“Eh, Peter Parker,” Peter answers without really paying attention. Then the printer behind the guy comes to life, and a piece of paper comes out of it. Lincoln fishes it out, writes something on the top of the paper, and then hands it to the teenager in front of him.
“Any change in another part in the body?” Tony asks. It’s a genuine question, one he’s been wondering ever since this morning when he walked towards the bathroom and accidentally broke the sink. When he looked into the mirror, he couldn’t help but notice the slight change in size of his muscles. They’re not as big as Steve’s, but they’re still lager than he can remember.
Technically it's the next day since it's past midnight. The fact that I'm posting this so soon, next to being crazy impatient, is the fact that I'm not at home the entire day and won't be able to post the chapter before rather late. So, better to have it sooner, I suppose!
Tony rubs his brow before shaking his head. His goatee has now turned into an almost full beard. His hair is longer, too. Peter wonders when was the last time Tony took a good, long shower. Not just a quick one to avoid looking at himself for too long.
“Thanks, Dad,” Peter says. Then, they can hear that it’s starting. The hosts are starting to talk, beginning the event. Tony lets out a sigh. Peter pulls away from the hug and heads back to where Ned, Harry and Johnny are standing. Tony watches them for a bit, glad that Peter has such good friends looking out for him.
“Well, you’ve learned some things about your father, I guess it’s time you get to know your mother a little bit better, I think,” she admits. Then she picks up her bag and takes her keys. “I’m going to the store, can you do the dishes while I’m gone?”
“Yeah, it’s still my legacy. But I want to graduate first, you know? See the world a little bit, get some experience. Maybe it’s something for when I hit thirty.”
“Can I see him?” Peter asks, knowing that he’s sounding extremely hopeful here. Steve gives him a long look before nodding.
“Why the fuck would she do that?!” Her crossed answer delivered her a slap in the face from her own little sister, which made the cat jump up and run off with a hiss.
“It’s just a dream, you can break it!” the man yelled at her. She almost didn’t hear him, with all the noise the rock made while smacking against the glass.
“Tony, you know that won’t happen,” Steve assures him. Tony shakes his head and makes a wave with his hands to shut him up.
“We’ll have to put him on the transplant list then as soon as it’s clear he’ll need one,” she says sadly. “I’ll come back later.”
But Liz moves away. Her mother found something – rather quickly – in Oregon. They have family there; it’s a temporary solution for now. Her father doesn’t want them in New York during the trial. Peter feels his chest ache at the idea that it’s also his fault he brought this family down.
Rhodey’s not here this evening, headed to some sort of convention with the army or whatever. Peter didn’t really catch much of it, but apparently Rhodey’s getting another medal or something like that. It’s a pretty big deal, he supposes. He hopes he’ll get to see the medal once Rhodey’s back home.
me to join the Avengers…? Just like that? Just like parents don’t let their kids do drama or football because they don’t agree with it?” Peter huffs out a breath, unable to look Steve
“Do you know what it feels like if your father chooses your sister over you? He abandoned me, while you were the one that should’ve been abandoned! You think they treated me well in that castle? Like their own daughter? They didn’t! I got trained, day in, day out, just to be a fit pawn!”
“Let’s just agree to be better friends to each other, huh?” she asks. Peter nods, holding out his hand towards her to shake, which she does. “Though I feel like we still need to talk about what happened afterwards…”
It’s then that Steve notices the weapon Thor is holding. It’s not the Stormbreaker, or… it is. But it’s not
Sleepwalking. Somnabulism, or noctabulism, are other terms for it. It’s a phenomenon of combined sleep and wakefulness and is classified as a sleeping disorder. That’s what comes into Peter’s mind while he lowers himself down on a balcony of whichever building he’s currently hanging from. He frowns, looking through the windows but only seeing his dark reflection in return. There’s no light anywhere near here.
“I, uh…” Tony is speechless. When did they get married? Is it after Mary fell pregnant with Peter? But, Tony really loved her back then… so, was their relationship doomed to fail like this anyway? Was there never any hope for them? Mary must have known that, somehow. She must have known they wouldn’t be happy.
“Hey, buddy, you’re with me?” he asks. Bruce holds up a hand to silence him, and Tony realizes with a bit of dread that the veins in his hands are looking a bit green. Bruce grunts out painfully, storming out of the room with Tony right behind him. He guides him to a secluded meeting room, where Bruce goes to press his head against the wall while he lets out a few painful screams.
