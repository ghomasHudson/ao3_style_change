Tony was straddling Steve’s thighs for the first time—they’d just worked their way up from making out to grinding on the couch. It was their third date. The first was at a little diner in Brooklyn, where Steve had convinced Tony to split a milkshake with him. The second was a trip to Turks and Caicos, which Steve had insisted was over-the-top, but he had still enjoyed the summer sun. And now, they’d just gotten back from an art gallery opening, where Steve had stared in awe at the art, and Tony had stared in awe at Steve.
Tony didn’t wait for him to find what he was looking for before grasping his shirt and pulling him back in, clashing their mouths together firmly and slipping some tongue against Steve’s bottom lip. He obligingly opened his lips, and Tony tasted him. It was the best thing he ever tasted.
He smiled so wide it felt like his face would split in two. “That’s Captain America!” He told his father excitedly, pointing. “He’s amazing, and he–”
Finally on their fourth day, Tony admits it’s time to move on. He’s been getting gradually less and less sleep with the bizarre taxidermy hanging above him at night.
“Steve,” he managed weakly, but there was no indication that Steve heard him. The next moment, the blood roaring in his ears was so loud, he couldn’t hear himself, and he came on Steve’s cock, his legs tightening around Steve’s core uselessly.
“Got you,” Tony promised, his voice low and husky. His hands dropped lower to palm at Steve’s ass through the gauzy material, making Steve groan aloud and relax into Tony’s hold.
Suddenly it made sense why Iron Man didn’t want to see Steve. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pressure you,” he apologized. “I just wanted to be sure you were alright. I didn’t see you after you went into the lab, and I was just worried.”
“No,” Steve denied, and Tony looked down to see what he meant. “Don’t keep yourself quiet. I want to hear you.”
[We should set up a safe room for Clint, so he can have some relief for the coming week.] Cap was planning which rooms in the tower would be far enough away from people to make such a plan feasible, rifling through the blueprints he kept in his head.
“Appreciate the backup!” Iron Man hollered, swinging the octopus around by a tentacle. “I think I just might have this one covered, though.”
Still. He’d wake up in the middle of the night, boxers sticky, with the mental image of Tony and Iron Man still hanging before his eyes. Tony would be crying out in pleasure, and the thick fingers of the gauntlet would be stroking across his bare chest, over his hip bone, ghosting over the bulge in the front of his pants. Steve, ever a passive observer even in his own dreams, would be breathing heavy in the corner. Maybe Tony would glance up and meet his eyes, grinning sharply, and angle his body so Steve had a better view. Maybe Iron Man would cup and the back of Tony’s head, holding him in place with more strength than even Steve had, and lean down to whisper dirty things in his ear.
“God, baby. How many of them caught you?” Steve shivered at the thought. “Natasha definitely knew. Now I know why she was looking particularly bored today.”
Steve trembled and shook as Tony pulled slowly out, until only the head of his cock caught on Steve’s rim, then thrust slowly back in, letting Steve feel the full length of him as it pushed relentlessly inside. He did it again, and again, never picking up the pace, a ruthless tease for them both.
“You’re so red,” Tony murmured, his eyes trained on where his finger penetrated Steve. “So needy. Huh, Steve? Aren’t you?”
Tony stared up at him for a moment before responding. “Just a mild one. I made JARVIS wake me up every couple hours, make sure I wasn’t going to die.” He startled, seemed to notice how close they were standing, and took a measured step back.
“you’ve been avoiding me,” Steve interrupted his self-pitying train of thought. “Did I do something?”
“Your wish, my command,” Iron Man agreed snarkily. Then, shifting his posture just slightly, he rammed his Iron cock directly into Tony’s prostate, not slowing down once.
They spend three days total in Roanoke. Not because either of them has an affinity for the place, but because it is so clearly the last stop before home, and though they’ve been gone almost a month, the thought of ending the trip seems unbearable. Finally, though, on day twenty-seven, Natasha calls them. Steve misses the call, and the message is vague, but they know she wouldn’t call if they weren’t needed back at Avengers HQ. The next morning, with a heavy heart, Tony watches Steve fill up the motorcycle and give her a final maintenance check.
Steve was breathless in awe, striding closer, into his space, his wings drawing up to mantle a little. He raised his hands and hovered over Tony’s shoulders, staring at him wondrously. “Tony, we’re pattern matches?”
As soon as she spoke, JARVIS audibly unlocked the doors around them. “My sincere apologies, Captain Rogers,” he intoned. “I am still only a program. I must do what my program states.”
Steve caught Tony before he listed into the wall. “Let me help you to your room before I check on Iron Man.”
Steve shook his head, but he realized he’d been on the cusp of hyperventilating. He shut his eyes and tried to slow his breathing, focusing on Tony’s soothing strokes on his shoulder blades.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. Tony pulled the wet silk up and away from Steve’s hole, exposing it to the air. The silk bunched next to it, out of the way, but his half-softened cock was still covered in the panties and in his own cooling come.
Steve thinks he might cry when Tony doesn't move, just sits there, head thrown back, back curved, hands holding himself up on Steve's chest, just barely, barely moving his hips in a small grinding motion
Steve finds him in the corner of his workshop, leaning against the leg of the most recent Iron Man armor. The suit is powered up in sentry mode, and its imposing figure standing tall over Tony’s hunched frame paints a very dark picture.
The fingers and joints of this suit were more articulated, and it was nearly impossible for them to pinch skin or hair. Each knuckle and wrist moved in the same range of motion as a human, which allowed for a more realistic-feeling touch during foreplay. The classic Iron Man helmet had been based on one of the older designs—Tony figured Steve would appreciate something a little more retro. The eyes glowed arc-reactor blue when he turned it on.
“Mmm!” Steve managed, and he wasn’t sure if he could have given a real answer just then, but Tony knew what to do anyway. In a split second, the vibrator was lifted away from his balls and touched the vibrant head of his cock, and Steve’s eyes widened, and then he was coming in thick ropes so hard he couldn’t see.
Tony fell into his own orgasm moments later, groaning his release as he bit on Steve’s shoulder. Steve could feel his knot start to swell, and despite still enjoying his own peak, his Omega instincts were just starting to get excited.
Steve knew this was a bad idea, especially because Tony’s skin was already heated and slick. Too close, too close to something else.
“No, Tony,” Steve insisted, running his palms up and down Tony’s arms in an attempt to warm him. “I’m not doomed. I’m safe. We’re both safe.”
Slowly, as if testing the waters, he massaged the divot of Tony’s hips with his thumbs over the panties. Then he slid his hands down Tony’s thighs, skating up and down, moving closer to the bulge at the front of his crotch with every pass. Finally, his fingertips brushed against the shaft of Tony’s cock, making him rock forward into the touch.
“God, baby. How many of them caught you? Natasha definitely knew. Now I know why she was looking particularly bored today.” Steve tried to pull off again to respond, but Tony held him in place. “Clint knows what Natasha knows. Thor is the god of fertility. He has a sixth sense for when people are horny. and Bruce would take one look at your ears turning such a pretty red and instantly know what you were thinking.” He brushed his fingertips across said ears, which were indeed bright red.
Then, with one slow, even thrust, the armor pushed into him. The metal cock was big, and it gave no quarter. Tony couldn’t squeeze around it the same way he could Steve’s cock, it was too hard. It felt cool and alien inside him. It pushed up, up, deeper into him, until he felt like he couldn’t breathe.
Steve usually couldn’t make it to the end of the dream, exploding in his boxers before he even touched either of them.
When Tony’s shirt hung open across his front, the arc reactor visible, Iron Man dragged one cool, metal hand down from his collar bone to his hip. “You look good,” the modulated voice complimented. “Doesn’t he look good, Captain?”
Tony stood staring after him for long moments, wondering if he wanted to believe in soulmates after all.
As he carries the drunk genius away, JARVIS quietly powers the armor down. Someone else is watching over Tony tonight.
“Did you finish?” He asked, dropping his book. Just as Tony had predicted, two little glowing pink spots appeared on his cheeks. His eyes tracked to the Iron Dildo at the front of the suit, then danced away, like it was too much to take in at once.
“You normally don’t let me take my time with these,” Tony mused. “You are always rushing me. So desperate, baby, and it’s a good thing,” he said, reaching up to catch Steve’s chin before he could turn his face into the pillow. “I love it. But sometimes…” he considered the state of Steve’s flushed chest and carefully not-too-tight grip, “Sometimes, it’s nice to slow things down a little.”
They parted, both breathing hard. Steve’s hands had made their way around Tony’s waist, careful not to pull on the bandages. Tony’s hands were buried in his hair, stroking and catching in a way that made shivers run down his spine. Their lips were wet.
“Hormone levels are elevated, sir,” JARVIS allowed. “I’m afraid my systems are not sophisticated enough to confirm anything else.”
“Cap,” Iron Man called. “S’fine. He’s probably already on his way back to the tower. he’ll meet us there.”
He didn’t take the time to realize that his soulmate was gone, dead or lost in the ocean. He didn’t ruminate over the many years that had passed since Steve Rogers had been declared MIA, nor did he consider how impossible it would be to meet him. He was only five, after all. Those problems were for another age. He just stared at the screen, and smiled back.
Cap whirled and pinned Tony to the cold tile by his hips, grinding into him like he couldn’t bear to keep away. He was rock solid in his uniform—how had Tony missed that?—and he was looking down through blown, lidded eyes.
Tony stifled a laugh, and Steve glared. “Sorry, not laughing at you,” he reassured, and petted at Steve’s hip. “Just surprised. You fantasized about
“I’d tell you you might be able to have half a cup a day if I didn’t know you’d abuse that. No, no coffee at all for you.”
The hands on his thighs shifted periodically to check his bonds and make sure he wasn’t rubbing himself raw. His cock was never touched, not even when Tony lifted him up onto his knees briefly to look and confirm this wasn’t hurting him. Nothing hurt, except the pounding of ninety percent of his blood in his groin, and the orgasm he’d been wishing to have since they started this cruel game.
“Would you like that?” Tony asked, and even though he must have been close to coming, he still sounded so in control. “Knowing that everyone can see you? That they would know this is where you belong?”
“Sure,” Steve shrugged, like it was no big deal. “You think my down looks this color naturally? No, I started dyeing it when I went on tour, back with the USO. It made the most sense for Cap to have red white and blue wings, not red, white and gold.”
Steve had first met Tony on the helicarrier, when he was studying the cube. Their first meeting was…rocky, to say the least. But since the effects of Loki’s scepter were long gone, they’d been cordial and even friendly towards one another. Mr. Stark was a genius, and he naturally had a very busy schedule running his company, as well as fabricating the Avengers gear and doing maintenance for Iron Man. But, even with all that, he made a point to check in with each of them once a week or so, and make sure all their needs were met. He went out of his way to be kind, and that was a trait Steve admired more than anything else.
Steve leads them to the water’s edge in a public park, one with piers and beachgoers even at this early day in the year. There is a carousel not far from shore, as well as an ice cream stand already open for business. Children splash in the shallows, shrieking as the waves crest a little too high and soak their clothes with cold water.
“Got two with laser weapons of some kind, and one in a flying mechanized octopus?” Tony panted in his ear. “It’s the stupidest looking villain I’ve been up against in a while.”
They make it to Toledo as the night truly set in. The motel Steve had booked was clean and mostly empty, at least, and Tony finds that, though he hadn’t spoken or done much all day, he is exhausted. Without a second thought he falls asleep on the lumpy bed.
Tony stilled. It wouldn’t have been so worrying if Tony wasn’t always moving, but being frozen like that was a clear red flag.
“It’s the big convention for AI and innovative technology. I’m going ahead of my team, making some connections. Schmoozing. It’s hard work, drinking other people’s booze, but hey, somebody’s gotta do it.”
[No one is listening but the Captain,] Coulson asserted from the front. [I suppose it’s too much to ask for on a Monday afternoon.]
“No, no! Not making fun of you,” Tony corrected, and the hand on Steve’s shoulder slipped to curve around his neck. “You see, I'm pretty gone on you too.”
Steve smiled sunnily and set the coffee mug and plate down on a side table, away from Tony’s work space. His wings folded sleekly against his back, unlike Tony’s prosthetics, which didn’t fold as nicely when he wasn’t flying.
Sacramento lights up the horizon at sunset, and though the skyline is not as impressive as the one at home, they admire it all the same.
Steve was already up in the penthouse, reading while curled up on the sofa. Tony strolled in with the Iron Lover stomping after him, and Steve looked up right away, his face open and hopeful.
After a few days, Steve stops coming. Half his mind breathes a sigh of relief, while the other half wants to scream in frustration.
“Saint Joseph, Michigan,” Steve explains, pulling off his helmet to reveal sweaty, tousled hair. “You know, my ma always liked Saint Joseph. Jesus’ pa, you know? And, well. I suppose her pa wasn’t around, and with my pa gone…” he sighs. “We coulda done with a father figure, I suppose.”
Tony pounded into him ruthlessly. Steve was going to feel this tomorrow, healing factor or no. He loved when Tony was rough with him, loved the idea of being used for Tony’s pleasure. Again and again, until he was wrung out and so spacey from being knotted that he couldn’t think.
They always seemed to miss each other around the team, and neither one of them hung around much. When they were together, like for an event where Tony needed visible security, Steve usually only witnessed it from afar, or through a television screen. Still, those few times he’d been with both of them at an event, or a press conference, he remembered how Iron Man had seemed…off.
“Mmh hmmh,” Steve agreed, trying not to visibly shake with anticipation. Tony was going to fuck him. Tony was going to fuck him in panties, going to pull them aside and slip right in, like a filthy secret, like a promise. Tony was going to–
Steve kept pumping, speeding up and tightening his grip until Tony was whining high in the back of his throat. He came, spurting warm all over Steve’s hand and stomach.
“Sure,” Steve shrugged, like it was no big deal. “You think my down looks this color naturally? No, I started dyeing it when I went on tour, back with the USO. It made the most sense for Cap to have red white and blue wings, not red, white and gold.”
Steve opened his mouth to say that Tony made a pretty swell picture himself, but what came out was a startled yell, for Tony chose that exact moment to twist his nipples sharply. The zing of pleasure-pain shot down his spine. Tony petted his thumbs softly over the buds, soothing the hurt, before pinching again, making Steve buck under him.
Thanks for sticking with me even though I didn't finish all 31 days. My commenters and kudos-givers are amazing!
After a few more moments, Steve gave one last herculean thrust, then buried himself to the hilt inside Tony’s now abused hole. He groaned, clutching Tony impossibly closer as he spent himself. Tony found the energy to moan in appreciation.
Steve pulled off, only to nuzzle into his groin, smelling Tony’s musk there. “Tony,” he intoned. “I need it. I need you. Let me take what I need.”
Tony blew cool air across the wet skin, and that did make Steve arch a little away from him, but it also made his cock thrust up a little in envy. To have Tony’s mouth so close…
“Mad at you?” Steve pulled back and met Tony’s eyes, and at once he saw the moisture gathered there. “Tony, I’m ecstatic.”
He felt stuck in the loop of pleasure for a while after that, his body clenching with aftershocks. The vibrator had left an echo on his skin, and everywhere it had touched felt like it might still be buzzing. The cuffs and spreader held him in place, keeping him where Tony wanted him even after his strength was gone. His thighs and balls were wet with lube, and Tony was jerking off fiercely over him, ready to add his own seed to the mess.
He grabs the complimentary bathrobe from the hook on the wall and stumbles down the hall until he finds stairs to the main floor. There, a continental breakfast with coffee is being served. He fills and empties three cups before Steve returns.
Tony hadn’t programmed an answer for that question, so he listened as the program sorted through its possible answers. “He feels, good, Captain,” it pieced together, from a few different clips.
Steve was whining in tempo, and Tony was so close. The slightest thing would push him over the edge.
“Yes, big guy, I love this.” Tony gasped as the fingers thrust again, a little harder. “Yes, more of that.”
“I would have these dreams,” Steve murmured, barely above a whisper. “They weren’t conscious, I swear. I’d never—never.”
“And I’m using it in the best possible way, gorgeous,” Tony promised him. “Now. Let me get a look at you.”
He got to work sucking softly, so softly, at the head. Steve hadn’t had the chance to get hard yet, what with Tony jumping him in the hallway, but now he was firming up quickly, making aborted thrusts under Tony’s hands. Tony curled his arm harder against his hips and bobbed his head, taking in another inch at a time.
The suit turned its helmet to look at Steve, glowing eyes tracking his movements. Iron Man nodded, and Steve squirmed under his scrutiny, his face and neck turning bright red. “Tony,” he whined, his palm moving in the same rhythm as Tony’s slow, mindless thrusts against the armor.
Steve only growled something unintelligible against the skin of Tony’s neck, then bit there hard enough to leave teeth imprints. On hand gripped Tony’s still-raised wrists, and the other held firm at his hip, holding him steady as he fucked him hard. He smashed his lips against Tony’s once more, a parody of kiss, both of them too far gone to orchestrate a real one.
Tony nods desperately, doing his level best to arch into the grinding thrusts Steve is giving. When they slow and stop, he groans out a protest.
Steve froze, head down in his pillow, feeling Tony’s eyes skate over his back and ass almost like a real touch. Tony was possessive on a good day, but this–getting to dress Steve up, view him almost like a voyeur to Steve’s own sexual awakening–this felt more intimate than many other things they’d done. Steve tried not to shift as Tony palmed his ass experimentally. He could feel the gossamer fabric shift across his sensitive skin, barely there at all. The heat of Tony’s body radiated through the panties like they weren’t there. His dick twitched, and he wondered how it would feel to have Tony’s hand touch his cock through them.
The questing finger came back slick with lube, coating Tony’s hole and giving tiny pushes in. It didn’t breach him, not yet, but Tony couldn’t hold back a groan of relief.
Tony doesn't say anything, just rests his head against Steve's shoulder and presses opened mouthed kisses against his jaw and against the rapid pulse of Steve's heartbeat in this throat
When he met Steve Rogers, Tony eyed his red, white, and blue wings suspiciously. Their pattern was similar—Tony’s red was maybe a little darker, but it fell in the same places on their wings, down to the white tips. The major difference was Rogers’ deep blue down, covering the underside of his wings. It was so pure and solid, Tony loathed to compare his now patchy gold. He shook his head.
“Tony,” he growled, breathing in deeply. Tony followed his actions, wrapping Steve up in a hug and breathing in the smell of burning rubber and battle.
That was where he made himself stop. With both of them happy together. Just the contrast of Mr. Stark’s lithe form and the bulk of the armor was enough to make him shiver. He didn’t need more than that.
,” Tony said, eyes blank. “Yinsen died, and Coulson died. Pepper almost died. Obie tried to kill me. And I know, I
The morning of day twenty-one, Tony shuffles into the communal kitchen to find Steve sitting at the breakfast bar. He looks tired, maybe, but it’s not like Tony can talk—he’s been getting only a few hours a night himself. Nightmares, yes. But every time he wakes in the middle of the night, his bed feels so empty and cold that he can hardly stand it.
Tony writhes under Steve, trapped between the mattress at his back and the undulating of Steve’s hips. Their bare cocks slide together, the most glorious tease, as the rhythm never falters and Tony whines high in his throat. Steve jumped him almost without warning, getting them both naked with military efficiency. But even though they’ve only just started, Tony feels the sweat at the small of his back and matting his hair to his forehead.
Tony was so charismatic and funny, and he took Steve’s introduction to present-day New York pretty seriously. They spent time at arcades and record stores, so Steve could get a taste of some of the things he’d missed. Tony would drag him from store to store, shoving clothing at him to try, until he found more modern styles that he liked. They went to concerts, conventions, museums, art galleries, and once, memorably, the circus. They giggled at how dumb they looked in the gossip rags the next day, sharing a bag of cotton candy and wearing balloon animal hats.
Then, as if the armor had been waiting for Tony to adjust, it pulled out slowly before grinding all the way back in. The cold wasn’t as shocking this time as the metal warmed. In and out, like a pendulum, slow and even. Tony was going to lose his mind, he just knew it.
Steve may have moaned or sobbed, he wasn't sure, but he knew that he couldn't come like this, and he wanted to come so badly, but Tony was in complete control and he didn't want to do anything to make Tony stop, to make Tony go back to the miniscule grinding motions from before
With that announcement, Tony fell on him again, his hands suddenly everywhere and his mouth leaving wet, sucking kisses across Steve’s abdomen. Steve couldn’t help but buck under the sudden attention, his heart beating faster and his breath coming shorter.
The next moment, he doesn’t really care anymore, because Steve is bracing himself on Tony’s chest with one hand, and reaching behind himself with the other. He doesn’t flinch as he slides what must be two fingers in to the hilt, bearing down and sighing. It’s the hottest thing Tony has ever seen.
typed in bold font, both on the sign and on the paving in front of the spot. Steve rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed. “When I asked if I could pay for long-term parking here, they insisted.”
He could hardly hear Tony anymore, only the sound of his soothing voice. Tony adjusted the vibe a few times, and the shock of having it on new skin was fresh every time, to the point that Steve was sure he would come, but he didn’t. The pleasure just kept ratcheting higher.
“Why is the fridge full of popsicles?” Clint complained one afternoon. “There’s no room for my gallon of mint chocolate chip.”
Tony cooed and praised him, urging him back down into the restraints. He rocked Steve’s hips forward again, and Steve groaned to feel the silk under him once more. It was never going to be enough. He would be stuck here forever, at Tony’s mercy, on the edge for eternity.
But then he couldn’t say anything else, because Tony Stark was licking into his mouth. He tasted like artificial cherry. It was the best kiss Steve had ever had.
The words send Tony’s mind reeling. “What? No. You—you don’t want that. And it’s fine, I get it, I would be disappointed in me, too. No pressure. But, ah. I think it’s best if I take some time off. Not because of—of you, or anything, I just. Need some time.”
Tony slowly pulled his hand away, dropping a kiss to the front of Steve’s panties, right over his leaking head. “Ready for me, baby?”
Iron Man scissored his fingers and thrust again, brushing against Tony’s prostate but not hitting it fully. He thanked his past self for thinking of that, because if those fingers had been right on target, he would have gone off immediately. As it was, he squirmed in the armor’s hold, whining when it still only barely grazed his sweet spot.
Tony joined him in the center of the bed, getting up on his knees to link his arms around Steve’s neck. His own panties were the only thing he wore, and though Steve loved his garter belt ensemble, he was glad to not be outclassed tonight. Tony’s pair was a simple black, seamless, cut low in the back and criss-crossed with ribbon, like a corset.
All they’d done was kiss, and Steve felt so enchanted already. He felt somehow more naked in the panties than he would have without them, feeling like Tony’s hands were pressing more intimately than ever. Maybe it was true, or maybe it was only his imagination, but it didn’t matter. The next moment, Tony had flipped them so Steve was on his stomach, Tony hovering above him, their legs tangled together.
Steve backed off after that. He knew about protecting people close to you, and how it felt when you failed.
Tony only smirked as much as he could around his mouthful and starting fucking his face onto Steve’s dick. He pushed hard, going until he felt lightheaded and Steve was gripping the back of his head with both fists. He was letting out little grunts and moans every time the head of his cock passed through the back of Tony’s throat. This was the part Tony loved, when Steve was on the edge.
Steve kept this up until Tony was wracked with shakes, trying desperately to get away from the feeling of too-much-too-hot-friction. He slipped in a second finger to his hole, pressing until it stretched wide around the two digits and he could unerringly stroke against Tony’s prostate. Bizarrely, almost as if from a dream state, Tony realized he was beginning to get hard again. He wailed in pain, for it really was too soon, but Steve hummed euphorically and began sucking harder, coaxing Tony back to full hardness in record time. His fingers pumped inside, scissoring and stroking Tony’s prostate.
Steve seemed taken aback for a moment. “Do folks really ask you all that invasive stuff? I was just going to say, your wings look a lot like mine used to.”
“Greedy,” Tony teased again, but his eyes were still affectionate. “Let me do my work, Rogers. We’ll get to your favorite part eventually.”
This ficlet was inspired by an anon who asked Sabrecmc on tumblr if there were any good Steve-Riding-Tony fics. I couldn’t not do it.
But, he grabbed the towel from the side table and wiped Steve’s sweat away. He got up and put out the candle, then came back with a wet cloth, and cleaned his saliva from Steve’s chest. Lastly, he pulled aside the ruined panties, and patted clean Steve’s utterly spent cock.
[But really,] Bruce continued. [What a therapist wouldn’t give to get their hands on Tony’s neuroses.] Clint secretly agreed.
Steve's ready to lose his mind because here's Tony, dressed up in soft silk, pretty as anything, but still taking what he wants from Steve, and that's hotter than the rest of it, that Tony can master him this way, so completely
Tony strips out of the ruined nightie. He offers Steve some juice, then takes some himself, before arranging Steve to his liking and curling around him on the bed. He keeps his hands stroking along Steve's sides, calming and soothing.
They settled in to a pretty nice rhythm through the afternoon, with Stark jabbering to his personal skynet for five minutes or so, thunking around in the range computer’s hardware, then asking Clint to give it a whirl. Clint would graciously shoot the hell out of some fake rabbits, throw out some feedback, then sit back and watch as Stark repeated the process. It was entertaining to say the least—-JARVIS might have been creepy as fuck, but he also shared Stark’s dry humor and wit, so the banter was superb.
Tony’s weight left the bed, but Steve could still see him as he crossed the room to their toy chest. He held quiet and still until Tony returned with a set of leather cuffs and a matching spreader bar. He fixed them efficiently and comfortably in place, testing the cuffs to make sure they weren’t too tight. Finally, when he was satisfied, he sat back on his heels between Steve’s legs, so his knees were next to the spreader bar where it held Steve open.
“So--so hot, Jesus, Steve. You’re so sweet for me. Look at your mess, you let me do this to you--ah!” And with that, his own orgasm hit him, and he collapsed over top of Steve.
[I’d love to know his favorite foods. Christ knows I couldn’t make them for him, I’d burn the tower down and Pepper would look disappointed. But. I could order them for him.]
Still, despite his cynicism, Steve kept up a healthy positivity in his daily life. He knew the good was worth fighting for. He saw the best of good every day, and he wanted to keep seeing it. That alone was worth the fighting they did.
“Need you,” Captain America panted, and Tony realized slower than he should have that this wasn’t an Iron Man-and-Cap interaction, this was a Steve-and-Tony interaction. Those were way more fun.
Steve only stared back, his eyes probably blown dark, and watched Tony’s head dip to suck one ball fully into his mouth. Steve gasped.
“Let’s go booby trap the bathrooms,” She suggested, and suddenly the anniversary party got a lot more entertaining.
Steve plunged into him in one deep thrust, urging Tony’s legs around his middle. Tony screamed his pleasure, hearing it echo across the room. His vision whited out just slightly around the edges, and though he’d come only minutes ago, he felt like he’d narrowly avoided coming again.
“I’m gonna reprogram one of the suits,” Tony mumbled into his shoulder. Steve thought he might be talking shop for a moment, but then Tony continued. “Gonna find a way to get it to hold me down. Put on a show for you, like you said.”
Tony finally looks down at Steve, his face flushed and his pupils blown wide, and squeezes Steve's wrists in warning
“Let me,” Steve asked, moving a hand down to grasp at Tony’s cock and pump it firmly. Tony groaned, thrusting into the curl of Steve’s hand like it was the best thing he’d ever felt.
Then he would go back to reading the paper, blessedly (truthfully) pants-less in their living room, while Tony fiddled with some gadget or other across from him. The evening would draw on comfortably long, like an old movie you know the lines to. Tony would stretch and get up, and Steve would follow him, and they would curl around one another in bed, and Tony couldn’t help thinking that
One more pass, a glancing blow more than a grip, and Steve was pumping thick white strings of come onto his stomach and chest. He whited out.
They spend the day indoors, occasionally raiding the tea cupboard but otherwise enjoying the sight of rain drenching the beach and one another’s company. By this, Tony means they fuck on every available surface when they get bored. The whole apartment stinks of sex by the time they’re finished.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony called, waltzing into the locker room as Steve was wrapping his hands. “What’s shaking?”
Tony barely waits for Steve to finish saying the words before he pushes up on his tiptoes and presses his chapped lips to Steve’s. He takes him by surprise, but Steve melts into the kiss easily. It stays chaste, warm and sweet, until Steve draws back to lean his forehead against Tony’s. If his smile before had been like the sun, this one is a supernova.
“My father hired him, but I made sure he wasn’t into anything unsavory when I took over. Or at least I thought I had.”
They made it to Savannah on the evening of Day twenty-three. Tony sees the end of their national road trip in sight, so he convinces Steve to stay an extra day and make the trek out to Hilton Head. It’s a lovely island, and Savannah’s historic architecture makes Steve nostalgic, so he agrees. They have drinks on the beach, using the time off the road just to talk and tell stories. It’s one of Tony’s favorite stops.
“Remember, you can’t come yet,” Tony offered. “Why don’t you take it easy? We’re not even to the main event yet.” He heard Steve’s sigh and saw him reluctantly drag his hand away from his cock.
“Oh!” He cried as Iron man bottomed out. He was just as thick as Steve, but longer, and because his cock was so cold, Tony could feel it all the way into him. His tissues shuddered and clamped down around it against his will, his body fighting a losing war against the intrusion.
With his knot still deflating, not entirely able to pull out from Steve’s vise-like hole, Tony thrust experimentally. “You want me to fuck you again?”
Steve gasped as Tony thrust again. “No, that’s not quite right,” Tony said, nipping at Steve’s earlobe as he stroked his cock in time with his thrusts. “You want me to
By nightfall they make it to North Bend, Washington, on the outskirts of Seattle. The light pollution is noticeable here, especially after so many nights in Montana, but the rich forests of the west coast are only just at their backs. Nine days since their journey started, and the Pacific Ocean is so close, Tony can smell it on the air. He falls asleep dreaming of salt water and sand.
Steve looked confused again. “Oh, you were. We talked about kids, you remember? I mean, you had had a bit of Thor’s mead, but not that much, you should remember—”
“I thought we’d be covering more ground than this,” Tony grouses at dinner—yet another local place that Steve had intuitively discovered.
Fortunately, the next day’s traffic was much less. It was noticeably more populous than some of their previous stretches of road, however, with more towns and cities the further east and south they went.
This hotel has a bar, but Tony stays well away, opting to take a dip in the jacuzzi instead. This choice has the intentional side effect of making Steve gaze at him proudly for continuing to overcome his addiction, but also the unforeseen side effect of Steve joining him in the jacuzzi, mostly naked.
Clint wanted to call out and tell Stark to just ask him, but he had resolved that his best recourse was to ignore anything he heard while under the effects of the magic, and then pretend it never happened afterwards.
“Good,” Steve managed, internally praying that Tony would brush his hands a little higher, just over the head of Steve’s cock. It felt so neglected where slapped against his belly.
Tony shrugs. “Some bullshit about our lives not being worth less than civilian lives. He’s blowing smoke! He wants to limit me, limit my abilities! He keeps calling me reckless, foolish, bull-headed–”
“I’m on my way,” Steve assured, rushing to the garage. He ran past the empty spot where Tony’s car had been parked to his motorbike, gassed and ready to go. He straddled it and flew out into the street, dodging traffic like a stunt driver.
“I’d love to see you come like this, beloved,” Tony hummed, and if Steve had been any more coherent, he would have roared in rage. As it was, he moaned and nodded, ready to beg if he had to. “But it doesn’t look like it will be enough to get you there. A shame,” Tony sighed, put upon. “You’re so sensitive, this must be so difficult for you.”
Tony kept up a stream of constant praise and affection, checking Steve’s skin to make sure the lube was still tacky. Then he pressed something cool and soft to Steve’s sac, something that he couldn’t see.
Just as he was opening his mouth to ask Tony for something, for anything to anchor him, he felt his fingertips pressing on his bottom lip like a benediction, like a savior. He sucked them in gratefully, laving his tongue against the pads, and instantly he felt calmed. He distantly heard Tony’s voice saying, “Yes, shh, there you go. My darling, you’re doing so well. I know it’s a lot, and you’re taking it so amazingly.”
Steve takes breath after shaky breath, focusing on the smell of Tony, Tony all around him, Tony's hands in his hair. He slowly comes away from that terrible/amazing overwhelmed place and sinks into Tony's touch.
The silk of Tony’s thousand-thread-count sheets was so slick, it almost felt like a breath of air on his cock. It was torture, pure and exquisite, to have the bias of the fabric running parallel to his body, the friction nearly a daydream it was so light. The room was cool, but Steve’s body heat ratcheted higher and higher as he thrust helplessly against the bed, trying to get even the slightest bit more friction on his weeping cock. The silk had long since been soaked with his precome, and that made it better and worse at the same time. Now it was sticky, clinging to his skin every so often, and it still wasn’t enough. He wished he could grind down properly, put his body weight behind his movements, but he was as trapped as a fly in honey.
Steve didn’t have to ask before what. Fury had briefed all the Avengers on Afghanistan. “You plucked, in the cave.”
“Steve,” he whined, shuddering as the man continued to lick at his softened, overstimulated cock. “Steve, baby, too much.”
Generally, a mostly naked Steve is a welcome addition to Tony’s day, but he finds that in this instance, the married women watching over their kids at the pool are tittering and staring too much for his comfort. So before too long he hauls them up to their room and lets Steve fuck him against the heavy suite door.
The worst thing that happened that weekend, though, was magic. Of fucking course it was. Wasn’t it always? And it had to be
no. It just means now I get to spend even more time in the lab, thinking of you. And making ridiculous high tech sex toys.” He shifted until they could look into each other’s eyes. “Would you like that?”
Before he could catch his breath, Tony’s wide tongue was lapping at the silk and surrounding skin. It was warm, but not wet right away, at least not until the saliva soaked through the panties.
“Yes, please do that,” Tony agreed. He felt as his hands were shifted so the armor could hold them both with one gauntlet, then watched with rapt attention as the other one fell to the waistband of his jeans. It was just a tease, Tony knew, he’d programmed the damn thing, but he couldn’t help arching his hips forward into the metal hand, begging with his body. Iron Man was unmoved, though, and instead reached up to unbutton his shirt delicately.
“I’m right as rain, worrywart,” Tony assured fondly, but his balance was uneven. “I gave myself a transfusion. Didn’t even need DUM-E’s help. I just need a little rest and I’ll be back to normal.”
“Tony,” Steve finally cut him off, once they had eaten. “I wanted to...let you know, I guess. That I’ve figured it out.”
“I’ll go anywhere as long as it’s with you,” Tony simpered, but they both knew he meant it. They made out on the beach without a care for who was watching after that.
“It’s the elevation,” a tour guide warns them. “There’s literally less oxygen up here for you to breathe. I’m surprised your friend there isn’t suffering from elevation sickness as well.”
“The formula they use for the Cap ones is unique, don’t you see?” Tony shook his head. “I’ll never taste this sweet perfection again.”
,” Tony defends, swatting at his lover’s shoulder as he chuckles. “And they were staring at you. The kids were right there, Steve, and they’re still staring.”
He got out his bergamot and lemon-scented candle and lit it, setting it in the middle of the table by the window, where they’d be unlikely to knock it over. He then rounded up Tony’s favorite lotion, a towel, and a bottle of lube. The smells filled the room as he worked, and his body gave a Pavlovian response to the familiar scent. By the time they both stood by the bed, Steve was fully hard in his panties.
“It’s fine. I’ll just—remove myself from the equation for a little bit. Until everything settles, you know. I’ll be able to handle it—not that I haven’t been, I’ve been fine. I mean, you’re fine, so I’m fine, I just—”
Steve pulled back and looked chagrined. “I’m sorry I implied this wasn’t incredible news. I just heard you say you were expecting our baby, and my Alpha instincts kicked into high gear. I had to be sure you were safe, and that everything was alright. Everything is alright, right? The baby is okay?”
“Yes, yes, I’ll help you. Shh,” he promised, pulling Steve’s boxers down and away. His tongue traced the fine hairs that ran from Steve’s navel to the base of his cock, and Steve realized he was holding his breath in an effort not to cry out.
Steve seemed taken aback for a moment. “Do folks really ask you all that invasive stuff? I was just going to say, your wings look a lot like mine used to.”
“I would dream. About you, and, and Iron Man. You’d be kissing, shirtless, and he would be in the armor with the helmet off. I didn’t know what his face looked like, it changed. But he would be touching you. With the gauntlet. And, you’d look over, and see I was watching, and smile like you were putting on a show for me. You’d let him hold you down, let me watch, and—I always woke up before it got much farther.”
“I mean it.” Steve draws back and urges Tony to turn until he can look into his dark eyes. The glow from the reactor lights them up just enough that Steve can see the vestiges of fear being swept from his lovers face. “I count myself the luckiest man alive to have you.”
“Huh,” Tony let out, surprised. “Really? You had a crush on the mad genius benefactor, and the faceless robot dude? You got weird taste.”
Steve takes a moment to reflect on all the things that brought him here. He wonders when it became normal for his greatest problems in life to be nightmares. Not even his own nightmares—though, there are plenty of those, too.
The gauntlet at his neck slid down to his chest, thumb swiping over one brown nipple. “Stay,” Iron Man commanded, and then the other one slid down, too, caressing his other nipple in tandem. Tony moaned, bucking at the cool touch, letting delicious goosebumps gather over the surface of his skin. He kept his arms above his head. “Good,” the armor praised, tweaking a nipple in reward.
Steve nodded his head, staring blindly up at the ceiling, unable to take in more stimuli. The fullness in his ass was all-consuming. It was all he could think about. This was the thing he craved. He was going to start crying.
So when the Captain America-themed popsicles became available in stores, no one expected Tony to be the one that stocked up.
“Well,” Rhodey cut him off, “I’ll say one thing about this Captain Rogers. I’m sure as hell glad he’s the one out there fighting with you. You know, I’ve said a lot of the same things about stunts you pull.”
Tony, lost in a wave of sensation, unable to move away from or into Steve’s mouth, was suddenly very close to blowing his load. His breath hitched, and just as he thought he’d managed to hold himself back, a cool wet fingertip pressed behind his balls, pushing hard into his perineum.
“Can I leave you in a bit of a mess?” he implored as he fixed the panties back in place. “I love the thought of you leaking my come all night.”
“Do you wish we had stopped more? Done more things? The Grand Canyon, Saint Louis, New England, all of Texas…” Tony asked Steve.
That night, sleeping in an AirBnB with a skylight above the bed, Tony counts stars and listens to the sounds of thunder approaching over the sea.
Stark brightened, as if he’d just remembered it was his anniversary. “Thanks,” he said, but his eyes were on Steve’s. “Five years, and it’s still so amazing.”
They slumped against one another, then Steve lowered them carefully down the wall, slipping out of Tony as he went. Tony began immediately to leak Steve’s copious come onto the floor, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
Tony gasped as Steve lined up their cocks and thrust hard. Even with the material between them, muting the friction, it was too much stimulus.
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s back, holding him close. He breathed deeply, the smell of sex still heavy in the air.
Despite his adage that they’re not in a rush, Steve does step on it bright and early the next morning. Tony’s starting to wear down his patented lack of a sleep schedule, mostly with the aid of coffee and Steve kisses. They’re headed towards Montana before seven.
“We gotta do that again,” Steve murmured, standing and joining Tony near the bed. He wrapped his arms around him, tucking him close. “You smell like the armor, now.”
Clint rolled his eyes and gave them some space. Even though he thankfully couldn’t read minds anymore, it still felt like he was seeing something he shouldn’t when he was around the Avengers’ resident power couple. They were both so...intense. All the time.
“Please remain where you are,” JARVIS insisted, sounding apologetic. “Miss Potts will be here shortly to triage and do threat assessment.”
Tony stared at him. How come Steve could always pinpoint the truth, even through Tony’s best bullshit?
Tony takes compliments about as well as a stubborn ox, but in the dark, wrapped in Steve and their blankets, he smiles his soft, secret smile. “You sap,” he murmurs, and leans up to press a kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth.
Steve smiles beatifically down. “I know,” he said, and his voice was a little breathy. The first sign that he is as affected as Tony. “I want you good and worked up for me.”
“Nothing special about that, Cap,” Tony chuckled brightly, but it was fake. “I had an extra car. Sometimes the Audi just doesn’t feel right, you know? So I switch to the Jag. It’s a side effect of being a spoiled rich boy.”
A few minutes later, with little fanfare, they pull out of the airport and jump on the highway. Steve wants to make it to Toledo by dinner.
Tony’s grin spread wide. “Of course, honey, we can do whatever you want, but rest assured that thing is getting inside me. God, you have no idea what you do to me.”
Steve wove through traffic and glimpsed the flying metal octopus through the buildings. He turned towards the fighting and pressed the bike harder.
Tony met his gaze head on, and once he determined Steve was still in a good headspace, he left them on. “Good boy,” he praised, “Letting me know what you need. I only ever give you what you need.”
Usually Maria would come in and shake her head, pull Tony away before the more violent clips began. But Tony’s parents had been screaming, last night, and Maria was in Paris now, so Tony was alone with his father.
“Nothing,” Steve hurried to assure him. “Just—I was thinking about all those times I saw you and Iron Man together. Thinking how—glad I was, that you two had each other. Him to look after your safety, and you to look after his secrets. But really, all this time, you’ve been doing it alone.”
“Look, Steve,” Tony cut him off, meeting Steve’s eyes with a knowing look. “I know you’re trying to help. Trying to look out for your pal, yeah? I get it, I do. But getting close to Iron Man is…tricky business. Even if I gave him the time, told him not to come in, he’d still be here, working. He’s like that. Doesn’t know when to quit.
Tony huffed. “Why don’t you get around to doing something about it, hmm?” he goaded. The armor didn’t respond, it just adjusted its grip on Tony’s wrists and set its free gauntlet to the soft, vulnerable skin of Tony’s pale throat.
Later, after the fight was done and the aliens had destroyed half of New York, Rogers cornered Tony in a SHIELD conference room post-debrief.
Tony looks out over the joyous scene, and though the weather is cloudy, it seems to be bright and happy regardless. Steve holds his hand as they walk barefoot down the beach.
Before long, the full heavy thickness of Steve was sliding into his throat, cutting off his air. He looked up through his eyelashes to see Steve, cheeks flushed, staring down at him. His eyes seemed almost lit from inside, hooded and awestruck. “Tony,” he whispered.
The armor was holding Tony against the wall, one gauntlet supporting his weight, the other running cool fingertips over his sac and perineum. It brushed over his hole, a tantalizing tease.
He turned around. The heart-shaped top hem framed his ass and accentuated the roundness of it. The lace formed a lovely pattern in the back. The center of the pattern rested just over his hole, hinting and drawing the eye. He swallowed again, feeling bare and so, so strong at the same time.
“You have a freezer on your own floor, Barton,” Tony pointed out cavalierly. “And I own all the freezers, so I get first pick.”
Steve grunted as he came on Tony’s cock, his hips stuttering uselessly against the brutal pace his Alpha had set. He whined deep in the back of his throat, high on the endorphins, mind whizzing out to space and leaving him floating, peacefully blank and light.
Tony quickly but gently lifts off of Steve's cock and Steve cries out at the rush of sensation it sends through his entire body
“You like this?” Iron Man asked, and maybe it was Tony’s imagination, but he swore the eye sockets were glowing brighter as they looked down at Tony’s bobbing cock, his stretched rim.
“What if you hadn’t been able to wait?” Tony imagined, making tiny abortive thrusts into Steve’s warm, wet mouth. “What if you’d crawled under the table and blown me right there, in front of everyone? They all knew you wanted to,” Tony reminded him. “What if you hadn’t been able to hold back?”
Tony’s eyes softened. “It’s not stupid, darling. Your fantasies are yours, and they’re not up for judgement. Not with me. Besides, kissing myself has definitely crossed my mind in the past.” He winked salaciously. “I’d be willing to give it a try.”
It was true–Steve became incoherent on Tony’s knot. He writhed in pleasure, feeling the full-hot-thereness of Tony, the length and breadth and depth of him all through himself. It was transcendent, to be caught here, filled and used and wild with it. He was reduced to his basest components.
too, curling around his cock and catching the fabric against his skin. His ass and cock were enveloped, and he felt himself careening toward the edge of orgasm.
Then he felt Tony’s other warm hand rub the lube into his skin, ignoring his cock and hole but getting his whole groin slippery with it, and the pure submission of holding still and letting Tony play with him like that wiped out any coherent thought. He was at the mercy of his lover, unhinged, floating.
“M’fine,” Iron Man slurred, sounding so much like Tony just had, it made Steve grin. “Got hit in the stomach a lil bit. M’ out of the suit, got patched up.”
Tony only rubbed his thumb across the base of Steve’s cock and hummed. “But what a wonderful place to stay for a while, wouldn’t you agree?”
“…One twitch, and this thing’ll blow your vertebrae out of your body. I promise, it’s not a fun way to go.”
But Tony’s hands on him were heaven. Tony’s praise and soothing was angelic, and he would do anything to keep that sweetness geared toward him. He would traverse hell.
, and the second gauntlet came up to wrap carefully around the hand Tony had left on its chest. It moved his arm up, backing him up until he was pressed against the bedroom wall, and held it there above his head. The other gauntlet slipped from around his waist to copy the movements with his other hand, and then he was held up against the wall, one powerful metal thigh against his groin, and the helmet of the armor so close he could smell motor oil. Tony’s dick was definitely fully hard now—It matched the hardness of the armor’s cock against his stomach.
“You, you,” Tony stuttered helplessly. He clung to Steve, unable to make his hands let go where they were clenched on the back of Steve’s button-down.
Tony didn’t have all that much of a sweet tooth, really. He preferred savory foods, with spice and complex flavor. He loved a burger and fries as much as the next red-blooded American, sure, but when it came to dessert, he would often pass.
Tony wasn’t too proud to admit that he closed his eyes and screamed quite loudly when the tip of his dick made contact with the back of Steve’s throat. Steve swallowed around him once, twice, then started up an even rhythm of bobbing and sucking. Tony opened his eyes again to watch, and noticed that his hands were wrapped in Steve’s dark blond hair, cradling the back of his skull. Steve himself was enthusiastic, letting spit coat his lips and chin, focused entirely on his task. He twirled his tongue around the head on every pull, then swallowed greedily around the base, repeating the tricks he knew Tony liked best again and again. His fingertips were digging bruises into Tony’s hips, and his knees brushed against Tony’s ankles.
That was apparently the wrong thing to say, because Tony leaned back on his heels, looming over Steve and pulling those teasing touches away.
Now, his wings were tattered and broken. He’d woken up in Afghanistan, pinioned and dirty, his long primaries cut, snapped in some places. He would never fly without the armor again. Even today, he kept the lower half of his wings covered by the advanced prosthetic he invented. His ugly, white primaries never saw the light of day.
They stay like that until Bruce wanders in a half hour later and calls out, “They finally got their act together!” His announcement is met by a chorus of “Finally!” from the kitchen. Tony has to move then, so he can throw a pillow at Bruce’s retreating head.
[Please say yes, I have nothing else to do that will keep me away from Steve. Or from thinking about Steve.]
They make good time after that, flying down the highways at over eighty miles per hour just to match traffic. Tony remembers reading somewhere that, until recently, Montana had no speed limit on the highways. He laughs as Steve weaves between trucks and cars, clutching him harder than he has since they left Philly.
“Still, it’s nice to see that gold again. You think SHIELD would let me stop dyeing?” Steve chuckled sardonically. “If you had white tips, we’d be wing twins.” With that, he walked away, shooting a kind grin over his shoulder.
Tony sucked in a breath through his teeth at the feeling of Steve’s hand on him, when not even a minute ago he’d been sure Cap was about to give him a lecture. It was whiplash of the best kind.
“No, no, don’t. I’m really okay. I just. Um. God, I don’t know how to say this, I’ve never done this before. Steve, I’m expecting.”
Steve scrambled to comply. He always tended to do better with a little direction, at least at first. Tony was so good at providing it.
“He was the man who helped you escape the Ten Rings, right?” Tony nodded somberly. “He helped you of his own free will. It was his choice, Tony. He was a brave man. But his death wasn’t your fault—it was the fault of those terrorists. Just like Coulson’s death was the fault of Loki, and Pepper getting hurt was the fault of the Mandarin.”
“Gonna keep me warm,” Tony mentioned almost offhand, but the thought spun Steve out of his own head once more. To be used to keep Tony warm, to keep his knot warm, yes, that was all Steve wanted.
Tony’s eyes were dark and glittering in the low light, and he smiled so softly that it was at odds with the sweet torture he was putting Steve through. “Good, that’s perfect. That’s exactly where I want you.”
It really was unfair, too. Because he’d been so clever during the fight today, and nothing got Steve’s engine running like his lover being ridiculously clever. Living with the serum, he was used to having a higher sex drive, and getting more boners at inopportune times. But something about watching Tony today had completely reset his brain to sex mode.
This wasn’t what he thought would happen when Tony said he wanted to spend some time between Steve’s legs.
Steve kept the first kiss chaste and warm, pressing softly for only a second or two, then pulling away only an inch. He met Tony’s eyes, searching.
Stark scooted back from the table so he was just out of Clint’s radius. “What, Barton,” he half-sneered, half-cajoled. “Can’t handle a little sensual daydream every once in a while?”
It was no secret that Omegas loved to be knotted. But Steve loved it a bit more than most, especially with Tony doing the knotting.
“Iron Man,” he called, watching the suit in front of him fall into resting protocol—slight movements which replicated breathing. “How do you feel about surprising Steve tonight?”
Tony arched into the bruising kisses to his throat, shivering with each nip of sharp teeth. Steve continued his path down until the cotton button-down got in the way. He paused to rip it away, buttons scattering across the floor in all directions.
“You’d be so pretty for me, baby. Just like you are now. But then they’d all know. They’d all see how much of a cockslut you are for me, darling. God, wouldn’t that be something?”
Tony came shouting down Steve’s throat. It seemed to last an eternity. Finally, as his vision cleared and he could feel something besides overwhelming pleasure, he felt that Steve had managed to slip a lubed finger fully into his hole and was now pumping it into him firmly.
But no matter how Steve pried, JARVIS would not say anything else. The door to his suite was locked, as were all the other doors, so finally Steve slumped against the hallway wall, cowl in his hands.
Tony chose to ignore the compliments, because they did not compute. “But. Steve, I don’t really, ah. Believe in the soulmates thing?”
While the people in this fic are technically not in costume, I felt like wingfic was basically me dressing my fave characters in a different costume for a while so i can make them fall in love in new and inventive ways, right?
The look in his lover’s eye was dark, hungry, like he was on the hunt. Steve felt the same spirit rise up in himself and match it. They moved as one to bring their lips together.
Still, he sometimes wondered if the person who shared his pattern would ever come forward to meet him. It was hard to tell, anymore, with half his wings gone, but once they had been a glorious dark red, his undersides a burnished gold, and his flight primaries tipped in shocking white. He wishes he could see his wings again, just once. Even if the person attached to them wasn’t meant to be with him, like the old wives’ tale said.
Tony stood in all his near-naked glory, flushed and sweaty from a long workout. His hair was swept every which way, like he’d run his hands through it. His collar bones shimmered in a thin layer of sweat just above the neckline of his workout tank. His arms were muscled, shoulders toned, his whole core looked rock solid. He was lifting a corner of his shirt to wipe his forehead, and so Steve got a full view of his gorgeous, tanned stomach. The waistband of his gym shorts hung low, exposing the sinful vee between his hip bones. Even his legs, long and shaped, were on full display, the hem of the shorts so much higher than was probably decent.
With some help from JARVIS, Steve managed to get Tony into his penthouse and into bed. Tony huffed when Steve moved him to get the blankets out from under where he had landed, but settled right away when Steve tucked him in.
“Have a good night,” Clint called after him, because even though he wasn’t a spy and sucked at lying, he knew when to pretend something that happened didn’t happen.
“You sadist,” Tony accused, his heart thumping. “Listen, I’m gonna call Steve. JARVIS will coordinate with your schedule to set up an appointment. Um, I guess, I’ll call if we have any questions?”
Under a dust cover, in the direct center of the spot is Steve’s bike. It is shining like it had just been waxed, oiled and full of gas. Tony’s bag only barely fits on the back of it, but they get everything strapped down well enough. Steve produces two helmets from nowhere, and helps Tony fit his before swinging his leg over the bike and turning her on. She purrs like a kitten.
“Shh, it’s okay, Steve,” Tony soothed, and his weight shifted so his ass was in contact with Steve’s upper thighs, so tantalizingly close to where he wanted. “No judgement. Please tell me.”
“I hate him,” Tony growled, storming through his penthouse in a manner that Rhodey would probably call pacing, but he Was Not Pacing Dammit. “I hate him, I hate him so much.”
A few more licks and Steve finally pulled off Tony’s cock. He ducked down to look at where his fingers were disappearing into Tony, gaze hungry and bright. Then, keeping Tony pinned by his hip, he stood and pressed his body against Tony’s, trapping him naked against the wall. Steve’s uniform was still on him, and dirty, and in places where they touched, he left traces of dirt on Tony’s naked skin.
“Yes, boy, shut your mouth,” Howard growled. His face looked drawn and off-color. “Steve Rogers was...he was the best damn man that ever lived. The best damn man.”
“God, you’re beautiful,” Tony murmured, heartfelt. His touch softened, teasing through the silk, his fingertips almost reverent as they traced the lace’s pattern.
“You loved it that much, then. Don’t worry, it was definitely my new favorite, too. You really are so…beautiful.” Tony sounded like he was in awe.
Steve couldn’t take it. He thrust up into Tony’s leg, letting Tony block off his air supply with his dick, and his eyes rolled into the back of his head as he came and came. The orgasm wiped him, his vision going white with hazy pleasure.
“Need you,” he admitted, and if he were any less turned on, he’d be embarrassed at how breathy his voice sounded.
Dyeing wings was still pretty taboo, even in the 21st century. That someone like Captain America would dye them was unthinkable.
Tony’s finger came back covered in lube and danced around his rim, spreading slick. Steve tried desperately not to thrust into the sensation, to stay still. He was rewarded a moment later when Tony breached him for the first time that night.
Yellowstone is full of natural geysers, rock formations, volcanic activity, and wildlife so sensational that Tony can’t help but get lost in the pure science of it all. He mentions offhand that he could spend days here, and Steve says, “Alright,” and before he knows it, they are booking another three nights with the creepy deer-head thing. Joy.
“Iron Man,” Steve spoke up, and Tony glanced over at him. His cock was out now, his palm stroking unforgivingly over the head, harder than Tony liked himself. “Do you think you could...lift him?”
JARVIS, apparently sensing the rhetorical question, stayed silent. Tony huffed, even though he knew he wouldn’t have reacted well to a serious response just then.
Tony sat up and wiped his mouth, looking both awed and proud. “You taste amazing,” he confided, moving up to press a kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth. Steve caught him and kissed him fully, tasting his own release, and it only made him hotter.
The fingers thrust hard again, and then again, and soon Iron Man had set a brutal pace. He finger fucked Tony up into the wall, making his hips jerk and his hands slip against the wall above him. Steve groaned loudly. “God, I need to come,” he begged.
after what feels like hours Tony finally rises just the tiniest bit before sinking back down, going impossibly slow and moving just the tiniest bit higher on each upstroke
The armor had yet to pull out, but it dropped Tony’s wrists down to its cold chestplate. The hand at his hip supported his weight, but it no longer kept him pinned quite as strongly. “Let me down, Iron Man,” Tony said, bracing for the pull-out. Iron Man complied, sliding out of Tony’s well-fucked hole smoothly.
"Shhhh," Tony says, gently lifting his arms to cup Steve's cheek and run his fingers through Steve's hair
“Steve, so good, yeah,” Tony was growling, almost without realizing it. “Mine, my Steve, looking so pretty for me.”
But Tony is relentless, he keeps going, not slowing down or using Steve any more gently, and before long Steve can feel it, can feel the tightness in his abdomen, can feel his balls start to draw up
Tony’s eyes were blown black when Steve met his gaze. “Jesus Christ, Steve,” Tony murmured. “You’re perfect. That was amazing, sweetheart, just perfect.”
They’re in South Dakota, Tony doesn’t point out, which only claims to fame are Mount Rushmore and not being North Dakota. Still, he has to admit that the trip hasn’t been dull, even though they’ve said almost nothing to each other all day. He shrugs and lets Steve have that win.
Steve makes an executive decision to skip Las Vegas, much to Tony’s dismay. He would have loved to see Steve, blushing up to his ears, attempt to turn down a sex worker without offending her. Nevertheless, they make brilliant headway through the deserts of the American Southwest, and by the time they reach Ely, Tony is ready to never set foot on sand again.
“Good, so good for me,” Tony breathed, like Steve had given him a gift. “How does it feel? You doing okay?”
They come to a stop outside a log cabin facade, its large glass windows facing the setting sun. Steve wheedles his way into a room at a full motel with his All-American innocence, not even pulling the “I’m Captain America” card. The antlered animal on the wall of their room is unrecognizable to Tony, but it makes Steve smile, so he puts up with having a dead thing above his head all night.
Tony wasn’t sure if Mike meant he would do great at telling Steve, or at having a baby inside him, but either way, he appreciated it. “Thanks.”
Tony takes the time to wreck Steve that evening, tonguing his cock and balls until he shudders from overstimulation. Steve is still staring blankly at the ceiling, chanting Tony’s name under his breath while Tony rubs off against his thigh. As he comes, Steve murmurs “I love you,” with as much voice as he can muster. Tony explodes all over the sheets.
[Hopefully I won’t dream of Steve’s pancakes again.] Clint caught the stray thought as Stark passed him to leave. [I love his breakfast food. I’d love to wake up to that smell every day.]
By the time they make it back to the motorcycle, their toes are covered in wet sand and their hair is windblown. They clean off as best they can, but Tony still has the grit of sand on the inside of his socks for the rest of the day.
“Um, Harder, yeah, give it to him harder,” Steve agreed. His hand was flying over his own cock, the other pulling his balls to stave off his release. “Tony, I need to come.”
Tony wobbled on his feet for a second before catching his balance. He felt between his legs. “No damage,” he reported. “Perfect test run.”
Natasha and the jet roared into the battlefield behind them, and Steve vaguely heard her order the remaining two villains to place their hands over their heads. “Come on,” he urged, helping Iron Man up. “Come on, onto the jet.”
“Me too,” Steve chuckled, dragging them both down onto the soft mattress and spooning Tony, keeping him close as they drifted off.
Clint only smiled wide, because even though he claimed to hate sappy shit, he never begrudged Natasha her PDA.
His replies were more stilted, didn’t always match the conversation quite right. He was quieter, less involved in whatever was going on. Steve had always assumed that this was because he was focused on protecting his boss, and surveying for threats. But there was another thing that was different, about the way Iron Man moved around Tony. His stance and gait were more robotic, more precise. Almost like…
“Tony,” he begged, still sounding shaky as all hell. He stopped there, unsure what he needed. What he was begging for.
Tony called Steve’s name for close to fifteen minutes, forgetting completely that he was on a mission  for SHIELD until JARVIS politely reminded him. He clutched the test in one fist, protecting it with the other hand as if it were a flame that might burn out. He dare not check it again.
He’s right, of course. As they ascend from forty-five hundred feet to over fourteen thousand, the temperature drops dramatically, almost to the point that Tony needs a jacket. The top of Grays Peak looks out over many more mountains and valleys, mottled with the shadows of hundreds of fluffy white clouds. The air is so thin up here, it feels like there’s something constricting his chest when he breathes in. He nearly panics, but then Steve’s warm hand is on his back, and he takes deep breaths, and he is suddenly exhilarated.
“God, no!” Stark insisted a little too forcefully. [You’re my shield now, you better not go anywhere,] he added in his brain.
The Captain was leading them down a dead-end hallway, one with only restrooms and a supply closet. He gripped Tony by the elbow and dragged him into the men’s room, locking the swinging door behind them.
They were still sitting so close, Tony practically on Steve’s lap, their heads close together. Steve thought maybe he could lean in and press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. He tried not to remember how he’d imagined this exact scenario, but with Iron Man in his place. He had to stifle a laugh, then.
Usually, if Tony asked Steve to just take what he wanted in bed and use him for his own pleasure, Steve would completely refuse. He didn't like hurting Tony, even if Tony wanted to be hurt. But, like this, so raw and helpless, he was defenseless against his desire to claim Tony fully, in the way they both craved.
Steve let his own hands fall to Tony’s hips, felt the familiar soft fabric there. Tony wore panties more often than boxers, anymore. It was tantalizing, to have him so bare, but still covered right where Steve wanted to look, to touch. This particular pair especially drew the eye to Tony’s crack, but Steve knew that wasn’t what he wanted tonight.
Chugging his chocolate milk, he stood and set the glass in the sink before tossing a lazy salute at the chagrined doctor Banner and turning tail. He’d stopped kidding himself that he wasn’t running about twelve hours in.
Finally Tony pulled back, lips wet with saliva. “Want to spread your legs, darling?” He asked, shifting his weight to give Steve room to move. “I want to get you ready to take my cock.”
Steve took the few seconds that Tony was distracted to look him over. His stomach was still wrapped under his shirt, but he was carrying himself more confidently than yesterday, so Steve thought it might be only a flesh wound. His reactor shone bright and undamaged from his chest, and Steve wondered if it was the same one that powered the suit. He hoped not—Tony shouldn’t be powering that advanced tech with the same thing that kept him alive.
Steve almost hadn’t, he remembered. He’d had to resort to his Cap persona just so he wouldn’t break, right there in the conference room, and beg for Tony’s cock. God, the mere thought of it was enough to bring him to the edge. He shuffled forward and rubbed his crotch against Tony’s leg, desperate for any kind of friction.
“Reminiscing on the good old days when, for one shining moment, I knew something you didn’t know about Tony Stark.”
That was a sobering thought. Tony had been alone, all this time. How isolating it must be—to keep a secret identity—to feel trapped like that even around his own team.
Steve shrugged, dropping Tony’s shirt and raising a hand to thumb at the edge of the cut above his face. “You were hurt,” he explained, meeting Tony’s eyes. He noticed they were slightly dilated, like Tony had been in a dark room. “I wasn’t sure if you had any broken bones, or if you had a concussion.”
“Look over there, Iron Man,” Tony said, nodding toward Steve. “Looks like we’ve got an interested audience.”
“How’s it feel, Tony? Tell me,” Steve asked. The slapping sounds of his masturbation had begun again, almost like he couldn’t help himself.
“Look at you,” Tony breathed. “I’ve barely touched you. Do you think you’ll come like this? All tied up and open for me, but I’m not giving you what you want. No, only what I want to give you.”
“Shh, shh, it’s okay,” he promised, letting Steve clutch at his wrists. “It’s okay, take what you need. Come on, Steve. Fuck me.”
Tony didn’t believe what the superstitious people said about your wings linking you to some sort of metaphysical ‘soulmate’. There wasn’t any science, any logic behind their arguments. At the end of the day, Tony was a scientist. He didn’t believe in magic.
“Good, so perfect, Steve,” Tony encouraged, and Steve sunk lower into the sensations. He could just exist and feel, and Tony would be so pleased.
“Shh, Tony,” Steve hushed, his arms coming up to catch the engineer on his next pass. “It’s okay. I forgive you.”
“Sure,” Clint said before he could stop himself, because no one wanted to see that fight happen before both of them could cool down. “Do you, ah. Need some space?”
Steve reaches over, like he’s going to set his hand on Tony’s arm, but Tony flinches back. Steve freezes, lowers his hand, and Tony can’t help meeting his eyes then. He sees confusion, worry, and something deeper. Something more sad.
“Good. So, I just thought that maybe. I guess, I wasn’t trying, or anything. We weren’t trying, I didn't even have a heat. I thought I was sterile, for God’s sakes, I—”
“I’m okay, Steve,” Tony promised, running soothing hands up and down Steve’s flanks. “I was here, safe, the whole time.”
They ride across Utah in a single day, and Tony, once again, revises his opinion of the most beautiful place in the country. The pavement beneath them turns an almost startling red color, matching the rocks surrounding them on all sides.
Steve’s blush did not deteriorate. Tony ran his hands down from Steve’s shoulders to his hips, glancing up for permission before feeling the outline of Steve’s dick in his pants. Steve moaned wantonly and shifted his hips.
“Want to hear you, my darling,” Tony asked, before swiping his tongue up Steve’s shaft and swallowing him down. He bobbed once, twice, six times, and then Steve was coming helplessly down his throat.
and faster than Steve can think Tony's got his sleep pants down around his ankles and he's mouthing at the head of Steve's cock, making it as wet as possible
They get up before dawn. The slow seep of fog between the towers of the Manhattan skyline greets them, and though the crowd of traffic is unrelenting, this seems as close to sleeping as New York ever gets. Tony yawns into his coffee mug and snuggles closer to Steve’s side as they take a cab to the airport.
“I’m not going to last many more nights like last night, darling. I’m soft, and my back needs to be pampered. If I don’t treat myself right, I’ll start aging again. Do you want to be dating a crippled, wrinkled Tony Stark?”
Tony had a Captain America poster hanging over his bed. He had the comic books, though Howard kept them in plastic sleeves and told him he could read them when he was older. He’d heard story after story, he knew everything there was for a five year old boy to know about the good Captain.
“God, you look incredible like this,” Tony told him. “Your muscles stand out when you move. Like a kinetic sculpture, a work of art. I love your back. Your ass,” here, his hands dipped lower, squeezing and pulling to expose Steve’s hole briefly. “Your thighs. God, I could watch your thighs flex for hours like this.”
Then again, there is life here. Not just the occasional small town, but also desert sheep and foxes, snakes and even birds. The coyote calls ring out at night, audible even from the safety of their motel in town.
Hearing it out loud nearly sent Tony babbling again. “The test was positive. Could be expired. It’s been in my bathroom for months, and really, Mike, if you know anything about me, you know what kind of shit I keep in there.”
“Steve,” he said, sounding surprised. He had a cut above his eyebrow and a bandage wrapped around his upper abdomen.
“A baby,” Tony agreed, and he was pretty sure he hid the crack in his voice pretty well, but the tears on Steve’s shirt were obvious. “Our baby.”
“I’m not going to leave you alone again,” Steve promised. “You won’t have to carry this by yourself.”
Steve gulped down air and tried to slow down again, to the slow, teasing pace that he knew Tony preferred. It felt like every slick drag of the sheets on his cock was multiplied, if he took his time. He knew he wouldn’t get anywhere close to coming at this pace.
So, Tony saw the war footage. He saw the men struggling and the planes taking off, and then he saw the cowl, the stripes. He saw the shield.
So then how did Tony get home so fast? He’d already been in the lab when they had arrived, because they’d brought Iron Man to the only entrance to the lab, other than Iron Man’s landing pad. There was no way he could have run that distance home in time to beat them, especially with the injuries he was sporting. And Steve had stood guard outside that very same entrance from the time he dropped off Iron Man until Tony had stumbled out.
Steve doesn’t push, he just presses a soft kiss to the nape of Tony’s neck. Tony shudders, melts further into Steve’s embrace, then hums.
Skirting around Chicago turns out to be the right choice, for even so they are caught in traffic. They make it to Davenport, Iowa before the sun sets and Steve proclaims they won't go further. This time they get a proper hotel, at Tony’s insistence.
They sat and ate on the ratty couch, Tony gesturing with his chopsticks as he chatted about the armor repairs. Steve stayed quiet, but he listened calmly, making sure to nod along and ask questions when Tony paused. It was the same as it had always been—Steve didn’t feel awkward now that he knew the truth.
“Not a child,” Tony protested half-heartedly. But he was already relaxing under the covers, sighing sweetly and letting his eyes flutter closed. “G’night, Steve.”
“My pleasure, Mr. Stark,” the armor replied. He casually saluted towards Steve, and with a “Cap,” and a nod farewell, the Iron Lover turned out of the bedroom and boarded Tony’s private elevator down to the workshop.
Steve glanced up at Pepper. “I must have done something wrong. I wasn’t supposed to know, about Tony. Being Iron Man.”
There was a moment or two of shuffling as Tony grabbed something from the end table, then there was the *snick of a lotion bottle opening, and Tony’s deft hands were gliding over Steve’s back. They smoothed the lotion into his skin, not really massaging, but giving a nice rub-down. Steve would have turned entirely to liquid if he knew how.
Steve knows if he could just, a little more, or shift a little bit, he would go off like a rocket, but Tony told him not to come, so instead he whines and cries out while Tony uses him, desperate and on the edge but never tipping over
“Uunh,” Steve groaned, and lolled his head to one side, catching Tony’s face in the corner of his eye. “Feels...not enough. Not enough friction. Hot, wet, not enough.”
“Feels, feels good,” Tony managed. “Fingers are cold. Getting warmer. He’s getting so deep, already, and he’s so—hard, it’s unlike anything I’ve ever felt before.”
“Do you want to come, Steve, baby?” Tony was asking, and he was panting too, his free hand stroking across Steve’s tongue faster now.
“Hmm.” [He’s afraid of you finding out how unspeakably in love he is with Stark,] she filled in for him.
"I'm not going to stop till I'm done," Tony pants, slamming down again so Steve hits his prostate dead-on
“It’s more than that,” Steve disagreed. “You’re tense. You haven’t preened properly in weeks. What’s up?”
They drive into Seattle with the morning rush, to Steve’s dismay. he grumbles about traffic until they are in sight of the Space Needle, and then he only shuts up when Tony mentions they should stop for some nice seafood. They spend half the day sightseeing along the Puget Sound. When Tony announces he’s seen enough fish for one day, they hop back on the bike and trek slowly southwest. The land is green again, almost more lush than the east coast, and Tony spies wildflowers on nearly every slope.
Steve has never felt so hard in his life and he needs some friction soon, he needs to feel something because his dick is aching, he needs to touch Tony because he feels like he's going to burst at any second
“Steve,” Tony moaned, drawn out. He was wrecked, still crying, sweaty and spent, but hard and wanting. He wanted Steve to fuck him. He wanted Steve to pin him to the wall and use all his strength, no holds barred. He was desperate for it.
“Do people do that? People do that, right? Take two? Jesus, I’m an idiot. JARVIS, order thirty pregnancy tests.”
“They said–” Steve cut off. He grabbed at Tony’s hands, lifting them up to inspect them in the light. “They said they would cut off your fingers.”
Steve drives them off the fastest route when they draw closer to Ohio, nudging the bike towards Cleveland instead of going straight through the state. They arrive a little behind schedule but breathless at the expanse of Lake Erie sprawling out before them. The drive from then on is punctuated with glimpses of the blue-grey water to their right as they speed onward, racing the dying sun.
Tony petted Steve’s balls with teasing fingertips, so close to Steve's dick, but still on such a sensitive spot. He wanted more, he needed more but Tony just smirked and lightly ran his fingers over his sac again and again and again. Steve was going to die.
Tony sometimes found it frustrating to explain his relationship to other people. There was so much misinformation, so many ignorant people, it made him want to say
Steve is nuzzling into the crook of his neck, his hands rubbing soothing circles on Tony’s back. “Tony,” he breathed. “Oh, Tony. That’s not it at all.” Tony is too busy hugging back for a few moments to register Steve’s words, but Steve isn’t stopping.
Steve whined again, but the muscles in his arms and back relaxed at Tony’s proclamation. He was being good. He was doing what Tony wanted. He closed his eyes and tried to relax further, to let himself feel.
Tony tortured him with his mouth and clever hands, thumbing at one nipple while nipping and sucking at the other. Steve had never known he was sensitive there, but Tony was relentless, and Steve couldn’t help but squirm under his attentions. He was whining aloud when Tony pulled off and whispered in his ear, “Tell me what you fantasized. I know you imagined this, Steve. Tell me.”
“So good, darling,” Tony moaned. “God, to think you were thinking about this out in the field. You were, weren’t you? I bet you wanted to sink to your knees and take me right there in the rubble.”
“See, that was good,” Tony encouraged. “We agreed on something. It was hot. Now, I know that’s not all.”
“You’re so desperate,” he babbled, pulling lightly on Steve’s hair. “Look at you, dragging me aside in the first free moment. Did you even pay attention to debrief? Or were you doing your best not to eye-fuck me in a room full of our respected colleagues?”
“I, ah,” Tony starts. He has to swallow to clear the lump in his throat. “I’m heading to Tokyo this afternoon. SI business. Just thought you should know I’ll be unavailable for a while.”
“That’s so hot,” Tony couldn’t help murmuring. Steve seemed to notice he was still able to talk, and plundered his mouth again, his hand working furiously to pull Tony’s undershirt up. Finally he gave up and let his wrists go just long enough to drag the clothing off his arms and over his head, then he threw it aside and cought Tony’s wrists against the wall once more.
In an instant Steve was at his side, running soothing hands over his back. “Of course. Of course I want to have a family with you. God, Tony, It’s a dream come true.”
It only took a half a dozen strokes, maybe less, before Tony was coming untouched all over the stomach plates of the armor. Iron Man fucked him through it, lowering the vibrations back to the lowest setting, but thrusting hard and deep until Tony’s cock gave a pathetic pulse and stopped spurting.
Finally. Tony had finally done it. He’d built the most expensive and ridiculous sex toy on the planet. Steve would be so excited, he’d get those adorable spots of red high on his cheeks.
“I am very glad we didn’t do Las Vegas,” Steve muttered, and there was that blush Tony had been looking for. “But the rest of it? It’s just incentive to get out here another time. What do you say, Tony? Want to come on another road trip with me?”
But he couldn’t be happier that he got to bring Steve along for the ride. His Steve, with his careful, honest voice, his respectful demeanor, his misleading blush. Under all that was a kinky son-of-a-bitch, and Tony was so grateful that he was the one Steve had trusted with that, with his deepest desires. He was going to do everything in his power to prove to Steve that he’d made the right choice.
Of course, Tony probably would have eventually done this without Steve’s fantasies prompting him. He was a very sexual being, and he hadn’t been lying when he’d said he was intrigued by the idea of making out with himself. He loved the armor, and he loved sex. This was simply a natural progression, for him.
But what was perfect about this moment wasn’t that it was with Captain America, he thought as Steve lined up. It was because it was with Steve, because he was giving Steve something unmeasurable, and Steve was giving something of himself in return. It was that they could trust each other, no one else, with this, with these moments where one or both of them felt less than human. They could bring each other back from that brink.
Steve did finally let up a little at the real pain in Tony’s voice, but only for a second. Then he was dropping to his knees in front of Tony, pulling on the zipper of the suit to open it. He shoved the material to the side, fumbling for a moment with Tony’s boxers, then carefully pulling Tony’s cock out into the cool air.
The desert is beautiful, though, in its own way. Not as grandiose as the mountains, nor as placid as the lakes and oceans. Still, it does seem endless, almost like the cornfields of the midwest. It drives on relentlessly, nearly impenetrable aside from the straight, weathered freeways that criss-cross it. Tony couldn’t imagine covering this ground without an engine and wheels underneath him. Even with the bike, he feels vulnerable to the elements—like, for the first time since starting this trip, he’s found a place he couldn’t tackle on his own.
“Of course not,” Tony said haughtily. “They never could. No, this is much worse. They’re discontinuing the Captain America popsicles.”
And when Steve tries to lift the slip, tries to get his hands underneath so he can feel Tony's skin against his Tony grabs Steve's wrist and pulls it away, holding his hand firm above his head and continues to finger himself while grinding down on Steve's leg, just using Steve for pleasure while he forces Steve to watch
“Yes,” Tony heard his own voice echo back, and remembered how much fun it had been recording those sound bites. “Please.”
want to be married? I mean, aside from hoping to trap a woman into staying with you longer. Obviously they don’t stay long otherwise, not with that halitosis going on.”
Tony immediately started off on his tirade. “He’s self-serving, self-absorbed, and thinks he’s smarter than he is. He makes judgement calls without the full picture. He keeps insisting that we do things his way, and his excuse is that he doesn’t want me to get ‘hurt’. You fucking think I don’t know how to pilot my suit?! I think if I say I can do a thing that I can’t do it? I could be saving us so much time on the field if he just let me do my damn job without having a fight every time, but no! Instead he drones on and on about ‘the safety of the team’ and ‘our highest priority’. I don’t have time to fill out paperwork every time I do a barrel roll!”
“From what I read about Stane,” Steve cut him off, “he was a cruel and evil man. He was selling weapons to the other side, and he tried to kill you multiple times. I can’t say I’m sorry he’s dead.”
When he came to, Tony was curled against his side like a kitten, looking innocent and sated. The ropes were gone, and the mess of come, sweat and tears had been cleaned up. A hand traced soft patterns in his chest hair.
“I’m serious, big guy,” Tony leered. He was in his element, a teasing smile on his face, and his tan skin on display. “I wanna hear about your dirty day-dreams. Call me curious.”
“I told you they feel good,” Tony reminded him, slinking into the room like a proud cat. “You look amazing.”
Just as they rounded the corner to enter the kitchen, Stark strayed close enough to Clint that the archer got a little more context than he really wanted. They were discussing some Captain-America-lookalike camboy that had gone somewhat viral recently, and how Bruce got roped into listening to Stark talk about sexytimes was beyond Clint, but here they were.
It feels so good Steve could come right there, but he can't, he can't, there's not enough friction, he's just barely being pushed into Tony, circling his prostate, but it's not enough
With that, Tony slammed into him one last time, forcing his knot deep into Steve and letting his orgasm truly take him. Steve was filled with Tony’s seed, Tony’s knot swelling to hold it all inside him.
The flight truly is quite short, and because of their Avengers status, they mostly get to skip TSA. Tony remembers taking off, but Steve has to shake him awake when they land in Philly an hour later.
Tony’s hair was in disarray, sweaty and sticking up every which way. He looked like he’d just gotten out of their bed after a thorough lovemaking session. His eyes were still bright with adrenaline from the fight, his shoulders set firmly upright, and that suit was clinging to every curve and muscle. Steve’s mouth watered.
The countryside is emptier here, fading from lush green fields to drier prairies and finally to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Parts of the land are so desolate that they almost run out of gas between rest stops. Steve, ever-prepared, pulls a few spare gallons from his duffel and tops them up on the side of the road, so they make it out okay.
“I’m alright,” Tony promised, threading his now-free hands through Steve’s hair. “We’re alright, love, you made it home.”
“Sure,” Steve agreed readily. “Only, I saw the Jag in the garage right before I rushed out to help with the fight.”
Tony took the test as an afterthought one hazy afternoon in June. He was sore, and a little nauseated, and even though he hadn’t had a heat in months and he was pretty sure he’d entered menopause, he had found the test in the back of his cabinet and thought,
“Not a long flight,” Steve promises, nose pressing into his hair. Tony only hums and sips more coffee.
“Myself and Rhodey, of course.” Colonel Rhodes, Steve’s mind supplied. They’d met twice, and he was introduced as Tony’s best friend. “Director Fury. And now, you.”
“Let me rub against your thigh,” Tony asked, and the machine moved so one of its large, heavy thighs was between Tony’s. The metal was smooth, but the pressure was even and firm, so he thrust lazily against it. He let his eyes fall half-shut, and slid his gaze over to Steve’s corner of the room.
Okay I'm late on this one but i was on a date and i forgot to post before I went out ok pls forgive me
“Yes, darling, it’s a shock, isn’t it? Don’t worry, it will leech some of the heat off. Give you a chance to cool down.”
Steve grinned and closed his eyes. “In the morning, we’ll talk about it,” he promised, before hugging Tony tight and falling to sleep.
“Sure, he’s fine,” Iron Man assured. “Suit’s a little banged up—those lasers pack a punch! Do me a favor and keep an eye on these two while I check on him?”
The road is long and hilly in places, but most of the state is dense, flat cornfields. They whip by, uncaring as two of the most powerful people in the world weave between them—but then everything seems small in those fields. Tony is used to feeling small, living in such a big city, but this is a different sort of small feeling. This makes the world feel boundless. The only things keeping the world together are the corn and the thin, everlasting strip of road ahead and behind them. He shivers despite the sun and Steve’s radiating warmth at his front.
It ends up taking them nearly ten hours, and most of that extra time is spent idling in traffic around the city. Finally they give up and find a shitty hotel in West Memphis that isn’t booked solid. For the first time, Tony wished they had a car. That way they could sleep in it instead of risking bedbugs in this hellhole.
And then Tony was back, armed with a wet cloth and a bottle of water. He cleaned Steve off, undid the spreader bar, and titled a trickle of water into Steve’s mouth. He went to undo the cuffs, too, but Steve shook his head.
“Mr. Stark has a second car. He likes to travel with options. He, ah, slipped in and drove off at the beginning of the fight.”
“I know you are, darling. You’re performing amazingly, you’ve been doing so well. Just a little longer, hm?”
They are straddling the bike again less than half an hour later. The day is overcast, but not threatening rain, according to Steve, so they press on, Tony paying less attention to their route and more to the towns and scenery they pass along the way.
"i'm not done yet," Tony says through clenched teeth. "I told you not to come," he growls, grinding down so Steve's cock is pressed right against his prostate, a relentless force of pressure and pleasure that has Tony throwing his head back and gasping
been after.] But her raised eyebrow communicated the same. That was the amazing thing about Natasha. They were already so much on the same wavelength, that it didn’t feel quite as intrusive to be forced to listen to her thoughts. They already basically read each other’s minds.
“J, run a full scan. Tell me…” Tony couldn’t bring himself to say the words out loud. “Tell me if there are any abnormalities.”
Because of their slower pace, They make it to Sioux Falls just as Tony’s stomach starts to remind him of its existence.
Rhodey dodged the pillow almost without trying and finally set down his phone. “Alright, then, Tones,” he relented. “Tell me all about how much you hate Captain America.”
And when Tony has to pull off of Steve's dick to let out the most wanton moan Steve has ever heard, Steve is quick to sit up and pull Tony into his lap, kissing into his mouth and tasting himself on Tony's tongue
The torture continued. Tony soothed his heated skin with a cool, wet towel, gave him sips of water. Still he thrust down, arched his back up, then thrust again. The rhythm ingrained itself in his head, until it was all he could focus on—the next slide, the next pull, the next word of praise from his lover’s lips.
Tony said something about semi-public sex being a new favorite, and Steve remembered that he was kneeling on a SHIELD bathroom floor. He quickly tucked Tony back in and stood unsteadily, blushing.
But alas, Steve only hugs him tight and tells him, “You know I’ll love you no matter what you look like.”
Maybe, if Steve stayed asleep long enough, one of them would beckon him into their moment, eyes hooded, and ask if he liked what he saw. Ask if he wanted to watch, or to—to—
Tony’s voice cracked on the word, as Steve pushed deeper inside him than before. Two fingers became three on the next thrust, causing Tony to cry out at the glorious stretch.
They made their way to the bedroom. Iron Man trailed dutifully behind, silent except for the clang of its steps. Steve started unbuttoning his shirt frantically, but Tony reached for his hands to stop him. “Not like that, beautiful. Your fantasy was just about watching, remember?”
“I’ll finish getting changed,” Tony told him, backing away once more. “Then we’ll match. Will you get the stuff ready?”
Tony is still fucking himself on Steve, ignoring him almost completely except to adjust Steve's grip on his hips and then keeps going
They are back on the road without stopping long. Steve hums a tune, but it’s lost in the wind as their path weaves slowly north. Tony smiles into the back of his shirt and feels the vibrations in his hands where they cling to Steve’s chest.
(and Tony can’t help capitalizing it in his head) he’s been more jittery than usual. He’s hyper-aware of Steve, of where he is and who he is with. He feels more and more like he should be sharing meals with someone, like he should tell someone the funny things DUM-E did that day, like he is missing out on pieces of someone else’s life.
The thing that strikes Tony about Oklahoma is the people, more so than anything. They’re all…kind. It’s clear this place is about as far from New York or LA as they can get, and still see people at all. Even when Steve kisses Tony sweetly on the cheek, only one or two people turn away in disgust. That’s a better ratio than you get at home, some days.
“Then it sounds like you did everything you could to prevent this from happening. Tony, the only thing you’re guilty of is trusting a man who practically raised you to do his job.”
Steve shifts, but Tony refuses to let himself look up and check Steve’s expression. “How long will you be gone?”
Tony grinned impishly, and that set off a whole other round of fireworks in Steve’s head. “No problem, Spangles. Happens to the best of us. Hey, you going to beat up my punching bags again?”
Steve’s ashen, dirty face turned down to look at him, blinking uncertainly. Tony met his gaze, relaxing into his lover’s hold, into what was going to happen.
“Then that’s what we’ll do,” Tony responded, taking charge. “Why don’t you go sit in that chair, hm? We’ll put on a show for you.”
Oklahoma City to Memphis is a seven hour drive, normally. But this Saturday, it was packed with traffic nearly the whole drive. “It’s Memorial Day Weekend,” Steve finally remembered when they stopped for lunch. “We might get there by dinner.”
Tony swallowed convulsively around his length, holding Steve as deep as he could go, ignoring the tears that sprung to the corners of his eyes. He loved this, he loved–
Riding the motorcycle is uncomfortable for Tony the next morning, after their rambunctious wall-fucking the previous night, but he powers through as best he can. If Steve makes excuses for them to stop and walk around more than he really needs to, well. Tony isn’t going to complain.
Tony shrugs, and ignores the beat his heart skipped at the word relationship. “The Avengers will be fine without me. You’ve got Thor back from Asgard, so you’ll have air support. I don’t think that you’ll need me, unless the world ends again.”
“Wha—” Steve started, before remembering. Iron Man had said there was a third assassin, in the octopus thing. “IRON MAN!” he cried out, already turning to warn his teammate.
He’s packing, hung, whatever you want to call it. There had been some enhancements from the super serum, of course, but he’d been large for his size before, too, and now, well…
“Shhh,” Tony soothed again, and there were warm, calloused hands on his wrists. He checked the tightness of the rope, made sure Steve’s circulation wasn’t being cut off. Then he trailed up to Steve’s shoulders, rubbing at the muscle there and getting Steve to slump into the pillows. He checked the rigging around Steve’s hips and thighs, making sure nothing was rubbing or causing carpet burn. Then, giving Steve’s ass a playful smack, he settled his weight between his thighs on the bed, resting hands on his hips. He moved with Steve’s rocking, encouraging the slow, steady motion down into the sheets.
Steve stared blankly at nothing. Iron Man was empty around Tony. Iron Man wasn’t ever with Tony, that he could remember. Iron Man hadn’t seemed worried about Tony, hadn’t even bothered to check that he got away. Iron Man lied about Tony having a car.
Tony coveted his popsicles, never letting anyone have one. He got into a bit of a feud with the two assassins in the tower, Natasha trying to steal one and Clint battling for space in the communal floor freezer, but Tony won out on both fronts. The team didn’t so much as open the freezer door anymore.
Tony ran the flat of his hand along his length again, and Steve started crying real tears of overstimulation. His entire body was strung tight like a wire, he was going to come, he knew it—
The next morning, Steve wakes him up with his tongue lapping at the base of Tony’s cock and the back of his throat coaxing his orgasm out of him. He cries out.
But the thing is, Tony really enjoys it here. He feels like a kid for the first time in a while, surrounded by science in nature happening real time, before his very eyes. He takes a billion pictures to send to Bruce. He gets too close to a fumarole and almost falls in. He sets up an impromptu science lesson for a school group on a tour, pissing off their guide but enchanting the children and parents alike. Even on the one day it rains, he is exploding at the seams just to get the chance to observe the changes in the ecosystem. Steve watches him with a fond gaze, always at hand if Tony wants him, but mostly enjoying Yellowstone through Tony’s eyes.
After a few months of this, Steve came down to the communal floor to see Tony muttering to himself, standing in front of the freezer. When he got closer, it sounded like Tony was counting.
Thinking about going to yet another beach after the last two has Tony feeling bored, so instead they turn to Roanoke, Virginia. There they enjoy the foothills of the Appalachians. While not as imposing as the heights of the Rockies, they were still scenic, and bursting with flowers in June.
“Yes, Tony,” Rhodey agreed absentmindedly from the couch in the great room, where he was trying to beat the next level of Candy Crush.
“Wow,” Steve breathed. “Iron Man, I didn’t know you could, ah. That you had such precision in your fingers.”
So, all in all, Steve figured it was fine to daydream here and there. Both of the men were single, so he wasn’t cutting out their partners. He wasn’t hurting anyone, anyway. Most of his daydreams were pretty tame compared to the things he’d read about them all on the internet. Besides, it wasn’t like he was picturing
“He gets some,” Tony allowed, his mouth a thin line. “But the guy doesn’t have a family. No friends, outside of the team, really. He doesn’t ask for much time off.”
The penthouse was warm and dark, and Tony’s bed was huge. Steve took his time getting Tony undressed, pressing kisses to every inch of skin as he uncovered it.
Steve nodded, taking over the grip on the two fighter’s necks. He noticed the smaller of the two was only a kid, maybe sixteen.
They come back down the mountain and make it to Denver before the light goes. The mountains lie entirely to the west, now, the listless flatness of the Great Plains stretching out to the east. The city seems broad to them, growing out instead of up like New York is wont to.
,” Steve moaned, and if he hadn’t just come like a freight train, he would have been rock hard. “It doesn’t bother you?”
Steve’s ears burned, and he couldn’t help but picture Tony kissing another Tony. Two Tonys, he thought hazily.
“How you holding up?” Natasha asked, still managing to startle him as she leaned against his armrest.
“Uh huh,” Tony cocked his head, disbelieving. “If that was all it was, you wouldn’t be embarrassed.”
“Tony,” Steve murmured, awestruck. “You’re perfect. I don’t need anything more than you. You are far better than anything I could have hoped for.”
Steve would sometimes catch his eye when one of his audio clips would play on the news, or when some blue-faced bible-thumping lunatic would spit out his name like a curse word. He would raise one perfect eyebrow, as if in disapproval, but Tony could see the smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
When Tony was done, he urged Steve to flip over, then settled so he sat on Steve’s thighs. He splayed his hands over Steve’s chest, cupping his pecs.
“Iron Man. This is Steve—Captain America. I wanted to check up on you, but Jarvis said you’re unavailable right now.” Steve tried not to let the concern overtake his voice.
Tony is relentless, he's chasing his own pleasure, he's making every thrust hit his prostate dead on, he's moaning and shaking around Steve but he's not letting Steve move an inch.
Iron Man had always fascinated Steve, of course. The armor was the first thing he drew after waking up. Its sleek curves and flashy power were attractive to him in a way he couldn’t quantify. Plus, Iron Man himself was a good man and a brilliant fighter. The snark merely put Steve over the edge into full-blown crush territory—he’d always had a thing for snarky, brilliant people.
Tony’s wide palms were skating across his back, up his neck to twist in his hair, then down to the small of his back. They mapped out his whole torso before they slipped lower, fingering the delicate seam of the lace panties, learning how the lace felt stretched around his body.
The drive back to the airport feels final, but comforting. They’re returning to real life, after all—a life with friends and jobs they enjoy and each other. Despite all the wonderful things they have seen, it still feels nice to be heading back to their landing place. Home, Tony supposes. The word feels nice to say.
That’s where the Iron Lover (Mk. I) came in. It wasn’t an Iron Man suit—it couldn’t fly, it had no guns or repulsors that worked. But it looked like the real deal. It was made out of the same alloy as his suits, and it even housed a very limited software program, which could follow voice commands and even replicate Tony’s voice as if he were inside of it.
They stayed there in the bathroom, Steve in Tony’s arms, the cold tile under his feet. Tony touched him until he’d calmed down. Steve suddenly felt silly for letting something as simple as a pair of panties affect him so much. But, as they turned to look in the mirror once more, and he took in Tony’s disheveled hair and slightly amazed expression, he let the self-recrimination fall away.
Tony sighed. He knew exactly where this was going. “I fly with the armor, with technology I created. My company hopes to release a commercial model of the flight tech next year. No weapons, of course. You can Google what happened to me—has someone shown you how to Google? Good. And no, I don’t like to show people my wings without the prosthetics.”
Steve wants to see the Everglades, and Tony wants to lay on a beach, so they make it to South Florida the next day. After a good night of rest, Tony begrudgingly follows Steve around a forest for a few hours, secretly enjoying Steve’s awed looks toward the sky. The trees were magnificent, but when they did finally make it to the beach once more, Tony finally had the chance to relax like he’d envisioned. It was so nice they took two days to move on.
Steve can feel Tony suddenly clench down like a vice around his oversensitive cock, he can feel Tony's thighs shake as his orgasm finally, finally courses through him
He could feel Tony’s shuddering exhale, almost a laugh, on the back of his neck. “I love how you take my knot, darling,” the Alpha crooned, stroking long fingers through Steve’s hair. “It’s like it’s the first time, every time. You get so overwhelmed. So sweet.”
“Trying and failing,” Steve mumbled as he pulled off briefly, his throat already scratchy. He licked a strip over Tony’s balls before sucking him back down.
“I’m uninjured. Tony, honey, are you sure everything is alright? I can skip the briefing and come straight home, I’ll be there in fifteen minutes.”
Finally, finally, Tony grabs Steve's wrists and moves his hands to his hips, and Steve latches on, feeling the silk of the nightgown brush against his hands, he's pretty sure he's gripping Tony hard enough to leave bruises but he knows Tony doesn't mind, he knows focusing everything into gripping Tony's hips will keep him from losing it, from trying to take control and chase his own pleasure
The silky thing Tony is wearing flutters across his legs, sensation teasing at him as Tony bobs his head
“I don’t think Steve would be interested in a quick fuck,” Natasha dismissed, “Otherwise I’d have told him to say something years ago.”
“You two are even creepier now that one of you can actually read minds,” Bruce commented from the other side of the sectional.
“Ngh, hello, gorgeous,” Tony moaned, letting his own pitch lower huskily. “What a surprise, getting to see you at work for personal reasons. I thought you had—mmm!—better compartmentalization than that.”
Steve felt himself contract helplessly around Tony, his body milking the thick come out of his cock like he was hungry for it. Tony pulsed and obliged, and Steve imagined he could feel the stream of come inside him, adding to the pressure. His prostate was pressed against Tony’s girth, and every hitch of breath and stutter of his hips brought them into shocking, brilliant contact.
Steve was whining and stroking himself still, his eyes shut tight against the messy scene before him, as if a single glance would push him over the edge. “Steve,” Tony called, his voice wrecked. “Steve, look at us.” When Steve met his eyes, gasping for breath, Tony looked him dead in the face and ordered, “Come now.”
and just when he thinks he can't take it any longer Tony pushes him back down onto the bed and straddles Steve's hip, using what's left of the lube on his hand to reach down and slick Steve up
Just the thought of being held by Tony in place, where he looked the way Tony wanted, where he was vulnerable to Tony’s wishes, it sped up his hips. He whined, and it must have sounded particularly pathetic, because a slow shushing came from behind him.
Bruce nodded sagely. “I am not invested in this conversation at all. I’m not attracted to faceless people in costumes.”
Tony withdrew more often as the weeks passed, to the point that he would miss mandatory Avengers meetings and debriefs just so he wouldn’t have to pretend not to stare longingly at Steve whenever they were both in a room together. The others clearly noticed, but blessedly said nothing.
“Can I check—” Steve asked, but before he could finish the thought aloud, his hands were already coming up to peel Tony’s tank top out of the way and feel at Tony’s bandages lightly. He brushed a palm across the gauze, feeling the heat from the wound, noticing that it wasn’t bleeding through. Tony’s skin was peppered with goosebumps—was he cold?—but otherwise he was clean, uninjured, and standing tall.
“Jesus, that is so hot.” Tony whined as Steve thrust again. His dick was half-hard but so unprepared for this onslaught. When he tried to shift away, Steve only tightened his grip of Tony’s hips, keeping him pinned to the wall and unable to escape the sensations.
he reaches a hand back to feel Tony pumping three fingers into himself, and it's wet and slick and so good
As Steve arrived on scene, he saw that Iron Man was right. The mechanical Octopus had been crashed onto the street, and the two with laser guns were being held onto by one gauntlet each. Iron Man was threatening them as Steve approached.
Finally the dam broke, and Tony rocked deep into Steve. The thrusts came hard and fast now, no more teasing, no more playing. Tony was thrusting down with such voracity that Steve had to wrap his legs around Tony’s waist and just hold on for the ride. He couldn’t keep from making obscene noises with every thrust.
They stayed like that for what felt like hours, Steve panting and trying to come back to earth, but then a tiny shift or an involuntary clench would send him careening into oversensitivity once more, and he would be able to do nothing but feel for unknown minutes. In the moments he was conscious enough to hear, Tony would be whispering dirty things into his ear, making him unable to ignore the raw, used way his ass felt, the huge knot still stretching him wide, keeping him right where Tony wanted.
Something niggled in the back of his mind, something he’d thought about before but ignored at the time. Something about how Iron Man acted when he was around Tony. Admittedly, Steve so rarely saw the two of them together.
“It feels…” Tony hummed thoughtfully, continuing to pet Steve’s arms. “It feels like flying, almost. I feel eye-catching and unrestrained. I feel feminine, like I’m this ethereal thing that can’t be tamed. I feel…”
Before he could take in any more detail, or even say hello, Steve had dropped the shield carelessly on the hardwood floor and, in two long strides, was pressed up to Tony’s side. He wrapped both his arms around Tony’s middle, shoving his nose into his hair.
Steve was an excellent deepthroater. He had an almost non-existent gag reflex and a tongue technique that could send someone to their grave. He utilized both these things to attempt to suck Tony’s brain out his dick, and mostly succeeded.
Steve moved fast once his mind was made up. He slammed Tony’s captured wrists into the wall above his head with one hand, grabbing onto the back of his neck with the other and pulling him into a harsh kiss. Their mouths clashed, then Steve overpowered Tony as he submitted, thrusting his tongue deep. Tony whimpered and flexed his arms, reveling in being unable to move, trapped where Steve wanted him.
A few times, Steve makes aborted movements towards him, as if he was going to pat Tony heartily on the back, or even touch his hair, maybe. Every time he stops himself before he does, and Tony holds his breath so Steve won’t hear his whine of rejection.
Tony shrugged and tossed a signature grin over his shoulder. Clint huffed and took his giant bucket of ice cream upstairs.
Steve did feel the slide of Tony’s palms from his knees to his shoulders, rubbing him down like an overworked horse. He must have been chanting Tony’s name out loud. “Yes, Tony,” he managed, then gave himself over to moans and gasps. Tony massaged the tension out of every muscle, turning him to a pile of jello.
only six thirty,” Steve whispers, crawling up Tony’s body to kiss him, come-and-morning-breath and all.
Steve was rutting against Tony’s leg, too far gone even to pull himself out of the complicated uniform and jerk off. He was speeding up, bobbing faster, letting Tony control his depth. Tony panted and tightened his grip, working Steve just how he liked it.
Tony crawled down his body, letting his chest rub against Steve’s as he went. He finally settled between Steve’s legs, stroking over his crack through the panties with one finger, letting his hot breath caress the pale skin of Steve’s thighs.
It was true–the deep, velvet-dark red of the panties against Steve’s pale peach skin was a glorious study in contrast. Steve’s molded hip bones would not be softened by the lace, but every other angle of his torso felt thrown in sharp relief against the curve of the panty seam. He was made delicate, made sensual, in a way he’d seen and admired in Tony, but never approached himself.
Tony didn’t believe what the superstitious people said about your wings linking you to some sort of metaphysical ‘soulmate’. There wasn’t any science, any logic behind their arguments. At the end of the day, Tony was a scientist. He didn’t believe in magic.
“I’m gonna ride you,” Steve tells him, and it sounds like a promise. “I’m gonna feel you so deep in me.”
Tony knows instantly—some people say it feels like fireworks, but for Tony, it feels like a balm, like aloe on sunburned skin. He immediately jolts back, away from the feeling. He tells himself it’s because now isn’t the the time to deal with it, they need to clean up and help survivors—but his heart pounds a staccato beat against the reactor, fast with anxiety.
Tony’s knot had never fully deflated, and it was growing again. Steve urged him on, meeting every thrust with his hips so Tony went as deep as possible. His prostate felt bruised; he didn’t care. All he wanted was the hot pressure of Tony’s knot filling him up once more.
Clint frowned, his eyes automatically scanning the room for Cap’s bulk. “I haven’t been around him much all week. Since the fight on Saturday.”
Weeks pass, and his insides want to claw out of his throat every time he sees Steve. He wants to talk to him, wants to touch him again, but Steve only smiles and says good morning, then turns back to his (actual, physical newsprint) paper. So Tony grunts a “morning,” back at him, and snags his coffee out of the kitchen as fast as he can, before he does something stupid.
“God, I am so lucky to have you. My gorgeous, gorgeous darling.” Tony was still clothed, but his cock hung out of the front of his pants, heavy and full. Steve imagined Tony stroking himself in time with Steve’s controlled thrusts and groaned again.
The blast caught Iron Man below the arc reactor, and he stumbled, clutching at the wound, before falling to his knees. Steve threw the two accomplices to the ground, and his shield was leaving his hand before he could process it, knocking the third unconscious. He ran to Iron Man’s side.
“Yes, Mr. Stark,” the armor agreed, and Steve’s reaction was perfect. His hips jerked, and his breath caught in his throat. “It—He can speak?”
Tony was pacing a hole in the workshop floor, trying his level best not to pluck all his down out. Dummy was trailing after him, picking up the glittering tufts of feathers as they fell when Tony didn’t manage to stop himself. It was embarrassing that he was letting something so trivial affect him so intensely, but it felt, it felt…
He was five, and his father had gotten out the old war bonds reels. It was dark in the parlor, the shades drawn. He was playing around with some batteries and wires from Howard’s scrap pile, ignoring the cloying smell of bourbon and cigar smoke.
