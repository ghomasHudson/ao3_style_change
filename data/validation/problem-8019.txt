emergencies?”
Tony shook himself and tried to get his thoughts in order. The thought of Cap saying anything remotely suggestive made Tony’s skin crawl. The man was basically a puritan.
“And that just outweighs what I did to him?” Steve’s stomach was churning. Clint shrugged, returning to his feast.
Steve could barely fathom it.
Steve licked his lips as a bead of clear liquid collected at the tip of Tony’s cock and he gave Tony a gentle stroke.
Steve considered it for a moment. Sparring with his teammates would most likely be a good way to clear his head. He must have been silent for a beat too long, because Natasha spoke again. “Hey, give it time, if you’re worried about the Stark thing. Get yourself some more experiences somewhere else. You’re not hideous.”
“I don’t know. I do have a few other emails from the service. I could check those out.”
“On the bed, on your hands and knees.”
After a minute or so, Tony’s hands settled, and he was still. Then, he turned and exited the room. It was only until after Steve heard the elevator doors open and close did Steve dare leave his position in the closet.
this, being held and trapped by a single hand and Steve’s hips.
Steve scanned Tony’s blushing face, his dilated pupils, his ragged breathing, and smiled. “Well, sweetheart, you play it off like you’re a blushing bride and it’s adorable.” Steve’s smile only grew wider when Tony’s blush burned brighter.
Tony noticed the tub was nearly half filled and looked to Steve with a furrowed brow. Steve smiled. “A bath sounds better than a shower right now, doesn’t it?” The question was rhetorical again.
“Oh god, don’t tell me a guy with your ass is straight.” Tony joked, and the thought of Tony checking out Steve’s ass made him blush furiously, but Steve powered through Tony’s charm.
It was not as if he had never hired an escort before. Tony had realized years ago that dating would be incredibly difficult with his lifestyle. He’d never hired a man before, though. He was happy to specify his preferences on the website (height, musculature, hair colour, etc.) but his anxiety was growing as the minutes ticked by, approaching the agreed time of 9:00pm.
Steve grinned when he saw Tony lick his lips. “Something big to stuff your big mouth with.”
wondered if Tony had followed his note to skip coffee this morning. And Tony
“Of course, sweetheart.” Steve answered immediately.
When he blinked away the small tears brimming his eyes, Steve was staring down at him with his mouth lax, cheeks red, hair damp around his face. Another hard push, eyes never leaving Tony’s.
Hello,
“Roll over.” Steve ordered. Tony was quick to comply, though a fleeting thought of Steve’s spunk leaking out of his hole ran through his mind. But Steve’s built chest, smooth skin, and pink cheeks were an excellent distraction.
) would dig in for themselves.
. Tony was watching as a glistening bead of precome collected on the tip of Steve’s cock. “…t, or you’ll get a tug. Understand? Tony, did you hear me?”
, Steve mentally repeated. He let himself be pulled in by their joined hands and Tony’s other hand situated itself at the base of Steve’s spine. “Can I offer you a glass of wine, Steve?”
Steve sighed and leaned on his elbows on the table, scrubbing his hands over his face. “What should I do in the meantime?”
Would Steve care, Tony wondered, that he followed Steve’s note about breakfast that morning? Ugh, Tony was embarrassed just from thinking that. He quickly tapped in an appointment request and tossed his phone somewhere on the bed to push his worries from his mind.
“I just, I… I got lost. I didn’t hear the rules. I’m sorry.”
TO: Steve Rogers 72091
The end of Tony’s leash was slid out of his hand. He heard fiddling and then the metal clip was undone on his collar. “Sit up for me, Tony.” Steve’s instruction was gentle. Tony’s body felt like it was moving through molasses, but he made it up and received a kiss on his cheek from Steve for his effort. Tony’s heart sang in his chest.
“The most important meal of the day, you know.”
The conversation was cut short by a cracking sound to their left and Steve’s breath was knocked out of his chest as Iron Man plucked him from his stance and down to the ground with a crash. Steve’s ears were ringing and in what seemed like a blink, the trees to the immediate south of them were collapsing, their leaves aflame. “Well, shit.” Iron Man’s voice boomed, the metal reverberating against Steve’s back. “We’ve got another incoming.”
“I’m not taking anything away, Tony, I am definitely happy to be here. I just… feel like I’m getting mixed signals.”
Steve used his right hand to carefully line up the head of his cock between Tony’s lips. He moaned low as he felt Tony’s hot breath. Tony’s tongue reached out to taste test. The strawberry was strong and mouth-watering. Steve slowly pushed into Tony’s mouth, fingers curling gently into the short curls at the back of Tony’s neck.
Tony followed the order once Steve gave a small tug on his leash. When Tony planted his second knee on the bed, Steve laid a swift slap on his right ass cheek. Tony let out a gasp and looked over his shoulder wordlessly at Steve as he continued to crawl to the center of the bed.
Tony whimpered, the sound ringing in Steve’s ears like music. “You like that, sweetheart?” Steve lifted his clean hand to cup Tony’s cheek. His thumb stroked gently before pushing into the corner of Tony’s mouth and without any more prompting, Tony turned towards Steve’s thumb and took it into his mouth to suck earnestly.
“Well, they’ve been pretty interested in the possibility of upgrading their deception screening tech to process live footage. And Stark tech is the superior developer, as we know.” She said smoothly, shooting him an encouraging wink.
“Sometimes.”
? Now, come on, eat another, you’re making me feel like I eat
Tony — seen right through his insanity and talked him through it. Tony remembered the feeling of being held in Steve’s strong arms, hushed and comforted, but not stifled. Not infantilized for his tears. Steve had changed the energy to sexual so quickly; Tony had crawled to the bedroom for him.
“It’s not like I’m a virgin,”
Tony yelped as Steve abandoned his slow pace and completely sheathed himself roughly inside. He pulled hard on his leash and crackled out a groan as his vision blurred for just a moment. He relaxed his hand and took a breath.
“Yeah, they—” They were suddenly careening towards the forest floor. Steve was pulled to the center of Iron Man’s chest and they rotated for the suit to take the brunt of the impact.
“You’re gorgeous.”
“Fu-uck me…”
hit Tony in his gut. He remembered Steve’s gentle hands when they bathed together. Tony had been floating high on hormones, stomach fluttering with every swipe of the soft cloth as Steve washed with him. It had been so intimate, and it hadn’t even made Tony’s skin crawl. The memory of Steve’s hands touching him in the water – caring and delicate – was in consummate opposition of other memories Tony had of water.

“You are in luck, good sir! A Corona, it is.” Tony placed the glass bottle on the bar in front of Steve before gathering tools to make a cocktail for himself. Steve took to opening the bottle and tasting the beer given to him. It tasted pretty fine, smoother than he expected it to be. He watched as Tony carefully mixed his martini and took a sip of his own once it was completed.
To his luck, it was past 1am and his only company was Clint who was transfixed in a movie, laid out on one of the couches.
TO: Tony Stark
Tony sighed and nuzzled his face against Steve’s neck, cheeks warm. “Is, is it weird if I don’t feel the need to be shirtless?”
Tony took a deep breath and he fought against his heavy eyelids to watch Steve take his own cock in his hand. Steve’s hands were lightly tanned, strong, with thick fingers. Tony remembered the weight and taste of them on his tongue and swallowed hard. One, two, three strokes, Steve looking down at Tony with a glint in his eye. Tony parted his lips, tried to find words while under the scrutiny of Steve’s gaze. “Please…”
“Colour.”
“Enjoying the view?” Steve teased, climbing onto the bed but not pulling up the sheets over his body. Tony licked his lips.
from CDC, and
“It’s not a relationship.”
“Yeah…” Tony sighed, “I have you for a bit longer, don’t I? Maybe you can give me the most wonderful of kindnesses and choke me on that cock of yours, put my voice out of commission for the day. Hell, for the week.” Before Steve could make a quip about keeping Tony tied to his bed for the week, he reminded himself of what he had to do. And before he could bite the bullet, he caught Tony’s soft eyes gazing up at him. “I,” Tony paused, “I had breakfast yesterday, and skipped my coffee.” Steve felt a rush of emotion flooding his brain, wrapping around his heart and squeezing. “Good boy,” he whispered, giving Tony’s hips a squeeze with the leg hooked over them.
“That’s it, sweetheart, get used to this.” Steve encouraged, and smiled at the small desperate squeak Tony let out around his cock. “You’re gonna be feelin’ me til next week.”
Steve let out a laugh and rubbed his brow. “You know what? Sure. I’ll have time to read about subspace and nipple play
The team were taken by helicopter north to the forest where the coordinates of the truck had last been recorded. “Okay, Widow and Hawkeye will go East, Iron Man can head West and patrol from overhead.”
Steve took a deep breath before kneeling by Iron Man. The helmet was dented, sparking erratically. Steve suspected it might be jammed shut. The breathing systems may be damaged as well. He brought his hands up to grip the panels by the edges of the helmet, tugging. There was resistance, but, with his full force, Steve was able to peel up the face plate to reveal the blood-covered face of his teammate, which he had never seen before.
“He seemed like a nice man!” Steve felt himself blush as he thought of where he should begin to recount the events of the night before. “Tony…
At that, Tony gave Steve a look. Steve looked to his feet. That was the freest he had spoken in a long time. “Come here,” Tony said softly.
Steve nodded. “Yes, I did. Would you like to show me your rope?”
“I do believe Miss Potts recommended communicating with Captain Rogers would be the best course of action in order to remedy the situation at hand.”
The excitement of stepping into Tony’s bedroom that night was distinct from every previous appointment. Steve’s stomach fluttered as he entered. The sight of Tony kneeling for him, eyes cast to the lush rug under his knees, was almost too much to bear.
Clint squinted, eyebrows furrowing in mock offence. “I can’t believe you learned how to sign ‘birdbrain,’ I might just refuse to eat with you.” He said.
“That feel good, baby? You want it?” Steve’s voice was low, weighing Tony down to the present. He nodded quickly. “Did I fuck the words out of your head? Where are your manners, sweetheart?”
In that moment, Tony felt a pang of fear. “Uh, no. Not yet.” He remembered Steve’s hand. It looked warm, soft, exciting. He settled his hand in Steve’s. He received a gentle squeeze over his fingers.
Steve smiled and replaced the pineapple lube in the drawer. He decided to make a show of applying the lube from the red bottle onto his hard cock, stroking it from the base to the head. When Tony licked his lips, Steve couldn’t stop himself from teasing, and trying to touch upon the request for humilation. “Something big to stuff your big mouth with.”
Tony seemed coy as he led Steve to the same couch that they had sat together on last night. Not shy or anxious, though; there was a small smile on his face that Steve couldn’t quite read as playful or persuasive.
Tony obeyed.
“Wait, hey! Not cool taking away my opportunity to get dicked down tonight out of the blue,” Tony whined, leaning forward and pressing a kiss against Steve’s neck.
He opened his eyes to look at his phone again. He still had his V.P. Escorts profile open, ready to request an evening with Steve, or, 72091. Tony absently wondered if Steve did freelance outside of the service. Certainly, a specimen like Steve would not have a hard time raking in some high-paying clients without the fees from the escort service cutting into his earnings.
Tony tried to think. If he said green, Steve would keep going. Steve would keep touching him, stroking his hair, holding his leash. But Tony hadn’t heard the rules. He could mess up, he could fail. He couldn’t bear that. Yellow, and Tony would be embarrassed, probably. He would have to ask Steve to explain again. It would even run the risk of Steve changing the game completely, and Tony really wanted Steve to stay where he was, with his hands where they were, holding and stroking and dangerous and safe. Red, and he could still be held. Right? He could still recover. This was a transaction. Steve wouldn’t just leave. Couldn’t. Right?
“Audio call, I suspect, Sir?” JARVIS was too sassy for his own good. Tony rolled his eyes as he gargled some mouthwash and provided a visual confirmation (
Silence. Steve pulled the sheets up over his lap, unsure if it would be acceptable for him to be hard again so quickly.
Steve snorted. “Don’t worry, I don’t have any to tell.”

about this. He felt his cock twitch as he realized he was bringing Tony into subspace with just kissing and dirty talk.
from the government of Canada website
Steve progressed slowly, watching for any twitch, any sign of discomfort from Tony. Steve’s cockhead began to press against the back of Tony’s throat and Steve could not resist from raising his right hand to lay across Tony’s throat. To see if he could feel it from the outside.
Steve shook his head. “Only since the crash in British Columbia, I swear.”
, Tony’s brain shorted out briefly. There was only the sound of Tony’s long yet shallow breaths.
“So…” Steve said. The appointment request included an overnight stay, but, did Tony actually
Tony groaned, squeezing his grip around his cock for a moment, before remembering his characteristic defiance and continuing to jerk himself off. “How’re y’gonna stop me?”
.” Iron Man spoke into the comms, into Steve’s ear. “
Tony looked nervous. “Did-Did you read the request form?”
Tony rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, his cheeks were hot, and he did not want to see that he was so pathetically hard again. But now that Steve had mentioned it, it was all Tony could think about.
Tony felt the urge to look away. Steve’s gaze was too deep. Too strong. But he was held by it. He pulled again.
Tony walked up to Steve’s bed and placed something onto the end of the mattress. He could not see what it was from that angle. Tony kept fiddling with it.
The meeting was brief for something that had been dodged for months; Tony had figured they would demand much more face time but he was grateful to end his day as soon as he could. He returned to his penthouse, already loosening his tie before the elevator doors opened.
This chapter includes Steve doing kink things with people other than Tony (cuz... escort work lol) So, if that ain't what you're here for, that's alright. But they aren't fleshed-out characters. I just wanted to have Steve get experience so that Tony and Steve's second appointment makes a bit more sense (Steve being confident and knowledgeable in kinky things, ya knowwww?)
“Green. So fucking green.”
“Are you going to see him again?” Natasha’s voice seemed uninterested, but Steve knew she enjoyed talking to him about this.
Tony fell typically quiet, eyes softly staring up at Steve as he chased his own release, reaching up to Steve’s chest to play with his pecs. Steve couldn’t stop himself from moaning, and Tony smiled. “Steve,” he whispered, and his own name rang in Steve’s ears, caught him off guard. “Come f’me, need it, fill me up…” Tony trailed off, eyes hazy, and Steve knew it took so much for Tony to get words out when he was floating in subspace. One more slow pull at his left nipple, a rushed kiss, and a final deep thrust had Steve spilling into Tony with a long moan.
. It’s a travesty.”
“Come on, Tony, I didn’t know until you just gave it away!
Eventually, they came to the end of the tour. Tony’s fingers found the neck of Steve’s beer bottle and gently took it from his hand. “I don’t have any art in my bedroom, but… would you like to see it?” Tony winked, and gestured to the closed door they had found themselves standing by.
SPEC REQUEST =   $500.00
, Sir.”
This is Steve's perspective of Tony and Steve's first appointment, his perspective of the evening, his thoughts, which may or may not align with what Tony was thinking that night.
Steve huffed a laugh, “Yes, that, thank you.”
Tony’s face went red and moved to turn into his shoulder, a growl and Steve’s other hand corrected him, cupping his chin and forcing him to look up at Steve.
to Steve.
Before Steve could dwell too much on how silly he felt uttering those words, Tony’s mouth was latched onto his right nipple. He sucked and licked, eyes closed. Steve moaned, grabbing Tony’s left wrist and guided him to his other nipple. “I know you can do better than that,” he teased, his voice low and gravelly, before Tony began to work Steve’s left nipple while he sucked the right. Sparks of electricity flashed through Steve, behind his eyes, through his nipples, and down to his dick.
He was rewarded with fingernails dragging up his back, his shoulders, then one hand tugging on the hair on the top of his head. Tony’s head was pulled up, back, throat stretched, exposed as he was pulled backward up to his knees. Steve’s chest was warm and fantastic against Tony’s back.

Steve raised his hand as he sat up. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll go shower. Lie down.”
“Oh?” Steve considered the rope he had seen in Tony’s gear dresser last night.
Tony couldn’t quite get words out still. He kept his comment to himself. He shrugged instead.
, Steve had a nice voice. “—so sweet and good like this, Tony.” His cheeks warmed at the thought,
, but the man placed his hand at the back of Steve’s neck and gently guided Steve to set his cheek on his clothed thigh. The suit pants were soft, smooth, of high quality and value. Steve closed his eyes as the man’s left hand remained on Steve’s hair, petting idly, while his right hand went to work on papers on the desk’s surface.
“Okay, Tony, you ready?”
“P-please, fuck, Steve—”

Tony gasped and whined, suddenly restless and out of rhythm. He turned his cheek and pressed it against Steve’s chest. “Captain, Sir, please, ah-”
“Colour?”
Steve watched Tony carefully. His eyes had opened again. Tony’s wrists pulled at Steve’s hold, but Steve kept his grip steady. Tony let out a satiated sigh and settled once again. Steve felt something flux and flip in his gut at that. Tony was
Tony gave a small affirmative huff and Steve popped the plastic container into the microwave. With the buzzing of the appliance running as ambience, Steve stepped over to Tony slumped over the table and quietly placed his hand on Tony’s shoulder. He made no movement, so Steve kept his hand there.
“I’ll be happy enough when these Lightman people are done with. I’m tired of dodging them.”
Tony chuckled when they broke away from their kiss, shaking his head. “Oh, god no. I’ve been doing this a long time.”
Steve let out a weak laugh. “Alright, I, um—do you have a collar you’d like to wear for me tonight?” Tony’s breath came out with an intrigued hum and nodded.
Tony whined at the words, rolling his hips down against Steve’s body. Steve could feel Tony’s erection growing and he could not deny his own, swelling steadily pressed against Tony. He squeezed Tony’s ass cheek once again, pulling Tony down and rubbing their clothed erections together.
Tony let go just as his vision went white, then black.
The doors opened to the penthouse and Tony, ever the gentleman, was there to greet Steve. He wore a stunning suit, probably more expensive than all of Steve’s clothes combined. His hair was styled to perfection and Steve wanted nothing more than to ruffle this man to tatters and put him back together again.
“Iron Man down. Are his coordinates still being relayed?”
Time is a construct.
couldn’t focus. He opened his eyes, and saw Steve staring down at him, waiting. Expecting Tony to answer. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry—I can’t—”
“I’m—yes, Steve,
“Okay,” Steve finally said, softly, eyes warm and calm again. “So how would you like to proceed with the— the, um…”
you’d have extended that to verbal access for info other than Iron Man’s identity. Thanks, pal.”
Tony’s fist sped up over his erection, gasping and sputtering nonsense syllables when Steve’s fingers pressed at his prostate. Tony’s eyes gazed up Steve’s bare chest, slim waist and beautiful broad shoulders, and found Steve grinning down at him. Before Tony could demand to know what was so funny, Steve spoke.
“Good,” Steve said gruffly, “I wouldn’t want to put my dick in something less than pristine.” Steve placed both hands on Tony’s hips firmly to keep Tony stationary, face to face with him. “I’d have to scrub you down from top to bottom, every nook.” Steve’s right hand curled around Tony’s left ass cheek, fingertips brushing against his dry hole, clean, soft and perfect just as it was yesterday. “‘Yes’ is your final answer, Stark?”
At Steve’s beat of silence, Tony knew. He let out a pained laugh. “Fuck, I’m such an idiot.”
His sleepy haze was broken when his fingers found soft locks of hair. He took a deep breath as
The only thing that tore Tony away from what was in his hands was a flash overhead on the screens. A new email from V.P. Escorts.

Steve manually turned on the showerhead, bringing it to a soothing warm temperature before instructing Tony to step under the spray. “I’ll have to clean you myself.” Steve said, feeling silly as he pushed along this narrative, but Tony’s face was red, his pupils wide, and Steve felt assured he was doing well.
It was a few seconds of near silence, Tony’s breath shuddering. Steve listened to it intently, his left hand, still with the end of the leather leash wrapped around his knuckles, laid gently between Tony’s shoulder blades.
“Tony,” Steve tried to chastise him, but it was weak. “I didn’t know what to expect the first time we… had an appointment. But, it’s become a lot bigger and messier and more fantastic than I ever dreamed.”
“I’d like to think we’ve been having one hell of a getting-together story to tell friends.”
?” Steve crossed his arms over his chest, glaring down at Tony. He’d never glared
he’d said. Tony groaned and dragged one hand down his face. He had been so excited to be praised, hoping to be special and rewarded for following Steve’s instructions. Maybe he had still been in subspace. Yeah, that would explain it. Any sub would crave affection and praise after doing a good job, being good. And Tony had been

“What do you want to do?” Steve asked, hands and eyes still waiting.
The evening carried on an air of playfulness as they moved to the kitchen where Steve agreed to be fed a ridiculously small amount that Tony would have thought a man of Steve’s size (6’2”? No, he must be at least 6’4”!) would want.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony could have purred when he felt Steve’s warmth curl around him, and the lights faded in the bedroom.
He exited the email app and closed his eyes for a moment, needing to clear his head.
“Did I tell you to stop, Stark?” Steve’s grip slid from Tony’s shaft down to his balls, a hint of a threat. Tony whimpered, hot breath rushing down the valley between Steve’s pecs. Before he could get his mouth back on Steve, he was pushed back down onto the mattress, Captain America’s body looming over his.
Tony was hunkered down on his workshop floor, skin covered in oil and sweat, stomach running low on patience and DUM-E standing by threateningly with the emergency water hose to hydrate Tony if JARVIS deemed it necessary. Had Tony only been more caught up on sleep and nourishment, he might have noticed what his creations had been up to, but Tony wasn’t, so Tony didn’t.
Steve hummed through a moan, rolling them both over. He gathered both Tony’s wrists in one hand, pressing them against the mattress above Tony’s head. He rolled his hips down against Tony’s to hear him groan again.
“So is this punctuality anything to do with your scheduled blackout last night?” Pepper asked, unprompted and correct as always.
Tony let his mind wander to the previous night. Steve had been so good to him; held him down, tied him up, talked him into subspace so easily. Tony felt unbelievably relaxed around Steve. Tony had had such an intense orgasm he had passed out, and came to with Steve still inside of him, fucking him hard and
“Hands over your head, sweetheart. Hold the headboard.” Steve’s heart fluttered when Tony obeyed, eyes watching Steve carefully as he gripped the top bar of the wooden headboard behind him. “Good boy.”
“Wait, what?” Tony mumbled around his food, but Clint couldn’t hear him.
“So…” Tony echoed.
– Client Request –
Tony laughed, shaking his head. “Oh, god no. I’ve been doing this a long time.”
He peeked through into the room. The queen size bed was neatly made and the room looked tidy and untouched aside from a small picture frame set up on the nightstand. “Captain?” Tony felt strange saying that title outside of his armour, for some reason.
“You’re improving.” Clint signed, still grinning at Tony’s frustration. “Give me the wings.”
“I thought Clint was here.” Tony's voice was rough but coherent, allowing Steve to worry just a bit less about Tony’s state.
“Actually, first I’d like for us to have a little chat. Let’s sit.”
“That’s better,” Steve remarked, feeling more at ease as Tony seemed pleased. “After this, I’ll have you beg to be on Captain America’s cock.”
Client language(s): English, Italian, French, German, Russian
Tony complied, mouth coming up to Steve’s pecs and his eyes wide and fixed on them. “Be a good soldier and show Captain America how much you appreciate my service.”
“You need to get laid.” Natasha said at some point as they were huddled together for warmth in an abandoned apartment complex, a few blocks away from a target’s last reported location.
“I want to keep you safe, Tony. Not only as Captain America, but as Steve Rogers too. I want to know you and I want you to know me…” When Steve was only met with silence, Tony’s body so still in his arms, his heart pounding in his own ears. “So you deserve the truth.”
Tony’s mind was hazy, at once a blur of a thousand buzzing ideas and yet overwhelmed with warmth, pleasure, and need, and all by Steve’s hands. He whimpered around the fingers in his mouth, sucking and licking. “So fucking desperate, what a good slut, you need to be filled up in both your holes. One isn’t good enough, is it?” Tony could only whimper, a sobbing moan, as Steve whispered filth into his ear.
“So, if I need to get laid, I don’t necessarily need a date. That’s the trouble, you know… Hard to find someone if I’m not supposed to exist.”
“God your hole is so hungry for it,” Steve growled, “I could make you come on just my fingers, couldn’t I? So desperate for something inside you, you’d take anything, isn’t that right?”
Thankfully, Steve did not settle on Tony’s chest to hold him. He rolled to the side and propped himself up on one elbow to stroke Tony’s hair. Tony did
It felt good. To be overpowered and taught his place. Steve’s large warm hands pushing him around felt exciting and safe all at once. There was nothing but the sound of a drawer sliding open, then closed, then Tony felt Steve’s knee against his side on the bed. “Chin up,” Steve said, firmly patting Tony’s cheek, getting Tony to bend his neck back, chin up off the bed.

“Ugh, you’re so lucky you’re hot… Please!”
“Yeah…” Tony breathed.

Webs of colour clouded Tony’s vision as he returned to alertness. Steve was still pumping in and out of him, and Tony hummed in satisfaction. Steve smiled down at him, pleased that Tony’s eyes were open again. “You made a mess of yourself, sweetheart. Didn’t think you’d come from just that. You look gorgeous, sticky and spent.” Tony groaned, looking down at his chest. Stripes of white along his stomach. His head felt hazy and pleasant. “You love being used like this, huh? Your cock making a good effort to go again, to come on my cock.”
did Tony need for Steve to rip off Tony’s shirt and bite his neck, his shoulders, to play with his nipples and pull his hair. Tony palmed himself through his jeans. He was still standing in the middle of his workshop.
The tiles were cold on the palms of Tony’s hands, but at least his suit shielded his knees enough. Tony was still thankful that the distance from the kitchen to the bedroom was short. Steve walked in stride by Tony as he crawled, watching Steve’s feet.
“Do you want me to leave?” Steve asked, when all he wanted to do was feed, water, and care for this wobbly man.
He gave Tony’s cock a firm slick stroke before taking his own in hand to line himself up. Tony’s groan was wordless and breathy, watching Steve with wide eyes, pupils blown and hazy. Steve paused and trained his expression away from the grin fighting to show, “Say it.”
Steve shrunk into himself, eyes cast down to Tony’s vacant pillow. He listened to Tony angrily shuffling around the suite to get ready, desperately trying to remember what he planned on saying to convince Tony to not completely write him off as a scumbag who manipulated his team mate (his subordinate officer, if they were to be formal about this) into having relations with him. Steve’s heart hammered in his chest as he thought of what Tony must think of him. He had never meant for them to get so entangled, and had never anticipated feeling so strongly for this man. He could blame Natasha for encouraging him, but none of this was because of her. Steve pushed this too far and he knew it.
“And I want to give you everything. I spend my days thinking of how to treat you next time I see you, how you might like it if I do this, or do that…”
Natasha had just shaken her head. “Not
Once Steve removed and folded his clothes and set them aside, he turned to see Tony watching him intently. “Hands on the tiles.” Steve grabbed Tony’s shoulders again, spinning and maneuvering him until he was positioned how Steve wanted him to be-- hands supporting Tony as he bent forward, shoulders under the majority of the water, trickling down his back and buttocks, where Steve could have easy access to do as he pleased.
It is absolutely not fair that Tony was made to blush at that.

After a minute or so, Steve gently introduced a second finger. Steve was focusing intently, searching for Tony’s prostate. He needed this to be good for Tony.
,” Tony groaned, before the suit dissembled and freed his limbs from their metal encasement. Steve jumped back when this happened, but he watched carefully for any injuries on Tony’s body. The black undersuit was short-sleeved and the collar of the shirt was low enough to expose a purplish strip curved across the front of Tony’s throat. Steve’s breath hitched and his mind was reeling. Tony was marked up because of
“This doesn’t seem like something that needs straightening.”
Natasha grinned as Steve followed her to the elevator.
He sighed. “He hates me.”
“Yeah?”
Steve followed the man on slightly wobbly legs, and he was surprised at himself. When they reached the man’s office, Steve was put to his knees by the man’s thigh at his desk chair. Steve half-expected the man to demand that Steve provide him with oral sex, although no sexual activity was requested that night, but Steve would not be opposed. The client’s face was kind and open, though worn from stress and age. Steve felt safe with him.
Tony emerged from the en suite bathroom, rousing Steve from his stressful train of thought. He was wearing a three-piece suit now, perhaps he discarded his tee-shirt while Steve was distracted. Tony looked absolutely stunning, even as he glared at the bed, avoiding Steve’s eyes.
Tony rolled his eyes, handing over the small cardboard box. “Of course you want the wings, birdbrain.”
They stayed that way for a while; Steve was on his elbows and knees over Tony, kissing and sucking and biting at the smooth skin over Tony’s shoulder. When Steve next spoke, his voice was gentle and earnest. His stream of praises flowed through Tony’s ears and his mind quieted. He wanted to just enjoy as the soft sound of Steve’s voice washed over him. Tony 's eyes fell shut as he drifted in and out of awareness, floating on the border of subspace. “You’re so far under, sweetheart.”
“I should’ve had you strip first, would’ve been a sight.” Steve’s voice was low, and Tony’s blush grew. Steve opened the bedroom door for Tony when they halted in front of it. “Undress and kneel by the bed.”
Tony stretched out his limbs across the mattress before picking himself up off the bed. He gathered a set of silk pajamas from his closet before heading to the en suite bathroom.
Steve hummed with approval. “I’d love to see you crawl.” Tony let out a whimper. “Take another bite.”
“You have to learn the everyday phrases if you’re gonna learn any language.” Tony signed that with surprising speed, inwardly proud of himself in that moment. He took a slice of the meat lovers pizza and bit into it cold.
Then his left hand was being plucked from the bedsheets and felt a leather strap being pressed into his palm. “You control your breathing, sweetheart. And keep yourself in check, no touching your cock.”
Steve took a quivering breath at the sight, imagining what it would be like to have that fantastic hot mouth on his cock. “Hold on, baby, the main course is still coming.” Steve teased again, pulling his thumb out of Tony’s talented mouth. He moved his hand down to support Tony’s head.
whimper when Steve pulled out and coaxed Tony’s knees down. He climbed over Tony’s body to straddle Tony’s chest.
It took Tony a moment to find his voice again. “
Steve to share his bed?
“You didn’t specify online, is kissing good?” Steve asked, blinking away his anxiety. Tony nodded quickly. Steve smiled and slid his grip on Tony’s hand to his wrist before pulling him in for a kiss.
Steve dropped the towel and gripped Tony’s face in his hands, tilting his head back. Tony’s eyelashes were wet, eyes blown. He was beautiful like this.
What did you
Steve had been provided with a leather collar at the start of that evening. The client had requested submission in relative silence, words from Steve to only be
Steve huffed, victorious. He withdrew his fingers and Tony’s mouth opened again, in protest, before he felt the head of Steve’s cock press against his hole. Just the head, pressing so deliciously against his sensitive slick spot.
Tony looked up at Steve, eyes wide. “Tell me.”
With previous partners, Tony relied on alcohol to explain away his rush to get the vital clothing items out of the way to do the deed. With Pepper, though, and now Steve, it was difficult to get away with just stripping below the waist. Steve and Tony had yet to
Anywho. who knew that getting a bachelors degree would take up so much time? I'm hoping to get another chapter out during reading week (like mid-October) but who knows.
Shorter than intended.
“You want me to rough you up,” Steve did not ask. He knew already.
Because he could not resist, Steve began his massage at Tony’s ass. Partly because Tony gave a surprised jolt as the first touch of soapy warm hands, mostly because Steve loved Tony’s ass. He worked his way up Tony’s back, scratching with his fingernails and immediately soothing with his palms. When he reached Tony’s sides, Steve felt mischievous glee fill him when Tony shivered and wriggled, feet shuffling and head ducking between his outstretched arms.

“Your turn.” Tony said, setting the clean towel next to Steve’s hip.
Natasha shrugged, a quiet grin still on her face. Steve liked seeing her happy. “Alright. Well, Clint and I are meeting in the gym soon.” She stood from her seat, still eyeing Steve. “Do you want to come?”
“Look at you,” Steve cooed meanly, “so easy to take and use. I’d like to keep you.” It was startling how easy those words came to him, looking down at Tony and seeing the trust in his soft gaze. Tony whimpered a moan, eyebrows furrowed as he lifted his wrists limply towards Steve, whose insides fluttered at the sight of Tony giving everything to him without a second thought.

“I—Yellow.”
Tony smiled. He seemed to be delighted about Steve’s curiosity, and insisted on providing Steve a tour of his penthouse to see the rest of the art hanging on the walls. They were beautiful. Steve rarely had the opportunity to admire art when he was young. He spent most of his childhood in bed, entertaining himself with crayons and drawing portraits of Bucky when he came over to visit when Steve had been too sick to come out.
Tony plucked and rubbed at his nipples, staring up at Steve’s face, his body looming over him, between his thighs, splayed wide. Steve’s rumbling moan encouraged him, gave him the courage to push up with his shoulders that extra inch to silently ask for a kiss, his wordless whimpers notwithstanding.
Tony’s eyebrows quirked and he chuckled. “You’ve got a point.”
“Would you like to lead me to the bedroom, then?” Tony nodded again. Steve’s hand in his hair tightened momentarily before releasing and stroking down Tony’s neck. “Crawl for me.”
End of content warning.
Steve pinched the shell of Tony’s ear with his teeth, a teasing tug before releasing and lifting his body from Tony’s back. Tony moaned, in both pleasure and displeasure—he adored the weight of Steve’s body and the not-so-subtle erection that was returning to full hardness again inside Tony’s ass until Steve was selfish enough to pull out.
Steve lifted Tony’s hips with ease to tug his pants and boxers down. Tony’s cock bobbed freely, hard and dark red from waiting. Steve’s warm fingers wrapped around the base, his hands were so large only the head was exposed above his grip. A small whimper escaped Tony’s lips at the touch, his hips jerked up. Steve made himself comfortable between Tony’s legs, spreading the brunet’s knees and running his left hand along Tony’s inner thigh. Tony shivered at the touch.
Steve took a pause, he didn’t know how to answer that. Was this Tony flirting or Tony hiring him privately? He could hear Tony’s heart pounding, he had to mean it. He had to… want Steve. Steve was screwed. “Tony,” he said, “I think I need to straighten something out before we—”
Steve hummed, thinking. Thinking? Was he not into it? Obviously, he wasn’t into it, that’s so fucking sketchy, Tony shouldn’t have asked—it’s not too late to take it back, he could just say he changed his mind! He—

“Please, what?”
His time was up. “See, if you don’t have an answer, it’s been too long. If you don’t find someone, I’ll find someone
Which he had never expected to see… and
“You’ve been spying on him?” Steve pried, blush rising on his cheeks.
Fury seemed to be out of patience, and Hill spoke up. “A wanted criminal in the hold, the evidence of his latest crimes in the front cab with the driver.”
Steve blushed. He was about to huff about the unrealistic expectations about ‘Captain America attitude’ that had built up around his code name, when his phone pinged.
“Colour?” Steve’s voice demanded.
He slid into the bed behind Tony quietly, hands finding their places. One in Tony’s soft damp hair, and the other on Tony’s waist, fingers curled to stroke his belly. Tony was exhausted, face buried in his pillow already.
Steve’s eyes were doing the thing that Tony knew well. He could see Steve’s mind reeling, taking on this new information and trying to make a home for it in his brain. Tony was preparing for rejection in any case, or a protest, or for Steve to say that
Tony felt a fresh rush of heat in his cheeks again and he opened his eyes wide again, watching Steve’s expression. The blonde’s gaze was steady, eyes warm like his voice, lips soft, grip on Tony’s wrists hard as he wriggled them to test Steve. He sighed happily as he was still trapped by the man’s large hand.

Y’know how it is, I don’t usually sleep longer than 3 hours a night, I was totally disoriented that morning. Who knows—? Whatever, we can even just do what we did last time? Tour of my collection and everything! It’s different food, though, so maybe we can just skip that part and head straight to showing you my—”
“Sounds like fun. Want me to help you study?” The glee in Natasha’s voice was unmistakable and Steve had to look up at her face.
He took another sip and tisked when his glass was empty. He stood to make another. He wanted to make two for the sake of efficiency but there was that razor-thin line between efficiency and alcoholism and Tony wanted to avoid that train of thought. He sat down again on his couch and looked down at the spot where Steve had coddled him the past two nights.
“P-please.” Tony stammered, opening his eyes again. Steve smiled when their gazes met.
Tony felt heat collecting inside his gut, his cock throbbing in his hand as his head swam in thoughts of Steve. His hands, his chest, his dominating energy that brought Tony to his knees and made him only want to please Steve.
“Or… I could make you really sure who you belong to tonight.” Just tonight, Steve reminded himself. It would just be tonight. One more night.
“The elevator shall escort you up to Master Stark’s private level. Enjoy your evening.” Steve tried not to read too much into the certain
A passing thought had Steve wonder,
“... J, care to tell me why you didn’t brief me on the dear Captain’s identity?”
Tony flinched when JARVIS suddenly spoke. “The Avengers have returned to the tower, Sir.” Tony dropped his hand, mood ruined. He groaned unhappily as he glanced over towards his bedroom door, open to the rest of his living space.
“Oh my god, Steve,
Tony gave an offended look to Steve when he removed Tony’s hands from his thighs and pulled out of Tony’s mouth. He pulled Tony’s shoulders up and nudged him to the center of the bed, setting his head on one of the lush pillows.
Steve stood and went to retrieve a takeout container from the refrigerator. “I did, Tony. You’re a very good host. Pilaf okay?”

At Steve’s panicked expression, Natasha gave in and patted his shoulder. “Not since before the Avengers came into existence,” she said. Steve let out a relieved breath and nodded tightly. “He’s not one to change his ways for just anyone, Steve. He’ll get over this, I know it.”

“Well, sweetheart, you play it off like you’re a blushing bride and it’s adorable.”
After a minute of tinkering with the torso piece of the suit and talking aloud with JARVIS, the suit then folded in on itself and arranged itself into a carrying case. Only then did Tony turn his attention to Steve.
SUBJECT: Escort Service Request Update
Tony shrugged. “Cuddling?” He worked hard to develop this leveled tone for when he asked to cuddle with his escorts.
Nope. Fall back.
Tony slid to his knees onto the kitchen tile, a blush growing on his cheeks as he avoided Steve’s gaze. He had an urge to nuzzle Steve’s thigh, but he had a task.
He unwrapped his bonds, gently smoothing his palms over Tony’s muscles, feeling for temperature and getting massaging. “Sit up for me,” he whispered, guiding Tony up and off the bed, and to the bathroom for them to clean up.
“He and Natasha just left,” Steve offered and Tony nodded solemnly, eyes lowering to the table where his hand had reached for stability. Steve watched him carefully, praying that this could be an opportunity for him to show Tony he could be trusted, that they could still be something. He had to wait for Tony, though; Natasha was always right.
Steve’s second client was quite a different experience from what Tony had been. The man requested that Steve spank him and have him call Steve “Daddy” while Steve fucked him (which… surprisingly, Steve found himself quite amenable to…). Steve was becoming more familiar with the limits to put on his strength in the bedroom. He enjoyed the use of safeword check-ins, particularly during the spanking, as he was not sure how softly to begin with, considering his enhanced strength.
After a moment of bathing in the haze of Steve’s weighted warmth, Tony’s focus was drawn again by his erection, pinned between his stomach and the mattress. He attempted to wriggle, to get some friction and relief, but Steve’s body kept him from moving.
Steve was led into the kitchen to be offered a series of different food options. There were finger foods with unfamiliar names from different languages, featuring different meats and different preparations. Steve felt embarrassed but he could not resist the mini cheeseburgers sitting in the center of the table. “Sorry, I guess I’m a man of simple tastes.”
“Good.”
Tony’s eyes opened as he swallowed. “Red.”
Sex Workers Protections Act
Tony complied, carefully unfolding himself and coming to full height, his nose level with Steve’s lips. Steve found himself tempted to plant a kiss, but refrained. Instead, he grabbed Tony by the shoulders, pushing and pulling to have him turn in his place. As Tony slowly shuffled and spun, already seemed to be slipping down into the soft space he looked so beautiful in, Steve looked his fill. The bite marks on Tony’s shoulders had disappeared since the previous night but the front of his neck was bluish-purple from the tug of Tony’s collar.
The bedroom. Tony Stark’s bedroom.

, but this is what Steve had thought to do.
“Steve, why in- oh jesus, calling you Steve is weird now, how did you make this weird?” Tony roughly put on a tee shirt before realizing he had to be dressed for that meeting with the Lightman Group. He left it on out of sheer petulance.
Suddenly, Steve realized he did
One hand found the top button on Tony’s dress shirt and Tony’s breath hitched. He grabbed Steve’s wrist and shook his head. Steve wordlessly lowered his hand to Tony’s belt buckle instead.
Steve pressed his open hands against his red cheeks, shaking his head to himself. He shouldn’t be thinking these things. Tony was… Tony was special to him.
He moved on to Tony’s belt, and looked at Tony for any discomfort. “Your poor cock has been ignored all night.” Steve began to unbuckle Tony’s belt and unzip his fly. He laid his palm on Tony’s erection, still held tight in his boxers. “You have been such a good cockslut, let’s give it a little reward, shall we?”
you.”
“Say it, Tony. Tell me what you want.” Steve ordered again.
“What’re we having?” Clint asked, palms up.
“You have a beautiful home.” The man began, smiling at Tony with all the charm of a boy scout. He held out an open palm. “My name is Steve.”
Dress Code: [n/a]
Steve was not convinced. “I’m going to need some incentive.” He teased, voice purring straight into Tony’s ear. God, Tony could have shot his load right then, Steve’s voice was perfect, dominant, playful, and sexy. So fucking sexy.
At that, Tony moaned around his fingers, increasing his efforts and meeting Steve’s thrusts, pursing his lips over his teeth and sticking out his tongue along the length of Steve’s fingers as far as it could reach.
Steve’s hands lowered to Tony’s torso, keeping their bodies together flush. His hands did not touch the arc reactor, respectfully, thoughtfully. Even in the mess of sex, he was still such a gentleman. Tony groaned, in frustration and arousal.
... unsure. He was certain that the agency would follow his instructions, as they had never let him down before, but he wasn’t sure what he might do with a man for the evening. Would they laugh at Tony if he offered dinner? Wine on the couch? Conversation?
How could Tony argue with that tone of voice?
Tony couldn’t stop the whimper that escaped his throat against his will. “You like that, sweetheart?” Steve’s left (dry) hand reached out to cup Tony’s stubbled cheek. His thumb crooked into the corner of Tony’s mouth and Tony turned into the pull, sucking like his life depended on it.
SPEC REQUEST =   $750.00
Steve shrugged. He tried not to think back to the
Activities in the bedroom would depend on the company and Tony’s requests that evening. Sometimes he felt like bondage, or pegging, or whatever Tony’s guest picks out of his drawer of toys.
Tony was so tempted to schedule another appointment with Steve, but, as a screen lit up to announce that Pepper had left 15 voicemails after 46 missed calls, Tony thought he had more pressing matters to attend to.
“Do you like being a good boy?” Steve’s question was rhetorical, mostly. Tony looked at peace being held by the hair, eyes closed, chewing obediently between answers. “I bet you’d love being my good boy. You’d kneel and beg for me, waiting to be used by my fingers, filled with my cock. What’s your safeword, sweetheart?”
As he stepped back out to his bedroom, towel wrapped tightly around his hips, Steve picked up his cell phone to look through the request list for tonight. He hummed, scrolling through the items with his thumb, and his other hand clutching his cotton towel.
Tony shrugged. “It’s still food.”
Steve was very intent on being able to seamlessly engage in conversation with people. He did not want to be caught clueless about something that was common knowledge to everyone else in the room with him. He researched popular books, famous figures, movies, music, and one night he found himself researching major laws that had been passed while he was—while he was asleep.
FROM: V.P. Escorts
“Brat,” Steve repeated, a soft smile playing on his mouth.
“Wha-?” Tony huffed breathlessly against Steve’s mouth, opening his eyes to look quizzically into Steve’s bright blues.
It was nearing the arranged time of 9:00pm, and Steve politely asked JARVIS to inform Tony that his guest from V.P. Escorts had arrived. Luckily, the AI seemed to not to be suspicious of that.
. The heat rushing through him because of that realization should not have been so satisfying. Steve wondered if his bites had left marks on Tony’s shoulders as well. Sadly, Tony was not about to undress to show him. Other than the wound on Tony's head, currently obscured by his dark hair, he seemed to be relatively uninjured.
, please, pretty please—”
hours early. You’re in before me and your secretary.”
Steve raked his fingernails down Tony’s asscheeks, making them sting perfectly. Tony squirmed under the touch, and Steve gave another slap to Tony’s right cheek. He squeezed the warming flesh with both hands and spread the cheeks, exposing Tony’s hole.
“It was… good?”
Steve’s warm hands wrapped thick leather around Tony’s neck, fastening it smoothly before pushing his head back down against the mattress. Tony may have felt embarrassed by the gutted moan he let out had he been more lucid, but at this point he was floating peacefully, contentedly.
“And how exactly would you have been
“Uh-huh…” Natasha was listening, but also watching as a couple of teenagers entered the shop. She looked idly suspicious of their presence. Steve wondered how expensive the shirts were that Natasha was having him carry.
Steve’s fingers slowly pumped in and out, getting Tony loose enough to take Steve’s dick again. Tony remembered the burn of the stretch around Steve’s size the night before. It was so fantastic.
After a few minutes, Tony spoke. “Do you want the first shower?”
“Tony, I don’t mind if you’re seeing someone, you don’t need to keep it a secret.” She said, giving him a smile that sliced into him more than he could have anticipated. Tony let out a gutted chuckle.
Steve watched Tony carefully, pretending that he could not feel his heart pounding in his throat. “Your first time?” Steve asked, kissing Tony at the first chance he had when Tony climbed over him slowly.
Tony tapped impatiently on his phone while he waited for this evening’s entertainment to arrive. He was willing himself not to get too absorbed in any design schematics or SI documents Pepper had been prodding him about.  He wanted to be relaxed.
He hummed, though, as he visualized Tony again, imagined what he would look like if Steve did
The elevator came to a stop, and the doors opened to reveal a smartly dressed Tony Stark standing by to greet him. Steve suddenly felt incredibly exposed, particularly because he could feel Stark’s eyes roaming over his body. The evening’s purpose became very real.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Take me to bed?”
Soon Steve’s thrusts became erratic, uneven, pushing in deep and slow. “I’m close, sweetheart. You feel so good. Come on, Tony, come for me, baby.” Tony’s mind was in a lusting haze again, He felt Steve’s hand slide between them to stroke his cock and he lost himself in the sensation of heat and tension building in his gut.
Just as he was reaching down towards the zip of his jeans, he felt a vibration from his pocket.
“You jealous? Maybe next time I’ll lend you some, but since I paid for the overnight, I’ll get my money’s worth of your ridiculous body.” Tony meant to be playful, but it sounded more crude than anything. He would have never said that if it were a woman laying on his bed.
Steve’s strength had been something he still needed to get accustomed to in civilian life. He exhausted himself on the punching bags in the SHIELD gymnasium, spending hours alone with his thoughts.
Steve made quick work of tying Tony’s ankles to his thighs, wrapping wide bands of rope for easy handling. Tony’s mind was fuzzy, but it registered once Steve
Tony remembered his hand still on his cock and gave it a gentle stroke. He brought his free hand up to touch his neck, where the bruises from his collar were left.

“Fuck,” Steve rolled his hips down against Tony’s, their cocks rubbing together. “What a fucking slut you are, you’ll take it any way you can get it. Let’s see, darling, if you can come while I’m fucking you, choking you, hard and fast, then you can come. Once I’m done, you’ve lost your chance. Understand?”
Then, a terrifying thought arose: Cap
“Hello?”
“Please do not ask me about any more sexual acts.” Natasha spoke solemnly, as if willing herself to be calm in the face of adversity.
Tony nodded vacantly to Pepper’s voice, the words on the page blurring, and his mind flitting away, back to that morning. He fought the grinding urge to hide his head into his hands in front of Pepper; she already read him like a book, she did not need any hints about his latest personal catastrophe.
Tony looked at the cowl, straightening it up and presenting it more neatly at the middle of the end of the mattress. He had scrubbed away his blood as best as he could, hoping that Cap would notice the effort and give him the benefit of the doubt before reporting Tony to Fury and getting Tony kicked off the team for his negligence.
Tony seemed keen on Steve touching him. His breathing picked up; his lips parted as he averted his eyes down to where Steve’s hand sat mid-thigh. “Sorry to be negotiating this last-minute,” his voice was soft. “but I think it’s pretty similar to what we’ve done before.”
hum blissfully.
Tony groaned. “Please, I’ll do whatever you’d like, Sir!”
He sighed and undid the rope around his thigh before he pushed off his pants and boxers. Looking down at himself, he felt a fresh rush of heat on his cheeks. He had just gotten off thinking about all the different ways to sexually torment Tony Stark.
A knot in his throat nearly made Tony forget how to breathe. He tried to hide his gasp for air before he summoned the words Steve had stalled his beautiful thick talented fingers for.
The Hulk, Bruce, was an untameable force in the field, but he was a brilliant mind that Steve was fascinated by in every conversation they had. Bruce seemed to have had more contact with Stark, as they were both scientists; Steve thought he might be able to pick up a few pointers from Bruce to get more familiar with Stark.
“‘Sir’ or ‘Steve’ is fine, but thank you, Tony.” Steve’s voice was far too pleased. Tony did
Steve confirmed the appointment immediately, setting the date for a week from then. He needed time to sort out his schedule and to study up on bondage rope techniques. Natasha had been trying her hardest (in Steve’s opinion, not very hard at all) not to be absolutely delighted at this turn of events.
SUBJECT: Appointment Repeat Request
“I didn’t mean to hurt you, Tony. I didn’t have a plan, it wasn’t some kind of conspiracy against you, I…” Steve stopped short, unsure of what he could say to explain that he had an ache in his chest, a longing to just be with Tony, to hold him, to explore so many new things with him. Just as they had been, but more.
Tony had been so vulnerable in front of Steve the previous night. One would never have had been able to imagine

After a long moment, she handed his phone back to him. “Get to know them
Tony pulls the cowl over his head, grumbling about the fit. “Now just head back to the quinjet or the Tower or—”
Steve ingeniously asked Tony about a painting hung above the fireplace in the den and Tony offered to give Steve a tour of the penthouse. Tony had idly collected art over the years from charity auctions and various gifts from businesspeople he’d met with. Steve showed more interest in the paintings decorating Tony’s walls than most guests did, so Tony found himself just following Steve as Steve’s eyes followed the paint strokes and light of the scenes before finding the next piece in Tony’s collection.
Steve looked at her, expression alarmed. She laughed. “Not by me, idiot. Just
The service Natasha set him up with provided him with policy manuals, sex education word documents and accompanying video files, as well as an email address to Human Resources should he have any concerns. He was... overwhelmed.
“Ugh… Alright, J, show me.” Tony grumbled, grabbing a towel from the pile of clothing and rags that had been collecting for days.
“As opposed to…
The next few weeks were filled with Avenger calls to assemble and a few new client appointments with the escort agency.
, Steve did not say, “I can figure out what I need to.”
The elevator doors opened into Captain America’s level and Tony stepped out. The décor was relatively untouched from the original layout arranged when Tony had agreed to accommodate the team in Stark Tower. The walls were bare of any personalization; the only evidence that someone had used the space was a pair of dirty boots by the elevator and an easel set up by the center the plate glass windows on the Eastern wall. Tony made out a partially painted rendition of a sunrise on the large canvas perched on the wooden easel.
“Okay, the Lightman Group wants tech for
“Tony, it’s okay.” Steve cooed, bending down to press his forehead against Tony’s. Suddenly, this all felt too intimate. Tony had to close his eyes again.
Tony nodded, eyes and cheeks burning. “Fuck—yes, Sir.” His voice shook when Steve thrust his two fingers deep inside him, slick with lube that Tony was too distracted to notice Steve applied.
It was early evening and Steve watched sullenly as Clint worked his way through the Tony leftovers buffet that Steve had only 10 minutes ago declared available for anyone (even Clint).
“Seems you need a lesson taught to you.” Steve’s right hand cupped Tony’s cheek, warming the skin for just a few seconds before rearing back. A swift
“Good boy.” Steve said with a smile, his hand stroking Tony’s back and Tony’s doubts subsided.
SINGLE ESCORT (1) EVENING =   $900.00
And Iron Man flew off, slightly slower than normal. Steve was pretty certain Tony was bordering neck-breaking speed, but he couldn’t tell him to adjust speed. He returned his attention to the communicator with Hawkeye and Black Widow.
Tony hadn’t fallen asleep so fast in months. When he awoke, JARVIS informed him it was 10:31am. Tony had one arm splayed out onto the mattress behind him.
He took a moment to gather himself before exiting his workshop and heading up to the communal floor. It was dubbed ‘communal’, however Tony rarely stepped foot on that floor unless it was in the middle of the night. It would have certainly looked strange for the billionaire landlord and tech support of the Avengers to duck into the communal kitchen to raid the leftovers, even if his body guard was on the team.
We're GETTING there! See?? Baby steps.
,” and gave his throat the most restrained squeeze he could. Tony wailed, clenching around Steve’s dick, hands clutching his own knees to his chest, and his cock spurted untouched across his belly.
“Alright guys Iron Man has retreated for medical treatment. What’s our status?”
“Can I have another kiss?” And Tony’s voice was so small. Steve leaned down and pressed his lips chastely against Tony’s. Tony inhaled deeply and pressed his cheek down against Steve’s chest again. “A-and a bath.”
. He wondered if Tony would enjoy his humour. Or, Steve thought with a tiny shameful thrill, Tony would take it to heart and follow his instruction. His order? No… That was not something Steve should even consider. Tony and he were… an arrangement. A paid arrangement. Steve provided a service.
“Your poor cock has been ignored all night.” Steve said as he unbuckled and unzipped. “You have been such a good cockslut, let’s give it a little reward, shall we?”
When Steve pulled out, Tony looked down and felt a strange disappointment when he saw the condom on Steve’s dick.
When Steve had been given his assignment to lead the Avengers, he was determined to serve as Captain America, to fight for what was right. He had a goal. His team was an eclectic group: Banner, Barton, Romanov, and the elusive Iron Man, whose identity was secret even to him. The fact that it frustrated him that Iron Man would not reveal his identity, even privately to Steve, was something Steve was not sure how to confront.
Tony’s mouth fell open wide, his eyes closing once he saw Steve’s intention. Steve carefully lined up the head of his cock between Tony’s lips, and he tried to hold back a moan when he felt Tony’s tongue swipe out to lick across the slit, his hot breath rolling across his erection. Once Tony’s mouth settled open, ready, Steve’s fingers curled into Tony’s hair gently and pushed in slowly.
“On your belly,” Steve ordered, maneuvering Tony’s body as he spoke.
“Stop, stop it. It’s all fucking ruined. When I leave, I want you out of here. And I don’t want to see your face again.”
“Good boy. Colour, now.”
At that, Tony hesitated-- mouth hung open, voiceless. Steve leaned in to press his lips to Tony’s ear, “I’d advise you not to lie to me.” This close to Tony, Steve could hear the smallest moan escape the man. “Time to hit the showers, Stark.”
When Steve leaned back again, Tony inhaled sharply as he watched Steve lick his lips clean of the semen that had been on Tony’s cheek. “Come on, now, sweetheart.”
His cock was still hard in his hand. Tony closed his eyes and thought of Steve’s muscled body.
Steve gave the back of Tony’s neck gentle scritches while his other hand came down over Tony’s Adam’s apple. His fingers were still slick with strawberry lube, it smeared as Steve gently squeezed on both sides of his throat.
“You want me to fuck you, Tony? How do you want it, baby? Rough, on your elbows and knees? Want me to bend you over and take you and leave bite marks across your shoulders, bruises on your hips?” Steve rolled his hips again, leaning in once again for a kiss. This time, it was fast, sloppy, and he took his time sucking and biting on Tony’s bottom lip before continuing to speak. Tony was blushing and eyes hazy already.
“P-please.” He managed to utter, opening his eyes to risk a glance at Steve’s face.
to be here. The mirrored elevator walls allowed Steve a last few moments to double check his appearance. He fought back the panic rising through his chest, to his throat. It was impossible that Stark would recognize him as Captain America. He was consistent in wearing his cowl while in uniform and at the SHIELD base. His identity was highly classified, and he doubted Stark had the interest to delve into his details, given how much he seemed to dislike Captain America.
Steve could not stop his hand from touching Tony’s thigh, sliding up to caress Tony’s ass. Tony gasped and shivered as Steve squeezed his firm cheek, fingernails digging in slightly. “Good, good.” Steve whispered as he squeezed Tony’s wrist, still trapped between their chests.
this. He must have. Tony’s flight undersuit was far from a turtleneck.
Tony nodded, glancing up at Steve. He looked nervous.
“You’re f’ckin’ perf’ct.” Tony mumbled into the pillow. As Steve held Tony in his arms, warm and pliant, vulnerable and safe, he considered it. He could tell him. He had to tell him.

.” Iron Man aimed his free gauntlet down to the forest, shooting a repulsor blast to the direction of the source of the gunfire.
“JARVIS, call Pepper.”
Steve watched Tony’s blush return full-force and Tony closed his eyes again. Steve waited.
“Very polite. So impressive; I wouldn’t have expected such good manners from a man of your reputation.” Steve guided Tony by the back of the neck onto his cock. Tony’s cheeks flushed redder, curling his lips over his teeth and taking in as much as he can, taking in a desperate breath through his nose as the head reached the back of his throat. “Greedy thing,” Steve cooed, rubbing his thumb along Tony’s hairline. “Show me what that mouth can do.”
The presence of Steve’s hand on his skin was nearly all Tony could focus on and it felt so fucking good. Tony nodded silently before remembering Steve did not ask a yes-or-no question. “Simple, if— if that’s alright.”
“God—
Steve took his time learning about what the future had to offer. The internet – this massive network of connections to information beyond Steve could have ever even fathomed. He learned more about the human body and sexual positions than he ever could have back when he was from – not that he straight away looked into things like that!
The large metal doors opened and Tony’s mouth was agape as the man who he had hired for the evening stepped out. He wore dark jeans and a brown leather jacket which hung open over a white button shirt. His shoes matched the leather of his jacket and they shone as though they were freshly polished. His blonde hair and broad shoulders gave Tony a sense of déjà vu that he could not place.
Steve’s eyes were scanning through the snowy woodland, trying to see a pattern in the disturbed trees. A thin trail of void led backward from the fire they were fleeing from. “Iron Man, we have to follow that line in the trees. They were hiding out somewhere there.”
“You’re such a good boy, Tony. Raised well to say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, weren’t we?” Steve continued to stroke Tony’s cock with his right hand while his left index gently pushed into Tony’s hole. Tony nodded steadily, agreeing with whatever it was that got Steve’s thick fingers inside him.
Soon there were two fingers inside him, gently pushing and stretching and then
Steve was guided towards what looked like a quite well-stocked and professional-looking bar counter. Recounting the question, Steve shook his head, but then decided that people would usually drink during an evening together. “Do you mind if I opt for a beer?” It was weaker than the offered wine, and thus practically impossible for Steve’s metabolism to get him intoxicated, but it was something. A social lubricant to continue the evening. Tony looked pleased to serve as he gestures for Steve to take a seat on a bar stool before ducking down to check his inventory.
“Sure, babydoll.”
All Tony wanted to do was be able to just throw on a smile and make an appointment with Steve, the perfect match to his cluster of kinks, his walking wet dream, the dom who had helped him forget about his life for a few hours, the man who Tony had been hoping… But there was no point. No point in dwelling, in hoping.
“I trust Captain America can keep a secret?”
A small crater of dirt and snow and fallen trees is what Steve opened his eyes to. He stood up, ankle twinging faintly but it was not a priority. Iron Man lay motionless in the center of the disturbed earth.
“Not yet,” Steve huffed, slipping his fingers out of Tony’s hair. “On your feet,” he said, savouring the sight of Tony slowly rising, trying not to make it too obvious that he was unsteady despite depending greatly on his hands on Steve’s hips for support.
It was wrapped four times, forming a flat wrap to make a comfortable handle. He gripped it tightly, imagining how he could manipulate and pull Tony’s body into position; just the way both men like it.

Tony winced inwardly.
“Well, I… I don’t know, if I had it my way, we’d be eating burgers and fries, but I figure it would be more suave to arrange for a curated arrangement of wine and cheese. But I know you prefer beer, so I have that too, if you want. Don’t feel pressured to eat, though, you don’t need to if you don’t want to, I mean—”
When Tony Stark had invited the Avengers to reside in Stark Tower, Steve had half-expected to see Iron Man out of his suit at

Steve shed his clothing, folded them neatly, and placed them on the bedroom floor, along with his shoes. He gently arranged Tony on the bed with his head hanging off the edge. The tent in Tony’s suit pants made Steve proud, pleased. He made that happen. And Tony seemed to be happy to be trapped in his clothes, which satisfied Steve’s newly discovered enjoyment of seeing Tony like this.
Tony’s left hand raised from its position on Tony’s thigh and for a moment Steve froze, wondering if that would be when Tony put an end to this. But his hand made its way to touch Steve’s hip but stopped short, hovering. “Can-Can I touch you, Sir?”
Instead, Steve dragged Tony into the bedroom, tossing him onto the sheets. Tony spread his legs as Steve climbed onto his knees between them. “Eager boy,” Steve growled. “Sit up.”
Tony let his left hand slip down his bare stomach to his cock, which had been stirring since his thoughts had returned to Steve and his gorgeous body, his gorgeous smile, his beautiful eyes and the way they looked at Tony with adoration and without pity. Steve had
Tony woke feeling warm. His breath was shallow, heated. He felt comfortable, his body sinking into the mattress, but he felt the need to squirm. As he approached wakefulness, he grew more aware of his erection and hummed softly to himself, pushed his head back into his pillow, stretching out before bringing his hand down his stomach languidly.
Tony nodded. “Good.”
Tony groaned. This man was unbearably petty. Tony might be in love.
Steve’s left hand landed a firm slap on Tony’s ass, relishing in the hot clench around his fingers. “You’re gorgeous.”
. How long has it been?”
Steve snorted. “Out of the two of us, I think you’re the one who needs the shower.”
Tony nodded and made to sit up again, and Steve was having
Blinking himself back into the present, he looked down at Tony, beautiful and flushed, limp and compliant, arms outstretched on the bed, legs bound in beautiful rope. First, Steve reminded himself, he must take care of Tony.
“Of course, Sir,” the AI replied cheerfully. Tony took a lengthy sip of his martini and brooded.
“We are
It was only once he had requested Cap’s floor to JARVIS did Tony begin to panic. He might be able to drop off the cowl if Mr. America hadn’t made his way to his floor yet. “J, is Cap on his floor yet?”

The man gripped Steve’s hair and guided him into a straighter posture again, undoing the curl that Steve had brought himself into under the man’s attention. The rope pinched and rubbed against Steve’s nipples when he straightened up and he let out a moan. “Feels good?”
Steve paused again, prematurely wincing, unsure of how Tony will react. Then, slowly and softly, a shaky snore purred out and filled the silent space of the bedroom.
“I like where this is going, babe,” Tony said, lips brushing Steve’s neck as he spoke.
The Avengers were called just a few hours after Steve departed from Tony’s penthouse. Steve’s mind was still spinning from the events that unfolded, but he managed to put his thoughts aside as he was briefed on the latest crisis that they were facing.
TO: Tony Stark
Tony reasoned that it would be acceptable to leave the cowl in the bedroom; it would definitely not be missed that way. He did not want this situation to be stretched out any more than it needed to be. He stepped inside the room and dropped the cowl down onto the bed. Tony stopped again.
Once Steve’s boots came into Tony’s view, the man looked up to Steve’s eyes. Steve wanted to see his neck and shoulders bruised again, bitten and beautiful. Steve wanted to touch the fading marks so badly, to press the pads of his fingers down until Tony panted for mercy or more.
When Tony’s back was to Steve, he took the opportunity to run his fingers down the dip of his spine. Tony subtly shivered and moaned breathily. With a grin, Steve let his hand travel lower, giving Tony’s ass a firm squeeze. “Have you showered?”
“Sit, um...” Tony said, and Steve sat gracefully on the edge of the bed, holding his hand up to ask Tony to follow. Tony stared down into Steve’s stupid amazing blue eyes and forgot what he had been meaning to say next.
Steve looked at Tony’s eyes, watching for cues. Tony’s eyes were glazed, pupils blown making his brown eyes look black, mouth pink, and lips swollen. He looked thoroughly fucked and he nodded quietly. Steve felt oddly proud that he had made Tony look like that.
Tony shrugged. “Cuddling?” Tony’s eyes shot up to briefly meet Steve’s gaze before looking at Steve’s hands.
“And you came in 2 hours early to run away from a relationship hiccup?”
“I know
“Sir, your guest from V.P. Escorts has arrived for the evening. Shall he be brought up?” JARVIS’s voice pulled Tony out of his thoughts. He checked the time. 8:55pm.
Steve stood plainly in the training gym, staring at his phone with his mouth agape and breathing heavy. He turned and returned to his private quarters. For private time.
Tony has a small anxiety attack in this chapter, he is very nervous about what Steve thinks of him and his epic list of kinky activities he requested for their second appointment. Everything is fine.
“So. That’s why you get to choose your clients. Because of things that aren’t
“What do I do if they want...” Steve’s eyes scanned the page that listed numerous sexual acts he had never heard of before. “Rimming?” Natasha nearly choked on her tea.
Tony asking permission for anything was causing Steve’s heart to mysteriously flutter, stomach warming and flipping with arousal. “Yes. Good job asking for permission. Hold my hips to keep steady. Don’t wander.”
The head of Steve’s cock was insistent on Tony’s tongue, a firm heat that he sucked on greedily, for just a moment, before Steve’s fingers tugged on his hair.
Steve shook his head, embarrassed. “I thought… Nat kept telling me to put myself out there. And… And I was… I didn’t know how. I figured sex could be stress relief, and if Nat believed I was finally taking care of myself maybe then I would be.”
, now that Steve ran back their conversation in his head. Tony listened. Tony Stark listened.
“Captain, please,” Tony piped up, his voice breathless as he fought laughter.
“Alright, I’ll let you enjoy Cap’s offerings in peace. He’d bite my head off if he knew I ate some. I’m off to bed.” Clint said, grinning and hopping off his seat and heading towards the elevator.
Tony whined wordlessly again. His mouth opened, shut, and he swallowed thickly, looking away and back a few times.
Damn. He certainly had not done
Tony’s shoulders slumped at the words before suddenly he was tugged up by the collar and into position again, his breath caught by the pull. “No.” Steve said brusquely. “You’ll thank me for compliments. Let me hear it.”
“Tell me, sweetheart, tell me what you want me to do to you.” Steve was surprised at himself at how easily the words fell from his mouth. Tony had his eyes closed, breathing deeply. “Look at me.” Steve said, wanting to see those blown pupils again. God, they were gorgeous.
“Yes, I did. Would you like to show me your rope?”
Tony looked up at him with such wide, wanting eyes. “Good boy.” Steve whispered, and relished the little moan Tony let out.
“Tony?”
Tony stared at the two bottles for a long moment. Steve did not say anything as Tony’s gaze wandered from the bottles to Steve’s naked body. He wondered if Tony was looking at his lack of body hair. Natasha had insisted it was all the rage to be clean-shaven.

their relationship, still dancing around each other, enjoying long evenings making out, touching, talking and cuddling. This night, Tony was really feeling it, wanting to touch Steve more, in new places, but… Tony dreaded this discussion.
Steve’s free hand rose to touch Tony’s thigh, sliding up to grab a handful of his ass. Tony let out a small gasp, shivering as Steve’s fingernails dug in as he squeezed. “Good, good.” Steve whispered into Tony’s ear as he squeezed his wrist trapped between their chests.
Steve hummed, enjoying Tony’s obvious enjoyment, and rolled the two of them over. He grabbed both of Tony’s wrists in one hand, pressing them against the mattress above Tony’s head. He rolled his hips down against Tony’s again, keen on hearing Tony curse and beg.
Steve’s fingers curled inside Tony, rubbing gently but suddenly against his prostate. “Aghh—F—”
Tony snapped out of his thoughts and realized Steve had still been speaking. “I-Uh—I didn’t—I’m sorry, I—” Tony closed his eyes tightly, trying to focus, trying to remember what Steve had been saying while Tony was rudely ogling his body instead of listening. His heart pounded in his ears, he could feel his pulse in his fingertips and his cock. Fuck, Tony
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll go shower. Lie down.”
Pepper approached the desk and Tony actively avoided looking down at her heels. He was a brave, confident business leader and he could look his CEO in the eye while she completely obliterated him with her astute perceptiveness.
Iron Man, name still unknown, was a match with Steve’s stubborn energy, but he made good and quick decisions when needed— despite how reckless those decisions may be. Steve still had yet to meet Iron Man outside of his metal armour; however, he had been told by SHIELD agents that his identity was kept secret for security reasons as he was also privately employed by Stark Industries to protect Tony Stark himself. After Stark was kept hostage in Afghanistan, Iron Man had been put on payroll to prevent further attempts on Stark’s life. The Avengers Initiative took on Iron Man when it became evident that he was a valuable addition to the team. However, Steve was slightly uncomfortable having a team member who he had never seen out of combat gear. “He probably has a family that he actually goes
“Tony, where the hell have you been!” Tony dared not to respond to the obvious not-question and spat out into the sink. Pepper continued, “You were supposed to be in a 10:00AM meeting with the Lightman Group, which we have rescheduled three times— no, right, that’s
Tony cringed at the words. He didn’t need to be congratulated on making it to the shower. He was not that pathetic. He held Steve’s hand tighter.

“Nuh uh, I don’t think so.” Steve growled, bringing Tony’s leftt hand to hold the back of Steve’s thigh. His thrusts were steady, harsh, Tony’s breath quivering. “‘s that why you didn’t want rope just yet?” Steve clucked his tongue in disapproval. Tony’s moaned response was punctuated by Steve’s cock tapping the back of his throat in quick succession. “Sneaky boy you are.” Tony’s right hand was taken to Steve’s thigh too. “Hands stay there. That’s your final warning.”
Steve accepted a second tiny cheeseburger, and then as they returned to the living room, another beer. Steve noticed a large painting hung above the fireplace. It was beautiful, obviously an original, as Steve could see the paint strokes and the shine of the oils. “Where did you get that painting?”
Tony had the time it took to chew his final bite before he had to answer. Well, not

Then, absolutely unforeseeably, they were chest to chest, Tony’s hands on Steve’s hips, looking at each other with lusting eyes and pink cheeks. Steve could pull him in for a kiss, suck his neck, bite his shoulders, mark Tony up. Mark Tony as
“So…”
“Two nights in a row you’re MIA for secret reasons and it’s not a relationship? Come on, Tony, I know you better than that. You pushed things aside for him, you like him. Don’t be stubborn, go talk to him.”
— please, fuck- fuck me, Sir, I need your cock, Captain,
He needed. Needed anything Steve would give him. No. He needed Steve to stop playing with Tony’s hole and fill it up with his cock. He needed to be fucked within an inch of his life, with bruises on his hips and bite marks on his neck. He wanted Steve to have him rough, to mark him up, to pinch his nipples until he screamed, to pull his hair until he came on the sheets with Steve’s cock splitting him open. God, his cock was huge. Tony wondered how it would even fit.
. I just want to do as much as I can.” Steve started scrolling through more of the information the service sent. He wanted to ask Natasha any questions he might have.
The cool flash of lube slicking up his hole struck Tony before a third finger was pushed in.
Tony then realized he was alone in the open concept space of the floor – no sign of the Star Spangled Man. Taking his chance, Tony dropped the cowl on the bare wooden coffee table centered in the living area.
“Put your hands to good use, and we’ll see if you get to come once I’m done.” At that, Tony gasped and reached up, nearly afraid that Steve’s grin and the glint in his eye were a trap to fall into. Probably were, but he didn’t much care at that point.
“Isn’t it past your bedtime?” Tony quipped, as he approached the kitchenette. The light above turned on as Tony reached the fridge. He was surprised to find numerous takeout containers adorned with post-it notes which read ‘TONY’ in thick marker. Pepper had gotten the team to ration for him, it seemed.
, or his safeword. Steve was tied up in a fanciful rope harness across his chest, wrapping up his forearms behind his back. The rope was soft, and brightly coloured. Steve felt… delicate. Secure. He knew that he could shrug out of the rope at an instant, tearing it like tissue paper, but he would not.
After what had felt like only a short while, Steve’s client squeezed his shoulder firmly, but again gently. “Thank you.” Steve blinked away his thoughts, his stillness, and looked up at the man. He smiled. “Let’s untie you. You’ve been so good.”
Steve grinned. “That can be arranged.”
Tony attempted to shrug, but with his hands otherwise occupied (one still pinned by Steve’s left hand, the other on his own cock), it was not apparent. “I’m generally not polite before breakfast.”
“I really do prefer ‘genius’.”
Wait.

Steve nodded slowly, wordlessly, watching Tony’s reaction. Then, he added, “not anything that we’ve been doing! She just knows that you and I have been meeting.”
“Please,” Tony spoke up, raising his chin and pushing forward against Steve’s hand on his neck.
Tony came between their chests, hot white coating Steve’s fingers. When Steve’s fingertips pressed against Tony’s lips, Tony’s mouth opened without thought. He sucked his own spend off Steve’s thick fingers, gasping when Steve’s teeth closed over the flesh at the joint of his neck and shoulder. Then, Steve’s thrust paused for just a moment, and Tony relished the thought of being filled with Steve’s semen.
Tony sputtered, nearly choking on his own spit. “How do you even—?”
The air was cool, but Steve felt warm, buzzing with
“Yes-Yes, Sir.” Tony stammered, slyly pushing his hips back towards Steve. A second slick finger pushed into him fast, both crooking and pushing against his prostate.
Tony chanted a string of ‘yes’ and ‘Steve’ and ‘Sir’ and ‘please’, his mind gone to mush as he desperately encouraged Steve to
Pepper’s face twisted in confusion, eyes widening in shock and then narrowing with suspicion. “You’re… early,” she said tentatively.
Everything became a haze as Tony focused dreamily on the fullness of his mouth, the pounding on the back of his throat, the taste of bitter precome and sweet strawberries. The hair at the nape of his neck was fisted tightly once again and Steve’s thrusts halted, his cock lodged fully in Tony’s wet heat. Tony swallowed around him desperately, relishing the weight of Steve’s cock in his mouth.
in a while.
“Please,” Tony’s voice was a whisper met with a moan. His mouth was open, soft and inviting.
Steve laid Tony forward again, fingers slipping from Tony’s mouth, thrusting his hips slowly as he rode out his orgasm. He pressed himself down against Tony’s body, their sweat mingling, breath coming in pants. Tony’s heart was pounding in his ears and he never wanted Steve’s warm weight to leave his back. Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder blade, staying in place.
Steve’s eyes darkened, grin like the Cheshire cat, which silently said ‘I know something you don’t.’
Tony nodded quickly, still slowly turning, head turning to look at Steve. “Yes, Sir.”
He returned with the brown leather collar and its matching leash in hand. He draped the leash over Tony’s shoulder as he wrapped the leather around Tony’s neck. Steve took Tony’s chin between his thumb and forefinger, tipping it up to look in Tony’s eyes. “You’re gorgeous.”
A client has requested to have a repeat experience with you. That’s fantastic! Please read over the new details they have requested for the new appointment.
“Good boy…” Steve whispered. “Come on, now. Let’s get you lying down properly.”

.” He smiled and Tony’s face scrunched up with a blush.
“What needs to change, darling?” Steve purred, his left hand stroking Tony’s shoulder instead of tugging Tony’s leash. Tony’s breath was caught in his throat anyway.
“That’s enough now.” With two of Steve’s fingers heavy on Tony’s tongue, it sent heat curling in both of their guts. Tony began to suck, lave his tongue as best he could under and around the thick digits. He closed his eyes as Steve’s other hand dug into his damp hair, resting only a moment before the grip went firm and the fingers in his mouth began pushing, pumping in and out, testing Tony’s tongue.
“Fu-uck me...” Tony groaned.
Tony obeyed, eyes boring into Steve’s as he gripped the edge of the headboard behind him.
Steve’s hand found the small of Tony’s back as Tony slowly descended into the water. He moaned happily as he settled in, closing his eyes. Steve turned off the faucet.
Steve woke at 7:54am. He checked on the wristwatch Tony left on the nightstand, peering over Tony’s shoulder. The two of them slept curled up together all night. Steve’s chest felt warm at the thought.
The microwave beeped and startled them both. Tony sat up as Steve brought over the plated food to him with a spoon and a glass of water. Tony wordlessly picked up the spoon and tentatively started in on the meal. Steve sat by him quietly.
He poured out his cocktail and it hit him.
Tony shrugged, flipping the page in the Lightman proposal on his desk. “Can’t a man be prepared?”
.” Black Widow responded through the comms.
“Have you eaten yet today? You said you have some food in the kitchen, right?” Tony nodded, his forehead rubbing against Steve’s firm shoulder. “When did you eat?”
He would look beautiful tied up, hogtied and put on his knees at the centre of the bed, teetering for balance as Steve plucked at his nipples, whispering taunts, pressing soft kisses onto Tony’s neck while pulling his hair. Tony would lean forward for tender caresses against the will of leather straps and Steve’s fingers in his brown locks. All manner of sensation overwhelming Tony, unfolding him for Steve to enjoy.
Tony grunted and shook his head. “No,” he huffed. Steve relaxed his grip a bit, and they parted to meet eyes again. “It’s not that. I just don’t… care? No, I mean— I care! I care about how much of my body I show to my partner, and how much my partner wants to show to me, but I just, genuinely don’t see the appeal of being completely nude if you don’t have to be.”
Tony wriggled, frustrated but so fucking needy for Steve.
Tony Stark to be such an incredibly fantastic, praise-hungry, beautiful… submissive? Bed-partner? Steve realized he had no word to describe what Tony really
“What a pushy slut, I think you’ve forgotten your place.” Steve’s voice was a growl in Tony’s ear. Before Tony could think, Steve’s teeth sunk down into the flesh of his shoulder. Their position made it impossible to do any more than shallow thrusts, but Steve’s size made up for it. Tony groaned, screamed, as Steve sucked on the bite marks he made, punching moans out of Tony’s mouth as he hit Tony’s prostate.
to say is that Tony is stubborn. I spent a good amount of time spying on him to know how much of a hard-head he can be—”
The next morning came too soon. Steve awoke around 6:15 and considered his options as he looked over Tony’s sleeping features. He looked so peaceful, brow smoothed free of stress and mouth slack and relaxed. Steve was so tempted to softly caress Tony’s bottom lip with his thumb. Steve could slip out of the penthouse right now, and avoid a third attempt at the most awkward conversation he might ever have to have. On the other hand, he could stay and hope Tony could forgive him. He could forgive him and maybe even give him a chance.

Tony, who Steve had come to have a soft spot for. An inexplicable urge to hold and care for. He actually
Tony’s glare turned into a glowery pout. “Could’ve been a party for two,” he mumbled, then slumped into the chair across from Steve and put his head down into his cradled arms on the dark wooden table. “Did you even like the beer?” he said, voice muffled but Steve could of course hear his pettiness through his arms.
Steve was becoming more familiar with what he enjoyed in bed with every evening he spent with Tony. He enjoyed holding Tony in place, with his bare hands or with Tony’s leather. He pulled just a bit tighter on his thigh; he would love to have Tony in his ropes.
He turned and left as quickly as he could to avoid running into Cap on the way to the elevator. Maybe JARVIS would care to explain why Cap was reported to be present in the apartment when he was not. Tony hopped onto the elevator and was about to ask for the workshop when his phone vibrated.
It was breathy, with Tony’s teeth catching Steve’s bottom lip. This was similar but very different to the kiss Steve had with Peggy. It had been rushed, full of adrenalin, fear, hope. Tonight, Steve was perched comfortably on Tony’s bed, heart pounding in his chest for entirely different reasons. Tonight he would experience so many things for the first time; after this, maybe he wouldn’t blush every time Natasha asked about his sex life.
“Alright. Well, you certainly can’t keep your hands to yourself. My helmet is shredded. I’d’ve been fine if you hadn’t interfered with my armour!”
Tony took a deep breath and held it for much longer than necessary. The hand on his neck gripped firmly, fingers sliding closer together, gathering tension before releasing suddenly. Tony exhaled heavily and sagged against Steve’s shoulder.
Ah, Steve thought, a childish drunk then. Steve could work with that. He chose not to take that tasty bait. Instead, he offered Tony food. “My guess is you didn’t eat a single thing while you were having a party for one upstairs, hm?”
“What, you think something’s wrong with me?” He had asked, giving a soft chuckle to mask the insecurity he was voicing.
Steve let go of the button between his fingers, instead smoothing his palm over Tony’s shoulder. His gaze was soft as he looked right back at Tony. “It’s alright, Tony, we don’t have to go any further tonight if you don’t—”
Tony shook Steve’s hand and smiled, nodding politely at the compliment. “Tony.” With their hands still together, Tony pulled Steve closer to himself and placed his left hand at the small of Steve’s back. “Can I offer you a glass of wine, Steve?”
“How can you be so sure?” Steve was listless. Tony couldn’t even bear to listen to him, to look at him. That seemed like hatred to Steve.
“The trees are too dense for me to see much from the air. I may as well hang out with you, Cap.”
Steve looked concerned, eyeing Tony, whose hand was still resting firmly on Steve’s shoulder.
“What have we been doing, Steve?” The name still felt a bit odd, but Tony looked up at Steve and felt a jolt through his body, felt an urge to reach out and kiss him. He couldn’t lie to himself and believe that it was just the liquor talking.
“Shh… you’re doing so well.” Steve had smiled and closed his eyes, enjoying the gentle touches and kind words. They washed over him like a warm summer rain.
Plain bar soap would predictably not be in sight in a billionaire’s bathroom, so Steve reached for a bottle of body wash. It smelled of lavender and sage as he poured some out in his palm and lathered.
“I was wondering if you were… I was thinking, do you ever dom off the agency’s time?” Tony winced internally. Stupid, stupid, you sound like a prick, he scolded himself.
, the way his insides fluttered thinking of how Steve manhandled him. Tony was so close, his breath coming in airy wisps.
The rush of heat to his lips, blush on his cheeks, and coiling heat deep in his gut had Tony reaching for his cock. Why hadn’t he gotten his pants off, again? The shirt had to stay on for the atmosphere to remain sexy but damn did Tony regret not unzipping when he still had the chance to look at what he was doing. Just as his fingers slipped below his belt, his wrist was tugged away roughly.

Cap knew. Which meant it would be just a matter of time for Fury to recognize how unreliable Tony was and kick him off the team. Tony clenched his fists around the leather of Captain America’s cowl. It had some dried blood on the inside, where it had pressed against Tony’s forehead. The infinitely skilled attendant on his jet had cleaned up his wound. “You might need stitches, Mr. Stark, I’ll get you water instead of the usual.” Tony liked her a bit less, then, but put his head in his hands.
Steve was mesmerized by Tony’s body, his warmth and tightness, his eyes, his mouth. Tony’s mouth spewing adoration for Captain America’s body, Captain America’s dick, Captain America’s voice, Captain America’s hands on his neck.
“That was so good.” Steve whispered into his ear. When did he crawl over Tony?
Steve couldn’t refrain from rolling his eyes but did not respond to him. “What had the truck been transporting?”
“Uh, check the fridge? I don’t know what’s in there.”
“Got it, Cap.”
“Yes, Sir!” Tony yelped as Steve laid a quick slap to Tony’s ass before leading him to the luxurious and especially non-military shower, but it would do perfectly.
. Natasha will not allow him to keep any details to himself, Steve knows it.
Tony came as soon as Steve growled out a quick, “
Steve cleared his throat and smiled at Tony earnestly, “It’s good to see you again. You know,” Steve paused, spotting the colouration of the skin just above the collar of Tony’s crisp shirt. “Arnica gel could help with those bruises.”
“I didn’t realize that Captain America spirit applied to sex, too.”
. You deserve to figure out what you want.”
If you are able, please stay home as much as you can. We're all in this together.
But that did mean that Steve agreed to fuck Tony again. The thought of Steve’s hands on Tony, holding him down, squeezing his throat, his cock, pinching his nipples. Fuck, he wanted that. How likely would it be for a civilian to recognize what an arc reactor is and connect some dots? Because
“Hey, it was technically today.” Tony argued, being coaxed to stand by Steve’s strong arms.
“And fucking,” Tony huffed and slumped down onto the cool tile floor, folding his legs up in front of his chest. Steve nodded, “yeah.”
“Just wait for him to come to you,” Natasha said, rising from her seat and tapping Clint’s shoulder. Clint looked up from his food and piled up a few take out containers and his plate and followed Natasha.
Steve was giving gentle scratches through the hair at the back of Tony’s head as he enjoyed Tony’s tongue, his warmth. Then, he set out to do what Tony asked of him.
The third client Steve had accepted had been matched with Steve due to his strength. The man had a kink for large-muscled men to hold him down. Just that. Press him into the mattress, grind him into the lush carpet, preferably while disparaged with humiliating lines predetermined by him, until he wept with frustration. Steve had wondered if the man would ejaculate from the experience, but he fucked the man afterwards in the master bedroom.
They walk towards Tony’s den where Tony has his bar stocked and ready for company. Steve shakes his head. “Do you mind if I opt for a beer?” Tony releases Steve and gestures to a bar stool as Tony walks behind the slim counter to duck into the mini fridge.
Steve was not prepared for that— not even close.
“Dicking down?”
Tony’s hole was glistening, and Steve gently lowered the tip of his middle finger to it. Tony’s breath hitched but his hips pushed back towards the finger. Steve grinned and let the single finger gently press inside, but only to the first knuckle. Saliva could only go so far.

“I assumed you wanted me to sleep in here. Did you have a setup in mind, or…?”
, which established the legal groundwork for the structure of Escort and Sex Work establishments in the country.
Tony let out another moan. “Yes, Captain.”
. Steve moaned when Tony began to suck and swallow around his erection as it was paused in his mouth. “Fuck, you want it that badly? Want me to shoot down your throat, Tony?”
, Tony thought. “But I would love to get your ass pink and warmed up for me to eat you out, all flustered and sensitive.” Tony’s eyes closed, nodding, leaning into Steve’s hand in his hair. “Bet you’d be begging so fast, not sure if you want it to stop or if you want more.”
There was an email notification from V.P. Escorts. Tony requested another appointment. Despite Steve’s better instincts, he accepted. Tonight.
One more martini.
“Pants off. Toss a pillow onto the floor for me; these knees aren’t what they used to be.”
TO: 72091
“No, I’m not, I skipped the meeting.”
, but Steve’s gaze never wavered. With his eyes still trained on Steve, Tony reached down with his right hand for his own cock. With a satisfying flip in his gut, Tony’s hand was thwarted as he’d expected, and his wrist was pinned down to the mattress by Steve’s free hand. Tony grinned devilishly.
She gave Steve a
Tony. Stark.
“I’ll—I’ll take my chances.” Tony panted as Steve slid a third finger into Tony’s ass.
Steve dove down to meet Tony’s mouth, hands pushing Tony’s knees open and up towards Tony’s shoulders. Tony moaned, feeling stretched and exposed and vulnerable under this powerful man, helpless but to take what he is given. Steve sucked and nipped at his bottom lip languidly while his hands pressed at Tony’s skin roughly, sliding warm palms up his inner thighs, his groin. All of a sudden, his balls were taken by one large, warm hand, pressed and rolled and
“You’re gorgeous.” Tony said.
Steve let out a small chuckle. “You ready for my monster cock? As you so eloquently described it.”
. You look so fucking gorgeous, I wanna see what you look like when you’re coming.”
The slick grip on Tony’s cock started stroking again, slow and languid. Tony huffed, eyes closed, hips jerking upwards. “I—” He cut himself off when he felt a slick finger rub at his hole. “N—f-fuck.”
“Ready to talk?”
Tony sighed. Pepper would have a field day if a civilian knew he was Iron Man. Then there were the Avengers, who, Tony reasoned, would shrug him off like a spoiled rich boy if they knew. Tony was more afraid of Pepper.
*Please review our information manual on the aspects of Dominance & Submission dynamics, and Rough Sex negotiation.
“Fuck. No.”
Steve tugged the leash, pulling Tony back up on his hands and forcing his back to arch. “Shoulders back, strong and proud. What a good boy.” Tony let out a shaking moan, cheeks warm and vision blurry. He whined as he felt a second finger slide between his cheeks. The fingers together pushed roughly at his hole, still wet with Steve’s spit, rubbing and teasing but not pushing in further.
“Good evening, Tony.” He said softly, looking into Tony’s eyes with an expression so gentle Tony had to look away.
Steve had hoped that a more amicable relationship could be struck up now that the team had been relocated to Stark (Avengers) tower, but his efforts were fruitless as Stark was still unauthorized to know Captain America’s identity. It would certainly be cumbersome to walk around in his cowl in case Stark happened to come down to the communal Avengers floor; however, Natasha had said that Stark had never come to the communal floor during the day. Steve simply took to leaving take-out leftovers in the fridge with notes marking them as Tony’s. Clint had told Steve (once, in passing) that sometimes Stark would come down to scavenge from the fridge, so Steve figured they would not go to waste. Steve had also figured that, without the notes, anyone (
thing.” Natasha explained, taking a new sip from her mug. “Remember, you don’t actually have to do every single thing on the list that a client sends the service.”
Steve emerged with a smile. Tonight, he wore a black t-shirt and jeans, his leather jacket hung on the crook of his elbow, both hands in his pockets as he stepped towards Tony.
Tony closed his eyes, stayed still. “No, no, you should stay. You were here first,” he started, but then his head shot up and he glared at Steve. “Well, I was here before all of you, technically.”
He was so fucking stupid. He should not have erupted at Steve like he had. Steve could already be on the phone to Fury about how Tony was unfit for duty as an avenger, or in violation of the confidentiality clause of his contract, or, or—
Steve had been actively keeping Tony out of his mind, but that comment reminded Steve of his note to Tony that morning.
Tony wondered how long he had been asleep while Steve was working him open. He wondered if Steve started sucking his cock first or if Steve fingered him first and his cock was just there, so convenient. Steve didn’t even have to do that. Tony’s hands pet through Steve’s hair at the thought.
“I’m—” Tony moaned.
“I thought you’d never ask, Tony.” Steve’s voice was cool, calm. A hint of humour in his inflection, he seemed to enjoy Tony’s delicate approach at this evening’s itinerary.
Dress Code: [n/a]
Tony is really intent on the next appointment. Steve will be like wtf
Steve sat behind Tony in the tub, grabbed a washcloth and a fragrant body wash and started washing Tony. He started at his shoulders, down his back, his arms. He gently wiped Tony’s face with the soft warm cloth, then placed the cloth into Tony’s left hand. “Wash your chest for me, baby. I don’t want to hurt you.”
After the longest second of his life, Steve heard Tony let out a little chuckle. His hand came up to rub Steve’s muscular arm. “It’s alright, Steve, you don’t have to keep it up now. Just relax, be you.”
Steve grinned, hands up in surrender. “Caught me.”
“Let’s get you in, you must be cold.” Steve’s voice was gentle.
“What this eloquent man
Iron Man changed their trajectory, southbound. “Well, I can’t seem to find any heat readings. But it’s pretty freezing out here. Easy cover. Ugh. Canada.” They suddenly swerved to the right, then began a zig-zag flight pattern. “Machine guns? Really? These guys are so
“Hi,” Steve said lamely, the stiff silence between them broken abruptly. Tony stopped as he arrived by the dining table and shifted his weight from one foot to the other, looking around the room as if Steve hadn’t said anything at all.
Tony cried out, and his eyes opened again although he couldn’t remember them having closed. His hand snapped up to grab Steve’s wrist, but to just hold. Tightly.
“Yes, Tony. Their name is Izzy and they have worked for you for two weeks and that is the longest you have kept a secretary since me, so please don’t make HR find yet another replacement. Be nice.”
Tony keened as Steve stroked his hair. “Ah, yes. Please.”
“That’s nice.” Steve said evenly. Tony might have pouted. “Could be nicer.”
“Could’ve come inside me…” Tony whispered, eyes blinking slowly, exhaustion finding him again. What time was it, anyway?
“I like the traffic light system, too. Short and sweet, like someone we know.” Steve winked at Tony.
“It’s really okay, Tony. I’ve been hoping for you to meet someone.” Pepper stepped forward so she could gently squeeze his tense shoulder. “You deserve to be happy.” She stepped back again, moving to take a seat across from him and putting down her coffee cup on his desk.
Before Tony could crumble into a pit of despair, JARVIS alerted him to the arrival of his guest. Tony took a deep breath and hurried to greet Steve at the elevator.
A gentle stroke of Tony’s cock spread the beading precome over his head. Steve watched Tony’s hands clench and unclench at his sides, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. “Hands over your head, sweetheart. Hold the headboard.”
bruises on Tony. Was that right? No. He should not be thinking like that. That… That would be too far.
“You’re not too bad yourself.”
“Whoa, where did our wholesome Captain America go?”
Tony blinked and realized he was still looking over his shoulder at Steve, who was growing visibly concerned. “Uh— green,” Tony straightened up, shoulders high and back arched like Steve had wanted. “Green!” Tony repeated, pushing himself back onto Steve’s hips when Steve didn’t move.
Tony began to suck happily once the first couple of inches were pressed against his tongue. Steve pet Tony’s hair for a moment before giving a gentle tug. Tony let out a whine and let his mouth so slack again. Steve chuckled softly before pushing further into Tony’s mouth. It was so hot, wet, and soft. Steve could not have been able to imagine this. This was incredible.
“Tell me, sweetheart, tell me what you want me to do to you.” Steve’s voice was low, steady. “Look at me.” Tony’s eyes were closed, but he could feel Steve’s stare. As he opened his eyes, he saw the hair previously combed neatly has fallen from its uniform pull to the side and now sways in the gentle push of the air conditioning. “Good boy.” Tony let out a little moan, much to Steve’s satisfaction.
Pepper rolled her eyes, taking up her coffee cup. “I know you’re already on it, Tony.” She took a sip. “Now tell me about the mystery man.”
Steve has every intention of telling Tony the truth. He really totally does.
Tony sighed. He had hardly expected anything less than a harsh scolding. As he made his way nude to his bedroom, he picked up his phone from his nightstand. He returned to V.P. Escorts’ website, intent on requesting another night with Steve, the escort of Tony’s (wet) dreams.
“If that were true, you wouldn’t be dragging me to the kitchen, you’d be carrying me to the bedroom.”
A pang of… not sadness, not yearning, of
Tony managed to drag himself off of his bed and into some clothes decent enough to transport himself a few floors down to the captain’s level. He grabbed the cowl from the coffee table on the way to the elevator.
“Such a good boy. Come now,” The man guided Steve to stand, “I have work to do at my desk.”
, Tony wanted to beg.
Steve was huge. His cock pushed against Tony’s insides and dragged against his prostate. Tony became a moaning mess, torn between fucking himself onto Steve’s cock or collapsing onto the bed and letting Steve have his way.
“Stark,” Steve spoke harshly, the way Tony seemed to have expected to be addressed by Captain America. Tony’s eyes bulged for long enough for Steve to glimpse, before his gaze snapped back to the floor, to Steve’s boots. “Look at me when I’m speaking to you, soldier!” Steve’s left hand shot out to grip a fistful of Tony’s hair, tugging to force his head backward. Tony’s hands flailed to keep balance, grazing one of Steve’s pant legs before resettling in his lap.

. He is such an idiot.
“Fuck, you want it that badly? Want me to shoot down your throat, Tony?” Tony’s fingernails pinched into the skin on Steve’s thighs, holding him close.
As he pulled out of Tony’s mouth, still half-hard, Tony gave him a scandalized look. Steve only could smile as he helped Tony up, and coaxed him into the center on the bed, nestled in the numerous pillows.
Thanks so much for reading! Kudos and comments are loved and appreciated :)
“I assumed you wanted me to sleep in here. Did you have a setup in mind, or…?” Steve trailed off, gesturing with open palms.
Tony still didn’t give up, of course. He carefully glanced up at her before returning to his papers. “What do you mean?”
Steve noticed, of course, and grinned. “You need a hand, doll?”
We go about 10 minutes back in time from previous chapter, but Steve's perspective.
Another bite.
The slide of the leash off his shoulder made Tony open his eyes. The sight of Steve winding the end of the leash around one hand had Tony’s dick stirring up.
A small warmth flickered inside Tony’s chest at the word.
Steve could easily pin Tony down with one hand, have Tony begging.
from Tony.
When Tony’s suit was yet again assembled around Tony’s body, Steve turned, removed his cowl, and tossed it over his shoulder to Tony. “Don’t peek now,” Steve warned.
Tony truly, deeply needed to get laid.
The company of a person who gave their full attention, focus, and body, to him. Steve could admit to himself that he got a rush, a thrill, from having that with Stark that one night. He had dominated other men since their appointment, but, he had not replicated that connection he had felt with Tony’s body under his hands, under his direction and control.
“… if I kinda know the client?” Steve finished, looking at Natasha helplessly.
“I’m waiting.” Steve looked smug. Tony glared.
Steve was dumbstruck for a quick second, then giddily curled up around Tony’s back. He draped his leg over Tony’s hips and held him close. “Good?”
Steve started out on a steady rhythm, eyes roaming over what he could see of Tony’s face, and down his clothed body. He eyed Tony’s hands carefully as they began to twitch and wander again. This time, they began to edge closer to Tony’s crotch.
He didn’t know what to say to fix whatever had been between them. Tony was sullenly drunk, rubbing his eyes into his sleeves. It struck Steve how different Tony was from his typical extroverted persona when he was drunk, it made him wonder how much of his behaviour was a front for the public, a show for an unimaginably expansive audience. He gave Tony’s shoulder a small squeeze.

“You’re such a good boy, Tony, Raised well to say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, weren’t we?” Steve continued to stroke Tony’s cock with his right hand while his left pointer finger gently rubbed and pushed into Tony’s hole. Tony kept nodding with no words.
“Yeah?” Natasha said, plucking a pair of sunglasses from the display rack and trying them on, smiling at Steve before replacing them.
The time until Steve responded felt eternal. At least, to Tony it felt that way. As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted it. How desperate Tony must look to this man. His escort, Tony reminded himself. Escort. Not boyfriend.
Steve had been halfway up to standing, when he swiftly rushed through the open door of his bedroom closet. He pulled the door nearly shut, so as not to reveal his position with the squeak of the knob. He dared peer through the slim part and caught sight of Tony stepping carefully into the bedroom. “Captain?”
Tony could have made himself throw up with that horrible line.
“You’d think a billionaire like you would have qualms about cold pizza.” Clint signed, chewing his chicken happily.
“Or would you rather I take the lead here?” Steve spoke carefully, stroking Tony’s jaw with his thumb. Tony blinked for just a moment, then nodded silently. Steve grinned. “That’s what I thought. You know I know what’s best for you.”
After Steve made himself a quick lunch in his kitchenette, instead of over-polishing his shield, he found himself on his bed practicing knots and rope patterns on his own ankles, his own thighs. Images of how Tony would look in these same ropes flashed through Steve’s mind. His dick twitched in his jeans as he thought of how satisfied he would feel to have Tony be at Steve’s mercy, begging for orgasm. Or, begging for not yet another.
Hello,
Steve was flabbergasted at Tony’s outburst. And then, angry.
, Tony chuckled. “You’ve got a point.”
Captain America and Tony Stark had not spoken more than once or twice face-to-face, however, Stark appeared not to be, in the very slightest, reverent about his attitude toward The Avengers. He had been invited numerous times to meetings regarding tech requirements, budgetary adjustments, and the like, and not once had attended. Director Fury had seemed irritated, but Steve had been furious. He hated getting dressed in his full Captain America uniform needlessly, and with Stark, being the one person who was not granted access to Captain America’s true identity, skipping the aforementioned meetings, Steve was growing resentful.
The man provided Steve with water and offered a snack, but he only took the water. Steve had not realized how parched he had been, but he would be at the Tower soon after his departure from this man’s home. On the sidewalk outside, he confirmed the completion of this evening’s appointment with the service, and called a cab.
Tony took a testing sip of his cocktail before setting it down and leaning forward slightly on his elbows. Steve’s eyes were a strong blue and they did not back down against Tony’s gaze.
“I could have gotten
(See the end of the chapter for
At 8:55, Steve began the process of extricating himself from Tony’s bed. He successfully dressed himself and made his exit and returned to his floor in the tower.
Before Steve could suggest they ease up, if Tony is struggling, Tony broke the silence.
Your physical characteristics we have on file have matched with an appointment request received by the following client.
“As per your instruction, Sir, SHIELD classified identity information has been restricted from verbal access.” JARVIS replied, and Tony was certainly not drunk enough to just be imagining the smug sound of his voice.
Steve was still laid out on the bed, arms stretched with his hands folded under his head, eyes closed.
Steve decided not to think about the certain swirl in his gut that he felt when he heard Tony call him Captain out of the field.
“Is- is this okay?”
He found a folded piece of paper with a phone number scribbled on it and a brief note.
“That’s it,” Steve purred when Tony’s fingers reached the smooth expanse of his chest, his pecs. “Just like I taught you.”
At that, Steve gave a shallow thrust before pulling out until just the head of his cock was cradled between Tony’s lips. Tony’s tongue licked across the head quickly, catching the salty taste, before Steve started up a steady rhythm.
Steve hummed, pleased. “That feel good, baby? You want it?” Steve spoke low. Tony nodded quickly. Steve grinned at Tony’s speechlessness. “Did I fuck the words out of your head? Where are your manners, sweetheart?”
“Green. Sir,
Tony wordlessly whined, mouth falling open, wanting to demand that Steve fuck him already. He didn’t care how, he just needed it. It dawned on Tony how long it had actually been since Tony had been fucked. His mouth watered, suddenly felt empty, missing something, as he thought of how to phrase his thoughts for Steve.
Tony smiled. “You’re talking as if what they’re asking for is possible.”
Tony opened his email to read the confirmation for the tenth time over.
Steve flushed. He could not or did not want to believe his ears. Through Tony’s declaration, Steve was enveloped in a rising sense of dread-- once the name “Captain America” was uttered, his pulse was in his ears and his mind was reeling at the implications of Tony’s proposal.
come on my face.” His cheeks were hot, red, Tony could feel sweat beading at his temples, on his neck.

Tony flew down to Vancouver where he had his jet ready to return him to New York. On the flight, Tony had time to ruminate.
“Good morning, Sir. It’s 6:30am, the weather in New York is 54 degrees, expecting light scattered showers. Your first appointment is at 9:00am and you have 4 messages from Ms Potts awaiting you.” Tony was stirring as JARVIS spoke, grumbling and turning in towards Steve’s chest.
“40 minutes.”
“I…” Tony began, voice small. Steve let up on his neck, and cupped Tony’s hard cock through his trousers with his other hand. Tony’s hips bucked up and Steve clucked his tongue at him. Tony settled back into the couch and took a deep breath before spending it all in one go. “Like all good Americans, I’ve always had an embarrassing crush on Captain America and well, since—You, you look—Um, you’ve got quite the patriotic look, and I… I want to be taken apart by Captain America and be told I’m unworthy to lick his boots. Not that I want to lick your boots, or anyone’s boots. It’s more of a metaphor. Just—I’d—I’d like that. I want that— want to have to
A gasp escaped Tony’s lips before he could stop it. Steve’s teeth took a bite at the plump flesh of Tony’s left asscheek before his tongue laved at the captured skin and he sucked gently.
When Steve was close, he summoned all of his strength of will to pull out, drinking in the delicious sight before him. Tony, teary-eyed and messy around his mouth, looking up at him with hazy awe and curiosity. What would come next, Tony looked to be wondering through his veil of subspace.
’s throat twitched around his cock and his fingers tightened in the blond hair. A thick presence in his ass was suddenly brought to his attention as Steve crooked his fingers (had to be three, at least three…) and then pressed tenderly against his prostate. A moan broke out, loud and wordless, into the bedroom and it took Tony a moment to realize it was his own voice.
, ah!” Tony continued to string together airy pants and pleas as Steve at last pushed inside. He could not seem to stop, his urgency being matched with Steve’s pace. A blur of full and empty, bursts of light in his vision with every thrust against his prostate, and the flurry of words ceaselessly coming from his mouth.
The future.
He approached his bed and picked up the cowl. It seemed to have been cleaned, but a faint remnant of blood could be seen on the inside. Steve’s stomach churned; he hadn’t thought to watch for Tony’s forehead injury. Not to mention those bruises…
Tony groaned weakly. His cock ached and his grip on Steve’s thighs tightened as he fought his urge to stroke himself over his pants.
Also, mentions of Steve's enhanced senses are inspired by
He pressed his nose against Tony’s ear. “Tony, I’m Captain America,” he whispered, before holding his breath. Waiting, listening, hoping.
“Sounds like your day is starting off hectic,” Steve whispered into Tony’s hair, pressing an indulgent kiss to the crown of his head.

Tony let out a choked whimper, looking away again. Steve felt an ember spark inside of him, wanting so much to
Tony hummed sleepily, eyes closed but hands still touching Steve’s body. Shoulder and hip.
“Alright. Alright.”
Tony took a quick inhale. “Uh, no. Not yet.” He looked down at Steve’s waiting hand for a moment, considering it, before taking it. Steve gave his hand a gentle, hopefully reassuring, squeeze. He looked up at Tony, who was still standing by the bed in front of him. Tony’s cheeks looked pale, like he hadn’t seen the sun in days, and his lips looked soft—they were almost red from being pinched between Tony’s teeth. Steve did not think Tony was aware of how much he abused his bottom lip. But, oh, Steve wanted so much to do that himself.
The fingers in his hair resumed petting him and Steve smiled. “You’re such a good boy, I can hardly imagine having to spank you,”
Thank you,
Tony shuddered, skin crawling at how he had allowed Steve (Cap!) to touch him. He felt utterly exposed, more than he did when he was buck naked in front of Steve last night.
Steve was surprised at how responsive Tony was to his words. He came with a shout and his raised arms shook before dropping down to the mattress. Steve removed his fingers and delicately stroked Tony through his orgasm, as white spurts shot over Tony’s expensive shirt. Steve crawled forward to lie by Tony’s side. “That was so good.” Steve whispered. He didn’t think before he brought one slick hand to stroke Tony’s hair, but Tony did not seem to mind, as he hummed blissfully under Steve’s touch.
For that brief moment, Steve wanted to collapse onto Tony, hold him for as long as he could, sweaty and sticky and all, kiss and bite and suck, without a care in the world. Maybe he could do that. Maybe.
“Tell me everything.” Natasha did not let Steve get in a word when he entered the common room. He exhaled heavily and sat on the couch across from her lounge chair.
“Yeah, J.” Tony left his perch on a barstool at his dining room to approach the penthouse elevator.
“Great,” Clint grumbled. “So, where are you planning on dropping us off? ‘Cause I’m going to need something with sleeves.”
“No, not at all, I’m just surprised that you picked the tiniest thing—how did you get to be this huge if you barely

Tony’s leash suddenly has slack. Tony opened his eyes, fingertips brushing Steve’s thighs plaintively. “No, wait, stop—” Tony began, pleading in a too-small voice. Steve froze, he was halfway to kneeling upright again. Tony’s forehead was still warm from their contact, now gone. Missing.
Client language(s): English, Italian, French, German, Russian
Tony set down the glass and looked at Steve. Their gaze held strong, neither of them speaking for a moment. Steve’s neck prickled, fearing that this would be the moment that Tony recognized him.
Steve arrives for their appointment, but makes Tony incredibly anxious when he wants to discuss the activities Tony requested for the evening. Very soft hurt/comfort. The sexytimes begins.
“Strawberry.” Tony said, mouth left softly open, breathing deeply as he watched Upside Down Steve apply strawberry flavoured lube to his large cock.
“What—” Tony began to stammer, eyes shifting and refusing to settle on Steve. He seemed to be struggling within the suit. “Come
Tony groaned, slouching over to lean against the side of the porcelain tub. “Just—can you get in here? With me?”
“Bite.” Steve’s voice was a breathy whisper. He brought his hand to the back of Tony’s head and growled when Tony tentatively dragged his teeth along his erect nipple while sucking. “Good fuckin’ boy.” Spurring Tony on, Steve reached down with his free hand to wrap it around Tony’s cock, its first touch tonight.
Steve was delighted. “I need to make sure you’re perfectly clean,” he said, and slid his hands back down to Tony’s ass. They both already knew Tony was immaculate when douching, that he was clean and ready for Steve to do what he liked with his hole, but that wasn’t the game at play. Steve spread his cheeks wide, exposing his hole and rubbing it with one thumb with just enough pressure for it not to be called gentle. When Tony moaned, Steve gave one wet cheek a warning pat.
“So, what happened?” Natasha asked, seated by a reasonable portion of pilaf from last night’s dinner order. She held her phone in her hand, not looking at Steve.
“Please, Sir.” Steve had whispered, his voice made soft with desperation. He was not sure what he had wanted.
“Excuse me, don’t think that just because I’m shorter than you automatically makes me the little spoon here. I could challenge stereotypes! Overcome the ideas of what a subby dude is ‘supposed’ to want or like, and—fuck, yeah I’m a little spoon.” Tony turned over on his side, back facing Steve. He looked over his shoulder expectantly.
Tony scrambled around the room to get dressed. He started shouting again as soon as he had boxers on. “Seriously, how could you actually— how long did you know I was Iron Man?”
Tony’s teeth dragged along Steve’s plump bottom lip as they pulled apart and opened their eyes. “… Very good.” Tony whispered, slightly breathless. Steve watched Tony’s mouth as he licked his own bottom lip. Tony pushed the wrist still held in Steve’s hand to drop Steve backward onto the lush mattress.
Steve would combust if he could, truly. He wanted so desperately to turn Tony in his arms, shake him by the shoulders, or maybe kiss him again. And
“Shh…” Steve’s voice was warm and soft. A gentle kiss was pressed to Tony’s cheek. “Wanted it to be easy for you to get back to sleep. Time’s almost up, but you need rest.”
Tony could not believe that he had gotten so clingy that morning he sent in that request for Steve again. How could anyone manage to read such a dense and obviously desperate list of Tony’s kinks? God, this was humiliating and not even in the fun way.
he remembered Steve’s reaction when he had pulled the leash taut, blocking his own breath in bursts as Steve fucked him for the second time last night.
“I… thought it would be safe. With you. If I cared for someone, I thought it would be good. And… it was. It was different from the other people I’d been with. You were different and I craved you every second I wasn’t with you.” Steve ran out of words, and Tony was standing stiffly, left hand clutching the edge of the countertop beside him.
“Oh, hey, Tony.” Clint said. Tony looked over and saw Clint wave. “Don’t usually see you around these parts.”
Steve lifted Tony’s hips to tug his pants and boxers down and off. Tony’s cock stood up, hard and red, dark. Steve wrapped his fingers around the base and Tony’s hips jerked up slightly. A small whimper passed Tony’s lips as Steve made himself comfortable between his knees, spreading Tony’s legs and running his free hand along Tony’s inner thigh.
His hand stilled.
Steve was already gone.
He was overthinking. He was always overthinking.
Steve then pulled back slightly to return with a shallow thrust into Tony’s throat, before pulling back out until only the head rested in Tony’s mouth. Tony did not seem able to resist swiping his tongue across it for a taste.
“Hands stay there. That’s your final warning.”
“Uh…” Tony’s voice came out cracked and small.

Tony started stroking himself eagerly then, remembering the look in Steve’s eyes when he was inside Tony, when he was holding him down, and when he was bathing him.

Tony stared at the sandwich and nodded. There was silence. Tony looked up at Steve to find that he was being stared down. He picked up the sandwich and took a large bite. Steve smiled then.
“Could make you blow me in exchange for a slap on the wrist… or maybe a spanking over my knee.
“Just tell me what you need tonight.” Steve whispered in his ear.
Tony grinned. “You jealous? Maybe next time I’ll lend you some, but since I paid for the overnight, I’ll get my money’s work of your ridiculous body.” Steve tilted his head, staring up at Tony. The tone sounded playful, but the words were… Steve did not know.

Tony was confused again. Why would Steve ask for a check-in? They were done with their scene. He just wanted—He wanted something. And he didn’t know what.
Tony shot off on a tangent, then. “Excuse me, don’t think that just because I’m shorter than you automatically makes me the little spoon here. I could challenge stereotypes! Overcome the ideas of what a subby dude is ‘supposed’ to want or like, and—fuck, yeah I’m a little spoon.” Tony turned over on his side, back facing Steve. Tony looked over his shoulder at Steve, expectantly.
Steve took a deep breath, remembering his place, his position of dominance. What Tony wanted. “Impatient, sweetheart?” Steve cooed, “I’ll take care of you, don’t you worry.”
“Good boy.”
Steve’s gorgeous, strong, warm hands supported Tony’s weight as he was guided off the bed and onto the soft carpet. Tony’s legs were quaking beneath him, but he hoped it wasn’t obvious. He walked by Steve’s side, enjoying his warmth. “Good boy, we’re almost there.”
Tony dropped himself back on the couch and continued to rub his palm over his crotch, breathing deeply, eyes heavy thinking about what might happen tomorrow. He hummed, squeezing himself through his jeans and then removed his hand with a groan.
“If… If it is an arc reactor thing… I hope I eventually show you that you can trust me with seeing your chest.”
I kick your asses.”
Steve reached forward and rested one hand on Tony’s shoulder again, gently squeezing. “Bite.”
Tony smiled softly and brought one hand down to test the water. It was deliciously warm, and bubbles were slowly forming by the faucet.
Tony keened downward, melting against Steve’s warm body. He was growing hard and he could feel Steve’s cock hardening against his thigh. The hand on Tony’s ass pulled him down, grinding their bodies together.
Steve dropped the working end of his ropes and brought one hand to cup himself. He closed his eyes and recalled how delicate Tony’s breathing was, how hard and red his cock was, how his eyes were dazed and wet when Steve came inside him for a third time. He inhaled deeply and squeezed himself firmly through his jeans. He hummed and slid his free hand down his left thigh and dipped his fingertips under the rope wrapped around it.
Steve’s social isolation did not last long once they had all moved into the tower. Natasha and he struck up a friendship. They ran missions as a pair many times for Director Fury, and she consistently encouraged him to explore the future, even try to date.
Tony was nodding furiously, desperately rolling his hips, spreading his legs for Steve again. The sooner Steve was inside him, the sooner he would have permission to come. Steve positioned himself between Tony’s legs again, the head of his cock brushing against Tony’s sensitized hole. Tony’s eyes closed momentarily, relishing the sensation and anticipating the feeling of fullness that was about to come.
“Tony, relax. Do you have normal food somewhere?” Steve’s hand squeezed Tony’s shoulder and Tony’s mind went blank for just a moment.
He froze for a moment. The two couches surrounding the table, and the table itself, were all bare – not a blanket, a book, or an abandoned sock in sight. This might not have been a good spot to place an important item; if it were Tony, the cowl would go overlooked for weeks if not months.
Steve started stroking Tony’s dick steadily, slowly. Tony left out a huff of breath, eyes closed, hips jerking up. Steve used his left hand to find the bottle of lube once again and slick up his fingers. “I—” Tony cut himself off when Steve’s finger found Tony’s hole. “N—f-fuck.”
“Didn’t know you could text, old man.”
Steve grinned devilishly as he settled each knee on either side of Tony’s hips. Tony wondered what Steve would do. Would Steve ride him? No, he doubted it.
Content warning:
Back at the Tower, Tony stepped into his shower with a sigh of relief. Hot water stung on his scalp, but he stood there until the pink water running down his skin turned clear. When he emerged and approached the mirrored wall, Tony froze.
Steve had certainly been surprised to hear that Natasha had such a connection, but in retrospect, he should not have been.
. Whether or not Tony agreed, he appreciated it all the same. “I’ve got you. I'll take care of you.”
Heat rushed to Steve’s cheeks and his cock; a flurry of thoughts and feelings that he could not name at the thought of bruises he left on Tony.
Soon, Steve heard the bathroom door open again and a soft towel being placed beside him on the bed. “Your turn.” Tony said.
Pepper is present in person for the first time in this whole series in this chapter! I'm already working on a bit of a prequel that further explores Tony and Pepper's relationship history, I'll post it as it's own fic but included in the series, as it will build on this world.
When he woke, in SHIELD’s care, as they put it, he poured his focus into preparing himself for the world. He was given cultural briefings in the form of thick bundles of papers he was meant to read and suddenly understand the world he woke up in. SHIELD provided him with a headshrinker, but the man felt too eager to be speaking to him and it made Steve wary that he would be the type to be seconds from pulling out collectible Captain America merchandise for him to autograph. Steve read, fiction and non-fiction, on an electronic tablet SHIELD provided him with, to immerse him in the technology of the time he had been thrust into. After the screen of the first tablet they provided was cracked when Steve swiped away aggressively from a tasteless “news” article, it was replaced with a tablet that was fortified by a metal casing and came with a rubber-tipped stylus for use on the screen rather than his fingers.
He took an atypically long shower, scrubbing himself down to feel fresh again before his appointment with Tony again this evening. Their second consecutive night together, which should truly be their last.
Steve moaned as he felt wet heat shoot into his boxers, still in his jeans.
“That’s right,” Steve said gruffly, thumb tapping on Tony’s left cheekbone, “And I think I need convincing of what your mouth can do other than senselessly beg.”
again? Oh right— visual lie detecting. Seriously, those people are so paranoid—”
The women Tony usually hired from this service were often his height, brunettes, dainty and dressed in delicate evening gowns with sheer stockings and garter belts that drove him crazy. He enjoyed romancing them for the evening (‘the girlfriend treatment’, they would tease) and taking them to his bed.
His mouth watered at the thought of Steve’s dick, heavy and hard on his tongue. He imagined Steve keeping him on his knees, mouth open wide for Steve’s pleasure and abuse.
Steve reached out to touch Tony’s elbow, just for a quick second, smiling. “Tell me what you’d like to talk about.”
Tony’s face crunched up at that. “M’not sweet.”
When he emerged from the bathroom, he found Tony lying under the sheets with his eyes closed. Steve carefully tried to slide into the bed without disturbing Tony, unsure if the man had fallen asleep. When Steve’s knee dipped the mattress, Tony’s eyes opened.
Oh. Well. Good to know.
“You’re taking it so well, Tony, I should’ve known. Without your suit, you’re nothing but a cock-hungry slut.”
Tony mentally facepalmed himself. He had multiple degrees. He was a successful businessman. He certainly must have had picked up at least one or two social skills in his time on earth. Apparently, they didn’t extend to this situation – horny, deprived, and being straddled and dirty talked to by a blonde god.
Tony whined softly and Steve pushed hard into Tony’s wet heat, steady and pounding. They fell into a harsh rhythm, Tony groaning and moaning around Steve’s cock, taking in tiny gasps of air when Steve let up minisculely for him. Steve roughed up his throat, pulling and pushing Tony with two fists in his hair; all the while Tony held Steve’s hips tightly, fingers digging in as he fights the urge to touch himself, no doubt.
“Well, I was thinking that you and I could try something new tonight.”
Tony curled his fingers into an “O” and tapped his lips a couple of times, eyebrows raised. Clint smiled and jumped over the back of the couch to approach Tony at the kitchen table.
“Well, I haven’t had my morning coffee. I had a
He must have dozed off, because he opened his eyes to see Steve climbing onto the mattress. He still shone a little from the shower, but he didn’t drip. His hair appeared towel-dried and tousled in a way that Tony wanted to have done himself. Tony’s eyes travelled down the stretch of Steve’s neck, across his bare broad shoulders. He was tempted to bite down onto Steve’s neck once he got within range. Steve’s chest and abs were absolutely delicious, and as Tony found his way down to Steve’s flaccid cock, his mouth practically watered.

. And that would certainly be saying something.”
“I know, Tony, I know,
“Stay?”
Tony. The thought of that made him shiver. He had let Steve hold him, guide him, wash him,
, Tony thought just as one of Steve’s hands came up to cup one of his pecs. His thumb started rubbing his nipple gently at first, and Tony took a deep breath, focusing. Tried to focus. Could not focus.
She nodded. “I know. We can make sure legal is explicit about the limitations of licensed usage.”
“I’m happy you want to, sweetheart, daddy pretty much would like to play too,” Steve stated with a grin from ear to ear. “Would you let me hold you?” he asked.
“Well, you’ve never asked such a thing,” Steve commented, standing up.
Okay, Tony had to admit it, he had played dirty, so he shouldn’t be complaining. But it hadn’t been fair, Steve was freakishly strong and he could flatten the boxes with his bare hands unlike Tony, who had to step on most of them to obtain the same result. Steve’s pile of boxes had been obviously bigger than his, and Tony just couldn’t sit back and do nothing. While he was retrieving another box, the said RC car had materialized under it and the temptation had been too big not to succumb to it. Tony had taken the remote and had sent the car right into Steve’s pile.
“First eat the one you have there, it’s going to get cold,” Steve warned.
“No, I’d be a daddy. A very good one, if I may say so,” Steve assured, leaning a bit so he could speak to Tony in the ear, “and you know what daddies do when stubborn kids don’t do as they’re told?” he asked, Tony shook his head as an answer, “they-tickle-them-until-they-agree-to-obey,” he informed slurring fast so Tony didn’t have time to react to what he was about to do.
"No?" Steve echoed, "You don't want me to look after him?"
“No, and with that endless list I assure you I won’t be watching any movie twice, at least not any time soon,” Steve emphasized. He took one more gaze at Tony before fixing his eyes on the screen again, something Tony was grateful for.
- - - -
Saw any mistakes? Please let me know, I'll truly appreciate it :)
“NOO!”
“I don’t.”
“I’m sorry Sir, but you could really have some rest before going back to the workshop.”
- - - -
That would definitely explain a lot of Tony’s odd behavior, and nothing would make Steve happier than Tony changing his mind about not wanting them to try Age Play. It was nice to hang out with Clint when he was Little, but Steve still believed it would be much better if it was Tony instead of Clint.
Internet was reaaaaally slow today, so I couldn't really work. I decided to write instead XD.
Four updates in a row, yay! XD I can't even believe it myself. Buuut... I'm gonna have a lot of work the next following weeks and also, Kingdom Hearts III was just released this week (any fans here?) sooo, I might not be able to get around to writing as often as I've been doing this year. I'll try though.
Steve couldn’t help noticing there was something really off about the way Tony was behaving lately. Little things that might not be considered weird themselves, however, coming from Tony, they gave the impression there was something fishy going on.
Perhaps that was one of the things that was stopping him. Once he used the diaper, Tony knew there was no turning back. Steve wouldn't listen to him anymore if Tony called him by his name instead of daddy while they age played, so he got the feeling he wouldn't be allowed to go to the bathroom once he showed he was okay with going in his diaper.
Steve came out of the elevator, thankful for not running into anybody on his way, and went straight to his room. Balancing Tony on his hip to free one of his hands, he used the free one to open a drawer and take out all the supplies he needed. He sat down on the bed, but when he made an attempt to put Tony down, his little boy opened his eyes immediately and clung tightly to his t-shirt.
“Don’t want” Tony refused, the words muffled, hands clutching tighter to his t-shirt.
“Steve, he loves you, he’d do anything you ask,” Phil assured, hitting another nail on the head.
“I’m not going to be mad or anything, baby, I promise,” Steve assured, and he meant it. Even if the reason turned out to be something completely flimsy and senseless, Steve would never hold a grudge. That’d only continue the vicious circle they’d gotten themselves into. “I just want to know so we can fix this once and for all,” he said, and he could feel Tony tensing.
And when Steve had thought nothing could make that evening worse, Tony went and had an accident. During all the time they’d age played before Tony decided he wanted to stop, he’d never lost control of his bladder, but of course that had to happen on that very day, because Steve’s luck wasn’t as good as everyone seemed to think it was.
So, Tony shyly nodded.
The proof was in the way Tony behaved during their last play dates, which wasn’t all that different from before to be honest, but it was in the details where Steve could tell nothing was he same. Like the way Tony pronounced the word ‘daddy’, it didn’t sound unnatural or forced anymore, it sounded as if the word had stopped feeling weird on Tony’s lips and now its pronunciation was full of love and adoration. Or the way Tony reached for him, he no longer waited for Steve to be the one who took the first step; Tony lifted his arms whenever he wanted to be picked up, he sat down on his lap on his own accord when it was time to eat, he snuggled into him when he wanted Steve to rock him to sleep.
“Do you trust me?” Steve questioned with a tone of voice that gave Tony the feeling Steve doubted what his answer was. Tony pulled away just enough to be able to see his face, brow furrowed in confusion. “Do you?”
“Come again?”
, a little voice in his head said, and Tony knew exactly what it meant. Tony had never stopped wanting to be Steve’s baby. Logic and caution had told him to get away from that sort of relationship before it was too late, before everything went downhill, but some part of him wished to continue even though things turned out badly. Not for nothing it had been impossible for him to keep himself away from anything related to Age Play, to stopped missing Daddy even when he had Steve around.
- - - -
Although they would never reach that point if Steve kept stalling the talk, if he just kept tricking Tony into have moments like this. Yes, they were great, but they would be much better once Tony knew the whole thing.
“I’d like to talk to you about something,” Steve informed, moving looking for a more comfortable position. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.”
“It’s not that, it’s just–,” Clint trailed off, taking some seconds to put his thoughts in order. “Just don’t tell anybody. That’s it. I really don’t mind you knowing, but I guess I’d feel kind of weird if somebody else knows. I mean, it’s not like I’m planning on being little in front of anybody besides Phil, so I think it wouldn’t make much of a difference, but even so…” he stated, babbling a bit.
"But," Tony was ready to argued when Steve hurried and placed a finger over his lips, indicating him he was not going to take any of that.
Just a couple of weeks later, Phil called him in the dead of the night to ask him to go and check on Clint. Apparently, Phil had JARVIS inform him whenever Clint wasn’t doing OK so he could always go and help him deal with whatever Clint was struggling with. Though that night Phil had been very far away from New York and he soonest he could arrive to the Tower was until next morning. He didn’t want Clint to be all alone until then, not when he was feeling little.
“Yay!” Clint exclaimed, making Steve smile. It was still astounding how Clint could change his mood at the drop of a hat when he was little.
Putting Tony to sleep wasn’t any easier than it had been earlier that day, he’d gotten pretty clingy throughout the course of the evening to the point of being shamelessly whiny if Steve stopped petting him, cuddling him, kissing him or doing any sort of display of affection for more than five minutes, but it wasn’t like Steve minded at all. That was why, after several failed attempts, Steve decided to climb into the crib with Tony and let him practically roll over him, perhaps as a way to assure he wouldn’t sneak out on him while he slept.
With his own hands, Tony crushed every single one of the bars of the crib and threw the pieces around the room. The pillows and the mattress were ripped open and the stuffing was yanked out easily, until they were empty shells with nothing left inside. The rocking chair and the changing table were used as a baseball bat and baseball respectively, neither one of them looked like they used to after all the batting. The wallpaper was torn off meticulously, until the only thing that could be seen was were the a white walls. All the bottles, diapers, and other supplies that were kept in the changing table drawers had been piled up and turned into ash – well, Tony might have made use of the repulsor beams, but only a little. Everything was completely destroyed. Total destruction was necessary in order to avoid anything possibly being fixed.
Distrusting everyone in order to avoid being disappointed yet once more was a pretty understandable coping mechanism, and Steve didn’t judge Tony in the slightest for acquiring it. However, the fact that Steve comprehended hadn’t made Tony’s supposition any less painful.
But now, Steve could ensure Tony did. And if Tony could already reach that state of mind, well, Steve figured it was alright to take things a little bit further. Maybe having a nursery would come in handy. Maybe the more realistic this was, the easier it would be for Tony to ease himself into his little headspace and stay like that a bit longer.
“Sorry if you came to hang out with him, but I’d rather you postpone whatever it was what you’d planned to do,” Phil asked, still murmuring. Now that Steve was closer to them, he could see Clint was sucking his thumb, which only confused him more. What exactly was happening here? “The last mission was a hard one, and he was having nightmares all night,” he sighed. “In short, he was having a very bad day. So, I want him to sleep as much as possible,” he finished saying, hushing Clint tenderly when the latter twitched in his sleep. “Is there something wrong?” Phil questioned, looking up at Steve. He had just stayed there, staring at them without doing or saying anything.
“Clint! No running inside!” Steve scolded, though he knew he would let him run as much as he wanted if that prevent him from continuing crying. Man! He would even race him if that helped.
By the time the ship landed, Tony still had nothing.
“Here you are,” Tony said to himself when he found it, selecting the save button right away. Now the only thing he had to do was logging into his email and attach the file. “JARVIS, why didn’t you notified me I had a lot of emails?” Tony asked once he saw his inbox. This was exactly why he sometimes abstained from getting his hands on any device, he tended to waste a lot of time checking and answering emails.
(See the end of the chapter for
If you spot any mistakes, please let me know :D
“Where do you think you’re going?” Steve asked, catching Tony by the ankle as a measure to prevent another escape attempt. Tony shook his leg a few times to try to release it from Steve’s hand, but the grasp was firm and steady and wouldn’t allow it to happen.
As usual, let me know if there are any mistakes, it would help me a lot :)
,” Tony clarified, maybe sounding a bit too brusque.
His chest tightness worsened, more tears flooded his eyes and his legs became so wobbly that Tony had no other option than to plop down right there on the floor, finding himself with no strength to leave that room as he wanted to. Daddy had set up that nursery especially for him, and Tony’s heart sunk as he realized there was a high possibility he would never get to use it properly.
“You should apologize,” Phil stated.
____________
“I don’t like it!” Clint whined, flopping down on the floor a bit too dramatically, hands still struggling with the straps. Steve sighed deeply, and he decided it was not worth the trouble. Clint wouldn’t be able to unbuckle it and Steve was actually glad of that. The last time he had babysat him, Clint had thought it would be funny to get undressed and run naked all around the living room. Phil hadn’t found that funny at all.
"That's it, you can go," Steve announced, giving Clint a playful smack on his behind when he turned around to go and sit down on the floor in front of the TV. His diapered bottom.
“Don't forget to wash your hands!” Steve said as he rolled the diaper he just took off from Tony. Even if it wasn't wet, Steve liked to use a fresh one when he re-diapered him. He might as well avoid the trouble and change to pull-ups until Tony decided he was ready to make the transition – if he ever did – it would be certainly save Steve time and effort, but he figured it would just discourage Tony more. The more realistic everything was, the better.
“The freaking bed got in my way,” Tony explained, sitting on the edge of the bed, his feet still in his hand. Steve couldn’t help chuckling, he would never understand how Tony always managed to bump into things in his own room. “Did you move it?” Tony accused.
The nursery. Tony never went there willingly, not really. Maybe when he was completely into his Little headspace, but never when he was wavering in between his Little and adult mindset. Why was he there now? A tiny part of him wished that he had gone there to relax or something, that Tony was finally coming to terms with this side of him, but deep down Steve knew that wasn't the reason.
Steve usually trained on his own for a couple of hours – at least – before he sparred with somebody, otherwise, by the time the session was over, he felt like he hadn’t exercise at all. However, Clint had been the one who had showed up in the communal living room looking for someone to train with, and as Bruce hadn’t seemed interested in that at all – he disliked to do anything that involved aggressiveness – Steve had felt obligated to go along with the proposal. It was just fair, Clint was the one who usually agreed to do anything Steve suggested when he was bored too.
Not the proposal Tony had in mind at all. Half an hour later, Tony found himself with a book on his lap and a sleeping Steve next to him.
His breath hitched on a sob, and Tony reached for daddy’s pillow, pressed his face into it and curled into a little ball before he began crying freely, JARVIS’ reassurances going almost unnoticed.
And because Tony's luck always sucked, that was the kind of dream he had just had.
? Was this how it felt to be in a little headspace? It couldn't be, Tony wasn't even sure if he was going to be able to slip into such a headspace. Perhaps it was just embarrassment caused by being self-conscious of how odd all this could actually be, his boyfriend was referring to himself as his
It had been one of those rare nights when Tony had left the workshop by his own decision and had gotten into bed at a pretty reasonable hour. That didn’t mean his head was off of whatever he was working on at the time, so he usually had his tablet or cell phone with him, and typed until late at night. Once he finished, there were two options: Tony would either get to sleep to try to make up for all his previous sleepless nights, or do exactly what he was doing now, demand attention.
But it hadn’t. It happened after
“Du-dum-dummy!” Tony managed to say.
That shouldn’t be a big deal. Steve had been more than happy to end their day having a play date, and Tony couldn’t deny it had been a pleasant afternoon. The thing was that Tony still couldn’t figure out what sent him into that mindset, and not being able to control it led him to the second problem he had with all this: what if one day he felt little and Steve wasn’t anywhere around?
After twenty minutes, concern was eating Steve away to the point that he had decided to knock the door down. Breaking and destroying things wasn’t something he liked to do, though he just couldn’t stand hearing Clint cry on the other side and do nothing to comfort him. Fortunately, the strength he possessed allowed him to simply force the door instead of knocking it down. He stepped into the bathroom and found Clint curled up in the bathtub, sobbing miserably. Feeling sorry for him, Steve rushed towards the bathtub with the intention of cuddling Clint in his arms, but when he leaned forward to put Tony down, Tony hadn’t let him.
Fortunately, Tony consented.
Tony hesitated for a millisecond, but he ended up leaning on Steve’s chest and letting the latter feed him until his plate was completely empty.
Ever since that afternoon with Clint, Tony was determined to play his role better. Seeing Clint while he was in his little headspace had showed Tony how Age Play was supposed to be, and he couldn't help noticing that what he had been doing so far wasn't exactly being little. Tony let Steve bathe him, feed him, carry him, dress him and even diaper him, but it was pretty much that. Without a doubt, Tony had started to feel little, a shame that feeling little and being little wasn’t precisely the same, and Tony figured that was the nub of the issue.
“You’ll see,” Steve said right before he raised his hands in order to uncover Tony’s eyes.
This was another kind of intimacy, a much deeper one; one that Steve truly appreciated and understood.  Tony might be a little too carefree about who he shared the bed with when he wasn’t in a committed relationship, but this, well, under no circumstance would Tony share this with anyone. It would leave him too vulnerable, too exposed, and someone like him simply couldn’t afford to do that. Allowing Steve to see him in such state just told him how much trust Tony had put in him.
“Oh, don’t worry baby, I don’t mind at all,” Steve reassured. “I wouldn’t trade an afternoon playing with my baby boy for nothing.” He brushed another kiss now over the top of his head.
“It’s not that,” Tony said, looking down at the tiles like if they were the most interesting thing in the world, perhaps to try to hide the fact that he was blushing a little, irrefutable proof that he had liked Steve’s gestures more than he would let himself admit. “It’s just that–” he trailed off, failing to put his thoughts in order.
Unfortunately, this particular craving turned out to be more difficult than the others.
His father couldn’t hurt him anymore, not when he had passed away long ago. The Chitauri wouldn’t be much of a threat once Tony suited up. The kidnappers would fade away from his mind once his brain became aware of his whereabouts. Yes, everything he saw while he was sleeping could be minimized, he wouldn’t let his brain catastrophize anything. That technique seemed to work better than trying not to dream at all, though it did have one flaw: how could you rationalize a nightmare you didn’t remember?
"Are you sure?" he questioned, just in case. His baby's blush intensified slightly as he nodded almost imperceptibly. "Okay. But remember, if you stop feeling comfortable, you can always change, Daddy wouldn’t mind, okay, baby?" Tony nodded once more.
“What the actual fuck?!” Tony exclaimed when he saw five signatures on the same sheet, the curse word feeling wrong on his tongue. Seriously, how could he space out that badly? This thing of not being able to control at will when to be little was utterly annoying.
“No what?”
Things got even worse after that day, at least from Tony’s perspective. Besides constantly finding himself wanting to suck his thumb, hug a stuffed animal or run to Steve’s – daddy’s – arms; now, every time he knew Steve was going to be away for at least a day, Tony felt very tempted to go to the nursery and nap in the crib. He knew he shouldn’t, if he was ever going to leave all that stupid Age Play thing behind he couldn’t continue allowing himself to succumb to those urges anymore.
“Sir, are you–”
Anybody else would have thought all of that was just weird, but not Steve. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that the 20th century had turned out to be a fairly enriching experience – as well as stressing, but that had already been left behind – and Steve had learned not to be shocked by anything anymore, not when he was living in a free world where everything, everything, seemed to be possible.
Did Steve miss Tony that much? Well, apparently, he did. He wasn’t handling this situation as well as he had thought. They hadn’t broken up or anything of the sort, their romantic relationship was pretty much stable as far as Steve concerned. Their daddy-baby relationship, on the other hand, had been practically non-existent. The decision Tony had made had been decisive, and ever since that day, Steve hadn’t had the chance to hang out with his baby.
“Party pooper,” Tony complained. “Seriously Cap, couldn't you wait until I finish? Everything that doesn't involve nudity can wait.”
“You can count on that,” Steve agreed again.
“As I was saying, I don’t think what Howard made you believe was right. There’s nothing wrong with this. And I meant what I said, I do want to help you, Tony. I want to make you understand this is totally fine. I hope you let me help you.”
Apparently, that had been the right thing to say, because, all of a sudden, Tony pushed the pillow away and threw himself to his arms, clinging to him almost desperately. It hurt, the broken ribs and scratches were still there, but it was nothing Steve couldn’t bear, so he remained quiet and let himself melt into the hug as much as Tony was. God, Steve had sure missed this!
“Rocking chair, one, Raawry, two,” Steve recalled as he showed his index and middle finger to emphasize the quantity, “you see, two and the deal were three. Which one is the third one?” he asked, and he couldn’t help feeling more confused when Tony limited himself to slam the rail of the crib with his free hand, his lower lip pushed out even more.
“And second,” Steve proceeded, ignoring Tony’s last comment, “A lot of people give teddy bears on Valentine’s Day, it’s like a very typical present,” Steve indicated.
“And then I can play video games?”
Every time Tony played, Steve couldn’t help noticing certain tension in him, as though he was uncomfortable. That tension eased a bit when Steve joined him, but Steve couldn’t help thinking there was something a bit odd in the way Tony interacted with the toys.
“What the fuck?! Put me down right now!” Kicking was never going to do anything to Steve, but at least he had to do something to try get rid of his grip. Steve didn’t even bother to answer. “JARVIS, close the door!” He demanded when he realized Steve started walking toward it.
The problem was when the idea that had grown in his brain was something Tony wasn’t willing to do, something he didn’t want to carry out, because no matter how much he tried to get rid of that thought, the more he ignored it, the bigger it grew.
Why was Clint there? Wasn't Jarvis supposed to denied all access when Steve and he were in the middle of a play date? Or had Steve been the one who had let him in? Why? Tony might not have cared that Phil and Clint knew what Steve and he were doing – after all, they were into the same thing anyway – thought that didn’t mean Tony was willing to hang out with them. Not yet at least.
“Then I’ll read one of those, pick one, whichever you want,” Phil suggested, earning a glare from Clint.
And the diapers. Tony couldn’t figure out why he wanted to wear them. Diapers were for babies, for God’s sake! Well, and for adults too, but for very old adults who couldn’t control their bodily functions, and he wasn’t either of them. He could excuse himself a little bit by saying he just wanted them because they would help him with his occasional bedwetting problem, but deep inside he knew that wasn’t the real reason.
“If you spill the juice, I’m not cleaning it up,” Steve warned, already having given up. Little Clint was very stubborn, and if Steve didn’t want to spend the rest of the afternoon in the kitchen, he might as well let him drink from a glass.
Phil preferred to ignore that accusation, and kept eating his lunch while he waited for Clint to stop whining. If he continued insisting him on stopping that nonsense and go back to the table, it would be worse. After fifteen minutes of hearing Clint calling him a liar, a meany, and many other things – something that Phil never took as an offense, since he was perfectly aware of the fact that Clint’s crankiness was the one that was talking, not him – he seemed to calm down. Phil beckoned to him and smiled when Clint didn’t hesitate to stand up and walk towards him.
