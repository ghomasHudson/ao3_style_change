He thinks about Steve’s hands on him, in the shower, washing him so delicately, almost reverently. The way he shined, maybe only in Tony’s mind.
He feels like he’d have no problem letting Steve fuck him, but when he tries to imagine it, the Steve in his mind morphs with someone who looks like him but isn’t him, and Tony allows himself a soft moan of terror.
So yeah, it’s great. Tony really feels like this could go on forever if they were, uh, not Avengers, you know. They’ve been lucky, so far, with their free time, but they can’t keep this routine up indefinitely, it will mess with their work life. It’s messing with them, in a way, too.
“It’s fucked up, that I have to keep up this fake image but… I can’t think of ever going out there without this particular armor. Feed my real self to those sharks, I can’t do it.”
. Steve’s words, while spoken in a soft undertone, sound rehearsed, prepared, carefully chosen. It’s the first time Steve mentions the man. “But you were dreaming about doing it again. You were talking... You often seem to dream about… And I want you to know that if you want to do it, if you really want to do it, I’d be by your side. Always.”
That’s why Tony sighs and fishes his phone out of his pocket while Steve stares at medieval frescos. That’s why Steve draws while Tony works on his tablet, or welds pieces of armor in his workshop.
She disappears again. A few minutes later, she’s dressed and ready to leave. She puts a bottle of Gatorade on the desk in front of Bucky. “Don’t forget that,” she tells him. “Would love to stay and chat, but Rhodes is waiting for me,” she says to Steve and Tony. Then, she turns to Bucky. “You’re gonna be fine?”
“I can confirm!” Natasha shouts from the bathroom. She appears in the frame shortly after, wearing a red bathrobe. She pushes her hand into Bucky’s hair, and kisses him. He kisses her back.
For the first time since that day when that SHIELD agent wanted to trick him into thinking it was still the 40s, Steve feels like he hasn’t been misplaced, like he’s not clinging to his past out of sheer stubbornness and sadness, like he doesn’t need to desperately try to go back home or force someone else to be the carefree boy he used to be before unspeakable trauma, like he isn’t here just waiting for his life to suddenly snap back to normal.
It’s dark in Steve’s bedroom, the only source of light is nestled in Tony’s chest. Steve doesn’t think, and places a hand on it.
He gets back to the blanket on the grass, to Steve. He’s drawing, he must’ve gone back into the guest house to retrieve his sketchbook and pencils. He’s taken off his shoes.
Tony sees what’s happening just at the right moment, at the right breath. Just in time. He thinks the right thing, moves the right way, and he fires, and the head of the man that raped him for four months and twelve days (that’s one hundred and thirty-five times, Tony thinks just now for the first time) explodes barely a second before Steve’s shield can cut it clean off the neck.
It’s always great, because they’re in love and they love having sex with each other, but even for Steve it’s starting to feel a bit like a chore. They both want it to be more— spontaneous, Tony thinks.
When he closes the door of the workshop behind him, Steve finds himself immersed in blue light. Tony is at the center of the room, sitting on a stool, moving his arms in every direction to send inputs to the system. It’s a thinking spree then, not a building one. It’s all theory right now, it’s all in the mind.
He looks down at himself, and sure enough, his cock is slowly filling out with blood. He touches it dubiously, tugs at it lazily, but despite the nice spark of pleasure it gives him for a moment, it soon goes back to hanging limply between his thighs.
Steve, the Steve inside Tony’s mind, presses his chest against Tony’s back, engulfing him in a beautiful warmth. It would be like yesterday, while Tony was cooking the fish, but more. So much more.
They’re in the middle of nowhere. There’s the road, a few cars passing by. There’s the endless countryside, the Po valley all around them for miles and miles. The Alps are barely visible behind them; the heat in the air smudges their shape in the horizon.
Then, he turns to Steve and lifts his hand, the other cherry softly held between his thumb and middle finger, a gesture so graceful that it surprises Steve in its simple elegance.
There’s twelve of them. The Knights of the Order of the Sword, the most loyal servants of the King, his personal guards and most cruel warriors. I’ve heard stories about them, war stories, and each one made me want to throw up.
Tony’s sob is loud in the silence of the living room, and watching him like this, succumbing to his exhaustion, without knowing how to help, makes something clench around Steve’s heart.
He calms down only when Howard is away. When we are alone, it's a thought the world disappears, and we are just a mom and a child. I play piano for him and I pretend I don't see him looking at me from the sofa, making up some joke to make me laugh or shock me, or choosing some crazy prank to tell me about.
“Yeah. It has,” Steve says, pressing his lips together in a discontentment Tony can’t explain at first.
Tony’s shoulder is close to his, but not enough that they could bump together, even by mistake. Steve can still smell Tony, of course, the room is full of his scent, but the intensity of it is completely different from what a shirt Tony’s been wearing on and off for three days would have done pressed to Steve’s nose. A firecracker and an atomic bomb.
Tony lets Steve take his hand and guide him to the bed, falls on top of him and presses his hips into Steve, like he did that first time, and yet not at all like that first time. Steve groans, deep in his chest, and reaches into his nightstand for the bottle of lube he keeps there, in the first drawer. Steve passes the bottle to Tony, who takes it uncertainly, stares at it, sits up, then pushes it back into Steve’s hand.
“This thing is taking its toll on you both. I’m not urging you to forgive to just quiet your mind—if you can’t do it, then you’re allowed not to. But do something about this, Tony. You need to let this go, one way or the other, before it blows up in your faces and hurts you even more. Especially if you’ll need to fight side by side in any case.”
“I didn’t know how to say it, back then. You seemed like you didn’t want to hear it. Then we had to save the universe, and after that... we slipped into this, uh, sort of, um, acquaintancesh—”
Tony closes his eyes against the empty room, touches the wrinkled part of his t-shirt. It’s warmer than the rest.
She hides her face behind a fist. Her frustration is so evident, and the need to make it better for her, to gather her in his arms and reassure her, keeps Steve from processing the information for a minute.
“I just want you to use my name. So I don’t think about all the years we kept each other at arm’s length.”
Steve talks to him one night, after waking Tony up from a nightmare that left him covered in cold sweat, thirsty, and with his heart racing in his chest. There are tears on his face, and Tony could swear they’re tears of joy.
“Then we came back. And he saw Sarah for the first time. It made him so happy, despite everything. So his body… elaborated the loss. He adjusted.”
After dinner, they go back to the guest house. Steve changes out of his jeans and into the sweatpants he sleeps in. Tony, instead, locks himself in the bathroom to put on his pajamas.
Tony stretches out on the bed, then curls up against Steve’s side. Steve strokes his back, revels in how warm his skin is.
Steve’s arms used to be the safest place he could think of. He used to long for something like this, for one single real hug from him. He used to think,
“Yeah, I mean, when you see all those people, so young, bright, full of potential, you wish you could give them the world, you know? But all these idiotic politics keeps them limited… it’s sad, really—”
“You could breastfeed her this time around, too. We’d be the happiest family. Me, you, Sarah, and Maria. Perfect.”
, a voice says, booming against the stones, echoing through the cave in waves of sound that rattle Tony’s bones. It’s all wrong, low and mean, it takes the shade of an ugly purple in Tony’s mind.
“I haven’t been… God, I’ve been such a hypocrite. I accused you of lying but… I haven’t been entirely sincere either. I’m sorry.”
Tony turns his head towards him, and it’s more a press of lips against Steve’s hair than an actual kiss, but he breathes Steve’s scent in, and almost wishes, uselessly, that it didn’t feel like home and peace this much.
“No. It’s not my heart,” Tony says with a tone of finality, and Steve decides not to press the matter further when Tony speaks again. “It’s psychological. PTSD-related.”
Tony stares into Steve’s eyes for longer than he probably should. He’s never seen him more determined.
“Come on,” he says, and his voice isn’t urging or encouraging, it’s soft and quiet and kind like a caress, like a kiss, almost like a prayer.
“I know. But there’s more at play than just that. You’re not just consenting to sex. You’re consenting to repairing the bond in full. You’d be mates.”
—walk away, out of the Piazza. He watches Tony sit back on the ground, wait for Steve to come back with the water.
Tony comes in Steve’s mouth about twenty minutes later, still wearing the cock cage. His dick still doesn’t reach a full erection, but it hasn’t been this hard for this long in
And stop thinking the exact same things he used to think ten years ago, effectively proving to himself how he wasted a good part of his life being mad at Steve and hurting their daughter and learning absolutely nothing from it.
Steve starts kissing Tony’s neck, his shoulders, licks carefully behind his ear, buries his nose in Tony’s gray hair and inhales deeply, flooding all his senses with the love of his life. His hand moves slowly on Tony’s abdomen, the muscles there rounder than a few years ago, molded by time so that Steve’s hand can fit on them perfectly.
He practically runs into the bathroom, shutting the door with too much force, discouraging Steve from any kind of reply.
Tony just waits by the window, kissing the head of his daughter and not thinking about how much she looks like her father.
Tony scoffs, amused at Bucky’s tone but also still a bit bitter for all the things he wishes had gone in another way. “I’m sorry, too. It was… it was fucked up, and that’s…”
Afterwards, it’s not awkward. Tony makes a small joke, helps Steve up. Steve heads for the gym showers and Tony for the elevator. In the following days nothing really changes between them, maybe they’re a bit more polite than usual, but they’re normal, really. And if Steve goes tense every time Tony enters a room, it’s no one’s business but his own, okay? Okay.
“No, I just…” Oh, to hell with it. It’s the only chance he gets at being fucked by Steve Rogers, and he’s not going to waste it. Might as well try to get a good pounding. If he asks nicely, Steve will probably be kind enough to go along with it, he’s been nothing but patient with Tony’s nonsense so far. “It’s fine. I just didn’t expect you to be so—”
“I don’t know if I should tell you this, but... that was the first time I could do… anything… since that night—that night at the compound when we… So that’s why I went along with it and couldn’t, uh, control myself. It’s not enough, I know, but it’s the only, uh... redeeming factor I’ve got.”
There were about five hundred other solutions to this issue that Tony could have found, if he wanted. Another orphanage. People who wanted to adopt. Countless others.
Tony slips his boxers on, and looks at Steve while he draws in a sigh that could be relief just as well as disappointment. His eyes dart to Tony’s bruised hip, but then he catches himself and quickly looks up, at Tony’s face, but not his eyes.
Steve extends a shaky arm towards him, and there’s a split second of indecision before Tony goes to it. He kneels on the bed, walks on his knees across the mattress until he can take Steve’s hand in his own.
He was prepared for it to hurt, to burn, for his insides to resist with how dry he is, but… no. His body opens up to Steve like a flower, like these past ten years it had been waiting just for this and only for this. He’s so wet that he can feel the slick trickling out of him now that Steve has breached him, and his muscles readjust to welcome Steve into him. There are fireworks in his mind, overwhelming waves of
When they’re stuck together and the initial edge of the knot has worn off, Steve opens his eyes and notices that it’s the middle of the day.
And sleep. She sleeps all the time, except not continuously. She wakes up about every three hours screaming, until Tony gives her her bottle and then lulls her back to sleep, his lullabies sounding suspiciously like AC/DC songs adapted for the purpose.
Tony opens his eyes for a moment to see Steve staring at him, wholeheartedly rapt, like he’s watching the best thing he’s ever seen in his entire existence, like he’s thinking that nothing ever could be better than Tony—
“Absolutely not! You’re my guests! And I don’t want people in my kitchen messing up with my system! You two go upstairs, take a shower or whatever. Come back around 8, alright?”
Steve starts moving into him, slow at first, just like Tony asked. Tony reaches out to him with his mind and he feels Steve already there, waiting for him.
“Uhm,” Tony looks up at Steve, but Steve understands a word every five, so. Yeah. “C’erano i miei amici con me, lo abbiamo salvato insieme. Ascolta, come ti chiami? Dov’è la tua mamma?”
“I know you are, man. But it’s not on you. I fucked up, I’m paying the price. And he’s paying the most of us all.”
She puts the doll on Steve’s chest, and Steve tries to move his arm to hug it. He doesn’t manage very well, but it must be enough for Sarah, who seems to be very happy with the results. She sits close to him.
“You taught Mom to play the piano, right?” Tony asks, desperate to change the subject, as little as he’s allowed to.
Tony sighs, and lowers his voice to imitate Steve. “It’s still your room, Steve. No one’s touched it. Except for me.”
“I’m no expert,” Steve says, his voice low and scratchy, “but that really was beautiful.” He looks directly into Tony’s eyes now, intense, hard as only Steve can be. Tony is ashamed that he can’t hold the power of that gaze. Not right now, not like this. He looks at the carpet.
“I got rid of the whole thing as soon as I realized what was happening, safely, of course, but the damage was done. I think I can reverse the process but I didn’t exactly have time for it and I was working on my armor and it wasn’t really… a priority.”
They take turns using the shower, and Tony puts on a blue silk shirt for dinner, buttons it all the way up to the collar. He wishes he could feel it on his skin.
“Please.” Tony modulates his voice to be louder than Steve’s, than anything else they’ve said so far. He grimaces, lets his frustration leave him through his nose. “Please,” he says, softer.
Steve sighs, shakes his head. Tony sees him thinking for a minute, reach a decision that causes a strangled noise to escape from his throat. “I’ll call... I’ll have someone take me to the airport tomorrow. I’ll... We’ll see each other back in New York. We’ll try again then, or... I’ll—
There’s a bizarre perplexity on Steve’s face, like he’s never seen Tony before. Like Tony is something that astonishes and terrifies him at the same time, and Tony wants to... he wants to...
It worries Steve, to see him like this. Still as a statue, numb. It’s the way Tony copes with the worst things, when everything else fails him. He becomes a pillar of salt, unreacheable, rage thundering furious inside him and inside him only.
A terrible laugh raises up from the floor and fills the entire cave, shakes the walls with its contempt for Tony, with the power of its sickening mockery. Rocks fall from the ceiling, and Tony’s chest bursts with pain.
, as though it was a gift, but he couldn’t think of a single reason why someone like Steve would want to give it to him.
But Steve doesn’t have his shield anymore, doesn’t have his uniform. He only has a sketchbook, a pencil case, a bunch of dark winter clothes, a sad smile for Tony.
At some point, there’s a sharp pain in his lower back, and Steve stops feeling his legs altogether. All things considered, it’s probably better this way.
Sometimes Tony tries to understand, to wrap his head around all that evil, and he can’t do anything but try to interpret the facts through his own values, that don’t have anything in common with the ones the man upheld. So it never adds up, and he needs to learn how to remember that.
Tony doesn’t need Steve to do this, but Steve needs to do it for himself and for Tony, so Tony lets him. In the end, when Steve is toweling Tony’s feet dry, he is more serene, less wistful. He helps Tony into comfortable clothes, wears something warm himself, and he leads Tony to the couch in the living room. He drapes the blanket over Tony’s legs, makes them hot chocolate. They spend the day watching old movies, Tony leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder or resting it on his thighs, while Steve plays with his hair.
In the lab, Tony is tinkering. Steve can always tell when he’s really working on something, deeply focused on a project, and when he isn’t. Right now he’s not idle, and the work isn’t mindless or useless, of course, but it doesn’t look like Tony has any specific task to bring to completion. He’s just doing a bit of this and a bit of that, and in the end all those bits will probably be meaningful to Tony in ways Steve has never been good at understanding, but has always been capable of appreciating.
Tony tries to get away from him, but Steve keeps him in place with his hand at the nape of Tony’s neck. Tony gives up easily, rests his cheek over Steve’s heart again. Steve feels him breathe through his hand; his skin registers every rise and fall of Tony’s shoulders. It’s like counting every beat of his heart; it’s like having proof that Tony is alive every second. Every moment is accounted for.
Okay, Steve severely misjudged how comfortable Tony would be with someone touching the device that keeps him alive, makes him pilot the Iron Man suit, is the source of at least 60% of his traumas.
Tony is silent for a minute. “Thank you for saying that.” He huffs out a breath, and the muscles around his heart distend into something that feels close to freedom.
Steve groans, low, “Tony,” and fucks deep inside him and stops there, coming and shuddering violently over him. They’re locked together. He pushes Tony’s head to the side, and—
“So. That was… that was nice,” Tony tries for casual and fails so miserably that he wants to bang his head against the wall, but he just rebooted his entire biology so he’s kind of trying to take better care of himself.
As for the state of my mind, I actually cannot tell. Do I still have my enhanced intelligence? Am I still a tactical genius? Can I remember things perfectly, things I’ve only seen once?
Steve gasps, but he doesn’t do anything else. He doesn’t flinch, doesn’t move. He’s so good. So careful.
Tony feels belonging again. Inside him, something finds its place again, like the plates of his armor slotting together in that perfect way that always makes him feel like he can keep the trembling of his hands under control, if he tries hard enough.
He goes into the bathroom to clean up before wearing an old pair of sweatpants and tiptoeing downstairs, into the kitchen. He sets a few things on a tray. Juice, bread, jam, cookies, chips. A few protein bars. Water.
Tony walks around the bed again, stops when he’s in front of Steve. He stands there like that, short, almost naked, hurt, tired. Bruised—hip and shoulder and pride and heart.
They care about different things. Sometimes, they have different priorities. They see the world through different eyes, tinted in different ways.
Despite his prompting, Tony is tense, Steve can see it in the lines around his mouth, in the way his lips part slightly.
They walk through the woods slowly; Stella is careful not to slip in a puddle. She’s doing good, Tony thinks, observing her. She looks healthy, but still lonely. She’ll have to put up with the two of them for a few days, though, and for sure their visit will do her good. Tony has lots of things to tell her about space.
And what’s missing, the only thing that’s missing, is Tony adding his own pieces, contributing to the growth with the same passion Steve has. And maybe someday Tony’s lack of help will become too much for Steve, and he won’t be able to do it all alone any longer. If Tony rejects him, maybe one day Steve will stop loving him too, and move on. It hasn’t happened yet.
The words travel inside Steve like a current, and he straightens his back with the shock they give him.
The skin, there, is like Steve’s skin is all over the rest of his body: smooth and fair, it doesn’t darken at all along the rim, and the hair is fine and blonde, the opposite of Tony’s, dark and coarse.
“What—” Confusion. Horror. In Steve’s voice. Then, Alpha instinct. Protection. “Tony, please, try to breathe. What kind of weapons—”
“Wait!” Tony says, too loud, and takes Steve’s wrist in his hand before he can run away like the last time.
“Some sort of lab. They have my suit. They’re trying to reverse engineer it to replicate it, but it’s like watching the apes with the monolith in
After hugging Steve first to help him deal with his nightmare, this was to be expected, he supposes.
He slides to the floor and lets himself be kissed, the taste of his pleasure (it’s white, it tastes white) on Steve’s tongue. He sucks on it and can’t get enough of it; he’s sure he could die for the sheer lack of Steve’s lips on his, but Steve kisses him back, hugs him tight, picks him up to lay him back down on the bed.
“Oh, hell, Tony…” He laughs again. “If I weren’t already knotting you, I’d want to fuck you all over again.”
“I was also jealous, because of my father, but that aside, I really did.” Tony continues. “You were perfect to me, in my mind. Captain America, pure and amazing. Spotless. Then we met, and, well... It wasn’t that perfect, was it? But still. The way I admired you, the way I grew to love you after things ended with Pepper—it took so little, from you. A whispered word, a simple thought you wanted to share with me, and I was undone. Gone. I couldn’t think straight anymore. It used to be like,
Steve sounds more like himself. His voice is still low and scratchy, like sandpaper on wood, but he seems better after each wave of the rut comes and passes.
He rubs a hand across his face, pushes his hair back from his forehead. He catches his own reflection in the mirror and averts his eyes as fast as possible.
While he changes into running clothes, Steve checks his wound in the bathroom. The bruise around it is already green and yellow. The scab itches, but it’ll be gone by tomorrow morning. He removes the bandage, so it can breathe a little. He tells Tony, shows him the wound tugging his t-shirt away from his neck. Tony just nods, guilt still clouding his eyes.
Tony stared at the empty drawer in his dresser and tried to recall what was in there before Steve’s underwear.
“That I hope you and Tony can fix things. That I hope you’re happy, or will be soon. That I hope we can stay friends.”
Steve wakes up to an empty bed. The soft light streaming into the room tells him that it’s very early in the morning. He tries to focus his hearing, but Tony doesn’t seem to be anywhere in the guest house. He stretches his arm to touch Tony’s side of the mattress, and it’s cold.
His belly grows, and he can’t mask it anymore. He avoids being seen in public, only releases a couple of carefully filmed statements from behind his desk, and no one suspects a thing. No one is surprised if he looks tired.
Tony props himself up with his arms, and turns to kiss Steve, slow and sweet. He plays with Steve’s tongue, sucks on it, maybe he tastes himself there. The thought makes Steve’s head spin.
Tony thought himself past this kind of mistakes. He thought he was too old for them, too experienced, too strong-willed at this point of his life.
Steve grabs Tony’s t-shirt in his fist, and Tony is reminded of a child who hasn’t developed fine motor skills yet: each movement rough, unrefined, abrupt. He’s not scared, but he wishes Steve would release him.
Steve sits next to him, rests his hand on the nape of Tony’s neck. He squeezes for a moment, and Tony’s mouth goes slack because of it, a shaky groan escapes him. He wants more, and knows he shouldn’t.
Tony takes two of Steve’s fingers in his hand. It’s so weird how big his hands are now. They’re shaped differently than Tony’s—Tony’s fingers are thick and rough, full of calluses and scars; Steve’s are lean and elegant, the skin fair and unblemished—but their relative dimension is… it’s almost comical.
Their progress, after that, is pretty clear to Steve: Tony needs time to get used to Steve’s touch, needs to build up some form of physical intimacy, needs to be the giver at first so he can be comfortable receiving. Steve is willing to be patient, he always asks Tony’s consent before doing anything new, but he tries to kiss Tony a couple more times, more out of a mixture of mindless arousal and muscle memory from the few other times he has had sex than anything else, but Tony always shifts away, and Steve tries to swallow his disappointment down and
They haven’t been dating long. After being Avengers members and friends for years, they finally pulled their heads out of their asses — as so many of their teammates like to say — and confessed that they had been in love this whole time. But, contrary to what Rhodey said when he first heard the good news, that had only made their flirting and general grossness around each other worse.
He glances at Steve now and then, gives him a lopsided smile, to which Steve doesn’t respond. He just watches Tony play, watches his profile and his hands, and thinks about who knows what.
“Not yet,” Tony replies, “but if you talk to Sam, tell him... tell him that Rhodey’s number’s still the same. And he’d be glad to hear from him.”
He wobbles on his feet, and Steve is there in a second, guiding him to sit on the stone bench at the other end of the shower stall.
When Steve has retrieved the bottle, he looks at it curiously and asks, “Why’d you even bring this?”
They stay like that for almost an hour, and then they hear someone walk past in the hallway, so they separate, smile, and wish each other a good night.
The thing is, Steve can’t figure out what exactly the problem is. If there even is a problem. Maybe Tony simply doesn’t love him, considers this whole thing just casual sex, and there’s nothing deeper than that. Maybe Tony has sex-related traumas that he doesn’t want to talk to Steve about. Although this doesn’t fit the narrative of Tony Stark, playboy extraordinaire but… well, it’s not like the Captain America comic books are an accurate depiction of his life and character, so it’s pretty easy to dismiss it all as a press myth. Tony has been with Pepper, briefly… Steve tries to imagine how the sex could have been between them, but he feels uncomfortable and rude, so he stops that train of thought. It’s just…
While the level of water in the tub rises slowly, Steve walks up in front of Tony. He feels a smile play on his own face; he’s excited to do this, happy even, and yet it’s not sexual at all, no matter what it looks like. It’s going to feel good, the hot water, Tony between his arms, no need to talk about anything. Just the two of them, as close as they can be while they still… while Tony still hasn’t…
He smiled at my motivational speeches, as though he found them a little ridiculous but couldn’t bring himself to mock them. They gave him hope.
“I’m thinking that I’m not worth all this work,” Tony says, bitter melancholy laced into his voice, “which I guess just proves your point. That I need… help.”
Steve closes his eyes, and he can almost smell the cherry blossoms, can almost taste the cherries, and Tony’s tongue against his own.
“The water isn’t cold,” Tony says, smiling again. “There’s a thermal source that merges with the river a couple of yards that way. The water’s warm here,” he explains.
Steve gathers his thoughts with a sigh. Tony stares at his naked feet on the carpet. The tears blur his field of vision.
Tony sobs, lets a tear roll down his face, musters up all the strength he has left in him, all his brainpower, and pushes out the words like it hurts to say them but he has to nonetheless, “Love you, too.”
Tony must’ve undone a few buttons of his shirt, because there’s only warm glass under Steve’s skin. He covers it entirely, and with his middle finger he can graze the hollow of Tony’s throat.
“Come on, just admit it, just say, ‘Tony, you win this round, I’m a dumbass who makes dumbass life choices’—”
They take their bags and go inside. The man shows them their room—it’s not big, but it’s clean and looks cared for. There are two twin beds, so Steve won’t need to sleep on the floor, after all. Tony speaks with the man for a couple of minutes, asks him to please leave the key in the lock, takes it from there when the man leaves, and closes the door.
, that’s not pleasant), scrambles on the floor away from Steve, sits with his back to the wall and brings his knees close to his chest; his eyes are screwed shut and he’s still gasping, trying to control his breathing with no success and he’s murmuring something that Steve can’t quite catch.
“If Spider-Man gets Doom to send him back in time, this entire reality—our reality—could disappear. Maybe we never even really existed in the first place, we are just the temporary product of a mistake. An illusion. All our memories, everything we lived—”
It seems like a huge construction from the past. Abandoned centuries ago and left there to collect dust.
“I understand why you’re scared of me. If you need me to stay away, I will.” Steve swallows all the misery and shame he feels thinking about what happened yesterday in the car.
“Here,” Steve says, helping Tony out of the tub and into a towel that smells like lavender fabric softener and sunshine. He lowers his head to catch Tony’s gaze. He’s still naked. “What’s wrong?” he asks, quietly.
This isn’t what he wanted to do. He didn’t have this in mind. He was supposed to say… He had a present, and—
“No, we don’t need to. But I’d like to.” There’s a long pause, T'Challa weighs his next words carefully. “During that week, we all did things we wouldn’t have done under any other circumstances. But if what Colonel Rhodes explained to me is true, we’ll need to get past our differences, learn how to truly work together, and trust each other.”
.” Tony’s words are harsh now, and he sits up while he spits them out; closes his eyes, breathes in deep. He takes his left wrist into his right fist, rubs at it firmly, keeping it close to his chest. The metal of his bracelet digs into the skin at the base of his hand.
“Nah, it’s actually not half as bad as my face makes it look. My guys are working on it, it’s just a legal hiccup, but I thought it was a done deal, so, you know.”
“I know. I feel like such an asshole, sometimes. And maybe it’s selfish but I don’t wanna lose him, I don’t want that.”
“I’m okay, Mr. Stark. I wanted to thank you for... everything you’re doing. I… I really didn’t expect it.”
Tony insists Steve tells him if he wants something else. At first Steve says he’s okay like this, but after a while he asks, somewhat sheepishly, for two or three raw eggs in a glass.
“Please, stop blaming yourself, please. I’m begging you.” Steve takes Tony’s shoulders between his hands—his huge, huge hands—and Tony feels his guilt crushing him, and it’s hard to breathe, and his eyes are burning and he doesn’t want to cry, he really doesn’t want to, he needs to get his shit together and
He likes the marker, the way it feels on the paper. It’s good practice, he figures, to get into his thick skull that fixing mistakes is hard as hell, and sometimes straight up impossible.
Steve picks up the sling and Tony lets him put it on. He plays with it, sliding his fingers up and down the strap a few times while he stares into Tony’s eyes.
Steve, who is now standing next to the heavy bag, his white cotton shirt wet with the water he splashed on himself, his nipples visible through the fabric, his face red with the exertion of bench-pressing the equivalent weight of a bus or whatever, sweat dampening his hair, freckles visible on his arms…
Tony feels it so deep inside himself, this sense of belonging. She’s his and he’s hers in a way he didn’t think was possible.
“Wait!” she interrupts Tony, “I think I have some frozen. I’ll give it to you guys; you can make pasta tomorrow.”
The man shouldn’t have woken Tony up. His body will shut down soon. There was something in progress that wasn’t allowed to run until complete, and nature—science—always asks for its price.
He doesn’t say anything for a few minutes, and Tony gets distracted looking around, at the hill in front of them, at a couple of children playing a few feet away from where they’re sitting, at their grandfather promising ice cream for
The words hit Steve with visible violence. He winces, frowns. He’s horrified, stunned. “N—no, oh god, no, Tony, I... I only wanted to stop you from... I did not... you have to believe me, please, I—”
“Of course I wanna have sex with you. I can barely think about anything else. I dream about fucking you while you wear a wedding ring with my stupid fucking name on it.”
When Tony wakes up next, he feels empty and terrified, cold and alone. There’s nothing inside him. Steve isn’t next to him in bed.
Tony makes him sit up and drink some water. He’s careful because Steve is still knotting the toy. He wants to cover his lap with the sheets, but then he remembers there’s no way this is real. No way.
Steve would be taller than him, like he really is. The top of Tony’s head would barely reach Steve’s chin, but Tony wouldn’t feel lacking for it. Steve wouldn’t make him feel like he needs to be any different from who he already is.
“I… I have no idea, Steve. Maybe. Do some research if you want. Dig in some archives. Write a paper on it.”
The Relais looks lovely from the outside. It’s immersed in the hills, it seems like it used to be a farmhouse or something of the sort. There are trees, vines of ivy climbing the old walls, roses everywhere. The grass is well-cared for, a white gravel trail the only thing breaking the wide expanse of green. The view is breathtaking: fields and vineyards and olive groves and woods as far as the eye can see. Then, just the sky.
Tony feels very empty. And he would spare a moment to mourn the loss of Steve inside him if he wasn’t glad that he can nudge Steve to lie on his back now, climb on top of him, and, for the first time in ten years, kiss him—caress Steve’s tongue with his own, remember the way he tastes.
“Missed me?” he says, and it was meant to be a little joke but there’s no spark in it. He knows he can’t joke about this, not just yet.
Tony is suddenly reminded of a paper he’s read recently, a theory about the possible existence of a multiverse written by Riri Williams, a fifteen year old student at MIT. It’s genius work, and he needs to talk to this girl when he gets back home because,
“Okay, I’m sure they’re somewhere in here,” Stella says while carrying a big box that she drops heavily on the table. Steve sits back on his chair.
Steve keeps his eyes fixed on Tony’s the whole time, and it should be awkward, staring at each other, but that, too, is the opposite. It’s not weird; it doesn’t make Tony feel ashamed, or exposed. He feels pinned in place, in a good way. He feels like he knows what’s around him; there are no surprises, nothing he wasn’t fast enough or clever enough to avoid and fix. He feels held.
He’s about to speak, but Tony puts his extended forefinger on his pursed lips, says, “Shhh,” and Steve doesn’t talk.
Tony remembers the joke, how he mocked Steve about the fact that he looked up to talk to JARVIS, even if he didn’t need to. It had happened three or four times at least, when Steve was around. After everyone had told Tony that no, they weren’t going to move in the tower with him after all, but they’ll be there for Avengers business.
, and looks at him with his big sad eyes and his voice is small and kind and Tony doesn’t want Steve to be sad, and he doesn’t want to disappoint Steve.
Third thing: THANK YOU to everyone that has read the story and commented on it, and to everyone that has listened to me complaining about writing it for six months. You're all the best. And THANK YOU to everyone that patiently waited for the story to be completed to read it! I hope you will enjoy it and I would love to hear your thoughts.
Steve watches Tony sit on the thickest branch of the tree, legs wrapped around it. His thighs flex with the effort, the muscles contract under the soft linen of his pants. He reaches up with his arms, arching his back, and the pose is so peculiar that Steve wishes he had brought his sketchbook with him.
Steve is familiar with corpses. Less so with ones in an advanced state of putrefaction. Even less so, with coming back from being one himself. With coming back from peace, from nothingness, to find that his carefully constructed plan to put a stop to it all has blown up in his face in the most horrible way.
Tony keeps moving his head, his eyes closed, but then he looks up at Steve for a moment, places a hand on Steve’s ass and pulls him in and Steve gets it,
The first thing Steve sees turning the corner of the street that leads into the square is a big, rectangular space, delimited by old buildings on all sides. There are pots of flowers at the windows and trees visible from behind a courtyard wall. There’s a little church in a corner, and a portico on the opposite side of the square.
Tony doesn’t want to talk about what Steve needs to talk about, doesn’t want to say the words that would release Steve from these clutches. It’s an agony, the wait, the doubt, the not knowing. But there’s also some comfort in it: until Tony decides, Steve gets to do things that he wouldn’t be allowed when—
“I’m so happy you’re here,” Tony says, and smiles as true as he can, because he really is happy that Steve is here, he’s so, so happy, and he wants Steve to know it.
After months of captivity, Tony tries, without much success, to gauge, in between all the things that are wrong with him, what’s a direct result of the man’s abuse and what’s a sign of his body going into failure because of the forcibly interrupted coma.
He closes his eyes, lets his head rest against the tree trunk, and with the eyes of his mind he sees her: her blond hair—just like Steve’s—gathered in a tidy chignon, her clever eyes—the same as Steve’s—checking the pot on the stove, so it wouldn’t boil over. Her apron, tightly clasped against the small of her back. Her tiny hands, her small frame. The way she kept the few things she had left of Joseph, how sometimes she’d take out his picture from her drawer and cry, whispering things Steve couldn’t hear, hidden behind the door.
“I’m... I’m so sorry,” Steve rasps out, he can barely get the sentence past his lips. There’s something clenching in his chest, a cold hand clutching at his heart, and squeezing it, merciless and insidious.
Then, Steve would brush his fingers over Tony’s hip, scrape at the red bruise with his nails. Tony would hiss in response, and fist his erection even tighter. Maybe he actually does.
Tony smiles, but it’s a counterfeited smile; it doesn’t reach his eyes even though it’s trying to. Steve doesn’t call him out on it. Tony smiles that smile and says, “Shut up,” in the sweetest way, and then he rests his forehead against Steve’s.
Steve surges forward, unable to stop himself, places his hands oh each side of Tony’s face and drags him down for a kiss, but Tony moves away before their lips can touch, looks down, keeps stroking. It happens in seconds and Steve doesn’t even have time to process it, to be disappointed or sad at the rejection because he’s very suddenly coming, soaking his shirt, hitting Tony in the chin with stripes of white. Tony buries his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, opens his mouth and licks behind Steve’s ear. Steve shudders, Tony comes without making a single sound.
Tony seems to be in distress pretty much all the time Steve isn’t inside him. He’s burning hot and can barely move. And Steve, for his part, isn’t doing much better. His knots still last two hours; there’s been no gradual decrease.
They get up, and Tony asks Steve if he has any clothes he’d like to wash. Steve gathers some, and Tony throws them into the washing machine with his own.
Steve has been sleeping in Tony’s bed every night in the past week. Which is great, Tony loves sleeping with a huge super-soldier attached to his back. It’s the best. But Steve wants to have sex every night
Steve waits for the worst of the awkwardness to pass. “Sam, uh… he gave me a chess set for my birthday. I was wondering if you wanted, uh… we, we could—”
Steve walks to the bed, sits next to Tony, keeps staring at him as if an explanation could be written in his eyes.
Steve takes a ridiculous amount of pictures with his phone, of everything he finds even mildly interesting, and he catches Tony rolling his eyes a couple of times, but his expression is fond, not annoyed.
They walk through a market full of street vendors and people, until they reach a food cart. Tony orders for them both when it’s their turn; he exchanges a few friendly words with the women at the counter, and Steve has the distinct impression that they’re talking about him, who’s never eaten this lampredotto thing and his whole life is about to change forever. Tony asks for seven
He can’t let himself imagine anything romantic, and he’s more than sure that’s not what Steve wants either. After that one night, Steve never called, never even texted after Lagos. The first time they saw each other again was when Tony took Ross to the compound with the Sokovia Accords. And yeah, it’s not like Tony called either, but…
He has a pencil case next to his thigh, full of pens, pastels, charcoals, of all colors and kinds. There’s an eraser and a pencil sharpener too. All practical stuff that can be used while traveling, but that would still allow Steve some variety in his art.
The suit is broken, the suit... the suit is digging into his chest, cutting his skin, slashing through his flesh, it hurts so much, it pierces his lungs and his heart and his soul and the pain is unbearable and he—
“You don’t nurse her?” he asks, pointing at the baby bottle, and he doesn’t sound accusatory, just curious.
What if Steve isn’t here at all, what if the last week is all a figment of Tony’s pathetic imagination. It makes no sense that Steve would want his forgiveness. Steve doesn’t give a shit about him. Steve already hates him.
“That’s why the doctors said it was safer if I had the reactor again. Too much damaged tissue. They sent me back to the compound, with Rhodey. One night, all of a sudden I was feeling really bad, chest hurting, left arm numb. I thought I was having a heart attack. FRIDAY said I wasn’t, but I did the sensible thing and went back to the hospital.”
. Because he really does find Tony hot as hell. Tony feels such a rush of happiness that he almost starts crying too. Again.
,” Tony says, harsh and rude, and he wants to kick his own ass as soon as the sentence leaves his mouth. Steve takes the blow like a champ and walks towards the little wall at the edge of the hilltop. There are trees there, providing cover from the sun. Tony follows him.
It figures that what Steve does is something entirely different. But then again, he could always surprise Tony.
They rest, then, for as long as the knot latches them together, which is a very long time. Tony can’t say how much, but when Steve can finally slip out of him the winter sun is already starting to set.
Steve looks at Tony’s knee, almost touching his while they sit side by side on the edge of the bed, and he notices, all of a sudden and inconsequentially, that he doesn’t have gray hair there, and on his arms too. It’s only in his beard and hair. He wonders how Tony’s chest hair would be, if his skin there wasn’t covered in scars. He wonders if Tony dyes his pubic hair.
“Yeah. Nat told me a couple of months after SHIELD fell. I offered to help looking for him, but she said you guys had it covered.”
“That’s—” Tony says, but doesn’t finish, can’t, really, because Steve moves his hand again, aligning his fingers with the bruise already on Tony’s hip, and he presses down on it, hard. “Fuck—” Tony shouts around a moan, breath short and ragged, lost in this heady mixture of pleasure and pain—the one soothing the sting of the other, the other making the one all the sweeter.
But why does it have to end badly? Tony’s track record. Steve and Tony’s track record. Previous experiences. Tony’s no good at relationships; Steve’s never been in one.
It doesn’t hurt, though. Not much, anyway. There’s that, at least. The man always brings lube with him, a good brand, and Tony doesn’t need a lot of preparation, especially after months of being fucked every night. But the man doesn’t always care about slicking himself up sufficiently, doesn’t care about making it good for Tony. He doesn’t care whether he hurts Tony or not; it’s just coincidental that most of the time Tony can tolerate it.
He pushes the covers away and moves up on the bed until he can settle between Tony’s thighs. Tony looks down at Steve, sleepy and exasperated, and Steve replies by letting his face sink into Tony’s groin and inhaling again. Then, slowly, ignoring Tony’s soft cock, Steve starts licking at his balls, massages them with careful movements of his lips. He takes them into his mouth, coates them with saliva, sucks at them meticulously, all the while pressing his thumb into Tony’s perineum, rubbing at it in circles, looking for something, until—
I feel them inside me even when they aren’t. I dream of them. I know all their faces now; I can recognize them. Even by their voices.
Tony screams. Steve swallows it all in a kiss and comes, hard, deep inside Tony, all his love and care and affection gather in his lower belly and transform into a shock of energy that runs through him head to toe, makes his muscles spasm and shake uncontrollably, his vision goes white and he distantly feels Tony’s short nails scratch at his back, his other hand still tight around Steve’s wrist.
Tony turns, shifts closer to his bedside table to put the sketch in the drawer with the others, but Steve touches his elbow and says, “Wait.” He takes a marker and scribbles something at the bottom of the drawing. “There,” he says, “now it’s perfect.”
“You’re not, you’re... I swear, Steve, I didn’t feel threatened in any way. It just caught me off guard.”
But no. He had no body to bury. He could only watch, helplessly, while they shuffled Tony’s dead body away in an ambulance. He was never able to ask for it back—they were both criminals, and in Osborn’s America criminals had no rights. No one had rights.
. He hasn’t thought about sex this much in decades. He thinks about Steve, and his mind goes to dirtier places than it ever did before they were together, when he spent his nights pining and dreaming of a very specific warm body next to him.
He holds his head in his hands and tries to ground himself, to tell himself he is trying to make it better, make amends, earn Tony’s forgiveness even though he’s not sure he deserves it.
Steve takes both their bags from the backseat and follows Tony to the little building separated from the rest of the Relais by a high fence covered in ivy. It used to be a barn where Tony’s great-grandfather kept the crops after the harvest and hung cold meats to let them age. Now, it’s where Tony stays when he comes here, so he can maintain his privacy. The perks of being the owner.
“Yes and no,” Tony says, voice all pain. “It’s because I don’t know what it is, and I can’t predict how I’ll react to it, and I’m scared... I’m so fucking scared.”
“Are you alright?” Tony asks again, louder, and then closes his eyes and swallows, chastising himself.
Suddenly, Steve’s toothbrush was in Tony’s bathroom, and Tony stared at it for half an hour one night, wondering how and when that happened.
Tony takes his shirt off. Steve barely has the time to realize that blood is trickling down his face and into his eyelashes from a cut on his forehead.
But seriously, Tony thinks while he angrily closes tabs on the holoscreen, some people are too disgusting to even
“No. I lied in the book. I never lied to you. I’m just telling you for the first time. Did you really want me to tell you this over the phone, or in an email?”
“I’m sorry. I’m sure he was different when you knew him. At six, I was a better engineer than he ever was. Better at coding, too. It made him bitter. He grew frustrated over the years, he drank a lot. And the more he drank the more his ideas suffered, and... I don’t want to tarnish your memory of him, Steve, I just need—”
In the following weeks, Steve kind of goes through the motions when it comes to Tony. As usual, Tony acts normal with him, but Steve feels like some form of very delicate equilibrium has been broken, like Tony knows that
“I’m not stronger than you, Steve,” Tony continues, proving the exact opposite of what he’s saying, because Steve couldn’t speak at all right now. Tony looks up to stifle his tears, sniffs again, rubs his forehead.
Without a word, Steve takes off all his clothes, and enters the shower. He sits across from Tony. The shower is so big. One of Tony’s legs is bent at the knee, he’s resting his left arm on it. The hand is shaking.
Someone—god, the lurch of rage inside Steve’s stomach, the rightful bile of a scorned Alpha—someone dared to put their filthy, vile hands on Tony, and hurt him.
“I... I really don’t know what to say.” He can’t tear his eyes away from the drawing. He can’t believe someone would see him like that. That
Tony reaches for Steve across the bond, but he can’t find him now. It’s not that Steve is cutting him off, quite the contrary, but he’s not really himself. He’s slipping away, or something is separating them. A wall, a fence. Tony tries, tentatively, to connect with him, but what comes back in response is just physical need and nothing else. For a minute, there’s no love, no care, no affection.
Steve bats his hand away with the tip of his boot. “Don’t,” he orders, and Tony’s hands go back to Steve’s hips. There are tears at the sides of his eyes.
Tony tells him about her progress. She’s started making cooing sounds and has a little more control over her limbs. Also, Tony is now convinced she really learned how to smile.
Steve takes off his gloves and drops them on his desk, his gaze catching on the shiny reflection of the light on the ring at his finger. He can almost feel the words engraved inside it, against his skin.
Tony closes his eyes again, presses his forehead to Steve’s and breathes, lips parted, skin wet and tanned and smelling like coconut and metal, and Steve feels it on his lips, the warm air that comes out of Tony’s mouth and he can almost taste it; he remembers it so well from that night, their night, the night they spent together and made love and Steve just wants to give in to this, because maybe he doesn’t deserve it but he would like to have a kiss, a last kiss, as a goodbye, something to remember Tony by, something to think about when he’s alone at night with fire between his thighs and only Tony’s name hammering in his head, something to use to chase away the knowledge of how badly he screwed this up, in the decades of guaranteed loneliness that he’s got ahead of himself, but he…
He pushes a couple of fingers into Tony again, stretching the rim around his own dick and reaching deeper inside him. He licks the glimmering slick off his hand.
He remembers the quiet, the stillness of those first weeks. Everything felt like it was happening to someone else, as though Steve was just watching a movie, waiting for someone to laugh at the joke and snap him out of it. Everything felt so unreal, like a blanket of dust had settled over reality and made it all gray and muted. Sounds and colors weren’t the same as before.
“Let’s keep an eye on things for a few days. Anything moves in a mile radius, I know about it. Understood?”
“It hasn’t always been perfect, especially lately. I’ll give you that. But we’ve done it right once or twice, I think.” He chances a quick glance at Steve’s face. “There are some good memories, right?” Tony feels his throat constricting.
The first push of the blunt head of Tony’s dick is a heady mix of pleasure and pain that makes Steve go limp. He spreads his legs further apart, brings his knees up to accommodate Tony’s body into his. Steve has his arms above his head on the carpet, and Tony carefully circles one of his wrists and holds it down, hard. Steve feels something that can only be described as bliss rushing through him. He looks up at Tony and he’s very surprised to find that Tony is already looking at him. Steve gets lost in his eyes, it’s the longest and deepest Tony has looked at him ever while they have sex, and Steve is determined to make it last as much as possible, to use it to tell Tony all the things he can’t say with words.
He sits at the piano. One of the cats jumps on his lap. He nuzzles her neck from behind; she twists to look at him, sniffs him, meows.
Steve exits the shower stall, dries off, walks back to the bedroom to dress while the scent of coffee wafts through the room. He throws his dirty sleep clothes in the washing machine and starts the program.
He searches the guest house for signs of Tony, but finds none. One pair of his shoes is gone. His pants from yesterday too.
Tony skims through the first chapter, about the war and its horrors, about Stella’s family, her father’s expectations of her, how since she was very young she realized she was completely uninterested in boys. While everyone told her she would find a nice man and have children, she dreamed of graduating university, of being a doctor or a pianist or an engineer.
Tony suddenly shudders, briefly, and then goes very still and very stiff and Steve feels something hot and liquid, something that is
Tony’s arms flail around for a moment before settling over Steve’s thighs, then he moves them up to grab Steve’s hips for better balance. Steve feels him swallow around him, trying to make saliva pool on his tongue, trying to wet the corners of his lips to make the slide easier.
“Sir has yet to return to the penthouse, Captain,” JARVIS informs him before he has a chance to ask.
Steve drapes himself over Tony’s back, buries his head in the crook of Tony’s neck, nips at his shoulder, pins Tony’s wrists down on the bed. He rolls his hips, again and again, and Tony thinks,
Tony lifts his hands, palms up, and looks at them, as though he could find there confirmation of what he just said. He clenches his hands into fists.
He’s in the suit, but FRIDAY is silent. The data feed isn’t providing any information. That worries him.
He closes his eyes, and he can see her: the color of her eyes, the scent of her skin, her hair on Tony’s face when she hugged him tight. The sound of her voice, that day she cried, the last time Tony saw her. Her smile in the picture with Stella.
Tony stares at the ceiling, clenches his jaw and presses his lips together, lets the air come out of his nose.
“Shh,” Steve whispers, close to him but without touching him, “It’s alright, Tony. Sweetheart, it’s alright.”
Bruce tries to explain. Steve almost can’t hear him over the pounding in his ears, the tension rushing out of him.
Steve shakes his head suddenly. He shouldn’t be staring at Tony like this, especially while he’s asleep. He tries to avert his eyes, thinks of getting up to take a book from the shelf or take his sketchbook from the bedroom, but all he can think about is Tony.
Steve touches him again, circles Tony’s wrists with his fingers, avoiding the bracelets. Tony jolts, the words wrenched away from him, a confession extorted through a torture invisible to anyone but himself. “I missed you too. You left, and I, I was... I am angry, and… but I missed you.”
T’Challa speaks to him in soft tones, scared that Tony might shatter if his voice is too loud. They talk about the team and then T’Challa gives him a book of poems he read when he was young. Tony thanks him and reads one poem every night, right before falling asleep. One of them is about what happened to Tony, and Tony doesn’t know if T’Challa gave him the book because he wanted him to read this particular poem, or if he didn’t even remember that it was there. There’s a bit that says,
He ends up buying a little jasper falcon for Sam. In the car, he looks at it with melancholic eyes, and Tony realizes that Steve must miss Sam, badly, probably as much as Tony misses Rhodey.
And it starts back from the top. Steve is relentless, looks at the same time like he knows exactly what he’s doing, but also like he has completely lost all control.
Tony nods. He lifts his hand, but then hesitates, leaves it there hovering in mid-air, his fingers closing into a loose fist. He finally places it on Steve’s knee. “Let’s go,” he says.
Sometimes Tony bleeds from his ass. It burns, but it’s so constant that it’s hard to really notice anymore.
Steve must know about Tony’s past, must have read about it on one of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s files or maybe even on that stupid unauthorized biography that Clint won’t stop bringing up as a joke. He must know about Tony’s youth spent welcoming way too many people between his legs, people he sure wasn’t bonded with, and in many cases wouldn’t want to be, ever. All those rich and spoiled Alphas who had an arranged marriage with a virgin Omega they had never met a few years ahead of them, all those sleazy scumbags in the weapon business who were used to cutting deals with Omegas only in a very specific way… But even though the days since Tony felt ashamed of his sexual history are long gone—you can get too old for that too, apparently—now he feels bad about it anew, because Steve knows about it, and he must have thought… after Tony’s stupid flirting, he must have thought…
He still wishes he had the phone with him. That he could open it, and stare at it, and marvel at how fucking old it is, and read
“That was messy,” Tony says, admiring the stripes of come on Steve’s chest. Some of it even hit his beard, and he must feel it because he cleans it away with the back of his hand. “I like it.”
“I thought I’d lose it. I’m almost fifty, Steve. I didn’t want to give you false hope. I know how much you wished… well…”
Tony wants to stop time; he wants to bottle up this feeling of perfection, of accomplishment, the sweetness of rightful revenge that he never thought could be so addictive, but he knows that, like it always is with all the best drugs, the rush will only last a minute.
Tony didn’t seem disgusted or embarrassed or... anything, really. He was just surprised and maybe mildly amused.
She mimics all the animals’ calls when you ask her; she knows people’s names and can point at them in the room when Tony calls them for her; she even points to herself when he asks her
It’s not exactly in focus; Tony is moving, but it’s beautiful in its own way. His profile barely visible against the bluest sky Steve has ever seen, his skin glowing in the blistering sun of the early afternoon, his sunglasses masking him just enough.
weird Alpha, Tony Stark.” He could have said it in a dozen different ways, most of them bad or threatening, but Steve chooses the most harmless one instead, a fond laugh at the background of it.
It’s scary how sexy Tony can be even when he’s wearing a dirty tank top, even with streaks of grease on his face. Even smelling like sweat.
Tony looks up at Steve and laughs and moans his name over and over while Steve pushes into him. He starts moving and Tony’s heart leaps with joy.
It escapes Steve’s lips, like so many other things he shouldn’t have said; it slips away from his fingers like so many other things he shouldn’t have done.
Tony sits automatically, looks at his hands again. He looks like a child who has lost his mom, and in many ways he is.
Steve thinks about the sign saying not to go up the tower in case of heart problems. But Tony is… he’s fine. Right? He said so.
“See, thing is, no offense, but your judgement on stuff like this isn’t all that reliable, Mister ‘I throw myself off buildings once a week.’”
The muscles in Steve’s shoulders relax. Tony hasn’t attacked him, isn’t screaming at him. His jaw is set, he’s obviously angry and displeased, but he’s in control.
It’s good. It’s warm and electric and it makes Tony feel clean; it makes Tony want to stay naked while they do it, and for a little while after. Steve’s muscles are hot and solid under his, and Tony wants to kiss every inch of him.
Tony kneels down on his heels so they’re face to face and he takes Steve’s head between his hands and kisses him again and says, “I did it all for us. They were gonna kill me. I did it so I knew that one day I could come back to you,” and that’s when Steve notices that Tony is still wearing his wedding ring.
They cut off three fingers from my left hand. They force them into my mouth and tell me that if I spit them out they’ll burn my eyes with the iron rod in the fireplace. I realize that we all have our own hierarchy for body parts.
“If it’s any consolation, you don’t look a day older than ninety. Eighty-five normally, but the beard adds a few years, I gotta say.”
“I shouldn’t have hurt your friend,” Tony sighs. “That was... wrong. I’m sorry. It wasn’t his fault.”
“I don’t want to force you into anything. But if you want it, if you really want, uh, me, I’m… I’m here. For you.”
He works two slick fingers into himself because he doesn’t care about starting with one, he doesn’t have the time or the patience for it. This needs to be quick, it needs to happen right now.
And it’s a good thing. Because Tony doesn’t think he could bear to know that someone else has seen Steve look at him like that.
Carol observes him with a careful, welcoming smile in her eyes. She’s warm and friendly, protective, like a sister. She offers to spar with him and he accepts, and pretending to fight instead of doing it for real, now, fixes whatever was left to fix between them. Tony smells her sweat on his skin right before entering the shower and he feels strangely strong.
Steve has no idea what Tony is doing, he only knows that come and lube are leaking out of Tony and onto Steve’s stomach so Steve shoves three fingers into Tony’s hole, to keep everything inside. To keep himself inside.
An average Alpha at the peak of their rut can knot their Omega for, what, thirty minutes? Forty, in some cases. Of course for Steve it’s different.
Steve turns the shower off. He exits the stall, walks over to the other side of the bathroom, to the big bathtub, and starts the water, not too hot.
Steve comes to him that night, knocking on Tony’s door the same way he did the first time he saw his daughter. Unassuming, docile.
“Yeah, and trying to take me for a fool. You think I don’t know that half of Nat’s hoodies are actually yours?”
Steve doesn’t seem fazed by this, keeps stroking him slowly and kissing him in that sweet way of his and after a while, finally,
Tony shifts just enough to look into Steve’s eyes for a moment. He smiles, bitter, and almost looks like he’s going to be sick. Steve wonders if Tony will look at him like this forever. If Steve will, too. With only
“I—” Steve starts, but then he seems not to have a clue what to say, and he coughs into his fist, awkward.
“Shh… Just… here,” Steve says, and guides Tony’s nose into the hollow of his throat, the place where an Alpha’s scent is the strongest, the place that’s supposed to feel like the safest haven for an Omega.
Again, Tony uses his fingers to comb Steve’s hair away from his forehead. Steve leans into the touch before remembering that he shouldn’t.
What floods his heart next, though, is a hot wave of shame that cuts the air in his throat in the ugliest way.
Tony runs away from him, runs down the corridors of Stark Mansion and breathes, and cries and breathes.
His dick has softened. It slipped out of the toy leaving a trail of come so thick it’s easy to guess how sick he is. There’s even blood in it, just a bit.
Steve pulls him closer. He presses their bodies together and loses himself into the clear blue of Tony’s eyes.
Steve finally turns to stare at Tony’s face for a long moment, and Tony wants to fill the silence with something, but the intensity of Steve’s gaze makes the words melt on his lips.
Which means: Steve’s erection is so intense that it’s almost painful, pressing against Tony’s naked ass under the covers. He rubs at him a bit, to take the edge off, but Tony is still fast asleep.
“There’s not much you can do about it actually, Captain,” T'Challa intervenes, his voice suave and mildly amused. “I won’t allow you to set foot on Wakandan soil.” He smirks. Of course he smirks.
The man is, without question, the most attractive human being Steve has ever seen in his life. His face, his strong jaw, the shape of his nose and his forehead, his hair, his lips. His body, oh god, his body looks better than Steve’s own, and his eyes are so
. Tony doesn’t really pay attention to it, but after he stops working on his tablet, the movie picks up some of his attention. Not really out of a conscious decision, he stretches on the couch and places his head on Steve’s lap.
Steve pushes the lever down, and the water stops. Tony shakes his head and blinks at him, slowly, surprised to see him there. Steve grabs a towel and dries Tony’s hands off, massages his knuckles through the fabric while he ignores all the thoughts wrestling for space in his mind.
“Why are we really here, Tony?” Steve finds the courage to ask some time later, when Tony’s breathing is still uneven and he’s moving too often to be asleep.
“I shouldn’t have... I keep fuckin’ this up, goddammit,” Steve says, and he hits himself in the head with his fist. Once, then twice. And again, until it hurts.
Tony feels it first, he thinks. A trembling, like an earthquake of the mind. Something snaps, something rips apart into Tony, into Steve—he doesn’t know where he finishes and where Steve starts anymore. It’s all fragments.
While Tony sets up the blanket outside to get some work done before lunch, Steve sets off down the hill, away from the main road. The sun makes him sweat pretty soon, but he doesn’t really feel warm.
“So, since you’re about to kick the bucket and all, I thought we could live a little and go see a place, later. It’s not far, it’s a small town… peculiar, let’s say.”
Tony pees and washes his hands. He takes off one t-shirt and then the other, stares at his bare chest in the stained mirror. He tastes coconut in his saliva.
Tony is touching Steve’s arm. Clutching it, really. Steve reaches for him under the water, circles his waist with his arm and pulls him close. Tony hoists himself up, wraps his legs around Steve’s hips and touches his face, his thumbs stroking the skin just below Steve’s eyes. Steve holds him up with a hand on his back, but the water is doing most of the work.
He turns, and Steve appears from one of the tunnels. He’s dirty and his uniform is torn in places, but he’s not injured.
Steve had no idea Tony could speak Italian. No, wait. It was in Tony’s file. Right. His mother must have taught him. He knows it quite well, if the fluent conversation he’s having with the owner of the bed and breakfast is anything to go by.
He takes Steve’s henley off and kisses all over his chest, biting his nipples and making him gasp. Steve throws his head back to give Tony better access, holds himself up with his arms propped up on the mattress behind his back.
“It’ll be just a moment,” Tony says, again with the gentlest voice Steve’s ever heard him use. “Just to get in the water.”
Steve, trying to say something but there must be mud in his brain right now. He fucks like there’s nothing else he cares about.
When he feels close, Steve draws out once more. He stares at Tony, touches his face to make him open his eyes. Tony tries, but it’s difficult. “I really want you to keep your eyes open, Avenger,” Steve demands, and Tony steels himself, breathes deeply, opens his eyes, meets Steve’s.
Tony dresses in the bathroom, and when he comes back Steve is up, he changed into jeans but hasn’t put on a shirt yet.
He focuses on the pain, so the rage that’s surging up in his chest doesn’t take over his mind. They have to leave. There’s no time to kill those fucking idiots who thought they could touch Tony with their filthy hands and walk scot free. There’s no time, and Steve is in no condition to hurt anyone that isn’t himself. It will take him days to heal, even with the serum, and by the time he’ll come back he’ll have to start a hunt that will only waste his time.
