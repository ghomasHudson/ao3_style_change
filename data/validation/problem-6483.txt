The pint hit the table and Thor stood up. “Let’s go, Warrior Monster! Let’s show them how the real warriors fight. You can use all your might and those unique weapons you possess. Unlike these Midgardians, Thor, son of Odin, has no water in his veins.”
No screwball comedies then. “He likes coffee”, Natalia mused after listening their conversation. “Yes, that and a sandwich could do him some good. Let’s go and see him. I have to ask him to date my bracelets anyway.”
He shook his head to his own folly. He constantly forget he didn’t know anything about this world or those people. Who knows, maybe Captain America of this universe wasn’t from the 40’s like him, but had always lived in this time and ace. It could be the guy had some strange, good-paying computer job besides his superhero gig.
That was only a rhetorical question of course. Those precise measuring devices which the science team had attached to the both men were notifying Rogers was telling the truth. Or at least the truth as he knew it.
The other Steve sounded tired. Or fed up. “Did you understand what Tony is saying here? He is asking does Antonio drink lots of booze? Like every day, perhaps?”
He almost smiled at that. Alright. While they were introducing themselves… “Can I ask, who are you, ma’am?”
“Why don’t you give Steve some lack, Fury? Eighteen months is a long time. Were thought we were stranded in that universe. We made friends. We lived and fought among them, started to built life and home. And now it all is just gone.”
“Yes, we love you too Tony”, Antonio was laughing, still studying the rings as if they were priceless treasures. “Missed your sweet fifties too.”
Then there was of course the Spider. This one in his red costume was not a boy with a man’s name, Spider-Man of this universe was indeed an adult, his size and his voice… but no wonder that those criminals went always ballistic with him; who would not be tired to hear his constant yapping.
“Why are you all so mean to me… Clint and I are in the lobby now. Do you need a lift? I can go around and come in through the window. I don’t want to set anything in fire in this death trap.”
“Oh God, Steve. She is such a cutie”, Antonio was gushing for the tenth time. But Fury didn’t care about Stark, he was looking at Rogers, a growing worry inside his gut. The man was unnaturally still, except nodding at something Stark was whispering into his ear. Fury bet this situation had reminded Rogers of the man who he had to kill to save his teammates and maybe the whole world. A very bad man, calling himself Red Skull. Steve Rogers’s wayward son. The stranger who despite the time or distance had imprinted himself deep into his being. A lost opportunity. A lost love. So much lost because of the war and those shitty decisions only heroes were managed to live through.
“No, no it is nothing to do with this… I just have never thought about that possibility for my own armor work… Alright! I can think about that later… Let’s focus here! Children, be quiet, I am calling Doctor Richards now.”
Yes, Steve knew. It was impossible to get anything out of Barton without a childish innuendo. So he asked if Banner could somehow persuade Tony to come to watch a movie with them.
The other Steve was already halfway to the elevators when he seemed to remember his guest. He stopped, but continued immediately, giving him a tired smirk after seeing his raised thumb.
“Nice set-up you Krauts have. Speaking English, even a negro officer. You really think this is enough to assure me I am home among friendlies?”
“Oh shit, bro! Don’t you watch those entertainment news, they will rot your brain. Rich people screw around. They take what they want when they want it. What if Stark wants to keep bum boys on the side? You think that lady says anything about it when she has now gotten her greedy fingers inside his wallet? No, she will keep her mouth shut like a good little rich bitch and buy something nice. You remember those sex tapes a few years back? Everyone has seen that little Tony, it is nothing unusual. If that guy had no money he would have no reputation. Or what do you say bum boy? Is your daddy good in the sack? Five stars out of five?”
He kept eating while Tony was in the shower. The billionaire genius hadn’t said anything more before vanishing through the bathroom door. Now he stood there again, this time a towel around his hips. Steve forgot to move his jaw when his eyes followed Tony to his walk-in closet. Steve was eating apple, was that biblical or what. His nose could distinguish Tony’s natural musk under a fresh, woodsy smell he had put on. So swell. His hearing picked up how clothes slide over Tony’s skin, covering his body with their layers.
Antonio was giving up. Of course he was, it was for Steve, so it was almost a patriotic act. Tony felt very noble indeed, but how come the supersoldier continued to look like things were not going the way he wanted?
That should have made alarm bells ring loud and clear in Tony’s head. And it did. With a little delay after he had enjoyed some hand-picked images first. “And why is that, darling? Why you but not me then?”
Later Clint said he let out a manly grunt, but those who had witnessed the incident remembered it differently. A high-pitched scream shot through the comms, and then Clint was falling from the tree, his both legs pierced by the bullets. Only a few moments, and SteveToo could have ended his life with a single round. Fortunately for Clint, Iron Man was faster and SteveToo had to take cover again. There was still an acute need for distraction, and Steve decided to make it by rushing to the open space between the garden and the main building.
Gail’s tone was light, but Steve’s heart was throbbing in his throat when he waited what Bucky might say. His best friend gave him an amazed look, before his nose pinched and eyes flashed in a way they had done when Steve made his bragging decision to leave the airplane without a working parachute.
.” Barton made showy air quotes, and Steve knew what those meant, thank you. “God, I have never laughed so much! The other one kept sniffling until he croaked! I bet he shat his pants too.”
The hammer moved in Steve’s fist. The thing yanked forward, tearing him from his feet. He was too stubborn to let go, so he was dragged across the floor towards Thor and his waiting hand.
The ventilators were already sucking the gas out of the room. When the panel on the wall blinked from red to green, Fury gave his men an order to proceed.
Her voice had gotten a tone he didn’t much appreciate; if he wasn’t careful, in this weakened state, her empathy would make tears rise into his eyes.
Sometimes he wondered how a man like Steve could even look at him without contempt. He was so weak. Without his money and toys he was nothing, just a sick, naked body lying on the floor of some garage, covered in nanofluid and his own blood.
“Now than you all had stretched your gossip muscles, we should continue”, Fury stated. “As Barton said, the media can be problematic.”
“You bet your ass it was a mistake”, Pepper said, raising her eyebrow. “Care to explain this? Any of you?”
“You are still expecting us to act like Nazis”, the man mused. “Yes, you were lucky it was a research vessel of my company which found you. There are people out there who make Nazis look like choir boys, bad people, who don’t ask permissions if they find something profitable.”
Fury could hear it. The howling of the alarm would have raised the death and made them annoyed in the process. It did the same to Fury, but for another reason. It was
They were early. Fury had been prepared, but the situation still filled him with suspicion. The group didn’t seem overly concerned about the armed agents who had now them surrounded. Their leader raised his face to look at his direction, not seeing him and Captain Danvers behind the mirror glass, but nevertheless giving them a muted smile and a brief salute.
This earned him that cautious and somewhat sly look. Was Antonio thinking this was some sort of game?
He gritted his teeth so hard it made his jaw jump. What a shrew! He had nothing against a lady speaking her mind, her mother had been quite a strong personality, but these modern women, they seemed only speak out of turn. No wonder this future world was going to shit everywhere he looked. This was too fucking familiar, he really didn’t appreciate the way both Janets were belittling him, yapping and moaning about their personal things like some drunken sows. Never mind that, whatever he said about anything was always wrong too.
That didn’t do much to them either, but he had liked the taste and the feeling of something in his lungs. The SHIELD doctors had explained how dangerous those innocent looking little nails actually were to your health, but he was a supersoldier whose body could fend off most illnesses. An occasional fag wouldn’t do them any harm.
Steve didn’t think so. He had already met Virginia Potts, and she had radiated strength and calm. She was a woman who knew how to stand in the eye of the storm. She had been a true friend to Tony, just like Steve’s Peggy had been during the wartime.
He felt the faint nod, which almost raised tears into his eyes again. But he couldn’t cry now, not in front of Antonio. Now if ever was the time to be hard.
“No, of course not! I would never forget a vintage death ray, they are so cool! You remember, when you woke from ice, how you felt a little lost and we tried to cheer you up by finding all kind of things from the 40s?”
“What? Are you both turning into mad scientists? Doctor Banner, what is it? Don’t say you are considering...”
The monster came closer. When it was about three yards from her, it halted, taking a deep breath, smelling the air around her. Then it let out a sneeze. Her mouth opened with surprise to hear such a mundane, humane thing.
“That is… I am sorry to hear that”, the other Steve said. Always so damn decent. “I wonder if there is a universe somewhere in which all Tony Stark’s major organs work fine… I am going to check the nurse. If she had some news how the operation is going. Do you want something from the canteen?”
He took the fire escape as Janet of course flied. She did some reconnaissance and found easily the right place. There were three guys, all packed up in the living room couch, watching the screen, playing probably some kind of electronic game, as Steve noticed when he smashed the window with his shield and jumped into the room.
“Never mind. Continue through the door. And alarm more guards. Nobody enters without my permission.”
He couldn’t blame Tony who had just been himself. When Tony had been more lucid after his operation, Steve had tried to explain their situation and it seemed Tony had understood. The SHIELD putting them into the cell would have make more sense to Steve, but Fury of this universe probably deemed them helpless. And he were so fucking right. They had no means of transportation. No weapons, no communications, backup or even a proper plan. If he had been bendy enough, he would have kicked himself in the ass. He had made his quiet reconnaissances for a few days now, waiting for the right opportunity, but Barton and his ghoulish jokes had made him lose it.
He woke up again with an unpleasant feeling of his body swaying. A car, he thought, probably the back of a van. No use to shout out, and if he was honest, maybe he didn’t want those who had found him to know he was conscious again. He should stay alert and watch and…
The elevator pinged and somebody stepped to the lounge. His body tried to tense, but it was at the end of its tether, he could hardly move his head to look at the newcomer.
“Go to the shower, Tony. You will feel better afterwards. You haven’t done that for a few days, have you?”
“I don’t know what to tell you folks”, he started after Tony had pushed another water bottle into his hands. “It was business as usual. We were fighting those things. Then they got Antonio and his armor malfunctioned. I didn’t have time to search how badly he was hurt, when suddenly there was this very bright light and I was moved here and Antonio was nowhere to be seen.”
There was a brief surprised silence and then Barton started laughing. And not only him, also Banner let out a brief giggle which was soon sunken under Thor’s booming jolliness.
“Phone? Yes, writing is difficult though. Maybe people nowadays have smaller fingers”, Steve wondered, dropping his gaze to his massive paws which were still holding the cup. He pushed it to Tony’s hands. “Natalia taught me to use coffee machine too.”
“Oh, you were worried about little old me”, Tony said, giving him one of his infamous playboy smiles, which never endeared his case to Fury. “I was indeed suffocating in something. He was...”
Steve wasn’t through the front door when Gail noticed his full finger. She raised her brow, but Steve shook his head. So they ate dinner, which was excellent as usual, even if Gail needed nowadays their home nurse’s help to cook it.
Home. Steve wouldn’t have called it like that. It wasn’t Triskelion or the mansion Tony had reserved for Ultimates’s use.
“Or you can do that”, Janet said. She had just been explaining to him her plan (which had included the use of the front door), but he had waited long enough. “The guy with a short hair. That is the nephew. Whatever you do, don’t knock him out.”
The man in a green grubs did as Banner asked. Fury had a little premonition. This was Tuesday. Tuesdays were like Mondays, bad hair days for sure, they just could pretend longer everything was alright.
“So strangling it is… or pissing on me.” Antonio couldn’t help that his voice let out some of his frustration. “You make a real tough bargain, big guy.”
That was finally an easy order to follow. He had no energy to wonder why he believed all those other things too.
He wondered what gave that away. Yes, nothing broken or bruised this time, if one didn’t include his dignity. “I suppose I don’t do that again by myself?”
“Oh, but I realize”, Tony said gritting his teeth. “I realized immediately and perfectly well why you hadn’t go running and telling them.”
“That is not sophistication”, Tony interrupted his explanations. “That is a sickness... Never mind. It has been almost two days. Yes, his withdrawal symptoms would have started for real. His pulse was all over the place and he was hardly lucid. Even without his other injuries… He was going cold turkey. I just want to know how could you let it go this far? So bad? Did you even try to do anything?”
The buzzing in the device increased when his friends admonished the dim-witted giant. Or maybe it was only an act again, to make his visitor look harmless and put Steve at ease.
“Ha, you handsome bastard”, the other Steve grinned and made a little circle around him. “This is so odd. Like looking at the 3D mirror.”
“Sorry, old habit. I can say that here and now… and most people don’t mind, don’t even understand. But you know that a dead father is just a euphemism for a good Catholic girl to be knocked up without any prospect of marriage.”
“Steve is a little sore about it, you know. It was only a standard psych evaluation and orientation course. He asked for it himself. To clear his head, you know. The thing you should have arranged for him when we dug him out of ice.”
Alright. If he was honest, there was no actual reason why Steve couldn’t be nicer to his teammates, ease his grumpy ways, and overall be more co-operative. He should listen to his team’s suggestions, which hadn’t been all bad. Maybe if he started with changes in his own behavior, some good things would follow.
He had gotten the harness off, but the clip of his uniform shirt was stuck. “I got it… Shit, that is a nasty one. We will have to look at that wound after I have delivered these to Tony.”
“What the hell do you mean he disappeared? The room should be monitored by… yes, I know they were not classified hostile, they could move from the room, but they are not allowed to beat up our agents… it wasn’t, yes, why was that... No, I don’t care of any staff shortage, if you are in the monitor duty, you took a tablet to the bathroom all I know… No, Agent, you should have noticed, it’s kind of your job, isn’t it? The guards… you are shitting me, aren’t you? No! How many times I have to say this: No unauthorized goings or comings, no matter if the guy is dressed up as our flag… Yes, guess what, I don’t care your great grandfather was in Normandy with Captain America, it is better that any of you morons don’t mention Normandy to me ever again.”
Tony nodded. That was all true, even if it wasn’t the whole truth. “I would have wanted to finish that project I started with Anthony.”
“It was Nat’s decision”, Barnes was saying. “Her counterpart made foul things, and she didn’t want to raise bad memories in anybody. The same with Bruce. He thought eating people and lost of hundreds of lives because of Hulk was a strong enough argument against his presence here. Clint… He thought his jokes would just remind his counterpart the family he has lost.”
“Come in”, he squeaked, hands already tightly over his duvet, thinking it had to be the other Tony or some of the Avengers, but of course not. It was Steve.
“Oh that”, the man said and god honest blushed. “I am Doctor Bruce Banner, and no, you didn’t kill me. The wound… yes, you ripped my throat open, but… It doesn’t matter, please forget about it. No harm done.”
Tony grumbled, but finally he went to his nightstand and took some pills. He swallowed them dry and scrambled to the bed.
“A good point. If Tony were still a drunken lecher and tried to grope that guy’s ass, he would beat him black and blue. He got this total different air than our captain. He seems… uptight.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Move on with it”, he mumbled, making circling movement with his left hand in a feeble effort to conceal the tremors. Last night there had been more coke and booze than was usual, and even if he was still pretty, rich, and genius, he wasn’t twenty years old anymore.
“Oh… sure”, Tony stammered, still not believing his ears, and then Steve was already pulling his T-shirt over his head. He stopped, the shirt halfway down his arms and looked at Tony with serious eyes. “I am not doing it to you, you know.”
He liked this new Steve. He liked him. Smiling at him and treating him with such a kindness. Without his finery, beaten up, covered with piss and vomit he was precious. If he had known, he would have let Steve see how he puked into a toilet bowl after his chemo sessions.
Now Rogers looked regretful. Fury knew that jumping jaw muscle though. That was Rogers being pig-headed.
“I didn’t stay to look, I was too busy trying to stay alive! If I hadn’t sparred him so often and known his tells I would be dead right now.”
For a moment Steve was sure Tony would start to cry, but then his eyes got that hard, emotionless gleam again. He huffed a small laugh and shook his head like sorting his thoughts to their final order.
What was happening? What? Was Steve… flirting with him? Loki... Wait a minute. Loki! He was slender. And dark haired. Like Tony, haha very funny. But for a moment he had thought...
Then Fury rushed out of the door. He was already thinking other, more important matters, deep in the hazy depths which was his mind.
“I have always painted. I was a sickly child, asthma and other lung problems. There wasn’t much else to do than my books and drawing. Most of the time we couldn’t afford oils, though. There was only my ma and I. My father died before I was born.”
Barton’s snickering ruined his dignified sentences. Richards was pushed lightly aside from the camera by the blond-haired woman. Sue Richards seemed to look the same in any universe; no-nonsense taking, efficient, and as it turned out, more people savvy.
Steve submitted, knowing what they both had been thinking. “I just don’t understand why you are pretending it is not you but some machine. All those films...”
It was not an invasion from the outer space. It was not a terrorist attack from some strange dimension. It was just those other heroes. The Avengers. Captain and Stark had yapped about the meeting so long Fury had finally given his grudging permission. He wasn’t a human robot, you know. He knew about feelings, even if he wasn’t fan of them himself. Captain and Stark had left that other universe so abruptly they had not been able to say their goodbyes. This one was to give them some closure.
If that little speech was not food for premonition, Steve didn’t know what would be. “Tony. To to point. What is in there? Did you tinker with some vintage death ray and just forgot it there?”
A new blast from the grenade made the air rattle in their ears and smashed another statue. Shards of stone flew in the air, one of them making a bloody graze on Steve’s cheek.
“They say raising kids goes easier the second time, sir. I think you have enough experience to manage this horrid ordeal.”
The door opened. Banner entered the corridor and Steve went after him, and just like that, he was out of his cell first time what had to be weeks.
When they had thought they were going to die and Steve had considered doing Tony that one final favor.
“You are not exactly a prisoner here, more like in quarantine. That is just one thing I would like to talk with you about. You knew my father.”
“Except...” he said slowly. “I just remembered something. There is this big walk-in safe in my old workshop, my father used to keep there his prototypes and plans. The door is enough to withhold a regular burglary, but Steve and his shield and his mighty muscles… if he really wants in, all he had to do is smash the concrete around the door, it is not a bank vault.”
Was he giving Steve a way out? To him but not Antonio, the wording didn’t leave much room for guesswork. Now was the time to abandon that drunkard poof to his fate, the other Tony was saying, there was no way around this, the whole group had witnessed Antonio’s mishap. That was it, wasn’t it? No loyalty among soldiers… But no, maybe he shouldn’t blame them. If he had been in their position, would he had been more lenient? He had taken a vow to defend their society and laws...
Did she wink at him? Was this Janet also interested in vintage super soldiers? Making doll-faces at him because Steve of her universe was already taken? Oh God, now he himself started to sound like some ladies’ entertainment novel. Luckily, that thought was wiped away when Natasha opened the hatch door again and the wind pushed to his face, making his eyes water. “It is almost under us, but I have to leave you a bit further”, she shouted, to be heard over the background noise. “The roofs are no good for landing and I don’t want to disrupt the traffic.”
The Stark Tower was swell. More than swell. Oh if ma saw him now, in his own bathroom, in a huge bath with all these pretty, good-smelling things. She would think he had turned into a little lord.
She shook her head in an admonishing way. “Why on earth do you make it sound like it is a bad thing?”
He found the other Steve in the kitchen. It was almost funny that he had dressed himself up as his identical twin, only his button down was different, it was green with a faint pattern of diamonds.
He talked about things like the Berlin wall, NATO, and Warsaw Pact. A new global war was in making as the former allies started to arrange the world to their images. Steve’s found his fangs were out and he had bitten his lower lip. He hadn’t lost control so badly in years, but his fear was luckily in vain, this might be a new war, but it was a cold one.
“Wow! And I mean... wow! Clint Barton, Captain. Sir. Code name Hawkeye. I was on a mission abroad, when… What I mean... wow! No wonder Stark couldn’t keep his fingers off of you.”
“Yeah, that was a bust, alright. Gabe had a sore throat and they have to cancel the gig, but nobody bothered to notice me. I was kind of pissed off, just left… and it wasn’t so much his throat anyway but what he had been pouring into it again.”
“Isn’t there anyone nice in your universe?” Nat finally asked, only half-joking. “Or are you all like cynical, hard-boiled versions of our fluid morals and average goodness?”
Danced so much. With Antonio. And nobody had cared. Steve glimpsed at the dance floor. He had delivered Mayor’s wife to her husband and lurked then to the bar, hogged a several glasses of water, while Tony had been surrounded by businessmen and their supermodel girlfriends or perhaps they were their daughters.
“Just giving a tour for a new guy”, Natalia was saying. “You can continue from this. He learned to use his tablet and his phone quickly. I gave him basics, you have maybe something to add to that too.”
“Because they always do this. They give me young and innocent things. Want to make me look like a rabid animal. Tease the bull with a red sheet. Hurt the circus lion with a whip. I am not going to dance to them.”
Steve didn’t know should he go or stay. He didn’t like the way Tony passed out right away, because it couldn’t be natural. Hopefully, the pills were just harmless sleeping aids like barbiturates. Steve listened to Tony’s breathing. Even if Tony seemed to be alright, Steve knew himself: it would be useless to go to his bed. He couldn’t get any sleep when he worried about Tony.
“Stark, you said the captains were like twin brothers, same at every aspect. How come this other Captain America was married to a man then?”
Tony had made it? Call him a fool, but that made him titter inside. He could now imagine he had a gentleman caller giving him gifts.
After some time the water stopped. “Alright, that is enough. Soldier, on your feet. Don’t make me carry the naked you anywhere.”
“Alright”, the other Steve mumbled. “This would need some stronger consideration. Too bad we can’t go out there, find a couple of crooks and beat them up like an average controversial vigilante would do. As an icon of the nation we can’t be seen using human-shaped boxing bags.”
Fury tapped his comm and ordered more gas into the lab. When Banner woke up the second time, he should have a helluva headache, but he would be a human again.
“What about Bruce?” Stark wondered, when agents with their heavy duty gas masks hurried into the room.
This was it. A moment they had been readying themselves for almost a year. Director Nicholas Fury’s arrival to the research lab didn’t went unnoticed as usual, there were some extra nervous glances from the scientists who were making their final check-ups.
“You keep up with me”, Fury warned when they were ready to go. “You don’t touch anything, and if Doctor Banner says he needs us to leave, you do it without any hassle. You don’t want to make that guy nervous.”
. (Yes, Clint, keep those air quotes coming!) No wonder divorce rates are what they are. If young people are exposed to that kind of filth, after some twenty years nobody will take matrimony seriously anymore. What next? They want children to play house? Or play with, you know. If I had gotten my hands on them first, they wouldn’t have needed any trial.”
“Steve, you didn’t mention any girl. Except that other Natasha and other Janet, but you weren’t talking about them like a man in love. I know that you and our Janet were close, but well, she is still married to that no good husband of hers.”
Tony knew exactly what he was doing, moving the place of his legs, changing the angle Steve’s dick drilled into him until his back arched and mouth opened, wanting to moan, to scream, maybe babble some nonsense, but he wasn’t fast enough: Steve filled him with his tongue. Licking and sucking Tony’s mouth, Steve found a steady rhythm for his hips, making the bed sway under their bodies and adding sensation until it was all too much to bear. Steve hissed and separated from Tony’s lips, attacking his neck, nuzzling and sucking until Tony grabbed the back of his head and pulled his mouth tight onto his skin. Steve got the hint and bit, still feeling the lingering fear Tony would change his mind. A pure ecstasy filled his senses, even if part of him still tried to observe the signs telling him Tony wanted him to stop and was trying to push him away. But if something, Tony grabbed his hair harder, scratching his back with the nails of his free hand. Steve sucked and pushed while Tony trashed and moaned under him.
“Alright!” he interrupted Anderson’s musings. “No evil magic. I got it. No magic of any kind. If you say so. How about a werewolf? That is only a matter of lycantrophic genes, isn’t it?”
“Whoa! That had to hurt!” Fury said aloud when the shield knocked Clint first from his feet, then Captain finished the treat by clocking him. The archer collapsed on the floor his face bloody, just a few seconds after he had joked that Captain should kiss Stark and earn him twenty bucks.
That made Anthony yelp and push his fingers towards his ears. “I didn’t hear that shameful number! But yes, for the record, it was quite a party. Say what, how about we keep a rerun here. The after party! Or actually after after… I lost the count. Or we could unite it with our welcoming party.”
Everything seemed to stop around them. Conversations, clicking of the glasses, even the dancers gave them room until Steve and Tony were in the middle of the floor. “I will lead”, Steve said under his breath and Tony nodded. They were halfway through the song until Tony was able to utter proper words again.
“So you think he is really like us”, Nat summed it up. “He is Steve, but from different Avengers? From different Earth?”
“We could”, the other Steve admitted. “And we could still be naughty, I bet alcohol doesn’t have any effect on you as it does not have on me, but do you like to smoke? And I mean tobacco, that other thing is still illegal in our state.”
That was putting it generously. Escaping the SHIELD base had been easy, he had just put Antonio in the wheelchair which had been standing in the corner of their room, waiting Antonio to recover enough to be moved. It hurt Antonio to sit up, but they had managed, and Steve had pushed him first out of the building and then into their transport, the whole time waiting alarms starting to blast and military dressed people pointing their guns at them.
Steve had come just by playing with Tony’s rod? Yes, death of me, Tony thought. But the shower didn’t sound like a bad proposition, actually, it gave Tony some ideas. Steve had made him come like some untried teenager. That needed payback. If Steve would be on his feet after Tony was through with him, his name was not Antonio Stark, playboy extraordinaire and Iron Man of this and any other universe.
The guy covered him with a smelly blanket and then he let him be. Antonio was relieved, and kind of thankful, but shouldn’t he move? Shouldn’t he be looking for Steve, or at least call for help for fuck’s sake! But every time he tried to lift himself from the mattress the pain pushed him back until he was too tired even to weep. He felt like a butterfly, pinned to the collector’s box. That had been hours ago, maybe a few days, because he hadn’t still died of dehydration, but he was already starting to shake. He wasn’t stupid enough to ask the friendly guy to call the police or the ambulance, but calling Fury…
Unlike me, was left unsaid. But Gail had promised she forgave him, and Steve had to assume it was about everything.
Only a light squinting of her eyes told Steve the red-headed spy was not pleased to be dragged to the conversation. “I was”, she admitted. “It was to examine if there was something else going on behind his public face. Director Fury wanted me to estimate if he could work as a part of the team. I was with him almost three months. He didn’t pass.”
He picked up a few bottles. His temper tantrum seemed childish now. Suddenly he was so thirsty he felt sand on his tongue.
The answer earned him a satisfied slap on his back. “Planet Brooklyn! Did you hear Brother Green, it is now settled! Be silent, no more of this! Where is the feast I ordered for us? Better talk when mead butters our tongues. You can drink and eat, I hope? Widow Spider said you had difficulties with your food some days ago.”
The others were nodding, and Steve felt maybe a faint relief. Anything was better than the glass jar with its talking, spying walls. But wait a minute? In Stark Tower? Like with Tony?
He could see that famous Rogers temper rising. “How many times I have to say it? Do you want it with me or not?”
“Enough!” Thor shouted, standing up and reaching with his hand. “Mjolnir, hear your true master! Return to me!”
Now Steve let out a little happy smirk which in a few days would be on the cover of many magazines around the world.
“Let’s go to our living quarters. Then you can tell us about yourself and this Antonio. Do you think he is also here somewhere? And how did you actually get here?”
Tony came back from the closet still dressed only in his shirt. The fresh smell of alcohol lingered around him when he slumped on the bed next to Steve. He turned and hid his face on the pillow, which muffled his words. “I know that you… You think like a soldier, you make a plan and then you execute the plan and that’s it. You instead of booze and coke, that is a… Oh God, it kills me to say this but it will not be enough. I have been drinking since I am teenager. I can’t just quit, my body will go into shock and I will die. I have to check into rehab and take shitload of meds and go to the therapy, and it will take time. Weeks… maybe months. And years and years after that without… Are you really selling your ass out just to dry a little old me?”
That made giant’s visage darken. “It is often so, I am afraid”, he sighed, a brief hurt dimming his shining eyes. “My brother hates me for that same reason. But a man should not be remembered because of the deeds or failures of his kin. It is his own deeds which should matter.”
That Steve Rogers would meet Natasha Romanoff in this particular place, right at this devastating moment, could also be explained by math, but let’s just quote a famous saying. Nothing is ever so bad it couldn’t go any worse, and it did, when Steve heard that familiar, hated voice calling his name. First, he thought this had to be a hoax or a dream. Natasha Romanoff was dead, but still Steve was seeing a red-headed woman coming out of the chocolate shop. She stood there, such an innocent looking little lady, in her snappy summer dress and a white paper bag in her hand.
Tony giggled. Another prime camera shot. “Many of them will be like that, you know”, Tony said in more somber tones. “I hope you have thought a lot about this. We can still say you lost a bet. Laugh this off.”
No useless feelings. But sometimes. Why not to scream, when people around you seemed to be stupid on purpose.
He shook his head. The other Steve left, shadowed by Barton, who tried to make him guess which snacks he had preferred. He was in the waiting room together with Tony, who was assessing him with a calculating look. The man had no armor on, just a business suit and those prancing orange hued glasses he probably didn’t need. Even he had heard of contact lenses and laser surgeries.
Steve-standing moved forward and squatted in front of his double, who was now gazing them suspiciously. Steve-sitting had been in the battle recently. His uniform was dirty and damaged, and it usually took much to even scratch their gear. He had his helmet still on, but it couldn’t hide the tightness around his eyes. They seemed to be about the same age, but sitting there the man looked older, like he was carrying a massive load on his shoulders, and unlike his counterpart, he had nobody to help with that burden.
“Got no water, pal”, the guy mumbled, already halfway to his chemical-helped dreamland. “Go to sleep.”
It was not just Antonio… Well, it was mostly Tony, Steve was still scared for his mate, his lover, whatever. Tony was still dying of cancer, and Steve could do nothing about the fact, so he let it all come out at once, his anger, his fear, his disappointment… when he had woken up in the future world, so much like this one here… what he had then read from the history books, what he had seen with his own eyes, how they have used their victory and turned it into the farce, this mock version of his country and the American values.
Maybe that was over now. Nat knew her past was far from clean, maybe there had been some dark secret she had forgotten or thinking insignificant. What if Steve had found out and decided she needed to be punished. Once and for all. By this. Whatever this was. (Nat herself would have used some untraceable poison, but Steve had always preferred more straightforward action.)
“I think… I am afraid there is nothing much left. I touched Tony’s neck to get his pulse and my hands were covered with it… but I washed them after that.”
Steve let his hand drop. When he had stepped in front of the metal man, he had almost… Steve sniffed and there it was again, a light wisp of that familiar smell, now mixed with the smell of metal and something hot and unnatural. Repulsors, he learned later. If Stark had made the thing and maintained it like a mechanic did to a car, it was only natural the machine smelled of him.
Another shake. Tony really didn’t. He could be a regular acid tongue, but usually only when a person really deserved it. He had never been like that with Steve and that was so strange about it. Why did Tony have to start now?
“Now they want me to slyly ask you again where did you come from. If it was the other dimension, or from outer space. Maybe your ancestors have stranded themselves here in ancient times? Are your people the force behind Stonehenge? The reason the pyramids exist?”
The other Steve looked like he really meant it. Maybe Steve had planned to charge him, and the leader of the Avengers had noticed that, of course he had. Maybe Steve could win him in a battle when the guy didn’t have his team to back him up, but either way, it wasn’t helping Antonio. Who was an ass, and Steve was still mad at him, but…
“Too bad my sobriety support person is now in another dimension. So, Fury. If you want to vet something, you can start with that. He or she will be spying for you anyway.”
Tony snorted. He was lying down on the bed now, not seducing but like a sneering sacrificial lamb. “How magnanimous of you. Well, aren’t you coming?”
Tony’s brother, Gregory Stark, had taken over Tony’s company in his absence, and if his voice stuttered and eyes got watery gleam when he saw Antonio waltzing into his board meeting, it wasn’t because of brotherly love. Such drama queens, both Starks, but scorn they had always felt towards each others was mutual. It was a mess which would take weeks or even months to uncover, and it took Tony three whole days of intensive work with the company’s legal department to even get the process started.
Too soon the straw touched only the empty bottom. The other Steve didn’t ask silly questions, but pushed another drink into his hands. He emptied it too, and after some sixty ounces of that calorie-rich tastiness, his stomach felt more at ease.
In that same party… it had been some ten minutes before the incident, Steve had already admonished Tony not to use his hands so much while speaking. Not to call everybody, men and women, darlings. Hadn’t Tony thought that people would start thinking he was a poof, as Steve eloquently had put it.
A strong pull and he was upright again. His feet felt like very bad-quality rubber. He was half carried, half walked to the edge of the bed. A large cup was pushed into his hands. The straw was guided to his mouth and he sucked by the muscle memory, the taste hitting his tongue reminding him how hungry he was.
“See what, Steve”, Natasha said quietly. “You tried to shoot me, and when the bullet from your gun hit some innocent civilian you seemed to mind nothing about it. Tell us what we don’t see, when our trusted leader is suddenly behaving like a part of his brains has been removed and the rest of it dipped in 90 percent vodka.”
It was actually a sensible explanation. He wasn’t going to admit his acceptance to Stark, so it was convenient they were interrupted by a loud and annoyed roar which always forewent smashing of things. Usually something expensive.
“Hold it, I have a plan. I am helping him, you didn’t see how starry-eyed he got when he talked about Tony. His Tony, I mean. He went nuts when Richards asked him to strip. Big guy is so deep in the closet that he is sitting at White Witch’s tea party. This is simple reverse psychology. Makes him stop to think how lucky he actually is, and then when we will find his guy… awww, Technicolor kisses.”
Fury was pushed from his musings when Rogers rushed forward. His target was the only woman in the group, a sweet looking brunette. He lifted her in his arms, turning her around like he was five year old dancing with his favorite rag doll, and what, tickling her. She giggled in delight and slapped Rogers’s behind a few times, which made him laugh. Captain Danvers gave out a surprised gasp and even Fury felt his jaw slacken a bit. He pushed it carefully up and gritted his teeth for a good measure. But sweet Jesus! Captain Grumpy acting like a happy little kid. This was too bizarre to be real.
“You know it is not a potbellied pig, but a real thing”, Natasha reminded them. “An adult hog will weigh eight hundred pounds.”
“W-What is wrong with your eyes?” she asked, after a while. A regular shatter box, this one. “Are you hurt?”
“Yeah”, the other Steve admitted, his visage getting a solemn hue, guessing his meaning so accurately again it was spooky. “We little guys, shaking in a cold mud pits somewhere, waiting when generals draw lines onto their maps… Wanna watch some TV?”
Banner gaze searched him from head to heels as if trying to find something tangible. Something to help with his own situation. There was this half amused and half hopeless smile on his lips when he asked if Steve was now willing to meet the team.
“We are in the SHIELD quarantine faculty in Texas. The others are waiting for us in the meeting room.”
Tony was still looking at him like asking can I. Still asking, even if he had a permission to take, had always been, neither of them hadn’t just known about it. Steve pushed his lips gently on Tony’s chapped ones. For their first and last kiss it was not bad. It would have been fine, if Steve had been able to stop thinking… his fingers on Tony’s neck, just a brief squeeze, or maybe a better grip and a fast twist. Tony wouldn’t be able to feel a thing.
“Seal the doors!” he shouted to his comm when he was out of the room. “Gas its ass! Now!” He elbowed himself through agents milling at the door. Another door and a few steps, and he was back in the observation deck where Stark had been watching the scene unravel. Stark was pale under his tan. Maybe it was because of all the blood or the flask which lay empty on the floor.
The big and vaguely familiar hands were pushing him back to the bed. They were pulling the duvet around him and not letting go until he lay quietly on the mattress. “At ease, soldier. The perimeter is secure. Now, just try to get some sleep. Your watch will come soon enough.”
But what if there had been more than flowers and butterflies? There had been this boy, Paul, who had painted people and animals, and finally, him too. That had been a swell picture. He had hidden it on the bottom of his clothes chest like guessing it was not so wise to let his friends to see it.
That said, the other Steve returned to the stove. He was making pancakes, blueberry ones, as he noticed after raising the heat retaining cover. He moved a good pile onto his plate and stuffed it with syrup.
Gail’s back straightened and she gave Steve a look full of worry. They were used to the weakness of their aging bodies, but the frailty of one’s mind would be another and harder battle.
“I am sorry. You are so like our Steve that I keep forgetting I can’t act like that with a total stranger. We tease each others all the time... But honestly, how is it? If we meet some difficulties, are you able to keep a cool head? You realize you can’t go ballistic during the mission even if you are beside yourself with worry over Antonio.”
“What are you suggesting Nat? That they are secretly planning inter universal terrorist strike? That this was an infiltration attempt failure?”
Kiss, that had been a key word. So smart a person Antonio felt too often stupid afterwards. What had Fury said about his bad impulse control? That even if he was healthier, he was too unreliable for real tough missions?
He didn’t get further before he was interrupted by their team leader who was now wearing his Captain Face; grim, determined lips and cold, squinted eyes. “Clint, what have you done now?”
Steve cleared his throat. “Sorry about not coming right back… after the shower. It is just so… Janet and I.”
Steve didn’t know. He had had no time to find out the details, or if he was totally honest, no interest to talk with his other self. Obviously, that had been a mistake.
“It's alright", Steve assured her, petting gently her arm. "Because you are so nicely asking: he is sober nowadays. No drinking, brain tumors, or whoring... Uh! Sorry, Gail. He is… well, you are right, he talks. A lot. But he is quite a funny fella. I think if you give him a chance, you will get on like a house on fire.”
The things upstairs were much like Nat had left them. Now there were bottles of drinks Steve had refused and thrown all over the floor (anything except Steve Rogers could penetrate the netting). Tony was coming from the kitchen with a new load, obviously thinking hydrating Steve would be a key to solve their bigger problem. He hadn’t even started to take off his armor, which wasn’t the most comfortable home dress he had. The floor had dark repulsor stains which indicated Tony had flown inside again. There was no way Pepper wouldn’t be scolding them.
“Tony…” Pepper sighed. “Alright, you play with two Steves and the PR-team and I try to sort this mess as usual. And the floor. We have to order new tiles for the upstairs again. What have I said about flying inside the house? Just in emergency.”
Maybe it was sarcasm. Or maybe time went differently there where the hell they had been making their makeover.
“No! Not in that way at least… Sorry, no, no war. We thought you would feel more comfortable if you had something familiar to wear. Tony made it according the old film materials and his dad’s designs.”
There was film material about spontaneous victory celebration following the surrender of Japan. There were lots of it, like his jailers thought he had a right to participate in the jubilee, even if it was already done. Damn right, he had! He had done his part. He felt something swell in his heart. It was not pride, because he was not that kind of fool. He had seen what the war was alike, and he didn’t live its rhythm in his blood like that self-claimed god of thunder. The feeling in his chest was only relief.
He was lying there, on the mattress the guy put him. The shit trick, the shit trick, the guy had repeated, those bastards didn’t leave you any clothes. One time I got so deep in dept too.
He took an apple. It was a real beauty, that one. Bright red, with that bubbling fruity smell which made his nose dance with happiness.
This universe had the Stark mansion, that was right, but the place seemed abandoned. The windows were dark. They were not covered with panels and tarpaulins, this was too good neighborhood for that, and after he had broken the lock in the door, he saw the place was far from the crack house the team had found Antonio. It was clearly uninhabited but somebody looked after it, and he wondered if he had launched some of those fancy electronic alarms with his burglary.
All the books he had ever wanted to read lay hidden inside that tablet thing. He had first laughed aloud when Natalia explained it was a computer. He had thought she was joking. Steve had seen a computer in Howard’s workshop. Howard’s computer had been like a room sized metal box full of meters and flashing lights, nothing like this portable library in his hands. And guess what, a telephone was nowadays a computer too. Oh how he hated those tiny letters which were so difficult to write. What was he, a secretary, Steve grumbled, but inside him was giddy with excitement. If there had just been somebody to share these wonders with.
“I was thinking if you have seen them show a special lamp above furniture and suddenly they can detect there have been blood stains...”
“That guy gave me a few names. People who have access to this place, that kind of thing. I put them forward to Tony. He is checking them out right now. We should soon get some results.”
That made Tony pause. The moment prolonged itself and he was about to ask, but the leader of this strange gathering got there first.
His tirade was interrupted by his associate’s derisive snort. “Does he look like a professional soldier to you?”
She didn’t do shivers. Or hysterics, or other silly emotions if they weren’t any use for her. So when she sighed, it was like a novel length confession.
Oh how he kissed him! The men was so pretty, and he hadn’t tried to take anything by force. He had just asked and bribed. There was no harm to give up. Steve had nothing more to lose than his pride.
“That sounds unusual, but maybe there is something which helps us to calculate his new location. Something must have messed up your transfer. I suspect that green substance all over your clothes has something to do with it. The sensors of my armor indicated it includes some kind of nanotech. I have to consult Doctor Richards about this. Do you know anything about where the substance could have come from? Was it that Mechanoids you mentioned?”
Clint turned to watch Captain Macho to go, and saw that Falcon had come to the kitchen. Sam was standing beside the fridge. He seemed frozen, a half-filled glass of juice in his hand.
“Or maybe big minds should stop dreaming silly. Do you think you and your father are the first ones that thought in your minds? If it were possible, the world would be full of sons of Cains.”
“God, darling”, he repeat, his voice hoarse. “What a sight you make. So responsive… yes, let me hear you, sweetheart, let me hear what feels good for you… so sweet, so perfect taste in my tongue… you are like silk made of flesh, darling, I would like to wrap this gift to something soft and nice… or maybe… or maybe I will just ask them if I can have one of silken gowns… just like the ones I used to have…. I remember how you liked to slide your fingers on my shoulders… to touch… to touch me discreetly like…”
Maybe he was so crap in this because it always made Antonio smile. The truth was these both future worlds just had too many buttons, lots of them with only some symbols. Some had texts, but it didn’t make it much easier. Mediaplayer. Blueray. DVD. CD. He never remembered which one was the which device.
Bonding with the others didn’t went so smoothly. He got Fury’s idea, put men into the barrack to sleep, eat, shit together, and you get yourself a natural born team.
Like his team ever listened to him! Or yes, of course they listened when he was reasonable and made moves in the field, but even a child could see this was not a tactical decision, this was only pride and other stupid emotions. One of his own was badly wounded and it had been his call, it was his duty to put the end to this lunacy.
It really was Steve, and it was not a baby-sitting call, they had gotten a message from the Richards. The problem with the equation hadn’t been solved, but Sue Richards had invented means around it. They had first thought the nanotech markers were the same in the both universes, which would have made tracking them impossible, but then Sue Richards had noticed some minor, but very distinguishable variation from the samples. They still needed that equation to send their guests back home, but for tracking Antonio this was enough for the moment. The Richards had been launching microprobes all over the area, and there was already some positives. The data would be sent straight to the portable locators Tony did for them last night. That meant the team was going to meet on the roof in five minutes.
Tony kicked the trousers off and did as Steve had asked. Steve was on his knees still, worshiping the smooth curve of his lover’s ass and heavy balls which were strangely hairless. Steve hadn’t known anybody else than those ladies of the night who shaved themselves down there. It was probably just a practice of this modern time, Tony hadn’t done it especially for him, but the thought of it managed to provoke Steve despite of the purpose. Steve growled and pushed his tongue inside Tony’s hole, teasing his rim and alternating sucking and pushing until Tony was only a trembling, breathless mess, who could hardly keep himself upright.
“Oh Tony, when was the last time you ate something? Slept? Bruce said you are binge inventing again.”
Doctor Heller had just said his piece as the alarm started to blast. In the scene one there stood now a seven feet tall robot, or somebody inside a robotic armor, which vaguely reminded Fury of those Stark had designed, but this one had not sleek surfaces or light colors like Stark’s original works. It was all black and grays, but the strong magnetic field locked it onto the floor anyway. The concentrated EMP seals, which Doctor Heller was closing around the thing, destroyed the rest of its mobility. That taken cared of, he could move to observe the specimen on the stage two. The agents had already surrounded the man in a dark combat gear. He was tall and muscular like a soldier, carrying handguns on his both hips and sporting a short bear which was lightly darker blond than his hair. On his chest there was a faint gray mark which looked like a star. On his right hand, the newcomer was carrying a shield. That was dark too, only blacks and grays and blues, but its shape and the guy’s fighting stance didn’t leave much room for speculation.
“I always have that face when I am scared for something or somebody and out of my luck”, he explained. “I think Tony’s theory sounds solid. Tony, get him out of that thing and then, Clint, you can give him his shield back. I really don’t like the way you are touching it. I looks… unsavory.”
“Shoot that mother-fucker!” he shouted to the other Steve on the screen, but there was no real heat behind his words, and then a red and golden missile shot through the air, a mighty flying knight, who wasn’t still the one he was waiting for. (He didn’t start to ponder the irony of that last sentence, because in his very much black and white thinking it would have made him a princess of this fairy tale.)
“If it was me, I would be searching the mansion right now”, Steve was saying. “Are you sure there is nothing in our old stuff that the other Steve can find and use to harm us?”
The thing had killed Bruce, but not because of meal. Now when Fury had calmed down and considered the situation, he admitted Captain had attacked like a soldier thinking he was surrounded by his enemies.
“Hang in there, buddy. We are almost home. We can think this situation like rational adults and sip some sports drink, maybe that’s is, are you dehydrated? This is a quite sunny day, you know, and you in your helmet...”
“Tony! Focus! He in probably on his feet again and you know how fast he runs. I don’t want to be there when he catches me up. I have to hide. I got an idea. Follow my signal.”
Now was Steve’s turn to snort. “You don’t give yourself enough credit, Tony. You think I am able to keep up any sensible conversation you looking and smelling like that? I was just thinking to give you heads up. This is not going to change that.” Steve put one of his massive paws on Tony’s shoulder. His thumb started making a teasing circle over his collarbone. “For a moment there you looked like you wanted something sweet.”
“Steve”, Tony started, and even his robotic voice succeeded to sound disturbed. “I would never… You can’t mean...”
The door opened again and there were real Rogers and Stark, or their Rogers and Stark, Fury meant, and he was able to make proper comparisons. Starks had the light resemble close relatives could have, but this Anthony was way older, about Fury’s age, and a short man with big, dark eyes, which made him look like a purse puppy between two German shepherds. Rogers he had begged already, but Steve’s boy, Bucky… Damn, how could that be James Barnes! He was as tall as Rogers combo, with pretty boy hair and bad-ass cybernetic arm, which could easily rip a metal door from its hinges.
about ten times because of that old limey bastard. No wonder our Steve started to fancy Stark. They are two nice speaking gents.”
Yes, that had been only a half of it. He took his trousers off like a zombie, never minding he was going commando around his protective gear. The other Steve could have asked him to bark like a dog and he would probably have done it.
“New smells, fresh and clear”, he said, looking nowhere particular. “Like all the people I have met here in this place. Strange smells, like you were not regular persons at all, but like those androids I read from the pulp novels. You missy, you smell rich, fancy food, nose-tickling chemicals, gun power, and metal you hide in your clothes. A used, familiar knife no guard would have left on you because they would have beaten and shamed your flesh long after they had found your weapon.”
“If they were alive during the initial transfer”, Doctor Heller returned to his favorite subject. “If their bodies weren’t instantly destroyed or transported to the place occupied by an alien race, which all seem to be hostile toward humans for some reason, there are numerous other dangerous element to consider. The anomaly may had left them to a place there is is no atmosphere or gravity, or if those are suitable for human, there could be other extreme elements: hot, cold, too much water, too little water, no suitable animals or plants for consumption. That is to say, even if they ended up in the paradise or among primitive, friendly aliens, even that would not be enough knowing Mr. Stark’s medical condition. The absolute best we can hope for is to get contact with Captain Rogers, which is, as I previously stated, very unlikely. Fortunately the scoop doesn’t differ between living or dead tissue, so we are probably getting something of them one way or another, dead or alive, intact or in pieces.”
He tried to sit up, which turned out to be a bad idea. First, his armor was dead, so no moving for Tony in a near future. Secondly, jerking his body made a lighting of pain shot through his rib cage and chest, indicating he probably had gained some internal damages. No, he thought, when the tell-tale numb feeling started to move from his fingertips to the other parts of his body and his eyes sparkled with tiny lights.
He lurched forward as the jet abruptly stopped. The other Steve helped his exit by giving his back a powerful push. As soon as he knew it, he was in free fall only his shield to cover him.
“Alright, my father was a conductor”, she mumbled. “No trains! We lived in Saint Petersburg when… No farmers, no.
“I said I will bite him, if that was what he wanted. And I did. A half a dozen times, if I recall. He seemed to want it for real. Most of people don’t like to be bitten, but he liked his pain or just bared it thinking the end result.”
“A game? Not quite. And that would be like leaving half out of it. I am not exactly like you, darling. I like women too.”
“I know that face too. I would take you to our gym, to let out some pressure, but you ate quite a lot. It’s better to wait at least an hour.
The guy promised to make a call next time he went outside. Tony rasped out Fury’s number. He wasn’t overly surprised when the guy came back and said the line was not in use. Probably he had just forgotten the whole thing.
Tony was now tense like a plank in his arms, denial drawn into the every line of his being. “You can’t make that decision. You can’t let me go. The team needs Iron Man.”
“Look at these soft fingertips. My brother’s miss makes them manicure things for the ladies, this one looks like he would sit in her pink, padded chair regularly. A soldier… this guy hasn’t done an honest day’s work in his life.”
“My Bucky”, he started. “He… when they thought I was dead, Bucky and my fiancee Gail, they found each others. They have been married over seven decades now.”
“Whoa! Hold your horses, big guy. Nobody is trying to rattle open the door of your itchy-bitchy closet.”
Tony took a cup, and really, it looked like some kind of pudding. He tasted it and saw how Steve eyes moved to somewhere under his jaw as he swallowed. Was Steve smelling… cigarettes for some reason?
She had thought Antonio was sleeping, he was so still, but his eyes were open and looking at her when she took his right side beside the bed.
They went to the elevator and ride down some five floors. There was a large lounge area and after that a common room and a kitchen. Tony had continued the journey down, but the others seemed to have rooms of their own on that same floor.
“S-Steve”, he stammered, like a damn kid his hand in a cookie jar… yes, it would have been a good, old-fashioned euphemism for the act he had been considering.
She was up at the same moment he was on her. Her knife pushed against the skin over his collarbone, his organic twin blades at the same place on her neck.
The exact address told them the other Steve and that Falcon fellow were near the area, they would make it there first.
They were going to find Antonio! He had never dressed himself so quickly, the unfamiliar fastening system of the other Steve’s uniform top making only a light hindrance. He had just stepped in the elevator and pushed the button of the top floor, when somebody called his name. It was a pretty brunette in a superhero uniform (those differed from agent uniforms by being more flashy). This one was modest for a woman, only black kevlar with some yellow safety stripes. Probably she was one of those still unknown Avengers the other Steve had mentioned. He started to ask which floor she was going (maybe she was not accompanying them to the mission) and then he almost jumped into the air; the little lady had slapped his behind.
He had tried to make a hasty U-turn, but that hadn’t gone so well either. “You are stupid”, he said, tapping a still half-hard organ. “Stupid and mean little Tony.”
Tony seemed to be sure their visitors were romantically linked or at least Antonio was pining hard after his Captain. Antonio had indeed felt quite amorous to Steve, but he being a Stark, it could be only common prurience talking and nothing to do with actual feelings.
“Don’t worry. If there is any way they can locate your teammate, they will find it. You just need to be well rested when that happens. So… After you rip those off, it is shower time. Then food and bed. Do you need any help?”
For long minutes, they lay there like beached, misshaped whales. The smells of musk, cum, blood, and sweat lingered heady in the air, making Steve’s mind spin. He collected Tony into his arms and licked first his neck, then his chest and abdomen which were covered with white stripes of Tony’s semen.
“Be careful”, the first voice was now saying. “It may not be Stark himself, but what if he is one of those others? They are saying that Iron Patriot is again operational. What if...”
“Alright, nice theories, but my gut is still telling me that this is all some kind of huge misunderstanding”, Janet said with a determined wrinkle forming over her nose. “What do you think Sam? You got any feelings about them?”
“Good afternoon, Captain. Tony explained the situation. That nanofluid you mentioned... Have you been in contact with it regularly?”
Steve sighed. “Yes, it gives one kind of peace of mind. I think that is the main purpose of religion, to give us hope. The thing is, I am not like you. There is no one inside me. This is me. All of it. There is nothing to control.”
It had been a humbling experience. But thanks to his team, a group of people who was now his new family, it had become better.
“Oh my god, Steve”, he mumbled, as his teammate were adjusting that dreamy specimen of manliness alongside Tony’s more shopsoiled one. This guy was going to be a death of him.
“No, you must be kidding me”, Nat sighed. “What is he, Luke Skywalker? It seems that the part of the blast damaged the cooling system of our motor. The backup will hold it stable some ten minutes, but then I have to get her down or we will go Death Star.”
Fury classified that other team under twin categories of possible threats and possible allies. But there was still some things he wasn’t satisfied with.
Tony being Tony, Steve hadn’t liked him much in the beginning. Tony was too loud, too vague for Steve’s precise taste, too undisciplined and civilian to be a good soldier boy in Cap’s new team. Sometimes he thought the supersoldier tolerated him with the same careful interest he would sample a potentially dangerous zoo animal. What danger Tony would represent that was only play in Tony’s own mind. A silly daydream about those angry lips, how his witty banter would turn them into a fond smile. Steve’s gaze shining with some secret inner mirth, that stiff neck bending until Tony was able to push their mouths together...
There seemed to be sodas and sport drinks and water bottles. Tony didn’t drop the box, he put it carefully on the floor instead when he saw who was coming towards them from the elevator.
That guy was seriously starting to get on his nerves. “Tilted lovers”, Steve scuffed. “That is your reliable source? There is always propaganda and rumors.”
“Oh Steve. That was so long time ago. I am sure your friend would have forgiven you, of course he would. I did Steve, when you asked me to.”
“Have you heard… you should buy flowers and chocolate. Not to run off like a scared little rabbit right after earth shattering sex.”
Thor’s words had only made Steve to tighten his grip. The hammer was heavy, but not so heavy he would have difficulties to move it like that drunken idiot had stated.
He had nothing to say to that one. If he had liked to say something, it would have been impossible right now. His heart had started pounding so fast his ears ringed as his lungs tried to get more oxygen into his bloodstream. Any other person, and they would have said he was on the verge of a panic attack. That was impossible of course, Captain America didn’t have anything to do with some ninny business these modern people were so good at.
But a Nazi spy had skilled Erskine before he was able to complete their plan. Steve had been the first one, a pretty-faced specimen to prove the serum’s worth to politicians and Army generals, and then he was all alone. What he had seen this far, or rather not seen, told him his people were still hiding if they had not been found out and discreetly murdered by the government during his long sleep. Just like the Nazis had tried to do to the children of Abraham.
After those ominous words, the security tape from the lab was showed. Steve’s awaking was followed by lot’s of screaming and blood, and yeah, Banner had not lied. He had died and gotten better.
“Moronic enough?” he asked, stepping in front of Clint, who suddenly tried to push himself inside the wall. “If things I care about, people I love are in danger, I am not moronic, I am damn lethal and resourceful, and I will fight without any mercy until my opponents are dust or I myself fall on the ground, dead as a door nail. You should know that, and you idiot just had to arrange so we have no idea if they are perpetrators or victims in this situation.”
Steve-on-the-floor had fallen silent, staring with an open-mouthed disbelieve which was quickly turning into anger. He squished a soda can in his hand and threw it toward Tony.
She was already stepping into the elevator again. “Yes, dear”, Tony mumbled, seemingly not noticing her departing. “Steve… Or at least Steve”, Tony urged, still pulling his arm. “Come here, quickly! Reed wants to talk with you.”
Natasha didn’t stay to look how Steve managed. “Out! Out of the way!” she shouted while running, knowing Steve couldn’t be badly hurt, his reflexes and agility were not quite as good as Spider-Man’s, but enough that his misstep would only slow him down. Natasha run and blessed her wide helms and her comm which Tony had made to look like an ordinary Bluetooth device with a range to match the best satellite phones.
They had been kissing. Why on Earth he hadn’t kept just doing that? But no, he had dived straight to the guy’s dick, tried to smother him with his tongue and then said all kind of dirty things while doing that. It was a crappy first time…
“Is that so”, Tony said and raised his eyebrow. “I have a board meeting and shitload of work I should have been doing instead of lazing in my bed.”
They were on it already. The logic said the perps wouldn’t have wanted to carry their load far; it should mean that the other Tony was somewhere here, downstairs. But on the other hand, maybe they had been smart and transported him further, someplace he wouldn’t be able to crawl out and call for help.
The monster spoke for the first time. His voice was raspy, like after a long speech, when there was no water bottle beside the microphone.
It took a few days, but then the glass cell and Steve had another visitor. This was an odd one. A tall man, muscular and blond, in a chain mail shirt and winged helmet. He had a hammer, but that was too big and fancy-looking to be a tool of a smith.
There was indeed one figure Steve hadn’t met before. He was wholly covered in red and golden metal armor and seemed not to be interested in taking the initiative. More like Doctor Banner then, a shy fellow.
“Tony is still alive? Jesus, look at that hickey! Damn, I should have bet only about that, now I lost twenty bucks. Hey, Sanders! Could you make a copy of that surveillance tape? Split the profit?”
She put the piglet down on the floor, from where it looked at them confused. Why did its entertainment center stop working?
After Iron Man joined the fight it was soon over. Maybe they really didn’t need guns around here. Not this time, anyway.
“Odin’s beard”, Thor mumbled. “Brother Monster, please release Mjolnir. I think my comrades in arms are laughing at us in their magic device.”
“I am called Black Widow”, she said, dropping the act. “We knew Hydra had you as a prisoner once, but we didn’t know about the executions. I am sorry. I told my superiors this was a bad idea.”
“When you played to me your little act, you shook in fright and your heart fluttered”, he said, his words making his teeth scrape her skin. “You sweat and tears streamed from your eyes. But now, now in this place, seconds from the death, your heart is calm like a frozen lake. Do you even know anymore what is true and what is not?”
Suddenly Tony had no time to ponder anything else. He heard the wheeze of the saw, felt it rattle the back of his armor. The movement felt tenfold in his chest and ribs and he couldn’t prevent a scream of pain escaping from his lips.
“I, my friend, am a billionaire genius. I want some nice things, I do them, or pay somebody else to do them for me… Yes, as you see, Steve”, he continued to Steve-not-sitting. “Your double has been like that from the beginning... he is totally delusional. What do you think, buddy of mine, you don’t have a secret evil twin? No? If this is a clone to infiltrate our team, they have surely done crappy job about it.”
“Now help old woman into her throne”, Gail ordered. Steve pushed a wheelchair next to the table, but changed his mind and lifted Gail into his arms. She giggled like a teenage girl.
“You know it will hurt. I can take it, it is not a big deal, and I heal really fast. I don’t want our thing to be like… She just said go on, and I... I already told you Tony, I am not going to hurt you. Even if you ask me to.”
Antonio Stark was not a warrior. He had invented his armor that he had something… something new and interesting to do when he was waiting for the big C to kill him, and maybe later he had thought he could make a difference… He thought how Steve would have acted in his place and knew they considered him a coward.
Except in Korea. In Vietnam. And in some other places the narrator mentioned but Steve couldn’t see in his mind. Either of the new superpowers didn’t start anything final, however, because both of them had now
“Barton, shut up! Stark, put your fucking clothes on! Nobody wants to see your scrawny ass! Captain Rogers, are you alright?”
Thor shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t usually understand what Brother Green talks about. Did his words mean anything to you, Warrior Monster?”
Her back was against the door. Her legs had given away from fright and she was sitting on the floor, pushing her hands forward, a laughable attempt to keep away a man who just the other day had pummeled himself halfway through triple reinforced safety window.
“Afghanistan.” Tony pronounced the word like a curse. It was obvious something horrible had happened to him in that place. “I don’t know, Steve. Maybe…”
She noticed he was not her team leader after being with him about five seconds? Even if they looked exactly alike and he was wearing the other Steve’s gear. Maybe they should hire her as a spy.
After that surprise opening Fury needed a little break and Stark delivered. “Carol, in that other universe you got these cool superpowers and they called you Captain Marvel.”
He left Nat in the balcony and shot upwards. Clint had already shot Steve with his net arrow and while the super soldier tried to sort himself out of the mess, it was easy for Tony to disarm him.
There were lots of extravagant costumes or almost no costumes at all. Steve with a striped, multicolored flag painted on his cheek, kissing a guy with brown, longish hair.
The rest of the sentence was buried somewhere under his fist. While Anderson junior slumped backwards, he took a grip from his shirt front, pulled the guy toward him and knocked his nose out of its normal place with his helmet-covered forehead.
Barton looked scandalized. “Oh, it was a joke! I would never… but you have to watch out with Stark. What his former lovers have told about him...”
So much so different people. So funny clothes, hairs, make-ups. It was like being in a cabaret show just when he jogged down the streets on ordinary Wednesday afternoon.
“I just recalled. You vain boy. You wanted to be like a movie star. Now we all now why. Men, they are so picky.”
“Fury”, Banner was saying. “I think he can hear you. Hi there”, Banner greeted. Before Fury had time to react, the idiot was besides the table again. “You gave us quite a fright. Captain Rogers? Is that you?”
The thought made him feel angry and betrayed. They were strangers, but he had already liked them a little, even that cunt Romanoff… No, probably not her, but the others. They had seemed to be so no-nonsense about his and Antonio’s situation that Steve had thought they would really make it back home. And instead…
“Great! My comrades in arms, bring forward the shield of Captain! NO! Bring it forward! I said all the weapons. Do you want to make Thor, son of Odin, a liar? Do you want to make him your enemy?”
He felt Tony’s fingers in his hair, his reassuring, haltering whispers telling him how it was alright. He didn’t have to do anything, just leave Tony a little something that he could use to return their generous hospitality, if not with a whole gift basket, at least one pineapple with some explosive vitamin C.
That made Stark shut his mouth. They descended the stairs and came at the other door. There were two armed agents, but they saluted and stepped aside when Fury and Stark entered the front room of the lab, where they put on the same gear Doctor Banner and his crew were wearing.
Sam thanked him and then he and Jake started stripping him out of the armor. Tony tried not to utter a sound, but when they yanked the biggest part over his head and pulled his arms up and moved his body… No way he could keep it silent, and he knew he had earned the sarcastic tone in Sam’s acknowledgment.
This time his landing was more successful. He dropped, spin, and jumped up on his feet in one fluid motion, in his regular size again, as Janet had promised. They were on the roof of some apartment building. According the records Tony had found, Anderson junior lived on the third floor.
Tony went but not until he had given Steve a stink eye. Steve prepared the bed, wondering the soft, pristine white sheets, which were cool to his touch. Tony had washed himself and was still deliciously humid, his towel dry hair spiked. He was also totally naked and Steve felt a short jerk inside his pants.
There were times Fury wanted to grab the labels of Tony’s expensive suit and shake some sense into the man. “Didn’t you hear what I said? Your vintage poster boy just killed your teammate. Not to mention he tried to kill us. Jesus, you have been only fifteen minutes without booze, your brains can’t stop working already.”
If Fury hadn’t known better, he would have said the sight made Rogers misty-eyed. Then he bent and kissed that other Stark on his forehead.
“Nothing, Tony. I am just thinking… going to escort you to your room now. Remember? Like I used to do. Maybe we could have a drink? Talk a little? You can tell me what science thingies you have imagined during the day or all the important people you have met. You act for me the most pompous and moronic ones, and we can laugh at that.”
“Tell you what, I haven’t missed that at all”, Anthony snorted. “You rude bastards! Its not my fault I didn’t get enough vitamins as a kid like you giants.”
The Widow’s Bite didn’t usually have much effect against enraged supersoldiers, but the protocol Steve had suggested was a dirty trick, an electroshock from Nat’s bracelet got even his full attention when administrated into his ear. No wonder SteveToo howled like a banshee and was momentarily distracted so that Iron Man could finally pull that dangerous shield away.
Steve growled like an angry lion, but his fingers were already on the waist of his sweats. Tony had kept his tone light and teasing, and when the running shoes and pants were finally away, the soldier was smirking back, a douse of mirth of his own playing in his eyes.
Steve started peeling an orange. He had turned sideways to Tony, counting in his mind. His bulge was clearly in sight as he put a slice of the fruit into his mouth and popped it with his left fang. The juice trickled down his chin. He wiped it away, licking his fingers clean. What else would his tongue be licking, Tony could ponder about that. The man had lost all the pretense of a cool indifference and stared at him like hypnotized.
“Yes, the man is hopeless”, Barton huffed. “We have well established that. If you wanna date or have some funny times Nat can vet for you half a dozen more suitable candidates just like that.”
This was terrible. This was worse than the fear of the bomb, which he could get used to, but this, this was too much.
There was talk about how the team operated. Steve was showed films about their battles. It was really confusing. Those people… most of them looked at least as enhanced as Steve, and he wondered could there be others like him, hiding under their masks while participating in this costume play.
Had Rogers been always that morbid? No, he was smirking, or maybe he was smirking at the Stark who was not dying of cancer.
“You don’t need them here. Tony has this state of art alarm system… And Captain can’t be seen shooting around. Hopefully, the woman you shot will be alright. For her sake and ours, if you wonder. Pepper will be very angry with us again.”
“I have to apologize”, the man said after Tony had dressed himself and left. “This was not how this was supposed to go. We don’t usually lock people up and then jump on their bones. I know how persuasive Tony can be and… Are you really alright?”
No worry about that. Then those damn shakes started again and maybe he could have seen how worry oozed out of Steve, if he had been able to keep his eyes open.
It seemed the only smart one among them was Ralph, as Steve had named the piglet Fury gave him to eat. Ralph learned to use the piggy toilet they made for him and followed Barton around, waiting the tidbits he carried in his pockets. That little traitor.
Steve was sometimes a potty mouth when fueled by adrenaline. Still, the moniker, which could have carried a taste of a bad inside joke, didn’t sound endearing at all. Steve’s tone and demeanor made it a pure-bred insult.
Tony was skillful like his father. He made miracles from metal and wires and other things Steve didn’t recognize. Why didn’t he want anybody to know that he was not only behind but also inside of those wonders?
“Some four miles. We can call Nat, but that will take her out of the search of those other leads, and if this will prove to be a bust… I fly over 40 mph. We would be there in five minutes.”
First he thought that his sleep deprived brain had heard it wrong. The both women had strawberry red hairs and plain, freckled faces, but that was the only connection there was. The whole demeanor of Antonio’s personal assistant screamed she wanted to be invisible while at the same time she was hopelessly infatuated with her boss. But this one… She was like a battleship in heels and a pencil skirt.
Steve would have wanted to. Oh how he wanted, there was no concealing his hard-on in his tight sport pants. “You should sleep.”
“Look, this is us. This is the Avengers in NYC Pride last year, that is from the closing ceremony in Times Square. Do you have those kind of celebrations in your universe?”
The armor stood still, even if the man inside sounded he was about to faint. Tony opened his visor and took a long pull from the water bottle. “Yes, much better. The new cooling system… some adjustments… but about our visitor here...”
Speaking of Tony. He should have been around. Tony lived just a few stories away from them, but somehow missed their meals and those gathering the others called the movie nights.
Fury could say that again. The observatory window was about nine feet from the floor but Captain America had jumped on the overhand like a person could ascend on the first step of the stairs. He was pummeling the glass, which cracked under his ministration.
“Yeah, yeah. Didn’t believe then, don’t believe now. When do you bring him here? One more person pissing into his pants doesn’t matter.”
“They told me how you bested the Incredible Brother Green with your slyness and power! That you ripped his throat right open, his blood landing on your armor like those flowers maidens throw over the warriors heading to the battle. Very fine deed! How I would have wanted to see the sight with my own eyes, your pleasant and fair form changed, and you fighting fierce as Fenris, the great devourer of the worlds!”
They walked in an awkward silence down the corridor until their trail ended in front of the room-sized glass jar. Technically the walls of the cell weren’t glass, but unbelievable strong alien substance which would take a nuclear strike without a scratch, but Fury always called it glass, because its major ingredient was unpronounceable with human vocal chords. And it was see-through if they wanted it to be.
He didn’t need to ponder that one out. “Alright. What will we do to the arm? Do we just leave it here?”
“Don’t you try to bribe me, Steve! What is this rumor saying you were carrying a gun! You just told us in that Cosmo interview you hate guns. The roar that a certain association made after your little confession, one would think you were planning to murder their first-born children. We backed you up then, but now… Are you trying to make the team look foolish? And shooting people in public! If they had been at least bad people…”
He had pulled out of Tony, feeling how the restlessness beat under Tony’s skin. His eyes wandered from Steve to the closet and back. He would need a new shower and new clothes, but Steve knew Tony didn’t think of those things. He had been drinking in the closed while he dressed himself, and now when his Steve-shaped distraction was over, that was the place Tony wanted to be, with a thing which kept Tony going instead of breakfast or afternoon shag.
Somebody grabbed his hair. A rough and wet cloth was moved all over his face and then the fingers released him again. His neck muscles had just enough power to let his head slowly down onto the cement floor.
The man didn’t look like an alien. He looked very human, but if he claimed he was not, maybe that made them the same. Thor Odinson, the God of Thunder, the man had introduced himself to Steve.
“My adoptive father, you mean. First he acquired me to be a stand-in for his beloved but sick biological son and then he replaced me with a ghost of the one perfect son the poor Howard never was able to get despite of all his wealth and earthly goods. This it too hilarious. Hi there, brother superior. Look at him, Fury! He doesn’t even look dead. It is like he is sleeping. Thank God my father is not alive. He would cream him pants and embarrass us all acting like a little fan girl.”
building in Berlin, and it could have been better only if it had been their stars and stripes. He watched with a grim satisfaction as the great German cities lay in ruins after Allied bombings. Steve felt no sympathy for those wretched people. You reap what you sow. There it was again, the main reason of his cold anger, the concentration camps, skeletal bodies, dead women and children, and for what, for the glory of the Fatherland? Nice looking glory, built on the bones of the children of Abraham.
He was afraid they would start to fight and forget all about Antonio, but Tony grinned at his team leader and got back to his call. If that was what he was doing. Their exchange had been only bantering. They seemed to do it a lot around here. When Ultimates bantered… Well, they didn’t. They fought, plain and simple, and the rest of the time they somehow tolerated each others. But these people seemed to be different. They acted much like a family.
“Super soldier serum”, Doctor Banner was mumbling. “I suspected it could preserve his cells on some level, but like this… this is incredible.”
Steve liked a guy who knew his own mind. That lube thing let out a faint apple smell. It felt cold and slippery as Steve rubbed it between his fingers. A coarse gun grease or vaseline would have been out of place here in Tony’s fine bed.
It didn’t take but some ten minutes when he saw how a very familiar red and white and blue shield shot through the air and straight to the birdman’s head.
What did Tony see? Steve didn’t think he saw much except his own pain. “Please, Tony. Go to sleep. I am not rejecting you. I want to be a gentleman. At least once in my life. Please, indulge me.”
“Yes”, SteveToo said. The glowing net was suddenly gone and he stood up, locking his knees and standing at parade rest as his host continued the introductions. “That guy with the worst one liners in town is Clint Barton aka Hawkeye, and Tony Stark… Anthony, actually, not Antonio. Our invincible Iron Man and a tech genius, the designer of the sci-fi goodies you will see around here. There are others, but they are on a mission or rotating their free days, so you are not going to meet them at least today. We are part of the SHIELD’s strike team against superpowered or extraterrestrial threats. We are called the Avengers. Do you have something like that in your universe?”
of July for little o-old me? I am m-mighty f-flattered darling, I r-really am, but… shouldn’t you c-consider...”
She was ordered to mingle and make friends. Later, she spied and betrayed those friends. She killed many innocent people. Many, many years she did this. So many, many times.
The big black screen woke up, filling itself with light and action. It was the news. Steve boggled. Now it was the battle-zone he had expected after first appearance into this universe. There were broken and burning cars and general rampage as the police tried to move people to the safety from the way of the fast-paced battle. Was it a battle? First it seemed like some mutated animal had escaped from the mad scientist’s lab, but it wasn’t a real rhino, it was a guy.
“Remember your fucking language! Falcon, you stay with Hawkeye, we got this! Widow, stop that! It is no use! Captain protocol! Now!”
Rogers gave out a little sad laugh after hearing his old name. “I thought nobody would ever call me that again.”
Straight to the point. That was good. At least that Steve was not an idiot. Maybe he and Antonio had some hope left.
