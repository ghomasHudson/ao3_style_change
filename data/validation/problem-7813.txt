“Hey,” Steve took Tony’s shaking hands into his own, “we need to calm down and get Happy out of here. I don’t know if somehow Stane knew about Happy’s betrayal was trying to get rid of him.”
He repeated the question and finally she replied, “writing up-writing up the condolences letters. Listen we can go talk to him. See what happened with the missing soldiers. See what we can do.”
Tony led Steve back to there booth and showed him what he was working on. Focusing on Tony’s words and hands was a good way to help soothe him. Not long after, Steve left the rest of them to continue their work while he went to drop off the artifact to the client.
Journey to where? Steve wondered but he never got a reply.
“You are not a pet friend Tony,” Thor also added patting Tony on the shoulder in encouragement.
“He is talking about Tony Thor,” Nat cut in helpfully taking the burden away from Tony. It seemed hard for Tony to speak those words out loud. Tony smiled gratefully at her and she gave a small smile in return.
“Sleeping beauty? HEY WAI-” Tony didn’t hear the rest of the man’s words as it was blocked by the wind crashing against his ears as he jumped. It was a dangerous height but he has done these kinds of jumps before and knew how to land safely.
It was now or never. Steve looked over the stall door to see the stable boy on the other side. He was too far to stop Steve and get in his way of taking the horse. Steve hated having to interact or knock out innocent bystanders like the stable boy.
It took a few seconds but Steve heard a soft tapping against metal inside the tent and Steve knew it was Tony responding to Steve. It made him happy to hear the harpy actually giving Steve a more positive response. He turned and sat with the rest of the team who sat around the fire a few feet away humming old tunes that they used to sing in the village where they grew up.
And so he ran. Ran faster than he thought possible. Steve needed to get there. Needed to see his face. The face of the one he refused to forget. The one he made sure to always remember. That was everyone’s last wish. That he remembered them. It is what they all deserved for saving their universe. Tony most of all. The world remembers what he has done. Steve fought for them to remember, to cherish what they have for what they gave.
Tony blanched, mentally panicking at hearing the date. He was in the future. Or a future. Someone’s future. Maybe not even his own. Someone who got Steve to put a ring on their finger. This was definitely someone’s sick joke to mess with Tony’s head. Maybe he wasn’t even in the future.
“I fucked up Buck,” Steve groaned into his hands.
“I know. Thank you,” was all Tony said and Steve found solace in those words.
“We were supposed to do this together,” Tony cried out, “that was the plan! What am I supposed to do now Rogers?”
“I really hope it goes well man,” Sam said before both he and Bucky said goodbye leaving Steve alone in his thoughts again.
“Fuuuuuck,” Tony rolled the word off his tongue as he felt the vibrations of Steve’s chuckle over his dick, making it even harder to keep himself together. This man really was gunning to have Tony instantaneously combust.
It wasn't until Steve took down his last foe when he noticed that there was no one else to fight. Stane was stuck to the stage being held down at arrow point by Clint and Bucky while Tony stood center stage with Pepper and Rhodey, who joined a bit after the fight had begun, looking towards the confused bystanders. Steve saw Nat, Sam Bruce, and Thor move out of sight to let Tony be center stage.
They made it back to the marketplace and to Pepper’s hideout without being spotted by Tony’s family who were still out shopping. Pepper rushed pulling Tony into a tight hug before turning to papa Rhodes and doing the same with him. She checked them over before taking the robes back from Tony and ushered them out the door and to Rhodey’s location.
He found the stables easy. The only thing standing in his way was a fifteen year old kid which he probably could get past without too much of a fuss. As quietly as he could Steve snuck into the nearest stall from the open door he had come through. He spotted a large black horse with a white streak running down the length of his face. Steve found the horse beautiful and almost felt bad for having to take it.
Steve stepped out of the tent but before he let go of the flap he gave Tony one last reassuring smile. He knew Tony still felt like at any moment Steve would change his mind and Tony would be forced to go back to slavery but Steve would never let that happen. He shook his head and chased those thoughts away. They were on the move again and Steve needed to help get the camp packed for their journey. Maybe the next investment should be a carriage horse instead of forcing him and Thor to pull the supply cart around.
He drifted off looking at Tony’s face. The harpy just sat where he was pressed up against Steve blinking at him dumbly. It seemed to take awhile for his words to hit because a moment later Tony’s face turned beat red and he quickly bolted out the tent. Steve just sat there not knowing how to feel or what to do. This whole time Tony thought of him as his master. That Steve was just another one of those human men who would abuse him. He felt the anger and frustration at those who bought him and hurt him come boiling back. But he was also angry at himself for not seeing it sooner. That Tony had spent weeks silently doing what he was told, staying with him and the team, stubbornly staying in Steve’s tent thinking he had to because somehow Steve peeping in on him meant he wanted to force him to have sex with him.
“Pepper, Rhodey-we have to get them out first!” Tony shot up heading for his armor but Steve grabbed his arm and hated that he had to stop him from doing that.
Steve spotted Bucky in the corner binding the extra cut wood together for later use. His friend looked up at Steve as he approached him. Bucky looked ready to ask a million questions but let Steve do the talking. Steve groaned and slumped down next to Bucky who rolled his eyes at him. Bucky knew he must have messed something up if Steve came to him like this.
Now he will get to see him. After five hundred years he will get to look into those eyes and hear his voice. Steve knew that the droids would never live up to the real thing but it will still very much be
“We tried everything but Tony was adamant about staying in the tent. He refused to eat until I threatened to tell you that and how upset you would be if he didn't eat,” Bucky answered crossing his arms over his chest as he too looked at Steve's tent.
Steve stared into the trees for a moment in fear. Tony never talked about his kind and it was odd to Steve because Tony seemed to have talked about everything else except that which made Steve worry even more. It is known that harpies are very isolated as a species and to catch a harpy they would have to have been sold out by their own, abandoned when young or lost. Steve had a feeling that Tony was betrayed by his own kind and seeing them take him away brought an on a panic within him.
“I know but I am scared. I already have been walking on thin ice already,” Steve sighed getting up from his spot next to Bucky. His friend patted him on the leg in encouragement as he went back to tying the logs correctly and securely.
Let me know what you think! Like it? Hate it? What do you think is coming next?
“Sorry Buck,” Steve answered sheepishly picking up his burger to take his first bite, “got somethin’ on my mind is’all.”
The man shoved Tony hard sending him a few feet away with a little gasp of pain exiting his lips, “GET OUT OF MY WAY!”
That night Steve dreamed about him. About the mystery man he sometimes called Anton. He would stand next him and press himself closely to Steve. Steve let the man take control. Let him talk to him. Sooth him. It was almost heartbreakingly peaceful. The man said things he did not fully understand but it made him feel comforted all the same.
“This way,” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear as Tony pressed up against the door and gave the soft signal to Pepper. A few long moments later, the door was propped open and the Avengers moved into the castle. Their plan was ago.
Follow me on
Pepper sat in the room with Tony as he got changed into the borrowed clothes. She kept a close eye to the streets making sure that nothing was going to jeopardize the mission. If anyone that knew them was out in the streets it could blow their cover. If a servant is seen wearing a lord’s clothes they either are sent to prison or to the Americas.
“His name is Tony,” the merchant sneered at the cage, “or at least that was what the people who sold him to me called him.”
Steve swallowed down those thoughts before replying, “I don’t know, I think if complements you’re gorgeous feathers. I got to find a way to compete somehow.”
“My wife,” Tony pressed one more time finally getting a look at himself through a reflection on one of the glass planes. He was young, and looked a lot like himself but not really, his eyes were blue to start.
The prince felt no pain just sorrow. He began to cry telling his lover that he loved him and that he was sorry. His lover cried harder when he discovered that his prince had taken the blow instead of him. He was the worthless one. He was supposed to be dead. The prince was needed by his people. The prince was worth more than ten of him. He sobbed holding the prince close to his chest, watching as the rain uncaringly washed the prince’s blood away.
“Nah I got a date of my own and I don’t want to have your sorry ass chasing off my Valentine with your sulking,” Sam replied easily making Steve laugh. His friend did know how to cheer him up a bit.
They were in the middle of a training session right now and Tony was giving him some snarky comments as he threw a punch at Steve who easily dodged it. Tony was swift and light on his feet and knew a bit about using his opponent’s weight against them. Too bad for Tony, Steve was well versed in combat and knew how to hold his own quite well from attacks. “That all ya got?” Steve provoked Tony who seemed to have taken the bait. Tony went for a low kick which Steve caught mid-air causing Tony to not only lose balance but unceremoniously to the ground. In quick movements, Steve caught the collar of Tony’s shirt and held him in place to keep him from hitting the ground too hard. If anyone had come they would find it quite odd to see a man and a harpy standing in such a way that looked almost comical.
“I am sorry Mr. Stark,” Anita began placing a tentative hand on his shoulder, “she had waited until you passed to make her decision to take out her name from our listing. I am afraid that Virginia Potts has passed on permanently.”
“Who do you think sold ‘im?” The man growled pushing forward. Tony moved along with him. He could feel papa Rhodes’ eyes pouring into the back of his head telling him to be gone but Tony was stubborn. He will fight for him with everything he’s got.
It was a stupid decision that lead him here. Really. It was. He knew, with almost absolute certainty, that the suit prototype he was wearing was not ready for prolonged use. But he still wore it. Still took it out for a spin. Now Tony Stark is stuck, wounded on an abandoned man-made island off the coast of somewhere, not sure how to proceed.
“Anton,” was all he said before he fell into the abyss of sleep.
The team and new members gathered in the center tent area where they had set up temporary seating arrangements. Steve stayed standing waiting for the rest to take a seat. Only after did he squeeze himself between Bucky and Sam across from Tony and his family. They were all quiet as if waiting for someone to talk. No one wanted to be the first to break the newly found silence. It was Happy who broke it, “I just want to let you know that I am a trained bodyguard and if I have ta I will willingly fight any you for the crown prince!”
Tony moved around the road looking for the slave marketers to see a big man pulling a carriage down the road when a family voice called out for him, “Tony! You should not be here!” Tony looked into the cage cramped with people to see papa Rhodes press himself against the
He looked around wishing Sam had finished his upgrades with redwing so they could have sent it out but instead he had to rely solely on his eyes. Thankfully though, Steve was able to spot some kind of odd anomaly in the sky that Steve figured was the kidnappers and Tony. He followed them for as long as he could trying to figure out where they would land. And it turns out not very far. Just a few miles from where they were.
Its been like two years since I touched this fic but I do plan on working on it! Here is part 1 of Tony's side before the reunion of our boys! Hope you enjoy it! xD
Tony just blinked shocked and Steve just watched Tony's face turn beet red. It felt so good to see Tony smiling and studying all his tools and that he had been the one to bring that smile to Tony's face.
“You like that don’t you? Being brought to the edge and then slowly tipped over to completion,” Steve said as he began to earnestly stroke Tony off. He kept his eyes locked with Tony. Tony blushed in response, feeling like he was about to boil over but he couldn’t look away. Steve kept Tony right where he wanted him.
They both knew this was not the end of their story. But it was the strangest beginning really.
Steve came back from his last missions dog tired but he didn't mind it. He will get a good bath in the small river running next to their camp later. Bucky immediately handed him a plate of food that they had made for dinner. His best friend raised an eyebrow at Steve but the blond didn't answer him. The only way to keep a secret surprise in this team was to keep it to himself. They all somehow found a way to ruin them without much effort.
In hindsight, this was probably a pretty bad idea but Tony was already here and he never did anything halfway. So here he sat on the windowsill of the third-floor window of a secret government building that was on a map he found in his fa-How-fuck
Bucky soon came up and began to tease him a bit until Steve turned to look at him. The joke died on Bucky’s lips when he saw Steve’s expression and asked him what was wrong. Steve almost couldn't say it. If he didn’t then maybe Tony was fine and that this was all some big dream but it wasn’t.
“I am trying to buy a gift for a friend who loves to build and fix things,” Steve started as they sat down on small stools, “I was thinking a traveling toolset he could use whenever he wants and a small materials bag that I see some of ya carrying around?”
“Steve,” Tony whispered, “I can’t ask you to do that.”
Steve felt his cheeks burn a bit like he has been caught outside of his room past curfew. There wasn’t anything really to be embarrassed about but still couldn’t really help it. “Well, it was either this or come naked because I don’t have much else to show off.”
“Figured you would be the one I had to meet for this blind date,” Tony grumbled pulling Steve out of his thoughts and back into reality. What did he-oh damn. Tony was his blind date. He was sure because no one else would dare wear such bright red pants and not only get away with it but make them look dashingly good.
Tony gave him a small smile in return and Steve felt his whole world focus shift in that moment. He stared happily at Tony who looked away towards the fire in an attempt to hide his blush. Steve had never been more happier than in that moment.
When the fire began to dim and new wood had just been added, Steve felt a small press against his shoulder as someone came to sit down to his right. Steve turned expecting to see Bucky but instead there sat Tony with his wings wrapped in bandages that held the medicinal remedy to Tony’s infected wings. Steve just gaped for a minute and Tony began to fidget a bit. It wasn’t until Sam nudged him again that Steve smiled largely at Tony and welcoming him to the team circle.
Steve knitted his eyebrows in concern, “what do you mean? Is there something you can do about it?”
“Thank you,” Tony said holding back the sob that threatened to pour out. Papa Rhodes squeezed Tony’s arm one more time before letting go and nodded for Tony to continue to show the way.
Tony had not been in Steve’s tent since they had bought him his own tent a few days ago. It was set up across the camp from his so he knew Tony would not mistake Steve’s for his own. Maybe Tony wanted to finally talk with him and they could actually become friends! It was unclear to Steve until now why he was so adamant about becoming Tony’s friend but Steve was stubborn and once he made a choice he often did not back down from it.
“Oh god,” Pepper stopped, “did you do something? I can't always clean you messes Tony.”
It was not until Rhodey came to them that they had come to realize how much time had passed. Steve was really enjoying himself and seeing Tony have a little fun was a great time passer. The other harpy though looked like he was ready to get down to business and thus their training session was cut short as they followed Rhodey back to camp.
“Because if there is a small chance of saving Rhodey’s dad you would do it,” Tony replied slipping on the second shoe. He came out from behind the wall and Pepper just gaped before smiling at him.
Still it did not mean he did not fancy her. She was a strong independent woman. And he liked that. She was the first girl who seemed to remotely ignite any feelings in him other than Bucky.
“I...would actually love that,” Tony confessed giving Steve his first genuine shy smile that he had often seen adorn Tony’s face when they had been together.
“Steve,” Bruce came out of his tent looking relieved to see him but Steve could still see the underlying worry in those eyes. Steve stopped in his tracks and turned towards Bruce to ask him to wait a few minutes while he talked to Tony but Bruce stood firm and looked at him with great determination. Still, Tony was waiting and Steve felt like he had left the harpy waiting long enough.
She looked at him and gave a small smile before turning around and letting the Colonel take over the introduction. Steve listened to every word. Drank it all in. He was proud to have made it here. Not even the questioning look the Colonel gave him could make him waver. He was going to be a soldier. Fight in the war. Make a difference.
“Nothing in particular,” Steve shrugged before asking Tony the same question. The harpy looked like he contemplated the answer and started telling Steve about some ideas he had for an upgrade to some of their teammates’ armors and weapons. It seemed important to Tony that each of them had good working equipment at all times. None of them had to fear of a malfunction because Tony made sure it worked as intended. The harpy surely was a genius in his own right.
(See the end of the chapter for
He spotted one of his bunk mates standing at one of the corners and asked him for a round. The first time Steve asked the man scoffed but now it was routine. Steve knew that he got at least one of his recruit mates’ respect. Having one was a base. He just end needed to continue and get the others on board too. They’ll see. He’ll be just as good as them. Somehow.

Still Tony wanted to show Steve in these stolen moments of his life as a young harpy. Steve followed dutifully using the opportunity to talk to others and spread doubt about the false story spread about Tony. It was hard since often times Steve would get worked up when someone blatantly insulted Tony to his face but never got physical only because Tony was there to stop him. Steve would have met any and all of them in the back alley for a few rounds with their fists. Some listened though and Steve could see the gears turning in their minds and that was all he needed. Plant the seeds and have that idea spread.
When Steve picked up the vibranium shield for the first time it felt like coming home. Steve could not understand why but it gave him reminiscent feelings. Nostalgia. Holding the shield up made him feel comfortable in his own skin. He smiled allowing his fingers to trace over the metal.
Steve felt his smile begin to fade. Not that he did not like Howard, Steve liked him well enough but sometimes Steve felt like all the man saw was Captain America and not Steve Rogers. Still, Steve enjoyed the other man’s company. He, too, made him feel nostalgic. But the darkness within his mind wanted him dead but Steve had gotten used to ignoring it.
At that moment they both prayed to the gods, the prince for the first time, and asked them of one simple favor. That they would find themselves again. That they would be together forever. Some say that at that moment a light shined off in the distance answering their prayers.
“I wish you had told me,” Steve leaned back lowering his shoulders in defeat. It hurt but at least now he knew that he was right. Tony hadn’t left him because he didn’t love him anymore. So glad he persisted to hold onto that hope that the other man cared about him as much as he did even when Tony had told him that he didn’t love him anymore.
Bucky took Steve’s keys out of his shaking hands and opened the door for the smaller man. Steve’s mother sat on the couch when she caught sight of her son. Worry filled her eyes but Bucky just shook his head. She lay back down with a sigh. It was getting harder and harder for her to get up. Steve did not see the interaction between his mother and Bucky so made no comment on the matter like he usually would. Steve hated making his mother worry.
“Hey Tony,” Steve started off softly trying to sound calm and reassuring, “I’m sorry about before. I didn’t mean to scare you or embarrass you. I want you to know that the team have come to care about you after these last few weeks and they are all worried about you. If you would please come out and sit with us around the campfire as Clint tells us one of his awful stories or when Bruce is ready to let him in so you can get your wings checked. No pressure at all though. Just tap on something to let me know you are alright.”
Crawling under one of the said tables, Hammer pulled something out of his pocket. Tony looked at it intrigued and began to reach for it when a large farting sound erupted from the device. With a gleeful smile Hammer threw the concoction at Tony and waited. Tony just instinctively caught it. The table flap opened, a pool of light shone threw and Howard Stark’s angry face met them. He looked between Tony, the object and Hammer and decided at that moment that it was all Tony’s fault. Tony could see it in his eyes. It was also a look that said he would not change his mind either. Great, punishment later tonight was a definite thing.
Twelve hours. It took them twelve hours to fully get Happy stable and healing normally. The wounded harpy was now sitting in Bruce’s tent eating some soup that Sam had whipped up for him to eat. It seemed that Happy had a lot to say but Tony would hear none of it until Happy ate something first. So they all stood outside Bruce’s tent waiting patiently as Happy slurped up the soup.
“We cannot let that happen Bruce,” Steve growled.
“H-hey! What are you doing?” Tony squirmed, not knowing if he was more mortified by where Steve’s hands were freely exploring or how much he
After a tiring trip through the city they made it to a small apartment complex that looked old but sturdy. It had not changed much since Steve had last seen it which was not surprising in the least. Tony stepped up next to him looking at the building too with wide curious eyes. “This is where I call home when I am back in Brook,” Steve spoke up pulling Tony’s attention away from the building and to him, “I live on the fourth floor towards the opposite street. It’s not the biggest or most grand but it is does its job.”
It was then that it really dawned on Steve that he had no where for Tony to sleep. He felt bad for forcing Tony to share the same space as him but he did not have another choice until they went into town tomorrow to get some supplies for him. “So you will sleep with me tonight,” Steve said looking at Tony in the eyes. Suddenly the air changed and the tension between them grew. Tony suddenly felt a lot darker and more angry than Steve had ever seen him. He was not sure what brought this on but he hoped Tony would understand why they had to share the same space.
“Where is he?” Nat asked instantly as she watched Steve pull on his battle gear and following suit. Steve did not want to reply because the more time he spent explaining it to the team the more time spent not getting to hi-to Tony.
“Thank you for staying by my side Tony,” Steve said giving Tony a wide toothy smile.
“Fighting in a battle,” Steve answered honestly but he did not elaborate further not wanting to look silly in front of her.
Pepper studied them both ands replied, “fine. I will take one of his robes to the cleaners but I will give it to you before. You know you guys owe me big time. It's going to be a hassle to convince the cleaners to finish the job in a much shorter time.”
Now that they were back they were free to celebrate. Papa Rhodes walked with almost a skip in his step if it were not for his stiff leg that forced him to limp along. Tony watched as Rhodey walked besides his dad talking with him while supporting a part of papa Rhodes’ weight to allow him to move faster than he could on his own. They were both excited to see mama Rhodes. Having him sold off to the crown was a sickening act done by his stepmother in an attempt to blame papa Rhodes for the recent disappearances of treasured items around the home. It was cruel to separate a mated pair from one another like his stepmother tried to do if Tony had been unsuccessful in saving him from that fate.
He married Steve. Steve married him. They got married and had a child. Tony couldn’t comprehend the facts sitting right in front of him. All the evidence that they share a life together. A part of him didn’t want to believe it and another really hoped this was true. His vision began to blur and the world began to spin. Tony’s world began to fall into darkness and the last thing he heard was Steve calling out his name…
It took them an extra five days to get their plan ready and moving. Steve and Tony decided that it would be better not to wait until things settle down as to not give Stane a chance to gather himself and his story. On the sixth day, the Avengers made their move towards the castle. The plan was to meet Pepper at the servant quarters and she will lead them to the throne room where Stane usually hosts his parties and planning sessions. They made it to the small door on the far side of the castle. It was small enough that if Steve was not looking for it he would have missed it.
Tony just fell silent and continued to watch Rogers sleep. The man looked peaceful almost statue like and it scared Tony. A person should either be dead or alive...not stuck in this vegetative state, it was a cruel way to force someone to stay alive who wanted to die.
“Who darling?” She looked at her son with deeply worried eyes.
Steve began to move but was stopped by a familiar voice saying, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you man. Tony has been having a hard time sleeping as it is with you being out of commision for three days.”
“Next time you ride with me though,” Rhodey commented pulling Tony out of Steve’s arms and into his. Steve yearned for the loss of heat that radiated. From Tony’s body. Steve wondered if Rhodey was trying to say something.
The camp got closer and Steve could feel that he was gaining more and more momentum thrusting himself forward at a faster pace in an attempt to get back early enough for some shut eye. No one talked. Not Bucky. Not the saved men who he decided were the true heroes of war. It was dead quiet. The silence was necessary though. A lot of the men were still mourning the loss of their friends who had just gone down in battle. It bothered Steve but he knew he could not save everyone but he wish he could.
Papa Rhodes grabbed Tony’s arm halting him from his movement . Tony turned to look at him as he spoke, “listen son, I want you to know that you will always be family. Nothing can take our love for you. Nothing,”
Steve nodded raising his hand to signal the rest of the team to come out. And slowly the team came into view nervously still holding their weapons tightly in their grasp. Steve told them to put away their weapons that the harpies were not of any danger...yet.
Tony tilted his head as Steve slipped the bag off his shoulder and handed it to Tony. They stood there for a bit with Tony staring at the bag before looking quickly at Steve. “It's uh, a mechanic travel bag with a travel kit inside and starter material for you to use.”
“Well these babies will rock your world Cap,” Tony whispered back before Steve left his space and headed towards his awaiting commands. Thor patted him on the shoulder with a large smile on his face while Bucky gave Steve a playful look.
“We must be getting desperate if they are allowing pancakes like you in the army. We gotta fatten you up boy. It looks like you haven’t eaten a day in your life,” the General stomped away allowing Steve to let out a shaky breath.
“So how was it?” Sam asked smiled with a knowing smile on his lips.
There is description of abuse in this chapter. Sorry I had to put this in there. I have added the tags. Again so sorry! Please read, comment and kudos. I love hearing what people have to say.
Steve was finally on his way to get Tony the medicinal ingredients he needed to save his wings. He hoped he could make it in time.
“Don’t be a sourpouch platypus,” Tony whined as Rhodey pulled a face towards Steve. He raised an eyebrow challengingly at the other man who just shrugged in response. Steve was glad he did not have to get into a fight with Tony’s best friend. That would not leave a good impression or situation at all.
Instead, he dead focused on moving as promptly as they could to get to Tony’s location and save their newly adopted family member from the dangers of his own kind. Steve was not against using violence to get Tony to safety. He will do anything necessary though none of his teammates were obliged to do the same but he hoped they would back him up at least.
Maybe this time the cold would finish what Steve Rogers started that day in Siberia. Just…May…be…
Steve felt himself react to what he was sure to be Tony’s claws thrashing about. He moved without thinking and ran towards the assaulting harpies screaming and he heard a familiar roar next to him knowing that Thor had followed him into battle. They were got the harpies attention as they shifted just a bit to turn to look at Steve and Thor in both shock and defensiveness. They seemed to create a barrier between Tony and Steve without really letting Tony go from his spot and Steve did not like it at all. These bullying harpies were not going..to...hurt...wait.
“Hey Bruce,” Steve decided to greet giving him a worried and nervous smile, “can this wait for a bit?”
“I know, what would I do without you, but no,” Tony paused his face turning serious, “I know your mistress has an omega son about my age. I need you to borrow one of his dress robes for me!”
Steve was buzzing in place but didn't dwell long enough since a moment later the elevator doors opened waiting for him to get out. He rushed out not giving people enough time to interact with him. He didn't care about them he cares about Tony.
desk. It was not hard for him to find his way here since it was an abandoned hospital building that was fifteen minutes from his house. It was pretty convenient choice really. His fa-*he* always mixed work and pleasure together not really seeing the need to separate the two. Still, Tony did not know his father was working with a secret government sect that no one really knew existed except for those who work for it...and well now Tony too.
“Mr. Stark please come back to bed,” Anita, Tony’s mind supplied helpfully, insisted as she crouched next to him.
“I think I saw him heading towards the lake,” Clint said stepping out of his newly made tent, “think he might be getting water or something.”
Steve really truly needed to get to Tony right now. He could probably make that distance pretty swiftly if he took only himself and his shield. It was important that he got to Tony quickly before he got hurt or worse killed.
“He's not property at all you ill-mannered tub of guts. Do you honestly think it's right to chain people like chattel? I demand you release him at once,” Tony pushed getting in the man’s face.
“Alright man,” Sam smiled and winked at him making Steve groan. This was not going to be easy. Still neither of them brought up the subject after and for that Steve was grateful.
He really hoped that if he survived whatever this was, he will remember this dream. Because even though it would be a cruel reminder of what he will never have, it would also be something that was
The last thing Steve heard before he went unconscious was Tony screaming out his name.
The longer Tony stared the more he just felt the need to do something, anything to try and wake the man up. If Tony could bring Rogers back then he could somehow help his f-him rest just a little better. How-Howard didn't much deserve it but just in case him and his mom ended up in the same place he shouldn't let her suffer Howard's sad bitterness.
Tony felt panic build in his chest trying to figure out how to get papa Rhodes back. The man began to move again when Tony cried, “I can pay for him good sir! I have twenty gold francs!”
“Hey! I’m not judgin’ if you had not come I think I would have probably be left for dead,” Bucky laughed patting Steve on the shoulder.
“Good morning Mr. Stark,” a female voice spoke. Tony looked to the side and gasped. The person next to him was clearly not human and a part of him panicked that he has been taken hostage by aliens but he held it back. There was no use in panicking in this situation. If he were in danger he could figure out how to get out of here and back home. He always found a way back.
His phone rang. Steve paused for a moment to assess the distinctive ring. He did not hesitate to answer in an instant worried, “hello? Is there something wrong? I could have sworn our appointment was in a month.”
...Tony woke up with a start. Tentatively, He looked around to discover that he was back at the Avengers compound in the medbay. He lay back down and stared at the ceiling silently. FRIDAY probably sent out a signal of his location before he crash-landed allowing Rhodey or Vision to find him while he was unconscious. Which made sense since he programmed her that way in case anything were to happen.
Steve set out on foot looking for the nearest stable. He figured there would be one in the town a few miles away. It was easy distance for him so he headed out towards the town. Like he predicted it took him just over an hour to get there. It was smaller than its neighboring towns but he knew they would have a lot of horses to make up for its isolation.
“Too late sunshine,” the big gruff man growled, “this lot is bound to the Americas.”
Maria Hill
“Did you get my very important stuff?” Clint came up to him and draped an arm around his shoulder. Steve just rolled his eyes and moved out of Clint’s hold. He hoped he could avoid Clint’s whines for just a little longer but he figured it was not meant to be.
. He thought Steve wanted to have sex with him. All this time Tony has been treating him like his master. No wonder Tony had been distant with him but why did he treat his teammates like his equ-
“Um, uh, yeah hello,” Tony greeted fidgeting a bit in his spot.
“We should move up our timeline,” Steve spoke up, “we should hit him while he is still not fully equipped with an army behind him of enhanced harpies who are brainwashed to do his bidding.”
They did not talk along the way as Steve lead them both back to the Avengers camp. He was feeling dread as they neared since Steve used most of their money to save Tony from the dreadful place. Steve never understood the value of caging and harming other races for mankind’s greed. They all deserved a place on this planet as much as humans did and it was not right for humans to treat them as second rate citizens in their own territories and homelands.
Ever since then Steve began to hear more and more people talk about Tony and his story and often times hearing them demand to know the actual truth of what happened. All that they were doing was going to help Tony save his people if the people are willing to let themselves be saved by him.
“He will come around eventually,” Sam smiled encouragingly as he sat to Steve’s left. Steve smiled at his good friend trying hard to resist the urge to stare at Tony’s tent. He meant what he had said about not pressuring Tony to join them. Though he really hoped Tony would take Steve on that offer.
He forced himself to take a breath. Freaking out on Steve was probably the worst thing he could do right now. If he wanted to find a way back...back to the suck that was his life...he needed to stay composed. A part of him wanted to stay. To give up and give in and stay, but this was not his reality,
“What why?” Steve was shocked by Bucky’s words. Why would Tony be in Steve’s tent and not his own? Steve turned to look at his tent thinking about Tony sitting on his custom made mat.
In moments like this a small part of Tony prayed. Not to God but to someone whom many considered America’s hero. During these few moments of calm before the harsh cold storm, Tony Stark prayed for Captain America to come save him. But like every other time, his prayers were met with silence. Where was the great hero now? Somewhere out there ignoring his calls for Tony knew, he did not know how, but he knew that the Captain was alive. That he would return someday but just not this day.
“What did you bu-oh,” Clint stopped dead in his tracks when he spotted Tony who was putting things away with the help of Bucky. The man instantly turned to glare at Steve knowing full well what Steve had done but there was no heat behind that glare, Steve could tell, since he too had been a similar situation a few years back. It took them quite a while to get Clint to feel like they actually cared for him and hopefully they can do the same for Tony. Steve just gave a small smile at Clint knowing full well that Clint was willing to go without some of his supplies for a bit longer if it meant saving someone from that hellhole.
They are getting closer and closer to meeting. I'm super stocked.
“It's great to see you Tony,” Steve said instead giving Tony a soft smile, “Pepper wanted you...she wanted you to see the future. She told me before she died that she wanted you to see what you helped create.”
“You okay?” Steve asked and Tony looked at him with a  small smile on his face, “I got you something, or well, some things.”
With a pop Steve finally let up, allowing Tony a single moment of reprieve before giving his still hard cock more attention. This time though, Steve decided to use his hands and tongue to bring Tony to fruition. He licked Tony’s cock, following each vein and lapped up any pre-come that dripped from the head. It was a show and Tony was addicted and enticed. He watched as Steve wrapped his hand around the base and gave Tony’s dick a hard tug, earning him a quiet gasp.
Finally, after what felt like forever, Tony felt Steve’s tongue against the slit of his cock taking one slow lap across it. Tony dared to look down and locked eyes with Steve as he smiled mischievously as if he knew exactly how to drive Tony mad and was going to do just that. Keeping their eyes locked Steve bent forward once again and took the head of Tony’s cock in his mouth; Tony saw stars. Steve took Tony’s reaction as permission to continue and he began to happily suck and take more of Tony into his mouth until he hit took all of him in.
“Hello,” Tony replied, trying to sound indifferent when he was, in fact, ecstatic. He got up and put the plate down on the nearest table and walked over to the other boy in the room. The kid introduced himself as Justin Hammer sticking his hand out for a shake. Tony looked at the hand skeptically but shook it anyway. All of a sudden Tony was bored again and lost again. This kid was trying too hard to act like the adults in the room, so
Steve just gave Tony one last smile before leaving the harpy to play with his new toys. He exited the apartment and headed to get them food. Things were starting to fall into place and Tony was finally opening up to him.
“You are the best Pepper!” Tony smiled and Rhodey just wrapped his arms around her and pushed her into a hug. Both knew that Rhodey was too lost for words.
It was Steve’s turn to go into the market and buy food and other miscellaneous supplies for the team. He was in no hurry since it was not often that he got some alone time away from his team. Steve loved them but traveling with the same people for awhile gets tiring and a bit socially exhausting. So Steve was totally fine with going into town by himself.
It was a lot smoother now even as more armed harpies charged at them. Steve felt a few blows and he could feel a bit of the pain as he moved but it did not slow him down from protecting each fighting member of the Avengers as well as taking down his own attackers.
“Yeah what Thor said! The annoying talker grew on me like a weed and now I miss his little nonstop babbles he goes into in the middle of the night,” Sam pipes in and soon the rest were also giving their two cents on Tony. It seemed that Steve was not the only one who came to care deeply about the energetic and rambly harpy that joined them not too long ago. It was a wonderful sight for Steve but now was not the moment to dwell.
Steve turned to look at Tony trying to give him a reassuring look as he stepped towards him but the harpy just stood stock still. Tony grew more nervous as Steve approached him with the keys to shackles in plain visible sight. Tony watched his hands like a hawk ready to fight at any given chance.  Steve wrapped his fingers over Tony’s wrist pulling him towards him feeling Tony stiffen more than he was before as if waiting for something bad to happen. It was hard for Steve but he made sure not to make any sudden movements as he inserted the key into the lock and turned it as slowly as he could letting Tony follow his hands with his eyes.
“Liberty?” The stable boy called noticing the door open. Steve climbed onto the horse and urged it to move hoping he doesn’t harm the stable boy on his way out. The horse, Liberty, moved forward out of the stall and Steve was on his way throwing back a quick apology to the surprised and dazed stable boy he left behind.
Tony stopped moving and slumped in Steve’s grasp. Steve felt relief wash over him as Tony allowed Steve to maneuver him into his arms fully and just hold him there. They just stood there holding each other for a while as Tony calmed himself down.
The Colonel gave him a questioning look and even more so when Steve asked for one name. When the older man confirmed Steve’s concerns he instantly began to wonder how they were going to save him and the rest of the men but from the looks the Colonel was giving him he knew that was not going to happen.
“Love you too,” Bucky said walking away with a short wave leaving Steve alone with Tony for the first time since they got back to camp.
Tony was still apprehensive and quite shy and although he had been given the option to leave and travel on his own, he stayed. Though Clint always jokes that it’s because Tony spots Steve’s sad puppy eyes and is feels too guilty to leave Steve behind but Steve thinks otherwise. Tony seemed to not fully be comfortable or relaxed around the team but he looks less calculating and scared. It was a good step towards getting Tony to feel like he was a part of the team. Steve just felt himself preening everytime Tony turned to him or walked up to him or came near him. He was so happy.
Familiar voices broke through the trees and forest noises as they neared camp. Steve was glad because now Tony could meet his makeshift family and maybe one day Tony would permanently join them. He would never force Tony to stay but he already felt attached to the harpy somehow.
“There is another reason we went looking for you,” Pepper started as she came into view from behind a set of trees to their right. They all turned to look at her as she eloquently sat across from them. Steve felt a presence of easy elegance about her that made a person want to listen. “Stane is dismantling our way of life and structure so he could rule indefinitely without consequence or resistance. His new regime is cruel and he is using your tarnished image to get it done. I have put myself in a good position with him and he trusts me to a point but even that is fickle. I was able to learn that he plans on furthering war and tension between our people and others so he can profit off of weaponry and combative equipment. There are a few tribes that do not believe the story of the runaway prince and will not bow down to anyone but the rightful king of our people. Which is why it is important that you come back…you know how much I dislike putting yourself in harm's way and it is hypocritical that I ask this of you but please. For the sake of our kind, will you help us?”
“All you got to do is ask sugar,” Tony winked at Bucky and Clint who chuckled in response. Steve watched Tony throw a few more comments and his teammates’ easy response.
------------
With that they parted ways and Tony was just one step closer to getting Papa Rhodes back. A small bit of anxiety seeped into his bones. The only formal training Tony had as a proper was through what little his father taught him. He hoped that it was enough. Or this was not going to work.
“Yeah, I noticed him trying to fix some things around camp and Sam’s redwing a few times and it looked like he wanted to take things apart and put them back together so I thought I could get him something that was just his,” Steve replied sheepishly as Tony beamed up at him while Rhodey looked pleased with what he said.
Tony stood up to retaliate having enough of this asshole talking to him in such a manner. Tony maybe an omega but that does not mean he is weak. He opened his mouth to say something when another voice cut in saying, “you dare raise your voice to a lord, sir?”
“Don’t bullshit me, Tony,” Steve growled balling his hands into fists under the table, “I don’t believe you would leave us, leave me for money. I know you didn’t care about the money. We could have made our own way. I would have loved you whether you had a million dollars or just a penny to your name. Hell, you could take mine for all I cared.”
It did not take him long to realize that Tony was following him from a bit of a distance. It seemed that he wanted to follow Steve or he just had nowhere else to go Steve did not mind either way. Steve just wished Tony would walk with him not behind him. The harpy was free now he can do what he needed to heal and do what he wanted. Still Tony followed.
The tongue played around in his mouth feeling, tasting, nudging. This was not something a comatose patient should be able to do. Still, Tony found himself responding playing around with the other tongue with his own until he could have no more.
“Next time once you demonstrate how those gloves work you can come along,” Steve whispered into Tony’s ear. Tony just nodded without turning to him but Steve could see the little smirk playing on his face.
After Jarvis finished cleaning him up Tony lay face forward onto his bed. Slowly Jarvis covered his bottom half with a blanket and handed Tony his own self-made Captain America plushy. He loved cuddling and the Captain was the perfect cuddling partner. He made him to his exact liking, of course.
Steve shook his head at them and just sat next to Bucky on the large stone pulling comfort from the familiar heat next to him. It made him feel like everything was going to be alright.
“Prince? Thor doesn’t need no bodyguard,” Clint glared back at Happy who gave Clint a challenging look. The rest looked around confused not knowing what Happy meant by the prince. No one-
“I can’t ask you to risk your lives!” Tony tried to reason with them but looking into each of the Avenger’s eyes and settling on Steve’s all he got was stubborn determination to help.
They had agreed on a mutual meeting point near Central Park and what color shirts they were to wear. So here he was standing in his blue shirt waiting for his mystery date to appear. They were late but Steve didn’t mind as it was a little warmer today. But Steve kept a sharp eye looking around constantly to check if anyone looked like they were looking for him too.
“Pep! Pepper of my life!” Tony smiled stepping around to stand on her left while Rhodey cornered her from the right.
Steve just gave a small smile as Tony turned to look at the man he had not really spoken to for years one last time before he left Tony alone. The doctors surrounded him and guided him to sit back on his bed. Tony was really thankful to have Steve close by. He may still feel the brewing feelings under his skin but he really was glad that Steve had come. It calmed him knowing he knew someone and that he was just one call away.
They made it to the outskirts of Brook by nightfall. The city had grown since the last time the Avengers have been back. They often dreaded heading into town the direct route for the flocks of people who come out to great them but it was not always avoidable. This time was no different as people were lining up around them with large smiles on their faces greeting them back home. Steve had grown up in Brook and has tried his hardest to help the people of this city the best he could. It was how he was able to get to where he was due to his friends who are now his teammates and the people of this city who always helped each other. Each of his teammates were his family and deserved to be treated like heroes even if Steve felt he was a little unworthy. He had failed at protecting Peggy and that still hurt him to think about her.
Steve was on his daily run. It was one of the few things he kept up over the hundreds of years he has been alive. It was odd to think about how old he was and how much he has changed over time. He was not the same man he was a hundred years ago let alone five but he still tried to be the best man he could be. But the stubbornness and bullheadedness was still there according to Bucky and Thor seems to think that is a part of his better qualities.
Steve looked up to see one of the most beautiful women in the world. He felt his heart stutter and his body give a shiver. It seemed like two parts of him were warring with being fond of her or disliking her. Still, he liked that she was willing to stand strong. He even found it amusing as she punched the cocky asshole in the face. Guts. He liked that.
Tony wanted to ask. He really did. But he wanted to get out of this place even more. “Where’s the door?” he demanded, keeping his eyes lowered, just watching Steve’s feet in front of him.
“Whenever you’re ready, man.” Sam moved to the copilot’s seat, ribbing Clint good-naturedly.
The air exploded as Thor, Wanda and Vision slid down the dazzling column of the Bifröst, landing on the large balcony Thor was swinging Mjolnir almost the moment he landed.
Tony peered at it, leaning over Sam’s shoulder. “Why does that look so familiar?” he wondered.
Wanda nodded. “I understand.” Her eastern European accent had a strange cadence. It was like she spoke to silent music. “Vision has said I must explain myself to you.”
Steve closed his eyes and rested his forehead against the back of Tony’s head. “Does he know just
But, dollars to donuts, they were having some sort of silent eyebrow conversation that would just piss Tony off.
“We have a plan?” Steve asked.
The Bifröst punched through the ground, wrapping them in its unearthly light.
“What does this have to do with Accords, Mr. Stark?” The Egyptian council member waved a hand towards Bruce. “While I’m sure that Mr. Banner is happy to have his monster in chains, it is of no pertinence to the safety that the Accords offer to the world.”
Crowley rubbed at his eyes. “Well, I would suggest they close their eyes then,” he said. “Perhaps you can take the lead in this one and have them hold on to you?”
“There has been something pulling at me of late,” Vision said, silent up until now. “The stars keep calling.”
“And Fury,” Steve said.
Bucky’s eye-roll was magnificent. “You’re a fucking menace.”
“You need a shower,” Natasha informed him.
Steve watched Clint’s face. He could hear that Laura was yelling at him, but tried not to focus on the exact words. It was very difficult with the combination of her voice and his exceptional hearing.
Tony could actually feel his nostrils flare. “You are so full of shit,” he hissed.
“I’m fine!” Tony insisted. “Stop fussing at me!” He felt Pepper’s judgmental gaze down to his bones. “I swear.” He had to figure out how to break up with her before she figured out that he wasn’t the same Tony she’d gone to bed with the night before.
might be amenable to the task,” the South African said. “In all of this you have conducted yourself with the needs of the many ahead of the needs of the few.”
“Yup.” Bucky didn't deny it. “You pretty much behaved like an asshole.”
No J.A.R.V.I.S.
“Not by design,” Thor explained. “However, much power is needed for him to escape which is why he is building up his army.”
“Conniption?” Tony scoffed, following Coulson to his feet. “You are such a throwback, Agent.”
Vision stepped around Thor, a cylinder in his hands. “I believe this is what you are looking for.” He handed it to Tony as the room detonated into shouting.
Sam nodded sagely. “Bestie catch-up time.” He waved a hand when all eyes turned to him. “Or something.”
Clint raised a hand. “I followed Cap. Not an excuse, but my whole life has been one of being accountable to someone. Captain America was the guy I followed when Phil died. He called, I answered.” He rubbed his hands together. “I hated the idea of us being answerable to the same people that wanted to nuke New York.”
Peter arrives. Strange leaves. Tony sleeps. Steve surprises him. And they finally finish what they started earlier. Properly.
naked bro.”
Tony propped one fist on his hip, annoyed now. “I’m the genius who came up with the formula,” he gritted. “I think I know what I need to run it.”
“Ah.” T’Challa’s serious face transformed with his smile. “The final vote was not made public.”
“You just licked my head,” Tony reminded Bucky with a friendly poke in the bicep. He got distracted when he saw that some of the synthesized skin was slightly torn. “What did you do?” He wanted to get Bucky into his lab immediately.
Tony rubbed at his eyes. “Disaster doesn’t cover it, Bruce. It’s catastrophic for the intelligence community.” He stopped. “Barton.”
That wasn’t even a negotiable any longer. Tony’s absence was like a bleeding wound. Rhodes was a great guy, but he wasn’t Tony.
“I’m thinking that the mark these people carry aren’t just proof that they’re acolytes,” Sam said, clearly wanting to keep things civil.
~o0o~
“There are some compromises that Tony Stark made, but I do think that you will be much more prepared to sign the new version of the Sokovia Accords.” T’Challa’s gaze was kind. “You will be able to go home soon, Steve.”
Clint pursed his lips. “We really need to figure out how to replicate that juice running through the two of you.” The low growl from Bucky had everyone taking a step back. “Or not.”
“He makes it hard sometimes,” Sam agreed. “He’s so fucking cocky.”
“Sit.” Laura didn’t lift her head from her laptop. “Bruce is on his way.”
“Clinton.” Laura’s voice was like ice. “Please treat Agent Coulson with the respect he deserves.”
Steve sighed. Tony wondered just what the hell was going on there. “Loki has taken the President hostage. We’re on our way to negotiate.”
Put like that it just sounded stupid. Because it
Bucky looked intrigued. “That could work,” he nodded.
Tony felt his heart stop. “Viz.” Vision was the last vestige of his child, his J.A.R.V.I.S. The thought of him being so willing to sacrifice himself made Tony sick. “No.” He lurched back to his feet, dizzy with panic.
“He's that important to you?” Bruce asked.
~~~O~~~~
Squidward made a sighing sound. “He exhausts me.”
Tony stood up, giving up even though it went against everything he was. “You know what? I’m not a masochist.” He activated the suit and felt the security of metal armor wrap around him.
Wanda floated in a few moments later, Vision not far behind. “The strange doctor has passed information to me,” she said.
The others would come out and spend time with Steve occasionally. Natasha, Sam and Peter were his regular companions. Wanda and Vision seemed uncomfortable with him around so never stayed long. He never saw Tony.
~o0o~
“So how do you know they’re not real?” He announced triumphantly.
“Oh my god,” Steve felt his heart stop when the screen went black. “Where is he? Is he okay?”
“I’ve acquired several new skills,” Coulson said with a tiny smirk. ‘You’d best be careful, Hawkeye.”
He hurried through his shower, pulling on clean jeans and a white t-shirt before he took the elevator to the living area.
was your favorite.”
“But surely you wish the person who murdered your parents to face the consequences of his decades of atrocities.” T’Challa gave Tony the opening he so desperately needed.
“You will always be the Captain,” T’Challa insisted. “It isn’t a title; it is part of who you are.”
“Guess who had extremely hot super-soldier sex last night, Barton?” He shoved both his thumbs at his chest. “This guy.”
Tony looked out at the General Assembly. “So, a quick explanation of B.A.R.F. for the non-scientific minds out there. It’s basically an obscenely expensive way to hijack the hippocampus in the brain to clear traumatic memories.”
Put that way…. “But we stopped it.”
Tony shook his head. “We don’t have time to explore all of the awesome that particular phrase holds,” he chided Bucky with a soft smile. “Steve here wants to get Rogered.” He waggled his eyebrows at his own terrible pun.
“Uh, I’m just going to….” He took a couple of steps back.
“Uh….” Fuck, Tony thought. Loki and his estranged son in one place. What could possibly go wrong?
“Tell us everything,” she said, equally evil.
~o0o~
Thor shook his head. “My brother can be stubborn, but he is correct. The reason for our peril lies at his feet. He must pay the price.” He looked devastated at his own words.
“Jörmungandr?” Steve had no idea what it meant, just, anything that ate worlds wasn’t ever a good thing.
“He’s done some shit that you hated, right?” Steve put his mug down. “Disappointed you, let you down, made you mad?”
?” She rubbed a hand over her mouth. “You Winchesters think you’re so special.”
“Tell us,” Steve urged, seeming just as eager for a subject change.
“What’s that?” Steve asked. Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Thor came into the room just then.
Whatthefuckever.
“You okay, Bruce?” Tony asked.
Tony wallows in his misery. He really needs new friends. Also Natasha is scary. Not news to anyone.
Tony groaned. “I should never have created you with this much attitude.”
yay! managed to get something done today. No promises tomorrow.
Clint nodded. “I’ll show these other two losers where they can crash until you figure out the sleeping arrangements.” Tony refused to give any attention to the salacious eyebrow-waggle that accompanied that statement. Clint was a dick and should never be raising children. The world was doomed.
Fury’s silence was answer enough.
“How much do you know about him, apart from the fact that he’s pretty?” Pepper asked, mouth going thin and scary.
“Why would I?” Tony asked. “I get all my sex-ed from Jellybean.” He nodded towards Rhodey.
“Eh.” Tony grinned as Bucky dodged the flailing fork that he was waving around. “I’m a technological genius, not a literary one.”
“Yeah!” Sam pointed at Bruce. “A dragon or something like that?”
Oh, Steve thought, staring at Tony’s face. She wanted Tony to know that he was loved.
“Yes!” Tony pointed at her. “Ten points for Gryffindor!”
She carried Nate out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Rhodey dropped an arm over Tony’s shoulder. “Why?” he asked.
To those who
“Endlessly,” Rhodey dead-panned. He put his hands on Tony’s waist. “I’m leading.”
“The stones?” Bruce seemed to hold his breath.
Pepper sighed. “That boy is going to be the death of us all.” She crooked a finger at Tony. “We have something to show you.”
“Nice to meet you,” Tony babbled. “Gotta go!” He dragged Pepper away, realizing that he probably looked insane.
“That’s Bucky,” Steve said. “For me.”
But he knew.
Fury put his head in his hand. “I give up.” He waved the other hand. “Get the hell out of here. Do whatever you want.”
Bucky blinked, startled. “From what Steve and Tony have told me you don’t have control over what happens when the Other Guy takes over. Nobody can blame you.”
“No.” Tony stood firm. “He is not my … paramour.” He wrinkled his nose. “I thought we were doing a better job of educating you in twenty-first century wording, man?”
Sorry for the late update. It has been one hell of a year thus far. Thanks for sticking with me.
Clint and Tony both groaned. “No, please dear lord, don’t bring out the vodka.” Tony had been drinking with Natasha once. He couldn’t remember his own name about half an hour into the session. “I’m still hung-over.”
And then he blinked. “Pep, did you know that Steve and Bucky batted for my team?” he called as he jumped up several times to get the jeans to close. There was skinny and then there were these pants.
‘What the hell was that?” he asked.
“You’re my friend and I didn’t think about you and I’m a fuckup.” Tony thought that about covered it. Her smothered laugh told him he’d got it right.
“We were thinking that perhaps
“What was the joke?” Sam asked. Steve understood the need for everyone to just take a breath after what had happened.
“Other Guy,” Clint said, touching Natasha's arm. “But we'd seen him do it before. Whatever you showed him, it fucked him up.” He looked at Wanda.
Scott stared at him. “You sound entirely too excited about this,” he said. “You planning on screwing me over?”
“I’m going to drown you in your sleep one day,” Steve promised.
“You’ve been working on the armor for the past three days straight, Tony. I actually thought you’d have passed out by now and they’d have been here and gone before you knew it.” Steve had not spent enough time with Tony in that other timeline to understand just how immersed Tony would get in a project. He’d heard Pepper mutter about it, but to experience it first-hand, had been an eye-opener.
“Or we could hand it over to the new S.H.I.E.L.D. honchos and let them deal with it,” Tony suggested.
, but got a poke in his shoulder from Rhodey when he opened his mouth to speak. His team were all spoilsports.
sneaky asshole,” he reminded Bucky. Bucky smiled at him, blue eyes clear and calm.
“Exactly,” Steve said. “Just remember, some of his staff might also be Set’s followers, so keep your guard up.”
“I thought we were,” Steve said. “But Tony didn’t tell me that Bucky was there with him. He knew how much I wanted to find him.”
“Did he manage to evacuate any of your people?” Steve asked, sitting down next to Bucky. The thunk of Bucky’s head against his shoulder a moment later made his mouth curl in a small smile.
Dean made a high noise that practically burst Tony’s eardrums. Only Sam’s hand on Dean’s shoulder prevented him from lunging at Coulson.
disappoint me.” She left in a swathe of expensive perfume and righteous anger.
one hand to get cocky, Stark,” Barnes shot back. Tony couldn’t stop the grin.
“Hey, Cap.” He tried for breezy insouciance. He wasn’t entirely successful.
Loki is an ass. Also he's tricky. Tony can't forget. Thor realizes something big is going down. The Avengers confront Loki. Steve stages an 'intervention'.
The silence in the room was resounding. Tony waited.
Tony’s eyes went wide. Pepper didn’t get mad often, but when she did…. “What?” He moved his arm and pushed up to sit leaning against the leather headboard.
“Please, Sheldon, as if you could ever let me go.” Tony could practically see the asshole’s grin. He had to suppress his own smile. This was why Rhodey was his best friend. He called him on his shit and still made him laugh.
“Or?” Bucky asked, smirking.
“Hey, Cyclops, I can spot a lie at twenty paces. You’re not even trying.” Tony waited.
“I’m not entirely sure,” Loki admitted. “The child was taken from me by its mother. I have no real knowledge of what is it capable of.”
Bucky’s jaw set. “I’m fine,” he insisted.
Tony wanted to scream. “We haven’t saved the world multiple times only to roll over and kill one of our own because we’re out of ideas!”
“Oh, fuck you!” Clint shook his hand off. “As if Laura would expect me to sit back and let you all run into space without me.”
“The other red-headed goddess in my life!” he exclaimed, scuttling over.
He looked to Pepper for help.
Tony swallowed hard. “I didn’t…” It sounded weak, even to him.
Tony could still feel the grip of Peter’s hands fading as he begged Tony to do something, to save him.
“You need to be more specific,” Tony said, swallowing hastily as his throat closed. “Are we talking tonight or in general?”
“Good luck with that,” Clint said, taking the suite opposite Steve’s. “He seems pretty intent on acting like we don’t exist.”
Another set of hydraulic doors and the sudden popping of his ears, told Tony that they were in a pressurized room. There was a large table with about a dozen chairs spread around it.
“You do that!” Tony called after him as he jogged into the trees. “I'll just be waiting here, hopefully not being killed by a jaguar or a bear or something.” He sat down on a large rock, eyeing the forest floor. “I bet there are fire ants,” he muttered. “Those tricky little bastards are everywhere.”
“We try because it's who we are.” Wanda sat with her legs crossed and her eyes closed. She hadn't said a word until now.
that the asshole had a back-up plan. “I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan, but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary,” he lifted his eyepatch revealing that scarred eye, “You need to keep
~o0o~
Tony moved, Bucky at his heels. He turned back only once to see Steve lean down and brush her cheek with a kiss. He did not have a lump in his throat, dammit.
Bucky stood too. “I could do with a little down-time,” he admitted. “Places to go, people to do.” He grinned at Steve’s quelling glare.
Dean sat down next to Sam, reading over his shoulder. “
Tony sighed. “You thieves are going to bankrupt me.” He pulled out a dollar from his pocket. He kept them because he knew how much of a kick the kids got out of him having to pay up every time he swore.
“No denial,” Bucky observed with a grin.
“You don’t think we do?” Rhodes asked, leaning against a counter, the hydraulics of his leg braces almost silent. It still made Steve’s stomach churn in guilt.
“You’re no more to blame than I am.” Bruce folded his arms across his chest. “If you’re guilty then, sure as shit, so am I.”
“That’s three,” Clint said. “And the fourth?”
Pepper silently handed him a jacket and it took almost the last of his energy to shrug it on.
Clint met Tony’s gaze and nodded. “Because that sick son of a bitch called Barton and made him listen to him murdering his family.” Clint closed his eyes as Tony spoke.
Steve choked out a laugh. “You’re so messed up, Buck. How do I know I can trust you not to hurt him?”
“Oh.” Tony's eyes flickered between Bucky and Steve, vaguely panicked. “Oh!”
didn’t like Strange.
“So where do you go when you’re not….here?” Tony waved a hand, deciding a change of subject might be a good thing.
“Your lady has a fine pair of pins,” Steve said.
Steve put his face in his hands. “I hate you so much,” he mumbled.
“How about you let us be the judge of that?” Natasha’s soft question raised the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck. He kept forgetting just how deadly she was. And fearless.
“But he needs all six, right?” Tony asked.
Thor nodded and began swinging Mjolnir. “No!” Tony yelled. “Get onto the balcony and catch the Bifröst without breaking my home!”
“What is it?” Steve asked.
Scott nodded to Clint. “I’ll go with the flow. I mean, I’m still not entirely sure why I was against the Accords since I didn’t really read them.”
“He's a friend. Not an enemy, big guy.” Tony stepped in, putting a hand on Thor's shoulder. “He's been with me for about two weeks now.”
“And you are?” The disdain dripped from Stane’s lips.
“Aaaaaand we’re about to land at the Tower!” Clint sang.
She grinned. “Even when I
“Tony…” Bruce sighed. “I’m sure Steve just likes to wind you up because you get so nuts when he calls you on your crap.” Tony opened his mouth to protest. “You do the exact same thing,” Bruce continued.
“Fuck you with a many-thorned rose, Stark!” Clint yelled back.
Thor and Loki were slumped against each other on one of the sofas. The dark circles under Loki’s eyes told of a sleepless night. Steve ordered his treacherous brain to stop thinking of why he would be so tired. Tony’s wicked mind was obviously a very bad influence.
“I don’t think that word means what you think it means,” Tony told him from the floor.
“You okay now?” Bucky grasped Thor’s shoulder.
“Why?” Jim sounded genuinely curious.
“I remember…” Bucky’s eyes were red as though he was fighting back tears.
“Brother?” Thor’s expression was puzzled. “Surely the Soldier of Winter speaks nonsense?”
Tony pointed a finger at him silently.
.” Crowley headed towards the tunnel Bucky had chosen. “There are
“Don’t front, Prof,” Tony said, wagging a finger at him. “Your psychotic magnetic boyfriend has told me what a pain in the ass you were in your wild youth.”
“No bugs!” She glared at him. “Clean place. No bugs.” Tony wondered if bugs were the worst things to be found in a room in this place. He somehow doubted it.
Tony snorted. “I think I did more than hint, Bucky. What Wanda shared with me was a future where you and I and Steve were involved in a mutually satisfying relationship. Together.” He was still trying to wrap his head around that.
“I used to call him Super Nanny,” Clint said, making sure he was out of Coulson’s reach. He yelped a moment later. “What the hell?”
at merging!” He waggled his eyebrows at Rhodes.
“Fuck me,” he breathed.
“Hm.” Bucky made an approving noise. “He’s pretty.”
managed to break through the conditioning on his own. I don’t care what else to want changed. Well, I mean I do, but Bucky Barnes
Bucky smirked. He was such a shit. Tony adored him. “Sure thing, Cap.”
“Nat, you know that you and Bruce were something.” He held his ground even when she turned an icy gaze on him. “We all saw it.”
He vanished into the tunnel, muttering something under his breath about imbecilic humans.
“Do we go back to the chair control room or is there a way she can talk to us here?” Pepper asked.
“Back to the matter at hand.” Phil Coulson’s dry tone had them all looking at him.
Steve smothered a startled laugh. “What, so you’re a rich asshole now, just throwing your money around, trying to buy yourself a boy?”
Rhodey shook his head. “We really need to set some boundaries when it comes to you three and over-sharing.”
“One of them,” Tony corrected. “And if I’m not mistaken, that’s the other arriving right now.”
He broke the surface, soaring up to the sun. He’d forgotten how amazing it felt to fly. He couldn’t believe he’d just given that all up.
that Tony had done.
“It’s not the same thing.”
“I’m good!” he called back, adjusting the repulsors and sending his unwanted buddy a few steps back. “I don’t think they want us here.”
Steve’s hands moved, one into Tony’s hair, tugging at him until Tony dropped his head back, leaving his neck exposed to Steve’s mouth. The other moved to Tony’s ass, squeezing and then lifting him so that the only thing Tony could do was wrap his legs around Steve’s waist. The moan he heard was not his, dammit.
“Yes, we’re all against you.” Bucky’s droll reply made Tony give a startled giggle.
“Fuck,” Clint breathed. “That is so far beyond fucked up it’s not even in the same universe of fucked up.”
“Because you’d kill Lucifer to gain his powers.” Tony had a lifetime of messed-up family dysfunction behind him.
eyes open.” He guided Pierce to the scanner and it cleared with the scan of Fury’s dead eye.
“My Jane is the most noble of all womankind!” Thor boomed, eager to extol the virtues of his lady-love.
knew.
Natasha walked up to him, mouth set. Everyone held their breath.
“You’re asking me to defend you when you want my friends to be registered like the Nazis registered the Jews?” Xavier’s tone was disgusted. “Short of killing you, I’m not sure I’d stop Tony.”
“Here?” Pepper frowned. “As in the mansion?”
He turned the corner and pulled up short. Bucky had Steve down on the mat, strong legs pinning Steve’s arms to his sides and his prosthetic arm wrapped around Steve’s neck. Steve was red in the face.
Tony watched Steve’s jaw set. He groaned. Steve was in his ‘I’m not backing down’ mode. It never ended well. “We’re here to stop Set from escaping the Cage. That’s all.” He sent a warning glance to Steve.
“Any luck?” Pepper asked, mostly out of politeness. Steve had filled her in on his and Clint's experience with Peggy.
Tony turned back to hear Pierce say, “And SHIELD's. If you do this, none of your past is going to remain hidden.” Natasha ignored him, continuing with whatever she was doing. “Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?” The anger had turned into a kind of oily menace that reminded Tony of Obie. He shuddered.
“Pep,” Tony said, grabbing onto her hand. “Let Natasha in. She went to them because I asked her to. I’m not happy that she stayed, but she couldn’t exactly come back once she was declared a fugitive. She’s the only one of them that I even remotely trust.”
Clint flipped her off too and then yelped when she reached over and pinched his bicep. “You are a truly horrible woman, Romanoff.”
Tony thought he must look like a guppy with the way his mouth opened and closed. “Jim…Bucky…”
Steve shook his head. “I have no idea what I’m going to say to him,” he admitted. He’d stopped thinking about Tony once the ramifications of Bucky’s return had hit him. It was easier to focus on Bucky than on Tony’s betrayal.
Then, as though the stone knew how much its new host could cope with, it stopped. Satisfied with its work for the time being, it sent one final burst to the remaining part of the shattered organ that had not been able to keep Tony alive.
“If I believed that Thanos could be defeated by my handing the Time Stone over, then I would do so immediately.” They had all been so involved in the argument that they’d missed the arrival of Strange and his companions.
“I don’t want to be a babysitter!” Steve refused to use the curse word simply because Tony had. “I want to be your friend.”
“Watch.” This time the order came from Bucky. Tony's eyes flew open again as he watched Bucky kneel at Steve’s feet, easing the worn denim down Steve’s long, long legs.
“What does this mean?” The South African spoke up again. “All it showed us was that he wanted to take care of the woman he loved.”
“And most unlike you, Captain,” Vision said. “Many of your actions since discovering that your old friend was alive have been counter to the person I have come to know.”
Tony opened his mouth and then snapped it closed. Steve ducked his head to hide his smile. Bucky had always been a devious little shit.
Banner.” Tony could feel his jaw clench. He’d been ready for this line of questioning. “And it’s relevant because one of the reasons for the Accords ever existing was because Thaddeus Ross had a rage boner for Bruce and wanted a way to control him!” He took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to shout. The Accords are necessary. I’m not disputing that.” He indicated the men with him. “
“Could be.” Dean handed him a card with a number. “My mobile number’s on the back,” he said. “And if you can get me anything you can about Lady Antonia Bevell and the London chapter of the Men of Letters, we’d be much obliged.”
“You can give up the idea of the SRA right now, forget it ever existed and tell all of your friends that it’s dead in the water.” Tony paused.
we broke up.”
Steve gaped at him. Scott was a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a whole lot of dumbass sometimes.
Tony looked back at Xavier. Ross was frozen in place, absolute fear in his face. “Get out of my brain, you fucking freak!” Ross shouted, hands clawed out and reaching for Xavier.
“I’ll say that you cried like a baby,” Strange called back.
Yggdrasil assured him.
Michael opened his eyes again. “It’s not often that mortals surprise me,” he admitted.
The Avengers get some rest. Steve and Bucky talk. Tony needles Bruce.
Tony held up a hand. “Whoa, Thunderdome, you don’t have to beat yourself up about it. Just be more careful in the future. And if you do it again, I have money. It won’t break my bank.”
“She went to Tony?” Natasha’s gaze was sharp again, whatever had been going on in her head clearly dissipated.
Carol left to go and try to save the remaining part of the universe, taking Nebula with her. She had seemed reluctant to leave, but Tony had encouraged her to go and learn more about superheroing from an actual superhero.
“Eh.” Tony shrugged. “It comes with the spoiled rich kid territory.”
Steve exchanged a glance with Tony who looked as curious as Steve felt about what she was discovering in his mind.
Steve felt suddenly exhausted. “I meant, I’m sorry that I didn’t listen to you,” he told Natasha. “And I’m sorry about Bruce. I don’t care what you say; I know how you felt about him.”
“So they’re not killers?” Steve asked, frowning down at what he was reading.
Alive and in his bed.
“There was never a “you and me”, Steve,” and this time the bitterness was more apparent.
“No.” Tony shook his head. “Just the time travel. The ‘how’ seemed a step too far into the woo-woo crazy. Although I
The cool dark green of the trees quickly enveloped him. He stopped, hopped off the scooter and had the armor on a second later. He lifted off a couple of feet into the air, scanning the area.
“Great.” Rhodey sounded resigned. “I call dibs on the HulkBuster armor.”
“What would that have helped?” she asked with a shrug. “He won’t trust me again.” The sheen in her eyes belied her casual calm.
“Seriously Steve, let me go in. I swear, I can do this.” Tony wasn’t sure why this felt so important but he knew it was. He needed Steve to trust him with this. Trust that Tony wouldn’t fuck it up.
~~~O~~~~
The only thing that kept him from flying apart was the steady warmth of Steve’s arm around his shoulders as he wept for the terrible death of his second child and the unexpected, joyful resurrection of his first.
“What’s his game?” Scott asked. “I mean, why would he do anything to help us further?”
“”You still think we need to be held accountable by someone.” Steve watched him, this regal man who protected his people and those he considered vulnerable with the ferocity of a pride of lions.
“It’s a conspiracy!” Tony yelled.
“Don’ wanna be shober,” Tony insisted, trying to flop back down again. He didn’t want to see Steve. He didn’t want to talk to Steve. Steve with his perfect hair and blue eyes and ridiculous body. Tony hated Steve.
I forgot to add possible triggers due to anxiety attacks :( Bad Cyd - apologies to those who may have not been warned.
“I don’t know how to open them,” Thor said, Tony’s body still and seeming small against him.
Steve just snorted. “Am I lying?”
~~~O~~~~
Tony winced as Steve shouted in his earpiece. “I asked for a solution, not an escape plan!”
Steve cupped Bucky’s face. “You were and always have been, my best friend. Nothing will ever change that.”
Tony saw the flash of crimson that coated Crowley’s eyes. He had a bad feeling that getting out of Hell was going to be a fuckton harder than getting in had been.
Steve frowned. “Uh, Tony?” Perhaps Tony was still suffering some residual effects from his trip to Jotunheim.
Tony got a little dizzy as the stairs spiraled down. “He knows we’re coming?” He didn’t turn around to glare at Strange, but he thought it hard. “How?”
You guys make writing this story fun. Thank you so much for the support. The kudos & comments spur me on.
“You said tight,” Rhodey sniggered and then yelped when Pepper reached out at twisted his ear. Hard.
“Oh god.” Clint’s breath was choppy. Tony could recognize the signs of a panic attack about two hundred miles away.
“Fuck!” Tony spat. “This is why I never share my toys!” He was skimming through the old computer archive, fingers flying over the screen of his tablet. He’d loaded JARVIS as soon as they’d arrived, making sure that HYDRA didn’t try to destroy things.
He cackled madly, taking off at a dead run as soon as he heard the cursing start.
“Tasha.” Clint’s soft voice broke the tension. “He doesn’t know. Don’t be angry with ignorance.”
“I just got him back,” Steve said.
Tony stared at him. “You’ve watched The Princess Bride?” It made his mind boggle.
“My thoughts are
“Let me go,” Ross growled, every inch the cornered animal.
“That’s about right for me too,” Sam added. “Steve’s my friend. I made the choice to support him rather than the Accords. He’d never let me down before. Plus, that shit that went down with Hydra made me lose trust in almost every government institution in the world.” He nodded at Steve. “Where he goes, I go.”
Tony almost fell off the bed he was laughing so hard.
And as for Wanda Maximoff, frankly, she terrified him. Since Pietro’s death she’d had little concern for her own health. She took risks and Steve wondered if she would survive without her twin.
Happy came back with Thor in tow. “I thought…” he began.
“I don’t think I’ve been okay for a while, Sam.” And perhaps that was the most honest he’d been with himself in years.
is the creepiest.”
“He knows where we are,” Sam said suddenly. “He knows, but we’re still here. Free.” He took a step away from Steve.
“I received no such order, Mr. Stark.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. sounded defensive.
Tony wasn’t impressed. “Right now, you need me
Tony sighed into his arm. “When you say
Tony shook his head. “Rhodey says no, but he’s not seen the President naked yet so he can’t say for sure.”  They all blinked.
“I believe that would be the wisest choice,” Thor said eventually.
I wish I could answer all of you but I think you'd rather I write....Right?
~o0o~
Tony still had to adjust every time Vision spoke. It was hard hearing J.A.R.V.I.S. voice from an actual mouth. “Thanks buddy,” Tony said, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “I appreciate the assist.”
The thrusters punched in and Tony was bulleting towards the place where he hoped he’d find his friend.
Natasha looked at Bruce. “You sure about this?” she asked.
Steve ignored him. “When this is over,” he repeated. “Just so you know. I’m going to ask you to marry me.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Get! I am a busy man.”
messing with you.”
Sam had found a piece of tarpaulin and covered Wanda’s body. Steve couldn’t stop looking at the broken thing that had been a powerful and dangerous girl. A girl who had betrayed them more times than Steve could remember. Every word, very kindness, all a lie.
“Pepper knows me too,” Tony said. “She couldn’t handle it.”
“What?” He was quite sure his mouth hung open. “Wait a minute, Buck, Steve is not….”
~o0o~
Bucky stepped up to him, put his hand on the back of Tony’s neck and pulled him forward so that their foreheads rested together. “Deal with it.”
Steve frowned. “You always antagonize him,” he said.
“That sounds like Steve’s idea of a party,” Natasha replied, wrapping and tying the rope before passing it to Clint.
“It did,” Tony said, watching as his own image appeared in the projection. “I made a few adjustments.”
But Tony’s quip had done its job and people were chuckling, murmuring to one another after what they had seen.
He wiggled a finger in his ear. “I beg your pardon?”
Dean folded his arms. “They can carry a grudge for fucking ever.” He was actually pouting.
Tony whistled. “Bucky, my geriatric friend, you are a wealthy man.”
Bruce smiled, his eyes shadowed. “The feeling is completely mutual, Dr. Stark.” He turned to face the General Assembly. “Tony Stark asked me to come here to speak to you about what happened to me. What Thaddeus Ross did to me. There are not many people in this world that I trust. This man is one of them.” He nodded towards Tony.
Tony met that steady cobalt gaze. Still so much the soldier. Bucky had always been at Steve’s shoulder, guarding his left with Sam at his right. Tony had once been there, until he’d stepped out from behind his captain and fucked everything up.
“Ma’am, we’d really appreciate your help.” Steve wore his aw-shucks persona like a glove. “It’s sort of our job to be the guys on the front line.”
“Is there any reason your brother would have taken refuge in the form of a female feline animal?” Natasha asked Thor.
Bucky’s face shut down and he pulled back. “Oh.” His voice went flat.
wheee! earlier this week! Go me!
Tony shivered. “I’m going to fuck it up.” He dropped to the bed, shirt still in his hands. “I always fuck things up.”
Dean nodded. “Wait, there’s more.”
“It looks like a tiny orc,” Pepper said, peering down at it from her perch on the microwave unit.
Bucky pressed a kiss to Tony’s bare shoulder. “You need to know how important you are, Tony.” He rested his forehead against Tony’s back. “You keep thinking that you’re replaceable.”
” Everyone in the kitchen yelled at the same time. Thor sat back down with a discernible pout.
“Satan needs protection from
Ross struggled against the hold Richards had on him. “You’re proving the necessity of the Bill by your actions right now,” he snarled.
made mistakes.
She inclined her head. “Shall we go then and test our theory?”
Tony shook his head, waving towards the bed. “Get it warm for me so long.” His lecherous eyebrow-waggle was almost cartoonish.
“Oh, he’s usually
“We have to build the presence of an Asgardian into the equation,” Tony said, continuing his train of thought. “It’s not just space and time and black holes now.” He looked over at Thor. “We really need the Tesseract.”
Falling back to walk with Sam and Dean, he set his mouth in a thin line. “You having a tiff with loverboy?” Dean asked, seemingly okay with the situation after his little explosion. Tony wondered just how messed-up Dean’s life had been that being beamed by a god out of Hell was just another day in the office.
” Jörmungandr said. He suited action to his words, taking several steps forward.
Steve gave him a sorry attempt at a scowl. “I’ve always been a good kisser, Buck. You just
Tony shook his head, arms tightening around Bucky. “I have no fucking idea,” he gritted. “One second he was fine and then….” He lifted a hand to brush the long strands of hair off Bucky’s face. “Come on, Jim, don’t do this to me now.”
Natasha pushed Clint away from Tony. She narrowed her gaze as she stared at him. “You’re okay?”
“Take it off, please,” Steve begged. “You don’t have to…”
Thor’s eyes were very kind. “And is deserving of all of the respect we can show him.”
Her gaze slipped from person to person. “Every last one of you should be on your knees thanking Tony for saving your lives.” She stopped abruptly. “What is that?” She stared at the covered body.
“Shoot,” Tony said, straightening up as though expecting a blow.
Holy fuck, Rhodey was right. He was thoroughly fucked.
Her alarm burst bright red. “I know, I’m scared too. He’s…” He let her feel the emotions that Tony evoked in him, messy and jumbled, but warm and inviting like a winter campfire.
Her smile widened. “And if I were to tell you of his talks with me as he roams my halls, confessing deep secrets to the only one he trusts to keep them?”
why Steve can’t choose,” Bucky said, taking Tony by surprise.
Who’d turned him down.
Richards looked like he wanted to argue, but whatever he saw in Xavier’s eyes shut him up. “So what do we do?” he asked instead.
~~~~~~
Tony wondered just
“What?” Happy probed. “And what were Professor Mind-reader and Doctor Elastic doing there?”
“Gimme a minute,” Tony said, his mind going over what information they had so far. “The Aether, that’s with this Collector guy?” He looked to Thor for confirmation. He nodded. “You sure it’s safe?”
Jim clenched his jaw. “My arm ready?” he asked instead.
“Yes, Scott?” Steve motioned for him to speak.
Coulson’s impassive mask slipped a little. “To be honest, my recovery was touch and go, and by the time I was capable of coming back to work, well, things had changed.” He sighed, lifting his arm to show them an artificial hand. “A lot has happened.”
Tony quivered, senses already on overload. “Please,” he begged.
,” Tony amended.
Bucky waved a tired hand. “Fine.” He sounded exhausted. “Do your damndest, Doc.”
Bucky dropped his arm across Steve’s shoulders. “Rule of thumb, babe. He’s
“We’re close to my place.” Clint’s voice went quiet. “The farm…it’s just over….” He swallowed hard, waving towards a small hill.
“Hell, no,” Rhodes said. “That one’s head is big enough as it is thank you.” He turned to Scott. “Agent May will see that you get home safely,” he said.
. “Warmer than jail,” he snapped. He stalked out, ignoring the weighted silence left behind. Steve still hadn’t told him about his parents and his
Tony pushed the door open and looked down the very narrow corridor. “Does this look like the set of a horror movie, or is that just me?”
Steve gave a dry chuckle. “We used to draw straws for who was the one who would go down and drag you out.”
Vision nodded, stepped forward and projected a video that to this day made Tony feel sick. Wanda sat curled up in on herself on a metal shelf with a thin mattress. The collar around her neck was the worst of it, the straitjacket not much better, but it was the expression in her eyes that haunted Tony.
“You are the most oblivious dude in the history of history,” Sam told him with a small laugh. “Stark has always thought the sun shines out of your ass.”
“I wonder how he’s doing it?” Bucky mused. “I mean, if he’s stuck in another dimension, then how is he reaching this one?”
Crowley’s smile was vicious. “If I know the Winchesters, and I
“Crow twins?” Steve had no idea what was going on.
“Er….” Strange went a little pale. “Perhaps I may have miscalculated just a little.”
“Explain,” Pepper ordered.
The elevator pinged open and Rhodey rushed out followed by Clint, Bruce and Natasha. “Tony!” Rhodey skidded to a halt when he saw that Tony was awake. “F.R.I.D.A.Y. said…”
Just that true.
humiliating. “Thanks, but I’m not hungry.”
When Bucky had realized that
The tall, beefy physio just rolled his eyes at Tony. “It’s fine, Mr. Stark. I’ve got this.”
“That’s who I am,” Bucky whispered, something terribly broken in his voice. “If I have the memories, then it’s me.”
. We have to fix this.”
Pepper tapped a foot. “Spit it out, Tony.” She was used to his attempts to procrastinate.
“We should shower together,” Tony said around his toothbrush. “Save water. Protect the environment.” He was distracted by the miles of flesh in front of him. Neither Steve nor Bucky seemed to be particularly worried that they were nude. It had taken years for Tony not to flinch at the sight of the scar in the center of his own chest.
“Charming? Handsome? Amazingly intelligent?” Tony suggested with a little leer and a tilt of his head.
Tony held up his hands and ordered the faceplate to open. “You seem a little defensive.” He kept his voice low, tone conciliatory.
“Try,” Natasha urged. “What have you got to lose? We’re not all doctors, but we may be able to give you some outside perspective.”
“Bucky is someone who knew me when I was a scrawny kid with asthma who never backed down from a fight.” Steve wanted Vision to understand. “He loved me before I became Captain American, not
“After we’d all shit our pants we had a good laugh,” Rhodey said. “You couldn’t have warned us?”
Sam made a confused noise. “But then he should have reported us. Handed us over.”
“If everything is to your satisfaction, Mr. Stark.” Pepper's voice broke into the conversation. Shit, Tony had completely forgotten that she was there.
“You passed out, Tony.” Steve kept his voice gentle.
“None of us are half-cocked, Agent,” Tony quipped, eyes on Clint. “We’re all fully cocked.”
Tony took a deep breath. “Avengers, time to work for a living.”
Natasha’s legs were tucked beneath her as she snuggled in to Bruce. Sam and Rhodey were playing a fiercely competitive game of beer pong. Loki and Clint were facing off over the pool table and Tony was slumped between the nonagenarians. It was surprisingly comfortable and the slight buzz from the alcohol made Tony’s brain-to-mouth filter a little looser than  normal.
“And yet…” Tony stepped back as something walked out of the tunnel. Whatever or whoever it was, the air practically sang with power.
Thor propped his hands on his hips. “I am well able to take care of myself,” he said, frowning at Tony.
“Thanks for the heads-up,” Tony said. “Wouldn’t have guessed if you hadn’t told me.”
“Your parents…” Bucky sounded like he was speaking through a grater. “What happened to them?”
“I beg your pardon,” Natasha said. “Speak for yourself, Tony.”
“Is she dead?” Clint croaked from the pilot’s chair, wrestling the jet back under control. Steve felt a pang of sorrow for his friend. Wanda had been Clint’s protégée and it was almost cruel to have not only lost his family, but the girl he’d trusted to have his back.
“Don’t hurry on my account,” Steve told him as he pushed the bathroom door open.
And yelped when Bucky stood on his foot. “Ow! What the hell?” He glared at Bucky.
Thor frowned. “I’m not comfortable with the thought of killing one of my comrades.”
“Can you please stop with the theatrics?” Tony was done. “We’d really like to go ahead with saving the world.”
“We’re not going to mess with your place,” Dean replied, missing Steve and Sam’s interaction. “We just want to make sure the head dick can’t get out.”
“The Accords would have happened, regardless of what you did, Tony.” Rhodey stared at Steve. “No matter who agreed or didn’t agree to sign them.”
Just then a large circle of what seemed like fire split open and spat out two figures. Steve and Sam jumped to their feet. One of them was remarkably familiar.
“Sounds like a plan,” Steve said.
“Why?” Bucky asked.
“Sam’s right,” Natasha said. “I think I know where we’re going.”
“That’s why we were fighting.” Bucky met Tony’s gaze. “I told him to man the fuck up and quickly, or you’d move on to someone new.”
Steve reached out blindly, grabbing at Tony’s shoulder, and pulling him in. “You…” he said, voice breaking. “You gave him back to me.”
Tony shuddered. “Not likely,” he admitted. He’d been on a one-way path to self-destruction when Stane had altered his life forever. He rubbed absently at the scar on his chest that reminded him of just how much had changed.
Sam snorted coffee out of his nose and Dean made a noise that sounded like a dying whale as he laughed.
“Your friends are returning,” Strange replied. “This will all be resolved shortly.”
“You keep doing whatever you two are doing up there,” Bucky said. “I’m pretty happy right where I am.” He lifted one of Tony’s legs over his shoulder.
~~~~~~
Steve smiled. “That’s really good information, thanks Thor.” Thor beamed at him, proud of his contribution. Steve wasn't going to think that he looked like a large golden retriever with it's tongue hanging out. He wasn't....shit. Steve looked back at Lee. “And?”
“Drink this.” Rhodey handed him a glass filled with a liquid that appeared radioactive.
“I remember some of them,” Bucky admitted. “It’s like standing in a dark room and flashes keep going off. I get bits and pieces of life before and during.”
“You did.”
“What the fuck just happened? Cap? What- what’s going on?”
“She leaves him, eventually. She takes Morgan. Stark isn’t the kind of man that can come back from the chaos and go on as nothing happened. He’s already failed, and he’ll keep doing so again and again. I had a hunch so when it was the time, I stopped myself giving the time stone back, right in New York. That Steve Rogers trusted me, told me to make things right. When I looked through time I knew.”
He unconsciously shook her off and turned wide eyed and asked, “What unit?”
“Sounds great Dum Dum,” Steve smiled elatedly. He was excited to see what Dum Dum would get him, this was quite important to Steve. This was the first real thoughtful gift Steve was going to get Tony and it would mean a lot if it was good quality items.
Tony finally reached the windowsill of the room and climbed onto the narrow wooden edge before saying, “Look me up when you are moving around more and want someone to show you the ropes of this crazy world. I would gladly help sleeping beauty out.”
Steve pulled out his money pouch and pulled out twenty-three coins and dropped them into the man’s hand not really liking the enjoyment the man is experiencing. Still, he got to free the harpy and that was all he cared about. The man handed Steve the keys to the harpy’s cage and to his cuffs telling him that the harpy was his problem now. Steve did not care to answer.
The gates opened and all the saved soldiers and stolen machinery poured in and mingled with the remaining surviving soldiers and pals. Cheers had erupted and it seemed like the anger and stress of the ordeal faded away. People were glad to be alive. People were glad to have their friends and battle mates back. It made Steve smile. It was never about him even as Bucky called out for a round of applause. It was never about him even as the Colonel came up to him thanking him. It was about the men behind him. They were the true warriors. They were the real Captain Americas.
“Not my business,” the man tried to continue on but Tony stood frankly in front of him, “Move along omega whore.”
“What happened?” Bucky demanded as he too entered the tent area, “all I saw was a blur!”
Steve stared at the artifact in his hands. It was mesmerizing in its beauty and he almost wanted to keep it to himself but he knew it was not really him talking. The artifact was cursed to lure in those weak of heart and poison them with endless vanity and greed. He sealed himself thinking of all the things he already had. His team, his family, and Tony who was the newest member of said family. It was hard to ignore the pull but he just wrapped the artifact in a thick cloth and suddenly Steve was freed from the effects of the curse. As if a heavy shadow lifted off his shoulders and he could finally breathe easily.
