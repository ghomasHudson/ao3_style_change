Then again, it might have been something that had been going on forever, but it wasn't anything Tony ever thought he'd undergo himself — didn't even think it was
…when Bucky said, "Oh, shit, he's coming back," and Steve's eyes went wide before he dove under the desk again, thumping his way back to his hiding spot.
"Common sense," he replied. "Look, it's just... She's clearly from another universe. She's not from our timeline. She can't be."
"Never do, baby blue. I'll have JARVIS pull up the feed from the gym, though. So I can watch you flex those muscles and get all sweaty."
"It wasn't. I don't even know why I'm saying this. Hell, even my Steve doesn't believe me. But trust me, it's not your fault. You did everything that you could—"
Steve gave a funny smile like he knew he was caught out but was still trying to find ways to counter what Tony was saying. "They were good," he said, "and I was hungry."
"Oh, yeah," she said and looked down at it. "These aren't the real 'vengers. These are the cartoon 'vengers that Papa says aren't anything like the real 'vengers."
"Hmm... that's sweet, babe, but we are, uh..." He sighed out a breath and pulled away from Steve, and Steve frowned and watched as he moved away and made a face, running a hand through his hair.
Steve was everywhere he turned: from a stupid knickknack to a blanket to a can of soda he'd left on the coffee table. There were his notes on another table and a pair of sneakers kicked off to the side and a picture of the two of them taken at the Avenger-family picnic Thor had made them do last summer (after being introduced to the concept of a 'picnic').
"Oh, my god," Barton muttered. "Blah, blah, blah. Look, just kiss each other goodnight so we can get the hell out of here, OK? I promise your baby-daddy will be in tip-top shape the next time you see him. He can't even get drunk on Thor's special Asgardian homebrew."
He was about to remark that it was but one more thing he'd missed out on, but he decided not to spoil the mood.
The hero worship hadn't really survived adolescence, though, and by the time Tony had met the man for real when he was going on forty-two, all that was really left for him was contempt. Contempt for the fact that Howard had seemingly cared more for his dead friend than he had for his own son; contempt for the fact that he was expected to deal with this walking anachronism like he actually had a valid viewpoint; contempt for the fact that he had feet made of clay.
hated it as much as you claimed, you wouldn't even think about going out in public looking like that. And you wouldn't have agreed to see Denise or go for an ultrasound."
The smell that greeted his nostrils told him that yes, really, and he threw a glance at the kitchen and wondered if Tony...
"Oh, yeah, sure," Tony said and grabbed a couple spoons from the flatware drawer he'd recently familiarized himself with. "It's just drinks," he said and set the spoons down on the island. "Until it's dinner. Until it's meeting her parents. Until it's china patterns and silver and linens and the next thing you know, she's got you living in a three-bedroom Cape Cod in the suburbs."
Yawning, he padded into the kitchen and saw Steve sitting at the island, the entire order spread out in front of him, takeout boxes and plastic containers, all of which had clearly been dipped into by the fork in Steve's hand. He glanced up as Tony entered, and he looked almost abashed as he said, "Hey," and went back to his food.
" Tony cried then turned to the TV to see a static image of a five-year-old stock photo of Justin Hammer with ON THE PHONE: JUSTIN HAMMER on the screen and Hammer's whiny, nasally, petulant voice coming through as loud and clear as a phone connection could be.
would talk about breastfeeding. Even just pregnancy in general. I don't even think most expectant mothers knew what was going on. And fathers?" He scoffed then glanced at Tony. "You know they let them into delivery rooms now?"
her or anything. Clearly, I do not own Pepper Potts. But, yeah, when she finally decides to make an honest man out of Happy, I have every intention of walking her down that aisle."
He jumped when he saw another soda with citrus slices and a swizzle stick set in front of him, and he looked up to see his Long Island Lothario setting down another cosmo in front of Natasha. He grabbed a chair from another table and pulled it up to theirs and sat down, hunching close to Tony, and said, "You know, you ladies, if you were ever looking to maybe—"
Steve wasn't sure he wanted to know what that meant, so he brushed it aside and nodded at the mess. "How 'bout we finish this up and… I don't know. What's on the agenda for the rest of today?"
stooped to listening to Darcy?" Rhodey asked, thoroughly unimpressed. "You know this is the woman that refers to Mjölnir as 'Mew-Mew,' right?"
The woman quirked her head at his reference, and grunted a bit and said, "Jesus, like talking to Steve sometimes."
Both Wilson and Bruce began to defend themselves at the exact same time, and Tony had known Bruce must have flapped his damned gums to Steve about saving the environment, but he hadn't thought Wilson was the type to push that agenda, too. Then again, Wilson was still doing part- time counseling work, so of course it made sense he was into that hippy-drippy crap.
"I told Tony I didn't want him in the field until everything was put right again, but I didn't say anything about Iron Man."
"I didn't say it would be perfect!" he snapped and hopped off the bar stool. He scowled at Bruce and padded his way over to the couch, tablet in hand as JARVIS pulled up an array of bedroom suites that might best suit a child. "I know it's not going to be easy, but I know that if I don't at least
He set the carrier on the island countertop, Olivia gumming a pacifier and her eyes half-closed, and Tony shook his head some more and took the ripped box of pancake flour out of Steve's too-strong hands and gently nudged him aside. "Look, let me handle this, all right?"
," Steve said with a scoff and rolled eyes, but Barnes just continued to squint at DUM-E as he considered the hunk of junk and then said, "Is he…self-aware?"
"I can't," she said with a gentle shrug, twirling her arms out and smiling as she did so. "I told you it's out of my hands."
"That'll stay exactly as I am and watch them grow old and die and there's nothing I can do about it."
," Thor replied. "And no, it is...not a fairytale. The Infinity stones are very real, and very dangerous were they to fall into the wrong hands."
Steve went still for a moment then frowned at the paper as he seemed to come back to himself. "Seriously?"
"Nothing," he said and leaned against the counter, dropping his voice almost to a murmur so that it hopefully wouldn't draw Olivia's attention to him. Rhodey would try to hold her, but she'd probably be able to wiggle her way out if she was determined enough.
Steve considered him a moment, standing there in a gray pair of boxer briefs and a tight, tight undershirt. He tilted his head in thought and said, "Are you sure?"
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes, and he went back to looking at himself in the mirror, poking and prodding and just generally eyeing all his flaws with disgust. "You're so full of shit."
The other two hummed their responses into their drinks, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Whatever. Can't say I didn't warn you," and picked up his soda. "Also," he said and swirled the ice around with the swizzle stick, "fuck all of you and your cocktails."
"I'm so sorry, Tony," Steve said, sounding absolutely wrecked. "I'm so sorry. I should have— I was selfish, and I wasn't thinking, and I shouldn't have—"
And then, Bruce had sighed a little, and he'd pulled his glasses off and rubbed his eyes with his thumb and forefinger before looking straight at Steve and saying, "
He gently maneuvered his hand so he was holding Steve's instead of Steve playing with his, and he squeezed it a little and said, "For what it's worth, we spent most of the time talking about you."
crying over this — he went over to the elevator and stepped on as soon as the doors opened. "Penthouse, J," he called out, but JARVIS said, "
He set Olivia in the bassinette, and Natasha murmured something in Russian then said, "You're not alone, Tony. You're never going to be alone. Maybe you don't have Steve anymore, but you've got the rest of your family to look out for you."
"Of course she's not. She's dead," Tony said then turned his attention back to Ella. "Anyway, long story short, crazy space lady finds me, like, six months ago, senses I'm 'bonded'—" he used finger quotes on the word, "—to this one here—" he jerked a thumb at Steve, "—and then says, 'You know what you two need? A kid.'" He motioned over himself. "Then, presto-change-o I'm like this so that
…on my finger, so I took it off before it got too tight and constricted the blood flow and it ended up falling off."
"Although," Tony continued before Steve could rebut him, "I'm not actually sure which one of us is the 'May' and which one of us is the 'December.'"
"Eh, can you make it two years?" Tony suggested. "That pool's a little larger to choose from. I mean, ten years, we're looking at my best buddy, who would totally do it, and my ex-girlfriend, who is a very important and busy CEO that's also on the other side of the country."
"Because I know you meant it when you looked into that camera and said I owed you a ring. And because all I want to do is cash in my life savings and buy you the best one I can afford."
Ella just tweaked a smile and raised her hand a little like she was trying to be polite about cutting into their back-and-forth, and once she realized she'd gotten their attentions, she tweaked another small smile at them and said, "I'm sorry, what do you mean— Are you trying to say—? I mean, I read a rumor about it
stubborn. Before the Army did things to him, it always— Look, he's my friend — he's like my brother — but god…" He shook his head. "The things he suffered from. I used to think he was too fucking stubborn to die." He snorted a laugh. "I mean, he should have been dead ten-times-over. But he didn't die. He kept right on going, and it got to a point where I thought, 'What in the hell is it going to take to kill this guy?'" He went quiet for a moment at that, almost like he was contemplating something or remembering something, and then he exhaled a breath and said, "But even Steve — as stubborn a son-of-a-bitch as he is — couldn't have survived that."
Tony shrugged and turned back to his table and saw Wilson and what looked to be his date for the night, Sharon Carter, were approaching. They greeted the denizens of Table 1, both looking resplendent in their chosen formal attire (really, it was only poor Bruce that needed some kind of help — even Hill's random date at least looked like he'd put some care into getting dressed). They exchanged some small talk with the other three sitting at the table before Sharon turned to Tony and said, "So, it's true."
Steve's lax attitude about his own safety worried him on his best day, but now with this…issue…of his, he was downright terrified. This was so far off the spectrum of life experiences that he didn't even know where to begin to process it, but the main thing keeping him sane was that Steve was right there alongside him. Changed into a woman, impregnated, forced to carry a fetus to term: the fact that he had chosen none of this was downright terrifying, and not that he didn't appreciate having the others there to support him — he did, god did he — but having Steve there beside him meant more than anything. Not just because it was Steve's child (though he suspected that was a large part of it) but because it was Steve and because he'd kind of promised Steve 'forever' a few months ago, and much as he trusted and appreciated the others being there for him, he trusted and appreciated and
He kind of wanted to lay the whole thing out in the open right then and there. Grab the microphone from the bandstand and make a general announcement not related to all the good works the donors' funds would support in the upcoming year. Would it shut people up? God, no! They were lucky if even a fraction of the people that heard the news that 'Natasha Carbonell' was really Tony Stark actually believed it.
Steve burst out laughing, and, were Tony in a better mood, he might bristle and huff and whine about that insinuation and whatever Steve thought was so fucking funny about it. As it was, he just smiled tightly at Barnes and said, "Yes, he talks. He just hasn't found himself with anything to say."
To say Tony was blindsided or caught unaware would be an understatement. Like the flip of a switch, they were all up, all taking presumably predetermined places as they made their move — one that had clearly been discussed at length at some point prior. Or maybe the years of working together had finally paid off and they all just knew instinctively what to do without having to run it past each other.
." He didn't mean to practically spit out the last one, but he did, and it felt oh-so-good to do so.
The clerk smiled a little, and she picked up her phone and pressed a button for an extension, and after a few moments of hushed discussion said, "Oh, no, this one you've got to see to believe." She shot a look over at the pair at that, and they exchanged looks of equal parts confusion and insult before they turned their attentions back to her.
"Yeah," he said only to have a super soldier hand pressed against his stomach for his troubles. "Really?" he asked, eyebrow raised.
"Need help?" he asked because even if he didn't know who she was, he had no desire to see her get hurt.
Tony did exactly as told, and he felt the silken touch of the other scarf wrap around his wrists as Steve bound them together, tight but not anywhere near enough to cut off circulation. He took Tony's bound wrists and gently lowered his arms so that his wrists were resting against his belly. "Stand there," Steve said before Tony felt him move away, and the next thing he thought he heard was the bathroom light click on followed by the sound of running water. He remained standing, blindfolded, his bound wrists a comfortable and yet tantalizing weight against his belly, and in the anticipation of what he knew — or actually
"Yeah, Tones, we know. We get it," Rhodey said. He then motioned to the small amount left on his plate and said, "Here, you want mine?"
He yawned and rubbed his belly and did his business in the bathroom then went down to the kitchen to get some coffee, finding to his everlasting annoyance that
kill him, but the slow-burning anger and the cold shoulder he'd suffer from his better half would be a much worse fate.
The not-quite-term-of-endearment startled Steve. "Capsicle?" he murmured then shook it off. "Tony, what's wrong?"
But Steve just shushed him and said, "Just dance," as he began to sway with him to the gentle rhythm. Tony put his arm around Steve's shoulders and reached up to press a cheek to his, and he closed his eyes and let the mood overtake him, forgetting for a moment that he was both angry and upset with the man holding him in his arms.
can be sustained. It was a ruse. They didn't have his baby. His baby was a she. If nothing else, the little pink sleeper with the cute little flowers she was dressed in (like many baby-related things that seemed to keep appearing, Natasha had pulled it out of thin air) was a dead giveaway.
"What? No. I'm just saying before you sit up until five in the morning figuring out some way to lead another wave of feminism, maybe you should get a good night's sleep."
"OK," he said and flashed a grin at the waiter that had finally arrived to take their order. "But only because you asked nicely."
Steve had done his best to keep that deep, dark part of himself hidden from sight from the moment that he realized that part of him existed. It was a moral failing, a character flaw, one so damaging that even the serum quite obviously couldn't fix it. The serum had fixed everything else about him, but it hadn't fixed
"It was not all a waste," she said. "In fact, there were parts that you enjoyed, were there not? And if you were to turn back, there would be many parts you would miss."
Thought how much longer he had until she was making fun of his abilities, too, he couldn't say. Probably not as long as he would like.
She grumbled a little and tried to fight it, but Tony just stood up and scooped her up into his arms. "Yeah, no, I don't think so, Young Miss. You're getting cranky again, and I'm not taking you to Spring Palace if you're going to be cranky like that, and Daddy will be all sorts of cranky himself if he doesn't get his traditional Christmas General Tso's."
"That's some iron-clad logic you've got there, Barton," Tony said, and Barnes sat back and put his hands up in defense.
It had never, in all the years since that fateful night, occurred to him that Tony had nodded and gone along with the breakup simply because it was what Steve wanted. He was certain Tony wanted it as much as he had. He wasn't sure that, if he'd known the truth at the time, he wouldn't have done the same. Maybe he would have spent more of his time trying to explain his position to Tony, trying to make him understand that it was for the best and he was only doing it because while this might not have been what Tony
There were wreaths on the walls and lighted bunches of garland strung from various points in the ceiling, and JARVIS was playing pleasant Christmas carols for them as they ate their meal and chatted about a host of subjects. It wasn't a full gathering, of course. Clint was gone to 'flip houses' again (Steve suspected he had a secret girlfriend he didn't want any of them to know about) and Bruce had gone to spend the holiday with a cousin. Maria evidently had other plans as well. Pepper and Happy were out in California. Nick had sent them Christmas wishes from wherever he was trying to root out Hydra cells. Sharon was in Europe somewhere. He thought. Or maybe DC. He couldn't remember what Sam had said. And Sam, of course, had gone to spend the night at home with his mom after promising to bring back some cookies for the gang.
The damned thing finally loaded after he'd gotten his shirt and pants on, and he opened the browser and went to CNN like Sam had suggested. He scrolled down the page and grumbled a little when nothing jumped out at him.
"Sweet," he finally said, his brow furrowed and his eyes narrowed in that way they did whenever he was trying to figure out something. "Think I'm getting vanilla, which I don't quite understand."
Tony just held it up, staring at it, and he blinked a couple times like he'd blown a fuse before he looked at Bucky and said, "Is this supposed to be funny?"
support him and tell him how good a job he was doing and how proud of him he was. Steve didn't get to be the first or the second or the third or even the fourth person to hold the little newborn girl he'd named after
Rhodey moved over to his side, slowly, like he was still trying to assess the situation before him. "He said your
Thankfully, the Bobbsey Twins' hourly pissing contest came to a halt with the arrival of Steve with what looked like two gallon containers of coffee and three boxes of doughnuts. His arrival was cheered by the peanut gallery before they all pounced, grabbing boxes of doughnuts and coffee and helping themselves to the feast.
But Tony had been the one to do it all from the moment, well, honestly the moment she'd even been conceived. He'd done the gestating, the birthing, the feeding. Sure, Steve got up with her during the night, but that was only because he was a light sleeper, and he was up before Tony could even begin to wake up.
that could twitch their nose or blink their eyes for him no matter what he said. Someone in the whole of the cosmos outside of the Goddess Esmeralda had to be able to undo this spell. Of course, with his luck, they'd fuck it up and he'd end up with a tail or something or some weird hybrid, and honestly, if that was the case, he'd probably stick to being a woman.
Once he'd finished up in the bathroom, he went back into the bedroom and took a quick and unsubtle look around. If he took too much time, that Tony fellow would come looking for him, and something told him he didn't want Tony to honestly suspect this to be the work of a 'galactic cosmonaut,' whatever that meant. The décor of the room was sophisticated and yet simplistic, muted colors and a neutral palette. As an excuse to take up more time than he knew he had, he straightened out the bedclothes, tucking the sheets in and fluffing up the pillows, and his eyes finally hit upon a framed photo atop the bureau. He finished righting the comforter then went over and picked up the silver frame, eyeing the picture within in slight confusion. He recognized himself adorned in what sort of looked like his Captain America uniform (close but not quite) without the helmet. His brown-gloved hands (and were those gloves…fingerless?) were joined with what looked to be Tony's, and they were…kissing. His heart stopped, and he looked around for someone — anyone — that might see this and be tempted to report him. Fantasizing about it, hell, even a quick one in the dark was one thing; pictorial evidence of the dirty deed was another thing entirely. Tony's dark hair was mussed per usual, and he looked to be dressed in some sort of odd metal suit — red and gold and, come to think of it, looking a lot like that one toy that was joined together with the Captain America-looking toy the little blonde girl had been clutching fast to.
birthday we're celebrating. It's our nation's birthday. Are you really that vain, Steven? Do you really think that song is about you?"
"Clint," Steve said, direction his attention away from Tony, "find out what you can about this Strucker. His contacts, his allies, his last known-whereabouts. I'm getting the feeling he's someone we really don't want having any control over that scepter."
He took the stairs two-at-a-time then went over to the bedroom. He stopped and looked down at his slumbering little infant girl, a pang hitting him square in the chest where the arc reactor had once sat at the knowledge that, not without a lot of work on his part, his nursing days for her were over.
He giggled a little as he thought about this. He couldn't really figure out any other appropriate reaction, and the other three quirked confused and concerned looks at him, but he shook his head and said, "Nothing. Just… Only something Steve could really appreciate."
Steve shook his head but didn't break his gaze with Tony. "No, I mean I'm not just good or fine. I'm perfect. I've got everything I could possibly want right here."
Which it wasn't overall. He'd read the horror stories, sure, but so far things had been…not just bearable for him but OK. Good, even. Not much pain. Maybe it felt a little weird — at least at first until he went numb from the sensation — but other than that, it really wasn't so bad.
"Don't pretend you're above us," Barton said. "You've had a bottle of lotion and a box of tissues next to your bed just like the rest of us."
time, and when he woke up, everyone was gone! And he was sad 'cuz he didn't have anyone. But then he found you and the 'vengers, and then he was happy again. But he's afraid he's gonna fall asleep again and we'll all be gone. Where would we go, Papa? And why would we leave Daddy? I don't want to leave Daddy."
Pepper just looked between Tony and the little varmint that had attached itself to her. "What is she?"
"Told you," was all Wilson said before Barton turned to the assembled group and said, "Well, I guess now's as good a time as any."
Steve just put a hand to his lower back, and he rubbed it a bit and kissed his cheek then went over to the island. "What's going on?"
She pressed her hands together in a triangle shape and then set the shape atop a quarter of the sandwich. "That little."
After, still in pajamas, he padded into the kitchen where Steve was already smearing cream cheese on a bagel, and he reached out and grabbed half of it and kissed his jaw before he took a large and savory bite.
think you sense something, but the only 'bond' I can feel with Steve is the one that forms when he sticks his dick inside of me."
Tony set the container of gelato down, and he went over and cupped his hands in front of Barnes. Natasha just raised an eyebrow and said, "You couldn't possibly want them."
"—with the ladies, and you're afraid even if I am, well, I mean I guess I'm technically a lady to some degree, but you're afraid I might fall into the same trap as all the others."
"I'm not short!" he said and went over to Steve. "I'm five-eight in this body. The average American woman is something like five-four or five-five. I'm
me not to call him that in the bedroom. Something about 'crossing the streams,' I think. I don't know. Afraid he'll get all worked up in the field, or something, if I call him 'Cap' while he's fucking me into the mattress."
Steve's eyes went wide in horror, and Tony said, "Yeah, it's probably a good thing you missed the early 2000s. I think that would have been a rough time for you. Though I would seriously have paid good money to see Dick Cheney tell Captain America to go fuck himself — and don't think he wouldn't've!"
"He never hated you, Tony. That's my point. There was something about you from the start. Something about you that got under his skin. Something he couldn't shake." She smiled a little, coy and bemused. "I don't think he realized what it really was at the time, but looking back, he could probably admit it to himself now."
Tony turned to Steve and went to hand the baby over to him, but Steve just leaned down and brushed his lips against Tony's, soft, sweet, and maybe a touch wanton if the way he nipped at and then ran the tip of his tongue against his lower lip meant anything.
He turned back to Steve expectantly, motioning for Steve to get the proverbial show on the road, and Steve chuckled a little and shook his head but said, "The things I do for you," as he stuck his thumbs in the waistband of his boxer briefs and shoved them down.
He shivered and shook his head, still able to feel how tightly his arms had been bound, how harsh the lighting had been, how
Tony smiled and leaned into Steve, resting his head against Steve's shoulder, and he felt Steve kiss the top of his head. He stared at the muted TV ahead of them a few minutes, and when what looked to be a serious scene turned yet again into a rape-fest, Tony rolled his eyes and said, "J, I don't care what you put on, but find
"Before," Steve replied, smiling in that way that said he knew Tony was deflecting from the hard truths of his tale. "But don't think it didn't rear its ugly head again after watching that."
"Not that," Steve said with a shake of his head. "Just nothing beyond that ever happened. Tough to find the time or the place to do even what we did."
"Why does it always seem like you're raring to go when I'm ready to settle down?" he muttered at his errant stomach then grabbed a pair of underwear and stepped into them. "Not there ever was a question, but you are
He still hadn't really moved, and Tony wondered what he was doing until he felt the index and pointer fingers of Steve's left hand pushing at his mouth.
Steve barked out a laugh while Tony took a gulp of punch, and he smacked his lips some and said, "So, uh, is there
OK, maybe there'd been a bit more of that dominance stuff in their relationship than he'd allowed himself to admit at the time.
Steve stared at her a moment, his eyes skirting over her face looking for some sign that she was being anything less than truthful to him, her own emerald irises dancing in amusement as she watched him.
Tony frowned and looked from Barnes to Natasha to Bruce and back again. "But that— That doesn't mean anything. Look, you don't know about this, but Nat remembers— Last year? When we were on the run from SHIELD, or who was really Hydra? Remember when they targeted us? Bombed the bunker? We survived that—"
The clerk looked at his deputy, and she motioned to the IDs still sitting on the desk and said, "The information all matches what's on the application. The only problem is that the photos on
"Yeah," Tony said with a laugh as phony as his smile. "Yeah, it was— You know I'm always trying to fuck with people. Thought it might get the press in a bit of a tizzy for a while. It's what I'm best at."
He turned and made his way off the floor, striding away from Tony as fast as he could get, and Tony grinned and glanced up to the floor above where the other three had been watching him the entire time, and he made a motion as though to say,
The serum had begun to work its magic by the time they arrived back in New York, and Tony didn't feel bad about shaking Steve's shoulder and urging him to wake up because no one was carrying his ass off the jet. Steve was groggy and grumbled as he sat up, and Bruce disconnected the intravenous lines and said he would be OK and just needed to take it easy for a while, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "You know who you're talking to, right?"
He just hummed some and nestled back into the pillows. "That didn't quite work out the way I'd planned it."
Steve just shook his head once more. "No, not at all. I was just thinking you're very good— With her, I mean. You're kind of a natural."
"Steve is a pain in the ass," he finally decided on, "and maybe a bit— He's bigger now, so you kind of gotta listen to him, but even before, he — he had this fucking outsized attitude for this little body, like a goddamned Chihuahua. And so fucking serious. Like he was… I don't know, I think he was a little tough to take if you didn't know him. I grew up with him. I knew him. He was a fucking shit. Driest sense of humor going. Could be kind of goofy or playful around the right person. Would give the shirt off his back for you."
Pepper blinked, and Tony could tell she'd put the pieces of the puzzle together, but she still wasn't seeing the picture it made.
Natasha sucked in a breath, but Tony put a quick hand to her arm and said a calm, "Nope," as Natasha took one step to advance on her to do…something. Who knew? He didn't think Natasha was the type to allow herself to get worked up over petty comments about her attire.
And there was the little matter of a poor, innocent toddler girl caught in the middle of this madness.
"I guess so," Steve said and tried to form some sort of picture of all of those people — things? — in his head. He finally gave up and heaved out a breath as he shook his head. "How in world do they all manage to work together?"
"It's just milk. It's just milk. It's just milk," he told himself and closed his eyes and poured it over the bowl of paint chips. He cracked open his eyes to make sure he didn't pour too much in, and once he thought he had the balance right, he set the bottle with the remaining milk aside and dug into the muesli.
Tony mocked Bruce but didn't actually vocalize the words, and Bruce just shook his head and muttered something about how he could have been in Calcutta when the lab door opened, and Rhodey strode in wearing civvies and a perplexed look on his face. He glanced over at Tony and stopped short when he saw the little blonde girl sitting on Tony's lap.
Tony shrugged. "Someone to bounce ideas off of. I notice you have an issue with pants. Is that something you want to work on?"
But when Howard died, Tony was suddenly heir-apparent, and building and creating and spending time with friends had to be set aside so that Tony could be properly groomed to take over the company that bore his name. And though he oh-so-politely told Obadiah Stane to 'fuck off' when Stane told him no one wanted a fag running the company, Steve wasn't about to let Tony choose between wealth and poverty. He loved Tony. He would gladly have married Tony.
He hadn't picked his head up, resting his forehead against his hands still, and he nodded his head. "I need words, Antonia."
Steve gave him a half-pointed and half-sympathetic look. "Unless you would rather have surgery to…you know…"
Tony threw back the rest of his chlorophyll and smacked the glass down onto the table. "She… kind of already knows."
"They will be, but here, it's too cold out for you to walk down the street in just that slip of a dress. Take my jacket."
DUM-E beeped a little in recognition as Steve patted his support strut, and Barnes stared at Steve and said, "You're talking to it like it can actually understand you."
He and Steve exchanged glances, and Tony shrugged and said, "I guess so. I mean I do have a ring." He reached for the bag, but Steve pulled it further from his grasp.
Steve nodded, taking this into consideration a moment before he said, "Bruce said there were tears."
Steve exhaled a heavy breath as Tony dropped the shoes on the floor and perched on the couch cushion beside him. "What happened?" he asked like he already knew but wanted to hear the story from Tony himself, and Tony made a little face of disbelief at him.
He didn't think this was normally how it was supposed to go, and a fragment of a memory of a woman in a shimmering gown flitted into his mind. Some of his post-coital high dissipated at that, hard, cold reality punching him in the chest and making him suddenly realize that neither he — nor Tony — had been in their right mind. They couldn't have been. Yes, Steve had been overcome with lust before, but not like that. Not that desperately. Not so much that he could barely think straight. That being had turned Tony into a woman, but there had to have been more to it than that. Steve had never in his life had such a blinding, desperate need to have sex, and he would bank on the fact that Tony hadn't either. Had she cast a spell? Was it something to do with that mist of smoke she'd disappeared in? Not that Steve didn't normally find Tony the most attractive man he knew, but why had Steve had the sudden, desperate urge to fuck Tony blind make love to Tony by sheer sight alone?
The way he talked, the way his brain worked, the way he moved as he explained things, swiping at holoscreens and chattering like he didn't realize that everyone wasn't at his intellectual level and could follow without issue. He was intelligent and funny and, though he would deny it until he was blue in the face, kind and generous to those that meant the world to him. Which, as it turned out, included the group of misfit superheroes that called themselves 'the Avengers.' He'd opened up his home in New York to them, renovating the tower Loki and the Chitauri (and the Hulk, as well, and Bruce really did feel bad about that) had laid waste to and offering them space to set up their clubhouse for their 'super-secret boy band' (whatever that meant, but Tony had used it once, and the others had snickered at it, so he assumed it was a joke of some kind). Still trying to find his feet in this new world, he'd taken up the offer to stay as well, finding that he, too, had come to rely on this 'gang of idiots' (as Bruce had called them) for the support that he still couldn't admit to himself that he needed.
"Here," Tony said, and Steve turned, knocking the ribbon from his head and onto the floor, and caught what looked like…pants of some kind. Red pants with faces on them. He shot a look at the toy the little girl still held fast to in one tight hand. Faces that matched that one toy.
Tony just sighed a little, and he leaned against Steve, resting his cheek against Steve's arm just below his shoulder. "This is a mess, isn't it? This whole thing. God, I should have just stayed holed up in the tower for nine months until this all blew over."
Jim rolled his eyes and muttered, "They're toddlers. When you put the two of them together, they're toddlers."
OK, so here's the thing. Tony, over the years, had been known to be massively impulsive, and Steve's speech, though heartfelt and beautiful, had done the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do. It was meant to reassure Tony that he was doing the right thing, that if given the choice, Steve would choose him every time, and Tony's life was not worth risking for something so...extremely out of the ordinary that there were no approved methods for dealing with it outside of what internet fangirls had come up with for their favored slash pairings (and Tony was not about to take advice from them, and yeah, so he knew about that sort of stuff. So what? He made it his business to at least be familiar with all modes and methods of internet culture).
I'd know if he was dead, all right? It's like— It's like I have this connection to him — like I'm connected to him. Like I can— Like I can feel his energy or something, and it's not— He's still here. He's still with us. He's still alive."
He shrugged. "I don't know. We're kind of in uncharted territory here. I'm not insulted, if that's what you're worried about. I mean, that…mind-melting orgasm aside — seriously, that was, you have no idea — it's nice to hear that the man I want to spend the rest of my life with still finds me attractive in the form I plan to spend the rest of my life in."
Steve still didn't look at him, but he smiled a little and let out a noise that sounded like an exhaled laugh.
Tony grumbled a little bit but still went around and got into the passenger seat while Bruce, Rhodey, and Hill all squeezed into the backseat. As they buckled in, Natasha started the car, checked her mirrors (and readjusted them on him, damn her), then checked her phone and said, "We didn't have to be there at
Steve just slunk over to a worktable, his body moving like it felt awkward to him. "Was kind of hoping you'd forgotten about it," he replied.
Steve shrugged. "Dunno. There's no name attached, but it's supposed to be delivered to the penthouse, so…"
Truthfully, Tony didn't know. He was laboring under the assumption — OK, maybe not the best word choice there considering his condition — that he would go back to his normal body as soon as this…job of his was through, but truth be told, there was no way to know that that was even the case. Would he just turn back automatically? Would Esmeralda have to turn him back? Would she even
"No, it's fine," Steve said, trying to work past the awkwardness. "Glad to see you remember I'm not a cheap date."
God, these inside stories and jokes were starting to drain him. He was going to have to have JARVIS start cataloging and indexing them so he could keep them straight until he handed her off to his other self.
"And it totally doesn't count!" Bucky added. "Steve doesn't even know if it counts. Therefore, it doesn't count."
He took the pressure off his hand and looked at how the blood had soaked through the gauze. He scowled and got up to get another wrap, and he had just put the second one on when Bruce came back with the swab.
"I'm not dead!" he shouted at the screen, the mouthful of food muffling his words. "I'm just fucking pregnant!"
Instead, he went over to the newly-reinstalled window that looked out over the city. He braced an arm against the glass and leaned against it, gazing over the artificially-lit horizon of buildings and water. The sun had long-since set, and the city glittered with streetlamps and automobile lights and signage and office buildings that still saw activity even at this time of night. It was peaceful.
Tony stared at him a moment then grumbled and grabbed his shake, relieved to see that it was at least the right color for what he'd asked for. He held it up, as though to ask Steve why
"That is the second perfectly good slice of extra cheese that you've wasted. Who's going to eat that?"
He continued to ramble, and Tony turned and took one last look at the introductory panel, at the photograph of the gorgeous young woman with what she could only presume was her whole life ahead of her, her doe-like eyes startling from the liner she'd applied and framed with feathery lashes done up in coats of mascara, her mouth parted in what she probably perceived to be a combination of enigmatic and sultry. Tony stared at her, and she stared right back at him, and he almost found that he couldn't tear his eyes away.
Captain America. Now, there was a hero! Cap could do anything — was the greatest man ever to walk the face of the earth. Tony was no better than the layer of filth on the bottom of Cap's boot — the one he used to crush Nazi and Hydra scum with back during the war. You should be more like him, Tony. Why can't you be more like him? Why? 'Cause you're not good enough, boy.
It was when Steve was finally able to sit down and enjoy his second slice of cake when Tony felt it again — the fluttering — and he gasped and dropped his fork and then, without preamble, grabbed Steve's hand and pressed it against his lower abdomen.
Tony closed up the sketchbook and handed it back to Steve, and Steve took it from him and dropped it onto the table in front of the couch then frowned and put his hands on Tony's shoulders.
Steve was up and alert. "Is it moving?" he asked, getting out of the chair before he'd even asked the question.
his body. This was him. Not the body he'd had for forty-three years, but still his body, however foreign some of it was, and he was still him. His husband still found him attractive. He was fertile, and he was desirable. He was right before when he'd said that sitting at home and crying about it wasn't going to do anything for him. It wasn't going to make this end any quicker, it wasn't going to make it better, and it wasn't going to make it so that it had never happened. But similar to accepting that Iron Man wasn't just the suit he wore to protect himself from the world but that Tony Stark himself was and would always be Iron Man, so, too, was this not just something to suffer through until he could get back to normal. He may have had the body of a woman, he may have been pregnant, but he was still Tony Stark, and nothing was ever going to change that.
"No one's selling tickets to anything," Steve said before Natasha could even begin to formulate an answer.
Steve crouched down on the other side of the box to take a look at it. "Four-in-one, huh?" he said, examining the colorful, advertised specs on the box. "A lot more convoluted than what they had in my day."
"We both did," Steve said, his gaze still locked with Tony's and a small, knowing smile on his face. Try as he might, Tony couldn't help but return it in kind.
"Whatever," he muttered and grabbed the remote and turned the TV on. "Hey, so, question," he said and flipped onto one of the news networks, "Steve and I still the news
Steve's still alive. It's crazy, all right? I know it's crazy but, we're soul mates, and I think I'd be the first one to know if Steve was, god forbid, dead. Well, second. Clearly, Steve would be the first one to know."
"Oh," he said brightly, happily, and maybe even a little too eagerly, "this should be fun." But Steve, that wonderful killjoy, just sighed and said a disappointed, "
To his surprise, Tony just smiled at him, his mouth quirking to the side in a sort of half-smirk. "I guess it's sort of a 'If lost, please return to…' kind of a thing."
He sucked in a breath and slapped his hands on his thighs then pushed himself to his feet, and he stood before Esmeralda, who smiled up and him and made to put her finger to her lips.
" he cried, sitting up fast — or as fast as he could, anyway. He had a way-too-big belly weighing him down. "
In lieu of making an actual doctor's appointment or anything like that — because…why would he? — he insisted on Bruce checking him and JARVIS running scans on him, which earned him nothing but the Sigh of Disapproval from Steve — replete with head-tip and hands-on-hips — but fuck it. He was
She gasped. "Language, Papa!" she said, but there was a teasing edge to it, and it was clearly something that was bandied about a great deal in the Stark-Rogers household.
keyboard medical doctors insisting there was something clearly neurologically wrong with her with one gaining overnight notoriety for claiming that Olivia was 'clearly retarded' and insisting that she bore an appearance to a 'mongoloid.'
Tony's eyes were on his screen, but Steve's eyes were on Tony, and his cock was standing at full attention and would no doubt embarrass him were anyone to walk in and see the sight he made at that very moment, and he swallowed and shifted his gaze to the table and said a somewhat shaky, "How, uh, how much longer do you think it's gonna be?"
But at the same time, the proud smile that stretched across his face — like he'd done it and he knew he'd done it and he'd used the finger quotes correctly — was too much for him to take, and he shook his head a little, a smile tugging at his mouth no matter how hard he fought it.
"Yes, it's OK," he said, "It's very OK," he said, his vision blurring a little, and Steve chuckled and reached up to brush his thumbs just under Tony's eyes.
Steve, evidently bored with Bruce's music history lesson, was at his elbow in an instant, concerned, ready to strike against whoever or whatever had offended him.
"Yes, Pep," he said and put a hand on his arms to calm her, "one hundred percent. I know what I'm doing. I've dealt with these people before. You already told the Board, right? I'm not going to get a dozen angry phone calls when this is all over, am I?"
"Like something that isn't like either one of those names. You really want to saddle your kid with a name like that? She'll forever be compared to her grandmothers, who I'm sure you both hold in high regard, and when she doesn't measure up to that— Stark, you know what that's like."
"Still," he continued, "I don't find it to be anywhere near as outlandish as some might think. I do recall that day when aliens poured out of the sky, after all."
Tony nodded at the sonogram picture that now sat on the table. "You might want to put that away before someone sees it."
Steve snorted a laugh and said, “Rendezvous in the living room in thirty seconds,” and stepped off the elevator onto the penthouse floor.
"Dunno." He directed his next statement to Olivia. "Maybe we should see about getting you some clothes, huh? And maybe some furniture to replace the stuff that, uh, disappeared."
"No, not really," he said and poured himself another splash. Tony made a face, but Steve shot him a pointed look and said, "I've swallowed your come before. Is this really any worse?"
Tony closed his eyes, stilling his hand atop Steve's head. "Yeah," he murmured opening his eyes but not looking at Steve.
Sam just grinned at him as he stepped onto the elevator, Bucky following right behind. "Oh, I had a feeling. So, how's that going with—"
"Not even close," Steve said with a roll of his eyes. He rested the baby on one shoulder then threw a cloth over his other shoulder. "Look, I just think we should try to watch ourselves now before we end up with a toddler that we can't let out in public because the only words she knows are four-letter words."
"Do whatever you wanted," Steve finished for him. "Go to a show. Go to a movie. Go to a diner. Crash a wedding."
"Yeah, I…" She looked back down at his abdomen but trailed off what she, for whatever reason, couldn't bring herself to say.
"You are bonded," he said, an almost awed innocence to his tone. "You should be delighted. You will get to experience that which no other bonded pair such as yourselves can ever know."
Then a visitor from another world had shown up and created some havoc, and Tony, who had been rejected from the Initiative anyway, as it turned out, but was asked to stay on as an advisor, was somehow pulled into the mess and found himself fighting alongside that group of rejects he'd previously wanted nothing to do with.
"Where's my stuff? Why's there a bed?" she asked and climbed up onto the bed. He almost snapped at her to get off if only because he didn't want any evidence of this for the Cap to find, but she was small, and it wasn't like she could do that much damage, so he let her stay and bounce up and down on the bed a bit as he looked around the room for the supplies he'd bought for the Cap a couple weeks before.
"Don't know what you're missing," Bruce said with a slight grin on his face, and to prove his point, he shoved another spoonful of the garbage into his mouth.
"I think he'd give you a better answer to that than I could. But thank you. For everything. JARVIS said you two were bonding a little?"
"I'm not sure one party once a year counts as adequate usage," he replied as Steve suddenly appeared, a box in his hands and a sheepish smile on his face.
But, of course, Steve didn't listen, and once he got clear of it, he made a dash for the gaping hole in the side of the building, disappearing into the smoke and flames. Tony cursed a blue streak that earned him a huge laugh from Barton, blasted a few more goons, and then blasted his way into the building (which…was stupid, but he was pissed at Steve for pulling this bullshit again, and better blast the building than Steve). He did a scan, wondered how that idiot was even surviving the heat and the smoke, and then found the two closer to the center of the building, beams creaking and glass shattering and destruction raining down all over them.
Stark whined even more, his eyes still squeezed shut, but Steve just grabbed him by his bound arms and pulled him away from the table, pushing him down to his knees. He took Stark by the chin and tilted his head up toward him, meeting Stark’s big, dark eyes lined with those feathery black lashes. His face was flushed, his eyes a little glassy as he looked up at Steve, his mouth parted slightly and just begging to be wrapped around Steve’s cock, and Steve brushed his thumb over his bottom lip again and assured him, “I don’t have a refractory period. I could do this all day.”
Steve. The one he loved. The one that supported him and stood by him and loved him and took care of him and yelled at him and nagged at him and annoyed the shit out of him sometimes. Esmeralda might have given him the body, but everything else had been Steve. This was Steve's mark on him. This was Steve's child. This was Steve's claim on him because he wanted Tony, desired Tony, and wanted to show the world that Tony belonged to him and to no one else.
"Um...well, I wouldn't hold your breath, as your kind likes to say, but I wouldn't get too comfortable, if I were you."
"I can only imagine," he muttered then turned back to his daughter. "No, I don't have amnesia, but, uh, just tell me what you know about it."
But it was like Darcy wasn't even listening to her. She just looked at Tony and said, "So, orgasms. Which one's better? I mean is it better as a lady or a dude?"
But there was more to it than that. They had fun needling each other and challenging each other, and Tony liked to show off and Steve liked to be showed-off to. Tony liked food, and Steve liked to eat, so Tony would take him to whatever high-end eatery or greasy spoon was attracting his gullet that day, sometimes even settling for those damned hot dog carts, and he really didn't want to know what was in those, but, god help him, sometimes those damned things hit the spot.
Tony frowned and tilted his head in consideration a moment before he remembered the way Natasha had…been kind of groping him, and he sat up and met Steve's gaze before he straddled Steve's lap, putting his hands on his shoulders, and said, "I just…" He twitched his mouth from side-to-side and said, "I just… Just touch me."
Tony ignored him and kept his attention on the kid. "Wait, I told you not to play with Cap's stuff?"
He made his way down the steps, the living area seemingly untouched, which meant Steve still hadn't shown his face, and Tony frowned and looked around and said, "J, is Steve
Tony honestly wasn't sure how to characterize Barnes' reaction when he told him that. Relief, he supposed, but tinged with something like remorse or maybe even regret — like maybe he didn't deserve it.
They went quiet, the sound of the song filling the expanse once again, and Steve found that with the rest of Tony's body so close to his that it was silly to have their hands so far away. Tony's hand still in his, he pulled it against his chest, tight, firm, and OK, maybe just the slightest bit protective or possessive or maybe a combination of the two. Tony glanced at him in surprise, and he froze and waited for the genius to pull away from him and say, "Whoa, Cap, what do you think you're doing here?" but Tony's gaze went from his eyes down to his mouth, and Steve watched in confusion as Tony reached up the slightest bit and pressed his cheek against Steve's. Steve startled at that — that was not what he'd been expecting — but as the song shifted into another verse, he adjusted his arms just the slightest bit so that he was holding Tony as close as he could, his hand spayed wide and firm over the small of Tony's back, and rubbed his cheek against Tony's, the two settling into a rather intimate embrace. He didn't know what Tony's aim was here — maybe Tony was just playing along and showing him what he could expect the next time he did this with someone else — but he decided to take what he could from it. He closed his eyes, breathed in Tony's scent, and pretended, if just for a moment, that this wasn't only make believe, that Tony was his, that he was Tony's, that Tony felt for him even half of what he felt for Tony.
Tony shrugged and snuggled back against the pillows, cuddling his baby closer and pulling the duvet up a little more to cover them both. "If the shoe fits," he said, not bothering to correct Barnes on Steve's current state of being because he didn't need another lecture from Bruce.
"Eh," he said and snipped one connection to rewire it to another, "still think of myself as one. I guess. I don't— I'm not really sure— I mean I guess—"
"Papa?" the voice whispered again, and Tony groaned and stretched a little, grimacing as a pain throbbed in his back.
Steve turned to him, grabbing a tight, white undershirt and pulling it over his head. He nodded at Tony's ensemble and said, "Wouldn't want to mess up that nice, new dress."
Steve turned, wide-eyed as though he'd been caught doing something he shouldn't have. He tried to cover it up and harden his face to blank passivity, but the damage had been done. Tony, standing beside him with two steaming cups of coffee in his hands, frowned and said, "What's wrong?"
Steve looked around, and when he couldn't give Tony the answer straightaway, Tony huffed and shoved his bag at him and said, "Whatever. Watch my stuff. I'll be right back."
"Seriously," Tony said and looked around at the other three. "Why do you people spend so much time here?"
The little girl in the crib started to whine, and just as he was about to make a move to go to her, a voice behind him said, "Oh, no, you don't. I'll take care of the munchkin. You go brush your teeth. I absolutely refuse to give you your real Christmas kiss until you brush your teeth."
"Don't worry, doll-baby. Daddy's fine," he said, pulling her hands away from his bloodied and bruised face. Tony only noticed then that his uniform was more disheveled than he'd seen on first glance, torn and bloodied in a few places — and was his shield magnetized to his back or something?
It took a pathetically long time to get to the top, but once he had, he sucked in a breath and pushed through the pain and ache that begged him to just relax and let the other ones handle it to go over to the bedroom. The bed looked so, so inviting, but he simply set Olivia down in her bassinette and gave her a pacifier to tide her over. She looked so cute with her eyes closed and her hands fisted as she suckled the pacifier, and Tony almost got caught up with standing there and just watching her slumber, her tiny chest rising and falling, her feathery little eyelashes fluttering as she got caught up in REM sleep—
"Oh, yeah," Rhodey said as he evidently watched him glare at the small bit of porcelain, "I asked them to give you decaf."
"You know," Tony said as Steve led him over to the elevator, ducking out of the way of curious onlookers and bloggers that had escaped to post their world-exclusives, "we really should stick around to answer for ourselves."
"I know it is, and it's just…really tough to take after two solid years of it. Not that I or any of the others don't want anything but the best for you two, but isn't the honeymoon over yet?"
God, he was a mess! He was as slick as he'd been the previous night when he and Steve had done their little play-act, and he was certain some of it had already gotten on the bed sheets. He pushed his head back against the pillow and bit his other fist as he tried to keep his moans to himself. He needed a dildo or something. A vibrator. He couldn't get his hand at the right angle to tend to his vagina and his clit at the same time. Goddamn it, why'd he have to be so fucking
"Shove over," he muttered, setting his coffee down before he pushed in between Wilson and Natasha. "Might as well get some of this before you people devour it all."
Steve leaned forward and put his hands on Tony's shoulders, kneading his fingers in gently. "Tony, honey, listen to yourself. Think about what you're really saying. It's… I know it all sounds great in theory, but in practice, it's… You're talking about having a baby, Tony. You, an adult, human male. And not just that but a superhero. An Avenger. You really think bringing a child into this is such a good idea? They'd have a target painted on their back from day one."
"Yeah, she claims she's tied up my life with this clump of cells in my abdomen, and while I'm sort of 50-50 on whether or not she's full of shit, Thor's convinced she's telling the truth based on the whole past-is-precedent deal, and my wonderful, darling fiancé, the father of my child, light of my life, has no desire to chance finding out because, if I'm reading Natasha's recent cryptic words correctly, I'm like the main thing in the future that's keeping him from chucking it all in and throwing himself in front of a semi — which would probably only dent the truck and barely leave a scratch on him. Seriously, he fell out of a flaming Helicarrier into the Potomac and lived. I'm not sure anything's ever going to kill that man."
Barton stared at him a moment then said, "Whatever," and motioned to Barnes. "Come on, I'll show you where the weights are."
. Bruce said something about something strange happening while Natasha and Clint and I were gone but you had it under control and it was nothing to worry about. I just assumed there was an incident with the Hulk or something."
"According to her, my life is tied up in the life of this clump of cells growing in my abdomen. The clump of cells lives, I live; the clump of cells dies, I—"
She harrumphed a little and scowled at him. "Ah, yes, that oh-so-wonderful dry sense of humor of yours. I'd almost forgotten about it."
"You… You're related to him, aren't you?" Steve could have smacked himself for the waver in his voice.
It wasn't that he didn't trust Steve; he did. But he knew the risks, and he ran the variables, and while Steve worried about his teammates and urged them not to take any unnecessary risks, he was lax with his own safety to the point that every single person on the team as well as Wilson had called him out on his ridiculous hypocrisy. And what did Steve do when confronted with it?
Steve took a sip of his chocolate and went into the room. He stared at the TV a moment and watched sharp, colorful images flash before his eyes then stepped around the couch and began to scope out the room.
But Steve ignored him and continued trying to talk some…sense, he supposed he'd call it…into Barnes, and Barnes frowned a little and blinked at Steve, and he opened his mouth like he was about to say something — something that would indicate that he remembered — when Tony heard the unmistakable creak and groan of destabilizing metal, and he glanced up just in time to see a gigantic girder come crashing down toward him.
"Uh...no," he said but wouldn't look Tony in the eye, and Tony leaned to the side somewhat like he was trying to meet Steve's line of sight.
He shoved the other half of the doughnut in his mouth and chewed while Steve pulled out the container of orange juice and poured a glass for both himself and Tony. He held one out to Tony, and Tony took it, unthinking, as he chewed and stared at the piece of paper on the door of the fridge.
Steve stared into Thor's earnest expression a moment before he sighed and shook his head and said, "Don't listen to what Clint or Buck or any of them have been saying. There's no such thing as the Justice League outside of the comics."
Rhodey's approval, and not that he'd ever really doubted that he'd had it — Rhodey had no problem telling him when he thought he'd gotten mixed up with someone that was just using him for his name or his money — but it did mean a lot to him to know his oldest friend  approved.
"Yeah," he said and took his bag back. He dug through for his phone and pulled it out. "Just had to pee, like I seem to have to do
"Oh, shit, my hand seems to be caught on his sleeve," Barnes said, holding onto Wilson's arm and letting himself be dragged away.
Tony rolled his eyes as Steve then began to pull up the name and information on his tablet. "Look at you switching from one piece of tech to another."
more," he explained as Steve followed him out of the kitchen and into the living room. "I mean, they're both awesome in their own ways, but, yeah…"
"Well, clearly aliens aren't the only things that come out of wormholes," he said and got up from his seat, deliberately pushing the idea of a wormhole to the back of his mind. "Evidently, future or alternate universe children also fall out of them, too. Probably alternate universe."
"You know I don't like when you throw your money around like that," he said then threw a glance over his left shoulder at the offending implement that was just closing with a gentle swing. "Actually, in this case, it might have been a good idea," he added and turned back to Tony, "but I still don't like when you throw your money around like that. On principle."
When the day of the festivities arrived, Tony woke up bright and early (OK, early for Tony, seeing as his bed was already empty) then woke up his cranky little helper elves and plied them with coffee and French toast so as to make them more amenable to helping him make over the common floor into something that would make Uncle Sam blush — balloons and streamers and those really gaudy decorations that sparkled way too damned much. There was assorted grumbling to be had that ended quite quickly as they stuffed themselves with Tony's version of Jarvis's French toast, and after cleaning up, Tony was able to get most of them to follow him down to the common room to set about making the room into a tacky love song to America (and Steve).
But here they all were, and Bruce and Natasha and Clint were in the kitchen cooking up some sort of feast, and when Steve surmised what they were up to — a sort of 'rehearsal dinner' for the happy couple — he said, "You really don't have to do this for us," but Clint just said, "Hey, you only get married for the first time once," as he tore up lettuce for a salad.
Steve just flattened his mouth and moved to hide his obvious arousal behind the island counter- top.
"Papa?" a little voice asked from behind him, but he ignored it as he squeezed his eyes shut and tried to focus on breathing.
"Oh, is he complaining about the wrapping paper again?" Tony asked as he came back into the living area, balancing a large tray of coffee mugs and a plate of cookies in his grasp. He went to set the tray on the coffee table when he saw Mjölnir stationed right in the middle of it, and he scowled and nodded at it and said, "Hey, you mind moving that pointless paperweight?"
"Totally up to you," Tony said while Steve stood there and seemingly weighed the pros and cons of what Tony was proposing. "We haven't done this in months, and— To be honest, I wasn't sure it would even be something you would want to do with me like this. Not saying we have to; just saying that if you want to, I am a thousand percent open to it."
"I don't know," Steve said and gave Tony a sideways glance. "I'm pretty sure this is something only you could come up with."
Unless you're looking to hit up the clubs, in which case you're probably better off having either Goldilocks or Asshole Barton show you the moves, though I don't doubt for one second that they could both get you to embarrass yourself in five seconds flat."
Steve nodded but said nothing, and the clerk finally made his appearance from a back room and stood beside the deputy that was refusing to grant their marriage license. She motioned to Steve and said, "Steve Rogers," then nodded at Tony and added, "Tony Stark."
Poor Steve still didn't seem to understand Wilson's need to read an outdated bio littered with purple prose.
They were the last two on the car by the time the elevator arrived at their desired floor. Steve stepped off the moment the doors opened and then stood there and held the door for Tony, who pursed his lips and frowned at the quiet hallway before him and said, "How 'bout we don't and say we did?"
Steve sighed out a breath, and Olivia slapped her hands on the tabletop and babbled incoherent sounds. "You know," he said above his daughter's babbles, "I really don't understand where this idea of me being 'squeaky clean' came from. I'm not—"
Tony snorted in derision as he glanced at some of the papers Steve had spread over the coffee table — lecture notes for his class — and he just said, "You keep telling yourself that, babe," with all the humor and levity in his voice that Steve knew he didn't deserve.
Barnes dropped his arms, and he ran his flesh hand through his hair and shook his head one more time then said, "I can't believe that— Does he really think—?" He groaned and shook his head and looked point-blank at Tony. "You want to know the truth? You want to know what it— I don't
He just shook his head and turned to glance at some flashing, lighted display across the way, not even bothering to pay attention to Tony, who had wedged himself into Steve's side and was taking more pictures with his camera. Allegedly. He also didn't even think about the fact that the arm that he'd draped over the back of the bench had somehow migrated to Tony's shoulders, not until he felt the rough texture of wool under the palm of his hand as he unthinkingly rubbed at Tony's shoulder.
"I don't know. Side of the highway in some godforsaken part of the state up by the Finger Lakes. There was a former SHIELD safe-house—"
Tony swallowed down to tears of love and gratitude that were threatening to surface and said, "Hey, I might have lost a lot of things when I pushed your ten-pound child out of me in front of Bruce and Natasha and Barnes—"
Tony went to pick the glass up to take a sip, but he blinked and looked up at the ceiling at the last second. "Wait. Are you saying what I think you're saying?"
Tony shook his head. "God, that would be equal parts awful and unbearable. But, it doesn't matter. We figured it out, we worked it out, and I think we're doing OK." He glanced down at himself then met Steve's gaze again. "Forced sex changes aside."
Steve just shot him a look, but Tony could tell from the lightness in his eyes that Tony's lame attempts at comfort and distraction were not just appreciated but had worked a little bit as well.
Steve smiled a little, thin and somewhat bemused but with a hint of pain behind it. "Well, luckily, there was a war going on, so that helped as a distraction. But there were… You had ways of dealing with it."
Steve flushed a little, like he'd been caught out. "I don't— It wasn't—" He shook his head. "I don't want to talk about it."
"Oh!" Tony said, suddenly going animated. "Remember a while back Steve talked about having some dream where he spent a day in the future?"
only temporary, right? I mean, these sorts of experiences are only good for, like, a day or so, right?"
"Early Pink Floyd," Tony said. "Before they started recording stuff people actually wanted to listen to."
As he stood up, his back popping rather painfully, he only half-realized that he'd oh-so-breezily referred to himself as 'Papa' and had begun treating this situation as completely normal — like he really
The lecher made like he hadn't realized he'd been causing him any problem and said, "Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to get in your way."
Ten years King Anthony had ruled over these lands, having been anointed as such at the age of seventeen after the death of his father, King Howard. He was as good, if not better, a king as his father had been, and peace and prosperity had reigned over the lands for a now unbroken line of thirty-eight years combined between the rules of father and son.
Tony stared into his cerulean eyes, and knowing he wasn't getting out of this, he frowned a little and said, "And you'll be right here the entire time?"
"I see," she said again and nodded just a little. "That which has allowed you to join with your bondmate also curses you."
"Whatever," he said and shook his head some, "the point is...I — I can't stop— I can't give this up. I have no right to give this up."
"That, admittedly, bears a striking resemblance to what they know to be Tony Stark," he said and folded his arms, nestling them just under his breasts, "and, really, it's their own fault for not bothering to ask the real question which is
Of course he would think it was something with the baby. Of course he wouldn't think it had anything to do with Tony's jealousies or the fact that Steve had gladly invited a deadly assassin into their midst — had spent the entire afternoon with said deadly assassin and hadn't even thought to check on him in the interim. Why would he ever give consideration to Tony when
to deal with, not me," he said and moved over to another work table. "I know my abilities, Steve. I know what I'm capable of. I know what I can do. I'm not some precious little flower you can just stick under a bell jar."
He wanted to keep the baby. He wanted to have the baby. He wanted to be a parent, with or without Steve's help. And Steve...
him— I mean, not literally, but just looking for a good time? Yeah, I've been there. I know what it's like. You weren't looking to waste your time on anything or anyone that wasn't going to be in it for the long haul with you. And, sweetheart, I love you to pieces, but you're not a flirt — not a good one. You're a little too… blunt and a little too polite and chivalrous. You're too…
do? Ask me what I'm crying about. I tell him. He says, 'Well, you wanted to know! What was I supposed to do? Lie to you?'"
Tony sighed and hung his head a moment. "OK, look, Steve?" He looked back up at him. "I know you're all about the whole self-sacrificing, taking responsibility for everyone kind-of-a- thing, but honestly, this is one situation where I could really do without your self-pity. Yeah, you feel like shit for this. Yeah, you blame yourself for it. Fucking fantastic. But guess what? All that blame isn't going to mean shit for figuring out a way to put this right. So, feel like shit. Blame yourself. Go for it. But I fucking need you to be in my corner with this. I'm terrified, Steve. I'm fucking terrified here. Banner's telling me my body can't handle it, and Thor's telling me this is part of some spell put on me by a nutjob that thinks you and I are 'soulmates' and need a baby to complete us like some thirteen-year-old's first fanfic. I don't want to admit it, but I can feel my body changing, and it's scaring the hell out of me. This is not supposed to happen. This is supposed to be biologically impossible. And yet here we are, and I'm fucking pregnant, Steve, and there is no way to fix it that does not involve some sort of high risk."
Steve just nodded and fumbled for something to do with his hands before he settled on clasping them behind his back, and he stood there awkwardly and struggled for something to say until Tony said, "Shall we?"
"Should know exactly what kind of pervert you are." He made a couple more disgusted sounds then said, "I'm going to get you back for that. You know that, right?"
"That's not what I mean," Steve said, tilting his head forward a little as though to look at him from over a pair of glasses. "I don't— I just— I'm not taking that chance. Baby showers are— You're just asking for trouble with one."
"Yes," Steve said with a laugh. "Are you crazy? I've..." He grimaced a little and reached up to rub the back of his neck. "Honestly, I've kind of been hoping for a while now you'd feel that way."
Other Tony dropped his face into his hand and shook his head a little, but Tracy continued to stare at him expectantly, reminding him a little of a more well-intentioned Darcy with her questions, and Tony paused a moment, trying to think of what he could say that wasn't going to be splashed all over the tabloids the moment he left the shop.
Without another word, he let himself out of the workshop and headed in the direction of the elevator, and Steve rolled his eyes and went to follow until he felt a sudden chill hit his body, and he looked down at his naked self, the towel having slipped to the ground during the course of his conversation with Tony. He reached down to pick it up, and he thought about just tossing it on the table and going it
by you. He's watching out for you, taking care of you, and he's probably read more about pregnancy in the past couple months than you have in your entire life."
"So, wait," Barton said and stepped closer to peer at the monitor. "Does that technically make Stark a hermaphrodite?"
Tony, hand still on his back, motioned toward Bruce, who, done talking with Steve, was making his way down the loading ramp. Steve, blind to the fact that Tony had shown up in the hangar, pushed into the 'jet and disappeared from view. "Came to annoy Brucie."
"I know," Tony said and sighed a little as he set the box on the counter. "But maybe stick to what you're best at."
Other Tony nodded some. "You could say that," he said, slowly, like there was more than one meaning behind it.
Tony looked up and met her gaze, and she smiled softly at him, genuine affection shining in her green eyes. Against his wishes — goddamned fucking hormones — he began to tear up, and Natasha went over and pulled him into a hug, shushing him, murmuring soothing words in Russian, then said, "We're your family, Stark, whether you like it or not."
Anyway, so Steve was a good artist, even if Tony got the feeling he was sometimes a little… unsure of his own abilities, and Steve, when it came down to it, really had no problem showing Tony whatever it was he was working on.
"Hey, uh," Bucky said as he arrived back at the security station, "look, you don't want people to know that you're Tony Stark's 'Steve'—" he used finger quotes on the name 'Steve,' "—maybe you don't make out with him in the middle of the hallway."
Tony made a face. "No, don't call them 'speakers.' That sounds so… Call them 'auditory feedback relays.'"
Tony just laughed and stood up. "Nothing," he said and went up on his toes again to peck a kiss against Steve's mouth. "Absolutely nothing, you pathetic, old sap."
"Yeah, well, you have to learn someday," Tony said and motioned at him to finish frying up the hash browns. "Come on. We got hungry customers here."
Nat settled herself into another armchair, and Bucky eyed the cushion between Thor and Jim, but Steve got up and said, "Here, you can have my seat."
"I believe your bonded was the one that impregnated you, not me," Esmeralda muttered, and Tony opened his eyes and glared at her.
"Where are you taking me?" he asked after a moment of silence punctuated only by the 'music' playing at a low level and the quiet babbling coming from the back seat.
Seemingly satisfied, Steve left the bandstand and rejoined Tony, smiling a little sheepishly like he was proud of what he'd done but at the same time nervous.
He stared at her a moment then said, "You exaggerate a lot for someone with so little life experience."
"Are you fucking kidding me?" he muttered, and Steve, his curiosity (among other things) aroused, couldn't help but watch as he worked at finding some way of comfortably folding his arms, hesitating at each instance where he knew it would be a failing prospect, before he finally seemed to settle on folding his arms beneath his breasts and pushing them up to all but cradle and nestle them in the fold of his arms. The motion pushed them up and together, and Steve, for the first time in his life, finally, truly understood the term 'heaving bosoms.'
Palming the gold band for the moment, he glanced over the dresser and picked up the diamond and sapphire band threaded on a thin, silver chain. He held it by the chain so that the ring dangled and caught in the daylight, and he held it over his palm that held the gold band and slackened his hold on the chain, letting the band slide down into his palm where it clanked with the plain gold one. He set the chain on the dresser and stared at the rings in his palm — rings that symbolized so much about himself and his relationship with the man that had given him reason to wear them — and he picked up the diamond and sapphire band and attempted to slide it onto his left pinky, the only finger it might fit. It went down as far as his middle knuckle and wouldn't budge any further, and not wanting to get it stuck on his finger, he scowled a little and pulled it off, holding it between his thumb and forefinger. He turned his hand a couple times to look at it, and he brought it up to his lips and kissed it before he set it in the box he'd pulled his other band from. He loved it and was not ashamed to wear it — there was no rule or law that said he couldn't put it back on the chain and wear it around his neck until the end of time — but was an heirloom now, he decided, something that could be passed to his daughter when she became old enough to appreciate it.
"You want to draw me like one of your French girls?" Tony said, a somewhat amused smile on his lips.
The guy stopped cold, and he pulled back a little and directed his gaze down to Tony's crotch, like he was perhaps trying to see the outline of hidden junk. But Tony just grinned and said, "It's called 'tucking,' big boy. So, do you want to be in the middle? I know how to treat my bottoms
Steve just nodded his understanding then said, "Never had Chinese for Christmas dinner before." Tony hummed in thought and said, "Well, you're not Jewish."
"Yeah, I'm gonna go see if Wilson and Barnes have murdered each other yet," Barton murmured and presumably turned tail, leaving the kitchen at what sounded like breakneck speed.
She shrugged yet again and took a sip of her drink, and Steve scowled and said, "I don't like it. He had to know the team was going to be here—"
Steve carried the bags through to the living room, and Tony followed then watched as Steve switched on every light and went through every single room in the house. It was all on one level, and there were what appeared to be only the two entrances along with a couple of reinforced windows. No television that he could see, and he very much doubted there was any Wi-Fi to be had.
Tony knew he'd got him there. Steve had asked him to go. Steve had wanted him to go. Steve had no one to blame for this whole thing but himself.
"Hey, don't complain," Bucky said and pushed into the room, Sam right behind him. "We come bearing presents for your little tax deduction."
Steve twisted a bemused smile at Tony but couldn't find it in him to argue against what Wilson was saying. He didn't have the experience to know whether or not he — or future him — and Tony were 'codependent' on each other, but from what he'd been able to glean, it wasn't an unfair assumption to make. At least, if 'codependent' meant what he figured it meant.
Oh, god. Wait— No. No, that wasn't possible, right? Steve wouldn't make some crazy pact with some religious cult just so he could get Bucky back, right? And he sure as fuck wouldn't stick
"Ready as I'll ever be, I guess. I mean, I've been doing this shit my entire life. You think I'd be used to it."
He put a hand up to quiet him. "Yeah, I said I wanted to get my hands on it. But that doesn't mean I'll be able to… Oh, who am I kidding? I can
had to polish his shoes— And wait, you people all left, like, a good half-hour before us. Why does it seem like you're just arriving?"
"Where do you want me—?" he tried to ask, but Tony just pointed to the worktable and mumbled something about that being good enough.
Thor frowned harder. "I do not believe your fellow Midgardian brethren would willingly submit themselves to—"
Tony exhaled a heavy breath. "Don't know. If it's any consolation, you've aged a bit in the time I've known you. You won't be young forever."
still think of himself as a man, and he understood he was currently in possession of a woman's body, but it was... It was getting harder and harder to find where the male part of him ended and the female part of him began. The line of demarcation was not as clearly delineated now as it had been a month or so earlier.
Steve rolled his eyes and scrambled up from his hiding spot. "Look, just cover me until he leaves, all right? He doesn't…he doesn't need to know."
"Oh!" he said like he'd just remembered something. "I had lunch with Ty Stone a couple weeks ago," he said, and Tony sucked in a breath, something funny and slightly painful hitting him square in the chest at the mention of that name.
for his suit in his body. He could take a fucking syringe that was…filling up rather rapidly with his blood now that Bruce had removed the band from his arm. He glanced over at the line of tubes that had yet to be filled, and he looked back at Bruce again and said, "Seriously, how much blood do you plan on draining from me?"
"Smart man," Tony said and leaned into to press a kiss against Steve's mouth. Steve returned the kiss in kind, and he fell back against the pillows, Tony atop him. They kissed languidly for some time, slow, teasing, small nips and laughs, Tony straddling Steve's waist as they ran their hands over each other's bodies, and when the teases and giggles had turned to something more salacious and serious, Tony pulled back enough to look Steve in the eyes and murmured a husky, "Make love to me, Captain."
and sometimes I just... Sometimes I just feel a little too old for you, all right? Are you happy now?"
but, if his hunch was right and this was the real deal, he wanted it to be a genuine surprise for Steve.
Tony nodded and turned to leave again, and Bruce called out, "You know, it's OK to be excited about this."
Tony shrugged, glancing away from her. "Not too difficult to do. Brucie wants me on complete bed rest after the, and I quote,
"Tony, I don't think this is such a good idea," Steve murmured as Tony carefully swabbed the inside of his infant daughter's mouth. "What if it—"
It was as he was exiting the restroom when some Long Island Lothario sidled up alongside him, drink in hand, hair a little too slicked, and wearing way too much cologne. He tweaked a smile and tried to step to the side of him, but the guy just stepped to the same side with a grin. Tony forced another smile then tried to step to the other side only to be blocked by the lecher yet again. Jesus Christ,
"Cute," Steve muttered but still picked up the sheet of decorated cookies and went over to the oven.
. Being changed back sounded so…permanent. Sure, he wanted to go back to being the man that he was, he supposed, but at the same time, he didn't want to lose
He walked in, the lights coming up immediately, and looked over what was little more than a utilitarian affair with a desk, a chair, a bookshelf, and a filing cabinet. He thought for a moment what it might look like with a different colored wall — Olivia seemed like a girly-girl, so probably pink or purple — and a little canopy-topped bed with a pastel colored bedspread — or maybe whatever cartoon characters were popular at the moment — and stuffed animals and dolls.
Steve snorted a laugh. "Yeah, sure you do," he said and had just turned his head to press another kiss against Tony's forehead when a knock came to the door and Doctor Ganford walked in, again all comforting smiles but with tablet in hand.
"An antique?" Tony finished for her. "Yes. I'm not even sure the term 'sexual harassment' existed in his day — you know, back when it was totes cool to give your secretary a slap on the ass or beg sexual favors in exchange for climbing up the ladder."
They stood there in Bruce's lab for several quiet moments before Bruce seemed to sum up the courage to speak.
"Nah, Nat—" He stopped short at Tony's pointed look. "Yeah, I don't know which one of you plays favorites more: those two or you two."
Tony rolled his eyes in an exaggerated motion. "Again, the mood whiplash with you is mind-boggling. It's a television."
"Look, we don't know where she actually comes from. For all we know, she was purposely sent here. Maybe where she comes from is terrible—"
It wasn't that he was scared to be left alone with Barnes — OK, maybe the idea put him a little on edge — but he didn't know him, well, at all, and he would have felt a little better maybe to have Steve there to somehow keep the peace between them. Tony was good at running his mouth, but he really did hate small talk — any kind, awkward or not — and he wasn't looking forward to making small talk with his husband's oldest friend that, up until almost a year ago, had been a brainwashed  assassin.
Before he knew it, Steve had scooped him up again and tossed him down onto the bed, flat on his back as Steve braced himself over top of him, spreading Tony's legs apart with his knee and rutting against him as he sucked at his neck.
." They wouldn't necessarily have to use the word 'alive' but maybe something that indicated that he was alive. Something about how pissed he was or how disappointed he was or maybe — just maybe — how worried he was about Tony. Just something so that they knew their Cap was still alive and kicking and kicking ass.
" Tony just closed his eyes and settled back down against Steve, his head pillowed against Steve's broad, muscled pecs, and he exhaled a breath and snuggled closer to Steve, putting his arm over Steve's waist as Steve felt him drift off again.
Steve arched his eyebrow even higher if that was possible, his lips twisting in slight annoyance. "You know, you make it sound like I'm no fun to be around."
Tony turned his attention to Bruce, who laughed and said, "Thanks, but I'd kind of get the suspicion I wasn't the one you wanted in your arms."
But he just waved her off and said, "Whatever. I know. I'm just ridiculously sensitive and have been for the last, I don't know, couple weeks."
"Well," he said and exhaled a breath, "I am preparing our daughter's dinner. Seeing as my body doesn't make the stuff anymore, I gotta get some outside help, and JARVIS, for whatever reason, though powdered shit would be better than the ready-to-eat stuff, and so I had to — according to the directions — boil water and let it cool and then pour it into a bottle that I have also had to sterilize with boiling water and dump some of this delicious powdered stuff in and then mix it up then test it then feed it to our child, who has been very good about not getting her dinner at her usual time."
"Thor," Steve said, ceasing his struggles and trying again for more 'Captain America' than 'Steve Rogers,' "I'm ordering you to put me down."
Tony snorted a laugh and sat down with her. "You think I do? Four days ago, I was happy as a clam. Well, not really. I was kind of feeling like shit. Which, incidentally, is how this whole thing started. I was feeling like shit, and I asked Bruce to run some tests for me—"
Tony narrowed his eyes some, as though he was weighing how to answer the question. Finally, he nodded just a smidge and said a somewhat enigmatic, "Yes."
Tony melted into the touch, closing his eyes and relaxing as Steve nipped and sucked at the skin where his neck met his shoulder, one hand resting at his side while the other was firm against his back. Years ago, he might have stiffened at the very idea of belonging to someone — of being just a plaything or a possession — but it was different with Steve. It was always different with Steve. He didn't just feel like a possession with Steve or a plaything or someone to just build things or buy things or do things for Steve. Steve had a possessive streak a mile wide, sure, but Steve took very good care of those things that were his, the product, he was sure, of having grown up with scant few things to call his own. Steve was a slob with material things, but with the things that counted — the people and the family and friends he'd come to rely on these past couple years — Steve was nothing if not careful with them, understanding them to be fragile and able to be taken away from him in the blink of an eye. Steve did not put his faith or his trust in people easily — especially not after that whole thing with Hydra and the government — but Tony knew that once he did, it was very difficult to break that. Steve was loyal and dependable, and sure, perhaps a little too stubborn or self-righteous for his own good, but it was a stubbornness and a self- righteousness that Tony knew he could live with.
As against the measure as he might have been at the beginning, Tony knew Steve wanted this baby. He wanted a son. He wanted a
He glanced down at the baby the was resting somewhat contentedly in Tony's arms then added, "I mean, I guess she's gotten a little better looking since then."
, and Tony braced himself for some kind of surprise party they would throw for him behind Steve's back. Somehow. Because it was hard to do anything without Steve knowing about it — if he didn't snoop himself then
But Steve, conveniently, had seemingly passed out, his eyes closed and his mouth open and slack. Tony pursed his lips and reached out to poke him in the pectoral, petulant and annoyed, and Natasha reached out and pulled his hand away and said, "Go sit down, Stark."
He glanced back in time to see Bruce's face contort into a look of utter and abject confusion before he shook his head and said, "The flirting."
He ignored the 'stupidly' part and said, "Yeah, because Agent was a good company man, but he evidently sucked at cover stories. A body guard, Steve. He wanted me to say Iron Man was a
"We're not back to that, are we?" Steve mused. "Yes, Tony, I love you. And I'm proud of you and amazed by you and don't ever want to imagine my life without you."
Steve just nodded and sat up, yawning and scratching his chest in the dim light of early dawn. He settled and watched Tony a moment then said, "It really doesn't hurt?"
Tony glanced down and looked at the little sourpatch, lips pursed, eyes narrowed, a furrow formed between her brows. It was less a look of petulance and more a look of displeasure and disappointment, like Rhodey had made a choice she was thoroughly unimpressed with and did not approve of.
Steve, eyes still on the collar, moistened his lips, and he looked up and met Tony's gaze, something hard and predatory almost coming into his eyes. Tony hadn't seen that look in a long time, and it made a shiver run down his spine and something clench in that region he still hadn't figured out a better term than 'pussy' for.
"Yeah?" he muttered, surprising himself by the amount of desperate want he had to feel that again. He didn't know why. It wasn't something he should… He wasn't supposed to want this. "When?"
"Of course you don't," she muttered without looking at him. "For a self-described artist, you're the most uncreative being I've ever come across."
"I don't think you have the high ground on that one, Tony," Bruce said and reached around Tony to swipe at things on the screen. "Didn't that happen in a SHIELD conference room?"
too easily. Me telling you I don't want to take you out for breakfast because I don't want those vultures from the press descending on you and trying to make this out to be something worse than it actually is should have been good for at
"Look, not that I think in this day and age you absolutely need to get married before your kid's born, but maybe there's more of my mother's traditions ingrained in me than I want to admit, and before anything else fucking screwy happens to us, because, seriously, we're Avengers. It's in the job description. But before anything else screwy happens, I just want a document that says Steve and I are married, everything's legal, I can put him in my will as my husband, and our kid won't be born a bastard."
"OK, take me out of the equation. Pretend I don't exist. You never met me. Howard never had a kid. If given the chance, would you go back?"
He cut off abruptly, and Steve tried to meet Tony's eyes to ask him to finish his thought, but Tony was too busy pressing his thumbs against the screen as though he was typing something onto it.
"I wish I could go back and see the Dodgers play one last time," Steve said wistfully. "That's the only thing I'd like to go back and see."
Tony waved off his concern. "Steve doesn't get lost. And even if he did, he'd never admit it. He's just trying to find a parking space because parking is a bitch in SoHo and he couldn't parallel park if his life depended on it."
Steve hesitated only a moment before the sight of Tony, laid out and loose before him made his cock twitch in anticipation, and he lined himself up and said, "Ready?"
"No…jus' a…" he tried to get out, and he didn't even wince as the woman that had just been taunting him gasped, her eyes gone wide as shock spread over her face. She groaned out a breath and, like in a slow-moving dream, he watched her crumble to the floor. He stared at her for a moment longer than he probably should have before he picked his gaze up again and looked into the not-too-far distance to see Bucky Barnes — or maybe it was the Winter Soldier — taking aim right at him.
She advanced on him slowly but didn't drop her arms. "Doesn't look like it's nothing. You just said he could be dead in a ditch for all you cared. That's quite a change in attitude since Friday."
"Just for you, babe," he said. "Come on. I've gotta get this suit on the 'jet so I can power it down and go get ready."
Tony just stared back at him, his brow furrowed like he just wasn’t sure what to make of Steve’s words, and Steve reached up and cupped Tony’s face in his hands and kissed his forehead and then his eyes followed by his nose and his cheeks and finally his lips. He brushed his thumbs against Tony’s cheekbones, and Tony stood there staring at him for a moment before he said an unsure, “You’re welcome?”
Barnes sucked in an uncomfortable breath at that but said nothing, and Steve said, "Can we presume they're not done?"
"Mmm...I'll keep that in mind," Tony practically purred as he melted into Steve's embrace, and Steve gladly held him there, tightening his arms and running his hands over Tony's back.
Bucky burst out laughing, and Sam shook his head and said, "You're an ass, man," and Steve frowned between them and said, "He's not coming, is he?"
"Starting to feel a little better?" Steve mused quietly and went a little faster and a little firmer with his strokes.
"Why?" he asked and cut a sausage link in half and shoved part of it in his mouth. "Can't talk back," he said around the bite of food.
Steve just looked between Barnes and Wilson then shook his head, and Wilson turned and called out, "Yo! Rhodes!"
"Sorry, Rhodes," Bruce said, amusement coloring his voice, "but I don't think it tastes as good coming from your plate as it does Steve's."
Steve worked him through the aftershocks, until the muscles and nerves of his altered anatomy had ceased their tremors, and he gasped and panted and kept his eyes shut, and only when he felt Steve lay down beside him did he open his eyes and gaze up at the ceiling, eyes unfocused as he followed the line of shadows therein.
"So, I mean," Tony continued, "it's not like it's totally permanent. I'm not taking myself off the team forever. I just— I think it would be best if one of us stays back here with her at all times — just in case. Just in case something... My baby's not going to be an orphan if I can help it."
She turned back to him, her brown eyes wide in confusion and a little fear. "Unca Bruce, all my stuff's gone! That man took my stuff!"
Steve shook his head as though to shake off Tony's digression and said, "I mean it. I…like you both ways."
counts as me telling you, and I'm going to take your lack of 'Tony, no' as your approval of this project."
He slammed open the shower door and went over to the toilet, and before he could even get the seat up, he vomited into the bowl, sinking to his knees from the force of it and gagging by the time he'd finished. There were tears in his eyes now, a natural effect of the vomiting rather than anything emotional, and the soap he hadn't rinsed off his body was dripping onto the floor, creating a puddled mess.
are a thousand more times more stubborn than I'll ever be. Yeah, you can try to sit there all stony-faced all you want, I
It was a week later — a week of being sequestered in his workshop as he ignored everything and everyone and busied himself with his myriad of projects — when the Cap and the Spy Twins arrived back from whatever godforsaken locale they'd been assigned to.
He looked up and met Steve's blue-green gaze, Steve staring right back at him in a mix of wonder and pride and love — so much love.
Tony ran it through in his head in an attempt to figure out which year for certain it was, but Steve wasn't buying his concern. "Doesn't matter," he said like his word was law. "It's completely fictional."
"Don't fall asleep on me yet," Steve said, but Tony was so fucking tired, and he felt awful, and Steve's hands were like magic. They felt so damned good.
"No," he said, gritting his teeth as he attempted to find the purchase to allow him the right leverage to push himself upright. "I have to do this myself."
