“You can help,” Tony said quietly. “I’d rather not face the rabid masses this time of the year.”
“I can’t do that, Sir, it’s my job to -”
“Yeah, I got jealous. I, uhm… That’s why I called everyone’s attention on you, I panicked that it was obvious. I’m sorry,” he said once more.
“Uhm… One day, maybe. Right now I’d like to enjoy this.”
“So help me God, I’ll pull you over my knee and spank you!” Steve moaned, licking it again. “Oh, you’d like that?” When no answer came, Tony thrusted upwards slightly. “You want me to discipline you? I thought the army did that, Captain.”
“Voice it, Steve.”
“And she knows I prefer almond milk and makes sure to add it to all the cups of coffee she brings me.” Bruce sighed. “And in the afternoon she makes my tea for me and brings me food sometimes when she knows I’ve been to busy and forgot to eat.”
Steve had the ability to jump right out and into action, but with the lack of imminent danger he found himself sluggish and oddly at ease despite the tension in his lower back that came with Tony’s proximity. “What are you on about?”
“Captain! Darling, I had no idea you were
“Oh, pish posh! I knew it was you,” she told him with a girly giggle. She opened the door fully and stepped aside so he could walk in. “Besides, I have my cane right here. I’d smack anyone who thought I’d be an easy target.”
“There he goes again. Cap, you should share with us. It might help us survive the full day ahead of us,” Nat said patiently.
“Truth?” Natasha asked with a sad frown.
“As if! You’re the epitome of -”
“Best news I got all year! And refractory period or not, being with you is… I guess ‘intense’ is the best word.”
“One day, Captain Steven Rogers, I will get you to admit you’re doing it on purpose,” Tony said, walking towards the bathroom.
“I’m in highschool, we get it played for us every occasion they have,” he explained casually.
“Not in the -”
There was a break in the speeches, allowing for small talk and mingling. Steve firmly refused to get up and introduce himself to opportunistic assholes. He was polite when they approached him, shaking their hands and allowing their boastful one-sided conversations. If anything, out of sheer politeness alone. The prime-minister sat down in the recently vacated chair next to Steve.
All the Avengers came in to say hi, shepherded by Pepper who brought them cookies and hot chocolate. Jane was a hit with a couple of little girls who wanted to be scientists, and Natasha showed some of them how to get out of a hold before she was rushed away. “I’ll be good,” she shouted, “just let me tell them what not to do when they’re attacked from the side.”
Steve sighed. “Darcy told me. She sent the link and a bunch of memes I don’t understand.”
Tony pulled back, biting into the massive pile of popcorn on Steve’s lap. “What new things have you discovered, Cap?” he asked slowly.
“I don’t know, yeah, maybe, yeah.”
Steve huffed, trying not to get closer to him. He was leaning on the kitchen island, safe from giving in to his now constant wish of touching the man in any way he could. “I thought you gave me the Star Wars boxset?”
He almost forgot to change in his hurry to get inside. The city was buzzing, and he was really hoping there wouldn’t be any lunatic to ruin the fun. He was hoping even villains wanted to celebrate the end of a year and the beginning of a new one. Or that they were drunk and passed out. Whatever, as long as they left the city alone for a night.
“Fossil, I tell ya,” Nat shouted in an exaggerated accent.
Tony was curled up in the armchair, one knee up to his chest as much as possible in the smallish seat. He was trying to reach a throw with his other leg, toes stretched inside the sock he still had on.
There was a long string of rapid one-liners about Mr. Fantastic that Steve had to focus to battle through. “It’s your lost puppy face and the tasteful bulging muscles. If everybody who handed me things looked like you, I’d have less of a problem with it. Oh, he’s being stretched thin!”
He sorted the light bulbs out first, and then moved on to fix the boiler. After gruesome minutes of diagnostics, everything took a turn for the better when he realised the error was due to low water pressure. From there it was just a matter of identifying the right knob, and as soon as that was done the familiar whirring started up again.
Tony:
“I’m fucking with you, Steve,” Tony laughed. “Blatantly hitting on you to deflect from our less than happy conversation the other day.”
Steve had a brief thought that Tony doing mundane homely things was beautiful. He stifled it quickly before it developed further.
“You know what I want,” he growled.
“He seems to be coming to.”
“Throw up if it helps,” Tony told him kindly. “It’s no big deal.”
“Stop telling me what to –”
It was all very informal, with just the Avengers and their close friends. Vision trying to be inconspicuous in his white button down, drifting around Wanda as close as possible without clinging to her. Quicksilver speeding around the room smiling at Maria Hill in that downright shameless manner that made Fury cock his head ominously. Pepper and Maria converging to the side to complain about managing what were basically children. Bruce chatting to Jane and pretending not to be dumbstruck by Darcy’s pin-up dress and hair. Sam and Bucky to the side, chatting animatedly about sport, Steve guessed. It looked like a promising night. No trains in sight.
“Yes, dear! On my way, dear! You know, if I’d sent this on an iPhone, the shortcut would be oh-em-double-u and it would look like I’m really excited, but in reality I’m just saying I’m gonna be there soon and – Hi babies!” He lands next to the twins, blasting away Doombots left and right. “I’m gonna be your ride out of here today.”
“Come on, they’ll write about this for days anyway,” Steve said and tightened his tie knot.
without his suit on. Asshole. Once more, he almost flies there, but there’s a fresh wave of robots and Tony’s ready to use the heavy weaponry and get it over with.
Bucky:
“No,” Steve said with a short bitter laugh. “But I will, because I owe you that much.”
“I’ll sue you!” Jones shrieked and she steered him away.
“And your cock?”
“Yes, I do. But I want you to tell me.” He almost pulled out completely, then stopped altogether, teasing Steve’s rim. “It’s me, you can tell me, Steve,” he whispered encouragingly before wrapping his lips on Steve’s dick once more.
“Sounds like something Peggy would do. They were all good people,” Steve agreed.
“Don’t underestimate how hard it is for me,” Steve said slyly. Tony kissed him, hard and messy. “This is only making it harder, not gonna lie.”
“Told you to leave him alone, Tony,” Nat shouted from the other room. “If he kills you I won’t blame him.”
They tried to figure out what he wanted to do for his birthday the closer it got. At first he was vague about it. Then, when they insisted, he explained he didn’t want a party. They compromised on dinner with party hats and watching the fireworks together to celebrate.
Tony’s therapist apparently sprayed water on him, inspired by the meme Tony felt the need to share with her. Tony loved her dearly for that, he’d said.
“The mission went well, but we didn’t expect the immediate retaliation.” She sat down and gently lowered Thor on the floor. The tree was still hovering enveloped in her magic.
Steve’s nose was nestled into the short curly hair at the base, trying his best to force his throat to not react. He could feel the tiniest of burns in the corners of his mouth as he sucked, courtesy of the impressive girth stretching his lips. He flattened his tongue as he pulled up, flicking it rapidly when he reached the head. He sucked on it, catching the sensitive gentle rim on his lips repeatedly until Tony managed to take advantage of his shift in focus and bucked his hips once Steve loosened his hold on him.
“What?”
He realised halfway through that he was sketching an office. The office from his dream, to be precise. He froze, looked around. The other two were engrossed in their respective activities, and Steve tried to be rational about it. There was no way any of them could have known about his dream. The office was non-descript as far as he could tell, and even as he remembered it in vivid detail, the entire sequence of events was too surreal and fragmented. Not for the first time he found himself thanking Jesus, Joseph, and Mary that none of his immediate friends - family - was able to read minds. Then he promptly felt guilty about the level of blasphemy reached with that exclamation. Then his guilt escalated as soon as he glanced down at is drawing and he imagined the detailed way in which he would draw Tony’s arched back, his fingers pressing into a roughly sketched Steve Rogers. A man shape, really, because all Steve wanted was to capture the glistening of Tony’s lips, wet around his dick, the glint in his eyes showing he knew exactly what he was doing.
“I really like the stuffed sheep,” he said matter-of-factly.
“Yeah.”
Steve was suddenly very aware of why everyone and their mother was afraid of Pepper.
“Okay, then what’s up?”
“I am extremely supportive of that,” Steve replied.
“Maybe it is, but I love it,” Steve blurted out, feeling the heat take over his cheeks. “I mean… I mean. You could be getting me a car or a piece of paper that says ‘present’, and I’d love it anyway. It’s who you are, I don’t care if it’s over the top,” he finished lamely. “Besides it’s from the heart, no matter what it is. If it wasn’t from the heart you wouldn’t even remember and –”
Saturday seemed as good a day as any. He’d received the much awaited text regarding his order first thing in the morning. It put a spring in his step, getting him through making breakfast and an endless video conference with some folks from the Navy. All he could think about was the damned parcel.
“Oh, poor baby,” Steve cooed, only a little bit mockingly.
“What, no comment on the porn?”
It was comfortable, working on various things side by side. The plane wasn’t as fast as the quinjet, but this wasn’t an Avengers mission, and they wanted to come across as diplomats. Steve found himself actually wishing they were going into battle, because that required little to no civilian interaction, no small talk, and no forced smiles. And he wouldn’t have to wear a suit.
– Tony was jogging away from the burning building, covered in soot, clothes slightly burnt where the fire got to them. He was holding a goat in his arms from what Steve could see. He was holding it close to his chest, lips moving continuously in what Steve knew were reassuring words, fire dancing menacingly behind him and Steve was fucking
“Yes!” He reached behind him trying to locate Tony and touch him. He was feeling anchored by too little. Frustrated, he moved forward and flipped on his back once more. “I want to see you.”
Steve smiled fondly at his phone, glad to be in the privacy of his room where no one could catch him doing so.
Clint:
“It happens,” Tony shrugged, cheeky smile on his face. He inspected the tray one more time before pulling open the door to a massive oven.
But Steve was also aware of subtleties, despite people assuming he was a big dumb lug. Oh, he fully agreed he was dumb (see latest incident, not two hours before), but he was not ignorant. And he was not unable to understand the insides of how things worked. So he knew running away wasn’t an option. Not unless it was on official business and it was a secret mission. And even then, how fucking secret could it stay when everyone was aware he was missing. He wouldn’t be seen buying groceries or on his run. And they would be looking, Steve knew that. They would try and find him relentlessly, no respect for his privacy. They would be perceived as weak, they would be criticised even more than before, and Steve brought down enough hassle as it was.
Nonetheless, he dives down feet first, kicking the bot’s head with his soles. “Aww, I’m hurt,” he tries for a joke, but he worries Steve can tell anyway.
“Excuse me, I had to get Bennu away from danger,” Tony said quietly.
Steve had to smile at the bite. The AI was truly Tony’s child, maybe even more than Jarvis. Where Jarvis was built with part of the real man in mind, Friday was purely Tony’s snark progeny. The closer he got to the kitchen, the harder his heart beat, the harder it was to breathe, the sicker he felt. He slowed down to what probably looked like a comical shuffle of feet. Eventually, through some sort of bravery he definitely didn’t possess - the same one Darcy claimed made him a full-fledged Gryffindor - he stepped in the brightly lit room.
“Nice!” Steve praises, rolling out of the way as metal flies around him. “How we looking?”
“Don’t swallow. Hold it there,” he told Steve. Then he nodded with a smile. “Very good, darling. That’s all you get for now. If you’re good maybe I can give you a better reward later, yeah?”
” she said in Russian. “Steve?”
Tony shook his head vigorously. “No. You know me, I don’t
Tony materialised to their side with two more shot glasses. “He’s an honest guy, Natasha. Of course he won’t let you win.” He downed his and gave the other to her.
And Steve opened his mouth and — nothing. It had started off as a bit of fun, easy banter, lightening the mood, bonding and whatnot. And now that he had to think about it, there was nothing he wanted in return for his grand scheme. He actually flushed, realising that as fun as it was to scheme and toy with people for a bit, he didn’t really have an end goal. So he nodded, hoping to look wise and calculating instead of foolish, and got up to leave.
“You are just terrible, Steve! Terrible!” she exclaimed, and slapped his arm in innocent flirting. After they sat down for a cup of tea she turned and required him knowingly. “So you have no plans then?”
He has to physically bite his tongue to stop from being crude, choosing instead to open his arms so Steve can step in his embrace. Even through the metal, holding Steve feels wonderful. Like how it feels when he settles into bed after a two-day marathon of lab work. Like how it feels to wash away the grime after a battle. Like how it feels to get a solution to a problem. Like home. When they land, he’s nowhere near ready to let go. He quickly opens his faceplate, hovering enough to hide Steve’s face. Then he ducks and presses his lips to the man’s jaw.
“Please,” Steve said weakly.
“But I fabricated it. In my hyperactive brain that would not let me be.” He regretted the way his tone had taken a sort of finality note.
Steve sighed. “I honestly doubt that, but I’m not going to discuss this now.” Or ever, if he had his way. Bucky would push, because Bucky knew how he got, but Bucky was safe. Back home was safe, in his room where he could hide and fake sleep for the foreseeable future.
“Buck, I need a favour,” Steve started, already dreading the teasing he’d receive. After a short internal debate, he’d decided it was worth it.
In saying that, I am aware this is overflowing with dialogue, I am aware they are moving too fast, I am aware of Steve's character inconsistencies. These are valid points. Also, fuck 'em. I have explanations for every single one of these issues. And these may not have been on my mind when I wrote them, that is to say they weren't on purpose, but I am using them to my advantage and I am fully excusing them.
Tony paused his ministrations to get Steve’s full attention. “I remember that. You were kissing that woman and I –”
you carved for him any more you’ll tear up space and time.” He turned to Bruce, “You might actually be the least interested, given your little tradition, but you want to birthday hug him so you should be thinking of a bargaining chip too.” He paused to inhale deeply and opened his mouth to go on. “Pietro, you —“
Natasha gasped. “Are you insane? We’d kill each other! We actually will.”
“You ruined Christmas,” Darcy shouted and then turned to Bruce. “You know I don’t -”
He can’t see. He can’t breathe. The dust particles fill his eyes and nose and throat, it stings to keep breathing and he wishes he could stop. It feels like the desert, like having his head dunked in water, like torture that he has no reason to take anymore. Someone is calling his name, but he can’t stop digging.
Tony tsked. “It’s not, but we’ll sort it out together. No one is upset with you, Steve.”
Tony laughed. “It’ll just be more comfortable. Don’t worry, it’s a magical t-shirt.” He pulled it towards him and Steve held on tighter, eyes wide and definitely not ready to let it go. Tony sniffed it a couple of times. “Okay, it’s clean. I think I wore it only once since it’s been washed, if that bothers you I can —“
“Captain, are you okay?” one of the faceless people asked, and Steve nodded, not trusting his voice. “We were thinking you could give the presentation on -”
,” he spat the word, “I will not stand behind this propaganda. Your people protest and you expect us to believe everything is going well. To pose for photos and shake hands and be on our merry way? Unacceptable. Thank you.”
“Oh, I can take it! My safe word is Shakespeare,” he explained, eyes sparkling with something akin to mischief.
When they joined Natasha, she was sprawled across the gaudy sofa, her legs draped over the back and the arm. She loosely held a remote as she switched the channels rapidly.
“The references, the quotes!”
Tony cupped his cheek. “You could never be a burden. Ever. Not to me, not to any of us.” Steve went quiet, trying not to lean into the touch. “We’re here for you. Steve.
Clint:
The archer did, mumbling about how they were all assholes and that he needed new friends. It started safely enough, with a short explanation, then a collage of people doing normal things with their lives.
Tony:
The man burst into laughter, shaking both of them as he pulled back. He went to wipe the dampness under his eyes that were not fully formed tears, but Steve knew. “You played with all of them for hours before asking, really?”
“Sorry, I tried knocking but you didn’t answer and we need to be up in fifteen minutes.” She paused, his frantic breathing filling the silent room. “You sure you’re okay?”
“We’re among friends, it’s not like I’m daring you to take photos half naked squeezing a wet sponge over your chest.”
” Tony shrieked and gestured wildly to the tv perched on the cabinet. “Where are we, oh my god!”
“So you’re choosing for her.”
The music had changed by now, and everyone swapped impressions about their competition while swaying to it. Or at least he thought they were, he didn’t care all that much. Tony was showing Natasha his throat, explaining something about it and Steve’s mind brought back the image of the bulge, and what it treacherously decided to paint as heat in Tony’s eyes. Steve really wanted to get drunk. And yes, it wasn’t his party, but he could cry if he wanted to.
He managed to leave when the vet arrived, quietly and hopefully unobserved. He tried his best not to rush to his room, not to attract attention. When Vision enquired about his well-being, he lied through his teeth and explained he felt exhausted, but he was otherwise okay.
Steve was reticent, but the old woman’s eyes were insistent despite the clear lack of focus. It did seem as if she could see through him, inside of him. Her face was wrinkled, a darker hue accentuated by the tan she seemed to be sporting. Steve was compelled to cooperate. He wasn’t certain why, but he felt like some insight into his future, as ridiculous as it might have been was going to help settle the heavy feeling in his stomach. “Yes,” he eventually said and put his hand forward.
The other journalists there sneered at Jones when he joined them. He tried to start an argument with them, but they were not having it.
He wanted to cry.
“I don’t think I –”
“We need containment, can you help?” Steve wiggles in Tony’s hold, trying to get loose. “Tony.”
Steve nodded. He inhaled deeply, rubbing his nose under the arc reactor. The fabric was a hindrance, but Tony’s smell filled his nostrils and his head, and he was pleased. “I do.”
“That’s right, it isn’t. So, what will it be, Captain? Truth or dare?”
Steve hated all of it. He’d seen it before, so had Tony. Natasha was closely acquainted with these tactics. It was throwing morsels of democracy to an upset people and expect them to worship you. The three of them were there to ensure the subtle threat didn’t go unnoticed. If the country fucked up again, if the people were to suffer again, there would be no more aid. There would be no more diplomatic missions. Tony was capable and willing to commission planes, paint them in happy colours, and use them to transport all the children to the tower. There would probably be enough room to house all of them if they bunked. The whole political situation was temporary anyway. The power void left by the uprisings needed to be filled. This was the lesser evil, and it would have to do for the time being.
Steve thought it was a joke at first, but then when they finally found Nat, she was casually juggling with a couple of knives. “Hi guys, this is Dmitri.”
“I’m —“
In the large living room, the tree now had the fairy lights on. Darcy was sitting on Thor’s shoulders, holding on to two braids in the man’s hair. She made horse riding noises and laughing at the same time. Steve wasn’t even phased any more. He accepted the mug of hot chocolate from Bruce, who was watching her guide Thor around the Christmas tree with a tilted head.
“Yeah, nothing like imagining sex acts in front of officials we’re meeting in a country that’s still kind of unstable,” Steve quipped.
“This tv’s daddy was ancient, and until very recently it lived right here!”
Steve joined him, inspecting the prosthetics carefully. “Is she in any pain?”
“He what?” Steve shot up on the bed.
age, Jesus! He giggles despite himself.
“That wasn’t so hard, was it?” He slid down to lick on Steve’s abs. “This is, though,” he said, and rubbed his cheek along the bulge in Steve’s pants.
His head whipped round to look at Natasha. “Sorry, what? I wasn’t paying attention.”
“Whoa! Okay, okay, sorry!”
“But hey, at least we’re in this together, right?” Steve asked.
“Lover –"
, I do have a refractory period.”
Bennu pushed her little head into Thor’s chest. “Yes. It was only for a short time, but I missed him so much. So I found a book and learned the spell to be able to communicate with animals. At first I could only speak cow and Loki laughed at me. Then he helped me find the right spell. And now I can speak goat,” he shrugged.
Steve sighed, feeling old. “Surely it can’t be that –"
Tony opened his mouth, but Steve was quicker. “Okay, enough! All of you. Tony, shut up for a minute. Clint, I’m sorry you’re in pain and had to be annoyed by these two drunks. Now, if you calm down for a second,” he checked the time and continued, “ask Friday to get Bruce for you. He gets a sweet tooth when he’s stressed, so he might have an answer. There’s also the lab freezer, this one always hides stuff in there,” he pointed to Tony.
Despite himself, Steve nodded. “Can you tell me your name?” he asked quietly.
“What?” Steve snapped at both of them.
“So, you got detention,” Clint started.
“I’ve got a bigger bed.” When Steve tensed, he stopped. “We don’t have to do anything,” he said kindly. “It’s just more comfortable, that’s all. You’re not exactly small-built,” he repeated Steve’s words from the hotel. He ran his hands on Steve’s shoulders and arms, licking his lips as he did it.
“Don’t say it like that! It sounds like I’m asking you to deliver drugs!”
“Mhm,” he hummed as he pursed his lips to create the friction Tony wanted. It was potentially the most powerful he’d ever felt, to know he could reduce him to a needy begging mess. He pinned his hips down to stop him from thrusting up, determined to take his time.
Steve’s heart fluttered. Eight. “Steve’s little smiles when he thinks no one is watching are sometimes the best thing about my day.” Shot. “I fucking hate this stuff, it gets me so stupid,” he complained and went back down for another pushup. He was slower now, sluggish, and Steve wanted to pick him up and hold him and bury his face in his neck.
“Whoa, you’d also think you’d be more relaxed,” Bucky counters, the sound of shooting almost drowning him. “And my birthday’s not for another eight months!”
When she pulled back, Bruce was dazed and very confused. He managed a weak “What?”
“True. So…”
“I don’t understand that reference,” Steve shouts after him, but his face is split in a grin, and for now, Tony knows it’s okay. “Take me up?”
“Tony!”
Clint assumed his position. “You screwed up. You know what you did was wrong…”
Steve had fucked up. Some teenagers came up and politely asked for photos. A couple of brave ones took selfies. This was going to be a mediatic disaster. Even with everyone on his side, the opposing media will have months of twisting his words monstrously. Every selfie he took was another week of derogatory rhetoric towards him and by extension his superhero family. Fuck.
Tony turned to look at him for a long second before patting his shoulder and pointing towards something. “Come on, let’s get Natasha. I left her talking to a ringmaster, if we’re not careful she’ll run away with them.”
Bruce took the drink and sipped it slowly. Steve felt like he was caught in some odd power play between people who had more of a life than he did. He poured a shot of tequila and downed it just to adhere to their standards. Tony poured him another one.
“You named the goat?”
Tony moved his hand to the side to kiss the inside of Steve’s palm. Then he pulled two of his fingers inside his mouth, sucking them lazily. He turned his head to indulge in Steve’s other hand, nuzzling it, then repeating the kissing and licking pattern all the way back to Steve’s hard nipple.
He’d seen little of Tony that week. It happened every now and then, they’d come to terms with it. The first few times felt extremely definitive, like there was no coming back from that. It seemed far away, a lifetime of growth replacing that despair. Now it was enough to find each other in bed at some point during the night. They’d visit each other briefly throughout the day whenever they could, they’d text and send selfies.
“Okay, you’re definitely doing it on purpose now.”
Steve snaked his arms around him, pulled him close, and
“The dream changed and… You were naked on my desk, with your head hanging backwards and – please!”
When they finally made it to their assigned car, Steve was ready to bolt, make a run for the plane and fly back home. Despite his track record with flying towards that part of the world, he was willing to risk it. It seemed he wasn’t the only one, if the nudge to his ribs was any indication.
“You joke, but there’s a seduction module for advanced undercover training.”
“Okay, I’m getting up. What do you want, you Russian cow?”
“True, true,” the man agreed hurriedly, then retrieved some papers from his inner pocket. He seemed hesitant. “I was – that is, we were hoping you could get up and deliver a speech to consolidate our common efforts.” The eloquence was mostly there, delivered with a hint of an accent. “To cement our relationship since we have the same goals, no?” he asked, the Slavic lilt harsher on that last word.
“Yeah?”
Steve brought the mug from his bedroom, where Tony spent the night definitely not debating ways of kissing Steve’s collarbone. Steve could definitely not say the same. “There you go. I’m taking a shower, getting dressed, and if you know what’s good for you, you better be in the lobby in thirty minutes.”
Movie evening - the lighter version of movie night - happened to be the day before his birthday. They had a full house for it. Steve had given in and accepted that they now owned a popcorn maker, the large one they usually had at the cinema. Vision had spent the afternoon personalising it with various Avengers stickers, then proceeded to use it to make enormous amounts of popcorn for them all.
“She’s beautiful,” Steve interrupted.
Tony’s eyes narrowed. He looked towards Steve who was trying to keep the most impassive face of his life despite the words ‘hint of ballsack’ (god damn it, Steve, ballsacks really?) and ‘naked ass’, then back at Natasha. “No,” he started slowly. “I imagine they’re not. In fact, I think they’re quite amazing. A force of nature. A work of art. Intelligent. Beautiful. Nay, stunning. Gorgeous. So brilliant at what they do. Genuinely an astonishing person.”
“I’m fine, I’m fine.” Tony went to go past the doctors, but Steve grabbed his shoulder and steered him back.
Tony shrugged with the shoulder the doctor wasn’t busy with. “I picked a gender-neutral name.”
“Yes. And I need you,” Steve whined.
“Dinner smells great. Ah, I missed you,” Tony sighed, lifting his hand to hold on to Steve’s shoulder. “Missed this,” he added.
“Sure,” Steve agreed sarcastically. “I mean sleep is just plain unnecessary really. We should all just not sleep and instead go into people’s rooms and harass them until they snap. That’s a much better plan.”
There was a long pause. Then he heard movement, then the door opened slowly and her eye made an appearance in the freshly created space. “Okay, but I hate it.”
The situation started off normal, he woke up, realised it was his birthday, groaned. He did some stretches, went to relieve himself, then brushed his teeth. He was contemplating a shower when the loud-loud alarms went off. He went into fight mode immediately.
“My beautiful love,” Tony cooed. He pressed his lips to Steve’s half-opened mouth.
“Uhm,” Steve managed. “I don’t doubt you, but —“
“Fine,” Tony sighed and downed his drink. “Technically, it’s been about eleven months, but there was a-third-of-a-thing a couple of months back.” He slumped back in the armchair. “So, yeah. I somehow ended up in this celibacy situation. Not by choice, can I just add,” he finished on a self-deprecating note, with a raised glass full of swirling amber liquid that he proceeded to drink all at once.
They kept an eye on Bruce as Darcy and Bucky eased into a swing dance. He had a small smile on, wiping at his glasses absentmindedly. Without the threat of a Hulk-out (and Steve was certain Bruce had more self-control than to lose his shit over this), it was actually amusing to watch. His eyes swept Darcy’s figure up and down as she moved, looking like he was trying to convince himself of something or the other. Steve grudgingly admired Bucky’s plan, but even if it worked out fine for everyone, he was still going to get punched in the non-metal shoulder for being a dick.
He methodically cleaned the entire workspace Tony had used for the cupcakes, foam-wipe-rinse-wipe-move on until his hands were pruney. By the end of it, he was neither more calm, nor less anxious. He had, instead, resigned to always be a pitiful moron who had broken down in front of Tony, and who’d embarrassed himself beyond redemption. How could he ever wipe the shame of being
He mimicked the man’s earlier actions, leaning in to whisper in his ear. “I really like the stuffed sheep too,” Steve said, feeling kind of lame for using the same line.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll uninstall you. I will,” he threatened.
They were silent for the drive, each caught in their own thoughts. Steve’s phone went off, then Tasha’s, then Tony’s, and they all groaned at what this meant.
“Sometimes I’m selfish and grateful you were frozen. Like, yeah I know it was really shitty for you, but if you hadn’t I probably wouldn’t have met you and I think,” he paused to yawn, “that I’d have missed you a lot.”
“You happy about this, Rhodey?” Then he catches on. “I suppose you also want me to launch you into the fucking thing, don’t you?” He can’t help the way his sigh is equal parts exasperated and amused. Maybe a bit loving as well.
“You’re barking at the wrong tree, I can’t even figure out how to get my own mind to cooperate half the time. The other half I’m trying to be a normal human being.”
She laughed weakly. “I also saved the tree,” she said simply. “And I don’t want to be in Medical right now.”
“Are you scolding me, doctor?”
Steve pulled back to look at him. “It’s better,” he answered, and could feel himself blush thinking about the way Tony’s throat had bulged around his dick in his dream. “This is real,” he added.
He was grateful he had the forethought to hang his clothes up. He buttoned the shirt quickly, threw the grey tie around his neck, and draped the blazer on his arm. Tony’s private plane would be warm, and it would be too uncomfortable to add another layer of clothing, regardless of how expensive it was. Clint was fast asleep when he left his room, and he snickered as he tucked his colleague in better.
They collectively groaned. Clint had done that for every little thing in the past weeks. Steve knew it was innocent fun, but he was still embarrassed by it. “When will this get old?” he asked Clint only half-rhetorically.
Steve sighed and followed with Natasha. “We were meant to leave at 7:30?”
Extreme temperatures weren’t necessarily debilitating to Steve, but they weren’t exactly comfortable. He couldn’t claim the cold bothered him, but it wasn’t pleasant. This kind of cold was worse, however. He was unable to shake it, despite the June heat. The tower’s central heating system was regulated; the temperature was generally pleasant to be in regardless of the season. But even so, Steve felt cold. He took to turning the heat on at night and he swaddled himself in every blanket he had. The shivering was relentless, and when he did fall asleep, he had nightmares about the ice.
He can and he will admit beautiful things catch his eye often and a lot of his kind-of-romantic exploits have been informed by looks. Sometimes, when he’d been extra shallow, looks were the only box to tick. Now, though. Now, Steve brought with him a myriad of boxes and then proceded to tick them all, making Tony groan at his question. “Yeah? I don’t know,” he replies honestly.
“But it was related to me, wasn’t it?”
Tony nodded. “Mildly, don’t worry about it too much.”
“Gorgeous, darling. You’re absolutely gorgeous.” He kissed Steve’s forehead once more. Then his hand moved to caress his shoulders, down the arch of his back. He kissed his cheek, then along his jaw. “How did I ever get so lucky, Steve?” The reverence in Tony’s voice spread through Steve’s veins, pleasing him to no end. “I’ve got a camera here. Polaroid, nothing digital, you know I won’t risk it. I want to take photos of you, to show you how beautiful you look. The primary reason is selfish, I won’t lie. I want to have something to stare at longingly when we’re not together.” He nuzzled Steve’s exposed throat. “Is that okay? I need you to safeword or safesign if you don’t want this.”
Steve pondered how much truth there was in those words. Not that he believed Tony would lie to him maliciously, but he was concerned he would compromise for Steve’s sake. He moved up enough to leave the man completely topless, the t-shirt he had on did nothing but hinder their closeness. The skin to skin feeling was majestic, it made Steve feel complete, like that was where he belonged. He returned to his previous task.
Shit, his dick was starting to harden.
“Have me,” Steve said through clenched teeth.
- kitchen. Steve couldn’t help the thought that even his toes were cute, the way he was rocking back on his heels, all excited and happy.
“Yeah, with your metabolism and all. And I know it’s mostly not recommended for panic and anxiety, but you looked like you could use it.”
“What goat?”
Steve snorted bitterly. “I’m not entirely sure I should have told you even now,” he admitted.
“Yeah, no shit,” Steve interrupted and regretted it instantly. “Sorry, I didn’t mean -”
He doesn’t understand. Bucky’s arms go around his torso and he’s being pulled back. Back, away from the pitifully small area he’d managed to dig.
“Of course, have you met me?”
Loosening Tony’s tie at the end of a day – or in an empty conference room once Friday switched off all the surveillance – was always a thrill. It felt like he was opening a present, and he took great pleasure in unveiling Tony’s neck, the tendon there tight as he bent his head to offer better access. And he could never help dropping at least a few kisses on the exposed skin, sometimes playful, other times wet and open-mouthed.
The music changed to something more familiar to Steve; Bucky stopped by his side on his way to the dance floor. “Watch this,” he told them with a shit eating grin. He quickly grabbed Darcy and pulled her close. Steve groaned again.
“I think he just likes it, to be honest.”
“He’ll do it,” she said and grabbed a burger for herself. “It’s for children.”
“Yeah, yeah I am,” the man laughed. “May I?”
“What if - and feel free to say no, always feel free to say no to me, Steve,” he added more seriously, “what if I find ways to, encourage your storytelling, shall we call it?” His hand cupped Steve’s heavy balls, moving up to grip his hardening cock.
“Come here, darling.” He patted his thighs invitingly before pouring lube on his erection.
Tony tutted and went to pour himself a drink. “Now, now children. Daddy’s going to take your toys away if you don’t behave.” (Steve pretended he didn’t bend his head down so much it nearly went into the bag when the word “daddy” left Tony’s mouth.) “God, you call me ostentatious and
“We need to check and see if we can help. You and Nat can go back to the hotel, I’ll stay.”
“What is this deepthroating?” Thor’s voice managed to boom even when he didn’t mean it to.
The day of the big reveal, Steve understood the ‘fit to work’. Tony walked in first, Peter in tow, followed by very quiet tiny steps. They had gathered in the kitchen for breakfast and stayed for the official reveal of the new member. Bennu walked into the kitchen on four legs, prompting Steve to gasp audibly.
“Well, I’ve got a nice buzz to get me to sleep, so I’m gonna cherish it and maybe improve it.”
“What do you want, Rogers?”
“That would be completely inappropriate,” Tony said with a fake grave voice. Steve had no fucking clue anymore. He was an idiot.
Steve smiled. “I feel like I would eventually become touch-starved.”
“We don’t talk about it, we all have weird family,” Tony explained.
“You know, one day we’ll have to explore this fascination of yours in regards to feet.”
It was met with protests, and Steve couldn’t help but wonder when exactly his life turned into playing sitcom with these people. He totally unequivocally loved it, if he were being honest. A sucker for sitcoms old and new, his mind reeling with analysing the evolution of the genre whenever he had a minute for trivial topics. So he rejoiced every time something happened to remind him of the tv shows.
Steve shook his head. “It was lava and fire and I couldn’t save anyone and –” He swallowed heavily, his hands shaking around the mug. He made a conscious effort to not break it. It seemed to be standard issue, but it wasn’t polite to go breaking people’s tableware. “The lab was on fire, I couldn’t find you and when I did, you were burnt and there was nothing I could do. The smell –” He felt bile rising to his throat and he forced it down, pressing down on his chest. When he opened his eyes, Tony was pushing down on his shoulder. The pressure anchored him; he felt his entire body hanging from the man’s grasp.
“And can I—“
“Look, Sergeant uncle Bucky! Just go and see if they’re okay, they’ve been shouting and…”
“And after?” Tony laughs as he hovers above Steve.
Steve’s blush was unavoidable. “You said if I put on a show you’ll lift the ban —“
Clint popped up from the sofa, kneeling and leaning on the back of it with a grin. “Make it spin, make it spin!” If Steve was a teenager, Clint was essentially five.
“No more doing things around the house tonight, you’re too big to be a house elf. And they’re not as cute. Now move,” he kept prodding at his chest, pulling at his arms, and even yanked his hair a little.
Clint appeared in the doorway, blanket around his shoulders, chest covered in bandages.
“What do you mean? We’re in your office, I sneaked in at lunch, and this is your first anniversary present. Happy anniversary, darling!” He moved to get his mouth back around Steve, but the Captain’s hands tightened in the scientist’s hair and kept him there.
“I am literally two stupid sentences away from flying back to New York and hiding in Brooklyn for the foreseeable future.”
Clint:
Never had he taken so much from someone. Steve pulled back before he could come. The journey back out was just as wonderfully torturous. He gave Tony as much time as he needed to come back from the stretch of accommodating his dick.
“Are you going to ask me every time?”
Steve had a new appreciation for Tony’s extravagant nature when he caught sight of the size of the bed. He gently deposited him on the soft comforter, trying to figure out the best way to proceed.
“Yes,” Steve readily agreed. “Yeah, that.”
Steve really wanted to throw his phone away.
Tony was quiet for a while. They enjoyed the cupcakes in silence, broken by the occasional whirring noise from Dum-E. “Stephen Colbert wants you on.”
He made it halfway to the burning building, near where the petting zoo had been when he saw someone walking out. His stomach lurched and he was glad he had something covering his mouth and nose to stifle the urge to throw up. He started running again, sweat dripping down his forehead.
“Steve, we’ll help!” Clint shouted behind him.
Steve’s demons were mostly appeased, he realised. They were trying to fight back against the feeling of being protected; ugly words, nasty thoughts that told him he was going to be mocked by everyone for being this pathetic. They reminded of him all the articles and comments he’d read, and called him names. Told him he was a burden, a weakling,
“Okay, okay, go Widow. I’m bracing myself, I’m ready for this,” Tony urged her.
Tony pushed him back down. “It’s okay! It’s okay, Steve, it’s just me. I’ve got you, you’re safe. It’s me. I’ll let go with one hand to reach for water, okay? Okay.”
“Ah, fuck that was funny.” He turned on his side and faced Steve once again, wiping tears from his face. “What, a man can’t slide into your bed without you questioning him?
Bruce nodded vehemently. “Exactly! A whole life ahead of her!”
a fool of myself and you’re doing… you’re doing…
“Because we finally found we have something in common. Worrying, I mean. About others, not myself. This isn’t going very well.”
Bucky stayed quiet, guiding the trunk in the large hole. “There,” he said, “all done.”
“Tony why is the tree moving?”
Tony laughed. “That’s my fault. If I’d asked if you had a crush, I’d have known if you were lying. Next time I’ll ask.” Steve chuckled. “What’s the matter, darling?
“Well, you’re an asshole,” Steve announces, taking in the situation, hand resting on his hip. “And you can kiss your birthday present goodbye, along with my ass.”
. “Thank you,” Steve whispered. His knees almost gave out when Tony gently pulled at the d-ring.
Two of Tony’s fingers did not make for an impressive girth, not when Steve was used to the man’s cock. But their weight was better than nothing and he began sucking on them enthusiastically. He let his head fall back, felt the fingers slide further toward his throat, the slight burn as they touched the back of his tongue.
It turned out he didn’t actually have time to give himself the foreplay he’d sketched in his mind. So he roughly pinched his nipples a couple of times, tugged at his semi and went straight to rubbing lube on his hole. He made it quick, not ideal for a new toy. But it was his own fault really, so he rushed the adjustment time needed, popping the first bead in. Cute, but nothing on Tony’s first knuckle. Neither was the second bead, despite the slight increase in size. The third brought out a sigh, and yeah okay, this would actually work. He toyed with the fourth one too, but the giddiness of experiencing this fully for the first time in front of Tony won, and he stopped. He didn’t account for the removal of the first three beads, and for how much he would enjoy it. So he stroked his cock until he began to feel the tension in the back of his balls, and forced his hand to move away.
Tony looked back and forth at them trying to understand. “What are you on about?”
Steve groaned.
“That’s nothing!” he replied, a boisterous grin on his face. “You can do better than that.”
Steve's smile was impossible to control as he turned around to walk towards his boyfriend. Still made him giggle, no matter how many times he thought about it. And it was a lot, if he were being honest. Compliments were still difficult to get used to, but he rejoiced in them anyway, especially as he’d spent more than ten minutes putting together an outfit. And he guessed the white button down and the tailored slacks were working in his favour as Tony blatantly ogled him over the rim of his glasses. He’d added the fancier shoes, styled his hair and left the top button undone, cause he always found that hot when Tony did it, maybe it worked the other way around. “Hi,” he said almost shyly.
“Pepper, I’m joking! Calm down. I wasn’t paying attention to what I put on earlier so I didn’t realise what it was,” he reassured.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Put that superior strength to good use, Cap, I see how it is.”
Steve thought he looked adorable, with the frosting smear still on his cheek. Without thinking, he reached up slowly and gathered it on his fingers, eating it greedily. Tony was still, watching him. “Can I?” Steve asked, pointing to the cupcakes. Tony nodded, humming his approval. So Steve picked one up, biting half in one go, the flavours exploding in his mouth. “Oh my god!” He was talking with his mouth full, speech muffled by the dessert.
“No, where have you been all my life?”
“Tony, my place is your place,” he said with a smile.
Tony laughed. “Alright, Captain Pun, you’re not allowed on the internet anymore.” His face seemed to betray some sort of knowledge, and Steve was suddenly scared that he knew what he’d been looking at and doing.
“Fine! I’ll get the tree and do the decoration shopping,” he said, starting to get short with everyone. It was definitely not going according to plan. “In fact, why don’t we scrape the entire thing, and I organise Christmas on my own? You just have to turn up. Or not, whatever you want.” He gathered his markers and the whiteboard, heading for the door.
“I’ll come,” Steve said through gritted teeth.
He was beyond mortified. More than the vulnerability - and that he could deal with, relying on someone to have your back in life or death situations kind of meant you allowed yourself to be vulnerable around them -, he was
“You just missed it,” Steve replied, his lips ghosting Tony’s.
“Sometimes,” Steve answered. “Would you? Have said anything?”
Tony laughed. “For one, why do you even know that term? Do we need to play the Cap video instead?”
“Oh! My place or yours? The lab?”
“Okay?” Steve laughed.
He was moved, but he wanted to be alone more than anything. “After you hit 100 they all just blur into old age.”
! (I also take requests and prompts in various fandoms.)
“He’s growling at us, so I say yes,” Pietro replies instead.
“It’s been weeks, Steve, why didn’t you say anything?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That kind of eating! Mhm, didn’t take you for not-so-innocent, Cap, I gotta admit.”
Steve couldn’t help the snort. “Yeah, that always works.”
“Okay. Okay, Steve? Steve, please touch me.”
“Who the fuck is Chloe?” Tony asked with a laugh. “And gimme that,” he said, reaching for Steve’s knee again.
Steve went. He may have done it somewhat on purpose, using one of the small towels available around his hips and strutting out like he wasn’t feeling nervous to hell and back. Tony’s hands landed on his shoulders when he was in reaching distance, staring at his face, then blatantly ogling him. Steve felt oddly like a specimen of sorts, but also judging by Tony’s look, he felt wanted. He ached for more of the man’s touch. When the hand came up to cup his jaw, he leaned into it with a sigh.
Tony chuckled. “That’s hot, you know?”
“You mean almost as goat as Goatzilla,” Steve tried. “Great, now you’ve got me doing it as well.” He passed Bennu to Tony, who was suddenly ridiculously active. “How do you do that?”
Steve rolled his eyes. “The woman who kissed me? Who you’ve been with before? New Year’s?”
He moved away from the podium and for a couple of seconds there was silence. Applause erupted from the general direction of their table. He remembered something then and moved back. The noise stopped and he cleared his throat. “Please! I meant backing up corruption and photos with officials. The free people of this country deserve our appreciation and time. Thank you!”
“No, never,” he said seriously.
“Don’t mention my dad when we’re in bed together. Jesus!”
“And your mouth?”
“With the people there? Captain!” Tony mumbled as he pulled a testicle into his mouth to lick it filthily.
“Very much so.”
“Darling,” Tony whispered. He’d arched his back into Steve’s kisses, moaning as he received occasional tiny nips.
“Bottom drawer to your left, darling. You’ll find lube there, give it to me,” he instructed.
“What?” he growls.
“Of course I am! Oh, I am, aren’t I? I’m sorry, she apologised once more.
Tony pulled it out and back in, moving to suck Steve’s cock again. As spit dribbled out onto Steve’s shaft and down to his balls, he felt
He pouted. “But, Tasha. We’re partners,” he whined. “Remember Monte Carlo?”
“I would,” Steve said in a fake-honest voice. “But they haven’t asked nicely yet, have they?”
“Take on me?” Nat asked between laughing at Clint and drinking.
“It’s Clint, he’ll put up with it.”
He stumbled to the pile of dishes from the previous night and threw himself into washing them almost aggressively. It gave his hands something to do, and his brain a repetitive task that meant he could compartmentalise his anguish. Except there was no compartmentalising to be done, not really. The thoughts bounced around his brain, each interaction making him physically cringe. He had never frowned at anything at much as he did at the frosting covered bowls.
“Yes, light of my life?” He knows he’s playing a dangerous game, annoying Steve like that. He can’t help himself, though. Not really. He’s been waiting, hopeful despite knowing better, for the moment when he’d be able to rile Steve up and the subsequent heated look would lead to more than just shamefully coming all over his fist in the loneliness of his lab at night.
“Oh, yes,” Steve said and patted Ben’s head slowly. “Darcy named it when she was riding around it on her mighty steed.”
“Tony –" he started, but Natasha was quick to interrupt him.
Tony’s eyes narrowed. “You can’t lie to me, ice lolly!” Steve was terrified of that prospect. Tony assessed the situation, then plopped down in between Steve and Bucky. “This is potentially the safest I’ve ever been,” he announced with a smile.
“Shhh, hand it over, there you go, that’s a good Captain, okay now let go, okay? Okay, great, now step back a little? Perfect, thank you.”
He took it with a nod and didn’t even wince when it burned his tongue – it would heal in no time. It was Tony’s good blend, the one he kept for particularly rough days. “Does he know?”
The groan from his side alerted Steve of unwanted presence. He turned and had to suppress the urge to roll his eyes and reach for a shield he didn’t have on.
He stayed quiet about it, kept to himself, smiling at the occasional sound from Bennu. They ended up taking her, of course. What Tony set his mind to do, he did. In a way, Steve wanted to be more like him. More assertive, even if it was a front. Peggy used to tell him all the time he commanded respect because he had this honest face. She used to say that he was stoic. He wondered if she’d shoot at him (again) for being the cause of such a fuck-up. She’d probably shake her head and pour him a drink, then down it when she remembered it had no effect on him.
“It was perfect, darling.” He reached in between them to fondle Steve’s hard cock, then mimicked Steve’s earlier actions by kissing his tear-stained cheeks. “I don’t think I can ever give you up now, Steve.”
Steve turned his upper body to receive the eager man currently licking into his mouth. He held him as they kissed, then ducked slightly under him to kiss his jaw and his neck.
“Please,” the man whispered, hips stuttering as Steve unbuttoned his jeans. “I want you,” he repeated. “Anything you want to give me, I’ll take it. I’m greedy and —
They were dropped off in front of what could easily pass as a sumptuous building of sorts, but to Steve’s artist eye looked at least as garrish as the room back at the hotel. Steel beams and glossy windows stood out in the overwhelming surrounding architecture – a collection of fluid lines and gargoyles, with high windows and wooden frames, with old school roofs and rich gardens. Steve was used to taking in his surroundings for tactical purposes, but at that moment it seemed like a good distraction. They were to be welcomed by some committee of mostly men, suits not fitted properly – and Steve was not one to judge, the ill-fitting suits weren’t the problem. But the people wearing them, strangled by their crooked ties and red in the face as if they had been running up and down trying to seem hard-working. Steve hated it.
“No, I didn’t!”
“I never thought I could touch you like this,” Steve confessed. “I never thought I would be allowed to hold you and,” he licked Tony’s lower lip before initiating another tongue battle in the man’s mouth, ”and kiss you, and make you moan –”
“I’m not exactly great at opening up about this thing. Besides what do I even say? Oh hi guys I’m a bit mental but don’t you worry it’s all under control it’s just that sometimes I get unbearably panicked and I feel like the world is narrowing down around me and then oh and then I feel like I’m freezing but don’t you worry I’m perfectly okay and it’s only when I’m alone and get insomnia oh also I get insomnia but don’t you worry I don’t need sleep anyway and even then sometimes I sleep for fifteen hours and wake up tired but don’t you worry I’m a-okay.”
Natasha caught his eye and raised an eyebrow. She must have known something was up, this was starting to be a recurring thing. In some way, he was always inquiring after Tony, watching over him, agonising over him; it seemed his life and his emotions were revolving around the man, and Nat was not only an excellent observer, but she was also very close to Steve. So it made sense that she would have some sort of idea. But he shook his head and resigned himself to the semi he was currently sporting, and allowed himself to just look at the other man. They were hours away, he was too winded up to sleep, Natasha was busy, and Steve just wanted to sit there and fantasise about swinging an arm around Tony’s shoulders and walking down the street, occasionally turning to kiss his temple. And in between, if he thought about being pressed into the seat and fucked slowly until he had to beg to be allowed to come, well then Steve was completely screwed and he knew it.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Or you could, you know, talk to me like a normal person instead of being irritating and making me want to… I don’t know, but it would involve pain.”
“Yeah, no, Lover Boy. There’s no motivating me, like, ever.”
“I grew up with you, I know where your mind goes when it gets like this,” he offered.
Bucky called bullshit and Steve just ignored it because it was the truth. Whatever breakdown he had to deal with, it could wait until he was in the relative safety of his room back at the tower. Or at least somewhere in the enormity of the building where he could hide and mope until his brain reconstructed itself.
“What happened next?” he asked, twisting his hand on the lower part of Steve’s dick while sucking the tip in earnest.
“No, it’s just cause you seemed to struggle with the shirt and I didn’t - of course you know how to use cufflinks, I’m sorry -”
Pietro:
As if he could be inconspicuous. “What? Yes, of course.” The look he received wasn’t reproachful, but curious. A bit wary maybe. A bit worried. “Everything’s fine,” he rushed to assure his boyfriend.
Natasha:
“I hope she never changes,” he told Steve.
“You adopted her as well?” Rhodey asks, shooting down bots climbing to get to Wanda.
“Okay, okay, we can sort this out. I’ll call the chopper to get you in and out quickly, there’s no way you’re driving to Brooklyn and back in time. And take your clothes with you, if she sees you all dressed up she’ll know.” She looked around to assess the situation. “You all look pretty ready to leave so go downstairs and head off. Tony will meet us there, hopefully at least a bit sober.” She turned to Steve. “That shirt needs cufflinks, come with me.”
Peter had moved in temporarily to help Tony with the new set of prosthetics wheels for Bennu. He had a room in the tower and everything, but he often preferred to go home to spend time with his aunt. Tony’s flirting by proxy was still all over the place regarding May, and Steve did his best to not let it get to him. Most of the time he laughed at Peter’s inability to not cringe, but these days he felt sick every time Tony asked about his hot aunt. He took to caressing Bennu, who quickly became his favourite tower inhabitant. It was perhaps unfair to consider her a service pet of sorts, but she soothed his anxiety somewhat, and she seemed to enjoy the head scratches.
Steve’s internal organs did a
Darcy finally hopped off Thor and sat on Bruce’s lap on the large armchair. “I’ll nap now, horseriding is very tiring,” she informed and kissed him briefly before settling down.
“You have lost a lot of time,” the woman said and reached for his hand. “Can I?”
“What is wrong with you?” and “Are you actually insane Wilson?” and “What’s next, getting him in a bin bag?” and “Pepper, now! Take them away now when he’s not looking!” and Steve was honestly baffled.
“Peachy,” Steve replied, covering his face with his hands. “Maybe you could go without me? I mean, your company invested and Natasha can charm everyone.”
for needing this much. They mocked him for the way warmth bloomed under Tony’s careful caresses. They mocked his feelings for the man, the way he was greedily taking all this pity and turning it into meaningful actions.
He did. On autopilot, driven by the need for release and by the image his mind had conjured of Tony’s throat. The man rolled over, scooted up so his head was falling back off the edge easily. Steve’s knees were weak, but he forced them to cooperate. He wanted it, but he was reluctant. Despite the hyperjump in levels of intimacy, from comforting as friends to handjobs and making out like horny teenagers, Steve felt that perhaps this was pushing it too much.
Natasha shut the door and with that, the light disappeared as well. Steve let his body fall to the side, groaning as he went. Fuck his entire life. Like, hold it by the head and fuck it - no, too soon. He grabbed his phone from the bedside table. Missed calls, messages, 5:07. He could tell them he was unavailable. Some illness, perhaps a cold. Sure, the serum would prevent that, but this cold was special. He had to sleep a lot to overcome it. Yeah, sleep and dream some more. His dick was so hard it was painful. He started to reach down when his phone vibrated in his hand and he shrieked for the second time that morning. Tony. Of course.
Steve turned them both on their sides, shuffling to get them both comfortable. “This is new, I’ve not – not with someone like you – and not with someone I… care so much about.”
Pepper brought their formal wear the day before the charity gala. Steve’s foul mood was grateful that she didn’t insist they tried it on. When he pulled her aside to ask about Tony she rolled her eyes and touched his shoulder softly.
Steve went in determined to thank Tony for being a Good Friend. Instead, he seemed to have lost his brain-to-mouth filter. Which explained why he just told Tony everything he'd been keeping secret for months. Like the fact that he was irrevocably attracted to him.
the smugness in his voice.
side of the bed. “What?” he asked when Tony’s eyes fixated on his torso.
Steve handed him the riffle with a small bow. Psychotic break or not, he cherished every non-conflictual interaction with Tony. He watched as Tony assessed the situation carefully over the top of his sunglasses, then proceeded to shoot every single target row the master gave him. It was done methodically, a clinical detachment that Steve shouldn’t find appealing, but he did nonetheless. The calculated look, the stance, the taut muscles; absolutely beautiful, Steve thought.
you that.”
He seemed reluctant to let go out the goat, but Steve put his arms out and Tony transferred it to him. “Fine! Fine, I’ll do it.” He allowed Steve to shepherd him to the back of an ambulance where he sat down and crossed his arms petulantly. “But I don’t like this. Ah, great.”
“You’re right!”
“Windows,” Steve managed to say as Tony resumed his kisses.
“Out of the question – stay down, Jesus Christ!” Steve shouts at a bot that’s still crawling towards him. There’s a brief respite, so he turns to Tony. Even with the cowl on, the downturned corners of his mouth speak volumes. “Are you trying to get me mad on purpose?” he asks, his voice actually oddly calm.
He went to check on Pietro first. Medical informed him he was going to be okay. He would heal quicker than normal, something to do with the enhancements, but it would still take a couple of weeks of walking with a crutch. Steve knew it was going to be hell for the young man and he promised he would try to help as much as he could. He walked by the lab where Tony was headbanging to some music the soundproofed walls didn’t allow to escape. In the corner, Wanda was fast asleep, covered with a thick blanket and holding on to a t-shirt of Pietro’s. Steve walked away from them, back to the now-dreaded task of decorating. He wished he’d kept his stupid mouth shut about Christmas.
“Well, he’s alive and safe but I really don’t know if he’s okay.” She paused and looked at the floor briefly before focusing on his face once more with renewed determination. “Tony sometimes gets like this. It used to be drunken stupors and sleeping around, then it was putting the suit on and going after some bad guys, nowadays he’s been pretty stable but I don’t know. He’ll be okay, he just needs to be alone for a bit I think.”
It happened extremely quickly. He was pulled away from the bar gently but firmly. He knew to differentiate threatening touches from his teammates’. So he allowed himself to be maneuvered a couple of steps back. As soon as there was more room around him, he felt them close in on him. There was definitely Bucky, Natasha who was chuckling next to his ear, Bruce (even in hindsight he didn’t see that one coming) and Darcy (he definitely saw that one metaphorically running towards him because prank plots always involved Darcy), Thor, and Clint who seemed to coordinate the mayhem. Sam was late to this very invading reunion, but he emerged in between Thor and Darcy and closed in on him quickly.
“Captain?” he heard Sam ask him with a smirk.
“I am fantastic,” Steve said slowly, ridiculously emphasising each word. He was quiet, not wanting for everyone to hear him sarcastically lashing out. “Any more fantastic, and they’ll recruit me as a fifth member. Maybe Johnny’s single this time of the week.”
“Donna Summer,” Tony replied. “It’s called ‘Hot Stuff’ - oh here it is!”
“I’m ready to put on a show,” he added, trying to ignore the hammering of his heart.
Everything in him screams against throwing Steve anywhere near the raging fire. He hears the fire trucks, but it’s clear they won’t be enough. He holds Steve tighter, trying to come up with something. “Platypus! Can you engage the bot to take it to the side?”
“What? Why?”
“Don’t you wanna do your midnight birthday song?” Tony asked.
“Open your mouth, darling.” Steve obeyed instantly. Tony was focused behind the glasses, regarding Steve with both reverence and wickedness, with hope and love and desire.
“Aww, Steve! What about me?”
The entire thing wasn’t great, but it wasn’t Steve’s worst night either. He was still high-strung about the Tony situation, and he wasn’t looking forward to be kissed by another stranger at midnight. While everyone gathered at the windows to welcome the new year, Steve snuck out and trekked up to the helicopter pad with minutes to spare.
“What are you talking about?” he asked looking around the room.
“Stark, he could be yours, that’s how much he’s like you,” Clint laughed.
“I think they’re okay, kid. Come look.”
“Can we count on you to wake us up, Stevie?”
He tried, he really did. But he still found himself rolling his eyes as he replied, “I do fight crime,” he said and regretted instantly. There was no reason to be rude to the old lady.
“Fuck! No, I’d kicked them out – Tony, please!”
“Seriously? You’re going to load up the dishwasher now? This is deja vu. Why are you doing this to me again?”
The implications of what that meant made Steve quiver with anticipation. He should have been embarrassed by the speed with which he located the bottle and returned to Tony, legs bent at the knees, spread wide and shaking. But he was past that. He needed everything Tony wanted to give him.
“No! No Steve what! With your stupid grin and your stupid arms and — glasses? Really, Tony, glasses? When have you started wearing glasses?”
“Change of plans!” Tony said.
The teacups were not the worst idea, but they weren’t the best either. Steve had no problem with speed or motion in general, but his field of vision was blurred by the spinning movement and it didn’t exactly help. The squeals from children were endearing, their fun almost contagious. Or it would have been if Steve hadn’t just ensured months of harassment from the opposing media. And even the supporting media. He figured Bruce would be accomodating in giving him a remote quiet place where he could go and regroup. Or hide forever, why the fuck not?
It was Steve’s turn to burst into laughter. “We could probably make it go viral on youtube or something. We’d get Thor to narrate it. I’d make some snazzy animations for it. It could work!”
“Is this your way of showing support?” he laughed.
“The panic has always been there, Tony. You’ve seen my medical file, you know my history; I’ve always had this feeling of choking, even when the asthma wasn’t that bad. You’re not the reason for my anxiety, I am,” he added.
There was silence for a while. As a collective rule, people close to Tony knew to either not engage him when he was ranting, or engage him enough to a) tire him out (unlikely) or b) bore him until he changed subjects and eventually wandered off. The latter seemed to be the case, especially as he seemed to focus on reading something.
“I just really don’t like trains that much!”
But it worked. A barely contained shiver moved his hand minutely and Tony missed a shot. “You’re playing dirty, Rogers,” he said with a laugh.
“I meant safe from danger, but hello new information. Share,” he told Steve in a commanding voice. “Pretty please?”
Clint:
The groans that follow are endearing. “For fuck’s sake, Stark! What about an EMP?” Clint offers.
“It’s exceptionally engaging and my fast paced mind appreciates it.”
The grip tightened, Tony pulled him even closer. “Come for me.” He spoke on Steve’s lips, right before plunging his tongue deep in Steve’s mouth.
Steve felt himself blush. “I should have known better,” he said. “Diplomacy is not my strongest suit.”
“500 feet?” Clint asked and Natasha lifted her foot to show the realness of her threat. “Okay, okay, just sort it out please. Pepper will get mad if I’m not ready.”
“Well, that’s the most physical I’ve been in ages,” she told them after a quick succession of straight-from-the-bottle tequila shots.
Tony shuddered. “That was a horrible angle for my ballsack. Still trying to make the photo disappear, but there’s this idiot who keeps uploading it.”
attractive. Problem: he found Tony Stark attractive. Gosh, Steve was well happy no one could actually read his mind. They’d either pass out with the sheer stupidity that floated around, or pass out from laughing too much.
Steve felt it everywhere. By now the train was familiar, and he felt like a broken record thinking it over and over again. The entire thing was surreal as fuck. He was involved in a kiss he wasn’t exactly reciprocating while falling in love with Tony
“Hmm, call Clint repeatedly and ask him stupid questions.”
Steve snorted. “It’s not easy.”
“Steve,” Tony whispered, and Steve stopped at once.
Steve couldn’t catch his breath, no matter how much he tried. Almost like asthma, but nowhere near as damning. He focused, one inhale at a time. There was no way he could count, so he did his best to approximate the timing of the gasps. “You’re going to lift the ban, then?” he thought he asked. He couldn’t be sure that it was out loud.
A beat to gather his wits, and the boxers were being pushed off. He stroked himself languidly, moving his knee on the arm of the chair, exposing himself to Tony’s hungry eyes. He could feel the heat on his face, and on his chest under his wandering fingers. “Are you curious about what I’ve got in the box?” His voice was huskier than he’d anticipated, unable to help the little breathy moan.
“Tony?”
Tony smiled. He squeezed Steve’s hand. “I know.”
“Steve?”
“Tony.”
Steve was cold. He was tired - exhausted, actually, and on top of feeling cold because of that, he was
“Shh, you’re okay,” Tony encouraged. He had moved – Steve honestly had no idea when – to sit on the edge of the coffee table. “Take it easy, Steve. Fuck that’s so hot, you’re so hot. Touch your cock for me, darling.”
“Stop fucking around and check on the twins. Vision and Sam are covering us, you’re the only one that’s got eyes in the sky!”
“As often as I can,” came the reply.
thing. And yes, it could be hurtful not to have actual family around this time of the year, but Steve thought a surrogate was better than nothing. So they’d all gather round, watch crappy holiday movies, drink and eat, and just do newly-regular things. He’d never properly had that. Besides, it would be Thor’s first real celebration. Not to mention the twins – yes, they came from a different culture, but the sentiment was genuine. And he knew for a fact Vision interrogated Clint about the true meaning of the holiday, so at least he was curious, if not excited.
He kept hearing Tony’s harsh words, then Tony’s protests towards the t-shirts that fit better, then what he thought was some sort of friendly flirting, and it took forever for him to actually manage to sleep. When the knock came on his door, Steve felt like it was too soon, and grunted his dismissal. Much later, when he finally got up and showered, his head hurt in a way it only did when there was a physical injury. He wondered if it was actually a memory of the headaches he used to get before the serum. It was close to noon when he emerged from his room, and his stupid fast metabolism reminded him that it needed food and it needed it soon.
She laughed, however, and pulled Steve’s hand closer, holding it almost tenderly. “There is darkness around you, Steve Rogers.” She frowned, her cloudy blue eyes losing their shine. “There is darkness, then there is light. You will face a great trial.”
“A-ha!”
“Christmas was another one,” he panted. “I wanted to give us family time and I wanted to give you a perfect present – ah! Tony,” he whined impatiently.
He heard them talk quietly, but focused on tasks he set for himself. It was uncommon for him to be this moody and this grumpy and this everything, really, but it seemed that ever since Natasha’s birthday, Tony had a horrendously large impact on his mind. Anxiety wasn’t new to Steve, neither were self-doubt, lack of confidence, and overthinking. His mind was loud on good days, and his brain worked better when he had to actively focus.
“Darling,” Tony whined. “Have I not been good to you?”
“Pepper, just take the damn things away and we’re all going to be okay!” Tony shouted and Steve reacted by holding his new clothes tighter.
Steve was not rude. He absolutely wasn’t. In the war he had to gently fend off affection from heart eyes girls who thought he was God’s gift or something. The propaganda machine worked, and they were disillusioned by how the world portrayed Captain America. Steve was terrified of them. He was also not rude, but he was rapidly reaching the end of his patience.
and his thoughts overwhelming. When Natasha suggested they go in the teacups, he gladly accepted. The impending breakdown would have to wait until New York, at least. Even longer, if he could put it off. Longer, perhaps he could take a roadtrip on his bike and cry in a tent in the woods or something.
Peter laughed. “I’m immune, Mr. Barton, told you.”
“Show me,” Tony whispered. “Please, darling.”
He welcomed the relative quiet and solitude while he tried to command his thoughts to re-enter some sort of order. He went to run his hands through his hair and of course he’d forgotten and watched the man he was suddenly aware he was attracted to deepthroating a jell-o dick while wearing a plastic tiara. Because being frozen for seventy years wasn’t ridiculous enough. He uselessly drank some more.
Steve rolled his eyes, willing the beast that was somersaulting in his stomach to calm the fuck down. “That’s cause you’re rich.”
Tony laughed. “Could you, though?”
Tony:
“Yes, please,” Steve hurried to add. He chose to ignore the wet lisp in his voice.
The man stopped. “Yeah, sorry. I’ll be good, I did say we don’t have to do anything more than kiss.” He moved back up to mouth at Steve’s jaw. “I want you to be comfortable with me, darling.” It was the first time he’d called him that since the change their dynamic occurred. Steve moaned loudly, arms tightening around him. “Oh.”
“Thanks, Mr. Thor,” Peter said, then realised he had been loud. “Sorry,” he whispered.
Steve kissed him. Hard. His hand lowered to thumb at the man’s hip bone. “You’re perfect. Beautiful,” he said, and traced his nose with his forefinger. Then his brow, the fine lines around his eyes. Tony’s leg curled around his waist, bringing their hips together. They moaned together at the brief contact.
people had it much worse. They at least had the option to go away and be anonymous in their own way, in some remote area. He suggested it once, in passing, and the aftermath had not been great. They all insisted that temporary relocation to the Compound was ill-advised. Especially Bucky, who had always had a knack for knowing when Steve’s mind got loud. He had spoken out, then others nodded their approval, and that was it. He was to stay in New York, to avoid getting too into his own head. It was heartwarming, how much they wanted to protect him, but it was also painful that he couldn’t go regroup alone.
Tony laughed. “Yeah, I found it appropriate. Everyone’s got a different tune so I know who it is when they enter.”
Steve nodded. “You’re right, I know you’re right.”
Bucky had taken to leaning on the door frame, same smug look on. “Don’t stop on my account, guys.”
“Steve?” Tony called from the opposite side of the room.
In between giggles, Tony finally finds wiggle room to intervene. “Leave him alone, guys. Doom interrupted our date.”
“I have cat treats, they’re all around me. I am the cat lord. Also, fuck you, Nat.”
“Think you can win, Tasha?”
Steve had about two seconds to pull the duvet around his midsection in hopes of covering his erection. Tony barged in and zoned in on the bed. When that came out empty, he looked around and eventually his eyes settled on the pile of Steve on the floor.
“Oh,” Steve sighed. Of course he’d be too much and too soon and –
“Okay, so nine minutes, huh?”
The flight back was uneventful. Natasha took phone calls and emailed Maria Hill and Pepper back and forth. He didn’t mean to pry, but he got up to stretch and accidentally read bits of what it said. There were not-so-nice words from three of the fiercest women he had ever known and he felt guilty – guilt was not an unknown feeling for Steve. He’d felt it every single time someone got hurt, involved in the same battles as him or not. If civilians across the globe got injured, he’d feel guilty. Rationally, he was aware of his inability to protect everyone, but he resented it more than anything. So when he noticed others having to deal with the consequences of his actions, his heart sunk. He would rather get beaten up for days than inconvenience anyone.
If Steve was more conceited, he could have sworn Bruce said “I know he’s hot”, but he refused to accept it. He urged them all to keep shredding wrapping paper and they mercifully agreed. He caught Tony’s eye for a second and was left confused about what the scowl on his teammate’s face meant. There was a distinct annoyance in the way Tony stared at the t-shirts. Steve moved on to unwrap a cologne from Natasha and a foldable easel that had his initials brutally carved on the side. He could recognise Bucky’s ugly handwriting everywhere.
For a split second, Steve’s determination fades, but he gets back with the program as soon as they hear a large crash in the distance. He quickly assessed the situation. “There’s a large group of people in the basement of that building,” he points. “Take Pietro there, I’ll help Wanda. You two, stay with the civilians, do crowd control, shout if you need help.”
He lifted his head to look his oldest, best friend in the eyes. “Fuck off, Buck.”
It dawns on him, a sign that perhaps he’s closer to being at least a tiny bit in control. A thought that is clear and useful and that he can actually mould. It takes mere seconds and he’s out of the suit, leaving him back with Barnes. And he’s running, the air breathable again, even if his spit is thickened with concrete dust and bile. Bucky could catch him, but Bucky wasn’t cruel and Bucky knew he had to do this.
“Tony,” Steve sighed when the man switched to his other nipple before kissing down to his abs and then dipping to nibble on his hip bone. “Please.”
Tony snorted and offered Bruce a glass of bourbon. “Yeah, no,” he said, repeating Darcy’s words. “On the right track though, so props.”
“Who teaches you these things?” Tony can’t help his laugh. “Chop chop, let’s go! Rhodey!” he tries again.
Steve had already mouthed at the cotton candy and was in the process of enjoying more. “I do?” he asked, mouth half-shut with the stickiness.
“Absolutely.”
“Fuck. Okay, up, up!”
“I’ll take the leash off now, is that okay?
(See the end of the chapter for
“That would just be counterproductive,” he deadpanned.
Tony:
“Oh my god! Please! I need you to suck my cock! There, are you happy now? Please!”
“This one had Friday redirect all non-essential calls to us –”
“Gosh, you’d think after the world’s longest foreplay, you’d rush into it a bit,” he said.
“Mhm.” Steve kissed his lips gently, enjoying the way Tony seemed to unravel the more they deepened their kiss.
The first thing he noticed was that things weren’t familiar. The setting of the room wasn’t familiar, and neither were the sheets he could feel under his back. It was perhaps odd to have such a strong sense of familiarity towards bedding, but Steve was adamant those weren’t his sheets. They were smoother and upon a second look, a baby blue he wasn’t accustomed to.
Tony lands next to him. “I’m trying to win us this fight,” he counters. He’s moderately irked by the whole exchange. It isn’t even that Steve’s questioning his ways,
“Tony,” he moaned warningly.
“Add another one.” He moved to rest his elbows on his knees. “Lube and add another one.”
“Real mature,” Tony accused. But he moaned nonetheless as Steve nuzzled his cock through his boxers. “You look good enough to eat, anyway. Who needs dinner?”
“Nat, please just shoot me instead. In the right ear, clean through the other side, done. Peace and quiet,” Steve asked rubbing at his tired eyes.
“Ah, that’s because I want to seduce you and I’m still in awe at the fact that you want me. I need to keep you interested.” If he were honest, there was a modicum of real worry behind his words.
Just like that, all memories seemed to pour into his poor brain at once. Steve remembered
Steve couldn’t help himself. He scooped some of the come on Tony’s stomach and lifted his fingers so he could taste it. It was slightly bitter, but Steve found he didn’t mind at all. He licked his fingers clean, unaware of how Tony was looking at him. “What?” he asked eventually. “Oh,” he said, and blushed, fingers still in his mouth.
There’s a second of silence. Of complete silence, he thinks perhaps he’s gone deaf.
Tony’s face took on a panicked expression. “Oh, no. No no no no no! Fuck the cupcakes, we can throw the cupcakes out.”
“Great minds and all that,” he heard, and even if he didn’t know all aspects of that voice already, the way his heart soared made it all clear.
“Don’t be an asshole,” Steve heard Natasha say right as the door slammed behind him.
“Guys!” Clint’s voice is a bit exasperated, which is inherently amusing, as much as it makes Tony an asshole for finding it so.
“You can let go, Wanda. Thank you! Go get stitched up and have some rest,” he told her.
Tony scoffed. “That’s my cue to leave. Gonna go see a man about a stuffed sheep for this guy I know,” he said with a laugh and walked away while Steve tried his hardest not to follow.
“Fuck me,” Tony told him, parting those sinful lips to receive him.
Clint interrupted their little spat. “Okay, okay, enough. Show of hands if you wanna suck fake dicks for Natasha’s birthday. She’s obviously gonna do it so we might as well show some solidarity…”
“What HR? We don’t have a functioning HR department!” Vision’s exasperation is clear, but so is the amusement behind it.
“Not yet,” Tony said, and he was back to rimming him. His tongue hot and wet as it slid inside him mercilessly. And when he moved away, he was mouthing at his balls, sucking one in his mouth, then the other. Sloppy kisses everywhere he could, at the base of his cock, up the shaft. And in an instant he had Steve in his throat, three fingers deep inside him, prodding at his prostate insistently.
. His eyes welled up. Yes, Tony had assured him it had been fine, but what if it hadn’t? He felt arms snake by his sides, behind his shoulder blades, and pulling him close.
“Yeah, I get that,” she said and stifled a yawn.
Bucky let go of his side of the tree to go stand next to Natasha. Surprised by it, Thor dropped the thing and stumbled forward. The threat of the god squashing the otherwise sturdy branches was real, and Steve found himself shouting along the others. Salvation came from the door frame, where Wanda was literally working her magic to stop both the tree from certain doom, and the Avenger from falling. It resulted in him being suspended in mid air, and the tree surrounded by a protective bright red shield. For a moment, Steve could have kissed her in gratitude. Then he really looked at her.
“Common thing, I wouldn’t worry about it too much.” He walked around for a bit, inspecting the worn carvings on the furniture. “Is this a sixties spy movie though? What do you think, Cap? Feeling the Soviet oppression looming yet?”
“Would it be hard to believe there was a horse? Our washing machines sing ‘Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?’ when we put them on,” he whispered.
“Nuh-uh,” Tony protested. “I waited for you and it’s your turn, darling.”
Steve pulled him close, smiling at the way Tony melted against his naked torso. “Fine, I’ll
“I’ll ground you first,” Steve tells him, accusing finger poking at his chest. There’s a shadow of a smile in the corner of his mouth, so he can’t be that pissed off.
Steve wanted to not be creeped out. But Steve had been surrounded by horrors his entire life, one way or another. “Will we succeed?” he found himself asking.
“Yes,” she replied simply. “I am. Go back to the designated area or I’ll move you there. Hi, David!”
“Please please please, we’re bored and you’re our friend,” Tony insisted. “Are you asleep already? Steve? Steve? Steve!”
He was unable to make out if what he remembered were actual memories or fabricated ones. At times, it felt he was so fixated on that exact moment and the immediately following ones, that his brain could have supplied them in an attempt to pacify the restlessness regarding that particular gap.
“Oh my fucking God! Oh my God, I can’t deal with you, I just can’t. You cannot physically be this beautiful, you can’t.”
“I was determined to wait longer, but you’re so inviting. Look at you,” he said, and dived in to take one of the balls in his mouth.
Manual labour had always been Steve’s go-to when he was overwhelmed mentally. When he was tiny, he did chores around the house to keep busy. Simple things like dusting and doing the dishes. He used to water all the plants in his building, stopping after every floor before he could start wheezing. So helping move debris was a blessing. The more he worked, the more his mind stayed focused on the task at hand, the more he could ignore the dread looming over him.
“We can probably put a small arc reactor in it, maybe even make it sing,” Tony confirmed. “Come to my lab some time, we’ll talk,” he said and nodded at Steve. “Thanks for my mug, Darce,” he added, using both hands to hold on to the huge mug. It had bad drawings of the Avengers and it was absolutely glorious.
As soon as they joined the others at the bar downstairs, Steve knew something was off. Not in an impending attack way, but in a someone-left-a-banana-peel-outside-your-room-oops way. He naturally turned to Natasha to assess the situation. But Natasha was smiling ominously, and Steve was suddenly a lot more concerned.
The man regarded her for a couple of seconds before reclining back in his seat and sighing. “I shouldn’t have let you work in legal,” he replied, a note of wistfulness in his voice.
Someone is calling his name.
“Was it
Bucky nodded. “You’ve missed out, pal. Same with alcohol.”
When Steve finally entered the room, he was still on the phone, his shirt wonky and half-buttoned, and his shoes in his other hand. “No, Mrs. Williams - Marjorie, of course. Yes, I know we’re almost the same age. I promise it’s not a problem - no other plans. I’ll start making my way now, yes of course I still have the key. Great, don’t worry, I’ll be with you shortly.”
“I will not be removed from this scene! Keep filming, David!”
He was about to open his mouth to impart some sarcasm, now truly a common occurrence, as they liked reminding him. They said Tony rubbed off on him, and really they should know better than to open the door so widely for crudeness and innuendos. But there was something in the way Tony said “ban”, a nuance of familiarity that dawned on him seemingly out of nowhere. It had been months since that surreal first day — he’d say “time” instead, but then he’d be stuck internally debating which of the first times that was. So he’d settled on the first day right after waking up with broken ribs and a fucked up clavicle, rabidly searching his surroundings for Tony. But still the word brought him back, and that’s how the penny dropped.
“Marry me,” Tony blurts as he circles his arms around Steve’s chest, entwining his fingers under the shield Steve holds in front of his chest.
“It’s new alright,” Tony agreed and peeled the protective film covering the screen in one swift motion.
“Da, Russian! Are you also Russian? Because if you are you should… get a move on,” she finished in her regular accent, laughing hysterically.
“Half,” he gritted out as Tony leaned in, lips a ghost touch over his needy cock.
There was barely enough concentration left to do so. His fingers were the opposite of nimble and he fumbled through the movement, but soon the leather was off. He was fully shaking now, tense, desperate to come but desperate to wait. The return of blood flow was vicious, wonderful. “Let me come, please! Please, I need to – touch me, let me come,” he babbled.
Steve could recognise the uncomfortable twitch in Tony’s temple. “I guess that’s okay,” he sighed in a fake casual voice. “Come here,” he smiled eventually. He pulled Tony up, on top of him. “Tony, we don’t
“Not try to spend time with me unchaperoned, for one.”
“I’ve been telling you about how rude your ass is for years!”
“I know absolutely no one who would suffer from that more than you. The way you get on those self-righteous lectures of yours. Honestly, three days might not be enough punishment. Why not a week? Is there coffee? Did you pack coffee for the road? Sighing does not construe effective communication.”
“Like the one we have in the kitchen, right?”
“Think you can take me?” It was a compulsion, Steve gathered, and that was the only explanation he was willing to accept.
“Keep going.”
“What?” Steve asked gently.
Thor:
“Oh, you mean my added presence in this room didn’t cure your boredom? Are you not entertained?” Steve asked mockingly.
“Sure. So earlier this evening you were just thinking? You know, when Barnes had to drag you out of the room and you were practically hyperventilating?” The voice was strained to stay calm, and Steve was painfully aware he was fucking up again.
“Tony…”
“Steve, I’m Tony Stark, I’ve never had a spending limit,” he said and sipped his freshly poured coffee. “Now hand it over and let me see.”
“I know what it stands for! What videos?”
“Yeah, it’s me! Hi! Do you think you can move? Slow steps, no hurry.”
Steve was leaking on his own stomach, his dick hard and needy. “I’m running out of ways to say please, Tony,” he said, annoyance shining through the breathy voice.
He had a soft expression on as he looked back at Steve. He was bouncing on his heels again, fidgeting with his glasses and shuffling his feet every now and then. “I want to kiss you again,” he informed Steve.
The old woman still held his arm in her tight grip. “Come Captain,” she said, consonants harsh and lips pulled in a tight smile. “Come.”
“Thank you so much. I owe you one,” Steve said and hung up.
Every “darling” and “I got you” echoed in his head, raced through to his heart and settled there uneasily. It felt amazing to be held, to be protected. Steve had always been a tactile person, but circumstances made it so that it had been a long time since it happened. Even more so by someone he had such a connection with.
“Where does the General keep his armies?”
“Shit,” Steve whispers, and he signals Tony to take off by moving his fingers up on the forearm of the suit and holding on tight.
“That’s not a word, Steve.”
“You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve seen all week,” Tony announced.
“Just go!”
Steve laughed. “I value my life. Wouldn’t want to insult you.”
Clint:
“What, no apron?” Tony asked as he circled Steve slowly. He sighed as he settled his hand on Steve’s left hip, turning to pull him in an embrace.
“Okay,” Steve assured him. “So okay.” He was still cold, despite the layers covering him.
“Like, yeah,” Steve parrotted.
Steve nodded, wiping the drying come from Tony’s skin. “Let me get you clean first.” He wiped his own abdomen, then stretched before moving to climb over Tony to get to
“Okay…”
“Orders first.”
Steve frowned. “Why New Jersey?”
Tony’s hands were magical, Steve thought. They were warm and large, and most importantly, relentless in their soothing. He didn’t want to fall asleep, where he couldn’t even attempt to control his thoughts.
Vision is carrying an exhausted Wanda away. He feels bad for the kid, but he’s so grateful. Thor’s lightning fall relentlessly. There really seems to be no end to the incoming bots. He wonders where Doom finds the motivation to be so shit. Tony gets bored of things really quickly. Even grudges bore him after a while. Perhaps not this particular grudge that he now has on Doom for ruining his nice time with Steve.
“Dude,” Clint said from his other side, “wouldn’t that be a lot like touching yourself?”
He washed his face and back of the neck in silence, words upon words echoing in the back of his head. Regret filled his entire body and would not let go no matter how much he tried to shake it. He went to tap on dial for Bucky’s number, but if he heard his oldest friend’s voice there was no stopping his breakdown. And there were more things to do, more face to save, more backbone behind chastising words that needed support.
“What afterlife? Why?” Tony asked with a laugh.
“Magic word?”
He suspected he’d passed out. It couldn’t have been long, he gathered. When he opened his eyes and looked up, Tony was watching him affectionately. “Hi,” he said shyly.
“Among other things, yeah.”
Natasha:
“Yeah, look! He’s got the exasperated look on. Is his eyebrow twitching?”
“Yes,” Steve replied honestly. “A lot.”
Tony’s laugh had transcended regular amusement and had turned into ugly guwaffing, which Steve found annoyingly endearing. But he would, the big idiot, because why would he not have a crush on the world’s most
Jane put both her hands up, Maria joined her with one. Darcy’s finger lift up. Thor put one of his hands up and the other snaked around Jane’s shoulders. Steve couldn’t even begin to think about their sex life. Mostly because it was wrong to give it that much thought, but also because he wouldn’t even know where to start. To his surprise, Bucky put his hand up.
“No, where have you been all my life?”
It wasn’t the silence that was uncomfortable, it was Steve’s remorse at breaking down to that extent. “I wanna tell you. I do.” He slouched down further, feeling like he caved in on himself. “Can I have a blanket or something? I feel like I’m naked.”
“Just go sort out the drinks, I’ll be done here in a minute,” he tried for reason.
Steve didn’t know what he wanted to punch more: himself, Tony, Howard, the universe, himself (he deserved to be on the list twice for the sheer stupidity he exhibited), or fourteen reinforced bags. Of course Tony had some sort of thing with her before, why the fuck would that not be the case? And of course he remembered every stupid detail about the scientist, because why the fuck would he not be pathetic?
“Up to Tony’s, yeah? Shh!”
He wants to get Steve to hold the shield up and do another reflective strong beam. They’d rehearsed it before, it works well, and the number of enemies asks for it. Steve’s arm is pulled back and he looks ready to launch the shield again.
Tony smiled. “You wanna tell me about it? I want to know whatever it is that can make you blush like this.”
“What, you think this will only take five hours?”
“Bossy! You should order us around more often, Cap,” Tony offered.
“Oh my god, surely you can’t be serious.”
“Yeah, it’s my middle name,” he told them seriously.
“Uhm, yes? Hello, have we met?”
“Your mouth, Steve — your mouth is so beautiful, look at you, God, I wish you could see yourself right now.” The more Steve took into his mouth, the more vocal Tony became. “I’ve been staring at those lips of yours… thinking of how they’d look wrapped around my dick… And hearing your voice in my ear all those times… fuck, yes!”
“Aye!”
Tony’s breath was right in his ear. “Happy birthday, Steve,” he whispered.
” Steve was aware he was kind of shouting at this point but he couldn’t do anything about it.
Truth or Dare was not Steve's first idea of fun, especially when he couldn't get drunk, but his people had the puppy eyes and he couldn't resist them. Add a wet dream to overthink about, some flirting, a couple of dares and oh, shit.
Life shouldn’t have gone back to normal, Steve was perfectly aware of this. But it had, as much as normal could be when he had to live with the ever-present thought pushed in the back of his mind that he was attracted to his teammate. It was like a permanent wound that wouldn’t heal, and Steve knew the comparison wasn’t right, but it was what it was. Weeks went by with minimum danger of the train incident repeating. He didn’t make a conscious effort to avoid the man, not even on the very following day.
“Helpful, do you come here often?”
The problem wasn’t the movie itself. The movie was just fine, funny at times and entertaining to watch. The problem was Steve and his flashes of panic, building up in his chest every time some imagery of lava and fire came on screen. Not even Tony rummaging in the bowl on his lap could take his mind off it. It was impossible for him to control the thoughts invading his mind, particularly the ones about Tony being in danger of burning alive. He made it through somehow, clenching his jaw and his fists, focusing on his breathing. At some point Tony asked if he was okay, and he nodded because opening his mouth to reply would have been dangerous.
The fifth time Steve was left speechless by how attractive Tony was, he was furiously wiping tears off his face. It hit his chest like an explosion, and it hurt just as much. It wasn’t even a matter of attractiveness anymore, not really. He opened his mouth and stayed like that, unable to form words and push them out.
Natasha opened the window slightly. “We could… throw our phones, stay here, overthrow  the government, jail all the corrupt politicians. They already like us, Steve wouldn’t let us get too mental, the tv shows aren’t
“Looks like our dear Captain found himself a belle of the ball!” Tony’s voice boomed in the room, followed by pearly laughter everywhere.
Dr. Pavlova smiled at him. “We watched the live feed from the meeting. I’ve got at least ten colleagues who want to shake your hand. You did some good here already.”
“It’ll be fine, Cap, you worry too much. Here, shopping list. Hide everything in your room, we can’t order online, she’ll know. Thanks!”
The man nodded, sipping from a mug of his own. Steve could smell coffee. “Was it about the ice?”
“Bruce?”
“Also your bed smelled like you, I don’t understand how that’s possible,” Tony continued absentmindedly. “God, I hate Amaretto, I feel like something crawled in my throat and died there.”
“I can fix the suit,” he offers, knowing it won’t go down well.
“You have wet dreams about me?” Tony asked, smirk now present on his face.
Nat put her hands out. “They need help with some debris, if you wanna help, Cap.”
“Plate,” he said quietly to Tony, whose head snapped up looking around frantically.
“Yeah, I know. I’m worried maybe you don’t think I’m actually into you. And I’m having trouble finding ways to tell you, but I’m gonna try.”
It was pointless.
He must have dozed off because he came to suddenly aware of the clattering sound in the lab. To his horror, he realised the sound was coming from him - his teeth were chattering loudly. The cold hit him all at once, on every inch of his skin and deep under it to his very soul.
. The sound of the elevator doors made Steve’s heart race.
He managed to gently dislodge the woman. He could hear the crowd cheering, Tony speaking, the woman speaking, his teammates speaking. Steve couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t comprehend anything that was being said anymore, and he couldn’t breathe. God damn it, this was just like before the serum, when his asthma was horrible. This must have been it, his asthma was probably back. Steve thought he could feel his body shrink as the effect of the serum wore off, because this was the only explanation that made sense. He was reverting back to small pathetic asthmatic Steve. If he thought he had no chance with Tony before, this was just a whole new level of impossible.
Steve pushed another bead in and the pressure on his prostate was glorious. He was reluctant, but he trusted Tony even when he didn’t trust himself. He gripped the base of his cock; he had to bite his lip to shift his focus. “Tony, please,” he whined. But his fingers seemed to have a mind of their own, and he pulled two of the beads out. The pull on his rim grounded him. He had to let go of his cock.
“A light alloy, tiny bearings - it’s similar to this one’s arm,” he explained, nodding towards Bucky. “They can start a band.”
“If you’d be so kind.”
The man had taken his t-shirt off, glass long forgotten. He had unbuttoned his jeans, and was running his fingers on the skin above the waistband. Every now and then he let them dip lower, but his sole focus was Steve. “What do you need, darling?”
Steve had his face buried in his hands, shaking with laughter, embarrassment, potential minor crying, and sheer care for the giant idiot that was Tony Stark. Natasha was hitting her thigh repeatedly, trying to tap on the call button between high pitched laugh noises.
“Tony.”
Steve was presented with a water bottle and he downed it in one go. Then he sighed. “Thank you,” he managed in a small voice.
“I would like to go home soon. Are you okay? Do we need to send a search and rescue team in there?”
On the stage, a voice called for attention. The prime-minister was far from being calm but he was restraining himself as much as he could. “After an… enlightening speech, I invite you all up for the official photo. We will then continue with our planned schedule that includes a visit to the National Carnival, the most authentic experience our proud country has to offer. Thank you!”
“No.” He paused. “Maybe?” He threw his free hand up in resignation. “Okay, yeah, I needed to know and neither of you would tell me anything, so…”
“You okay?” Tony asked not looking up. When there was no reply, he searched for Steve’s face. “Cap, you need to let it go, darling. It’s not as bad as you think. If anything, they’ll sing you songs of praise for not being me. You’re an icon, when you get real it means a lot to people.”
“Uh, yes? Have you not been listening to me?”
They can see the telltale signs of fire in the distance, south of their position, lighting up the sky and what looks to be an entire block. “You ready, Cap?”
Tony was next to him now, whispering above his cheekbone, right next to his ear. Almost touching him. It tickled and burned. “You can come now, my love. As soon as you start I promise, I promise I’ll touch you. You want that, Steve, don’t you? Go on, come for me!”
“I didn’t mean to wake you up, I’m sorry. What is?”
Steve was so familiarised with the feeling of being hit by a train at this point, he was rationalising it the best he could. But curiously, instead of being speechless, as it had happened before, he found himself shaking with how much he wanted to tell Tony
Steve laughed. “Yes,” he said.
“Come here.” He pulled Tony close and kissed the dip of his waist. He rubbed his cheek on the man’s hip, going to unbutton his trousers.
“Oh. True. Then let me change that answer: maybe, given how this goes.” He winked, though, a grateful smile blooming on his face, and Steve thought maybe he wouldn’t say no regardless of how it went. “Now get on with it, show me some skin!”
Steve was many things, including a savage from time to time, but he was not rude. He held her hand and spun her slowly, whistling in admiration. “You look absolutely beautiful, Pepper,” he said and kissed her knuckles softly.
Bucky laughed. “You already started to sound like him.”
“Yeah, that’s closer to the truth, I reckon,” she said and Steve wanted to understand what was happening but he also wanted to find this photo and maybe make it his wallpaper.
He needed a stiff drink. It was hardly the first time the need arose, and he was perfectly aware he couldn’t get drunk, but it was more the sharp pinch of the alcohol on his tongue, the soothing way it burned its way down his throat that he wanted. It was anchoring in a way few things were. Fighting was one of those things, but Natasha was terrifying, and this
Steve couldn’t voice  it. He wanted to, but it seemed that for all the over-sharing he’d done, he couldn’t delve back into it. “The… Uh…”
As far as Fury was concerned, there were no collateral victims, and very little repairs needed to the tower surroundings. The tower itself had seen better days, but nothing they couldn’t sort out quickly if the threat of not having electricity permeated their lives.
“What? I’ve been making moon eyes at your for months, everyone and their mother knows. Oh my God, I literally can’t stop talking. You know the whole go big or go home, but I am already home, this is home because you’re here and you’re my home now. And so is Bucky, but I don’t have wet dreams about goddamn James Buchanan Barnes so I might as well go big and —“
, that he wants to wake up next to
Good God, if Tony had inherited Howard’s mannerisms that made him a chatty drunk sometimes, Steve would actually cry. “What’s that?”
“I got off the phone, we’ve got a vet coming in to check on our new goat,” she informed them, effectively changing the subject. Steve breathed again.
Freight train.
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’m sure you have your suit bracelets on. I could just push you. No one would know. Who would believe the righteous Captain America threw Tony Stark off a roof?”
“Asshole,” Tony agreed, and turned to Natasha. “Go on, truth or dare?”
“Okay. Okay, so this is happening. But how?”
He headed to Tony’s lab as soon as he made sure Wanda was not hurt. It was uncharacteristically quiet, even if the lights were on. He used his access code and endured the accompanying song that played when he entered - Steve still didn’t know what he was, and he always had more pressing matters than to find it afterwards. Tony wasn’t in there; he had half expected to see him on the corner sofa that was more comfortable than anything Steve had ever slept on. In fact, Steve could easily sit down for a bit. And he could even recline and maybe just fall asleep for a couple of minutes. The last thing he saw was the hole in the ceiling, the rubble on the floor, and with an affectionate “Fuck’s sake, Stark,” he fell asleep.
