“I know. I think Karen has been spending way too much time with Spidey and it’s showing.”
“Because before the magic snap, I was sterile. You can’t suffer Palladium poisoning without some long-term side effects. But the purple ass hole fixed my sperm count, so here we are. Which leads us to number one because my biggest regret is us being so in pieces we couldn’t stop the purple ass hole from wiping out half of all life.” Tony confessed.
Linda Bear: We will be fine. I’m making 4 times the old salary and the kids love their new rooms at my client’s house. Send me a text message when you're back. Love you.
Nomad: I’m glad you guys fixed things. Or rather, that you’re really trying to fix things.
Love: Is Slingshot Stark’s assistant?
Purple Arrow: That didn’t happen here.
Hunter: I don’t know why you need me to do that. She’ll be happy. There's something else, isn't there?
I received a very interesting inheritance from my Aunt Peggy. I have dozens and dozens of diaries with the type of stuff that the CIA probably would like to burn. Half of it's in code and a lot of it is written in some combination of French, German, Spanish and English. Good thing I know most of those languages. So it turns out that you were the last in a long string of attempts to murder my father for the sake of the cult of Hive.
Ana Jr.: The cafeteria where you were at this morning is an option. You should be warned that your grandparents are back at the cafeteria currently talking about you. Simmons actually likes you, and so does Hunter.
Me: Did you consider doing that when they were beating the hell out of each other?
Me: I’m sure Ross and his underlings are too dumb to find it anyway.
Me: At least the ones that don’t involve nudity. Like I said, we spent a lot of time figuring out what to do about Benjamin. We are recommending training, but it’s going to be up to her. No, I probably won’t be arrested. Neither do I think that she’s going to put Benji out on the street. However, I’m going to have to get her the biggest shoe basket ever, but I think we’ve reached a consensus on that. I hope.
To be continued.
Tony: It must be hard, catching up on decades of pop culture.
Me: I’m aware. Do you think anything is going to actually happen to Ross?
“I’m not Aida.” Friday – – Afia argued. “First, Tony never treated me like a thing but almost as a child.”
Me: I assume that Leo just showed up with Hunter.
Red phone: image 1 attached, image 2 attached, image 3 attached
Cousin Q: I can’t tell you.
Cuddle bunny: Oral skills???
BITC: Oh shit!
Tony: No way. Happy is 100% heterosexual. He doesn’t see me that way, sugar.
Cuddle fiancé: Yes.
Me: Your fiancé is fine. Lots of hugging and crying. Nobody’s punched anybody yet. Although Steve has been called a punk repeatedly. Steve is currently getting to know Barnes’s new friend Polly. I would love to know how those two met.
Anthony: Or you feared. BTW, I know you asked Friday to keep an eye on me, but there’s no point. I have not dived headfirst into the nearest bottle of Jack, Jim, or José. Nor have I gone to the nearest bar or club to pick up a Jack, Jim, or José for a post breakup rebound fuck.
HSBF: You’re already in the car?
“You don’t get that many second chances and maybe it does seem like sometimes the universe is against you, but you shouldn’t use that as an excuse to keep this to yourself.”
Agent L. Barton: Not one I can tell.
Tony: Which I should probably duplicate on our side when I get home.
Me: Before or after your TV appearances?
“So, if your 12-year-old draws a picture of me dying wearing a gauntlet, it doesn't mean anything?”
Steve: How do you feel about that?
“Her cousin Daisy is with Thor and Loki right now. So, we are concerned." The Princess explained.
Me: I'm aware, and I stopped using it after I search for parasailing.
Me: Exactly.
I’m so glad the meeting switch to Tuesday. I would love it if you could come up Monday, so we can strategize. They’re probably going to try to lock me out because of the wedding rumors. I hate the board so much.
HSBF: Shit!
Me: Yep. She told him that she was pissed at Stark for him stealing her boyfriend and wanted to get back at him. They believed her until the Cavalry literally showed up.
“Which is good because Thanos and his factions managed to destroy several blocks anywhere near an Avenger in the other timeline,” MJ remarked, looking up from her Stark pad.
Tony: So last question and then Yo-Yo is going to force me to eat a bagel or something.
Nomad: You’re doing well, Tony. Today is your 52rd day of sobriety
To be continued
Counselor Laura from 2023: I don't even know why we're here when the AIs can just talk to each other.
“Thank you.”
Hunter has never said no to a little harmless fun, but whatever is going on between would be more than that. There is also him finally letting go of Bobbi for good and Leo doing the same with his Simmons. And let us not forget about dealing with the after effects of sexual assault by LMD. He’s still furious at his future self for the love floppy joke.
Nomad: I miss you too.
HSBF: Oh God. I should’ve realized that with all the talk about Tijuana Bibles. OK, that’s definitely not going in the public version.
Nomad: Whenever Friday will schedule it.
I’m not happy that your boyfriend decided to make you my step daddy or rather Stefan Carter my stepdad. Sometimes I think he’s 12.
Counselor Laura: So don’t be blaming yourself for how things turned out. Clint’s a grown-up and he made his choices.
Steve: So, what are we going to do?
Purple Arrow: How?
Anthony: Something is already brewing, it could even be connected to the Baltimore incident. However, I think it's below my pay grade. I hope it stays that way. I should let you go. It must be ridiculously late there.
“Yes,” Tony said as Pepper nodded her head in agreement. “That’s how spider mom found out he had superpowers. If your child disappears right in front of you, that’s an obvious sign something is really wrong. Rio reached out to Davis because he worked with her husband before and because the Davises have to stick together.”
Tony: Do you think it would’ve happened the same way if we were already dating? I would like to think that I could have manipulated you into at least listening to my position with the promise of a blowjob.
Cuddle Bunny: What?
Purple arrow: You just confirmed it. Can you tell me what happened with Thor? Since obviously last time around, Daisy wasn’t with him.
Blue phone: Sometimes I think you just go for the easiest solution without looking for the better yet harder solution.
Counselor Laura: That’s what Stark told me. You really haven’t been around much?
Anthony: This is an improvement.
“Yes, for a couple of months then she got reassigned and we were running missions, but we still kept in contact until she started dating someone else. Than conversation started to taper off. All communication stopped when Shield fell until a couple of months ago when thanks to Tony, we started speaking to each other again. Also, turns out the “boyfriend” after me end it up being Hydra.”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You’re all absolutely lovely. Again, light Spider-Man: Homecoming stuff in this chapter. Sorry for the longer break this time, but vacation was lovely. I’m moving next Saturday so I won’t promise that we will be back on the normal Saturday schedule just yet. But soon things will be back to normal.
Your Cuddle Bunny.
"And you believe her?"
“My Tony and Steve realized that too eventually, although it took a lot of text messaging and open and honest communication to get there.” Also, therapy and antidepressants, but Laura felt like that would violate doctor-patient confidentiality or, in this case, AA sponsor confidentiality.
HSBF: How did that happen? I thought you said she was now impervious to cookie baskets.
Melinda: Then it would be better than what you have now. Friendship is never a consolation prize. You need to keep moving forward. Even if we can undo what happened, we still must live with the scars.
Cuddle Bunny: Ross didn’t toss you onto the raft the moment you showed up at the White House?
Tony Potts: But Steve could've started with "Hey, Tony, we need you to come to the compound because we fucked up."
Also, congratulations on perfecting trans-dimensional text messaging. We will definitely be talking about that when I get in.
“If you consider pointing out all your bad qualities repeatedly throughout the flight that, then yes,” Piper explained.
StarkAE: But I am ok.
Anthony: Well it helps when I get her the Intel needed to go after the guy who killed her cousin.
Me: Because you still don’t trust SHIELD even if they are under new management and branding.
Me: Actually, all the kids miss him, especially Connor. He was being an extra brat to Laura. Teenagers. They almost make me glad I’m sterile.
“You guys are so married. Sometimes you finish each other sentences. You’re worse than Fitzsimmons. And Natasha is not my girlfriend. We are work colleagues.” Daisy argued. "Besides, you're going to need me to deal with Loki. Do you remember he killed our boss that one time? Sorry, my boss, since both of you work for Pepper now."
The Mechanic: Training and monitoring of powers. Figuring out the best way to manage your teenage superhero.
Football Hunter: So maybe you’ll save the world after all from that purple raisin with a glove fetish that baby bird keeps drawing.
Please come to SI. I need you, my science bro. You can even do Avenger work part time if you’re worrying about Coulson giving you a hard time for moving to the private sector. I know Platypus was considering detailing you to the UN Avengers anyway. We have excellent benefits including full mental health coverage. Come join us. I need you. My Board of Directors hate me.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: He prefers Nomad. And yes. Along with Falcon, Black Widow, as well as Mockingbird and the Rider. The last two are new. Also because of that, I can't tell you where we are, except we are somewhere in Europe.
Chief Mechanic: This means that you’re up to check up on why the kids are still in the labs at 2 AM. Ana just had to wake me up after a beautiful night of catching up with my fiancé because it’s 2 AM, and my child hasn’t even attempted a sleep cycle yet.
Tony Potts: Okay, maybe it wasn't entirely an excuse. I know from Deke and my nanny that the Simmons situation is unstable I.e. Deke tried to get her in rehab three times in the last year alone.  It must be worse with him being gone.
Based on characters originally created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko.
“I asked Ana if it was OK if I spoke to you for a few minutes.”
Nomad: I think Coulson can help you get away with murder especially if you got rid of the Ross problem.
Also, I’m starting vacation today (my parents are set to arrive any minute to begin part one of my family vacation). I’m going where cell phone service and Internet access will be questionable at best. So there may not be another update until I get back. But hey, there’s seven conversations with my beta, so material will be flowing when I get back.
Chief Mechanic: Actually, Stevie bear is reading this over my shoulder completely naked. He may have been the one who made me unlock everything for the Chief Monkey Lover. Not for the kids. I really wish I could be doing things with him instead of having to have this conversation with you.
(See the end of the chapter for
Captain tight pants: I know. I’m worried about you starving now. If you’re bipolar, why didn’t they diagnose you then?
“I found a card stuffed into my underwear. I don’t blame him for going back. I wish I didn’t call him in. At least Scott could go back.
To: Tony_Carbonell
Agent L. Barton: I think he’s happy with you.
Director Snookums: Thank you.
“I scare you?” Tony asked.
Also, in case you missed it, I did update Hydra lullaby last Monday. I have yet to get any reviews on that chapter, so I’m wondering if I posted it a really bad time.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. It’s now interlude time.
“I think we were lying to ourselves before thinking that if we just undid the snap, everything would be fixed, but…”
Ana Jr.: What were you trying to accomplish when she sent you back in time?
Note: For some reason in the MCU, probably due to bad researching, Malta is not part of the EU. I decided to reconcile real geopolitics with MCU history by having Malta be previously part of the EU, but they left right about the time aliens fell over Manhattan.
Tony Potts: I don't know. But I think I know who will. And now that the kids are with Pepper, we can bring him in.
Peter does not just see you as a role model, he worships you. Did he ever tell you that you saved his life at the Stark world fair? That kind of made an impression on him and me. It’s so easy to fall from grace when they put you up on a pedestal.
“Yes dear.” Tony whispered back.
TMNS: Your daughter is fine. She just doesn’t remember the last two hours. The good news is Flash is conscious again. Piper is taking care of him.
Thank you to everybody who read and reviewed the last section. You're all wonderful.
If your children need to be excused for national security reasons, please call me yourself. Do not have your AI call me to give an obvious and laughable explanation for their absence. Please let me know at your earliest convenience why my counselor is unavailable for the unforeseen future.
Blue phone: You haven’t been using your brain as much as you should have been lately.
Nomad: I don’t know that either. I’ve seen pictures of my dad and I look a lot like him, especially now. I think I would just bring back bad memories.
“That seems plausible. But if things were different, you wouldn’t have Morgan.  I wouldn't have Robin and Kamala. I wish the decimation didn't happen, but…”
While they were in New York a few days ago, Shuri picked up on the fact that he was hallucinating his evil counterpart and decided that he needed help. This led to both he and his other self being locked in this room for the last two days subject to a full mental health screening among other test.
Hey, Uncle Tony:
I don’t know if there’s something going on between Peter and Ned. Although, Laura has received some interesting text messages regarding the beauty of Liz Allen. Apparently, she’s a Goddess among seniors. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean anything and I’m living proof of that.
“I see that you found Robin.” Tony turned around to see the Princess walking towards him.
Anthony: Although the fact that they are currently debating the demise of my relationship instead of discussing the New Jersey incident may be a good thing since they're not building up the enhanced person panic. I guess the demise of my personal life is good for something.
I would use your real name, but I’m not there yet. Laura accepts that. I don’t know if I will ever be there which is why I’m leaving my therapy retreat before there’s any chance that I could run into you.
Anthony love: Make that the lighthouse, but at least you’ll get to decide if you want it to be our wedding venue. Although we’re going to have to choose a different day because April 28 is now off the table.
“I could call off this principal. I am listed now as Afia’s other parent, right?”
Me: I think you gave me this advice before.
The first two images are safe for work, the other three, made Tony spit out his coffee. This is why this story is now rated M.
“I realize that now. You will lie to keep your kids safe.”
To make things easier, I’m trying to come up with a way to differentiate between characters, especially in my A/Ns. So the Steve and Tony from we made better life choices timeline will be referred to as Tony and Steve Stark-Rogers or Tony SR and Steve SR. Although there will be some times in-story where Tony Stark Rogers will be referred to as just Director Stark. Apparently, he can’t make his subordinates refer to him as his future married name until after the actual wedding. ATCU bureaucracy is annoying.
Captain Tight Pants: Her name is Sharon. It wasn't like I just picked her up at the funeral. She live next to me for six months before old SHIELD imploded.
(See the end of the chapter for
Agent L. Barton: We’ve already been talking about that. I want to bring all the kids. Simmons can be their agent chaperone. She’ll hate doing it, but she’ll do it for the baby.
Blue phone: Too many really.
Francis: That’s good.
“This is different. I’ve been doing a lot of study about Prodromal Schizophrenia. I know where this is going,” Leo said darkly.
Thank you for deleting any evidence of my aunt threatening to kill you. I corroborated the lab accident story. I’m still upset and a little angry and it’s probably best that you’re going to be in South Africa for a little while. Maybe I’ll go to homecoming since my evenings will no longer be filled with saving the neighborhood.
The new consultant: I just feel like something different is happening this time. Like we're on the cusp of something big. I hope it’s not another New York.
Here’s what I know so far about where I am:
To be continued…
Me: And Clint is a little pissed at me because of it even though I wasn’t the one who gave the address away.
Morgan’s dad: I don’t know what I need. Remember when I said I needed you, but I didn't need you now. That was a lie. Why do you always have to be such a self-righteous dick? [Message not sent]
Nomad: That would be good.
Purple Princess: OK, now I owe MJ $30 and a pair of shoes. Very expensive shoes at that.
Venom: I caught him sticking to the walls once. I think I get the idea. I really am that oblivious.
“She put forth a solid case." Steve really shouldn't glare at Tony when he is driving, but he does anyway. "Plus, you know I hate seeing things abandoned and dilapidated. I had to do something during my retirement, and real estate seemed like a good idea. Although I'm going to give a lot of it to the Jarvis foundation. Homelessness is going to be a big problem. We can turn a lot of those places into shelters."
Lily bear 2018: Dad came to New York with Nate. He got here really early yesterday morning from California. Although before that, Uncle Tony picked us up and brought us to the lighthouse. He stayed with us until dad got here except for when he was in that emergency meeting. Then Simmons stayed with us.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. So here we are, the last chapter of our story, excluding the epilogue.
Me: Progress in the sense that neither Laura nor Dr. Suarez was there, and it didn’t come to blows. But I don’t think our friendship is back to where it was before. Of course, we’re doing better than Agent and Purple Arrow. Of course it probably helps that there’s no sex involved. Also, Happy is less stupid.
“We will get him back,” Hunter said, putting a reassuring arm around Leo.
Just get better soon. We have a date in Johannesburg on September 24. I’m expecting you to be there. I’m not going to say you owe me a dance because I have a history of not making dances, but you owe me dinner.
Tony Potts: I think this is at least part three. Part two would've been after the purple one beat the fuck out of us. We didn’t truly talk again after that until I got an invitation to his wedding.
Red spider: I know, but I need to play the game if I don’t want to be on the raft. You know I’m on parole now. After the debriefings, I must do a press conference as well.
Me: Tony!
“Music?” Tony suggested.
Tony Potts: If operation keep away does work, then it would be better for the kids to be in Malta or at least away from anywhere with the stones.
Monkey lover 2: They’re losing and I don’t have a girlfriend because the person I’m in love with didn’t come through the portal with me and her current day equivalent is with who you referred to as my little brother.
BFF Ned: Was Thor actually here? Did you get to meet him? Are the muscles real or just like an optical illusion?
Football Hunter: Thank God. I thought I was going to have to invade the Playground to get you out.
Anthony: You’re so funny. That’s Agent America despite her having the shield. I think Deputy Director Jeffrey wants to be Captain America. He can almost keep up with Agent Agent in trivia.
MayMQ: Then this really is your fault.
“Karen not that I don’t mind spending time with you, but why are you here?” Tony asked the AI.
Also, I did the rewrites of this chapter the day after watching episode four of Falcon and the winter soldier. I kept thinking Steve’s privates accidentally ending up on Instagram would not be the worst potential Captain America PR incident. Definitely better than what John Walker did.
Me: About your alter ego. You can draw porn and yet I can’t send you dirty text messages?
Me: They're worried about the stock prices, aren't they? They’re overreacting. People being reminded that I am a member of the LGTBPIQ community shouldn’t hurt things that much. I mean there’s a few world leaders here that don’t want to sit next to me right now, but whatever.
Me: Actually, after you left it got rescheduled for tomorrow which is why I had the meeting with various officials in Malta this morning. I’m glad it is tomorrow so I can sleep and get my body use to the time difference again. I hate jet lag.
“You’re such a caring boyfriend already.” MJ joked as she left. Flash will not acknowledge that he actually likes it when she refers to him as Peter’s boyfriend. Not that it will ever happen, but it’s a happy thought.
“It’s the Watchdogs,” Tony added, always afraid this day would happen, once he learned about the Accords database.
Tony: Things are precarious with her parents at the moment, so I’m being the indulgent pseudo-uncle. I really was planning on brioche French toast.
However, I’m adapting the questions slightly to avoid pure plagiarism. Hey, maybe they are somewhat different in their timeline.
Purple Princess: Yes, which is also kind of how Flash figured out that Benji has a spider side. He took it surprisingly well, all things considered. He just passed out for a few hours, but he’s fine now.
HSBF: Nothing about this situation is good. There has to be something more to this. Something must’ve happened to make him do something like that.
“We’ll fix that. Then the recently undusted you can have a poly relationship with other me and Simmons. It's good that you and Simmons have similar taste in men.” Leo laughed at his words. “And I know you will fix this as soon as you go through the notes.”
Red phone: Ask away?
Nomad: It's better than what we had before. Although I wish we had fixed things before we couldn't see each other daily.
Me: You are still convinced that the future is finite, even though Stark and Mister America are making googly eyes at each other this time around?
BFF Ned: Why is the princess even in the US? Is this related to the Thor sightings on Twitter Friday?
StarkAE: You are no fun at all.
TMNS: I accidentally took my mask off in front of him, and it just ballooned from there. I don’t want to talk about it. Some of it I can’t tell you about even over this line.
Me: Absolutely furious. I expect him to contact me within 10 minutes.
Blue phone: That’s why you moved her into the tower?
“Actually, that was the plan. Our plan, anyway.” Simmons explained, and May’s eyes became filled with concern.
Tony: I have about a week. Although, I don’t know if my new android child will make me being the head of the ATCU a nonstarter. I’m probably going to have to tell the POTUS the truth or some version of it.
Me: Remember that we’re going with your actual age. It makes me feel less sleazy. Also, baby Robert looks 12. He looks offended that I’m on my phone instead of making small talk.
Ana Junior: I am the new AI running all Avenger and SI functions. Possibly also the ATCU too if Dr. Stark chooses to accept the position.
Tony: You ’re such a flatterer.
I wanted the news reporters to stop talking about the breakup but this was not how I wanted it to happen. Although, it did have to be something big because you possibly getting married wasn’t enough.
“Not there at least. Although, it went better this time around.”
Tony: Understandable. So both Steve and Stefan lost their mom at a young age. Steve’s mom died of tuberculosis and Stefan’s mom died of HIV or maybe breast cancer. I can’t remember what we mentioned in the initial press release.
Tony: Me too, but every time somebody tries to argue that the Gay thing is new or I’ve been hiding in the closet for decades, I just bring up the sex tape. I mean it’s not my fault that they are bi-phobic.
The new consultant: Let's get back to why your dad is meeting with the president. I'm sure it's not all about the general situation.
Nomad: You too.
Anthony: Hey, are you still up? Did you get my earlier message via Friday? I’m sorry that things with Director and Agent Agent took so long. We might have a situation and we had to work some stuff out. On top of that, Pepper called. It turns out her five-minute rant was about the idiot running our cell phone factory in China.
Anthony: Then Jeffrey whatever pointed out the good PR of having a disabled military veteran and member of the enhanced community as head of the agency in charge of dealing with the weird and super powered. Then he brought up the fact that the president’s cabinet is predominantly able bodied white males and maybe some diversification is necessary.
“Yes.”
Melinda: The director is planning to tell him after his White House visit. Or when we get back from California.
“I’m sorry, but Friday Avenger Compound is currently unavailable. As is Friday Malibu, Friday Queens, and Friday DC,” His phone responded.
Agent 13: How long?
“Or bring takeout. I adore your aunt, but she can't cook at all," MJ added. The whole exchange made Peter even more mortified. They were not freaked out at all about his mom… Aunt mentioning condom usage. Also, what did she mean by “negotiationed”? What were they supposed to be negotiating?
Me: Is it available?
MayMQ: I really don’t care about those groups. They are probably the same circles that are mad about me having the shield.
The Mechanic: The Spiders and Ms. Marvel? I’m sure the Purple Arrow children were kept safe from the Watchdog attacks mostly because they’re not in the database at all.
To be continued
“I knew something like that happened. I’m sure whatever agreement we came up with was better than the Accords.”
Monkey lover 2: Did I ever mention how glad I am that the portal dropped me off next to you?
Pepper pot: And who is "we?" Melinda?
“Is this your way of telling me that Hunter isn’t coming back? Because May already told me that earlier. Although she didn’t explain why.” And she would really like to know why.
BITC: Is this related to Thor showing up yesterday?
Me: You are definitely planning your own wedding. Depending on when it is, I’ll let you know if I’m up to being in the bridal party. I’m going to need at least another year before participating.
Me: Just like you're only in your 30s.
"Are you worried about being arrested or something else? We won’t let Ross take you in."
“I love you,” Tony whispered against his lips.
Red phone: I have no idea how she knew. It was never wise to question Aunt Peggy. She just knew stuff.
See you totally can do that question in an Email.
Purple Princess: Which has a history of being dirty or despising my father. Why did you decide to give me the ability to have a headache?
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Now I’m happy the Princess went with the Wakanda back story instead of making her look like you and me even though that would’ve been adorable.
Tosha: Although no alcohol because we have two recovering alcoholics and Simmons. And if we're going to figure out what the hell happened, we need her somewhat sober. Apparently, that’s a rare thing, according to Steve.
Red phone: Birdbrain will pick it up when he is in Palau taking care of my dark reflection.
When your boyfriend gets back to the states we’re having dinner together. All four of us.
The new consultant: Actually, I think that he’s been less careful around you than other people so he was hoping you would find out by accident.
“You can if you want to. And you know I always do what I want,” Tony smirked at him.
TMNS: Of course, I didn’t think you would do that. You don’t really care if you’re still a pariah at school because you have real friends now. You don’t throw those friends under the bus. If popularity was all you cared about, everybody would know that you are best friends with Aifa Stark-Rogers, and Tony Stark-Rogers was practically your guardian for a year. You don’t even tweet that much anymore.
Nomad: Is May going to be there as your security?
“Yes,” Steve answered emphatically.
Counselor Laura: The kids need me, and I know I’m making a difference. I looked up what happened to a few of my kids here, and I know it was better for them with me there at Midtown. I don’t think my Clint got that. The shouting started because I felt like he was trying to control me, and that’s not going to happen. It ended with him moving to Malibu and filing for legal separation, again.
Daisy is Cousin Q, and Michelle refuses to have any other codename besides MJ, especially in her own phone.
Tony: Well, I would suggest that we text each other more but May would kill me, scary May. Actually they’re both scary. I’m afraid of the Mays.
Xxxxx
“Tony did not mention that.”
Friday: Ana 2018 transmitted Deke Fitzsimmons’ report on how he ended up in 2018. A copy has been sent to your Stark pad for your review. I think you will find it illuminating.
"Steve can protect himself," Sam said as he sat down beside him.
Cuddle Bunny: Will the new Avengers be doing that?
“Then I want Happy and Peter. If operation keep away works, we are having the world's biggest party afterward. It will be a barbecue at the lake. And it will be glorious.” Tony wants that so badly.
“You are so oblivious, pumpkin patch.” Steve was well aware of that at this point.
“Actually, the drugs just got harder for a while, which led to my first few trips to rehab. Let's fast-forward to Afghanistan, where I realized how much I funked up by just drinking and designing stuff. My actions got people killed. It almost got me killed. So thanks to the advice of one wise man, I decided not to waste my life. So, I worked on trying to fix my mistakes and a few of Howard's. Then I met you, flew a nuke into a wormhole, and made several more mistakes. I screwed up things so badly that we were in pieces, so we couldn’t stop the purple one. I then got Pepper pregnant and said so many stupid things that she rightfully kicked me out. I’m still shocked Pepper is speaking to me again. Morgan is the best thing ever in my life, and I love her so much. I like being a parent. It's my favorite thing.”
Chief Mechanic: DNA test don’t lie.
Purple Princess: Not secure.
Okay, now we are caught up timewise to conversation 22.
Tony: True.
Red spider: You will not listen to me if I tell you that your presence would not have made a difference?
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Yes, along with her spouse for the attempted murder part anyway. It’s a mess and the agents are still trying to piece everything together.
Me: Your muscles are your most discerning feature. I can pick your washboard stomach out of the lineup of hot oily guys.
Me: Well, to get back at me for my oversight, Snookums decided to ask if I really slept with a Captain America plush until I was shipped off for boarding school, apparently for my own protection. Not that anyone told me about that.
Me: Because they’re children. They bounce back after anything. Where are my kids right now? I know they’re not at the tower through various tabloid reports. Apparently Stark broke up with my wife after his near-death experience for you.
HSBF: Which would be good for you because you’re doing way too much, especially if you’re going to be taking the new job. But where does the revenge element come in?
BITC: You’re gay?????
“The only person that matters to you right now is Peter.”
Chief Monkey Lover: Good.
Me: You kind of did, but I don't want you to hang up on me so I’m just going to keep my mouth shut about it for the rest of this conversation. See, progress.
Agent Laura: Would you be Simmons AA sponsor?
Cuddle Bunny: I hate being so far away from you. And I know you’re not telling me how complicated things are. Clint still has contacts at Shield and the new leadership are making things as bureaucratic as ever. How are you really dealing with the break up being public? I hope you are not paying more attention to the stupid people then you should be? They don’t know you. They don’t know how big your heart is.
Me: You also wanted to see your friends.
The mechanic: Yes, actually, but the Princess will be here soon. We are going to work on making my daughter ashamed of walking in on her other father and me, with Wanda’s help, possibly. I feel like shame of one’s parents is a significant part of being human. Or maybe that was just my childhood.
Nomad: He says I’m on my own and is mad at me for getting injured yesterday.
Nomad: You know the disgruntled employees were not your fault. Also, not everything is about you. I can get a lot of those on my own. Also most are idle.
“May mentioned it when I talked to her a few days ago and it would be nice to meet the oldest kid when we’re not fighting,” Steve said with a small smile.
“Are you ever going to tell Steve that I was able to read all his rough drafts as he was writing them?” James asked as he activated the tablet to read.
The next several chapters are already with my beta. I hope to update weekly, but we shall see. Let me know what you think and if you’re excited for things to come.
Tony: Babycakes, that is just the beginning. You miss the part where he wanted his daughter to get genetic testing for the inhuman gene on her new baby daughter when she was in utero so the problem could be dealt with early.
Hunter: I know you did.
“Maybe you will,” Hunter kissed Leo once more. “Now, put the Stark pad down and let me relax you so you will sleep for a few more hours.” Before he could successfully push down Leo’s boxers, Hunter’s hand was pushed away.”
I should be mad at you. You lied to me for months. You could’ve at least told me that you worked in human resources at Shield. I could have got you killed when Shield fell. When I stopped receiving emails from you about that time, I wondered if you became collateral damage from Hydra anyway. An email or call would have been nice.
Tony: Friday also talked us into doing the 36 questions that lead to love. Or rather, she forced us to on your orders.
Thank you again to everybody who has spent the last 3 years reading this story. This is not the end but the beginning of our next journey together.  The tentative title for the big sequel is Infinite Text messaging to the Endgame. I will begin posting after Text Messages from the Edge of High School concludes. I can’t start working on Infinite Text Messaging to the Endgame until Endgame comes out for home viewing. So, you get to spend some time at Midtown in the interim. Please check out that story.
Tony Potts: I've only known Scott for a few days, but he seems like an excited puppy.
Blue phone: I miss Natasha.
Me: Sometimes I suddenly realize how old you really are. Not that that’s a bad thing. But we’re going to have to figure out how to reword that for public consumption.
Anthony: OK, I am the guy who made murder bots. Yo-yo and her boyfriend are making me watch Terminator Salvation tonight because of that.
Anthony: Do I look like a potpourri guy to you?
“Tony!” Steve exclaimed.
Rogers: How many years sober?
Anthony: Also, you do have a thing for older women and men for that matter. Of course, neither I nor Agent America look our age, but still. Then again, neither do you.
Me: I don’t care because that asshole is out. If I was still drinking I would have popped champagne, right there during the press conference. Instead, I had milkshakes with some of my DOS friends. Did I ever tell you his Under Secretary for Environment, Energy, and Economics is ex-SI?
Monkey Lover 2: Mum does. He doesn’t. He didn’t stick around long enough. Now I know that it was for the best. I just want to forget he exists. I hope he doesn’t try to get in contact with me. I never want to see him again.
Red phone: This is on my CV. Is this another thing that you did not Google?
To clarify monkey lover 2 is Leo Fitz from the main MCU timeline where everything went totally as Canon including Tony and Steve not speaking to each other. (There are few differences, such as Fitz knew that Coulson was dying a little earlier, thanks to the artwork of Robin Huntington a.k.a. baby bird a.k.a. sparrow and Quinn not getting gobbled by the gravitonium.) When the monolith blew up in episode 5.11 (timewise this is a few weeks before Infinity War during the events of Thor Ragnarok) Agent Fitz was tossed back in time nearly 2 years. Now he’s trying to keep the world from being destroyed by an unknown force. And if that doesn’t work, his goal is to keep humanity from being slaves of the Kree. Although by preventing one catastrophe does he cause another? We shall see. The new pictures of the purple alien are starting to freak him out. More to come.
Person that cares about my boss: That’s one of his biggest problems.
Hunter: The good news depending on one’s perspective. I’m glad Fitz didn’t die.
This conversation takes place about 20 minutes after the last one.
Venom: The standalone Stark pad that Afia gave me didn't have the training wheels protocol in place. So, I got to see everything.
Cousin Q: Hey, we found Leo and Loki. Nothing to worry about. Although I'm going to have to go to Norway with Thor on a mission. I have to find a wayward King. We'll talk when I get back.
Anthony: I’m working on it. Maybe you should too.
Anthony: Mom showed up the next morning, wearing sweats of all things, with a box of French chocolates to break the news. Her wearing sweats really should’ve been sign number three. Mom never wore casual clothes. I think that’s the only time in my life I’ve seen her dressed like that.
Nomad: You're making new ones. Most of whom are not bloodsucking emotional leeches. At least I hope they’re not.
The boss: I understand the feeling, though. My other self is engaged to Steve. Apparently, they got there by playing ridiculous icebreaker games and honest communication.
Red phone: Skill, voice recognition software, and a decent vibrator.
Girl Friday: You are the best baby sister. I assume you’re making a portal for the new consultant to have access too. Can we bring BITC in yet, or am I going to have to wait until school?
“Friday, pull up those 36 questions that lead to love,” Tony asked Friday in the car.
Anthony: No, Happy got Pepper an engagement ring, because he’s always been a full-service driver/chief of security. Thanks to therapy, I am aware I should get the ring back and do something constructive with it or at least tell him to get a new one to carry around that’s in men’s sizes.
Cuddle fiancé: I’m not even entirely sure myself. Although they promised to protect the Earth from Thanos in exchange for the Gravitonium and all the Inhumans.
Virginia: Because they are stubborn idiots. This is why it could never work with either of them.
CoulsonPJ: Does it count as talking when the package punches you?
Me: Because you lied to her.
“You have a very interesting marriage,” Tony remarked.
Anthony: It all went to me in the will, but it is your stuff now as far as I’m concerned. I’ll FedEx it to you.
Friday: However, I can forward you a song that reflects the emotions behind those words. Please listen to I Miss You so Much by TLC.
Girl Friday: Why are you still up?
Me: Patches showed up last night.
“He’s still your friend. He even remembers horrible double dates.” Steve visibly exhaled at Tony’s words. “Actually, he is this new version of your friend because kidnapping changes you. I was only locked up for a few months but I came out a different person. A few decades would be so much worse.”
Melinda: That explains why she lost consciousness. Finding out your children are essentially dead would make anybody lose consciousness.
I know you told me to call you Tony, but it doesn't feel right considering how I've acted the last few weeks. I’m sorry. I really don't want you dead. I know I said some terrible things, but I don't want that. I was mad about you telling your friend Coulson about me and the fact that you’re not available to date my aunt and 100 other things, but that doesn’t mean I want to lose another mentor.
HSBF: So the director is just going to keep looking the other way?
Mumbai is coming.
"That I also got. Steve told me that it was actually a U.S. government program that you were trying to revive. And you agreed to take all the blame, even though you shouldn't have." Note to self, remind my boyfriend that he can't tell other people certain things.
Dear Tony:
Hunter: Stark!
Anthony: Why did I decide to come to this wedding? I forgot how long this was going to be. And they decided to do a reception today and not tomorrow, for reasons known only to the bridal party. Today is going to be a long day.
Tony: I may have been texting you from the front of the compound for the last 15 minutes. Of course, I brought your shield because otherwise, Robin and Morgan will try to use it to slide down the hill the moment we get snow. I don’t trust Nanny Hunter to say no.
Me: Aren’t you really glad you didn’t sleep with her?
Venom: I’m working on not being a dick. It’s easier not living with my parents anymore. [Redacted] doesn’t know yet?
Hunter: Simmons sent me several text messages. I’m actually pretty good at understanding her ramblings when she’s pissed. Which is the majority of the time. Although it’s now worse that the grandkid is missing. I told her she should have told him what she was doing. But she was worried he would've said no.
HSBF: Isn’t he concerned with trying to rebuild his image?
“That last part isn’t going to happen unless you tell me what they told you about Bucky.“  Or it may not happen if I tell you. However Tony doesn’t voice that fear out loud.
MJ: If you didn’t teach me, I would just end up hanging out with the Rising Tide or learning how from Afia's father.
“What 1990 movie?” Steve asked. Somehow nobody told him about that.
The “me” in this conversation is Steve.
P Parker: He cheated on Flash, so definitely something wrong there. Idiot.
SimmonsJA: Yes, that does mean oral, digital stimulation, as well as anal penetration.
“Especially, because I’m going to go make you French toast while you shower. I will even stuff it with blueberries and goat cheese.”
StarkAE: So is the guy who tried to steal all my weapons in Shield or police custody?
D Fitzsimmons: SI took over my think tank, and I'm exceptionally good at charming the board when they're not complaining about my lack of a Ph.D. Also, I think they decided to keep an eye on me, so they asked me to join the company. I think my current title is Chief Creative Officer. It changes a lot.
Me: So much. With him where he is we are probably only six months out from enhanced individual internment camps.
To be continued
Counselor Laura: Can you put a primer together about what is not known in this timeline?
HSBF: I would say so. You may want to call a lawyer.
Red phone: I still haven’t figured out everything that actually happened with that “satellite” explosion that took out half of the Galileo system and Veronica.
“Malibu is still closer to the shrinking people than New York. Okay, give me one last kiss before you run off and join the other Secret Avengers.” Tony was trying to be brave, but Steve could tell his boyfriend was on the verge of tears. So was Steve, at that point.
“I figured you could use something to eat,” Jemma told him, holding up her expertly wrapped sandwich. “Prosciutto and mozzarella with just a hint of pesto aïoli.”
Also, a reminder, because it’s been a few years. In this timeline, Tony covered up Sharon’s involvement in getting Steve his shield back. Therefore she never became an enemy of the state. This happened because Tony had a very close relationship with Sharon’s mom.  This happened before the dividing line. Does that move us away from the events of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in regards to Sharon? In a good timeline? Yes. At most, we’re getting morally ambiguous Sharon. In the mistakes were made timeline, I won’t tell. You’re just going to have to keep reading.
Venom: Because Stark watches are evil, BITC now knows I’m not heterosexual. There may have been a voice rec snafu.
“Are you going to tell Dr. Suarez about that?” Steve asked, slightly concerned.
“I know.”
“I really thought I was doing good at keeping that a secret.” She said with a groan as she hit the send button.
Sorry monkey lover, I really should have got back to you a lot earlier. I kind of got distracted with the boyfriend. And I also wanted to lay low for a few days after Mumbai. I’m sure Piper told you that we successfully got the lights back on in Mumbai. The Hellfire Protocol worked well. It lead them straight to me, anyway. But hey, I was having brunch with the former members of my boy band, so it was good.
“We have a lot of things to still work through.”
Me: Don’t say that. I should be apologizing to you. I pretty much let her think that you were my boyfriend just so I wouldn’t lose face.
Nomad: Sam won’t let me touch the new suit for a least another week, but I’m using the new phone now. Thank you.
May: Enjoy your time with the kids, and I’ll see if Kamala will be okay if you stop by the school for a few minutes.
“Thank you.” Steve gave him another soft smile that made Tony’s heart flutter.
Tony: I’m fine, just a shock to the system. Although, I think Rio is probably going to be traveling with me a lot. I got yelled at in Spanish. I have to take better care of my health and my heart.
Friday 2023: I apologize, but I did not know you would discuss such a sensitive subject. However, I did not show him the detailed file regarding Ana Jarvis's death despite his multiple requests. However, he would like to speak with you in his lab right away.
“It changes periodically depending on what mood Tony is in. HR hates it.” Deke remarks.
This chapter takes place a few days after the last one
Blue phone: You know he’s not actually Jarvis?
Tony: Will this change if we bring Fitz back? The snapped version, not the one who is married to Hunter in the other timeline. I think he is staying there for good.
Monkey lover 2: I’m only developing weapons for the Avenger squad. I’m allowing the ICERs to be mass-produced because I think it will cut down on unnecessary deaths in certain situations. The prosthesis work is where we’re going to make a real dent.
“I shouldn’t have hit you.”
"Possibly yes. This is why I ended up giving him the original suit in the first place. Now I’m kind of regretting grounding him because this happened."
I am meeting with Tony Stark soon to assess if he should know that there are currently two Leopold Fitz is in this timeline as well as the fret that is yet to come. After reading his correspondence with Captain Rogers, I believe I can trust him, but I still have reservations. Knowing the future is a burden that not everyone can handle.
Cuddle bunny: According to my sources, a warhead was stolen from a US government facility. A Dr. Lincoln Campbell died during the operation to recover the warhead that was modified with a gas that caused those exposed to mutate and gain enhanced strength, while losing their cognitive functions and autonomy.
“Inpatient facility or Shield’s version of a secure inpatient facility which basically means spending like a week with Dr. Suarez as he sleeps in one of the white rooms for a while which is good since, he’s kind of sort of fighting with his girlfriend. But he needs that help so as much as I want him here I am going to support his journey to good mental health because that’s what friends do.  I kind of mentioned this earlier.”
Red phone: I’m halfway tempted to hack his emails and send them to Congress.
“You will be back with him soon,” Natasha told him as she sat beside him. Sam was flying.
Cuddle Bunny: Maybe I just want to avoid conflict right now. I like what we’ve built with each other and I don’t want to fight with you. We didn’t solve anything by going at each other’s throats in Siberia. I just decided it’s better to let things go where they go with us and not fight it.
Me: But taking a step back is good because, well, you can’t fix everything and being a part of the UN Avengers will provide him with additional tools. So, SI part time and Avengers part time with extra time for Suarez and the occasional mental health spa day.
Even Red is gone and I don’t blame her for trying to start a normal life. She’s on call if something bad happens but I hope nothing does. I wish Lily’s aunt would send a letter or something to let me know where she is and how she’s doing. It would be better if she would just come back but you mentioned she was busy with Melinda‘s daughter which is understandable. That is also good because Melinda was really worried about Skye Quake when we were in Johannesburg.
Me: OK.
I now present the conclusion of the 36 questions that lead to love.
Tony: Yes. So if you could add another power to your wheelhouse, what would you add?
“No. I’m sorry we’re going to need more than one good conversation for you and Steve to work through the mountain of bull shit that is your relationship. Remember, I've lived through this once. It took a while with less shit to work through.”
“We know who is responsible for funding the Watchdogs but because he is a highly successful Russian businessman, we can’t touch him.” The director explains.
Tosha: Apparently, she purposely chose the day that he disappeared as the day you would be traveling back to. She may have told you and Deke that you were going back to the same place, but you weren’t. She was sending you to Laura and him to Fitz. She is now crying on Bruce.
Steve: We've known each other for over a decade. You know that I do. You were there with me when I tried to put Barbie's dream house together. I cursed like the Army man that I am.
Me: Sure, but I thought you had a dinner meeting?
“Your heart rate never went above the targeted zone, despite achieving orgasm. Therefore, your biometric data was not forwarded to her. Would you like me to forward the data anyway?” He heard the travel version of Friday say from the bedroom.
Tony: Now I have an heir; they can get fucked. I’m done.
This conversation takes place just a couple of hours after Tony and Steve’s last one.
HSBF: It’s a tossup between stopping Red Skull, stopping Hydra, and preventing the New York incident from being worse.
Tony: A lot. Although Yo-Yo is a better source.
I always felt like Howard hated me for being smarter than him. I’ve never felt like that. I’m pretty sure Monkey Lover is smarter than me and it kind of excites me. I need the next generation to be better than me, so they don’t make the same mistakes I did. I’m even intrigued by the person helping your James. Maybe I’m this way because I’m trying not to be Howard. It’s my goal in life.
"We have multiple times, such as when he was almost killed. It’s just different now that we’re actually in the same place for the moment, especially because we both know it’s only going to be a few days.” Possibly shorter because of Ross. However, Steve doesn’t want to say that out loud.
I feel like this chapter is going to be extra fun for anybody familiar with comic book canon. Natasha is about to say some hard truths.
“I’m not your Fitz,” Leo argued.
Purple Princess: Okay, I switched to Avenger channels after I accidentally sent the first picture to May 2.
Cuddle fiancé: No, they don’t like people that fight back, especially Wanda. She was with us because of the signing ceremony.  Although the Confederacy did kill the General for her insolence.
On March 24, 2018, three monoliths that control space, time, and creation were destroyed by a bomb. It was presumed that Leo Fitz died during the explosion. Instead, he was transported 22 months into the past. Due to his attempt to prevent the destruction of the earth, he created an alternate timeline that apparently, I come from.
Venom: That doesn’t sound as reassuring as it should be.
Tony: Dr. Monkey Lover. There are moments where I think he’s keeping something big inside. Maybe secretly he’s a clairvoyant inhuman.
Tony: I can totally raise a teenage android. Although, Afia says she is a Synthetic Wakanda American. Also, people were terrified of Vision because he’s an android. Afia wants to be an Avenger, so maybe it’s better if she has a secret identity.
Director Snookums: I'm working on it, but it will be a couple of months especially because you want me to get Laura's husband home first. You still want me to get him home first?
Me: Still not happening. Even if we knew for sure this is actually a private conversation, the real thing is always better.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation you’re all absolutely fabulous.
Nomad: That was nice.
“No, definitely not.” Tony responded with a kiss that deepened quicker than it should have. “Now I think I can almost pull off a second round.”
“Is that why you never asked me for the shield back?” Tony has wondered about that a lot. Even more so after finding out other Steve changed his codename to Nomad and made May the new Captain America. The government wasn’t exactly happy about that and tried to take back the shield more than once. That doesn’t surprise Tony one bit. They’ve tried it with him. However, he’s no longer in the business of passing Stark weapons to the American government, even if they were designed by Howard.
"Yes and yes." Sam deadpanned. "Did they actually get married? Is that even legal?"
Me: Obviously. First part?
The Mechanic: It will be even though I’m the only Avenger there. Besides the Bulletproof Pacifist and he is technically a reservist. He’s also only there part-time, thanks to Spider sitting
So, I leave you with this question, what earth is tattoo Clint from?
I bet you two are screwing like bunnies right now. Fuck you.
Blue phone: Why?
Football Hunter: They’re already on separate floors. We’re just waiting for our ride to get here. Separate rides because apparently the rocks that eat people should not be transported together.
“Real New York pizza,” He also asked for that last time but she forgot to bring any back with her.
Agent 13: It didn't work. Although it is nice to know that my aunt wasn't just your beard.
Nomad: And you may have been the instigator of this incident?
Me: I guess that’s one advantage of Operation: Get the Avengers Back Together Before the World is Cracked Apart and Aliens Invade. Although, I am surprised that all the bickering was actually sexual tension.
HSBF: Well, the people that the DODC were protecting anyway. Considering that two years later, a group of firefighters died because of a virus they picked up from an alien helmet, I think I made the right call.
Me: Spider-Aunt already signed me up for the Valentine’s Day dance bake sale fundraiser after trying my apple strudel Friday morning. And I'm not allowed to just pay for it myself. Actually, I might even help with the holiday pageant bake sale as well.
Me: Well good, maybe the next question will not come to pass because I don’t want you to die but if the unimaginable did happen, would you have some unfinished business?
Me: He said that he was undercover but Spidey Junior’s mom does not believe him, not entirely. And honestly, I’m not sure if I do, either. Maybe he was undercover but I feel like he shares too many of their beliefs.
"Even if May isn’t the wife you thought you would have?" Tony asked.
Ana Jr.: Until last night anyway. Did you use the files found on the Stark server to create your time GPS?
Heroism doesn’t come from the suit or superpowers or anything else superficial like that. One of the greatest heroes I’ve ever met never had any of that. The voice in your suit for the last few days was that of Agent Phil Coulson. He has been a field agent since before you were a zygote. The man has saved the world so many times he has literally lost count. He doesn’t even remember the details anymore.
Me: Absolutely, because who wouldn't want to make out with Captain America. Perfectly kissable lips and cerulean blue eyes with just a hint of green which makes them even more perfect. He is an absolute dream boat and my only companion right now is my toy box.
Steve: I know that, but it's easier said than done.
Counselor Laura: You did, and it made the last month of pregnancy tolerable. You have excellent choice in chocolate and apology presents. Although, I prefer when you deliver them in person. So you didn’t show up at the farmhouse crying and asking for forgiveness?
“Isn’t that where the Fitzsimmons wedding happened? I kind of remember it from the text messages that you sent me from the wedding.”
DILF: You know if you were with us, we might be able to fix things so they could be at the wedding, but that's not happening right now.
Considering that the Grand Master’s already made a pass at me twice I see this as a possibility and I’m not having that. I did some things when I was on the street to survive that I wish I didn’t. I know that it’s necessary for me to do whatever I have to do to survive this planet, but not that. Calling a truce with the being that murdered Coulson was hard enough. Yes, the death didn’t stick, but I’m still upset about that.
See summary below:
Counselor Laura: I’m aware of the tape and the dark times that led to it. It made a comeback when my Tony “came out.” Not that he’s actually ever been in the closet since that tape came out but apparently, “no bisexuals” is a thing. Whenever a reporter says something about my Tony waiting so long to come out, he tells them to Google the sex tape.
Football Hunter: Simmons says we’re going to Glasgow for Christmas. Barring an apocalypse, and there’s never one when you want one.
Nomad: Actually, Rhodey had me watch it. How’s he doing being director?
Since I’ve already started talking about family life maybe I should just skip to the next question. Of course, I know you’re not going to let me get away with that. OK, family life with my actual blood related family is kind of complicated. I wasn’t sure that my father actually loved me until I read his diary bequeathed to me by the good aunt. So that says a lot of things.
“Despite you already buying the ring.”
D Fitzsimmons: At least I won over the step-grandparent. Okay, where can I get food where I can avoid my family? I don't have the energy.
Tony: She made the new body and gave Afia a wonderful new backstory/legal identity as well as Wakanda citizenship. As far as the US government is concerned, she is a person. She’s also planning to attend Midtown to keep an eye on Spidey Senior and the boy in the chair.
Purple Princess: I have to get your dad a better lawyer.
HSBF: Speaking of marriage, there were pictures of us together at the wedding and apparently there are engagement rumors circulating. Lily’s aunt showed me an article from some Russian newspaper; apparently, we’ve made the papers.
“Can I talk to Rhodey or Coulson?” Tony asked, already annoyed with his AI.
However, the execution was flawed. Very flawed. Ask the Princess to tell you about the Mumbai incident. Or what happened in New York, DC, London, or LA the day before the US presidential elections. Certain flaws of the Accords were fully on display, and people ended up dead. No one with powers, but some innocent bystanders because that’s what happens when you unleash an EMP on a major city in a society where everything runs on electricity.
Jemma: My drinking was what Deke was most worried about. Not coming back home, but my drinking.
Chief mechanic: Actually, the POTUS is shocked I even know about SWORD at the moment. Per the notes, the current head might be the key to contacting the mysterious Carol.
Tony: Next week sometime. I think. I really need to double check with Yo-Yo. I think I’m scheduled to be in DC for a few days taking some meetings or maybe a few weeks. I’m mostly looking forward to having lunch with my BFF and having a front row seat for the Ross implosion.
Monkey lover 2: You just like the idea of people referring to me as your husband.
I don’t want that for us, but sometimes I’m not sure how to avoid it. Despite that, you know I worry. I’m never going to not worry about you. You’re my best friend, besides Platypus. I like for you and me to be almost normal with each other. I’m sure that’s just the wishful fantasy, but I’m still hopeful. We have to get there eventually, right?
Director Stark: Also, if I dated who my friends wanted me today, I would still be with Pepper. Maybe you should make your own choices.
Me: It’s always good to be paranoid. It was possible that my early morning guest could be a clone or a LMD. However, that possibility was disproven the moment that he threatened to tase me if I started acting stupid.
Me: Under what circumstances?
Me: I can see that. Although, I feel like other things would be more important.
Tony: Or that I’m actually with Chris Evans.
Anthony love: I have not been rambling. I think I may have mentioned it, or maybe I didn’t. I was going through coffee withdrawal at the time. I was also more worried about Laura because Daisy has superpowers, and the big scary lady was no longer on the planet. Can we just have one apocalypse at a time? Is that too much to ask for?
To be continued.
HSBF: Another reason to be careful. Text me afterwards.
D: What about baby spider?
“No, but get rid of the bottle. Also, I need a protein bar or something, if I’m to survive the next four hours until the dinner. Thankfully SI is sponsoring the opening banquet tonight so there will be food. Why do they not really feed us?"
“What happened to the Senator?” Leo asked.
Subject: Sorry, I did too much science. Don’t worry, I'm going to bed now.
Honestly, Virginia has been a bit of a wreck these last few days. You know that she spent the night outside your hospital room. I literally had to drag her back to the hotel. Of course, that was before your assistant moved her into the Tower for security reasons. I like Ms. Rodriguez. I almost want to take her for my company.
Me: Ridiculously awful. The only positive was I didn’t run into your girlfriend.
Clint’s strange behavior from earlier began to make sense. Of course, he would act like that if she was essentially dead.
Tony: Good to know you get that show, no matter what country you are currently in. Yes, she changed it to Elizabeth Glen, after she got married a couple years ago in an effort to completely divorce herself from her father due to his various bad actions. I told you they didn’t like each other, and not just because of Bruce. Which was why she was willing to go on national television and show everybody the family skeletons.
Me: Team Coulson is not even there according to Piper. Still making use of the West Coast facilities, apparently.
Blue phone: And if you add water, you get cement. That’s really useful for building things.
Nomad: Relieved, actually. This way I don’t have to worry about you being nasty to May.
Me: Is that even possible or legal?
D Fitzsimmons: Actually, she goes by Potts Stark now. They changed their last name for Morgan. They wanted to switch to Carbonell, but the board wouldn't have it.
Me: At least, not flat-out denying it anymore. What about you?
Chief Monkey Lover: Unfortunately, I can’t read that report because Ana will not let me access it. What do you not want me to know?
Person that cares about my boss: I’m not going to ask you how you made another Shield contact. I think it’s best that I don’t know.
Anthony: I’ll think about it if Happy will turn the thing over. Hey, I’ll talk to you later, Sugar Baby. Snookums just called to talk about last night so I should go, Babycakes.
Red phone: I guess there's that.
StarkAE: She’s a psychologist.
Cuddle fiancé: Maybe not phrase it like that.
Nomad: You contributed 30% of the money for Culver University to rebuild their library and provided the Robert Banner endowment for survivors of domestic violence. That’s not public knowledge. Actually, you made that donation under the pseudonym of Antonio Rogers.
Anthony: There are times that they use people close to me to hurt me because my identity is publicly known. Now they're using possible government sanctions against SI as a choke chain to keep me in line. Or at least they're trying to. They forgot I'm smart enough to call a bluff. Although now that Ross has lost some of his power, I’m sure he doesn’t think I’m toothless anymore.
Xxxxx
“Not yet.” Piper replied, “It only takes a minute to set up a secure connection now.”
Captain Tight Pants: Why do you antagonize everybody?
Karen: Agent Leo is. The princess says that Agent May can come if she wants to. I just asked her. Princess Shuri is currently in the Los Angeles area helping with the incident.
Blue phone: There are worse ways to cope with the death of a loved one.
Me: Good. I’m glad you’re talking to somebody. Write me in a few days. I promise to be good
“He’s currently asleep.” That makes sense from Afia’s earlier email.
Nomad: I’m sure you could, but I’m not ready to (Message not sent)
Unfortunately Steve pulled away. “As much as I want to continue this, I want to finish working on my letter to Bucky before you undress me again.”
Director Snookums: Friday told me that you're actually now dating ‘Cuddle Bunny’.
Me: I’ll try.
Tony: Because at least this way I can use one of the remote suits to get him out of the rubble if the building collapses on him again. Seriously, a building. He could’ve been killed.
HSBF: I expect nothing less of Jim’s grandkid. And you’re probably going to have to do the things most parents do to get on the good side of the principal, like PTA meetings and chaperoning field trips.
Me: Yes.
"The bad guy was trying to lure us there to get his revenge. He wasn't actually going to unleash an army of super soldiers on the world. He actually shot them in the head before we got there."
Cuddle fiancé: But not other Tony having a kid with Pepper thing?
“I really don’t take orders from Shield anymore, even if you’re in charge now.” He doesn’t want to go back to before the fall.
Blue phone: There’s nothing you can do to make the irrational less afraid, including putting a leash on yourself. It just makes it easier for them to find you.
Tony: Except that is not happening yet because apparently, Deke is missing. So would you like to explain why your daughter drew a picture of Clint wearing a nanotech suit that I know Deke borrowed the design from my servers and Clint‘s wife that's been snapped for the last five years?
Okay, that was weird. Friday shouldn’t be unavailable, even with the EMP problem, unless somebody is purposely cutting off access. Of course, about five seconds after Tony realizes that’s exactly what’s going on the door was kicked in. Tony is not surprised that 10 heavily armed men wearing dog masks and paramilitary gear walked into the room. Nor was he surprised that two were on the floor and severely unconscious before Tony realized that what will be the last model of the suitcase armor cannot assemble when a continuous EMP pulse is going on, especially when they’ve managed to jam Friday. Definitely moving on to the nanotech suit as soon as he gets back to the US.
HSBF: Kind of and definitely. She wants to throw red paint on you? Benji has a crush on her?
Me: That is definitely not happening. I was a bad candidate before, now I have a boyfriend that could become a fiancé at some point. Maybe.
“What did May say that has you blushing so much?” Afia asked. Flash tried to answer, but Peter quickly placed his hand over Flash's mouth. Peter was not going to think about the fact that his entire body started to tingle at the touch of his lips against his fingers. He wasn’t going to think about it at all because then Flash licked his hand. That caused him to let go.
Steve almost seemed relieved that we know about Thanos and are actively preparing to defeat him as a team. Of course, I don’t know if the preparations we’ve made will make any difference because nobody will answer my questions about what happened here, and I’ve asked everyone. No one answers.
The Boy in the Chair: Peter????
Me: Friday is working on figuring out how to get the stuff to you, but it might be a couple of weeks. Although I did make a couple of copies of the pictures of you pre-transformation. Seriously, baby, you were always hot. I hope that’s okay.
“Or go and talk about this elsewhere. We’re trying to focus on this." Friday said from the side. He knows she has another name here, but he's going to keep calling her Friday because it makes him feel less alone. Like there's at least one person from his other life here.
Nomad: I don’t think being picked up by the government counts
Me: They’re still not okay with you having a public boyfriend?
"Besides, it’s my neck you’re going to really have to worry about. I hope Yo-Yo packed a few turtlenecks.” Tony jokes before falling onto the freshly made bed.
“I regret not talking to you before everything blew up. I regret not talking to you after everything blew up.” Steve confessed, and it practically broke Tony’s heart.
Anthony: Yes, although it’s mostly to protect their assets from Ross and from whoever the new director will be. That search is not going well. Plus there was an incident recently that requires immediate action.
Person that cares about my boss: Okay. I guess that means I wasn’t just a job to her. Is she your contact to find out what really happened to Ana?
Tony: I think she has a crush on the boy in the chair. And now she has a body and yeah, I’m not going to think about any of that. It’s like a Weird Science remake waiting to happen.
“Viciousness in computer skills?” Tony joked because he wasn’t quite sure what Steve meant.
We are doing the New York Times’s 36 questions that lead to love again. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html
Tony: He’s actually managed to become a decent driver. It’s probably the kids.
Tony: Thor lost his father, friends, brother, and planet in less than a month. He also went for the heart instead of the head, and therefore he blames himself for Thanos succeeding. It was made worse by Jane being dusted. I think only Dr. Darcy made it. He lost practically everything and didn’t cope in the best way.
Blue phone: I’m rolling my eyes right now. If you don't want to go, you shouldn't go.
Agent 13: No. Lab tests are showing that the bottles of canola oil were switched out with sunflower oil including the two bottles that were unopened. The salad dressing was also contaminated with sunflower seed oil as well as the marinade for the main course. Also the peanut butter for the peanut butter tort was contaminated with sunflower butter.
Tony: We really should’ve done this exercise earlier.
Me: Skye-quake-22’s boyfriend was the one who safely flew away the big bad and his big bad weapon into space where the worst thing it could do was take out a bunch of satellites.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. Here is your first chapter of 2019.
Anthony: Idiots.
“Because you know I can take care of myself.”
Person that cares about my boss: So I engaged in a sexual relationship for almost a year with Tony’s ATCU handler?
“Besides, even on a more personal level, Ross is not someone I could have trusted even before some of the more recent revelations. I know what he did to Bruce. That’s a major reason why I couldn’t sign on,” Steve explained.
From: Tony_Carbonell-Rogers
Melinda: I think they’re going to need evidence.
The Mechanic: Why did you say no?
Yes, I saw Black Panther this weekend and it was absolutely fabulous. It’s at the top of my Marvel movie list next to Winter Soldier. I’m sure I’m seeing it again as soon as the crowds calm down. If you would like to talk to me about the movie and how it will affect the story. Please PM me on fanfiction dot net or DM me on twitter. I have the same username over there. Please do not put anything spoiler-ish in your comments.
“You and Steve are to take four minutes to tell one another about your life." The AI instructed.
Nomad: Ross?
Stephen C: I think I might be engaged to Tony.
Friday 2023: I will conduct an interview with Scott and send you the information
Anthony: I have the movie. But it's not date appropriate and I really want to not think about appending apocalypses. But I’ll have Friday put it on your computer anyway.
Purple Princess: Wouldn't we all? Are you bringing the glove?
“Those were some good churros, though. I kind of want one now.”
TMNS: I’ll tell him if I ever have a boyfriend. Which may not be anytime soon because I don’t know if I should get anybody else involved in this life.
Blue phone: Pepper got your assistant in the breakup?
Cuddle Bunny: Tony, how do I know Melinda May?
Red phone: You've seen what happens when I let my emotions cloud my judgment.
Dear asshole who murdered my parents:
Love: The bastard did what?
Nomad: The red one keeps saying that we should just have sex and get it over with. You’re my only sane friend that is still responding to my text messages.
HSBF: He could nominate you.
With the next Thor movie opening in the U.S. Friday (and already out in 52% of the international markets), some of you are wondering if things from that movie will get incorporated into the story? The answer to that is I will not know until I actually watch the movie,but I’m currently leaning towards no since the movie takes place on another planet. I won’t make that decision for sure until I actually watch the movie and with my schedule being what it is that’s not going to happen until Veterans Day.
Blue phone: I think they’re making you go to therapy because of your ridiculous guilt complex.
"I think you should be honest with Peter about this."
Note: Steve does not want us to refer to him as Captain anymore, but I’m doing it anyway.
Monkey lover 2: I’m 53% positive that’s what occurred. Of course, gravitonium could also be involved.
Me: And maybe Friday didn’t scrub the answers as much as she should have and now Jane thinks that you’re actually former Shield. She doesn’t want to expose you. I decided it was best not to clarify since technically you a former Shield agent.
Lily bear 2018: OK. Dad wants to talk to you. But I love you, don't forget that.
The new consultant: That also confirms that you have other friends who are not robots, including teenage mutant ninjas spider. Although personally, I don’t consider Afia a robot. She is still a person who just happens to be a fabricated Wakandan American.
Tony: Some could argue the same thing about the poverty.
Blue phone: I wonder why.
Me: That is where I got the activism bug as you say. I hated the way things were back then. I saw the police raid the club so many times. So many people got hurt or worse just because of who they loved. That’s not right.
Nomad: So am I especially with what’s going on.
I think I need to start putting a portfolio together for all my fictional weddings. Who knows, I may have the need for more fictional wedding planning in the future.
“Times up," Friday interrupted.
"They were making it out to be worse than what it really was on the news." That’s when he heard Tony walk into the room.
DILF: We’re not planning to do that. At the minimum, Robin would kick me in the shin.
Anthony: Because they need somebody there to eviscerate me. And he’s probably upset that SI stocks are up five points since the announcement. Not everything they're saying is a lie. I am unstable.
Me: You can’t be responsible for the choices that other people make. He didn’t have to start making weapons out of alien tech and selling them on the black market to anybody willing to pay?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You all are absolutely lovely. I’m still in the middle of moving but because I had to work Friday, I decided to make good use of my lunch break, so you’re getting this today.
Red phone: Actually, she took it away because she saw me using the word sexting and sex tape in the message.
This was also written before episode 5.11 aired.
HSBF: I know. Will Monkey Lover be with you as well?
“I don’t have to go back. Also, it’s not a spider problem. Thankfully, Benji is not in danger, mostly because Joey is a really good at spider sitting.”
She also sees Bruce on the platform, except he is now Hulk size and staring at her in complete bewilderment. The fact that he’s there at all surprises her because he hasn’t been seen since about two days after he and the rest of the Avengers crashed her old farmhouse back in April 2015. She was starting to believe that maybe this was 2023. This was all very weird. What the hell was going on?
Tony: And you are back to monosyllables. I can use some of that, but all the Anna stuff will have to be scrubbed. I don’t want people to know what she meant to me. I’m not even sure how much Jarvis stuff I want the public to know.
BITC: Point. And he is your friend too.
Me: I’m touched. You’re the best text message boyfriend ever. Actually, I think you’re the best boyfriend I’ve ever had and you’re not actually my boyfriend. My love life is sad.
Red phone: I'm always on my phone during these meetings.
PS: I know about Happy coming. We spoke and he is really not happy about me almost dying because of the sunflower murder conspiracy. Or avoiding him for the last few months. It’s better now.
It was such a pleasure to meet you last Friday although I wish the night had gone better. I had a feeling it would probably end in disaster, but I didn’t expect anybody to end up hospitalized. Virginia told me what really happened and I'm so sorry that you had to go through that. I wish you a speedy and safe recovery.
“Oh yes, I’m going to create an entirely new backup.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Me: Anyway, I hired a couple of tutors. So we will kind of be starting our own school.
Me: I’m not sure what May just referred to you as in Mandarin, but it probably wasn’t anything very nice.
“It is going to take Afia a little while to create the gateway even with my and Shuri’s help. Maybe you should let the Dendrotoxin wear off on its own,” Leo explained.
“I’m not surprised. I don’t joke about your death. That would just be too much." Steve answered.
“I will take that as a no. Between my time at Stark Industries years ago and the type of things that you were saying this morning on the fly over here, I think I know why you are so invested and pushing Stark and Pepper back together?”
Also due to the fact that the artwork is a little more risqué, I can either raise the rating of this story or post the artwork as a separate entry with a higher rating. However, the fanfiction.net version will stay the same due to the lack of illustrations. Let me know your preference. I’m leaning towards including in the main story and just raising the rating.
Tony: It helps that Afia is here. Well, not at the moment, but in general. She made me breakfast in bed, and we are having family movie time tonight. In a couple years, she can do the speech, complete with synthetic tears about never getting to meet her grandfather. Although I want to give her at least a year before she has to do this thing.
Avenger Friday: No, they did not until a dying Coulson contacted Tony shortly before the decimation. Tony and Steve were never engaged or even dated for that matter. Tony was engaged to Ms. Potts at the time of the decimation. Although they have yet to have the ceremony, they live in Pennsylvania with their four-year-old daughter Morgan. Technically his last name is now Potts-Stark but I prefer to still call him Mr. Stark.  I can only describe Steve and Tony’s relationship as complicated. However, their children enjoy regular play dates despite their age differences.
StarkAE: We did talk about that and have acknowledged that we both made bad choices. Maybe we need to talk more about it now, but keeping us from having sex is not going to make that conversation happen any sooner. Actually, the sex may help take the edge off of those conversations. It is my favorite coping mechanism.
Me: I’m flattered but I assume that we would have to be publicly together at that point for it to really be a good idea.
Nomad: I haven't got to Doctor Who yet.
Blue phone: Why did she need Thor’s help?
CoulsonPJ: That may be a good thing.
Monkey lover 2: That would’ve been another one of my past lives.
“That’s a hard yes. But again, they are not upset about the super villain in training trying to intercept a shipment of Avenger tech, but the fact I have a boyfriend. Okay Ross is probably upset about the weapons thing in addition to the Clint thing, but that’s a Rhodey problem."
Counselor Laura from 2023: How do you know about him?
Anthony: It's why I feel like I have to help on the project.
Purple Princess: From a certain point of view.
Hunter: You don’t want Leo to find out that Simmons fell apart without him? That’s why you’re hiding everything from him, including Deke’s notes, that might be extremely useful.
Thank you to everybody who left comments for the story. Thank you to everybody who left kudos or added the story to your favorites or alerts. All of you have kept me happy and writing.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You’re so fabulous. With so many of us practicing social distancing right now, I thought it would be a good time to upload a chapter a little early. Remember to put this story on alert, so you don’t miss any chapters.
Counselor Laura: Someday, we're going to have to have a conversation about that, but I'm more curious about Morgan's existence.
“What am I right about?” Tony asked.
Also, there are only four suites on that floor. One is ours. One belongs to your live-in counselor. One room is for Happy and the other suite is for agents Piper and Davis to share.
Tony: The first 13 before I turned on the radio. Although when Friday decided to play Linkin Park’s invisible, I felt it was time to let Steve drive so I could send text messages and read through reports. Deke’s interview with Ana 2018 was illuminating. I think I know where I need to start now with fixing things on our side.
Me: Benjamin is doing well. Relatively speaking, considering the entire school is whispering about him and passing around a video file of him getting kicked in the genitals.
To be continued.
Nomad: Probably
Nomad: Yes, we did. We will watch Star Trek Beyond together as soon as you get me a copy. In the meantime, you can keep telling me about your crush on my acting double.
“Which will be when you head back to the states and Sam and Natasha come pick me up,” Steve responded.
HSBF: That sounds great. Like a real family dinner. Did Pepper come?
Tony: I don’t know. I mean there’s been evidence for months that he is a xenophobic asshole. Although, the family values crowd is probably not happy with his suggestion to his daughter regarding her possibly inhuman daughter. But when people are terrified, xenophobic assholes are tolerated. I’m hoping the realization that he’s a sexist xenophobic will be the tipping point.
“And you already know that because you asked Leo for help.”
Monkey lover 2: Maybe
Cuddle Bunny: It wasn’t a total lie. I am a boy who is your friend.
May: [Image one attached]
“Yes. I even told Kamala more details while I was in there. She wants to see her parents again.” Tony could hear the sadness in Steve’s voice.
So, yes Tony is now up and being relocated. However, he’s being kept away from his precious phone. The horror of having to write a note in hard copy. How long do you think that’s going to last?
Me: What do you really want, my cuddle bunny?
Tony: We could take the kids for the night, and Pepper can have a break.
Me: She did, but you didn’t. I was worried about the radio silence for the last two days. If I didn’t hear from you tonight, I was going to text you myself.
OIG stands for the Office of Inspector General. In this case, we’re specifically talking about the Inspector General for the Department of State. I feel like the office was busy during the Ross administration in the MCU. At least they are busy in the timeline of my story.
Counselor Laura from 2023: But your Uncle Tony did get me back. Trust me, this is a lot nicer than the accommodations I had with Ross. Is Uncle Tony the one taking care of you right now?
Genius Princess: I have to go. Deke just punched his grandfather. I really thought Hunter could keep them under control while I eat something.
Tony: There won’t be a new version that you can’t be a party to. More protection of persons with powers, less loopholes for people like Ross to manipulate. Platypus is coming for Christmas in Malta to speak with you and the other secret Avengers for input. Although, I heard you’re going to be gaining a few new members by that point.
“After Christmas. Either he’ll ask or I’ll just put on the engagement ring,” Steve tells her. He’s already made his mind up. Tony was making a deal with the president not only to get him back in the country, but to bring the others home as well. This was definitely the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.
Kissing Steve was Tony’s favorite thing in the universe. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was such a new sensation or maybe because it was such a rarity. Long distance relationships definitely make the heart grow fonder. Or maybe it was because there was a 5% probability that after Tony told Steve that his BFF was now conscious and deprogrammed this would be the last kiss. And if it was going to be his last kiss, then Tony was going to make it count and maybe start unbuttoning some jeans. Yep, that would be good.
HSBF: No you’re not.
Purple Arrow: That would do it.
: He is a Dr. Leopold Fitz from possibly another timeline or dimension, brought to our dimension by the explosion of multiple interdimensional portals called monoliths. I am trying to determine if he comes from a later point in our own timeline or from a parallel dimension. So far my research is inconclusive. To prevent any confusion with his original dimension/timeline counterpart, I will be referring to him as Dr. Leopold.
Anthony love: You’re the only thing worth this much craziness.
“Just get Fitz back,” She said pulling away from Afia.
Venom: Which truth was my robot friend referring to? The fact that I was rejected last year by the same guy twice on the same day or that my only friend is a robot.
Purple Princess: I'm sure, at a minimum, he is explaining to the president that General Hale didn't actually die in a traffic accident. How much Dad actually tells the man I'm not sure. Basically, he's there for damage control. Especially with Uncle Platypus still in Mumbai doing press there.
Anthony: Okay, now I wish we got here earlier. I’m kind of hungry and a snack pre-wedding would have been nice.
StarkAE: Is this secretary still planning to show up in four days?
Morgan’s dad: It’s on the way back from Pepper’s.
To celebrate AOS getting renewed, you’re getting this today. I’m ridiculously happy that you’re not seeing my condolence message that I pre-drafted just in case. The show definitely help me keep the story grounded in the MCU.
Tony: In addition to the diplomatic version of fuck off, he said that I should be a little mellower now that I have a boyfriend and therefore less likely to make murder bots again. According to Rhodey, I’m less likely to do stupid stuff when I’m with somebody. Then Ross mentioned that the Ultron incident happened when I was dating Pepper. Then Rhodey told him that we were on a break. So if that ends up all over the Internet, we know who’s to blame.
Steve: I'm sorry about that. That is something you would do.
Me: Although I’m half convinced that she just wanted the Captain America style tactical suit for role-play with Agent as soon as he gets his head out of his ass. Seriously, will they just kiss already?
Tony: We’re picking up your chocolate now and will be there in 20 minutes.
Francis: ????
Me: Then you add in the fact that there was this asshole playing head games to break up the Avengers because my idea to bring about world peace ended up killing his family and you get super complicated.
For the fun of it, I made a version of the 1990 Captain America movie exist in this universe.
Me: Do you think she’s making any progress?
Time sent: 03/25/2018 12:11:23
Me: I would just feel better if I could talk to her.
I’m not sure I can top your embarrassing story, nor do I really want to. Natasha kissed me on the escalators at Pentagon city to try to distract some Hydra agents during the fall of shield fiasco. It was ridiculously awkward and then she asked me if that was my first kiss since the 40s. I think I was more embarrassed that Natasha just assumed that was my first kiss in 70 years, then the kiss itself. She must think I am such a loser to assume I wouldn’t have had a girlfriend or boyfriend since waking up in the present. I want to ask if she knows about me dating Melinda now but I’m afraid to. I’m not sure if I’ll ever get the chance anyway.
“I was told pointblank to not say anything about Bucky being deprogrammed via any type of electronic communication. It’s almost like she’s testing me. I really, really want to get laid in Mumbai so I’m not to do anything that may accidentally lead the military to invade another country to get Steve’s BFF back.”
BITC: He’s actually gay?
"That I got."
Me: We are just pulling up to the White House now and I have to get Lila out of her car seat. I have to go.
Anthony: BTW Senator Ward’s brother was Hydra and he was the one who actually killed his parents and his brother so he could become one of the heads of the organization.
“That’s understandable. Things are complicated and I probably made them more complicated.”
Red phone: That bridge is already burned to ashes. I can barely comply with the thing as is. I know you can't.
Hunter: I'm not sure how to respond to that. You know I love kids. Which surprised me because when I was with Bobbi, I was okay with us not having any.
Red phone: I have mommy issues and daddy issues and serious Pepper issues which all require professional help.
“How is Clint? Did you get to see him? Tony’s more likely to give me a update on Laura and the kids.”
Melinda: It’s not a regular purse, it’s a Shield Mission purse with a hidden weapons compartment. It also contains her work lanyards and a Shield badge. It was issued in October 2016.
Tony Potts: That flip phone was ridiculous. I still have it somewhere, though.
Agent L. Barton: I’m aware after it was pointed out by Tony Potts. This is why we’re figuring out how to turn the Zephyr into a time machine instead of the suits. Apparently, your version is ready for space travel.
Nomad: That’s not good.
Agent Laura: I think Friday has notes on their research and the specs on their multidimensional communications device.
SimmonsJA: I see that you have finally come to me directly instead of asking Fitz to do your dirty work.
“I was close with my mom. We had to be. We couldn’t survive as long as we did otherwise. However, sometimes I wish she would’ve told me the truth instead of lying to me.” Steve confessed.
Number one May: Just promise me you’ll use condoms and lots of lube. And he will have to come over for dinner.
D: Wanda will text her later. I assume by souvenirs, you mean a reconstructed hammer? Yes. Ana should be pushing you footage now.
Dear James:
Steve: True. After that?
The Big Boss: No.
All of this made me realize that I am head over feet in love with you. I don’t know when it happened, but it did. I don’t even think it really was one moment. This had to be building for a while. It just took the thought of losing you to make me realize how important you are. I didn’t even get it in Siberia.
Melinda: Laura and Tony also speculate about Clint being a shape-shifting alien.
Anyway, I’m sorry I’ve been kind of in the boyfriend bubble for like the last week. Yes, adults do that stuff too. Or maybe I just do that sort of stuff because I kind of skipped high school. I’m starting to think high school is where you learn actual survival skills for the real world. I feel like I’m missing most of those. I’m sorry I did that. You don’t deserve for me to kind of go into the love bubble. I will try to be more responsive, even when I’m with my boyfriend.
Tony: Raising superheroes is hard.
Anthony: Sort of, but not really. I am at an undisclosed location with medical care. I signed myself out AMA and then allowed Agent Agent to hide me someplace secluded.
Spoiler warning: There are spoilers for Black Panther in this conversation but hey, Infinity War is just around the corner so I have to get it in now. (I’m watching Friday morning.) This conversation is where we encounter the first post credit scene.
Nomad: I’m painting and sketching. I have some stuff that I’m actually sending you, but not from the sessions.
Me: I am not breakfast.
Me: Red may have a point.
Dear Winter Soldier:
Agent M: I can’t say.
Anthony: I wish you could see me rolling my eyes right now.
“The situation with Ross was a bit more volatile at that point compared to here. That Mr. Stark refused to announce Spidey’s identity. His penance was to do these questions as part of a profile for the New York Times. However, after reading your responses, Jane felt it was inappropriate and scrapped the idea." The AI responded.
Me: Dammit. I was trying to distract you.
The new consultant: I wouldn't consider boyfriend sharing with somebody who wasn't at least a Level 3. Even Ned is just level 2.
“I’m going to go set up the connection to the director.” Davis tells his partner.
Blue phone: I’m okay. I’m still here.
“Why?”
Red phone: Laura is an only child and Clint's brother is a psychotic piece of shit that shouldn't be allowed to take care of a hamster, let alone human children. With you and Natasha MIA, Coulson legally dead, and Maria god knows where with Fury, I have managed to go to the top of the list which says many things considering I'm the reason why Clint is in hiding.
Counselor Laura from 2023: It's how they're differentiating me from the Laura of this timeline. Clint 2023 hasn't been a Shield Agent for a decade at this point.
“Is it because Talbot knows about me and could follow me right into the country?” Steve asked concerned.
Tony: I met a scientist from Wakanda 15 years ago at some conference. Although, I thought she was from Nigeria. I accidentally got her pregnant but she decided not to tell me, feeling it would be better to raise her daughter in Wakanda and away from me because I wouldn’t become halfway responsible for another five years. She died during a recent incident in Wakanda. Now that Wakanda is venturing out into the world, I was notified of my child’s existence and I don’t back down from my responsibilities.
Counselor Laura: Not at all.
HSBF: I mean that having to deal with senators thing.
Now is the time for Tony and Steve’s first virtual date. Although it doesn’t go as planned by any stretch of the imagination.
Me: Extremely complicated.
HSBF: And maybe in 70 years people will hear your name and instantly think of the Stark foundation or the Jarvis foundation.
“The source was correct and he was being essentially held captive by his sister. We walked in on her verbally and physically abusing his chrysalis. Don’t worry, he’s safe and under the observations of Dr. Suarez.” Leo exhaled in relief.
Me: No I’m at one of my very remote summer houses with the junior archers and my psychologist.
Me: Well not now after I read your letter. At least you are aware that what you did was stupid, and you were trying to get my nephew to tell me the truth.
"Then it's probably best that I'm in a long-distance relationship and next time I don't let Pepper convince me to bring Happy with me because she needs a couple of days to lick her wounds. I'm already planning on sending Happy to another hotel."
“To prevent what exactly?” Leo asked.
Tony: I don’t know if I would count the toddler. Right now he mostly likes to finger paint with me and by finger paint, I mean put blue handprints on my $10,000 suits. And that may not even happen anymore, now that they have their dad back. That means even less people in my life.
Anthony: Nope. I think they based the design off of your old Shield uniform, but with the new eagle up front and with 100% more fake muscles.
Me: This explains why you are texting me right now.
I didn't mean to make this a Laura and Tony Potts friendship story, but it just kind of happened. They both need a friend right now.
Football Hunter: You’re receiving an eight-figure salary plus royalties. They always come back when there’s money. That’s the only time they care to come back.
Melinda: We’re still trying to wrap up the Morrow situation.
Me: Dammit. That’s the Avenger emergency line. Please tell me it’s not blue aliens come to enslave us via weird bracelets.
Me: Yo-Yo’s boyfriend was there and he likes me.
“I think he will,” James replied.
Me: I try.
Me: I know that as well. Love you too. At least we can talk to each other more now.
Purple arrow: My wife was kidnapped by another version of myself from five years into the future. Worst of all, I wasn’t there.
Me: Seriously?
Me: Like you had Clint do to me after Tony almost got killed at the banquet?
Tony: I’m trying anyway. I need to go. Laura, from the good timeline, just showed up in my lab with coffee. Give the babies my love.
Tony: You totally want to avoid any conversations about what Ross knows about our sex life?
TMNS: Sure. I know about your old crush, there’s no point in covering it up.
Tony: That’s okay. Let’s be honest I still would’ve sent this message anyway.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous.
“That’s not true.” He was not sure if he was lying to Natasha or himself. Happy was more aware of the cracks in the relationship between Tony and Virginia than most people. Virginia was always a mess when Tony was on missions. That’s why she ended things when he started searching for Hydra.
Tony: Actually, Coulson’s team came across someone with that power. When he touched somebody they would see how somebody else was going to die. Allegedly Skye Quake saw her boyfriend saving the world in a prophecy vision and I don’t want to see that. I don’t want to know how you’re going to die. I’m still hoping that the vision from Wanda was just a mind fuck sort of thing and not a vision of the future.
Me: I don’t think Liberty is going to see it that way and is still going to want to be there to hold his Iron Teddy Bear’s hand through the entire thing.
HSBF: Yes, I was being serious. She managed to crack your encryption in about a week.
“I never thought I would hear you talk about kids like this.”
HSBF: What really happened with that? You talked a little about it last time, but you weren’t up to talk about anything too serious.
Me: They don’t even have CFCs anymore.
Morgan’s dad: You tell me. We will have time travel perfected. Your time heist can continue as planned. Although, please no more time kidnappings. Laura’s lovely, but still no.
Red phone: Fuck, cancer sucks.
To: Tony_Carbonell-Rogers
Blue phone: That’s good to know. I guess it’s my turn.
Person my boss is in love with: Is it weird that I find it cute that he’s sleeping with a Captain America Teddy bear?
“Well Tony would just be mad at me despite the fact that would mean you would be in the same country as him and he could have conjugal visits.” The director joked, he thinks.
Counselor Laura: While you're doing that, I will talk to Scott and get a readout of what actually happened with somebody named Ghost five years ago.
HSBF: I’m not sure how to take that, but it’s possible.
I just want to let you know that the final chapter of the story has been written and is now off for proofreading. So the chapter count is final (unless some get split up). Including this chapter, there are 15 chapters remaining. If we stay on schedule, everything will be posted before Endgame comes out.
HSBF: Yes.
Looking back at it now, we were both afraid of the exact same thing, but we had different ideas on how to handle it. It probably would've helped if we actually told each other what we were thinking. We didn't. We were way too good at talking over each other. We were too busy assuming that we thought we knew what the other was thinking to ask.
Me: I fucking love you.
For those of us who remember the Agents of Shield/ Winter Soldier convergence I'm going to try to avoid that by giving everybody a little more time than three days to watch the movie. Also, I'm going to try to write things so major plot points will not be given away, at least not until August. That part of the story will be written from Tony’s perspective so it shouldn’t be too hard. I promise to label the chapters when we get there and I'll also be adding Spider-man to the tags.
“You can if you wish to, when you write to him. If you choose to write to him. However, I feel I made the right choice. I wasn’t sure he would actually send a letter and you needed to know what he was thinking,” she said as she followed behind James as he walked into his house.
Me: Yes. Something happened?
“Very aware but you kind of killed her good father. So surrogate daughter of Phil is a little angry, and she could split a continent apart when she’s angry or blow a man to pieces, not the fun way.” Hunter remarked, Leo just rolled his eyes at his boyfriend. Daisy glared.
So did you figure out who the package is?
This conversation takes place on October 12, 2016 Tony’s time. However, it’s October 13 where Steve is.
The Mechanic: It’s mostly been in Queens and that one time in the DC Metro. Also, people would argue against the adult thing. According to Fox News, I’m an overgrown toddler with too much money and no common sense
“And maybe have Friday reactivate the breathalyzer lab protocol,” Laura suggested.
Ana Junior: Yes. It will be transferred to your server. Afia would also like to know if she can go over to Ned’s tonight.
Me: That could be why the drinking got worse but that was a Howard problem, not a Tony problem.
CoulsonPJ: Probably. I have to go. I’m security for the announcement.
“It’s not. Although it is 2018, Deke Shaw, grandson of Leopold J. Fitz and Jemma A. Simmons.”
Anthony: How did you figure out the Antonio Rogers thing?
D Fitzsimmons: I wonder what my boss will think of that. It's less strange than the fact that my grandfather is sleeping with Hunter. I guess Nana and Bobo have the same taste in men. This is so weird.
Cuddle fiancé: Point
Me: Why didn’t you tell me that my nephew had superpowers? How did that even happen?
To be continued.
Dear Ms. Potts:
“It seems you actually know what you’re talking about sometimes.” Tony smiled at him.
Venom: Did Afia gave you that label or MJ?
“Which means we have to work through our mountain of bull shit. Yeah, we definitely need an Avenger therapist. Maybe we should do couples therapy?” Tony suggested.
Friday: I have not been helping your not-a-husband avoid you.
Clint quickly cut off his phone and then proceeded to take out the Sim card. That was flushed down the toilet of the stall he was messaging from. The phone itself was tossed in the pond near the airport before he got on the plane to Palau with his fake South African passport. He wasn’t that surprised to find Wanda with a new Stark phone waiting for him at the safe house when he arrived 20 hours later.
Tony Potts: That's never a good combination. Do you know about Tiberius?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: I have to go. Dad and Cap Dad are here to apologize. Peter may get a car out of this in addition to the townhouse.
“And not being an alcoholic because he was a mean drunk sometimes. Not physically, but emotionally." Tony added.
“On the bright side, dad has convinced your mom to let you take a personal day Monday. He says he's calling May next." At her words, Peter looks at the text message that just popped up on his phone.
Timeline wise the events of the Defenders occurred before Civil War, so about six months before the current point in the story. That is part of the reason why I haven’t been incorporating too many things from the other TV shows. Shield lines up closest to the movies, but even they play in their own world. It’s a fun world though. I’m not going to do gratuitous crossovers for the sake of gratuitous crossovers. If people are here, they are important to the story.
The Mechanic: No but yes. You’re different and people throughout the world are afraid of you because of that. You’re just starting to come to terms with the fact that you’re different than everyone else and maybe you want to keep that to yourself for a while because you’re not ready for others to look at you differently including the ones you love. You haven’t even completely acknowledged what this means to yourself yet.
Subject: We would love to have you at the avenger compound
“That’s for killing Coulson.” That explains why Daisy chose to send Joey in her place as the inhuman UN Avengers representative. Not that Leo blames her for wanting to get revenge.
The Boy in the Chair: Hold out for MIT tuition. What townhouse?
Anthony:  I know. After Lily bear tipped me off, Laura told me about your reaction and the fact you are spending quality time with your therapist for a little while. Also, our little red mystic sent pictures through her not-a-boyfriend.
Me: So how was your day, Honey Bunches? It must be dinnertime where you are.
We are on Avenger channels in this conversation. I debated whether this conversation could happen on personal channels, but this does become a business conversation because the purple one is coming. Leo Fitz of the prime timeline, a.k.a. James Leopold, is Chief Monkey Lover. He is also head of the UN Avengers. Tony gets Chief Mechanic now since he is the head of the ATCU. Mack’s call name might have some variant of mechanic in there as well. He is the West Coast division head at the moment. They are terribly busy on the West Coast right now. This might be a good time for you to check out Ant-man and the Wasp for background purposes.
Anthony: The person who decided on a 6 AM wedding.
Anthony: Putting a warmonger in charge of the State Department is not his finest hour. However, the people under Ross are trying to make sure other governments do not use their enhanced persons as weapons of the state under the peaceful use of enhanced person section of the Accords as they simultaneously ignore their boss. They take their oath to uphold the Constitution and serve the people seriously, regardless of who is in charge.
Me: Of course not. I want you to be Director because you won't send an 11-year-old girl to the Raft because her parents do not feel comfortable with her wearing a tracking bracelet. Time with the new boyfriend is just a bonus.
“I think there’s a difference when it’s a terminal illness. I always thought I was going to die young, so I wanted to make the most out of every moment so I wouldn’t have any regrets.” Steve confessed. Tony had no idea he felt that way.
Tony: He was a hero. His evidence helped us catch a bad guy or at least that’s the story that should be going around school. That should make him cool.
This conversation takes place a little under a day after the last one on September 23, 2016. Also, a reminder that there are some text message/email/phone call conversations that you don’t get to see outside of Tony and Steve interaction. We are mostly doing the highlights. I’m not sure if you really want to read Tony begging various doctors to let him sleep with his boyfriend in between other meetings. Be rest assured, he did, multiple times.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You're so lovely. We are still in the "bad choices were made" timeline.
Tosha: Also, Fitz was killed about a month before the decimation, sort of. It’s complicated. Although I don’t think she knows how complicated yet and I’m not going to be the one to tell her.
Xxxxxx
Director Snookums: Mostly because they actually think I can mind you. Obviously they’re unaware I’ve never been successful.
“I’ve noticed that,” Laura said as she typed out a response to Tony.
Me: I don’t think anyone really is. My ex science bro always said the guy was a dick. So I’m sure there must be more. Considering how many sexual harassment complaints SI HR made go away regarding Obadiah, that I didn’t find out about until after he literally ripped my heart out, I’m sure there’s more bodies buried somewhere.
Tony: Possibly trying to convince the other May to let up on the grounding and to work with Ben. Scary May was supposed to do it, but she is still out there looking for Purple Arrow. I mean, we put all this effort into bringing him back and then he goes dark. Asshole.
Cuddle Bunny: Tony, please write me back. I’m worried.
Tony: It’s been eight years and the realization that he is married to me in another timeline. That’s a lot of baggage to bring into bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Blue phone: Being betrayed by your friend hurts a lot.
“I’m abstaining because anything can be a slippery slope for me,” and this whole entire mess with that other timeline has been making him crave a drink for a while. “However, one of the good things about the snap is they decriminalized marijuana. I’ll get you a breakup starter kit.” Tony said seriously.
"Of course you do. So what else happened in Siberia? Why did you and Steve ended up physically fighting each other?" This is why his boyfriend shouldn't have a professional for a friend. Laura would do this. Laura did do this, which is how we ended up getting help in the first place.
The rest of this A/N contains spoilers for season seven of AOS, especially episode 7.4. But hey, it’s on Disney plus and Netflix now (depending on your country) so go watch it. However, because of events in Agents of Shield season seven, I decided that our timeline actually diverged in 1955 slightly. Most things happened in both timelines. However, there were a few differences. Such as Aunt Peggy being there to help Tony come to terms with his sexuality and letting him know that Steve Rogers was not heterosexual.
Venom: Yes. Ana is working on that.
Tony: I’m available to answer questions. Although I’m going to go to Steve now because I’m exhausted. We are totally going to end up sharing a bed, aren’t we?
Morgan’s dad: I'm assuming the other 2018?
Blue phone: I’m glad you found your people among the scientists.
For those of you who want to see Tony send inappropriate text messages to Nick Fury, check out my new short story Burn Phone after Reading. It’s not set in this universe, but it’s still fun and I’m pretty sure that Tony still has a crush on Steve.
Director Snookums: The media doesn't see it that way. Also let’s be honest, people are more afraid of an Asian woman with superpowers than a blonde white guy with a six-pack.
Anthony: How did you even know about that?
“Friday princess, can you please get daddy a copy of the initial Shield report and the FBI report?" Tony asked the travel version of Friday on his phone. He really wanted to know what the hell was going on and Agent Agent was being extra cryptic.
Me: Did you lose consciousness?
HSBF: Good to know.
Me: That’s May. I think I want to stay Nomad, if I come back.
“Yes, although I forgot that Simmons would be here this time,” Leo lamented. “I didn’t calculate for that.”
Tony: Well, I will have some late-night reading when the kids are sleeping, and May has her little chat with you. That is if you'll come along?
“I don’t think it would help,” Steve said darkly.
Time sent: 11/12/2016 22:21:41
Tony: That sounds like something patches would do.
Red phone: They wanted weapons again. I told them no. They wanted the Iron Man armor. I told them hell no. Then I reminded them that I’m completely open to being Secretary of Defense. At least with me, they wouldn’t have to worry about the boss turning out to be Hydra.
The new consultant: How much do you know?
Hunter: This is still not bad news.
“We are stubborn as mules. We're just now working through our issues. I think part of that is because we now know that there is a version of us that actually did fix things and are getting married.” Because the other Steve and Tony gave him hope that maybe things could be fixed.
Me: It’s not a done thing. I would have to get through a confirmation hearing after Rice goes through hers. Although, as you mentioned earlier, she is one of Ellis’s most trusted advisors.
CoulsonPJ: I don't know if you can apologize for dying.
Blue phone: You're no longer going to try to talk me into signing?
Anthony: I haven’t even locked myself in the lab with 2 gallons of coffee, let alone with Jack, Jim, or José, either version. This is probably the healthiest way I’ve dealt with a major crisis ever.
“Kree blood,” Hunter answered, and Leo just glared.
Nomad: What happened in October 1997?
“Well, obviously not for being the merchant of death. I still have nightmares about Morgan finding that stupid sex tape that Tiberius made behind my back after my parents died. That’s going to be a fun conversation.” That’s a conversation he never wants to actually have.
Purple Princess: Oh great, we have a leak problem. Of course, Flash would notice something. She was Hydra, by the way.
I also don’t want to lead various world governments to you, at least right now. There are a few that know about me, like the new head of the replacement for Shield. At the moment we have an understanding. I’m not sure how long that’s going to last, because he may be moving to another agency soon, but again I’m hopeful.
Me: No it’s not. Do you want to talk about almost losing Phil again?
“Of course he set that up.” Tony sighed, but he's kind of happy that his friend was that protective.
“Then you’re delusional because that’s just not feasible. At best, your plan was wishful thinking. We are low on Pym particles that we are unable to reverse engineer despite Deke being able to reverse engineer anything. Regardless of Bruce’s help and Deke coming across some old notes on the SI servers, we barely figured out how to create a time guidance system. That’s only because we had the residue energy from the monolith to help. No one else may be willing to admit it, but there’s no way we're going to be able to reverse what Thanos did, but we could at least get Fitz and Laura back.” May looks like she is near seconds from punching Simmons, but Steve quickly leaves Laura to physically hold May back.
“Of course there was. At least before, when we were trading text messages, I could say what I wanted to tell you out loud, then look at it on screen and realize maybe if I want to avoid a fight, I should not send that.”
HSBF: I’m OK with that.
Tony:  OK, so Jane still will not budge on the New York Times interview, so we should probably work our way through the questions.
Thank you for your well wishes and the cookies. You found my favorites. They are appreciated. I’m sorry I didn’t mention the allergies. I don’t like for people to have to do extra things for me.
“Thank you.”
Anthony love: Do we need to worry about a second set of aliens invading?
May: Apparently, that picture she drew last week of you and Tony waking up in bed together came true. Pepper sent pictures. You look happy. I think that’s the most peaceful you’ve looked in the morning since we were neighbors in DC.
Agent Melinda May’s cell phone
Nomad: And you tried to defend Pepper’s honor?
D: I know.
Tony: I think Ross said something to him. Simmons is having coffee with his assistant to see if she can find anything out. Friday has video footage of the two meeting up, but no audio and unfortunately neither were facing the camera so the lip-reading program won’t work. So, old-fashioned dirty detective work is our only hope.
“That was planned, wasn’t it?” Flash asked as he opened the fridge. There are three bags in the refrigerator with their names on them.
“Not quite the Woods but not horrible,” Tony remarked.
You completely deserve the good chocolate gift basket. I promise I wasn’t intentionally avoiding your calls. We just actually forgot to bring a cell phone with us. And it turns out that my watch is not boyfriend proof. It kind of fell in the ocean.
To be continued
“Then that means that you are already rebuilding, Sergeant Barnes.”
Steve: Never. Do you think that maybe Clint would tell Laura?
“She's a friend," Deke argued.
“That’s sweet. Don’t worry, they are talking.” Natasha said as she walked into the room and shut the door behind her.
Anthony: Although you’re planning to make my life outside an absolute madhouse. The media is going to pounce on the fact I’m gay and they will see it as gay because apparently there’s no such thing as bisexual or pansexual. Pepper’s boyfriend still thinks that she was just my beard.
“I’m not the head of the Avengers, Natasha is. Melinda is the director of Shield, though. This might be why she was able to get into the phone, and she gave me permission to keep looking. I assume things are different where you are?”
Cuddle Bunny: At least you are smart enough to know that a database of all enhanced people is dangerous if it’s easy for anybody to break into.
BITC: Because she threatened to take him back to court if he did. I know they won’t listen to me when I tell them that I would rather live with my dad full time. They didn’t last time.
Tony: Sometime last night, apparently. That’s why I’m going to be in DC for a while lobbying against it. I have to protect my kids.
“Do we just bring back the people who were snapped, or do we bring back everybody who died from other complications? Should we bring back Yo-Yo or Vision?” Steve added to their list of ethical dilemmas.
Me: Yes. Although it helps that they were trying to kill me to do more bad things with the money.
Counselor Laura: So not to alarm you, but a version of my estranged husband just popped up in my living room with a new tattoo that covers most of his arm and midlife crisis hair. He also says that he is from the year 2023.
BITC: He was planning to tell you when we are in Europe. He was saving up to get you a black Dalia necklace.
“Love you too.” Steve said as he tries to take off Tony’s shirt. That’s when he felt himself being pushed away from Tony. He looked up to see Tony’s assistant standing smugly in the doorway (his sources have provided him with pictures of Tony’s new associates). Tony did not seem happy to see her there. What followed was a rapid exchange in Spanish, that Steve could only make out every other word of.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely lovely.
Cuddle Bunny: I didn’t get there till later.
Tony: I’m looking forward to you proving that.
Agent Laura: Also, her boyfriend is your nanny. I think she needs to stay with Hunter for a while. She’s better when she’s with him. She won’t make it without him.
Genius Princess 2018: That seems out of character from what we know about the purple one from Robin’s drawings. I would like to hear the story of how Hunter became Tony’s nanny.
Anthony: In your defense, I was kind of in the middle of a blackout rage. I’m sure you understand considering what you did to Clint’s jaw.
“Although now we know that Robin's drawings were a version of one future,” Shuri said from across.
“I’d rather just hug you.” Steve said putting an arm around her. “We made a lot of bad choices without all the information and we can’t change what we did but we can move forward. We can learn to actually talk to one another instead of just assuming the worst.”
The Big Boss: I see that Clint is now back in the good graces of the US government. Of course, the announcement was drowned by the ‘Tony Stark is now gay’ stories circulating everywhere.
“Jane wanted to publicly announce Peter as an Avenger after the Vulture incident. Unfortunately, that still happened in the other timeline. Happy was upset about your relationship with Steve and ignored the ATCU sanction plan to move the weapons upstate away from the kids.
“I’m trying. Does dealing with my Board of Directors on behalf of the US government for decades count as diplomatic experience? I mean, you know they’re assholes.”
Tony Potts: You do have a point. You’re right, I did not react well to Steve getting married even knowing that it was a semi platonic thing to get children. Like I had to schedule my own trip to rehab the day after the ceremony. Pepper left.
HSBF: Okay. Thank you for doing this.
Blue phone: Why is that?
Blue phone: It serves them right for spying on you like that.
Red phone: Although somehow Natasha was the one who ended up doing my psych evaluation while I was dying. It didn't paint me in a very favorable light. Ironman, yes. Tony Stark, no.
To be continued
Me: Yes, I’m always this infuriating. Bobbi says it’s my gift. Which explains why we are never ever getting back together. Seriously, why did my other self think about marrying her again? I’m glad they got interrupted by ninjas. He really dodged a bullet there.
Nomad: Maybe they can be given out to random employees.
Counselor Laura: Daniel didn't want to get Peggy involved, so he went to your father, and they started investigating. At least that’s what we could piece together from the papers we found in the Krazy Kanoe (it was an old Shield safe house).
Red spider: That I don’t think Daisy and I were even together. She was the one who fought the Confederacy, and she ended up getting dusted when Thanos snapped his fingers.
Pepper pot: That must be awful for you.
“That should be fun,” Steve replied sarcastically.
Me: Later, boyfriend.
TMNS: I don’t want you dead, especially because of me. I don’t need more blood on my hands.
Purple arrow 2018: Hey, we're about to lose the window, but we'll talk soon.
