“Good for this, bad for injuries. Good. Please, don’t stop,” Steve murmurs, a thirst so potent in his tone that it commands Tony.
Burgers and beer happened to be drive-through and meet up at Steve’s apartment. They walked up and past the door of the nurse who lived across the hall from him. He rarely bumped into Kate. Nonetheless, Natasha slowed down in front of her door as if she wanted to listen in and see if the nurse might be at home. He only raised an eyebrow at her and then turned to unlock his door. They ended up in the living room, chowing down, with a six pack of beer between them, though Natasha bought a milkshake as well.
“So, you’re ready to go?” He doesn’t like the idea of Tony coming with him, but he truly has no other choice. It is, after all, an invitation for Tony to visit with Schmidt.
Doubt flitters over the prince’s expression, but Steve remains stoic. Clearing his throat, Tony shifts his attention to Obie. “Listen, Obie, I think I’m going to call it. Pepper and Rhodey can represent me during the lunch. Would you please tell everyone that I’m ill and need the afternoon to rest?” He doesn’t wait for Obie to respond, instead he returns to Steve. “Let’s go. I think I need some help.”
He didn't turn to face her - he couldn't - it hurt too much. His heart pounded against his chest, causing an ache in his sternum. "We can't leave him alone with the Red Skull. The Sith try to convert Jedi. They did it before - with the Emperor. The First Order is worse, they’ll try and change him."
With only a short grunt from the pain, Steve moves to his side, slowly, hesitantly placing his hands on Tony’s shoulders. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. That’s not going to happen to me, you know that, right?”
Tony released a breath he hadn’t know he was holding, and Natasha freed his hand as she inhaled and exhaled over and over. Clint was the only one of their trio who managed to formulate words to respond, “Do you think Tony could see him?”
Sorry for the delay in this chapter. I was out of town. I will be working on this and Code of Silence for the foreseeable future with some breaks for one shots and that's it. Hope you enjoy this chapter.
It hurts when he leaves the room. It hurts when he sits in his own room listening to the winds howl and rattle. It hurts in the dark.
“Anything but-.” She curls a finger at him, and he quickly falls into step with her. “I want to tell you that you’ve gotten high marks from all of your clients. I have you booked for the next three months. People are clamoring to be with you. You’re approach to make them feel special is really working.”
“Can you select one?” Steve says. He doesn’t want to do that. “Just someone big and strong, and someone powerful enough to -.” He looks away and then adds, “I’m a sub.”
Just to tell you the slow burn doesn't mean the you will do without romance. It will be there, just not the way you thought. Also - next chapter - Tony discovers something about himself that leaves him more isolated than before!
Steve bows his head and pinches his nose. He sighs and then looks at Tony. “You know how that sounds, right? No. You have to go. They need to run tests.”
“Thank god that man is a dick,” Tony says. It does mean that Hammer won’t be giving to the Maria Stark Foundation and his gift is always sizable. “Think Pym will be interested in giving?”
“Okay, then, who are you all?” Steve scratches at his healing wound, and waits out the shifting glances. “You there, in the back, who are you?”
“It means we’re in for a load more of fun.” Tony steps up to the arch. “In the original story it emitted ripples in time, but I doubt that’s what Ultron is going to use it for, he’s not that creative.”
“I knew I had to get back,” Steve says. Tony expects him to be staring at Bucky and Sam, but no. He only has eyes for Tony. “I knew I needed to be here. I waited before and I lost out. I waited 9 years this time. I don’t plan to miss out again.”
Tony smiled, squeezing Steve’s hands. The flare of his energy shone in his chest and warmed his hands. “Yeah.”
“But I thought we were science bros and now you’re mind melding with Grandpa Spangles. How is science ever going to understand soul packs if they’re so insular?” Tony shook his head. He needed to stop. He was never going to be a part of the pack, even as an outsider. “That’s just great. I thought you were on my side.”
Stepping up to the parties, Steve stands at ease and greets them. “Sir Stark, welcome to the Living Station of the Inner Belts.”
“Let’s just say that woman is scary sneaky,” Steve said and then finished dressing. “I have to go, Sweetheart.”
“Do you even remember my parents? You killed them. You strangled my mother. You son of a bitch!” Tears ran down his cheeks and he opened the faceplate and the helmet folded down. He wanted to look the killer of his mother in the eyes. “You don’t even know me. How could you even remember them?”
“Hmm,” Steve says. “I don’t know if tired is the word for it. I would say it’s more like chasing away the ever gnawing emptiness. I don’t think the scientists or doctors get how my metabolism works. It took me quite a while to get used to it. For the longest time, the nights were the worst. I finally learned to eat right before bed, and then bring snacks to bed with me.”
Protests died on his lips. The energy to move, to speak, bled away until his eyes felt heavy and he followed the darkness down into slumber. As he drifted down into oblivion he would have liked to say goodbye one last time.
“No. It’s fine. I’m just not used to talking about it. I only talk with Sam and Nat sometimes, but most of the time I keep it inside.”
Since he was a teenager always sick with one physical malady after another and then he realized his own desires, he’s always felt off, wrong. Even as he grew and put on muscle and strength, it only served to cause him more anxiety, more issues with his body. He’d always felt like he stepped into a pod and some scientists did something to him to remake him, change him, transform him into something
“God, why do you always go with leaving? I thought you stuck up for yourself? I thought you were the kid in the alleyways getting beat up for your morals. I’m not asking you to leave.”
Natasha uses her nails to dig into his hair. “Always use protection for penetration. I don’t abide my barebacking. Keep yourself clean and shaved. I’m going to do it for you this first time. But you should probably learn how to do it yourself. If you don’t like to do it, one of the other workers can always give you a hand.” She rinses his hair. “Keep your face shaved too. Some clients have a certain type and you’re it. They don’t want to see hairy faces.”
In the background, Tony hears the distinctive slash and slide of Logan’s claws, but he ignores it. If Logan gets out of control, Bruce is here. The Hulk can stop the Wolverine.
Steve adjusts his bag that Tony handed over to him. “It’s okay. I have some other options.” Not much, his bag is mostly for survival. It will come in handy in this place.
He’s missed life again. He studies both of them, trying to make out how long it’s been. He doesn’t ask, because part of him doesn’t want to know. When did he become a coward? How is that even possible?
“Oh, oh,” Tony says and then gestures at Steve. “Look at him.” He needs to face the guy again. “Sorry – I – he needs first aid. Do you have anything?”
“I know,” Steve says. He’s not interested in the game right now. He lays his head back against the side of the vehicle as the engine roars to life. “Why’d you call the guard Elmo?”
“No! No, no, no!” Tony screamed into the murky shadows, for the red turned to brown and then to mud. He yelled out, as if to a god he didn’t truly believe in. “What the hell are you doing? Stop it! Bring him back! Bring him back!”
“I’m not sure calling him on his language is going to stop him,” Tony says as he tastes the beer. It’s actually a dark ale, heady and deep.
Steve follows direction and hears Tony shift around to his injured side. “This is going to sting a little at first.”
“Fuck, I know. Don’t you think I know? He knows everything, everything that JARVIS knew. He knows what’s ever on the internet, and now he knows more.” Tony drops down next to Steve. “We’re royally fucked.”
A large man with the deepest most beautiful tones of color gracing his skin greets them as they enter the shop. He wears a pale peach suit and a broad smile. Grabbing both of Steve’s hands he says, “The famous Steve Rogers. I hear great things about you.” He winks and says to Clint. “I might find my way to the brothel to visit sooner than I thought.”
He can't help but giggle and he wonders what Yinsen thinks of him. He glances over at the man who somehow manages to keep a small bit of a civilized air around him even in the hell of the cave and the terror from their captors. He has no idea how long Yinsen has suffered through a captivity. All he knows is that he's only got this thin reed of a man with a calm voice and a quiet demeanor to get him through the days.
“Oh, is this my reward for drinking this swill?” Tony picks up the sugar cookie, thinks about dunking it into the tea, decides against it, and bites the cookie. “Don’t want to poison the cookie.”
“Sure do.” Steve leans over and opens the thermos, pours the steaming cocoa, and then reaches over for Tony’s hand. It’s callused and rough; it has so many stories. “Here you go.”
“Sorry. You got the dreams, too?” Steve said as he finished pouring the coffee and then set the milk carton on the table with the sugar bowl.
“Do you not like the Asgardians?” Tony says as he motions for the footman to clear his plate. “Thor is a very jovial man. Asgard fell on some terrible years centuries ago, but he’s weathered it. Seems the Asgardians are somewhat immortal or very long lived.”
“I know.” Steve smiled yet it ached. “I understand. Intellectually, I get it. But I keep telling myself it was only a day. A day. How could something that only took a day deplete me.”
“That’s true, as far as I know,” Rhodey says, but shrugs. “There’s a possibility they might have had something covert going on, I could look into it for you. I can’t promise anything.”
Then he heard the panting, heavy and thick. He searched along the side of the door frame for the light switch. Finding it, he pushed the upper button and the single bulb switched on, its amber light flickering on Bucky as he sat in the corner, knees up, arms limp on his knees, and a feral, angry look on his face.
The man furrows his brows. “Is this a physics book, a psychology book, or one of those pseudo-science books?”
“Where are they? Where is the ambulance?” His heart races, throbbing and exploding in his chest. “God damn it, JARVIS, call the ambulance.”
Steve turned slightly to the side and opened a hand to Tony. “I am not here to argue with you, Tony. I just wanted to clear the air. After last nig- after yesterday I wanted to discuss some truths with you.”
“There is no way I am riding and you’re walking this horse. You ride, or we both walk, nothing else will do.” Steve holds his injured arm against his chest.
It hit him what had really happened. “Oh.” Through the bond. They were communicating somehow. “How’s that work?”
“Steven, this is not a trick nor is it magic. It is soup. Please drink. My son spoke only good things of you so I am certain you would know his dead mother is not lying to you.”
“You know I met you,” the thin rail of a man says. “Once. At a conference. You didn’t really listen to me.”
Tony puts on his regular non-enhancement pair of sunglasses. “I’m going to my lab. Be ready by ten. See you around Steve.”
“Yeah, maybe,” Steve murmured as Tony led the way into the suite. They went toward the sitting room. Steve liked the comfort of the room, but at the same time he missed feeling at home. Yet he knew he hadn’t felt like that in ages. “So, do we want to work on the Mantra first?”
For some reason, Steve feels insanely, inexplicably protective of Tony and holds him closer, allowing his head to fall against his chest. Tony grabs onto him, tugging the fabric of his Cambric shirt, but Steve doesn’t complain. He walks toward the house, remembering their words from earlier in the evening, their dance and touch of flesh and their kiss. It is something he longs for, something wants deeply.
Shaking himself out of his shock, Steve replies, “No. No, sir. I can see if Tony is interested in speaking with you.”
Tony only nods and sculks away as if being told by a teacher to go sit in a corner. It almost causes Steve to change his mind, but he stops himself. He has to live on Prime after Tony’s gone. It’s bad enough Steve’s managed to piss off Rumlow – who literally works as security on the station – having Tony add to his negative reputation will only incite further problems.
Tony pants in Steve’s arm but manages to right himself. Crackles of thunder streak the sky and Steve smells the ozone as lightning splits the gray clouds with brilliant blue-white flashes. It harkens back Thor commanding the lightning. For a second, Steve misses the god of thunder, but there’s no time for sentimentality. With Tony tucked under his arm, Steve fights for purchase as lightning arcs across the sky.
“I think over the bridge Happy said that the vendors are stationed.” Tony taps his implant. “Yep, that’s where.” He points to the little stone bridge that curves over the bubbling stream.
His distracted by her information. “What? The Synthezoids are coming here? They never interact with the Conclave!”
As he wrestles with the massive beast of a man, Tony recognizes he’s outmuscled and underpowered, but there’s nothing for it – he’s not leaving until he can get this goon out of Steve’s apartment. A fist to his face nearly lands, but Tony’s fast enough to avoid it; there’s some advantage to being the smaller one in a battle. He learned that at boarding school.  He squirms under the oaf and knees upward trying to get his balls. A hand grasps the man’s shoulder and yanks. Even in his weakened state, Steve handles Tony’s attacker with ease.
“More than that,” Steve said. “Sorry, don’t know why I got all emotional. I’m usually not like that.”
“The baffles should keep the wind from causing too much trouble,” Steve says but already he feels the heat and leans toward it. He cringes as his hands thaw.
Steve had forced his injured traumatized body out of the bed and tried to reach out to his friend to stop beating Tony, stop ramming his head against the wall, stop trying to kill him.
Rumlow weighed what Tony threatened. Tony watched as he went through the possibilities. Just as Tony was about to offer proof of his intentions, Rumlow arched a brow and said, “No skin off my nose. You don’t even know who he is. He could be someone that was a murderer, that volunteered. That gets
She leans down and kisses the crown of his head. “Now, we can be friends. Not boss and employee. Isn’t that better.”
“This is completely my fault, sir. I should have had everything in order when you arrived. I thought I had. I thought all of the staff had signed. But the haste-.”
“Increase tension by twofold,” Rumlow directed, and the nanotech answered him. The mechanism embedded in the floor and ceiling cranked alive. It strung Steve’s limbs and pulled him toward the corners of the room. He struggled but the more he moved it seemed to feedback to the nanobots, making them that much more powerful. “Let’s keep him there while I work on his wound.” Rumlow studied Steve. “You know, when I heard they thawed you, I was kind of excited. Everyone knows your story. Everyone thought you would be a savior for the V-Corps.” He chuckled. “Weren’t we the fools?” He took out a small penlight from his vest. “Not fools anymore, huh?”
Once the horses are watered, Steve goes about sorting through the supplies. There isn't much, it's only a day trip and Steve should be able to get a rabbit, or other small game for their dinner. He pulls out the tin and brings it over to Tony who has settled down on a few stumps of trees along the rocky foothills.
I'm excited to present this chapter - lots of twists and turns here. It's far longer than I intended, but I am so happy to finally be able to post it today.
Steve inhales and exhales and then says, “I’m sorry.” He pauses and then continues, “Tony is important to me as well. I don’t want any harm to come to him. Believe me when I tell you that I am upset about what happened. But his enthusiasm-.”
Steve studied Tony’s hand clasped to his own. The roughness of it belied the fact that he was a billionaire. The calluses, the whisper of stains on the nails, all said something else, something different. Tony was different than Steve had assumed.
“You said that,” Steve says and cannot get over the feeling that a large mortar blast crashed into his head to leave him numb and confused. “I’m sorry, but I’m not following? I just came here to get my horse shoed.”
The enormity hits Tony like a plasma laser to the chest. “Steve, no. No, why have you denied yourself? All this time. Surely, Doctor Erskine couldn’t have foreseen everything that’s happened in the world. Wouldn’t he have been open to new things, learning new thoughts on the subject?”
The lighting effect fades to a muted blue green but the bed still looks enticing and comforting. Further into the room he finds an attached bathroom that’s beyond his wildest dreams. A soaking tub and a jetted tub, a walk in shower that’s bigger than Steve’s room at the brothel with so many shower heads he can’t fathom how the ship has a large enough store for the water.
He stepped into the elevator only to have Rumlow and members of his Strike team rush to get on the car as well. He nodded to Steve and then the doors closed. “It’s a shame. Don’t you think?”
The fire cracks and pops drawing Steve’s attention away from him. The orange flames flicker in his too blue eyes. He speaks lowly, hushed as if in reverence to his memories. “He was a kind man, a gentle man. He listened to me, respected me. He treated me like an equal when so many didn’t. They only saw me as a weakling.” He looks down at his hands. “I always had big hands, you know. My mother said some day I would grow big enough to fit into my hands.” He clears his throat and the memories fade from his features. “What was I saying?”
“Oh.” Steve’s words die in his throat. What can he say to that confession? “I-silly. I thought it survived for some reason.” He doesn’t admit that he’d thought it was because of his transcendental love. Because he knows – if he gets right down to it – that he loved Peggy mainly from afar. He laughs a little – a lot like now. He looks up at Tony, desperately wanting not to repeat history again, yet just as desperately muted and somber with reality. “I guess some things, some things were never meant to be.” He tears his glance away before Tony can meet it.
Tony knew he would come to hate the idea of privacy in the different apartments, but at the same time he hated being the weird overlord peeping into people’s lives. “Okay. I’m going there now.”
“Surely, I do not know, Mer Rogers. But perhaps you may broach it differently. Tell your friend that you are now employed as an Escort?”
Steve had swallowed down the bile and hugged an unresponsive Tony closer. He’d convinced Tony earlier to remove the armor. He stared at Bucky across the short distance in the jet. He wanted to call out, to say something, to beg him to remember who he was, but nothing came to his lips. He felt as shell shocked as the man in his arms. Everything had gone to hell.
While they danced the servants must have been hard at work, because the dinner has been cleared away and flutes of champagne and a bowl of black cherries sits in the middle of the table. Or what Steve assumes to be black cherries.
Steve nodded. Truthfully, he wanted nothing more than to collapse. Whatever had happened, however he managed to heal Sam, the act drained him. He allowed Tony to grasp his hand and lead him out of the medical bay. As they slipped down the hallway, Natasha caught up with them.
“It sleeps sometimes after the scrub down and shave. Kind of stresses it out.” Rumlow stood next to Tony. His arms crossed over his chest, the weapon secured to his back and a grin on his face that spoke of pride and arrogance. “It’s in good health. We haven’t had to do level 3 punishment in a few weeks, though we keep up with the daily punishment as instructed.”
Steve spat up but managed to choke down another sip. His vision remained blurry. When he looked at Ross and Pierce watching him, their faces changed, malformed, and transformed into wicked parodies. They weren’t vampires or monsters, but beautiful men – men who had it all and whose greed expanded to want more and more until they could never be satiated. Immortality and the ability to pursue more power shined like a halo around them – they were the darkest of angels. Godsent to change the world yet they only bent it to their needs.
With a touch to Steve’s lips and the lightest kiss, Tony left his mate’s side to go with Thor. He didn’t direct the older vampire. They just happened to end up at the wide expansive balcony that looked out on the wooded area behind the house. The balcony was sleek in design and bright white. It glimmered in purples and pinks with his ethereal vision at night.
Instead, he urged the bike faster down the runway. The gunner opened fire and the bullets sprayed over the bridge, shooting up concrete. He weaved through the fighter’s gunfire, plucked his shield into his hand, and aimed it toward the rotary engine. It went true to its target as he leapt from the bike and onto the top of the jet. Jerking the shield from the damaged engine, Steve tried to balance but the pilot flipped the jet to the side. He went airborne but used his shield as a pick ax and impaled the side of the jet. He hung on one armed. Then, with sheer force of will, he got both hands on the shield and threw his entire body upward into a roll, pulling the shield free as he did. He tossed the shield at the rear engines, hitting one and then the shield ricocheted off it and speared the other one. He ran, caught the shield, and flipped to the pavement below as the fighter came down hard on the bridge.
Steve picks up his hand and smiles as if he’s a lion again, trying to communicate. He remembers himself and adds, “Yes. I’d love to. I mean. Go with you. My?”
“I want you to be fine, but I don’t think you are. Not yet.” Steve tentatively cups a hand over his shoulder. Tony tenses, but doesn’t pull away. “You don’t have to face this alone.”
Tony replies in the softest tones. “Yeah, welcome to the digital world.” Tony braces his hand against Steve’s back. The sandpaper feel dissipates and Steve leans into the touch needing the anchor. “Not exactly the internet though, more like Ultron’s twisted brain.”
“I guess you were never a myth, huh?” Tony whispers and then his stomach growls. He doesn’t remember the last time he ate anything substantial. Glancing at the dead deer, he grimaces and moves slightly away from it.
Tony stares out at the stream, how the sunlight catches the ripples and turns them into fluid diamonds on the water. “When I was very little, I used to dream that you would become real. Well, my little toy lion would become real and save me. Then when I got older and read the comic books and other stories, I used to dream of Captain America coming to save me.”
“As I understand it, sir, the mating is consensual. I mentioned that before.” He could play this game, though he was never one for subtlety.  “I don’t make judgements based preferences in that area.”
“What is fealty without some measure of love?” Tony says and puts the glasses away. “It doesn’t matter now. I screwed up, like I always do when it comes to these things. Maybe I don’t deserve the chair.”
“But he prepaid, why would she double contract out then?” Now he’s pissed. He needs to get the root cause of it. “Sorry, Wanda, I gotta go. I’ll talk later, okay?”
Tony frowns. He hates it when Jarvis decides he needs to eat healthy. He doesn’t want to eat healthy. He wants to eat cheeseburgers. Tony feels for his fork and pokes at the salad. Salad is always difficult to eat as a blind person, trying to stab at the veggies in the bowl treats him to a new level of frustration. He starts at 6 o’clock and works his way from there.
Something tingles deep inside Steve and when he gives Tony a sidelong glance, he sees the same hunger etched on his face as well. Steve is well and truly fucked. Luke leads them into the room and Tony steps through with Steve at his side.
“Should we call in Bruce?” Natasha asked as she went over some of the supplies Hill delivered to them and then excused herself.
Tony stops picking at the threads of the couch. “Yes. If the cube contains space – JARVIS are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
Steve stands up, his legs wobble a bit. Steadying his breathing, he looks Obie straight in the eyes and says, “Why don’t you ask the Agent what he wanted me to do for him?”
Opening his eyes, he turned to look at the center of the fire – its heart and soul. He blinked, and an image formed. His hopes dwindled as he recognized Natasha bent over him. “Hey, you’ve been out for a while.” She reached over and felt his forehead as if he had a fever.
Sam tugs at his shoulder and then marches forward toward their destination. The forest isn’t much of a forest and more of a wooded area close to the foothills and the rocky formations near where the conclave of the Skull sits according to the readout on Sam’s scanner. The snow on the ground thickens. They lose the clear sky as they continue forward. Bucky assumes they haven’t been detected and that Clint’s little maneuver in the sky as they dropped out of the ship covered their descent. Clint’s fast and able to throw cover fairly well.  Though Bucky knows better than to go too far with his assumptions.
Bruce growled and everyone stopped. He chuckled. “That actually worked. I can’t believe it worked.”  He cleared his throat. “Let the man sleep. Go outside and fight. Not here.”
Tony slides his hand behind Steve’s head and plays with the hair at the nape of his neck. “Don’t be afraid. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”
Tony pounds on the keys but not with violence but with purpose. Every note perfection as he glides up and down the keyboard. He chases the resolution of the music like he searches for an end of a war without end. He hurtles through the measures of the music, possessed by it but also, commanding it. His cock firm and throbbing in Steve’s mouth, so hot and hard that Steve can’t stop himself from bobbing and swallowing every now and again. The music reaches a fevered pitch, the notes tumbling off one another like thunder following in lightning’s wake. There’s no stopping it and then, and then…
Steve only frowns and shakes his head. “Simple herbs that’s all.” He finishes up and with the oven heating, places the chicken into the oven to cook. He cleans up and washes his hands. “I’ll start the hot chocolate now. Maybe you can get to work on those sandwiches.”
“These are the nanites.” She offers them to him, and he thanks her, placing the purse on the side table. “Instructions are included, I think. Otherwise just ask JARVIS.”
It had been coming. They both knew it would eventually. Living a dual life threatened them at all times. Steve refused to keep his mouth shut about the V-Corps and vampires’ rights, while Tony scurried about and followed the rules of living as a vampire after the Treaty.
Steve jostles the man but Rumlow easily overpowers him. Assessing the situation, Steve knows the odds too well. Back on Brooklyn, he lost count how many times Bucky bailed him out of a good alley fight.  He clenches his jaw but says, “Fine. But not here. Somewhere with less traffic.”  They are right in the thick of the service area.
“Me?” Steve gulps back his words. “What? The prince? Me?” He’s only been a prostitute for a month – well a little over two months. “Surely, there’s someone more experienced.”
“The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.” He battered the bag as he spoke each word and the memories of the last weeks slammed into him less like fond recollections and more like battering rams. “The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.” He didn’t want Natasha, or Bruce, or heaven forbid, Peggy to listen in on his scattered and slightly perverse thoughts.
“More Hydra cells in play? Maybe a power play?” Steve asked as Tony sidled up to him. Just being near Steve right now soothed the sting of his injury.
He should have just let the homophobic bastard go and not worry about what would happen. But the feedback loop ate at his brain and he didn’t want to deal with it alone. Being closer to Steve actually calmed the pinging reverberations. They went back to the crash site. And found nothing.
“If you believe that, why did you invite him here?” Steve says and he’s slowly running out of steam. He presses the heel of his hands into his eyes.
“No, I don’t,” Steve says. He knows she’s furious, everyone in the room can read her. He won’t lie, but he will be brutally honest with her. “No, I won’t leave Bucky, or the town. Right now, whoever did this, whether it’s Loki-.” Thor starts to protest but Steve raises his hand to stop him. “Whether it’s Loki, or Schmidt got his hands on some of this concoction, then the town and everyone,
Ross stands up and then places his hands spread out on the table, leaning over them. “I know that I can make you do anything I want to protect him. I know that your Alpha is in danger now that he’s trying to protect you.  The only way you, Omega, can protect him is to do as I say. Both of you are completely under my control.” He stands up but his gaze lingers. “My control. From now on.”
“That’s enough, now,” Ross said and stepped out of the shadows. Another V-Corps agent appeared at his side. Steve didn’t recognize the large soldier, but he knew the type all too well. The agent wrenched the woman off Steve and then pulled her aside. A long hunting knife was in his hand and he slashed her throat open, the blood she just drank spilled down her chest and onto the floor. Two men in white coats walked into the room pushing a gurney at the same time. The V-Corps agent tossed the dying vampire on the table and the two men in white checked her.
“Hmm,” Steve says as he crosses the room and studies the prince. “I’m not so sure about genius. Who here didn’t even know about popsicles.”
“No. It’s something that shouldn’t happen and how did that bastard figure out who you were?” Happy stomps forward as Steve follows along.
Steve walks over to the desk, the pile of drawings. “I should be apologizing. I’ve invaded your privacy. I’m sorry.” He gathers the papers and stacks them. “If you want me to, I’ll get rid of them. I’m not a creep or anything – I only wanted to-.”
Tony decided to take that for what it was worth. Stane was a murderous asshole but the fact was, he was a brilliant industrialist. He managed the company while Howard was off on his horror show experimental missions and while Tony pissed away his youth. Yes, he sold out to terrorists, but he helped manage the company as Tony developed the newest and greatest weapons the world had ever seen.
“There’s a massive hole in the code,” Bruce said. “And it looks like-.” He tapped a few more times. The display changed to another code spiraling over the rest of JARVIS’ code. “A new code is just eating away at all of the security protocols.”
The mishmash of words collides in Tony’s head. How does this have anything to do with Tony? He’s not sure he wants the responsibility of Captain America as a hooker in New York City.
He’d done this himself. With his inactivity, by hiding away. By allowing the crush of the dark cell to control him. He’d done this. “I did this. This is my fault.”
“Done what?” Tony said and the lab around him disintegrated, pixelating away. All he saw was Steve and the papers strewn around the table.
Before Tony responds a gust of wind outside fiercely rattles the windows. “Crap. Friday said the gusts could reach up to 80 miles per hour.” Tony heads toward the window to check the progress of the storm. Yesterday the snow was heavy, today it’s epic. Maybe it is the storm of the century. “How many feet do you think we have?”
Steve gritted his teeth. He wasn’t one for lying. In fact, Natasha said he was a notoriously bad liar. “I’ve sworn to do a duty.” Keeping it at that, he wouldn’t have to say if he agreed or not.
“Ma always did what she had to do to get us through the rough times. I figure I can do the same, you know?”
All the while Steve mentally self-flagellates, Tony buzzes around the room. He has the laptop computer set up on his nightstand with the glasses hooked up via USB port – apparently the arm turns into a connector. He’s explaining to them as he works, “The glasses will be upgraded but I’m hardwiring it for the upgrade because it will also backup the implant at the same time. Of course, the implant can only upgrade and backup through wireless.”
For one fleeting second, Steve’s clear minded and knows how to strike out and gamble in this game. “Please, touch me. Please, move. Please, sir.”
“You can barely stand. Get back on the gurney. Fury is here.” Natasha ordered as she ran to join Clint at the end of the corridor. With bow in hand, Clint and Natasha started forward, jumping over the carnage.
Steve glances around the room, but cannot find any sign of Tony’s manservant and he wonders when the man slipped out. He lowers his gaze again and his heart burns fire in his chest so much it feels like his breathing problems all over again. “You’re right,” Steve says and his own voice sounds so very far away. “Yes, you’re right. I came here for you. I came here for this, but now-.” He hates being a coward.
When Tony opens the door, he sees Steve standing by a messy bed. His face is flush and his eyes red. “I wanted to tell you something.”
Tony tossed a tube on the bed as well as a few face cloths. He reached out a hand across the small mattress. “Okay, can we - can I undress you?” He sounded as nervous as Steve felt.
But Steve forgot the eggs and everything else, the only thing his brain focused in on was the report out – something had happened. He cursed inwardly but remained stoic to his friend. “What is it you want to say, Thor?” That sounded more like a challenge than a friendly question. He attempted to calm his nerves, but he conceded it was a lost cause. “Sorry, tell me.”
“You’ll wake me up first,” Tony instructs and grimaces at Steve. “It might just be a nightmare or something.”
“You’re my mission.” The words sliced into Steve, not because of how it felt to be set adrift from his life and family, but because of what it meant about Bucky. Bucky was truly lost, gone, forever the hand of Hydra.
“For God’s sake man, no,” Steve says and the pit of his stomach turns over that his little display of offense misrepresented his intentions so wildly.
He escapes. Of course he does. Yinsen plays the piece and he's more bereft than ever. He has nothing to hang onto to ground him but the iron and steel and alloy that he builds. Pepper is there to steady him and Rhodes is there to support him. Neither know the real reason that the hole in his chest will never heal.
“What happened? Did someone attack him?” Her greenish blue eyes search his face and Sam lifts up the towel. “Son of a – who did this to him?”  And then she finds it. “What’s this?” She tugs the letter out of his hand. “Jesus, Sam, is this a suicide note?”
Everything went white even with his eyes closed. The breath in his lungs stopped, his muscles paralyzed. Excruciating pain – every nerve sang out in unbearable pain – so severe his tears scorched his eyes. He wanted to scream, to cry out, but no noise escaped his mouth. The white blinded him as the pain took over, until he was nothing more than a raw nerve.
He finally finds the root of the gland where it links to the blood vessels. Cutting it will be dangerous. He needs to cut far enough up to the vessels but not too far otherwise he’ll bleed too heavily even for him. He’s not worried about the nerve root to the brain, it shouldn’t be problem with the serum in his veins. But he needs to do it fast.
Steve hangs his head again and feels the weight of the phantom shield against his shoulders. Maybe it is the hope that someday things will change and right themselves. Maybe it is the fear that they won’t, or maybe, just maybe, he needs to free himself of the bonds of yesterday.
“A sweetheart,” Tony says and ambles down the last two steps. “That’s nice; she come with you out West?”
“It might be the universe, but it has to be dependent on you. It’s not random, not how I understand it.”
That jerks a smile on the edge of Tony’s mouth. Steve finds he likes that he’s able to elicit such a response. “You got that reference. I’m proud of you, Cap.”
“Well, yes I can. But it would be better if I made this a more personal affair. I need a date Steve and you’re it. Can you do this for me?” Tony asks.
“What kind of waves?” He hasn’t had a headache in over a century but he thinks he feels the ache of one now.
Tony liked Sam more and more each day. Mister Wizard frowned at Sam’s characterization and Tony loved it.
Tony had his braille keyboard out and stopped his work. “Yes. I think I told you early on that he stepped in and acted as a surrogate father.”
“Wanda, I didn’t know you were going to be here. I’m so glad to see you. It’s only been a few days, but I already miss everyone.”
Tony whined a little and then started a long slow weeping. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony. He wanted desperately to do something more for him, to reassure him, to support him. Within the core of his soul, he touched the embers that brought them together. He grasped the hot coals but found they did not burn, instead they warmed him, and he spread the warmth outward, feeling it expand from his chest, along the lines of his soul mark. The Beloved mark.
“None of this looks easy,” Steve says as he lounges back at his desk. The chair creaks its protest and he flips through the screens on the pad.
“Oh that’s a good trio,” Tony had said and he forced himself not to jump up and scream to the heavens that Steve wasn’t dead, that there still was hope.
Steve eases out of the notch in the rock he found safety in and touches his face. It stings but not as much as his shoulder.  He tries to rotate it, but he knows a separated joint when he has one.
Blu groans like he’s exasperated with Tony, stands up, and walks into the dark. While Tony worked the sun had dropped below the horizon and twilight descended. The tiny circle of light puddling out from the arc reactor affords him little to no security in this wilderness.”
“We’ll see,” Tony says and escapes. He needs to get to his penthouse, maybe get a drink.  HE doesn’t care how early it is in the morning. He walks to the elevator and JARVIS kindly helps him leave since the lift awaits him. Without a command, JARVIS sends the elevator to Tony’s floor. When he steps out of the lift, the light from the glare of the cityscape shines into the windows along the wall of the main room. It’s glorious and beautiful and Tony wants to appreciate it, but all he can think about is the fact that Steve appeared less than a month ago and Tony was standing right there, peering out onto the city thinking about leaving New York for good. But Steve stopped him, Steve asked him for a chance. “Maybe I did this to him.”
It crashed down on him; the fact that once again he was derelict in his duties as a pack leader. He’d left Clint, Natasha, Bruce, and Thor to deal with the new members. Again, he focused solely on his own needs – his Beloved. He wasn’t just a soul mate, but a pack leader and he’d screwed up again. The pack needed him. But then again, Tony fell apart in his arms. Was he simply supposed to leave him alone to deal with a mix of emotions? Was that the way he needed to act? Was part of being pack leader cutting himself off from his Beloved? Right now, he’d sliced away at the rest of the pack. He abandoned them again at their most vulnerable moments. It wasn’t right.
Blu responds by edging away from Tony and standing. He yawns and shakes his mane, looking at him with bleary eyes.
Tony sighs and nods his head several times. Relief loosens his shoulders and he says, “So, we can do this, can’t we? You said you love me, but do you, do you love me?”
“We’re going to make it through this,” Steve whispered and then bent in to kiss Tony.  The kiss electrified, tingling through his lips and sending pulses to awaken his nerve fibers and bring alive his senses.
“Clint!” Natasha said and justifiably quieted him. She studied them and then the rest of the room. They were all waiting for her verdict. Inwardly, Tony shuddered – from anticipation he told himself, not from fear of reprisal on her part.
“If you want to conduct business-.” Steve notches his thumbs in his gun belt. He concentrates on the far horizons, the foothills of the mountains, instead of meeting Tony’s inquiring look.
Steve lifted a shoulder in a shrug. “Yeah, why not? I have with Bruce on a rare occasion. Why wouldn’t I want to do it with you? I would love to find out how you design the Iron Man armor. What ticks in your head.”
Steve moves between Tony and Nat as if to block his view of the young woman. Steve whispers something to Nat, who can't be more than in twenty-two or twenty-three. She protests with a string of Russian but then he hears Steve say, "Is Clint home?"
Those last words, so perfect, so heartfelt, sent Tony soaring. He wanted to scream out and dance and announce it to the world, but he suppressed his very normal reaction and clenched his hands onto Steve’s shoulders. “You could never disappointment me. Never.”
The look on Tony’s face, the betrayal, the hatred, and hurt speared through Steve and took root at the same time. It wouldn’t let him go. It defined him in those moments and still does today. He hadn’t meant any of it. Bucky had never bonded to him. There was no truth to it. Why had he lied? Why did he obfuscate? He hadn’t meant to betray anyone. He never wanted to see the hurt on Tony’s face. But the escalation and the fear ended up motivating Steve.
Jarvis comes back with a tablet and hands it to Steve. The screen is frozen on a video that’s been posted to twitter. His face is plastered on the screenshot.
“Steve, you really need it. You look like Casper the Ghost,” Tony said and noted the wan color to the Captain’s skin. “You need to get some meat in you and I have to go a few more days with just pigs’ blood.” Some vampires in between feeding from their mates would visit Blood Dens or settle for animal blood. Tony had been drinking an excessive amount lately. Most of the time it was a sip here and there, but lately he’d been drinking his fill and then some. That wasn’t very healthy for Steve. He needed to be more considerate of his mate. With the serum, Steve healed and produced more blood quicker than normal humans, but Tony’s thirst had been insatiable lately. Thor had commented on it only a week ago.
Steve rested back on the cushions; his eyes widely dilated, his breathing fast but deep. “Yes, please. I want to see. I want to watch. Everything.”
“Surprised you mean.” Tony listens to the shift of the elevator. Almost there. There’s a slight change in speed as the elevator climbs to the living floors of the Tower.
After, Tony dawdles before he leaves, but Steve rests his head and closes his eyes waiting until he finally exits the spacious room. A few minutes of thought and he abandons the idea of trying to slip out of the hospital – or wherever he is. He’s not stupid; he has to admit that when Bucky asked him about the rest of his team – what will happen to them, he knew in his heart of hearts he would do anything to save them. He had. He rescued them from the undersea prison which was no mean feat. He owes them this much. He owes Clint and Scott a chance to see their children again. He owes Sharon a clear conscience. He owes T’Challa freedom from harboring criminals.
That’s when the weight, the mouth pressed up against his chest came into horrifying relief. A vampire – some vampire other than Tony – fed off of him, suckling at his chest. He was strung up again, his arms splayed out and his legs imprisoned constrained and tight together. His cock stood up straight as the vampire continued to feed and inject the hormone to cause the arousal. Steve willed his cock to stop, to go flaccid, but his brain couldn’t fight against biochemistry. He struggled in his bindings, pushing against the stranger sucking on his chest but he couldn’t get the leverage. The vampire pulled away then, and Steve flared his nostrils as he exhaled.
It got darker in the room. The lights never wavered, but the world around Tony funneled to a fine pinpoint. His father had many sides. In his younger years his father had been a brilliant playboy and an architect of the survival of the SSR. As he aged paranoia set in and he looked for ways to secure his legacy. Taking a younger wife and having Tony had been one way. Other ways included joining up with the Movement. This – this horror topped it all. What could this man and any of the others his father must have used in the secret facility possibly done to deserve any of this? And what could they possess to warrant continual experiments?
Rumlow licked his lips and quirked a brow. “Don’t see why it’s gotta see.” He pulled out a tool – one that looked similar to an Allen wrench. “O4 on your knees.” The Captain complied he crossed his arms behind his back as if waiting for someone to bind them.  Rumlow slipped the wrench into place as he spoke. “Normally it’s shackled when we do anything with its face restraints. This is just gonna freak it the hell out.”
“Both Natasha and Clint are part of SHIELD. So was Coulson. I trusted Coulson. He didn’t have some underhanded agenda. He wanted to do the right thing. So does Clint, and maybe so does Natasha.” Now it was Steve’s turn to judge. “An organization is only as good as its people. And I put my trust and faith in people.”
What does he have to get him through the nights? His mind falls back to Steve, the hooker. The man he thought he loved, the man playing a part who might just be Captain America but also some kind of clone. Tony doesn't know. He might never know. When the maniac with the metal arm came at him all those weeks ago, Tony's world shifted. It keeps doing that, shifting and changing and he fucking wants to get off this mad carnival ride. But the maniac beat him and Steve tried to stop it. He did. Along with Clint he stopped the beating but it didn't stop the fragmentation of everything that came before that moment. Steve didn't soothe and coddle Tony. Instead he picked a battered maniac off the floor and looked at Tony with blood shot eyes and tears on his face. He said, "It's best if you leave now."
The potency of the moment struck Tony, reminding him of hitting Mach 1 in the armor. He held tight and didn’t move for fear that he might startle or terrify Steve. “Lie to yourself?”
Slipping on his glasses, Tony adjusts them to active the surveillance program – a running data log flies by the lens showing him the perimeter and any threats. Without his security force, including his Master of the Fleet, Jamison, Tony needs to assess all possible assassination attempts himself. He doubts it will happen, especially since no one knows he’s here – none of his rivals. He planned it this way – or at least Pep did. It’s the best way to get in and out without the competition trying to off him.
“I think that Wanda thinks so, which is very strange and outside my limited old man range of understanding.” He indicates the soup. “Drink. We have to keep our strength up in his virtual world.”
“Just me, Steve, we have a problem. Bucky’s back and.” Natasha stops, and clears his throat as if it is difficult to say the next words. Without thought, Steve sits up and Tony rolls off to the other side of the bed. “Clint didn’t make it.”
“What’s on the agenda for today, Cap?” Going with the more formal moniker but with a casual flare might help thaw things between them as well.
Not knowing exactly what to say, Tony approaches with caution and calls, “I’m here to help. The bad guys are all gone.”
“Something like that. I mean, I can get some later during the night, but then that means I’m wasting time I can be up and doing things outside,” Tony said.
But Tony shakes his head, his eyes losing any focus. “In charge, you’re in charge. You- you tell me. You’re my-God! You’re my Captain!” His hips thrust but Steve captures his cock and squeezes it, stopping him from coming.
“No!” Steve said. He looked smaller still in the spotlight as the shadows turned to blood red. “No.” He hung his head and Tony heard the sniffle, the tears as they dropped to the floor like single pings in his heart. “I can’t ask you to sacrifice. I can’t do that to you. I’ve asked enough of you already. Enough of everyone.” Steve looked up at Tony, his face a ruin of emotions. “I’ll take him away. Work with him. Maybe someday we can come back. You don’t have to go through the memories if we clear the bond somehow.”
Tony’s about to break their perfect peace when his phone does it for him. A tiny chime and he knows that Friday is alerting him. While still on Steve’s lap he digs out his phone and answers. “How’s my girl?”
The doctor smiles. It’s kind and soft. “He’s safe. At this time, there’s no evidence of seizure or coma. He’s sleeping.”
“Who are you?” Steve says and coughs when he realizes how rasped his voice sounds. It isn’t from being sick, Steve knows but he hopes everyone else concludes it is.
“Should have known what?” Steve said, his voice far too fierce and unyielding. “What should you have known? Where the hell am I? What the hell happened?” He didn’t want her pity, and he didn’t want her sorrow. What he wanted was the truth. He wanted to run, but he energy hadn’t returned. “Where’s Tony?”
"You have to understand, Captain, the Southern sympathizers weren't only in the South," Tony says. "I only regret I wasn't able to provide the information to stop Lincoln's assassination."
“I know it,” Tony said. “I understand it. Mentally, I get it. But emotionally-.” He swallowed down his pain but knew that Steve could read it through the bond. “I just keep thinking about my mom. How he killed her. How did he do it? Did she know, did she look into the eyes of her killer? It looked like an accident – but when you go through the autopsy reports.” He stopped because he never confessed to reading them, to going through the encrypted data dump from SHIELD. It took no time at all to find it. “God, I know she did. He strangled her.”
“You don’t have to do that,” Tony said, his voice low. “Try and make me feel better about your living situation compared to mine. I know I was lucky, fortunate. I know others aren’t.” Tony stepped into the light. A mixture of emotions filtered over his face. Before Steve replied, Tony shifted the conversation. “This must be an illusion or something. I bet the rest of the team is sitting there watching and laughing their asses off at us.” He wrapped his arms around his chest. “This is not nice.”
“Yeah,” Steve said and shuddered. Even a hooker liked it once in a while – Tony told himself these lies all the time.
“You said he remembered your name, what it meant?” Bucky says and he’s surprisingly gentle with his words. He’s trying to pull it out of Steve, attempting to drag the truth and all the ugly memories out so that he can wash them away. Steve’s not ready to cleanse his soul, he’ll never forgive himself.
Steve breaks some of the small sticks for kindling and piles them in the hearth. “Well I’m glad you liked them.” He clears his throat as he lays the logs. “I think I have to talk to you Tony.”
It surprised Steve that Natasha grasped his hand, squeezing it. “You know you did everything you could. It’s hard to accept. I’ve had to accept a lot about my mate. The position I put Clint in, where his family was in danger, I’ll never forget myself. What happened is as much my fault as anyone’s.” Her hand cooled him. He focused on it, the porcelain beauty of her touch. “Whatever I can do, I will. I know you don’t want to believe me now.”
Now he was just dopey with it. Tony rolled his eyes. “Stop being adorable.” Tony jumped out of bed, pulled on a bathrobe – his father’s old one – and headed to the door.
The lab itself is huge, probably more than half of the floor. Equipment and computers form a maze. Steve has no idea how Tony remembers were everything is or how he gets around. It’s confusing and exhilarating. Standing in the center of it, Tony holds up his hands seemingly tapping the air. Steve peers closer, not sure what he’s witnessing then he understands – partially.
“If only,” Tony says. “I wish you had. But the truth is – we can do the experiments to test it out, but all evidence points to it. You are not going crazy, Steve. I saw it too. My other self in that other reality must have somehow survived the tentacles or whatever the hell it was stabbing me or him.” God it got so damned confusing. “So, we know it’s not a fantasy or a delusion. Unless that stuff is contagious.”
“For a few weeks,” Steve said and put his hands up as if he was surrendering to Tony. He sent calming waves to Tony through the bond, trying to reason with him. “I knew for a few weeks. That’s all. I came to you as soon as Sam and I verified-.”
He should have died. But the nanites protected him from the worst of the gamma radiation. Tony wasn’t stupid. He created nanites to answer to his every whim, why wouldn’t he ensure protection against radiation. The gauntlet Bruce used to bring back the vanished had protection as well – even the Hulk needed protection. Bruce suffered. Tony suffered. Time would heal all wounds he told himself on the battlefield as he snapped his fingers.
They exited the building and headed toward the nearest metro. Steve glanced at Clint. “You have any luggage?”
Then he realizes how fucking hot he is. How long has he laid in the suit? How long has he been out of it? If he’s lying out in the sand he’ll cook in the suit, especially since the inner climate control is shot. Gritting his teeth, Tony swings his aching arm across his chest and slams the release. For a second, he thinks it’s broken but then the armor plates grind and wheeze like an old man trying to ride a bike. It opens. Tony forces himself to get out of the armor and onto the rocky surface. He drops to the ground and squints his eyes.
“I was thinking about getting rid of that ass once and for all,” Steve says through clenched teeth. As sheriff he has a duty to perform, getting rid of the garden variety of criminals is one thing, trying to rid the town of the likes of Schmidt is on another level of impossible.
“He’s a firecracker,” Luke comments and then they are off to figure out nightwear for Steve. He shows Steve different lingerie but then adds, “The Prince usually doesn’t end up asking his Escort to stay the night. Sometimes he asks them to leave and come back bright and early. Other times he asks them to never come back. But just in case, you should have a night robe and slippers.”
Pietro rushes into the room. “Vision said that Pepper activated the party protocol. That means that there will be a medical evac helicopter here in a little less than an hour. Doctor Strange is in route to meet us at the airport and then fly to New York.”
Both remain quiet as they climb back to the beach, as Steve comprehends the profundity of what he nearly did to Tony in his moments of weakness. He should leave so that Tony will be safe not only from the evil inevitably invading from the Boundaries but also from Steve. Because anytime, Steve glances at Tony he cannot deny the flush of warmth under his skin or the rapidity of his heart. His brain fuzzes and dims when he thinks of Tony touching him, of touching Tony.
“I’m sorry, but what are you looking for?” One prim lady asks as he sorts through the clothes on the rack.
“I will, will I?” Steve asks as he climbs to his feet. He still has the cuff for the shield Tony made him.
Tony stands up and, for a second, Steve thinks he’s getting out of the tub, but instead he pulls off his wet uniform. All of it, revealing his scarred chest and the augmentation implant over his heart. He tosses the wet clothes in a pile on the floor and then sinks back into the warm water. Steve reclines in the tub and pulls Tony to sit against him. At first, Tony hesitates but then Steve wraps his legs around the prince’s waist and his arms around his torso.
“Why don’t I leave you for a few minutes so you can get ready? Prince Anthony will want to meet you as soon as possible.”
“I was in the Army, Tony. I know how to handle myself,” Steve says. “How about some hot chocolate and cookies.”
Steve pushes up, trying to at least get a view of where they are. Tony tries his best to stop him, but he fails. Instead he adjusts Steve into a semi-reclined position. “Where?” His words are breathy, hardly whispered.
“Good.” The leader snaps his fingers and the soldiers walk to the door, waiting for him. Then the leader says in a low voice. “Good.”
“No, I don’t. But I need to,” Clint said. He reached over to a cowbell hung on the wall. “Foods up.” He rang the bell, and everyone gathered around the huge dining room table again.
“I might, in a way, but not in the way you think. I still think that some modified type of Accords is needed, but I do think the approach was all wrong,” Natasha says and then she scans him. “You need to go. I could help you.”
When Tony turns back to Clint his head is bowed and he’s not even looking at Tony. He remembers then that he shouldn’t turn away from him. “Sorry, sorry, I-.”
“Tony’s doing better, if that’s what you’re worried about. He’d like for you to stop by,” Bruce says.
Steve cupped his big, strong hand along Tony’s jaw. “Sweetheart, I can’t. I gotta go back to work.” His eyes searched Tony’s bleak complexion. “Next time. I’ll come back tomorrow night and you can drink all you want. I have the weekend off.”
The news of Captain America’s miraculous survival of the 1945 crash of the Valkyrie dominates the news cycle for a good 48 hours. SHIELD paints it as if Steve Rogers was preserved in ice for 70 years and the super soldier serum saved him. There is no mention of a lion. There is no mention of Blu at all. He has been erased from memory.
“I need your opinion about Steve. I think- I think he left for some reason and I can’t figure out why,” Tony says.
Tony might have swallowed his tongue. Captain America just used the word cozy. Has he stepped into an alternative reality? “Are you okay?” He gulps back the words – he hadn’t meant to say them out loud.
“I should do a lot, but right now I’m going to finish my project. Are you coming to do your job or are you going to mother hen me to death?” Tony raises an eyebrow at him.
He needs a moment to rectify his thoughts with reality. The idea of a professional just brings up old fashioned thoughts of prostitution. Clearing his head would help. “Can I get a moment?”
Steve points to his implant. “Steve Rogers. Residential status – whore.” He nearly chokes on the last word but manages to get it out.
“You don’t have to-.” The flush of his cheeks and his general position in Tony’s arms telegraphs his feelings.
“Good to know,” Tony said. He really only wanted to get this over with. He needed to know if he could humanely release the creature or if he needed to put it down. How? He didn’t know. His hands shook as he put on his glasses. “How about we get the show on the road?”
“Okay, okay,” Sam said and stood up. “Let’s remember we’re all kind of in this together. We might not be a cohesive pack, but we each have to come together to get this job done. Steve means something -,” he stopped and glanced at the brother and sister, “or will mean something to each of us. If Mister Wizard here is telling the truth, we each hold a piece of Steve’s soul.”
“Get to give me all the foul tasting medicines,” Bucky says with a roll to his eyes. “Getting back at me.” He doesn’t protest further as he finishes up the liquid drug and Steve eases him down onto the pillow.
“Okay. It’s always good to prep yourself before a client. Usually, you have at least an hour before the client arrives. Sometimes they only want a blow job, but it’s always good to be prepared.” She hands him the dildo. “You’ll need this one this time. Most of the time you should try and prep with a size smaller than needed just to make sure you’re tight enough but open enough so that it’s comfortable. You’re sure you can you handle this size?”
Steve doesn’t mention that Ultron probably already knows. He accepts Tony’s explanation and tugs on the cable. It’s strong and will hold for the climb. It’s not a steep rise, but the wind works against them, so they need the rope as a guide if not for anything else.  He grapples to get Tony leashed to him. They mutually and silently decide it’s for the best if they each climb up individually. Tony goes first, using the rope to hoist himself up the slippery surface. Steve spots him, ensuring there’s no accident. His eyes have adjusted to the weirdness – the perfect perspective, the finite details. His brain still scrambles to make sense of it, but he can ram through the nausea. He did it enough as a young man.
The implication had been explicit and clear. Even now as the ship battles the raging winds of the planet's atmosphere Bucky doesn't know if he could do the ultimate. If he could kill Steve to save the rest of the galaxy and put order to the Force.
Startled out of his intense study of lacrosse, Steve looks up to an older man with a thick white beard and a gold eye patch. He shakes his head. “I’m not sure I understand it. I don’t really follow lacrosse.”
They hadn’t. Not really. Not since the whole horrible mess occurred and both Tony and Steve needed time to reset and recuperate. Tony admitted; it wasn’t easy. Steve left often to go to the safe house where Barnes and the twins stayed. He went there to help them acclimate, to work with Hill and Fury on their integration into the team, and to be counseled by Thor as to how to guide the team. Thor often stayed at the safe house. Nat split her time between the Tower and the safe house. The only constants in the Tower were Sam, Bruce, Tony, and Steve.
Even as he jogs out of the lounge and into the main bay area, Steve cannot help but feel as if he’s let Bucky down. He frowns and slows down. He doesn’t want to seem over anxious. For some reason as he approaches bay thirty two, he wishes he had his shield. His back feels open, vulnerable, and naked as he rounds the corner into the massive bay of the luxury liner.  He gasps as he lays eyes on the Stark Corp ship. It’s a beauty as well as huge, and he can only see a portion of it, since part of the liner is outside the Station.
Tony smiled. It reminded him of electron orbitals around a nucleus – different orbitals from the s to p to d had different shapes, different attractions. “Do you want to know which cluster is which?”
His face colors, and he’s about to disavow any knowledge of what she might be referring to, but she stops him in his tracks. “No one knows he’s here. He arranged it earlier while you were out wrestling von Doom to send the telegraph. He came in through the back and the girls set him up. Go. I have Skye off the roster tonight; she’s officially seeing you.”
“Ah, Natasha,” Tony says. He knew that Pepper plucked this guy off the street for a reason. Natasha and Pepper were thick as thieves sometimes. “So, you want to use Natasha as your reference?” Tony flips through the papers and sees that in fact, Steve has not listed her as a reference. He has a Colonel, a doctor, and his friend Sam Wilson.  “Did you work for any of these people other than the Colonel?”
Except for Pierce. Now a general of the First Order, and answering to the mysterious Sith Lord, the Red Skull. The Sith who abducted Steve seventeen months ago and imprisoned him.
“Suspect isn’t the right word. I think he wants to test me,” Steve said and then started to sit up, jostling Tony. “With me being so vocal as an opponent to a lot of the V-Corps policies and the new administrations orders, he wants to find out where my sympathies lie.” Steve kissed the crown of Tony’s head and then slipped out of bed, pulling up his pants. “Damn, I need to wash up a little.” Blood stains and come plastered his chest.
The kind woman whispers to another in the darkness and the Silver Knight’s gaze drifts over to the corner of the small cottage. It’s a humble place with nooks hiding small glass jars with dried herbs and roots. There are dried cuttings from flowers and the like hanging from string crisscrossing the rafters. His small cot isn’t the only one crammed into the one room cottage. There are several others lining the walls. On the wall closest to the door, he spots a basin and next to it a cutting board to prepare foods. Over behind him he feels the warmth of a hearth. The place is warm and lovely and not something he would think a demon would find solace in – but it is a place of demons.
Something howled in the background like a lost dog begging for help. “God damn.” It hit him. “Who did the experiments? Who does the experiments.”
“I can get them off,” Tony said and picked up the chains that linked to Steve’s wrists. He focused his thoughts and the energy streamed from his chest where the iron rod had once skewered him. Like molten steel it ran along his arms and the chains melted away in his hands. Clint whistled but stationed himself near the door to guard them as Tony shifted to Steve’s ankles. He followed the same routine and the chains fell away from Steve’s ankles.
Steve squinted at her and Tony chuckled. “Don’t worry, Steve. It just means we’re not evil undead in the end anyhow.” Tony considered Shuri. “It’s interesting that you accept that I left my body and then came back to it.”
He stays until dawn somedays. He watches as the sun bleeds in through the curtains of the arched window in Tony’s private room. And then it is the day, the moment of truth. They slowly bring him out of the induced coma. The doctors are standing around like it’s a freak show and Steve wants them gone. He wants to sit with Tony and watch him wake, like he always does. He wants to be that security that Tony needs when he opens his eyes and needs to orient. But he doesn’t have the luxury.
Tony seems sufficiently cowed by her comment and quietly excuses himself as the woman settles next to Steve on the bed. She reaches out with her gnarled hand and brushes over the stretch of his one wing.
"Bucky, come on, now, it's Steve," he says and tries his best to be soothing but the wound is ugly, horrifying and Steve tries everything to hold back the bile and his dinner. Bucky pants and huffs in harsh exhalations through his nostrils. There's drool and blood dripping out of his mouth, staining the rag he’s biting between his teeth, again.
“Understood.” The last thing he wants is for Natasha to lose her license with the Guild. That would not do. She runs the best Brothel on Prime Station – other places are like chattel. Natasha respects all her workers because she thinks of them as workers and employees not indentured servants or worse.
Once inside the laundry room, by mutual unspoken consent they strip down to their undershorts and leave their outerwear to dry on the hooks near the door. Tony brings the shield inside and perches it against the side of the kitchen cabinets. Without a word, he grasps Steve’s hand and leads him upstairs. Surprisingly he’s pliant and doesn’t resist. At the door to Steve’s room, Tony stops.
“Maybe it is not. I always used it a compass. What would I do not to be within the rings of Hell. I don’t particularly believe in Hell. It is not my tradition, you see. But one must have a moral compass.”
Steve smiled. Of course, he did. Tony thought of everything. Now, he needed to make an escape without JARVIS ratting him out. He ended up getting ready as quietly as he could and managed not to wake Tony. He left the apartment in civil clothes and without his shield. It was a choice, but he made it and he would need to live with it. As he stood outside the Tower, he called Sam.
“Doing good. Kick it into high gear.” Tony wants to feel the speed, see the blur of the landscape as the colors bleed together.  “Just remember there’s not a lot of paved road here.”
“I don’t think you need to worry about the scars,” Steve said even as he rubbed the side of his neck. Maybe the bruises were still there. Maybe his body just hadn’t healed anything after they’d taken so much of his blood. Maybe that was the change seeded deep inside of him. Maybe what happened deprived him of his life with the serum.
His hands are on both sides of Tony’s face, as if the scars and horrible mutilating burns mean nothing. Don’t bother him at all. Steve stares into his eyes, and then his gaze drops for only a second to go back to his eyes. He moves in closer and their mouths brush, touching, seeking. A test of a promise. Tony whines a little into the kiss, but he grasps at Steve and hugs him. Their lips crush into one another and Tony wants to crawl into this man, wants to fit into him and be with him forever. This man crossed the stars for him.
She continued weaving her way through the hallways of the Triskelion and raised an eyebrow as she cast a glance at him. “Like I said, this just made my job much easier.”
Leaning over, Tony closes the strap to the breastplate of the leathers and covers the gland. “I noticed that your gland does not scar. Are you modified? It didn’t say in your file.” Many omegas are modified with enhancers to be fit for battle. Healing enhancers is one of them.
Bruce is the one with the temper, but he doesn’t seem to entertain clients anymore so Steve figures that’s the reason why Natasha was willing to bring Steve onto her sex worker list. He holds meditation sessions on their day off (they all get the same day once a week). Everyone shuffles off to the observation deck for an hour of quiet time. Bruce leads it and it’s nice but Steve doesn’t really get it. He just sits there and stares at the nebula, engrossed in the colors and the beauty.
“Shut up.” He knows it’s not polite and he should at least feel some sympathy for the guy but he feels shitty and he doesn’t think he has the strength to pull it together and be buddies with the guy who’s going to steal Steve away from him.
Steve agrees and then says, “I’ll be here. Waiting.” Inwardly he cringes. That was not smooth at all. Bucky would laugh at him. The prince only smiles and then turns back to his work. He leaves Steve alone to his side of the vast room to watch the stream of different shows.
“Ah!” Steve finishes the pancakes and the bacon, setting the plates. “Technically I didn’t bring it. I shipped it via the US Postal System.”
Instead of getting testy about it though, Tony just grins. “Child it is.” He sprays more of the whip topping into his mouth. “Your loss.” Most of the topping spills out of his mouth as he speaks. He laughs and then wipes his mouth with the cloth napkin. Steve never had cloth napkins when he was growing up.
“Is it so unbelievable that the existence of soul bonds and soul packs has eluded the human consciousness and knowledge? Magic, what I do, is not accepted by Western civilizations. I didn’t accept it when I first encountered it.  You’ve heard the word soulmate but just shrugged it off as a fairy tale. Not so. The timeline changed and with it, the reality of what soulmates are. They are real.”
“Loading dock, damn it,” Tony says as he maneuvers the SUV to the exit. “Pepper’s going to have my head.” He checks on the time on the dashboard clock, curses and follows the wave through by the attendant.
Steve shakes his head. “Nope. I think they call it some kind of amnesia, I don’t know. Traumatic? I don’t recall.” He gives a little laugh. “But you know, no reason not to like the snow.”
“As a soul pack you are all sorely inept,” Strange replied and then grunted. “We will show you. Don’t worry about it.”
“Do I now?” Natasha hasn’t lowered the gun. She walks over to him and points the gun right at his temple. “You need to start remembering who I am, Rogers.”
Tony pats his chest. “Red and gold have always looked best on me.” He preens. Tony’s uniform has more gold threaded through it. The panels on the legs are gold as are the panels on the lower arms, almost mimicking gauntlets. A strip of fabric covers his palms and laces around to the back of his hand. Instead of a star on his chest there is a blue symbol that Steve doesn’t recognize.
So Tony laid it on the line. “Brother? He’s part of the pack? What the hell?” It pieced together now; the constant undercurrent of dissonance. One song amongst all the rest continued to be off chord, a mix of straining broken harmonies. “He’s the one in the background, right? The one that’s constantly throwing headaches my way?”
Opening the door to the hospital room, Tony steps inside and nods to the nurse. She gives Tony a smile and returns to her work on the computer. Her patient is quiet, unmoving in the bed. It’s been days since the seizure. News outlets have been badgering them for an update on Captain America. Pepper’s been fielding all of the calls, which is all kinds of wrong. It should be Fury or Hill or someone from SHIELD. Somehow or another a spy organization is not good at dealing with the paparazzi. Pepper is, she’s a genius. He’s grateful to her. How she spins no change into anything other than no hope, Tony can’t guess.
“Well, I might have puked a little last time I wore the biohazard suit. But I cleaned it up, or Vision did. He used bleach and something, I don’t know,” Tony says and taps over to help Steve latch the helmet to the suit.
Steve shrugs. “I need a job. My friend Natasha Romanoff used to work here. She said you needed what she called a Personal Assistant.”
“I don’t actively live here, Thor,” Steve says and drops his hands. His life swirls around like a maelstrom. He’s either in love with his boss or he’s not. He’s got to get his head on straight.
Steve stares at the screen as it goes black. He doesn’t lift his gaze. The power of their eyes on him, everyone around the table, hurts like a physical pain right under his sternum. He fights silently for air and prays that he’s not about to go into an asthma attack. He shouldn’t,  considering it’s triggered by chemicals, but damned if this isn’t a full out assault on him.
Steve steps to the map – the wooziness of the dream sequence coils in his gut. He nods. He knows this as if he lived it. “The marauders won’t be a problem. It’s the Ornari we have to worry about.”
“Is that why you were nearly passed out at dinner?” Tony asked. The fog of that night remained thick and unsettling for Tony.
“You will if you ever want to see your dear Iron Man again,” Loki smirks. His eyebrows arch. “Tell me dear Captain, does he know what sits so deeply in your heart?”
Steve ignores the endearment -which Tony’s grateful for since it slipped out. “Well, no need to worry. I brought my shield. We can go sledding on that.” He beams.
Tony almost laughed at his words; Steve saw the flittering possibilities of sarcastic comebacks tickle his tongue and he had played with it, but good sense stopped him. He slumped down on the bed. “I thought that if we gave it a try, I’d remember, I’d remember more.”
“You got all that as you implanted a worm?” Steve shakes his head. “That sounds suspiciously like the Red Skull’s hideaway. I think you must have read that from my mind, not his brain.”
“Bucky.” Another voice says and then a shadow hovers over them. A small yet strong hand on Bucky’s bare shoulder appears. “Bucky.”
His mind flashes back to Siberia and Tony throwing his arms into the air to protect his face. The idea, the concept that Tony believed that Steve would even conceive of slamming the shield into his alpha’s face is so foreign, so alien to him that it still to this day turns him cold. He never wanted to see despair, to hear anguish in Tony’s voice. He is an omega, after all. He serves to protect. He protected Tony from the truth. Or he thought he did.
He stared down at the floor running over what she’d said. Remembering that moment in the shower when he’d felt like he wanted to surrender to an urge he never even contemplated before. Not truly. How wonderful it felt and yet how empty when he realized he was alone and the perversion of what he’d envisioned dissipated into the steam of the shower.
“Tony -- tried --- tried to re-establish the bond,” Steve says and his head aches and the words are like mud in his mouth. He’s getting weaker now; he’s been lucky that fate or whatever has allowed him to speak and interact. He doesn’t know if he can build up enough strength (or is it courage) to continue.
As he lays Tony down on the soft linens and, for one moment, stops only to gaze upon the joy and desire he finds there, Steve searches within himself to see if he could possibly let go, to see if he could walk away. He’s doomed, because he cannot. Tony’s gaze flickers to Steve’s eyes, there’s a critical worry there. He reaches out and up to Steve, but before Tony can cup his face, Steve captures his hand. Brings the fingertips to his lips and slowly kisses each one. He’s never done this before, he doesn’t know things, but he follows his own desires, his own yearnings. He knows he wants to touch all of Tony, that he wants to taste all of him, that he longs to feel him side by side. He knows that there were times in his captivity that he dreamed of Tony as heaven itself.
Once he’s finished, he decides to go and visit Bucky, but just as he turns the doctor descends the stairs. He’s wiping his hands on a rag and says, “He’s sleeping but the wound doesn’t look good. I’m concerned that what the big fella-.”
Tony was banking on Steve being frightened or doubtful of SHIELD. Yet, Steve had always been doubtful and questioning of anyone he’d ever worked for even the grocery down at the end of the block when he was in his teenage years. His mother would roll her eyes and sigh dramatically when Steve would come home raging about prices and fighting for a single penny in change. Steve came back to the moment. “It is important, but I am not sure it will work out like you think it will.”
“You don’t,” Steve starts and then stops. He inhales and exhales. “Hmm, you didn’t seem blind when-.”
Too many input points barraged Steve – he had a newly bonded pack member without counsel as well as an assassin roaming DC, but Steve also needed to face the new truths of what had happened moments after arriving at the hospital.
He accepted the invitation. Words jumbled in his head. It had been weeks since he actually put together a conversation worthy of more than a few sentences. He’d kept to himself.  He asked for privacy and they gave it to him without any qualms or pressure. So, his words were dry dust in his mouth. “I don’t know what to say.”
Tony chanced to reach over and put his hand on Steve’s that was sitting between them on top of the book. “Are you going to live your life now?”
The touch sang through his core, through his soul. It sang and told him acceptance. The soul pack it welcomed Tony, but he wondered if Steve would welcome him. Opening his eyes, he gazed down at Steve. He recalled their hissed words, their awkward dinner, their cross purposes at every turn. They were hardly even friends how could they possibly be something more? How could Beloved be their link. Bruce had told him to look at it scientifically and his brain went to equations and frequencies. When Tony measured how he could possibly bond with Steve, the equation became a quandary, an unsolvable question. But to the universe – Tony was Steve constant, and Steve was Tony’s constant. Universal constants linked together through some metaphysical soul.
Tony shakes his head and looks out the large glass doors to where the ocean gently hits the shore over and again. “Don’t say things like that. It’ll only get you in trouble.”
Barnes scrapes a chair across the floor and plants it right next to Tony, close enough that their knees are only centimeters apart. “When he was a kid, nobody thought he would live. People were prejudice as shit around him. Don’t know how it got out, but it always did. Couldn’t walk down the street without people throwing trash at him. Probably one of the reasons he started to stand up for the little guy, even though he wasn’t much he always did.”
“We know where the cell is finally.” Fury eyed each one of them. “And we’re pretty sure the Hydra cell there has Loki’s scepter. We’ve been tracking it down and finally stumbled across some rumors that led us back around to the twins and then to Sokovia.”
“What’s the story?” Steve asks and is keenly aware that Tony’s watching his every move. Instead of allowing it to affect him, Steve only ushers his Deputy and friend to sit and discuss the issue.
Finally, he comes back to himself, and knows he has to face facts. He’s healing and his mission is to find out what happened to the Realms. If he truly wants to keep Tony safe, then he has to consider that the Boundaries are shut and the world is in danger. He swims back until he can stand and he spots Tony on the beach, watching him. Spreading his wings to catch the sun, he smiles at Tony and his heart aches. How badly he wants Tony isn’t in doubt, how he cannot have him – is painful, how he can resolve the issue is the one thing in jeopardy. If not for Tony today, Steve would have doomed them both, and that is very out of character.
Steve pushes away the memories and tries to center his concentration on Tony. He discovers that if he keeps his visual reference to things in close proximity the world spinning around him settles and quiets. Hopefully, he’ll adapt soon, otherwise the situation transforms into a strategic nightmare. The reasons he convinced the team it should be him alongside Tony highlighted his strategic skills. Being blind, deaf, and nauseous leads to a huge handicap.
Tony nodded, not trusting his voice. Losing Steve wasn’t in the realm of possibilities. He chewed on his lip as Natasha and Sam made final plans and Wong moved Strange away from them to discuss the next steps. That left only Bruce and Bucky hanging with Tony.
Steve’s glance shoots up and he reads the hardened look on Fury’s face as not an expression of resentment but of reserve, consideration. He’s waiting, testing, and seeing if Steve can earn his wings as a Guardian.
He had JARVIS call up information on Beloved and soul packs. Still a paltry amount and most of it was hearsay and rumor.  As he worked, instead of having the loud and wonderful music of Zeppelin playing in the background, JARVIS narrated the information on Beloved.
It’s only a few feet to his room, but his feet drag, and he wishes he said something, anything that’s real. Steve always tries to live by the truth, but now he’s hiding something. Yet it doesn’t feel like he should confess. What is there to confess? He’s hot for his boss? He shakes his head as he locks the door to his room and goes to undress. Before he even gets his shirt off his phone chimes. Picking it up, he notes the caller. With a huge sigh, he answers the phone.
“What?” Tony rushes to him and hugs him. “No. I’m not going to leave you here. I’ll find a way. Don’t worry. I’m not going to leave you all alone.”
Over the next hour, Tony chases Blu around their camp, across the stream, and through a gentler slope of the hills. He increases the intensity of the beam and Blu encourages him, loving the crash and explosions that occur when he angles his ‘shield’ just the right way. By the end, they are both spent and Tony’s hurting. He lies down in the field and grips his ribs. His breathing tightens in his chest. His decreased lung capacity isn’t helping matters any. Blu stares at him, studying him and then nudges him with his snout.
“You don’t have to apologize,” Steve replied. He wanted to say – you did nothing wrong. But it seemed trite and stupid when he thought about it. He held onto Tony, and they stayed curled around one another for what seemed like forever. Steve needed Tony’s heat, the power within him. It supported Steve. His tears finally dried, or maybe he had no more left. When he tugged away, Steve noticed that Tony’s chest burned brighter still. He fingered the patch of light. It dimmed, and Tony smiled at Steve.
“No bother,” Tony says and hops to his feet. He hauls Steve up as well. “Good thing we were interrupted, I still want to feed you dessert.”
Natasha thinks the whole thing is hilarious. Sam and Bucky tease him constantly about it. He doesn’t mind their ragging on him about it, at least it takes his mind off of the phantom touch of Tony, the caress of his well worked hands across his face, cupping his jaw as if he might lean over and brush his lips against Steve’s mouth. He shouldn’t be having these thoughts about his boss.  He manages to keep his cool about it, not act too jittery in front of Tony, but his job requires that he allow Tony to touch him. Every time his heart leaps in his chest and Steve swears Tony hears it. He always has to gulp down his excitement.
The rain splatters and hits with an icy chill. It mixes between rain and snow. It isn’t an everyday affair to have a rain snow mix this close to the Rocky’s. The air is usually so dry that on the cold days they just get snow. But today is one of those rarified autumn days teasing winter weather.  The rain pelts and, like daggers, it spears against their skin. Steve keeps his hat pulled down over his eyes, but Tony’s wearing a smaller hat, a fedora, without a wide brim. His face is marked with the frigid rains.
“Do you worry that the universe decided for you?” Tony asked, and he hated to ask it because it revealed his own fears.
“Oh he didn’t tell you?” Ultron created Steve smiles. It’s hideously beautiful. “There’s a recording, a tape of it. Would you like to know? Would you like to experience your mother and father’s last moments?”
“Lucky me,” Steve mutters as they take the gantry and are back at the safety of the ship. Instantly, the bravado of the past half hour dissipates. He wavers on his feet, but the prince is there to catch him.
Now isn’t the time to come apart at the seams because of the past. He needs to do the right thing for the future. It might seem like he’s giving up, but he hardly thinks freedom is surrendering. At this point, Tony would never forgive everything that’s happened. He never reached out after Steve sent that first letter. Only silence and that silence spoke volumes. As Steve had gone through a heat, he knew that Tony would have at least gone through an urgency. And still no word. This is the best route to freedom for both of them.  Plus, when Bucky awakes from his slumber, the Wakandan scientists will be ready to help him. They are working not only removing Hydra’s brainwashing but also on his urgency issue. They think they might be able to turn him back into a beta. Which is good. Everyone will be free again.
. “Speaking of which with the young artists. Do we have any that we are supporting that will be attending?” God, he wishes they were supporting Steve as an artist.
The omega slams a fist against the translucent divide and then snarls, “I devoted my life to him. I bonded to him. I never left his side. I protected his children. I followed his orders-.”
She scans it and gives it back to him. “So now that the business is out of the way, I want to make this experience as comfortable and as satisfying as possible. Can you tell me your caste?”
“Rebirth was definitely a rebirth for you,” Tony says. “So, what were you running to Erskine for? Going to tattle tale on good old Howard’s perversion?”
He couldn’t say how or why but Tony knew it was more than a dream, more than memories mixed with half wishes. Yet, at the same time, Tony comprehended that if he walked across the room, if he opened one of the closed doors in the tenement apartment bedroom, it would open to nowhere and he would wake up. Everything would dissolve.  The dream existed outside of reality, maybe somewhere within weavings of the soul bond. A secured place for them to be together and explore who they were through this soul bond, through the linkage of Beloved.
“I need an update. Can you text Pepper for me? I need to know where Steve is. I am going to need him to help with the downgrade for the implant.”
“Well, as you know Captain America died nearly seventy years ago and all, but some of us, some of us wish he didn’t. Or at least think, he shouldn’t have died.”
