Steve ran a thumb up and down over the ridges of the bottle and across the plastic label.  It was the same kind they had at the facility, in one of those big jugs on top of the dispenser with the cone-shaped paper cups next to it.  Cone-shaped, so you couldn’t set it down somewhere.   Wouldn’t want to get rings on the tabletop or leave the place looking a mess, he supposed.   Had to keep up appearances.
The alien was looking down between Tony’s legs, still splayed wide on the table, wrapped in the not-gel that pulsed gently inside of him.  He looked up at Tony with a sort of softly tender expression, made more of those strange sounds--they were actually kind of nice, Tony decided, once you got used to them--that Tony supposed where the alien’s language.
His whole body throbbed in a constant ebb and flow of pain and something approaching the edge of ecstasy.  His balls were tight and heavy, and the weight of the cage kept tugging at him, not painfully, but an extra layer of constant stimulation no matter what he did.  His cock was on fire, sticky and messy with spurts of useless precum that coated the inside of his thighs and made his inner robe cling to his groin. His mouth was dry.  His eyes kept watering.  He wanted to weep, truly, but he couldn’t with Cam here. Sweat collected on his brow. A bead of it dripped down from under the head-covering he was wearing and caught on his eyelash, making him blink.
The Ul kept his eyes on Tony as he sucked lightly on the pipe. His son, Steve saw, watched the exchange with wide, dark eyes darting between the two men. “It is fortunate, then, that our peoples share such a longstanding bond.”
“Three more.  Hold still now,” Tony said.  He sounded winded.  He wiped at the sweat on his brow with the hand that still clutched the strap, then nodded, as if to himself, and raised his arm.  The rounded part of the strap landed directly on Steve’s hole, licking a long, hot stripe of pain down the crease of his ass.  The metal cock slammed into him.  Pain and pleasure exploded deep within him.  He howled with it.  His cock felt like it was going to burst with the need to come. He could feel the bars of the cage digging in to the sensitive flesh, but that was almost an afterthought to everything else.
“He may well be,” Steve acknowledged.  “He has a good heart. His life...it hasn’t been easy for him, up until now.  He’s happy, though. Thank you for that.”
This whole evening as even more disconcerting. Less than an hour ago, he’d been kneeling in front of Hammer, certain he was going to end up damning both himself and Cam to some horrible fate and now, Cam was off to get lemoncakes.  He couldn’t get his head around it all.  Half of him was convinced he would wake up and find himself in the hot box with Rumlow kicking at the sides and all of this was some mad fever dream.
“I--I--” Steve started, his voice breaking, shattering, he was shattering into a thousand blue shards. “Oh!”
None of it made any sense.  But, the memories, the feelings, the seemingly random thoughts, they were all familiar enough that Tony’s mind parsed it into something.
Putting aside Obie’s connections to a terrorist organization and attempts to have Tony assassinated, the man wasn’t wrong about the difficulties transitioning the company.  It was going to be painful, though Tony knew it would ultimately be worth it.  To do something that actually made the world better, safer in ways that actually solved the problems that laid the foundations for war and strife and brought people like Steve home before he had to learn how to count by sevens.
“I don’t like the sound of running water,” Steve said, looking down at the sink where the faucet emptied a steady stream next to the drain.
“Morning!  I see I found the only other early riser in Vegas not headed for the 99-cent buffet,” the woman said airily as the Stairmaster adjusted the incline for her.
An ancient place, Steve thought to himself as they walked, feeling a slight shiver run down his back. The light was graying into a haze now as the sun lowered between the peaks leaving a blaze of light across the valley below.  A barely discernible path wound its way through the trees, over a small stream, then deeper into the lush, green of the forest where it clung to the mountain like a cloak. Tony seemed to know his way well enough, though he had to double-back once.
“Seriously, this conversation might be the most afraid I’ve ever been, and I was held hostage by terrorists, so,” Tony shrugged.
“Oh, good Lord, now he’s all sentimental about the freaking watermelon,” Clint grumbled.   “It’s a fruit, Stark.  It’s not a symbolic fruit.  Let it go, man.’
The alien’s hands rubbed at Tony’s swollen belly.  He was huge now. Tony could feel them, moving around inside him as he floated in the gel.
“He doesn’t…” Steve started, then cut himself off with a flat grimace.  “To be honest, I’m not usually so...you know.”
“It isn’t about the money,” Steve said.  “I just really like being with you.”  As the words fell from his lips, they didn’t feel like a lie at all.
That thought was unexpectedly almost painful.  He probably should have been upset at the intrusion, if that’s what it was, but all things considered, it was hard to muster any real annoyance.  Instead, his chest tightened and he found himself holding his breath for a long moment, then slowly letting it out.  His jaw clenched, and he could feel a frown forming, though he wasn’t sure why, because it was nice, in its own weird way, what Tony did. If he did it.  Even if he hadn’t, it was still a nice night, and Steve could admit that much, though he couldn’t help but feel a bit like he was betraying Brock by thinking that way.
“You’re not serious,” Steve protested, with a tone that was already half acceptance.  “You are serious,” Steve corrected at Tony’s look.
to stop thinking of him.  He didn’t even know why he was thinking about all this stuff.  The worry about what to say to Brock was messing with his head or something.  What he needed to do was clear his head and stop--stop thinking these crazy thoughts.
through that. Yet, here he was, hitting back at something he couldn’t name, desperate to just… feel something, something other than this blinding, clawing panic because he’d watched--
of the helicopter’s approach and feel the wind pick up.  He watched the black speck get larger, studiously trying to ignore the warmth emanating from the man next to him. It wasn’t long before a sleek, black chopper emblazoned with Stark’s name on the side touched down on the rooftop helipad.  It resembled one of the military craft he was familiar with, but had clearly had a number of modifications done. A man Steve assumed must be the co-pilot opened the door and waved them in, greeting Tony with an easy welcome before sliding back into the chair next to the pilot.
“Seems smart,” Steve replied.  It did?  Okay.  Tony felt himself relax, some of the tension draining from his shoulders.  He took another bite, just to give his mouth something else to do.  “SI is pretty niche right now.  Short and medium range ballistic weaponry, mostly, right?  But, a lot of warfare is moving to precision strikes, unmanned drones, mobile units.  Not the kind of thing they launch from an aircraft carrier.”
.  Something extraordinary.  Something good. Just because he could.  Everyone seemed to think it was some kind of publicity stunt, and yeah, it was a little bit that, he supposed.  He didn’t do things half measures.
and whatever the hell else is going on—somehow, that’s all rolled up in there, too, and that’s on me.”
“I started falling in love with you that night in ’92,” Tony said, eyes downcast as he pulled the blanket tighter around Steve.  He raised his gaze, mouth going rueful. “Cannot
Steve probably wouldn’t answer if Tony texted him now, Tony thought with a morose sigh and puff of air that made his lips vibrate against the carpet.  Not after the way Tony had ended things.  Steve would probably ignore it. If he hadn’t already blocked Tony’s number.  It would have been easier if Steve had stormed out or yelled or acted like a normal human being, but no, of course he hadn’t.  He’d just looked like a kicked puppy and told Tony it was okay, if that was what Tony wanted.
“Some, my Lord, though he lacks the finesse and accomplishments we strive to provide our buyers,” Rumlow explained.  “Some buyers prefer that, though.  To train them themselves, to their own preferences, or,” Rumlow finished with a slight shrug, twitching the whip in the air.
The room suddenly felt hot, stifling almost. Steve’s skin prickled.  His breath caught in his chest.  His heart pounded, so loudly, he was sure the King must hear it.  Pressure snapped low in his belly and surged down his cock.  His lips parted in a small gasp.  The King glanced up at him, nodded his head back and forth, mouth curling into the beginnings of a smirk that looked far too knowing.
“Fine, okay. Whatever.  Come on, brainstorming time, let’s go,” Tony said, slapping his hand on the table.  “Wow me.”
Tony wondered what it would be like to be saturated with that scent.  To have every pore infiltrated with Steve’s musk.  To be able to breath it in, taste it in his mouth, feel it in the back of his throat.  He was warm and safe, so safe here, with Steve draped over him.  Not just safe from the boogie man, in whatever form he took.  Howard.  Other Alphas.  This broken, brittle world.  The one the Alphas built that they now told Omegas they had to protect them from.
“Artistic license, then,” Tony said slowly, dropping his eyes for a moment before raising them back to Steve, all wide and liquid and gleaming.  “Sometimes, maybe…maybe it’s okay to see the world differently than how it is.  Maybe how things are, maybe that’s not everything they are.”
He was playing it off as nothing, which was what Steve tended to do, Tony knew, but Tony had the odd suspicion that Steve had given up on the whole bus stalemate because Tony had gotten cold, and that was…well, he didn’t know what that was.  Just like old times, a voice in his head supplied.  Steve always put Tony first.  Even now, that’s what Steve thought he was doing.  Putting Tony first.  Sacrificing his own happiness, because he thought it was best for Tony.  The dumbass.
“Here’s the deal, I’ll give you twenty thousand a month for your apartment, but I need you to leave, like, right now,” Tony told him.  “Out. Vamoose. Gone.  You and…whatever bottles you can carry.”
that, Tony, you should, and--God, I’m saying this all wrong, I--” Steve cut off, forcing himself to stop blathering like an idiot at the man.  “I want to say sorry again here, but I know that bugs you,” he added with a small, deprecating smile.
“Happy said you’d been working on a project?” Steve asked, hoping against hope this wasn’t the point in the day’s visit where he got to sound like an utter idiot.  “Something big?  Is it for the, uh, clean energy thing?”  Steve asked, trying to sound at least reasonably aware of what was going on.
, and familiar was good--known, expected, even an awful familiarity,  that--it was like his mind just sort of wanted to skim right past it and move on, but he forced himself to double back and hook on to that, holding on for all he was worth.  He needed this.  It was a bit like getting punched, though maybe that would have been easier in some ways because he knew how that song went, and God, he hated that thought.  It had always been there, lurking below the surface, and now it just bubbled up, right there, in the front of his mind, so he couldn’t look away, not this time.
“You’ve no idea how much it meant to me to hear your words,” Tony said, voice wavering and tight with some emotion Steve couldn’t identify.  His eyes were wide, wet and filled with a wretched misery that made Steve’s heart thud against his chest, a denial springing to his lips before Tony spoke words he didn’t want to hear, though he couldn’t quite let it out.  “Steve…” Tony broke off, shaking his head, brow furrowing into a frown as his mouth tightened.  His hands spasmed against Steve’s jaw, fingers digging in almost hard enough to be painful.  Clutching, grasping, trying to hold on. Almost, Steve thought, though it wafted through his mind like empty air through his fingers.    “I will make you happy, keep you safe, see you free from want and strife.  We will make this realm better, you and I.  Together. I see that as clearly as I see you before me.  You will challenge me, anger me, make me laugh, and make me think.  You will do all of these things, and I will lay the world at your feet in return,” Tony promised, gazing up at him, eyes burning hard with the force of it.  Tony’s hands dropped away, and he stepped back, putting the distance of the tub between them.  He reached for the towel again and dried his hands, keeping his eyes down while he completed the task.   Finally, he looked back up at Steve. “I know all of these things.  As surely as I know that you will never love the man who asks you to call him Master.”
Shellhead’s tentacles splashed around him, and he grinned in obvious delight, then dove under the water, only to resurface a short distance away.  Under he went again, popping up next to the
They’d been so full of hope, then.  Or, he had.  He wasn’t sure about Bucky, or if Buck had just gone along with him on this desperate, cross-country jaunt for lack of anything else to do, or simply out of habit at this point.  He’d just…figured things would work out.  They’d get the appeal paperwork done with the VA.  Explain things to the nice man behind the desk.  People would listen.  It all seemed stupidly optimistic and naïve at this point, but it had taken months to realize that they’d passed as good as it was going to get a long time ago.
“Tony, don’t shoot Clint,” Natasha admonished. “I know we’ve all wanted to at some point, but it’ll just create a bigger slip hazard.”  Fair point, Tony mentally conceded, lowering his gauntleted hand.
“Hey now, shhhh, none of that,” Tony soothed, his hands coming up to stroke up and down over Steve’s back. “I did not mean to upset you.”
, he thought, and wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation.  “I wanted to see you,” he finished, because that was the truth of it, and he couldn’t give Tony all the truth, but he could give him that.
Yeah, he frowned, but there was a moment there, just a second really, right before he drifted off to sleep, when he was laying in that huge bed with Tony curled in his arms when it was like he could almost see this other life just at the edge of his vision. Like if he turned his head quickly enough, he could catch it.  He hadn’t, of course, because there wasn’t anything there, just him and this crazy night with Tony that was faded and
“Yeah, guess so,” Steve replied, staring down at his phone.  He glanced up at Brock and paused, letting the silence hang there for a beat.  For a second, Steve thought Brock was going to say something.  Tell him not to go. That this was a mistake.  He didn’t, and of course, Steve didn’t really expect him to, since they would be crazy not to do this. It would be stupid to be disappointed.
“Are they? Are they free? What does that even mean? Is the mother who can’t put food on her table because there was no rain making a free choice when she sells herself? It’s an illusion, Steve, it’s a service, like any other, and being a concubine is a far better lot in life than most get, you’re just--
To his right, more footsteps, and Tony spun on his heels and aimed the repulsor, firing off a quick shot, only to have it bounce off the door that had been hanging from its hinges a moment ago and hit a fire hydrant, which spouted a geyser of water.
“Great. Wonderful. That’s…yeah, so, okay, that’s the plan, then.  We can tell Steve about the whole Board thing—being his idea and all—have some dinner.  With Barnes and Nat.  Fun.  Good times.  I’m excited for this plan,” Tony stammered, planting his hands on his hips.  “Got my wingman.  Master of Woo. It’s all good. Everything’s going to be fine. How could this possibly go wrong?”
“I told you my best memory.  Ante up, Mini-Golf Rainman, what’s your best childhood memory?” Tony settled on instead.
“I’m not going to do that, Brock,” Steve said, his voice firm and surprisingly calm given the turmoil swirling inside him.
It felt amazing. Soft, but firm, just like he remembered. Just the way he liked it, and the hole was loose and winking at him as he spread the man’s ass apart and then let go, enjoying the sight. He stroked himself again, making sure he was good and slick, spreading some of the copious pre-cum he was dripping around the head.
“Always,” Steve said, dropping his hands onto Tony’s shoulders.  “My Tony,” he whispered, leaning forward to press his forehead to Tony’s.  “You did it. You made it.  Now, go show them who you are.  Go shine.”
“What sort of thing?” Steve pressed.  He tried to keep his voice steady. It took some effort.  As always, when it came to this kind of wordplay, the conversations that hid inside others, he found himself off-kilter.  He could feel his hands curl into fists around the chair handles. Fury’s eye glanced down surreptitiously, catching the motion, and Steve forced himself to relax.
“I’d like to come by the Tower,” Steve said, surprising himself a bit at just how appealing the idea of seeing Stark again was.  Tony, he mentally corrected.  Of course, the whole notion of dating Tony was insane.  He couldn’t really have a relationship with Tony.  Could he?  No, of course not. That would never work.  It was crazy.  Crazier than falling for a guy whose face you can’t even see?
A footnote.  In a journal article from the sixties.  Not even a peer-reviewed journal, just something that aspired to it.  That was all he had been able to find.  Doctor Simon Brewster, PhD, speculated that there could be an occurrence when a mate dies in utero, before the mark forms on the fetus but after the bond develops, though Doctor Brewster carefully noted that he could find no record of such a thing actually happening.  Maybe no one wanted to know about it.  Why would you?  It wasn’t something that could be cured.  There were no colored ribbons, no fundraisers, no pink vacuums or catchy bumper stickers.  What would be the point?
He stared at the oil lamps dangling from the arched roof of the tent, their flames flickering and casting dappled shadows across the walls. Outside, he could hear voices raised in conversation again, occasionally punctuated by bouts of loud laughter.
“Think I just won’t let you out of my sight anymore,” Steve said after a beat of silence that held the promise of many, many, undoubtedly very long conversations to come.
wasn’t supposed to make him feel like that.  Brock had wanted him to do it.  Encouraged him.  And he was so happy afterwards, they were
Steve’s eyes drifted shut and his head lolled back as Tony’s tongue lapped along the underside of his cock, lips pursing to suck lightly around the throbbing skin. When he opened his eyes again, he was staring through the bows of trees at a pinkening sky in an impossibly bright world.  He blinked and looked down again, finding Tony watching him, eyes wide and nearly black, an exultant look on his face.  Steve felt him flick his tongue out against the tip of Steve’s cock, then he flattened his tongue to swirl around the head in long, lingering circles.  It was almost too much, too much at once, and Steve heard himself cry out, swaying slightly.  His hands went to the top of Tony’s head and winding in his hair seemingly of their own accord, but it anchored him, somehow helping him to stay upright.
Tony moved to the front, beside General Rhodes, and the other guards arranged themselves in a standard formation around him, though a half-dozen held themselves back and surrounded the carriage instead.
Steve stared down at where Tony sat on the chaise, elbows braced against his knees, hands running rhythmically through his hair, back and forth.  He walked over and bent down, pressing his mouth against Tony’s.  In an instant, the kiss deepened, Tony’s tongue swiping into Steve’s mouth, his arms winding around Steve’s neck to pull him closer, until Steve’s hands were braced on either side of Tony on the chaise while Tony clung to his shoulders.  When they finally pulled apart, Tony let his head fall against Steve’s shoulder for a moment, then dropped his hands and lay back against the chaise while Steve hovered over him.
Taking the suit out of the closet, he unzipped it from the dust bag and ran a hand over the lapel.  It was a dark blue, with a few small crystals shining across the pockets and collar.  Sure, blue had the downside of his mother being right, but it did look good on him.  The bling was flashy, but not ostentatious.  A dark blue shirt and matching tie went underneath, with a single, crystal stud for the tie pin.  He spent too much time trying to shame his hair into cooperating. Without much success.  A bit of eyeliner and the barest swipe of shadow were enough, he thought.  The mascara was somewhat mockingly described by the name Better Than Sex, but he gave it a shot, and ended up with blotches of dark stain at the corners of his eyes and grave concerns about the love lives of make-up marketing people.  Heeled boots were last, giving him a bit of height and making his ass look great under his jacket.
“Thought I’d lost you two boys,” Natasha said from where she lounged against the doorframe as they approached, apparently materializing from behind the potted ficus.
“I’ve already called Happy to bring the car around,” Steve told him, then paused, giving Tony a considering look.  “I’ll always come find you, Tony.  You belong to me.”
He brought his hands to his face and breathed out a few times to warm them, then tucked the folder under one arm and pushed his hands into his pockets.  Pepper was probably worried.  He really should call her back.  At least text.  He did neither, just walked forward towards the street, where streams of pedestrians flowed back and forth, heads down against the cold wind.  The wind hit him again as soon as he was out of the alleyway, like it had been lying in wait.  God, it was cold, he thought with a shiver, hunching his shoulders. Fitting, he supposed.  It was always cold when he met Steve.
Howard was an expert at playing on insecurities, and he and Steve both served their own up on silver platters. We believed it because we both already half-believed it, Tony realized. We did most of Howard's work for him, Tony thought with a sinking maw of realization opening up in his stomach.
“Well,” Tony said slowly, the beginnings of a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth.  “Let’s go make a mess then.”
“So, about the contract.  Anything you want to specify?  We usually set it up with a condo, leased vehicle, monthly stipend, clothing allowance, that kind of thing…is there anything in particular you wanted to add?” she asked, all business again.
He liked Steve’s predictability.  The routine.  The way Steve’s routine allowed Tony to anticipate things, so he would know how to react.  He liked being prepared.  This…these switch-flickers, God, he hated them.  It was his birthday.  Which was, admittedly, a stupid, selfish reason for not wanting to deal with this, but he couldn’t help thinking it.  Stop being human on my birthday. Yeah.  A bit unfair.
“Always so responsive for me,” Tony said, smoothing his hands over Steve’s chest and gently pushing Steve’s hands out of his hair.  Steve stared dumbly at him, mouth opening and closing silently.
“Who said you could put that away?” Tony demanded, then grinned and tugged at Steve’s shoulders until he fell down next to Tony on the bed, making the whole thing bounce underneath them.  Tony sat up, then turned over and twisted himself until he had one leg thrown over Steve’s lap.  Steve sat up and gripped Tony’s thighs where the gown bunched up between them.  One of the shoulders had fallen down, and Tony saw Steve’s eyes dart to the curve of his neck, unblemished, unlike the other side.  Tony reached out and cupped Steve’s jaw in his hands, titling Steve’s head until his Alpha was looking up at him.  “I missed you, too, you know. I hate it when you’re gone.”
“Uh, not the state of my art,” Howard countered. His hair was nearly white now.  The lines around his eyes and mouth were deeper and more noticeable.  Otherwise, he looked much the same as the last video, though there was a new tightness pulling the skin across his face and small, spiderweb-like strings of color on his cheeks.  “Nice, though. Hey, Maria, can you—thanks, hon,” he said, as his wife took the decanter out of his hand and set it on the bar cart behind him, handing him a glass of what Steve assumed was eggnog instead, though clearly not only eggnog.  “Obie’s running late. Something with the end of the year financials, I don’t know,” he said with an indifferent wave of his hand.
“I can put them away while you clean up the, uh, frying pan, if you want,” Steve offered, nodding towards the pan that was sitting cooling in the sink with bits of egg and kale still stuck to it.
“I’m just saying,” Tony replied with a smile pulling up the corners of his mouth.  “God-damned, fucking fairy tale ending shit right here.”
Shellhead frowned, opened his mouth, then looked down and clutched at his blue stone necklace. His hand seemed to almost reflexively open and close around it, but he finally dragged his gaze back up to Steve and sighed, sounding a bit frustrated, before he seemed to force himself to relax, his eyes going soft and crinkling at the corners.  He patted Steve’s hand, stroking his knuckles almost absently against the skin there. They hadn’t, not since that night, of course. It had been a one-time thing, Steve knew. Him leaving, the rum, the rush of finishing the
Steve ground his forehead back and forth against the bed, hands fisting in the sheets, but pressed back against Tony’s hand even as his body was still shaking from his orgasm. Tony moved his hand from Steve’s back to wrap around Steve’s cock, stroking the sensitive underside along the throbbing vein there, keeping him hard while Tony’s fingers worked relentlessly to stimulate his prostate. It took a little longer, but soon enough, Tony felt fluid begin to pulse from the head of Steve’s cock  as his body clenched around Tony's fingers.
.  I think I will be fast instead.  I have been practicing,” he added, darting a hand out.  “I will get one, you will see. I will practice on our trip, and when we return, I will catch one.  Here,” Cam said, holding up a soft cotton robe.  “To protect your skin, so you do not shed it like a serpent again,” Cam said, wrinkling his nose at the memory of the first time they had spent the day at the beach.
Steve scrolled through the various faculty and program pages until the sun was low enough over the mountains that he figured Tony would emerge from his garage soon. Finally, he pushed himself off the sofa and walked into the kitchen where a drawer held a number of menus for local restaurants.  He leafed through them until he found one promising Italian-style pizza, whatever that meant.  He had no idea what Tony would like, so picked four options at random and decided to hope for the best.
The alien cocked his head to the side and regarded Tony for a moment, then made one of his strange whalesong-dolphin-Eurotrash music noises.  “Sorry,” the alien grimaced. “It is difficult to translate names correctly between our languages. I...I worked for a while on yours.”
“Guessing Howard got the ‘You Tried’ Badge on that one, though, huh?” Tony asked.  “Yeah, forget it.  It’s fine.”
The limo door sprang open, jarring Steve back to reality.  A stocky man in a chauffeur’s outfit stood holding the handle.  “Evening, Boss,” he said pleasantly.  “Sir,” he nodded in Steve’s direction.  And, ok, that…was weird.  He wondered briefly how often Tony’s chauffeur dealt with one of Tony’s evening guests.  By the studiously neutral expression he wore, probably fairly often.
“Thanks,” Steve said teasingly, nudging Brock’s shoulder with his own as they walked and tossing him a smile.
Peggy looked between them, then down at Tony.  Over the top of Tony’s head, she and Jarvis exchanged a look as the silence grew heavy to the point of awkward.  Finally, Tony peeled the paper away, the tearing sound seeming to rend the room with tiny fissures relieving a pressure.  He held up the toy in front of him and looked at it for a long moment.
“So.  You.  Me. The even-more-ostentatious-than-the-original Eiffel Tower,” Tony continued, still with the same sort of haphazard disconnect, like he was reciting something, Steve thought, and wondered if maybe he was.  “Given what we, uh, talked about. Earlier.  With the whole awkward non-awkwardness thing.  You like me, I like you, all that touchy-feely stuff.  Not that there will be any touchy-feely, I’m just—I’m saying, with dinner, it’s…”
“Classics!  Are you kidding?  Back in Black?  Suicidal Tendencies?  This is the pinnacle of music, my friend, and
That was the first time, in the dark, with the clock ticking its way through the night, on the heels of war and rockets and something shifting and reordering itself that seemed just out of reach when Tony tried to catch on to the thought.
Tony brushed past him and sprawled on one of the chaise, immediately taking out his tablet and setting to work.
“I know,” Fury said, holding up his hands in front of him in a placating gesture.  “You have to understand, we were concerned—“
These new tendrils of information were winding their way through his head, invaders in a once-ordered land, and as much as a part of him wanted to reject the thoughts as meaningless, or at least less meaningful than some deep, dark corner of his brain wanted to make them, he couldn't dismiss them when they were stored so carefully, huddled and secreted away, but
Harder now, the King pounded into him, his thrusts losing some of their rhythm in favor of quick snaps of his hips.  Steve felt the King’s hands under him, lifting, spreading, and suddenly, the angle was different, pleasure exploding inside him on each thrust.
Finally satisfied with the sketch, Steve brushed the flecks of charcoal away and stared at it for a long moment.  It was good, he thought, and Tony was right. He hadn’t drawn Bucky in a long time. It felt right, for whatever reason. Maybe just that he could remember his friend like this--happy, smiling, at peace--without the usual layer of guilt and grief that typically colored his thoughts.  Maybe that was an accomplishment in and of itself.
“I’ve been texting you forever,” Tony retorted, then winced and rubbed at his temples.  The little man who apparently lived inside his head seemed to want to pound a railroad spike into his skull with each word.
“Sounds good,” Tony agreed, following Steve towards the cabin’s front door.  He stopped long enough to put his hands on his hips, twist a bit and pop his back.  Sleeping in a deck chair wasn’t exactly the best idea, chiropractically speaking.  “There’s some leftovers in the ‘fridge, if you’re hungry.  Don’t panic, I didn’t make them, so they’re edible.  Pretty decent, actually. Coulson had the food delivered while you were—oh.  I guess you probably know that,” Tony amended, catching Steve’s lack of surprise.
“Uh, yeah.  Sure, Cap.  We’ll do it again sometime,” Tony replied, then scrunched his face into a mask of disgust.  When had he gotten so absolutely awful at this? Probably around the time he started caring what response he got, he assumed.  Steve started off down the hall in the direction of his room, then stopped abruptly, turning halfway around towards Tony again, sending Tony’s heart into his throat.  He wasn’t sure if it was fear or anticipation or hope or some horrible mix of all three that was making his breath catch and stomach twist into knots, but dear God, he couldn’t keep doing this.  How had Steve managed for all those months?
Tony just stared at him, mouth working, but no sound coming out.  That couldn’t be right.  Could. Not.  He would have noticed if Steve had been, what?  Asking him out?  That was ridiculous.  They’d been friends, and sure, Steve had spent a lot of time in the workshop or garage, and true, Tony had done a lot of the talking, but they’d done other things, too.  The occasional movie.  The Star Trek marathon.  Sparring.
“Oh, ah,” Coulson stopped, holding out a hand when Howard started to follow along behind.  “Just Anthony, Mr. Stark.  Agent Thompson here will show you and Mrs. Stark to a waiting area where I’m sure you’ll be comfortable. Snacks.  Drinks.  Cable TV.  We’ve got all the toys,” Coulson promised, though there was something almost challenging running under the words, nice as they seemed on the surface.
been a show.  Because he hadn’t liked what was going on, because he hadn’t wanted to get involved, because Tony had clearly signaled money, and Steve was desperate enough to be stupid sometimes.  He didn’t know what this was.  Steve could taste the sweet tang of champagne and wine.  There was wet heat beyond, tantalizing him, and he wanted more, so much more.

“I was right!  There was a…fungus…thing,” Tony said quickly.  “That’s just responsible pet ownership.”
“God, I love it when you talk strategy,” Tony grinned.  “I probably still owe that campus bagel place a hundred bucks or so on your jelly packets.”
“Worth a shot, I guess, right?” Steve replied with a casual shrug of his shoulders. Tony could practically hear the inner monologue of don't get your hopes up in Steve's tight voice and the way he suddenly seemed fascinated with the contents of Tony's desktop, but what was there to say about it? Sorry you almost got blown up? Could've been worse. Look at Barnes. Though, there was something to be said for losing something entirely versus having just enough of something to still feel close enough to it that it hurt every time you got near to having it.
“You read a lot,” Tony said because he didn’t know what else to say, but the conversation had dwindled to the point where he knew an exit ramp was fast approaching, and he suddenly very much did not want to leave yet.  He swept out a hand, indicating the bookcase.  “Kept trying to get you to put books on your tablet, but you’d go to those library sales or used book stores and come home with bags full.  You said that way I couldn’t even give you grief for killing trees.  Uh—deforestation.  It’s a thing now,” Tony attempted to explain at Steve’s blank look.  “Anyway, you do use the art apps on the tablet sometimes, at least.  I can show you how to work them, if you want.”
“Get to your room,” Howard ordered, pulling himself up and straightening his suit jacket.  “We’ll go meet Captain Rogers day after tomorrow.  Your mom’s got people coming to get you ready starting tomorrow morning.  Try to think before you do anything stupid.  And then, word of advice?  Don’t even try it.”
Tony smiled softly. “I’m… I’m very glad to hear that.” Steve watched him swallow thickly and glance away, blinking, before he turned back to Steve and smiled heartily, shoving a huge bite of donut in his mouth.
“Get out,” Barnes snapped.  This time, no one bothered admonishing him, though their silence spoke volumes.
“Have you, ah...lived here long?  I can’t believe I’ve never heard people talk of this place,” Steve said, glancing around a bit to take in the unusual array of things in the room again.  “It’s old, isn’t it? How did you find it?”
“You…made a flashcard. About skin cancer,” Steve repeated in confusion, frowning down at the card Tony was holding out to him.
It had been rationed during the War, Steve recalled. Not for soldiers, of course. The rationing was because so much of the supply was being diverted overseas.  It was one of those strangely murky memories from before.  He remembered stretching the coffee as far as he could by boiling it on the stove or sometimes, adding a bit of chicory, and could almost taste the bitterness on his tongue.  Almost, but not quite.  It was the first thing to come off the rationing list, Steve remembered.  In ‘43, just after his birthday.  Americans would put up with a lot for the War effort, but apparently drew the line at rationing coffee.
“Now,” Tony began.  “If this is your first time with the fondue, I should warn you that it can take a few times before you really get the hang of—“
He knew that, on extremely rare occasions, no examples of which came immediately to mind, his own biology got the better of him. It was hardly his fault he was Bonded to the most amazing Omega ever and this was pure and true and right. Blame the universe. The important thing was that he was prepared for this. He wasn’t some insane Alpha ruled by his hormones. Those days were gone. He was a man of science. A futurist, able to predict outcomes and eventualities and prepare for them. That was what he did. This was just biology. Nothing to worry about, he told himself as his eyes fell closed.
“You said go,” Steve reminded him, then shrugged, grinned and reached out a hand to pull Tony to his feet.  Tony looked around him in seeming confusion, like he was trying to figure out how he’d ended up flat on his back so fast.
“I gotta pee,” Tony said after Steve pulled the syringe out.  “Before this stuff knocks me out.”  He was looking off to the side, not at Steve, obviously uncomfortable.
“Ah, Lord Sitwell, so good to see you have returned!  Tell me that your trip was more successful than the last,” the fat man said, bowing low.
to go there, but what about this night was planned?  This was the direction he would always go to get there, and the other option, the road down, took him right into town, which was decidedly not where he wanted to go at the moment.  And how had the man known he used to play at slaying dragons? Sure, lots of boys probably did that, even Bucky liked to join in sometimes when they met up down by Bucky’s house nearer to town.
“Lot simpler than cooking burgers with the equivalent of a Bic lighter and harsh language. How was the glass thing?” Tony asked when Steve sat down on the covered folding chair opposite him.
A day of basically holding his finger in front of it and telling himself he wasn’t touching it gave way to the manna from heaven that arrived in the form of a delivery of freshly-laundered clothes from the cleaners.  He would just hang them up in the closet, Tony told himself.  Wouldn’t want the shirts to get wrinkled or anything.
Muffled voices carried out into the hallway from the study.  His father’s rapid-fire of ideas talking over everyone.  Obie’s deep drawl.  His mother’s lilting laugh that always sounded like champagne bubbling over a crystal flute in Tony’s mind.  All those months ago, he’d stood outside these same honey-colored doors and listened while they negotiated his life away with Fury and the parade of hardware-wearing Alphas who showed up with him.
,” Steve finished. The last came out in a choked-off sob, and Tony found himself pressed so hard against Steve’s chest he thought he might get his wish or maybe he already had, melded together until everything that was a part of him was a part of Steve, too.
At that, Tony grinned, “Hi, yourself.”  Tony stopped for a moment and seemed to be taking him in, looking him up and down in that way that he had of focusing so intently on Steve that it managed to make him both incredibly self-conscious and a little turned on.  More than a little.
“Too easy,” Tony muttered.  It sounded garbled, shaky and slightly slurred, even to his own ears, but at least he could get words out without wanting to choke on them, so there was that.
Numb.  The absence of feeling.  He wasn’t upset.  Upset would be something, and this…this was nothing.  He looked down at the letter, sitting up in tri-fold on the table.  MIT.  Steve wanted him to go to MIT.  This was amazing.  Unheard of.  Fantastic.  Wonderful.
“Well.  Thus far, we’ve covered politics, clandestine advanced weaponry design, and I take it you’re Catholic, so that’s religion,” Tony ticked off as he chewed.  “Why not knock out the rest of the controversial subjects and be done with it?”
“Wasn’t sure if my message had gotten through,” Steve said, looking up at the jet and raising his hand in a little wave of acknowledgment.
“This whole city’s like a fucking wind tunnel,” Tony said after a long pause.  The wind made it feel exponentially worse than it was, sending the icy rain on a slant that stung any skin exposed to it like tiny needles.  Also, wet.  Ugh, Tony thought miserably.
He waded over to where the creature was sprawled and sat down on the sand a short distance away, pulling his leg up and wrapping his arms around his knees.  He was getting hungry now, but he trusted that the creature would leave soon and return with whatever it scrounged for Steve’s breakfast. Steve had to admit that he was impressed by the variety, especially given the lack of many resources on their shared island. The islands that dotted the region were plentiful and some, unlike this glorified sandbar,  were filled with all kinds of bounty, he knew, but Shellhead had to be getting some of what he brought back from a hidden store of pirate plunder somewhere, Steve figured. Treasure maps were a penny each in port, and they weren’t worth even that, but the marauders who frequented the area did use the uninhabited islands for storage, at least that was what Sam said.  It made some sense that his friend probably knew about a few, hopefully abandoned, caches.
“Uh, we called you Third Wheel for like six months.  To your face.  Tony rolled a tire to your apartment.  With a little sign that said “Third Wheel” on it. With sparkles.  He used glitter glue, for Christ’s sake,” Barnes reminded him.  “Nat had that t-shirt made that said Official Third Wheel.  We went bike riding that time and all chipped in to pay the rental guy an extra fifty to say all he had for you was that big tricyle.”
“Yeah,” Steve agreed, thrusting his hips a bit so his cock slid along Tony’s.  The friction of skin against skin, barely coated by a smattering of pre-cum, was glorious.  “Oh, yeah,” he shuddered with the intensity of feeling.
Steve was a healthy, adult Alpha.  What did Tony really expect?  Celibacy? No.  No, but…if he was honest, he hadn’t expected Steve to take his suggestion as some kind of time-challenge event.  Didn’t take him long to find someone he enjoyed enough to feel badly about poor Tony, stuck at home with his robots and his numbers, Tony thought with an inward snort of derision.  He flexed his fingers over the curve of the wheel and stared steadfastly ahead.  The car was great.  He loved it. He did.   It was great.
“I’ve never found cleaning up more satisfying in my life,” Jarvis added through flattened lips.  “And how did…the, ah, socket experiment go, if I may ask?”
“If you believe what troubles him to be of my doing, then am I not the one who can fix it?” Steve asked.  “You know he will not send for me,” Steve pressed, the words stinging even as they were pulled from him, making his throat tighten as he tried to swallow.  “He will not do it, you know he won’t.  Is he better now than he was the night I left? Is he happier? Does he sleep and eat better as the days have worn on?”
Just…unexpected.  Much like Tony’s current lack of domestic duties.  Steve, as it turned out, preferred to do the cooking, mainly because he took the whole thing about eating small meals throughout the day as some kind of personal challenge, and, as he assured Tony, figured it wasn’t fair to expect Tony to try to keep up with his metabolism.  Tony strongly suspected this, while possibly true given Steve’s physique, was what he’d come to think of as “Steve-speak” for ‘Please, God, don’t make me another omelet.’  Steve had a way of saying things that were both true and completely full of shit at the same time, a skill Tony had to grudgingly admire.  Steve was probably just too polite to admit the truth, not that Tony wasn’t relieved to be free of the apron strings, though Steve’s staple of recipes was heavy on the meat and potatoes and whatever could be boiled, which turned out, unfortunately, to be most anything.
When they did finally arrive, Steve got out of the car and somewhat awkwardly thanked Happy for the lift.  He supposed the chauffeur probably knew what Steve had been doing with his employer, but was too polite--or maybe too jaded by now--to say anything.
“Don’t call the baby a dick,” Natasha retorted from the co-pilot’s seat.  “Yep.  Definitely not a phrase I thought I would need.”
“Well, we all know you’re overly emotional like that,” Tony grinned.  He raised a hand in greeting to Nat and Bucky, who were over by the bar with Clint and Pepper and…Happy, somewhat to Tony’s surprise, who was handing Pepper a glass of champagne.  Bucky lifted a glass in return, his metal arm glinting in the light from the chandeliers.
“I don’t imagine this is quite what your, ah butler?” Steve asked and waited for Tony’s nod.  “Probably not what he had in mind when he gave it to you.”
Warm drops of oil hit his hole and dribbled down.  He hissed, more in surprise than anything, then felt the King’s fingers gently tracing around the rim before one slowly slid inside.  Steve’s body jerked instinctively at the intrusion, though it didn’t hurt.  He was still loose from the preparation at Zola’s.  The King could just…get it over with, Steve thought, but he didn’t, just worked his finger in to the knuckle and kept it here, letting Steve get used to it.  He thrust slowly in deeper, then out again, pumping his hand at Steve’s hole.
“Though he does crave approval, I do not think that is necessary or advisable,” Thor offered sagely.
“Howard?” his mother called, her perfectly-coiffed head peeking out of the billiards room, where the crack of the cue stick against the cue ball seemed to break something else open inside Tony.  He wanted to run, to flee, to just be anywhere but here, but there wasn’t any place to go.  No one would hire an unbonded Omega.  He had no money to his name, since he couldn’t even open a bank account.  He was surrounded by riches, and couldn’t own any of them.  And there was absolutely nothing wrong with anything happening here tonight, at least as far as the rest of the world outside of Tony’s party of one was concerned.  So, there were some hurdles to his escape plan, he could admit.
Steve wasn’t sure when he had given up on some attempt at decency.  He knew he should avert his gaze, but he couldn’t look away.  It was all too much.  Too much input, too much to see, too much to take in, too much to feel.  He was rock hard and leaking all over the front of his pants, or at least it felt that way.  He had no idea how much of what he was feeling was real and how much was this dreamscape messing with his mind.  Still, he couldn’t stop looking.  He could admit, at least to himself, that he didn’t really want to.  These Steves, they got to have this with Tony. Something he would never get to have.  He should look away, but it seemed impossible to actually do so.  Instead, he stared, transfixed, as the other version of him circled Tony’s hole with his tongue, then flicked against it, up, down, side to side, then finally, delved in, licking deep.
“Uh, the Jetsons? Cartoon. From the sixties, I think? But, there was, like, a reboot in the eighties. Astro the dog, Rosie the robot? None of that ring a bell?” Tony asked, momentarily bewildered. Come on, Steve was older than him, but he wasn't
“You’re the one voting,” Tony said with a shrug, trying to keep his voice neutral and mostly succeeding, thanks in no small part to the bite of biscuit he shoved in his mouth.
For a moment, Tony’s skin was burning hot and his mouth was so dry, he couldn’t get enough spit to form words.  There was a buzzing in the back of his ears, distant, like a fly at the light outside the door, zapping in and out.  He darted his tongue out to wet his lips and looked down at his plate of food.
“You really aren’t going to hurt me, are you?” Steve asked.  He realized he already knew the answer.  He suspected that if Tony truly intended him harm, there wasn’t likely much he could do about it, but he didn’t think that was Tony’s purpose.  If so, why such an elaborate scheme to get him up here? Why not simply accost him one night when he was coming back from the village? It made no sense. And, well, something else, something deeper and more certain, told him that he was safe. The drumbeat of terror, the need to run, they drained away as his memories returned to fill those dark recesses.  That night on the road, he hadn’t been afraid, not while Tony was with him.  Unnerved, yes, but not
“A Bond,” Steve said, trying out the word in his mind as he said it.  It was a warm thought, too, he noticed, warm and glowing with a soft, hazy sort of incandescence in his mind, and wondered when he had started to classify thoughts and words that way.  “Just like that.”
“I understand the menu for your dinner has been pre-arranged with the Chef this evening,” the maitre’d said.
, and whatever…whatever pride I had, I’d left it behind somewhere. Maybe I was the person everyone saw.  I mean, there I was, down on some grubby hotel floor grabbing for dollars like it was some kind of gameshow,” Steve sighed, running a hand through his hair, then letting it fall to his side where he picked at the seam of his jeans. “Maybe it was true.”
Steve looked away, his eye catching on the doors, where the silent guards stood in shadows so deep he could only make out the play of the fire on their armor in long, glowing threads.  On the other side of the doors, there was a whole world he hated.  Or, thought he did.  Were they all terrible, like Zola and Hammer and that Stane person?  Would Tony really choose to surround himself with such people?  It was like trying to read a book with half of the page missing.  He looked back at Tony, finding his expression soft and almost sad, as if the melancholy he accused of Steve had found a new home.  In here, the book was so easy to read, to enjoy, to let the story play out.  But, in here was not real.
“I understand them about you, Tony.  That’s—that’s how I feel about you, too,” Steve confessed quickly, before Tony could bolt.  Tony’s hand fell form the doorknob, and he turned slowly to face Steve, disbelief and something like hope warring for prominence on his features.  “And if I’d realized I might not get to see you again, I would have told you that I am drag you to safety, give you the medicine, keep you warm, let you have the food, pray for rescue, want to wake up and see you kind of crazy in love with you.  Tell me you would have done any differently if our positions were reversed.”
“I don’t know why I even suggested it,” Steve said, then continued before Tony could interrupt with what Steve was certain was another attempt at insisting he wanted to do something he patently did not want to do.  “I don’t even have supplies. I think I saw some rods in the garage before you--before you. They might still work. But, I’d have to get bait and tackle, anyway. It--forget it, okay?  Sorry, I’m...I’ll think of something else. Watching the other movies sounds great. I’d really like that.”
Tony pushed the buttons for the Doritos and watched them fall to the bottom of the machine.  He dug them out and headed back down the hallway towards Steve’s room.  Most people were used to seeing him around by now, and since almost everyone in Medical was a Beta, his presence didn’t cause much of a stir past the initial curiosity.    He turned the corner of the corridor and came to a halt with the edge of a Cool Ranch sticking out of his mouth.
“I draw you. All the time,” Steve said, emphasizing each word carefully. “I don’t mean to.  I start out planning to draw that busker down in Central Park who does the thing with the chairs or that woman at the library with the three hats who feeds the pigeons,” Steve tried to explain.  “Once I start drawing though…it’s you. It’s always you, Tony,” Steve admitted, making it a declaration, willing Tony to understand what he was trying to say.
“What did I tell you would happen if you left my bed again without permission?” Tony asked, almost nonchalantly, voice silky and smooth.
“Tony, my boy, good to see you!  Didn’t expect you to show, to tell you the truth,” Stane said, clapping Tony on the back and giving him a slight shake.  Steve slid his arm around Tony’s waist and pulled him closer, effectively disentangling him from Stane’s grip. Stane’s eyes flicked over to him, gave him a once over, then dismissed him and narrowed on Tony again.  It was all Steve could do not to drag Tony away. The urge to get Tony somewhere that this man wasn’t was nearly overwhelming, though he tamped it down and forced himself to let Tony make his own call on this one. Tony had, at the very least, earned that right where Stane was concerned.
Obie naked, he thought, closing his eyes with a grimace as he felt himself harden.  Obie naked.  But, all his mind not-so-helpfully conjured was Steve staring Obie down and refusing to give an inch until Tony asked it of him.  Rolling over on his stomach, Tony stared at the light blue wall between the slats headboard of the bed and tried to will his cock into listening, though it was currently refusing to take the earbuds out.
Finally, Steve pulled out and stumbled back, chest heaving, cock jutting out between his thighs, slick and deep red with need. His jaw ground together. He wiped the sweat off his brow and dropped his chin to his chest, eyes shut. Behind his lids, he could see it happening. He could see it happening, just like when he watched it in person, and he was still useless. Useless out there, useless in here, but all he had to do was listen to Steve. Just
“This is Pepper Potts, Mr. Stark’s personal assistant,” she told him.  The name, unusual as it was, sounded vaguely familiar to Steve. He figured he probably picked it up by osmosis, the way he seemed to pick up most pop culture, then remembered Stark saying something to him last night about Pepper and art she made him buy.  When he was complimenting Steve’s artwork, that was apparently still up on the school’s website, which had been really nice--if slightly unnerving--of him.
“I know you’re humoring me,” Tony told him.  “Or, you’re telling yourself that’s what you’re doing, anyway.  Humor me for a few days, and this will all go away.  I’ll come to my senses or whatever.  Jaunt back to my merry life at the Tower.”
“Confirmed,” she said. The line went dead. That was it, then. He would go. He would go and… and deal with everything else tomorrow. He smiled a soft, half-smile, shaking his head a bit in amazement. The man said yes. He wanted to come back and… do that again. With Steve. It felt good. Like he had the stranger’s approval somehow, and just the certainty of it, knowing who waited for him, knowing the person wanted him like that, God, that was nice. Being wanted. Needed. Even when he probably deserved it, and if the man–but, he didn’t. He didn’t know. He didn’t know anything. Steve was just a cock using the man’s ass, and that was good enough for whatever the stranger was getting out of it. A surge of heat pooled low in his belly, and he stroked a hand down his chest, closing his eyes. Yeah. That would be okay. Better than okay. He needed to not be in his head for a bit.
Tony breathed out a deep, husky sigh, then brought a hand up to cup the back of Steve’s neck, fingers rubbing lightly over the skin there. Steve let his mouth work a path up the line of Tony’s throat and across his jaw until he found Tony’s mouth, then trailed the tip of his tongue over Tony’s bottom lip, capturing the shaky breath that escaped Tony’s lips as he did. He opened his mouth over Tony’s and bringing one hand up to angle Tony’s head, keeping the other curled around Tony’s hip. He pressed them forward on shuffling feet, easing Tony back towards the large bed at the center of his room until the back of Tony’s thighs touched the mattress.
Sam and Barnes traded another look, eyebrows raised, while the two clowns who caused this mess huddled together, looking wide-eyed at Tony.  Okay, so it was technically the Wordscapes app, but Tony figured the two giant liars who lie couldn’t actually complain.  He looked between them, thumb hovering over the button.
Tony was standing at the bar, a tumbler of something forgotten midway to his mouth, eyes glazed and dark, mouth hanging slack, watching Steve with an expression that Steve could have sworn was filled with longing.
“Movie sounds great,” Tony replied, which seemed to make Steve’s posture soften, like he’d been holding his breath, which was silly, but, made that happy, warm thing start spreading through Tony’s chest again.  Damn thing couldn’t keep still once it got a chance, Tony thought, trying for frustration, but coming up short.  Intellectually, he knew his brain kept releasing happiness in the form of endorphins when he pleased his Alpha.  The carrot in favor of the stick, he thought derisively.  It still felt good, and that was in too short a supply to worry about the why of it.  “We could stick with our space theme.  You said you haven’t seen many movies, right?  You’ve seen, like, the new Star Wars, though, right?” Tony asked.
“He wakes!” the King announced.  “I thought perhaps you would sleep the day away, and took this as proof of my incredible prowess, which is, I am sure, a completely valid assumption,” the King continued, eyes twinkling with mirth.   “Agree with me,” the King commanded with a jaunty grin.
“Ah, no,” Steve breathed out with a slight wince, though the look he shot Tony was full of almost grateful understanding.  “History.  Art’s a little tricky these days.”
“I have a pack of gum in my room.  I’ll donate to the cause,” Tony offered with a grin. That got a surprised, delighted-sounding laugh from Steve, a real one, probably the first time he’d heard laughter that didn’t sound like it came from one of those studio laughtracks in years.  It seemed to almost startle Steve as much as him.  That warm, pleasant tingle was filling Tony’s chest again, pricking at the backs of his eyes and making his throat tighten.  It was annoying as fuck.  That wasn’t true, but he wanted it to be true.  Needed it to be true.  He couldn’t let himself want something like that to continue, not something that was dependent on how Steve felt about him.  One-way ticket to Disappointmentville, please and thank you.  Just no.  Stop it, he told himself.  Himself was still being an asshat about the listening, though.
“All that stuff when he was a kid, and he couldn’t do shit, then he grows out of most of it.  Now, he’s back where he started, see?  Body that won’t work right. Won’t let him do what he wants.  Gets in his head, sometimes,” Barnes continued, tone going almost pleading.  “So, don’t coddle him about it. But, you gotta kinda figure out where it’s an issue for him and work around it.  Repetitive motion’s bad for the nerves and tendons, so don’t ask him to do more than he has to, because the stubborn ass won’t say no.  Back goes wonky sometimes, like for no reason.  I don’t know.  He doesn’t know.  Just happens.  He’s had three surgeries on it, and each time, they say he’s gonna be fine, but then the VA, they only pay for so much physical therapy, and meanwhile, he’s got to go back to work, so.  But, God forbid you suggest he slow it down a little, you know? That’s not Steve, so don’t even bother.  Just gets all full a’piss about it, trust me.”
“I sincerely hope so.  You, out,” Tony told Steve’s neighbor, who was still standing there with a pillow case that seemed to hold half a liquor store.  He pointed and jerked his head towards the stairs, widening his eyes insistently.  “Go.  Now. Bye.”
That could be enough.  He should be happy with that.  It was more than he’d ever thought he would have, this lack of being a disappointment, this absence of constant worry about every, little thing he did or said.  Let alone the fact that Steve actually seemed to rather enjoy his presence.  Coulson even thought Steve was doing better since their Bonding.  That had to count for something to Steve.
His eyes stung, so he closed them.  Took a deep, bracing breath and put the parchment back down on the table.  As he turned to go, his foot caught on one of the miniature figures that had been a casualty of the King’s frustration.  He bent down and picked it up, putting it back in its place on the map.  Then moved the other pieces back where they belonged.  When he was done, he gave the table one last, admiring look, then turned and walked to the door, past the silent guards who he had forgotten were there, who opened the door and let him out into the hallway.
“I don’t know if it’s being around you 24/7 or what, maybe you’re rubbing off on me,” Rhodey started, lowering the binoculars, “Eh!  You can let one go, Tony, it’s okay,” he interjected quickly as Tony opened his mouth with a shit-eating grin, then scowled at Rhodey and slumped back on the chair, “But even I have to give a
“Nevermind for now. I'll get Pepper on it. Point is, he loves me, like, really loves me, Rhodes, and I'm crazy about him, but we knew that. One, tiny problem. He currently thinks we don't belong together, and is being stubborn about the whole thing. Shocking behavior from Steve Rogers, I know, but there you go. I'm working on it,” Tony added, giving Steve a wide grin.
“I—I know, its not really a—a typical hobby for an Omega,” Tony ground out, suddenly wishing he'd never said anything, because Steve was laughing at him, of course, he was. What kind of Omega builds robots and plots out missile guidance systems in their spare time? The answer was no kind. No kind, because there wasn't a kind for that, because they didn't fucking exist, except for him, him and his stupid, ridiculous ideas that were never going to amount to anything.
“Don’t know about that. Got the shit kicked out of me a lot,” Steve admitted.  “That time, let’s see…fat lip.  Bloody nose.  The works. Bucky—he kind of saved me.   Happened a lot, actually.  Hip pulling me out of trouble. We’ve sort of known each other forever.  Buck says I woke him up coughing in the hospital nursery. Says he’s been hollering at me ever since.  That’s not--he’s actually a little over a year older, not that it—I mean.  Anyway.  He showed up.  Gave the guy a what-for.   I used to think he had some sixth sense for when I was in trouble, but he swears it was just pretty much going to be a given, so law of probabilities and all that.  Got into a lot of fights,” Steve explained with a grimace and another shrug that was trying for nonchalant and failing spectacularly.
“Safe to say, astronauts and low gravity have nothing on you,” Tony grinned, flipping up the faceplate as he landed next to his telescope.
“How am I? I’m not great, Tony.  Not great at all.  What in the world is going on?” Pepper asked, her voice calming slightly now that Tony had finally managed a reply, nonsensical as it was.  “Why is Fury freaking out?  What is this about some Captain?”
it the few times he tried, that was for sure, but Tony didn’t seem to mind.  At least he didn’t say anything about it or tell Steve to hush with that kind of thing.
Pizza.  Not stew.  Pizza.  Pizza was a dinner food.  Pizza was the perfect dinner food. The kind that if it was fucked up, it was definitely not going to be Tony’s fault.  So, you know, checked all the boxes on Tony’s perfect food list.
—I guess not, no.  But…you can’t—you—that just.  It doesn’t make sense.  None of this—how—why?” Tony stammered, almost a plea, trying to gulp air around the words because he’d forgotten how to breathe normally.  “You should…you should really be resting or, like, something.  Shouldn’t—shouldn’t you?”
“Bucky, your childhood friend and now roommate,” Tony said with a nod, as if just remembering the name.  “So nice of him to share his things,” Tony said slowly, forming each word carefully while he stared at Steve.
“When were these taken?” Steve asked with a frown.  He reached out and plucked the photo from her hand, gazing down at it.
Steve gave a low chuckle, then on impulse, leaned down and kissed Tony full on the mouth, deep and wet, full of heat and promise, nothing like the kiss Tony had given him.
chance, really, it’s…” Tony broke off, feeling his jaw tighten against a sudden swell of emotion.  “I just...I hope I didn’t waste it. I hope, what I left behind, I hope it--I hope it’s
He didn’t mind, not really.  Well, not exactly, anyway.  He wasn’t sure what it made him feel, except that he knew he should probably have put a stop to it a long time ago, but hadn’t for some vague reasons that never quite held up to scrutiny.  He wasn’t sure how to explain it, except that it wasn’t like he didn’t get the jokes.  He’d been in the Army, after all, where long stretches of time with nothing to do usually meant conversations about food or fucking or both.  There was something about the way Tony teased him though that always left him feeling like the kid who needs to have the joke explained to him though he was laughing along, trying to pretend he understood.
His whole body shook with it as he slammed into Tony a few, final strokes, emptying himself completely, his body, his soul, everything pouring into Tony for a moment before looping back to him. It was all almost too much, his vision going dark but bright at the same time, and he understood for the first time what was meant by blinding light.  He could feel every shudder like a quake, every clench of Tony around him was a vice, every huff of breath a whirlwind.  Steve fell forward, only reflexes born of too many years of combat training catching him before he landed full-force on top of Tony’s chest.
“That him again?” Bucky asked, nodding down at Steve’s phone where it sat on the cheerful little dining table next to a vase of daisies.
pity.  Guilt. Whatever you want to call it. The money, sure.  This whole righteous quest you two want to have at the VA? Guilt 101, man, I get it. You?  Whatever that is for Stark, it isn’t guilt, Steve.  Alright, fine.  Don’t give me that look. It’s not
Cam was waiting.  Steve stood there for a long moment.  He closed his eyes and tilted his head all the way back, then opened them and looked at the ceiling.  He honestly had no idea what to feel.  Bewilderment.  Frustration Amazement. Anger.  Amusement.  It all warred at once inside his head.
“He’s hovering,” Tony said, swiveling his head to glance through the balcony windows where Steve was standing behind the sofa where Barnes lounged, looking for the world like a man who had no idea what to do with himself when there wasn’t a crisis.  “Barnes said he paints.  He mentioned that, sort of.  That he’d almost gone to art school.  Pepper’s having some art crap sent over.  Give him something to do, I don’t know.”
“Bucky,” Steve said suddenly.  “Bucky, I told you, I know, but Tony, it wasn’t him, not really.  It was what they did to him, but—”
“I know.  I like it,” Kirk replied and nudged his nose against Steve’s, finding Steve’s mouth again.
“Alright, alright,” Tony said, holding up his hands in surrender.  “Shall we?” he said to Steve. Steve nodded and stood up, heading for his room and managing to only look over his shoulder once, catching Tony doing the same, his eyes going wide with surprise at being caught. Steve gave him an awkward little wave that Tony returned with a lopsided, deprecating smile.  He heard Bucky snort and found himself grinning as he shut the door to his room behind him.
He could still get a courier or process server to do this.  Someone from the lawyer’s office who they trusted to be discreet.  Except he’d told Pepper he would do it, that was no big deal, a good exercise in putting the past behind him where it belonged.  Backing out now would make this mean something more than it should, which was a line he couldn’t let himself cross.  It had the feeling of an admission to it, one he didn’t want to make, even to Pepper, who wouldn’t judge him for it.   Whatever justifications he managed to give himself—that he was too busy, the work he was doing too important—truths, as far as they went, they didn’t quite go far enough to erase the implication needling in the back of his head.
Steve caught Tony’s eyes just at the edge of his gaze. Held it. Watched as his eyes darkened in the lamplight to little more than obsidian orbs. His own vision clouded. His jaw ached. The pain in his nipple was agonizing, but he willingly offered it to Tony. Pressure built in his cock, riding on endless waves that battered against the head, demanding a release that wasn’t his to allow.
Steve’s head shot up in surprise.  The King wasn’t looking at him, still peering over his papers, though now with a large book open on the table in front of him.  Not forgotten, then, Steve though.  He looked down, then slowly undid the knot on the front of the loincloth and let it fall away, leaving him naked, save for the bands of metal that circled his cock and balls and the collar that rested around his throat.  He dropped his hands to his sides and glanced up.  The King was reaching for another book from the shelf behind him, seemingly absorbed in whatever he was doing.  Then, so fast that Steve almost missed it, the King’s gaze flicked over to Steve, before going back to the book he started leafing through.  Steve felt a sharp tug, low in his belly, just behind his cock and a sudden pooling of warmth there.  He shifted his knees.  The King’s lips twitched, just the barest of movements, though he didn’t take his eyes off the books and papers in front of him.
“It’s fine, Clint, but thanks for the offer,” Steve replied, because he was always thinking of others like that.   “We’ll be leaving for the island tomorrow, so hopefully things will get back to normal around here pretty quickly.  Alright, Tony, vaporizing this mess actually isn’t a bad idea, however much it might have been completely and totally made up on the spot.”
.  This thing when they were together that made everything lighter, easier, where he felt like he could do anything, where he almost believed this wasn’t all a façade, because Steve believed it was real.
“Is that what we’re doing?  The best we can?” Steve barked at her, then slammed his mouth shut into a thin line.  “Sorry.  I didn’t mean—it isn’t you.”
“I do,” Steve agreed, waggling his eyebrows a bit.  He dipped his head again for another kiss, this time trailing off down Tony’s neck to the sensitive spot just behind his ear.  Tony sighed against Steve’s cheek and wound his arms around Steve’s neck. Steve’s mouth worked its way down Tony’s throat, laving at the dip at the base, then down his chest, careful to avoid the reactor, as Tony had asked.  He took a pert nipple into his mouth and teased at it with his tongue and teeth, nipping and sucking until Tony groaned and arched his back, pressing the tip further into Steve’s mouth.
He knocked on the door between his chamber and Tony’s and heard Tony call out for him to enter.  As he walked, he could feel the chains sliding across his nipples and cock, and he swallowed hard, throat clicking and a soft moan escaping.   Tony glanced over at him with an interested, considering look that traveled up and down Steve’s body.
“Wait—Steve—“ Tony stammered, eyes widening as one doctor pulled the sheaths of skin together over the end of the wound that bisected Steve’s chest while the other pulled out what looked to Tony like the medical version of a bedazzler.
“What are you even talking about?” Tony demanded exasperatedly, turning away from the coffee machine while it apparently individually ground each and every bean.
“Wow,” Rogers replied after a long beat, watching Tony toy with the bottle cap on the tabletop in front of him.  “That must’ve hurt to get out.”  Rogers gave a huff of amusement and sat back in his chair, studying Tony with a sudden intensity that made Tony feel like he should be tied to a chair with his eyeballs pried open.
“Hey!  Hello!” Tony called out again.  “Someone wanna---someone wanna tell me what the hell is going on!?!  Hello! Anyone out there? I’m kind of--I could use a bit of a--
“I know you said you were happy here, but…” Steve said after a while.  Anto frowned. That hadn’t been exactly a lie or exactly the truth. He didn’t know what the word for that was.  “That man back there—is he your Alpha?” Steve asked.
Steve’s hand delved between Tony’s legs and dipped in the slick that still clung to his bottom and thighs, then found Tony’s cock, wrapping his hand around it, the leather soaked through with Tony’s slick, and God, okay, yes, it was fucking hot as hell that this had been
“Well…” Ms. Romanov began, and Steve noted that her voice sounded a bit strange.  “The thing is…the thing is Steve…Tony Stark.”
“Says the man who forgets to eat anything not hand-picked by Juan Valdez when he gets an idea in his head,” Steve rejoined, returning Tony's grin in earnest before that, too, slipped away. “I—I appreciate that, Tony. Really. I—I can't stay, though. I would. Ah. But. Got a doctor's appointment. Kind of a last minute thing, actually. That—that hand doc? His office called and said there was an opening, so they worked me in, so,” Steve replied with a small shrug, though Tony caught the way Steve's fingers thrummed across the folder in reflex.
He should’ve just kept his fucking mouth shut instead of blurting it out like that, though, enjoyed what he’d been given for however long he got to have this and shut the hell up about it. But the question had been gnawing its way through everything between them, tainting each touch, each word, as it dug out more and more space for itself. Doubt becomes distance, a self-fulfilling cycle that Tony couldn’t seem to stop no matter how many times he told himself not to hang on this tightly to someone who wasn’t his.
reference.  He almost couldn’t believe Stone was making it, but there was a brash confidence about Stone that probably came from years of not being denied much of anything, whether by his looks or his charm or his…skills, and now his wealth, courtesy of Tony.  “It would pain me to think that you had forgotten, when I know what pleasure it once gave you. I have missed being able to share it with you, my King.”
Maybe Steve was tired. Whatever it was he did for Shield, it was probably...tiring. Seemed...logical enough to be a plausible answer for why Tony wasn't currently becoming a calmer, more relaxed, better person.
Steve held his tongue.  He wasn’t sure what he could say. Sometimes, he thought.  Sometimes, I think that.  An answer, but not the one the King wanted, Steve knew instinctively.  The King’s expression hooded for a moment, and he rubbed a hand up and down his face, shaking his head as if to clear it.
“I mean with you,” Obie interrupted.  He took another drink, then set the glass down on top of one of the magazines that were displayed on the coffee table.  It was the Forces, with Tony and Obie on the cover, Tony noted.  “Lots of changes.  Hear you’re slumming in the Brooklyn real estate market nowadays.  Once upon a time, I couldn’t drag you out of that workshop of yours, and now, apparently, you don’t even live here anymore.  Not that I can blame you.  Who hasn’t gone back for seconds a time or two?”
“Clever,” Stane nodded.  “Of course, you would be. You wouldn’t have held his interest this long if you weren’t.  You were supposed to be a distraction, you know?” Stane reminded him, almost with a note of begrudging respect.  “A few nights, to get him out of his head, and then he could go back to doing what he does best, but you…you’re different.  I underestimated you.  I’ll grant you that,” he admitted, wagging a finger in Steve’s direction.
“As am I,” Tony breathed out, pulling Steve’s head down for another kiss, harder and deeper, full of promise and longing. They took their time with each other this time, unhurried touches exploring each other anew. Steve ran his hands up and down Tony’s chest, locking his arms around Tony’s back and pulling him on top of him. He liked the feel of Tony spread out over him, all warm skin and hard lines.   Steve kissed a long line down Tony’s neck and shoulder as Tony groaned and dipped his head to find Steve’s mouth again, the kiss turning hot as Tony melted against him. He wasn’t sure how long they went on like that, but by the time he moved Tony to his back and settled between his legs, Tony’s eyes were dark orbs, his skin flushed and damp, hair in disarray from Steve’s hands and every word half a gasp.
, he thought with a shake of his head, eyes darting down to his feet, suddenly glad he was wearing black pants.
Tony sat the bottle back on the bar with a loud thump, the sound echoing through the darkened room too loudly in the quiet. You needed quiet for this, he thought. Noise somehow made this whole thing all the more pathetic. He’d mentally agreed when he placed Pepper’s hand in Happy’s, the two of them beaming at each other, to give himself this night, one night. Hell, not even—fuck, what time was it? Not even a night. A few hours. Then he would go back to reminding himself that he was Tony Stark and none of this had ever mattered. It hadn’t stopped him from getting out of that cave, and it hadn’t stopped him from becoming Iron Man.
“--and I’m with Matt. Except about the test thing, because I’m not twelve,” Pepper said, giving Matt a withering look before sucking in a bracing breath.  “So.  You and Steve got a little carried away last night.  That’s hardly the worst thing you’ve been caught on camera doing, Tony, come on.  It’s great publicity.  This is good, Tony.”
“So, the election’s coming up,” Steve began, picking up the edge of his newspaper in a not-so-subtle, topic-shifting crinkle of the page.  “Did you have any thoughts about it?”
Thank you to everyone who has been so patient and encouraging with this story.  This chapter was tough to write as we transition from Steve-before-Tony to Steve-and-Tony.  Just a couple of quick notes for those who might be interested:  one of Steve's preserum conditions is prenicious anemia, which was quite deadly and during the 20s & 30s, the only treatment was eating raw liver or a sort of raw liver shake, which sounds awful, so naturally, I had to incorporate that.  He also had scoliosis, a heart condition, and a number of other disabilities that would have made his life pretty miserable. I think we sometimes skip over how awful Steve had it.  Virginity tests, like the one Tony had, are still done in parts of the world today.  I thought it would be sort of interesting to talk a little about purity culture and how it presents a bit of a conflict for Steve who doesn't want Tony to be hurt or uncomfortable, and also has to admit to caring about that.  Part of Steve's journey is recognizing the ways he is a part of the system he and Tony eventually work together to tear down a bit.  Also just because putting value on sexual purity is gross and should be called out.
“Sure.  Stay,” she said finally, tossing a look at Barnes.  So, clearly, they had not told Wilson about any of this, and had no plans to spill the beans that Steve still had a ring on it.   Ah, subterfuge.  Always works out so well.
A rush of wetness leaked down the backs of his thighs.  Alpha, Anto thought, feeling his breath coming in quick, sharp pants.  It occurred to him that he wasn’t distressed by the idea of the man giving him his signal, not the way he always felt when Tyber signaled him, when his mind thrummed with fear and pain and cold, dark anger coiled deep inside him.  Other Omegas seemed to like it well enough, after all. And the man was like him. One of the Others. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt as much with his own kind.
“Thanks,” Steve managed to get in, though Tony was on a roll, so Steve wasn’t sure if he actually heard him or not.
Bruce padded into the room, stretching out the kinks in his back as he made for the coffee machine. He jarred to a stop, then looked up at Tony and slowly backed out of the room. “I’ll just be in the lab,” Bruce informed them.
“That true, boy?” Phillips asked.  Steve, who looked a bit like a deer in headlights, opened his mouth, then closed it and gave Tony a helpless look, trying to cover his laugh with his hand.  Phillips’ gaze finally settled on Tony, giving him a once over. “Good. ’Bout time. That seat’s taken,” Phillips said, turning around to stare at Barnes.
The man, Rhodes, paused and dropped his arms to his sides, brow drawing together into a frown before he shook his head.
Yes, Steve thought. He could do that.  It was dark.  There was nothing but Tony’s voice, murmuring soft words of praise as his hands stroked Steve’s skin.  At some point, a warm, wet cloth cleaned him off, swiping delicately over his chest and stomach and around his cock, then dabbing lightly at his rim and the seam of his ass where some of Tony’s seed had leaked out of him.  A goblet of water was placed to his lips.  He drank. Steve kept drifting.  Tony was there beside him.  Sometimes, he heard Tony murmuring to him or felt Tony’s fingers gently tracing his skin, as if drawing patterns there for only Tony to see.   Steve thought of the time he and Bucky sailed a leaf boat down a stream the rains had made, with the water rushing over the rocks and the wind pushing it over, over, over and on, until it emptied into the wide, still part of the river and then ambled on, bobbing gently at the edges where the reeds caught it.  Tony was here, in the reeds, Steve, thought nonsensically, though the thought pleased him nonetheless.
“Well, whatever it is, if you think it’s enough to send me packing, you’re insane,” Tony retorted as he hurried to catch up.   “You know---and I know this is going to sound crazy, I know. Bear with me,” Tony said, sucking in a deep breath.  “If we’d stop trying to throw ourselves under the proverbial bus for each other every chance we got and actually talk things through, we might get to, oh, I don’t know, maybe do some more traditional things to show how we feel about each other.  Long walks on the beach, flowers, romantic getaways, chocolate, the absence of debilitating pain and loneliness.  Or is that fifth anniversary stuff?  I can never remember.  I’d Google it, but…no Wi-Fi,” Tony finished throwing up his hands and shrugging.  “You know what I think?” Tony asked between breaths as he followed Steve up the remaining stairs.
Steve got up from the table and hurried across the street.  Stark Tower’s lobby was wide and light-filled, and Steve made his way to the large, crescent-shaped reception desk where he asked for an envelope.  He pulled out his wallet again and took out the check, unfolding it and staring once more at Tony’s signature.  A soft smile formed, something warm and bright coursing through Steve, and he huffed a bit in resigned acceptance as he committed the bold strokes to memory.  Flipping the check over, Steve plucked one of the pens from the holder on the counter and wrote a short note on the back, then shoved it into the envelope and handed it to the receptionist.
“Of course, right, you should—yeah,” Steve managed, putting his hands on his hips and looking down at his feet and then, by the look of it, the fascinating air conditioning vent above Tony’s head.  Great. Probably trying to keep from bursting out laughing, Tony figured.  “You.  You, ah.  You have,” Steve started, then tapped a finger along the side of his nose.
“Don’t think it quite works like that. Besides, I don’t want to have to pull a prosthetic arm out of your ass.
“You need to flip those,” Barnes told him, which was true, but Tony instantly didn’t want to do that.  “Steve doesn’t care about all your fancy shit.  He liked the computer because you made it, and he thinks anything you do is basically rocket science.”
“See? This is why I call you,” Tony said.  He closed his eyes, feeling the ebullience drain away as he lay there with Rhodey in his ear, not judging him and being all supporting and happy about Tony’s happiness. God, it was like a bucket of cold water.  Tony reached up and pinched the bridge of his nose between his fingers, letting out a long breath.  “We’re moving too fast.  I should focus on the thing with Obie. I still need to tell Steve about everything.  I’m getting way ahead of myself, because I found this amazing guy, who, wonder of wonders, likes me, too, and I’m fairly sure if I told him I wanted to walk away from this and live in a yurt and find myself or something, he’d help me milk our yak.  Terrible analogy. You get what I mean.  Talk me down.  Because I like him, Rhodey, I really do.  I’m—I’m falling for this guy, and if there’s an off-ramp, then I’m about to pass it, so.  So, now’s the time for any voice of reason you want to throw in here.”
“Exactly. Oh.  I fell in love with you, and I knew I had to tell you the truth.  And I was.  Had it all planned.  And then D.C. happened,” Steve said.
“Steve,” Tony breathed out in a long, thin keen. Steve shifted his head to the side, swirling his tongue around the dusky skin that circled Tony’s nipple, then sucked the nub into his mouth, grazing his teeth across it as Tony’s back bowed into an arch, his hands coming off the bedding long enough to wind into Steve’s hair, holding him there while Steve laved his tongue over and around the rigid peak. He released it, then moved to the other, giving it the same attention while he used his fingers to rub and pull at the one still wet from his mouth. Tony’s breaths were coming in short, sharp pants, like he couldn’t quite get enough air but couldn’t be bothered to actually breathe, and he was squirming under Steve, even less able to keep still now than usual, Steve thought with a small smile, mouth curving around Tony’s skin.
Steve startled at the series of commands, his stomach dropping and breath hitching, though he clung to Tony’s eyes, seeking something there.  “What did I tell you about punishment in here?” Tony asked.
Stark, the blind man Steve had figured out to be Stark’s attorney and the woman, Ms. Potts, were huddled in the penthouse suite’s living room, heads drawn together conspiratorially as they talked in low voices, punctuated by the occasionally outburst from Stark and sharp versions of “Tony!” from Ms. Potts, which seemed to function as anything from a stern ‘no’ to the equivalent of ‘you’re insane,’ as far as Steve could tell.
going to get along,” Tony announced with a bemused sort of smile.  “I like him so much,” Tony added, shaking his head and glancing over at Steve.
Steve looked around. Behind him, the road was empty.  He rubbed at his eyes, shaking his head again to try to clear the quiet fullness that seemed to fill his ears. It was just quiet.  He was being a baby, he mentally scolded himself.  Anyway, he should be glad he couldn’t hear anything.  That meant he was safe, at least for a few hours, though he supposed he would have to go home eventually.
“We’re heading out, too. Be good, boys,” Nat said, squeezing past where Steve leaned in the doorway.  “Honey, it was just George’s time.  Let it go.”
“Hon…you’re fired.  You’re like…so incredibly fired.  Fired, fired, fired,” Tony said, shaking his head in mock sadness.  “I can get hundreds of painters.  There’s only one you.  And if you think I’m letting you go back to work after that…”
A tremor ran through Steve at the realization that Tony suffered the same confusing feelings about the dreams that haunted him.  Flashes of memory stalked his mind, more clear now than they had ever been in the harsh light of day.  Tony’s hands on him. Strong, like steel bands, holding him down. Tony’s mouth. His teeth, sharp and hard, but almost painless. Tony slipping inside him in all the ways only he could.  The dizzying rush of blood leaving him, pulsing into the wet heat of Tony’s mouth. His cock spilling as Tony sucked the life out of him.
She gave her life so that others might live, Tony had said solemnly, plucking the frame from Steve’s hand and staring fondly down at the image.  Used some of the parts to build DUM-E. He still thinks Lotus is basically flirting.
“Because you feel very vulnerable right now and don’t want to look too hard at why that is, and so you lash out at  yourself to deflect something  you’re expecting from someone else,” Tony said, matter-of-factly, then grimaced ruefully. “I’m something of an expert at that trick.”
Tony was smiling at him though, a pleased, sort of satisfied grin that widened as he approached.  “I see you found breakfast to your liking,” Tony said as he made a much smaller plate for himself and grabbed the coffee, clutching the metal carafe in the crook of his arm like a beloved teddy bear.
Tony’s looked at her, then, dragging his eyes from the floor, face tear-streaked and utterly miserable, like he wanted to be anywhere in the world but stuck here in the kitchen of a place he loved, facing a jury of family and strangers with the question already answered on his face.  Steve felt it like a physical blow, sending all the air out of his lungs and making his whole body go rigid.  If he could have moved, he wasn’t sure what he might have done in that moment.  Stop the movie.  Crush the screen until there were just pieces of it left.  Throw it across the room.  Call Tony, just to hear him.  Even if it was terrible, even if it was all the hatred and anger that this Tony couldn’t muster, it would still be better than bearing witness to any more of this, but none of that anger, none of that need, none of it really belonged to him, did it?  Not anymore.
Shit, his mind blared.  How many times had they hit him with those darts?  What kind of concoction was in those things anyway?  Enough to overdose someone?  Tony tried to roll and managed to make it to his back, so his hands were underneath him. He tried to scoot his hands out of the plastic bindings to no avail.  His phone was gone from his pocket.  Damn.  That would’ve been too easy.  He had to think. Quickly.  Steve. Steve, the perfectly nice guy who draws Iron Man and likes Men in Tights, who was now probably in a ditch somewhere, if he was even alive.  Tony shook his head.  No.  He wasn’t going to think that.  Steve needed help.  He needed Tony to escape and get 911 or Cho or
Tony looked up and down the rows of passengers, who looked like walking ads for Starbucks, then back at Steve.
He liked it when Steve looked at him like that.  It shouldn’t be a revelation, but it had the uncertain, bewildered feeling that said it was.  When was the last time he’d liked the way someone looked at him?  He could catalogue a host of looks over the years.  Knew what they all meant.  Disappointment.  Dismay.  Anger.  Irritation.  Annoyance. Aggravation.  Disapproval.   A bit like the less musically-inclined, more vindictively pugilistic Seven Dwarves.
Steve hummed, a happy, satisfied sort of noise, and nudged his nose at Tony’s jaw until Tony turned his head for a kiss, this one almost sweet compared to the earlier ones that left his lips swollen and bruised, but Steve was always like some kind of big puppy who just played the best game of fetch ever after one of these kinds of welcome back sessions.  Tony sighed and wound his hands around Steve’s head, carding his fingers through Steve’s hair.  It was spiky with sweat in places, and Tony wasn’t exactly helping much with the situation, but it seemed to soothe Steve, who kept pressing feather-light kisses to Tony’s shoulder and neck, over the spot that bore his mark, almost like an apology.  Not that Steve was actually sorry in the slightest, not really, Tony knew.  He liked making the marks almost as much as Tony liked wearing them.  Steve sucked against the bite, tongue laving over the depressions where his teeth had been, and Tony moaned, arching his neck, feeling Steve’s knot start to expand deep inside him.
Tony looked at him a long moment, then reached up and cupped his hands on either side of Steve’s jaw.  Steve couldn’t help but lean in, seeking the warmth and pressure, the solidity that Tony always provided.
Tony hit the button to call the elevator and waited, watching the arrow hand above the doors slowly crawl down to the lobby level.  A woman came to stand next to him.  He didn’t turn to look at her, but could hear her heels clicking on the tile as she approached, standing just a tad too close to him, clutching a tablet in front of her, occasionally hitting a button on the screen as they waited.
Steve walked over to stand in front of Tony, his hands going to circle Tony’s waist, thumbs dipping below the waistband of Tony’s trousers to brush against the warm skin there.  Tony’s hands darted out, fluttering over Steve’s stomach, heat and pressure coiling and settling there only to seem to snake out to every part of him that Tony touched.  He was already half-hard, cock jerking forward like it was searching for Tony’s hand.
