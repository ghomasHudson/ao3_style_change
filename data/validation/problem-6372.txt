“It has been a process” Peter told Abeer, smiling gently at her “. But, you know, I’d been trained for years to step in so when it happened it felt natural. Still, I am aware I have big shoes to fill, and I am incredibly grateful for my amazing Team and my Amazing Family, who help me fully embrace this role I have acquired. The Avengers Team lost a few of its most powerful members, but don’t worry… we have a strong team, and we have plans”
, had been proving all on his own how much of a fraud he truly was. Sure, his decision to quit had made things easier, but also a bit harder, because now how were they gonna attack him when he wasn’t Spider-Man? But didn’t matter, not really… not when, in the end, they were gonna win.
“They barely managed” Natasha told him, crossing her legs elegantly one over the other. Peter was glad to have her Aunt with him… ever since he’d been officially named the leader of the Avengers Natasha had been there to help him out, guiding him when she deemed necessary and letting Peter take risks and chances when she believed was good for everyone. So far it had been working, but Peter was
So... I've decided to hop on the train of 'S.I Field Trips' stories... I've been asked to do one of these for a while, but I've always been hesitant to do so, because, as much as I love them, they can be quite cliché... so let's hope this doesn't feel like one big cliché haha. Enjoy!
“Of course it doesn’t,” May said, agreeing with the father of her nephew “, but we are living something that is quite the opposite of easy, Steve. Tony, Steve, right now Peter is broken, and in more ways than physical. We
Once he made it to his place, Peter went directly to his bathroom, stripping down and getting under the shower, finding some calmness in the cascade of water, almost too hot to be good for his skin and yet perfect for the tired superhero. Fact was- he knew he’d done a good job, that he had made a good speech but… that’d been out of practice, of reciting it over and over and over to the point Peter was pretty sure all of his family had known it just as well as he’d done it. Those words, albeit written by Peter (and supervised by Pepper and his parents) were delicately constructed, crafted in a way that was meant to be believable and to show Peter had, always, been in control.
“A few years” Bucky confessed after a beat of silence “. HYDRA messed me up quite a lot, after all, and it was quite the struggle to get that off my system. Things started really looking up after Nat and I found you, you know? It gave me another sense of purpose, I guess… but it was years, kiddo. And still… some days are worse than others, you know that”
I'm still travelling, so I'm not writing as much as before, but I'm working hard to get the story where I want it in time...
“You made a bet out of this?” Peter asked, opening his mouth in shock and looking as Harley and Flash gave two twenties to MJ, who was smiling sheepishly. Ned scoffed at them, too, gaining Peter’s attention back.
I know some of you wanted Peter to go back with his Dads asap, but it's not going to be like that, sorry.
I hope you enjoyed the chapter... what's coming next is some of my favorite stuff in this whole series, so be prepared.
So this is a fourth part of the first story I posted. Someone asked me to do a scene in where Peter tells his family about the building crushing on him. Because someone also asked me to write a scene in where they meet MJ, I also put it here. It's shorter than the other caps, but fun! (and fluff!)
Next one is going to be a much shorter one shot, an extra part of the first story I've published, something a reader asked me to write! Hope is up in the next one, or the following one. I'm going into the end of the academic year and I have so much projects and tests... so it's harder to write. I use it to distract myself, though.
PLEASE tell me what you thought of this chapter and even of this story! As always, leave also kudos if you want/can. And... thank you again, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for reading (and see you on the sequel!)
So a few weeks back I suddenly felt like it was time to come back to this. I revisited the whole thing, read everything since the first work (and omg, the evolution of the story and even my writing... I almost got whiplash lmao), and then I restructured the last two chapters. The penultimate not that much, the last one is completely new... I'll explain the changes once I publish it, if I do it now I feel like it'd be spoilers. And after this finishes... I am planning another Marvel story, although I want to take my time to write it and be happy with it. In the meantime, I'll try to write shorter stories... and possibly a small addition to this one. But no promises.
PLEASE make sure to leave a comment and tell me what you thought of the chapter and what you think of the story so far!
“Harry, I just want to stop this” he say, not even caring to deny he was begging. But hey, if they could get easy on it, Peter wasn’t exactly complaining. He wanted justice, and to make Harry pay for his crimes, but he didn’t want to hurt him, not him “. This isn’t you, this never was you - you’re different, you are better than this”
“Well… the next step is still going to be kept under wraps,” Peter said, much to the disappointment of the audience “. However, I can say that I’m working with an excellent team that will bring excellence to Stark Industries. I’ve had the pleasure of working with them and having them in my life as some of my closest friends, so I’m delighted to form this team with Ned Leeds, Harley Keener, and Flash Thompson. They truly are brilliant, so I’m incredibly excited about S.I’s future”
Anyway, enjoy the chapter! Also, BIG news: I'm gonna do a third and last installment to this series (other than the one-shots and short-stories work). On the next chapter, I'll tell you guys the synopsis.
Hi! So, I really hope you guys enjoyed this chapter. I ended it with a bit of a cliffhanger, but not that big haha.
“Glad to be here” Peter answered, smiling charmingly at her. Abeer smiled back, aware of how many people in the audience were just
I can say that Bucky will play a key role in this whole story, so look forward to him! Idk how many more chapters I'll do about this, probably one, two... max three, I think. We'll see
“Which is a good thing” Tony reminded his clone “. Kid, after everything you’ve been through… after everything we, as a family, have been through… a bit of quiet time is never a bad thing”
“Time has flown by so incredibly fast, hasn’t it?” The blond smiled, hugging Tony tighter “. And it hasn’t always been easy, we know that for sure, but it’s been worth it. Nothing I’ve ever done has been as worthy as this”
“You’re broken” Flash finished for him, not ungently “. But that’s fine, dude. We’re all a little broken, aren’t we?”
[TW: SERIOUS TOPIC] I don't know how many of you are aware of what's going on in the States right now, but I am assuming (and also hoping) a large fair amount of you are informed of what has been going on. Personally, I do not live in the States (nor America), nor am I black. I do, however, have members of my family who are black. Regardless of that, defending Black Lives should not be something this controversial. BLACK. LIVES. MATTER. Period. There is NO discussion to that, and I mean fucking *zero* discussion to that. It is not an ideology, it's human decency, and human rights. It's unbelievable we still have to protest this, it's crazy there are people still defending otherwise. Let me tell you: you are not better because you are white. You are no better because of the fucking color of your skin, and if you do believe that, educate yourself. I do believe we have to educate ourselves way more (me included, you can ALWAYS educate yourself one step further), and that racism is something taught, and a pandemic in itself.
Cho went back into the room when the clock was dangerously close to ten a.m and all the occupants of it were already awake, anxious for having to wait that long for any type of news. The Doctor didn’t seem surprised at the number of people who were there, clearly already used to see them wait for one of their own to be declared healthy, or at least stable. She chose to look at Steve and Tony, waiting for them to stand up and get closer to her before opening her mouth.
I hope you liked the chapter. We get to see more of Peter's world and friendships, and his pov of the whole situation... Tony and Steve are still out of his life, but they're going to be informed of everything, and he has his Uncle Bucky
“You mean having a panic attack?” Steve asked, frowning at just the thought of his son suffering even more. Cho shrugged, not completely sure of it, yet fearing it’d be true.
“Thank you, Peter” Steve said, smiling. His Dad was next to him, copying his husband’s expression, and for a brief moment Peter drank in the peaceful atmosphere, let himself breathe deeply and feel content “. It’s good to see you relaxed as well” his Papa pointed out then “. Nat called me this morning, told me things in New York are a bit hectic as of now”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea” Sam declared, smiling to Peter “. We can’t name someone an Avenger if they don’t have training, or experience, but to have a young version of them… it does sound promising”
So, a new chapter is here! And, this one starts a new arc of it, one I'm really excited about. To all the people asking me about Peter, this chapter will give you answers.
I've read a lot of comments (in this chapter and in the one that ended with the cliffhanger of Peter being attacked) and a lot of you think he will get really hurt and his Dads will find out about all of this that way... well, let's see if that actually happens. Btw, I'll be on a trip this Saturday, so the chances of posting are slim... next Wednesday you guys will have one without a doubt, but I don't know about Saturday just yet.
“What are you doing here?” Green Goblin asked then, not even trying to keep his cool. And it was normal, the genius decided - Harry had thrown himself into being a villain to try to revenge his father, had done so through the power his family still had, to connections and force of will. But, and Peter had known Harry, so he
“Right” Michelle murmured “. It felt bad accepting to do the article, too, if that makes you feel better… I thought, just for a moment, I was being asked to write it just because we’d been together at one point and everyone knows we’re still close. And you know, Peter, I’m not an idiot… I know that influenced my boss’s decision to give me the article, if anything because people would click the article if they saw Spider-Man’s ex had written it. I know that. But I also know this is what I’m here for, and I know I’ve worked incredibly hard to have opportunities like this. And I’m going to keep working as hard, and accepting articles I feel I deserve because just like you, I want to be the person I’m destined to be. And if that means… if that means writing things about you, then I’ll have to do it. At least until I can refuse and write about something else instead”
“You had your Aunt” Tony interrupted him once more, again not ungently “. And Ned, and even Michelle. They all knew you when you were a kid… you met Ned before your parents were gone, didn’t you?”
We will be leaving the Titan group for a few chapters, but I'm really excited for the next ones! I really like them... and Bucky's coming! Yay!
I actually don't know when I'm going to see it. I know I have it kind of hard this weekend because I have to study way too much, but idk. Also, I can't go to any cinema, because I want to watch in it's original version, not the one my country is showing in every cinema. The voiceover is awful, and so is the translate they do of the dialogues. I hate it, and I hate I still have to wait to see it, which is ironic, because I don't want to see it, either. I want all of my faves to be alive, thank you so much. Also, I feel like I'm not emotionally prepared for the movie.
Now, I am aware most people would have abandoned this story, and I am in no way blaming them, because it has been a long while. But, if you are reading it (and if you've read this too, in which case: thanks, and congrats), then I really hope you enjoy the chapter.
The next chapter is here! It'll be a lot like the movie because I really liked the scene, but I can assure the next chapter will change a few things and start to be a little different than the version you guys know. Anyway, enjoy!
“No, they don’t know yet,” Steve said, excusing them “. Buck says things are more complicated than they’d expected… although, he did tell me they didn’t need help from the other Avengers just yet, so don’t worry about it”
“Well, I don’t think she’s done with it, no” Peter replied, a soft smile never leaving his face “. Shuri and I will keep working together, we love it too much to just drop it… but, you know, given the circumstances she had to move back to Wakanda as her people truly need her right now, and, along with being a genius, one of the most gifted I’ve had the pleasure to work with actually, she’s also a dedicated Princess to her people. Now they need her, and the fact is that she has spent some years here in the States, so we both know it’s time she goes back. But she’s not done with S.I, no, or this wing. She will keep being a collaborator, no intention of changing that”
“It made me upset” he finally said, putting his hand up to stop his ex-girlfriend from interrupting him “. I realized this is not something you intended to, MJ, and I know this is your job, just like you understood I had to pull this stunt in order to stop Harry” Michelle nodded to his words, calming down a bit. It wasn’t much as she was feeling defensive, but more like the need to make Peter understand she had meant no harm “. But I still felt bad about it, okay? Just… try to put it into perspective, try to turn things around. Imagine if you were the superhero and I the journalist, just… try to”
Hey! So, this is kind of a short story. I don't know how many chapters it'd be. I have them all written (when I'm stressed I write, and believe when I say I'm way too stressed right now), but I don't know how I'm going to divide it. Anyways, a few remarks:
Friendly reminder, also, to say I hope you are all safe and in your homes! times are hard, but we can do this!
of insisting, Peter had been fed up. His Uncle Bucky had laughed at him when he’d told him, telling him how unlucky he’d been to inherit his Papa’s non-existent patience, but Peter had ignored him altogether. Especially because he was
So, I'm sorry for not posting on Wednesday. To be honest, the chapter was almost done then, but I wasn't in the right mind space. Long story short, I had four dogs - one that's really old, a dog that was not a puppy yet still young, and two puppies (who are kind of 'twins'). On Monday morning, one of my dogs (the one who was five) unexpectedly died. She was a healthy dog, had had an epilepsy problem when she was younger, but the vet had told us it probably meant nothing. Now I'm thinking it did, but the problem with it was that in the majority of cases it's not confirmed until it's too late. Again, we don't know if it was that, and with the current times, we are not going to know either, which- duh. It's not like it's necessary, we can't do anything for her. Still, I was devastated- still am. I am very, very close to my pets, and I love them all with my whole heart. I've raised them all since they were puppies just born, so... yeah, it's been pretty fucking hard these past few days. Today I started to write again, and it felt nice. Anyhow, I'm sorry for this rant. Love you all, and enjoy the chapter.
“I guess” Peter conceded “. But I don’t want to be naïve either, you know? If we get a couple of years where things are quieter than usual, then great. But I know at some point they’ll get crazy once again. It’s what’s been happening all along, hasn’t it?”
“You tried” Bucky reminded him “, you didn’t want to hurt him, Peter, but he hurt you first. And you should not forget Harry was old enough to know what he was doing, okay? He wanted this, he chose this path”
And, please, don't get it wrong: this story will continue, but it'll be next week. Thank you all so much, love u all!
“Yeah, gotcha” Peter murmured while rolling his eyes, leaving his bed in order to find some coffee. He could hear his Uncle following him, and right there he decided that he was going to forget about the article - at least for the time being” Now c’mon, Uncle B, we have to get ready… we’re in the endgame now”
Sorry for being a bit late, I was super busy today. Quick disclaimer: I'm on a trip this Saturday, again, so I'm not going to post twice this week either. But I'll do so next week, this will be the last trip I have for a while. Sorry for the inconvenience, enjoy the chapter!
Peter nodded and let her go, frowning when the Princess was not coming back to their living room. He left the ice tea on the coffee table and went to see what was going on, stopping dead on his tracks when he realized Shuri was talking to Peter’s friends - Ned, Flash, Harley, and… MJ.
“Well, we wanted to see you before our crazy family abducts you,” Tony said, saying what Peter had already guessed “. Shuri told us you were doing okay, but… once Papa Bears, always Papa Bears”
Also, an important note: Steve didn't know Bucky was the murder of the Starks. He suspected HYDRA was behind it, though.
Tony and Steve gave Peter away, so it's only the two of them. More than ten years after, Steve discovers his best friend is still alive, albeit in the hands of HYDRA, so he fights to get him back. Now, Peter is fifteen, and Bucky is home in the Tower. Thor:Ragnarok has happened, because I wanted him and Bruce (and Loki, sue me) to be in the Penthouse during this.
“That’s good to hear” Steve nodded, resting a hand on his husband’s shoulder and softly squeezing his hand when Tony went to grab his “. Is he awake?”
So, technically, this chapter was going to be posted tomorrow, but I couldn't help myself and decided to post it today! So, I hope you're happy about that, lmao.
Bucky was aware of what day it truly was. Most likely, the older of the two had probably asked FRIDAY to notify him of Peter’s presence, already knowing the young man would go to the Tower to get some of his energy off “. So” he said after nearly ten minutes “, care to tell me what’s bothering you, Jay?”
Btw, I went to see 'A Star is Born' last week, and even though I had the ending kinda spoiled for me -only partly-, it still got me, so, yay :,). anyway, enjoy the chapter!
Btw, important: there won't be a new chapter this Saturday. I'm leaving for NY tomorrow for a few days, returning Monday, so I won't be able to write nor post. Sorry about that! I know I had a really mini hiatus not so long ago! I promise after this the posting schedule will go back to normal.
“A bit” Bucky admitted, ignoring his kid’s groan at his words “, but I think she’ll forget about it just for tonight until she makes sure you’re actually okay”
“But I made it” the genius pointed out “. It was a bad stab wound, and the blade being poisoned definitely scared us all, but I’m here, okay? I think that’s the important part”
“Sure… he should be coming to in the next few minutes” Cho said, gesturing towards the way Peter's room was. Tony and Steve walked to their son’s room, leaving May in the waiting room after the nurse told them she could go in later.
So, a little bit later than usual, but here is the next chapter! My apologies, I didn't realize it was this late! Enjoy the chapter, and see you at the end!
“Just look at it, Junior” Bucky sighed, crossing his arms across his chest “. I know you’re not going to like this, but you need to see it”
“Buck told me to be careful and to hope everything was going to be okay,” she said, crossing her arms over her chest elegantly “. He promised he was going to take care of whatever Peter is doing, but I know nothing else”
so... it's been a weird week. the news of Chadwick's passing shook me, especially because it came out of nowhere, and I had always seen him as this giant, this KING, and to know that he'd been that sick was... shocking, to say the least. we were so blessed to have him with us for as long as we did, and we're incredibly blessed to have the pieces of art he left behind. we have to honour him, honour his legacy, and be proud of who we are. sorry if you didn't want to read this, or if this seems a bit unnecessary, but I didn't want to post without talking about this first.
Steve rolled his blue eyes at his husband, looking back at their son with a soft smile in his face “. Everything okay, Pete? Your Uncle B told us you trained together this morning”
“Of course” Abeer nodded “, and I agree: don’t rush into things, whatever happens has to be completely organic… but, now that you mention your Dads, it’s been more than a year now since they officially retired and, even though we’ve seen them as civilians a handful of times, they are missed as Avengers”
“Eventful enough for at least three books” Peter said, laughing. His Dads laughed back at him, nodding.
“Which brings me to the second thing we wanted to tell you,” Tony said, not letting “… we want to know what happened, Peter. As current leaders of the Avengers, sure, but also as concerned parents: we want to know everything, okay?”
Another reason I wanted Tony to kind of let Steve be close again is because Peter is much more hurt than his Dad, as explained as it'll be. So I thought I'd give Steve someone he can truly rely on.
. He could see the members of his family completely taking over the battle, the villains not really standing a chance - except Harry, who was only being held back, Bucky’s foot pressed firmly on his chest. The young superhero knew why his Uncle was doing that - knew that Bucky wanted him to have the chance to fight Harry one last time, and he felt incredibly grateful for that one. He knew what to do then “. Captain, go to help Black Widow - Iron Man, go to Falcon”
A quick upload to announce the sequel is up and invite you guys to go and read it! You can click on the next work of this series... or search for it in my profile! It's called There's Still Fight, There's Still Hope! Hope you all enjoy!
I know you've noticed I've taken to only post Wednesdays now; I'll try to change it, but I also can't promise I'll make it every Saturday. Also, the next part of the one-shot I published is coming really soon, so stay tuned. Alright, enjoy this chapter!
“Watch your mouth” Tony teasingly admonished him, meeting him halfway down the steps for a bear hug. Peter simply laughed at him and hugged back, doing the same with his Papa once his Dad had let him breathe.
“I think so… I… I’m sorry, Peter. For everything, for - for believing in the wrong things, for-for- I’m sorry, I-“
“Yes,” Peter nodded, smiling to his Uncle and silently walking to where his parents were, both looking a bit nervous but still put together for their kid “. Hi, Dads”
“For the record, you’ve let them have this to themselves as the leader of the team” Steve reminded him “, so your Uncles are in the right here”
“Okay” MJ nodded, now a bit impatient about whatever Peter wanted to tell her “. What is it, Peter? You’re making me nervous”
his team, had known everything about them and fully trusted them. Of course, it helped to know every member of his team trusted him fully and would follow his orders, despite Peter being the youngest of the bunch (although,
Oh my goooood! My best friend pulled through and came with me to see IW when I asked him! I saw it yesterday and I'm still kind of in shock.
I'll be quick, 'cause I know I left you guys with a cliffhanger! This is the longest chapter of this story so far, so enjoy it!
“Well… I’ve been thinking, lately, that even when we’ve adapted well to the retirement of my Dads and Auntie Nat, things are going to change soon. Godfather Bruce will leave this year, and I know Uncle Clint wants to retire as well, spend more time with his family… I do know he has a plan as to what he leaves behind, although he hasn’t told me about it yet”
It's going to take a while to be posted, but most likely the first chapter will be posted before the end of August- possibly in the last two weeks, don't know yet. I want to be sure about it before I post it, but guys... it may be my favorite version of Peter, the one I'm planning to write. That being said, enjoy the last chapter! Also, really important note at the end! Also, this is a long chapter, hope you don't mind haha
Hope you guys liked it! You know you can ask me to write a one shot, or a story, if you want to see something here! Next story will probably be split in chapters. Don't know when it'll be up, because finals are coming, so it may take a little bit... to complete, at least. I hope I can find the time, though.
“Still, Peter. I should’ve approached it in a different way, I should’ve acted as the parent and the mature one”
What he wasn’t expecting, however, was to feel another hit on his back. Focused as he’d been on the Green Goblin, he hadn’t realized the other two villains were going to start fighting him, too. The one he didn’t know yet hit him in the back, sending him flying against a wall. Before he could hit back, however, Vulture came in and tackled him to the ground. But oh, not the ground in the apartment - the ground on the street. The vulture tried to let Peter free fall from his Aunt’s floor, but the superhero was quicker than that, so he shot a web at the Tower and managed to get on the ground without too much damage, just feeling his back burn. The street was mostly deserted, people for sure scared after the big explosion a few minutes earlier, and surely assuming it was something to do with a villain, given the building the explosion had happened at. Peter was also pretty sure his Uncle Bucky had had something to do with the quick extraction of civilians from there, for which he was grateful for.
I am aware I let some windows open, and those are there because, to be honest, I wouldn't be too shocked if I found myself writing more for this AU. Nothing is in the works though, first I'll publish something else, something different.
“Not really” Harry admitted “, but I do know Peter’s relationship with them has been getting worse lately, which only tells us it is time to act” he insisted. All around him, the villains nodded to his words “. This is what I promised you: this is what we’ve been working for. It’s time for New York, for the
“Fine” Peter grumbled, letting his Aunt leave in search of Cho. Shuri put a hand on his arm, squeezing his bicep comfortingly.
“I do” Peter nodded “. And in those days you are quieter, and require more alone time… and usually some Papa, Uncle Sam, or me time”
So this is a long chapter, and it took me a while to finish it and feel good about it. To be honest, I felt super super nervous about this, but here it is... and sorry for the slight delay, I'm at a beach house with no wifi, so I only have data to upload this.
“We agreed, too, that the War shook things up in a way no one understood back then. When we came back here the whole world found out I was Spider-Man, and with everything that that implied… I put the War in the back of my head. But the fact is: we went to space. Dad, we almost died in space. I saw a Moon thrown at you, I saw you getting
. In these past few months you’ve managed to clean some of Harry’s image, to make his name a more respectable one, and honestly, punk junior, I think that’s more than what you had to do. Not like it surprised me you did it, I know you enough to have been expecting something like it, but… you did your part, James. Stop tormenting yourself over it”
I hope you guys liked the chapter! I personally really liked writing Harry and Peter's friendship, to be quite honest, so I really hope you guys did, too!
“But do you want to?” Michelle asked, worrying her lower lip. Peter took another sip of his drink before answering, if anything to make her a bit nervous.
Hope you guys are enjoying the story so far! Today the chapter comes a little bit sooner because I'm leaving right now and I don't know when I'm going to be back, and maybe when I do get back it's too late in the evening. So, here it is the new chapter!
I think we should prepare ourselves, be ready to help Peter out the second he calls, because I sure hope he does call”
So we are just going to pretend I didn't mess up the days and thought today was Saturday, okay? Okay. Quarantine (although technically we are not doing it where I live anymore, we're allowed outside but with restrictions... whatever) really has messed up my schedule. I'm sure you all understand
So, I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter, and don't forget to tell me which couples you want to see in here, and also who you want Peter to end up with.
“It may be a good idea to stop smirking in victory, doofus” MJ whispered in his ear “. I’m sure Ned is still sixty percent sure he wants to tackle you to the ground”
“Sam says so, too” Peter laughed, shaking his head at his Uncles antics. Despite everything, though, Peter wouldn’t trade them for anything… and he knew those two were incredibly good for the other “. Did they tell you when they’re coming back, by any chance? Because I haven’t heard a thing”
“You know, I am aware of what you’re doing,” Peter said the moment they were sitting down. MJ had dragged him to one of their favorite cafés, a bit busy for that hour but they still had found a free table close to the window.
I hope you all liked the chapter! Things are progressing now, and what will Harry want? Only time (and chapters) will tell.
“Shut up” he murmured. His father’s voice hummed right next to him, clearly amused by the whole thing.
Ned saw him a moment after, smile softly breaking his face in two, although out of respect for Shuri (or probably fear), who was blocking his way, he didn’t step inside the place “. Pete! Dude, I’ve been dying to see you!”
“Understood” both geniuses nodded, in a way that Steve found incredibly similar. Once again, he was reminded of how alike those two were… and once again, he completely adored that.
The ride was short, although it felt like forever for Peter, but soon he was parking the car and going inside the place, a bit more deserted than usual (probably due to the extremely cold weather, nothing weird for the middle of December), but the superhero was not mad about that. In silence, he took his time to arrive at his destination, frowning when he got there. Despite never having talked about something like death, or where they’d want to rest forever, the genius knew Harry would’ve hated to be where he was, in the Osborn family’s mausoleum, where his Dad and Mom were also buried. Or maybe he would’ve liked it, Peter thought, to be close to his parents, to at least be close to his Mother, whom he had always longed for, Peter had known. With a deep sigh, the young superhero went inside the place, ignoring Norman’s tomb (for his own mental health) and observing Harry’s, feeling the hurt set in his low stomach and spread all through his body.
Anyway, PLEASE leave a comment so I know what you guys thought, and tell me: who do you guys think Peter should end up with? Let me know in the comments!
So, after a short break (which I'm sorry I did not warn anyone about), I'm back! I'm stressed, because finals and essays are just... ugh, horrible, but I had a great Holiday Season, and I could go back home and surprise my family, so that was great! Enjoy the chapter and please tell me what you think!
“Hey, Pep,” Peter said, interrupting her train of thought. She hummed to make him know she’d heard him and entered the elevator with him “, I am meeting Flash and a few other friends in a bar in a few minutes - reckon I can tell him about the Berlin trip?”
Alright, now time to get our minds off of this even if it's just for a little bit. Please, enjoy and leave a comment!
I will change Peter birthday, aaaand I was thinking about keeping the same uploading days, but know I don't know if I'll change Tuesdays to Wednesdays... plus, I'm gonna have a long flight on Tuesday, so I don't know if I'll be able to upload next Tuesday, anyways.
First of all, thanks for all your good wishes. I had an amazing time in NY, although I'm still tired, and I came back two days ago, lmao. Anyway, I know some of you thought May was being irresponsible. And, yeah, she was. But, as I said before, I don't believe in flawless characters. This is a drama story, they're not going to be perfect, and they're going to make mistakes. I know it was dramatic, and I know it was irresponsible for May. I'm aware of that, don't worry. And it's not something I'll ignore in this chapter, those mistakes.
Cliffhanger again? sorry! You guys I love them way too much. Don't worry, you can find out what happens next Wednesday! Muahahahhaha
Well, that's all! Enjoy the chapter, and I'll read you at the end :) ! PLEASE don't forget to leave a comment if you like it!
“Dad, I… appreciate your words, but they are a bit useless right now,” Peter said, effectively shutting his Dad off “. I know you’re sorry, and you know I’m sorry about the way I acted. But… it happened, nothing can change that”
It could’ve been five minutes, or maybe an hour, until Peter felt Shuri hugging him from behind while resting her cheek on his shoulder. They let the silence last for a couple of minutes longer, until the Princess squeezed his sides and moved to go and sit on the couch, Peter following her only a moment after.
Hope you guys love it! Remember you can always request something! Right now I have quite the requests, so if you do, it'll maybe take a while, but I'll do it nonetheless.
it's so cool to finally put here the scene that finished the second book! god it felt so good. anyway, now almost all of the secrets are out. and yeah, i know i spilled a lot here... god, you guys learned a lot this chapter, huh?
more information than one normal person would have, and the genius strongly suspected Michelle’s boss had known it’d be like that if she wrote it, with her being Peter’s ex and current close friend, which- unfair? Probably a bit, but his father had taught him enough about the press to know it wasn’t weird at all. It also didn’t mean Michelle wasn’t a good reporter on her own - hell, the girl had been at the top of her class at NYU at her internship had almost begged her to accept a job there. However, it was rather disappointing to read, even when a small part of Peter’s brain was also proud of her and her work, knowing Michelle had struggled for a bit after arriving to New York from Chicago.
if Peter went ahead and told him how separated from the rest of his family he was, and how he had stopped believing in the Avengers. All in all, it had been painfully easy to think of a plan to fight Harry, and possibly (hopefully) end all the madness… only problem? It’d been easy to
Now, if you didn't read it on the note at the beginning of the chapter:  I'm gonna do a third and last installment to this series (other than the one-shots and short-stories work). On the next chapter, I'll tell you guys the synopsis. Only thing I'll say: it's going to take place after Peter graduates high-school. Also, to everyone who wanted me to do FFH... I'm still thinking about it. If I do it'd either be on a short story in the work I already have, or via flashbacks in the new story.
“That it does” Tony sighed, hand running through his hair and messing it up. Steve kissed it reverently, nesting his cheek against it after doing so “. Steve, you saw how broken he was back when Norman died and Harry pushed him out of his life. I don’t want to go back to that”
“You are forgetting something, doll” the Captain murmured, lips pressed against his husband’s hairline.
By that point, sunrise was almost peeking at the horizon, and Shuri was sleeping against Bucky, who had a sleeping Sam in his other shoulder. May and Happy were also sleeping, resting against each other and more worried about their nephew than for their lost apartment. Tony and Steve, however, were some of the heroes still awake, like Bucky all too worried to even think about resting their eyes.
Hope you all had an awesome week! I had a great trip, although school is stressing me out right now, but hey, what's new? Anyway, enjoy the chapter!
“I rested,” Shuri said as the only explanation. Peter nodded at her words, knowing just how stubborn the princess could be, and looked at his Aunt once again, clearly knowing she was there for a reason - and most likely, not a good one. Pepper sighed and handed the now turned-on tablet to Peter.
ANYWAY, please leave a comment so I can know what you think of the chapter! And I promise I will answer! (that includes the ones I haven't answered yet, I'm on it).
Peter nodded, looking around in the room to find his family looking back at him with reassuring smiles and warm eyes and, even when the prospect of the press conference was as terrifying as ever, Peter didn’t feel alone. Whatever happened next, he had his family to rely on… especially his Dads, who gave him one last hug, letting him go with Happy whom, of course, was going to stand beside Peter for the entirety of the conference, like he’d done for Tony all those years before “Ready, Pete?” The bodyguard asked, nudging his shoulder. Peter nodded, feeling more confident than a minute before.
“Do you think that could be us?” Michelle asked, raising one eyebrow in doubt. It had taken Peter to say it for her to realize that, well… maybe she had already been thinking of them like that. But it made sense, didn’t it? They worked together
As I said, I was having a week off, and so I wanted to write a few chapters in those free days. But, as much as I wanted to, this week I had due numerous projects, and two tests. As I'm sure you can all understand, I have to prioritize my studies before anything else. And so, I decided that I'm taking a week off, but from here.
“Peter was in a state of shock after the battle - we all say it on the Livestream. He fell unconscious while still in a panic, which makes us fear he will wake up in a similar state”
“Regardless” Bucky intervened, trying to call all parties down “, Peter’s strong, and I’m sure Doctor Cho can work miracles, alright? So let’s just… sit down and wait for news”
“And” the genius kept going, completely ignoring his Uncle “, she didn’t reveal any big secrets that, for a fact, I know she knows. Trust me, I’m fine”
Hey there! I'm posting sooner than I expected, but I had my second final test today, and I felt great about it, so I thought: why not?
now, this chapter is a bit on the long side, but that always happens when books come to a close... and I can't believe it, but we only have three chapters left (including this one), which is... crazy to think about.
First off, I'm so sorry for not posting on Saturday. I was on a trip and while I was planning on posting either way, but I couldn't finish the chapter and I wanted to post it when I felt it was somehow good enough. By the way, this is the longest chapter of this story, and I'm not even remotely sorry. Enjoy!
ANYWAY, please leave a comment so I know what you guys thought about this chapter! Please tell me if you want to see something in this story!
weird, considering he was the youngest one in the room- hell, the Vulture had been Peter’s father-in-law for one night, which was all kinds of fucking bizarre. Wait, right- focus.
I hope you guys love this chapter, and if you have any doubts, don't fear to ask them. Please comment and if you can leave kudos! I really need to see if you guys like this story, and it motivates me to keep going!
Soooo I know this was DRAMATIC. But what can I say, I love drama. Before any os you asks, YES, this story has more than one part. Possibly three, actually. So, don't kill me just yet and just tell me what you thought hehe.
PLEASE leave a comment and kudos if you can/want! Thank you all for reading! Oh, and by the way, there is a chance I will post on Sunday instead of Saturday because I don't know if I'm going to be able on Saturday. I promise you guys will get your weekend-chapter, but I'm not sure which day.
“Peter, hey - baby you’re okay, you’re safe,” Tony said, shushing their kid until he opened his eyes, looking a bit scared before they settled on his parents, who smiled back at him in what they hoped was reassuring to the young superhero.
I loved this chapter because it introduced Harley, it brought back Ned, and Shuri, and some uncle-nephew bonding time. Next chapter will have even more Bucky and Peter, so be prepared!
“Oh, I think Dad is afraid we’ll eventually make something explode” Peter said, laughing “. Which, most likely, but at least the Tower is sort of Peter-proofed… and I’m ninety percent sure Dad is making it Harley-proofed as we speak”
Second, which days do you guys prefer for me to upload? Because, I usually do it Tuesdays and Saturdays, but I get a lot more of reviews on Tuesdays lmao, so... if you guys can tell me which days do you prefer, I'd appreciate it so much. Thanks in advance!
“Okay, Peter” Steve answered for his husband “. But remember what we’ve told you, alright? There’s no need to hide your feelings, or to pretend you’re okay when you’re not. This family has been through enough, so it is time we are all honest with each other”
Peter had decided to ride his bike to the Lake House, knowing how much his Dad hated it and his Papa envied it. Now that he was older (not
“Yeah” Peter nodded, finally realizing they had been left alone for an incredibly rare large amount of time (aka a couple of minutes, but in a battle that was extremely rare). Looking around for a moment, his breath caught in his throat when he realized it wasn’t just his fathers fighting alongside him, but the entire team, even people Peter didn’t know where in the city - even the Gods, supposed to be at New Asgard.
Hi guys! Sorry for being this late, today was a friend's birthday and I came home late. Anyway, enjoy!
“I know, Dad” Peter nodded “. And that’s not all… I realised something else. I realized that, after losing Harry… that meant I had no ground to stand on, or at least not one that felt like
“Because we let ourselves grow” Peter nodded “. So, you and me… how about we do the same? We don’t think about being a right time, and rather… we just think we’re lucky to have each other. Okay?”
Now Bucky and Natasha know what happened to Peter, but, the main question is, what will they do with the information?
“Neither was yours” Bucky immediately argued “. Not with Norman, and not with Harry… Peter, this is something you will
“No” Spider-Man replied “, I’m letting my team help me, because it’s what I’ve should’ve done for a long time. Besides, this way this is fair, isn’t it? Rather than six versus one”
“As for myself” Peter took another deep breath, scanning his room again to weigh his words in. A good portion of the reporters looked a bit more sympathetic than before, but another good portion still looked irritated, itching to get a clear answer as to what had happened, which Peter could understand. Well, now it was time “. I am not stepping down as an Avenger, nor am I quitting Stark Industries - I apologize for the confusion my actions caused, and for being untruthful. However, quitting both things publicly was part of my plan to stop the villains; I had to make Harry Osborn believe he was succeeding in his plan in order to gain his trust and to, later on, be able to defeat the Sinister Six. I did this with the support of my family, who knew this was a strategic move with no other intentions than to protect and save the city”
I really hope you guys enjoyed it. I never thought I'd be writing a sequel for that tiny idea I had one day, but I'm so glad I did, and so glad I decided to do a third story. What I can say about the new work is that will deal with a grown-up Peter (most likely in his early twenties), and it'd be a coming-of-age sort of story. Seriously, I'm so excited about this story.
“It’s about…” Peter mumbled, trying to find the right words. He then took a deep breath and looked her right in the eyes, more serious than a moment before “. It’s about the article you published a few days ago. About me, and the stunt I pulled”
“I know, Dad. But… I also know your fear was not irrational. I know you were right to be worried, and… it proved to be true, anyways” the youngest genius said through a sigh. Tony hummed in disagreement and nudged his son’s shoulder, getting his attention.
Bucky went to the rescue then, breaking the contact Peter had with Harry’s corpse and taking him away. Peter seemed to fight a bit in his Uncle’s arms, and then he went terrifyingly limp.
Please read my note above, to clarify a doubt about the posting schedule, and please leave a comment and kudos!
“And Bucky laughed in your face for five minutes” Harley laughed “. Sam had to hold him to keep him from dropping to the ground”
“Shut up,” both of them said, making the whole table laugh at them and definitely getting some attention - which they should’ve expected, being who they were in a very public place. But oh well, nothing they could truly do. They instead chose to enjoy their night out, all too aware that with the impending Holidays they’d see each other way less, all busy with their own families and traditions; despite the majority of them staying in New York, Harley was going back to Tennessee to his family, and Shuri was going back to Wakanda for some royal festivities. Peter, MJ and Ned were all going to stay in the city, and Flash was going to spend Christmas in Manhattan, but for New Year’s was going with his family to the Bahamas, which he was sure to throw in their faces, although clearly playful about it.
Have you seen the new mini-trailer for Endgame? Dear God... I don't want to spoil too much, but I got the Irondad-Spiderson content I really, really needed. Now, enjoy the chapter
“Well, finally Peter and Aunt Hottie joined us” Tony said, smiling fondly at the both of them. Peter rolled his eyes at his Dad, May being an exact copy of him “. Yeah yeah, roll your eyes all you want, you’re still eating whatever I cooked”
Okay, that was all! Thank you so much for reading, and I'll read you soon! Love you all 3000, and PLEASE take care and be safe!
“On my way” Steve nodded, already leaving with Bucky. Tony ignored the other members of the team and the cameras that were surely filming everything (those fucking vultures, his mind provided) and flew faster than he’d ever done to the Tower’s med bay, which had been only slightly damaged in the explosion that had taken place not even an hour before.
So, big question... if I do a sequel about the events of Infinity War, what would you like to see happening?
And, to tell you guys the truth... the next one is going to be WILD. Like, I honestly love the next chapter haha it's one of my favorites, and I think you guys will like it, too!
Next chapter is here! Oh, Goshh, I saw Ed Sheeran yesterday, and it was so amazing... one of the best concerts I've seen.
Because I don't want to give spoilers to the people who reads but hasn't seen the movie yet, I won't talk about the movie specifically in a while. I have already a one shot in mind, but I won't be posting it in a while, either.
“My point being: I know who he is as a superhero. He took me out of the fire even when I had all intentions to kill him just because that was the right thing to do. I don’t see that kid doing this, not with his rightfulness”
“That’s good” he agreed. His friends didn’t stay too long after that, all too aware Peter was still a bit overwhelmed, and they already had that they’d gone for, some type of confirmation that Peter was okay. Harley had gone to the Tower after Peter’s insistence, and Shuri had gone with him after making Peter promise he was going to be okay and going to the Tower shortly after. The genius promised so and let everyone leave - except one person, reaching out to grab her arm to stop her from leaving the apartment “. Hey, MJ. Can you stay for a minute?”
“Whatever” Peter mumbled, scoffing when MJ petted his head as if he was a puppy. The rest of the group laughed at his face and all waited patiently for Ned to arrive, which he did merely five minutes later.
So, super cool news: a lovely reader, OceanDream, asked if it'd be possible to translate this story to Russian. Now you can find it here: https://ficbook.net/readfic/7963608 !! Thank you, Ocean, and if any wants to read it the link will take you to it!
“Been better” Peter admitted “, but… for the first time, I do feel it’s time to heal. I think I can start healing”
“Let’s just agree you two saved each other then” the youngest of the three said, interrupting what he knew was endless banter between those two. Peter knew it was playful, and that it was just another way those two had of showing affection and care, but he also knew that if he didn’t put a stop on it they could go for
Peter stopped his punches then, all too aware his Uncle was actually right. Still (and yeah, maybe something he had to talk with his therapist about), the young superhero had hoped he could ignore the issue for just a bit longer.
“Do I need to remind you Ned caught your lie in, like, two minutes?” MJ said, fake sweetness just pouring off of her. Peter stuck his tongue at her again and looked back at his best friend.
Please make sure to leave a comment! That way I know what you think of the story so far and it kind of lights up my day and the darkest of moods, so yeah. And have a good night/day, whatever you're having now!
“On doing it for the people’s behalf” Norman mocked “. Me, Norman Osborn, the one who shaped the technological world before Peter’s sorry excuse of a Dad decided to take over, to corrupt our world and fill it with nonsense. And you
“C’mon bro… this is an ideal situation, and you’ve already made a name for yourself. S.I would want you even if we hated each other”
, one where I accept my past and my present. And I haven’t done it just yet, but… I’m getting there. And I wish you were here to see it, but…you not being here is one of the things I have to put as a cement, I guess. Anyway, I just… wanted to catch you up with my life, I guess, show you I remember what today is”
PLEASE leave a comment so I can know what you guys think about this chapter, which was pretty important within this story... thanks!
“No doubt about it” MJ agreed again, making Peter laugh. She observed him in silent for a long moment, although it was not uncomfortable “. You know… it’s a good look on you, Peter. This happiness… is a good look”
Peter hummed under his breath, going through his Uncle’s words in his head over and over. A small part of his brain could understand Bucky’s point, could see he was partly right. Another one, one he knew it’d take a while to leave, knew things were not that simple, knew too little time had passed for him to be healed from what had happened - if he ever was going to be, fully “. How long did it take for you, Uncle B? To feel okay”
I'm aware I've been away for a while, to say the least.  Some things happened in my personal life that just made it hard to sit and write, less alone to actually do it in a way I felt was right for this story. But I finally did it, and my writers block seems to be finally fading, so... expect more things from me in the near future!
“Would that be so bad, Peter?” Bucky asked, trying to not push his nephew too far “. Honey, Harry is not someone you can hold on to for the rest of your life, and I know you know this… sure, you forgot your anniversary, but is it that bad…? If anything, it should feel liberating, like you’re not tied to someone who will do you no good”
“Yeah well, Sam struggled but I ended up pulling his weight and saving his ass, as usual” Bucky said, winking towards Peter. Sam scoffed at his partner and shook his head.
Well, tomorrow there's a new chapter of my Story, so hope you like that, and I'll see you next time! Bye! Oh, and don't forget to comment and leave kuddos! It motivates me so much
So, that's all. There'll be a really little time jump next chapter (don't worry, only a few weeks). Leave PLEASE comments and kudos if you liked the chapter, cause they really, really motivate me! See you soon!
Stil, writing helps me to feel better, and less stressed, so I've been trying to write more, lately. Can't promise regular updates (at least until I finish my projects & finals), but I promise I'll try!
“Are you finally ready?” Said man asked him with his voice laced with annoyance, standing on the edge of the rooftop and clearly impatient to get going. Harry knew that man didn’t like him - Adrian Toomes was too proud, too upset a twenty-four-year-old had turned to be his boss. But oh well, that really wasn’t Harry’s problem now, was it? As long as Vulture fought well, the young Osborn didn’t give a crap if they would, later on, go for a drink.
Hi guys! Omg,  we're almost at the end of this story! I'm writing the final chapter and it's super emotional! Also, I'm already writing the sequel with IW and I can just say... angst is coming #sorrynotsorry #alsofluff
“On it” Tony immediately said, carefully scooping Peter up - slower than he would’ve liked, but safer for the injured superhero “. I’ll call her on my way, hopefully she’s ready for surgery when I arrive at the Tower… please come asap”
“There’s already an article of what happened yesterday, Peter, and people are questioning you, and what happened,” she said, figuring Peter could use some bluntness in those moments “. They’re also talking about Harry being the Green Goblin… this time it was impossible to hide Green Goblin’s identity”
“As if” Tony immediately protested, following them to the elevator “. I made my perfect clone, Rogers, suck it up”
“Wait though” Vulture intervened “, you may sort of know Parker, but I am the one who fought Spider-Man and who could see the human part of him, remember?”
Btw, important: there won't be a new chapter this Saturday. I'm leaving for NY tomorrow for a few days, returning Monday, so I won't be able to write nor post. Sorry about that! I know I had a really mini hiatus not so long ago! I promise after this the posting schedule will go back to normal.
“You really did” Pepper nodded “, but you were pulling a Tony, and besides, the meeting wasn’t that urgent back then, and you were swamped with other smaller meetings and conferences”
“I understand that, Father” Harry murmured, finally still and his breathing slowly coming back to normal.
Peter observed the men as they started to fake-argue, Flash dozing out next to them and fixing his eyes in the fire Peter had lit a few minutes prior wanting to disassociate completely with the situation. The genius chose to observe two of his favorite people, leaning back into the couch and snuggling close to his best friend.
I hope you're all doing okay! I'm incredibly stressed with finals, but hanging on lmao. Anyway, enjoy!
Damn... I didn't ever think ending the chapter in a cliffhanger was going to feel this good, or fun, lmao
I've been wanting to do this for a long time, and now May's in the Penthouse! In the next chapter she'll meet the rest of the family, so we'll see how that goes.
“Harry…?” He asked, too scared to mutter anything else. The husbands exchanged glances, knowing they had to be honest with their kid and yet hating to deliver the news. It wasn’t necessary though, because Peter seemed to know just by looking at them, casting his eyes down to his lap “. Do people know?”
And Peter had also learned how to throw the opponent off of their game. So, even though he wanted nothing but to go and hide and pretend this wasn’t happening, he knew it was the time to be the hero everyone told him he was. The hero he, deep down,
You guys had to see this one coming, especially because I didn't have any cliffhangers on my last chapter. Muahahhaha! God, I love going back to drama and ansgt.
“Hasn’t your Dad told you he hates how fast you go in that thing?” The super soldier said for a greeting, jogging until he was close enough to pull Peter into a hug, getting one back immediately. The genius of the two silly shrugged, letting his Uncle bring him into the house, where some other members of his family were. Once inside he said hello to everyone in there and went to the back porch, where his Dads said his greetings and pestered him for a few minutes about his interview. Once his Uncle Happy joined them Peter excused himself, finally seeing his Aunt May in all of the chaos that was their family.
Bucky rested a hand on his shoulder when he realized Peter wasn’t reading the article anymore, squeezing it gently and with a silent question in his eyes, clearly trying to see if his nephew was okay or if it had really affected him. And, if Peter was honest, it
“It’s okay, James, it’s fine, you’re here with me, it’s okay” Bucky murmured, frantically trying to get his nephew to calm down. He didn’t know what to do- a part of him wanted to search Peter’s bodies for injuries, knowing the kid had some of those, wanted to check if all the blood Peter was coated in was Harry’s or if some of it was Peter’s as well… hell, he wanted to pretend nothing had happened that night, yet he knew he couldn’t. Peter was screaming in his arms out of himself with pain and grieve and Tony and Steve trying to get to them as fast as they could, having been at the other side of the now-finished battle when everything had gone down, so he had to help Peter until his parents arrived, and then after that because that night it just… it had topped the last horrible night Bucky had lived. And he wasn’t completely sure they could get Peter through this one.
The group gasped at that, looking at the screen more attentive than ever, eyes drawn to the figure of Spider-Man. They saw Peter trying to fight and defend himself, but it wasn’t looking too good.
“Fine by me” Steve sighed, going back to his seat and smiling weakly towards his husband when he did as well. Slowly the room filled out with the rest members of their family who could make it, some of them busy in cleaning the city or taking the rest of the villains into custody, all aware Steve and Tony would tell them about Peter the instant they knew. Bruce went in with Cho after saying hi to the rest of the heroes, trying to help out, but that had been hours before.
Pay attention, because Ned and Peter are finally talking next chapter! Initially, it was going to be in this one, but then it'd been too long, so... next one it is ;)
So, Peter and Bucky start the training! And it seems like the teenager trusts his new teacher more and more.
“No” Steve agreed, observing his husband and son with a small smile “, but we can change the way we treat the topic. Pete, we know you didn’t feel comfortable sharing details about your relationship with Harry, but you can do share, ok? This is a safe space”
now, this is a long-ass chapter. but i have to say: this may be my favourite chapter of the third book, at least for now. well, i think it really is.
So, really quick (and kind of important): I'm going on a trip on Thursday. I'll be with my choir for more than a week and then I'll be with my family. The trip is long, yes haha. Fortunately, I'm bringing my laptop with me, so the story will continue, don't worry guys. HOWEVER, I'm not sure if I'll have wifi -or at least, good wifi- with my choir, so next chapter can be later than usual. If so, sorry! I'm sure I'll have wifi, once I am with my family, so there's that. And I'm almost sure I'll have it with my choir, but I want to warn you guys.
“Not gonna lie, you’re starting to get predictable” he murmured, leaving some weights he’d been toying with. Hearing a scoff, Peter turned around to look at his favorite Uncle, whom, to his credit, was looking half-awake.
On the other hand, stepping back from that ‘right person, wrong time’ he’d had with MJ for so long had been the right choice, and time had only proven that. They had given each other space to grow without any type of expectations, gone back to being best friends and, even when the first few months were still a little awkward, they both found their groove. Peter had seen Michelle grow into this independent and amazing woman that needed no one to be happy, which is what he’d wanted for her in the first place. Now, if she chose to be with someone, that was not going to be directly tied to her happiness. And that was good.
“Likewise” Peter smiled, getting some sighs from the small audience there was in the studio. Abeer smiled back, marveling in the presence of Peter- the kid she had met twelve years ago had beautifully transformed into a man everyone in the world felt proud of “. We’ve known each other for a while, haven’t we?”
I really hope you guys enjoyed it! Quick reminder: there won't be a chapter on Saturday because I will be on a trip. Maybe I can upload it on Sunday, or not upload it at all and upload it next Wednesday. What do you guys prefer?
The villain started to breathe faster and harder at that; short puffs of air coming from his mouth and tinting his lips crimson, the sight of it enough to make Peter feel sick to his stomach. He looked at Peter then, confused.
“I’ve said some pretty messed up stuff” his Dad said then, kissing the top of his head “. So nothing will scare us, kiddo”
“Uncle B, I’m serious. It sucks to know there are articles questioning what I’m doing, but we knew there were gonna be a few of them, didn’t we? Hell, I’m sure this one isn’t even the first to be published after my little show in the press conference”
Hi guys! Hope you're enjoying the story so far! If you want to see something here, just tell me and I'll try to write it in. Also, just FYI, the '****' are signaling the beginning and end of a Flashback.
Steve and Tony have finally decided they want to do something- for the moment, talking with Bucky sounds nice.
“Of course, Spidey” Bucky smiled, running off to help Clint defeat Scorpio and leaving Peter with Harry, who was coughing on the ground, trying to regain his breath.
“That you’re moving on” Bucky shrugged his shoulders, moving closer so he could put a comforting arm around his kid’s shoulders “, that you’re healing. It’s not a bad thing you had to be reminded of it, James”
hi guys! so, I don't know if you've noticed, but we have an official number of chapters! the story will officially be 45 chapters long, if nothing goes wrong. so there's that haha
“Maybe” Peter conceded “, or maybe not. I told Michelle, right after the Sinister Six, that I didn’t want us to be that same concept… because it put too much pressure on us, because it was not fair for everyone else that could be involved with us. It was, in a way, refraining ourselves from exploring the world. So we decided to forego that concept”
So I hope you enjoyed the Chapter! I honestly loved to write the Christmas Chapter, and I hope you guys did, too!
“Like ninety percent of it - but not everything! Besides, he only did it because I had to help him” the blond said, trying to explain himself. Shuri sighed, knowing how much Harley really appreciated Peter, as a surrogate brother and as a person in general. She scooted closer to him and looked him dead serious in the eyes.
His Dads laughed again, wordlessly agreeing with their kid. And, even when they knew Peter was right and that things would get crazier with time, they were okay with it. They hated to know it, sure, because ultimately they wanted happiness for their only son, but they knew the world could not be in better hands than Peter’s. And… it was nice to know that all the fighting and suffering had been worth it. Peter was a strong man, and a man who was going to enjoy a long and beautiful life, despite its complications. And for them, that was enough.
“No freak-outs, don’t worry,” Shuri said, laughing softly “. I mean, they’re all a bit worried about you, which I think it’s normal… but they’re very proud of you. Bucky warned them to let you breathe at dinner, though, so I don’t think it will be too bad”
Omg this will be short 'cause I want you all to read the chapter, so go and enjoy and tell me what you thought of it!
“It’ll be short, I promise,” Pepper said, making a cross over her heart while they exited the elevator“, and it’ll just be to explain the details to Eugene - please make sure to tell him everything else”
“Of course it does, Honey,” Bucky said, grabbing his nephew’s hand and squeezing it gently “, and you don’t have to pretend it doesn’t, okay? I’m not gonna lie, kiddo, this is going to hurt for a while. But you knew what you were going to endure”
Done! Fun fact: this chapter was going to end with Tony asking Peter about the living arrangements, but I realized I didn't like the structure of the next chapter with those two scenes on it... so at the end, you guys got a long chapter haha
“That’s right” Bucky nodded, kissing the kid’s temple “. And I’m extremely lucky to have the support system that I have, one that I didn’t have for the longest time, one I do know not everyone has… one you do have. So, James, even when I know you can’t exactly believe my words right now… things will get better, kid. I promise”
well... I do know I ended the chapter with some sort of a cliffhanger, again, and I kinda apologise for that.
“You’re at the med bay, sweetheart” Steve told him, softly cradling his face “. We brought you here after you collapsed in Buck’s arms… but you’re fine, Cho did surgery on you and told us you’ll be fine, okay? Only have to rest to achieve that”
Please leave a comment to tell me what you thought AND MAYBE you can tell me your favorite part) of the chapter.
I hope you guys liked it. I wanted to have one chapter with the Superfamily wanting to get closer. Now that Peter knows his Dads intentions, things will change for the better. But, it'll take time. And not everything is going to be easy.
“You’re moving back to Wakanda” Peter gently reminded her “, and I am staying here, and I just… I can’t move there, not really. People need me here, just like they need you in Wakanda, and I think it… wouldn’t make complete sense if one of us moved permanently to the other’s home country”
“I know” Peter admitted “, but I know why you did it. And I know what pain does to people - what grieving what leads oneself to. I lost my Uncle when I was fourteen, and if it wasn’t for May I wouldn’t have been able to survive. I… I’ve gone through too much stuff, but I always had someone there for me. I understand you didn’t: I understand now you did all of this from the pain you felt. And I forgive you for it”
“I am,” he said, equal annoyance in his own voice “. Now, c’mon, May Parker should be home already. Time to attack”
So, I hope you enjoyed the chapter! I really liked writing the different reactions of people to the break-up. And don't worry, you guy will get the Superhusbands'! It just didn't feel right in this chapter, and it would've made it too long. But the next chapter will have a lot of fluff!
Sorry for the late uptade- yes, I know it's Halloween, but I'm a college student, dude. I had too much homework to finish, lmao. Plus, I'm European, and at least in my country, we don't care about Halloween that much. So, even though I'm living in America 'til December, I think I can live without the Halloween craziness haha.
However, him understanding Steve's actions and wanting to 'know' each other again does NOT mean he has forgiven him, not totally. That's why he says they'll need time. And Peter's consent.
The ex-assassin smiled at the sight of his nephew awake and looking infinitely better than before. He knew Peter was okay, Tony and Steve had assured him so, but to see Peter actually conscious and sort of smiling was much more reassuring.
, I’ve been remembering today, expecting it to come for days beforehand, and this year I just… forgot. And I can’t help but think it’s my fault, because
“So they know the basics” the businesswoman informed him, voice confident but eyes showing a bit of worry for her beloved nephew “, that Harry was Green Goblin and the person behind all the villains that appeared out of nowhere these past few months. They know he passed, and that it was after a fight with you, but nothing else… and they know you stepping down was an act, although it hasn’t been confirmed for what. Most of them have guessed it, but it is for you to confirm”
did his parents manage to lead the Avengers and not die of stress in the process? Or not get a complete head of grey hair before forty? Well, actually scratch that. Peter
“Well, probably the biggest thing” Pepper confessed, snickering when she saw Peter visibly stop himself from groaning “. Peter, the new wing has been pretty successful so far… despite the postponed launch, these past few months have just proven what a genius idea this was. We have more investors interested in the wing, and most importantly… you have a meeting in Germany, right after Christmas, to discuss some possible new developments in nano-surgery. Mister Eugene Thompson will go with you, as one of the heads in that division… understood?”
Peter had hugged her then, unable to say anything else, and had helped her pack, putting on a mindless movie with all their favorite junk food and staying awake for as long as their exhausted minds let them. And, just before he’d fallen asleep… Peter had found himself agreeing with Shuri. She’d always be his most beautiful what if.
“Baby” Steve quipped in “, we know you wanted to do this on your own, but you have to let us help you, okay? It’s not wrong to do it”
“But, I… I don’t understand” Harry murmured, clearly losing strength every second that ticked by. Peter’s heart broke at the sight and he cradled the villain close to him, his torso on his lap and the blood pouring off their wounds mixing together in a fucked up yet beautiful way. At that, the taller man looked up, eyes filled with confusion and with just the tiniest bit of hope and gratitude “. I tried to kill you, Peter. I tried to finish you in more ways than I can count”
“Bro code, Shuri” Harley tried to defend himself, but the princess really looked like she wanted to kill him, and Flash, MJ, and Ned were slowly looking like it, too. The only persons who were looking non-threatening were Abe and Betty, but they were looking rather lost.
Sorry for not posting this past week. I had a lot of things to do for uni and I wanted to focus on that. I don't know how much I'm going to be able to post 'till Christmas, but hopefully, I can do it more or less regularly. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the chapter!
) arriving at the scene. Iron Man had tackled Green Goblin, and Captain America was helping Spider-Man stand up. They talked for a bit, and then Iron Man and Captain America went to help other members of the Avengers, and Peter went back to fighting Harry. The cameras followed the other heroes for a moment, but soon enough they focused on Spider-Man and Green Goblin again.
last chapter! i really wanted to post it on a sunday, i don't why it felt better to me, gave it a sense of clousure.
So this is a fourth part of the first story I posted. Someone asked me to do a scene in where Peter tells his family about the building crushing on him. Because someone also asked me to write a scene in where they meet MJ, I also put it here. It's shorter than the other caps, but fun! (and fluff!)
“I know, but believe it or not most of them can’t be bothered with that. I only see Buck and Nat truly doing it. Maybe Sam”
“What” Shuri immediately said, looking at Harley with murder in her eyes “. Why the hell didn’t you call me then?”
“And you’ll get better” Harley added, nodding vigorously to his own words “. We’ll all help you with that, bro”
“Good idea” Bucky sentenced, resuming the walk Peter had been in with Natasha and throwing an arm above his kid’s shoulder. Sam fell into step next to Bucky, looking at them both fondly.
, Peter” she’d said after that silence, making Peter’s breath hitch “. No matter what happens next, or if we do find a way to each other… you’ll always be the most beautiful what if to me”
) he rode his bike much less, if anything because of Tony’s heart problems. But, Peter had not seen his Dads in more than a week, so a little teasing was
“I’m using the tools my family has given me. Auntie Nat was even proud when I told her about my plans”
“I know” Peter nodded, probably more sure than he’d ever been. He took a couple of minutes to put his thoughts in order, but he knew his parents were patient with him and were going to wait whatever time he needed “. I was talking to Harry before” he murmured after a while “, because I just had to see him today. And… I was thinking how upset I was because I’d forgotten our anniversary, which is a first. Uncle Buck told me it’s okay, that me forgetting means I’m moving on and healing”
“Even though we want you to realize it would’ve been okay to ask for help” Steve intervened “. We are your team, the rest of the Avengers are your team as well, and we would’ve followed your orders, no questions asked”
“Sure” the redhead shrugged “, but make sure to tell him only the basic stuff - I know you are meeting friends and they are trustworthy, Honey, but you don’t know who is around you at that place- so just tell him the basics, and Monday morning he and you have a short meeting with me”
So sorry for not posting on Wednesday. I had a really bad cold and a test today! The test went well btw. I have another one next Saturday, but I really hope that one goes well, too.
You can all give me more names for the new team (Peter+Ned+MJ). I've received some really cool names, but I'd love to hear even more!
Next comes another mini-story, and I really really love this one. I want you guys to read it already sooooo bad, but give it a few days, because I'm still with finals and this weekend I have a family reunion, so I'll be incredibly busy.
It's going to be multi-chapter, but I actually don't know if I should publish them all here or make another story, like, out of here, and actually make it a little bit longer. It's up to you guys! So, tell me at the end of this chapter, and also at the end of the second chapter! Then I'll decide.
I hope you all liked it! The next one I don't know when it'll be, but hopefully soon! And I have a few ideas you guys told me that I really like, so I'm dying to finally write those! You can always tell me what you want to see here!
So, the chapter is done! I really hope you guys enjoyed it! There was a little twist at the end, but then again, it was something we all saw coming, right? At least I know some people did.
The idea of re-doing his last fight with Green Goblin had taunted his nightmares for days now - of Harry having the same fate as his father, of Spider-Man unintentionally killing Green Goblin Jr, of not being able to redeem himself to Harry ever again (if that was even on the table, anyway). So he had to be smart - had to knock Harry unconscious quick and easy, not causing too much damage. That would, probably, cause him to go slower than usual, not as quick as he would fight a normal villain, but he didn’t care: the important thing was keeping Harry alive.
Omg, I just saw Endgame for the second time (yesterday) and I loved it even more. Anyway, enjoy the chapter! (btw I know I said three chapters... but it's gonna be four)
“Maybe - at least, distraught. He will be confused and unsure of what is happening, so it is vital you calm him down. Try to not speak loudly and keep an even tone of voice”
“No, Papa, I need to say this now” Peter insisted “. Trust me, it’ll make me sleep better, okay? I need to get this off my chest”
“Where is it coming from?” Steve asked, trying to locate him himself. It was hard though; Peter’s body and suit were battered with gashes and burns, and it was dirty all over, both from Peter’s blood and Harry’s. Tony was the first to know the injury that was making his son bleed that much, thanking FRIDAY for being this quick.
“I see you two are enjoying the quiet life” the youngest laughed the second he’d taken off his helmet (the only thing his Dad asked of him, and he was a good son, after all) “. Gotta say, this whole rocking chairs on a porch fits you two pretty damn well”
insistence from Peter’s part, they had also managed to make Harry look better than he’d done back in August, at the time of his death. Pepper had dealt with
ALSO:  I've published another work. I decided that from now on I'm publishing one-shots individually, and I'm going to start publishing the ones I've already written, only extending them a little. I.e, the one I published was extended maybe a thousand, two thousand words.
Thank you if you've read the whole thing. The world needs light now, and help, and we can all do something about it <3 (aaalso, if I have to read someone saying 'All Lives Matter'... then please, just don't comment. I don't want to read that.
His parents hummed, arms going around his smaller frame in a way that was already muscle-memorized. With all the reflecting Peter had done just that day, he surprised himself by thinking he barely remembered a time his parents weren’t there (relationship with them decent or not). They had been back in his life for close to a decade now, and Peter had spent thirteen years without them, without any type of contact… but he couldn’t remember a time they hadn’t been there. He, realistically, could remember times where the arms around him had been his parents’, and Ben and May’s… and yet, now he couldn’t help but think his fathers’ presence had always been there. They had always been there, if anything spiritually.
it was right, he knew he had to do it - his father deserved so, deserved someone revenging his death, fighting for what was fair and for justice (justice for Norman… justice for Harry, even). And, even though a small part of him was eating him alive with guilt, with sorrow at the idea of killing the one person who had made him feel like he was about to explode with happiness - Harry knew it had to be done. His father had made sure to remind him of exactly that for way too long for Harry to forget about it just now.
“I think you’re absolutely right, kiddo” Tony immediately nodded, Steve agreeing wordlessly with them “. And… what about the conversation we had? About you loving two people”
So thanks for reading, by the way, and I'll see you guys in the next chapter! Don't forget to leave a comment! Also, do you guys like Wednesday and Saturday as posting days, or should I change them? Love you all 3000!
I know you guys wanted to see Flash's reaction, and I really wanted to have it here, so here you go! I really loved the fluff in this chapter, but PLEASE tell me what you think! Also, tell me what you want to see in the new work where I'll write short stories and one-shots situated in this AU!
Lastly, yes, I decided to use B.A.R.F with Bucky. I love Black Panther, I love the story Bucky has there, being healed by Shuri and all, but it doesn't click with my story, so- B.A.R.F.
“We know, Baby” Tony murmured, kissing his baby’s forehead and closing his eyes in an attempt to remember they were okay now. They were safe. Steve hugged them close to his body, the memories of the horrible days he’d thought his boys dead coming back “. And we should’ve payed more attention to your mental health after the war”
For now, however, let me thank all of you for sticking around for this long, for being patient and amazing readers and supporters. Thank you for all the lovely comments and kudos, thank you to everyone who enjoyed this story (stories even) and my writing. It's been wild to grow up along this story, to see my writing develop and get used to writing in my second language.
“Please, stop with that,” she said “, there’s no need for you to bow, and it’s Shuri, just… Shuri. Go inside, let’s see if we can figure out what’s going on with Peter”
Someone knocked on his door ten minutes before it was go time, and Peter chose to step outside of his room instead of letting whoever was in, figuring it was time to go, anyway.
“Yeah, we all saw her before, Sam, well done” Bucky murmured, getting a soft shove in response “. Now, punk junior, what were you saying?”
. On his best days since Harry had died, Peter could pretend to forget about it, to just ignore the fact that Harry was dead. On his worst ones, every time he dared to close his eyes the broken look of his ex-lover came to his mind, without fail. Either way, in both cases Peter knew better than go and visit Harry at his resting place, had done it just twice in all the time his friend had been there. But, despite how hard it was for him, Peter had known a visit was due.
, with his parents and Aunt May, and also with Bucky, those talks serving him as some sort of therapy before he went back to his therapist, who had already been told about it and was waiting for him with a lot of notes - which,
PLEASE let me know what you guys thought! i've seen the majority of you guys prefer a PeterxShuri endgame... hmm, interesting.
“They’ll follow you” Tony assured his son “, like the leader you are: we will always follow you and trust you, Underoos”
I'm gonna try to write more, but as always, Uni is kicking my ass, so sorry in advance for any delays.
“I am not,” Harry said, bitterly laughing “, and you know I’m not, Parker. I never was, I- I never was like you, never meant to be. And the only good thing I had in me you took it the night you killed my father, the night where you decided to take him away from me”
Tony sighed, letting Bucky still have the princess in his arms for the explanation - he could already guess the battle had been retransmitted live for everyone to see, and he could also imagine Shuri had been the only one of Peter’s friends with enough access to get to the Avengers’ med bay.
Omg, I still can't believe we got Spidey back, I'm so happy! Enjoy the chapter and please review! I want to know if you guys like this story!
He’d stayed in the cemetery for a while after that, enjoying the silence and feeling a bit more at peace as the minutes ticked by. When the sun settled the young genius went back to his car, taking some minutes to himself to think about his next step. He realized he needed to do something else before returning to his apartment, so he turned the car on and in less than half an hour he was entering his old home, finding his Dads laying around in the living room.
“Give it up!” Harry yelled, panting heavily and growing increasingly frustrated. It wasn’t like Peter wasn’t tired - he wasn’t panting, but his body still ached all over from the previous fight they had been having, and his muscles still yelled in agony and exhaustion, which was only making it harder for Peter to keep fighting. He knew he had to put an end to the fight soon, but didn’t know-how.
“That’s manipulative” Ned groaned in complain, throwing his head back and hitting the back of the sofa. The rest of the friends agreed with the Filipino man, all laughing.
“That’s for worrying me, you idiot” Shuri replied, voice a weird mix between annoyed and relieved at Peter’s apparent wellness “. Seriously, Peter, if I hadn’t been this scared for you I would be killing you right now”
“I can protect myself very well, Peter” Shuri refuted, a slight cold look in her dark eyes. The slightly younger genius nodded, aware he had to phrase what he wanted to say carefully in order to get Shuri to understand his point.
“Furthermore, you know we will always support you” Steve added “. We just want you to be okay, little love”
May smiled warmly at him, cupping the side of his face to kiss the side of his head affectionately “. Of course it is, tough guy. Something being different doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad, just… different. Just life changing, and… that has a beauty of itself. The beauty of growing up, no matter what age you are”
By the way, I (finally, omg) saw Captain Marvel the other day, and I loved it! One of my best friends had told me it was nothing spectacular, but I honestly really, really liked it! And I'm more scared for Endgame now, wow :)
“Yeah” the youngest superhero agreed, snuggling closer to his father and, just for a moment, wanting to be fifteen again. However, that was long in the past… he was twenty-four, and not the same Peter - which, he knew, wasn’t exactly a bad thing.
Shuri nodded, not liking Pepper’s words and not even doubting the part about being by Peter’s side. If she had to be honest, there was a lot that could potentially damage Peter; from repercussions after his fake quitting of
Peter nodded once again, smiling gently to her in that way that always made MJ’s heart melt a little “. Just… next time, can you warn me? I know you couldn’t do it now, and I understand, but… next time a heads up would be nice. I can even give you some exclusive information. Deal?”
“We trust you” Steve immediately said, having had his own life in line and depending on Cho’s care more times than he could count “. Is he going to be okay?”
Now, however- now Peter felt lost, trapped between feelings and thoughts he didn’t even begin to understand. Harry’s death, and everything that that implied, was something he knew was going to affect him even before he heard his ex-lover’s heart stop… he knew it was something that could break him, just as he knew his family would never really allow for that to happen, not after Norman’s death. But he just - Peter was
Peter felt his breath get caught in his throat, and, with shaking hands, he ripped Harry’s mask off, almost crying out loud when he saw how pale the villain was, how much his eyes were slowly starting to lose life, how blood was coating his lower lip.
. And I’ve realised that… much of my feelings in the past two years have just been me trying to find some ground”
he knew how to do it, had probably seen videos upon videos of his own father fighting (and maybe, Peter tried not to think, he’d seen the last fight as well), but never really trained. And Spider-Man
All in all- if the plan worked - Peter was going to meet his end by the end of that same day, which… Harry knew was good. He
“But it is done now” Pepper pointed out. It’d taken a long while, but between Peter, his parents, and the rest of his family, they had managed to completely clean Peter’s name, and, after
“Good” Harry murmured, starting his way to the rooftop, where he knew the Vulture and Scorpio - the one villain Peter had never really fought. He was supposed to go next, surprise him when Spider-Man was fighting the Vulture again, but Peter’s sudden decision to quit everything had changed things, and so Scorpio had to be a surprise villain in the final fight - it didn’t matter, though. If anything, it could work on their favor because no one would know what to do with him, right? Harry knew Happy could, and honestly, he probably did, know about the villains Peter had already fought. But if his wife was attacked by someone no one knew about, then maybe… maybe they were doomed from the start. Yes, Harry decided, this was a good idea - and he had to thank the Vulture for that, as he had brought Scorpio with him after escaping prison.
And... oops, another cliffhanger. Sorry, you guys know I love them way too much. Anyway, I really hope you guys enjoyed the chapter!
“Well, if it was anyone else I would say to keep it from him for a while,” Cho said, shrugging her one shoulder “, but with him being Peter it’s better if you’re honest with him… if not he will be more agitated”
“Because I don’t want you to be alone” the genius simply said, which was much simpler than it should’ve been. But wasn’t it the truth? Despite all the hurt, Harry had put him through, despite the knowledge, clear as a bright sky, that Harry wanted nothing of him but his death, Peter was still unable to let him go. And he didn’t know why, not exactly - could have an idea, but as it was he was stuck on one single thought: I don’t want you to be alone, and I don’t want you to die. Given that he could only get one of those things, no one was going to get Peter away from Harry “. I don’t want you to go thinking you were a bad person, Harry”
Oops, I left you guys on a cliffhanger, sorry about that. It's been a while since I last did it, so I had to do it once more.
And, well, he’d done it, but given that Peter was a superhuman that got hits worse than that on the daily, it barely hurt. And what was better: he ended up getting his best friend in S.I, which marked that plan of his as incredibly successful, no matter what the rest of his friends told him.
Anyway, the press for Avengers: Endgame has started and I'm so excited! I love all the cast and it's always super fun to see them together!
“Sorry I’m late dudes, some intern completely messed up the work I did on the new coding” Ned panted, taking off his jacket while going to search for a drink, sitting between Flash and Harley on the couch. The latter of the two laughed softly at that, which made his surrogate brother look at him with a promise of silent death in his eyes.
“I’m fine, Uncle B” Peter tried to tell him, but knew his Uncle just needed to check for himself. For when he had done it, Peter was feeling just a tad bit impatient, although he tried to tell himself Bucky had just been worried for him, which was fine.
happened to Steve, with a crazy and yet better than he could’ve imagined family… life was good. Life was perfect, even with all the inconveniences, even with the heartbreak and the bad times, even when the world weighted just a bit too much. Life was better that way, and everyone there knew it. Their journey had not been easier, but just that had made it all the more perfect.
“You know anything yet?” Ned asked, already sitting on the couch and zapping through the channels in search of an update on the matter. Shuri sighed and sat on the individual couch next to the one everyone was slowly starting to sit at.
Another chapter! The second one of TWS and also the last! It's still pretty much cannon, but a few things change, specially towards the end
As fun as the night with his friends had been, however, Peter knew he had some important things to do the morning after. So he woke up early enough and swung to the Tower, going straight to the gym to train some of his nervous energy off. Despite the insanely early hour, the young Avenger wasn’t surprised when, near the end of his training, he heard someone going inside the room.
I don't know how many chapter this story is going to be, but at least ten, so... brace yourselves, haha.
“That’s what I think, yeah” Peter nodded “. And I feel so… selfish. I know this is partly not my fault, and I know Harry was using me as well, but… well, I think I latched onto him so desperately because he was, in a way, solid ground. And I have to figure out how big of a part that played in our relationship. I know I had feelings for him, but… I don’t know how big those were, or how much I fixated on them because it felt like something normal”
Don't worry, the sequel is coming up FAST. I will ask you guys when you prefer it to be posted on the last chapter.
“Aunt May” Peter groaned very much like a fifteen year old and not the close to thirty year old man he was close to be. May laughed softly at that and looked at her nephew in wonderment “. What?” He asked, curiosity dancing in his brown eyes, making the nurse smile even softer.
Around midday, Shuri quickly showered and changed into something a bit comfier, and made her way back to the med bay, wishing to see how Peter was. However, she ran into Pepper Potts just in front of Peter’s hospital door.
“Hey, Baby Punk” Bucky said, smiling bigger than before and getting close to Peter. The genius answered with a much more sincere smile, letting Bucky hug him for a couple of minutes and not fussing when he also looked him over in search for injuries.
“And then multiply it by ten” the engineer chuckled “. But I guess that’s what we signed for, huh? Twenty-five years ago, which… doesn’t seem real, not really”
“On it” both his parents said, immediately taking off. Spider-Man limped until he was next to Bucky, resting a hand on his shoulder.
All of his friends felt themselves break a bit for Peter - especially Shuri, Flash, Ned, and MJ, who were all too aware of the complicated story between the two. Harley also suffered for his brother, but he himself hadn’t known every detail about the relationship, only what Peter had told him - enough to know it had created beef between fathers and son.
“Fine, I guess” he shrugged “. It sucks, because I’m going to miss Shur, but I understand why she’s doing this, and I think it’s more than okay”
“I was stabbed” Peter murmured, figuring he could be honest with his friends; not only because they were going to support him and not tell anyone, but also because the footage of the battle was being constantly discussed and analyzed… his friends knew pretty much everything, the only thing Peter was doing was clearing things up, which he guessed his friends deserved “. The blade had some type of venom, which went into my blood and caused my healing system to go into shock… not to mention my body was already pretty battered, so my super healing had already been working non-stop to fix that. The stab just caused an overdrive, I guess. Doctor Cho and Godfather Bruce are still trying to understand that one”
“Good. Now I think it’s time to go back to our family… after all, we do have to celebrate certain someone’s twenty-fourth birthday, don’t we?” Steve smiled, making his husband laugh, and their son open his mouth in surprise.
I hope you enjoyed the chapter! A lot happened here, and it was a bit longer than usual, but hey... I have more time on my hands now.
“It’s not looking good,” Karen said, sounding a weird mix between sad and urgent “. The knife pierced through vitals organs and his heart is not pumping enough blood to keep his body functioning. He’s going to pass soon, Peter”
Okay, so I kind of want to explain myself. I know I could've done it differently, but at the same time: this is kind of logic, for me. Fury wanted them to rest, to make sure they're fine, and we're living in the social media era. It made sense for Steve to search for info about his family, and for him to find it like that. Dunno, it's something I'd never really done, and it seemed interesting, haha. Hope you guys liked it.
I can't promise when the next chapter will be, because I want to make the last chapters as special as possible, and I do have a surprise for the last one... so I hope to see you soon, and I promise I'll make it count!
anyway, please leave a comment to let me know what you thought about this chapter, and thank you so much for reading!
“Wait, like they’d be in training?” Bucky asked, trying to understand his nephew’s words. Peter beamed at him in response, glad his Uncle had caught up so quickly.
“Sorry” the Princess exclaimed, immediately breaking the hug. Then, just for good measure, she punched Peter’s shoulder (albeit a bit gentler than she usually was, at least).
Sorry for not posting last Saturday; I've been having a few... big days, let's say. A lot of things have been happening, not all of them good, so I was not able to post when I had to. Anyway, writing is what makes everything better, so don't worry: I may miss a day, but I'm still here!
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter! Finally, the family knows what's happening! Now Peter has to tell May AND Ned, and we'll be fine.
“So much so that he quit everything” Electro chuckled “. Do we know what the Avengers think of this?”
Tony and Steve had been way too far from their son when the battle had ended, although conscious enough to know what was happening - they knew they had to get to their kid as soon as possible, especially after FRIDAY confirmed Tony of Harry’s passing. For when they could do so, they located Peter in Bucky’s arms, trying to fight him off and screaming in pain. They ran towards them as fast as they could but, not even six feet away from both, Peter went limp in Bucky’s arms. The look of worry in the super soldier’s face was enough to make the husbands sick with worry as well.
Shuri had nodded, grabbing Peter’s hand after a short hesitation before daring to speak “. It’s been a long time since we spoke about this” she’d said “, and I know things have changed. You saw other people, I saw other people, but… we still were there for each other, still cared, so… I need to ask you this, Peter. Do you still have feelings for me?”
Anyway, PLEASE leave a comment to tell me what you thought. Things are going to start happening now in this story, and fast... so be prepared.
Anyway, this chapter is also fluff! I know, I know, I've been giving you a lot of fluff lately... it must be the season, I guess.
So, a bit of a filler chapter, but i really wanted them to have this conversation. besides, the next scenes have to be together, and this alone was almost 3.5k... i didn't want to make the chapter too long, so i split it up in two. also, all the guesses it'd be bucky were right... but who else could it be if not him haha
From there, it’d been easy. Peter wasn’t a kid anymore, that was painfully clear, and the constant presence of Shuri in his life made things a tad bit harder, but nothing Harry couldn’t work through. He’d managed to create a bridge between Peter and his parents and close ones without even trying - surely he could do the same once again, right? He owed his Dad at least that. So he insisted, made sure to listen to Peter when it seemed like the world was, once again, too heavy.
“Yeah, he got that from Tony,” Pepper said, sighing dejectedly “. The one thing we can do is be there for him… and help him when things get rough”
“Yeah” Peter nodded “. Which is sometimes a bit unsettling, you know?” Both of his parents nodded to his question, knowing perfectly what their son meant. With their lives, too much peace sometimes felt wrong… and wasn’t that just messed up “. Other than Shur leaving for Wakanda, everything seems pretty… normal”
However, the other day I just had this idea that wouldnt get out of my head, so I thought: bah, just write it down. And, here we are. I really hope you guys like it, but, something quick:
“Maybe we should do so” the Captain murmured “because we both know whatever’s happening has Harry Osborn written all over it”
“We were,” Flash said, gesturing between them “, those two were still sixteen-year-old babies” he added, pointing to MJ and Peter, who rolled their eyes in response. Still, Ned was right: they were
Next chapter is here, and the battle of Wakanda is about to start! In the next chapter we'll go back to Team Titan, in what is one of my favorite chapters!
Anway, PLEASE leave a comment so I know what you guys thought of the chapter! It'd mean a lot, thanks!
Gosh, so sorry, I've been a mess lately. College in Europe is more exigent than in America, and the workload is more... a lot more. I try to write as much as I can, but sometimes I'm too tired to do so... so if you guys are patient, then I'll love you all forever
You can always leave requests, although you may need to wait a bit. I'm almost finished with the next one shot, but I won't be uploading it for some days, as I'm also writing the story that I have (if you haven't checked it out yet, do it, please!)
“I knew that” Peter had said, nodding. And really, he’d done so, but… with Shuri there things had been incredibly good. The genius had helped him in everything he’d needed, had been his rock and sometimes one of his anchors to sanity, so in a way losing her was a bit rough “. I think we both knew this couldn’t be forever, but…”
Really hope you guys enjoyed the chapter and liked what I decided to do. Now you guys see why I said Bucky was going to be key for this story. Reeeeally hope you guys like my idea, and the role he's going to play.

“Calm down,” Shuri told him - trying to calm herself down as well. She knew she was capable enough to go and fight alongside Peter, knew she could figure something out and go help her best friend. However, she also remembered Bucky’s words, and she knew she had to trust the super-soldier “. I’m sure the Avengers will do something soon, they wouldn’t leave Peter fighting alone”
Hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! If so, PLEASE leave a comment, or kudo, or -if you can- both! Thank you so much for reading, see you soon!
“Okay” Peter whispered, quickly processing the information (not like he hadn’t known it before, but a reminder was always good) and smiling at his Aunt when she raised a perfect eyebrow towards him, even when he knew it looked more like a grimace “. I got it, Pep, no need to worry”
“You tried to kill me” Peter murmured “, and then you… then we fought and the knife went through your chest, Harry”
Ta-da! I hope you guys enjoyed the chapter! Next one opens with a scene I really like that, actually, was supposed to be in this chapter- ultimately I decided to not put it in, because it'd make this chapter way too long.
So sorry for the irregular updates; don't worry, this Saturday I will post again, so we're back on track. Enjoy this chapter and please, DON'T forget to leave a comment to let me know what you thought of the chapter!
So, let me tell you this, guys: something amazing happened to me on Monday. I met Sebastian Stan. So, as you guys probably know, I'm studying away from my home for a few months, in Toronto actually. I'd heard Seb was gonna be here for TIFF, and I thought about meeting him, but at the same time I was like: there's not a chance, c'mon. But on Monday a friend of mine decided to go to Toronto to try to meet Ryan Gosling. Sadly, we didn't meet him, but I found out the premiere for Destroyer was the same day, in a close place. So, I convinced my friend and went there. The premiere was kind of late, it was raining and chilly. We were standing across the street from the theatre, and when Seb got out of the car the fans were pure madness. He was the only actor who started taking pics with people and hugging the fans that were too nervous, and then the Papi Chulo crossed the freaking street to meet the fans that were waiting for him (including me!). He was super nice, and he thanked us for being there a lot of times. It was amazing. He's prettier in person and smells super nice and he's truly one of the sweetest human beings I've ever met. And I have a pic with him, which is awesome. So yeah, just wanted to tell you guys that we Stan the right man: the only actor who took the time to cross the street, take a pic and thank the fans. Gosh, what an angel.
“At least partly” Peter nodded “, but that doesn’t make it easier, Uncle B. It just means I could excuse my actions then, and that I
“How are you holding up, Bambi?” He asked, gentle. Peter thought, only for a brief moment, about telling his parents and uncle he was okay, pretend he was feeling confident about the press conference and the words he had memorized days prior. However, after everything that had happened in the past few weeks, he knew better than that.
Ned hummed, thinking his best bro’s words over for a couple of minutes “. I want double what I’m making at my current company” he finally said. Harley scoffed at his words, laying back in the couch while he crossed his arms across his chest.
Hope you guys liked it! This, as I said, finishes TWS. So, to those wondering what will happen with CW, I'm not following the movie, because so many things are different, right now. But the next chapters will focus on Steve trying to know what to do, and then doing it. Question is, will he tell Tony?
I still don't know how many parts this will be, even though I have it finished lmao. Don't know when I'll upload the rest, too. I'm uploading today because I did my first final and it went well, so I had a little bit of time. So, yeah... I'll try to post as soon as I can or it's possible, but we'll see.
Hi guys! I know the posting time is on Saturday, but rn I don't even know what day I'm living in. Also, I'll answer the comments asap, sorry!
“Only because grief did this to him” Peter pointed out, knowing he wasn’t winning that argument and yet not wanting to admit so “. I know he… I know he did some bad things, but he didn’t deserve to die, he just… deserved help”
“Deal” MJ agreed, shaking hands with the genius. Peter smiled at her once again and squeezed the hand he was still holding, causing butterflies to explode in her stomach.
. Still, I’ve been postponing a meeting like this since November, so… I kinda brought this upon myself”
“I think so” Peter nodded. And then, after just a second: “. Yeah, I will. I think it’s the best for me, given everything”
“Is this move definitive? Like, are you not coming back to New York?” He’d asked, fearing the answer. Shuri had shrugged, playing with some inexistent loose end in her shirt.
“Right” Shuri nodded, extracting her hand from Peter’s (which had stung, but had been totally understood)”, so… I guess we’re sort of right person, wrong time?”
“From everyone” Peter shrugged “. But that’s not the main thing here, just what made me realize I have to talk through everything that is bothering me right now so I can heal from everything that has happened these past months”
I love writing some Shuri/Peter in here. What's their ship name, does anyone know it? If so let me know!
So, a few things: first, sorry for not uploading last week. I had a tough week, full of projects and readings and whatnot, and I didn't find the time to write. Even more so, the time I did have I used it to sleep because believe me, I needed. To know something important about this story, however, please read the note at the end. Thanks!
“Glad to see you made it home in one piece” Peter said for a greeting, going to hug Bucky and then Sam.
” Bucky said, ignoring his nephew’s interruption and effectively shutting him up “. Every year since it’d happened, and since I was conscious enough to remember what day it was, I kept tormenting myself with it, almost getting sick over it, and that wasn’t healthy”
And done! I know some of you ask me about what was going to happen, and for me this was it. I mean, Peter's been the one to search for his parents, AND to go to their house to talk to them. It was time for the Superhusbands to step up and act like Peter's parents.
[TW: SERIOUS TOPIC] I don't know how many of you are aware of what's going on in the States right now, but I am assuming (and also hoping) a large fair amount of you are informed of what has been going on. Personally, I do not live in the States (nor America), nor am I black. I do, however, have members of my family who are black. Regardless of that, defending Black Lives should not be something this controversial. BLACK. LIVES. MATTER. Period. There is NO discussion to that, and I mean fucking *zero* discussion to that. It is not an ideology, it's human decency, and human rights. It's unbelievable we still have to protest this, it's crazy there are people still defending otherwise. Let me tell you: you are not better because you are white. You are no better because of the fucking color of your skin, and if you do believe that, educate yourself. I do believe we have to educate ourselves way more (me included, you can ALWAYS educate yourself one step further), and that racism is something taught, and a pandemic in itself.
“What is it?” Peter asked again, propping himself against the headboard and letting Bucky sit next to him, accepting the phone he was handing him with a furrowed brow “. Did Harry do something else last night?”
“Yeah” Harley admitted “. Peter made me promise I’d keep the secret for him and would help him, not many questions asked. And I don’t completely know
I hope you guys liked the chapter! Next one, we're back on Titan! And start to prepare yourself, angst is coming...
“Okay,” Peter nodded. And then, just because he was too tired, he decided to speak up “. Can I tell you something now, though?”
Hi guys! Sorry again for being late, I was at my friend's house on Saturday and forgot to post. Anyway, here's the chapter, enjoy!
; he was tired of always having to be the hero, of choosing and fearing every consequence that came after his decisions, tired of losing friendships and relationships thanks to his alter ego, he just… he was really tired.
PLEASE leave a comment and kudos if you can/want! Things are starting to differ from the film and it'll keep beeing that way the rest of the story!
“Can’t do” Norman murmured “. And you know why, Harry. You know why I’m here, don’t you? You know” he said, a bit louder, a bit closer, a bit more suffocating “ I’m here because,
so, i know, a bit of a cliffhanger. i honestly was going to include whatever happens next in this chapter, but it was going to be too long, and the next chapter too short, so i changed it up. sorry not really sorry.
“Yeah, a few months before” Peter nodded “. We got so close at first because May and Ben left me with the Leeds every time they needed to do some paperwork. Turns out, getting custody of your adopted nephew while sorting through every legal thing you have to do once someone dies it’s… a bit complicated. But, that isn’t my point. Harry and Ned were not the same. They’re not now, either”

“This is your team, Spider-Man” Steve reminded him, resting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing it “, and they’re always going to help you out, no matter how little or big the problem is”
“You can count on it” Peter laughed, standing up when one of his best friends did so as well “. Coffee tomorrow? Ned wanted to try a new one”
First of all: I know it's been, like, forever. I have an excuse, though. I'm writing a story (that I'm already publishing, if you wanna check out), and I got super into it, so I didn't have time to write more one shots. Once I finish it, I'll go back to the usual posting here, but meanwhile... I'm focusing on that one.
“Yeah, I know” Peter nodded, giving the phone back to his Uncle when it felt too heavy and too hot to still be in his hands“, but… I can’t stay mad. I know MJ didn’t do it with bad intentions, she just… took the opportunity to publish an article. It’s good for her career”
Now, I don't want to tire you guys all out with this A/N (and who knows if someone even read it), but: I didn't post on Wednesday because I was trying to spread the word about BLM in my other socials. Now that I am posting here, I think I should do the same thing here, because, no matter the size, I do have a platform. So: if you want to go and protest, do it, but please, be safe. I can't go, mainly because there are no protests where I live (again, not in the US, or even America). But there are other ways in which you can help.
