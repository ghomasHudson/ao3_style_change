“What the hell are you two talking about?” Natasha asks, looking at both of them. "Not all of us have a telepathic connection with each other."
“Thank you, sweetheart,” he replied.
“That’s what I thought. What brought this on, man?"
“My punctuality is part of my charm.”
"No," Steve said and stooped down to retrieve his waterskin. "I need to pay more attention to my surroundings, apparently."
1. If you've been here from the very beginning you may have noticed that the rating has changed from Teen and Up to Explicit. That's because while developing this fic, I was debating on whether or not to include a possible sex scene in the story. I have now made up my mind and decided to include the sex scene but trust me it won't be for a

in front of Steve, and he's in love with him, and he doesn't know what's worse.
“Captain Rogers?” JARVIS said. Steve swore he heard a hint of concern in his voice. “ I believe you are experiencing another panic attack. Would you like me to get Mr. Stark?”
Tony missed Happy. His missed his tough, no nonsense (okay, maybe a

“Oh my God,” Steve said, dragging his hand down his face. “Okay,” he said, reaching for Tony.
Happy reading!
Tony hummed, releasing Steve reluctantly. “That’s the plan, Rogers,”
"How could I make it up to you?" Steve says, his eyes not so subtly shifting down to look at Tony's lips.

That had been three months ago. And Tony…Tony knew Steve’s body just as well as he knew his own now.

"Brooke is one of the strongest kingdoms in the realm. People envy her wealth and prosperity, and for that, they will try to destroy her. We cannot afford to be weak," his father had told him when the war with Ma'Hat had first started. Five years ago, in what was supposed to be peaceful trade talks, the king of Ma'Hat had Brooke's envoys slit at the throat like cattle, and they had been embroiled in war ever since.
As she poured the pot, the fragrant, sweet smell of jasmine hit Steve’s nose. He could smell something else, too—lavender? Jasmine and lavender. Perhaps he was reading too much into it, but he couldn’t help but feel as if she had selected this brew specifically to calm Steve’s nerves. That didn’t bode well.
I'm sorry this is so late but I'm going to try to get back on track! A little warning for this chapter. Spoiler alert, Steve has another panic attack. If something like that might trigger you, it starts at
Bruce is staring down at his plate, poking absentmindedly at his pasta with his fork. "I don't think I should go," he says.
“At least let me get you like a hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something,” he said desperately.
He thinks about rebuilding his mansion in Malibu, but something stops him.
His head's all foggy like he just got up from a nap. He's so out of it, he doesn't even realize that the others are walking up to his booth. Tony blinks slowly, trying to ignore the pressure building in his forehead, a sure sign of a headache.
“Yes," Tony slurred out. "Missed you so fucking much. Harder,” Tony slurred out. “Please, I want…I need—“
late but its complete now! I apologize for the brief hiatus but I wanted to get Tony's POV exactly right and after writing for Steve for so long, I may or may not have struggled. Before you guys start the chapter, you need to know a couple of things.
Tony faced Bucky next, and there it was again, that look of familiarity.
Carmen tilts her head at him like she used to whenever she thought he had said something stupid. "You're telling me that those five supermodels you call teammates just came here for shits and giggles?"
The search for Loki had unfortunately bared no results and he and the rest of the Avengers were supposed to see Thor off-world that afternoon. The god was leaving to continue the search for his brother. It seemed as if the god of mischief had vanished into thin air. And seeing as he had disappeared with the Tesseract, that very well could have been their reality. Whatever situation Steve was in, it was painstakingly real.
a dick.
Tony wants to bring up his dream, he wants Steve to reassure him that he'd never hurt him that they're friends and teammates, and they—
“Yes,” Tony replied immediately.
," he thinks.
“Let’s hope that day isn’t soon,” Bucky said coolly.
They didn’t end up leaving their bedroom until well into the afternoon, much to the chagrin of their team who had spent all morning preparing a birthday breakfast for Steve.
“But it was so fun,” Steve replies, playing along.
“I just needed to know…” Steve hesitates, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand. “Did I...did I do something wrong?”
coin. He’s one of Madam Natalia’s, and if it gets out that one of her clients went back on a transaction…”
He retracts his helmet, lets himself breathe. The air is stale and dank, reminding him far too much of Afghanistan for his taste.
It’s movie night because they have those now, and their little group is bigger than normal. Pepper, Rhodey, and Sam have all made an appearance. Pepper and Rhodey were at the tower for Stark Industries business and stayed around longer than necessary to check in on Tony, much to his visible delight. Sam had come to visit Steve (and check out the tower. Steve was sure any day now, Sam would accept their offer and officially join the team) and had a few more days before it was time for him to go back to D.C.
The words sounded fake to Tony’s ears. Surely, JARVIS was joking? But no, he wouldn’t joke with Tony, at least not about something like this. But him, Tony Stark having an anxiety attack…it was unheard of.
Tony spent the rest of the afternoon locked up in his workshop doing what he did best; inventing. And avoiding his problems. But mainly inventing.
“It’s date night, sir,” JARVIS pointed out. “I believe she has to conduct one more meeting for the day.”
Okay, they could probably come up with a better pun. But all the less, were he a religious man, he would’ve thanked God that he had decided to don a hoodie, sunglasses, and baseball cap himself today.
Tony blinked, looking incredibly small in his blanket. “You seem mad but like twenty jokes just went through my head and not saying them might literally kill me.”
Bruce reddens, and Tony doesn't feel so alone because it looks like Bruce has his own beefy blond problem he needs to deal with. "Sure, since you asked," Bruce responds, leaving just...Steve.
“Why,” he had said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Why would you do that?”
“Please don’t say magic, it gives me hives,” Tony said.
Rhodey’s brows had furrowed as he looked Tony over. Did he…did he not know who Tony was? “Howard…” Rhodey had said before his eyes widened.
He makes it to his workshop uninterrupted and strips, uncaring of who might see him. His workshop is
"I can't picture you as a little troublemaker," Tony says softly.
“I was simply wondering if his Highness had been satisfied.”
He had pondered the thought of doing as Steve had asked him to for exactly two seconds before deciding to mess with him anyway. His plan, while simple, was genius, of course.
In that moment, Tony can’t help but think of what Howard would say if he saw them. “Quit being childish,’ he would sneer, his face turning down into a frown Tony was all too familiar with. “This behavior is unfitting of a Stark.”
"Your suit," Thor says. "Can you fly?"
Thor gripped his hand in a firm handshake, “Captain. It’s good to see you. All of you.”
Tony swallows his pride and sets the dish down in front of Pepper anyway and tries not to fall apart when she asks him what it is.
“Of course. How silly of me to forget.”
Tony leaned down finally,
They elect Thor to nudge Bruce awake, who looks at them with bleary eyes and his hair askew.
Before Steve could answer, Rumlow butted back in, “Forget the sword. How does it feel to finally be a man?”
“You do it too, asshole,” Tony said, stomping into the little kitchenette of his penthouse suite. Opening a cabinet, he stood on his tiptoes to reach for the bag of coffee grounds that had been placed on the highest shelf. “Stupid short legs,” Tony muttered. “JARVIS, who even put the coffee grounds on the top shelf?”
“What did you just say?”
, yet the thought of walking into the little two story building daunted him.
Rumlow grumbled something under his breath before stalking over to the other side of the clearing where Steve’s father and his advisers stood.
Finding homes for the other dogs had gone smoothly, with two Stark Industries employees taking home one a piece and Clint, surprisingly, taking the last pup.
“That’s okay,” AJ said, seeing their discomfort. “No need to answer me right now.”
“Your Highness,” Tony said.
“And ripping it away from them in the same second,” Steve mutters. “It’s disgusting.”
the damn thing and if it were up to him, he would have willed it out of existence entirely. And the thought of going back to the 70s without Tony by his side…it filled him with more dread than he cared to admit.
. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. Me? I’m just a man in a can,” he said. It was like now that he had started, he couldn’t be stopped and everything that he had been holding in for the past four months came rushing out of his mouth. “The only reason I haven’t cracked up is probably because we moved in together. Which is great. I love you, I’m lucky. But honey,” Tony took Pepper’s hands in his own. “I can’t sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.” Tony paused. “But threat…threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can’t live without.” He pointed at Pepper’s heart. “That’s you. And my suits, they’re—”
Tony also has a nightmare that triggers him. The scene starts at
“Oh my God,” Natasha said, face-palming.
Tony’s brain short-circuited. One more word out of Steve’s mouth and he was going to come all over his desk. Years ago, Tony would have felt ashamed at how much he wanted Steve, how much he begged. Tiberius Stone and Sunset Bain had made sure of that. But Steve was different; he teased Tony because Tony
" He thinks to himself on occasion. Rhodey and Happy and Pepper come to mind then. Tony's relationships with them are warm and familiar, rooted in years of misadventures with each other. Being with them is as comforting as sitting by a fireplace.
Tony doesn’t have an answer.
“And did you say no?”
Rhodey’s grin quickly melts from his face and is replaced with a look of utter terror as 120 pounds of pure spite land on him with the deftness of jungle cat.
Tony makes up his mind the week before midterms.  He’s killing it in Calculus and Biology couldn’t be easier, but if he has to read one more passage of Hemingway’s bland, uninspiring prose, Tony’s going to rip his hair out.
2. We have officially entered Phase 2 of the MCU in don't blink! These next few chapters are gonna be Tony's POV but don't worry Steve's POV might make an appearance.
“I admit it. My fault,” He held up his hands in surrender. “I’m sorry.”
Tony looked over to his left where U had been left in charge of the camera. “Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence.” Tony raised his hands and the suit hummed to life.
Dugan's blue eyes visibly brightened at the sight of him. "Sire!" Dugan said, cutting off Rumlow in the middle of his tale.
Steve’s cock looked thick, even wrapped in his large hand. The tip, wet with pre-come, was positively
because Steve is so fucking cute and sweet, and how did the hell did he end up in Tony's life?
“I want you in my mouth too,” Tony admitted. “I want you to make me gag and I want your come sliding down my throat.”

JARVIS displays a picture of Elena on the flat-screen built into the wall of the boardroom.

of his parents had left him to fend for himself. A dark cloud had gathered over Tony’s head anyway.
“It wasn’t your fault, trust me,” Tony says. “I just feel like maybe you didn’t want to jump headfirst into
Steve never finishes his sentence as Tony's tongue slinks into his mouth. Steve moans, kissing him back. One of his hands finds Tony's cock. Tony bucks into his fist, still slick with lube, digs his nails into Steve's back until they're both falling apart. Steve comes inside him with a muffled groan, filling him with a wet heat; meanwhile, Tony feels like his brain is leaking from his ears as his come spurts from his cock and paints both of their stomachs in white.
And they were fighting again. It didn’t take much to get either of them going, Tony mused.
“Watch your tongue,” Steve whispered fiercely, his eyes darting to the door. He could make out a shadow through the crack of the threshold; a guard.
"Smart boy," Carmen says. "Any questions, comments, or concerns you want to pass along?"
“Candied yams?” Tony asks. The name evokes feelings of joy and sugar and well, Tony’s always had sweet tooth. His interest is piqued.
"Tony!"
“Tony, I ate boiled potatoes for nearly twenty six years of my life. If you think I’m going to keep up that habit when I have the entire world’s food at my finger tips, you’re not as much of a genius as I thought,” he said, carrying two plates loaded down with pasta to the small square dining table near the kitchenette.
So…is this something y’all would be interested in reading? I have a lot of ideas in my head right now but it’d be cool to know that there’s an audience for it. Comments, kudos, and bookmarks aren’t required but are much appreciated!
JARVIS breaks the little spell that has washed over them and reminds them that they need to eat at
“I am,” Tony said. “And I’ve heard stories about you, Sir Brock.”
“Don’t be,” Steve said under his breath so only Tony could hear him. “It serves him right.”
“But first,” Steve said. “I’m gonna teach you a lesson. You need to learn some patience, baby.”
"Your Highness," Rumlow said, bowing before him. The others, save for his father, quickly followed suit.
Tony’s eyes darted down, looking at his feet. “No,” he replied. “I’m just Tony.”
Steve held back a shiver. He didn’t like the way she looked at him, like she could see
“No harm done,” Tony says coolly. On the inside, he’s trying not to scream. He had forgotten that Steve’s hands were so
Tony shakes his head. “I’m not talking about the Avengers. I’m talking about you and me. We’re a team. And you made a promise, mister.” He pokes Steve in his chest.
“Yes. What.”
. That's all that matters. You and me."
Dodger licked at Tony’s finger who grimaced and wiped the slobber off on his jeans. “Gross.”
“Is that so?”
“Yeah. You’re good,” Tony says and finally relaxes in Steve’s grasp.
“Oh, trust me, I will,” Steve muttered, drinking anyway.  The wine was sweet but rich, coating his tongue more so than the mead. “How long am I to have my little
"Steve, I want—"
Unwinding her fingers from his, Pepper wrapped her arms around his neck. Her hands carded through his hair, fingers firm but gentle against his scalp. Tony closed his eyes and rested his head against her chest. He breathed in the scent of her perfume—she smelled good, like jasmine and roses—and tried his best to just bask in the moment. A trimmer had come to his hands again. He didn’t know if he was on the edge of an anxiety attack or coming off one.
So, this chapter is a bit shorter than what you guys might be used to from me, but I feel like it was better this way, rather than trying to cram a bunch of things into it, given how intense the last chapter was. Not too much to say, except I changed the chapter count again, so make of that what you will.
“Fine,” she says. “Keep your secrets.” Somehow she makes it sound like a threat.
“Stop, sweetheart,” Steve said. “I swear one of these days that mouth of yours is gonna kill me.”
The green flecks in Steve’s eyes are brighter than ever as he places a hand across Tony’s chest and urges him to lie down. Steve’s hand is big, big enough to cover the sunburst-esque scar left behind by the arc reactor. The last time they were this close, Steve was driving a shield down into his chest. Tony remembered hearing the crack of glass and the grating crunch of metal against metal and thinking that his heart had been split in half as well.
“Don’t run,” Steve says. His arms wind around Tony’s waist with all the finality of a lock clicking into place.
After all they had done, Tony had the good grace to blush. "No need...I came with you." And surely enough, Tony had spilled into his own hand. Steve had been so caught up in his own pleasure that he hadn't even noticed.
“Steve,” Tony said, looking at him with wide eyes. “You

As he fell down, down, down, he thought it was funny he could hear someone shouting his voice.
, he thought bitterly.
“You would send me away so soon?”
Tony spent the rest of the night in his bedroom alone with nothing but metal and his mind.
Tony's toes curl as he nods and lets the moans he was holding back slip from his mouth untethered. If anything, they spur Steve on. His bed squeaks with each thrust, and Tony can hear Steve mumbling under his breath, a litany of "I need you," and "So tight, so
Bringing the needle gun to his forearm, without hesitating, Tony pulled the trigger, successfully injecting the micro repeater into his bloodstream.

Except when Steve breaks their kiss to lift him up by his thighs and walk them over to his massive bed...when he lays Tony down gently like he's something precious...it doesn't feel like messing around anymore. Messing around put him in the mind of two teenagers fumbling around the backseat of a car, desperate to get themselves off and themselves only.
Steeling himself, Tony had shrugged. “Don’t know, don’t care. Howard and mom are always busy.”
“No, J,” Tony said decisively. “He’s busy anyway. I doubt he has any time for me.”
Steve frowned, not afraid to let his distaste show. Castle servants, while still servants, had easier lives than the peasants who toiled in the fields, so how was it, his personal manservant was only eating two meals a day?
“They’re good pups,” the man beside the box had said, puffing on a cigarette. “They cost a pretty penny though.”
“With pleasure, Captain.”
Rhodey was followed by Bruce, who had been slowly emerging from his self-induced exile in the tower to spend time with Tony which then meant spending time with Steve. Or maybe it was the other way around. With the re-emergence of Bruce, Steve was allowed into their joint lab (he, sadly, still had yet to see Tony’s personal workshop). Watching Tony and Bruce work together was mesmerizing. In the less hectic moments, where Tony and Bruce were experimenting just for the sake of experimenting, Steve would occasionally join in, asking questions or passing them tools or poking fun at Tony, while Bruce looked on in barely veiled amusement. In other moments when their inventing took a more serious turn, such as when Tony and Bruce had been working together to figure out what stimuli made the Hulk revert back to Bruce with the least amount of resistance, Steve took to simply watching and sketching. His sketchbook now had many a picture of Tony and Bruce’s dark heads bent together in discovery. He found he enjoyed the quiet moments the most. Moments where it was just him and his pencil gliding along the paper like a figure skater upon ice.
He pushed all thoughts of anxiety attacks and New York and aliens from his mind, instead choosing to focus on the ventilation system of all of his suits. He had felt so short of breath in the suit. It was like all of the air in his lungs had been sucked out by some great hulking beast into its own greedy chest. Another idea floated at the edge of his mind as he worked. At Murray’s, Tony had been frozen in time as if someone had put glue down on his chair beforehand. And the suit had been so far away…
Tony would hardly call it a kiss. Kisses were sweet, romantic things that left you giggling and breathless. No, this was a
“Hallucination?”
you,” Steve said, a sneer twisting his handsome face. “Do you want to show them, huh? Wanna show them how much of a slut you are?”
“Two,” Steve said and he tried his best to focus on Tony’s voice, his eyes, his everything. He reached out blindly for one of Tony’s hands and the other man immediately grasped his, intertwining their fingers.
“You didn’t see them before,” Romanov says, leaning back into her seat. “Rogers wouldn’t touch Stark with a ten-foot pole.”

“You missed me that bad? Poor baby,” Steve mocked him and it was mean just how Tony liked it, enough to have him pushing back against Steve's fingers.
“Captain, are you alright?” Not for the first time that day, one Natasha Romanoff caught him off guard, approaching him with slow steps.
“That will be all, Agent Hill.”
pleasure watching you work.”
Servants weren’t handsome silver-tongued devils sent to plague his very existence.
It wouldn’t be long before both of them fell over the edge. His heart hammered so loud he swore he could hear it in his ears. His cock throbbed, aching for release.
Natasha feigned looking hurt. “I thought you liked my driving, Barton.”
The genuine confusion in Tony’s voice broke his heart. Did he honestly think no one could do something nice for him without expecting something in return?
“Such sass. Do you hear this?” Tony asked, turning to Steve, finally giving up on reaching the grounds. “JARVIS went all Skynet on me. Wait, you don’t understand that reference, do you?”
Tony let out a bitter laugh. “Haven’t you heard, Cap? Iron Man, yes, Tony Stark not recommended? I thought Natasha’s report was pretty telling. You’ll be fine. Rhodey has the War Machine armor and JARVIS can pilot any of the suits.”
“Tony,” Tony answered, with none of the warmth he had shown Steve.
That made Tony pause. “His what?”
"A ground assault would be suicide," Tony says, rising from his seat to take a closer look at the hologram. Steve moves over, making room for Tony to stand beside him. "They could have bunkers, watchguards, tanks, the works. We'd be fish in a barrel."
Steve nodded and briefly set the suitcase down to activate the quantum realm suit.
"Not long," Tony snarls and rounds the corner with Steve and Thor flanking him. One of the agents who abandoned the machine gun has a regular pistol aimed right at Tony. Steve moves like lightning, lifting his shield in front of Tony. The bullet ricochets and lodges into the agent's skull.
“What?” Steve asked, his eyes all wide like he was innocent. Please.
Natasha rolled her eyes, but he saw a familiar glint in them that after years of knowing her, knew it meant she was amused by something. “Stark. He’s determined on trying shawarma. Says he’ll die without it.”
Steve flinched. Turning around, he saw Tony standing on the outskirts of their little group. Conversations ground to halt once more, his father and his advisers stopping to observe the latest distraction.
Even Bruce had to stifle a chuckle.

Steve felt a chill go down his spine. Natasha had just…she had just…
"Tony," she says in that way of hers that usually means she's worried about him, and Tony's heart twists. "Is everything okay?"
“Are you asking me to stay, Your Highness?”
“I made Irish stew, soda bread and for dessert I was thinking of shortbread and Irish coffee?” Tony bites his lip and his eyes are impossibly wide as he looks up at Steve. “Is that okay?”
"No," he replies. "Carmen Solomita's. She's big on philanthropy, always trying to help out in some way or another. She's always been like that."
“They’re absolute disasters,” Tony had said fondly one day to Steve, when Dodger and DUM-E had bumped into each other while trying to grab a wrench.
he’s talking in circles. Every muscle in his body is taut, waiting for Steve’s reaction.
Disclaimer: I don't own anything related to Marvel or the MCU, this is all just for funsies ✌
Tony yelps and nearly drops the fresh loaf of soda bread he pulled from the oven when he sees Steve standing in the kitchen.
Carmen pounces on him, full-on throwing her arms around Tony's neck. Tony catches her no problem and—Carmen's mood is so
Tony wonders where the others are and waits for a surge of red mist, or a gun or arrow or both to be aimed his way.
“Bucky,” Tony confirms.
And it was the truth. Steve remembered the day clearly. It had been some time after he had come out of the ice. He had had no friends to see, no family to visit, no missions and was at a complete and utter loss at what to do with himself. The bike had been sitting in a junkyard, an old forgotten relic from the past and he knew he couldn’t just leave it there to rot. It had taken him some time to fix it on his own, but it had given him something to do.
"Steve," Carmen says. "I know you're an artist. Think you could do caricatures slash portraits?"
One woman, who introduced herself as Chris, had shoulder length black hair and a prosthetic arm. The man with sandy-blonde hair in a buzz-cut called himself Jackson. He seemed to be a bit older (physically, anyway) than Steve and sat with his shoulders hunched forward as if he were trying to make himself smaller.
Steve barely reacts as Tony plops right down in the seat directly across from him; his hand resting on the table clenches into a fist, near imperceptible if you knew what signs to look for.
God, Steve’s eyes were practically black now, his irises stretched into a thin ring. Steve slipped two fingers into Tony’s mouth, Tony parting his lips with no hesitation. Steve’s fingers, like the rest of him, were big, stretching Tony’s lips. Tony sucked obediently, his tongue licking at the space in between Steve’s fingers before trailing back up to circle the tips. When Steve pulled his fingers away, they left a trail of saliva running down Tony’s chin.
Friendly reminder that I don't own Marvel or the MCU or anything related to it, and this is all for fun. Hope you guys like this one 💖.
Steve cut Tony off before he could finish, working a third finger into Tony. His fingers were already so thick, it wasn’t fair that Steve knew just how to work them to leave Tony a trembling mess.
As he's finishing up, he overhears Natasha say, "Oh, my God."
Tony’s ready to metaphorically and physically throw up his hands at this point. “There’s no winning with you is there? No matter what, you’re gonna think you’re right. You’re gonna think signing the Accords was to barter away our freedom and destroying an airport was perfectly justified and leaving me to
“Fuck,” Steve hissed when Tony let his teeth lightly scrape over the flesh of his cock, his hips bucking upward and briefly gagging Tony. “Do that again.”

Thor smiles, looking every inch the god he is. "We'll have a grand time, Doctor Banner."
Warmth bloomed in his chest, and Steve had to school his face from breaking out into a smile. Tony had been
“I know, right? He seems so wholesome,” Rhodey said and threw down his cards.
Returning the Aether had been harder than he had expected. Nobody had told him he had needed to inject the stone back into Jane, and the look of surprise on both their faces at the realization would have been hysterical under literally any other circumstances. Putting the Power stone back into the orb had been easier. He had arrived just as Quill, had landed on the storm battered rock that was Morag singing along (badly) and dancing to his music. In a way the man had reminded him of Tony, and what little amusement he had experienced died just that quickly.
"I can."
than his trauma. The concept was damn near foreign to him. For so long, Steve’s identity had been Captain America, the ideal man, the perfect soldier, and to think that it didn’t have to be the only important thing about him didn’t even cross his mind.
Steve chuckled, ducking his head. "Duly noted. She'd never let you live it down."
"Tony," Steve breathes his name like a prayer, and it's like someone's punched Tony directly in his chest. Every time Steve says his name like
the Avengers, and he doesn't—
was his present. 2023 wouldn’t come for another eleven years.
"J?" he asks. Tony used a separate comms unit precisely for moments like these when his suit might be compromised. "You there, buddy?"
Tony shrugged. “If I ever give up Iron Man, and I don’t think I will, not now, anyway, then maybe. It’s not like I’m hurting for the money.”
“Running away from me, already?” he murmurs into Tony’s ear. Steve’s like a furnace, heat coming off of him in waves. The shower has gone from mildly hot to scorching.
"We'll have the element of surprise on our side," Steve finishes.
Once again, I apologize for the long wait but I'm back now, fully comfortable with Tony's POV, and will hopefully get back to my regular posting schedule, God willing. Thank you to everyone who has left and continues to leave such nice comments at the end of each chapter. They truly mean a lot to me. I hope you all enjoyed Tony's POV and that I did my boy justice. You all know the drill! Kudos, comments, and bookmarks aren't required but they're much appreciated. Follow me on
Sorry, I took a while with this chapter, but hopefully, y'all still enjoyed it. Don't be afraid to let me know what you think! Comments, kudos, bookmarks, etc. are much appreciated.
“And one more for good luck.”
Tony nodded feverishly resting his head against Steve’s thigh, too spent to argue with him. Like he’d fight him on this anyway. “Always,” Tony replied at once. And it was the truth. Perhaps it had been true for a while.
“I asked you a question,” Steve said. “You’re mine. You’re fucking
Within five minutes of meeting, Rhodey had thought he was lost, called him a baby, and told him his dad was a dick.

Guilt settled deep in his stomach. He hadn't meant to ignore his friends; the HYDRA tech had just taken top priority.
“I think there’s a girl in HR who’s trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.” And with that, Tony put his phone in the wine fridge, effectively ending the conversation. Was it a little mean, maybe, but Happy could handle it. He’d been putting up with Tony’s bullshit for years.
The suitcase felt surprisingly light in his hand despite carrying six Infinity Stones. He didn't know what to expect, really, but with a name like “Infinity Stone” Steve thought the case should have felt...heavy. Important. Like it should have equaled the mental weight of having the fate of the universe in one's own hands. It felt like holding air.
Tonight had been an arc reactor night, but instead of Obie betraying him...it was Steve.
Tony’s itching to interrupt him again, to box Steve around the head and yell that he did the best he could, but he knows it would fall on deaf ears. Steve genuinely believed getting frozen in the ice, HYDRA resurging,
Steve doesn’t speak. Tony doesn’t know if he shocked him or offended him, or perhaps Steve was just thinking over what he would say.
"One machine gun down," Tony reports. He stalks over to the HYDRA agent he shot and takes the handgun for himself. Ignoring the agent's blank, dead stare, he looks over the gun, trying to get a feel for how it functions. It's all sleek curves and silver chrome, a current of cobalt energy coursing through it like blood. He aims the gun and pulls what he hopes is the trigger at the gunner. The HYDRA agent screams as Tony's shot makes its target, charring his skin. "Make that two," Tony says. "The north side of the base is clear."
to make it out, but despite his best efforts, he hears the super-soldier say “I love you,” in a voice so ragged it nearly brings tears to Tony’s eyes.
He rises out of his seat and grabs the few dishes that remain. Tony helps Steve load up the dishwasher. He tries not to think about how domestic it all feels, how it's practically become routine for Tony and Steve to look after the others and put away their dishes. He doesn't know what it means, but he has the strangest feeling that Pepper is smiling to herself halfway across the country.
"Hm," Natasha says. Tony's still learning how to speak Natasha fluently, but it's apparently enough for Clint.
He didn’t know when he started considering an ancient being one of his closest friends but he figured between literal gods and talking raccoons, Brita was most definitely on the more normal side of the spectrum.
“Then why haven’t you?”
Tony stared at Steve.
Steve meets his gaze again, and some of the hardness leaves his face. “Of course. The Avengers—“
"Come on," Tony murmurs. "Follow me."
"Why are you doing this?"
"In your dreams," Tony says. Thor lets go of Tony when they're safe to land. Tony rolls into the fall, landing in a crouch. The HYDRA gunman spots them, but before they can pull their handgun sitting at their waist, Tony's already fired two blasts from his repulsor, sending them flying. Thor sends Mjolnir flying through the machine gun, shattering it into hundreds of metal shards sparking and sputtering like the last embers of a fire.
"You're not the only one," Steve said. "But I couldn't leave you to suffer with this lot." He gestured towards Bucky, who drew back, affronted.
“Would you like anything with it? Lemon? Honey?”
“If not a therapist, than at least a support group of some sort,” she said. “Pity, there isn’t a support group for superheroes.”
“Captain,” the woman was kneeling next to him now, placing her gentle hands upon his shoulders. “I can fix this if you will let me.”
He's not an artist, not like Steve, but he understands the appeal of wanting to capture a moment forever in all of its rawness. He wants to get some paints and canvas and immortalize Steve precisely as he is right now: wild and devout. To
A sharp sting to his ass had Tony yelping.
“Children. Complete children,” Natasha muttered.
“You don’t have to commit to it,” she had said. “But
He wants to savor this moment with Steve, wants to live in it for as long as humanly possible, because who knows when they'll get another moment like it. Unfortunately, Tony's discomfort wins out.
Steve swallows. “This isn’t about me.”
By all means, Steve should been at ease. And yet he felt…lost. Like he had been working on a puzzle only to find a piece that didn’t match the rest of the set.
Steve sighs and says, “Tony,” and Tony hates how his Brooklyn accent curls softly around the syllables, sounding all too much like a lover’s caress.
“Go ahead,” Steve says. “Whatever that big brain of yours has in mind.”
“JARVIS, do a full body scan,” he gasped. “Check the heart, check the…check the…is it the brain?”
a herd of deer nearby, along with an abundance of rabbits. Steve could see the visible change in the party, their excitement practically tangible. Nothing made noblemen happier than the thought of killing something.
Yell at me on
“Steven Grant Rogers, if your star-spangled ass doesn’t look at me right now.”
Steve lets go of Tony’s hand and reaches for Tony’s cock. Tony throws his head back against the pillows as Steve’s big hand encompasses him, his hips rising up in time with Steve’s thrusts. Soon, Tony’s fucking himself into the tight circle of Steve’s fist.
Steve knows a little French from his war days, his long, hilarious conversations with Jacques coming to mind. “Everything in its place?”
It was like someone had paused a movie with the way Steve and all the others seemed to freeze at the exact same moment.
,” sounds pathetic, even to his ears.
trying, to make things work ever since they made the move together into his Malibu mansion. For crying out loud, they had date nights. Ten years ago if someone had told Tony that he would be in a healthy, monogamous relationship going on a year he would’ve laughed in their face and asked if he could have some of whatever they were drinking.
Steve double taps the photo, giving it a like before he set his phone down. "I do. I sketch here and there when the inspiration strikes, but I haven't had the time to sit down and really pour myself into it like I used to."
“Yes, sir,” Tony said, silently basking in the growl that had entered Steve’s voice. “We’re far past shyness.”
They stay like that standing out on Tony’s balcony kissing and touching each other and simply
“Pepper. Pepper, wait!”
It seemed like after his panic attack, the flood gates had opened and everything he had been pushing to the back of his mind to deal with later, decided
But judging by the glint that had entered the other man’s dark eyes, Rhodey wouldn’t back down without a fight.
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Steve said, looking up at the ceiling.
Instead, Steve swallows, and in one fluid motion, he's rolling so Tony's beneath him, his arms bracketing Tony's sides.
A deep, genuine laugh bubbled forth from his chest as Bucky finally broke down, and retaliated against Clint, nailing him squarely in the forehead with a strawberry. Steve had been through hell and back again but he had come out stronger for it. They all had. And now…now, they were home.
Steve has that cute little wrinkle in his brow when he's thinking hard about something. His skin burns where it’s pressed against Tony, flushed from the heat of the shower...or maybe Tony’s proximity.
"You have no idea, do you? How gorgeous you are?"
when Tony let him fall out of his mouth to speak.
Steve pushes on. “On the helicarrier...did I come on to you too strong? Because if I did, that wasn’t my intention at all—”
"You were on HYDRA's list," Steve says. The abrupt change in subject leaves him reeling, but he'll hear Steve out. "Project Insight," Steve clarifies.
“Fury isn’t here yet,” Tony says, sounding like a little kid arguing with his sister.
"What would make Prince Steven break?" Tony said, and Steve found himself with a lapful of him. His breath left him all at once.
Pepper blinked owlishly. “What?”
"You didn't," Tony gasps.
That devil’s grin drops just slightly as the word “Rogers” leaves Tony’s mouth. “Would you believe me if I said I was checking up on you?” Steve replies.
The Avengers get a day off and surprisingly nobody gets hurt.
"We're talking right now," Steve says.
” He’s taken on Tony’s terminology.
"Something wrong, Tony?" Steve asks, looking all too innocent as he takes a sip of his soda.
soldier,” Steve had said. “No one ever sees me for me. And I’m thankful for the super serum and the chance it gave me to do good but,” Steve hesitated. “I wish people saw me for me. Not some untouchable ideal man.”
Steve pulls back from their kiss to look at him, and Tony's gone. From Tony's penthouse suite, he has the perfect view of the sun in the evening. It's midday, and the sun, not quite setting, casts shafts of light into his room, catching the blond of Steve's mussed hair until it shines like hammered gold.
created used to paralyze him, the smug, sneering monologue. The only difference is that it's Steve's sky blue eyes full of hate that Tony's staring into as he rips out the one thing keeping him alive.
Steve smiles slightly. Something in his eyes looks wistful. "Thank you," he says.
Spite plus genius-level intellect made for a deadly combination, and Tony had both in spades. He was (rightfully) pissed off because Steve had been gone for two weeks and had dove immediately into his paperwork documenting the mission instead of cuddling with his loving and affectionate boyfriend (the boyfriend being him. It shocked Tony too, sometimes.)
Tony raised his sunglasses onto his forehead, stooped down to get a closer look at Steve’s bike and let out a low whistle. “Is this a ‘57 sportster? Where’d you get one in such good condition?”
Steve had felt good about himself for what seemed like the first time in a while. They had finished working on their last house for the month and a cheery air had followed him for the rest of the day. He was doing good just by being himself, just by being Steve Rogers. He hadn’t been just Steve Rogers in a long time.
Tony.
Eleven years ago, Steve would’ve taken the bait for what it was, but he was older and wiser, and damn near immune to Tony’s ways now. Instead he just shrugged, and said, “Bikes are more up my alley. Believe it or not, we had motorcycles in the forties.”
His break comes faster than he wants it to, but he has to take one eventually and decides the best way to do that is to take a walk. His fellow volunteer, a young man named Jake, says he'll be able to hold down the fort while Tony's gone. Maybe Tony will check on the others, see how they're faring.
Steve wanted to find peace. He wanted to find peace and rest like the rest of them.
When the debriefing is adjourned, he comes away with three things. First, someone ratted them out. Second, if someone ratted them out, then SHIELD was still compromised. Third, HYDRA was messing with human experimentation.
“Then make it work. Speaking as someone who missed his chance…don’t let this get away.” Thoughts of a cabin on a lake and a child with her father’s eyes flashed through Steve’s mind. “You have a real shot at happiness with Pepper.”
, who he was still kind of pissed at for her earlier comment. But he didn’t blame her. Why would Steve want to touch
He never knew it was possible to be so aroused that it
Steve looks ready to protest, but Clint cuts him off. "Oh, you're on," he says. "Loser has to do the other's paperwork for two weeks."
“That’s a, uh, very good question. I got a team of guys though, who’re going to come in tomorrow and blow out that wall.”
“Would you like some of my food?” He says, nudging his plate towards Peter.
“Go on then,” Steve said, all low and dark. “Show me that you’re mine and ride me.”
“And now you can be a mechanic.”
“Don’t say that,” Steve rasps, unclenching his fist and setting his big hand atop Tony’s. “Leaving you behind was the hardest thing I have
And he finds himself meaning it. He’d give Steve the sun if he asked. He tries not to let that scare him.
“I’m actually not a veteran,” Hailey said, tucking a stray strand of blonde hair behind her ear. “I was…I was in Manhattan,” she stated looking directly at Steve, “on the day of the invasion. It was the first day of my internship and I was so excited.”
“She has compiled the files you requested on Dr. Zola’s various experiments.”
“Are you feeling alright?” she asked like she already knew the answer. “Had any headaches lately? Slowing of movement?”
He knew he shouldn’t have mixed alcohols, but gods damn it all, it was his birthday. He was allowed to enjoy himself however he saw fit.
“Flattery will get you
died down and all three of them had burst out into giggles.
"Of us," Tony says, whisking all the ingredients together, so it doesn't burn. If he's also avoiding Steve's gaze, well, it's just a coincidence. Milk burns with a quickness when you're heating it on the stove, after all. "Sometimes when I'm bored or need a pick me up, I...look at the fanart kids send in."
Tony blinks once, twice, and tries to answer him. "I'm fine, Cap. Just disoriented."
While leaving the building after his second therapy session, Steve found a dog. Not just any dog; he was sure it was the cutest dog in all of New York.
Chuckling, Steve shook his head. “Don’t take it as encouragement.”
“Hey, Winghead.”
“I’ll see you again. Hopefully, not too soon.” He could feel her form fading until his arms were cradling nothing but air. When he opened his eyes, she was gone.
With the flick of a switch, Steve Rogers disappeared from time altogether.
“I saw it in your face.” She paused for a beat. “Would you like some more tea?”
“But don’t you two fly out to see each other every other Saturday?”
"Then that's a start," Tony said.
“It’s not fair,” Barton hisses, his hand balling into a fist when Fury leaves the room with Thor on his coattails to collect his brother. “His daddy,” Barton spits out the word like a curse, “won’t punish him.”
Dinner ends quickly after that, the others petering off until it's just Steve and Tony left sitting at the table.
“I’m…not sure how Howard was in the 40s but,” Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “By the time I was born, I don’t even think you would’ve recognized him. He was…cold. Calculating. Everything he did was for the sake of the company. And when I…when I started exhibiting signs of my genius…the things I could do…the things I could create, and at such a young age, too…everything he wanted me to do also started being for the sake of the company.”
Tony cups Steve's face in his hands. "But you're still fighting," Tony says softly. "The second you stop, that's when they win. That's when there's no coming back." His thumb brushes over Steve's cheek, wiping away a stray eyelash. Sitting this close, Steve looked so
than a soldier. He was
"I'd burn for you," Steve says. "I want you so much, I'm fucking dizzy with it." Steve twists his fingers, and Tony sees starlight behind his eyes.
And at the back of his mind, Steve had a niggling thought that the mission was also starting to take a physical toll on him as well. His movements were slow and sluggish and he felt the beginnings of a migraine building in his temples which shouldn’t have even been
, he thinks, chiding himself—is just as strange, just as foreign as the feeling of warmth.
Tony narrows his eyes. “Oh this means
“Not a dream.”
“Maybe,” Natasha hummed. “But now you can make things right. If you want to, of course.”
?” he asked, more than a little sarcasm seeping into his voice.
Steve up inside. “
Friendly reminder that I don't own Marvel or the MCU, and this fic is just for fun.
He waits for the snide comments, the jeers, the disgust to cross their faces but instead...instead they laugh. And it’s not a laugh of derision; Tony’s heard enough of those to recognize them. These are real, genuine laughs.
But he knew this game. He would only touch Steve when Steve was ready for him. The blond man stroked himself to full hardness lazily as if he wanted to be anywhere but here. Tony would just have to change his mind.
Tony whipped out his phone and said, “I’m thinking tonight’s a classic night. You know, wine, candles, home cooked dinner, that sorta thing.”
Man, he should really put down some more fatigue mats. He's not as young as he used to be, and workshop binges are even harder when you can't stay on your feet—
. First of all, it's too complex to be shoved into one category, and friends with benefits sounds juvenile.
Tony’s a whirlwind, flitting from one pot to the other putting Steve in the mind of a little hummingbird flying from flower to flower in search of nectar.
"He's the best of us," Tony says. He glances at her. Natasha sits forward, resting her head upon her palm. Her face is smooth, her cheeks still tinged pink from their rowdy tramping through the fairgrounds. She looks...raw. That's the only word to describe her. Raw and real and human. Not the robot switching personalities and names and appearances like most people change clothes.
. It tasted like home.
"Yeah, don't remind me."
He sipped delicately at his wine while Steve sputtered out an answer like a fool. “Servants are—you’re not—“
Tony inclined his head in agreement and let Steve lead him to the table. His hands shook as Tony caught his eye while he filled their cups. There was something about his gaze that left Steve feverish like Tony could see past his clothes, his skin, and into his very core. It unsettled him.
Steve repeats the motion and Tony feels as if he’s drowning, waves of pleasure crashing over him like the sea at high tide. He’s not sure if it’s because it’s been some time since he’s last been fucked or if Steve knows his body better than he knows it himself, but as Steve places a cheeky bite right at the edge of his entrance, his hands leave the headboard and thread themselves into the silky strands of Steve’s hair.
"Thank you," Carmen says. If she blushes anymore, Tony’s going to start worrying about her health. "I was actually inspired by your suit. The leather and the bodycon silhouette paired well with Fall and Winter."
"No," Tony huffed. "I'm just curious. You're...not what I thought you would be."
And he knew just the place to get them.
“All fucked out and you’re still desperate for it,” Steve crooned, his voice sweet yet taunting and once more arousal burned in Tony’s core. “I’ll give you what you want sweetheart.”
It's easy being with Steve. Too easy. He keeps on waiting for the other foot to drop, for Steve to realize that there's better things he could be doing than fucking around with Tony. He's quickly learning that Steve isn't the type to be needlessly cruel. Steve volunteers with the cleanup crews that come in and take care of their messes after each mission. He stops to take pictures and sign autographs when he runs into fans on the street, and he's quick to call someone out on their bullshit, and Tony...admires him for it. Steve Rogers is a good man, a seemingly perfect man. It was inevitable for the other man to grow on him.
This high up, with the sun setting behind them, Tony wishes he had at least brought a jacket.
“How could you pick his side? I built you!”
The last word hit Tony hard as a hot pang of lust struck him in his groin. Almost embarrassingly fast, Tony sunk to his knees and looked up at Steve from beneath his lashes. His kneecaps would definitely be sore later but in that moment he couldn’t bring himself to care.
Tony's stomach flutters as Steve turns to approach him. The intense look of concentration on Steve's face falls away to fondness in a split second. Giddiness makes him pick up his speed until he's right in front of Steve, who greets him with a peck on the lips. He hopes Steve’s enhanced ears can’t pick up the sound of his heart racing.
It’s weird, being able to joke about what happened to him now. But with Tony it feels fine, like it’s all in the past. What matters is now; this place and the people who go with it. He misses Peggy and Bucky and his Howlies but Stark Tower, the other Avengers,
“…Why didn’t you do this?” Steve asked. “Be a mechanic? You certainly have the skill.”
They curl close together, uncaring of the mess cooling on their stomachs. If Tony has anything to say about it, there’s a nice joint shower waiting for them when they find the will to move. Steve places one final kiss on the bite.
it's been like two months but to be fair this chapter was a goddamn beast. If you guys noticed, I changed the chapter count on the fic. That's because while I was writing this chapter, I somehow accidentally injected it with a plot so whoops this isn't a porn without plot anymore. Like it got so long I had to split it up.
“And I’d say it’s whatever you want.” Tony replied, making up his mind. “Sir.”
Tony doesn’t know how they end up here. One moment, Tony was damn near shouting at Steve for everyone to see, each word more filled with hurt and rage than the last, and the next Steve was looking at him with those ocean eyes of his and they were off. It wasn’t hard finding the nearest motel, Tony throwing a handful of bills at the counter, standing around impatiently while the concierge handed Steve the keys. Tony barely got a chance to survey their room before Steve was on him, lips rough and insistent against his.
“We did. There were losses, yes. There’s always losses, Steve. But you look past them. You move on. You find peace for yourself.”
“Really?” Tony said, lowering his sunglasses. “I distinctly remember you jumping off a building with no parachute.”
When Steve finally pulls his head back, his mouth all red and shining with saliva, Tony has the odd impulse to draw him into a kiss. A true kiss. Not that vicious battle for dominance that had consumed them earlier. Instead, Tony just spreads his legs and waits for Steve to continue.
cute with Steve's signature red, white, and blue suit and the shield to go along with it. "Thank you," Tony says. "You sure you want me to hold onto this?"
Tony, sensing a fight brewing, raises his hands in defense. “Not to replicate. It just doesn’t make sense.”
“That’s what you are, aren’t you? You’re my bitch, aren’t you sweetheart?” Steve insisted, stroking himself harder. The wet slapping sounds of flesh on flesh were deafening in the otherwise silent office.
Tony’s eyebrows rise, although it’s not like Steve can see him. He tells himself it’s just because Steve’s cold. He won’t,
“Fuck, Steve. Quit teasing me, alright? I need you inside me like yesterday,” Tony said, admitting defeat. Steve had been gone for too long and Tony had slept all alone in that big bed, clutching Steve’s pillow to his chest just to get a whiff of his scent. He needed to be sure that Steve was here and he wasn’t going anywhere.
Steve slicks up his cock, and Tony's toes curl at the thought of all of that going inside him. He wants it, though. He wants Steve like he's never wanted anything else in his life.
"And once we reach the base?" Natasha asks.
Steve remained silent, sure that Tony was going to say more.
it. Tony shifted in Steve’s lap, gasping when he felt just how hard Steve was, his cock rigid and nudging into Tony’s thigh.
. He was the man out of time with all of the time in the world now and he was still
“Listen,” Rhodey said under his breath. “The Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York…aliens, I mean come on—”
“Is it urgent?”
“You’re seriously gonna leave it, Nat?” Barton asks.
Steve’s eyebrows shot up involuntarily. He had never even suspected Rumlow shared his attraction towards men, let alone would be bold enough to proposition one right in front of Steve. For a horrid second, he thought Tony would say yes, given the appraising way he looked at Rumlow. Rumlow must have felt the same, for his smile grew wider, warping the hourglass-shaped scar on his cheek.
Steve Rogers is desperate for love. His entire body thrums with it, in the way he slips his tongue into Tony's mouth and grips one of Tony's hips in a harsh grip, hard enough to bruise. It's fine, though. Steve will kiss every one of his bruises later as penance.
She pursed her lips. “That…depends on your definition of dead.”
Quite literally, given how thick Steve’s cock is, and steadily rising.
Thankfully, Steve understood him; his hips met Tony’s with a satisfying smack. “I’m gonna take a leave of absence. So I can be right where I fucking
“Thank you,” Tony said, pulling Steve away from the dark thread of his thoughts. Tony wasn’t spending the night with Bucky, anyway. He was with Steve. In

—gives her a little twirl before setting her down.
“Life in the Gilded Tower wasn’t working for you?” Natasha said, leaning against his doorway.
“What you and your friends did was very dangerous.”
Tony nodded. “Better.”
The line to the Ferris wheel isn't too long, and by the time Tony works up the courage to take Steve's hand, the volunteers are strapping them in.
Peter grew quiet, seeming to fold in on himself. “His Majesty gives us what he thinks we deserve,” Peter said quietly. A safe reply, a non-answer, yet it told Steve all that he needed to know. It was settled then. He was going to attend today’s hunt regardless, but now, he had a
!" Imaginary Fury shouted at him.
He's never done this for a partner before. Usually, Tony's dates didn't stay long enough to cuddle, let alone shower together, with the exception of Pepper. But this...it had never been like this. It's like he's discovering a new element again or building his suit for the first time. Bringing something into being that which the world had never seen before.
Steve groaned, his hands hovering in the air, for he knew the second he gave into temptation and laid his hands on Tony, it would be the end of him.
Tony can barely think let alone form any words, his body and mind too overwhelmed with the weight of what he’s doing and who he’s doing it with.
Tony winces, prompting the others to look him up and down.
“You know, you could sound a bit more enthusiastic,” Tony said, reloading the needle gun in two rapid movements. “You sound like that impostor, Siri.”
that happened between him and Steve, he did offer him a place to stay. Tony’s not that much of an asshole. He’s not going to retract on that offer.
"HYDRA tech. Death rays and all that jazz."
The same terror grips him, that awful feeling of weightlessness and pressure all at once. He barely registers the shouts of the others over the comms before his sense finally kicks in, and he deploys the flaps meant to slow his fall.
“Same thing,” Rhodey had said with a wave of his hand. “It’s a dick move.”
away from him.
Steve's fingers, slick with Tony's saliva and lube, ghost around his perineum. He's thankful he had the good sense to shower beforehand, although he couldn't have foreseen this happening. Steve always caught him by surprise.
She nodded. “The hemorrhaging was brought on by your extended jaunts in time. As I said earlier, even I can only use the Time Stone sparingly. And that device you created, probably operates under similar rules.”
“Can you say four for me?”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice was tight. “I swear I’m almost done.”
“You’re wearing this in the house now?” She asked, walking closer to the suit. “What is that, like Mark 15?”
And they don't
The little boy wrinkles his nose. “What if you mess up?”
"You have me," Steve says, his voice hoarse and wretched. "You'll always have me."
Tony takes the bear, and maybe it's the lack of food in his system, but the urge to cry at Steve's kindness strikes him. The bear
and Tony wanted so desperately to take the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth and lap at the pre-come until there was nothing left.
the concern in their gazes. He mumbled some excuse or another—he couldn’t be bothered to come up with a good one—and pushed away from the dining table, striding, damn near running to the elevator. As the doors slid to a close, Steve felt himself sinking to the floor. His heart pounded away in his rib cage like a prisoner begging to escape his cell. Short, wheezy breaths escaped his lips.
Tony is starting to
“I should’ve known,” Bruce muttered, slouching in his seat. “You know,” he mumbled, “I was

They had left the curtains open last night, a golden shaft of sunlight shining directly onto the bed. “No,” Tony said, brown eyes glittering as the morning light hit them. Tony’s eyes reminded him of firewood, warm and inviting and mesmerizing. He felt like if he looked too closely at them he would fall into their depths, somehow. “Not at all.”
"Okay," Tony whispers, feeling like the air is closing in on him. It's hard to breathe when Steve looks at him like that, like Tony
"Before she passed, she encouraged me to go to art school," he says. "Guess she hoped that it would keep me out of trouble."
Besides, his tower is enormous, and he knows it like the back of his hand; it takes nothing for him to avoid Steve without making it obvious.
“I have ideas,” Barton says, and Tony flashes back to Afghanistan, to three months of darkness and dampness and death, and he understands Barton’s rage.
Had he kept them open, he would have seen the mischievous glint in Tony's eye. Steve's shot right back open as Tony lapped at the head of his cock, gathering the precome that had beaded there like it was a treat to be savored.
Tony did as he was told, letting his teeth drag over Steve’s length every time he withdrew from Tony’s mouth. Tony knew that his voice would probably have that raspy, throaty quality to it that would let everyone know
"Oh, really?" Natasha says, raising her brows. Natasha looks her up and down, and Carmen, much to her credit, holds her gaze. "I have ideas for your spring collection if you'd like to hear them."

He could’ve been imagining it, but JARVIS’ voice sounded tired to his ears.
Thor's singing the cooks' praises and their delicious Midgardian cuisine and rises to go get seconds, Bruce trailing after him.
"Something like that," Steve said. His father grunted, which Steve supposed was his sign of approval. "Father if I may," Steve said before his father could leave him to his own devices, "something's come to my attention that I would like to discuss with you."

! Thanks for reading!
Something in Natasha’s face softens, and she tilts her head at Tony. “I’m not going to pretend I know all of the details, but…you’re good for him. And I think he’s good for you. You’re both...softer. You look happy.”
“Keep going,” Rogers said, inclining his head. “Director Stark.”
"And what's that?"
straightforward, yet Steve still turned over the words in his head, looking for any possible angle, any trick the Red Skull could have been pulling and came up empty. He

of them had had close calls, and when they had finished their mission debrief, had stumbled back to Tony’s suite in the tower, stripping each other of their clothes as they went. From there, Tony remembers salty kisses, and fingers in his hair and love, so much love, in his heart.
“How,” he gasped, “how?”
“Thank the gods,” he muttered to himself, preparing to fill his waterskin.
The summer seemed to zoom past him, June bleeding into July and July into August. It was late one evening in the tower, he and Bruce had been making dinner together (chicken tikka masala this time) that Steve realized he had been in the past for three months. He had froze in the midst of chopping onions, his hands stopping in mid-air like a still-life. A tsunami of grief and guilt slammed Steve, sinking deep into his blood, his bones, his very being. For three
“Hm.” Thor turns to look at Bruce, who looked surprisingly (and thankfully) content with himself. “Would you like to ride with me, Doctor Banner?”
Tony smiled, a soft, bitter thing. “No. No, I don’t think so.”
"For him? As long as he needs. For us, five seconds."
“Captain,” Tony said, smiling brightly.
“Yes, I need you to count with me, soldier. Try counting to ten with me, alright? And focus on your breathing. One.”
“Yeah, yeah, yuk it up. I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I’m watching Pepper.”
"Please, call me Steve," Steve says. "She already has that song set as my ringtone."
Tony loves him.
Steve’s responding chuckle sent a shiver down his spine.
Steve’s breath caught in his throat. If this was Hell, then God was
“Perfect, even,” the medic had said with what Steve supposed was a comforting smile.
They settle into an easy, almost instinctive rhythm, Steve thrusting, Tony rising to meet him. Their groins are slick with sweat and precome. Tony’s sure that if they had bothered to get some lube, they wouldn’t have lasted half as long. It’s like someone’s turned a dial up on his senses. Wherever Steve touches him, his cock rubbing against Tony’s, is like someone lit a bundle of matches. He’s so hot, he’s sure his skin is smoking. He can hear everything. The hum of electricity present throughout his tower if you listened hard enough, Steve’s muttered curses, the wetness of Steve’s cock rocking against his.
Tony swallowed him down, taking inch after inch of Steve into his mouth, and wrapped a hand around what he couldn't fit into his mouth.
He passes it to Steve, who flicks open the cap with his thumb.
“Three,” Tony said. “You’re doing good, Steve. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s not real. You’re at home.”
“And what exactly did you do?”
Pepper rolled her eyes good naturedly. “And you have to wear yours in the living room?” She teased.
Red Skull chuckled. “I see the years have done nothing for your language. Very well, Steven. I yield. Do what you have come to do, and you shall be free to go.”
“We also deserve a day off,” Barton says. “At least I do. I don’t know about the rest of you slackers.”
Steve set down the shirt he had been folding. “It was working too well. Just figured SHIELD could use the extra help.”
“You’re lovely,” he finally said, his face burning. He drank from his goblet to cover himself. Tony paused mid-sip, his skin tinged pink in the firelight. Steve had made him blush. A primal part of him he hadn’t even known existed purred in satisfaction. He wondered if anyone else had managed to make him blush, if
Natasha opens her mouth first, and Steve just about dies when she says, “I’m sure Steve can make some room. Right, Steve?” Her smile is saccharine, and yet Steve still feels like she’s threatening his life.
“That’s all he used it for,” Tony points out. “Who knows what else it can do.”
“I’m gonna take a shower,” she said.
The last time around, he had said yes without a thought. He had underestimated how much he had missed being on a team, running around doing some good. At least he thought it had been good until HYDRA had reared its ugly head. His mind began to race with all of the possibilities. In the elevator he had said those disgusting words but…he could use them to his advantage. If he said yes, he could take down HYDRA two years early.
“She ended up finding shelter at a repurposed fallout shelter—a relic from the Cold War.”

,” his mind supplies, trying to be helpful. “
The elevator doors have barely closed on them before Steve's boxed him into a corner, his arms braced on either side of Tony. "That wasn't nice," he says. There's a tilt to his lips, so Tony knows he's not actually mad.
“Carmen,” Tony interrupts before she starts melting under the full force of Natasha’s undivided attention, “what’s the game plan for today?”
Steve froze. That voice…it’d been so long since he had heard that
was forming between the six of them. There had been something there. Something that had the potential to be glorious.
Wow, this got long. But on with the chapter!
been trying to kill him in the most painful way possible.
Tony groaned. “God, I’m sorry, Steve. I swear I didn’t mean to stand you up.” He sat back down on his workbench, cupping his forehead with one of his hands. “This goddamn gauntlet has been giving me trouble all night.”
During breakfast the next morning, Tony dropped a bomb on them that rattled Steve to his core.
She placed the cup in front of him, the scent of jasmine, lavender, and now freshly squeezed lemon blending together blissfully until Steve could feel himself letting go of tension he hadn’t even realized he had been carrying with him.
Steve glared at Brita from where he sat across the same wooden table they had first convened at what seemed like decades ago. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Brita.”
Tony tugged insistently at the strings of his trousers. "Let me show you just how handsome I think you are," he purred when they withdrew from each other to breathe.
They break apart because, unfortunately, air is necessary to live. Tony has half a mind to invent a way for humans to survive without air if it meant he could spend the rest of his life kissing Steve.
“Living with me is a blessing!” Tony replies, feigning anger, except he’s grinning wide enough that his cheeks are starting to hurt and the effect is ruined.
Steve scoffed, taking the seat across from Tony. “You’re no servant.”
“And what about you?” Tony asks. “Who’s looking out for you?”
Rhodey let’s out a yelp before swearing and him and Tony are grappling each other. In their struggle, Tony wriggles the wrong way and both of them are tumbling off of Rhodey’s bed and onto the wooden floors of their dorm.
There was perhaps more to the story, but he didn’t want to pry.
"I know, I'm amazing," Tony says around a mouthful of yogurt.
Clint grumbles something under his breath, and Tony closes his eyes.
He could taste the wine on Tony’s tongue, honey and spice sweetening his kisses. He was hot, too hot; he wouldn’t have been surprised to see a trail of smoke coming off his skin.
per se; Tony simply calculated the angle the kids would have to throw the ball along with the perfect amount of force. The looks of shock followed by unabashed glee after they made a basket more than made up for any guilt he was feeling.
The headache was building again. His hands flew to his temples, briefcase falling to the ground, forgotten. Steve fell to his knees, clutching at his skull. Something was burrowing
The shower door slides open, letting in a gust of cold air. Tony shivers at the sudden temperature change...and at who’s joining him.
Natasha cut him off. “We knew what we were doing when we did it. It was our
“Right,” Tony said, unbothered. He trusted Pepper. Even before they had officially started dating, it wasn’t unusual for either of them to rub elbows with the rich and the beautiful for business.
“I broke the crayon,” he mumbled.
Unfortunately, they were only allowed a 45 minute lunch and Tony was going to make the most of it. His daydreaming would have to wait. Especially when the real thing was right in front of him. Licking his lips, Tony did as he was told like he really was nothing more than a common whore and took the zipper between his teeth. The metal was cool and bitter on his tongue as he slowly, perhaps too slowly given how Steve’s hips bucked, pulled the zipper down with one motion.
“Enough,” Steve said roughly. “I will not be made a fool of.”
Steve couldn’t hear them over the rush of blood in his ears Where was he? When was he? And Tony—why was Tony there? Tony was dead, dead, dead—
Bruce stretched a hand out to him, “Come on, Cap,” he said. “Let’s get some food into you.” In a surprising show of strength, Bruce pulled Steve to his feet and helped walk him over to the dining table that had been set for three.
His heart pangs in his chest as the little boy jumps as soon as his drawing is finished and throws himself into Steve's arms. Steve startles but recovers quickly, giving the kid a polite hug back.
“You seem tense,” Tony said, walking Mark 42 behind the arm chair. A strong sense of pride overcame him as Pepper leaned back into the suit’s embrace with a blissful sigh as it started to massage her shoulders. His suits had come so far. The fact that he had enough control over Mark 42 to be gentle with the human body while he wasn’t even in the suit made him want to set off fireworks.
"Is it just me, or do those guns remind anybody else of the Chitauri's weapons?" Clint says over the comms.
Natasha had been one of Steve’s first friends in this strange new world. While others had spoken to him like they were walking on eggshells, like they didn’t want to set him off, Natasha had pushed him. She had made references she knew he wouldn’t understand so he’d look them up later and got him to cut his hair and took him to buy new clothes and he
“Drink with me,” Steve said, filling the second goblet on the tray he’d had his attendant bring up earlier.
Steve had the good grace to blush. "Okay...fair."
"Gods above," Steve grit out. His voice sounded like
Having Dodger had given Steve something of a routine. Every morning on the weekends, he’d wake up to a face full of fur and dog kisses which really did something to boost one’s mood. Dodger, whenever he felt particularly energetic, would occasionally accompany him on his morning runs. The afternoons would be spent in Tony’s workshop, Steve doodling in his sketchbook, while Dodger and DUM-E would play fetch with each other when Tony was too occupied to throw the ball himself. Friday evenings were devoted to couch cuddles where Dodger, all tuckered out from his day, would clamber onto Tony’s expensive Italian leather couch just to plop his body down on Steve and Tony’s laps while they watched a movie. Between volunteering at Habitat for Humanity, “catching up” on the 21st century with the help of his friends, and going to therapy, Steve kept himself busy and dare he say it…he was sort of happy.
call it the other word he's thinking of lest he get his hopes up,) but for what seems like the umpteenth time, he decides to ignore his doubts.
Had it not been for the serum, he’s sure he wouldn’t have been able to pay attention to the movie (which he’s enjoying so far, Elle’s likable and relatable; Steve knows all too well what it’s like to be judged based off his appearance) and the feeling of Tony’s body pressed against his own. He’s hyper-aware of Tony’s presence. His heart rate accelerates every time Steve shifts to get more comfortable, his thigh rubbing against Tony’s. He can smell the remnants of Tony’s cologne, something bright and uplifting just like its wearer.
Steve chokes, and Tony jams his elbow into his side. Steve coughs into his arm and clears his throat.
“Did you enjoy your birthday, sire?” Dugan asked when their ribbing of Bucky had lost some of its initial fun. “That sword of yours is a beauty.”
Tony arches a brow at Romanov. She’s a clever one, she has to be for her line of work, but Tony’s clever, too. He knows that to beat her at her own game, he has to play into it.
Pepper rose from the bed and backed away from him.
“Malibu feels like an old chapter of my life. I think I’m ready for something new.”
“Like us,” Steve agrees and Tony kisses him again.
“I’m going to kill you,” Steve hissed.
Steve returns the favor, taking his time as he washes Tony's body, lingering over scars, old and new. He pauses when he reaches Tony's sternum. The skin is smoother there, newer. Tony can hear his heart beating like a war drum in his ears, and he's almost certain Steve can feel it.
“If Madam Natasha approves,” Tony said, smiling sweetly.
Steve’s stomach rolled as Tony’s eyes met his own.
“I’m gonna need you to say that again,” Tony said slowly, “but slower so I can record it and post it on YouTube.”
had seen his lovely golden skin flushed. His grip on his goblet tightened.
have to lay the boy he had been to rest. His father would want him betrothed, wedded, and with an heir on the way within the year. When Steve pondered his fate, he couldn’t see himself living like his father or ruling like him with an iron fist. He didn’t want to marry some nobleman's daughter, nor did he want to be a father so soon. He felt as if he were still a boy, still figuring out what he wanted out of life.
and men who shrunk down to microscopic size. It sounded like something out of those comic books that used to stand outside newsstands that he and Buck used to spend their Sunday School money on. They had all had wacky titles like
Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. And Rhodey calls
The pet name slips out unbidden, but Tony doesn't have it in him to take it back. He doesn't want to anymore. And given how Steve's eyes soften at the name, he doesn't want Tony to take it back either.
The words had hit him hard in his chest, almost as if Tony had actually dealt him a physical blow and suddenly Steve was falling deep into the clutches of his traitorous mind.
“Okay,” Tony says, steeling himself.
Steve considered his words. "Is that good or bad?"
“As always, sir, a
"Steve,
He doesn’t want there to be any distance between him and Steve, wants to press against him until he can’t tell where they begin and end.
, Steve thinks.
"Got it," Natasha says a second later. "I'm sending Thor to you. But first, Hawkeye, let's show these boys a little reciprocity, hm?" Natasha's voice is like ice. Tony almost feels bad for those poor HYDRA agents operating those machine guns. Almost. If only they weren't the scum of the earth.
, too soon, but in that moment, Steve Rogers thinks he could be in love with Tony Stark.
"With pleasure, sir."
Tony had been sitting on his bed with his hands in his lap, unsure of what to do with himself. Howard and Maria had left just as quickly as they had arrived, both of their schedules occupied by SI business and charities and they were just oh so sorry that they couldn’t stay for long. With Jarvis and Ana gone…Tony had…he had no one.
was the right thing to do.”
tower. Honest.)
"And you're not fighting alone. You never did. You had the Commandos," Tony says. He doesn't know where he's going with this, but he'll do anything to take that grimace off of Steve's face.
That’s how Tony spent the rest of his afternoon, the incident at Murray’s falling from his mind until all that was left was him and his holograms. Tony didn’t realize he had spent nearly the entire day in his workshop until he got the alarm from JARVIS that Pepper would be coming home soon.
Tony threw an egg at Rhodey in response.
Steve's breath, cool and minty, washes over his face. Tony has to blink a few times, processing what just happened before he can even think about speaking.
Tony groans, dropping Steve’s hand. “She has the worst timing.”
“And his absence will, too,” Bucky shot back. “He was purchased with
JARVIS hesitated before saying, “Of course, Captain Rogers. But only if you agree to seek out help.”
“I could always make you a suit, you know. All you’d have to do is ask. You, me and Rhodey, we’d be…the Iron Trio.”
Steve chuckled then propped his elbows up on the table to rest his head in his hands. He was okay. He was okay. He was okay.
than a simple hookup.
“If I’m taking a break,” Steve’s hands came up to palm Tony’s ass, “I’m taking it how I want to.”
He pulled Natasha into one last hug, feeling the solid weight of her body against his, burying his face into her neck. “I’ll miss you.”
"What are you even working on anyway?"
“Don’t you think six, let alone one Avenger, would take away from the cause? And that’s if they even agree to it.”
“I’m moving back to Malibu,” Tony had said in lieu of a greeting when he stepped into the kitchen.
“Look at you,” Steve said, filth continuing to pour forth from his lips as Tony bobbed his head along the length of Steve’s cock. His jaw was starting to ache, both drool and pre-come leaking from the corners of his mouth but Tony couldn’t care less; he was floating on a cloud, his body still riding the blissful high his orgasm had given him. Steve could do anything he wanted right now, and Tony wouldn’t fight him at all.
“The pressure must be unreal,” AJ said. “You probably didn’t get much time to yourself, either. Especially now. But Steve, what you’re feeling is perfectly valid. At the end of the day, being a soldier is a job, right? A very noble job but still a job?”
He plopped down in the chair across from Bucky and poured himself a glass of wine, having dismissed his personal attendant for some privacy with Bucky.
“Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a—”
Birthday breakfast had turned into birthday brunch as Steve watched Clint and Sam fling blueberries off of their pancakes at Bucky. Natasha was recording the entire thing on her phone, most likely for future blackmail purposes. Bruce and Tony’s dark heads were bent close together, most likely discussing their latest joint experiment, with Thor occasionally chiming in. Underneath the table, everyone pretended not to notice Tony’s hand in his.
The muscles in Tony's stomach jump, still reeling from the aftershocks of his orgasm as Steve rises to his feet. Later on, Tony couldn't tell anyone why he did it, but he pulls Steve into a fierce kiss and licks the taste of himself from Steve's mouth. Steve kisses him back just as hard until the water is like a thousand icy pinpricks, and their skin begins to prune up. Tony returns the favor and gets Steve off one more time, stroking him off with his hands.
“You know, you’re quite different,” Tony said. “For a prince.”
Thanos had called himself inevitable. But he didn’t account for one thing. So were the Avengers.
“Ms. Romanoff,” he replied.
"He's not like you," Natasha says. He doesn't even have it in himself to be offended. She's right. Steve isn't like Tony and will never be like Tony. A little rough around the edges. "He's not like me, either," she admits, catching Tony by surprise.
“But look,” Steve had said, lifting up the dog that had stumbled out to greet him. “He’s happy to meet you! Say hi to Dodger.”
Relief floods through Tony. He's not totally helpless if JARVIS is still on the line.
"Did you eat at all?" Natasha asks, and as soon as she says something, his stomach growls.
“I’m coming, I’m coming,” he chuckles. When he sees Tony slumped over, his blood runs cold, and Steve nearly drops the plate he had brought down for Tony. His first instinct is poison, but how? Who could have slipped in and out of Tony’s workshop unnoticed? Bullet then? Was he stabbed? Why wasn’t Tony moving—
, she knows, and if it weren’t her job to gather intel and pick up on context clues, he’d be a lot more worried that the others knew. But she wasn’t blackmailing him or threatening him to stay away from Steve? She...approved of them? He remembers that debriefing after they had defeated Loki, what felt like a lifetime ago, and her casual dismissal of Tony and his relationship with Steve. He wants to bring it up, to confront her, but what’s there to confront?
some violence and gore (nothing crazy) in this chapter, I'm not going to say too much in the notes because I don't want to spoil it.
“And yours?” Steve asked.
“Thank you,” Steve said again with a bright smile.
AJ’s words hit him so deeply in his gut, he had to sit back in his seat. He was
for more stony/marvel content. I love you all! <3 <3
The courtesan paused, confusion clouding his features. “No one’s making a fool of you, my prince."
They finalize their plans and run them by Fury and what remains of SHIELD. They'll head out tomorrow morning, just before dawn, to catch them off guard. The others have left the war room, either to train or to get some rest. Steve sits at the table alone, the hologram casting his face in blue light.
Tony swallows, his stomach twisting into knots at the thought of Steve thinking he feared
Tony’s hands crept up to Steve’s shoulders. His thumbs rubbed strong circles into the muscle of Steve’s back, working out whatever knots he felt. “If you’re almost done, I don’t see any reason why you can’t take a break. It’s not the end of the world if you don’t finish it tonight.”
Natasha hums, and her eyes flit over to Steve. “You two look friendly.”
now. JARVIS could switch the pitch of his voice to show a change in tone and could joke around with the best of them. He still remembered when JARVIS had been nothing but a line of code that he had spent all of his waking hours working on in a coffee-fueled, sleep-deprived haze.
He had never told anyone of his inclinations, not even Bucky. Obviously, he had not been as subtle as he intended. He shuddered to think of what would happen if his father ever confronted him.
Lost in his thoughts, he barely realized he had reached the stream until his toes had started to sink into the significantly softer mud. Fully blossomed honeysuckle encroached on the trees, releasing its sweet perfume in the air.
Steve pauses at the threshold and doesn’t look at him when he replies, “See you around, Tony.”
Tony's already hard and straining against the confines of his boxers. He can feel Steve, hard and leaking pre-come through the thin fabric of his boxers.
“If magic is unique to each individual,” Natasha began.
And that, that makes Tony blink.
“As you keep reminding me, sir.”

. It was all his fault, everything was his
“Would you believe me if I said I just couldn’t stay away?” he asks, sliding his hands into his pockets.
And part of him shatters like glass when he remembers what Tony had said; “
. Once again, the urge to throttle his younger self hit him. Of all people to accuse of pretending to be heroes, Steve had chosen one of the most heroic men he had ever met. Figures.
“Fuck you,” Tony groaned.
A chuckle escaped him. God, he had missed her.
“You are to tell me when you’re hungry,” Steve said, trying to make his voice sound domineering. “I won’t have my personal servant passing out from starvation, understood?”
Steve had started team dinners because they needed to “get along” and “work on their social skills.” Tony was starting to think Steve just started them because he was a shameless exhibitionist.
The comms unit on his suit was the first to go, then the thrusters, and finally the HUD. Tony was all alone, flying blind, millions of light-years away from home.
Tony sighs but damn it, Steve's right. He's always right. Tony doesn't know much about Clint's life before SHIELD and the Avengers, but he knows it wasn't pretty. Seemed to be a common theme amongst their little team.
, he thought as his eyes fluttered, a stuttering gasp leaving his lips. Tony's hands clutched at Steve’s thighs as he ground his hips pathetically against Steve’s boot. Stripes of come, hot and thick, pulsed out of Tony’s cock and filled his already wet briefs. Heat raced down his spine, making Tony want to peel off the rest of his uniform and press his orgasm-rattled body against the cool floors.
Another swat to his ass and Tony quickly shut his mouth.
Steve huffed. “Jesus, Tony.”
, “if you die, who’s going to suffer through Hemingway with me?”
“How did you—Ty and I—” for the first time in ever, really, Tony couldn’t find the words. His relationship with Pepper had been no secret, nor his relationship with Rumiko, but Ty—
He's landed in a snowbank, thankfully. Tony always knew that there was a possibility that his suit would be his coffin, but he didn't want to bite the dust just yet.
Trauma. Steve was all too familiar with that word, having used it many times himself in the original timeline (or prime-line as he was beginning to think of it) after the Decimation. The support group had seemed like it had happened ages ago. Steve had…liked it. It wasn’t perfect by any means, but it had allowed for him to help others in a way he had failed to do as Captain America.
to see if she’s as calculating as she comes off.”
With flour in his hair and sticky palms, Tony launches himself at Jarvis who finds his arms full of dirty, sticky, boy-genius. Jarvis has never been happier.
"I'll say," Steve says, and there's no hiding the awe in his voice. "I can't believe some of these rides even exist."
"Cease your fire," Thor says, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist. "We're joining the fray." And they're off. Thor's flying is different from Tony's own; Mjolnir functions as a weight, taking them into the mountain top's direction. It's completely flat on top, akin to a plateau. Every twenty feet is a gunman armed with what looks like a modified Chitauri gun. They're firing blindly, still looking out for the quinjet. "We're coming in," Tony says. "And Hawkeye, you're right. This does look like Chitauri weaponry."
, made it a bit more bearable.
“I’d like some more tea, please,” he muttered, clearing his throat.
“Sir Timothy Dugan, but Dugan is fine.”
"You've got me. You'll always have me," Tony confirms.
That…wasn’t the reaction he had been hoping for but he supposed it must have been shocking to come home from a long day of work to what was basically a robot sitting on your couch.
Bucky’s eyes widened. “You can’t do that!”
Tony knows what it is. A marker. A claim. He’s Steve’s for as long as Steve will have him. Tony’s willing to indulge him. For now.
off of it. “No. Just for you,” he said. “I’m just a slut for you, sir.”
“Four,” Steve said. This was home. The tower. Tony and Bruce and Rhodey and Pepper and—
It takes him a second, but Tony realizes that she's talking about the Avengers. He shakes his head. "They're fine. It's...weird living with so many people," he says. Tony had lived alone for half of his life now, aside from that brief stint in Malibu with Pepper. "They leave coffee grounds in the sink, and last week, Romanov and Barton convinced JARVIS to play Iron Man every time I went into my workshop and—"
Her hands moved too fast for his eyes to track, or maybe his vision was failing, the
“Hold me, touch me, love me, help me,” she croons as Tony rakes his nails down Steve’s back. The super-soldier hisses and burrows his face into the crook of Tony’s neck as she sings, “Be the first who ever did.”
Steve tilts his head and runs a hand up Tony's thigh until he's tantalizingly close to cupping his cock. "Desperate. Wanting. Regardless of what you want to call it, I like seeing you as wrecked as I've felt these past couple of months."
Anyway enough about me, and enough about life, on with the fic!
“Thank you,” he said. “I suppose I can just leave him to his own devices for the week,” he added.
Their faces were close, and for a moment, Tony thought Steve might have kissed him despite what Tony had just done. Tony looked into Steve’s eyes and there was earnestness there. Earnestness and lust and something he didn’t dare try to name. But…if Steve was willing to try…
He didn't know where this sudden bout of earnestness had come from, but lying here...with soft grass beneath them, as naked as the day they were born and the sun warming their bodies...Steve felt as if he could tell Tony anything.
“It’s almost time for you to go,” Natasha said. Her form was beginning to blur at the edges but he didn’t want her to go. He didn’t want to let go.
, but before Tony can even open his mouth to argue, because what the
“What was I supposed to do, say no?”
Even though he had opted to sit away from the fire, the scent of roasted rabbit wafter over to him. His stomach growled. The midday sun beat down on their heads, a bead of sweat rolling down Steve's neck and into his tunic. He bounced his leg, his body thrumming with excess energy. He wanted to run laps or perhaps mount his palfrey. She rode like the wind and made Steve feel as if he had been born with wings.
It's!! Finally!! Here!! Y'all do not have any idea how excited I've been to post this chapter. I really think it's my best one yet. Aside for a little warning that there
Pepper stopped and turned to look at him.
, does the sight of Steve on his knees make his brain short-circuit.
Two bright brown eyes had gazed up at him and in hindsight, Steve
And right now, that focus was determined to make Tony come in his pants like a teenager.
"An aerial assault then," Thor suggests. "So we won't be caught unaware."
Tony flushed and bowed his head.
“Right.” Steve clears his throat. “I, uh, guess I’ll get going.”
The wine left his mouth dry. Steve licked his lips noting how the courtesan’s eyes tracked the movement. “Yes,” Steve said, surprising himself. “I suppose I am.”
He's not sure if he should be disappointed or relieved.
It was on his way home from another long day toiling in the sweltering summer heat when things finally,
“I lost him, ma’am. He was trying to make a quick escape. Didn’t even go for the scepter.” After spending so many years around spies and assassins, the lies came more easily to him than they had ever had.
If anything, he has the power to bring Steve to his knees.
“And your body is suffering the consequences. There is a
"How long is this gonna take?" Sam asked, crossing his arms in front of him.
“I thought members of the court were only allowed to accompany royal hunts,” Rumlow sneered.
He lets go of Tony's cock, but Tony has no time to beg because he's lining himself up with Tony's entrance.
“Suddenly they were the only thing I was making,” Tony finished. “Until this,” he said, gesturing all around him. “Until Iron Man. Until this team.”
“Tony, I will literally sit on you.”
Tony and Barton end up arguing the semantics of flying over a finger of Tony’s best scotch, Bruce occasionally chiming in, Romanov and Steve looking on in amusement.
They move from the island to Tony's couch, Tony curled into Steve's side, Steve's arm slung around his shoulder. They polish off the rest of their hot chocolate and scroll through the pages of fanart, getting lost in each other's touch and presence. There's something warm and golden in Tony's chest, slowly expanding, and he knows one day it's going to fill him up from head to toe.
Steve stalks into the kitchen and is immediately hit with the scents of his childhood. Mutton and onions and potatoes and carrots and underneath the savory mix, he can smell currants and caraway seeds.
“Poison?”
Panic like no other seized him and before he knew it, he was barreling out of the closet, barely registering the recognizable, unrelenting pain of sore muscles coursing through his body, and stumbled out onto the bridge-way where he had fought himself. His head whirled around wildly looking for some sign,
“I’m not done, sweetheart,” Steve chuckles. “How do you feel about toys?”
Part 2 to this fic should be coming soon-ish, I've already started to draft it and actually have a fic outline written out. Feel free to yell at me on my

Tony won’t roll his eyes because they’re in a dire situation, and he fears it won’t go over well, but he’s sure as hell tempted to after hearing that. Forget George Washington. Steve Rogers couldn’t tell a lie to save his life.
“Nope. No trust. Zero. Zip. Nada. Liar.”
"So," Tony says, "we're good to go?"
Again I have no idea where plot came from but she's here to stay now. Don't be afraid to tell me what you think even if it's just a string of emojis.
“Tony, I don’t regret what we did,” Steve says. There’s a determined light in his eyes. Tony feels like the prey again. Steve has always made him feel like he’s being hunted.
“I already told you I’m not letting it happen again, and I mean it. I need to be at my best.”
"Still the man with a plan?"
Tony takes them in because, despite
Steve reached into his pants and pulled out his cock himself. Tony remembered the first time he had seen it, his mouth had fallen open in shock. He hadn’t been a stranger to sucking cock, having experimented in his younger years before coming to terms with the fact that he was bisexual when he hit thirty, but Tony could barely wrap one
was the perfect time to bombard him. The nightmares had been abstract at first, nothing but darkness and him waking up sweaty and on edge. But then they started taking on shapes. Faces. Memories. So many memories. Memories from both timelines swirled round and round in his brain until some mornings he couldn’t remember
If JARVIS had lungs, Tony knew he’d be sighing. “As you wish, sir. I’ve also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.”
Tony finishes up the hot chocolate with a flourish of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon, walking around the island and pressing one of the cups into Steve's hand. Steve's fingers graze his own, sending delightful sparks running through him. Tony tries not to dwell on it.
Once Hailey was finished, they all looked at Steve expectantly. “Believe it or not crash landing a bomb-laden aircraft into the Arctic and waking up in the future
"Where's this monster you speak of?" Thor says. "I don't see one."
Tony tried again, grunting forcefully.
Tony can't see the quinjet anymore, but he can sure as hell hear it as Natasha unloads a barrage of bullets aimed directly at the turrets surrounding the HYDRA bunker. Never has he ever been more thankful for retro-reflective paneling. There's a pause in the gunfire, presumably from the HYDRA goons taking cover and Natasha ceasing her fire to allow Thor to reach him unharmed.
Tony shook his head. “Well, Rogers isn’t here right now, is he? He’s…I don’t even know where the hell he is.”
"I left because I couldn't lie to them anymore. It's only so long I can play the role of the perfect prince. Sometimes...I just want to be Steve."
Warmth bloomed in Tony’s chest. Steve said nothing as Tony stood behind his chair and bent down to whisper into his ear. “I think you need a break.”
He supposed stealing more Pym Particles from Hank should have made him feel at least a
“Seriously,” Tony says. “Now that we know that beings like Loki and Thor exist, shouldn’t we be prepared for others like them?”
“What is this?” he heard himself saying.
be just as good as chocolate chip cookies.
“Yeah,” Tony says, clutching a pillow to his chest. He’s currently staying at one of his vacation homes on the Amalfi coast. His bedroom has a perfect view of the sea. Every evening, he sits out on his balcony and tries not to think about how Steve’s eyes are the exact color of the Mediterranean at sunset.
"And I see a kind, honest man who would never harm anyone intentionally," Steve says, jumping in.
Thor and Bruce also end up excusing themselves, leaving Steve, Natasha, and himself alone.
Steve shudders. "God, Tony, I need—I need—"
His only choice is to play it cool. "First off, you know you love my nicknames, case in point,
"Maidservants don't count."
Steve trembles, and it’s from the
Steve let his head go and Tony leaned forward to rest it on the desk. He couldn’t rest for long, however, when Steve hauled him up and into his desk chair so that Tony was seated on his cock. The new position gave his legs some reprieve and plunged Steve further into him. Tony moaned, head thrown back and throat exposed. Steve filled him to the brim like he and Tony were made to fit together.
"Ah," he breathes as the lube hits his skin, all cool and wet.
"Alright, I'm in," he says. "Dibs on the sharpshooting booth."

," he thinks to himself.
There had only been one lady; Lady Carter. Steve had courted her only for her to end up betrothed to another man. He had given them his blessing, but it had still hurt to be pushed to the wayside like he was nothing. Like he was nobody.
“Come again?” Steve asked nonchalantly. “I’m having a little trouble understanding you.”
There was that word again. Peace. Maybe one day Steve would
“Are you…are you Howard Stark’s kid?” Rhodey had asked.
Tony jumps and hurries to rejoin the others, Steve right behind him, staring into his back.
Their skin is tacky with sweat and lube, and the clean-up will be awful, but Tony doesn't care as the reality of the day hits him. Tony almost
. He doesn't know when they learned to read each other so well.
? With that…that…
Steve looks down at the Iron Bear, and what he says next might actually make Tony melt into a puddle. "Nah. Couldn't bear to give him up."
“Tony,” Rhodey said warningly.
When they mounted their horses, it occurred to Steve that Tony wasn't a nobleman and had most likely never gone on a royal hunt in his life, let alone rode a horse.
Tony continues on, the shouts and whoops and laughs fading into the background; he's made it to a quieter part of the carnival where they tucked off all of the arts and crafts booths.
. And—”
Steve glances at him and smiles, but it doesn't reach his eyes.
JARVIS’ voice came through. “Sir…would you like me to contact Captain Rogers? I believe he would be able to help you in your current state.”
“A week to start,” Bucky replied, prompting another head tilt from Steve. An entire
"They were smart when they made this base," Steve says. "It's incorporated into the mountain top. They'll be able to see us coming from all sides."
“Yeah,” Tony says. “Sure. Let’s head up here,” he gestures to the living area situated by the staircase. This floor of the tower serves as Tony’s second home, an escape from all of his penthouse suite’s showy glamour and the lack of privacy on the communal floors. The penthouse suite reminds him too much of Pepper, anyway.
"One condition," Steve replies, "and I'll agree. Just promise me one thing."

“You heard your friend,” the courtesan continued. “Lay the boy to rest.” The courtesan’s eyes skated down Steve’s body, leaving him feeling strangely bare. “Let the man rise.”
,” he thinks. “
Pepper was late. Which was fine, totally fine. Tony knew she was a very busy woman, CEO of a Fortune 500 company and…hopefully not oohing and ahhing over Aldrich Killian’s ginormous brain.
It’s like someone’s dumped cold water down Tony’s back; he’s so in shock he can barely register what Natasha is saying. He swallows. Natasha knows. Of
I apologize for the long wait in between updates, life has just been crazy and I haven't been feeling that inspired to write. That being said, I still hope you guys enjoy this chapter.
Tony can practically hear his heart beating in his chest over the sound of Steve's steady, even breathing. Steve presses into him so slowly, so carefully like he's trying not to break Tony in half.
They both curse, Tony at the change in angle, the lightning in his blood, Steve at Tony's sudden tightness, and Steve fucks into him in earnest.
"Okay. Fuck, okay, Steve," Tony finds himself saying. It's hard to say no when Steve looks like
Turning to the left, Natasha looking a vision in white, her red-and-blonde hair hanging loosely around her shoulders, gave him a beatific smile and Steve’s heart
Romanov’s eyes roam from him to Steve and back again before she snorts.
Almost as if it heard his plea, a gauntlet arose from the table and encased his hand. He looked down in wonder as the crimson metal began to engulf his arm until eventually his entire shoulder was suited up. Tony pointed his non-armored arm to the table and the other gauntlet quickly made its way to him, wrapping itself around his hand and arm.
Steve's hand reaches for the lube once more, the other jerking Tony off at an agonizingly slow pace until he's truly hard and leaking pre-come all over Steve's fist.
“It’s all I’ve known. Building things. Taking them apart and putting them back together better than I found it. Circuit boards, car engines, bots, AIs…weapons.”
“Well, since you asked so nicely.”

Steve blushes, but it's all in good fun. Thor, of course, breaks the game, the bell flying clean off the top of the tower. The game runner in awe (and a little bit of fear) gives Thor a prize regardless. Tony promises to compensate the man as soon as possible. Despite all of that, his headache has receded slightly. He needs to eat
Tony squirms in his seat, and suddenly the floor of his workshop is the most interesting thing he's ever seen. Has he always had so many motor parts lying around?
“You know what?” Happy started. “You should take more of an interest in what’s going on here. This woman…this woman’s the best thing that ever happened to you, and you…you’re just ignoring her.”

“Let me up. We’re all sticky,” he whined.
It's getting harder to think straight.
Three days to gather over 70 years worth of data into one flash drive. Holy shit.
“What else can I call you?” Steve held up a hand as she opened her mouth to speak, “Please don’t make me call you ‘Ancient One.’”
“It also isn’t a yes,” she spat back. “But…it may have given me hints. Glimpses. A sense of foreboding, if you will. Before I gave the stone to Banner, I did some general…searching. And it showed me you. This,” she said waving her hand around them. “But not what happened before. No, I figured that out for myself.”
This chapter is a bit of a filler but chapter four is done and I'll definitely have that up before the month is over. If I don't feel free to yell at me, I won't mind. I also accidentally ended up creating an OC for this story 🤷 I hope you guys like her because she's going to show up in a few more chapters.
start.
"She doesn't half-ass anything, huh?" Clint says. He sounds impressed and…a little excited. Tony can't lie...he's excited too.
"I'm alright," Tony says. They can talk later. There's still a mission to finish.
The dreams took turns, it seemed. One night Tony is floating aimlessly in the cold vacuum of space. Another night, Obie yanks the arc reactor from his chest.
“Mise en place,” Steve repeats. The words flow off his tongue. “Works for a lot of things.”
Tony arched his brow. “No ‘sir’ in front of it?”
"Ass," Rhodey snarks.
Gingerly, Steve sat down at the table. “There we go,” Bruce said softly. “Tony and I can handle the rest.”
"Whatever we want it to be. No labels, just us being us."
“You’re such a smart ass,” Tony replied. “Honestly, where do you get it from?”
Steve’s eyes are dark, and the bastard’s
alone would make Tony come again; that wet, rhythmic slapping of flesh against flesh, Steve’s rumbly growls occasionally interrupted by throaty swears.
Steve didn’t know where this sudden urge to abandon propriety had come from. All he knew was that the boy in front of him worked far too hard to eat so little.
The third batch is perfect, Rhodey tells him, practically moaning after carefully biting into a still steaming slice. Tony taking that as a good sign, digs in himself. His eyes close as the sweet, piquant syrup the sweet potatoes created floods his mouth and he has to agree. Candied yams may just push chocolate chip cookies down a spot on his favorite dessert list. Apple tortes are still first but candied yams, Tony decides, are damn close.
She eyed the stone with mild interest before focusing in on his trembling hand. “Thank you, Captain,” she said.
“What is?”
"You've got me there," Tony says, going through the motions of measuring out cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla. He can feel Steve's eyes on him, drinking in his every movement. Not in a hungry way for once, but almost like he's curious. In casual awe of Tony in a kitchen.
Steve kisses him, hot and desperate, tugging at Tony's clothes.
Steve held back a chuckle. “I’m surprised Stark even bothered to invite me. I didn’t exactly get the feeling that he liked me.”
interact with children."
A fevered kiss—“
“You’re late,” she says, in lieu of a greeting. Compared to the rest of them, she looks quite put together. Not a hair out of place, the cut on her forehead cleaned and bandaged. The archer—Barton, his brain supplies—sits with his feet propped on the table like a goddamn
“Apology?”
? That for five years they had wallowed in self-pity and misery and dragged an innocent man, a
Tony could understand him. The same way Steve could apparently spend days working on an art piece, Tony would spend the same amount of time in his workshop, bringing an idea to life.
He feels rather than sees Steve grin against his thigh before his hands surge up and swing Tony’s legs over his broad shoulders. A yelp escapes Tony’s mouth at the sudden change of position and his hands fly up to grasp at the headboard. The yelp turns into a moan as Steve licks a broad, flat stripe against Tony’s entrance. He licks another stripe, this time across, and another and another, unrelenting until Tony’s writhing against the sheets. Steve’s grip only tightens on Tony’s thighs. He presses his face further into the apex of Tony’s thighs and stiffens his tongue and plunges it into Tony’s hole.
“None of your goddamn business, that’s how.”
“Stupid fucking thing,” Steve could hear Tony saying more clearly as he crept closer.
Tony looks to Rhodey. “Call you back later?”

" he thinks, still trying to calm his racing mind down. "
"Always, sir."
"Are you guys coming, or are you just going to gaze into each other's eyes?" Clint shouts from the next booth over.
"Spoiled. Obnoxious. Arrogant."
"I'll be there with you," Thor says, his voice a soft timber. "I won't let anything happen to you. None of us will."
“I saved your life. You’re welcome by the way.”
Everything changes one night after a night terror hits Tony particularly hard. He's no stranger to nightmares. Waking up with his heart trying to escape his chest, his hands clawing at the edges of his arc reactor scars was pretty par for the course. Didn't make it easier, though.
When he emerges from the bathroom, Tony can't say he's surprised when he finds Steve, still suited up, sitting on the couch with his helmet in his hands.
Later on, when they're all piled into Tony's limo like they're going on a field trip, Steve texts him even though they're sitting right next to each other.
) to cook in Steve’s kitchen.
This close, Steve could see that Tony’s eyes were glossy and bloodshot as if he’d been crying. He could smell the liquor on Tony’s breath and the desire to dump the bottle of Jack Daniel’s down the nearest sink overcame him.
“Ah,” Tony hisses as Steve plants another kiss right over his bite mark.
Pepper arched a brow. “The Iron Trio?” She repeated.
“Steve,
Hill nods at him and leaves Tony to his devices.
Tony was so lost in thought that he had nearly flew into a billboard, just barely managing to barrel roll away.
to be enhanced somehow because there's no way two shots from any old machine gun would take him out so easily.
Tony can’t look away. It’s like there’s some electric current going from him to Steve, and the second they break eye contact, it’ll cease to exist.
the puppy was commanding them to well up with tears. He observed the puppy more carefully and didn’t see what looked like bite marks or fleas but there was a definite gauntness to him that shouldn’t have been there. He looked so sad and hungry and looking at the other three pups in the box, all yipping pitifully, they were probably in the same sorry state.
If Tony weren’t so pissed, he’d make a snide comment about Severus Snape.
"Like what?" Tony finds himself saying.
business.
Rhodey and Obadiah stand beside him as they lower his parents' caskets into the fresh upturned earth and shield him from the view of the gaggle of reporters who had somehow made their way into the funeral and buzz around him like incessant flies.
“With pleasure sir.”
Natasha’s eyes light up as she says, “That had to have been the first thing they did, right? It makes sense.”
Steve’s muttering a litany against his neck. Tony can’t,
Tony is sore in that delicious way that comes with a good fuck, feels the echo of Steve’s cock pressing into him and splitting him in half. It’s not impossible for a man of Tony’s age to get hard so quickly after an orgasm, but definitely improbable. Were he less desperate, less crazed, he might consider the side effects of regularly sleeping with a super-soldier without a condom, but all he really wants is for Steve to fill him up again.
Steve is the first to act, taking Carmen's hand in his own. "Thank you, ma'am," he says. "I know I speak for everyone when I say that we're glad the team exists, and we'll help out any way we can."
“You blew me off,” Steve says slowly, “because you thought I wasn’t ready for...
Tony frowned up at him, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “I’m gonna take a nap. But only because I want to. And I think you actually will sit on me.”
Steve cursed, bucking his hips, and Tony gagged. He waited for Tony to buck him off and demand that Steve never touch him again, but instead, Tony looked up at him. His eyes shone with unshed tears, but the absolute lust in his eyes and bulge in his trousers told Steve all that he needed to know. So he did it again and again, all the while muttering a steady stream of curses under his breath.
Natasha stepped out of the car looking completely unbothered, meanwhile Clint clambered out of the car looking pale in the face.
“Iron Family? Team Iron? Iron Squad? Are any of those a yes?”
Steve arched a brow looking remarkably at ease for a man who just had his soul sucked out of him through his dick. Not that Tony was bragging. “Back to Rogers now, sweetheart?”
“That’s risky.”

Okay this chapter is a little
"Sorry," Natasha says, not sounding sorry at all.
"My mom. When I was a kid...she'd draw whatever I asked her to and would let me color it in however I wanted, even if it was ridiculous. Took me to art museums when we had the money."
“Oh, except there’s been a…uh…a radiation leak.”
Pepper raises her hands. “Just throwing it out there. Again, you need a break. And think of the kids when they see your faces.”
Tony. He wanted to call him Tony.
hawk’s sleep in?”
By the time Tony gets an all-clear from the medics, all he wants is to take a nice, scalding shower, and he does just that.
"That's blasphemous, Rogers," Tony says. Worship. Like he's something pure. Like he's someone worth loving.
Rhodey in retaliation throws both his pillow and Tony’s at Tony in quick succession. Tony yelps as both pillows make their mark.
The water has turned his hair, darkening it from gold to honey. Tony’s stomach lurches as his eyes go down from Steve’s face...to the planes of his chest...and his thighs and—
But Tony wanted to. Oh, God, did he want to see just how much of Steve he could handle like he needed air to breathe.
But could they have avoided the war in the first place? What prompted the king of Ma'Hat to court death, for that's what war with Brooke would bring. Five years later, and Ma'Hat had all but fallen, and for what?
“Shower later?” he asks, his words thick and syrupy from post-orgasmic bliss and the sudden need for a nap. It’s a struggle to keep his eyes open, but he doesn’t want to stop looking at Steve’s handsome face. His perfectly coiffed blond hair is mussed. Steve’s skin has taken on a peachy, damn near radiant glow. “Nap first,” Steve says.
He wants Steve to fuck him already. Tony can hardly take this slow gentle pace they’ve settled into and voices his displeasure.
“It was like losing Bucky all over again,” Steve continues. He’s stopped caressing Tony but still holds him close, a reassurance. “And if they had gotten your hands on you...like they did to him...God, I don’t—I don’t know what I would have done.”
Tony visibly stiffened in his seat, his back going rigid.
Steve could see the signs clearly because they were also a part of him. The trouble sleeping, the jumpiness, the hyper-vigilance. Tony had some form of post-traumatic stress. And if he continued down this route, it was only going to get worse. If Steve’s memory served him right, it
time.
Happy, Tony decided, was a lost cause. Taking matters into his own hands, Tony pulled up a web page on his phone. With one hand, Tony typed in the name “Aldrich Killian”. Hundreds of news articles popped up instantly. As Tony scrolled, he picked up bits and pieces of info here and there.
“Tell me, how do four Infinity Stones end up in the custody of Captain America, himself?”
She began to pour herself another cup of tea. “You called me, ‘ma’am’.”
“I’m at peace, Cap.”
Tony shakes his head, clearing his head of puzzles and Steve and piercing stares.
"Is that why you pounced on me?" Tony says, raising his brows. "You were worried about me, Rogers?"
"Congrats on your new additions, by the way," Carmen says.
“I’m not doing anything,” Tony replied.
Tony should tell him. He should tell Steve he loves him, but something holds him back. He doesn't want Steve to think it was just a spur of the moment ordeal. He wants Steve to be sure that he loves him, that his soul has completely intertwined with Steve's, that they're
"Why did you follow me?" Steve asked, cutting all pretenses. He had wanted to be alone, and being in such close proximity with Tony without the curious gazes of the others left him unsure of his next move.
!" Tony shouted internally.
I don't own Marvel or the MCU but if I did, it would go a little something like this.
Tony wiped up the bright blots of blood that had welled up from where he had injected himself. It had taken him forty-eight micro-repeaters and two weeks of workshop binges, Tony only pausing to rest when he quite literally couldn’t keep his eyes open and had nearly burned himself (several times) with his soldering iron.
The boardroom feels like a matchbox with Steve so close to him with no buffer. Steve’s making himself useful and tidying up the papers and glasses strewn about the table. Tony pours himself another finger of scotch, lets the whiskey burn his throat on the way down. He needed something to ground himself. His eyes follow Steve’s every movement like magnets. Heat blossoms low in his belly when he remembers how Steve had touched him like he was nothing but a toy for Steve’s pleasure. The thought shouldn’t turn him on as much as it does.
"Of course, sir," JARVIS says.
“Fine,” Tony sighed, before pointing a finger at Dodger. “Don’t blow this, buddy.”
Pepper looks unconvinced, but mercifully, she lets it go. "Hmm. You guys are friends now?"
for more marvel/stony content!
The bot paused in its mission to sweep up the trash strewn across the floor of Tony’s workshop. “Hi, DUM-E. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.”
to be treated like this. To be called someone’s bitch, their whore, their slut, or any variation of the word. But a piece of himself, something primal and pliant, purred at the thought of being
“Just a little favor between two pals, right?” Tony says just to dig the knife in a little deeper. “
“I don’t necessarily think my life experiences are going to be relatable to anyone else,” Steve said.
Darkness greeted him. He could only make out vague shapes, mere outlines of objects, wherever he was.
. His suit, now unzipped to his navel, only showed a sliver of Tony’s torso. The edges of Tony’s nipples poked out of the opening, both nipples peaking in the cool air of the office. He turned to face Steve head on and awaited further instructions.
Steve's fingers are relentless against his prostate, scissoring and splitting him wide open.
Pepper removed the headset from his head and tilted his chin up so he could look her in the eyes. She was beautiful from this angle. From all angles. Her hair was up like usual, pretty bangs framing her heart shaped face. Her dark blue eyes were shining with love—that had to be love, there was no other word for the depth of emotion in them—and for a second, Tony felt like he couldn’t breathe.
When Happy answered the video call, Tony was greeted to the sight of Happy’s entire forehead, bringing a smile to his face. Happy could be such an old man with technology sometimes.
to go back. Steve was in his heart now, whether he liked it or not.
“No, you did not kill yourself.”
"Me, too," he replied and really, what else was there to say?
Perhaps he should have seen it coming. After their little...tryst in the shower, Steve had asked him about his kinks.
“If coffee grounds and expired blueberries count as food, then yes.”
“Sticky,” Tony says, deadpan. They hadn’t gotten the chance to clean off after their little...excursion on the helicarrier.
"I'm still deciding," Tony said, a playful note entering his voice.
A muscle in Steve’s jaw jumps. “Yes. I would.”
to be telling the truth meaning that he had no choice but to listen to the Red Skull.
Carmen's face is red when Thor straightens back up, releasing her hand. After that, it's like the others shift into gear. Clint apologizes for his comment. Bruce offers her a kind hello until it's just Natasha who steps up until she's right in front of Carmen. Even though they're the same height, Carmen stiffens up, looking at Natasha like she's about to get chastised.
“One session down!” AJ said. “Fifteen more to go and I’m so goddamn excited for all of them.”
“The face slit?”
"I've seen your work," Tony says, latching onto the topic for what it was—a way out. "You were good."
"Excuse you! I'm great company!"

, began to change.
He says so, and Steve fucks him again, all slow and deep now that they've taken off the edge. Tony spreads his legs willingly, pouring all of the love he has in his body into every kiss, every caress to Steve's skin. He didn't have the courage to say it just yet, but he wants Steve to feel his love. It takes them no time at all to come again, Tony's toes curling, his fingers sinking into Steve's skin.
“Tony, sweetheart,” Steve moaned. “I’m gonna come. Where do you want it? Down your throat?”
Fortunately, Tony’s good at thinking on his toes. “Alright, you caught me, Romanov. I just spent the last half hour rocking Rogers’ world.”
“Look at me,” Steve said. “Look at me and get on your knees like a good whore.”
“I stand corrected,” JARVIS snarked once the fight had
“You brought a
“Okay, I’ll compromise. How about we talk to everyone we know, and see if we can set the other dogs up with nice homes.”
Tony yawned, stretching once more until he heard something pop.
“I know, I know,” he replied. “But I can’t stay. Not forever.”
“I’m not hearing a no,” Clint says.
Steve blinks at the abrupt change in their conversation, but he rolls with it, bless him. "Of what?"

dramatic.
“Nice save,” Tony muttered under his breath. Rhodey elbowed him in his side.
*A Whole New World plays in the background*
"If it's truly important, find me once the hunt is over," his father cut him off, giving him a cursory glance before rejoining his councilmen.
Tony watches Steve throughout the briefing. He's been watching Steve a lot more lately. Ever since that ride on the Ferris wheel, he's been trying to be more open, more inviting, Steve taking to his attentions like a starving man to a banquet. Steve's all business right now. His jaw clenched, he's scrolling through the digital files JARVIS compiled for them on a tablet with a single-minded focus. His free hand rests on his knee curled into a fist. Tony can practically see the rage in him rising like a tidal wave. He can't imagine how Steve feels, to devote himself to something, to
Their first assignment was a simple one, given that not many of them aside from Steve had much experience with art.
Tony didn't like the dark tone Steve's voice had taken on. He doesn't know much about Joseph Rogers, but obviously, it wasn't pretty. And given Steve's pre-serum height and the slew of health issues, Tony could put two and two together.
He vaguely recalled the others calling his name but their voices had faded to a dull roar in the back of his head. Tony’s words had sent Steve backward in time. One moment he had been sitting at the dining table, next he was at the Compound that wouldn’t exist for another three years and Tony was laying into him with barely repressed rage. He could feel himself falling, drifting listlessly in the restless sea of his mind.
Tony can't say that he's surprised. He knows he's a threat, even without his suit,
“Do Norse gods run on mortal time?” Tony mused.
Tony was to blame, too, for his absence. He could admit that. He had just thought, after everything that had happened between them, Steve would have been right by his side—not spending every waking moment fighting an invisible enemy.
“Thank you…” he began.
Tony panted, his heart beating like a drum in his chest. His whole body trembled with lust, fuck, he was practically
"Nervous?" Carmen says to him. She's tucked her pen behind her ear.

Carmen Solomita was an old friend from his prep school years. A fellow gifted kid, and the daughter of the iconic Italian husband-wife fashion designer duo, Isabela and Marcello Solomita, it was a no brainer that Tony and Carmen would become friends.
Tony's being unmade. He's unraveling at the seams like a worn-out sweater, and Steve's stitching him back together.

Only four HYDRA agents remain standing when they finally surrender. The rest lie, unmoving, the smell of blood and sweat and burned skin filling the room like a sickly perfume.
Almost as if summoned by their mention of him, the low rumble of thunder could be heard in the distance. What had been a clear, bright day, quickly turned into a gray, overcast nightmare as the God of Thunder appeared in a flash of lightning and wind.
“It feels good,” Steve said, twining their fingers together. “I feel…I feel at home.”
Steve's still looking away when he says, "I was going to tell you."
"No," Steve said, yawning. "My father doesn't care, and the councilmen follow his lead. Bucky knows where I went and knows to stall if anyone starts asking questions."
Had JARVIS had lungs, no doubt he would have sighed in that moment. “…Very well, Captain. In that case I will try my best to help you.”
Okay enough about me, enough about life, on with the story!
“I assume you have questions, Captain.”
Mark 42 slumped over and for good measure, Tony struck the suit in the chest, causing it to fall to pieces.
Pepper's eyes soften. "Tell you what," she begins, "since you're so adamant on working too hard to have some fun, how about I do it for you?"

without his suit.
On his last night in the tower, Rhodey had proposed a poker game which (in true Avengers fashion) turned into a bloodthirsty competition where every man was for himself.
Tony kisses him back.
“Yes,” he replied.
Making up his mind, Steve let out a tentative, “JARVIS?”
“What doesn’t make sense?” Natasha asks.

, ended up making a mess and somehow Steve found themselves pelting each other with flour and milk and cheese and anything else they could get their hands on. It had been the most fun Steve had had in years.
"Why do you wear them?" He asks, grabbing a carton of milk from the fridge and giving it a hesitant sniff. Tony's not the greatest cook, but he'll be damned if he didn't make the best hot chocolate in all of New York. Passed on from Maria Stark herself, he never used the instant powdered mixes that were so commonplace. After returning home from long days being a glamorous socialite or a generous charity organizer or simply being Howard Stark's wife, his mother would end the night with a hot chocolate in one hand, and Tony curled into her side.
He doesn’t know what to expect as Tony’s workshop comes into view. Every time Steve enters, it’s like he’s seeing it for the first time, power tools and inventions in their infancy strewn about like a child just got done playing with his toys. There’s nothing cold about Tony’s workshop. If anything, it’s filled with life. He stops to say hi to DUM-E and U, who roll up to him, waving their arms in what he assumes is excitement. DUM-E grabs him by the sleeve, rolling in the direction of Tony’s main work table.
She wore rich emerald green robes this time that brought out the magnificent blue of her eyes. One leg was crossed in front of the other as she leaned forward, propping her head up with one arm on the table. Steve’s hands itched for charcoal and paper.
"That's one," Tony jokes. "Can't think of any others?"
So, he’s single and homeless, technically, but overall it’s not the worst year of Tony’s life.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I finally started Star Wars. Why does it start on episode four?” he had said in a later one.
Tony rewarded him by grinding his hips against Steve’s. The pressure in his groin was building, his cock straining against the bindings of his trousers.
“You don’t know everything about me, Rogers,” Tony snapped.
"Hmm," he says and kisses him softly this time. It's been so long since Tony's been touched with tenderness. Steve moans into his mouth, and his arms come back up, perched on Tony's waist.
just as much as we need the armor.”
“Can you blame me?” Steve asked. “I have a handsome man in my bed kissing me awake.”
If he were a religious man, he could almost believe that he was meant to do this. That he was destined to fight by their side.
His servant, Peter, woke him bright and early with a chipper, “Good morning, sire,” before throwing his curtains open. The first rays of the rising sun filtered in through his window…and right into his face.
, from a HYDRA goon sat on his workshop table. It operated like no weapon Tony had ever seen. Aside from his own repulsors. The energetic outputs were damn near equal.
And it
Steve had his own separate office space from Tony’s. Both of them had too much work to warrant sharing a desk, and according to Steve, Tony was too much of a distraction. Whatever.
"Okay, Romeo," Tony says, laughing. "I get it. That's three, I guess."
“I must admit, I am surprised that
"Okay, I take offense to that," he interjects. "Bruce keeps me in line, promise.”

“You want to know why?”
“Oh, you’ve
Clint shrugs. "What's not to like? Just want to know what we'd be doing."
His knees. He needs to tuck his head between his knees. Tony does just that, breathing in deeply through his nose and exhaling through his mouth.
Steve draws back, looking slightly more at ease. “What have you been working on then, wonderkid? Want to compare notes?”
Steve rested his head against Tony’s. His breath came out in pants, and goosebumps flared up and down Tony’s neck. Tony felt sleepy and like he was floating on a cloud all at once.
“Aw, that’s cute,” Rhodey coos, “I’ll be sure to go easy on you, Tones.”
Fighting back a grin, Steve knew he had made the right decision.
have been something wrong.
, was ridiculous. No, in Steve's eyes, Tony was a comet; set ablaze and always on the move. Nothing short of an immovable object could stop Tony Stark from doing what he wanted. Nothing except death.
Tony will thank him later, for now, they have to keep on moving. They need to clear space for Natasha to land.
The courtesan tilted his head, stepping towards Steve.
"Since now," he says. "I can't do my part, Romanov?"
come together like this, but today is different. Today, Tony almost died
“That…might actually work,” Thor said.
“Stone has the rather annoying habit of running his mouth.” Steve’s eyes locked onto Tony’s, practically
Tony shook his head. “It’s not the same. Long distance is hard even with things like Skype to help ease the distance. Steve, I…I really want to work things out with Pepper, I
For a terrifying second, JARVIS hesitated to respond before saying, “My diagnosis is that you’ve experienced a severe anxiety attack.”
"Nothing much," Tony says before Natasha can say anything incriminating. His eyes dart down to the last stuffed animal in Steve's arms. It's an Iron Man bear, of course, all done up in the telltale red and gold of Tony's suit. "What's the deal, no one wanted him?" he says, nodding to the bear.
"What's next?" Steve says, breaking Tony out of his daze.
Steve doesn't say anything, just presses into Tony harder, like he's trying to seep into Tony's skin. Tony throws a hand over his mouth to stifle his moans even though it's just them, but Steve catches his hand and intertwines it with his.
getting the last word in with Clint.
Steve exhaled through his nose, some of the tension leaving his form.
Tony says nothing at all and Steve disappears like a tendril of smoke curling into the air.
Peter broke off a piece for himself, his eyes fluttering shut at the taste. The seeded loaf seasoned with dill was no doubt more decadent fare than Peter had ever eaten.
"Besides," Steve says, leaning in close to him. "I'm gonna clean the booths out. I'm trying to beat the super spies. Can you keep him safe for me?"
guilty, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Bruce’s words echoed in his mind. It would only be five seconds. Blink and you’d miss it.
Steve lifts his head from Tony's throat, and Tony brings him down for a kiss. They exchange languid, sweet kisses like they have all the time in the world. They don't. They don't because HYDRA's back and worse than ever, and Tony knows down to the marrow in his bones that there's something else on the horizon. Something ruthless and out for
“It’s a date, Rogers.”
A year ago, Tony never would have thought Captain Steven Grant Rogers to be capable of lying. But now, as Rogers' bright blue eyes stare into the depths of Tony’s sunglasses, trying to see behind them, he doesn’t know what to believe. Steve could be lying. Maybe the others are stationed near the coffee shop, ready for Steve’s next command. Or he could be telling the truth. Maybe it was just him and Steve. Alone. Together.
Tony's not a liar, but he
“Yeah, I miss you too,” Happy grumbled. “But the way it used to be. Now you’re off with the ‘superfriends.’”
Steve's grip tightens on his cock, and Tony bucks up into his fist, his hands flying up to make contact with Steve's skin. "I don't want to wreck you," Steve says, eyes burning. "I want to worship you."
At that, Steve let out what had to be the first genuine laugh he had had in a long time. “No need to explain yourself. Stark has a way with words, I’ll give him that.”
,” she said, stressing the last word. “I strongly suggest you get therapy.”
For all of his boasting, it wasn't Rumlow who brought down the stag they had tracked for the better part of the afternoon. It was Bucky. He had slit the beast's throat with his sword after Tony, of all people, had lamed it with a well-placed shot of his bow. After that, the party had warmed up to Tony, and Rumlow stayed out of their way. They broke their fast in a clearing with well-trodden ground, not too far from the game park entrance. Servants made quick work of the rabbits and stag, skinning and salting the meat with precision.
“Hmm?”
okay.”
Steve and Tony deal with the fallout of their hookup.
That piqued his interest. “Lunch?”
“If by that one, you mean Dodger? Yes.”
“When’s the last time you got a good night’s sleep?” Rhodey asked, shaking Tony out of his memories.
,” he thinks wryly.
The little boy leaned forward. “How did you get out of the wormhole?” he whispered.
“That’s why I said I got it,” Tony snapped. When Tony looked down, he had crushed the crayon into two. The rushing in his ears got even louder. Tony placed a hand over his face and closed his eyes.
“When’s tall, blonde and handsome showing up?” Tony asked after
Romanov’s eyes narrow when Tony and Steve enter the briefing room.
Steve swallows before nodding. Tony repeats the process on Steve's front, running the loofah across Steve's pecs and the firm muscles of his stomach, delighting in the way Steve seemed to tremble at his touch.
into him. Tony felt feverish as all of the blood rushed from his head straight to his groin. He clamped his thighs together to at least try to soothe the ache, but Steve stopped him, one booted foot resting against Tony’s crotch, making him whimper. He wanted to rub himself against Steve’s boot or grind down on the firm sinewy muscle of his thighs,
“I wasn’t—”
“Oh, really? Well, I didn’t notice that, at all.”
Steve nodded slowly. “It is. It is a job.”
Steve swallowed, his throat suddenly tight. "Is that a bad thing?"
And it feels good. Too good. It’s cheesy, but it’s almost like Tony was made to fit into Steve’s arms, his head slotting into place underneath Steve’s chin. Tony’s hair is soft, softer than he thought, against Steve’s neck.
“So,” he hesitated. “This isn’t some form of Heaven or Hell?”
, another chaotic battle that Steve and Tony always seemed to lose themselves in. Steve’s beard is rough against his cheeks and Tony wonders what it would feel like to have that same burn on his thighs. He moans into Steve’s mouth at the mere thought and Steve takes that as an opportunity to slip his tongue into Tony’s mouth. It’s nothing but a filthy slide of hot flesh against flesh, but it has Tony weak in the knees all the same.
“Gods,” Steve swore, forgoing his manners. Damn it all. Damn his birthday and damn his crown and damn his
Slowly, Steve opened his eyes. Tony was lying on his side, facing him. A lazy grin stretched across Steve’s face. “What gave me away?” He asked, his voice still hoarse with sleep.
“Not out of spite, sir. Think of it as motivation for you to rest.”
“Hey, I’d hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?”
Each of them said their goodbyes then. Clint had shaken all of their hands, (except Tony who he had punched in the shoulder. Steve thought Tony liked it though, given how wildly he grinned afterward,) while Natasha gave them all cool nods before they sped off in the opposite direction of the way they came.
Steve turned to look at Tony. Tony was staring up at the trees, his eyes following the flight of a hummingbird. "Is this an interrogation?"
All of the Avengers seemed to sober at that thought.
Instead, she had put on a record, held out her hand, and asked him to dance. And what could Steve do but say yes?
“Tony,” Steve says, voice sounding gruff like he hadn’t spoken aloud in days.
to brag.
“Then I would have you call me by my name,” the courtesan stated. “And I would call you by yours.”
So far, the Mark 42 would only come when he made the correct gestures. It was convenient, but if Tony was immobile (which happened far more often than he liked to admit) then the prehensile suit would be useless. Unless the suit could react to his brain waves.
Thor smiled brightly, clapping Tony on the shoulder. “Thank you, Stark. That is quite generous of you.”
"Where's Solomita?" she asks. "I want to know what we’re doing.”
"You got it, boss," Tony says, and then, just to be an ass, he salutes him too. "I will avoid all near-death experiences to the best of my ability."
Happy continued. “I couldn’t make his face at first, right? You know I’m good with faces.”
She's crossing things off on her clipboard when Tony and the Avengers following behind him pull up in front of her.
“I liked it,” Jackson said with a small grin. “Not too many people joke around me these days,” he added.
“Alright,” Tony says. “Just give me a second.” He carefully reassembles the HYDRA gun and locks it away far from Hill’s too-observant-for-her-own-good eyes.
“Adorable,” Steve said.
—and wished that she would look at him if just for a moment.
