They sit together for a while, Tony drifting along in a haze of painkillers, until Pepper pats his hand and tells him to get some sleep. He wants to argue but he really is tired. His eyelids are heavy and his body aches and he wants to be in his own bed, but he supposes a crappy hospital bed is better than a cave floor. Pepper stands and Rhodey's hand squeezes his shoulder once before it's gone, then Tony has to choke back tears again when Rhodey slides an arm around his shoulders and hugs him gently.
It’s good, fucking amazing, Steve pistoning into him, hard and deep and perfect. It’s not long before he feels himself getting closer, hears it in the way Steve’s breathing changes that he’s close too, as Steve’s thrusts become less controlled. Tony hovers on the edge for endless seconds and without warning Steve reaches down to palm Tony’s cock, strokes once, twice, and then he’s coming, vision whiting out at the edges, and he can just hear Steve choke on a breath as Tony tightens up and Steve thrusts one last time, deep, and he’s coming too.
He’s starting to really feel the December cold, cupping his bare hands in front of his mouth and blowing warm air on them. Across the street, a laughing group of 20-somethings exits a shop marked “The Hideout”, hands wrapped around steaming cups of coffee. Tony calls it fate and redirects, heading for the coffee shop.
It should be surprising how easy it is to fall into his old ways, but it’s not really. He’s back to being that genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist of old, and he wonders how he stayed away for so long,
"You're an idiot."
“Hey, hey, I got you,” Tony says breathlessly when they break away from each other. Steve’s panting harshly, and he realizes he’s shaking, tremors racing up and down his body. He closes his eyes and tries to get a hold of himself and Tony chafes up and down his arms. “You’re good, you’re fine, I’ve got you,” he says again, voice soft, and Steve exhales a shaky breath, opening his eyes.
He's screaming Tony's name as he's running, watching the scene unfold down the bombed out street, 50 feet above the ground. He sees the armor jolt, electricity running down the limbs and causing sparks to fly at the joints. Sees the other Doombots closing in on their position. He's still a block away when Thor flies by and enters the fray, Mjolnir taking out opponents left and right. There's the sound of rending metal and then the leader drops, taking Tony with him down to the pockmarked street, minions following in their wake.
, some part of his mind whispers.
“It seems General Ross is leading the mission, sir,” JARVIS announces.
Natasha’s “Affirmative” is cool and collected. Thor says, “Aye, Iron Man, consider it done!”, and Hulk roars. Tony figures they’ve got it covered.
“It’s fine, you didn’t want to be rude, I get it. Don’t worry about it. It’s just easier to skip all the bullshit sometimes, you know?” Tony says wryly. He gives a little laugh that Steve decides he hates and throws back the rest of his drink before signaling for another.
He makes eye contact with Yinsen as there’s another rumbling, and it sounds like an explosion this time, a little deeper and a little closer. They cover their heads as some bigger rocks come tumbling down, and the electricity flickers but steadies after a moment. Tony wants whatever it is to just stop already, it’s putting their project in danger, but he doesn’t, because what if it’s a rescue? What if they’ve found him? Tony Stark’s gone missing, there’s got to be people searching for him. And Rhodey was there, in the hum-vee behind him, and Tony doesn’t think it got hit in the attack, and what if it’s him, coming to find Tony finally?
“So, you said something about a drink?” Steve says breathlessly. Tony laughs and kisses him again only to have Professor Bones clear her throat loudly
“You’re kidding.” Tony gives her this look that says,
“Tony!” Steve waves at him from the Gryffindor table, Tony gestures Tasha on to their own table and strolls over.
“Tony, you’re a genius!” Steve pulls him into a hug on their last fitting day, watching Bucky toss the quaffle from one hand to the other, grinning madly. “Isn’t he a genius, Buck?”
Steve begs him not to, but Tony is determined.
“No, it’s fine.” Tony waves away his apology, “It’s just I had this idea for sports prosthetics. More feeling, a hell of a lot more movement and way more human-looking. But it is just a prototype so…”
“No, he’s not dating anyone or no, you won’t answer a simple, innocent question?”
Tony’s smile switches from easy-Steve-smile to schmoozing-the-public-smirk in one second flat. “Sounds fun.” Steve is still grinning, so he must not have understood either.
If his step has a bit more bounce than usual, no one could prove it’s all Steve’s fault. Even if it is.
Tony’s brain fires and he grins. He’s always loved showing up dear old Dad.
Steve looks incredibly hopeful and happy. Bucky looks like he’s bitten into a lemon. Steve nudges him, “Yes,” he grinds out.
Pepper sighs again, “You’re going to make a mess of this.”
Tony has never enjoyed a game so much. Pepper would say it’s his penchant for showmanship, and Tony thinks she might be right. A little bit.
Steve turns bright red, “Thanks, um. I wanted to ask if you knew who the commentator is? Since Darcy decided against it this year.”
Still, having Rhodey around helped Tony to finally feel somehow better. Not fully. No. But the direction seems to be right. Because even if his friend clearly went through hell staying at the other Tony’s side, it seems that he survived and he’s happy to see him. They hugged for at least damn three minutes after they saw each other when the Quinjet landed. And hugging isn’t really Rhodey’s thing. So yeah, Rhodey is Rhodey. And he deals with Tony like he would in any other situation. Even the stare of silent judgment is still there. And it’s great.
“I hope staying behind isn’t troublesome—” he starts.
“Wow,” Tony huffs, his voice heavy.
Yes, he looks younger. And yes, his hair is free from the silver shine at his temples and in the neatly groomed beard. His body is well defined and strong. His eyes shine with something that Steve had never seen on Tony before on such a level. It’s some kind of carefreeness and unconcerned nonchalance. His smile is easy and approachable. He still holds himself with pride but also without the weight of all the years he doesn’t remember. But this is
Steve hears Natasha’s paintball cane shoot out a few new rounds and then Clint cry out in horror.
Tony nods, pulls out his phone and types in the code he’s programmed.  For a second nothing happens, then the first giant distraction blast shoots soil and rock 100 feet straight up into the air before a ridiculous BOOM sounds around them. The rest of the explosions cascade from there-- like the world’s noisiest Rube Goldberg device.
“I am incredibly aware of that,” Tony says.  “It is totally an Area of Awareness.  Consider me secure.”
“Please-
Tony feels a shiver run down his spine.
“You’re sayin’ you’re treating me like a friend,” James says. There is so much skepticism in his voice it sounds accusatory.
“A couple of hours,” Steve says.  “More than I’ve been getting lately.”
James listens and gets that look in his eyes that he gets when he’s trying to reconcile what he’s being told with his own experiences. He stretches out his knee again a few more times, and stares at it so hard, it’s almost like he’s trying to pin it to the floor.
“You didn’t,” Steve says quickly.
“Where to?” Natasha asks.
A haunting.
Once they’re finished with lunch, Nat and Clint leave their place-mat-weapon sketches behind and Steve pockets them without them seeing.
It’s almost 4 AM.  Steve stands, doesn’t say anything because he doesn’t want to interrupt, and heads up to the penthouse to grab some coffee and a snack.  He makes it back to the lab in under 10 minutes.
“I already filled it out for you,” she says.  “You just both need to sign it.”
Tony huffs in response.
Apart from his Sunday afternoons spent upstate, Steve’s life is mostly back to normal. The Avengers train together during their days and hang out most evenings. Occasionally they fight some bad guys and everything turns out okay.
Bruce puts down his phone and telegraphs his movements as he sits it on the ground. They both need to prove that violence isn’t imminent.
Steve laughs. “I think my previous therapist would disagree. I didn’t want to talk to her. I didn’t have anything to motivate me. Now I do.”
Sam joins him, looking equally as beat. “No clue.”
“Hydra made me special clothes.  My metal arm is bigger than my skin arm, so all these shirts either feel tight around the metal, or too loose around the skin.  There’s no in between.”
Steve smiles in relief.  “We’re going to need a few places to go out to eat that don’t serve alcohol.  Places where we can be treated like we’re normal.  The diner has always been a safe space for me.  I don’t have a lot of those anymore.  And I just don’t want Tony to feel like he’s lost anything more than he already has.  Which is a lot.  He knows how bad he messed up.”
“I’m worried about him,” Steve says.  “About his personal life.”
“Can I help?” Steve asks.
“Wanna get some air?”
Steve tugs Tony down, so they can both sit on the floor where they are easily reachable.  Dum-E seems adorably determined to trace a heart on top of Tony’s head.
"Sit tight, Cap.  Believe it or not, we've got this."
Then Natasha walks over to Happy and leans in close.
“Dammit, Tony,” he huffs.
Again, there are tears in her eyes but this time she doesn’t try to hold them back. They roll softly down her cheeks as she closes her eyes, ducking her head.
“But why can't Captain Rogers know?” Mantis still presses on the other side. “It’s a beautiful feeling. I liked it so I’m sure he will too.”
“Everhart,” Steve adds impatiently.
“Would you just trust me for now?”
Tony smiles brilliantly, undoing the first three buttons of his shirt. “This one’s been here for ages, but FRIDAY always checks before we go out if my choice of the day survived the Snap.”
“Okay,” Tony says slowly, looking around to check if anyone else hears that. “I wouldn’t call that happy but— Wait, how do you know that?”
“What if he doesn’t want this?” Tony rises from his seat and goes to the bin. Throwing his melted ice cream into the trash, he adds with panic in his voice, “What if his position is like Pepper’s?”
“I found one with you, boss. It’s from October 17,” she proposes.
enough. You are everything that I want.”
And Tony’s a good kisser. Of course, he is. He’s always been. Because when he kisses, he gives all his attention to this. He gives all, everything of him, to Steve. It was like that for the first time too. Back then and all the other times. But the hesitation of their first kiss from before is completely gone. Instead, it’s replaced by the new boldness that makes the whole experience overwhelming but also so damn blissful.
Pepper snorts, “Small victories?”
The light is low but this time it’s clear enough for the high-res cameras to reveal all that’s important. It’s taken at the very back of the house where on the lower level and hidden in the depths of the garden hangs the swimming pool just above the surface of the ocean. Its glass walls are lit by a subtle light to illuminate the water in an inlay of colors. Among them, it’s him and Steve. They are naked, unashamed, and tangled together. And that isn’t even the biggest surprise. It’s really not a revelation that Tony had it hard for this guy. He also isn’t shocked by the fact that it happened only after the events in Siberia. After all, he knows himself enough to know it must have been fucking thrilling to have Steve come to him like that. No. It’s not what makes Tony hold his breath. What really strikes him is the intimacy of this moment. It’s the way they look at each other. It’s how the kisses are desperate and hungry. How they clearly can’t hold on long enough without being close to each other. How they both look far gone in whatever this is. How Steve is relaxed and sure and so shamelessly open and willing in Tony’s arms.
And Steve suddenly knows where this is going. He straightens and drops his hands with resignation. What is worse, Pepper's knowing that he knows. And she just looks up at him with these big, green eyes of hers that still shine with tears and sniffs for a good measure of looking completely miserable, and Steve realizes that he can’t say no.
But in his sixth year, it’s like someone cast
Tony grins all through the rest of breakfast and Gryffindor’s predictable win later. As he’s going back up to the castle, talking and laughing with his friends, he sees Rogers ahead of him still celebrating with the rest of the Gryffindors.
Peeves starts singing it in the lavatories while students are trying to use them.
He can see a really nice pair of shoulders, a sharp jawline, blue eyes, and – oh, wow – what an ass.
“You want to go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?” Steve’s eyes light up. He starts to smile, opens his mouth –
Barnes wolf whistles somewhere to Tony’s left, “Shut up, Buck.” Steve yells before kissing Tony one last time and dashing off to the showers.
“You mean she was finally banned,” Wilson said, shovelling eggs into his mouth.
Tony casts casual glances at the Gryffindor table, watching Rogers eat quickly and quietly. He looks a little nervous but determined. Tony assumes that’s how he is for every game. This one is Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff had a crap team this year. He keeps telling Parker he should try out, but the kid has zero confidence in his Seeking. Even though he’d be
Tony grins, “Is that a yes?”
Professor Bones sends him a narrowed eyed look that Tony returns with a charming smile, “Of course Professor, you’re rather pretty too.” She rolls her eyes, “And they’re off!” Tony clutches the podium with both hands, a manic grin on his face, quaffle is immediately taken by Natasha Romanov of Slytherin. She’s pelting down the field, Wilson’s going to head her off. Romanov passes to T’Challa. T’Challa to Carter. Carter to – oh no! She’s intercepted by Sam Wilson of Gryffindor. Wilson’s taking it back up the pitch. He dodges a bludger hit his way by Gamora. Another one by Nebula! The Slytherin chasers are racing to catch up with Romanov at the head. They’re on Wilson’s tail! Can they catch up? Oooh!” Tony hisses sympathetically as one of the Slytherin chasers gets blindsided by a bludger. “Looks like Carter’s taking a beating today, just got a bludger to the side from the pretty large but largely pretty Thor Odinson. Wilson’s almost at the goalposts, neck and neck with Romanov! Wilson passes to Rhodes. Rhodes enters the scoring area! He shoots! He – He’s
Tony stops in front of him and grins wider, “I’d like you to test my new prosthetic arm.”
In his seventh year, Tony gets serious.
“Don’t you have a whole company of guinea pigs waiting for you?” Bucky makes to turn away. Steve grabs his arm.
charm every few minutes just in case.
Steve chokes on nothing and practically flies out of the Great Hall.
Tony is a genius.
Two weeks later, after a few owls and many omniocular recordings of Barnes in action on the Quidditch pitch Tony makes his move.
“Alright professor, alright.” Tony folds his hands behind his back. “Why don’t you go shower. Then we can see about a drink. You know that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy on the seventh floor?” Steve nods, “Meet me there.”
“Or I’ll tell Pepper.”
He next sees Steve by the lake during his free period on Friday. He’s splayed out with the sun shining in his hair and his tie covering his eyes. Both arms are flung over his head in a relaxed, comfortable way. Tony can’t help but imagine him in much the same position in a bed. Maybe Tony’s own tie circling his wrists.
Tony Stark doesn’t know Steven Rogers even
Pepper tells him later that Peter said that Jane said that Thor said that Bucky said that Steve looked flushed when he came back from the library.
“Had enough fresh air for now?” Steve asks.  He sounds a little disappointed.  "They're going to be relentless until we eat the fries."
“Oh, well you spotted him this morning right?” Bucky asks, pulling out his phone and thumbing to the exact same picture Clint had shown him a minute ago.  He flashes it toward Tony.  “He was here.”
It’s been 6 weeks since SHIELD fell and 5 weeks since Tony called Steve. Between all of Steve’s efforts and Tony’s satellites stalking they haven’t turned up one single decent lead on the Winter Soldier. Steve has made more than half a dozen trips abroad, and Natasha and Sam have done the same. The only reason Steve’s not on this particular wild goose chase is that he took a bullet a few days before while poking at a Hydra nest and Natasha had threatened to nail Steve’s feet to Stark Tower if he didn’t take a few days off to rest.
“You know how to use any of these?” Steve asks Bruce, gesturing to their assortment of weapons.
Again, there’s that pang of... friendship? Tony knows what it’s like to have friends, he’s had plenty of friends. He’s just not been around this kind of... domestic?... friendship. There are words for these things, but it probably speaks volumes that Tony is having a difficult time finding the right vocabulary for what’s going on.
“Half a chicken breast isn’t dinner. Eat,” Bucky insists. “We’ve been watchin’ you not eat for a week.”
Of course.
“Bruce is boring,” Bruce says. “And also speaks about himself in third person. Historically not a good indicator of popularity or sanity.”
Steve nods.  “You do have a point.  I could tell you what I like and don’t like about the ones I’ve tried so far, if that helps.”
Steve realizes maybe this is a conversation they should have had a few years ago.
“You’ll have it,” Steve says. “Everything I just said is mine to give, and there’s no one else I want to give it to. Only you.”
Steve is going to be the death of him.  A hot guy who actually
Bucky motions Tony over and explains what he’s doing, and Tony takes over double checking security codes as Bucky heads down to the basement to presumably sort through more weapons.
They move to the sofa and Jarvis orders them dinner from SoupSoupSoup.  They watch a game show while they wait.  A security guard brings up their food to the penthouse and looks surprised when Steve’s the one standing there waiting at the elevator.  The man gives him a courteous nod and hands over the large, brown, paper bag.  Steve thanks him before the lift doors slide closed.
The Avengers are in a fight that they just might lose. Hulk gets drawn away early, out of the fray, and Steve’s fighting off more bad guys than he can count. More than he can take on alone, that’s for sure.
“Fuuuuck,” Tony mumbles.
It only gets more obscene from there.  The abuse spewed in Tony’s direction sets Steve’s nerves on edge in a way that makes his hand itch for his shield.  Today would be a good day for target practice.
“Tony and Natasha are still out,” Steve greets him.
.  But all of that leaves me with one big question and I’m not going to get an answer if you walk away.”
“No,” Steve says, without having to give it a moment’s thought.  “I think you’d be a great dad.  Have you been thinking about it?”
Pepper nods, as if to say ‘yes, that’s the point.’
what I need, or we could break into a medical center after hours.  It’s not fair involving you any further.”
“We didn’t talk,” Tony shrugs.
Clint gives Bruce a knowing half-smile and then yawns.
Steve’s calm tone has the desired effect and Tony takes his hostility down a notch.
Which startles Bruce. “This is way out of my depth.”
Tony’s words are a lifeline.  They wrap around you and make you feel safe and calm, because if the smartest guy in the room’s not worried-- you’ve got nothing to worry about either.
“I’d rather not,” Steve says.
“Surprisingly, yes,” Steve admits. “But I like hearing it from you best.”
“That depends,” Tony says. “Did you taste the lemon?”
“What’s Plan A right now?” Steve asks.
“Do you have to split the points?” Tony asks the both of them.
And since Tony’s never left well enough alone a day in his life, he finally allows himself one question of his own.
They fall silent.  Steve shifts a little awkwardly to reach for his water.
It’s almost like they’ve choreographed this, seeing how well they avoid each other.
Steve relents.  “Sometimes I think I might be in over my head, but that’s not a reason to give up on somebody is it?  And even if it was, I wouldn’t.  That’s not how I’m wired.  When I’m in, I’m all in.  To the end of the line.”
“You know Matt and Foggy, then?” Tony asks.
“Thank you, Dr. Stark,” the taller of the three says.
“Is all that okay?” he asks.
“I don’t think there’s anything selfish about all of this,” Steve says. “The reason you're worried is because you’re afraid you’re going to hurt me. That’s the opposite of selfish.”
Steve feels more than a little glad himself.  If all he can do to help their cause is keep an eye on Tony-- well, there are worse ways to spend a day.  Like alone.
“I told you that you could look me up on the internet and you said you absolutely wouldn’t.”
“I understand why you might put me on a pedestal,” Steve says.  “Even if I don’t think I deserve to be there.  But Tony-- please believe me--”  He pauses and waits until Tony meets his eyes.  “I don’t feel like I’m settling.  I don’t feel like I could do better.  We’ve both got issues.  We’re both doing the best we can.  I see you as my equal, always, in everything.  I swear I do.”
What he has taken quite personally is his temporary suspension from the team. Yes, he probably deserves it for punching Rumlow off the ice. But other people have done that before and gotten punished with less. No. This isn’t about Steve’s momentary temper flare. This is because the coaches think he’s a distraction.
This time James takes a few seconds to process Bruce’s rambling. Then, like before, he nods.
Steve looks positively gleeful as he types out his message then presses send.
beneath their hands. Except he doesn’t die. His heart stops, everything stops, and then his healing factor repairs something necessary for life and James gasps in breath as the sirens shift to speeding beeps again.
“Glad you made a friend,” Bucky says. “Even if it’s the one person in the league gettin’ more shit than you right now.”
“Nope,” Tony says, with a shrug. “I can’t. Thank you and goodnight.”
Clint’s eyes go to the hallway, but there’s a sort of splashing sound as the water stops so Clint continues.
Tony had felt terrible then, and tears had welled up in his eyes.  She pulled him close and wrapped his new quilt around him.
“Hell yes,” Clint agrees.
Steve comes up behind Tony and leans down so he can wrap an arm around Tony’s chest and kisses him on the ear a few times.
James’s eyes blink open. He stares up at the leaves and though he stays very still, his whole body tenses. The heart monitor alarms go off as his pulse begins to race.
Tony shrugs.  “Undergrad is a blur.  That’s what happens when you finish it in a year.”
“I was just thinking... they’re expensive. The really good art pads, I mean. I know that’s not a problem for me.  I can afford whatever at this point, or if I couldn’t I’d just need to mention it once and you’d make sure I had one by dinner.”
“No no no no no,” Tony mumbles in horror.
“It wasn’t me,” Clint whines.  Then seeming to realize he doesn’t recognize the voice, he slits open his eyes and spills coffee on his shirt in the process.  “Awww, coffee, nooooo.”
“I don’t hate you,” Tony says.  “Hate isn’t the right word.”
"Walk me through how to get from here to there," Tony says.  "And write up an office transfer for me.  See if we can fit him somewhere up here."
Before Steve can answers, Tony turns and storms out.  The doors slam behind him.
It comes out as nearly a shout and Steve has to force himself to keep his hands steady in his lap so he doesn't accidentally slam a fist through the car door.
“I appreciate you all letting me in on your game,” Tony greets.
Steve laughs at that.  “Seriously?”
“I do have that ability.  I do not always have the correct permissions.  What is it you would like deleted?”
“They’re both alive,” Steve assures him.  “The hospital staff promised they’d come get us the moment either of them are out of surgery.”
“I can’t tell you whether the Bucky you knew is still in there,” Bruce says. “Not because of any professional need to keep that information to myself so much as I honestly don’t know. Without ever having interacted with the original, I’ve got nothing solid for comparison.”
“If you’ve got something to say, say it,” James prompts.
Rhodey. Right. Of course he’d come over first thing.
“Fine, on art,” Tony says, lifting his hands in a sort of confused surrender.  “Is there something else I can help you with, Captain Obvious?”
“Food sounds gross.”
“He didn’t leave,” Clint assures him. “Well, okay, he’s stealthy as fuck, so yeah, maybe he left. But not in any way I could tell.”
Steve shakes his head, hoping against hope JARVIS will take pity on him, as he follows Tony into the elevator.  Thankfully, there’s no music at all as it begins to descend.  Only the gentle hum of movement.
“Designs like this didn’t show up on the market for years after he retired,” Tony said.
Tony’s never been happier with a decision to bring someone home. At least a decision that wasn’t entirely based on sex.
Tony looks surprised by the thanks.  Like he’d been expecting Steve to be a little less grateful and a little more annoyed.  It makes Steve want to track down every single person who has ever stomped these science outbursts out of Tony’s spirit and teach them a lesson in kindness.  With his fist.
“It’s like some sick sort of penance,”  Rhodey says.  “It got worse after Afghanistan.  The more people he saves it’s like the more he’s got to punish himself.”
Honestly, James sounds so protective of Steve both Clint and Bruce try to hide their smiles. It doesn’t work and James looks unimpressed, which only makes Clint laugh.
Bruce puts a hand to his face.
Sam gestures vaguely toward Tony. “Are we all absolutely sure that’s not what this is?”
“Marginally,” Tony says.
Bucky, Bruce and Clint end up in the back seat and Tony and Steve sit in the middle row.  Steve squeezes Tony’s thigh and gives him a relieved smile.
“I’ll hop up there with you,” Tony offers. “Show you the ropes. Then we can skate.”
“Uhhh-- Steve?  Sorry, I’m back.  Since it sounds like Tony’s there, you can put this on speaker in case he’s got any thoughts. But-- well, I mean, I
Nanna’s house is a brick-front townhouse, built along a street of similar brick-front townhouses.  Every door is nearly the same shade of green, some more faded than the others.  There are flowers in nearly all the window baskets, and trellises with ivy.
“It wasn’t made for him,” Natasha explains. “Or for you, Bruce.  An old friend sent me an ICER, in case I ran across an enhanced operative who wasn’t going to be taken down with anything else.”
She tosses Steve her StarkPhone.  A text conversation is displayed on the screen using the secure channel Tony’s set up for all the Avengers.
“We want in on the YouTube channel,” Clint declares one afternoon, halfway through dessert. “I’ve got a shit ton of ideas.”
“Do you know where he is?”
That makes Clint and Bucky’s faces go dark.
“I’m sorry,” Tony sighs.  “I can’t stop fucking up.”
James makes a wild rush for the stranger and the stranger shoots him twice.  The tranqs are clearly effective because when James drops to the ground, there’s no doubt he’ll stay there. Bruce can see he’s out.
...Except he can’t resign.  He’s fought so hard for this company.  So hard to have what should have rightfully been his all along.
Like the world is suddenly in technicolor. Amazing. Terrifying. Unknown.
“And what about the metal on the download chips?” Tony asks.  “The detectors Bucky mentioned would pick them up, even on a cleaning crew.”
Clint’s forehead is creased with worry and for the first time it occurs to Bruce that this is the kind of injury that could end a career for an archer.  And maybe more worryingly, Natasha is staring at Bruce like she’s never seen him before.  Like watching the interaction between him and Clint is something new and strange.
“Clint,” Bruce says, straightening up. “Let me look at your arm.”
You can find me on tumblr @
“So Pepper--” Steve starts slowly.
“I don’t need the chair. It was not a malfunction,” James states softly. As if he knows his opinion won’t matter, but he can’t help but try. “I don’t need the chair.” His voice wobbles over the words.
,” Rhodey shouts into the phone.
“I thought they would tell you,” Steve says helplessly.  “And I’m not... good at talking about this stuff.  I don’t have much practice.”
Clint crosses the room, passes Bruce and gives him a hearty pat on the back as he moves toward his duffel bag. He picks it up by the strap and slings it over his shoulder before walking out the front door.
Bruce reaches for the swinging arm of the new scanner and brings it to rest about a foot over James’s face.
“We leak a press release,” Natasha says.  “Make it sound like the feds are going to charge someone innocent with one of Barnes’s crimes.  Give a number the public can call if they have more information then hope like hell that JARVIS is better at tracking calls than Barnes is at hiding them.”
“Uh... yeah.  I can... I can do that,” Tony says.  He sounds unsure.
They don’t talk for long. They’re exhausted from the game and the late hour and the weight of it all. Steve sleeps in a guest room. Tony tosses and turns and hates the hollow space in his bed. Steve should be there. Tony completely understands why he isn’t, but it doesn’t make the empty pillow taunt him less.
Steve raises an eyebrow.
“Trust me,” Tony continues. “I’ve done what I can to re-educate her, but she’s determined. And I would hit epic levels of cool if I could get her an autographed puck. I know I could buy one on ebay, but that’s not the same. Not to her, anyway. She’s a goalie for a traveling team. The Wildcats. And there’s no one for her but him.”
Tony draws out her name into a whine, “Pepper,” He sticks his bottom lip out. She tries and fails to hide a smile.
“Yeah, Hogsmeade sounds fun.” Bucky slings an arm around Steve’s shoulders. “We were planning on going with some of our friends. Wanna bring some other people too? We’ll make a party out of it.”
Tony, despite himself, feels his heart warm just a bit. “Here,” He summons his Transfiguration Year 4 textbook. It lands with a loud thunk in front of Clint who’d just been dozing off. “You get StarkNotes.” Clint smacks him before settling into sleep again. Wanda beams, taking the book immediately and sharing it with Vision.
“Roger’s is a good man. I doubt he will accept.” Pietro smirks. Wanda kicks him under the table.
By the end of the year, Bucky has a fully functional arm that looks so much like the real thing it wouldn’t be possible for people who didn’t know him to tell the difference. Bucky can tell the difference, and so could anyone holding both hands at the same time, but otherwise?
They end up at the Three Broomsticks of course, and Tony manages to snag a seat by Steve while everyone watches Bucky show off his new and improved arm. Their whole group barely fits at the two tables they’ve dragged together.
Steve coughs and pulls his arm away, “You’re a great guy, Tony.” He slaps a hand on his shoulder.
“Yes,” Tony restrains himself from doing a fist pump, but it’s a close thing. He has his dignity.
He does end up commentating the last game Steve’s seventh year, much to the confusion of all the Professors, who can’t figure out why no one in their stand can be heard by the crowd. Tony has Natasha renewing the
“Sorry, Bucky’s not good with polite conversation. He means thank you, but–”
Tony’s eyes rove over him, “Oh, I don’t know,” He bares his teeth playfully, finally meeting Steve’s gaze, “You’ve got pretty good genes.” The bell tolls across the grounds. Tony heaves a sigh, “Oh bother, late for class.” He flashes a grin before standing up and striding away, “See you later, Rogers.”
“I told you that’s a horrible name for it. Your notes
Steve rolls his eyes and huffs out a breath, “Don’t do that.”
“Guess you’ll have to find out,” Tony grins, “Bye, Steve.”
“Look, Steve, I–” and then he can’t speak because Steve’s warm mouth is slanting against his. He’s sweaty, and he smells like three hours of Quidditch, but Tony wraps his arms around him anyway, deepening the kiss. Steve growls and actually lifts him from the ground. Tony moans a response and buries his hands in Steve’s short hair, tugging gently.
He starts training Wade Wilson (no relation to Sam Wilson, apparently) in his commentatoring ways. Wade’s words, not Tony’s. It’s more or less so Wade can woo a certain Peter Parker. Tony gives him his blessing – though why the lunatic would ask for
“No problem. Not like I had many other limbless Quidditch players to test it on.” Tony winks and laughs when Steve sputters into his butterbeer.
Muggle-born. Orphan. American. Adopted fathers were military and stationed in Europe. One year below, Tony. Excels in Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts. Not doing so well in Charms. His best friend is James ‘Bucky’ Barnes, also in the year below him. The kid who lost an arm to a dragon. He has a prosthetic from St. Mungo’s, but it’s definitely not state-of-the-art. They grew up together.
It’s nearly an hour before the snitch is even seen, Slytherin makes two more goals before Gryffindor is back in possession, “Gamora hits another bludger Barnes’ way, he dodges, he – he’s distracted? What the bloody hell are you staring at mate? Ooh! Ouch! That’s what you get for staring into space! A nice shot from Drax Douglas AKA the Destroyer, and you can see why he’s called that. Be careful, will you Barnes? I’ve already made you an arm, I don’t want to make you a nose too. Honestly, what was he – oh! The snitch!” There are gasps and cheers and a loud horn coming from somewhere in the Gryffindor stands. “First-year Seeker Hope van Dyne blasts past poor Barnes with his broken nose. Looks like Slytherin Seeker Pietro Maximoff has caught onto the action! Come on, Maximoff! You can do it van Dyne! Ooh, that’s got to hurt!” There’s a groan from the crowd. Tony winces, “Van Dyne knocked off course by Gamora’s bludger, reckon she’s got a broken leg. Walk it off, Hope! Maximoff was hit by van Dyne’s flailing limbs, and the snitch has gone. What a shame. What the hel-eck was Gamora thinking?” Tony huffs. “Strategy people come on.”
“Steve—“ Tony reaches out, one hand still cupping his cheek, and Steve makes that sound again, pained, like someone has punched him in the gut, and Tony’s heart clenches. He’s horrified as he watches Steve’s eyes fill.
“Steve,” he tries again. Steve makes an affirmative noise against his skin and the vibrations make Tony shiver. “Bed. Let’s— Bed,” he manages to get out. He feels Steve nod, then he’s being kissed again and he forgets why they stopped in the first place.
Sam grips his shoulder firmly and Steve’s eyes burn. He blinks furiously.
“I like you,” Tony says simply. Steve’s heart flutters nervously. He’s full of so many conflicting feelings, guilt and desire and shame. Mostly he just want to make sure Tony’s alright, though, so he fills a glass of water and brings it back to him, sits him up and has him drink the whole thing before laying him back down. He goes back to the bathroom to refill the glass and set it on the table next to Tony’s head. Tony blinks at him, eyes hazy, barely tracking. Steve brushes a stray lock of hair out of Tony’s face and Tony smiles at him, grabs his hand and twines their fingers briefly before letting Steve slide out of his hold, eyes slipping shut.
"You won't, Steve," he promises, and he's going to be smarter from now on about life or death decisions because he's not going to give this up easily. It's fucking Captain America, he'd be a fool if he let this slip out of his fingers because he couldn't think twice.
He’s drinking again, more than he used to even, and he can’t seem to stop, doesn’t want to stop. He doesn’t know how he got here, how it turned into this, but it’s just another chapter in the fucking legend that is Tony Stark, having something good and fucking it up completely.
“Sure,” Tony replies, walking over to accept the offered paper from the guy’s outstretched hand.
He pauses in his routine, exhaling explosively and leaning forward, arms resting on the hanging bag and head falling forward onto his forearms. He tries to clear his mind as he catches his breath.
“Honey bunches of oats, I’ve missed you so!” Tony’s squeezing tightly as Rhodey lifts him off the ground, laughing.
A second later, another message comes through.
That’s the Captain America voice, and Tony groans again, Steve shooting him a glare. Tony rolls out of bed, because that’s the end of this morning’s shenanigans, he might as well start his day.
Tony bursts out laughing. He laughs and laughs, hunching over, hands on his knees. It's not even that funny, definitely not funny enough to warrant his reaction, but he can't stop, he laughs until his ribs hurt at the absurdity of everything. At Cap’s stupid joke, at the pile of turkey on rye on the table, the stack of papers waiting to be signed. At Captain Fucking America sitting on his ratty old couch while he absolutely loses his fucking mind, at Pepper catching him working on Iron Man when he was supposed to have given it up for good, Pepper’s face when she realized what exactly he was working on, Pepper leaving him…
“Steve,” he says, pleads.
“Tony, I came to apologize,” he says earnestly. He’s got the puppy dog eyes going, but Tony’s not falling for it this time.
"So what you're saying is, we're alone..." Tony grins lewdly, and Steve blushes. It's adorable. He pushes himself up, ignoring the twinge in his side, because this is worth it. "There's nobody here..." He leans forward, lips stopping inches from Steve's, breath ghosting over his lips, "to interrupt us..." He trails off, eyelids heavy, eyes flicking between Steve's.
“You have the Times?”
Steve’s eyes flash but Tony see’s Sam’s hand squeeze his shoulder in warning. Steve lets out a frustrated sigh. “No, it’s not Bucky, I told you it wasn’t like that.”
Steve stops him. “Tony, it’s okay—“
Steve glances at it curiously and Tony grins. “JARVIS, say hello to Captain Steve Rogers. Steve, JARVIS.”
Tony gives Steve an abridged version of his own background, though he skips over the shitty stuff (which, depressingly, is most of his childhood and a good chunk of his adult life). He tells Steve about Jarvis, the butler, and growing up with him, and he tells him about JARVIS, the AI, which Steve finds fascinating and has him asking all kinds of questions about computers and technology and artificial intelligence.
to the amount of text, they don’t summarize it.” Bruce shakes his head sadly, “I need to stop teaching you muggle things.”
“Why would I do you a favour?” Steve elbows him, but Bucky shrugs.
The next time Tony sees Steve is at breakfast just before the fifth game of the season. Tony’d been studying up on Quidditch since their library encounter (“That was not an encounter, Tony.” Silly, silly Pepper. There were sparks. He saw them. Steve saw them.) The more Tony read about it, the more interesting it became, and not just because of Steve. He memorizes all of the fouls, tactics, and rules just out of habit.
It’s like Steve pushed it out of him, with his bright smile and his blue eyes and his big hands. Tony’s noticed those hands over the last few months. Those are some beautiful hands.
“That’s it,” Tony says.  “Exactly like that.”
!” Steve apologizes, dropping to his knees to help tug Tony out from under the platform.  “Are you okay?”
“Thanks,” Tony says.
And for beating you at hockey.
“Got it,” Bruce says. He pockets the phone, feeling it buzz again as he does. It’s an address that he turns to show James. James nods as if it’s perfectly reasonable to have a safe house in less than a minute. Bruce has earned an iota of trust; he wants to make good on it fast.
It’s getting louder, as more people in the lobby realize Tony is walking through.
“That’s not it,” Clint argues.  “I’ve never been good at the indoors or talking about my feelings.  I’ll be back in an hour or so.”
“We good Jarvis?” Tony asks.
Steve smiles and leans down to sign his name.  Since Pepper had filled in the rest, it only takes a signature and a date.  He looks at Tony and holds out the pen.  Tony grabs it and shifts so he can sign.
Want to dye your hair green?  Good for you.
The next twenty seconds are agonizingly long. When he got to Nat, she’s bloody all over. Dead bodies litter the ground around her. She’s too weak to stand.
“Damn straight,” Tony nods.  “I’m a genius.  Don’t doubt me, Rogers.”
Bruce makes a death gesture that even he doesn’t understand. Sort of opossum-like, with his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his head tipping to the side. Clint laughs.
“Bruce... keep me updated?” Steve asks. His voice sounds a little more polished. He's trying harder to keep it together now.
Bruce nods. “You really will. I can see it now--”
Tony groans, but he’s smiling.  He’s smiled more in the last three days than in the whole year previous.
“You are.  So either he’s lyin’ or he’s less there than he sounds, or he knows exactly who he is and he’s torturing me for God knows why-- and I just--”  Steve pauses.  Everything in him wants to apologize for saying all this but Tony wasn’t wrong.  Steve’s been bottling it up, and maybe just for a minute, it’s okay to let his guard down and be honest.  “I just want to grab him and shake him and make him give me my friend back!”
can’t get anyone to date him for more than a month or two.”
They walk out of the hidden room into the basement, then up the stairs and into a flurry of activity.  Clint’s on the phone talking in what sounds a lot like Mandarin Chinese.  Bucky’s got papers strewn across the table, printouts of some sort, that he’s cross-referencing with the words on his laptop screen.  A large (mostly empty) sleeve of Fig Newtons sits between them.
James considers it, then shrugs indifferently. “No one's stopping you.”
“You don’t owe me an explanation,” Steve says gently, after Pepper trails off.  “I know he doesn’t like me.”
They both take a minute to stare at it, before Tony speaks again.
“We’ve got less than a minute, Cap,” Clint says urgently.
“If they mistreat you they weren’t good people in the first place.”
“I like maple syrup for dipping,” Tony says.  "If you bring me breakfast again."
“I’m the one who introduced Clint to an old friend who remained in HR at Stark Industries. I thought you could use some looking after.  I’ve known Obadiah Stane as long as I knew your father and I thought-- thought he might be up to no good. I couldn’t have guessed that you and Steve would meet, though.  Or fall in love.  I’m smart but I’m no Fairy-Godmother, Cinderella.”
Nanna’s smile is so full of mischief she looks a good twenty years younger.  “Oh darling.  I think it’s time we show you our weapon cabinet.”
I owed you for last night.
“If you’d stop being so needy, I wouldn’t need so many nights out,” a man argues.
“They’re based on my designs.  You don’t think everything I touch automatically gets the Stark logo on it do you?”
“Yeah. And I’m the damn pope.”
“Does it-- I know this is rude, but I’ve got to ask,” the male host says.  “Does it affect anything in bed?  The scars?”
“Well, it’s not for any brilliance on my part,” Bruce says. “I’m worried I might really be screwing him up, Steve.”
Tony shrugs.  “They wouldn’t have if you could touch them.  The real stuff’s in storage upstate.  There’s a lot.  You might want to go through it first to see what you want to take with you.  Anything else can stay secure in Stark storage until you’re living in something bigger than an apartment.  I’ll have JARVIS send you the address and you can pick up security credentials on the way out so you can go back as often as you want.  It’s all yours.  Go wild.”
“Was worried I’d come back to you moping,” Bucky says, once he turns. “Eating ice cream on the couch at noon in your boxers.”
Steve has to rescue the newspaper from the trashcan and dust off coffee grounds and some food scraps, before he can read the unflattering Letter to the Editor about himself. Bucky must have thrown it away before he left to catch the team bus.  Steve really can’t blame him. Buck has always been protective. Overly protective. And in some ways this most recent batch of hateful press has been harder on Bucky than it has on Steve.
“Such a bad idea,” Tony mumbles to himself as he checks himself out in the mirror one more time.
Tony can’t tell if this kid is hitting on him, or just being a brat, but it’s refreshing.  Bruce and Pepper are the only two people in the building who ever treat him like a real person.
Tony’s eyes light up with perfect mischief and his mouth forms an amazed oooo.  Steve doesn’t mind going to hell for a lie, if this is the reaction it gets.
“You think?” James asks, lifting an eyebrow.
“And just think. This is only the end of the first period,” Tony teases.
“Is it okay with you if I go?” Bruce asks James. “You can listen to the playback through JARVIS if you want to hear everything we discuss. No secrets.”
“Yeahhhhhh, I’ve known for a while now,” Tony says. “Unless you’re pregnant. That’d be news. But the whole you and Rhodey sneaking around like teenagers behind my back thing? That was pretty obvious before rehab.”
James’s shoulders stiffen. They hike on and he doesn’t reply for an awkwardly long time.
Every time Tony thinks Barnes’s story can’t get any worse, HYDRA goes and proves him wrong.  And the thing is (and this is a nasty thing) (a dark soul blot Tony will never reveal) (not even to JARVIS) (who probably suspects) sometimes Tony feels not quite as terrible as he should about what’s happened to Bucky.
This all sounds so bad.  The elevator comes to a stop.
“Took me a while to get used to the height,” Steve admits.  “I couldn’t stop tripping over my own feet that summer.  Bucky hated it.  Kept saying he was going to have to seal me in bubble wrap.”
Steve’s first mission with Natasha and Clint, once they’re cleared for return to duty, drags on for ten terrible days.  Steve has a feeling Tony’s tracking him, but they can’t communicate, so he isn’t sure.  It’d be against mission protocols for Steve to text Tony and as tempting as it is, Steve’s not willing to put his team in danger just to tell his boyfriend how much he misses him.
“Fine,” he says. “At least Jenny’s not a dick like the rest of you.”
“You gonna ask permission to breathe in my presence, too?” James asks. “Cause it’s gonna be a real pain in the ass when I say no.”
“I can’t help how I feel,” Bruce says simply.
“It’s your lucky day.  Next time make an appointment.”
Natasha’s on the next block over and Clint is on the rooftop of the parking garage in between them.
“I’m here, aren’t I?”
“Bucky doesn’t want to see me,” Steve says, sounding numb with disbelief.  “He wants me to stop looking.”
Again, no beta since this is a giftfic for the world's best proofreader, Imafriendlydalek!  Sorry you're stuck seeing all my mistakes!
*crack*
It happens while Nat, Clint and Steve are on a mission with Rumlow and his STRIKE team.  Everything goes fine until they realize their intel’s bad and they’re about 140 miles from where they ought to be.  They can’t get from one place to the other in time and the mission is called off.
The whole afternoon plays out like a dream.  They take paintball warfare to a whole new level.
“It’s okay,” Bruce says quietly. “It helps to breathe.”
“I’m sure she’ll be glad to hear that,” Rhodey says.
“You’re the picture of evil,” James says. “I totally see it. I mean-- forget every Hydra officer who ever smacked me with a cattle prod for moving an inch out of place. You-- with your consent talk and your helping me without asking for anything in return-- You’re the one I ought to be worried about.”
“We’ll be there in ten minutes,” Bucky says. “Stevie, can you get him out without being seen?”
He’s thought about it, of course.  Definitely considered proposing himself.  Also considered what a proposal from Tony would be like, and had wrongly assumed it would involve violins and skywriting and a thousand roses.  Tony’s romantic gestures were... big.  Always.
Steve stands and puts a hand to the small of Tony’s back to guide him through the bar crowd.  Steve uses his size to clear the way so there’s never too much of a press against Tony, and Tony appreciates it more than he can say.
You know what to do!
There’s something in her voice that sends a chill down Steve’s spine.
Steve’s mouth is on his before Tony has a chance to make any more words.  Steve’s hands are on his sides, tugging at his shirt and Tony’s brain goes blank except for a greedy refrain of moremoremore.  They make out like high-schoolers until they have to pull away to catch their breath.
“Half of them looked like they’d been crying,” Steve laughs, sitting down on the edge of the table. “You didn’t have all their pets kidnapped did you?”
Steve keeps his voice calm.  It doesn’t help.  Tony shakes his head ‘no’ almost violently.
“You want to come out publicly?” Clint asks dubiously. “On YouTube.”
Tony seems to relax.  “That’s good.  He could use more friends.”
Steve nods.  He doesn’t really trust himself to speak, but he is incredibly grateful that Tony’s plowing ahead.
“I’m going to hurt you,” Tony says desperately. Like Steve needs one last push.
“No address,” Sam deadpans.  “Believe it or not, he’s working hard to stay off my Christmas Card list.”
“I’ll give you your privacy,” Steve says, standing up.  He’s not leaving the tower.  He’s not leaving the vicinity of the door.  “I’ll be right outside if you need anything.”
“Aren’t you?” Rhodes asks.
It’s nice though. Nice that it’s his own face and not the Other Guy.  Nice that Tony’s renamed them for him.  Nice to have a friend.
“I have not observed any indication that he has.  You should know, Colonel Rhodes is here and he and Ms. Potts have taken turns staying for the last three days.  The colonel intends to leave now that you’ve returned, but he would like you to call him later this evening, when you have a moment.”
James spins the computer back toward himself and stands up to get a glass of water and a StarkBar.
There are only two seconds left and then it’s over.
Tony steps back up next to him and Steve realizes the few shop employees and all the other customers have all disappeared.  Tony’s taken care of it like he’s taken care of so many things lately.  His presence is steadying in a way Steve’s never noticed before.  Like just having him close is making it easier to think.
Steve’s so stunned by her plea it takes him a few seconds to put together a response.  “Wait-- you think I’m here to talk about kicking Tony out of the Avengers?”
If you're someone who has commented or kudos'd, you're the reason this fic has grown so much bigger! You keep giving me ideas for things to add. It's like non-stop motivation!
“What if you shouldn’t give me a new arm at all? What if I get that thing and start killing people with it?” James asks.
“Natasha thinks she’s funny,” is Tony’s only response.
“Yes,” James says.
Bruce hadn’t noticed James pulling out guns from anywhere, but now he holds one in each hand. Bruce follows him into the house and while James stalks around checking for danger, Bruce checks the fridge. It’s fully stocked.  There’s also a pile of new clothes on the dining table, which appear to be a random assortment of non-descript athletic pants, plain t-shirts, pajamas, socks and the like.  Exactly what a person who’d been on the run for six weeks would appreciate.
“Most humans are born with a capacity for emotions and feelings. There are definitely exceptions, but typically, a child is born and that child has emotions keyed in and ready to go,” Bruce begins. “That’s the... the typical state... of neurocircuitry. Umm.. the control mechanism that regulates thoughts.”
“Don’t cancel the fun on my account,” Steve says.
“I texted Bruce because I thought maybe he should look at you,” Clint cuts in. “Should have probably just asked him out loud. Or asked you. Or told you I was going to text him. Sorry-- I’m still not used to this touchy, feely, talky crap.”
“A Piggly-What-Now?” Steve asks.
“Why do you keep sayin’ deliberately?” James asks.  “Sounds like you’re givin’ yourself an out.”
“S’Hydra’s fault. We’ll have help here in five,” Clint insists. “QuinJet, with a medbed.”
Steve’s bacon-cheeseburger and fries are exactly what he wants. The large Iron Man milkshake makes him feel a little blue, though. Mae must notice because she gives it a nudge toward him.
That’s what Tony had said up on the roof.  Steve had believed him when he said it, but seeing this kind of sacrificial forgiveness in action is to see a kind of heroism that somehow outshines flying a nuke into space.  And that was really something.
"Jarvis, where's Bruce's office?" Tony asks, as he pushes away from his desk.  "And what time is it?"
The silence that follows the Captain’s outburst is the silenciest silence that has ever silenced.  It’s beautiful.  Golden.  It’s like the ultra quiet anechoic chamber out in Minnesota that Bruce is always threatening to lock himself in, only this is better, because it’s full of politicians simultaneously pissing themselves.  Silently.
*crack*
“Only when I’m back in the news,” Tony responds.  “Which I guess is most mornings these days.”
“I’ll show you dull,” Bucky says, raising an eyebrow.  “How long’s it going to take you three to get the blasts setup?” he directs to Tony.
Maybe it’s because Steve’s old.  Maybe it’s because he lived through a war and he’s lost so much.  Or maybe it’s because he’s stupid and in love.  Whatever the reason, Steve’s not angry with Tony.  He’s frustrated; not angry.
“Thank fuck,” Clint whispers, which is an incredibly confusing reaction to their situation until a second later a gigantic bird swoops over Bruce from behind. It draws James’s attention away from them and that’s when Bruce realizes it wasn’t a bird at all.  It’s a man. A man with wings, who lands behind James and raises a gun.
Bruce picks up on his reluctance and picks the scanner back up from where he’d laid it on the porch.
“After everything Tony Stark said about you four?” Mae asks, sounding unhappy.
“This is why no one sticks around for you, you know that, right?” Jonathan taunts.  “You’re pathetic--”
It’s his fifth or sixth Sunday in a row, and the holiday crowds have Steve shoved off to one corner, trying to remain inconspicuous.  It’s there he ends up next to a fancy gold plaque that reads:
Steve’s smiling again, and no doubt still looking at Tony like he’s made of something sweet. He can’t help it.
The table goes silent.  Hell, half the room goes silent.  Clint stands as well, looking plenty ready to have Steve’s back, just like any Howling Commando would.
“Umm excuse me what?” he finally asks.
The soldier walks on, as if Bruce hadn’t spoken at all. His hands are free of weapons, and he keeps them where Bruce can see them. That helps keep the Other Guy from shoving his way to the surface.
“That’s--”
((So you don't have to google!))
The way their seasons lined up, Steve and Tony’s team had played early in the season and they won’t play again unless they make it to the playoffs. Which seems more and more likely as the next few weeks pass.
Ahhhh.  Suspicion.  Well, it could be worse.
Bed time is not as awkward as Steve had feared.  Tony wants a shower, so Steve changes into some plain blue and gray pajamas while Tony’s in there, and when Tony comes out, he’s also in pajamas.  Red silk ones, because he’s fancy like that.
It only takes them a minute to pack up after James pulls the Stark Industries hoodie over his head. Bruce doesn’t let himself take a picture even though he figures Tony would be exuberant there’s a 90 something-year-old assassin decked out in Stark gear. Before SHIELD fell, Tony’d been working for months to get a tiny Stark logo on Steve. Anywhere.
Steve sighs when he hears footsteps.  Tony’s been gone all of twenty minutes since the BannerBar argument and Steve’s plodding through a part of Bucky’s history that’s making his stomach churn and his blood boil.
“That I’d done something shameful enough that you had to invoke your admin privileges and tell Jarvis my sex tape was a threat to the security of the Avengers? Yeah, that wasn’t my proudest moment.”
“Get Steve on the comm,” Bruce says. “He might have some thoughts. I probably should have connected with him already to let him know how James came through surgery.”
“You are heavier than y’look,” Steve complains, as Tony slumps against his side.
“Thanks, Buck.”
“I’ll make you a plate with some bread and cheese then.  You shouldn’t work on an empty stomach.  You’ll get light-headed.”
Steve looks at him questioningly.
“Shut up, Clint,” James complains.  “I wanna hear more.”
“Even better,” Tony says, feeling more unimpressed by the second. “Can’t you come?”
fired,” Bucky groans.  "Then whose gonna buy name brand coffee?
“I don’t doubt that,” Bruce says. “I gave up trying to protect Natasha and Clint from themselves a long time ago. If they think they can survive you, they’ll find a way. Clint invited us to stay here-- this place is his-- but you aren’t obligated to say yes. For now, the first thing we need to do is get some calories in you.”
He walks over to Steve, picks up a plate, and hurls it at the Quinjet ramp with as much force as he’s capable.  It shatters into dozens of pieces.
Milkshakes, no sex tapes, and life moving on.
“Nat,” Clint says. “And her sidekick. Five minutes. What can we do?”
Tony unwraps himself and takes one last drink of his coffee before standing.  He picks up the blanket and carries it with him to his room, draping it over the edge of his bed carefully.  He runs his hand over the soft edge and then sits.
“Is art the problem?” Steve asks.  “It’s not mechanical so it’s not important?”
Are Rhodey and Pepper there?
JARVIS is about to show you some scans of James’s shoulder and chest.  Something’s not right and I’m hoping you can spot the problem.
“It’s fine,” Steve insists.
Tony pulls out his phone.
“Is that a bruise?” Steve asks.
“Dude took you back to his private rink late at night. That’s more than nice.”
Tony raises an eyebrow.
Clint just beams.  “Consider it noted.”
“Well, I’m not standing here serving fries to the Easter Bunny, am I?” Mae asks.
Tony doesn’t have a chance to finish his thought as he’s grabbed by the arm and spun around roughly.
Tony taps his finger on the two feats worth the most points, each involving hand-written edits.
“Thanks?” Tony asks, as he shifts closer.
Tony could do that himself, if it came down to it, but there is something about Steve’s tone that helps Tony realize Steve probably needs to do this for himself.
“Want to put on pajamas?  I’ll take a quick shower and do the same.  We can lay down and nap.  I’ve missed you.”
That takes Steve by surprise.
“That’s trouble,” Tony inserts.  He bumps foreheads with him playfully.  “About what?”
Bruce nods and for the first time in a long time, doesn’t let self-doubt make him think his friend doesn't really mean it.
It takes Steve a few seconds to even remember what it is he’s supposed to be doing. Tony is too (wonderfully) distracting.
“I like it better than Planets Alive, but not as much as I like One World: One Sky.”
“Dork,” Tony coughs under his breath.
and you didn’t think to tell me?”
Steve tries to dig further into his own feelings.  He remembers something Bruce said.  One of Bruce’s concerns about Tony’s letter.
“This is awesome,” Tony insists. “Jenny’s going to love hers, and mine is going on display. Come on.”
Like finding Steve.  It's left unspoken but Steve knows without a doubt that’s what Rhodey means.
Steve still looks a little caught off guard by his entire conversation with James, but he still manages a small smile. “Yeah. I think that a lot.”
face because Steve is beaming.
“I like you, James,” Clint says, giving him a nod. “Too many people are afraid to sass Bruce.”
Tony isn’t talkative at first.   But when Steve asks him about the new strap for his shield, it’s the distraction they need.  Tony talks for almost 45 minutes straight about what he’s done to fix the strap, all the ways the new strap is superior to the old one, and the advances he’s made in material science over the course of half a week that might jump the entire industry ten years forward.  Tony's engaged and excited.  It’s fascinating.
It’s not a lie.  He would never leave a teammate behind bars to fend for themselves.  It’s just not the full extent of the truth, and everything in his mannerisms gives that away.
“Because you’re so fucking insecure you make me crazy.”
“Steve’s got an old computer up in his room,” Tony says.  “If he’ll let us rip it apart, there’s our circuit board.  Gun powder isn’t going to be a problem.”
“Can I ask you a question first?” Steve asks.  “Just one.  Then I’ll smother you for as long as you like.”
“They got him to a hospital but it’s not looking good. He’ll be lucky if they don’t have to take his fingers off entirely. And Tony-- that’s what I’m worried is going to happen to you. Maybe not your fingers, but
Bruce misses Tony. It’s a strange, unfamiliar feeling, to be drawn to something or someone. It seeps around the ever present anger in his mind, and numbs it. It drowns out the images of a helicarrier aiming a gun at him while he’s sitting quietly in an NYU library. He sleeps easier. He smiles more often, even if it’s only to himself. Tony keeps him entertained from 4,000 miles away, mostly with jokes, emoji-abuse, threats of dick pics, and occasional news of SHIELD and Steve and Natasha and what all went down in the end.
“I agree,” Tony says.  “You’d have deserved way better.  But you’re stuck with what you’ve got.  Now come on.  Let’s see what Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are up to.  It makes me nervous when they get quiet.”
Tony considers it.
“Thank you,” he says.
“Yes, coffee,” Kate says, holding out her hands. “Where’s mine?”
“The ones I could find.”
“James is awake and would like to see you. He can have some difficulty making requests so if he gives a nod in my direction you’ll need to go. Does that work for you?”
Something unclenches inside Steve and he takes a ragged breath.
Steve’s face does something twitchy and then he looks away.
“You’ve got a burner phone?” Tony asks, as Steve stands to go pull the window blinds.
“Yes. But that’s not why I’m up.”
Natasha laughs.
“Which ones were the K-rations?  Not all of us fought in a world war,” Tony reminds him.
“No.  I shot
“Had it going on,” Steve corrects. The picture makes him happy, but at the same time, seeing her floods him with a sadness that he’s too tired to mask. “She passed away a few years ago. Had a happy life though. Named a son after me. A grandson, too. The boy you saw tonight was her great-grandson, Steven.”
“I think I can handle that,” Steve agrees.
“You know Rogers and you would be the most difficult to kill if I couldn’t...” The soldier struggles for words.
Natasha taps on a panel and a moment later the front window of the Quinjet lights up with a view of Tony’s workshop. Steve’s sitting on the sofa with his head in his hands, and Tony’s at his workstation with enough holograms stacked over each other that you can’t see through the display layers. Tony doesn’t turn or acknowledge the call. From the set of his shoulders Bruce can tell his friend is in the Science Zone, and isn’t going to allow himself to be disturbed.
Tony feels a little guilty he's never asked this question before.  He probably should have.
“Like that matters?” James asks.
“If you talk to Steve, tell him maybe I’ll see him when I wake up,” James says. “If he can keep from getting himself killed between now and then.”
“Nat, think you could take us on a detour to HammerTech?  I think it’s time we pay our friends a visit.  And JARVIS, get Rhodey on the line.  I know he’s going to want to see this.”
“I’m sure Howard paid quite a bit for some of it,” Steve says,  “I’ve got all kinds of back pay so I can write you a check.  And if you have an agreement with the Smithsonian maybe we can work something out to keep some of it on display.”
“I don’t remember,” Tony admits. “I’m not sore so I must have. And since half the time I pass out on the floor of my workshop, I’m going to say this was an improvement.”
Clint flashes a smile at Bruce and Bruce tries to look stern but his smile gives him away.
It’s the best afternoon Steve’s had in 70ish years.
“I’ll tell him you said that,” Bruce says. Because he knows Tony will love it.
“Move to the bench and I’ll get right on that,” Tony says.
“Maybe Bucky was protecting his friend?” Bruce asks, not wanting to accidentally program any definites into the soldier. He knows just enough about brainwashing to know he treads on dangerous ground, and that he’s probably already fucking things up. “You said you’re Bucky’s corpse. Maybe there’s more of him left in there than just a body.”

Tony’s voice is a little shaky but the relief rolls off of him in waves. Steve pulls Tony near so he can give him a proper hug. When he lets go, they stay close, settling against each other comfortably.
