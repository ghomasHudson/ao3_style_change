Steve's heart hurt at the thought of losing Tony, seeing him standing there in front of him, Steve could only remember the times that Tony was taking away from him constantly. Tony was a mortal, Tony was going to die sooner or later, leaving Steve alone once more; that was the truth that Steve lived with and would continue to live with for the rest of his life. The thing was Steve doesn't want to shorten Tony's lifespan more than he already did, if Thanos was after him, then he was after Midgard, and by default, he was after the Avengers, his family… Steve knew that Tony would do anything to protect him, even if he was stupid enough to sacrifice his life, something that Steve would never allow, especially when Tony had Peter to think of. "Tony…" Steve stood up, taking Tony's hand in his gently, tightening them on the gauntlet of Tony's suit.
Sorry, no smut scene, mainly because I am not confident to write BDSM scenes at all, especially creepy ones. Though I hope you enjoy the little teasing scenes I left.
Peter paused a little then nodded his head at the logical answer, returning to his invention with a focused look on his face as Steve returned to tidying the kitchen, looking tired more than he was a few seconds ago. "What does 'Bambino' mean, Mommy?" Peter asked a few minutes later which made Steve bite his lower lip harshly that he tasted a little bit of blood.
' as he held Tony tightly, causing Tony to nod his head, not making any sound as he tried to regain his bearers.
It took a few minutes for the raccoon to place what Peter said in words he understood, and when he did, he snarled and start cussing and hissing and threatening; Steve on the other hand couldn't help how his face darken with rage, how could an uncultured rodent swear in front of a child? His child at that! "Enough!" Steve snarled as he took a step toward the rodent, his temper rising with anger as the rodent insulted his family; he would show that idiot what would happen when someone messes with his family. "You dare to insult my family and threaten me, not only that but you also dared to attack my home," Steve growled, putting Peter down and start walking toward the raccoon, he can feel the room getting brighter and brighter the angrier Steve became, and only now did Steve realize that it was him from the start; that Steve had finally retained back his divine glow after so long. "These crimes are punished by death; do you dare to deny them?" Steve hissed as he stood over the raccoon, taking a dark pleasure when he saw him shaking with his tail between his legs.
But Tony still wasn't over the fact how that idiot tried to flirt with his husband and getting close enough to kiss him if it wasn't for Tony throwing an ax at him in his anger. Because of that, Tony was now prowling through the streets of New York to find the idiot Zemo, mainly because he wanted to cut his tongue and dick and few other things before bringing him back home. Whistling softly, Tony's eyes survey the alley hoping to find the rat hiding in the dumpster like the trash he was; just how dare he? Every time Tony was forced to remember how the man not only insulted their marriage by claiming that Tony was unfit but also tried to kiss his husband, rage course inside him and he nearly shriek in rage; even Bucky wasn't that insulting and he is madly in love with his husband!
', in the distance, he was sure that he heard footsteps rush toward him, but Tony ignored the noises; Tony can feel his strength leaving him and he was getting heavier and heavier…
Fury couldn't help but throw one last glance at the small boy before he continued his way, many questions swimming inside his mind and the Alpha planned to find some answers to them. Starting with Nattalegg and ending with the mother of the small child… if the boy is who Fury thinks he is then maybe… just maybe…
!" James snarled, his loud voice made Tony wince, and he glances at the stair for a second, afraid that Steve will come down to investigate the noises.
Really, it was so annoying that Tony's teeth nearly shattered as he grind them to try and stop his snarl from leaving his throat; out of all time for everyone to make his life a living hell, they decided to do it on his wedding day? Just why? Tony never did anything wrong and tried to destroy their lives and happiness so why were they trying to do this to him? It took Serpentine sending those uncultured fiends one harsh look followed by a murderous glare from both Steve and Tony for everyone to be seated once more, looking like they were forced to swallow a lemon as the wedding continued before their very own eyes. Tony was sure he heard a heart or several breaking when he and Steve kissed passionately in front of everyone, which made Tony happier than he had the right to be; serve them well, who do they think they are for standing in the way of his wedding and happiness? Tony was so going to kill and poison everyone who showed up to his wedding after this. Most of the Addams family seemed to share his opinion and sentiment because he was so sure, that they actually cast a hex or two at the normal guests who showed up; Tony just have to ask Serpentine to remove the hex from Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy, because those three actually stood with Tony in this one, not against him, even with their massive crush on Steve.
"He is alive?" Tony starts sobbing when Steve nods his head at that. "They are all a-alive." Tony calmed himself down, wiping his tears away. "W-what about s-Stane?" Tony stuttered, and Steve bit the inside of his cheek as he heard the fear in the Omega's voice.
." Whispered Natasha to herself, giving Steve a mysterious smile when he scowls at her; his friend's sense of humor was always the worse, it always made Steve feel bad more that it made him feel good. "Anyway, tell me, what's your new boy toy work as? You said he was in the military, what branch?" Natasha changed the conversation one hundred and eighty degrees, and Steve welcomed that change.
"What did Bucky do, Pete?" Steve asked in a joking voice, causing both Bucky and Peter's head to snap in his direction, the twin expression on their faces caused Steve to chuckle at the wide-eyed look the two of them send his way.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, anxiety, asthma attack, near mental breakdown, and who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
So when Tony finally arrived in the kitchen, he saw Natasha sitting on the floor while hugging her legs, whimpering as she rocked herself back and forth, all the while muttering about
." The female huffed, ignoring the boy's protests as she picked him up and rushed away from Fury as fast as she can while throwing Fury cautious looks like the Alpha will follow them any minutes now and beat them.
!" That was all the warning Tony got before he was attacked by Rogers, and by attacked he meant strangled to death with the man's muscled arms as the man pulled him in his embrace and nuzzled him like his life depending on it, and from the corner of his eye, Tony saw Pepper glaring at him, which made him tense like a bow… he brainwashed Pepper…
The necklace was so beautiful, so elegant and pretty that Tony couldn't take his eyes away from the necklace that was decorating his neck; Tony couldn't help but feel that his Mother was with him, he nearly swore that he felt her standing beside him. Tony couldn't help the feelings that were bubbling inside. "Thank you." Tony whispered as he gazed at his father through the mirror.
The sight before him nearly caused Steven to laugh out loud at such a display; his son seemed really closed with Petrus to let the boy talk to him like that without glaring or huffing. "The bear is not going anywhere, Petrus, the two of you can see the bear whenever you like." Spoke someone behind Steven, causing the Omega to grit his teeth tightly when the king's voice filter through his ears, the anger that vanished after his talk with Nicolaus return full force when he was thrust into the dilemma that was the foolish king. "The two of you can go and see the bear if you want, I want to have a word with the queen, just wave to Jamti and he would show you the kill." The king continued after throwing a hopeful glance toward Steven who was forced to smile tightly when he saw his son and Petrus gaze at him with hopeful and sparkling eyes.
"No!" Tony screamed in terror, his heart hammering in his throat the thought of Stane and his father finding him and doing this sick joke, made his breath fasten even more. He scrambles off the bed, his socked feet slipping on the floorboards, and stumbles over to the kitchen, he was thankful that he didn't fall and hurt the baby. It's too dark to see clearly, and he slams into the wall, still unused to moving about in the new space that was his home. On the kitchen counter, there were some supplies he picked up in town planning to do some fixing of his own, and he fumbles blindly through them, knocking over the jar of instant coffee and sending the saw to the floor with a loud clatter. To Tony's horror the thing that was under the floorboard, shifting back and forth beneath Tony's feet. Which made Tony stamps his foot and swears his hand closing around the smooth wooden handle of a claw hammer.
The woman's words made Steven pause as he took the woman in. "I wish I could believe you, Mrs. Rhodes, I wish I could." Steven said which made the woman open her mouth and close it not knowing what to say which meant that it was Steven's cue to leave and he did, he rushed toward his room, slamming the door to his room shut and taking off his clothes, going to the shower hoping that a long cold shower will calm him down.
Anton paled when he realized that he turned to the naked Omega, once more, which meant that the Omega will not let him live it down this time, that Anton turned to face him on purpose. Thankfully, the Omega was already dressed by the time, which left Anton baffled at how fast the queen was; Anton was sure that he just heard the Omega get out of the lake, how did he dress up this fast? The amused and mocking smile the Omega was donning made Anton's lips twitched down as he finally realized he was played by the said Omega. "You are a hazard, you know that?" Anton complained which only made the Omega's smile widen even more at that as if he was pleased with himself that he got under the Alpha's skin.
3-Slappaðu af, ekkja. -Calm down, Widow.
"Oh, and who are thee to tell me what to do?" Steve said teasingly as he tickled the pup once more, which got more laughter from the pup who tried to squirm away from the Alpha's firm grip. "Captain America will capture Spider-Man and rule the world, and no one will stop me!" Steve said with twinkling eyes which made Tony grin at the challenge in them.
"I'm here Dad," Tony whispered holding his father's hand tightly, making the older man blink and look at his son.
"So what kind of hair cut are you going after?" The barber asked them as she gets everything ready, sending them encouraging look and soft smile when she was done. Bucky shrugged at the woman's question, but Steve saw how nervous and frightened the Alpha was, which made Steve squeeze his hand gently and turn to the woman with a smile.
Steve's eyes only soften as he pulled Tony and Peter in his embrace, whispering '
On another different and serious note, brain injuries are not a funny business. Most of what we see in TV shows with coma patients is depicted as somebody waking up from a massive sleep a bit confused, then looking at the calendar and becoming even more confused before continuing to act completely normal. Not surprisingly, that's not true at all.
Shaking his head, Steve went to his room, planning on taking a long bath and soak in lavender-scented water to relax his muscle. Steve did just that when he returned to his room, throwing his clothes in the hamper and lowering his body in the warm water, letting out a sigh as his muscle relax one after the other.
was dead, couldn't handle Jarvis pleading looks that always begged him to do something. Steve couldn't handle this madhouse anymore, so in the end, he talked with Peggy about him wanting to have a place in Shield that he wanted to go on missions once more that he was getting sick of waiting here. Peggy took pity on him and starts sending him on missions once more… he was grateful.
(See the end of the chapter for
The sight before him caused Tony to recoil from shock and gaze at the… baby… with mistrust in his eyes, wondering if he was hallucinating or that he finally lost his mind. Tilting his head to the side, Tony took his time studying the squirming bundle, taking in his pale skin, the tuft of brown hair on the top of the baby's head, the pale blue eyes of a newborn filled with tears.
If Steve thought that it will be easier when they reached wherever they were going, then he was so, so wrong because when they reached the big tower Thor screamed about (Which was covered with so many mirrors and glass it was stranger than anything Steven saw in all of his long life), he was then lead to a strange room that has many things Steven wasn't even familiar with but the things he was made him relax, and with the help of son of Odin he was able to sit on the sofa.
Only when Steve's eyes fell on Tony, did Steve's body finally relax from the tension that he didn't even know sized his muscle. His Alpha looked like hell, with dark bags under his eyes and pale face and shaky hands, even while sleeping, his Alpha's hand was holding his tightly, trying to stop his shaking and failing at that even when he was unconscious.
"Every investor needs a lab… do you think you can take the first step?" Tony's heard Steve's quiet words, words only meant for Tony to hear and no one else, he looked at the Alpha to see him holding a screwdriver, one that Tony recognize, the one he used when he made his first circuit board, Tony gazed at the Alpha then at the tool than at the Alpha, seeing the gentle and encouraging look in his eyes, which made Tony's eyes sparkle a little at that as his hands slowly inched toward the tool, gently taking it from the Alpha's hand…
"You will get used to it Clint, after all, it's not every day that you get your atoms ripped off and then attached once again." Steven said as he stretched himself and then he took Edith from his pocket with a small smile, wearing the glass and see how it activated the second he did it, Steven really missed the AI, but sadly he couldn't use it when he was on Asgard, least something happened to her.
So with that Tony walked around the place, awing at the glassy surface he was walking on, it was probably the reason why his slid was smooth. Suddenly, Tony's eyes widen and his jaw dropped, was it possible… yup, he was inside the hole that the fucking meteor who hit him made! That made Tony walk faster toward the center, already planning to find that meteor and give it a kick or two before sitting on top of it until Shield or his aunt find him, whoever finds him first though his bets were on his scary aunt and her terrifying husband.
It made Steve turn the TV off and stand up shakily; keeping a tight grip on the baby that was sleeping in his lap, their… no, his baby was a split imagine of Anthony, with his messy tuft of dark brown hair and chocolate dark eyes, the only thing his baby got from him was his nose and pale skin tone, other than that, his baby looked like Anthony to the smallest detail, it made Steve smile a little and turn around, intending to go to sleep this unpleasant experience away, away from that… that 'Billionaire, Playboy, Genius' … his love will always take pleasure of his genius being recognized first, not his money or dating statue.
Tony's voice snapped Steve out of his panicking state, causing Steve to sob harder and harder, causing Tony to become frantic. "Help… Tony… Bucky was… Bucky…" Steve couldn't even finish his sentence, because not a second later, Steve's eyes widen when he saw a speeding car break through the lines of trees, ramming into his car, leaving Steve screaming in terror when he was flipped over.
In and out, in and out; Tony can do this, he was finally calming down a little, and OK, maybe Pepper was right on this one, Tony will defiantly do this again. The next pose was a kind of OK one if Tony had to say for himself just as Tony did the wheel pose, a breeze ruffled Tony's hair making him blink his eyes, wondering from where the ghost of wind appeared.
"… I nearly forget, here." Tony said giving Steve an envelope, the Omega blink at him before looking at the envelope with wariness, taking it from the Alpha and opens it to read through it, Tony didn't know what happen, one minute Steve was reading the papers that informed of his debts being paid, about the future treatment for their son in Jarvis' hospital was already paid, and the next the Omega was having an asthma attack, Tony didn't know how that even happened but the Alpha act fast and got his inhaler from his suit pocket giving it to Steve who was having a hard time breathing.
It was when his son changed into his PJ and was ready to bed; Steve finally got the courage to answer him. "How is my birthday boy, doing?" Steve asked as he entered the room to see his baby putting the presents he received in the places he wanted them to be.
Steve only pressed his lips tightly after Tony explained how he found Harley, the boy being on the run for ten days, Betty's call, and what Tony told his friend; it was exhausting when Tony woke up today he thought of nothing but buying cakes and sweets for his family so they will enjoy them after a hard day of working and school, what Tony didn't imagine was finding his son's best friend being on the run and probably starving himself. Who knows what kind of unsavory people Harley was forced to socialize with? Who knows where he slept and what he spent his days doing? How could Betty not tell him anything when she already knew that everyone in the Rogers family was attached to Harley in some way or another?
"Steve…" Tony's voice cracked when his eyes fell on his husband, his lips trembling when his husband lowered himself and helped Tony stand up on his shaky legs. The sight of Natasha and Clint restraining Carter made the last of his tension leave him, and he couldn't help but let Steve take his weight as he clutched the Alpha tightly. "Is Harley and Peter, OK?" Tony asked, wanting to know what happened to his kids, hoping that the two of them were in Sarah's house and haven't hurt themselves.
After changing and tucking Peter in bed, Steve went downstairs to see the Alpha sitting on one of the sofas lying his head on the backrest as he tried to blink his eyes open, too tired to keep them open much longer, which made the Omega look at the direction of the guest room… maybe…
As much as Starkad wanted to tell his babe to stay with Braes, his son followed him, sending him angry looks that shut Starkad, for deep down, Starkad knew that this was partly if not all his fault, and if the foolish Omega never wakes up after today, not only his son will blame him for the rest of his life, but he will have an orphaned child who will resent him and seek revenge for being the cause of his mother's death, and let's not forget the headache of the Omega's followers that will plan his death like it was nothing.
"P-pup?" Peggy's voice cracked as she said this word, making Steve swallow at the fresh wave of tears that fell from Peggy's eyes.
So what do you think?
"You butt out of it Barnes or else!" The Omega hissed at his friend making the Alpha nodded his head mutely and send Tony an apologetic look, knowing that if he talked to the Omega without permission he will get his balls ripped off by the said Omega, and that was not something he wanted to happen to him.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, a little bit of sadness, fluff, and cuteness, time-skips, family bonding together, a little bit of violence, unexpected events, and the baby is here! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
Tony's eyes darkened almost instantly at the invitation. Tony reached up to run his hand under Steve's neck, causing Steve's breathes to hitch when Tony's fingers touched his scent glands. They both stood completely naked, cocks standing at attention in anticipation for what was to come. Tony pulled Steve towards him and fell back onto the sofa, sharing a languid kiss. Tony's hands began to roam, circling Steve's hole, and almost as if on cue, Steve felt a rush of slick between his legs.
"And the reason for the distraction was me…" Steve finished making Bruce hum and nod his head at that. "What am I going to do Bruce? He is apparently my fated mate and not only that, his pup thinks that's I'm the father because of what Tony told him… how can I take care of someone hurt when I don't even know how to take care of myself?" Steve gulps the rest of his tea, putting the cup on the desk gently making Bruce paused, thinking.
So what do you think?
"Here…" Maria whispered as she throws a mini drawstring bag to him, making Tony shook a little as he looked at the bag, afraid that there will be a bomb inside. "There is enough money in here for you to disappear, also a new passport and identity…" Maria said as she looked with pursed lips at the grant stairs that dominated the first floor, his mother's words made the young man shake a little as he walked on shaky legs toward the bag all the while keeping his eyes on his mother, afraid that any moment now she will change her mind. "Words of advice, Anthony, never come back again." The woman said before throwing him one last look before she turned around and start walking away, telling Tony silently that this was his queue to run away, which the young man did without slacking back.
Slowly thinking over the pros and cons, Tony shuffled toward the living room, deciding that he would end this fast and quick, just like ripping a Band-Aid, hurt only for a few seconds before going numb… so much for converting to the dark side, he thought he was safe, shame on him. Reaching the living room, Tony gulp as he wondered about the hell he was throwing himself in, he hoped that J was fast enough to deploy a suit if everything went south.
! Then of course we are going home!" Steve chirp happily, humming a scary-ass tone under his breath; his arm snaked around Tony and drag him to the place he wants him in, which turned out to be a lone grave far away from the others. The only thing that marked the grave as something special was the cracked headstone and the crows that were circling it, causing Tony to gulp as they came near the portal to his dismay.
It was a week later, that Barnes got the green light to get Rogers in the Avengers mansion, mainly because there were complaints from a few (all) S.H.I.E.L.D agents as they complained about hearing heavy footsteps and moans of pain in the dark hallways of S.H.I.E.L.D in the middle of the night, and the next day they all will end up finding trails of dried blood that lead to Rogers' cell. Tony being the only sane person on the team, refused for the man to be within three miles of his mansion, but it seems that Barnes was crafty, as he convinced Natasha and Clint to be on his side, Hell! Even Bruce! And he thought that Bruce was his science bro!
Tony took a shuddered breath, pulling Peter tightly into his chest and kissing his head, his hand rubbing the boy's back, trying to calm himself more than calming the purring boy who was unsuspicious and trusting… trusting Tony to take care of him and stay with them, to never break Peter and his father's trust. Tony swallowed at that, kissing Peter's head once more before pulling away, a smile slowly painted itself on Tony's face as the Omega tried to stop it from wobbling and from the Omega breaking down and crying. "Why don't you get ready, Petey-pie, Lila and Copper are coming over today, and they are going to bring their puppy with them." Tony said which made the boy's eyes sparkle at that as he rushed toward his room with a happy giggle that escaped him, causing the Omega to give a pained smile…
Tony swears, and he will swear to his dying day that he blinked for only a second, only one second before he opened his eyes; but when he opened them, Tony wasn't in the room but in the closet, huddling with Steve who was shushing him, fear lacing in his crystal blue eyes… eyes that were familiar that Tony was looking. "Someone… someone broke into the house, you need to stay quiet…" Steve whispered shakily, causing Tony's lips to tremble… what was going on… what the hell is going on?
"What do you think they are after, Fury?" Peggy asked as she frowned at the reports on her desk, reading and rereading them as she tried to gather as much information as she can, pursing her lips when reading the reports for the tenth time didn't give her any new information, which made the woman become irritated more than ever…
"Do you think that Tony's success in killing Steve?" Maria pleaded with an anxious expression, peering at Howard who was as pale as a piece of paper, letting out a groan when the older man flinched when another shout broke from inside the room, she actually can't blame Howard, not after ten hours of labor and another hour of hearing Tony screaming bloody murder after his water broke.
"Do you know what stars are good at, sweetheart?" Steve smiled tiredly before leaning down to kiss Tony's forehead whispering his blessing to his love, ignoring the Mad Titan who let out a raging shout and tried to pull Steve away from Tony… "We shine!" Steve snarled as he pushed Thanos away from Tony and jumping on him ignoring how the Titan rage as Steve concentrated hard, trying to reach his core…
"So you brought slaves?" The one with dark skin 'Jamti' said which made Steven turn his face toward the man and glared at him with the power of a thousand suns, which made the Alpha raise his eyebrow and look at the king, who was glaring at the Omega causing the Omega to direct his glare to the foolish king, no one knows how long the two of them glared at each other hoping that the other will burst into flames, but by the end of their match everyone was shifting uncomfortably away from the two.
"Mama, he is here! The oathbreaker who stole Hvítur Úlfur is here!" James's voice became louder the nearer he came toward them, and Anton wondered if there was a way for him to stop the fight before it started. But knowing the foolish queen, there will not be such a thing; the queen will fight and fight and Anton will be left with the consequences, which meant more work than Anton would have liked.
"From what I gathered from Thor's explanation, I think that gaining a star's bless is harder than it looks, I don't know what you all think, but if we crossed reference Steven behavior around Tony, and Thor's words we heard now, I find that Thor's explanation is countered to the reality we are in." Peggy stated, which caused Tony to pout like five years old at her words, way to go, Aunt Peggy, you just destroyed his dreams.
"Drive!" Snapped Steve as he saw everyone look at him with shock, Steve's scream made everyone squeak and drive through the gates to the mansion. When Steve reached the mansion, he had to stop himself from breaking the door.
"Thanks… you too…" Tony tried to smile, hoping that he wasn't grimacing, which he knows was a failing battle, especially with the fight or flight instincts were warring inside Tony like it was nothing. "Thank you for the roses and chocolate?" Tony tried not to make his words sound like a question and failing dramatically at that; just his luck…
They nearly reached the alter, and Tony's lips twitched up into a smile when he saw Steve grinning madly, his eyes not straying away from Tony as he took him in; Steve was wearing a suit similar to Tony, the only difference there was the tie, which was black. The sight of Steve, made Tony's heart pound a little in his chest and an uncontrollable giggle nearly left his lips.
"What do you call this then? It's ripping people's fingers off! Stop it!" Tony cried out when he saw the dead cat trotting down the road with a human's leg in its mouth, dripping blood everywhere. "Oh my God, oh God, oh God, oh God!" Tony called out in panic as he pulled Rogers from the front of his shirt. "You either stop it or I will rip your balls and shove them down your throat, you get me, Rogers?" Tony screamed as he shook the man back and forth, causing the man to blink his eyes and gaze at Tony with a dazed look. "You are useless!" Tony moans as he let go of Rogers causing him to fall on the ground and he turned around running toward the fence. "Jarvis! Fire the armor now!" Tony called out and a few seconds later the Tony was fully armored and ready to fight the zombie/demon/cat/whatever the hell it was…
Just then, when Steve was going to lean and whisper something in his ear, the sky burst open and Tony raised his eyebrow when he saw the same flying whales that informed him the Chitauri were here. "Well, why don't you look at that,
"Does that mean you finally see him worthy for the throne, or was it something else?" Bruce shifted uncomfortably; he probably hated himself for being the person who spoke and no one else, which caused Steve to grin, sending the doctor a wink.
Reaching the mansion's door, Steve opened it and looked at the acres after acres of land that Tony owned, looking at the sky Steven realize that it was probably three in the morning, but that didn't stop him, instead, he gets out and close the door behind him.
It was a month since that terrifying day; a month, a short time, but at the same was a long time as any, Steve just hope that he won't end up crushed when Tony decided that he was done playing house and that he was content with being back to work, where he will ignore Steve until he remembered that he had a husband waiting for him back home; a husband that was pregnant with his daughter. Steve sighed as he went under the shower, welcoming the warm water that descended on his back, trying to distract himself before hormones decided to act up and Steve would find himself crying in the bathroom.
"Well, that punk called me saying he is going to come home soon…" Before Bucky was able to continue he hears a deafening squeal from Winnie which made him wince and look at the woman like she was crazy, his mother ran outside of the house, shouting something about going to Sarah, Bucky grumbled to himself.
A few seconds later the shuffling stopped before returning, and after a minute or two, the person behind him finally gathered the courage to come and sit beside Steve. Steve didn't need to turn around to see who it is, he already knows the person who showed up, after all, Tony had to have the last word even in a losing argument. "I'm doing what has to be done," Tony said, his words causing Steve to roll his eyes, of course, Tony will start his argument with something like that, if Steve didn't care about this idiot he would have already thrown him from the tower's roof.
An hour later Steve shifted nervously in his seat waiting for his name to be called out, nervousness warred with hope, wondering what gender his baby was going to be. Steve had delayed wanting to know the gender of his baby because he had hoped that Tony will be there with him when the two of them found out; Steve can't put it off anymore, not when he was five months and Tony didn't seem to want to involve himself with Steve and the baby this time, besides Steve has to prepare the baby's room, and he was tired of waiting for his absent mate to notice them any longer.
"It was some kids who thought it will be funny to cause the town to go into an uproar; they killed a few animals and skinned them, throwing their carcasses all around the place, wrote on the walls using animal's blood, we were able to catch them and take them into custody they are spending their time with Fury for the next few months." Bucky explained, his words making Tony feel faint because this wasn't right, wasn't it? It was Ty, right? He wasn't lying, Ty was real and he attacked him!
"Does that mean I'm three-quarters American one-quarter Italian? Gwen and Harry will be so jealous!" Peter said which made Steve give a small laugh at that as he shook his head a little.
"Doesn't mean that you can run around, what if you get hurt?" Tony asked as walk to the buffet with the pup by his side, Tony hummed at that and pour the small pup a little bit of orange juice which the pup took with a chirped 'Thank you' and start drinking his juice.
"It is OK, baby, Daddy was just lost in his thoughts for a sec," Tony mumbled before kissing his daughter's forehead, his tense body relax as he smelled his baby's scent… a scent that was a mix of him, baby powder, and the crispy lake outside. "You are stupid, Rogers, stupid for sticking here and refusing to leave," Tony called out loudly, hoping if Rogers was still here so he would hear what Tony said, maybe then he would decide to cross to the afterlife and stop living in this town that yearns for him but still refuse him.
Now Tony knew Steven married him in his universe, a lot of Steven's actions around him made sense. That more than ever was the reason that Tony didn't confess his love for Steven for the next two years, even when everyone, even Rogers, thinks that Steven and him were together and that Steven's was Peter's father, the only ones who knew the truth were Peggy, Steven, and the Jarvis family, but they weren't going to tell anyone the truth without Tony's consent.
"I can get on fine on my own…" Tony repeated tiredly; trying to stop the tears from sliding down his face, damn that Alpha, why can't he just leave it alone like his mother?
Eleven months after Steve become the CEO, he and Miss Potts stayed in the office that night, they were talking about the trip to Japan that they hoped Howard will attend… it was then that Steve learned that Miss Potts was one of Tony's friends it was an offhanded command that was said by a tired woman, but it held all the truth he needed.
It was a little awkward the first few minutes, Tony admits that sleeping near Harley was not like sleeping near Peter who was a starfish when he sleeps, hands and legs all over the place causing Steve and him to shift near the edge and sometimes fall from the bed; Harley, on the other hand, he holds himself in a fetal position, trying to make himself as small as he can, which made Tony's heart give a sad pang at that.
Tony frowned at the box, wishing that it will open by itself and declare to him what was hiding inside; after all, it was not fair that his heart was pounding like mad, and his face to burn with embarrassment, not to overlook the hope growing inside of him accompanied by the joy that nearly drove him to squeal like a schoolgirl. It will be an absolutely let down and painful if he was feeling all of that only to discover that either the box was not for him or that it contains something else.
Whatever warning Edith gave them, didn't prepare any of them to the sight they would receive, fear starts taking grip of them and their breathing was trapped in their lungs, too chilled to do anything but gaze at the carnage that was taking place in front of their own eyes, their eyes didn't blink at the red that covered the walls, their ears still continued to reverberate from Steven's brutal laugh and roars after every kill he carried out, and the song he chanted, made their blood freeze in their veins as it echoed in their minds over and over again.
"And why is that?" Steve asked the pup gently as he returned to washing the dishes, trying to calm his beating heart as he put the last dish in the dishes rack, before unplugging then sink, he turned to Peter after that, drying his hands in the small towel near him with a smile on his face hoping to put the pup at ease.
Rogers on the other hand was frowning darkly, sending Tony dark looks before he let out a sigh and before his gaze returned to being annoyed once more. "Bucky is my mate Tony, I'm sorry that you believed there is going to be anything between us other than a mutual benefit deal, my mate is back Tony and he needs me, sorry." Rogers said in a tone that implied Tony should have known this from the start.
It had been days since the queen held himself in his room, later taking his child with him to his people's house, refusing to come in contact with any one of the village and refusing to return to the king's own home when it turned dark; a silent protest and a small victory that the king refused to take away from the queen, not when he knew what his ignorance caused innocent souls from his people. It had been days since Anton dared to disclose the secrets the queen told him, but only daring to do that to his friends, in the hope of them starting to dig something to discover the truth that caused Anton to have sleepless nights for many days now.
Tony frown in bewilderment when his fingers brushed a small box; he took out the box slowly, wondering what it was, only for his heart to stutter when his sight settled on it, a flush taking over his face when he noted that the small box in his hand was a ring box. So many possibilities fleeted inside Tony’s head, but all of them pointed in one direction, one direction that turned Tony’s face into a crimson mess.
"Ah, yes…" Steve murmured, a soft smile on his lips before he kissed Tony's temple, causing the Omega to hum. "Even grown-up, they are still our babies, aren't they?" Steve stated causing Tony to chuckle at that, knowing fully well, that if Peter or even Harley heard about being called babies, they would pout till the end of the time.
The two of them walked out of the workshop, Anton planning on finding a way to end this Gods-forsaken matchmaking, and Magna going with Anton over what he should do and what he shouldn't, stressing the subject of not killing Tyber until proven guilty. Ah, if only Magna wasn't mated to Jamti, at least then Anton would have mated her, but he couldn't do this to his friend, subjecting her to live her life with a husband who was pining for a dead Omega for all he knows.
The adults chatted for a bit while Peter engaged in the game of twenty questions with Jarvis, chatting the AI's circuits off, but the Jarvis didn't seems to mind as he answered Peter's questions and even asked a few of his own. Dinner was a lovely affair; Steve spent it praising Tony for his amazing cooking, which made the Omega flush at that and tried to hide his flustered face with his juice cup.
At the reminder, Steve seemed to pout, and Tony wonders how a scary and huge man could make pouting like a five years old endearing. From the admiring sighs coming from Bucky and Pepper's direction, Tony wasn't the only one who was thinking along that line, which was concerning, to be honest.
"Brookland… Brookland was destroyed a year before the Beta's capture." The king whispered, trying to calm Steven as he ran gentle hands on his clenched fists; his soft words and action didn't stop his words from piercing Steven's heart and causing him pain, at the lie the Beta gave him when he told him about Brookland still standing. "That was the reason we rage war on the Hydra kingdom because they destroyed our home. The Beta only brought information, he sower on Odin's rule that he stole them; there was no child with him, nor did I found the letter you said was within the scrolls." The king gazed at the Omega in front of him in concern, probably wondering if he should call the healer when Steven looked like a doll that was ripped from the seams.
"Yes, yours…" Steve said before bringing Tony in one more kiss getting pleasant noises from the Omega, growling when he noticed the scent of heat thick in the air, signaling that Tony heat is approaching sooner than they thought, Steve can't wait for it to arrive, and it was the beginning of a new page…
"Mama… wha Papa smell like?" His baby asked then start coughing making Tony pauses and check his son before answering.
"She… she couldn't make it." Steve ends up saying, making Tony let out a dry sob, which made Steve stand up and run his hand through Tony's white hair. "But Peter would, Cassie called him and he is on his way with his family, you are going to see May and Ben, his children." That made Tony sniff and look at the side pointing toward the table beside the bed.
"Wha…" Tony muttered as he listening to his father telling him about his worst nightmare.
Steve breathed harshly through his nose, his hands were itching as he continued to wheel himself for what looked like an hour or so; so far Steve managed to discover that he was in Brooklyn, not far away from home, which was nothing but an uplifting thought. Looking around the place, Steve tried to find somewhere to call Tony, either by using a payphone or borrowing someone's cellphone, he just wanted to call the Alpha.
"It's OK, Tony; it's OK, am here now…" Steve whispered kissing the top of his head causing Tony to let out a whine, sniffing as he tried to regain himself and stop embarrassing himself more than he is. The gentle hand running down his hair and back calmed Tony down, making him let out a shaky sigh and breathe deeply, taking in Steve's scent; his content scent, without anything illness or pain clouding it.
In some stupid way, his action reminded him of the story of 'Icarus and the Sun' but instead of flying to the sun and burning his wings, Tony flow to the star hoping to catch it, only to be greeted with ice and coldness; Tony knows that the only thing the two stories has in the comment was the falling part, how both of them fell to their deaths, only Tony was smarter than Icarus and was able to survive his fall and maybe, just maybe a little luck rubbed into him when he flows close to the star; he thinks that really happened, because miraculously he didn't die when he went against Stane, and he didn't die from palladium poisoning, so maybe there was a truth to the whole 'Lucky Star' thing.
"Yes, I know that you are thinking about me being an idiot for doing this, but it's the only way to save him… the Winter Soldier." Steven said which made the woman purse her lips looking at Steven with a thoughtful look on her face, and Steven knew that if given time the woman will know why he was doing this.
"Up, you have work in an hour…" Steve's voice made the Omega smile and turn to the Alpha who was drying his hair, his smile caused the Alpha's eyes to soften more than already and the older man came toward him to give him a kiss on the cheek, making Tony flush pleasantly and untangled himself from the sheets kissing Steve one last time before going to the bathroom for a quick shower…
"I promise, Daddy! I will even bring you their corpses as a spoil of war!" Peter cried out happily causing Tony to sniffle and nod his head, lowering himself to the ground to hug his baby tightly, glaring at the other cowering children and parents from over his baby's shoulders, daring them to do anything to his baby and lose their lives.
"He… he wouldn't be angry that I damage the rings… right?" Tony asked hearing his aunt huff and massages her forehead calling Tony an idiot, and Tony really felt like an idiot for damaging the rings, it wasn't like he meant for it to happen! He just saw the rings and something inside of his just… just snapped, his wolf just screamed 'Mine' until he finally took the rings, at first he thought that the rings were enchanted with magic, or it was a rear metal that controls minds or something, he didn't imagine it would be Vibranium from Steven's Shield, it explains why Steven didn't have his Shield when he fell into Tony's lab, he destroyed the Shield to create the rings because Tony knew that Steve's Shield was not pure Vibranium, and that to collect that much Vibranium as he saw in the rings, meant that Steven completely destroyed his Shield and any lingering chance of being Captain America ever again.
"Nebula…" A gruff voice called out, his calls echoing through the vast nothing; the woman in question to stop her advance, staying still in her place as she waited. It was only a few short minutes that the person she seeks appeared, sitting on his floating throne and gazing down at her with cold (Cold as ice) eyes. "What news did you bring?" The question was said in a way that whoever heard it, will think that the one who spooks doesn't care about the answer.
"No, I just woke up from my nap a while ago." Tony gave Peggy a sleepy smile, causing the woman to let out an amused chuckle as she took the pie in one hand and throw her other arm around Tony, causing the teen to snuggle in her embrace,
The rest of the Avengers watched with wide eyes as Steve took Hammer by the back of his neck with his metal arm, pointing the knife at his jugular and pointing his head to the camera that seemed to be shaking along with Hammer. "I… I w-would l-like to… to a-apologize to Mr. Stark." Hammer whimpered pitifully, squeaking when the knife pressed at his neck more harshly as if trying to order him to do a better job. "I lied OK! It was me! I was the one playing with SI's taxes and falsify their reports, please don't kill meeee! I didn't mean it; I only wanted to see Stark's downfall yahhhhhh!" Hammer let out a girlish scream when Steve stabbed the knife on the wooden table near Hammer's hand that was on the said table.
"Nice to meet you, Bucky…" Steve said, feeling lighter than he felt in the last eight hours, the smile refusing to leave his face, as the finished dinner, and to his delight, Bucky even stayed with him when he starts cleaning, helping the blond and exchanging pleasant conversation.
"Age?"
!" A voice from his nightmare purred not that far away, causing Tony to freeze in his place, feeling like a small mouse caught in the talons of a hawk.
In the end, Tony and Steve finally managed to return to the mansion, just as the sunrises and painted the whole mansion eerie red and black; Tony who experienced the madness of last night couldn't help but relax at the creepy sight in front of him. If only Tony can run away somewhere where no one will find him, but the thing was, Tony was not ready to have his tower or his beautiful Malibu house destroyed, even if it was tempting to run away and hide in them for a few days at a time.
Tony's head spin, he felt like he was going to faint any minute now, he knows that he will end up fainting any minute now, it was just a matter of time. Tears were trickling down his face and Tony didn't have it in him to wipe them away; he could only think of Bruce's words, his mate was dying, that was left unsaid. His mate was dying, leaving him and Peter alone; Peter who may die of his sickness a year from now because his body was weak as it is, and two years had passed without the chemo doing a thing to help. If that happened; if Steve and Peter really died, then Tony will be all alone, he will be all alone, he just got his family back not three months ago, and they are going to leave him, they are going to leave him!
"So what now, am I a guest? A friend? A
"Good morning, Tony." Steve whispered which made the Omega opened the door for the two of them, making Steve nod his head in thanks as he entered the room, crooning to Peter who grumbled at the sudden movement and thrust his cold nose in his father's neck for revenge which made the Alpha wince at that.
The man stopped knocking, and Steve had to hold his shiver at the cold look he was at the end of, Steve slowly inched his hand toward the bat behind the door, hoping that it won't come to it. "Are you Steven Rogers?" The older man asked making Steve press his lip into a thin line nodding his head after a while. "I am Anthony's father; I came to take to you about an urgent matter." The older man said making Steve nearly stop in his chest for a second as different scenarios start going off inside of Steve's mind.
Tony not knowing why Clint will say that, rushed toward the pup, which made the pup cry out in fear until he realizes it was Tony who touched his arm gently, that caused the pup to throw himself in Tony's arms as he starts sobbing and gasping for breath, shaking as Tony stood up and coos to the shaky pup rocking him back and forth in hope of calming him down. "It's OK baby, it's OK, just breathe like me… in… out… that's it! Good boy, come on bambino." Tony whispered in Peter's ear, which only made the pup whine and clutch the Omega's shirt tightly in his hands, tears dampening the said shirt, which made Tony's heart squeeze painfully at that.
"She is your daughter Tony, I don't know what is running through your mind right now, but don't you dare think that the girl in your arms isn't yours," Bucky growled, probably getting feed up with what's going on around him, probably feeling threatened with how unbalanced everything was and how Tony was going nuts.
I liked the approach in The Avengers: Earth Mightiest Heroes when she became Miss Marvel, but I also loved the movie and their definition of the Skrulls and Kree, so I decided to mish them up, the storyline with Carol is not like the movie, the difference is that Carol doesn't have amnesia, and that Talos was able to save Dr. Lawson and Carol, and he was able to kill Yon-Rogg and Minn-Erva.
As soon as they reached the pup's bed, Tony tried to raise himself and lie beside his pup, feeling the Alpha's hands trying to get him back to his seat made Tony lose it. "Let me go!" He snapped hissing at the Alpha making the Alpha let go like he was burned. That made Tony turn to his son, using his shaky hands to raise himself and by a miracle he was able to get his body on the bed, gasping for air after that tiring move. Once he was on the bed, he gazed at his sleeping baby, tears start gathering in his eyes making his vision blurry, his baby was so small in this big bed, he was as pale as the sheets and walls around him, that made Tony whine and hold into the child that was lying on the bed. "It's your entire fault…" He whispered to himself but that made the Alpha behind him pause. "I'm so sorry, baby, Mama didn't mean to, I didn't forget you, Mama is so sorry, baby." Tony choked as he held his baby tightly saying sorry over and over again, caressing his baby's cheek and kissing his forehead gently.
Steven let out a sigh and follows the king, nearly raising his eyebrow at the way people flinch as they passed them, looking pale as they caught the sight of their king walking through the roads. Steven sympathizes with them, considering what he heard a week ago, but to be truthful, Steven doesn't care, not when they left him to fight alone and run with their lives or came to see Steven fight like it was entertainment.
"I know babe, and I am sorry, but, I don't have any choice in the matter…" Tony said while looking at Steve with wide pleading eyes, making the man chuckled at that and shake his head at that, which reassured the Alpha that all was forgiving, and that made the Alpha beam.
"Little one, listen to me carefully, I want you to be brave for me, can you wait outside with your bear? Papa is going to make everything OK?" Steve said in a rush as he put the pup outside, which only made the pup whine, but the sound of Goose made the pup look at the cat then at the Alpha with a small nod. "Such a brave hero, Papa is so proud." Steve said as he kissed Peter's forehead making the pup nod his head and go with Goose, who starts pulling at his pajama pants.
Reaching the garden Tony gave a relieved sigh as he stretched a little, only to freeze in place when he saw rows after rows of tiny graves. Tony could do nothing but hold onto his screams when he saw that his precious gardens were destroyed, white roses were painted red with blood, while the other flora type he had were burned to dust, the fruit trees in his backyard were leafless and dark like coal, with crows standing in rows on their branches, cawing as they gazed at Tony with beady eyes like they were getting ready for a meal.
Like every other thing related to emotion these past months, Tony ends up burying the strange way he felt and react to the Alpha in the darkest corner of his mind, never to see the light again, but it still didn't stop Tony from thinking about the sweet pup or his huge/scary/blond father who looked like he was ready to break something, or someone, with his bare hands… he was scary. Though Tony could get out of his way and admit that he didn't really know the Alpha other than the judgment he passed base on his looks… Tony hoped the man was not really scary as he looked.
"As if." Steve snorted and rolled his eyes, an amused look on his face as he gazed at the bright sky before him. "He is going back home, and I'm sure when the Asgardians realize that the fallen star is me, they will pester him about his worthiness and try to dethrone him when they realize I still haven't given him my blessing. This was me saving myself and him the headache that will come." Steve walked toward the edge of the roof, whistling at the people and cars he saw down there, they all look like ants, a familiar sight that brought nostalgia.
But Steven only blinks his eyes and walked to the door, ignoring that he was only wearing his pajama's pants, he needed to get out of here, before he reached his door his eyes feel on Thor, and he could only sigh. "Get ready, we are leaving to Asgard today at nine." Steven could only say that before he left the team ignoring their concern question and calls.
…" Fury stated, pressing his lips tightly, as he let out a sigh, his eyes turning to Tony who was sitting on the chair, looking at him with narrowed eyes. "You must know Mr. Carbonell, Steven Rogers was… he was a good man, a good son, a good student, a good friend, he was a good person, the best out of all of us…" Fury swallowed, and for a second, Tony wondered if it was wrong to choose Fury to tell him about Rogers.
Jarvis updated him twice a day about Tony and the pup, he was extremely happy to hear that Tony was finally eating… or drinking? Whatever you want to call liquid diet, the Omega starts his liquid diet as soon as he woke up, spending the first three days drinking enrich milk, he was happy when Tony was able to handle broth and other food that Bruce approved of.
"Don’t thank me… I did what anyone would have done." Steve said, his face turning pink as he gave Tony a smile. "Goodnight, Tony…" Steve offered a little smile on his face, and warmth shining in his blue eyes; Steve waved goodbye before going inside the room the smile still on his face even when he closed the door.
Today Steve was going to go to a fancy ball in Stark tower; Peggy had told him that she get a hold of information that says the Starks are being targeted. So Steve took it as his mission to protect his friend and his family. Steve was waiting for Howard in the man's office; to go into more depth about the plan… it was then that he saw it…
It was only when the elevator door closed behind them that the two of them moved. Like someone possessed Tony, he pulled Steve and kissed him like his life depended on it, and maybe it did in a way, maybe Steve felt it too because the star held his tightly as he kissed him over and over, dominating him and leaving Tony breathless and under Steve's mercy; who would have thought that such an angelic face would hide behind it such a devilish nature?
"They will find no notes; after all, he is dead for all we know…" Peggy said as she closed the file in front of her pushing it away from her as she hummed to herself lost in thoughts about what she is going to do, her mind going into overdrive at what is going to take place from now own.
"I am s-sorry… so, sorry, please let me explain." Tony plea which only succeeded in making Steve laugh and shakes his head, running his hand through his blond hair and look back at Tony, who took a step forward only to stop by Steve's glare that freezing him in his place.
The joy and happiness he saw in Steve's eyes, was everything to Tony; he held into Steve tightly as he listen to Steve's reassuring words, as he whispered in his ears over and over again that he would protect them and that everything was going to be fine.
?" The woman hissed in a different language, causing the boy to pout and shrug. "
(See the end of the chapter for
Today was a happy day for Tony because after an hour of his mother and Angie leaving, he felt a movement coming from his baby, another half an hour and his baby woke up which made Tony cry and hold his confused baby who starts purring when Tony starts kissing every inch of his skin he could see. Dr. Banner came running after Jarvis informed him that he saw the pup wakes up after a lot of tests (Some of which made Peter cry and hold into his Mama) Tony was told his son was finally OK, that he was recovering, and in a few weeks everything is going to be good, that the could start his round of vaccine too.
But in the end, the two of them made it work, Anthony was a considerate Alpha, he was smart, kind, compassionate, and a loving person, he dreamed of changing the world into a better place, he was an inventor and an amazing one at that, Steve saw some of his work, the little robot in the shape of claw 'Dummy' and the in-process AI he was making and named JARVIS, both were amazing, and Steve made sure to always tell his lover that he will reach his coal, he is always rewarded with a happy smile at the end.
J.A.R.V.I.S.'s voice made Tony blink his eyes and let out something between a whimper and a choke, wondering when did Rhodey arrive here; Tony sure as hell didn't call him. Though on the bright side, Tony rejoices that his best friend was finally home, and maybe will be able to save him from the craziness that seemed to happen around him. J.A.R.V.I.S the saint that he was seemed to have taking Tony's noises that resemble whale's dying as permission to let Rhodey in. And boy, oh boy, does Rhodey look like death warmed him over?
Tony shivered as he walked toward his house after a month; he walked to the house with Ty's words chanting in the back of his head.
Tony and Bruce looked at each other than at the man who Thor told them was a 'Steve' from another dimension, at first when Fury had come to collect them because Commander Carter wanted to see them, they thought the worse, that the person who fell from a portal in Tony's lab was a danger, but once they reached the HQ, Commander Carter took Thor by the hand and asked him if the man lying on the bed was Asgardian because he had the same scent Thor had, it confused everyone until Thor went to check on the sleeping man, he told them he sensed magic surrounding the sleeping man, that he was a 'Traveler' a person who travels through time and space, at first Tony thought that the Thor was crazy, but hearing that man speak with them with such familiarity and acting none challenged about time travel and villains attacking was kinda concerning.
"You!" Tony hissed as he stood up, trying to tower over Steve, but instead of that, he felt like prey in the presence of a predator. "It's all because of you!" Tony snapped huffing and buffing as he tried to calm himself, lest he gains Steve's wrath and condiment himself into turning to a golden fish. "I don't know what you think is an appropriate date, but torturing someone, even if he was a dick who deserves it is a NO!" Tony huffed trying not to sway on his feet as he remembered the gruesome sight of Stane getting it from Rogers, which nearly made him faint again. "I don't know what you think I am, I may be a superhero, but I'm not a fucking Addams! I don't do the shit you do, I don't enjoy dancing in graves and torturing souls, I don't enjoy people suffering and being in pain; I don't care what you think about me, but I'm not an Addams, I'm a normal human being!" Tony growled, his energy leaving him, causing him to fall to the ground letting out a sob; God why does karma hate him so much?
?" Steve asked, standing up as he cracked his knuckles, which made Tony turn away from the screen to his husband. "I can destroy the organization he works for while bringing him in for you to do what you see fit." Steve offered, which ended with Tony's lips twitching madly until they stilled on an insane smile, causing Steve to sigh in happiness at the sight.
"So this is what you have become…" The Omega hummed and Tony had to stop himself from shivering after hearing the Omega's voice after such a long time, he looked at the Omega as he removed himself from the door and start walking toward him until he was standing over him.
"T-they did something wrong, I had to do something…" Petrus whispered and it was only a few seconds later that the small boy's eyes widen when he felt a gentle hand on his cheek, caressing it. Looking up, Petrus took in the soft smile and gentle eyes that gazed at him, making him warm inside and causing his lips to tremble.
Tony walked toward his father and took his hand; another family member he nearly lost because of those idiotic drivers, thankfully his father was able to survive the surgery, now it's on him to do the rest.
Steve reached up to Tony's face, pulling him down to kiss him like he needs it to breathe, and Tony gives him everything he got, his mouth caressing Steve's tongue dedicatedly, his hips thrusting in an angle he figures must be good from the sounds Steve makes. It feels like they're breathing life back into each other. As they part to get air, Tony pushed himself roughly upward enough to be able to let his forehead fall on Steve's.
"Sweetheart, I am home!" Tony called out as soon as he entered the mansion, laughing in delight when the tortured screams of Zemo greeted his ears; ah, it seems that his husband brought him a present too! Tony couldn't help but coo when he saw the baby in his arms waving his hands and gurgled as he saw one of the voodoo dolls that infested the mansion, letting out a happy laugh when the doll waved back.
"I love you." Steve whispered that night when Peter was fast asleep in his self-claimed room, and finally after months, Steve and Tony have the time to themselves without someone interrupting them.
"It's funny, how I went from I love you Tony, which turned into you fail me Tony, which turned into bad things." Steve said which made Tony really lose it and start crying, making Steve try hard to ignore the Alpha. "I should kick you out, I really should, should put a restraining order against you so you will never see Peter again." That made Tony choke on his breath but he nods his head, whatever Steve wants, whatever he wants… Tony tried to convince himself of that. "But I can't, as much as I want; I am not petty, not cruel enough to stop you from seeing your son… besides Bucky vouched for you, said you didn't know, that it was Howard all alone, which knowing him wouldn't have done it if it wasn't true…" Steve breathed through his nose looking at the crying Alpha in front of him.
Part of Tony was wondering; part of him was already making plans that involve him and his daughter running away. Tony was wondering how far he can make it before the town catch and kill him, making Tony disappear; he wondered if the town would be merciful and would let his daughter live, even if they didn't tell her about him, Tony wanted her to live… Tony wanted the child in his arms to live, even if it wasn't his, even if she was someone else's, even if she was the monster's baby, he wanted her to live… Tony hoped that the town would be merciful to let his daughter enjoy her life.
"Rhodey, Pepper, please don't." Tony let out a tired sigh, leaning back on his chair, hoping against hope that his friends will drop it. "You know I can't leave, not when Howard is out there waiting; you may think that you are protecting me but you can't! Yes, people say that this house is haunted, yes, everyone liked to keep the death that happened here as a secret because it's not only brutal but it only fuels the fire of the house being haunted. Please, don't open the door on something you don't understand." Tony pleads, hoping that his friends won't be stupid enough to confront Peggy and Bucky and get killed for their offers in protecting him.
The way to Tony's room was spent with Steve telling Bruce, what the doctors and nurses did to Tony and his pup, which made Bruce growl and mutter something angrily, and if Steve knew something about befriending Bruce in the last three years, it was to never get him angry. The two of them marched until they reached the room, only to see Howard and Peggy outside talking about something. Steve nods toward them and opened the door to the Omega's room and lets Bruce enter making Peggy and Howard frown at that and follow Steve and the Beta inside.
Stane saw this and immediately tried to attack Steve once more, but a well-placed punch from the soldier throw Stane toward the wall behind him, making his back hit the wall hard that the agents wince when they heard the sound of something cracking in the silent room. "You don't know how long I want to do that…" Steve said as he took his seat once more, waving for the agents to drag Stane to the chair once more, the other Alpha was gasping for air and letting out a pained gasped every time he moved his right shoulder.
"Singing…" At Dr. Ross confused look, Tony cleared his throat and started again. "Ever since I was a child, I heard a voice inside of my head… it sounded like a heartbeat. At first, I thought it was my own but then the humming started, it was comforting of a sort when I was captive… before I have my baby, it was all that kept me sane in there. When I met Steve, the singing stopped, though sometimes when he is away at work, I hear a little humming, happy ones, sometimes I will catch some words of whatever song he was singing." Tony bite his lips as he finished that, he really couldn't put in words how the voice inside of his head made him feel, but most of the time, it made him feel safe and sane, because if one thing was known, Tony would have ended up mad from looking at the white walls of the cell, so he used to close his eyes tightly and listen to the humming and try to catch a word or two of what the voice was singing, which always made him relax, he hated how the voice wept at night because at night, it meant Obadiah was going to visit him with his idiotic minions.
"Are you sure, sweetheart
"I did." Tony seemed so happy when he said that, like being able to go through that small promise meant the world to him, it made Steve pause a little and he gave a hum, looking at his feet before letting out a sigh and glance at the Alpha that was chatting with Peter happily while sending Steve glances now and them.
Two years, that's how long since Tony left the town. Two years of pain, hurt, and doubt, warring inside of him, making Tony wonder if what he did was the right thing or if he made the biggest mistake of his life. Two years… after he slept with Steven and disappeared came the morning, knowing that it was a shitty move to do but not knowing what else to do. In the back of his mind, Tony wondered if Steven was ever going to forgive him, part of Tony wished for forgiveness, but another part accepted the heavy price that came with leaving the person who protected him.
