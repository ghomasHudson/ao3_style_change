"Sure thing, boss.", replied the AI and automatically turned on the lights of the workshop, so no injuries from stray projects Tony kept laying around, would occur.
As soon as the meeting officially ended, Tony stormed (without actually storming because he wouldn't give Ross the satisfaction) out of the conference room and further into the heart of the building.
The silence of the hallway was defeating, only his loud footsteps cut through it like a razor through paper and Tony had to restrain himself from lashing out at one of the walls.
Peter obviously wasn't happy with that answer, Tony couldn't blame him but the boy decided to not question the older man any further, seemingly sensing his discomfort.
"Boss, can I recommend that you take a break. Exhausting your body like that is unhealthy and can cause serious damage to—", the calculating voice of FRIDAY was cut off by the tired engineer.
"If it's nothing then you wouldn't mind giving them to me.", she said matter-of-factly with a stern expression.
Tony quickly turned around in his wheeled chair and eyed his lab warily. He stood up, even though shaky on the legs from the long time sitting, and threw away the motor oil before trying to tidy up his workbench to make it look like he wasn't working for three days straight (and still making barely process).
"Watching out for you so you don't accidentally land 6 feet under anytime soon.", stated the ironed hero, "Care to explain what in the world you were fighting?"
Rhodey just watched his face closely, his mind working to give his friend the comfort he needs but he was at the loss of words. The whole Accords situation and the conflict between Tony and the Captain had so many layers, even someone like Rhodey had difficulties understanding all of that. But Tony didn't even wait for James to answer as he continued to rant.
"Great.", he sighed (he seemed to do that a lot these days) and turned towards his workbench again. The holograms were still open and floating around. "When?"
"He is slowly starting to catch on.", T'Challa delivered the news Steve definitely didn't want to hear. Had he been the only one fleeing, it would've been different, but now he had Bucky, Clint, Wanda, Sam, and Scott to worry about. Even Natasha was on the run because she helped him. "But it is not me you should be worried about, Captain."
Now, Tony had experience with over-the-top people who thought they could rule the world. He was CEO of a company once and the board members were anything but pleasant (and maybe they were just bitter about being on the receiving end of Tony's snark and irritation). So when Ross began the meeting, Tony had the hope that it would be over quickly and he could crawl back in his workshop and not resurface for another three days. But like always, the universe seemed out for blood as the Secretary spoke with his unnecessary booming voice, laced with anger.
"Stevie, could you please stop moving around so much?", he asked his best friend who finally haltered in his steps and turned to face the brown-haired ex-assassin.
And Pepper knew that it undoubtingly would be the outcome, so she just rubbed her temples to chase away the incoming headache and then pinched the bridge of her nose. She decided to just drop it for the time being and started to pay attention to the presenter again, nodding along to a few of his ideas and blissfully ignoring whenever her seating neighbor sighed or muttered something under his breath.
"Looks like you didn't think at all.", she told him, "Tony, you should be more careful. What if it weren't just a bruise and a cut. It's near your eyes so what if you damaged them or have gotten a concussion? Nobody would've been close to help."
"Tony.", he spoke softly, careful to not scare the other. But said person didn't respond in the slightest, so he tried again, "Tony, can you hear me?"
"He's kept in check, for now at least, but, Tony, it's never wrong to be too careful.", the Black Panther sounded concerned, something the genius never heard from him before.
The man just sends her a quick smile and a shrug before replying, "Not if you don't want to yell again."
"I see them. They are all dead. And there was nothing I could do but watch.", he sucked in a breath and clasped his hands together tightly to keep them from shaking. He then let out a bitter laugh, "It is all my fault. Always was, always will be. How could I dare to consider that I could finally do things right."
"Yeah, like the potato bazooka gun I had as a kid but instead of potatoes or other food, he used acid. But honestly, the engineering was shit.", Peter concluded.
So yes, even though getting threatened with a prison cell wasn't anything new, especially when it came to Ross and their colorful history, his mood has reached the Earth's core.
Of course, Peter knew that the Avengers broke up, everyone did, as every news station around the globe spoke about it for weeks. But Tony guessed the question was fair, after all, most of the compound was uninhabited, the light out and the rooms collecting dust.
" I know that and I don't doubt his competence to handle this situation, but I don't want Ross causing an international incident because of it. He is that fanatic."
"Brother!", exclaimed Shuri when she saw T'Challa walk in, followed by two Dora Milaje, "How was America, did some white man try to start a war again?"
Bucky sat on the makeshift bed, the white duvet cover a bit wrinkly from his movements. His hair that now reached his shoulder, was pulled back in a bun, a few of the shorter strands falling in his face. The white tank top he was wearing showed the stump where the leftover of his metal arm was. The edges were burned from the blast of the Iron Man suit's repulsor and some of the wirings hang loosely.
What if Tony needed his help and called and Steve wasn't there to answer the phone? He promised to always be there should he be needed. So he carried it around wherever he went, in hopes that Tony did the same.
Peter looked down at the hole in his suit. The edges were black and smoky while the skin took on an angry red color, it blistered and peeled off at some parts. "Oh, it's nothing, really. You didn't have to come all the way here.", Peter dismissed but his voice was shaky and laced with pain.
"Call your aunt. Tell her you're going to be home a bit later than usual, Happy will drive you.", said Tony while stashing away the empty pizza boxes.
The other phone, one with also just a single phone number saved, sat heavy in Steve's jeans pocket. He tried leaving it on the nightstand of his temporary room but found himself unable to do so.
Still, Steve had the urge to let his teammate know that no matter what, he would be there to aid in case Tony could not handle a situation himself. The thought of just leaving Tony's life completely didn't feel right, so he sent a letter accompanied by a simple none-traceable burner phone to make contact.
"Tony, why didn't you answer any of my calls? I tried to reach you for hours now.", Rhodey said as he entered the lab through the glass door.
Rhodey haltered in his steps as he eyed his best friend attempting to clean his hair. He was roughly 5 feet away and could smell the fact that Tony hadn't taken a shower in days. He recognized the heavy eyebags from his messed up (none existing) sleep schedule and the more defined lines in his face. He was looking older, more worn out. It made Rhodey's heartbreak.
"If you are in the wrong, then so am I. You are not the only one who signed the Accords.", Rhodey insisted.
"Secretary Ross seems quite determined to justify any method he has to use in order to arrest Captain Rogers." T'Challa didn't have to say it out loud for Tony to get the message behind his words.
Tony was sure, if FRIDAY were a real person, she would sigh right now and glare at him in disappointment and concern. She would be just like that. But FRIDAY was not a real person, she was an AI. Tony was probably the only living thing in the whole section of the compound. Not that he minded, he was always just surrounded by his inventions, humans tended to be too upsetting for Tony to deal with long-term. Hence why he was alone.
Steve's fingers tightened, just for an instant, and then relaxed.  Without thinking, Tony raised caught Steve's hand in his, raising it up and pressing a light kiss to Steve's ragged knuckles.  “There we go,” he said.  “Trust me.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'll be your pillow until Sam comes to replace me.”
Tony tapped a small hidden seam on the side of the armor, opening up a small slot.  From that, he pulled out a black American Express, flipping it over between his fingers.  “In case I need to buy a wedding ring on the fly, of course,” he said.
Tony watched, stymied, as he started to pick up the empty containers and crumpled napkins.  “What are you-”  Steve took the box out of his hand, and he started to laugh.  “I was eating that!”
She stared back.  “The trash?” She gestured at him, with long, graceful fingers.  “You’re…  From the hotel?”
Also I've been staring at pictures of Radio City Music Hall for a montn and it's still not right and really, I don't care anymore.  So my apologies for factual inaccuracies about RCMH.
The soft crackle of a fire was interrupted by a thump, and Steve rolled over, squinting into the soft glow of the firelight.  Tony was seated in front of the fire, the poker held easily in one hand, and for a moment, Steve just stared at him, captivated by the scene.
Natasha walked around the end of the lockers, clad in workout gear, a gym bag over her shoulder. “Demi,” she said, her voice bored.  “But sex is a good stress reliever.”  She dropped her bag onto the bench.  “Is there a reason why we’re sitting in the locker room, discussing sexual orientations?”
Leaving him to scrub the plates clean, Steve headed to the small shared bathroom at the far end of the hall.  He could hear his neighbors moving behind each door he passed, could hear them talking, their voices rising and falling in familiar waves.  Some were quieter than others, but the walls were so thin in places that he could almost always make out the words, no matter how quiet they tried to be.
Steve looked back out the window of the car.  “We got lucky tonight,” he said.  “Or rather, he got lucky.”  He tried not to think of blood splattered across the sidewalk, but it was hard.  He’d seen it often enough, and he never wanted to see it again.  Steve sucked in a breath, trying to shake the last of the adrenaline that was rattling his nerves.  “This could’ve been much worse.”
Steve arched an eyebrow at him, but did as he was told.  Tony moved in, his expression unreadable, his dark eyes fathomless.  His hand came up, his fingers trailing across Steve's chest, the touch whisper light against the fabric.  Steve's breath hitched in his throat, his heartbeat pounding in his ears.  It took everything he had to hold still, to hold himself in check, to not do something stupid, something embarrassing, something that would give everything away.
It felt like a trap, but Steve wasn’t sure he cared.  “Fine.”  He looked up.  “Did you leave the greenhouse unlocked on purpose?”
“And occasionally, if we are truly lucky, we find someone with whom we can share our journey.  Another person who chooses, of their own free will, to walk alongside us, to merge our path with theirs.  For some of us, our ways will part again,when road leads on to road, when time or distance pull us apart.  For others, that shared road will lead on, and on.
“I must’ve,” Steve agreed.  “Probably going to do it again.” He arched his eyebrows.  “If that’s really a deal breaker for you on this relationship.”
Steve tried to swallow, but his throat was dry.  “About that.  I don’t-”  He shook his head, glancing towards the front of the shop.  The people passing by were shadowy shapes, the edges and details muted by the heavy grime on the glass.  They looked like ghosts, and he put his back to the window.  “It was a gift.  From…  Someone who’s gone.”
“Eat your breakfast,” May said, taking the book away from them and closing it with a snap.  She brushed a kiss across Peter’s head.  “You’ll be fine.”
Aunt May gave him a look.  “It’s under control, and you have school in the morning.  Back to bed with you, Peter.”
“Have you asked?” she asked, skittering along in his wake, her heels clicking rapidly against the gleaming kitchen tile.  “Have you just-”
One shoulder rose in a shrug.  “Chop my hair short, put on the right sort of clothes, and take the truck.  I’d say that it was something I had to do, if I wanted to be a runner, but the truth of the matter is-”  She spread her arms wide.  “This felt just as natural as a dress.”
The inside of the cottage was better than he’d been expecting.  Light filtered in from the open door, and a handful of windows that were dusty, but still intact.  The floor was stone, and needed a sweeping, as did the thick wooden beams at ceiling level.  But Steve could stand up straight inside, without bumping his head, and the hearth looked much better than the chimney did.  There were a handful of shelves along the walls, and a heavy wooden chair in front of the fireplace.   An empty bedframe was tipped up against the wall, gathering dust, and a table and another chair sat beneath the front window.  There was a wooden ladder against the wall, leading up into the dim space beneath the roof.  Dust motes swirled through the air, catching the light, and there was a faintly stale smell to the air.  Like old books or damp soil, the smell hung in the air, barely stirred by the open door.
Tony glanced up from his pocket watch.  “He finished,” he agreed, as Jarvis set a cup of coffee by his elbow.  “I don’t need the sandwich.”
Steve went still.  “Ma’am?” His eyes darted towards Tony, but he’d already wandered away, pushing a wooden box up against the stone wall of the building across the way.  Steve looked back at the old lady.  “What are you-”
The camera shutter clicked, and Steve snapped.  “Merry Christmas,” he said, half throwing the pot into her hands.
“They were definitely headed to part of the world, and there's no indication that they've returned to the US, and we know they're not in Latveria.”  She leaned in.  “So where are they?”
“I see it.”  Carol shot past him, a flare of light and color, and Tony fell into place behind her, watching for anyone who might be trying to catch them from behind.  “When we come in from the top, they're going to scatter like ants.”
Steve looked over, his shoulders tensing.  “You should still be in bed,” he said, and Tony gave him a look.
“That...  Sounds worse than what happened,” Tony said.  He peered up at Steve.  “I'm sensing history.”
She rang him up, her long fingers working the touchscreen with practiced efficiency.  There was a small flaw to the brilliant purple polish on her pinkie finger, and DJ wondered how the chip had gotten there.  Considering the possibilities was actually pretty calming.
Jarvis took the jacket away from him, smoothing it out.  “Because the dining room is very large, and very formal,” he said, his voice gentle.  “And it is his first meal with us, with our plates and our silverware and our manners.”  He held the jacket out to Tony.  “A frightening thing to a full grown adult.  For a child, perhaps a bit too much.”
“We've got two days left,” he said.  “And as much as I'd like to come back to the city...” He let his voice trail away, and Tony picked up where he left off.
“Yeah, 'course not,” Bucky said.  He leaned his chin on one fisted hand.  “You're just upset that someone's getting something from Steve that you're not.”  He blew a strand of hair out of his face and smirked at Tony.  “Huh.  Not sure what you'd call that.”
"The shield took most of the blow," Jan said, and Tony realized she was still holding onto his other arm.  "But the weight-"
Tony stared down at his plans, his forehead wrinkling as he tried to murder the idiot who'd made them with his mind..  "Good.  Destruction is fun," he said.  He dropped the plans to the workbench, huffing out a breath.  "Let's find you something else that I won't miss because-"
“It could work.  I’m the closest thing he has to a family, and as long as his business dealings are handled, no one’s likely to go looking for him.”  He looked at Clint.  “Wire Washington.  Nat, send word to Jan.  She can get through to Thor faster than we can.”
DJ flopped onto his back, holding the kite up over his head.  He squinted at the sky through the bright paper of the kite, his fingers sliding along the seams.  "Why not?" he asked at last, his head tipping in Stark's direction.
“A fine attempt,” Mrs. Parker told him, making a shooing motion at the boys.  “Let’s go, my fine lads, tomorrow’ll be here before you know it.”
"Yes.  I-"  He fumbled for the file folder, managing to get a solid grip on it at last.  He held it out to Stark.  "Yes.  The commissioner-"  He stopped, and tried again.  “The commissioner reviewed everything personally.”
“Maybe not,” Sam said.  He straightened up.  “But it’ll result in me getting significantly fewer texts from Tony, trying to sell me on you.”
“Yeah, Clark was at, uh, I think it was Empire University to cover one of Reed Richards' lectures.  He stepped out for some reason-”
Grinning, DJ braced his feet on Jarvis', and Jarvis started to shuffle, from side to side, then front to back, ignoring the way DJ's feet scuffed the immaculate polish of his black shoes.  "And...  One, two, three, one, two three, one, two, three!"
“And which of us is the dancer?” She squeezed his hand, her grip strong and comforting.  “Steady, steady there, you’re trying too hard.”
“And crushed pork rinds sprinkled over the top,” Steve said.  “It’s…  It’s a sight, let me tell you.”
Tony leaned back against the workbench, his hands gripping the edge on either side of his hips.  “Jay, pull anything we had from the interdementional bridge we built the last time our kid ended up in another plane of existence.”
Obediently, DJ stood up, just as Harris came up behind his chair.  “You were supposed to stay with Clint,” he said.  “With the car.”
He skidded into their small sitting room and came to a dead stop.  Aunt May was already there, her own robe tied tight.  But she wasn’t alone.  Jarvis, looking more ruffled than Peter had ever seen him, was standing just inside the door of the sitting room, clad in neatly pressed pajamas and polished loafers.  He gave Peter a quick smile.  “We know,” he said.  “Happy and Clint have taken some of the hired men down to handle it.  They’ll have it out soon.”
“If you could’ve pushed me back instead of pulling me through, you would’ve,” Steve said, cutting him off.  “You’re pushing your limits, and I know it, because I’ve done it.” Strange’s eyes flared, and Steve held up his hands.  “I can't stop you from tossing me back, not now, not tomorrow.”
"So what's your plan, Captain?" Morrison asked, with such disdain that Steve almost burst out laughing. "How're you going to make this a country to be proud of again?"
Natasha, one hip braced on the back of the couch, smiled down at her fingernails. “No,” she said.  “It’s my Christmas gift to myself.”
Steve’s hand came up, and he wasn’t sure what he was reaching for, but before he could get there, DJ shifted between them, one leg kicking out and catching Steve in the side.
Tony smiled down at the flowers.  “You can try,” he said.  He let his eyes closed.  “Pep?  I think I'm getting in over my head.”
Steve waited, but Jarvis didn't offer any further information.  He stifled a sigh.  Jarvis was being recalcitrant, and that was never a good sign.  “Did he have a nightmare?  Or did he just talk Clint into an all night marathon of the Mummy movies again?”
“Eight pm,” Tony said.  The same time he always called.  Regular as clockwork.  The one appointment he never missed.  But he could hear the faint strain in DJ’s voice when he asked, when he looked for confirmation, and so he repeated it.  “Eight pm tomorrow.  Before bed.  But if you need me, when can you call me?”
“He totally has memory erasing technology,” he called, and, without even glancing in his direction, Coulson pointed at Tony.
“He is not asking for anyone,” Jarvis admitted.  “He is not responding to me.  However, he has gone to the lounge, and remains there now.”
“Kid’s a pretty good workshop assistant,” Tony said, “but he’s probably not the source most people would choose for industrial espionage.”  He rubbed a hand over his face.  “I’ve got Pepper pulling together my liquid assets, which are…  Significantly less than what most people would assume.”
Steve skidded to a stop, the lid held up in front of him like a shield.  “Get him OUT of here!” he said, locking eyes with Tony.  “NOW.”
“It's information you can trust,” Tony said.  Someone behind Tony moved, a machine rattling as it was bumped, and Steve flinched, his body going tense.  Tony looked back over his shoulder.  “Okay.  Thanks for your help.  You can all go.”
“I expected nothing else, to be honest,” Bruce said, clambering to his feet.  He tucked his book under his arm.  “We were still waiting on a response from Thor.”
“I have to work with these people,” Harris told him.  He looked like he’d been through a couple of wars.  Tony was pretty sure that suit wasn’t going to be salvageable.
“He suggested it,” Jan said.  She flapped a hand in his direction.  “Shoo, shoo, go move things, I'll just be in your room helping Carol and Jess.”
“Well, there’s the fact that I’m not what he needs,” Jarvis said.  “But more importantly, I am, as one might say, too damn old for fatherhood.”
“What?” Steve followed his gaze.  “Oh.  No, he belongs to one of my neighbors, he's just very good at sneaking in whenever a door is opened.  Sorry, he must've gotten past us when-”
Tony grinned, and set a plate down on the back of the couch.  “I just came down to steal another cream puff,” he said.  He reached out, his thumb rubbing against Steve’s cheek, and Steve’s eyes fluttered shut, his breath catching in his throat.  “Sorry, I managed to get chocolate…” He pulled away, and Steve’s eyes shot open in time to see him straighten up.  “I blame the cream puff, let me get a napkin-”
Logan glanced down.  “Ah.  Right.”  He flexed his fingers, and the claws retracted.  “Sorry 'bout that.”
“But far more protected than the average mutant,” Sue said.  She shook her head.  “You're telling me that in the same situation, you'd choose DJ over a city full of more vulnerable children?”
“Sorry,” he mumbled, and Tony struggled to get himself back under control.  He was not a randy teenager.  He gritted his teeth, trying not to think about Steve's breath, hot against his stomach, the armor's undersuit barely any barrier between Steve's mouth and Tony's skin.  Steve's fingers flexed, his knuckles brushing against Tony's thigh.  “Sorry.”
“Surrendering.” Tony waved a hand at the board.  “Capitulating.  Yielding to my benign rule over your lands as your sovereign and rightful lord, who will guide your life and your people with a firm but gentle hand-”
“At least a decade,” Carol said, her voice cheerful.  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “And think I still have Steve beat.”
“You’re out late,” he said, shifting his bag higher on his shoulder, the comforting weight of the shield bouncing against his side.  “Everything all right?”
Director Fury paused next to the table, looking down the length of his nose at Harris.  “I’m going to be honest with you here, Mr. MacIntyre.  I have limited head space to devote to you.  Until you reach full agent status-”
“Yeah, that’s probably the truth.”  Clint said.  “But he just kind of nodded, and went back upstairs.  Came back fifteen minutes later with Miss Potts and Mr. Stark.  And all three of them stared at us.”  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “So I pick up a biscuit, and I cut it in half, put it on two plates and cover both of ‘em with gravy.  Then I sit down, and start eating.
It took him thirty seconds or less to walk around the front of the truck, and by the time he got there, Tony was already fumbling at the door handle.  “Hey!”  Steve grabbed for him.  “Can you try to be less of a problem, Stark?”
The distance from the door to the table seemed insurmountable.  He started forward anyway.  “Thank you, sir.”
“He’s not wrong,” Natasha said, her lips pursed around her straw.  She and Clint were sharing a Scorpion Bowl filled with milkshake.
Steve took a breath.  “I know.  I just-” His head fell forward, and he took a deep breath.  “I hate it.”
Directly ahead of him, a flicker of light lashed out, like a tongue of flame pushed by the wind.  But this moved, seemingly on its own, to wrap around Steve’s wrist, biting against his skin.  Before he could panic, before he could draw breath to scream, the light burned away, leaving a very human hand in its wake.
Steve pulled back, inch by painful inch, and Tony was standing there, his eyes closed, his lips parted.  Tony took a deep breath.  “Are you drunk?”
The headline was “Superhero Shocker!” and Steve could almost forgive that because the picture was perfect.  Tony, his legs a tumbled mess in front of him, had fallen back into Steve's arms.  His head was back, and he was laughing, his face flushed and his eyes closed.  Steve, behind him, had his arms around Tony's waist, holding him up, his skates braced on the ice.  He was grinning down at Tony with an expression of such obvious adoration that it was embarrassing.
“Great.”  Clint leaned back in his chair, bracing a foot on the edge of Phil’s desk as he dialed.  Phil reached for his coffee and his latest form, making a show of not paying attention.
“It appears to be an explosive device with an unknown payload,” Jarvis said. The HUD blinked, and then a series of schematics started scrolling across his vision.  “I believe it would be inadvisable to allow it to detonate at this point.”
Tony swayed on his feet.  “Okay,” he managed.  “That's possibly the hottest thing I've ever heard.”  He managed to suck in a breath.  “Except, you know.  I don't have a backseat.”
“I mean, if you think no one here is stoned, I got bad news about the ‘pipeweed’ the Hobbit delegation is smoking,” the girl said.  She slapped another strip of tape down.  “There we go.  That’s about as good as I can do without a glue gun or a sewing machine.”
“Yes,” he said.  “Don’t worry, Peter’s right here, he’s going to stay with you, but I need both hands free, okay?”
"No, HE is," Tony said.  He pointed a screwdriver at DJ.  "He's Dummy."  Sue looked at him, looked back at DJ.  DJ nodded.  She looked back at Tony.  Tony sighed.  "He's Dummy.  My bot."  He waved a hand at the rest of the workshop.  "You and Butterfingers."  The two bots, busy on the other side of the room, wheeled around at the sound of their names, their cameras coming up.  Tony pointed at DJ.  "And Dummy."
Tony paused, frowning down at the empty spot on the workbench.  He pushed his stool back, one foot braced against the edge of the bench, to check the floor.  Nothing.  He lifted up the edge of the plans, the paper fluttering back to the bench as he released them, and shifted the plates of metal he’d been working on out of the way.  Nothing.
She was dressed in a simple white shirt, the sleeves rolled to her elbows, and a pair of brown trousers held up by a pair of suspenders.  She was wiping her hands on a big red handkerchief, trying her best to scrub the damp soil from her fingers. A flat cap was pulled low on her forehead, with only a few strands of her pale hair slipping free from under the brim.
“I paid for it, I can-” Tony started and Jan put both hands on his chest, pushing him away from the table.  “Hey!”
“Right,” Steve said, throwing an arm around Peter’s shoulders and guiding him back to the door.  “Peter, c’mon, we’ll wait out back.”
DJ considered that, his head tipping to the side.  After a moment of weighty silence, he looked back at Tony.  "Good."
“Because she married my father and he brought her here.  She left the only home she’d ever known, she left her mother and her sisters and all of her friends, left her graceful, dignified old family manor to come here, where she didn’t know anyone but my father and everyone spoke a language that confused and frightened her.” Tony paused, his lips twitching into something like a smile.  “She left her home, left everything she knew, to come to New York.”
"Are we basing this on experience, or are we simply guessing?" Tony asked him.  He cut off a corner of his egg and put it on his saucer, setting it on the bed in front of the cat.  That seemed to appease it, and it settled down in a pile of fur to consume his offering.  "This is going to kill me in my sleep, isn't it?"
Happy exhaled, his whole body seeming to deflate in an instant.  “Where the he-”  He stopped, his jaw working.  “Where have you been?” he managed at last, scowling at Steve.  “I been up and down half this city looking for you!”
“You may find this difficult to believe, but I have quite enjoyed your company.” Jarvis took a deep breath, his shoulders going into a tight line.  “May I sit?”
"Is give it a nice place to sleep and maybe some milk, and DJ's really good at brushing him, and I can take care of-"
“You don’t,” Steve said, amused.  “And second, we might be in Vegas, but we’re not in a Vegas where we can legally sign a marriage license without making a mess of someone else’s life.”
“You do realize this is an open commline, don't you?” Tony said, and Clint decided that maybe living in the hole for the rest of his life was a pretty good idea.
“That's immaterial,” Pepper said to Tony. “I'd never have to fire Steve, so...” She smiled. “He's not the one I'm worried about.”
Steve turned his head, catching Tony’s hand and holding it still to press a kiss against the palm.  Tony’s fingers twitched.  “If that didn’t work, I have another solution,” Tony said, ignoring the rush of heat that curled low in his belly, wiping away fear, stifling uncertainty.
Steve shook his head.  “Can someone please tell us what’s happening?” he asked, and DJ could hear the strain in his voice.
May smiled at her.  “That’s what I thought you said,” her voice bright.  “Chef, the pan is there to your left, if you could-”
“What would I do with that?” he asked.  “I mean.”  He grinned.  “Can you imagine me getting a posy, Steve?”
Franklin watched her go, his hands braced on the ground on either side of his hips.  “She just wants to help,” he said to DJ.
“Poetic, isn’t it?” Moondragon mused.  She peeled a bit of the croissant away, savoring the single bite with a smile.
He paused.  Took a breath.  “They’re wrong.  No one’s in your head.  No one knows what you have to, to handle.  To bear.  No one knows, just how strong you are.”  He crouched down, face to face with DJ, his arms braced on his knees.  “And you are.  You are strong.  How you handle things, how you deal with them, that’s-”
Smiling, Steve looked away.  Desperate for something to focus on that wasn't the domestic squabble, his gaze caught on the plans Stark had spread out over the table.  He stared down at the papers, his smile melting away.  He flicked the top one up, and comparing it to the one below it.  His eyes narrowed.  "Huh."
Clint was still now, and the boy shrugged.  “It’s all the same to you,” he said, his voice quiet, “but having something sweet would be a real treat for them.”  His throat worked as he swallowed.  “If I could.”
“Yeah, hugs are good,” Clint said, opening his arms.  DJ scrambled forward, pushing into the shelter of Clint's body.  Clint, his chest aching, hugged him close, trying not to think about how even the weight of the blankets couldn't hide how small he was.
“You’re not planning on doing anything stupid out there, on your own, without back up, are you?” Rhodey asked.  “Just you and that shiny shield of yours?  Without anyone to help you?”
“He comes and goes as he pleases,” Steve said.  The meal was a simple one, cold roast chicken, thick slices of bread with cheese, and a variety of pickled vegetables.  But he was grateful for every bite.
"You do that.  He's not allowed back through that door until his temperature is back to a strict 98.6 degrees,” Bruce said.  “And now that the excitement is done for the night, everyone back to work.”  He glared at the kitchen at large.  “Now.  We're in the weeds here, people.”
“Right,” Jess said, as Okoye handed over a massive text.  She nodded, very slowly.  “This is going to require a lot of skimming.”
Steve stared at it.  “I don't think Tony would approve of anything with that many flourishes,” he said.
The front of the greenhouse was divided in neat rows by massive metal tables and low, broad beds of plantings.  Pots of flowers and rows of seedlings marched along the length of the aisles, each marked with wooden stakes topped with gleaming silver tags.  Huge clay containers hung from the crossbars over his head, leaves swaying in the heavy, damp air.  He'd expected to hear someone talking, but there was nothing but the soft sounds of the leaves moving.
“Maybe,” Steve allowed.  “But still.  After Wakanda?” He reached down, gathering up the flasks.  “It’s still like coming home.”
“Never tell me the odds,” Clint said.  They stopped at a red light, and he craned his head forward, trying to get a better angle out of the windshield.  “What time is it?  Maybe we’ll see the fountains go off.”
There was something comforting about the flow of the words, and DJ wanted Steve.  He wanted Steve so badly that it hurt, but he gritted his teeth, resisting the need to ask.  Not his Steve.  Not going to be his Steve.  Just like this wasn’t his Dad.
“You think you’re funny, but yes.  For the rest of his life.”  Stark pushed the door open, and paused.  “Do-”  He stopped, and Tony looked at him.  Stark’s eyes narrowed.  “Do we need to talk about Mom?”
“Yes, well, five minutes ago, you were on the floor of my kitchen, so I'm thinking you aren't up for that right now,” Steve pointed out.  Tony pouted at him, and Steve shook his head, trying to hide a smile.  "Do you want to watch something?  A movie?”
Steve glanced at him, and Tony gave him a wry smile.  “Most of my worth is tied up in companies, land and other physical and intellectual property assets.  I can borrow against a lot of that, but it’s not a quick process.”  For a moment he was silent, his head tipped towards the window.  “Luckily, I still have a few favors I can call in, if it comes to that, but everything takes time.”
He could fix any of it.  If he had the time.  He opened a drawer on the workbench and dropped it in, pushing it all the way to the back.
Steve dragged one leg up, bracing his arm on his knee.  "I don't know," he admitted.  DJ's face fell, and Steve smiled, just a little.  "Well, it's your story.  How do you think it ends?"
“Alison Blaire,” she said, and she sounded amused, which was probably a good sign.  “Of NYC Nightline?”
“And I can see why.”  She flicked a thumb across the face of her phone.  “Deleted, Mr. Rogers.  Don’t worry about it, I’m not going to blackmail you into having a little coffee klatch with me.” She glanced up.  “Though, honestly, that, uh, ‘statement’ reflects more on him than it does on you, so-”
“Engineers love redundancies,” Tony said.  There was a pounding in his ears, and he refused to acknowledge it.  “I’m no exception.”
The bed had been half made, and Steve lowered Tony down, getting him into a sitting position on the edge of the mattress so he could steady him with one hand while he pulled the linens out of the way.  “Okay, here we are,” he said, and Tony's eyelashes fluttered.  For an instant, he stared up at Steve with eyes that refused to focus.  Steve smiled at him, affection sweeping over him in a wave.  “Bedtime, Tony.”
“I’d take over,” Pepper said, coaxing Steve out of their way, her hands clasped in his, “but I have my own problems.”
Wang shot back out of the door, his feet skidding on the polished marble of the floor.  He slammed the door behind him, throwing his weight against it.  “Wrong fertilizer,” he said, and something hit the door behind him, making the wood shudder.
Nicholas grinned, wide and bright.  “Yes, I was.  We didn’t meet often, you and I, but I remember you.  And I was there the day that Phillips added you to the line of succession.”
Everyone went still.  Tony pointed at Peter, never breaking eye contact with Pepper.  “Parker.  Earmuffs.”
“They did it to see how we'd react,” Fury said, his dark eye flicking in Steve's direction.  “I think it went according to plan.”
Steve made a considering sound under his breath.  "Five years now?" Steve leaned an elbow on the counter.  "Of course, that was before we got into this line, so I'd guess about six now, maybe seven-"
Tony snorted around a mouthful of rice.  “Pepper worries entirely too much,” he said, stealing a shrimp from Steve's carton.  “I did my job and then I got the hell out of there before I hauled off and punched someone.”  He grinned at Steve.  “She should be proud of me.  I didn't even blow anything up.”
Okoye paused, one hand braced on her hip, the other cradling the strap of her handbag.  “What?” she asked, one eyebrow arched.  “At a tattoo shop, in a bad part of the city, before noon, on a weekday?”
"He can't, Ed made him latte art," Mackenzie said.  She shook her head, her arms crossed over her chest.  "You're an asshole, Ed."
"You're also a little impetuous," Jan said.  He glared at her, and she gave him a gamine smile, holding up her hand, her finger and thumb a bare inch apart.  "Tiny bit."
“I don't think we need to worry about him not having gotten enough to eat,” Clint said around a mouthful of potato salad.
Fury stopped, eyebrow arching.  “Huh.  Nothing much good starts with a Cabal, but if you’ve got intel, I’l take it.”
“Sorry, Cap, they're all horrible,” he said, sympathetic.  “Parker, you're like twelve.  You're not allowed to drink, let alone serve anyone else.  And I know a few lawyers, so you can skip that Wikipedia search.  Everyone else, we appreciate your promises of dishonesty when it counts.  Jessica, collect your winnings, and question your life choices.”
Tony looked at Carol.  “It’s Steve’s logo,” she said, her voice flat.  “You got his truck logo on your shoulder.”
"Well, I'd know." Tony rubbed the small of his back, trying to get the kinks out. It was not going to happen. "Anyway-"
She was already nodding.  “No.  No, thank you, Steve, I’ve got this, I’ve-”  She grinned, her whole face lighting up with it.  “I’ve got this handled, Tony, give me your phone.”
“So sorry, I have the right of first refusal on all intellectual property created under my purview or my +roof,” Tony said.  Jarvis heaved an audible sigh, and Tony bit his lip to keep from laughing.  “Also DJ gave them to me, and I like all of them, so I’m keeping them.”  He sipped his coffee.  “We’re redoing the gallery on the third floor, far too many bitter looking ancestors up there, not nearly enough drawings of the internal workings of my pocket watch.  Or cats.”
She took his hand between both of hers, squeezing his fingers.  “We don't know how long he's been gone, but we're fairly certain he hasn't left the grounds.”
“A solid counter offer,” Tony said.  He grinned into his coffee cup.  “I'll make the toast.”  His hair was dripping into his coffee, and he pushed it back with a sigh.  “After I find a towel.”
Before he could get another word in, she was gone, a faint trill of laughter echoing in her wake.  Tony grinned at nothing at all.  “That woman,” he said, shaking his head.
Tony leaned back, meeting his eyes head on.  “Yes.  You did,” he said, his voice firm.  “You told the truth.  You spoke truth to power, and that’s never easy, and they make sure that’s never easy, but you did it, you spoke for people who have no voice, and you managed to not get arrested while doing it, so…”  He smiled, and everything Steve had been looking for was there in his face.  “Home run, Rogers.”
“I'm going to take that as a yes.”  Tony straightened up, groaning as his spine twinged.  He braced his hands on the small of his back, groaning as he stretched out the kink. “Right.  Let's go take something apart.”
“I appreciate the business.”  Shiro shook his head, ladling steaming hot broth into bowls with a quick, practiced hand.  His black hair was swept back under a red and yellow bandana, an apron tied around his narrow waist.  “But even for you, busy night,” he said, reaching past Tony for a steamer basket.  He eyed the dough with a faint frown of disapproval.  “Maybe-”
Sam shook his head.  "Please stop trying to bullshit me, it is just embarrassing."  After he handed Steve's cup back, his head tipping in Luke's direction.  "Everything okay with Jessica?"
Confused, Tony tried to pull away, and Obie’s fingers squeezed, holding him in place.  “Don’t bother,” he said, and it was icy and empty.  “I put enough tranquilizer in your drink to drop an elephant in less than thirty minutes.  I’m almost surprised you’re still awake.”
“Yes,” he said, leaning over the railing.  “Yes, it is, and perhaps we can avoid breaking it again before I even manage to collect my fee?”
“Three shakes of the food can, twice a day,” Jarvis said.  “However, Jane encouraged him to speak kindly to them, as they are all rather anxious when she’s not around.”
“This is honestly the most fun I’ve had in weeks,” Harris said.  He reached for a cup of soup and popped the lid off.  Cheddar broccoli.  Pleased, he reached for a spoon.  “You have friends?  School?” he asked DJ.
He paused.  “I’d been Phillips’ primary adviser for twenty years.  I was already an old man.  I had no family.  No heirs.  I am on the throne as a stopgap measure, Captain.  Because the country needed a king, and putting me there was a stalling tactic.  For the five or ten years that I lived to rule, the noble houses could work behind the scenes.  Make arrangements.  Prepare for the day I died.”
She huffed out a breath.  “Right.  You're...  You.” She leaned back in her chair, an index finger pressed to her pursed lips.  “What are we talking about here?” she asked, her eyes narrowing.  “Are we talking 'have limited experience with formal dance' or are we talking 'I'm not sure which foot is my left one?'”
Steve couldn't hold back a smile.  “You sure are,” he said, as Val came bouncing up to them.  “Thanks for coming.”
He straightened up.  “As ready as I’m going to be,” he said, and offered Tony his hand.  Tony took it, and together, they headed for the chapel doors.
Tony looked up at her.  “I’d hug you, but you probably have at least six knives on you right now, and I’m not taking that fucking chance.”
Steve watched the second hand tick its way around the clock face, smooth and even.  “No,” he said, without even looking up.  Bucky muttered something under his breath, and Steve struggled to keep a straight face.  He snapped the watch shut and slipped it back into his pocket, letting his hand rest there on top of it for a moment.  “The two of you are going to be friends if it kills you both.”
It took a lifetime, an eternity, but finally, Iron Man caught up to the boy, the movements of the armor graceful and easy.  For an instant, the two of them just fell together, their heads bent forward until they were nearly touching, their arms spread wide like a pair of skydivers cutting through the air.  Then, Iron Man twisted to the side, one arm coming out and wrapping around DJ’s chest.  The repulsors fired, a flicker of light that left sparks in their wake.
“I don’t think this group knows a setting lower than an eight,” Sam said.  Tony reached around Steve, his hand up, and Sam gave him a high five.
Behind the counter, a man in a plain white shirt and an unbuttoned black vest was bent over a complicated mechanism.  His pale blonde hair flopped over his forehead, his eyes almost hidden beneath it when he spared Steve a single glance.  Then, without so much as a word, he went back to his work.
“I know that.  And so does he, or he would not have risked everything.” Jarvis reached out, smoothing Tony’s hair back into place.  Tony did his best not to lean into the contact.  “This is a rat’s nest, do I have to go back to combing it for you every morning?”
“Damn straight,” Tony said.  “So, you're not planning on helping me at all, are you?  You're just here to mooch on my pastry.”
“If you're dancing with a lady, generally you'd lead,” Jan said, tangoing past.  Clint spun her in a circle and dipped her.  She looked up at Steve from her upside down position.  “If you're dancing with another gentleman, then generally the one who asked for the dance leads.”  She grinned, her hair brushing the ground.  “Like rolling for initiative.”
"Not my fault that a lot of things in this world apparently have to be very, very hard," Tony said.  "Like this entire trip.  And goddamn Victor Von Dumbass and his goddamn-"
“I don’t believe it, I know it,” Tony said, his head cocking to the side.  “Everyone knows that, Steve.  You’re the only one who doesn’t.”
"There." Stark stepped back, his dark eyes catching Steve's as he did.  He smiled, and Steve shivered, not sure why his skin had broken out in goosebumps.  "Straighten your cuffs, and you'll be ready for the ball."
The hand appeared as if from no where, directly in front of him, palm up, fingers curved in the slightest of invitation.  Tony blinked down at it, and then looked up, to find Rogers standing there, hand extended, an eyebrow arched.  “Then shall we?”
Steve wasn’t sure which of them was more shocked by his words.  Tony’s face went blank, confusion sweeping everything else away.  Steve’s fingers relaxed, and Tony yanked his arm away.  Steve stood there, his hand still hanging in midair.  Slowly, he let it fall back to his side.  “What are you afraid of?”
Steve exhaled, his eyes falling shut.  “Okay,” he said.  “Okay.”  He leaned forward, pressing his forehead to DJ’s the same way he had, ever since DJ was small, ever since Steve had met him, as a bot with just a camera, just a claw, the gesture familiar and comforting and right.  “Are you-”
“We don’t have anything,” Tony said, because there was zero chance that this was going to go his way. “I have a meeting.”
"Hallelujah, skin," Tony said, as deadpan as he could manage, and Steve started to laugh.  While he was distracted, Tony caught his wrist, steadying it as he slipped the ring onto Steve's finger.  It settled into place as if it had been crafted to fit there, pale and warm against his skin.
“Whatever I please,” Shuri said.   Her head came up, her lips twitching in a gamine smile as she looked from Okoye to Steve and back.  “So.  Shall we race?”
Steve pivoted on his heel and started jogging again.  Sam caught up to him in a matter of seconds, falling back into step next to him.  He stared up at Steve, his eyebrows arched.  “No,” Steve said, because it was clear that Sam wasn’t going to let this go.
“Good.” Tony reached out, his fingers just brushing over DJ’s hair.  “Thank you for checking on me.  And-”  He tried to smile.  “I’m sorry I scared you.”
Jarvis was moving to intercept Obie before he was fully through the sickroom door.  “Mr. Stane, please.  As I explained, sir needs a moment-”
“Tony, you might’ve deleted the emails, but I didn’t.”  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “It was nine.  You’d made up your mind.  You just didn’t want to admit it.  Which, whatever.  None of my business.   Until.  You know.”  Her head tipped to the side.  “It impacts my business.”
Tony bit back a curse, shoving the box under the remains of the workbench.  “Coming!” he called, scrambling back to his feet.  The door to the workshop opened, the hinges protesting the small movement.  “I’m-”
“Indeed it is, sir, and one might do well to wonder if perhaps there were a way to avoid it,” Jarvis mused.  He buttoned Tony's vest, his fingers quick and steady.  “Perhaps you have some ideas on that front?”
Then he launched himself upwards, the red metal boots roaring with a sudden, explosive burst of power, and he was airborne.
He gave his head a shake, and the world slid away from him for a moment, his vision whiting out.  He took a breath, and another, fumbling for his coffee cup.  From a distance, he heard it clatter against the desktop, liquid splashing over his fingers.
“See, I think what you’re missing,” Steve said, setting the basket down and reaching for the buttons on his jacket, “is that we’re all alone in this big, empty house, and I’m not interested in following your orders.”  His teeth flashed in a dangerous grin, and the shudder that ran through Tony had nothing to do with the cold.  “I think I’d like to see how good you are at obeying.”
Jesse took the picture from her and dug into one of her pockets, coming up with a blue marker.  She snagged the cap in her teeth and yanked it off, leaning over the picture.  For a second, she scribbled at it, then held it back up.   She'd drawn a blue mask and cowl on the blonde man.  “How about now?”
“On several levels,” Pepper said.  Tony gave her a look, and she reached for her bag.  “Now.  If you’ll excuse me.  I need to go downstairs.”
Tony popped a noodle in his mouth, closing his eyes as he chewed.  He swallowed.  “Yeah, is he still around?  I’m willing to try it.”
But it wasn't like Tony's sleek and modern midtown penthouse, or his warm and cozy Queens house.  It wasn't much, and caught himself wondering what Tony would think of his worn, paint stained wood floors and his framed mass market posters.
“Yes.  We do.”  Tony drained the rest of the water, and Jarvis took the empty cup from him.  Tony glanced down at the bandages, plucking at the edge of the gauze.  “How bad?”
“Well, it's their fault for being openly female in the current political and social climate,” Tony said.  Steve ducked his head to hide his smile, and Tony bumped his shoulder against Steve's.  “After all, they're the one who forced their identity on the rest of us.”
Tony bit his lip to keep from laughing.  “Excellent.  Glad we could get to the root of your many failings.”  He braced an arm on the doorframe.  “What were-”
“There’s a champagne bottle through the tv set,” Rhodey told him.  “You can see that, right?  The-” He gestured at the television.  “The hole.”
“Yeah, but let’s be honest.” Her hands, clad in a pair of battered leather work gloves, went to fists, and she flexed, her arms over her head in the classic bodybuilder pose.  “Be a shame to cover up these guns.”
"I don't know."  Steve gave him a tense shrug, his shoulders jerking upwards.  "Volunteering.  Stuffing envelopes for a charity.  Washing their dog."  His eyes slid in Tony's direction.  "They need a hobby."
“Because something else was up?” Pepper asked.  Peter uncovered DJ’s ears and covered his own.  Pepper gave him a sideways look. “Sorry, Peter.”
Greer gave her a look out of the corner of her eyes.  “Because I want to get laid,” she said, her teeth flashing.
“I could,” Steve said.  “But if Miss Potts is handling your employees, and I’m handling the boys from Hammer’s House, then who’s going to be taking care of DJ?”
Steve grabbed a stool, dragging it over to the counter and boosting himself onto it.  “You always give me the hard jobs,” he said.
“No, Parker’s supposed to come back for them,” Tony said, peeling a thin thread of cheese from the edge of his sandwich.  “He was supposed to come back for them this morning, but did he remember?”
“How much did you sleep last night?” Pepper said, cutting him off with ruthless efficiency.  Tony fell silent, and she waited, the empty air stretching out between them.  “We'll be there in ten minutes.”
Every single woman raised her hand.  Jan raised both, waving them wildly over her head.  Clint just laughed, and Luke shook his head.  “All the damn time.”
She was moving already, her sneakers flying over the polished tile of the kitchen floor.  "Yes, Chef."
"About Franklin, yeah."  Clint shifted on the couch, kicking his legs out in front of him.  "It's going to be okay.  You know that, right?  His family isn't going to let anything happen to him."
“Well, Happy and Thor are ‘patrolling’ with him,” she said with a slight smile.  “I trust they’ll have him poking his nose into all sorts of utterly useless nooks and crannies.”
“How many times has he grounded you forever?”  Rhodey asked DJ, who paused, his face scrunching up as he considered that question.  Rhodey grinned into his coffee cup, and Tony considered throwing something at him.  “Calculating.  Calculating.”
From the depths of his armchair, DJ peeked out from within his blanket cocoon, his dark eyes sleepy.  "Yes," he said, the word dissolving into a yawn.  He wiggled a bit, finding a comfortable spot in the creaky old chair.
“Maybe not the fastest,” Tony mused.  “But the easiest.”  His arm flexed, and his fist bounced against the window, once, twice.  “Though I think this proves that staying in the house doesn’t make me any safer.”
“And if I did choose to put him to bed, moving quickly was of the utmost importance,” Jarvis said, his voice echoing out of the closet.  He re-emerged, a quilt draped over his arm.  “As he had an unfortunate habit of kicking like a mule in his sleep.”  He paused, his eyes meeting Steve’s.  “Something to keep in mind.”
He could move fast now, faster than he should be able to move, than anyone should be able to move.  Long legs, strong lungs, and he knew where he had to go.  Knew the quickest way there.  He didn’t much care who or what got in his way.
Steve’s fingers relaxed on Tony’s wrists, his cheeks flushing.  “I guess it does.”  His eyes wer bright, but despite the way that Tony shifted in his lap, he didn’t make a move.
DJ folded his arms on the edge of Tony's desk.  "Yes," he said, with a big grin.  He reached out, his fingers trailing gently across the thing's back.  It leaned against his palm, a rumbling sound somewhere between a purr and a growl emanating from it.
"You told me it wasn't a good idea."  It wasn't.  It absolutely wasn't.  He had to keep reminding himself of that.  "A couple of times."
“What can I do for you, Jay?” Tony asked, pushing his chair away from his desk.  He spared a glance for his suit jacket, but bypassed it without a twinge of guilt.
DJ listened to them argue, because that was familiar and comforting and okay.  This was an okay fight.  This was a fight they could have.  He stripped off the gauntlet and turned it over in his hands.  The repulsor in the palm was dark and cloudy, but he could fix that.
“I'm going,” Steve said, trying not to laugh.  He smiled at Jess and Carol, who were both in workout gear, with matching gym bags.  “Did you get dragged into this?”
Steve took his hand, and let Sam haul him to his feet.  “'Woo the fuck out of that man?'” he asked, his lips twitching.
“I’m so pleased I can entertain,” Tony said, his voice withering.  To Pepper, he said, “You never specifically asked me not to-”
The customs officer closed the dictionary and handed it back.  The student retreated back to his place in line, and the officer reached for his stamp.  "Case will be reviewed in the morning, if you are still here.  Until then-"  The stamp came down with a very final sounding thump on first Tony's paperwork, then Steve's.  The officer pushed them back across the counter with a wide grin.  "Welcome to Symkaria.  Enjoy your stay."  He leaned to the side.  "NEXT."
She grinned.  “Both of us will.”  She took a step back, but didn’t pull her hand free of his.  “Thank you, Tony.”
Harris was startled out of his reverie, just in time to keep from walking into DJ’s back.  He followed DJ’s pointing finger, looking down the row ahead of them.  There, tucked between a booth selling piles of plush and one piled high with bootleg DVDs, a man was sitting at a small table.  Behind him, a crooked banner stood, reading “The Las Vegas Museum of Mysticism,” and the table was covered in disordered pamphlets.  The man barely seemed to be aware of the people passing by, staring down at his phone with a bored expression on his face.
On the stage, they'd finished up closing statements, or arguments, or whatever the fuck it is what they were doing, Tony hadn't really been paying attention, Tony didn't care, he was just watching Steve's mouth, his throat, his hands, his body, and slowly losing his mind.
Happy peered up at men as he wandered, wobbling back and forth like a billiard ball, through the crowd.  Men got out of his way, glancing at each other with various degrees of amusement and annoyance.
“Yes, well, story of my life this week,” Tony said.  He stood up.  “Anyone else got something to say?”  The team looked at him with varying degrees of amusement and pity.  He chose to ignore the latter for now.  He could have them all murdered later. “Good.  Get out.”
Steve exhaled.  “It wasn’t my best,” he agreed, his arms relaxing by stages, giving Tony enough room to breathe without relinquishing his hold entirely.  “We did a little drinking, did we?”
Eli eyed Tony, a faint smile on his face.  “Yeah, think you're going to have your hands full with that one.”  He grabbed the kettle and crossed to the sink, filling it with the ease of someone who knew the layout.
“Well, at least you're honest about it,” Tony said.  He shifted the flowers in his lap, the leaves rustling as he found a way to balance them without having them half in his face.  His fingers smoothed over one of the velvety petals, a faint smile creasing his face as he considered the place where the red bled into the yellow.  His colors.  Steve had found roses in his colors.  He looked up to find Pepper smiling at him, her eyes bright.  “Is that a smirk?” he asked, his voice dire.
Steve smiled, a little of the fear melting away.  “I'll keep that in mind,” he said as the quartet started to play.  The song was soft and slow, a modern tune he felt like he should've recognized.  It had a melancholy feel to it, but somehow, it felt almost natural to be dancing to it.
"Perish the thought, Officer Rogers.  I am merely wondering how you survived life in this city, let alone a war," Tony managed, his shoulders shaking.  "Since your natural response to seeing a granade bounce across the landscape is apparently to think, 'well, I'll be damned if I let the other fella get to that before I do.'"
Obie gave him a tight lipped smile.  “Things must certainly be...”  He paused, his teeth flashing in a smile.  “Boisterous in your dining room.”
“I don't often get the chance, but when I do, I take it,” Rhodes said, leaning into the engine compartment.  “Every time.”
His face flushed, his hair damp, and his eyes dancing, Steve crossed the lobby at an easy lope.  “Hi,” he said, his arms still full of flowers.  Before Tony could realize what Steve was up to, he'd leaned over, pressing a gentle kiss to the corner of Tony's lips.  It was intimate and casual, all at once, a public display of affection that Tony hadn't been expecting.
He looked at Steve, something haunted in his eyes.  “Manageable.”  He took a deep breath.  “But this.  Doesn’t help.”  He blinked, once, twice, his head twitching to the side, his head falling forward as he rubbed the back of his neck.  “He needs you.”
There was a long moment of silence.  Then, Jess said “Ouch” in a very small voice, and Tony had to bite the inside of his lip to keep from laughing.
Instantly, the darkness swallowed him, and he closed his eyes, sucking in a slow breath through his nose.  The air smelled damp, like wet soil and musty paper.  Bracing his free hand on the wall, he descended the stairs, feeling his way with every step.  The box pulled him off balance, and he ignored it, counting each step.
“We let DJ call, with the Facetime.  It gives him control.  We called, because I thought, maybe, the app was not working,” she said.
“There will likely be weeping.  Loud.  Embarrassing.  You’re better off not knowing any more of the details,” Tony said.  “You’d lose all respect.”
DJ managed a smile.  It felt tight on his face, thin, but he kept it in place.  People reacted better when he smiled. "Tired," he admitted.  He pushed himself upright, ignoring the way his back and shoulders protested the normal, everyday movement.  "And achy."
DJ’s face was blank, his body language closed off, and Tony caught Obie by the elbow.  “Not before dinner, or Mrs. Parker will have my head.” He glanced back, giving DJ a wink.  “You can give it to me and I’ll save it for later.”
Steve batted his hand away, still grinning.  "Good to know."  He glanced over, his pale hair falling over his forehead.  "Go set the table."
“‘Good enough’ is my motto!” the girl said, snapping him a quick salute, which Clint returned with a grin.  She tucked the roll of duct tape onto her bandolier and shifted her medic bag back into place on her back.  With one last wave, she headed off, looking for her next patient.
Billy gave him an exasperated look.  “I’ve been in and out of these homes since I was barely able to talk,” he said, without inflection.  “And the moment I age out, I’ll be tossed to the curb without so much as a tip of your cap.  Don’t expect pity if you’ve got none to give.”
“They just emptied the trash,” she said, and then she smiled.  “But we could use more water?  If you have a chance?”
While the makeshift table was being set up beneath the spreading limbs of the ancient oak, Peter and DJ had darted back and forth, arms full of snowy linen napkins, rattling baskets of silverware and boxes of tin mugs.  They carried small chairs and cushions, old quilts and, finally, a massive silver tub filled to the brim with chipped ice, dragged across the grass between them.
Steve's fingers hovered over the wine list.  "Is that how you see this?" he asked, his voice quiet.  "That you're lying for me?"
There was a rustling sound, and then Peter's head popped up back over the balcony railing.  "Natasha caught him," he said.
Rogers gave him a look.  It was a very disrespectful look.  "Go to bed, Mr. Stark."  He reached down, big hands sliding under DJ's legs and back.  He straightened up, DJ cradled against his chest, and DJ pawed at the air.
“Right,” Tony said.  But DJ was still there, grinning up at him, and Tony shook his head.  “I’ll just have to suffer.”  Which,honestly, was starting to sound prophetic.  He managed a smile.  “How about Miss Potts and I meet everyone in the parlor?”
DJ looked back at Jarvis.  “Hi,” he said, his face relaxing into a broad smile, and Tony choked on a laugh.
Tony slammed the door.  “Are you sick?”  He tossed the plate at the counter, and it hit with a clatter, scattering its contents.  “How long?”
“Would you like to look at it before you pass judgment?” Tony asked him, throwing a hand in the air.
She moved Harris’ plate towards DJ so he could take a fruit tart, tiny and almost glowing under a thin glaze of melted sugar.  It smelled like summer, the strawberries almost painfully red.  He took a small bite, letting the sugar melt across his tongue.  “It’s going to be okay,” she said, her voice soft, and DJ’s eyes stung.  He blinked hard, and let them stay closed, savoring the taste of flaky, buttery pastry and strawberries.
His shoulders twitched into something like a shrug.  "It's not my place to approve or disapprove, ma'am."
“Might as well call me your head of security anyway,” Steve said.  “Since I doubt it would make a damn bit of difference if I was here or not.”  He set the single, folded page in the middle of Tony’s blotter.  “You’ve never listened to single thing I’ve ever said to you.”
“I love you,” Jan sing-songed at him, as her staffers got dragged onto the 'dance floor.'  “And I'm going to make you look good.”
One of the girls, a tall, lanky teenager in a pair of heavy military style boots and a flowing dress, caught his hand.  The other, a shorter girl with long black curls and round pink cheeks, grabbed his other arm.  Together, they pulled him forward.
Tony smiled.  “Stark?”  Stark paused, his head swinging in Tony’s direction.  Tony reached for his phone.  “He’s in the wrong dimension.  He’s scared and he’s uncertain and he knew you weren’t here.”  He took a deep breath, and this one didn’t ache in the same way.  “And he still dropped his armor and fully expected you to catch him.”  He looked at Stark, and smiled.  “I think that you’re doing just fine.”
“Sounds like a woman of sense and wisdom,” Steve said, grabbing the stack of cups and piling them in the crook of his elbow.  With his other hand, he picked up his plate.  “Let’s go before someone switches the film over to Die Hard.”
“I am less than pleased with the situation as well,” Jarvis said, the words sharp.  “If you are unable or unwilling to help, then-”
“It was check,” Tony said.  “Not mate.”  Steve heard him take a deep breath.  “Game’s not over, Steve.”
Jarvis snagged the gun, darting back out of reach, the weapon held in his left hand, the coffee pot in his right.   “Sir, are you all right?”
“Don’t know if you know this,” Steve said, and he sounded amused, “but when you stop talking and start typing, that usually doesn’t bode well, Tony.”
“And there's another fifty little boys where DJ comes from,” Steve said. “Who weren’t lucky enough to get picked.” He paused, letting that sink in. “Most of them probably never saw a movie, either.”
“Leaving one,” Jesse agreed.  “The biggest.  The fanciest.  And, by chance, the closest to the center of town.  The one that informed me their suite was currently booked, and they couldn't promise me it would be available tomorrow, either.”
“You just want a cookie, don’t you?” Steve managed, and Tony burst out laughing.  Steve closed his eyes, and let the sound wash over him, and it was right, it was perfect.  Perfect enough that he could take a step back, breaking the physical contact in slow, incremental movements, and not have it hurt.  He caught Tony’s hand, lacing their fingers together.  “Come on.  You can keep me company while I clean up.”
DJ squeezed his hands.  “Dad.  Where’s-” He pulled back, his eyes darting over the room.  “Steve, where’s dad?”
DJ looked from one to the other.  “What’s a corn dog?” he asked, and everyone looked at him.  He blinked.  “Is it…” He paused.  “Food?”
“Right,” Harris said, and then he waited for Tony to pull the door shut.  He looked at DJ.  “Want to make a run for the bus?”
Luke gave Jan a cutting look, his hands propped on his hips.  "We got work to do here, and you're getting in the way, Flutters."
Tony realized that his hand was resting over the arc reactor, and he pulled it away.  “It’s just another place,” he said, trying for a smile.  He looked up, and the sky was thick and heavy, pressing down on him like a blanket.  “I’m a New York boy, that’s all.  Being able to see this much of the horizon is…  Unnatural.”
“I take pretty pictures,” Jesse said. “And I'm not going out there. Just to make that clear. I am not going on TV.”
“I was saving it for Sam,” Greer said with an apologetic smile.  “But I don’t think he realized.”  She sighed, tucking her legs up on the couch next to her.  “I blame Tony.”
Steve looked up and furrowed his eyebrows in irritation at T'Challa's words. He seemed to catch the soldiers' confusion but didn't care to elaborate, instead he let a smile creep onto his face and said, "There is something I promised to deliver."
"Good.", Tony agreed before turning slightly and laying a hand on his friend's shoulder, "Good talk. Let's not do that again in the foreseeable future."
There were reasons why he avoided talking to Secretary Ross, one of them contained the fact that just sitting in the same room as this man made murder look less illegal. Ross had been bugging them with such meetings since he came back from Siberia. He didn't even have time to let the wounds in his face heal before he had to sit in a conference room and listen to Ross complain about literally anything and everyone. It was getting tiring real fast.
"And with nap, you mean you passed out from exhaustion.", she stated and sometimes Tony hated the fact that Pepper knew him so well. "What am I going to do with you?"
Both super soldiers were still there, entertaining Shuri who explained all her tech to a very interested Bucky. He had always loved technology. Steve still remembers the one time they went to the Stark Expo a day before Bucky was shipped off to the war. How the Sergeant eyed everything with curiosity and amazement, being blown away by the flying car Howard Stark presented.
The holey suit lay somewhere on a workbench in Tony's private workshop, waiting patiently for the two geniuses to come down the flight of stairs to start the repair.
After that, the kitchen was quiet again. Even T'Challa's footsteps were now out of hearing range. Tony buried his face in his hands and shook his head slightly. He wished he just stayed in his lab today, not dealing with Ross and definitely not dealing with the consequences he had to face in case Thaddeus Ross were to find out about Tony's involvement in the breakout.
His expression went dark when he remembered two days ago, he went to the communal area of the compound and called out for Clint, wanting to show off the new explosives he worked on which he planned to integrate into the archers' arrows. It took him a while before he remembered that, for a matter of fact, he was completely alone in the dark room and the distinct chatter of his teammates was missing.
The genius looked at her outstretched hand that waited for him to hand over the glasses. "It's nothing, Pep. Have a little more faith in me."
Slowly he was getting tired of the other man's constant movements and Princess Shuri seemed to share his sentiment as she shot a few glares at the blonde super soldier while continuing to take measurements for his new arm.
"No can do. It's part of my charm.", he smirked and send a wink in his friend's direction who replied with a simple eye roll.
"Tony, what is going on?", he asked, seriously concerned. When the other didn't reply he added, "Talk to me."
The workshop looked exactly the way he left it. Parts laying around, half of the Iron Man armor hanging on strings, the arc reactor cut through horizontally, and the scorch marks of his miscalculated project joining the others on the ceiling.
The tugging of metal claws on the hem of his pants caught the inventor's attention as he turned his focus towards the bot beeping happily by his side. DUM-E was driving around a cup of a questionable substance that Tony assumed was coffee. Some of the drink has been spilled from the stuttering movements the bot made, a trail being left behind on the tiles of his labs' floor.
And while Tony knew that everything just got even more complicated, he couldn't help but find amusement in the way Rogers indirectly flipped off Ross two times over. He was not petty (a lie, he definitely is a major petty asshole) but let's admit it, Ross had it coming.
"I'll keep it in mind.", he assured before adding, "As much as I would like to continue the little talk of ours, I have places to be and CEOs to please into not making me a head shorter."
"I'm surprised Ross hasn't figured it out yet. How does he think two soldiers escape the snowy landscape of Siberia on foot?", Tony snorted and finally took out his phone to text back Pepper. He had been ignoring her text for two days now and felt a bit guilty about it. He guessed he had to make true to booking tickets for a visit to the art gallery for her.
Steve knew the Black Panther was about to change the subject and normally he would've insisted on hearing more about the current situation regarding the Accords but T'Challa made him curious. Who would have something delivered to him, especially through the Wakandan king?
Which was admittedly the worst part about his whole appearance if he was being honest. It was greasy and lay flat on his head. The brown strands slowly turning grey and growing out. He needed a haircut, he thought.
Sadly, his good mood, if you could describe it like that, didn't last long. Ross wanted to see Rogers in a cell, no matter the cost. It was like someone stole a child's lolly and Tony watched as Ross's head changed color.
Tony Stark stared thoughtfully at the small electronic device in his hands. The grease coating his fingers left prints all over the cool metal, not that he cared. The holograms hovering in front of him were his only light source, apart from the small lamp with the partly defective light bulb that he refused to change. The holograms showed the inner workings of the device, nothing too fancy really, but Tony had been awake for exactly 72 hours and 43 minutes, so the lack of concentration shouldn't be as surprising as it is.
"You.", the Colonel said and pointed towards the engineer's chest. "So stop selling yourself short and blaming every little inconvenience in someone's life on yourself."
"Looks like we just have to wait for what my brother has to say.", Shuri shrugged and went back to the holograms and screens, beginning to model what is about to become Bucky's new arm.
"I am so close to finding the problem, I can't stop now. I'll make myself a coffee and then I'm good to go.", his tone would have been described as cheerful if it hadn't been for the cracks in the middle of the sentences.
Tony landed a few feet away from the enhanced teenager and when Peter's feet finally touched the concrete beneath him, Tony put a hand to his shoulder and made him face him. Through the mask, he couldn't tell what kind of expression Peter was wearing but from the way he clutched his right side, Tony could guess that it was laced with pain.
Tony thought for a bit. "Right.", he admitted, he did say that and forgot again. He seemed to forget a lot of things recently.
Happy nodded and decide to not question him further, the pure look of determination and concern told him everything he needed to know. So he pulled the car in line again and raced over the crossing at  green, leaving behind the billionaire with his suitcase.
"Well, looks like I'm taking a break. FRIDAY, please make sure the lab stays secure and that DUM-E does not accidentally cause a fire again."
"If I had done more, maybe you wouldn't need these braces to keep walking. I failed to protect you. God, I even brought a teenager with me to the fight in Germany.", his voice was getting quieter, his gaze more unfocused as he looked past Rhodeys shoulder at the wall, completely unseeing and lost in his thoughts.
“I got him soup,” Steve said, his voice amused.  He arched his eyebrows and took a sip of his coffee.  “Not that he’s eating it.”
“Since when are you a bad influence?” Tony asked, his voice flat, but he handed over the coffee cup.
“But he’s dead,” Tony said.  “And the list of things I’ve done that he wouldn’t have approved of starts about a mile and ten years back.  I’m not living for for what he wanted, Obie.  I can’t.”
Steve couldn't quite hold back an affectionate smile.  "You're going to get us both in trouble," he said, reaching out to ruffle DJ's hair.  DJ smiled up at him, and Steve headed to his own bed on the other side of the room.  "You know that, right?"
Jarvis was very definitely not smirking at him.  “Sir,” he said, his tone holding just the tiniest hint of censure, “I am hurt by that implication.  When have I ever done anything other than my utmost for you?”
“What’s there?” Tony asked, but DJ was already moving, ducking through the dwindling crowd.  Harris, caught off guard, scrambled to follow him, almost bumping facefirst into a girl dressed as the white mage from Final Fantasy.
DJ turned and headed straight towards the library at a pace just under a run.  He made it to the door in record time, fumbling it open and then slamming it closed behind him.  He leaned back against the door, his breathing ragged, braced for whatever the library had in store for him.
His hand fell into his lap. “Know what did?” He took a breath. “When he picked up my coffee cup, and asked me if I was done. And when I said I was, he just...” His fingers worked at the fabric of his pants, his nails scraping hard against the fabric, desperate for something to hold onto. “He drank the last of it before he put it in the dishwasher.”
She hooked a thumb over her shoulder towards the chapel.  “It got its own certificate.  We keep it on display.  No one ever reads it.”
“Danny still dances like a dying fish looking for a puddle,” Jessica said.  Her hands flopped through the air, her legs twitching in a caricature of dancing.  “All limp limbs and gasping for air.”
Trip set it down and reached for the computer keyboard.  “Now, how many people are involved in your friendship vows?”
And so could he, but this was no Coney Island beach, crowded with families with their old sheets spread on the sand and their meager lunches carried in old shoe boxes to protect them from the sun.  Instead, the pool stretched out before him, the water warm and clean, smelling faintly of chlorine. Jazz music echoed in the cavernous space, amplified by the water and the massive arched ceiling, massive windows opened wide to let in the light.
“We were in the kitchen,” Rhodey said, scribbling some notes in the margins of one of the textbooks.  “I don’t think they did this formula right, let me just-”
“She is moving South along the edge of the street,” Jarvis said, and the spot came to life on the HUD, a tiny spark shooting through the chaos.
Tony blinked, his head falling forward. “What?”  Steve was silent, and Tony took a deep breath.  “The serum-”
“Thor,” Thor repeated, slapping Steve on the back again.  This time, Steve braced himself for it, managing to hold his ground.  “Now, Jarvis, where is our host.”
Steve dropped the bar of soap into the soapdish.  “It’s a bath.  How do you ‘enjoy’ a bath?” he asked, splashing water onto his face.  Soap suds dripped from his nose, and he swiped at them with the back of his hand.  “I’m done.”
Bruce shook his head.  “Not much.  Which isn’t unusual for that kind of a head trauma.”  He crossed his arms over his chest, then dropped them back to his sides.  “It might come back.  It might not.”
She shrugged.  “Passable,” she said, and he made a pained noise.  Natasha struggled against a smile.  “You’re very good,” she amended, reaching out to pat him gently on the head.
“I don’t see why not, it’s worked out so well for me in the past,” Steve said, his voice wry.  He pulled back, just a little, and Tony let him go.  Steve met his eyes.  “What are we doing?”
Tony reached out, separating one stem from the bunch.  “For obvious reasons,” Tony said.  He rolled the stem between his fingertips, letting the light of the lobby skylights play over the bloom.  “How many did you buy?”
I apologize, I'm finishing this at a friend's house, off of google docs.  I might have missed more typos that usual, but I had promised to get this up by tonight, and my laptop died and I don't have the cord.  Please bear with me, and if you read this before 11/26, please refrain from letting me know about any minors issues, they'll be fixed when I have access to the proper file.
“My uncle's an electrician,” Miriam said, and Tony started.  For an instant, he'd forgotten there was anyone else in the room with them.  She took the ring of keys from her father, crossing over to unlock a display case.  “All metal is conductive.  I looked into ceramic, but even that, like Mr. Stark says, it's a danger while working.”  She pulled out a black velvet tray.  “So he went with one that he could wear when he was off the job.”
“Every one,” Tony said, pushing his hair away from his face.  “Just you.  And rooms full of boring numbers.  For the rest of your natural life.”
Shuri rocked forward in her seat, her spoon sweeping through the air.  “So.  The first mistake was letting him into the city at all.  I tried to warn them, I want that noted.  That we have strict rules about letting outsiders into Wakanda, and those rules are in place for a reason.”
“Sam’s not allergic,” Natasha said, and Steve was glad she knew that, because he wasn’t sure he did.
That won him a smile.  “I'll keep looking,” she said.  “But I think this is the worst of it.  Almost everything was already in circulation.”
“I promise.  I’ll be right back,” he said.  And he waited until both of them disappeared back through the door, safe inside the house, before he turned on his heel, heading for the walls.
He took a seat in the armchair next to Tony. “This is really bothering you, isn't it?” he asked, his voice quiet.
“It’s becoming a bit of a tired refrain, it’s true.”  Jarvis took a sip of his drink.  “So.  What is the backup plan?”
"And he's got a few of the city leaders in his pocket.  So your duty gets assigned by me, and mine gets assigned by the commissioner, and I bet you know where he gets his assignments."  Captain O'Brian smacked a hand against his desk.  Steve's teeth locked, and O'Brien gave him a sympathetic look.  "Just skip that street on your patrols, if it bothers you so much.  But I'm getting tired of smoothing his feathers."
Steve paused halfway to the kitchen.  “I don't know if it would survive anything that...  Energetic.”
Tony tried to look up, and his head didn’t move.  He tried to say something, and that didn’t work either, his tongue swollen and stubborn in his mouth.
Once he was back in the hallway, Steve collapsed against the wall, his hands braced on his thighs, his head hanging down.  He took a deep breath, and another.  “Jarvis?”  He swallowed.  “Did Tony go back to the office?”
“Yeah, she can’t be trusted!  How did you not know what-  Did you-”  Sam shook his head.  “Did you think the general nature of cats had changed in the past few years?  Did you think that cats are different now?” He looked down at the scrawny little black and white cat.  “What the hell were cats like when you lived here?”
“When I left my old life, Tony, I walked away from something that very few people ever manage to achieve,” Steve said.  “I rejected something that a lot of other people desperately want, and will never manage to get, because the deck is stacked against them, because they don't get lucky, because they don't have the advantages I have.
By the time he got back, the bread had been sliced into a basket, and there were wineglasses on the table next to the plates.  Tony set the bottle of (really very reasonably priced) Chianti next to them and went for a corkscrew.  “How's it going over there?”
Happy nodded.  “Question we should be asking is, where was he last night?” he asked, shoveling a spoonful of jam into his mouth.  “Cause he said he was out, covering for someone else on the beat, but he wasn't.”
“Yeah, because I’m an even bigger idiot than you are,” Tony said, and he was pinned between the counter and the weight of Steves body and everything hurt, his feet and his hands and his head and his back, everything ached.  But Steve was warm and close and when Tony moved, his hands slid up under the back of Tony’s chef’s jacket.  Tony kissed his hair, letting his breath linger there.
“Handsome and financially prudent,” the photographer said, skipping backwards over the sidewalk.  “You really are the most eligible bachelor in New York.”
Carol straightened up.  “Okay.  We can do this.”  She pumped one hand over her head.  “I declare us to be the Council of Lesbians, dedicated to getting you a date.”
Steve stifled a laugh.  “Mermaid.  I'll find an octopus for you next time.”  He peeked over the top of the stairs, but there was no movement from the bed.  “Okay, I'm going to be quiet now.  So I don't wake your dad.”  DJ nodded, his face going serious.
“I sent you another one from Atlantic City, you should get it this week,” Steve said.  “Wanna guess what's on it?”
“I wonder that every single day.”  Pepper's fingernail clicked against the tablet's surface.  “So, may I have your boyfriend's address so that I'm not forced to spend the entire night distracting you from clubbing Bobby Flay over the head with an ice sculpture again?”
He looked back, meeting Tony's gaze squarely.  “He'll find somewhere small.  An alcove, a windowsill.  He likes places where he can tuck himself up.  That's why I checked the closet, I thought he might be in there, before-”
“She's probably glad you're dumb enough to watch her pet,” Tony said, sipping his coffee.  It wasn't quite as strong as he liked it, but it was good enough.  His fingers tapped on the side of the cup.  “Did you mean it?”
Tony shifted closer, rolling over to rest his head in Steve's lap.  “I should be, but I'm not,” he admitted with a yawn.  Steve smoothed his hair back, and Tony batted at his hand with a languid hand.  “Why are you even awake?”
“You were still awake, weren’t you?” Steve asked, already knowing the answer.  He drained the rest of his coffee, more out of a sense of obligation than for any real desire to drink it.  He stood up, heading to the bathroom to toss it it the trash can.
“I’m just saying-” Tony’s lips brushed against his collarbone, and Steve realized his shirt was half open now and he wasn’t sure if Tony had done it or if he had, and he didn’t care either way.  His hands were under Tony’s shirt, and he was desperate in ways he’d never known before.  Tony lifted his head, just far enough to smile at him.  “Not every artist I’ve ever met has been open to the idea, but most have a healthy appreciation for-” His fingers slid down Steve’s breastbone, down, down, and Steve’s stomach muscles tensed under the caress.  “For the human form.”
“I honestly don’t remember, ask Parker, he’s like a Medieval monk back there, keeping a sad and melancholy record of my own personal Black Death,” Tony said.
It worked here, too.  The customs official just waved a hand at them, his attention already focused on the rawboned woman in the mink stole and cutoff jeans that moved up behind them.  Before Tony could get another word out, Steve lifted him off his feet and hustled him towards the exit of the line.  "This is undignified," he said, from between clenched teeth.
“And you need no encouragement, and besides...”  Jan stood, brushing her short skirt into place.  “Us working girls need to stick together.  Don't we, Miss Potts?”
“I’ll give my father one thing.  One thing I didn’t acknowledge when I was a kid, and that’s parents are, well, human beings too.  And sometimes, you can be tired, and frustrated, and angry.  You can be having a spectacularly bad day, and your kid doesn’t know about that, or doesn’t care, because a lot of the time, he barely understands his own emotional state, it’s too much to expect for him to understand yours.
Almost against his will, Steve felt himself smile.  “I suppose there are rules against that sort of thing,” he said, as Jarvis reached for one of Tony’s feet.
He paused, looking back over his shoulder at the kid at the espresso machine.  She smiled, her cheeks almost as red as her head scarf.  “Congratulations,” she said, and he stared at her confused.  She gave him a nervous smile.  “On your marriage?”
“I mean, at least not without having to try to sneak in through a back door, or past an usher,” Steve pointed out.  “Knowing some of them, I’m sure they’ve made a try or two, but might be nice for them to see one without having to worry about being carried out by their ear.”
“You’re being inflexible, and that disappoints me.  The way you’re-” Tony made a gesture at Peter’s face.  “This face displeases me.”
He set his bag down next to the table, settling it against the floor with care, always aware of how little separated him from those around him.  He took a seat at the table, leaning over to take off his shoes.  There were things he should do, and he didn’t care.
Steve made an inarticulate sound, his mouth pressed hard against the skin of Tony's throat.  Tony slid his fingers through Steve's hair, pleasure sizzling over his nerve endings.  Steve was heavy and hard against him, the weight of his body pressing Tony back against the wall, his hands everywhere at once.  Tony grinned at nothing in particular, or everything at once.  He wasn't sure.  Or maybe he didn't care.
Harris sucked in a breath, which helped the light-headedness a lot.  “Right.  But there is a Tony Stark.  That we have to claim.  As ours.”
There was a moment of silence, then Steve reached over, sneaking a water chestnut from under Tony's nose.  Tony looked up, meeting his eyes, and Steve smiled, popping the chestnut into his mouth. “Everything,” he said.
Steve leaned over, pressing an ice cold can against the side of Tony's neck.  Laughing, Tony batted his hand away, managing to snag the can from him.  He popped it open as Steve settled down next to him, setting the bag between them.   “Hi,” Tony said, grinning at him over the rim of the can.  “You smell amazing.”  He wiggled his eyebrows.  “Like garlic and hot grease.”
“Agent Nanny strikes again,” Tony said.  He reached for the cocoa.  “Do we owe her a bonus for what I’m sure was hours of trying to sew t-shirt fabric in a straight line?”
Tony collapsed back onto the bed, mumbling something under his breath, and it sounded almost like “I love you,” and Steve did his best to ignore that.  Certain things, after all, just weren’t good for his mental health.
Shiro held out two baskets without a word.  Tony dropped a pile of noodles into each one, feeling like an old west gunfighter standing in the middle of a deserted street, watching the tumbleweeds roll past.
“I don’t think any of us really know what you’re capable of,” Carol said.  “We think we do.  We’re pretty sure we know what we’re dealing with.  And then-” She waved a hand at him.  “You go right off the rails and we realize, nope.  We have no idea what we’re dealing with.”
“Very good, sir, you still have to decorate,” Jarvis said, and Tony burst into laughter.  “And do wash your hands and face before dinner.”
“So,” Steve said, drawing the word out.  “You’re from the circus.  She’s from the ballet.”  He looked at Bruce.  “Where did Stark find you, in the Ziegfeld Follies?”
He turned back to Tony, his pulse pounding in his ears.  “Are you out.  Of.  Your.  Head?” he asked, biting his words off.  Tony opened his mouth, and Steve didn’t even let him get out a single word.  “What are you doing here?”
“I am never smelling anything again,” Tony told him.  He smiled at Steve.  “You didn't ask my opinion, but-” He patted the couch.  “I like your place.”
“Well, that’s foolish of me.” A painting shifted on the wall, and without a beat of pause, Clea turned, hurling the book directly at it with the force of a major league pitcher.  The book went right through the wall, taking the painting with it.  Clea looked at the resulting hole, her head tipped to the side.  “As was that.”
The smell of powdered ink.  The slight scent of decay, a quick, damp scent that made him think of mold.  The faint hint of smoke that lingered in every room of the old brownstone, sulfur and brimstone and the smell of dry leaves in the depths of fall.
"Not as cool," Sam said.  He took a seat next to Steve, bracing his elbows on his knees.  "So.  Speaking of significant others-”
Tony gave him a look.  “Let me rephrase.  Do you ever feel like I don’t get the proper amount of respect?”
"I think it's less 'he's a threat' and more 'his secret super power is making you feel bad about doing bad things,'" Jesse said.
Happy nodded.  “You think this was an inside job,” he said, and there was a vibration in his voice that Steve couldn’t quite place.
“We’re done enough,” she said with an easy smile.  “I’ll put the files together for your meeting.  I don’t need you here for that, and in fact, it’ll be easier if you’re not.”
“Are you hungry?” Jarvis asked the boy, his voice cutting through Obie's with ruthless intent.  “Because I believe that Mrs. Parker just finished a fresh batch of tarts.”
For a long moment, there was nothing, just the same empty, dimly lit flat that Steve had faced every day of his adult life.  Steve stood there, his heart in his throat, not wanting to hope.
Steve found himself smiling back.  “Then I guess we’re at an impasse, because I know just enough manners to know I’m being rude.”
Tony broke eye contact with Steve to lean an elbow on the railing. “It’s fixed,” he said, amusement audible in his voice.  “Now, be-”  Whatever else he was going to say was lost in the clatter of gears and the rustle of fabric.  Rope rattled through the pulley next to them, and the awning flapped open, kicking up a cloud of dust as it settled into place.
He couldn't breathe, he couldn't breathe, he couldn't breathe.  He could feel the air on his lips, on his tongue, on his throat, but he couldn't breathe, no matter how hard he tried, no matter how his body fought for oxygen.
DJ flipped the book open and turned the pages, trying to find where he’d left off.  Not that it mattered all that much, there was nothing in here that he couldn’t bear to repeat a few times.  Or a few dozen times.  He huffed out a sigh, one finger rubbing Furbro’s head.  He flipped through the pages, his eyes eyes skimming over the text, even as his fingertips struck sparks against the paper.
Tony stared at him.  “Yes, Parker.  Yes, there’s a lock.  I put that lock there.  Because it’s three am, Parker, and you’re barely able to walk, let alone bike back to Queens at three am in mid-February.  If you try to do that, you will die, and then your aunt will light me and my restaurant on fire, probably in that order.”
There was a crash, and a shriek, and then a man came flying through the air, landing in the middle of the bomb with a solid thud.  There was a beat of silence, and Tony pointed at him.  “I'm glad I finished the diffusing process before you chose to do that, Romanov.”
"His...  Dating history?" the photographer said.  He didn't sound certain anymore.  He was trying.  It was a good valiant try.  "With men and women?"
“I mean, I changed my mind, and changed it back again,” Clint said.  “A couple of times.  We’re avoiding casinos, right?”
He pushed himself to his feet.  “Oh, come on, who gets married in Vegas these days?”  He laughed.  “Thanks, Pepper.”
“Because politicians exist,” Tony said.  He reached out, adjusting Steve’s sweatshirt.  Steve let him, standing still as Tony smoothed the worst of the wrinkles out of the fabric.  “We should at least get something better to wear.”
"A thing," Tony confirmed.  "A, like, a thing, Steve?"  Steve was still staring at him, his face oddly pale.  "They think we got married.  What would you call the thing last night?"
“Mmmm.” Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him close.  “I’m as surprised as you are.”
Okoye’s eyes rolled up at the sky, but a faint smile still clung to the edges of her mouth.  “I imagine you will bear up nobly, your Highness.”
Steve choked on a laugh.  “You have to be bad at something, I suppose.”  Tony reached for the hot tap, and Steve kicked water at him, making him laugh.  “Don’t bother.  I’m done.”
It didn’t take long.  By the time they were out of the city proper, Tony had given him the basics, with Happy anything Tony might’ve missed from the front seat.  When they finally fell silent, Steve took a deep breath.  “We’re assuming ransom, then.”
“You can ask,” DJ said, setting the juice box down on the table.  He went to pull back then stopped, one finger coming out to nudge the juice box into perfect alignment with the edge of the table.  Satisfied, he sat back.  “If you want.”  He paused, his head tipped to the side.  “Reality is more…  Flexible than you might think.”
“My favorite news article was the one about the guy who stole the cookie money from those Girl Scouts,” Shawn started, and everyone else came to a stop, looking directly at them.
He sucked in a careful breath.  “Late,” he said.  She nodded, sipping her drink, and DJ rolled his head in her direction.  “I'm...  Not late.”
Steve looked up at him, and some of the pinched, tired look was gone from his face.  “What can go wrong?” he asked, with a ghost of a smile.
She took a sip from her cup, her eyes going to half mast, the steam curling over the rim like smoke from between a dragon’s teeth.  The cup lowered, an inch or two, just far enough for DJ to see her mouth, a hard, uncompromising line.  “Drink your tea, dear.”
Strange pushed himself to his feet, with slow deliberation.  Drawing himself to his full height, he met Steve’s eyes straight on.  “Believe me, Captain,” he said, and there was a chill underlying the words, undercut by a sudden, violent sweep of wind, “While it takes a great deal of energy to move a dead weight such as yourself across dimensional barriers, I have reserves that you cannot imagine.”
“Jay, can you please make it stop?” Tony asked, just as the phone started its incessant, insistant litany again.  Tony glared at it.
Bobbi straightened up.  “Follow the music,” she said, reaching for the lever.  A moment of silence, and then the stone started moving, sliding back into place, sealing him away.
DJ took a deep breath, his chest exposing with the force of it.  Then he said something.  Something…  Wrong.  Something discordant and sharp and brittle, and it wasn’t a word, it was barely a sound, but Harris flinched from it, his heartbeat accelerating sharply.  Next to him, Darcy’s fingers latched onto his arm, her nails digging into his wrist.  He glanced at her, and she was staring at DJ, her face pale.  She didn’t seem to be aware that she was still holding on.
Clint poked his head out of the kitchen, a carton of Chinese food in one hand and a beer bottle in the other.  “Yo,” he said.
DJ bit back a scream, his hands coming up reflexively, ready to ward off the threat.  What he found instead was a Roomba, swinging back and forth in midair.  It beeped at him, rotating in place, and floated forward again, bouncing against the armor’s faceplate.
Agatha’s eyebrows arched.  “Give me one good reason why not,” she said, ice dripping from the words.
He settled the shield against his knees, his hands resting on the rim. “Tell me everything we know so far,” he said.
"Oh, I understand," he said, his bow tie bobbing along with the words. He gave Rogers’ had a single, strong pump. "Duty calls, and all that?"
Steve stared at the blank surface of the door, his chest aching.  “That might be true,” he said at last.  “But the bedroom's where he's naked, Jarvis.”
"Coming from you, that's quite the compliment."  He leaned forward, brushing a gentle kiss against her cheek.  "You throwing us to the wolves, Potts?"
"He needs a peer group," Sue said.  "He needs friends."  Tony made a face, and Sue leaned over, trying to catch his eye.  "Tell me he has friends, Tony."
Steve shrugged.  “I wouldn’t mind going to Japan someday,” he said, his voice airy as he checked the boiling water.  “What’re you making?”
Steve looked at him.  Looked at Clint.  Clint tossed the bowl up and tipped forward, doing a swift, fluid flip, regaining his feet and straightening back up in the blink of an eye.  The bowl fell neatly back into his hand, the eggs barely rattling against the china.  Steve realized his mouth was hanging open.  “The circus,” he said at last.
"Now, Miss Potts, we both know nothing could be further from the truth,” Jarvis said.  He smiled down at the boy.  “I am here to serve, and I'm quite pleased to be serving you.”  He sketched a slight bow, his back ramrod straight.  “If you'd like to come with me, I'll introduce you to the rest of the staff, young sir."  His voice was warm, soft and kind and coaxing, the sort of voice a child could trust, and when he held out his hand, the boy took it.
Gentle fingers cupped his chin, tipping his head up.  Natasha smiled, just a little.  “No.  This is the part of the story where you have to admit that hurting yourself is enough.  That’s enough of a reason to stop.  You’re enough.  You-” He tried to pull away, and her fingers tightened, just a tiny bit.  “That’s why you hate drinking in front of them, because they believe you’re enough.  They know you are.  And guess what else?”
"I'm HELPING," Ed said, and DJ crept towards the door, the cup cradled between his palms.  “I made it extra good.  If you're going to show up ten minutes late with coffee, it better be damn good coffee, after all.”
“I do not believe either of you,” Tony said, but he picked up the lemonade.  “I've had a very hard day.  I had to pose for pictures, and then I was expelled from my workshop, and I had to climb up the trellis twice to retrieve an intruder-”
It wasn't much, just the smallest little rumble of sound.  It wasn't offensive.  It was almost cute.  But it sure as hell didn't come from him.
“Thank you.”  She looked back at the kid.  “If they really wanted to, they could, right?”  The boy nodded.  “So why haven’t they?”
“No,” DJ said, and she laughed.  DJ’s legs swung, his heels bouncing against the rung of the stool.  “Toast, please?”
“I stand by my choices,” Tony said as Coulson did a slow pivot to face him.  There was a name tag on his jacket with read, ‘Do Not Try Me.’  Tony pointed his phone at him. “That adhesive is never coming off that cloth, you know that, right?”
“Know what this is?” Bucky said.  “This is the fact that you spent your entire life being incapable of getting laid, and now that you've managed it, you're-”
He ignored the way his stomach turned over. “Right.” He reached for a rag.  “Is this the part of the morality tale where I have to admit that by hurting myself, I’m hurting them too?”
“Yes, but it's cold and I'm dry, and I'd like to keep it that way,” Tony said.  Even if a cold shower was probably a good idea right now.  He shifted his weight, glad he was wearing a heavy pair of pajama pants instead of just his shorts.
“He carries the mark of his making,” Agatha said.  She reached for the teapot, refilling her cup.  “Magic has a particular…”  She paused, a frown crossing her features.  “Wanda, how did you put it?”
Stark huffed out a sigh.  “I involved Thor,” he admitted. “So logically, I know that being pissed off at you right now is stupid, and petty, and not helpful, but I’m still pissed off at you right now,” Stark said.  “And I”m not interested in hearing how stupid, petty and unhelpful that is.”  His hands flexed at his sides, the metal of his gauntlets clicking as his fingers moved.  “I get to be pissed for a while.  I’m not interested in being talked out of it, and I’m sure as hell not feeling fucking guilty about it.  I’m going to be pissed for as long as I want to be pissed, and that’s just something you’re going to have to suck up and deal with.  Understand?”
"This might surprise you, but our cuisine was kind of substandard," Steve said.  He paused.  "There's no prices on this menu."
Another shrug, but Mickey’s face was set in a sharp frown.  “They told ma we don’t qualify.”  He turned his head, his lips pursing as if he was going to spit, but he caught himself in time.  His shoulders hunched as he went back to his meal.  “Whatta they know?”
“And as soon as Romanov decides to get her ass in gear, we can get started,” Tony said, reaching for a piece of banana bread.
Tony leaned back into the solid warmth of Steve’s body.  “And how, exactly, do you know this?” he asked, his head tipping in Steve’s direction.
He smiled.  “You expect it to be cheap because you think the people making it should be working for cheap and that’s super fucking racist, cut that shit out.”
“Uh, I don’t know what you’ve heard,” Steve said, picking his words carefully, “but that’s not really…  That’s not part of my skillset.”
He certainly didn’t miss the way that Steve would flail around in his sleep, only calming down when he managed to latch onto Tony.  Even if they fell asleep on their own sides of what was, by any accounts, a very generously sized bed, nine times out of ten, Tony knew he’d wake up half pinned under Steve’s weight.
At the door, he paused, looking back at the street.  The car was still there, idling at the curb, and he gave one more wave before he raised his hand to knock.
The carpet felt rough beneath his fingertips, beneath his cheek, and he didn’ tknow when he’d fallen, how he’d fallen, but when he breathed in, it tasted like dust and whiskey.  Whiskey.  No.  Not whiskey.  Something else.  Something Obie-  Something Stane had given him.  His stomach turned over.
Tony paused.  “All the more reason to burn it.”  He gestured at the fireplace.  “A short trip to a fiery end.”
“Thank you for humoring me.”  He tossed the plate in the air and caught it, the movement smooth and easy.  DJ tracked the arc, waiting for the plate to land safely in Steve’s hand.  When it finally did, he exhaled, his shoulders relaxing.
“To hell with this,” he said, and   Steve spun, throwing the shield with quick, sharp precision.  It hit the attacker in the chest, lifting him straight off of his feet and sending him rolling across the pier.
Ellen took a breath. “Because every time someone who looks like you, someone as famous as you, joins the queer kids at that 'weird' table in the high school cafeteria of life, you make things just a tiny bit easier for everyone who doesn't look like you.” She tossed a hand through the air. “You buy us space. You buy us a measure of protection. Your existence normalizes us.”
“I have purchased three orphanages, two soup kitchens and a vocational school,” Tony said, loving him so much it hurt.  “I refuse to go into the medical profession, Rogers.”
"It has been a difficult morning, sir," Jarvis told him, opening the door to the bathroom.  “I shall ready your shaving kit.”
Tony's mouth opened. Closed. Steve kept smiling. “It's a special treat,” Tony managed at last.  “The movie.  Not the-”
For a long moment, Tony was still, his head down, his body taunt as a bowstring.  “I wasn’t aware any of you have ever met a collar you couldn’t slip out of,” he said at last.  He shook his head, starting up the stairs again.  “And no one here seems to have any interest in listening to me anyway.”
"You might be a bit too honest to be a New York City Police Officer," she said, her head tipped in his direction.
Not what she had been expecting.  Trip gave him a quick once over.  Nice suit, but wrinkled, his tie askew and the collar of his shirt bunched up under the lapel of his jacket.  He looked tired, but sober.  Maybe not voluntarily sober, but he wasn’t drunk.  At this point, Trip would take it.
He held his breath as the armor slid into place, the metal smoothing around him like a liquid, settling into place even as he fell, as he fell through the nothing and into something else entirely.
Tony’s eyes fell shut.  “Right. Of course.” He pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering when, exactly, he’d acquired this headache.  “And what do we consider appropriate precautions?”
“So they happen pretty often, you can return to the laws at any time,” DJ finished.  “It’s…  Important.”
Tony's eyes slid in DJ's direction.  “I'll do the talking, and slip you secret notes when I need you to sabotage my many enemies.”  He arched an eyebrow.  “Do we have a deal?”
The usher threw the door open ahead of him, and Tony shot through it, blinking at the bright lights of the foyer.  “I need somewhere quiet,” he said, his words brisk.  “And private.”
“Then he should have plenty of money,” Tony said.  Jarvis said nothing.  Tony sighed.  “Jay, how much is in DJ’s account right now?”
“You didn’t order for seventy people,” Tony said, his voice brisk.  “You ordered seventy assorted dessert platters.”  Steve stared at him.  Tony gave him a slight, sympathetic smile.  “And each of them is intended to feed ten people.”
“Thank me by not getting me killed,” Tony said.  He headed up the stairs, tugging her along with him.  “Or arrested.”  He glanced back at her.  “Jan?”
He knew he did, that he had.  He felt the shift in his weight, saw the edges of his vision white out the way it did when he lost everything but his target.  He remembered the brief glimpse of red hair and black fabric, the flash of sun on metal, on glass, the sound of everything breaking, metal, glass, stone, the sound like his own heart stopping.  He remembered hitting his target, with all the force he could muster, body colliding with body, and the ground opening up to swallow him, falling away beneath him, and he held on, held on, held on, even as he fell.
Frowning she tried to remember what happened. “You took me to that club? You said something like ‘it’s more or a distraction for me so I don’t rip the bastards throat out?’ Or something along those lines?” He chuckled softly; her heart stopped for a moment — god she’d missed that sound.
“I am. I’m sorry about the text.. I was just so worried. You know what I’m like, the world’s worst over-thinker.” Bucky groaned, running a hand over the back of his neck.
“That’s what I was hoping you were gonna say.” There on the corner of Jefferson and Leroy, two idiots finally got their happy ending. If Steve looked extra smug the next day; Tony would think it was because of him but in
“Yeah that’s right, you then proceeded to get fucking drunk off your ass and you said you can’t remember anything else from that night?” She shook her head.
that isn’t Nathan’s or somewhere dangerous.” Going into her wardrobe he started throwing clothes at her. “If you’re not ready in ten I will barge right back in here you hear?”
Bucky never arrived home that night. She waited up as long as she could after giving the flat a thorough clean but when she woke in the morning it was clear he hadn’t come home. Her keys were still in the door. Groaning as she rubbed the back of her neck having fallen asleep on the couch, she checked her phone.
She knew it was going to happen, her getting distracted beyond belief at Uni. Trudging back to the flat she could smell the aromatic aroma of Italian cooking. Clumsily opening the door, her face fell a little when she noticed Steve’s shield by the door.
"Nice of you to finally show up.", she hissed at him quietly, not wanting to interrupt the meeting again.
And so Peter began the grand tale of his normal afternoon turning into a major fuck up as a madman with self-made acid guns decided to terrorize civilians.
"Now let's go. Happy's waiting.", Tony said and put an arm around the teenager's shoulder, guiding him towards the car.
When the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist entered the conference room half an hour after the beginning (not the longest time of being late but still), with sunglasses hiding his eyes and coffee in his hand while staring stubbornly at the phone screen and tapping widely with the other, Pepper's eye twitched in annoyance. The man who currently presented a new marketing strategy stopped in his tracks and waited in anticipation till the newcomer settled down, but Tony just glanced up shortly and then made a hand gesture meaning as much as 'Continue whatever you're doing, I don't care and settled down beside her.
"Tony.", she began and said man winced at her partly disappointed, partly exhausted tone, "Whatever is going on with you has to stop."
"I am afraid he is getting suspicious. At first, he was certain he had me under his control after he learned about the...disagreements regarding Rogers and me, but truth to be told, I just don't care anymore. What he does and what he doesn't do is not my responsibility."
He told Rhodey about them, of course, he did. If not him, then who else? Rhodey had always been there for Tony, no matter if it was at a college party where he drank way too much for a 15-year-old and passed out with the danger of choking on his vomit or after the whole dilemma with Afghanistan and the shrapnels in his heart. There wasn't any person he could trust more than the Colonel, maybe not even Pepper who was loyal by his side for so many years.
The large kitchen and living room, fitting for the large amount of people that were supposed to find their home here, were completely and unsurprisingly empty. It has been a while since he has been up here. Most of his time is spent either in his lab or the business sector of the compound. He doesn't even sleep in his bedroom anymore. The countertops of the kitchen were clean, probably due to Vision who takes his time cooking sometimes, the connected living room on the other hand was dark. The lights were out and the shutters closed. He could practically see the dust settling on the furniture.
Tony didn't hesitate for long and put the case on the ground and pulled at the handles, gauntlet automatically surrounding his hands. Then he pulled the rest to his chest, the metal enveloping him, the arc reactor flickering to life and the display inside his helmet lighting up while FRIDAY's voice gave him directions. Tony ignored the passerby's ogling him and taking out their phones to film. He just put his hand straight to his side and seconds later he was soaring over the rooftops and packed streets.
After a few moments of radio silence, Tony snapped out of whatever thought he was caught in and began focusing on the person in front of him again. "Sorry."
Tony just shrugged his shoulders and tried to summon a smile. From the look on Pepper's face, he must've failed miserably. "Alright.", he then agreed while knowing that he will either lay awake for a few hours before giving up and starting to work again or, and that was more likely, going right back to where he left off.
"Take care of yourself, Mr. Stark.", was the last thing Peter said before sliding into the back seat and closing the door behind him. And Tony couldn't shake the terrible feeling that
Tony said nothing and instead pointed above him when he sat down on the stool. Peter's eyes followed his finger and faced the scorch marks, "Oh."
Rhodey seemed to recognize the dilemma the other was in, he just kneeled in front of him, put a hand on his knee, and squeezed a bit, letting him take his time to sort out his thoughts.
"Fine.", he muttered and took off the sunglasses. He knew that if he tested his luck any further it would end with him and Pepper fighting a possible fistfight. They were both stubborn like that.
Speaking of Tony, Steve hadn't heard of his co-leader since he walked out of that damned bunker with a half-conscious Bucky hanging off of his shoulder. It's not like he expected him to reach out after everything that went down, he understood that the genius need his time.
"What did you come here for anyway?", Tony asked, suddenly remembering that there was a reason for his best friend's short-termed appearance.
"An asshole? Yeah, I think even people who haven't met him personally know that. But your worry is unnecessary. Even if Secretary Ross should find out about your whereabouts, I doubt anything is going to happen to my brother. He is a king and the Black Panther, don't forget that."
And it was true. Rogers was an adult who could make his own decisions, Tony is not going to interfere with that (he learned it the hard way).
"Oh, don't bullshit me Tony.", she said, her arms now crossing in front of her chest, "Look, I know that a lot has happened this month and I want to help you, I do. You are my best friend but, Tony, you also have responsibilities that you can not neglect. And turning up to meetings, that also regard you may I add, on time is one of them."
"You are worrying too much, Captain. He is supposed to be back in the next hour.", she answered and then stood up to walk towards the desk with many screens.
"Is Ross acting up again?", the blonde asked, not so sure if he even wanted to know. Whenever the Secretary was involved, his blood pressure skyrocketed.
"What?", the man asked confused but pulled the car over, away from the ongoing traffic, and stopped in a parking zone nearby. "What are you doing?"
"Really? I can stay here and help? Mr. Stark that's awesome!", grinned excited teenager while bouncing slightly on his heels.
Two hours later the clacking of heels against the marble floor announced Tony's doom as Pepper rounded the corner, just coming out of the conference room which Tony left all too eager.
And his estimated time was correct. After fixing the first layers of fabric was done, they got to work at restoring the lost cables and circuits. It wasn't too difficult even though the size of it all sometimes made Tony's skin crawl in frustration.
"No, Shuri, no war is going to happen anytime soon. That was a meeting, no assembly.", her brother replied before turning towards his guests, "Captain Rogers, Sergeant Barnes, glad to see you both in good health."
He knew that the situation was risky. One wrong move and the threat of a prison cell in the Raft was becoming a harsh reality and Tony could think of better ways to spend the rest of his days rather than rotting away in jail.
“We got here,” Ellen said.  It had nearly killed her, but they'd made it in time to do some interviews, take some pictures, file the first Western dispatch from the celebration.  Then she'd had a little too much to drink and way too little sleep.  She pulled her pillow over her face.  “There is-  There is nothing happening, there is no news, there's nothing at all, there is nothing you could tell me that could get me out of this bed."
Steve grabbed a couple of plates from the shelf, setting them down on the kitchen table.  He filled them with thick slices of bread and chunks of cheese, half a roasted potato, still warm from the peddler on the corner, and the sweet rolls that he'd intended for his breakfast in the morning.  While he waited for the tea to boil, he grabbed a salami from the shelf, unwrapping it just far enough to cut a few thick rounds.
“Now, we can move this one,” Tony said, pointing to a piece.  “Or we could-” DJ grabbed a piece, setting it down on the board with a great deal of force.  “Or that.  That’s also a move that we could, we could do that.  It’s a legal move.  I don’t know why we’d move there, but-  We definitely can.”
Peter stared straight ahead, his mouth pursed up tight.  “I was HUNGRY,” he said, with the sort of wounded dignity that only a teenager could manage.  Steve hid his smile behind his coffee cup.
He wasn't sure how long he'd been sitting there, letting his mind wander, when his phone started to play “Star Spangled Man.”  Grinning, he reached for it.  “Ciao, el capitan.”
“We’ll put that one in the ‘maybe’ column,” Steve said, as if he had any idea what bakery he was putting in that category.  Of course, right now, everything was in the ‘maybe’ column, so he didn’t suppose it really mattered.  He looked Greer.  “Do you want me to-” She held up a hand in his direction.  Steve tried not to smile.  “Guess that’s a no.”
“What?” he asked, and Steve realized that he was grinning, he was laughing.  Tony's head tipped to the side.  Tony looked at him, something like concern in his face.  “Steve?  Are you  okay?”
“No, they have a strawberry cream puff covered with a a mocha chocolate glaze,” Agatha said, cheese coiled neatly in her spoon, “and nine wastes of calories.”
“Fine, go take your shirt off and drape yourself on a car hood,” Sam said, throwing his hands in the air, “and excuse me for being a traditionalist.”
Without looking back, Tony turned towards the stairs, one foot braced on the bottom step.  “Come on, Deej,” he said, holding out a hand.  “It’s dinner time.”
DJ hopped down the stairs, his feet together, his hand still held tight in Steve’s.  On the first floor, he paused, his head tipping towards the billiard room.  “Want to check that one?” Steve asked.  DJ nodded.  “All right.  Let’s go.”
She looked up, at the high ceiling of the lobby, with its soaring metal and glasswork.  "And that's what Mr. Stark offers.  The possibility of living a long, respected, productive life.  A life where he can help people, where he can be..."
“This is the most Catholic thing I’ve ever seen you do, and that’s, that is saying something,” Tony pointed out.
Steve pulled the blankets up over Tony's back, smoothing them into place with a gentle hand.  “Good night, Tony,” he whispered.
“How many books do you have?” Tony asked, setting it down on the table.  Under that was 'Stranger Than We Can Imagine: Making Sense of the Twentieth Century.'  He grinned.  Harder than it should've been, probably.
DJ's eyebrows dipped low.  “You remember,” he said.  “You never forget.  But I didn't...”  He straightened up, his fingers still locked on the fabric of his pants.  “I didn't need you.”
“Know what he did?  He filmed himself singing Baby Shark in his underwear,” Jess said to Tony.  “Because when Carol offered him the burnt marshmallows, he wandered into the kitchen and he didn’t have pants on.”
Tony ignored him.  “Not all of you, of course.   Not even most of you.  But some of you fuckers?  The ones who have a Michelin star or more on the door?  The ones with shiny magazine covers with your smug little faces on it framed in the front lobby?  The ones charging fifty dollars or more a plate for an entree?”
Steve snapped the pocket watch closed and returned it to his pocket.  “Close enough,” he said with a smile.
“I’ve told you, you can do an amazing amount of damage with a simple pen,” Natasha told her.  She reached for a ballpoint on the desk. “Here, let me show you, just-”
“With excellent biceps, give me that much,” Carol said, not bothered by that.  “So you can give me a sleeveless dress-”
“You know, before I took this job, I would've thought that a sentence like that could only be a metaphor,” Marcy said.
“There's a password,” Steve said. “Leftover from the Prohbition days, I suppose, but even though anyone can get in, if you don't have the password, the barman won't let you into the back rooms.” He locked eyes with Tony. “I mean, fella like me wouldn't have the password.”
Tony didn’t look up from his newspaper.  “Thank you, Jarvis. You may deposit it directly into the hearth.”
The young man stepped out into the shop.  He was slight of frame, but with broad, well-muscled shoulder beneath the thin fabric of his shirt, and not as tall as Steve was, but few people were, now.  He had dark hair and dark eyes, and when he smiled, there was an air of puckish humor around his mouth that made Steve smile back.  “Ah, you see, that is a problem,” he said, swinging around the end of the counter.  “Mr. Pym works small, and he works large.  I’m afraid you’ve caught him in a rather expensive mood.” He gave the watchmaker a fond, if exasperated, look.  “And as such, I find he’s not likely to be interested in anything smaller than a grandfather clock right now.”
“Did I-” Tony started, and there was a tremor in his voice that he hated.  He swallowed hard, and tried again.  “Did I scare you?”
“Does he remember anything?” Natasha asked, and Tony was grateful to her for asking the question he couldn’t manage.
“He does,” Happy said.  “Otherwise, you wouldn’t still be here.”  He pulled up to the gate, and an unfamiliar man appeared on the other side of the wrought iron bars.  Happy gave him a wave, and the man nodded, unlatching the gates.
“Yes, sir.” Justin bent his head over his food, concentrating very hard on cutting his potatoes in perfect pieces.
“So we set out,” she agreed.  “And in an hour or so, we are well into the grasslands.  With a half dozen very embarrassed men, and a few dozen very frustrated goats.  Because the goats?  Knew where the city was and they were ready to get back to their comfortable paddocks.  Through this comes the King of Wakanda, who is well aware that he is being judged by a vast array of goats.”
Tony watched them go, a strange, almost unfamiliar feeling of satisfaction curling through him.  He turned back to the workbench and caught Rogers' eye.  “There,” he said, reaching for his coffee cup.  “All sorted.”
Bobbi leaned over to take it.  Tony sat back in his seat.  “Actually, Peter and DJ need adult supervision.  And you're available.”
An instant later, he did, the pale glow of repulsors skimming across the horizon, a second form slicing through the night, making a beeline straight for DJ, who was falling.  Who was still falling.
“I was just worried about you.. I didn’t know where you were.” She muttered, feeling terribly small with the towering figure above her.
“Oh yeah, shit I forgot. Of course!” She spoke quickly, she was already pissed at Bucky; it wouldn’t do for him to be ganged up by both her and Steve. “How was the mission?” Quickly and effortlessly changing the subject. Giving Steve the chance to rant about everything and anything he could reveal about the mission. While he spoke, she sent a text to Bucky.
“If drunk is about to come out of your mouth I’m whacking you with your own shield. He can’t get drunk; well all know that so why don’t you stop coming up with excuses for his behaviour and just ‘get over yourself’ like I’m doing huh?” Expression blank, but the tears that were starting to well in her eyes were clear for anyone close enough to see.
“Laura, darlin’ it’s late. Come on we’ll got through to my-“ Steve was interrupted by the front door slamming. “The fuck Buck?” He said turning to his best friend.
