Confident, he climbs back onto the table.
Jets.
Finally, he’s lying on the floor, two boots on his feet. He’s sweating from the exertion, a mixture of blood and salt on his shirt as he wipes his forehead. He hears the video call sound from somewhere above him. A sigh escapes his lips. Pushing back with his hands, he uses the thrusters to hover back to his feet.
Should he go back to the Avengers, to
He knew it wasn’t Jarvis – the voice that he had heard. Wishful thinking will get him absolutely nowhere. However, for now, he’s back in his body and by using an old backup file and the glory of the internet, his AI is fully functional. The AI answers to Ghost; he categorically refuses to look too far into why.
.” Tony closes his eyes again.
Only, the phone isn’t there anymore.
Hysterical laughter escapes him. It’s not too soon to laugh about an actual moon being thrown at you, right?
On any normal day, Natasha would be impossible to read; Tony’s too exhausted to be looking properly and she’s far too careful with her emotions, however, Tony spots the sadness on her face nonetheless. They’re both getting sloppy.
Red flashes across his screen, and he only just manages to duck as one of the group takes a swing for his head with a piece of wood.
And maybe Tony knew it too. But what had made Howard amazing in the tech industry had inadvertently made his son excel further than anyone would believe. How could that scruffy, shy boy turn into an eccentric Superhero with a family of super people?
“As you wish, Guardian. Come get some food boy.”
With a groan, he grabs the bottle of whiskey. Scarcely managing to steady his hand long enough not to send it clattering to the floor, he brings the bottle to his chapped lips. He takes a long drag from it, choking because of the angle he’s attempting this whole operation at. He pulls the panel towards him and checks his vital signs.
“Wha-“
This pattern continued until time was merely constructed by his successes and failures. He’s got bruises on top of bruises, a lump on his elbow, his feet don’t feel attached to his body and frankly he’s not sure if he could handle the full body version of this.
“Yeah well,” Rocket sniffed, rubbing a paw over his gun once again, “What can ya do.”
But, he never finds his efforts enough. He’ll continue to try to atone.
“We both know you could have contacted your team at any time. I sat you at the communications panel, but I suspected you would not do it.”
Striding down the path, he smiles small to himself. He doesn’t need Ghost to inform him that the quiet steps behind him is in fact Harley, or that the harrumph that followed was down to his own lack of reaction. The silence goes from victorious to uncomfortable. In spite of feeling the need to say something to the kid, he finds himself at a loss. If Harley’s here, in New York, hanging out with a bunch of misfits, standing up for the Avengers, then where is him Mom? And his little sister… Tony forces the bile back into the depths of his stomach.
“What did you call me?” Tony says, blinking as the water droplets cascade off his eyelashes. “Don’t ever call me that again.”
Towering trees appear before him, and he stands on feeble legs. The ground is sodden, the air thick with the humidity that follows rainfall. The wreckage that brought him here is left discarded as he takes weary steps toward the forest. The bark is a burnt colour, singed, certainly not that of a normal tree. His hand scrapes along it, pieces of wood lodging under his fingernails. It’s tangible.
He’s been monitoring what’s left of the Avengers near non-stop since their little talk. The room they were situated in must be that of a common room – he’s looked long enough now to see the ornate decoration, the elaborate vases and rugs. It’s beautiful and, although his soul lies dead in his chest, he longs for the warmth that he can see through the giant windows.
“Right back at you sweetheart!” The doors close as he shouts it back to her, “You know where to find me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“If Iron Man was here, he’d bust all your asses for threatening him and his super pals.”
For the second time in his life, Dad was right.
“Are we seriously walking all the way to Avengers Headquarters?” Harley’s pitching voice interrupts his thoughts. “And why didn’t you tell anyone you survived?” He kicks a rock and looks into the road, “I thought you would come looking for me. Instead I came to find you only to find everyone divided! Why haven’t you defended them? Where’s the rest of the Avengers?”
There it goes again! Her voice – he can’t ignore it. Not caring whether any of this is real, he takes off at a run into the woods.
“It is not
And, he can admit, his default state was being exasperated with Tony. Not with any heat, because all that anger is there to mask the
The next hours pass fluidly, he’s so enthused about being able to build things the world feels a little less like it’s collapsing. Fixing the repulsors on his old armour, he manages to get them to a semi-operational state. They’ll be able to fly, anyhow. Well, sort of. It will be the jet equivalent to human jogging. He only needs a temporary replacement until he can get his brain to work on the nano-machines. His brain might be the answer – huh. He realises he’s sitting there with the end of a wrench sticking out of his mouth, saliva dripping onto his own hand. Quickly, he wipes it on his shirt, pulling a large board towards himself.
Her smile is rueful, Steve knows her mind is elsewhere. He wonders where Thor will go, what with his people gone and a talking space raccoon glued to his shoulder. Absently, he panics about how to contact him if something big and bad comes to Earth. At this point, Earth is half beat.
“What are you looking at?”
“My sister was the only reason any of them even tolerated me. And now she’s dead. Figure out where you want to be dropped or I’ll dump you whenever we enter the atmosphere.”
Dummy brings over various things, first a cup. An empty cup. Tony doesn’t even bother gracing him with a statement, he pushes the cup back into his claw and continues clearing his desk. The books are not so neatly stacked to the side of the room and the rest of his equipment is effectively pushed to one side. He enters a code onto the surface and pulls a lever on the side. A crunching of metal fills the room, a soft hum following as the table begins to move. Electromagnets in the base of all of his furniture means that redesigning the room is a piece of cake. He pushes the table as far as he can, then drops it back into place. Making the point of flicking his eyes at Dummy, he sees him about to pick up one of the books
his brain helpfully supplies. He ignores it, the niggling idea that everything is so very wrong and tells himself once again that he is Iron Man. All he needs to do is to get what he needs. Deep breaths and baby steps.
Back when the team first formed, he compiled a list of their attributes and weaknesses, determined to upgrade their suits and equipment to be revised to their quickly growing lists of enemies. He worked on an improved quiver for Clint, more flexible clothing with secret knife slots for Nat; even after Sokovia, he’d been trying to advance Steve’s shield. He had a prototype ready.
His eyes narrow at her. The chair she’s sitting in hasn’t moved, he can just see the crown of her head, the way she coolly controls the ship. Of course, in between blacking out and being stuck in this ship, he had fiddled with some of the buttons and screens in front of him. At any point, he could have called. He couldn’t bring himself to dial the number. It felt like too much, too many emotions to be conveying across a line.
“There have been four attempts to contact you, two from Colonel Rhodes, one from Mr Banner and one from Shuri.” Ghost says, impassively, as Tony scoots past Dummy to set up an electron microscope on the desk. “She was very nearly successful in her attempts to get through.”
“Tony?”
“Ghost?” He tests it out on his tongue. He could get accustomed to it, and the deep growl of his voice was a soothing change from Friday. “I programmed you, just now?”
Sorry this has taken so long... I'm making this up as I go along and with work and everything it's been hard to get into the flow. Mistakes will be fixed soon, I just wanted to get this chapter up :_) Thank you for reading, any feedback would be really appreciated!
Something in Tony’s body drops, his stomach; his heart; his brain. He swallows, checking his thousand-watt smile was in place.
“Thor’s
“Ghost, what day is it?” He asks, tiredly.
“You should talk to them,” Stoic, she nods and returns to the ship.
For some unknown reason, he was in the mindset that breaching Earth’s atmosphere, coming
It’s time to get to work.
“In the direction of food.”
He meanders across the bedroom, changing his bandage on his chest while he moves, searching for a clean shirt. Rifling through his drawers, Ghost’s voice almost makes him jump.
“Guardian you shouldn-“
Anyway, Harley and a big mob of angry people. Nothing good could possibly come from that combination. Tony inhales deeply, trying to get his breathing under control before rounding the corner. The street is thrumming with nervous energy, people pushing and shoving, news outlet vans parked in the middle of the road, people clambering on top of them.
The retina scans work, thankfully, and the sound of hinges opening has never sounded so good in all his life. He throws the boxes of his tools onto the workbench and promptly collapses onto the nearest seat. Unconsciousness grabs him without warning, his eyes closing without his permission.
“I AM Iron Man.” He says it once, then again and again until his practically sweating with the exertion of it. Without his suit, he’s exposed. Out here? He’s a live wire, edgy and tripping, waiting for the spark to set him off.
He all but throws himself into the hot spray of the shower, appreciating the way it pounds against him, the sound drowning some of the loathing and fear in his mind. The dirt and blood swirls around the drain. He watches it dilute in the clean water, and wonders if it’s normal to have vicious pains in every nerve of your body. Retching, Tony slides his back down the shower until he’s sat on the floor under the cooler spray.
The pain is searing and Tony has to lean against the side of the books for a minute, pulling his faceplate off to take a deep, grounding breath.
Sorry this took so long to update, I had to put my dog down two weeks ago and I wasn't doing great. Still not doing great, actually, but this was the first time I felt like writing so, yeah. More of a filler but hopefully more coming quicker after this.
While the reality stone truly does terrify him the most, it’s the not the least containable. Time is his real concern. If Thanos closes his fist he could readily undo any progress Tony would have made in stopping him. Although, Tony suspects that like a cat to an injured mouse, Thanos will humour him. He’ll allow him feeble attempts to match a God – ha – with a fist full of the most powerful weapon, if only to make his end more satisfying for himself.
“So it’s Ghost now, huh. Do you at least have a suit this time?”
Humming the Metallica song that’s playing, he puts down the welder. His work is not to his usual standards, but it’ll have to do for now. He’ll need to get supplies for the nanotech while he’s out.
The last part of her sentence is hushed, and Tony feels like he’s in the courtyard being given a cigarette to smoke by the older kids.
?!” Laughing incredulously, her glare hardened and she pushed him roughly on the shoulder, “You cannot believe that you can undo what has been done. I saw you fight. There’s nothing left in you.”
Tony dies a little more inside. He drops the books onto a desk and lifts his shirt. Forgoing the whole stitches thing, despite his skin being badly damaged (he can hear Ghost in his ear
Her voice startles him out of his introspection. The fact that she has bothered to ask him a preference mystifies him a second longer.
“Answer the call G,” He says, his back to the camera, body drifting towards the desk. He shuffles with the petri dishes with the rest of the bots in. “Uh hello?”
that’s running on a loop in his ears.
He raises the bottle into the air, toasting Ghost’s good idea, and that’s when he sees it. Or well him. Himself, in the reflection, along with Bruce and Nat and
“Saturday, you’ve spent three days watching them.” Ghost’s voice resounds through him.
That flip phone has been in his pocket for the better part of two years now and, like his coffee, every morning and every night he flicks across Steve’s number. It is a lot of wasted time, virtually too much for his perfectionist brain to handle.
Ghost’s voice is loud in Tony’s small bathroom. He covers his ears petulantly.
He stretches the cricks in his back, slouching over to release the pressure on his wounds. Then, he takes long, stumbling, strides towards his bathroom, closing the door with a loud ‘bang’ behind him. There’s a conversant feral panic that’s deep set in his eyes when he glances at the mirror. The same dread-filled look that he feels in his chest.
Tony shrugs it off. Plays it like he’s totally a-ok and everything is absolutely fine with him and the situation he’s in is unquestionably normal. It’s not, he and Wong both know, and when he picks up the nearest book, flicking through it with a dejected and absent mind, Wong doesn’t query it.
The kid that’s talking now picks up a brick, and it doesn’t take a genius to work out what happens next. He lobs it at Tony, who moves his shoulder slightly to miss the punt.
Taking the leap again, he trips as the boot almost completely forms around his right foot; the sudden change of weight caught him completely off guard. So did Dummy, claw outstretched and tangled in bandages standing over him. The slight and familiar trickle of blood seeps down his forehead. What did he hit anyway?
“Tony I gotta go, just promise me you won’t beat yourself up too much about this, ok?” Rhodey flaps an irritated hand at the person again, “If you can make it over here, it’d be great to have you back working with us for real.”
The fact that the Avengers had two of the stones at one point terrifies and frustrates Tony to no end. If only they’d destroyed them while they had them. They should never have created Ultron or put that stone in Vision. For Thanos to get it from Vision destroyed Wanda as much as it did his own creation. He shakes his head, trying to refocus.
“Where am I to leave you?”
In a weird way he preferred the anarchy; if he had nothing to do all he’d have is to sit and think about all he’s lost, from both his past and present life. Having to sort through the mess was time consuming but necessary, with losses for Wakanda taken in all factions. He wished they hadn’t brought the fight here, although he highly doubts they would have fought as valiantly as they did without T’Challa’s help.
Obediently, Dummy beeps a few times. He successfully picks up the tray, without dropping the contents everywhere like Tony expected him to and brings it to the table.
She shakes her head, staring at the screen with Tony on it. Neither of them says anything for a minute. Steve knows this is her way to scold him, her face still tight as she watches Tony lean on the counter. He treated Tony horribly on that first live feed, and he’s not entirely sure what came over him.
A tower of a woman pushes past him, and as he wades into the thick of the mob he finds himself weaving and bobbing blows with various people.
“Where is Wong, G?”
“I see.”
He’d managed to salvage what was left of the nanotech that made up his armour from the fight. It wasn’t much, just a leg piece and a shattered arm, the remains of his face plate. There he goes again flaunting his greatest weakness to all his enemies. In the next fight he needed to be smarter, keep all of his cards close to his chest.
So why’d he go through so much effort over the Accords? Penance. He doesn’t trust himself half the time; he’s notorious for his bad decisions. He shouldn’t have forced it on the rest of the Superhero community, though. They can’t be blamed for his paranoia.
Why wouldn’t he? Tony has revolutionised the tech industry as the world currently knew it. He’d heard the rumours of Wakanda, they were hard to miss, and he had no doubt that a civilisation allowed to exist and thrive without outer world influences could no doubt put him to shame. But he was one man. A brilliant brain that has been moulded and shaped and beaten. God was his brain tired. The insomnia and anguish and anger that had got him to this point would surly have driven any normal person insane.
“Sir, I’d advise against-“
It was a perfectly standard course to downtown, when something picks up on his sensors.
Tony nods as much, slowly, gauging Steve’s reaction.
For once, he was fresh out of shrewd comments.
((Also sorry for another filler (and for repeating the Tony waking up bit, it was relevant to see Steve's POV), but we're gearing up for something big reeeeeal soon))
“Only I’m allowed to do that, kid, what did you do that for?”
“Good boy, now go wait somewhere I won’t land on you, ok?”
Maybe that’s another reason Steve doesn’t want him dead.
There has to be a way to sort his brain into folders like his computer. It will absolutely end in failure if big, purple and ugly can get a hint of any of his real fears with the reality stone. Water. Howard. Everyone he knows and loves dying.
There were a lot of things Tony was prepared for, a shouting match – absolutely. Screaming the place down, undoubtably. One of them cutting the other off, sure! Steve breaking down, being emotionally vulnerable and telling Tony, of all people, was unprecedented.

“Did you… Did you just cut off Captain America?”
“Very funny. Are you… Ok?”
“You think you,
Before disconnecting totally, Tony drops a few lines of code in. Their video feed pops back up. He watches, dejected, wrapping the bandages around his chest. His breathing is still worse for wear, but the ache is manageable. Drinking the last of his whiskey, he settles in to watch his friends from afar, wishing he could be with them, be the person who could be there for them. The news of the dead weighs on him; Ghost doesn't interrupt him as he sits there blankly, turning the scalpel in one hand once again deep in mourning.
Amazed, Tony watches as Thor arranges Rocket on his shoulder, his tail lying limp and scorched down his back. He hands the racoon his gun, which he rests besides Thor’s ear. Seemingly pleased, they leave the room like that together.
“But-!”
The call cuts off. Tony sits there for a minute, chewing the side of his cheek; he only stops as the acrimonious taste of copper sweeps across his tongue. Abruptly, he stands.
The pact with the American government, the fight with Steve.
“Have you noticed, that Spider kid isn’t with him?”
He thought the Avengers would be different. He thought he’d found a family, people he could start to let the walls down near and trust. He and Steve didn’t get on all that well to begin with, but the years had changed that. The battles and bloodshed and drinks after a debrief with Fury.
Wong shakes his head, muttering beneath his breath.
Sniffing, Tony staggered to his feet. His sudden motion surprised his only companion, who raised what was presumably an eyebrow at him in question.
(It was lucky that Wong had taken a likening to him, forced or not, because without the mystical coffee portal Tony wouldn’t have gotten as far as he had.)
need to build new armour. Something that doesn’t expose his abilities and could withstand at least one of the Infinity Stones. He rubbed his temples, he needed to find someone with better expertise, but who?
Another scream follows; Tony closes his eyes and counts to ten.
“Yeah, guess they thought they could try figure something out by poking around in space. Thor’s axe is pretty handy for jumping planets.”
“She told you, that she was going?”
“If that stupid wizard hadn’t of given up the Time Stone, Thanos would never have made it to Earth. One life for billions, Rhodey, how can I ever live up to that? It’s my fault. It’s all my fault.”
So, he settles himself into her ship, resigning to remain quiet, not taking much of it in. The technology should be fascinating, the stabilisers and controls, the brightly lit panels and obvious signs of damage and bodged circuitry. On a normal day, Tony would be sticking his head inside every little compartment.
screaming. There should be sweat on his brow and a sob lodged in his chest – he doesn’t deserve a peaceful night sleep. Not yet.
Tony’s interest is peaked, and with everything in his workspace back in order he thinks about how aggressively certain those kids were back in the street. Definitely not a good time for the rest of the gang to show back up. He’s got a lot on his mind now though, and since he won’t be going out again any time soon he waves Ghost off. The design of the Mark 48 needs to be worked on, there’s a plethora of Infinity Stone magic to go through and he needs to talk to Thor. He hasn’t got time for New York’s personal vendettas right now.
was like taking a toddler to a rated 18+ movie. A real life movie with lots of blood and gore and world ending sadness.
“What?” Tony asks, beginning to regret bringing the kid here in the first place. There wasn’t a better option though, no other secret headquarters or Avenger he can coerce into keeping him. Ultimately, they’ll have to have the conversation about Harley’s family and how he got to New York, too.
At the end of the day though, now that Tony is alone (except for the blue iRobot, who hasn’t said a word to him yet, and has an air of indifference to their defeat) he can only feel resentment for who he is.
He’s blinking rapidly, tears flowing freely. He can’t hold them back, he hasn’t cried properly for all that he’s lost. Too afraid to call Steve’s number and have it go to voicemail. Petrified of the idea that half his friends are dead.
He scoffed, “Now you’re just being dramatic.”
“Sam and Bucky saw it when they went on that date a month ago, and I didn’t believe them until I went to — doesn’t matter. I’ve been trying to get it back from MoMA so I could burn the damn thing before you could see it, but it’s surprisingly difficult to go about that without revealing that we’re immortal beings and
. Bucky had made jokes about Steve’s husband being abducted by aliens, and upon seeing the genuine concern on his best friend’s face, left him with a comforting, “Tony’s a big boy, Stevie. If anyone can find their way back home, it’s him.”
Peggy was as sharp today as she was back during the war; the moment he and Tony came into the room to greet her, there was a twinkle in her eye. When they sat on the couch across from her, leaving a good foot of space between them after a teary reunion, she’d asked, “How long have you been courting one another?”
A/N: For Ari!
Dancing with Tony always made Steve’s heart feel so warm. Content. Happy.
“Did you just kiss Captain America?”
“Yeah. Because you kept your promise. Because I’m home.” Steve only regarded him with a sweet smile and love-struck eyes. “I love you,” he whispered, reaching up to grasp Tony’s chin before placing a chaste, delicate kiss to his lips.

“Do you see Daddy anywhere, squirt?”
Stars danced behind Steve’s eyes. His breath escaped his lungs. He felt his dick thicken in Tony’s grasp, sense the jolt of pleasure up his spine when Tony’s fingers pressed firmly against an untouched spot inside of him.
Tony pointedly kissed Steve again and raised a hand to throw a bird up in Rhodey’s direction.
When a couple weeks before, Steve looked on edge and shaken in one of their missions and Tony had to step up and lead the group, he was worried about his boyfriend and wanted nothing more than to comfort him. And he did just that when everything was over and they were back at home, he didn’t question Steve and asked what was going on in his mind, he just hugged tight. He knew PTSD and trauma first hand, he still woke up thinking he was falling through New York’s sky and something as small as having things handed to him could make him panic, he also knew sometimes just standing in front of the fridge for a few minutes could make Steve feel cold for weeks. But they had both learned how to work their way around the trauma and the bad days, Tony for one learned that hugging his boyfriend tightly and asking JARVIS to turn the bedroom’s temperature up could keep Steve’s nightmares and shivering at bay. So that night, after the mission, he just held Steve close, whispering words of comfort and making sure he knew everything was alright.

“A little head’s up would’ve been nice,” Steve hissed under his breath, squeezing Tony’s hand as he did.
“Hi,” Tony chuckled, tilting his head down to press his lips against the tip of Steve’s nose.

Tony’s head was spinning from the constant lack of oxygen flowing to his brain – or maybe it was spinning because Steve was kissing him stupid. They were already half-undressed at this point, random articles of clothing littering a path from the couch to his bedroom.
Steve loved Tony, and he thought maybe keeping the fact that his best friend had been brainwashed to kill Howard and Maria was a kindness to him, sparing him in some way. When he and Tony got into a shouting match regarding that little piece of information, Steve began to wonder if maybe he was just sparing
Tony couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment his boyfriend started acting weird. He did feel it through the days, and now, looking in retrospect, he could remember some of the things that made him realize something was up, but he still couldn’t tell exactly when it started or what caused it or how to solve it.

“I don’t either.” Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s, staring into his blue eyes like he could read the future in them. “But I’ll figure out how to bring you home. I promise.”

“No van then,” Steve chuckled, grinning so wide that his face started to hurt. His eyes pricked with tears, and he climbed into the sofa on top of Tony, hugging his husband with everything he had in him. “You really mean it?” he asked again, still stunned, daring to hope. “You want to have a kid?”

So, it was completely out of left field when Tony had brought it up one afternoon, scrolling through his social media and suddenly saying, “Would you adopt or get a surrogate?”

Bucky started to walk, trudging through the mud building up on the sidelines as the rest of the Avengers followed behind him, ducking away from the falling rain. The field speakers crackled on, calling for “peace and calm on the field, please” before it was announced that the soccer game would be rescheduled for when a storm wasn’t brewing.

“Sure, but I didn’t see you making any moves to throw my not-archnemesis out, did I, oh boyfriend of mine?” Tony tried to stifle the rest of his chuckles as he reached for the eggnog, tipping it up in Thor’s direction. “Merry fucking Christmas.”
“Just leave me here to
“Yeah, babe?” The genius turned on the steps, looking down at the super-soldier with a raised brow. Steve only blinked at him, jutting his bottom lip out in a childish pout. Tony’s head tilted forward as his lips curled up in a smile, and he descended a few steps to reach him again.

probably didn’t even know Tony loved holidays. It had been incredibly subtle the first couple of years, when he would nonchalantly leave presents for the team on Thanksgiving and Christmas, and even Valentine’s once. Steve realized the showering of gifts was really just how Tony showed his appreciation.
No one was ejected.
Steve wandered around the multiple floors of the weirdly diamond-shaped museum for hours, moving up from the first-floor courtyards to the upper-level cultural exhibits on anthropology. There were a handful of locals and other tourists that meandered between the galleries. Steve spotted a few attendees strolling around in suits and ties, fancy dresses. (Two stories below, a Philippine company was hosting a fundraising gala to celebrate their latest partnership with Stark Industries.)
“I haven’t seen you this stressed since we—” Tony stifled a laugh when Steve practically jumped out of his skin as he entered the room, eyes so wide he looked crazed. Apologetically, Tony said, “Sorry. Didn’t mean to scare you.”
~*~*~*~
Steve felt like a live wire as he stood at the counter, playing and replaying Tony’s words in his head like a broken record. His eyes flickered to Tony’s door involuntary as he considered his options: Follow or not to follow. It was an invitation, right? Or, on the other hand, perhaps he was still just reading too far into—
The first time he realised his boyfriend was kinda acting kind of off was when, about a month before, Steve dismissed one of the Avengers’ bonding nights, saying he had some paperwork to go through, and even if that was true, everyone in the Avengers Tower and their mothers knew how much Steve valued those movie nights and how he made sure that everyone was there and had fun. So when he walked away from the living room, all of the Avengers shared a worried look and Tony more than anyone wanted to go after him and make sure he was okay, but he knew Steve needed his space. And, in the following day, no one thought much of it anymore, considering that Cap was his normal self, up before anyone and already, sweaty from his early run, making breakfast for everyone.
Then, there was Tony.
Trick-or-Treat Challenge - F3: Sharing a Blanket
fucking sorry.”
Just kissed him, unprompted. A quick peck of the lips that still managed to steal his breath away somehow. Tony’s cheeks burned as he stuttered, “That wasn’t… I-I, um, well… I was reaching for the… d-door…”
“Yeah, Steve, sorry, I know,” he muttered distractedly, returning his focus to the table hologram. He used a stylus and his free hand to reorient a digital blueprint for what was presumably a new Iron Man design. Tony stole a glance in Steve’s direction, eyes moving over his body. “I’ll be up in a few.”
“Wasn’t me,” Sam hummed, pursing his lips as he looked at the others seated at the table with him. Wanda and Bucky both shrugged, mumbling a half-hearted
“FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941.” Tony opened the case and set it down on the conference table, revealing two fountain pens. “Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.”
Tony peeked an eye at him, raising an eyebrow. Steve leaned forward on his forearms, craning his neck to press a chaste kiss to Tony’s mouth. A pleasant sensation settled in his chest as he continued to pepper short kisses against his lips, feeling Tony’s pout melt away into a cheeky grin.
Tony cut him off with a humorless laugh, shaking his head. “God, if only everyone had your unbridled optimism. It’s kind of sickening, you know that?”
Tony had to take a moment to recover before returning the smile. “I’ll tell him right now,” he replied, saying a quick goodbye to Sharon Carter. He set his phone down before rummaging through a drawer in his large desk. To his boyfriend, he said, “Stevie, I have a surprise for you.”

“What are you naming my goddaughter?” Pepper asked, laying back into the pillows with a soft smile on her lips.
“Huh?” Tony flattened his hair out a bit more, taking a second to let the question sink in. “Oh. I flew the suit when I realized I was going to be late. But I was anyway, and I just –” He took a deep breath, setting the menu down, and then smiled when his eyes met Steve’s. “Thank you for waiting,” he said sincerely.
Steve’s eyes widened at that, mouth going slack upon hearing the words pass the other’s lips. But a broad grin replaced his expression, and Tony saw the joy reach his blue eyes. He whispered, “That’s the first time you’ve ever said that to me.”

“What are you doing?” Tony asked, voice tight when Steve walked close in front of him. Steve’s only response was to cup Tony’s face and place a close-mouthed kiss to his forehead, lingering for a few heartbeats before tugging Tony into a tight embrace.

and a choked groan, incapable of hiding the wince on his face. Steve was grinning above him and looking like a fucking Adonis – blond hair gone rogue and skin glowing with a light sheen of sweat. He couldn’t move even if he wanted to, trapped with Steve’s knees on either side of him.
Steve let out a spluttering chuckle, caught slightly off-guard. “I didn’t think of that, but… would you be mad if I still said ‘yes’?”
together. They shared showers and nightly pillow talks, which both men looked forward to at the end of every day. When Steve and Sam started jetting off in search of Bucky Barnes, those little pockets of intimacy became smaller. The only things that didn’t change were the kisses. Whether coming or going, they were given without thinking twice, and its warmed Tony’s heart every single time. Steve never failed to punctuate their days of separation with them.
“I think we really vibe, Steve,” Tony confessed, shaking his head as if in disbelief.
Steve sucked on his teeth as he walked up behind Tony, draping his arms over his shoulders and leaning his chin on top of his head. “You said that hours ago, when I asked the first time.”

“Oh-ho. Keep that up and maybe I’ll—”
“Stevie?” Tony called, making Steve’s whole chest warm up at the use of his nickname. He walked to the threshold of his bedroom, shirtless now, with a sly smile tugging at the corners of his lips. Steve’s breath caught in his throat when Tony blatantly gave him a onceover. “You comin’?”
“Fine, fine. Petey Pie, let’s not call our teachers ‘old farts’, okay? It’s not nice.”

“You’ll only get yourself hurt,” Steve growled out, his frown tugging his lips lower. For a moment, Tony thought he was going to up and leave, but the look on his face changed. He looked… sad. Resigned. Steve’s eyes shifted from shooting daggers to pleading with him. “I…
“Any chance people will get over this sooner than later?” Tony asks once they finished recounting what he’s missed since then.
“It’s considered rude to keep a lady waiting,” Steve remarks innocently.
“Let me stop you there,” Tony cuts in emphatically. At Steve’s surprised blink, the engineer flushes slightly, but he resolutely adds, “I mean — it makes sense that you feel, or think, that you don’t. Because you weren’t even born in this era. God knows what

“Collate all the data you have on Tony’s brain and send it to me,” Bruce pronounces, his movements a little jerky as he quickly puts all the medical supplies back in his bag. He shoves his glasses up his nose as he continues, “Oh, and can you create a graph or chart listing the important points of his brain’s activity? It’s possible that there’s a correlation to these shivering episodes Tony’s experiencing versus the normal ones. I just, the whole picture’s not there yet but oh man, JARVIS, if we can map it out from the beginning and work our way backwards then we’ll finally be able to have the answers we’re —”
“Back-up arrived several minutes ago and clean-up on 36th street is well underway,” JARVIS announces. “As Mr. Odinson reported earlier, there’s only one Leviathan remaining.”
Pepper continues. “Tony turned into himself, became self-destructive. He didn’t eat, he didn’t sleep. He drank himself into a stupor and stayed at his workshop most of the time. Whenever I checked up on him, he was either drunk or hungover. The few times I managed to gain access to his mansion and coax him out of his workshop, he looked like he did when I saw him earlier. Lost and miserable. Detached, in the sort of way that one is overwhelmed with their emotions that it reached the point that everything’s just numb. But despite all that, he was still getting work done, because at the end of the day, we still have a business to run.”
“Would you not think about yourself for one
Steve let a chuckle roll through him, smiling into the top of his husband’s hair. “Am I not allowed to think?”

“So,” Tony started, taking in a deep breath. “Am I going to find out why you’ve turned into a Capsicle and have been giving everyone the cold shoulder, or do I have to pull out the puppy-dog eyes, huh?”
“The prodigal son returns!” Tony crowed when he caught sight of Steve, raising his mug in greeting.
“What?” Steve squawked, turning to look at Tony incredulously. “How is me shaving my face ‘breaking our vows’?” he asked, raising both hands to use air-quotes.
“Space changes a man,” Tony teased, one corner of his mouth quirking up in a smirk.
“Okay.” Steve shifted them both, rolling onto his back and hauling Tony on top of him, effectively trapping them in the blanket like the fillings of a properly rolled burrito. Tony’s weight on him was solid and warm, and their legs tangled together, comfortable and familiar.

The rest of that afternoon went by in a pleasurable, sweaty blur. It was afterwards, when Steve and Tony were both sore, sticky messes, that they settled into exchanging lazy kisses, exploring kisses, tangled together in sweat-soaked sheets in a room that reeked of sex. Neither of them seemed to care too much, wanting only to keep physical contact with another human being. Tony left, eventually, when his phone rang and pulled him away from Steve. In the quiet of his room, Steve silently stared at the ceiling with his heart thudding loudly in his chest and a pleasing ache seeping into his bones.
“I – hate – you.”
“Oh, yeah?” Steve hummed, his throat tightening.
Tony stood in the doorframe, his jaw clenching and unclenching as two heads whipped in his direction. The grip Tony had on his leather jacket was so tight that he could almost hear it strain in his grasp.
was nothing. For a super-soldier like him, maybe it was.
Things had already turned tense between them, considering Howard and Maria’s death anniversary was fast approaching. Tony had his own way of coping, and Steve knew that. He wasn’t sure what it was, whether it was because Tony revealed how much he missed his mother or how much indifference he felt towards his father. It managed to pull at the guilt that Steve had tried to hide away, ever since he had started digging into the Winter Soldier’s (and in essence, Bucky’s) activities over the last seventy years.

Steve pressed his face against Tony’s neck, his lips brushing against warm skin as he finally replied, “Learning how to love you better.”

With a dismissive wave of his hand, Tony said, “Good lookin’ out, Cap. If you would be a dear and let Fury –”
Steve shrugged one shoulder, looking down at Morgan with a doting expression. “None at all. Out like a light.”
Tony still couldn’t wrap his mind around how Thor’s magic hammer shtick worked – it had to be some weird fingerprint technology embedded; there was no other explanation. Not for anyone’s lack of trying, but no one had been able to nudge the stupid thing sitting on the coffee table, not even him and Rhodey, who’d grabbed a gauntlet each to try and get some lift.
Steve made a noise of consideration, tugging Tony even closer. “Yeah? Can I accept your offer up in our suite, heart?”
“A good one?” Fury inquired.
“Oh, come on –”

into their kiss. Albeit short, fleeting, and risky, this would be the only time they had and it was worth every second.
Relief flooded through him. Steve inhaled sharply, squeezing his hand. Tony shifted in bed, and then his face was pressed against Steve’s back, his arm going around him in a hug. “I’m sorry,” Steve said wetly, only just realizing that hot tears had started running sideways on his face.
“You trust me?” Steve repeated, eyes flickering up to look directly into Tony’s.
“How did you get this?” Steve asked, voice so small that Tony barely caught it.
Sam’s eyes widened dramatically, and he leaned forward. “Steve, quit playing.”

Steve ran towards Tony, moving with a kind of haste brought out only from the apprehension under his skin.

Subject: Re: I AM SO SORRY
Steve observed Tony’s silhouette against the dim lights of their room, thanks to the automatic adjustments by FRIDAY. He pushed himself to rest on his arm, grasping Tony’s hand with the other. Steve pressed a kiss inside the palm of Tony’s hand, trailing more along the skin of his wrist all the way up to his bare shoulder. With half-lidded eyes, Steve matched Tony’s gaze, offering a soft smile. “C’mere.”
Steve snorted a laugh, rolling his eyes as he opened a cupboard to grab his own mug. “Prodigy of none, you dork.”

“Steve…” Tony peeked his head out from under the covers, eyes red with tears but a smile tugging on his mouth. “Thank you.”

for him. He was gone on Steve Rogers, and he couldn’t have had it any other way. And much to Tony’s surprise, he and Steve were apparently on the exact same page.
“Y’know, back in my day, we weren’t so good about being open like that,” Steve said under his breath. “Love like that stayed behind closed doors, but now… I’m really glad it’s different.” He turned then, meeting Tony’s stare. The air between them felt immediately charged.
“I resent that.” Tony pulled his hand away with a scoff, getting to his feet. He shoved his hands into the pockets of his slacks, adding, “Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.”
~*~*~*~
Steve woke up feeling extremely warm, and it wasn’t until he blinked his eyes open that he realized why: He was tucked against Tony’s side as they lay on the sofa. Tony had an arm around his shoulders and was absentmindedly drawing invisible patterns on his arm. There was a distinctly warm color of afternoon light filtering in through the blinds, and he figured he must have fallen asleep while watching the television.
“Yeah, he’s had back-to-back meetings all afternoon.” Steve made his way back to his seat, swiping up his phone before turning back to Peter. “Can you help me with something right quick?”
It was an accident. Steve had forgotten to lock the door to his bedroom, which in retrospect was his own fault. He was man enough to admit that, at least. Tony ended up walking in on Steve who had his boxers down around his ankles, his shirt tucked under his chin, his bedsheets bunched past his knees, and his hand wrapped firmly around his dick. There was a buzzing underneath Steve’s skin that either resulted from the ebbing orgasm or from Tony’s dark eyes raking over him, he couldn’t be sure. They stared at each other for much too long to be normal — but what was

As for Prince Peter, he is the heir of the Collins-Carbonell line, the only son of Carbonell’s King Anthony, 53, and his late wife, Duchess Mary of Parker. Sources close to the royal family cite that the King’s current husband, Duke Steven of Rogers, 41, has been supportive of his son’s choice in choosing Storm’s hand in marriage.

Steve snorted out a laugh, sliding his hands over Tony’s hips to pull him close enough to rest his forehead against Tony’s shoulder. “

He sure did sound like it. Steve sighed in exasperation, turning around to face an apologetic-looking Tony. “I’m not mad,” he said again, softer now, moving to sit up just like Tony was. “Honestly, I’m just –”
Truly, the real proof that Tony had a heart was evidenced by the people standing around them at the small dock on the lakeside cabin. It was his family mourning for him — Steve and Rhodey and Pepper, Happy and Thor and Bruce and Clint — and the new people with them who’d stayed to honor the man who sacrificed himself to save… to save everyone but himself.
Good luck with the rest of your PhD program, too! I know you’ll knock their socks off.
That was it, then. Tony left his drink to the high table that they all stood around, fixing his cufflinks and straightening out his suit. “I’m gonna go save him,” he announced, plastering on a wide smile as he made his way across the room. When he stepped beside Steve and placed a comforting hand to the small of his back, he felt the tension in Steve’s body ease away under his palm.
“You’re drooling. It’s weird.”

Thor’s voice thundered above them all as the Norse god got to his feet, a thin-lipped smile stretching across his mouth. “So! Mer of Ham,” he said mockingly, causing Tony to snort, “I’m curious to know. How did you and our dear Anthony cross paths?”
His boyfriend must have noticed the concern etched on his features, because Tony was cupping Steve’s face between his hands in the next moment. “Hey, hey,” he reassured, “whatever it is going through your head right now, forget about it. We’re okay. You trust me?”
He spent a solid fifteen minutes responding to comments and overthinking every little thing about his and Tony’s relationship before a text from Sam pulled at his attention. Steve jumped out of bed, quickly changed into his gym clothes, and then slipped out of their apartment for his usual morning run.

“But it’s why I don’t want to see you gone. We need you, Steve.
Tony’s shifting in bed had woken Steve up. The bed dipped just enough to roll Steve forward, and he blinked sleepily in the dark, reaching an arm out to rub comforting circles at the small of his husband’s back. “Hey… ‘nother nightmare?” Steve slurred out, his voice still sounding rough from disuse.
Steve pursed his mouth in consideration, shrugging. “Dunno. Maybe you can tell me about what really happened in Tennessee since you and Tony had
“I was, what, twelve?” Tony said, raising a brow. “Your Papa was pushing seventy-five, eighty—”
“You’re not gonna — that was a foul if I ever saw one!” Bucky got up in the ref’s face, staggering back in surprise when she shoved against his chest. They kept yelling at each other, and it wasn’t until Morgan came up to him and started to drag him by the hand away from the referee that the others found the wherewithal to leave their umbrellas behind to grab Bucky before things got worse.
Mjölnir tells him gently.
“You should probably head back to bed, Tony,” Steve says gently. “What time is it, anyway?”
No. That’s a lie. He’s felt that way before. A long, long time ago. In a galaxy far away —
“What about my other back-up suits? I have a ton of them, don’t I?”
“What other hammer do you speak of, Clinton? I only have the one which is in Tony’s grasp.”
Tony snorts, and he’s smirking at Steve as he replies, “What makes you think I didn’t time that perfectly, Rogers?”
But upon waking up from the ice 70 years later and being made aware of the harsh reality that every single person he ever knew or cared about were either dead or dying, Steve can take comfort in the fact that living with five other people who he can count on to have his back whenever they’re called to assemble to fight the good fight would do that to you.
Together, they exit the workshop to enter the elevator that’s waiting for them, courtesy of JARVIS. They’re silent as the cable starts to ascend to the common area, shoulders touching and hands clasped tightly between them.
He feels satisfaction roll off of him in waves when he catches sight of Steve’s face turning a lovely shade of pink. But the blond man is grinning broadly at Tony that twin dimples appear on his cheeks, and the engineer can’t help but swoon a little at the captivated look Steve’s giving him.
Yet, when it came to one Steven Grant Rogers, he’s at a complete and utter loss.

Before he knows it, 36th street is cleared of all civilians and Tony finds himself circling back to 34th to get to the portal. If there’s a way that he could close it before more of those Leviathan ships could enter, then all the better.
After all, he has a date to plan and a man to woo.
“Yeah, don’t we know it," Rhodey scoffs.
“The song, it’s perfect,” Tony answers. He casts a glance a Steve, but Steve’s already looking at him so he doesn’t miss the bashful expression on the engineer’s face when he says, “For this kind of night. So fucking cliché, too. Middle of the night, walking along the filthy but quiet streets of the city that never sleeps after consuming an unhealthy amount of sugar at the local diner.”
Jarvis glances at Tony from the corner of his eye, an impish smile gracing his face as he answers, “I’m not omniscient, sir, but I’m certain whatever is meant to happen will happen.”
“You haven’t been to your workshop since you woke up,” the redhead remarks conversationally with a raised brow. “Why is that?”
By this point, he knows he’s grappling for answers to what may be the reason for his teammate’s current frame of mind, and Steve hopes against hope that Bruce will have a more concrete answer to their current predicament soon.
Like the flip of a switch, Tony’s expression turns sour, his mouth twisting into a sharp smile while his eyes harden in anger. The words that escape his mouth are like a punch to the gut as he hisses them at Steve.
them has turned the super soldier’s world around.
All of a sudden, JARVIS’ voice interrupts whatever Steve was about to say.
“God fucking damn it, Thor,” Tony enunciates with an irritated sigh.
If you don’t have anything else on your schedule, why don’t you take a shower and sleep early?
. But every time he finds himself in the gym with the war-hammer, the sentient being distracting him from his self-destructive thoughts by training him on how to best utilize her in a fight, Tony almost always ends up thinking that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. That one day, he’s going to wake up and feel less like the man he’s been most of his life and start to feel more like the person he wants and strives to become.
Disabling JARVIS was no trouble at all, although stepping into his lab for the first time since his accident was pretty tough. Guilt and shame still courses through Tony as he remembers the protests JARVIS voiced the entire time he input the codes to temporarily shut down his AI. But it had to be done, a part of Tony thinks. If he hadn’t done, then JARVIS would’ve alerted Steve and the others of Tony’s scheme. Then he never would’ve had the chance to step outside his Tower.
“Oh my God, I almost forgot about that,” Clint gasps, eyes wide as he slaps a hand to his forehead.
“That sounds like a good plan, Thor,” Steve acknowledges with a grateful nod towards the Asgardian prince. Turning to Bruce, the super soldier adds, “But Bruce, that still doesn’t explain Tony’s behavior earlier. He was… not exactly himself. I mean, that couldn’t have been him, though. Right?”
“Well, I guess I should hit the sack now.”

“Nearly eight hours. I did warn you about the ventilation in your room, sir,” his AI adds in an ‘I told you so’ way, to which the engineer responds with a huff of breath.

Steve turns to look at Bruce in time to see the scientist open his mouth, only to close it again with a stunned expression.
“Yet you still haven’t learned your lesson,” the super soldier retorts with a raised brow.
“Are you alright?” Steve asks quietly.
Steve looks around his team, his
“You are worthy, my friend,” he states in a matter-of-fact tone. He lets those words sink in first before he continues. “After all, it is only prudent that you also learn how to handle Mjölnir in a fight.”
Tony Stark doesn’t normally thank people. When he does, it’s usually said with sarcasm or in an offhanded manner. So what the hell was that?
“All of them?!” Tony gasps in shock. What the hell? How does he not have a back-up suit?
Bruce adds, “Thank you for trusting us enough to.”
“Hey, Rhodes. I’m in Tony’s lab.”
He feels Steve smile against his lips, and Tony doesn’t hesitate to open his mouth for Steve to press his tongue against his.
“Tony, are you okay? You’re worrying me a bit here,” Steve asks, trailing his hand from Tony’s elbow to his forearm and squeezing it lightly.
“Anything I can do to help, then?”
With a jolt, Tony opens and closes his mouth like a goldfish as he struggles to respond.
Without preamble, Pepper clicks “ENTER” on the window and then speaks in a clear, concise voice:
Steve swallows hard and offers him a reassuring smile.
“Yes. It’s a two-step authentication Tony developed a while back. If JARVIS is disabled and something happens to Tony and he’s unable to get access to do it himself, it’s only Rhodey and I
Thor glances at them with amusement. When a minute passes and nobody has spoken a word, the Asgardian huffs out in exasperation before setting Mjölnir down on top of a StarkPad. Steve knows that Thor is aware that Tony will react negatively to it because
. I’m so proud of you, baby.”
“I was wondering,” he starts nervously. “I mean, that is if you’re interested. You can say no, of course, and I’d completely understand if you’re not — I mean. Uh, do you wanna have dinner with— with me? Sometime this week? Or whenever your schedule allows. But, yeah. Dinner? Just us?”
“Yeah?” Steve breathes out, heart hammering against his ribcage.
Suddenly, Tony blinks twice, and he jerks in surprise before he closes the fridge at last. Puzzled, the engineer looks over his shoulder to see Steve looking at him with a concerned expression.
“Tough luck there, soldier.”
A deep, long-suffering sigh. “Clint.”
Sometime Around Midnight - The Airborne Toxic Event
“How would you know?!”
Tony is?” Bruce asks mildly. “He’s asleep. In his bed. The most he can do is sleepwalk, and according to JARVIS he doesn’t do that either.”
One moment, the creature is talking and is raising the weapon. And the next, it’s lying on the ground with a gaping hole on its chest.
Before she knows it, two things happen at once. One — the upturned vehicles exploded, thus destroying the bots closest to Natasha, but she was also caught in the crossfire. So when she feels something hit her leg, and when she feels her bones break, she’s unable to fight off a scream. Second — one moment she’s flying through the air and the next she registers Iron Man’s arms wrapped around her frame before they both tumble to the ground in a graceless heap.
“Excuse me, may I join you, young man?”
“What did it — she — say?” Curiosity peaked, Bruce leans against the table, giving his complete attention to Tony, the engineer absentmindedly fiddling with the alien weapon.
Well, there’s a first time for everything, right?
When Natasha walks past Tony, she lightly brushes her fingers on Tony’s clean-shaven cheek and kisses it. Before she pulls away, Steve hears her whisper, “I’m glad you got home safe and sound, Antoshka.”
Clearing his throat, Steve fights down a blush — for God’s sake, it’s a damn drink, he shouldn’t be this flushed! — as he quickly stammers out, “It’s just hot cocoa.”
There’s a pause before the AI responds. “Yes, Captain. His vitals show that it’s 1.5 degrees lower than the last scan Dr. Banner did.”
“Prideful?” He guesses.
Bruce continues as he points a finger to the graph projected on the screen.
“I will. I promise.” Tony nods emphatically.
The reason for Steve’s astonishment is the view of Peter and
Sure, he’s a genius and the best in his field, but even Tony knows he’s not that special.
Tony frowns slightly at the archer, and he replies with an uneasy, “It was fine.”
Tony shrugs.
“Though they are… disappointed, they are not furious. They are, in fact, mostly relieved.”
They started drinking at around nine, first with a few bottles of Russian vodka, then slowly adding tequila and sake and whiskey as the night dragged. It was probably around past three in the morning when they stopped, and the last thing Tony remembered was giggling like a schoolgirl at Thor as Natasha drunkenly applies make-up on the Asgardian prince. His memories of last night’s shenanigans are a bit of a blur, especially after they started taking tequila shots and Tony lost count after he took his tenth.
“Cap, please tell me you have a parachute with you this time,” Tony nearly begs. Super soldier or not, he’d rather not see his boyfriend turn into a pancake.
Holy shit, Tony thinks. Well, looks like that opportunity has come, even if that means he has to steal Thor’s thunder. No pun intended.
“He what?” Steve asks —
Actions speak louder than words, after all, so the ex-Russian spy deciding to help train Tony in hand-to-hand combat and not bringing up the enormous elephant in the room even once is a feat in and of itself.
There’s a short pause.
“Sir?” he distantly hears JARVIS’ voice, the worry apparent in the AI’s tone.
Steve’s birthday is coming up in a week and the engineer still hasn’t thought of what to gift the super soldier. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. How utterly preposterous, yes — no need to rub it in. Tony, for all the wealth he has and the genius-level intellect he possesses, he’s still unable to come up with
That… kinda sounds a lot like depression, Steve thinks. And it seems that Bruce is thinking along the same lines because the physicist is frowning at Tony.
Steve punches in the code and waits for the sliding doors to open before he walks in to collect Tony and Peter in time for dinner. He only makes it two steps into the lab when he stops in shock because of two things.
Natasha, who takes her place on the armchair adjacent to Steve’s position on the couch, raises an eyebrow at the super soldier, who sighs.
“Thanos stole me when I was young. I was his weapon, nothing more. I only wish to have killed him sooner. I tried and was captured. That was when I went to Titan. I followed him, do you know that failure for an assassin makes you the most pointless being in the universe? I do. He made sure I would never forget.” Clouded by her hatred, she flexes her arm. Tony sees the sinews of metal and cords.
He’ll call them tomorrow. Later. Whenever. Tony Stark might actually be a coward after all.
Ok, so it’s not really a good secret if he keeps telling people, however he doesn’t really fancy another fly through a rough area.
“So you knew! The whole time you knew we were going to lose!?” Tony all but screams into the musty papers, swaying and almost losing his balance. He’s still losing blood, again, right.
Hearing the rustle of her fabric as she turns, Steve looks over his shoulder to Natasha. Her shoulders slump and she lets out a breath.
In the same moment, the politicians arrive and the people explode into violence. Bottles are being thrown, bodyguards doing their best to shield the clients from the fray. More desperately this time, Tony yanks causing Harley to slip down the bonnet of the car to his feet.
It takes him a while to process what the Wizard had implied. Like every apocalypse movie he’s ever seen, it’s rarely the threat itself that brings humanity to it’s knees – it’s human beings themselves, rabid dogs turning on one another until there’s nothing human left at all. Still, there might be pockets of people who believe in the Avengers. All it takes is a little faith.
“Gone, like the others.” He pauses, barely whispering the next part, “I should be dead.”
“Sorry I as-“
It continues like this for hours, various people coming and going. Steve is never there. From the brief flashes where he does make an appearance, his face is haggard with tension and fatigue. The suit he was wearing is gone, replaced with some loose-fitting one piece in muted cream colours. He is filled by the desire to hold that idiot by the shoulders and tell him to get some sleep. He wishes he could earn Steve’s forgiveness, to be treated as a friend again. More than anything he wants to hug him and cry his heart out. He’d hold his hand as Steve cried for Bucky, rub his back as he choked on the tears.
“It wasn’t judgement, Guardian, simply an observation.”
Shameless God Of War references, and hey look, a new character to interact with everyone! This has taken a turn I didn't expect with this story so I'm excited to see how this plays out.
He glares at the panel he’s found in his hands, gripping it so tightly he can see the screen begin to invert. This isn’t how his whole ‘go back in time and save the world, again’ plan was supposed to go. There has to be a way for him to be better, he’s so sick of repeating his mistakes. Not that he is ready to dive into that rabbit hole.
“Straight ahead of you, Guardian, standing on a car at the front.”
Steve’s body is tense, his shoulders hard set and his brow creased in a defined displeased line.
In the midst of his breakdown, he shivers. Not because it’s cold, no, the planet is actually pretty hospitable and lucky him, because he hadn’t really prepared the nanotech to deal with lack of oxygen or unknown variables of this kind. He shivers because Thanos, destroyer of worlds and genocidal maniac, knew him. By name. Tony Stark. This Titan, warlord, bigot, respected Tony Stark.
“Jesus, Tony, we thought you were dead! What the hell happened to you?!” Relief, that’s what the voice sounds like.
Logically, too, Vision will remain dead along with Gamora, basically anyone who was involved with the possession of a stone. He can imagine the rips in the fabric of time and space the extensive amount of ‘ctrl-z’ he’ll be doing will create. He should probably talk to Bruce about that. Or Thor. Also, how is he going to get into space in the first place? He hasn’t got a clue.
“Nothing, but knowing Barton that could be good or bad. I’m actually heading out, tomorrow, to look for him.”
If he’s going to do this, he’ll do it with the appropriate amount of absurdity and nostalgia. Just like the first time, he’s going to relearn how to fly; using his brain to send the correct messages is going to be a struggle but learning to control and have them come to life around his feet at the same time, well, it’s going to be interesting to say the least. The flying part he’s confident on, and his clammy hands grasp the side of the worktop as the same rush of equal part exhilaration and anticipation for the smacking of his limbs on the marble floor courses through him.
He clears his throat. It’s ‘Stark’, is it. He supposes the literal apocalypse wouldn’t be enough to mend the bridges he’d destroyed with his friend.
They weren’t friends – not anymore. Perhaps that’s why this particular cold sweat is bothering him the most. No matter the situation between them, Steve didn’t want Tony dead. When he saw the news, he was angry at Tony, with Tony, because the man has about as much regard for his own safety as a pistachio shell. He wanted Tony to be a team player to stop him from recklessly and needlessly putting himself in danger, then putting everyone else in danger trying to help Tony. It’s infuriating. Tony is infuriating.
“Ghost, Sir, we met briefly earlier after you finished my programming.”
Part of him was still processing what had just happened. Peter was crying and hugging him,
“Good, that’s great. We should, um.” He took a moment to breathe; for all the panic and self-hatred that was swirling in his system, he was an engineer. And engineers fixed things. “Earth. We need to go to Earth.”
“Ok, you’re a total badass and I get it but me,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony what the hell is going on?” Steve's voice suddenly booms back into his life.
His eyes wander to the elaborate computer system that has been set up at the end of the table. Thanks to Shuri, they actually get to keep an eye on him. Not that Tony gets to know that. She said it was only fair seeing as he technically spied on them first. Steve pulls a chair out, moving closer to the screen, with his elbows balanced on his knees. Tony is standing by his workstation (not the one in the Tower, which leads Steve to wonder where in the world Tony
Where is he?
!?” His fist slams on the crisp laminated surface, making a sickening crack. The strenuous movement stretches all of his healing wounds, making him bow forward. He shakes his head to himself, showing Harley
Tony laughed bitterly at that.
Harley explores the bedroom for a minute before following him into the workshop, looking slightly lost and in wonder all at the same time.
He’d absolutely forgotten he had been talking to Steve earlier. Had he been waiting there the whole time?
“I’ll take you to Earth.”
“Wow I wasn’t expecting it to be some fucked up episode of Jerry Springer, but here we are,” He gets out of his chair, wobbling on his first steps because if he thought he was in excruciating pain immediately after the fight, everything had settled into bone deep ache at this point. His vision was blacking in and out, not that Nebula noticed, and he leaned on the chair for a minute to collect himself again. “Are you injured, your robot self? Is it damaged?”
The Winter Soldier is dead. Why doesn’t he feel anything for justice for his parents? He’d tried to kill the man himself. But there’s nothing. No relief, no weight taken from his shoulders. He’s completely stunned to silence, his fingers twitching restlessly at his tablet. Maybe it’s the broken sound of defeat coming from Steve. Maybe it’s the fact that deep down he hadn’t really wanted to kill Bucky, he knew it wasn’t really his fault. He was a weapon being used by Hydra. He should have done more to help Steve.
“Build, I can do that.” He nods, to himself, “Ghost lock those files-“
“I’m sorry,” He says sincerely, because he is. There are so many dead across the world but to lose all these people so close to home... Superhero or not, he’s allowed to mourn his losses too.
Dummy whirs off with a happy chirp and roll of wheels. He takes the scalpel that was next to the cup and twiddles with it.
The kid’s trance breaks (thank god, because Tony is so not good at this whole Dad thing), and he seems once again interested to investigate the panels and flick through some of the books littering the ground.
“I’m sure Wakanda could use Captain America for a while longer,” He hedges.
The irony in that fact. Sure, he had people who would be willing to set aside their past grievances and perhaps even act happy to see him alive; kidding himself that they would be truly glad to see him was a fallacy he wouldn’t allow himself. No, he needs to focus on figuring out where Thanos is, and how exactly he’s going to pry that glove from his fingers. There’s also a migraine and broken bones to sort out along the way.
“I must get back to the Sanctum,” Wong declares, once Tony is finished.
“Huh,” He says out loud, not entirely expecting it to work at all, “G, everything going ok?”
He threw it at the wall as soon as his conversation with Bruce ended. Why did Tony have to be so damn prideful? Look at what it had cost him, cost
This train of thought wasn’t exactly soothing his irregular heartbeat, and he forces himself to look away from the man he doesn’t even recognise anymore.
“Yeah, I know.”
She chuckled darkly, “I’ve survived worse.”
“Harley don’t touch that,” Ghost growls, startling him from where he was poking around in Tony’s equipment.
Her lip curves up in a half smile. Tony considers it a miraculous win.
he. Tony, if he’s being truly honest with himself and he rarely is, was done. He gave Thanos all he had; all his little tricks, his advancements, let him use his head like a punching bag. When Thanos turned that knife against him and Tony felt the sickening crunch of it scraping across bone, that intense heat as his blood began to seep from him, coughed as the punctured lung started taking liquid, he was ready to die.
“Tony.”
He’s surprised to see that Steve’s body seems to slump further into itself.
“Your arm first, shall we?”
He keeps watching her this time, not exactly thrilled about the idea of someone going awol. She’s a big girl and could kill Tony with her pinky, but he worries, because if she’s not in Wakanda, and Clint’s god knows where, who is watching her back? Obviously, he will be. Sometimes he wishes Ghost was a direct link in his head, so that he could get the hell on with finding a way to track her already.
He wants to call, to talk to Rhodey, or Banner, even Natasha was worth hoping for. But they never stay in the room long, always busy, always moving. He feels useless to assist in their struggles, and only thinking that he’ll annoy them or get in their way, he never does it.
Tony doesn’t realise he’s crying, his calloused hands pawing at his face uselessly. Thor has changed a lot since he’d last seen him – more than physically – he was more humble, open to others in ways he’s never seen in a God. He’s got a shared pain… Perhaps Loki is dead too. And Tony has got to stop empathising with psychopaths because, damnit, his eyes sting at the thought of Loki dying for real.
Leaving the towel discarded on the floor Tony slips into a pair of tracksuit bottoms and top from the drawers in the bedroom. What Ghost had said buzzed in his head. This Shuri is smart, smarter than him, he’ll need to be more cautious with his surveillance on his friends. Also, had he lost weight? The shirt certainly felt looser than he remembered his clothes being.
She lands in the deserted area he’ll now call home, unknown to her is that she's practically standing on top of his building. He'd utilized some of the helicarrier tech, the reflective panels and such - not that Nebula needed to know that. Her eyes scan their surroundings, calculated and unconvinced. As quick as his failing body will let him, he gets his equipment off her ship. He’s sweating profusely by the end, breathing hard because he’s working with a lung and a bit.
Natasha leaves and Steve roams his eyes around Tony’s workshop for a sign of another person living with him. No one. Fuck, Steve thinks. Tony lost… There is no sign of Pepper either. He feels his heart tear in his chest; he owes him a decent apology.
“Of course.”
His hand involuntarily fists his shirt where the remaining chassis for his nanobots crumbles beneath his palms. There’s blood everywhere, but the cauterisation of his side is holding up well enough. He frowns.
; he wouldn’t have a clue. It is an unwelcome series of thoughts, because without his panic and his fears what does he have left? The only thing he has for certain is his brain, and of course Ghost couldn’t do it alone. The fact that Dummy was in on it too, his closest friend, stings more than it should. Building robots with the ability to learn is a gift and a curse; especially when their software learns from a particularly bad role model. He takes a moment, trying to listen to his AI like he wouldn’t a close friend.
“Fine, Ghost show me the quickest route home.” He begins to escape the mass of people, thankful that, besides Harley, everyone seems to be more interested in the politics than in his bad disguise of himself.
Wong talks animatedly about the Infinity Stones while Tony reads.
The building is empty and Pepper isn't there. He sighs, nervous, she might have gone home. That sounded reasonable enough to Tony's overworked brain. A ghost town: that's what he’s been dropped into and despite being used to the feeling, he’s never truly been encompassed by loneliness like this. He picks up Dummy, a couple of tablets and laptops. The schematics for the nanotech along with some of his prototypes for the next stage, which he dumps into a box too. Dragging the best of his tools, in the first toolbox he’d ever owned (he can be sentimental, people just assume the worst in him) he manages to get all his equipment back to the ship.
He pulls the screen back towards him. There was a massive amount of data that he could review, ship stats and logs, current temperature and planetary units. He yawns and wipes at his eyes with his free hand. He can do this, he has to be able to do this.
Tony screamed loudly, making all of them except Nat jump. He was crying too, great sobs that convulsed his unconscious body once more. Part of Steve thought this is what Tony Stark dying looked like, or maybe the brainwashing Bucky was subjected to.
Here’s the problem: Harley’s there. You remember Harley, right? Because Tony sure as hell does. Faux sweet, innocent looking kid with the tongue of a viper and a mass of curly hair? He’s in trouble. Or he's about to be in trouble. These types of show downs usually end up bloody; the idea of that kid from  Tennessee being stuck in the middle... He doesn't dare dwell on it. Tony’s heart thumps with a sense of hope that he’s even alive – regrettably, he has no real plan of what to do with him once he gets there. He also has no idea why Harley is in New York; maybe he does, and he doesn’t enjoy the narrative his imagination implies.
Thank you all for your comments and for reading! I hope you enjoy this chapter, I'll edit the mistakes at some point... Let me know what you think (: (Also my headcannon about Thor and Rocket might turn into fanart at some point, I'll update this box if I add it)
“I don’t blame you if you didn’t notice,” His external walls were starting to rebuild themselves, he could be the coldest son of a bitch if he wanted to be, “I’m kinda in the middle of keyhole surgery-“
Nebula was silent, to the point where Tony was starting to worry about her being unconscious in the driver’s seat.
Tony is drowsy. The sensation is throwing him for a loop, and he’s sure that Ghost is still talking but he’s not understanding him properly. It’s getting dark again; the alarm going off in his head is sluggish, the ice-cold fear faltering in his veins. He’s out of time.
Tony’s stomach drops.
do this, but if he can get an AI up and running while wholly delirious then who knows… He might just pull this off.
. He was just a kid. Tony would give anything to take his place. He’d been so busy comprehending that Peter was just ash on his sleeves and under his fingernails from where he’d been gripping him so tightly, that when everyone else started to similarly combust, he was consumed by a numbness rather than grief.
Thanos - 1
The tightness in his chest hasn’t lessened. His heart feels caged beneath his ribs, beating a cacophony against the bone. He rubs a distracted hand along the scar of the arc reactor; wondering for the one thousandth time whether the doctors did indeed remove all of the shrapnel. Every lungful of air is a tremendous effort, more so than usual. Breathing an uneasy sigh, his attention refocuses to the room around him instead of the display.
Gauntlets.
Nebula waits while he gathers his things. It’s like a dream or a movie, the streets vacant and stores closed. He tries to be careful with his steps but inwardly he cringes, he's walking on what's left of people. It's enough to make him want to gag. The screens are not filled with adverts but an immediate press release from the White House. The whole city is much more desolate than he remembers. Bleak. Sad.
His right boot sputters, cutting off suddenly and haphazardly spurring into life in the same breath.
“What the hell!” Tony yells, holding the small knife in the air. “Jarvis?”
“I’ve been trying to keep everyone together,” Steve laughs, humourlessly, “But everyone has someone to look for, or something to go back to… Without Buck, I, it’s just me.”
“Small rabbit,” Thor said, low and reassuring, “We’ve hardly had the time for me to say that I am sorry you now share my burden.”
“Come
“I do not know, the gauntlet itself does not feature much in the literature.”
Thank you all so much for reading! And of course for the lovely comments and all the kudos, I love you all umu
Tony peaks through his fingers to look at him. He looks so much older than that scruffy kid who let him hide out in his garage.
She looked away, her expression pained for a moment.
Frantically, he claws his shirt off - suddenly his clothes are too tight, the room too close and the air too claustrophobic. Behind his eyelids he sees Thanos’ cruel smile, and he can smell the ash in his nostrils. He gets his trousers off and starts the shower behind him, his hands shaking so violently he clasps them together. The breath he takes is simultaneously too deep and not deep enough, his brain searching all of the exercises he knows to try calm himself down.
None of it means anything to Steve, obviously. Tony must have fucked up the last good thing he had in his life; now all he has is Dummy and his AI.
It’s just a shoe rack, that’s all. Peter’s Converse All Star’s are on the first shelf, then Pepper’s heels and it sends shockwaves through Tony’s whole being. The visceral scream that is ripped from him doesn’t sound human. The carpet on the ground is hard beneath Tony’s knees, dusted in a fine white film.
He was looking at his tablet with abject curiosity. He’d really created Ghost and wasn’t hallucinating. Incredible.
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve is standing up, imploring him with those stupid, perfect, eyes.
His lower legs might as well be on fire. It lasts for a full minute before he gives a frustrated thump on the counter. Climbing up so that he’s standing on the table, he winces at the strains on his lower leg muscles and wriggles his toes. It makes him feel nauseas and he’s never had vertigo until now. He throws off the uneasy sensation and jumps off the edge with the expected amount of grace (none at all).
“I’m not part of their ‘team’,” She even air quotes, which would have been hilarious if the pit of Tony’s stomach hadn’t just dropped out, “I don’t have anyone.”
He leans forward, pitching at the ache in his face and chest and practically in every nerve of his body. He wonders how long he’s been sitting there, surrounded by the ashes of the boy he wished he’d never gotten involved with. Glancing over, he sees the girl kicking around at the dust of the planet. Just casually shuffling what’s probably Stardick or Strange or Blue Hulk… For all her composure she looks just as lost as Tony feels.
In the reflection he takes a moment to assess his body. It’s a bad idea. The scars stand out angry and red against his skin, proof of his failures. Reminders that he
Tony sits there, his heart beginning to jackhammer in his chest. His coffee was spiked and he didn’t even notice. He’s been so exhausted and mentally drained that he would have gladly accepted a drink containing
He kept a careful eye on all the major channels and who was fighting in who’s corner. It was only a matter of time before someone decided to drag the rest of his team into this, and he needed to start on a contingency plan for them too. The Avengers are going to want to come home at some point, he’ll need to take the heat for this colossal fuck up. It’s not as though it’s difficult for him to fall into his old stereotype (there’s one, just for him) and take the public eye like a magpie to a shiny watch. Perhaps a publicity stunt, or a statement on behalf of the Avengers. He could clear up some bad blood between them, too.
Also for those of you who don't know who the voice of Ghost is, watch this, Chris is amazing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWwvR6cSH4o
Let it be known that Tony Stark is no coward.
) he decides to cauterise the wound again. It hurts just as much as the first time and the area around it is blistered and red.
“Captain fuckin’ obvious up there Ghost, just shut up for a minute,” he mutters, pulling the shirt down.
A scream startles him. His hand rests over the scar, where his arc reactor used to give him comforting warmth, it used to remind him exactly what he can make out of an awful situation. The anxiety is still there, in the back of his mind, whispering sour nothings into his ears. Frustrated with himself, he clamps his hands over his ears.
“Excuse me?” He turns to her, her expression is still guarded but he can see it now, the damage he hadn’t before. The limp to her leg, the splintered chunk on her stomach.
It’s like owning a pet, Tony thinks. A pet with more complex needs and free will, but he lives with Dummy, how hard can it really be?
He ruffles his hair in the towel to avoid the silence.
A few more whirrs and scuffs of wheels, and Dummy is safely out of the way.
“Why?”
He’d already been to the previews and the extended cut to that one – he can hardly believe he let it come true.
He went from dismantling remotes and radios to building cars in leaps and bounds. It didn’t matter to Howard, though. The Super Soldier was still missing. The only thing Tony could have actually done right in his eyes was find Steve himself – then, he supposed, the rush of emotion in Howard’s eyes would be directed at Cap and not him, as he once again would drift into the background.
“Oh wow, Stark. You’re alive.”
Tony rolls his eyes – exactly what he needs to add to his list of problems, teenage rebellion in all it’s glory. He takes a proper look at Harley, from the hoody that sits too big on his shoulders, to his sunken eyes that keep glancing back to the group still protesting on top of the car. He decides to use the dirtiest tactic in the book of Bad Parenting 101 - indifference.
It’s a cop out and he knows it. He can’t even keep eye contact with the man, coughing awkwardly and looking seriously back to his tablet. The biological nanobots he’d accidently invented were currently in the process of stitching the lining of his lung back together. The pain should be unbearable, but something about the whole situation is giving his pain receptors something else to focus on.
“It’s been said, once or twice,” Tony picks up an ancient looking horn from the table he’s standing next to, needing something to keep his hands busy while his mind paces through this, “Thanks for the beam up by the way, how did you know where I was?”
“They’re good people. I’m sure they’d welcome you. Plus, if you didn’t care about any of your people, you wouldn’t be taking me in the first place.”
After contemplating the idea of him and Steve, Tony turns to his workbench, pulling a panel towards him. Loading up an extensive amount of code, he starts to put some adjustments into the bots. He also brings up the old schematics for his arc reactor. The power source needs to be sustainable and containable, and to create one that’s slightly smaller than the arc reactor seems like a good place to start. It’ll also act as a red herring, because people will assume that it’s his life source and not the core for his new suit.
Grunting, he moves the chair a bit closer to Tony on the screen.
Besides crawling through the legs of the people in front, Tony makes it to the apex of the crowd, and now that he can see Harley taller and ganglier,
He can tell Harley wants to comment on the fact there’s nothing but a sheer rock face in front of them; he rolls his eyes and lifts up his sunglasses to scan himself on the facial recognition software. The cliff splits and Harley makes a small gasp of surprise.
“Why were you calling me Sir earlier Ghost?”
ACDC starts blaring through his speakers.
Because that’s all Tony Stark is. He’s a brain, he’s useful. Of course Steve doesn’t care about him on a personal level; only Tony allowed himself to get mixed up in that bag of emotions. Just because Tony is currently stealing glances at him, checking that he’s the same Captain America that he’d left (now with a beard, which is doing all sorts of weird things to Tony’s stomach besides the bleeding).
“Fine, but you’re not off the hook. Oh, but you can start by making yourself useful by looking for Mr Wong.”
On cue, Dummy rushes over with a screech and the pair of pliers that had got thrown across the room when he’d knocked the tray beside Tony. Fondly, he pats his head and takes the pliers. His body still aches, like he’d slept with someone hammering at him with a crowbar all night. Predictably, Ghost had warned him, the wound on his stomach had gotten infected too. So, he’s got constant nausea and drugs filtering through his system, and a persistent sting every time he moves. He deserves it though, this is his atonement.
“Of course.”
Grabbing his sleeve, Tony yanks. Hard.
Rhodey for his part, bless him, sat there tirelessly listening throughout without speaking a word. He added some when Tony couldn’t continue, filling in what had happened in Wakanda. How Steve had gone to protect Vision, stopping Thanos’s gauntlet with his bare hand. The fact that Wanda somehow found the strength to destroy Vision’s stone
He doesn’t have to get any closer than he is to know it’s the remains of her.
The stinging rises and he gasps out, forcing himself to fight through the pain; nothing happens. He grunts, clearing his mind again. He used to have an amazing mind palace, unfortunately situations of late have left him jumbled and disorganised.
“I’m going to have to do this myself, aren’t I?” He asks no one in particular, lifting his shirt and testing the blade against his skin.
Hi there! Things are finally starting to come together, and I'm pretty happy with it for once. Please leave any comments or suggestions, I really appreciate every single one :)
Boots.
The punch to his gut makes him wheeze. He can feel it right through his stitches and into his gaping spleen. There were a lot of them now, and sure he could fly out of there but suppose one of them takes a repulsor beam to the face. Whatever way Tony pictures this, it doesn’t end well in his favour. It rarely does, these days.
Tony cusses. That sounds like Harley alright.
“Woah!” He hears Harley exclaim and is instantly on edge.
Cursed.
Captain America, had called him out and said that when it came down to it, he wouldn’t lay down on the wire for the sake of others. As though Tony could be
“Wizard buddy!” Tony beams, not even watching as the portal closes behind him as he’s pulled across the gap. He’s standing in Strange’s office, it doesn’t look any different from the last time he was here before… Before all this hell started.
“Can’t a man enjoy a shower? And it’s just a name G you don’t have to take it so literally.” He doesn’t want to think about the game, the one Peter showed him in their rare bonding times his Aunt’s. He felt sick just thinking about the prospect of this planet
Tony’s words freeze in his mouth, his whole body changing from desperate to be talking to Steve at last, to near enough Iron Man.
“For all her brilliance Tony, you’d love her,” Rhodey finishes, “There’s just too much damage. She’s been taken out of the frying pan and thrown into the proverbial fucking sun.”
“Who says I’m going with you?”
He shouldn’t really be pushing her, one of these shiny buttons is probably to ‘evacuate your nearest nuisance’. Absently, he wonders how fast they must be flying, and the fact that there is no air resistance or disturbance inside the ship; the pressure and physics of space continue to overwhelm him. Mars. He’s Tony Stark and his inflight experience is watching actual planets roll past his window.
self-centred. Sure, he’s not a soldier. He can’t imagine being a part of a battalion, a comrade, going into a war unequivocally knowing that you and your friends may not be coming home. Entering a war, with that in mind, must be a harrowing experience for a coward.
Pretending not to hear, Tony grumbles resolutely to himself. He’s not hiding, he’s just taking some time to decompress.
… besides the rhythm of
And oh, Tony does not like the smile on the boy’s face as he said it. These are just broken children, and by the sounds of it the Avengers have just ascended to Number One on America’s Most Hated List. Not that their despise is unwarranted, mind, however on top of everything else it’s another blow to his crippled self-worth. He also doesn’t want to start beating on random children, so he decides it’s better to just leave and let them –
Poking around Fury’s files back in the day lead him to all sorts of interesting information, including that of Peter Quill. He was drunk at the time though, and the memory flitters back to him on a passing whim. Guardians, there were five of them. He’d not seen antenna girl, or Nebula, so maybe Quill was expanding his band.
He jumps over fallen trees, dodges under finger shaped branches and collapses nearly as fast as he’d begun. The tears start in desperation, he’s doesn’t know where to find her. Hell, he doesn’t know where
Something nudges him awake. It’s a piece of driftwood. Tony is here with his lonely piece of driftwood and not a care in the world. He feverishly grins into the harsh surface. It scrapes against his cheek, the texture feeling so real and yet so far away, like he’s experiencing it through someone else’s body.
Thor was standing by the window, his shadow casting into Rocket’s light. He froze, near imperceptibly if Tony wasn’t zooming his view in to focus on these two unlikely friends.
Tony is slumped across his workstation. The hole in his lung is proving to be a, how should we say, major system failure. He’s not entirely sure he
in Steve’s ears) staring at panels covered in all sorts of nonsense. He’s pacing; lips poised in thought; hands running through his hair; Dummy hovering beside him. Tony is limping too, his body tight when he moves at a certain angle and thick bandages visible under his shirt.
Not a question this time, thanks Natasha. That means she’s alive. The bile that’s been settling in his throat eases a bit. Banner and Natasha, that’s a start.
“Yes. Now if you’re really going to do this surgery would you please allow me to run the tests before you cut yourself with-“
He stabs a finger in Harley’s direction, turning to the metal brackets and computers behind him.
“Natasha left, a couple of days ago.”
He takes a set of pliers from the bench beside him.
of his foot. Or his whole foot has become the embodiment of TV static. Quickly brandishing a couple of swears, he cuts and jabs the needle into the other foot as well. Awful stinging begins to rise up his leg and he starts to panic (although Ghost doesn’t say anything) he can thankfully tell after a few moments that they’re moving back down towards his ankle.
of everything he does. Tony who is ridiculously witty and continuously runs rings around him with his sharp mind and sparkling eyes; who takes the serious things seriously and everything else in his stride; who makes it his personal mission to go against Steve at every possible move.
“We’re not, not exactly. But the world’s kinda a mess right now huh, so why can’t Captain America and Iron Man be friends?”
It’s the worst attack he’s had in a long time. Immobilising, but not unexpected. Arms braced on his knees, he stares at the tainted water until it finally runs clear. He stays there a while longer, finding solace in the grey tiles beneath his feet, in the fact that he can breathe with a semblance of somewhat normal.
He doesn’t look back at them.
He tries to stop the biological impulse to breathe, pointing his hands down to shoot the repulsers and get him the hell out of there… But nothing happens. Renewed confusion brings his shaking palms to his face, the blurry outlines shadowy in front of him. He’s not in his armour. He’s not in his armour and he’s in water and oh, oh – Tony Stark is dying.
It’s a conclusion that hit Steve like a shield to the chest. It had occurred to him previously, the future when Steve woke up held a lot of possibilities and Tony was one of them. Incredible. More importantly, Tony didn’t put him on a pedestal. He treated Steve like they’d been bickering for years, not like Steve had missed the last seventy of them. It slammed him into oblivion, while living in the Avengers Tower with the team. They had a home. He was almost whole – for a time before finding out Bucky was
Screw all of that God mumbojumbo (the irony that he is personally very close with a God, and has enough evidence to say that Gods, as a whole, exist, isn’t lost on him) with those stones you have everything you need to mess with the universe at a fundamental level. You don’t even have to be a God. I mean certainly, Thanos’ species had an advantage over a comparatively weak body like Tony, but there are no rules here. Thanos’ was just the first guy to think of and succeed in collecting all the stones at once.
Back in his thin 3 day old t-shirt and sweatpants, Tony takes off in the direction of trouble.
“Because, asshat, whether I like it or not I’m the one who has got to fix this mess. And you, well, you have a ship.” He was already stumbling towards her, doing his best not to look back to what was left of Peter, to his pile of vomit, to the dirt encrusted with his blood and tears.
“What?!” Steve’s head whips round.
Tony takes a couple of the books in one hand, it is getting late and he has things to do; stuff to process, more data to gather.
He’s not sure how long it will take but at this point is afraid to ask. Nebula, she’d offered over a glance of her shoulder before stalking off away from the battlefields, was her name. Her company has been amiable at best; he doesn’t particularly want to turn this into an episode from a cheap TV show where he’s constantly saying ‘are we there yet?’
Since Howard died, and Obidiah royally screwed him over, Tony made the conscious choice to only let himself be the master of his own destiny. Harry Potter can shove his little underhand move right back down his own snarky throat.
Captain America – war hero, fossil, legend – is back in the country. Not to mention the God, a talking racoon, an assassin and the Hulk. It’d do no one any favours to get them back on US soil, he’s working on fixing that, though. No, it’s safer for them to be in Wakanda. They can do good in Wakanda; there’s safety in Superhero numbers.
“No Rhodey, much as everyone else I suppose, not great but alive. So there’s that I guess.”
hold Thanos back long enough to do so; until Thanos had undone all their struggle with a twist of his wrist. He spoke of the relief effort there in Wakanda, which is what they were assisting with, as well as worldwide. Shuri had reluctantly taken over her brother’s place, trying her best to control a broken Kingdom and a shattered world.
“Ghost what did you show him?”
He was poking far too close to the open wound that will never close inside Tony. Not until he fixes this, fixes them.
“Ok Ghost, I don’t have any kind of anaesthetic so we’re doing this the old-fashioned way.”
However, he’s fought in battles, threw himself in front of targets to save others. Became a superhero. Hell, he even took the hardest pitch when Thanos threw a moon at him for fucksake. How much closer to the line does he have to be? He and Steve disagreed on a lot of things. Tony’s attitude, his lack of teamwork, his tendency to do something without going through the chain of command. Whether it was the journey on what had been a pleasant day of blissful ignorance, or the whole moon thing, or surviving the apocalypse entirely… He’s long past caring what other people think of him; anything else he can make up for in quick wit.
“It’s from the game you named me after, isn’t it? And you were ignoring me. I will do what I must, Guardian.”
data from the Mark 47, though I don’t think you’re ready for that just yet.”
“Jesus,” Tony says, pulling his sunglasses out of his pocket and scanning the crowd. No one seems to have noticed him yet, after all his beard has grown out and he’s in his plain black gym gear. “See him Ghost?”
He wiped his sleeve across his face, likely only making it dirtier.
He needs to get out of here.
“Wanda, Vision, Sam, T’Challa, all gone.” Steve interrupts again, his eyes misting over with sadness that Tony sees because of the way his voice had choked, “And Bucky. I guess you got what you wanted.”
He stabilises in the air, drifting slowly down.
All the way along his left peck, the mutilation that Steve’s shield left behind sears in his mind. The feeling of strength and anger and hatred that the good Captain had channelled as he pummelled Tony’s suit leaves him with goose bumps. His skin tingles with the phantom rip of flesh as his armour had cut into him with each swipe. The stitches on his stomach have congealed blood around them, making him wonder why he didn’t just cauterise it again. On his face were large purple bruises, cuts that lead in varying depths down his neck and frankly covering most of his form.
Despite all the ways he had tried to distance himself from his father, Wanda’s vision inserts itself into the forefront of his mind. All of his friends, dead. The life he’d built with them – ruined. And it’s not just a horrifying possibility anymore. It’s his reality and just like Howard he dragged everyone he ever loved down with him.
Walking through the streets of Wakanda is quiet, nothing close to the noise of New York. People are around but they keep to themselves, busy with mourning or rebuilding. The dust catches in the wind and breezes past his face, it reminds him of old warehouses and abandoned lots. It’s not a fond memory.
Plus, he’s not sure on what the whole Governmental situation looks like but he can take a pretty good guess. It’s likely chaos, and no one will want to deal with whether or not
“Mr Wong is alive and still in New York,” He says, calm as ever, “I was also able to recover
“Oh yeah, how long have a got until it becomes a real issue?” Tony says, shifting his posture to be as aerodynamic as humanly possible.
But, he had a point before his mind slithered to that horrible tangent. A point… He has to use Thanos’ gloating to his advantage. That, and Thanos must not under any single circumstance close his fist.
Not Tony, though, he grew with it, encouraged it, taunted his exhausted brain especially when he was exhausted because he had to be better. Improve, adapt and change; his tech and his brain have been his only constants throughout his entire life. His only thank you to his Dad was for the opportunities his less than desirable parenting and company that he’d been left with.
He’s a genius, which is accurate, and he’s built more machines (both correctly and incorrectly, but in his opinion if something doesn’t go wrong
Harley withdraws at that, like a blow had hit him square in the chest.
Weeks could have passed and he’d never have noticed. His stomach aches, from his wounds or from hunger. Dummy is holding a cup out to him, arm turning gently to entice him. He nearly catches himself laughing at the absurdity of it, his only living companion is a sentient robotic arm. He takes the cup and checks it for liquid, and it surprisingly has coffee inside. Downing it in gulps, he wipes his lips; staring at his worktop properly for the first time.
He takes a deep breath of Earth’s air. It’s familiar and different all at once. It’s cleaner than on Titan, with hints of Nitrogen and smog. There’s something new too, heavy and bitter on his tongue.
“What about you C-3PNO,” He deflects, looking away from the illuminated screen, “That can’t have been all of your people, Guardians of the Galaxy… Sounds like a tacky band name.”
By this point Harley has stopped walking; his fists are tensed angrily at his sides, his cheeks brushed with a slight red where he’s trying to hold himself back.
Tony closes his eyes, trying to will his boots off.
Steve is hopelessly in love with the man.
“Nope, Ghost,” he grins, “I’m actually busy.”
“It’s good that you’re alive, we could use your help,” Steve finally says, and if that isn’t the lowest blow of all.
The progress otherwise had been slow going; there had been set backs thrown at him left right and centre.
Rocket, the talking space racoon, spent a lot of time to begin with perched atop the oversized table. Dissembling and reassembling his gun, his gaze unfocused and lingering on something outside, Tony had sat cursed to watch this creature mourn his friends. Although Tony felt as though he’d lost everything, everyone, his team were still there. Alive. The creature seemed to understand the gravity of not hearing anything from his crew. He knew he was alone; trapped on Earth, with nowhere to go and no one to be consoled by. The guilt that Tony felt was almost as bad as the grief.
Avengers - 0
There’s an Anti Avengers protest and ho-boy, is it a big one. There are Pro Avengers groups, and of course not-so-friendly-towards-Avengers groups showing up. From what Ghost had briefly filled him in on, some politicians were trying to rework the accords and get it through congress, to protect the now scattered heroes left. Endearing, certainly, but not something Tony would normally make an effort to show up to.
“I have completed the checks on the latest iteration of the nanobots,” Ghost growls. Tony is more or less used to his general demeanour now, and the low rumble is both comforting and somewhat assertive at the same time. Like a strong Dad – or how Tony imagines a Dad would be. His experience was fairly limited, after all. It’s also hilarious to get Ghost to say ridiculous things because of the depth of his voice. In the hours he spent scouring books, he had Ghost read countless nursery rhymes to keep him amused.
The only reason Stark industries is still a company was because of Pepper. Sure, Tony was the engineer behind it all, but the only difference between him and an overzealous guy in a garage was someone else taking care of the internal affairs. He even gave up War Machine to keep the Government out. He never did trust Nick Fury, either.
“Hey, hey kid,” He flicks his sunglasses down his nose, pulling Harley round by the shoulders to face him, “It’s me, the Mechanic, remember?”
There is a lot that he leaves out. Blank spaces in the story, things Rhodey doesn’t need to know, he looks like he’s dealing with enough at the moment anyway.
It was the reason Howard hated him so much, Tony continues fiddling with the pliers, creating figure eights and loops with his fingers, consumed by the pivotal memory of his father. Howard’s life became finding Captain America. Maybe he did truly like him, Tony didn’t know. All the can think of is the business man that ran that overactive brain; his golden goose slammed into ice with the serum that could have made him millions. He hates thinking about Steve like that; Steve only had good things to say about his Da. Nobody knew what it was like to live with the man, be looked down on by the man, be told whenever he decided to show up that he would never be half the man Steve Rogers was.
He feels the vomit rise before he leans unceremoniously to the side to spew his fancy breakfast with Pepper next to him. Pepper. Poor sweet Pepper who always seemed to be clinging to the idea that Tony could be normal. That he could be a superhero and a husband. She was just as delusional as he is. Idly, he wonders if she’s alive. The nausea creeps back up on him, shortly followed by a cold and overwhelming anger.
He startles awake.
“And the kid?”
He doesn’t know.
He can’t remember the last time he slept. It feels like a never-ending blur, with the days conjoining into an unyielding stretch of his mental capabilities. The wound on his chest has started to heal properly now, with bending not seeming to cost him a few hours off his life. The skin still looks infected, an angry pulsing red, but it’s not exuding puss or anything so he’s not too worried. He’s walked off worse. Or maybe he hasn’t, he’s lay in four feet of snow resigned to succumb to the numbness of his injuries, trapped in his own suit.
“Let’s go see what Wong has for us, hm?” He attaches his faceplate, relieved that the comms and GPS is working properly. He’s not in a full suit, but it wasn’t like he was going into battle.
Blood was everywhere and Tony’s slumped body was twitching on the worktop. A gaping hole in his stomach nearly had Steve pushing the others out of the way to get to the screen. His first reaction was that he was recreating his time in Afghanistan, putting an arc reactor back in… He’s not convinced the truth is much better.
“Guardian,” Ghost growls.
Shoes, he thinks.
The loss of Pepper brings him to his knees in a clearing. The ground is still scorched, evidence of the fire that had been. And there in the centre-
. Steve knew that he should have called sooner; two years on the run had been hell. He was grateful for Sam and Nat because without them, he may have lost the will entirely. And then there was Bucky. He chokes on his inhale at the thought of his best friend. He’d lost him so many times, but like a bungee he’d somehow always managed to drag him back to his side. Until Wakanda. Until Thanos. Until Tony dove head first into another alien spaceship with absolutely no thought to his
“You scared the shit outta me Tone, honest to God when I saw you fly to that ship on the news I-“
