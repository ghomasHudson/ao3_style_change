Even half asleep Tony wasn’t falling for Steve’s promise so easily. He tilted his head back far enough to give him a long-suffering look. “Don’t you mean, you’ll come with me
, but I’m trying to get some new stuff going. Director of ‘branding,’ basically, has opened up, and if I can prove to my boss—who loves me, by the way, that’s very important—that I can write for men
“Alright: fifty times,” Steve changed his mind as Tony complained again. “Keep talking, Tony, this is only getting better on my end.”
“There’s nobody coming, so keep your foot on the break and change the gear to drive,” Tony said slowly as Steve followed every instruction very carefully. “Then ease your foot off the break slowly… and pull out.”
The first thing they saw as they pulled up to the house was Maria, standing on the porch with her arms crossed over her chest.
“Not why I said it, sweetheart,” he promised, pressing a soft, lingering kiss to Tony’s lips. “Maybe another time.”
“For the record,” Steve murmured softly, sarcastic at first but soon gentling his voice. “Even if I was into that, you’re the one I can’t stop thinking about, Tony. Not Thor, or anyone else.”
Without warning, Tony felt the world slow down to a leisurely crawl. People around them faded into the background until only Rachel and Steve were walking beside him, and Rachel’s otherwise sprinting sentences ran slower than molasses as she ate up Steve’s entire body with her gaze and with a suggestive little smile, she clarified, “Anything
“You could?” he whispered with trembling words that had sounded much more suave in his head. “What scene is that, Tony?”
So while Tony lived out one of his dreams in the bowels of CERN’s hadron collider, Steve wandered the streets of Geneva, occupying himself easily in art galleries and hikes around city. As averse to the trip as Steve had been initially, he really seemed to know how to fill his time. Even the language didn’t get in his way. Of course Tony knew Steve studied French, but he nearly squirmed out of his seat with excitement on their first dinner out when Steve effortlessly spoke to their waiter in French.
“This isn’t spooky,” Tony mumbled in disagreement, and he yawned loudly enough to interrupt himself. “Can’t you feel it?” he asked after a moment, his voice heavy with sleep. “We’re safe here… we’re safe.”
“Only a few more rounds, my pet,” Steve promised, coming around to fold a dark, heavy cloth over Tony’s eyes. “Close your eyes.”
There were strict rules against the sharing of hormones in the human world, especially on duty. But Steve knew how to get the job done without opening his mouth. He let his eyes slip shut, and instead let Tony’s soft breaths, grasping fingers, and the twitching, instinctive jerks of his hips guide his movement. Unhurried, and ever so tender, Steve nuzzled up the length of Tony’s cock as it grew thicker and firmer. Tony cried out, and his hips stuttered up helplessly, desperate for friction, and Steve took immediate advantage then to press the blunt head of the canister back against the rim of his hole. This time, it took less force to ease it in, and in return, Tony eagerly squeezed around in, drawing it in deeper to his body.
Steve had told Tony to be as bold with his demands and as rough with his mouth as he wished. At the time, Tony hadn’t known about Steve’s fantasy of being used for sex—for someone to see him as nothing more than a cock for someone’s anonymous, meaningless fuck. Instead, Tony had been cautious, and only risked a few tentative tugs of Steve’s hair. A good top was hard to find, and Tony didn’t want to scare him off.
Tony couldn’t help but smile to himself. “Don’t worry about me, babe, just call me when you’re on your way.”
Steve took Tony’s hand in his own and gave it a gentle squeeze. “Tony,” he said in a firm, patient voice. “Take a breath. You’re overthinking it. I just want to know if you’re a nervous flier or not.”
“No… no, you’re right. Guess he’s more resilient than I expected,” Tony mused to himself, working through the problem Bruce had pointed out. “We’re—I don’t know what we’re doing tomorrow, but he’s weird about PDA, like no—no disrupting the peace. Hates bad attention. Think that’s how I’ll get him.”
Steve blinked in surprise; he couldn’t believe she’d acknowledged they even had a party! “What? I love costume parties!”
Steve stared back at him like a deer in headlights, and his surprise was enough to have Tony laughing.
The big black dragon closed her big, red eyes, and with a long, final sigh, a bright purple light glowed bright from within the breast of the dragon until it gradually turned into a bright, blinding white light that enveloped it’s massive body entirely.
“I’m not going anywhere, sweetheart,” Steve promised him, rubbing his hands up and down Tony’s back gently in the warm water, doing his best to offer him comfort after such long days. Tony’s frame was thinner than usual, and something ugly twisted in Steve’s gut at the thought. If Tony had missed days worth of time, when was the last time he ate? Had he been hunched over his desk or his benches all that time without taking care of himself?
He buttoned on a blue silk vest that had been fitted to within an inch of its life, then tied the matching pants and kimono over it. The dark navy material felt durable and well made, and he threw a couple of punches to see how well it moved with him.
Bucky had been there when Steve had fought his way behind enemy lines to find out what happened to his father. He’d been there when they had been too late.
“Let me in!” a male voice was shouting from the other side of his front door. “I know you’re in there, let me in! I’ll DIE!”
“I expected a lot of things to happen after three weeks apart,” Tony mused between a string of playful, feather-light kisses he brushed across Steve’s nose, jaw, and his lips. “Cuddling on a couch fully dressed never crossed my mind.”
Tony’s smile stretched into a pleased grin, but he couldn’t let flattery distract him now. “You’re being pretty self-centered here, if you haven’t noticed. You’re assuming that because I’m the first man you’ve been with that you won’t know how to satisfy me,” Tony summarized without judgment, watching Steve’s expression for clues that he’d guessed wrong.
Clint frowned, looking back at Steve over his shoulder with a confused grimace. “That’s pretty messed up,” he wryly pointed out before turning back to what he was doing, throwing a couple of sausages on first. “You ever take a holiday?”
Steve smiled and shook his head. “Veterinarian, actually,” he said with a smile. “But after I learned about Mary Ellen McCormack and the SPCA, I got curious about law, so I ended up with a minor in government.”
“Right, that’s reasonable,” Steve agreed in a distracted tone, clearly worrying over a whole other issue now that the first one was solved.
“I did, too,” Steve said in a stilted tone, and Tony frowned at Thor and Bruce immediately. The two of them were only looking back at him, wide-eyed, and struggling to keep themselves quiet. “Actually, that’s sort of why I was calling. I have tickets to the Rangers game tonight, and, I know it is short notice, but I was wondering if you would like to join me.”
This had already gone on too long, and despite his extensive training and veteran experience, Steve was at the end of his self-restraint. While Tony nuzzled and moaned into his neck, Steve draped his heavy arm over Tony’s body to cup the full, round cheeks of his ass in each hand. He rolled them so he lay on his back with Tony snuffling on top of him, and finally free to indulge in his long-standing curiosity, he treated himself to spreading Tony’s ass and kneading the meat of his ass, exploring the different ways he could make Tony’s soft panting hitch in irresistible, moaning sobs. Steve worked his way closer to his hole, inch for inch, until finally all he heard from his pet was hoarse, mumbling encouragement; as Tony instinctively spread his legs the closer Steve got to the crack of his ass, the more encouraged Steve was to reach forward with his slicked up fingers and press two, then three fingers forward to learn what that divine, warm body felt to inhabit.
Associate Bob Sitwell was waiting to receive them in the entrance hall to the New Yoresylvania Governor’s Compound.
“Fifteen minutes!” Steve cried, not sure if he should be howling with laughter or in outrage. “Who—what? Why would—”
They’d intentionally tried to maintain the everyday norms of their relationship even in the White House. Much of it had been an easy transition, but some change was inevitable. Before Tony became the 46th President to move into the Residence, Steve coveted the role of big spoon. Back then, the idea that one of the wealthiest, most intelligent men on the planet deferred to him for anything was overwhelming and deeply romantic. That was a responsibility he thought he couldn’t live without, being the man who Tony Stark trusted to keep him safe and cherished through the night.
“They are planning an educational lecture on your species at hir job,” Steve explained with quiet, careful words, only slightly out of breath as he rolled his hips, fucking Tony with slow and gentle thrusts to drag out the pleasure for his pet. “They have no males for their presentation.”
“That sounds strange to me, Stevie. I don’t know if I buy it. After all he and his mother went through, do you really think Bucky would endanger his own children? A good man would sooner cut off his own arm than hurt—”
“You should be,” she said over him. “They are highly competitive, you need to plan ahead. Build up the right experiences, and the right connections. Developing these connections takes time and investment, you have to demonstrate your character so people know you are reliable. A team player.”
“Yes,” Tony replied before Steve could get a word in; he watched Tony go through the process with a slow, measured sigh.
“Steve! My markers!” Tony suddenly cried, then looked right back at Chris. “How could—Steve, he got me markers for my birthday. Back on the set of Avengers, we’d see Steve doodling all the time. Anytime he’s not in a conversation, a meeting, or in front of the camera, he’d be attached to his sketchbook. And he’s phenomenal—”
Even now, he tried to take comfort in the possibility that this could all be something else. Maybe he’d simply been single and horny for so long his body was now confused. Not that it mattered
Steve fired back a series of rolling eye emojis before bracing himself for the last message waiting for him. He found a bench, sat down, and played the voicemail Tony had left twenty minutes earlier.
If Tony had any remaining concerns about how the night could go wrong, he was no longer able to communicate them. His lips were parted in silent wonder, and Steve kissed him soundly one last time before pulling away to help Tony to his feet. Wandering hands and kisses turned the short and simple walk to the front door into a whole procession, but finally Steve sent him off with the waiting driver and watched him go see a life-long dream come true.
“You look,” Steve started to say as he trailed after Tony like a duckling. His sentenced hung in the air between them, unfinished until he could think of an honest conclusion. You look hot? You look hotter than ever? Take me to bed or lose me forever?
an image that won’t haunt me forever,” Bruce said with a sigh of defeat while Tony continued his monologue.
He wouldn’t gasp, he wouldn’t jump. He wouldn’t give her the satisfaction of knowing she’d scared the living daylights out of him.
“She would tell you that she is in Wakanda visiting Shuri and that the King’s lifestyle is above the judgement of any subject.”
A little vein was making itself known to Steve whether he liked it or not. It throbbed, slow and mild at first, but it was quickly building to a robust, undeniable headache.
“Is, uh. Is the serum fading?” he asked without looking up from the documents. He couldn’t look at Tony, not now.
Some time passed, and eventually Sharon nudged him with her elbow. “Want me to step out so you can make your choices and pay in peace?”
There were too many bodies crowding around him, helping him and moving him. He wanted to reach for Steve, to hold his hand and to know he was safe, but the next time Tony opened his eyes, Steve was gone.
“The best one I’ve got,” Steve admitted with a self-deprecating laugh. “And what does that tell you about my priorities?”
“He said Jane worries about people taking her seriously. She’s young, she’s beautiful, but Thor often noticed people being uncomfortable or dismissive of her intelligence. He agrees with you that she’s fiercely intelligent, and he wouldn’t say that lightly. So,” Tony said after the summary of his and Thor’s conversation.
Eisenturm was the largest city in the kingdom, with nearly half a million citizens living in the city proper, and twice as many people commuting daily into the city. For Steve who grew up on a remote farm and rarely saw gatherings larger than a few hundred, the adjustment to life in Eisenturm had been difficult. Before their marriage, Steve lived in a two bedroom apartment he had shared with his mother in Fiorera, the capital of Terrini. He cooked his own breakfasts, he vacuumed his own floors, and more often than not, he did his own laundry. Moving from such comfortable independence to the gilded marble halls decorated with priceless artwork of centuries past took its toll on Steve.
“Happy is en route to your location,” Jarvis replied almost immediately, its volume appropriately modulated to library whispering. “ETA 36 minutes due to unexpected traffic.”
Tony waited until they were gone before turning to Steve. “You haven’t run away yet,” he noted, and the timid hope in his eyes easily told Steve he was only half-joking.
Steve frowned a little to himself, but it wasn’t like he could hide forever. When Tony cupped his cheek, he pressed into it gently, then opened his eyes to look up at Tony.
“I will,” Steve promised, pocketing the thumb drive and taking Tony’s card in hand. Tony Stark. “I really mean it, Tony. You’ve been a great help.”
With a sad grimace and a quiet huff of regret, Tony nodded. “I wish someone would pay me to put on 40 pounds of fat. I’d cook everything in lard and eat pancakes for dinner. With real maple syrup, too.”
Clint and Tony slept better on their return trip with Stephanie than ever before, safe and comforted by the surreal protection of a slumbering dragon.
Tony was balancing two boxes of large pizzas in one hand, and two padded carrier bags in the other. Without thinking, Steve rushed to take the bags from him and urged Tony to follow him in.
Steve thanked her and instinctively reached for his pocket to offer her a tip for her help, only to realize he didn’t have a pocket, and he had no cash. He floundered for a minute before thanking her again and hurrying away through the well-dressed, mingling crowd.
Steve blinked wildly at Tony’s unexpected words. The mellowing fog of alcohol started to clear as the gravity of the situation dawned on him.
“Finger her ass and finish her off,” Bond rasped, smirking to himself. “You made that car, Lucy, didn’t you?”
“Sure it is,” Tony drawled, patting and rubbing Steve’s side in consolation. “Ready for Diagon Alley?”
Steve could practically see Tony rolling his eyes when he pushed his hips back and snapped at him. “If you don’t give me that cock in the next second, Steve, I swear to fucking god—”
Tony choked on air. Before he knew it, laughter spluttered out of him in intermittent bursts of embarrassed giggling and genuine snickering. Marple sprung back up and wagged and tap-danced beside him, sharing in his happiness -
Steve had been happy for him, but Steve had never called back. It had been months, and still Steve hadn’t called. Tony should be angry. He should be irritated that Steve hadn’t recognized the clear pattern of calling responsibility, but even he knew it didn’t matter. Did Steve not understand that, too? Tony would forgive Steve for anything if Steve would just call.
Tony couldn’t resist opening the pen up and peeking in to marvel at the sleek interior. “Is that a fucking laser?”
“What would make you happier, Stark?” Steve asked when Tony put down his empty glass of ice cubes. “Sartorial range is my middle name. Dumb lumberjack? Dumb jock? Dumb construction—”
Bundled up as he was, Steve couldn’t see much of Tony besides the thick, dark brown hair, and a small glimpse of his face where he had stuck his nose out from between the blankets to breathe. How similar they were to their targets, Steve mused to himself as he concentrated his efforts into warming up the space around them. While he waited, he tore open a fresh pack of protective gloves and rolled them down over his hands with care. If he played it right, this one would be a walk in the park.
“It sounds like things are going well, then, so… can we assume these rumors that you’re engaged might be real?” Stephen prompted mildly, and Tony’s grin softened into a private smile, which he smoothly covered with a smiling facade.
“Don’t worry, it gets better,” the woman told him then, and Steve found himself believing her. “Who else do you have?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Tony asked in a shrill voice, leaning away from Steve as if his suggestion was offensive. “Are you embarrassed by me, Steve?”
“Tony, you look so good I could lick you clean instead of letting you take a shower after the gym,” Steve drawled as he dropped his hands into his lap. “Can we figure out what’s going on first?”
“As tough as the story can be, it has been rewarding to bring it to—we just came from Palm Springs, where we saw the same ashen, drawn expressions on the audience. But it’s not just about the horror on the screen, it’s… I think the story is coming through and that people are seeing what we’re trying to do with it, and that has been deeply rewarding. Like you say, it is gritty and it is uncomfortable, but underneath that is the story of this group of people who are carving out hope in a hopeless world. Wait, no; that almost sounded pleasant,” he said with a quiet, helpless laugh. “It isn’t pleasant, at all. But it is a profound story of the lengths people go to execute their salvation.”
With those words, he spun Tony to face the other way, and before Tony really knew what was happening, Steve had cleared off a corner of the workstation with a sweep of his arm. He lifted and bent Tony over the countertop, leaving Tony scrambling on the balls of his feet while Steve knelt behind him and pulled down Tony’s harem pants.
“Damn. That’s rough,” Steve said quietly, not sure what sounded worse - getting your dick chopped off, or an existence where you wanted to have children without ever seeing them.
“And you won’t try to sneak into the audience in a hoodie and sunglasses? Or surprise me in my dressing room? Or swap places with my driver and surprise me—”
It wasn’t long before Tony became Steve’s most prized door, a body whose youthful stamina and unresolved sexual needs helped Steve surpass his quota every week. Where most bodies seemed to plateau and tire over time, Tony grew more responsive to Steve’s touch and to his voice. By the third week, Steve had gone as far as to bring a second canister on his regular visits to Tony’s door.
Tony was at Steve’s doorstep an hour after work that Friday. They had had many dates out in restaurants and museums and late-night shows, but in the last few weeks, their dates had been less about going out for an event, and more about each other.
“I couldn’t if I wanted to!” Tony burst out, to both his and Bruce’s surprise. After a brief pause of re-evaluating how they had arrived at this moment, Tony leaned in across the table. “He’s a fucking savant, Bruce—pun very much intended, and deserved,” he whispered in a rush, as if imparting a secret, gesturing wildly with his fork before attacking his food again as if that would help explain his meaning.
Stephanie stared at Tony with an agitated frown, as if she just couldn’t accept what he was saying. “But,” she started to say, but her voice trailed to silence almost immediately. Briefly, she glanced in the direction of her dragon, and when she looked back at Tony again, there was a clear resolution in her determined gaze.
“As you are,” Natasha said, and all the warriors rushing to the defense of their Chief froze where they stood. The Elder, who has turned in surprise to see what was happening behind her, was frozen as such, and even the Chief, with her own formidable reserves of magical power, could do nothing but kneel on the green and watch her betrothed climb to her feet.
Without thinking, he shoved Tony back into the wall with the full force of his body weight pinning him in place. He removed his hand from Tony’s lips and covered them instead with his own, eager and confident and ever so gentle, like they had the luxury of indulging in leisurely kisses and affection.
Tony grunted quietly and let go of Steve’s shoulders. His legs were so sore they could crumble any second, but this was too important. One careful step after another, and soon Tony led them out into Wayne’s office.
Miriam finished her story and the conversation naturally moved on, but Steve didn’t need to see more of the video after that. He closed his laptop up and pushed it aside as he rolled onto his back to settle in and give Tony his undivided attention.
“Sure, honey, I’ll try to remember that,” she said with her usual cheer, and none of the touching heartache she’d spouted seconds ago. “You just make sure you’re both here for dinner next Thursday at 5:30pm. He doesn’t have to bring a side-dish, but remind him that mama prefer reds to whites.”
“One year? One—oh. Okay,” Steve echoed numbly. It wasn’t impossible, was it? With technology being what it was, he could make it work; they could make it work. “Okay, well—that’s, that’s not ideal, but I can manage. I can handle everything from Toronto, with video conferencing, and—”
Except all Steve heard was his blind promise to turn down future opportunities for the sake of their relationship. What if they wanted Tony to stay at Quantico, or move to D.C.? If the FBI was what he really wanted, then Steve couldn’t be the reason Tony turned anything down. Even if Tony never grew to resent him, Steve would resent himself for holding back the man he loved.
“We, uh,” Steve floundered for a few seconds as it occurred to him how long it had been since he actually talked to his parents. He used to be better about telling them everything. How had he not gotten on the phone with them immediately after his first kiss with Tony? “I told him on Tuesday. We kissed, nothing more.”
Steve smiled to himself quietly. He didn’t deserve it, but he would take it. “I promise, Tony. I’ll call you as soon as we’re clear.”
Clint frowned at his brother and put his hands on his hips, in case his frown wasn’t intimidating enough. “You got a problem with that?”
Tony couldn’t have designed a better out of this relationship if he’d been given an algorithm and a bottle of whiskey.
Steve let him have a few moments of silence after he’d spoken, giving Tony the space to think or continue if he needed to. “You care, Tony,” he eventually said, his voice quiet but firm in his confidence. “You’re right, sometimes you need to manage it, compartmentalize. But caring is not something to hide from. It’s astounding, all the work you’ve done to help us. This is information we would never have known without you, be proud of yourself. I know I am,” he promised. “I think you’ve handled yourself very well. And not to mention, your Overdue Ritual preview helped me when I couldn’t find any peace.”
“Steve, stop me if this is irresponsible for the sake of the case,” Tony said in a softer tone of voice that had Steve’s eager heart pumping blood in the wrong direction. “But if you’re interested, there is a scene in Overdue Ritual where I could use your help.”
A sudden knock on Hawley’s office door shattered the tension in the room, and Steve jerked up in his seat to put as much distance as he could between himself and the professor. Whoever was on the other side of the door didn’t wait to be invited, but brazenly pushed the door open and stepped into the room.
“You thought it was okay if I shared my problems with you when I needed help, but you couldn’t do the same for me,” Steve finished for him. “That’s what you’re saying, Tony.”
Tony ached from the tips of his fingers to the bottom of his heart. Steve was not his family or his lover, his pain was not Tony’s to bear. But Steve clutched onto his Bucky with such desperation that it weighed on Tony’s soul. He couldn’t understand if Steve was holding on so fiercely because he was afraid of losing his friend again, or if he was afraid of being left behind. Steve hadn’t grieved at the Cryo-Prison when Tony told him his world had passed him by, so to see him grieve so openly and so deeply made him wonder when, if ever, Steve had truly felt safe or supported in Tony’s company.
Tony tried not to outright laugh when he took another look at Bucky. “They’re really something else, you know that, right?”
“We have an apartment on the Seine, facing the Eiffel Tower,” Tony told Carol in a rush of excitement, and Rhodey groaned at Tony’s transparent attempt to get her on his side. “The view is beautiful, and there’s a museum of indigenous artwork from around the world at the end of the block.”
“Sorry ‘bout the shitty news, dude,” Patrick said after a beat, sounding sincerely bummed out on Steve’s behalf. He pushed away from his desk to rummage through his drawer for a second before stretching across the room to offer Steve an unopened bottle of Johnnie Walker.
“If you desperately need to, you can fuck them; get it out of your system,” Tony said with a dismissive wave of his hand. “But not in our bed! And only once.”
“‘As a wedding present to Captain America and Iron Man, stand up to bullies. Stand up for freedom. Captain’s orders.’”
“Platinum? Titanium?” Tony asked with a slight quiver in his voice, losing himself momentarily as Steve made his way down to his nipples, humming in the affirmative all the way. “Gummi? Ring pop?”
Beside him, the girls openly wept. Even as silence fell over the audience and someone stood to address the audience, the girls wept. Tony didn’t want to invite the other masters’ attention by looking at them to see what was happening, but he had noticed earlier that while he was turned comfortably to lie on his belly, the girls were on their backs with their legs pushed out of the way. He couldn’t be sure if they were simply uncomfortable or if other things were being done to them, but he didn’t dare look. Instead, he glanced at Steve to see if he was watching them.
move, Steve, if I had been a little more aware at the time, I would have had my wicked way with you on the kitchen floor.”
“I was just thinking,” Tony murmured with a warm smile, studying Steve’s hopeful expression fondly. The extent of his relief in realizing Steve felt the same should be alarming, but frankly, he was too happy to care. It only made him feel more brave.
By the time Steve caught up with Tony, they were standing in what he could only presume was Tony’s living room. It wasn’t the designer home he expected, but a comfortable space filled with an enormous couch and numerous mismatched armchairs. There was no TV as far as Steve could see, but bookcases covered every inch of wall space, stuffed with books. His home even smelled of books, that soothing musky scent of old books mixed with sandalwood. Steve would have been happy to spend a few hours perusing Tony’s library to find a book to share one of those armchairs with.
Except here he was, two semesters from graduating with his Bachelor’s in cultural anthropology and two minutes from being asked the question he’d been dying to hear for one and a half years. From day one Steve had known that in those confident, adventurous eyes was his future, that there was something special about this man.
‘Hi Steve, I can only assume you’ve heard the news by now. I swear it wasn’t me, I don’t know who leaked it, but I hope the vultures aren’t giving you a hard time. If Hawley lets you go, call me. I still have some pull in the department, I’ll get you an internship with my firm to be on the case. I’ll only be grateful for your help,’ he added in a gentler tone that lifted Steve’s doubts into a private smile. ‘Or, you know, uh. Call me? When you get the chance. Or come by! Either way. Right—okay, bye.’
For the first joint solstice festival celebrated in Consone, Tony chose a dove grey suit to recognize the informal nature of the day. He had not been prepared to discover his husband-to-be in traditional black lederhosen, an embroidered black vest, and a white shirt with full bishop sleeves.
For a long time, Tony only studied Steve in silence. He brushed some of Steve’s hair away from his face, then swept the coarse pad of his thumb over Steve’s full, pink bottom lip. Obliging as he was, Steve parted his lips for Tony’s exploratory touch.
While peering around the room in search of curious insights into this man he barely knew, Steve noticed the clock on the far wall. It was well past eight on Friday morning—the judge would expect them (and especially Tony) within the hour.
She had clearly entered the room for a reason, but she stopped dead in her tracks when she saw Steve standing by the bed in nothing but his well-tailored jeans.
lives with no air conditioning in the Bronx every other day of the year. I don’t envy them. Oh, and there’s this ice cream place a block away, Lickety Split? We have to go just for the name, right?”
Tony hummed to himself, satisfied. “Every report of the Assembly talks about you, you know. Everyone is realizing how handsome you are. I am not sure I like that you are now out there in the world without me…”
From the gurney, Tony whined and turned towards Steve’s voice, suddenly worried about what Steve would choose. Steve let go of the gurney and took Tony’s hand instead, bringing Tony’s hand to his lips for a soft kiss.
“I’ll take care of him,” she said, and for the first time, it didn’t sound indecent; it sounded affectionate and protective. “You two watch each other’s backs out there, you hear?”
“We had a really small budget, start to finish it was three weeks, but I’ll never forget that set. Everyone on the cast and crew were either immigrants or children of immigrants,” Tony told Stephen, because it was so remarkable it was worth saying. “The diversity and excitement was unlike anything I’ve experienced. People with stories from all around the world were there to make this happen because we love this country, and we love the potential and optimism we see here. And you couldn’t tell this story without people who know what it’s like to be outsiders in their own country.”
Tony cursed softly under his breath as his gaze tracked Steve’s lips moving over his lips. “Then I am yours to kiss.”
“They’re acting shady, sir,” Steve seconded before Fury took Tony’s head off. “They don’t look like any government employees I’ve ever seen.”
“I mean it, Tony,” Steve said, doing his very best not to get swept away before they’d finished this conversation. “If I’m not giving you what you want, you’re the only one who can tell me.”
With a renewed boost in confidence, the squad leader took two steps forward. “Brock Rumlow, lie down and put your hands behind your back, or else…”
“Then you’re clearly not going to the right places,” Tony teased him with a deadpan delivery despite the blush warming his cheeks. “What’s more your speed, anyway? Are you a one-night stand guy or a real dating guy?”
“That was the problem the first time, wasn’t it?” Steve pointed out, leaning into the doorframe now instead and holding the door in a firm grip, as if Tony might try to barrel his way into the room and Steve had to brace himself for the tackle.
Tony adjusted his grip, spread Steve’s ass almost to the point of pain, then with a slow, measured pace, he licked a wet stripe from the bottom up to the top.
“I—yes, I do,” Steve all but whispered, then turned to Sharon and urgently waved her into the office. “Right, Sharon. You’ve met him?”
Dummy tore after the truck at a breakneck speed, stretching and reaching as best as he could. It was too dark for Steve to drive too fast on such unfamiliar roads, and soon, Tony managed to slide up against the driver’s side window. He pounded on the window, shouting for Steve to stop, to slow down—they needed to talk, this couldn’t be happening—
,” Steve decided as he pulled his sweaters over his head. He had already crawled under the three or four layers of fleece blankets and comforters, and as with any point well made, he wiggled out of his briefs and dropped them over the side of the bed where the rest of his clothes already lay in a haphazard pile. With a cheeky grin and an eager pat on the mattress where he obviously wanted Tony to join him, Steve batted his eyelashes and pulled the covers aside to flash the side of his naked thigh. “Tony? I’m waiting…”
“Nope,” Steve said with a laugh, leaning in closer still to press a chaste kiss to Tony’s grinning lips. “Jealousy, envy, possessiveness, they’re all ugly.”
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Stark! Congratulations on the marriage, Mr. Stark, what can you tell us about the special day?”
The summer solstice was barely a blip on the radar in old Machtberg. A pagan tradition had no business in an advanced, post-industrial country, and at most it was considered an excuse for families and friends to end their work day by going out to barbecue, taking their boats out on the water, and letting their kids stay up late enough to watch dazzling fireworks light up the night sky.
Tony stiffened at the comment, and a silence fell over the family as they all seemed to realize who was in their company all at the same time. With varying degrees of subtlety, they turned to look at Steve, who had taken to the stove to make the eggs.
“Oh, no, you don’t,” Steve growled from Tony’s left, and before Tony could even try to kiss the woman on his right, Steve reeled him in by the collar of his new jersey and claimed his lips in a needful, passionate kiss.
“Please,” Tony whispered, speaking softly so only Steve would hear. “Eyesight is precious and fragile, Captain Steven G. Rogers. You must give it time.”
Eventually, they got up. They picked up after themselves, and folded the blanket back up. There was a zip-up hoodie at the bottom of his bag, and Steve offered it to Tony wordlessly. Tony hadn’t really felt cold until that point, and he gratefully accepted it and bundled up. They walked down the boardwalk hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, watching the people and excitement around them while sunlight faded in the wake of the sunset. Nobody interrupted them or even stared after them, and Tony and Steve were able to stroll along the boardwalk like any other couple out for a mid-week walk.
Whatever else existed in the room - floors, rugs, tables of any kind - was impossible to see. There were books and pages strewn on every available surface, the books held open with various fruits and improvised paperweights like bottles of wine, potted succulents, and candlesticks of countless shapes and sizes.
For the first time in all the months that they’d casually known each other, Maria’s lips pulled into a surreptitious smile. “Maybe you’re alright, Rogers. And if this trial,” she started to say, but her words abruptly trailed off as she noticed something happening ahead of them. “Is that Coulson?”
It wasn’t until months later in Toulouse when by some miracle they stayed on the same floor at the same hotel. They were attending a panel on food scarcity and climate change. That’s what they were meant to do, anyway. On the first night, Rhodes had allowed Steve into Tony’s suite. Steve had only meant to invite Tony to dinner that first night to thank Tony for all his help and to show him that he was doing better, that he had found an even keel again.
“What do you take me for, Danvers? Tonight’s important to us, too,” Tony promised, sounding sincere before explaining, “Besides, Steve insisted on taking the edge off on the drive over, so unless there’s a bicycle seat involved, I’m game for anything”
“The Governor’s offices,” Tony said in a rush as Steve’s voice brought him back to the present. “The Governor has the means to oversee and alter the rehabilitation of all Cryo prisoners. Anyone with access to his computer terminal can potentially assign thawing orders. Those orders are not questioned, Steve Rogers. No commandment from Alexander G. Pierce is.”
“Hey, Steve?” he heard Tony whisper. “Can you hear me? We got him. You got him,” he said through water, and they were floating in sweet clouds and Steve wasn’t so sure what Tony meant but some part of him must have, because he felt the release of tension in his back and shoulders.
“Could I ever say no to you?” he asked them through his laughter, “but, you know, it would help if I knew when you were going, and where—”
“What? What’s that?” Steve replied while holding the phone farther from his face. “I’m going through a tunnel, you’re break—”
Two months. Was it too soon? Did love have to follow a timeline? What was the difference between love confessed after 6 weeks and the love confessed after months—
Steve pressed closer as he chased Tony’s lips for another kiss, this one more eager than the first. When they eventually parted, Steve could only nod his head in agreement.
Without thinking, Steve grabbed the pillow under his head and smacked Tony’s side hard. Tony curled up and covered his head, giggling madly, and Steve beat him once more for good measure.
It wasn’t until weeks later in Berlin when Bucky broke down the door to the bathroom Steve had been in for too long that their staff caught on to them. There simply was no other way to explain why they were both in there, tangled in each other’s arms with their shirts undone and their pants around their knees. Bucky stood sentry at the broken door and made sure they were decent before allowing Tony back to his table.
“Yeah, right across the road,” Steve said with a more relaxed smile. He sounded like New York, but the pricey parts. “You?”
“Confirm access permission with Chief Director Nicholas Fury and report rehabilitation assignment for Brock Rumlow.”
Tony laughed quietly and mouthed at Steve’s lips with a playful bite. “Then will you let me take you to bed and tell you about my day?”
“Howard Stark,” Tony’s dad replied, shaking Steve’s hand with a firm grip that bordered on painful. “Ever been out in the country, boy?”
“Hey, this isn’t urgent,” Tony promised. “I wanted to invite you to dinner, but I’ll let you go. I can leave the details in a voicemail.”
Tony frowned at the suggestion that he was wrong, and in a habitual defensive gesture, he crossed his arms over his chest. “Listen to her say what?”
Then, with a playful, smirking grin at Tony, Steve moved down the length of Tony’s body until Tony’s thighs rested against his shoulders and Steve could nuzzle the base of his cock. Steve was barely doing more than mouthing at the base of his cock and laving the hardening length of it with his tongue, but in his surprise, Tony arched off the bed and groaned deeply in his pleasure.
He was led to a bus stop a few yards away from the bar, where he was shown to a bench he could sit on.
“My parents are filthy rich,” Tony corrected quietly, and he resumed rubbing Steve’s back, as if he recognized that the news of his parents’ wealth was a shock Steve would need help recovering from, more so than the shock of their welcome only minutes earlier. A dog weaseled its way closer, rubbing its head against Steve’s limp hand in an explicit request for attention. Steve couldn’t even muster the energy to pull his hand away.
A sudden spark of hope had his heart skipping a beat. What if that dinner could be their first date?
“Tomorrow, Steve. Pack a weekend bag. First thing after we land tomorrow, we’re getting married—and this time, we’ll do it right.”
Talking about Steve and their relationship on camera was dangerous business, people saw too much too easily, and Tony wasn’t willing to share much. So he pulled himself together and changed gear before Stephen had a chance to ask anything else about America’s favorite Captain.
He wanted to whisk Steve away from the city, but he had no interest in Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, or any of the oceanside resorts Massachusetters (Massachusettians? Massachusettoans? Massacheuers?) seemed to favor. Tony wanted privacy, apart from everyone and out of sight. Besides, it was
So while Steve labored over languages and customs by hiding away in reading rooms and libraries where nobody would bother him, Tony oversaw the unification. Steve helped where he could, but language limited him severely, and Tony had saved up enough patented designs to open to the global market so he could devote his full attention to the politics without interrupting their cash flow. Their countries were opposites in almost every way, from the material and technical backgrounds, to the services they needed. Machtberg had a highly skilled, highly paid population, while Terrini farmers and craftsmen were still recovering from decades of Stane’s dictatorship and years of war. If the unification was to work, they would have to walk the fine line between providing Terrini too much help and angering the wealthy with high taxes, and doing so little that their initial inequalities turned into a salient class divide.
Steve stared down at the menu in shock. Unlike the unreasonable combinations of the regular menu, the children’s menu sounded delicious.
None of it had counted against Tony’s interests until Steve lifted Tony out of his lap and pinned him down into the couch cushions to tickle into surrender. Breathless and crying from laughter, Tony wasn’t good for anything but curling into himself for protection from Steve’s self-indulgent tickling.
“Why she is contesting joint custody of the children,” Steve added, remembering his earlier conversation with Tony Stark. A father who would rather lose his fortune than expose his children to a problematic divorce didn’t sound like someone who deserved to be without his children.
“I hope those are good sounds,” Steve said with a quiet laugh, and he offered the spatula for Tony to lick clean.
“If you fucking leave me without a mentor in this goddamn world, I will kill you myself, Tony,” Steve swore past the heavy knot in his throat, as the morality box nearby buzzed to life and announced both of his fines. “Don’t leave me here, Tony, what will I do without you?”
“Yes!” Tony hissed so suddenly that Steve’s eyebrows shot up his forehead. “Fucking yes—then I’m requesting your trainer.”
The exhibit plaque described it as a Magnetic Accelerator Gun, or AcMag. It was from the late 21st century, and it manipulated magnetic fields to pulverise its target.
“Sorry, darling,” he whispered, leaning in to kiss the bridge of Steve’s nose. “Didn’t mean to wake you.”
Tony’s breath caught and he exhaled with a quiet stutter, and Steve chased the sounds with a slow, purposeful grinding of his hips. Tony’s thighs quivered at the direct attention to his prostate; Steve shifted their position until his cock dragged over Tony’s spot with every thrust, until Tony’s whole body shuddered under his weight and came with sudden, breathless gasp.
“No, sweetheart. There’s no-one but you. This is just an old keepsake,” he admitted, running his finger over the chain until he caught the ring. He didn’t take the necklace off or offer it to Tony, but he smiled at it with a far-away look in his eyes, clearly revisiting a fond memory.
Given the low response in general to my fic and writing, I'm saving myself from the accompanying anxiety and feelings of failure by finishing this fic up much more quickly than I otherwise would have.
“Hey, sure. Come in,” Tony said then, shaken out of his stupor by those four unhappy words. He stepped away from the door to let Steve come in, but he paused in the hallway. Steve could see the question in his eyes as clear as day, but this wasn’t the time for intimacy. There was too much between them.
“Send 007 in, Carter,” H demanded tersely. “We don’t have time for your usual repartee this morning.”
“Oh hey, thanks!” Tony smiled back easily, as if it was normal for strangers to eavesdrop or tell people what to do. “You a regular here?”
“That is an American classic and you won’t make me feel guilty, Stark,” Steve tried to say with a straight, if gruff, face, but he must have failed because Tony only laughed at him.
“What?” he blurted out before he could truly appreciate what Tony had confessed. “I thought you liked Batman.”
After all, he knew what would come next. He could feel it, the hot, heavy weight of Steve’s hard cock trapped between them, nestled against Tony’s ass.
Steve wasted no time. It wasn’t a position he could hold forever, and it was only a matter of time before Tony’s breathless mewling grew into heedless cries of ecstasy. With quick, aggressive snaps of his hips, Steve fucked into Tony with brutal abandon. Distantly, he felt Tony clawing at his shoulders and breathlessly crying Steve’s name, and in that moment Steve recognized that the sound of Tony’s shrill, desperate voice crying his name as he neared orgasm was the most beautiful he had heard. Hearing the man he had loved for so long teetering on the edge gave Steve the strength to step away from the wall and cradle Tony’s body tightly against his own as he pound into him viciously. The force of gravity bore Tony down on Steve’s cock over and over again, impaling himself with the weight of his own body.
“Are you trying to make enemies, Rogers?” she growled, then shouldered her way past him into his room. In the time his drowsy senses processed that her anger was on his behalf, Natasha stepped into the light.
But when Tony had a chance to question him to explain how they knew who had made the payments - Barnes or Hansen - the accountant started dodging and sweating. The payment was made using their company account, which both spouses had access to at all times. There was no way to prove it was one or the other, except, as Tony rhetorically argued, what honest woman would pay for her husband’s philandering?
“So, what you’re saying is he can’t access credits until he learns to tear someone’s hand off,” Steve replied dryly, and gasps of horror and small grunts of nausea sounded from around the table.
The audience laughed, and Steve couldn’t help but chuckle, too, though in the end he just shrugged it off. “Once you get past the Louboutin, Peter Parker is the least intimidating person you could imagine. It doesn’t matter how famous you become, you’re still a person at the end of the day, and if you’re nice, people will want to spend time with you. I mean, listen. I do it every day: Tony is my partner and my best friend,” he added in a show of giddy playfulness he rarely revealed on camera, “but if you don’t think I’m his biggest fan, too—I see his movies in theaters - by myself or with friends though, because if you take Tony to a movie he’s in, he won’t stop talking. And he’s got all these incredible fans, too, there’s a great community online that I’ve been following for years,
A slight tension around Steve’s mouth eased not to have to say the words out loud, and he cleared his throat to steady his voice and soldier on. “Knowing what I did, you’d still marry me?”
From the front of the group, Steve heard Sharon gasp in happy surprise and cry with excitement - clearly, she and Brock had both gotten a spot.
“I fear how easily you inspire me,” Tony muttered petulantly. “You make it seem effortless. And now the world knows my pain… you are impossible to resist. Finish your job, make Coulson happy. Then come back home, my love. Come back, and I will be a most grateful husband.”
“You—are you deaf?” Sitwell forced through gritted teeth. “I have told you before that it is impossible: Foster doesn’t want the publicity. She won’t do an interview, let alone on national daytime TV. Hell, she hasn’t done an interview in over a decade!”
Cotton candy was the best. The whole world should be made of cotton candy, and then nobody would be homeless and nobody would go hungry because sugar is amazing and even clouds need love.
“No, not again,” he heard himself groaned hoarsely, and he dug his fingers into the firm, meaty muscle of Steve’s shoulders. Steve pulled off his cock then and eased the rhythm of his fingers until he was only slowly, gently, pumping his fingers in and out of Tony’s body, giving him a sliver of satisfaction.
Stephanie huffed a quiet laugh and smacked Clint lightly upside the head. “I talked to Talia,” she said then, rushing to say everything she needed to say before dawn. “She has promised that you and Tony will be spared: you will be released, and allowed to go wherever you want to go. She will never bother you again. And, as soon as I can,” she promised, “I will keep the rest of my promise. I will peacefully unite men with the tribes.“
“I am very confused by what you think my type is,” Steve observed quietly, struggling to form any rational response. “But, I can fuck them all once each? That’s allowed?”
“Yes, it would, it would make me much more comfortable,” Steve muttered, and in his irritation he started to scratch more aggressively at the back of his left hand. “And can we stop at a pharmacy or hospital or something? I think that Cryo cell gave me a rash.”
“Perfect,” Steve praised him, and it was almost enough to make up for the contentment he’d now been deprived of. “All eyes will be on you, Tony. You’ll be the star of the show.”
Steve couldn’t look away from the rink, but he was still aware enough to frown at what Tony said. “Now? There’s overtime, they—it could end any minute.”
“Pepper, she sent me a picture of the boxes she left with you. I’m a fast reader,” Tony explained. “I thought I could help.”
“My point is, making food for someone you care about is romantic—and it works,” Clint said with a touch less enthusiasm. “We’ll pick a quiet movie then peel off, I don’t know, halfway through the movie?”
Tony eyed his brother suspiciously while he chewed his hot dog. His delicious, bacon wrapped hot dog with cream cheese, grilled onions and bell peppers that Clint clearly wouldn’t have made unless he felt guilty about
“Not for me,” Steve said with a shrug, but Tony didn’t quite buy it. He narrowed his eyes at Steve and let Steve stew in the silence.
“And what’s this rumor we’re hearing, that you sent your copy of the book to Peter Parker?” Josh wondered with curious excitement. “When I caught up with him in, in November I think, he said that you shared notes with him on how to interpret the story?”
“Take a moment, Tony,” Dr. Odinson said in a deep, soothing rumble. “Calm yourself. Consider the question with care.”
Before he even had the chance to click it on so his friends could see what was going on, Bucky was texting someone and Sam had his phone to his ear, waiting on someone to answer.
“I’m fine, Tony. There’s nothing going on,” Steve promised, turning them towards a flower stall in the hopes of distracting him. He had no business being attracted to observant people, he really didn’t.
“I kill wolves with my hooves, and I can tear through your arm with one bite. I’m not afraid of you,” Clint retorted coolly. “This can be peaceful, or you can suffer severely, but I’m staying either way.”
When the General finally arrived to personally address any of the King’s requests, his first order of business was to have a photo taken with Bucky and the King, both veterans of infantry, with the cavalry’s crest clearly visible on their jackets. In the time it took for the photos to be taken, all-terrain vehicles were arranged to transport Steve and Bucky to the nearest clearing for an airlift to Lumine. They were sent off with many well-wishes, expressions of gratitude, and a promise from the General to reach out to the commanding officers in Lumine to inform Tony that Steve was on the way.
“Right, of course... why didn’t I think of that? I’m sure single Mr. Gay U-S-A is just waiting outside the office, dying to commit a federal offense!”
,” Tony patiently told him, not that Steve believed it for a second. “Finish your meetings, and come home.”
“Who makes that kind of a call on April Fools!” Tony all but shouted before Steve could get his hands on the proverbial wheel. Steve’s quiet, contained snickering burst into outright laughter, and with a dirty look, Tony made a big show of scooting his chair a few inches to his right to put more distance between them.
How Steve had thought he could arrive at Sam and Sharon’s Halloween party dressed as a Highlander - but a sexy one who didn’t have fleas and lived in the time of central heating - and
The sweet and savory smell of breakfast permeated the air more noticeably the closer they got to the kitchen. The lure of coffee and bacon, of buttery biscuits and French toast, grew stronger with every step.
Bucky stared at it in silence before finally shaking his head. “What the hell is that supposed to mean? What a dick. Does he think dangling a relationship is going to make you come running back?”
It couldn’t be right; that was impossible, no released felon could ever be released into society with such a training! “Computer, this is no time for mischief—”
“It’s just a nightmare, Tony,” Steve tried to explain, clearing his throat and swallowing back the bile of guilt. “This is all a nightmare.”
“I called Dr. Betz, Natasha is on her way to personally escort her to the palace,” Pepper began with an unflappable calm that Steve appreciated now more than ever. “The four scheduled meetings can be postponed without major consequences, I will make those calls personally. The only time sensitive appointment this week is in two days with the US Secretary of State.”
. That look someone had captured in a screenshot and posted on ONTD to stoke Steve’s deepest, most repressed insecurities.
Tony slowed to a halt, clapping his hands for his weasley little troll. “Marple! Here girl,” he called, stern enough that she almost obeyed without thinking. But instead of coming to him she laid down on the trail, protecting her toy.
“You are right, Steve,” Tony said when his sudden spike of affection was under control. “My apologies, my love. But, I have not been near an uncontrolled crowd of people in my life. And in the dark?”
, the dialect of High German spoken in old Machtberg. Lumine was part of old Terrini where people spoke Cimbri, an ancient Italian relative of High German that now was nearly extinct. Though they were not close enough to be intelligible, Tony had been raised to speak both fluently, so he almost took the language symbol on patient charts for granted. Everyone he met in Lumine spoke Cimbri; this woman was an exception.
“I have never had so much fun at a Christmas market as I did today,” Tony laughed when they were back at the palace.
An indignant fire burned behind Bucky’s eyes and he looked ready to burn down  hell for Steve. Bucky’s faith in him was all Steve had left in his corner now.
“Captain Rogers, Sergeant Barnes: Sir wishes to know whether he may intrude to speak with Captain Rogers on a private matter.”
“Rogers, do you remember when we agreed that you would not go to the Frankfurt Book Fair because you were not allowed to leave the country while your visa application was being processed?”
Aware of his inferiority relative to all gold class Lieutenants in the room, Tony waited for Fury’s attention before answering his partner’s question.
The only thing that connected these victims was that their bodies were found soon after their death, even though they’d been missing for much, much longer. It supported the runaway theory - kids who ran away from their responsibilities and bills, or homophobic families, only to be found in the gutter once their luck ran out.
The young man blinked up at him with wide, honey-brown eyes. Then, all at once, the man jumped into action and reached to pull his bag off the chair, gesturing for Steve to sit down.
Steve startled out of his thoughts and it took him a moment to find Tony standing beside him. Tony smiled back at him when Steve’s gaze finally focused on him, and he sunk back on the couch to find his place under Steve’s protective arm.
“First of all, the man’s allergic to liars; remember last week when he wouldn’t believe you knocked his cup off the desk?”
Clint immediately stepped back out of the house and started to pull his boots off on the porch. He sat them down just inside the door in his effort to leave the clean floor unsullied.
His look failed to make Natasha do anything but smirk. “Don’t give me that look, Stark. If you wanted it to be a secret you shouldn’t gawk at him in the middle of the newsroom.”
“I told dad I’d call when we landed. He’ll be on his way—” Tony started to say as he unlocked his phone, but Steve shook his head before he made the call.
Whatever Steve’s answer was, Tony’s mind was already made up. The liberty of ascending to gold status was only pittance compared to the sanctity and security of the city. They simply could not overlook this lead.
Steve sent off his last email while Bucky grunted and groaned and tried not to pull his hair in frustration. “So what if he’s read the Fellowship? What half-assed hipster hasn’t read Tolkien by now? Besides, he’s an author—”
Steve blinked down at him, so conflicted Tony almost felt bad about his demands. “But, Tony,” Steve whispered, concentrating so hard Tony could practically feel him willing his erection away for a sobering conversation. “We need to talk. I’m worried about you.”
He felt Steve’s rhythm slip into a desperate rut until he buried himself deep inside Tony’s body. The come filling him, the wet alien feeling that was still so new and so
?” Steve cried, his arms crossed at his chest one second and fisted at his hips the next. That didn’t just look uncomfortable, it looked
Unless the dim lighting of the room was playing tricks on his vision, the wall to the far right was made entirely of glass, or a two-storey window that stretched the full width of the room. Steve didn’t have to see anything to know the view was stunning. The room itself was designed as an open space with a four-sided fireplace built with pale grey stones at its focal point. Steve could only stand there, staring at the casual opulence of the room in disbelief.
“Agent. I’m Detective Steve Rogers, I ran the task force. Captain Carter is in a meeting with the Commissioner down at 1PP. She’ll be back by ten.”
Without thinking, Tony took a small step back so he could look at the idiot he was clearly going to marry. “Did Peggy tell you that you were out of your mind?”
Tony nodded even though he didn’t understand what this final job could possibly entail. Steve had told him they were here to help train future harvesters, but they had all left.
Steve made a point to glance at the wall clock that doubled as a sculpture before answering. “Our sessions up in a few minutes; Francis has had a tough day, though, so I thought we’d wait for him to finish telling Seamus all about it.”
Steve gently cupped Tony’s face in his hands, trying to help him snap out of whatever funk he was in. “What’s going on? You’re scaring me, Tony.”
“You’re a stranger I still love, Steve,” he confessed on a soft breath. “Kiss me so I can know you again.”
“I feel melodramatic, ‘six long days,’” Tony grumbled in the little courtyard they had found to eat the lunch Steve had brought with him. “Howard said I have to be a team player if I want to take over the company. I have to ‘understand how people work in my company,’ which is outright bullshit—he never did it. He just wants me under his thumb, I fucking know it.”
“I don’t need your praise,” Steve said as he finished with the mail, and finally deigned to look at her. “But I do need you to explain to me who Jean is, and why he—she?—wants me to call?”
“Bake, but it’s very simple, it takes almost no time,” Steve told him, sifting the flour with sugar and some salt onto his wooden surface. He formed it all into a little mountain, made a nest in the top, then cracked three eggs into the center. He added butter, lemon zest, and a splash of dry wine to the liquid before digging in with his hand to knead it into a dough.
Eventually, he pulled his fingers free. Tony knew better than to whine or wriggle, so he lay still, allowing Steve to look his fill.
All at once it caught up to him—the delayed plane, the missed connection, the shitty turbulence that kept Tony on the edge of his seat but Steve somehow slept through—and Tony shot up with a startled breath. “I’m up! I’m up,” he promised, grasping at Steve’s arm to help push himself upright. “Shit, I’m good. Are we late?”
Steve lifted Tony and slid the pajamas off his legs, and somehow made it look easy. The bastard even paused to smirk up at Tony as he swept his thumb over hollow of Tony’s ankle, rubbing the joint in his firm grip. Tony hissed in a sudden intake of breath and his hardening cock twitched with interest, and Steve dove to action immediately, happily alternating between licking a wet path and taking big, playful bites of Tony’s inner thighs as he laid down on his belly and nuzzled Tony’s groin.
None of them much felt like going home after that, so Steve and Bucky invited them along to Sally’s. Beer flowed freely, and by the time officers from the 20th arrived on the scene, mutinous pacts were sworn and rebellious hearts soared, loud and boisterous in their shared allegiance to the gold shield.
Tony rolled his eyes and gave him a dry look in return, looking as unimpressed as a man holding back a smirk could possibly look. “I’m not feeling very willing to do anything right now, Steve. What is this place you picked? Ten bucks per eclair?”
With a quiet sound of understanding, Tony raised his voice to say, “I’ve been going over my stories with Pepper this past week, and I think—I can’t be sure if it’s even noticeable to others, but there may be something else connecting the specific scenes the murderer used for his crimes. I can come down to the station and explain, I can be there in forty minutes, maybe thirty—”
Steve had looked ready to jump out of the third storey window after her, but Tony’s wince made him turn around. With one last glance after Romanov, Steve doubled back for Tony. He pulled a knife of the sole of his shoe to free Tony’s hands and feet. It was a standard MI6 issue and Tony couldn’t stop staring.
“There’s a chance you’re reinforcing the wrong behavior, sweetheart,” Steve observed breathlessly as their lips parted. Tony couldn’t take his eyes off of him.
“And you still haven’t,” Tony pointed out, though he shrugged it off just as easily. “How’s the case going?”
“I need my chief priest, Steve,” Tony answered in a firm, deep voice that washed over Steve in a feverish, full body shudder. “I need my sacrifice.”
“She’s an incredibly talented actress,” Steve told Tony as if he was compelled to say it. “She was so convincing. I hated her.”
He’s not like other people. He is respectful, he’s kind, he listens—not because he’ll get something out of it, but because it’s how you’re supposed to treat people! Who does that, Nat? Hell, I don’t deserve him. And I asked him out, what was I thinking? Have you seen him? He’s sex on legs, I can’t wait until marriage; I don’t even know if I want to get married but I’m horny as hell. I’m not a masochist, what is my life?”
Tony’s laptop was sleek and unlike anything Steve had ever seen. The first hint of a red flag was waving somewhere in his gut. “Nice computer,” he noted casually. “Where’d you get it?”
“Was that why you laughed at me?” Steve hissed, sitting up straight to use his height and size advantage to glare down at Tony with all his raging resentment. “When we got out of Dr. Odinson’s office—”
Their first class of the day was Stromwell, and Maria had a seat further in the back like a sane person who knew better than to sit in the front row. Then again, if anything could take his mind off this mess, it was Stromwell.
“Someone’s excited,” Tony teased, picking up the pace a little to catch her for a good pat, but she kept speeding up to stay a yard or so ahead of him.
The Cryo-Prison parking structure was unusually empty for a Monday afternoon, and Bruce tried not to think about the senseless MDK of Dr. Helen Cho in the same structure that they had collectively witnessed from the station.
“We have a lot of exciting movies and shows to talk about tonight,” Graham continued on the screen, “let us begin with the hero and the monster sitting on the couch who bring us the first blockbuster of the winter season: Van Helsing! It opens everywhere on Halloween weekend—but this isn’t the typical spooky fare, is it?”
There was no reason left to argue, and Steve had no arguments left to make. He lifted his palms in a universal sign of surrender and walked away.
Affection soon replaced guilt, and Tony’s heart lifted when Marple’s ears perked up again. She turned shamelessly into the firm, indulging pats, then dropped and rolled to her back so she could throw her paws in the air for belly rubs.
“Sir, of course. At Taco Bell, we strive to accommodate all allergies, preferences, and sensitivities. What could we prepare for you?”
When he came back and handed Maria the files, Maria didn’t say anything or make a move to leave. Steve wasn’t sure what to do. Maria never struck him as an awkward or insecure person; as far as he knew, the only emotions she expressed were disappointment in the capitalist patriarchy and an unshakable resolve.
Whatever indignity Tony suffered for being called a ‘silly little man’ on television was quickly forgotten as Fran climbed across Steve’s legs and wagged with all her might at him and Star-Lord. “Ven aquí, carita! We missed you,” he told her as the shy little boxer started slowly wiggling his butt in tentative excitement.
“You’re a smart boy. You already know what’s about to happen, don’t you?” she said with a smile that was all teeth. “Close the door, Stark.”
They traveled only by night, and when they slept, they slept in shifts. One fortnight passed before Clint relented and allowed Tony to ride on his back; they both traveled barefoot, but in this case, Clint was clearly advantaged by his curse.
“So, in almost every other way, you’re pretty clever,” Clint said after a beat, “but in this you are so wrong that I would laugh if I didn’t think you threw it in her face. Did you even listen her?”
Steve worked the same hours every day, six to three. He would take the time to make dinner, and then busy himself either with a crossword puzzle or a book until Tony came home. With the exception of one night where Tony didn’t have enough brain power to climb the stairs and they had planted on the couch to eat dinner and read
Tony did his best to suck down a shaky breath as Steve told him, but it was difficult to contain himself as his body responded to its conditioning. His hips rolled up instinctively after Steve’s thick fingers; the metal cuffs kept him from moving much at all, but Steve noticed his positive response and rewarded him by curling his fingers just so and smoothing the lubricated pads of his fingers over Tony’s prostate.
Sam stared at her, betrayed. “That’s our cue,” he decided, taking Thing 1 by the hand and turning away with an exaggerated huff. Tony and Steve were the first to start laughing, and the group conversation reset again.
“Enhance your calm, Steve Rogers. I will go no farther than the lavatory and I will return in tick tocks.”
Tony held out his hands again for Steve. They were bare and already too cold for comfort, and Steve closed his hands over Tony’s to warm him up. He frowned to himself in surprise, and Tony heard Steve mutter ‘how?’ to himself in Cimbri before pressing Tony’s hands to his own face, one on each cheek, and covering them with his own big, warm hands. Tony had to bite his lips to keep from smiling like a fool.
“Let him?” Tony moaned on the next attempted crack, and as Steve readjusted over him, doing his best to ignore the smooth elastic edges of Tony’s black briefs pressing into the heel of his palms, he tried to continue his line of thought.
“That is not the definition of life!” Tony cut in with such a sudden outburst that even the passing New Yorkers turned their heads.
“Yeah, they still make you feel it’s possible, every year,” Tony said with a solemn sigh, then moved on without a second thought. “What else? The gym, obviously.”
They both blushed and laughed in their surprise before looking at each other as if trying to measure where the other stood on the matter at hand.
Tony peered up at him with a curious smile. “I don’t know, Sparky,” he replied in a playful tone. “You’ll have to keep me around to find out.”
“What, cause he’s pushing 50 and still has an eight-pack? Sure,” Tony conceded, because he’d just made his own point. “He’s smart and charming and sexy and single-handedly responsible for employing half of Gotham. But he’s kinda sketchy, don’t you think?”
With his lips thinned in determination, Bucky nodded and led them back to Tony’s apartment. Tony was nowhere to be seen, but it didn’t matter; Steve was there to see Bucky. They grabbed some water out of the fridge and sat down at the kitchen table to talk.
Steve glance down at the countdown on his watch. Thirteen hours had passed since the attack. Seven hours remained until Tony would willingly retire.
Tony took one look at him and grew pale. He urged Steve into his apartment and told him to have a seat, and soon Steve was bundled in a large, plush blanket big enough to drown in.
Slowly, by some unnamed power, Steve walked into the kitchen and took a seat on a stool at the counter where Tony was working. He didn’t say anything, but Tony grabbed a second plate and filled it halfway with the veggies before placing it in front of Steve. He stuck a spoon into the mac and cheese and pushed it closer to Steve, too.
“Yesterday’s clothes Steve? Really?” he muttered in undertone. “Suspect or not, Stark is still connected to the case.”
Tony smiled when he wanted to chuckle, and held up the platter of food and drink that he was carrying. “Supper, sir.”
“And they look good, too,” Bucky agreed as he took Steve’s abandoned post to peer into the oven beside Tony. “Do they have any filling?”
“Electricity and heating has not yet been restored to the affected parts of the city, Your Majesty, but generators have allowed medical staff to proceed uninterrupted. Many survivors who did not require hospitalization elected to remain at the camp near their families. I hear additional generators are being prepared to supplement current needs if electricity is not restored by nighttime; in this region, the temperature drops ten degrees at night, at best.”
“I think you mean doe-eyes,” Steve corrected primly, then dropped the act with a shrug and a resigned half-smile. “Who knows? I’ll pretend he’s Jack Savoretti.”
His phone rang from his jacket pocket, and Tony reflexively started patting himself down to find it.
Steve could feel Tony’s body seize around his cock as his orgasm consumed him, and before he dropped them, Steve all but threw them back into bed, pinning Tony to the mattress with own body as he kept pounding into him, fucking Tony through his orgasm. Soon, Tony’s guttural moans and eager rolls of his hips turned into stuttering whimpers and shudders of discomfort. Steve recognized the signs of overstimulation, but the way Tony’s muscles continued to clutch and contract around his cock was inadvertently pushing Steve to the point of no return, and although he knew it might be hurting Tony, it was so easy to listen to the way Tony cooed and moaned around Steve’s earlobe to keep fucking him, not to stop, to use his body. The strong, controlled snaps of Steve’s hips turned an erratic, desperate rut as he chased his own release in Tony.
Tony pulled the door closed behind him, giving them some privacy while the kids were still out for recess. “I thought you might ask that,” he confessed, sauntering to Steve’s desk with a self-satisfied smirk. “And I thought of three reasonable explanations on the way here. Would you like to hear them?”
Clint glanced at the door, then looked at Tony. Then, without preamble, he sat his heavy haunches down on the packed dirt floor of Tony’s cottage like it was his own damn floor. “I’m staying,” he announced. “You can’t move me.”
Steve was still scrubbing his hair dry when someone hammered on his hotel room door and demanded to be let in.
“Bold of you to think you aren’t already asses,” Natasha drawled, but then with a little smirk, she said, “but Talia won’t harm you. Besides, I can do one better.”
Steve settled him into position easily, strapping Tony down by his forearms and thighs. The cushioned counter was quite comfortable, and if Steve kept his time well, Tony would only enjoy meeting his daily quota.
“Bait!” Tony suggested while the rest of them were still processing the question. “I can set up a profile that resembles the victims’ profiles, and you’ll - we’ll need someone to be sugar baby bait. Someone who can go on first dates and use them as an interrogation. Do you have any young men in the department who could do it?”
