His parents, Jarvis, Ana, Rhodey, yes, Rhodey, because yes, they spoke to each other from time to time, but he spent 80% of his time in military service, even Pepper.
Tony had been used to the idea that he was going to die alone for more than thirty years, and it was hard, at first, to live knowing that nobody would love you, and after some time, he started to hate his mark.
The one who told stories about what happened to his war colleagues after Steve went on the ice, even though it was clear that Tony did not like the subject.
“I don't know what you're talking about” Tony commented without taking his eyes off the nanochips he worked on, however, smiling sideways he added “Mrs. Potts. ”
Tony knew he didn’t stand a chance from the start, but from the moment Rogers turned Steve and he started responding to Tony’s jokes sarcastically instead of getting angry Tony realized he was really fucked up.
When the finished version of the Accord arrived in the hands of Rogues Steve just confirmed what he already knew, that they made a lot of mistakes in many ways, maybe he was making mistakes from a long time ago.
In his head, at that moment, the only thing he could think was to go back, but he knew was too late, so he prayed.
That day Tony slept embraced with Rhodey, his head against his chest. In the dark Tony vocalized one of the few thoughts he had had for many years, since MIT.
Maybe it was the power of his soul mark, which Tony doubted, if not Steve would love him back, or was his blue eyes, the sincere way he wanted to protect everyone and everything, how he wanted to help even those who didn’t want help.
Pepper hugged him with everything she had in her on the day that he screamed so much with a few representatives of the accords for forgiveness to the rogues.
Maria believed that it meant that something evil lived in Tonty, back then, taking so many pills, she would say how much of a bad person he was, how creep he was, how evil.
And Rogers and Barnes fought hard, the intention was clear, each punch, each kick. If it hadn’t been clear before, the shield on his chest was all the message he needed. Rogers fought to kill.
Peter blossomed in Tony's constant presence, opening himself to Tony and siking more and more for his advice and tips. It was adorable, to say the least, although Tony would never admit it out loud.
Tony never told anyone that she put a vision in his head, and if it depended on the two of them, Tony would die with that secret kept deep in his heart, along with his many other secrets.
Rhodey took a leave of absence from the military when he found out, Tony tried to protest, he didn’t want to disrupt their lives any more than he already did, but Rhodey was vehement.
Tony was always so much more than Steve could be, he just hid it behind false arrogance, his way of driving people away.
So Tony stayed away, physically when the news came and emotionally when he was forced to stay close to him.
But he didn't cry that day, because Stark man are made of iron and it means that Howard was such a motherfucker that even if Tony knew better, he couldn't let himself cry, it was a weakness, he knew that it wasn't, but at the same time, he believed that it was.
He told Pepper that this was his last wish, to make up for his sins, even if just a little, even if just to die knowing that he did just a little more. It would never compensate the people that died from his weapons, but he would try.
Training with him helped to distract himself from the constant feeling of being sick, as if every second he could feel his body getting weaker, the headaches more frequent and strong, like it was going to split in half, the heart more fragile.
Tony wanted to say no, wanted to cry, wanted to scream, wanted to shoot the man in the face and make a hole in his face with one of his propulsion jets.
However, even after Ultron, Tony hoped that Steve, not Steve, Rogers, would have at last some respect for him.
He had escaped death with pieces of metal in his chest and a few years later someone came and stuck another piece of metal there, as if to reinforce the point of view.
“No, Barnes.” began Natasha “I understand your logic, but we made a lot of mistakes. You are another story, you were not to blame for what you did and even if Tony doesn't like it, he knows it. Us? We are to blame for everything we did, some more than others, but we are. ” She stopped for a second, sitting next to Clint she looked Bucky in the eye “The first time I met him he was dying and even then I got carried away by his mask. It was simple, to let him withdraw. And then he proved me wrong again and again and somehow we formed a kind of partnership. He is the one who understands me most probably and… I betrayed him in the worst way, and he knows it, and I know it, and there is nothing we can do about it, because everything that I said to him… I said because I wanted to hurt him, and I did.”
He never fixed, but he also didn't want Peter to have this kind of incentive, so he tried in other forms, in the form of a mentor, in the form of what spider man needed.
"Tony," she said, pulling the man into a hug. She kissed the crown of his head before continuing "I will not question it again if it is about this, but we know it is not"
During the week, everything felt like a blur and he was constantly feeling dizzy and light-headed. His soul-mark burned, and its colors, blue, gold, and silver,  ware fading into a gray tonality, sometimes it would bleed too.
Neither Rhodey nor Pepper said anything, even if one of them was always there, watching his back, present while training with Peter, waiting on the TV room when he was having his therapy sessions or watching with curious eyes what he was doing in his workshop. Most of the time it was Rhodey since he would live with Tony until he died.
Tony had thought a lot about it back in the days from MIT. Rhodey didn’t have a soulmate, Tony’s ware dead, they would manage, somehow, but Tony never created the courage to ask, and neither did Rhodey.
Guilt because Steve knew he was wrong. He recognized that, not only now but the moment he planted the shield on Tony's chest, hell, even before that, Steve knew he was wrong, but he didn't want to deal with it, he didn't even want to think about listening and having Bucky escaping between his fingers once again.
So Tony went to his workshop and stayed there. No one went after him because they knew it was useless, but they threatened, through Friday, if he didn't take his medicine.
The one who explained to Steve that not everything people say is literal, but sometimes just a joke.
Unfortunately, work didn’t wait and Tony had a lot to do, even if he just wanted to lie in his bed and never get up again.
The scar was not pretty either, and the number of broken bones didn’t help, but Tony remained quiet in the medical wing just so Pepper would stop looking at him like he was going to break at any moment.
Every fuckying day he would look in the face of his friends and prepare himself for the other shoe to drop.
He makes sure that Peppers know it, she offers him to change to a new doctor and he clarified that he will hate all the therapists.
He couldn’t put in words how thankful he was for them, so he would use his money to buy them a lot of expansive presents and they would get it because they knew Tony was bad with feelings.
When they arrived at the compound after a few hours of flight, Vision and Pepper were waiting for them in the landing area, greeting them politely and indifferently, the message was clear, passed through with only a hard look.
Steve would only feel the cold a little less when the Wakanda sun started to appear through the window, the light illuminating the room.
Tony sighed, adjusting his head so that it leaned right where he could hear Peper's heartbeat, loud, steady, unlike his beat, which grew weaker and weaker.
At night, when Pepper wasn't there and Rhodey was sleeping in the couch while Tony worked on the workshop, Tony would ask himself what would kill him first, his soul mark or his heart, that was very damaged because one of his not so dead soulmates chose to put a shield on it.
Tony had to do something about it, which meant that he needed to upgrade his armor constantly, stronger, faster. Tony made one from Peter too, but it would be an inheritance.
Second: this chapter doesn't have much angst, but in the next ones we will have a little suffering, so prepare yourselves.
Tony had tried very hard to make up for the mistakes of his past, but apparently, fate had already waited long enough and his second chance had not been enough, he hadn’t saved enough people and for that reason he would die a slow and painful death, gradually getting sick, the symptoms taking little by little his body until finally, he would die, alone.
There was nothing else to do about Rogers or his ex-friends. What was left was to accept and try to live the little time he had left by saving as many people as possible, and if he wanted to do that, he needed them.
He then remembered Yinsen and his weapons and concluded that yes, he deserved it and in the end, he was going to die alone.
Looking back, Steve knows that he could have done everything differently, from the beginning, but dealing with his own mistakes, the only thing Steve did was swallow his own morals, accept the feeling of doing something deeply wrong and then continued on.
The kid would finish his training smiling like he could hug Tony, but he never tried, and Tony never asked.
He didn’t want to feel that way, not because of Rogers, not because of Barnes, not because Avengers had split, because he had known it would happen sometime, he prepared himself for it, every fuckying day.
The relationship between the two did not seem exactly functional at the moment either. Shuri had helped Bucky get his head back on track, and despite the guilt, he almost reminded him of Bucky from before, much quieter and with shadows of guilt in his eyes, but he was there, under all that pain, changed, evolved, but still Bucky.
T'Challa stopped him before he had a chance and explained that Tony Stark was in a hospital... After spending 8 hours in the snow, alone, waiting for death to spare him.
His lungs were also not in the best condition, and under Pepper and Rhodey’s disapproving gaze, Tony adapted his armor so that the air circulation wouldn’t be a big problem.
And he knew it would hurt, and that it would be awful, but he was made of iron and he needed to be strong enough. He needed to pay for his sins because that's what he had to do.
Then, one night, she would go to his house to keep him company, and he would find out that she knew about his soul mark.
Steve was grateful because while Bucky was in the cryogenic chamber and he had to go through this alone, the impression he had was that the night would never end, each night seemed some kind of horror movie where he would get stuck in his own head and couldn't get out, visualizing his own nightmares over and over.
The one that let Steve into his workshop when he had a nightmare, even if he wouldn't let anyone else.
Sometimes Tony would look at them and it was like he could see them braking with that thought. Because Tony would die, and there was nothing they could do about it.
Tony knew that if the two of them had sat down and talked before the fight, if Rogers had been honest with him, none of this would have happened. Rogers knew that too.
Then, Tony grew and started to accept (actually not) the fact that his soulmates weren't alive anymore, Tony even found some comfort in that, knowing he wouldn’t take someone’s light in the same way that Howard did with his mother.
The mood between them, the Rogues, got heavier after that, as if they couldn't deal with their mistakes.
It was easier to deal with hatred than with the idea of friendship in some way so that in the end he would be left alone, as he knew it would happen, sooner or later. As always.
Tony also started to call Peter to the compound more, he had little time, and God, how Tony hated to think about it, it was not nearly enough time for him to learn what he needed without being guided in a more direct approach, if he let the kid by himself he couldn't think about what kind of problems he would create.
Steve hadn't seen blood at the time, but he knew that behind that armor there must have been a lot. His stomach churned at the thought and he needed to run to the bathroom to vomit whatever he had consumed, which wasn't much these last few days.
“It's not that simple” began Clint, who was sitting in front of Bucky “As far as we know he forgave us, legally, yes, which is already a big step, but as far as Rhodey has hinted, he will only join the team again because of public matter ”.
The Avengers pardon came a week later, with conditions and calls from a Rhodey who wouldn't stop to listen, just inform and disconnect the connection as soon as he said what he had to say. Every time this happened, everyone in the conference room cowered a little more in themselves.
But he kept trying, hoping that if somehow he was good enough, maybe he could fix what was broken with himself.
When the government decided that Tony should rejoin the Avengers to try to improve their public image — apparently fighting a criminal who is against the government and that was trying to protect a hydra assassin did wonders to Tony publicity as iron man—
One day, when Rhodey was resolving the Avengers issue which meant that Pepper was the one who should stay to keep him company, she entered the workshop where Tony made yet another armor, trying to make one that performed well under the water so that the movement was fluid and the pressure did not crush it.
Tony couldn't say whether their constant presence did him any good or bad. It was a constant reminder that he was dying and sometimes Tony felt claustrophobic, sometimes he just wanted some time alone, but Tony also knew that his thoughts would go on dangerous paths when he was alone for a long time.
But he still loved Steve, even if he hated Tony. So, when the news that Bucky was alive reached his ears he locked himself down on his workshop for a whole week and tried to prepare himself for what was about to come.
Tony also loved Steve too much, more than he loved Pepper, even though he did everything he could to avoid it.
When Pepper found out she was heartbroken but insisted that Tony kept talking with the psychiatrist, she wanted Tony to at last die in a better mental state, she didn’t say it with her words, but it was easy to read in her eyes. Tony didn’t have much of a choice anyway, he was dying, so let him try to ease the tension on Pepper’s shoulders a little.
Steve was just grateful that Tony had survived, he was sure he couldn't cope if he had died, the moment he planted the shield on his chest something very wrong had happened inside Steve. He could feel something breaking, spreading in his chest, a sense of terror, almost like a disease, spreading slowly.
Bucky was sitting next to him, and despite their relationship being in a state that Steve himself couldn't explain, without being dating, but without being apart either, his shoulders and legs were touching, as if they wanted to convey comfort when whoever was supposed to be comforting Bucky was Steve.
Not just because his parents didn’t love him, but because his soulmates were dead before Tony was even born.
So Steve stayed, still not sure why yet, maybe to help Bucky, maybe because he knew that it would just infuriate Tony more, giving up like that after everything this fight cost.
Of course, it always came with some other mental issues, like anxiety and PTSD, and yeah, it was awful and all, but Tony never felt as helpless as he was now.
Tony didn't know exactly what to feel while hugging Peter, his tears hurt him and Tony knew that the idea that the kid would be suffering for him would torment his nightmares until the end of his days, but he couldn't be totally in that situation when his mind also focused on the feeling of betrayal for not having his wishes respected even when he was dying.
Rhodey was in charge of handling the Avengers' return to the compound and Tony thanked him for that, because he knew that Rhodey was hurting too. His legs were still a burden in his thoughts, even if Tony had made the best prosthesis anyone could get, Rhodey still blamed Sam — and Tony still blamed himself.
Tony looked at her for the first time since she entered the room and something Pepper must have seen there because her features have turned dark.
Because see Steve, in all his glory, knowing that he would never be good enough for him, hurt, but he knew that seeing him with his other soulmate would tear Tony apart, in a way or another, because Barnes would have what Tony couldn’t. Because Barnes would love Steve and Steve would love him back.
Rhodey did not comment on the situation and Tony insisted on training even more with Peter, demanding more of the boy, more of himself, as if that would remove the shadow of pain that filled the youngest's eyes every time he looked at him.
Clint nodded, one of the first reports they received was that Tony was covering for Barton's family and that they were safe, which obviously added another weight to Clint's shoulders.
Which was strange because Steve still couldn't really be with him, not as he should, not as the one who carried his soul mark in the center of his back should be. Not the way they were before.
The journey back to the United States was silent and long. In the jet, the mood was heavy and nobody looked at anyone.
And he could stop shivering, even if there was no more snow, even if Bucky would hug him, trying to warm his body.
He buried himself in his armors, upgrading it and forcing himself not to think, not in his inevitable death that seemed to approach fast, not in his friends, not in the ones that weren't his friends anymore, and primordially, he tried very hard not to think in his soulmates.
Steve threw up every time he thought about it. Shuri even offered to have him examined, but Steve knew that wasn't a problem, not with his health.
It made him feel like shit, but it was better then to fight his only friends, so Tony toke all the anti-depressives and the drugs for his heart, even if not always in the right hour, or, in some cases, like the pain medicine, in the right quantity, he had a tendency to take more than what was indicated on the prescription.
The mark that was the same as Steve Rogers and James Barnes, two dead war heroes, the mark that Howard hated as much as he hated Tony, the mark that his mother hated too because she thought it was creep and that it symbolized something wrong with Tony’s soul, it meant that he was trying to be in between someone else's relationship, the purest, perfect and full of love relationship, the most historical one that was displayed in every damn historical book, and they ware dead.
But it hurt anyway, even if Pepper kept telling him how pride he was of him. It hurts to know that Steve had crashed his heart and that would be it. It made his stomach hurt and his head felt dizzy, but Pepper still felt proud of him, so at last, he knew that he must be doing something right.
And he almost did it, Tony wished he could have done it, it would be simpler and it would be less bad than doing it on his own, it would hurt Rhodey and Pepper less, it would direct their anger at someone other than Tony.
Because after a while it was easy to see that he was anything but arrogant. All the sarcasm being just another form of armor that he used to hide his own weaknesses.
Rhodey was also very present for a while, but Tony thought it was because of the prostheses, with which he was still getting used to, then Tony find out that he also knew, always knew. Since MIT.
The cold never went away, it lessened, but it was always there, even in the sunlight, reminding him of his biggest sin, his biggest mistake in the huge list of unforgivable mistakes he had made during his life.
Ok, first, I need you guys to understand one thing: English is not my first language, so my vocabulary is not the best and sometimes I won't achieve the feeling that I want to, not just that, but maybe some phases will be very hard to understand, so if you are reading and you are like "oh my, what is this" tell me so I can correct it o/
While looking at the ceiling, Tony asked himself if it wasn't better to just let the bad thoughts flow, maybe someday he would gather the courage to finish everyone suffering because Tony knew that he was just avoiding the inevitable.
The adrenaline of fighting in scenarios created by Friday with nanotechnology with Peter was somewhat invigorating.
"I know what you're doing, Mr. Stark" She started to approach, but her voice was sweet, as well as her eyes. She no longer looked like she had been crying for hours every day, there was something soft around her eyes "and I think you do too."
Tony just scoffed at him and laughed because yeah, this shit is getting old and he just wants to go home.
“Why are you so complicated?” Steve whispered to the canvas. His arm wasn’t raised ready to brush but it was lowered in surrender and defeat. “I could never get you right.”
Steve was walking down the hall then an office door opened and he literally ran into one Peggy Carter.
“How are you here?” she asked, getting straight to the questions and looking for answers. Typical Peggy Carter.
“Your shoes untied.” Tony snorted and then he remembered he wasn’t technically among the living and would huff in annoyance. Steve however would sniff and bend over to tie his shoe as if he heard Tony.
First stop was going back to the camp in New Jersey back in the 70s Tony was pretty amused at how horrible Steve was at lying to try to get the stone back where it was, given that he actually didn’t know where the tesseract was in the first place.
He attended his funeral, he still doesn’t actually know where his body is, but he stood by Steve’s side and luckily he could rest a hand on Peter’s shoulder as the boy cried. He saw Morgan and Pepper together and knew that they were strong and would be alright.
“I have several different ways I am able to transport the case to Mr. Stark without physical contact.”
“Thanks” Steve said in reply with a single tear streaming down his face, and Tony feeling like his celestial body is thrumming with energy.
Time stone was as simple as a stop by the sanctum. And that was it. Before the old wizard lady stopped Steve and Tony from leaving.
The mind stone was quicker, Steve just stuck it in a case lying around the tower, which he broke into and actually spoke to Jarvis. But this only happened after Tony spent five minutes watching Steve mutter and disregard ideas to himself.
It was Steve. Tony could feel his soul pulling him toward the man who broke down onto his knees and nearly started crying over a won battle.
They reached the top and Steve took a minute to allow his legs to slightly rest and he pulled out the soul stone holding it in his bare palm. He stared at the stone and slowly began stepping forwards until a voice called out to them.
It wasn’t Pepper. God he already misses her, but she had always respected his decisions regardless of how dumb they were. It wasn’t his best friend who had already spent a lifetime with him. And it wasn’t Peter who only had a few precious years to get to know Tony. The boy was already too familiar with loss.
“How may I assist you, Captain Rogers?” the clear voice answered. Tony smiled at the familiarity of the AI while a grin brightened Steve’s face. Tony’s heart tightened at the sight.
“No, its June fifth, 1970. Howard just got back, should I get him?” Peggy took out a device that looked like an early phone but before she could do anything with it, Steve stopped her.
Steve would go to bed and Tony would be sitting on the floor beside the bedside hoping to fall asleep or entertain himself. Sometimes he fell asleep, other times he somehow still had nightmares.
The first thing Tony noticed was that his soul unconsciously followed Steve Rogers around everywhere. If Tony wanted to go somewhere else, he just couldn’t. He was pretty much stuck next to Steve’s side until the man decided he was done mourning Tony Stark.
Steve was frozen, he couldn’t move. There was a tinge of red on his cheeks and his eyes told Tony a story of longing that could make his ghostly heart nearly hurt.
At this point Tony just allowed himself to get dragged along with Steve’s body. He didn’t listen to the conversations, because why would he? He’s dead it wouldn’t really matter. He watched Steve blush and Peggy smile and he also watched the anxiety creep over Steve because he knew that this would last and he would have to leave. Nothing could stop the jealousy from flooding Tony and the mourning that clearly engulfed Steve all over again when the stone was put back and the two said their goodbyes.
There, right there was Peggy Carter and Tony could facepalm because he suddenly knew that this task was going to get drawn out longer than it needed to.
“Long story, time travel.” Steve said as if that would explain anything. Tony rolled his eyes. “I may need you help.” he then pulled the space stone out of his pocket with his gloved hand and held it out towards Peggy. “This is the tesseract, earlier I came here and stole it and I need to put it back.”
Steve straightened and pulled his shield out immediately pocketing the stone getting ready to pounce on the speaker.
“Mr. Rogers.” she said clearly catching his attention. “You may have to watch what you do, you never know who may be paying attention to your actions.” Tony froze and looked at the woman and waved and smiled when he got the slightest motion of a hand back.
When Tony was finally ripped from his body he was still present. He saw his corpse lying a few feet from him but he stood there and watched the scene play out before him. There was a pulling on his very soul trying to tear him from the earth but there was a deep presence of mourning and denial that continued to drag him down.
The day quickly approached where Steve had to return the stones about a week after the funeral. Tony totally forgot that there were death rocks sitting around that needed to be put back. Also, he noticed that the wait was caused by a new healthy and alive Hank Pym creating more particles. Tony watched Steve decline Sam’s help and give his goodbye to Barnes. Then while Tony was expecting to be left behind since he was not in possession of time travel equipment, the machine started and Tony was being dragged along with Steve.
He snapped and as he felt his breathing get shorter and heart slow down, he watched Peter cry over him and Rhodey give him a sad smile. He listened as Pepper told him it would be alright and he really believes her for the rest of his ending life because he loves her so much.
“You always over analyze, there’s a bigger picture and your focusing on the small things, Steve.” Tony dragged a ghost hand over the painting and stared at Steve’s conflicted face. “It looks amazing Steve,” Tony tried to reassure Steve of his painting.
“No, no. I just need to know where the lab is.” Steve asked urgently, some people in lab coats walked by and Peggy dragged Steve to the side and Tony just stayed in the middle of the hallway watching Peggy and Steve interact. It was like a beautiful reunion scene in a romance movie where Tony suddenly no relation to the person he loved and all he could do was stand by and watch as the protagonist ran back to the past.
Tony would tell him where to go but Steve would go the exact other way because being a ghost sucks. Steve was in a hallway with a bunch of doors which lead into peoples offices. Then Steve took the stairs to a lower level and walked around until he somehow found a science-y looking lab.
“Thank you, Tony.” Steve said and Tony froze in place, but Steve still did not acknowledge his astral presence.
“Face it captain, you cannot try to finish me anymore. I am not among the living, just as your friend beside you. I know what you came here to do.” Shmidt said before he faded out and Steve was left with the stone in his palm and one Tony Stark beside him.
Well, whatever was left to make right. In between the five years they seemed to rebuild the bridge and strengthen it because their friendship became more solid as time grew on. They still had their cold moments but every time after they forgave each other, nothing seemed so bad to keep them apart.
Then there was noise and Steve blocked it out as he tried to greive, then there were warm arms being wrapped around him and he froze before looking up into the warm smile being given to him.
“Still by your side Rogers.” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear when they started travelling to a new location.
When Steve returned to the compound, he was alone besides Bruce, Sam and Bucky waiting there for him. He walked off of the platform and dropped onto one knee. Tears gathered into his eyes and his head was bowed.
Anybody else would have thought all of that was just weird, but not Steve. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that the 20th century had turned out to be a fairly enriching experience – as well as stressing, but that had already been left behind – and Steve had learned not to be shocked by anything anymore, not when he was living in a free world where everything, everything, seemed to be possible.
But Clint being moody wasn’t such a big deal, the problem arose when Clint slipped into his little headspace while he was feeling like that. He got extremely cranky and fussy, and no matter what Phil did, say or suggested, Clint disagreed just because. As he was doing right now. The good thing was that Phil knew exactly what to do to handle this situation: putting Clint down for a nap. And that was exactly what Phil was planning on doing after Clint finished eating, because Clint would never be able to fall asleep if he was hungry.
“Anthony!” Steve yelled, startling Tony. "What did you do that for?” he asked with a reprimanding tone of voice. Tony felt a clutch of panic in the pit of his stomach.
And denying that part of him consumed a lot of his time and energy. Perhaps that was why for a while he had been a mess of a highly-functional alcoholic.
Before his brain had time to register what he was doing, Tony rushed to the bed and pushed Clint off Steve’s lap, sending him to the floor. Phil hurried to his side and helped him sit up.
“I know kiddo, I promise I’ll play with you as soon as Tony finishes his juice,” Steve had promised, without knowing it would take Tony a suspicious amount of time to do that. And when the juice was finally all gone, Tony claimed he was still thirsty.
“Oh, sorry,” Steve apologized, loosening his grip. “Are we OK?” he asked after several minutes, placing his hands on Tony’s upper arms and pushing him slightly away from him, wanting to see his face.
For instance, right now, Tony would have gone upstairs to look for Steve instead of lying on the couch in his workshop staring at the roof for more than thirty minutes, unable to focused on anything. But he had to stay right where he was because he was mad at him, which created a kind of paradox since if Tony weren’t angry with him, he would be able to concentrate which eliminated the reason why he wanted to go and look for him.
daddy. After Tony apologized for what he’d caused, Steve should’ve realized how awful Tony felt, and he should’ve done something about it; after all, daddies were supposed to make their babies feel better.
“I do,” Tony responded, certain that a nod wouldn’t suffice this time, a verbal answer was required.
“Yes, but whatever it is what you’re working on, it’ll stay there until you go back. Why don’t you rest a little? We can hang out, watch a movie,” Steve proposed, knowing Tony almost never turned down an invitation to spend time with him. Tony pursed his lips, and nodded after a few seconds.
Tony looked at the stuffed animal and then at Steve, hesitating. But when Steve moved it closer to his neck and rubbed the Teddy against it, making him giggle almost imperceptibly, Tony took his Teddy away from Steve’s grip and held it tighter against his face, giving him free access to his jeans.
“I’m not allowed to provide that information to you,” the A.I. said, and Steve swore he could hear a hint of discontentment in its voice. “But if you let me give you an advice, Captain, you should talk to Sir. Lately, he seems to be stressing out about something that shouldn’t be that difficult to fix.”
"Hey Tony, shhhh, Tony. It's OK kiddo. It's OK. We can get another one whenever you want. I’ll give you another one, I promise."
The doors of the elevator opened as Tony kept waging war on his own head, reveling Steve. Looking up at him, Tony mentally wished Steve wouldn’t go away, he was certain that having to chase for him would just make him lose his determination and walk back to the workshop.
“Then go and see your boyfriend already, don’t make me drag you to his room,” Natasha warned. There wasn’t the slightest doubt that she’d fulfill that threat, so Tony turned around and walked down the hall. Entering Steve’s room on his own account would be definitely better than being shoved inside. He even stepped up the pace when he heard her groan behind him.
"Well, at the beginning you didn't seem so comfortable with my displays of affection,” Steve recalled. Steve was a hugger, and even if Tony couldn’t deny anymore he liked to be hugged, at the beginning he got all tensed whenever Steve hugged him out of the blue for no reason. “So, can I?” he asked, raising and opening his arms so there was no doubt of what he wanted to do.
And why was that? After a lot of thinking, Tony had come to the conclusion that it was his own fault. Steve was doing a terrific job as a daddy, and even it was obvious he wasn't afraid of pushing things a little, Tony was afraid they would never move forward if he didn't learn to let go, if he let Steve do everything and he didn't do his bit.
“I know sweetpea, I know, but I’m afraid I won’t feel comfortable anymore just deciding for you. This is supposed to be helpful for both of us, and I don't wanna risk doing something you don't really find enjoyable. I told you before, you don't have to be a baby if you don't want to, I’m perfectly alright with looking after a big boy if that’s what you wish to be,” Steve claimed, and he had to bite his lip to hold back the smile that threatened to crinkle his mouth when Tony shook his head shyly, “but even if you’re okay with being my baby, that doesn’t necessarily mean you have to do everything babies do. I mean, I don’t want you to think that only because daddy bought you a crib, now you have no choice but to sleep in it.”
So, if Steve stumbled on a toy when he went into the nursery, or if he saw a book out of its shelf, or a stuffed animal abandoned under some furniture, well, it shouldn’t have been such a big deal; although some of those misplaced objects weren’t the ones the toddler usually played with, he could easily be the one to blame for that. Steve would just pick it up, put it away, and forget about it.
“He did tell you sir, he went down to the workshop yesterday at night while you were working on the new design of the suit and he told you about it. I can show you the footage if you like, sir,” the A.I. offered. Tony could detect a bit of disapproval in his voice. It wasn’t the first time Tony was totally oblivious of something due to being too immersed in whatever he was working on. “Do you want me to try to reach him, sir?”
“No, it’s not. Flowers and chocolates, those are the typical gifts,” Tony said, still refraining Steve to move the fork closer to him.
Steve might not have made up his mind whether to tell Tony about the age play thing or not, but that wasn’t going to stop him from trying to find out how Tony would probably take it. Maybe if Steve tested the waters a little bit before bringing the topic up, he could bring himself to do it. Maybe if he showed Tony slyly how things would be, his chances of getting him to agree would increase.
Shaking off the idea that the elevator was moving up quicker than usual, Tony leaned heavily against one of its walls and rubbed at his temples. What was the matter with him? He’d fought back against terrorists, sociopaths, supervillains, space creatures and even a deemed god. Why on earth couldn’t he go face Steve and put an end to this once and for all?
“I think you know,” Steve said, “the fact that now you’re able to slip into your little headspace doesn’t mean you don’t remember the things you did once you’re out of it,” he hurried to say before Tony could play oblivious.
There were some sofas, a coffee table, the TV, nothing he could really use to knock the door over. His eyes continued looking all over the place, until they laid on a chair, placed in front of the window.  A chair could break the glass of the window. He could jump through the window and, well, he was aware he wasn’t exactly in the first floor, but he could ask JARVIS to send the armor and he was sure the AI wouldn't refute when the alternative of not sending it would cause his death.
Those things were something that should have been of little importance too, and Steve was certain he wouldn’t even have noticed them if he hadn’t started spending so much time in that room. But without being able to help it, he found himself constantly wondering how those things were happening, and after giving it a lot of thought, the only assumption his mind could come to was that somebody was sleeping there. Somebody who smelled just like Tony, because when Steve removed the blanket and pulled the sheets to smell them, Tony’s unmistakable scent was all over them – who else could make motor oil smell so appealing?
“Where are you?” Phil asked as soon as Steve answered the phone, without even giving him the opportunity to say ‘hello’.
And when Steve had thought nothing could make that evening worse, Tony went and had an accident. During all the time they’d age played before Tony decided he wanted to stop, he’d never lost control of his bladder, but of course that had to happen on that very day, because Steve’s luck wasn’t as good as everyone seemed to think it was.
Moodily, he stood from the chair and headed towards the door, sensing how he slipped further into his littlespace, though not completely there yet. Maybe he could hang out with Steve a couple of hours, watch a movie or something, get some cuddles from him to ease his little side’s cravings. There was no real need to tell Steve how he was feeling, besides the fact that Tony wanted and needed to learn how to control this whole little headspace thing, if he told Steve he was feeling little, the chances of him going back to the workshop to finish the paperwork would be non-existing.
Trying to compose himself and overcome his panic, Tony breathed slowly as he gathered enough strength to lift his left leg and swing it over the side of the crib. Unfortunately, the sides were too high and the only thing Tony managed to do was lose his balance and fall flat on his bum. Cursing under his breath, he stood up again, keeping the balance easily this time. He would have to jump all at once, there was no other way. He definitely would hit himself too when he got out if this situation, why on earth had he built the sides too high? He took a jump just to figure how much strength he would need, hating how noisy the diaper sound every time he moved, not to mention how clumsy his movements were because of the damn thing too. Tony would get rid of it as soon as he was out of there, but first, jumping. He flexed both legs a little ready to leap, when the door opened, letting Steve inside the room.
For what he had experienced with Clint, Phil knew littles disliked finding themselves all alone and without their daddies or an adult around. Clint used to cry a lot whenever he slipped into his headspace and Phil wasn’t around, and he wouldn’t stop crying until Phil showed up. That used to devastate Phil enormously, so, when Steve found out about the fact that they were into age play, and showed no signs of being troubled by babysitting, Phil couldn’t have felt more relieved. Now, if Clint needed to spend some time as little, Phil could count on Steve to be there for him if Phil wasn’t.
Then, Steve began to do some other things. Things that made Tony feel uneasy, because, as much as he tried to denied it, he liked them. But it was sure as hell he didn’t want to like them. Being in charge of most of the cooking, Steve started to make cartoon-shaped pancakes, peanut butter sandwiches – his with the crusts cut off – milkshakes, cookies, cheeseburgers, nuggets; all kinds of foods a child would certainly love. It could be said that the others may have found it weird, but they were just glad to eat whatever Steve put in front of them, everything he cooked being too delicious to be declined.
“I’m gonna start charging you every time I have to babysit,” Steve said, eyes still closed. Phil chuckled.
“Sorry baby, but Clint needs me right now, and I can’t change his diapers with you in my arms,” Steve had apologized, though it hadn’t been enough to erase the frown from Tony’s face.
“Come here,” Steve asked, holding out his hand. Tony stared at it doubtfully. “Come,” Steve insisted, stretching his arm as much as he could without standing up.
“Clint, don’t make me go and get you,” Phil warned, making sure his voice was serious enough so Clint didn’t think that was an empty threat.
Tony was tempted to ask him not to go, but he had reached his limit of doing embarrassing things for one day. It didn’t take long for fatigue to overcome him, and he was fast asleep soon after, a tiny smile visible on his face. Steve had just tucked him in, and Tony couldn’t deny it had felt nice.
It turned out Clint had been more temperamental than Phil had told him. When Steve asked him if he wanted to go and watch TV, Clint just shook his head, and he continued doing that at every suggestion Steve gave. For the next thirty minutes, they stayed right there where they were, until Steve decided it wasn’t such a good idea to keep the toddler with damp clothes. After a quick trip to the nursery, Steve settled on the living room couch when Clint willingly sat on his lap once more.
“Of course buddy, you choose,” Phil agreed, wrapping an arm around Clint’s waist so he didn’t slip from his lap.
“Sorry,” Tony mumbled. It sounded like Steve had had some plans, and Tony had ruined them because of the mess he had made.
“Sweetheart, there’s nothing to be jealous about,” Steve promised as he wrapped him up in a hug once more. “Clint is bigger than you, indeed, and it’s true I do different things with him, but that doesn’t mean I get bored with you. I love our play dates, I wouldn’t change them for anything.”
Of course he had made a different dish for him, Steve had given up and stopped trying to convince Tony to change his eating habits a long time ago. Once in a while, he made him eat some fruits, vegetables and stuff like that, but that only happened when Tony had been depending on coffee as his only source of nutrition for days in a row.
I know, this is taking me forever to update, but I've been busy, and I guess not such in the mood, and experiencing writer's block and so many other things that, well, I guess at the end they don't really matter.
Well, I know some people wanted to see Daddy!Steve looking after baby!sick!Tony, but I never planned on focusing on that, so, I apologize n_n'''
A lot of soothing and encouraging were needed to convince Tony to let himself being changed, and by the moue on his face – mirroring Clint’s – Steve could tell Tony wasn’t very happy with the navy blue and white sailor onesie Steve had put on him. But Steve had purchased it not long ago and he had already decided to dress Tony with it the next time they had a play date.
Had Steve planned something exceptional, or was he aiming for something simple for the first time they were going to give Age Play a try? Steve was not one to squander money, he barely used the credit card Tony had given to him, arguing he had everything he needed there in the Tower. However, when it was about Tony, Steve wanted to spare no expense. Therefore, if Steve showed him he had installed a complete playset in one of the unused floors of the Tower, Tony wouldn’t be surprised.
“You see, I’d be a good daddy, I got my child to do as he’s being asked,” he pointed out, earning a playful punch from Tony, clearly failing to see the true meaning behind Steve’s words.
“I know sweetheart, but we have to,” Steve said. The wriggling that endearment caused didn’t go unnoticed. “Why did you push Clint that way?”
However, it's a short chapter, but I guess I'll keep them like that because if I don't, I know it will take me longer to update.
“Did you wash your hands?” Steve asked when Tony reemerged from the bathroom. Tony nodded shyly while he pulled his t-shirt trying to cover himself. What for? Steve didn’t know, he had seen him naked more times than he could remember. "Then let's go back to bed," he suggested, stretching out his arm so Tony held his hand.
"No, I haven't finished yet,” Tony deny, making it obvious he didn’t appreciate having been interrupted. “At first I thought somebody else had used the tablet, I couldn't figure out why you'd look for such things," Tony proceeded, his voice calm, though Steve could tell it was false composure. "But then I remembered how weird you've been acting and then everything just made sense."
Because no matter how hard he tried to avoid it, Steve couldn’t help visualizing Tony in Clint’s place. He couldn’t help wishing it was Tony instead of Clint the one who smiled broadly whenever he offered to play something fun; the one who worshipped him just for making him a milkshake – behind his daddy’s back – the one who felt asleep listening to him reading out loud a story; the one who ran away from him, laughing so hard even if Steve hadn’t caught him yet to pin him down and tickle him. He wanted Tony to be the one he could take care of that way.
Hesitating, Steve agreed and made his way to Clint’s floor, anxiety taking over him as he didn’t know exactly what to expect or how to behave. In broad outline, Phil had explained him what this age play situation was like, but he hadn’t really gone into details, and Steve hadn’t asked anything either. Would Clint be himself with the only difference that he’d be wearing a childish attire? Or would he be just as a child was? Would he remember everything related to his adult self or would Steve have to pretend they didn’t know each other and treat him like any adult would treat a child?
However, Steve had ended up doing things differently. What if Tony changed his mind and backed out before getting the chance to experience the whole thing? Steve would have certainly felt disappointed, since he was sure that Tony would like it. It was better to get over and done with it. And fortunately, his plan worked.
Tony squirmed on his seat and tried to ignore him, focusing his eyes on the pizza like if it was the most interesting thing in the world. Those looks were even worse than the others, because those looks were so full of affection and care that got him to feel Little, and that was the last thing he needed when he was still trying to figure out an escape. What if he choked with the pizza? OK, Tony got the feeling that that was one of those not-so-brilliant ideas he usually got in this situations.
Steve went after him again, this time faster, and literally carried him to the chair. He had to repeat this action around fifteen times. Did Tony really think he could get away from him when he wasn’t wearing his armor? He was a genius, he did know that wasn’t possible. He was doing it just to piss him off. And Steve was afraid it was working. Sometimes he ran as soon as he left him sitting down on the chair, sometimes he waited until he was all settled and ready to start eating. Sometimes he even pretended to take the fork to his mouth, before standing up and running.
"No! Not like that!" Tony asked when he felt two fingers being tucked in his pants, pulling them down. He tried to avoid it, grabbing his pants with the hand that wasn't stuck between him and Steve, but the only thing he accomplished was having this hand pinned to his lower back.
He gathered all the items scattered on the bed, placed the onesie and the diaper on Tony’s lap, turned on his heels and walked away to the closet to put back what Tony didn’t seem to want to wear for the time being. When he went back, a thin smile edged his lips, but it was soon replaced by line of confusion between his eyebrows. Tony hadn’t moved an inch.
"Don't run!" Steve ordered, and winced when he heard the sound of a plate clattering to the floor. Good thing that he had served Clint lunch in a plastic plate.
“Maybe I should be a bit bigger,” Tony suggested, voiced muffled. Steve was afraid he said that. He didn’t want Tony to be a toddler like Clint, he wanted Tony to be a baby. If Tony had shown any sign of not liking being a baby, Steve would undoubtedly replan things; but Tony seemed to enjoy it, so Steve didn’t see any valid reason to change that. However, if Tony did want to be a bit older, Steve wouldn’t oppose.
“And if you don’t?” Tony asked, sounding anxious. Perhaps he got the feeling Steve wouldn’t agree with him.
“Pepper told you?” Tone echoed, raising an eyebrow, “Are you freaking stalking me or what?” he demanded, sounding extremely alarmed, but not angry at all.
In spite of himself, Tony stood up and walked towards the elevator after asking JARVIS where Steve was.
Tony stared at him, hands restless and mouth partially open as if to protest, but no words left his mouth.
“So, if you don’t get what you want from me, you’ll go to them? Is that why you’ve been spending more time with Clint?” Tony accused, glaring at him.
If Tony wanted to learn how to play, he figured the only thing he needed to do was to find the correct toy. Steve wouldn’t mind if he played with big boys’ toys, would he? Tony got the feeling that, as long as he didn’t refuse to wear diapers, drink from a bottle or let himself being pampered and babied, Steve wouldn’t mind.
Sorry for taking too much time to update. I've been kind of busy, and then I got obsessed wth watching horror movies (which I don't like, especially because I live by myself, and get scared very easily), but that led me to rewatch IT,and then I got curious about the book since the remake is gonna be released very soon, so I spent all my free time reading the book n_n', which is pretty long!
“I’m getting jealous,” Tony told him in his ear, hugging him from behind, “you’ve been spending a lot of time with Clint lately.”
Going to bed with him almost every night, sharing meals whenever Steve ate at home, showing up on the rare occasions Steve had enough free time to sit down and watch a movie, claiming he was about to take a bath when Steve had announced he was going to do the same. Certainly those things were nothing to write home about, but then Steve remembered all the times he had had to literally drag Tony out of his workshop to make him sleep for more than a couple of hours or eat something besides coffee and junk food, and Steve was convinced the oddness of the situation wasn’t something created by his own paranoia. The fact that Tony was doing all that of his own free will spoke volumes.
On second thought, Steve preferred it when Tony got mad at him, that way he could still believe this wasn’t a lost cause.
That had been exactly what Steve wanted for Tony. That had been exactly why Steve had wanted to give age play a try. It was supposed to be a way for Tony to relax, to forget about everything even if it was only for a short while, to leave aside all his responsibilities and concerns so that he was able to let go, to allow himself to be taken care of, to focus only on being loved. It was true that Tony had progressed a lot since the first time they age played, and he had been clearly getting more used to his role as a baby, but Steve had been afraid that Tony wasn’t really enjoying the experience, that he didn’t know how to slip into that headspace as Clint did.
Tony grumbled, “couldn’t you take it to the workshop with you? Did you really have to make me come all the way here?”
Steve tightened his embrace as he turned his face so he could look at Tony. He smiled, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to smile back, making Steve purse his lips in disappointment. Looking after two kids couldn’t be easy, and Tony understood that. It would actually help if Tony ended this nonsense, stopped pretending to be little, and helped Steve take care of Clint. But he still didn’t want to, and looking at Steve comforting Clint in such a loving way made Tony finally realize why. Tony was jealous. Steve was
Not knowing how or when, Tony must have drifted off to sleep, because the next time he opened his eyes, it was a little darker outside. He rolled onto his back, and was a bit surprised to find out he has hugging Raawry. Perhaps Steve had come when he was asleep and he had put it between his arms – he tended to do that – but when Tony looked around there were no signs of Steve.
It took Tony some seconds to recognize the room where they were in, and Tony blinked at him in confusion as if he still didn’t understand what they were doing there nor what gift Steve was talking about. Steve stepped aside so Tony had a clear sight of the room, and he couldn’t help feeling a little uneasy when Tony’s expression turned blank at the realization of the new acquisitions Steve had gotten for the playroom. Slowly, Tony got closer to the crib, and placed a hand on one of the sides as he took a careful look at all the room.
When they finally were in the middle of Steve’s living room, he dropped him on the sofa not in a very nice way, but not rudely either. Tony didn’t even hesitated to run toward the door once he was free, but the blond guy was already a step ahead of him.
“Come here, kiddo,” Steve called Clint, holding a hand out to him. Clint shook his head before hugging his knees and hiding his face behind them. Steve was starting to get really frustrated because of how many times he had been told ‘no’ that day. “Come on Clint, come here, come here sweetheart.”
Little headspace, Tony had read something about it when he was doing research about Age Play. It was supposed to be a mindset in which an adult relaxed into a state of carefree, responsibility-free safety, and act of regressing into a childlike state. The problem was that Tony hadn’t really read anything about how to slip into such a mindset, nor how one knew one was already there. The triggers were supposed to be different for everyone, as well as the sensation.
First, Steve had had to calm Clint down, as using his diaper had caused him a second meltdown. In order to do that, Steve had picked him up and rocked him, which was only possible after putting Tony down on the bed. Tony hadn’t liked that at all, and Steve ended up with two crying littles, one demanding to be allowed to leave and another one demanding to be scooped up.
Even if there had been no scolding, Clint had begun to cry as soon as Steve asked him what had happened. Before he could stop him, Clint ran to the bathroom and locked himself in, calling for his daddy. Steve knocked on the door persistently, assuring Clint he wasn’t mad at him at all, and promising he would order another pizza provided Clint let him in first, with no luck. In between sobs, Clint had told him that he didn’t want another pizza, he wanted his daddy and he wanted to go.
That was the first time Tony had a panic attack in front of Steve. How could his father do such a thing? Why on earth did Howard keep a diary? Why on earth one of the things he wrote down had to be the fact that his son wanted to wear diapers and be babied? Why did Howard think it was a good idea to record every single thing he did in order to get his son to stop wanting that? Why on earth had Howard kept that diary among Steve’s belongings? Tony knew Captain America had been the only one who Howard had completely trusted until the end, but leaving him his diary, what had been the fucking purpose of that?! Leaving something to someone who was thought dead was nonsense! It was a fact that his father never believe Captain America was dead, but even so it was illogical! Captain America had been his childhood hero, for God’s sake! And finding out that he knew about his dirty little secret because of his father was just something Tony couldn’t bear.
Hence, there was the problem. Tony wanted to things at the same time. He wanted Steve to leave him alone, and he wanted Steve to hug him and tell him everything was all right. He wanted Steve to back off every time he asked him to, but he was more than happy that Steve always stick around no matter what. He got mad at Steve for subtly pushing him into his Little mindset, but, at the end of the day, when they were watching a movie and Tony was well settled on Steve's lap, he would be grateful for being pushed. Tony wanted to tell Steve how thankful he was for getting involved in this, but he also wanted to shout at him to tell him to stop sticking his nose where it didn’t belong.
“Look, I’m not trying to make you uncomfortable, but if there’s something bugging you, I’d like to know so I can fix it. Is there something bugging you?” Tony shook his head, maybe a bit too soon. Steve pursed his lips. “Come here,” he asked, holding out his hand.
“You and I both need to work on our communication skills,” Steve informed after several seconds, “it’s more than obvious that we still are terrible at communicating.” Tony couldn’t refute that. Both of them had complicated everything unnecessarily. Had they talked about what they wanted since the beginning, things might have gone smoother. “I really have to go and see how Clint’s doing, if he’s alone too much time, he’s going to hide in the vents and he’s going to get scared because they’re too dark and will refuse to move until either Phil or me go and get him,” Steve said. Tony would have found the scene of Phil and Steve trying to coax Clint to go out of the vents funny if he hadn’t been to mortified because of Steve’s departure.
Steve flopped down onto the bed, feeling uncharacteristically exhausted. Changing Clint’s and Tony’s diaper had turned out to be a real ordeal.
Truth to be told, Phil didn’t want to have to climb inside the vents. He had done it before, so he knew the only thing he’d manage to do would be hurting his knees due to having to chase Clint all over the air vents. Phil wasn’t as agile as him. He could go to another room and climb into a vent there and take Clint by surprised from the opposite end, but Clint already knew that trick and he would jump down from the vent before Phil could even reach him.
Stark growled and pushed him off. Steve rolled with it, not wanting to push too far or too fast when Stark was still an unknown quantity, but Stark just seized the opportunity to pounce on
Steve got vocal, letting all the little noises he might have otherwise held back spill out of him. Tony clearly wanted to know when he was doing well. Tony adapted to every cue Steve gave him in real time, until Steve really couldn’t have held anything back even if he’d
Stark appeared in the doorway, arms folded, still naked and with dripping wet hair. “You have something against bed frames?”
Tony fought like a man who’d always been smaller and fucked like he was being graded. Something to prove,
Steve just moved against him at first, working them both up. There was no real hurry. Steve’s body was greedy for everything he could get, but he’d learned control during the war, and it was no hardship to slow down enough to appreciate Thor sprawled out before him like a lion, lazy and golden. Thor was powerful enough to take his own strength for granted. It showed in the sculpted musculature of his shoulders and thighs, the patience he had with Steve’s teasing even once they were both hard and leaking, and finally the effortless way he lifted Steve by the hips and held him suspended when Steve kept rutting slowly against him instead of taking him inside.
Tony summoned up his courage and shuffled forward. His hand reached out, retreated, reached out again, and hovered an inch above Steve’s shoulder. Steve waited, the only movement his chest rising and falling as he breathed.
“I hope you don’t expect me to eat all of this myself,” Tony said, eyebrows raised. Steve just gave him an expectant look until Tony picked up a roll and started chewing.
about coming back to help with the clean-up. It wasn’t until they were back inside Stark’s penthouse, the wormhole closed, the nuke dispatched, and the architect of the invasion still lodged in a Loki-shaped crater in the floor, that Steve noticed his body was running warm.
Steve didn’t have to tell her to go ahead take what she wanted; she read it straight off his face. Her hands pinned his wrists above his head as her smile went wider.
Eye-to-eye (mostly--even kneeling, Steve had a couple inches on Tony), he didn’t seem quite so intimidating. The frown had smoothed out of his forehead and left his face calm and open. He was still talking, in a steady pace that didn’t demand a reply. Tony thought of the nonsense babble he’d used many times before to soothe nervous horses new to the household stables. Skittish colt, skittish virgin; Steve must not see much difference.
Sam beckoned him along to the shoreline where men were streaming onto the waiting boats, giving Tony a nod before they left. Tony noted that Sam, at least, understood more of their language than he could speak. Or more than he
Steve’s first touch was gentle. He cupped Tony’s cheek, still holding his gaze. His palm was warm. Tony could smell him now, the alpha scent rising from his skin, unfamiliar but not off-putting. Most importantly, Steve didn’t smell angry. Tony hadn’t fucked this up yet.
It was more than just fear making his heart pound now, and Steve would be able to smell the arousal rising from the thin skin above his pulse. “How are we doing?” Tony asked, watching Steve press the tip of his nose to Tony’s wrist. “Do I pass the smell test?”
His face flamed as Steve untied the rope that crossed his groin and wound around his ass to meet the rope at his wrists. Steve held the rope away from the fragile skin between his legs before pulling, making sure that no friction rubbed against Tony’s entrance. It wasn’t physical pressure, but Tony imagined he could feel the weight of Steve’s gaze on parts he’d barely looked at himself. The heightened awareness that Steve could
Tony was glad to have made his own evaluation before the servant showed him to Stane’s office. It made it easier to stand there and be talked over like he wasn’t in the room while Stane and his advisors made frantic plans to convene a peace summit on an hour’s notice, like being there was his own idea. Like he had some measure of control over what was going to happen next. He didn’t usually allow himself the comfort of illusions, but lying to himself was better than falling into blind panic.
Tony broke off sharply when Steve moved. He almost pulled his hand back, but Steve didn’t try to grab him. He just rolled his head towards Tony’s hand, nostrils flaring as his nose got within a couple inches of Tony’s wrist. It was Tony’s turn to hold still while he tried to get his heart rate to slow.
Steve considered him for a moment and sighed; at least some of Tony’s point must have gotten across. He rolled onto his side, folded both hands together under his head, and closed his eyes, then opened them and raised his eyebrows in a question.
Tony’s breath caught. The sensation itself was light, the pressure barely there, but knowing what that touch was going to lead to had him clenching up tight, his heart racing in anticipation of pain.
created this problem,” he said, pointing at his own hard cock before jabbing a finger at the tent in Steve’s pants, vaguely aware that he wouldn’t have dared to do this an hour ago but too caught up in his indignation to work up any real alarm. “It’s
“Foreplay is an art,” Tony informed him, but he slid back up when Steve pulled at his biceps. “Fine, fine, rush job it is, but don’t think this is my best work.”
Steve stared down at him, his lips reddened and his cheeks flushed. He didn’t look so carefully controlled anymore. His nostrils flared with his next heavy breath, and his eyes moved to Tony’s cock, now bobbing stiff and red above his belly.
After a few minutes of searching, Steve made a satisfied noise and came back with an armful of blankets and cotton. There must have been a linens chest included with the rest of the tribute; with a pang, Tony recognized the wobbly flowers on the sheets he’d embroidered himself. The flowers had started out as gears, until his tutor had reviewed his work and made him go back and add petals and leaves. They were supposed to be part of his marriage trousseau, something he’d bring to his husband’s household. It made sense that they’d been sent along with him now. This was as close to marriage as he was ever going to get.
“I daresay he’ll learn to manage without me,” Jarvis said, sounding supremely unconcerned. “Lord Wilson, if you could show me where I might stow the rest of Master Stark’s things?”
He didn’t know the Captain at all, except by bloody reputation, and he knew nothing of the Captain’s homelands except that they were far away by sea. As Ty’s omega, he would have at least been able to bring a retainer of people he trusted. He would have known the language. He would have known how to keep Ty happy. He couldn’t even
those things, but his want would never be stronger than his caution. He didn’t need bait; he only needed an open door.
She came forward quickly and gracefully, keeping her footing with ease as she walked across the shifting ground of the mattress and blankets. Steve propped himself up on an elbow to meet her in a kiss, her hands rising to cup the sides of his throat.
“See?” Natasha dragged Clint onto the mattress like he was a training dummy, dropping him into a stack of pillows before lounging sideways across his lap. “They’re doing fine.”
“I would be happy to join you for another.” Thor pulled his tunic off and laid back with his arms folded behind his head, looking up at Steve invitingly. “Do as you will.”
The slow, steady movement of Bruce’s hand never wavered. Steve only knew when Bruce was close because his body started to show his rising tension, his thigh muscles contracting and then releasing as he forced himself back to relaxation. It was fascinating to watch. Steve wanted to do more to help somehow, because it looked
A touch of green in Bruce’s irises, there and gone. Bruce closed his eyes and slowed the hand stroking his cock even further. “Tony was right,” he said ruefully. “You
Anything else he might have said was lost to the roaring in Steve’s ears, his body enthusiastically giving itself over to to his heat. He took a sharp satisfaction in being full, in the rhythm of Tony’s hips, in the scent of sweat and steel rising from Tony's skin, in how well their bodies were working together, Tony rising to meet Steve’s goading and speeding up when Steve arched impatiently under him.
Stane addressed him directly only once before the summit started. He stopped Tony outside the banquet hall where the Captain’s men were waiting, took his wrist in a punishingly hard grip, and spoke quietly enough that nobody else in the delegation heard. “I hope I can count on you to do what needs to be done.”
He was a very nice place to sit, at least. He’d traded the armor and cape for a loose tunic unlaced halfway down his chest. Steve closed his teeth lightly over Thor’s collarbone, then moved to his throat and bit hard enough to mark, feeling smug about the way it made Thor’s hips twitch up.
“Kind of a big fight,” Steve said dryly. He checked in on the others; Romanoff looked calm, Barton thoughtful, both of them standing close to each other and a little apart from the others. Banner had a red flush climbing up his neck and was avoiding everyone’s eyes, but apart from the blush that was normal for him, from what Steve could tell. Thor just looked nonplussed.
people, even if he knew once he presented that he’d never rule them himself. He was still a Stark, and Starks were made of iron.
“Oh,” Tony said, relief and excitement washing through him. “Yeah, okay. This is good. This is great.”
, Tony thought, locking onto his new target, who was currently receiving concerned back-slaps from Steve. The archer waved him off and straightened.
They hit a stalemate over Steve’s pants. Every time Tony went near them, his anxiety surged until Steve blocked his hands and redirected them to safer territory. After the third failed attempt to hurry things along to their inevitable conclusion, Tony sat back and raised his hands in exasperation. “Look, it’s my first time, I’m going to be nervous, okay? I’m not getting any more relaxed tonight than this. This is it. Are we doing this or what?”
Steve reminded himself that tackling Thor to the floor right then would be counterproductive. He reached out for Barton instead, warmed by the easy way Barton stepped into his arms. Barton’s head dipped down to rest on his shoulder. There was a slice on Barton’s scalp that had matted a section of his hair with blood, the smell metallic against his solid healthy beta scent and the salty dried sweat on his neck. Steve barely restrained himself from licking the cut clean. That wasn’t really sanitary, no matter what his instincts were insisting, and there were better ways available to care for his people. He kissed Barton’s temple instead, laying a line of soft touches across his cheek until Barton raised his head and made his lips available.
The others had all gone quiet, apart from the soft rasp of sleeping breaths, and the air was full of the scent of satiation. Everyone had gotten what they needed. Steve let his eyes slip shut.
“I--what?” Tony squirmed a little, and Steve let him wiggle but put a hand on his back when Tony tried to pull away. Tony slumped back down and Steve made a satisfied noise. “Seriously,
“Ah,” Thor said politely. Steve wondered if that was his default response whenever Earth’s sexual dynamics came into play. “Do you require privacy?”
to prove. They communicated just fine like this, Tony’s body so much easier to understand than his speech, insights coming easily as Steve concentrated on Tony’s reactions. Tony was paying just as much attention,
Not that the clothes really mattered. Tony was the one who was bound by ropes and promises, Tony was the one who’d come here and knelt and held still while he was trussed up like a virgin sacrifice. Steve wasn’t bound to any oaths regarding Tony’s care at all, and Tony was in no position to bargain for any.
. Tony could read a mirror of his own relief in the way Jarvis’ shoulders loosened at finding him unharmed. “With the assistance of the Captain’s men, I was able to bring some of your possessions along with my own.”
“That’s cheating,” he said, distantly aware that his voice had gone slow and drawling. His wrists were still tied together at the small of his back, but he could finally stretch out his legs. He kicked his feet out slowly, leaving him sprawled awkwardly across Steve’s lap, his chest and thighs draped over Steve’s legs while his body went limp. “That is absolutely cheating,
nice with his free hand that made it a bit hard to concentrate, but he made the effort to reach out and pat Banner’s knee, reassuring rather than lascivious. “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. Victory heats are intense. Sometimes it’s too much. You’re welcome to stay and watch, if that’s all you want.”
Only one way to find out. Tony swallowed hard, trying to ignore the fresh wave of anxiety at knowing he was taking a risk, that this might prompt Steve to decide foreplay was over and it was time to take whatever he wanted. He dragged a finger through the slick on his thighs and reached for his entrance.
Jarvis hummed and indicated that Tony should hold still with a fingertip on his shoulder. The ropes encasing his legs and everything in between them were all in place now, thank God, and they were onto the safer territory above Tony’s waist, Jarvis’ hands heartbreakingly gentle as he finished the bindings. Stane had sent one of his personal servants to do the work of getting Tony ready, but Jarvis had blocked the tent’s opening and said “I shall attend to Master Stark,” with such icy civility that the servant had bowed out without a word of argument. The servant had left a book instead, the page open to the rope design Jarvis was faithfully replicating. As embarrassing as it was, Tony was glad it was Jarvis and not a stranger applying the ritual bindings. Jarvis’ hands had never hurt him.
Romanoff, after a glance at him, took over. “When an omega leads a group of warriors to victory, if those warriors are already close to the omega or if the battle was especially great, the omega will sometimes go into heat.”
Steve grinned back at him and scruffed Tony’s hair. Tony pulled out slowly, as though Steve might be sore, which was considerate but not necessary. Steve wasn’t sore. Steve was
“No emergency,” Steve said. He wished he still had his helmet on, something to at least give his face partial cover, but putting it back on now would be ridiculous. “It’s just. We won.”
He must have, because Steve’s eyes went heavy-lidded with his next deep inhale. Tony felt that same jolt low in his belly he’d felt when Steve scented him before. This time, with Steve sprawled out below him, ostentatiously unthreatening, it wasn’t followed by panic. Tony licked his lips.
“I’m not really enjoying being the only one naked, here, let’s go for something more balanced. Can you take your tunic off?” Tony mimed pulling a shirt over his head. Steve caught on immediately, rolling up enough to pull his tunic over his head by the hem. He tossed it towards the tent flap to land near the rest of his clothes and laid back down again. “Good, thank you. And wow, shoulders. Congratulations on those.”
“See, you say that like it’s a euphemism, but I know you, Captain Rogers. You’ll lure me in by batting those big blue eyes and then feed me biscuits instead of taking off your pants.”
“Enough for round one.” Steve slid down far enough to ruck up Thor’s tunic and slide his hands up Thor’s thighs and stomach. Thor was wearing
“Oh, sure,” Tony said, talking fast in a futile attempt to cover his nerves, as though Jarvis of all people couldn’t see through him. “He’s a great folk hero, as long as he’s raiding someone
“You should be honored,” Stane had told him, after the summit had ended and the Captain had withdrawn from the hall back to his campgrounds outside the city. “I know it’s not what we’d hoped for for you, Tony, but with this sacrifice you’re saving the city.”
“A worthy custom,” Thor murmured, his arm curling around Steve’s back. “I thank you for honoring me with it.”
him made him realize that at some point he’d started to get wet, and that was. Perfect. That was just fantastic. Leaking for an alpha who’d barely touched him was a great way to establish a sense of dignity and cultivate respect, because nothing said “please take me seriously and treat me like I’m not just here for you to fuck” like getting slick when he wasn’t even in heat.
It was too good to trust, too close to what he’d always wanted, but--for now, at least, he’d let himself believe it was true. That Steve was willing to learn for him. That Steve wanted to know what Tony had to say. That Steve only wanted from him what Tony wanted to give. If Tony was wrong, he’d find out, and there wasn’t anything he could do in the meantime to change that. For now, he followed the tug of his alpha’s hand, and let Steve pull him into their shared future.
Tony bit the side of his tongue, hard, the pain enough to distract him from the memory before he did something appalling like beg Jarvis not to leave him. He wasn’t a child anymore. He was saving his city. He could do this.
“It’s a victory heat,” he said, and stopped there, because he’d learned that people in the future had different vocabulary for everything to do with sex, and the words that came most naturally to him sometimes made people wince.
Steve didn’t say anything as Tony crossed the tent and dropped his blankets next to Steve’s, and Tony kept his head down to avoid his eyes. He laid down on his side about a foot away from Steve, close enough to feel Steve’s body heat on his back before he pulled the blanket over himself.
There was some kind of alarmed noise from the bathroom as Steve whipped past the doorway, but he didn’t have time to investigate. Stark was gaining fast, bouncing off furniture and taking shortcuts as Steve went deeper into the penthouse, flying through rooms and looping back around, building a mental map as he ran. Steve could have outrun him, but that wasn’t the point.
to work with you, here. I’m just trying to make sure you get what you want and I get hurt as little as possible in the process, which would be a lot easier if you would
“Then go ahead. You can come a little closer, get comfortable, and I’ll stay right here. I won’t grab.”
“Pleasure’s all mine,” Steve replied, his voice already blurring with sleep. He was distantly aware of Thor picking him up and carrying him to the bed some time later. His packmates rolled in around him, their blended scent heavy and soothing, and Steve let his awareness drop with a feeling of perfect safety.
, his own cock barely softened, his eyes moving to the rest of his teammates even as Tony disengaged and collapsed onto his back next to him. They were all watching him, Banner with cautious fascination, Clint with bright interest, Natasha with an unreadable expression. Steve smiled at all three of them and extended a hand to Natasha.
Steve smiled at him, looking at least half as relieved as Tony felt. He worked his pants off his hips and down his knees, taking whatever smallclothes he was wearing down at the same time. His erection sprang free and slapped against his stomach, and holy shit, how had there been enough room in Steve’s pants to hide that thing?
Bruce was still kneeling at the mattress’ edge, watching Steve with eyes gone heavy-lidded. His cock was straining upwards between his thighs. Both of Bruce’s hands were pressed flat against his thighs, although his fingers flexed as soon as Steve looked at him.
Steve braced his feet, but otherwise didn’t try to move, letting Natasha set the rhythm. She rode him with languid force, easing into different angles as she chased her pleasure, teasing them both with a handful of perfectly white-hot strokes before shifting into something less overwhelming. Whenever Steve got close, she eased back, perfectly in sync so he didn’t have to strain too much to restrain himself. Bucky had been the same, able to read Steve so well they could fight back-to-back with no words exchanged. After this, Steve could tell that he and Natasha would be almost as well matched, with enough practice.
When the last of the rope gave way, it was immediately replaced by Steve’s hands. Tony held still as Steve rubbed gently at the tender skin of his wrists. Steve said something brief and low-voiced before releasing his hands and rolling Tony onto his back, keeping him centered in his lap.
want to start their...relationship, whatever form it was going to take, by having their first interaction while he was blubbering and naked on his knees. That seemed like a really bad precedent to set.
Jarvis snorted as he adjusted the final knot securing Tony’s wrists. “How could I forget? Move your fingers, please.”
Tony looked down at his body, at all the exposed skin on display between elaborate frames of rope, and thought that conversation was probably not destined to play a large role in his relationship with the Captain anyway. Maybe not being able to understand each other would be more of an advantage than a drawback. Tony’s mouth got him into even more trouble than his mind, and if the Captain couldn’t understand him well enough to be annoyed at what he was saying, Tony would probably be safer. Not that he couldn’t find some way of disappointing the Captain anyway. It seemed to be Tony’s specialty.
“I really hope that was approval and not some kind of critique. It’s your own fault, you know. How else am I supposed to react to an alpha getting so close and--and touching me and smelling good and looking at my--at my everything. It’s just biology, it doesn’t
When he passed the bathroom again he got a flash of Clint standing with a towel over his head, Banner's concerned face, and Natasha with her hand on Banner's arm. Clearly Banner wasn’t going to play chase. No matter; Stark was charging up behind him, close enough to make Steve’s blood surge.
“Yeah, okay, I got that,” Tony snapped, and then immediately stiffened, fighting the urge to cringe away. He darted a fast look at Steve’s face, but Steve didn’t look angry, only--sad? Whatever it was, his face went expressionless a moment later.
.” Tony hoped whoever was in charge of cleaning Steve’s gear had some kind of trick for scent masking, because everything in the tent was going to be
Steve dug his teeth in a fraction, then let go, satisfied that Thor had accepted his rebuke. He would have liked to have more of a tussle--Thor would be a joy to wrestle with, skilled and beautiful in motion and able to stand up to every bit of Steve’s strength--but Thor was relaxed under him, content to lounge under Steve while he did all the work.
“Is your choice?” one of the Captain’s men, the stocky archer with blond hair darker and scruffier than the Captain’s own, had asked when they met Stane's procession at the edge of the camp. He’d been the one to translate during the hand-off earlier that day when Stane’s men had hauled in carts of treasure, Tony riding behind them like an afterthought. He’d looked at Tony, not Stane’s men, when he asked. “You come willingly?”
“Master Stark,” Jarvis said quietly, “it has been an honor and a privilege to know you. Until our paths next cross.”
Once the city’s scouts saw the Captain’s sails approaching over the horizon, Tony knew his fate was sealed.
Not that it really mattered. There wasn’t anything Tony could do about it if the Captain lived up--or down--to his reputation. The rope was just a more literal representation of the ways Tony was already bound.
“It won’t be so bad,” Tony said, with every ounce of feigned confidence he could muster. “I always wanted to travel more. Remember when I stole Howard’s biggest atlas and hid it in my room?” He’d gotten belted for that once Howard found out, but Jarvis had never known how far Howard went to discipline his son behind closed doors, so as far as Jarvis was concerned it was just a charming anecdote.
Steve reached out and took Tony’s hand, twining their fingers together while Tony’s eyes widened almost imperceptibly. “I want to, if you do.”
Tony hoped he wasn’t visibly shaking. It wasn’t really that cold in the tent, they hadn’t left the southern lands yet, but night was falling fast and bringing frost with it. Between that and the dread, he couldn’t stop trembling.
Steve smiled at him. His scent had mellowed into something drowsy and satisfied, but his eyes were still attentive on Tony. He dipped his head before he spoke, the tone of his words pleased.
Steve was going to treasure the incredulous expression Stark made in response until the day he died. Before Stark could recover, Steve slid past him through the doorway and took off down the hallway. A moment later he heard Stark following at a dead sprint.
“Okay, so.” Tony sat up a little straighter, sitting on his own calves with Steve’s legs bracketing him. “This is happening. Here we go. I have to say, I’d be less nervous about this if you were smaller.” He snuck a look at Steve’s groin, but it was still covered by the tunic and pants Steve wore, hiding whatever Steve was packing. Tony wondered, with fatalistic curiosity, exactly how hard it was going to be to take. He wished he could see it, just so he could plan his approach better.
Tony huffed and settled his head back down, but reached between them to wrap a hand around Steve’s cock. It only took a few firm strokes for Steve to spill over his fist. The pleasure was almost incidental compared to the satisfaction of Tony’s come inside him, and the new certainty he’d gained about how to work with his most outwardly abrasive teammate.
. His previous sorrow and rage over his brother’s crimes had been genuine, as immediate and forceful as his pleasure was now. Steve watched Thor’s eyes close in clear rapture as Steve rolled his hips and thought he understood. Thor lived in the present; what else was there to do, when he had a history weighty enough to crush him if he dwelt in the past?
Tony had tried kissing before: a few times with beta daughters of visiting minor gentry, once with the omega son of a nearby lord. They’d been quick, the beta girls breaking away to giggle and look around to make sure they hadn’t been seen, the omega boy daring to run his hand over the front of Tony’s trousers before they’d both pulled away from the forbidden contact. The sense of danger that came from stealing a kiss away from the watchful eyes of their guardians had been more of a thrill than the kisses themselves.
The move was unexpected enough that it jarred Tony out of his spiraling panic. Steve sat on his heels and kept talking, his voice gentle. His hands were palm up on his thighs.
a busy morning.” Tony stowed the spyglass into its case, then jumped up. Steve’s hands caught him, squeezing his hips and ass as Tony wrapped his thighs around Steve’s waist. Steve took the weight like it was nothing, squaring his stance a little to balance them both on the rolling deck. Tony could trust, the way he had once only trusted Jarvis’ smiles, that Steve would never let him fall. “We’d better go get started.”
“I guess it’s a good thing,” Tony said, a slight tremor in his voice. “It makes things easier, or so I’ve heard. I couldn’t say personally. As you know.” If he
Steve’s lips brushed softly against the side of his throat. Tony tilted his head and let the arm holding the spyglass swing down to his side. “Enough time for breakfast in bed?”
Tony tried. He really did. He spent a long time touching Steve’s shoulders, his arms, his chest, even a daring swipe along his jaw, dangerously close to his throat. Steve’s eyes were dark and intent as he watched, his body tense with whatever instincts he was keeping in check, but he didn’t pounce. Tony was given free rein to touch him. Flares of alpha scent rolled off Steve's skin whenever Tony found a sensitive place to stroke, or whenever Tony’s own arousal spiked. Maybe if Tony had a month to explore, he could have gotten so comfortable with Steve’s body that stroking over the erection tenting Steve’s pants wouldn’t make his own scent sour with nerves, but he only had a night, and he could see how the muscles in Steve’s stomach jumped when Steve was suppressing the urge to move. He didn’t trust that restraint to last.
When he finally had to take in fresh air, he broke the surface of the water and immediately checked in on his teammates. Barton and Romanoff were pressed against the side of the tub, Barton clutching Romanoff’s arm, his head tilted back to rest on her shoulder and his eyes squeezed shut. She pressed kisses against the side of his face while her hand moved slowly under the water. Barton’s arousal was blooming in the humid air, drawing an answering surge of heat from Steve.
Natasha mumbled something in Russian, groped around without opening her eyes, and squeezed Steve’s ankle. Thor let out a window-rattling snore and rolled over, waking Bruce up via landing on top of him. He jerked upright when Bruce reflexively elbowed him in the ribs and rolled off the edge of the mattress with an indignant grumble.
Steve said nothing, but his lips parted as he breathed in again. The scent of Tony’s slick was probably stronger now that he’d spread it around by sitting up. Steve’s eyes half-closed and his own scent flared. Tony gulped as the wave of strong, spicy-hot alpha scent swamped him, the smell of Steve’s interest enough to start a low throbbing between his legs.
, to keep restraint not through tension but through looseness, but the need to not spook Bruce still applied, and he hadn’t invited Steve to touch him. Steve arched his back instead, flaunting his bare throat, making himself a canvas.
He’d have to get used to it. It was colder up north by far, and Tony had come with nothing but the clothes on his back, which Stane’s servant had taken in exchange for the silken ropes that were now his only covering. If the Captain didn’t choose to give him furs and other northman’s clothing, the only time he’d be comfortable might be when he was warming the Captain’s bed. Assuming the Captain let him sleep in a bed.
done this before, and was the kind of person to be curious about anything new. Steve’s blood rose a little in response to Stark’s interest, to the challenge in his voice. Anticipation fizzed through him.
Steve was starting to harden again by the time Thor reached his own climax, but it wasn’t an urgent imperative. His heat was fading, finally satisfied, and he folded himself over Thor without drawing off his cock rather than trying for another orgasm. The contact alone was enough.
The figure was a tall silhouette against the pre-dawn glow of the balcony windows. Steve lunged, bowling the intruder onto his back with a thump, his forearm over the man’s throat and a growl rumbling deep in his own chest.
work. It poured in clear and faintly steaming from three taps at once. He took a moment to admire it, knowing the pristine water would go grimy the minute they stepped into it.
city. Remember the bard last winter, the one Obie kept inviting back to give command performances?” The bard’s tale of the Captain’s siege of Azzano was one of Stane’s favorites, and he’d commissioned performances of it so often that the whole household knew it by heart. Nothing boosted morale like hearing about your neighbors and former rivals getting crushed by the Captain’s merciless barbarian army, apparently.
“Captain soon.” Sam looked over his shoulder, then turned and smiled. It was a nice smile, warm and reassuring. Tony was too terrified to actually
Steve smiled again. It was a nice smile, small and soft, and it lightened his whole face, softening the stern lines by his mouth. Tony concentrated on his face and ignored everything happening in the region of his pants.
Well, now Steve was laughing at him. He was being subtle about it, but the curve of his lips and suspicious tension in his stomach gave him away. That was better than most of the other reactions he could have had to Tony ogling his chest, though, so Tony would count it as a victory.
“Good morning to you, too.” Tony sat up with his blanket clutched around his waist, abruptly self-conscious again. He’d managed to forget about his nudity last night, but the light of day was filtering through the tent seams, reminding him just how much there was of him to see under the blanket. “Are there clothes around here somewhere that I could borrow?”
“Absolutely not,” Tony said, not trying to conceal his outrage. “After all that, you want us to just go to
He took the news with every outward appearance of calm. When the city bells had first rung to sound the alarm, Tony had used a spyglass of his own design, more powerful by a factor of ten than the ones used by the city scouts, to survey the incoming threat. By the time a white-faced servant knocked at his door, Tony had already taken the measure of the Captain’s forces. The Captain’s recent battles against Hydra had doubled the size of his fleet. Some of the captured Hydra vessels still showed traces of red paint where Hydra’s tentacled sigil had been hastily scraped off the sides of the ships by the Captain’s troops. With a weary lack of surprise, Tony recognized that the cannons affixed to those ships matched the city’s own most recent designs. Stane had been busy.
Steve laid down on his side immediately. He left his head propped up on an elbow, but the rest of him rested flat against the tent floor, one leg extended and one knee bent into a comfortable sprawl. His eyes were still on Tony, and he was smiling a little.
“As if I could stop you.” Tony wanted to hug him. He held himself back with the promise of doing it later; they would have time, now, if Jarvis was accompanying him, and after taking Steve’s measure last night, he wasn’t afraid that coming along with them would get Jarvis killed. And Jarvis was already fast friends with Sam, apparently. “What about Stane?”
“Well, since you ask so nicely.” Steve guided Thor’s thick cock to his entrance and sank down, Thor lowering him slowly enough that the stretch was pure satisfaction. Heat kept him plenty open and wet. It was waning now, but he still felt the urge to press close, bracing his hands on either side of Thor’s head and leaning down for slow, melting kisses. Thor returned every brush of lips with ready affection, not shy or constrained at all. Strange that his most alien teammate was also the most straightforward.
“Let’s find out.” Romanoff led him to a bathroom (and how she knew exactly where the bathroom of Stark’s penthouse was, Steve wasn’t going to ask). Some concrete dust had blown in under the door and the wall-length mirror had cracked down the middle, but it contained a bathtub four times the size of Steve’s SHIELD bunk, and that was all he cared about. He found the right sequence of buttons to start water flowing after a few false starts and discovered the hot water
“Okay, that--worked a lot better than I was expecting. So you’re willing to take suggestions, good, that’s good.” Tony licked his lips and scooted a tiny bit closer. He was sort of looming over Steve now, but Steve didn’t seem the least bit threatened--well, and why should he, Tony was unarmed (
Tony wiggled his fingers and moved his wrists a little, letting Jarvis test the give. There wasn’t a lot of it, but the bindings weren’t tight enough to be physically uncomfortable. It was only what they symbolized that Tony had a problem with. “There weren’t a lot of peaceful evacuations in that story. Decapitations, yes. Heads on pikes, yes. Peaceful evacuations, no.”
A sudden tug on the ropes had Tony’s eyes flying open. Steve was working one rope out of the complicated circle on Tony’s chest. He made a small, satisfied noise when the end came free, then tugged on the same rope a few inches further back, moving it through another twist. Another slow tug and the coil unraveled.
Not that Tony was going to try to just--just jam it in there. For one thing, alpha cocks were supposed to be huge. For another, he’d gotten himself through a few pre-heats and he knew that even when he was wet, it took time to loosen up for anything bigger than a fingertip. He could--start with that? A finger or two? So far, Steve hadn’t seemed to be in a hurry. Maybe he wouldn’t object to letting Tony take this at his own pace and stretching himself out first instead of trying to take Steve all at once.
Steve eyed him critically, then pulled his cloak off the rearing horse statue and draped it over Tony’s shoulders. Before he could check his instincts, Tony pressed his nose into the lining, inhaling Steve's scent. He caught Steve flaring his nostrils and flushed before turning away and clearing his throat.
Steve made an approving noise and slid his hand down again. Tony pressed his hot cheek against Steve’s tunic. Steve’s hands were working on the ropes at Tony’s wrists, the last part of the tie, and the relief of almost being free was warring with the knowledge of what was going to happen next.
No. He couldn’t think about that now, not when his old team was lost to age and time and his new team was right there. Right now, he didn’t have to be alone. Even if they didn’t stick around after, even if Stark was right and this didn’t mean anything in the future, at least he wouldn’t have to ride this out alone.
Steve made a frustrated noise and said something to Clint, who replied with something that made Steve’s face smooth back out.
“Got used to doing this behind enemy lines,” Steve said, a little dazed. “It’s hard enough just keeping the smell under wraps.” He hooked his calf around Clint’s waist, relieved when Clint relaxed into the loose hold. Automatically, he did a quick headcount: Natasha was curled up with Tony, his hand moving busily in between their bodies while she bit his ear, Clint was tucked safely between Steve’s legs and absently sucking his fingers clean, and Bruce--
Steve didn’t argue the point. He was acutely aware of Clint leaning against his thigh, by all appearances asleep, but he had no doubt Clint was listening. The enemy they’d just faced had stolen Clint’s mind, his reason, his will; Steve couldn’t guarantee nobody else was capable of twisting his teammates, or himself, the same way. Imagining an opponent capable of leashing the Hulk--or possibly even worse, Dr. Banner, with all his brilliance and wary threat-assessment--was terrifying. Steve couldn’t guarantee he’d never be on the opposite side of the field from Bruce, but he knew he’d never want to be, and not just because that would mean the stakes of failure would be unimaginably high.
ever been claimed by another alpha, Steve would have smelled it as soon as he got close enough to scent him, and no doubt the city would have been looted and on fire before dawn.
“Compromise,” Tony suggested, nosing into Steve’s chest. “My kind of breakfast in bed first, your kind of breakfast in bed after.”
“Look, it’s not my fault you’re interesting to look at,” Tony told him sanctimoniously. “I’ve seen plenty of men shirtless, don’t get me wrong, you don’t grow up in the city center without learning which windows offer the best view of the courtyard where the guards practice in the summer, but those shoulders are something else, seriously, your
done,” Tony said, arms crossed, when Steve’s laughter had finally died down. “Who would have thought the fearsome Captain was secretly a giggler?”
, that would be even better. It would take a while, but in the meantime the hot water would ease sore muscles and fresh bruises, and the delay would give Steve’s heat time to simmer. The anticipation was just as good as the heat itself, as long as he had partners to share it with.
. His mother’s lady’s maid had told him what to expect from his wedding night back when he’d first presented and run through every omega in the household looking for someone who was both able and willing to answer his questions, but this--this wasn’t that. He didn’t know what the rules for this were, except that he should let Steve look. It wasn’t as hard as he’d thought it would be to keep still. He felt like a rabbit under the stare of a hawk, frozen in place until he knew which way to leap.
Tony licked his lips. Was he supposed to give his name, or remain silent until he was asked a direct question? The Captain--Steve, apparently--already knew his name, he had to, it had been included on the settlement he and Stane had signed. Was this a test? Time was passing and Steve was still waiting with his hand on his chest but Tony had to figure out the right answer fast or when Steve moved he might--
“I believe you,” Bruce said, sounding faintly surprised. Steve stayed relaxed and loose as Bruce edged close enough to kneel over him.
Tony’s tongue felt thick and heavy in his dry mouth. “You’d better go, Jarvis,” he said, concentrating on not losing it while Jarvis was still in the tent. He didn’t want Jarvis’ last memory of him to be Tony breaking down. “Thanks for coming to see me off.”
And then, when his absence was discovered and the Captain realized that Stane had broken faith, the people in his city would have been the ones to pay the price.
. “Based on that bard’s tale from last midwinter, I’d wondered how closely he would match a literal devil, but he seems human enough.”
Tony glanced at the tent flap. It was closed, for now, but all around them the Captain’s army bustled with activity as his soldiers made camp for the evening. They would leave in the morning with the tide, and Tony would go with them, one more piece of flotsam pulled in their wake. “I guess I’ll find out.”
Steve swallowed carefully, not wanting to get the bathwater dirty, before resurfacing with a gasp. Clint was looking up at him with a gratifyingly stunned expression. He reached out and traced two fingers over Steve’s lips, which were swollen and tingling from the stretch and the heat of the water.
The chatter seemed to reassure Steve. He shook out one of the sheets and layered a blanket over it, then beckoned to Tony until he moved onto the blanket. Steve held out a hand palm-up, then retreated back to where he’d been lying before, bringing a blanket with him.
Tony was pretty sure Steve hadn’t understood any of that, which was probably a good thing. Steve just looked at him calmly until Tony sighed and sat back on his heels.
“Okay, well,” Tony said, blinking rapidly. His fingers tightened around Steve’s. “Good. That’s settled. Hey, is anyone else fucking starving? I’ve got this craving for shawarma.”
“You--don’t like that smell?” Tony pieced together the what Steve was telling him with the cues he’d given earlier, which were pretty obvious, now that he had an idea of what Steve was reacting to. “When I’m scared. You don’t like how I smell when I’m scared.”
“Mmmm, I retract my complaints.” Thor lifted a hand to cradle Steve’s head, his palm warm and heavy. “This is a fitting greeting indeed for a fellow warrior.”
There had been plenty of chances to run--he knew the city’s defences better than anyone, and could have slipped out of his locked room at any point (it was honestly insulting that Stane thought locking the door would be enough to prevent him from leaving if he wanted to, and Tony wished he’d gotten a chance to tell him so to his face). He could have evaded the household guards, stolen a horse from the stables, and made his way to the gates. He could have gotten out.
Steve smiled at them all helplessly. He could already picture the team they were going to be, the work they could do together. It was going to be
Steve pushed up until he was sitting across from Tony, eye level once more. Tony didn’t shy back or retreat this time. That wasn’t what Steve seemed to want from him, and stubornness came to him much more naturally than submission.
Clint sat back and wiped his mouth casually with the back of his wrist, smearing the wetness rather than eliminating it. The
Tony turned to Steve and gave him a shy smile. “I can’t wait until tonight when I can ride your throbbing salami stick again, masterful pleasure king of my heart.”
of him, Steve and Natasha and Tony all together on his skin, made Steve want to roll him down onto the mattress and pin him there,
All the defenses looked just as he remembered them, aside from a few new wall repairs and even more patches that were starting to crumble. Stane hadn’t changed much. He always did prioritize external sales over internal investments.
They landed hard on the heap of disordered blankets, both of them laughing. Steve crawled over Stark on his hands and knees. Stark arched his hips up to grind against Steve’s stomach and then they were kissing, panting too hard to be any kind of coordinated but returning to each other’s faces over and over, laying warm lip prints on flushed skin.
“Yeah, okay, let’s try again,” Tony said, pretending he was agreeing with whatever Steve had said. “I’ll try not to freak out this time. Maybe we’ll just keep things above the waist for a while, how does that sound?”
“No,” Bruce said meditatively, his hand still stroking in the same steady rhythm. “Not unless you had to be.”
to speak. It wouldn’t be particularly difficult to pretend not to understand a word, while really being fluent.
mate, Steve corrected himself--earlier, but it satisfied a craving to have him here now, hale and whole and in the same place as the rest of his teammates, all of them where Steve could see they were safe and taken care of.
It was easy, with Natasha; of course it was easy. She was exquisitely in control of her body, the way she moved, the way she breathed, and she knew exactly how to use it as an instrument of pleasure, the same way she knew how to use it as an instrument of violence. She seated herself neatly over his hips and looked at him. When he nodded, she took him inside in a smooth glide, sinking onto him almost silently. There was a moment of stillness while she looked down at him evaluatingly.
Tony looked at Steve, who smiled again and extended a hand. His fingers were still warm and gentle as they wrapped around Tony’s. Tony kept his hand in Steve’s as they walked to the shoreline, for once not trying to tamp down his slowly rising hope.
“Yeah, come on.” Tony swung a leg over Steve’s lower back and tipped them sideways. Steve went easily now, already acquainted with the way Tony used his body, able to follow his cues. They locked together with Steve on his back and rolled seamlessly into a dirty grind.
The intricate ropes were a welcome distraction from the force of Steve’s gaze. Tony could feel the weight of them as he breathed and could see how Steve’s eyes slid along them, tracing the lines of deep red and bright gold. It made him feel less naked, even as they drew Steve’s attention to every part of his body, from the sides of his throat all the way down to his wrists and ankles. He braced himself for the sight of a knife, knowing that once Steve got tired of looking at them he would need a blade to cut them away, unless he was going to just push Tony over and--
Steve slowed his pace enough to let Stark catch up as soon as they tumbled back through the master bedroom door. Stark jumped forward unexpectedly instead of reaching out for a grab. Steve caught him on reflex, his hands gripping Stark’s thighs as Stark’s chest crashed into his own. Totally unconcerned about the possibility of being dropped, Stark used one hand to grab the back of Steve’s neck and the other to tap him triumphantly on the nose.
gesture, and this time Tony understood. Steve was taking care of the problem, but he wasn’t expecting Tony to be involved, at least not physically. The view from where he was sitting was going to be enough to satisfy his curiosity, but Tony wouldn’t have to do anything. Nothing would
It wasn’t like Tony had any delusions that one day he’d get to have a grand romance and a love match. He’d been betrothed to a neighboring lord’s son ever since he’d presented at the age of twelve. He was used to the idea that he would be traded away as part of a political alliance; he’d just expected that trade to only take him one county over, with someone he--well, not
Steve let him get almost within snapping range before rolling them over until Steve was on top again and pinning Stark’s hands to his sides. If Stark had squirmed to get away he would have let him go, but Stark just moved further into Steve’s space, shoving up with an elbow and doing a tricky sideways throw. Steve let it rock him back for a moment, then flopped right down on top of him, wonderfully skin-to-skin.
“Lord Wilson has been kind enough to accept my petition to stay on as your retainer, conditional on the Captain’s approval, of course.” Jarvis ran a critical eye over Tony’s arms and face, lingering on his unmarked neck, before giving a little nod of satisfaction. Tony knew what he was noticing: no bruises, no rope burns, no bite marks. Steve had been careful untying the ropes. Steve had been careful with
Tony raised the spyglass to his eyes. The crewman in the crow’s nest had just barely sighted land, but he was working with the spyglass Tony had designed two prototypes ago (only the most durable spyglasses were allowed up in the crow’s nest, a rule instituted when Tony had to grind all new lenses after Pietro dropped a brand new version from the crow’s nest to the deck). Tony’s latest design let him see details Pietro would miss, even if it was a bitch to focus on the fly. He patiently adjusted the lenses until the walls of the city were clear.
Steve rummaged through more chests and turned up a long embroidered tunic and leggings that were too gauzy by half, but mostly opaque once Tony layered two pairs over top of each other. Tony got dressed at the same time Steve did, both of them politely turning their backs to each other, as if either of them had anything the other hadn't seen the previous night. It wasn't logical, but it was reassuring anyway.
. He leaned in and bit the top of Thor’s shoulder, not hard enough to bruise but not gently, either.
Stark was a civilian, Steve reminded himself, and bit back the quick retort that wanted to spill out. He opened the collar of his uniform instead, undoing buckles until the tough leather gaped open over the scent glands at his neck.
“Scared, no,” Steve said, then held up a hand when Tony opened his mouth. He said something else, keeping his hand held palm-up, then rolled onto his feet. Tony stayed where he was as Steve rifled through the chests of tribute.
“Hush.” Romanoff kissed his temple, then rubbed her nose in the short hair already drying beside it. “You think your body count is any higher than mine? You still have a long ways to go before you’ll match me, little bird.”
“Jarvis stays,” Sam said, sounding happy about it. He was carrying a canvas sack over each shoulder. The archer was staggering along behind him under the weight of an enormous wooden chest that Tony recognized from his own bedroom.
“It’s a biological imperative.” Banner fidgeted with the hem of the shirt Stark had looted for him from a crushed vendor stall (after tucking a hundred dollar bill under what was left of the cash register), stretching it out while he explained. “A way of, ah, ensuring reproduction with strong mates, so you have a better chance of healthy babies. It also solidifies command structures and defines mated groups.”
He took a deep breath and sank under the water. The pressure felt good on his skin, with his scrapes already closed and the new skin tender and just barely stinging. A quick hard pulse of warmth spread out from his abdomen, a sign that his heat was moving from a simmer to a boil. He ignored it for now and gave his hair a vigorous shake to dislodge the built-up dust and debris. A brisk shampooing and a quick scrub of his hands over his body left him feeling much cleaner, with the constantly circulating bathwater carrying away most of the grime that had been stuck to his body.
