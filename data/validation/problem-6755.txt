Wade was promptly handed a big knife and an equally hulking onion. Steve sat a loaf of bread next to Peter, smiled, and then went back over to Tony with the sauce.
"Hey, wait!" As soon as he was close to Clint again, he dropped his voice to a whisper, glancing over his shoulder to be sure Cap and Tony weren't listening. "You were pretty drunk last night, but I'm hoping you remember what you were talking to Tony about."
“Thank you, Peter,” Steve told him, stepping back to grab the lunches. As soon as he was near the kayaks, he handed both the sandwiches and the map off to Tony so he could move the blue kayak into the water.
“You shouldn’t eat and sleep at the same time.” Taking a bite of his own sandwich, the scientist shook his head at his friend. Chewing more thoughtfully, Clint just gave him a nod.
“Whoa, hey! Oh thank god! Somebody is still left in the world!” Wade chattered happily, capturing Clint in a big hug.
Faking a smile the moment the question was asked, Cap slapped a hand on Peter’s back in return and shook his head.
Yeeeaah. Peter chose now to shrug out of the hug and step back, pretending to shade his eyes and look up at the spot where Iron Man had zipped by in the sky. His mask worked like sunglasses, but it was like a physical figure of speech.
"Sounds exciting," Peter said brightly, heading right inside. Well, hey, he'd been invited in... If Thor didn’t think the world was ending, it must be alright.
"That was WAY too easy." Tony had already said it back when they were leaving Castle Doom, but he repeated it since Steve hadn't replied back then. The blond was sitting on the back of his suit, holding around his neck while Tony tried to fly slowly enough not to plaster Steve's hair back. He WOULD have carried the blond princess-style as they flew, but Steve didn't like the idea of the hand repulsors being pointed at him.
“WELL?” Loki pressed impatiently, crossing his arms. “If you have something you want to say, spit it out. I have piña coladas to drink.”
As if that was an invitation, Deadpool chucked his wrapper and laid down next to him, slipping his mask back down.
“FINE,” he groaned, ending the call and shoving the card back into one of his many pockets. Slapping Hulk’s arm, Clint waved a hand in the general direction of the Avenger’s mansion. “Let’s go.”
Success. Loki leaned on him, but he didn’t have to fake limping. His injury was furious with him. Damn his duplicate who had jabbed him in the ribs. Loki had practically smelled the magic coming off of the new Hawkeye—he wasn't a mere mortal, either. The Trickster only hoped that Thor had sensed it, too.
"Be my guest." Peter hopped onto the railing of the front porch, gesturing to the door as he shoved his card away. Obviously something was going on to make the Avengers block off the mansion like this.
“Tch, no,” Clint snorted, crossing his arms. “Said something about snoring, but I know he just didn’t want the Hulk to trash the camp. I’m gonna go find him.” With that, Clint turned and left again.
Tony restrained himself from rolling his eyes again. Bruce was eternally tired, and had already been silently sleeping in the back seat when Tony had arrived. If he didn't get into the car on his own, who had moved him? Hawkeye, probably?
"Thanks," he said, smiling brightly at Cap. "Wow, this is great. I'm on a tropical paradise vacation with bonfires on the beach, and I get to sit around eating s'mores with Captain America! Man am I glad I got stuck in that car trunk." He took a giant bite of his s'more and chewed happily.
Bruce couldn't really escape notice when Clint was looking right at him while talking, so he just nodded and pretended his mouth was too full to reply. It could've been true.
It was so strange having a whole actual conversation with Bruce. There were no papers or fishing poles in sight, and he was focused right on Clint, his greenish eyes fixed right on—
"Right--everybody inside, shoo, shoo!" Tony said, bemused by the sight of Peter, Matt and Wade together. The teen clearly knew both of them pretty well if they all knew each other's real names, who the others were dating... And yet Peter hadn't mentioned breaking up with Mary Jane to only one of them. Maybe it WAS Matt who Peter liked...
Thor was still wearing his flannel and jeans, but there was no mistaking the golden-haired flying person landing with a hammer in hand for anybody else. He wasn’t trying to be sneaky, either.
Peter leaned back against his seat in response, wiping the smile off his face and settling for an indignant little frown.
"Gah!" Peter grumbled and rubbed at his eyes with both hands, ducking back inside the room. Hopefully Aunt May was still asleep right now. It was too early for her to be up, and if the power came back on before she noticed, that would be perfect.
"He's probably talking about MJ's perfume you stole," Peter said drolly, shaking his head. "Listen, you guys be careful, okay? The Hulk's on the loose again, I guess. The news was talking about it."
It was early, but Cap was a morning person. If he got up like he usually did, there was a chance he might pass by and hear them talking.
“Oh, it’s not as bad as it looks,” Lola told him, placing her hand in his and shaking it. She looked from Tony to Steve, smiling tightly. “Are you his parents?”
“Or the couch, I guess,” Cap suggested, casting a long look at the hammock. “I can sleep on the couch, actually. Peter can have my bed.”
"I kind of sort of came out to Cap last night as bi," Peter explained. "And now you show up the next day all excited to see me, wearing Spider-Man trunks. You can see why he and Tony might get the idea we're dating."
"I think...I..." Loki started, leaning back against Hawkeye's shoulder, letting his eyes drift shut.
Tony stepped over and looked inside quickly. Steve was laying against the far wall, looking feverish and asleep. Sitting beside him was Pepper. Off to the right was Clint, who jumped to his feet, leaning against the cell door.
"Refresh my 'memory'," he whispered suspiciously, "why were we talking about Peter's boyfriend last night? Is he a creep or something?"
"More of a Captain America type for you, huh? Hulk's really quiet all of a sudden." Bruce's shoulders shook as he laughed quietly to himself.
Steve nodded, closing his eyes and leaning against Tony. With a sigh, he went limp, sliding to the ground.
“Are you serious?” Loki asked, crossing his arms. “I saw you yesterday, you fool! I know that you aren’t blind.”
Feeling guilty as their argument over breakfast came back to him, Clint just sighed. Camping sucked.
The whole city seemed to be up in arms over rumors, just like Tony had been. That doctored pictured that had appeared in the papers yesterday had really put a bee in their bonnets. There had been reporters around the mansion all day. Every time Cap came or went, the reporters would snap pictures of him. It all made him nervous after seeing what they could do with a couple of angled pictures.
“No, no, no. I definitely like you…” The archer trailed off into a mumble, his face pink. Wordlessly, he scooted across the couch cushions and leaned to kiss Bruce’s cheek.
Uh-oh. Realizing that “you two” meant Loki didn’t know he was in a group three-person thing, Peter flushed, wondering if the other guy he had in mind was even Matt or Wade.
He could tell how well his puppy-eyed expression came across by how Thor seemed to mirror it back at him, looking at him with such big, sad eyes that he would have been compelled to some kind of sympathy...IF it hadn't been Thor.
"Kids, do I have to send you to your rooms?" Tony asked the two Hawkeyes, trying not to laugh at Bruce's tone of voice.
Surprised by the hand on his head, Clint walked unsteadily over and patted the Hulk’s arm. There was just no way he could walk up the big green monster’s arm like usual right now. His balance was completely off.
“So, any plans for today? I was hoping someone would indulge me and help me build a sandcastle. I haven’t done that since I was a kid.”
"Not a thing! I don't need to imply when you two are 'helping' the other put on sunscreen again 'because you washed it all off in the ocean'." He gave the overly-strong tequila mix another sip. Hey, it wasn't that bad, really. The fizzy part was nice.
Again, Bruce found himself just kind of staring, unsure how to respond. Clint was acting downright weird, and it shouldn't have made him so nervous, but it did. Probably because he suspected he knew why, and he still wasn't sure how exactly he felt about that.
He turned off the burner under the sauce, stirring the stuff with the spatula. He missed his workshop. Had he ever gone this long without welding something?
Tony had given up on trying to call or text Peter before Cap and the others even left. The camp was very quiet with just him and Peter’s apparent lawyer friend Matt, who had stayed put in his chair. The campfire crackled softly, and the metal coffee pot clinked as Tony picked it up from the table near his tent.
The sand was surprisingly soft between Peter’s toes as he wriggled them. The water was warm too, swirling up in bubbling waves around his ankles. It was hypnotizing to watch it for too long. So hypnotizing, that he didn’t notice the wave’s much larger cousin as it knocked him clean off of his feet.
Matt had passed right through the living room and kitchen combo, making his way down the hallway to Cap’s room.
"Nope. Not a thing!" Deadpool chimed happily, biting into his hotdog. He chewed quietly, staring out at the occasional car passing and playing with his crumpled hotdog foil absently.
Steve hadn’t had any alcohol to blame the thoughts on, and he could only chalk it up to all the conversations he’d had with Bruce and Peter. Were all of the Avengers queer? Even Hank and Jan were making eyes at Thor last night.
Across the room, Clint had started poking at the computer. It was displaying a wide range of different files, folders and images of virus cells. He browsed slowly, not really seeming like he understood what he was seeing.
“Alright, everybody!” Cap called, stepping outside of the cabin with a duffel bag slung over his shoulder. “Let’s load up. I’d like to be home before dark. Did everyone use the bathroom?”
At least this room was warmer than the dungeon. And this cushioned chair was actually very comfortable...and the music just blended together into soft little chimes, beckoning him into dreams. When he closed his eyes he almost forgot where he was.
"We get it," Tony interrupted drolly, stepping up and crossing his arms. "How'd you go from there to inside the trunk?"
"Er...yeah," Bruce replied, distracted. Without any street lights, it was pretty dark under the vest.
"Maybe I'd better get yours first--you missed a few spots," he said, and sounded like he was trying not to laugh. The missed spots must be pretty big.
"I don't know. It seems like you're thinking a lot. You keep acting like I did something. Did I get donut glaze on your paperwork or something?"
"K-knock yourself out," Tony told Cap, voice wavering a little now. And there it was--a sniffle, an actual sniffle! Maybe the fumes just took longer to reach them over there. "I've got it covered in here..."
Who was he kidding? Bruce had just gotten through explaining that he couldn’t kiss people. Glancing at the scientist, Clint fidgeted. Since they were on the topic anyway…
"At least you had alcohol as an excuse. I was just trying to see if Cap was jealous or pressured at all to talk to Tony honestly before somebody else whisked him away," he explained. "But he just seems sad, honestly. I'm not sure he's the type to get jealous."
"I do remember one thing about last night," Tony commented, picking up his coffee again. "Besides swimming with you, piggyback rides and mermaid something-or-other, I mean."
The teen groaned and draped an arm over his face, reaching over with the other to turn the alarm off. It was time to get up already? He swore he'd just crawled in the window five minutes ago...
“Good morning, Thor,” Tony grumbled, stepping back over and slapping the lid on the coffee pot. Someday soon, he told himself, he and Steve would get to go somewhere alone. They’d get to go on a honeymoon, right? Knowing their luck, some villain would pick that weekend to try to blow up the planet.
“I’m sorry to interrupt,” a voice suddenly called out of the storm around them. The flexing of metal on top of the car told Tony that they weren’t alone.
"Pepper said something like that, too," Tony said worriedly. "...I better get back to Steve now. C'mon, you won't be in a dungeon, you'll be in a comfortable room. I'm not some tyrant dictator or something." He waved for them to follow and headed for the elevator.
Great. Now he was going to be followed around by the beast. He had to find a reason to send him away now.
"So tell me of Banner," Thor said, like he was reading his mind. "Were you present when the beast overtook him?" He wrapped his big arm around Clint's waist and held the other hand high, waiting for the magic hammer to fly to him.
"I wouldn't put it past Doom—or Loki," Hawkeye grumbled. "But my bet's on Doom. He really wants Thor for some reason, so maybe this is part of his plan. Get him off by himself, lock us in the mansion, and bam, thunder god buffet."
Sitting his plate down, careful not to dump his own sandwich or chips, the brown-haired man quietly stepped over to Clint. He gently grabbed the sandwich that Clint had hanging from his mouth.
"Cupid, you come outside with me, you get struck by lightning," the Hulk told him, seeming more amused than anything. Unfortunately, when he smiled he looked rather like he was happily plotting to smash Loki's head in, so that didn't really make the blonde relax any.
Letting go of the hand, he gingerly climbed to his feet. The Hulk looked real. He was very…hulking. Clint frowned and stuck a hand out, smacking it on the Hulk’s stomach. He FELT like Hulk, too.
A tiny pang of guilt went through Clint as he made his way back toward the stairs up to the cabins. Hopefully Cap and Tony were alright out there. Steve was tough, but Tony was a normal dude.
What would that even be? It was bizarre to realize that even though anger was the thing everybody talked about using to bring out the Hulk, Clint had absolutely no idea what pissed Bruce off. Generally with the Avengers, the transformation thing always happened after somebody was stupid enough to attack Bruce (possibly Hawkeye himself.)
Concerned by how the King of Wakanda might perceive his shouted conversation, Clint cleared his throat loudly.
"Keep flashing, big guy—I'll be right back!" Hopping off the log, he made his way to whatever it was.
"I'm not a MEDICAL doctor," Bruce said as he was hauled over to the computer display, sounding bewildered. They were in the medical room and all.
“Better—I brought trail mix with chocolate bits in it.” Unslinging his backpack, Peter unzipped the top and pulled out a big bag, handing it to Clint. It looked like a mix of fruit and nuts, but there were bright colorful candy pieces all over the place as well.
“Did you say ‘five’?” He feigned a sleepy indignant look, slowly sitting up and squinting at Steve. He could feel his hair sticking up sideways. He probably needed a shave after being out here in the woods for more than a day, and in all of the excitement yesterday, he’d never bothered to change out of his swim trunks, either.
“I don’t know how old he is, but if his healing factor is as good as Wolverine’s…” Cap trailed off, frowning again. “Peter’s dating Wade?”
Thor smiled warmly and dropped Mjolnir on the floor with an incredibly heavy-sounding ‘thunk’, wrapping his arm around Lola instead.
"Well, the Skinner attacked, of course. Logan the mutant put up a fight, but he was no match for the Skinner's insane quest to steal new flesh to wear! When Logan grew his skin right back, the crazed madman couldn't handle it--see, he didn't just want to have a new skin, he wanted other people to have to do without, just like him. So he went right back to his gruesome work, and every time he stole Logan's skin, Logan would grow another one in seconds. It was horrible and really gross, but Logan told himself that any minute, the super heroes would rush in while the Skinner was distracted and take him down..."
“Tony,” Steve said, gently taking his fiance’s arm. “We have to tell someone or this whole trip is pointless.”
"It's...not even light out," he said, not caring that that wasn't an actual measurement at the moment.
“It was fun. Thanks for having me. I have a case to get back to, but after that I’m free.” Adding a small smile, he shifted on his feet. “Maybe we could have lunch.”
“It’s alright,” Clint told him, though he still took one of the offered hands. As he climbed up, he tried not to actually put too much weight on Bruce’s hand. The guy was built like a stick.
“Me?” Clint offered, staring at the ring of green. The whole Hulk thing was tied to Bruce’s pulse. There had definitely been a couple times where Clint had poked, prodded, stabbed or pinched Bruce to get the Hulk out.
The scientist blinked and quickly looked away from him, down the hallway. Was that a bit of a blush on his cheeks?
Peter swung back into the room through the door, flinging over Bruce's head and sticking to the wall by the kitchen counter.
He swayed, though, and went dunking head-first right into the water. Oh right, tequila. Hey, the water was warm, that was nice, he thought, popping his head above the surface and paddling absently in place. Maybe Bruce and Clint had the right idea, going for a swim.
"Owww... Wow, remind me to thank Clint for the half bottle of tequila last night," came Tony's half-pained, half-exasperated voice from the doorway. He sounded like he wanted to laugh but maybe couldn't because it would hurt too much. "
The archer was shaking, himself. He had been in cold, wet clothing for way too long. Hopefully he could find Bruce before either of them died. Something caught his eye in the forest and he waved to Thor.
"You should both get some rest. This isn't something that will be done in fifteen minutes—Doctor Doom is a brilliant scientist. I'll need some time to reverse engineer what he made and see if the sample Captain America brought back really is an antidote."
The others could deal with Loki. Clint needed a nap too. Taking a cue from Bruce, he laid down next to him and closed his eyes. He’d barely closed his eyes before he drifted off, his mind swirling with sleepy images of him and his lookalikes, arguing over Bruce.
The thought was worrying, but Clint had been a SHIELD agent. Hopefully he could manage to keep a secret.
Man, the guy was paler than Clint was! They BOTH needed sunscreen before they spent any time on the beach. Then again, did the brown haired man even burn? When he was himself, Bruce seemed like a pretty normal guy, so Clint assumed the answer was yes.
Bruce stepped inside the room and headed for the countertop across from the door, carrying a briefcase along.
“You two seem like you’re more. If you’re worried about me being a third wheel, I promise I won’t be. I like you, too.”
"Heeey, welcome back!" He said, as if he hadn't heard Tony's first comment at all. "The fire's burning nicely, bring on the burgers!" He threw in some finger guns for good measure, but there was no shutting down the piercing look Tony was giving him. Laughing uneasily, Peter retreated around to the other side of the campfire, hauling Wade along by one arm. If he stayed near Tony he might just get vaporized by that look.
“Aye, I understand. How could I be anything but happy for my friends? We shall feast and dance in your honor!”
Tony wanted to insist that he could walk on his own--he wasn't that drunk, damn it--but at the moment tequila was a convenient excuse for Cap to pick him up and carry him around. He debated what to do for a couple of seconds before climbing onto Cap's back and looping both arms around the blond's neck.
"Clint's acting really weird—maybe he's a doombot sent to collect information and Doom thought we wouldn’t catch on this fast."
"That's right," he began, then held up a hand as he broke into a big yawn. Clearing his throat, he turned to sit sideways on the hammock with his legs hanging over the edge. "A-hem, you got us, I orchestrated sleeping in 'til whatever-o'clock-it-is just to corner you."
Peter couldn't shake off the feeling that Deadpool was still nearby. The street was busy, as it was a weekend, and they passed many small stores along the way home. It would have been easy for the pesky mercenary to hide in one of the stores and jump them as they passed by.
"Huh? Ah, yes, I'm fine. The other guy's talking to me." He shrugged slightly and nodded at the thin air to his right. "You're probably right..."
“Here.” Peter was holding out a piece of medical tape to him. “Look I-I don’t like hiding stuff from Cap and Tony, I just…thought it might be better if they thought Wade was just my camping buddy for the weekend. They won’t get why I’m with him any more than you do.” He sighed and handed Clint the whole roll of tape, turning to shove items back into the first aid kit. “We should get moving.”
“Nobody got hurt unless you count some trees,” he said flatly. “I’m doing my best not to break the rules, here. Why do you think I’m ‘up to’ something?”
“…I’m new to this truth thing, but I feel like I’m getting mixed signals here,” the tall man whispered, scratching his head.
“I’ll talk to them as soon as I can—Tony,” Cap said, dropping his voice to a whisper and shifting in the sand to face Tony. “If Peter and Wade aren’t actually a couple, I think we need to rethink our strategy.” He gestured subtly out to the two young men. “They seem so happy—we should keep our noses out of it. Honestly, what do WE know about romance?”
"I have a potential cure synthesizing for you right now," he added to Steve, turning back to Loki to start cleaning his wound. "I'll compare it against the sample you brought back from Doom, and if they're a reasonable match then it's safe to use. I had to make my own from scratch to be sure, though."
He and Steve had agreed that after Thor secretly met with Loki last night, they really ought to keep an eye on him while he was keeping watch over the Jotun’s camp. If he’d mentioned the earlier chat that would have been one thing, but he’d carefully pretended it had never happened to the Avengers.
“Tony and I are NOT a couple,” Cap clarified, slapping another patty into the empty spot on the grill. “We never have been.” The blond man glanced back over his shoulder in the direction Tony had gone and sighed, adding, “We never will be.”
Clint smirked to himself, but didn't comment. Instead, he looked around the darkly lit room, his blue eyes pausing on the high ceilings.
Imagining Clint’s face when he found out that Cap and Tony were engaged was making the billionaire smirk now. They’d been extremely discreet (not something that came easy to a flashy person like Tony Stark), and he was pretty sure the others had no idea they’d been together for over a month now.
Peter stared at him. They'd gone from alcohol--which he'd been about to conveniently turn into a joke, because duh he was too young to drink--to LOVE.
"Yeah, Thor," Peter said. Wasn't that part obvious? He glanced at Tony, who was looking bothered by the look on Peter's face, and added to both of them, "I-I didn't mind you saying you were my parents, I just realized that really is what we're doin' with the sandcastle--family time. I wanted to take a picture and everything. Is that dumb?"
“Is that what the problem is at school? You feel like an impostor?” Cap asked sincerely, offering the plate with the cooked patty to him.
“Yeah, hopefully Wade doesn’t tell him to make it even worse,” Peter sighed, glancing down at the hand on his sleeve. He put a hand over it before starting slowly toward the cabin, keeping his voice low. “Hey, uh, you okay?” He didn’t want to be rude, but Matt was acting…well, blinder than usual. Not that Peter had any doubt he was actually blind, but his super senses usually helped him walk around just fine, even when it was raining.
Nodding, Steve laid back on the bed. His feet were still on the floor. It felt very nice to lay down. He hadn't been this worn out in...well, a very long time. All the coughing was beginning to bring back memories of his pre-serum asthma, too—but he trusted that Tony, or at least Bruce, would find a cure.
Trying to reassure him with a smile, Cap followed him. God, hopefully it wasn’t actually about dating. That wasn’t something the super soldier was good at. If dating was the topic, he decided he’d politely direct Bruce around the bonfire to Tony.
"Ah...don't, I-I'm fine. I was out in the weather for hours last night," he explained a bit awkwardly.
Hawkeye watched the scene dubiously. Why hadn’t Loki turned back into himself? If he was unconscious, he should turn back, right?
"Ah. Ow. Just a door," Clint muttered, turning to look at him. He could make out Hawkeye's face in the dark, as well as the really worried look he had. All lit dimly in green.
“Come on, Cap,” he sighed. “They’re up here alone for the entire weekend together, and they were very, very surprised to run into us. Wade was wearing Spider-Man swim trunks this morning at breakfast.” He paused, wrinkling his nose. “How old is that guy, anyway? Oh god, 17’s technically the age of consent in New York, isn’t it?” He fell silent, trying not to think about that too deeply. Hawkeye was there, he reminded himself. Hawkeye, the sarcastic bandaid-coated angel he could count on to shoot Wade at the slightest provocation…
“What?” Cap asked, not looking back this time. “Are we going the wrong way? I can see that big rock on the map from here. I figured we’d plant a flag there and then hit the sand bar next, since it’s so far out.”
"Stay here," the Hulk told Loki again before barreling after Hawkeye. "I heard about the shield—want me to SMASH it?"
“I understand why you didn’t want us to know who Wade was, but Peter—Deadpool is not a superhero. Not by a long shot.”
Bruce winced and sat back from Clint enough to hold his hand up for the blonde to see. There was the syringe, the needle cover gone and the metal bent beyond repair. He'd pricked his finger on it.
"...Are we having a moment?" The man said suddenly, tilting his head. "Shut up!" He hissed to one side, returning his attention immediately to Peter.
“Yeah,” Clint whispered, still facing forward. “I’ll climb a rock and let you guys know when they get out to the island. It’s not gonna take them long to put little flags up—we need to be ready to move as soon as they’re heading that way.”
"P-Pepper...?" Tony sputtered, then winced a little. "Ow. Ouch. Haha...y-you're really that old-fashioned? We're not an item...just because she's my s-secretary."
"I think we should go back to the mansion," he said instead, swiping his hair out of his face again. "I-I think sneaking out like we did was a mistake—we're going to worry people. If they think I could just run off, they might decide to lock me up, you know."
"Actually, Cap's hardly talked to me today since we got out of the cars. He was hiding out in the kitchen drinking root beer earlier," he gestured across the bonfire, "and you can see that he didn't want to sit near me here, either. Think he had enough of me on the road trip. Vacation is tough for workaholics. You're at least having a good time now, right? All of my hard work making this happen didn't go to waste?" He directed shining topaz eyes at Clint, knowing the bonfire would make them sparkle extra bright.
“Never been with a guy before,” he ventured, keeping his eyes fixed on a particularly ugly clump of moss in a tree. It kind of looked like a melted face.
"Are we sure we WANT them to get some privacy? If the Hulk rips up half of this beach, I can't exactly explain that away," he pointed out to the blond.
That actually made him way more suspicious than some form of protest would have. Peter glanced behind him as he stepped off the train, looking for some glimpse of Deadpool's very conspicuous "disguise"—and missed the step, falling flat on his face on the loading platform outside.
Pepper was standing there, a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. She was wearing a completely different outfit than when Steve had last seen her—likely spare clothes Tony kept for her wherever she might show up.
The nice brief moment of distraction from his own woes evaporated as Peter swung into sight of the campsite. In the dark it was hard to see, but he was pretty sure there was a gigantic tree laying right across the tent.
“Stop it,” Matt sighed, batting away Wade’s fingers. “Steve seems like the type who’d worry about people being struck by lightning—”
"Bruce?" If he turned into the Hulk now, it wouldn't be a bad thing. Everyone was stuck, injured or busy. Maybe Hulk could go check on Pepper.
“You may want to follow them,” Cap told Peter, gesturing after the two men. He flipped a patty and then sat it aside on a plate.
If there was any truth to THAT idea, then it must have been very difficult to balance. The moment Bruce’s heart rate increased, he’d change to the Hulk. There was a chance that Hawkeye and Bruce had never actually been together, then.
Watching him as he crossed the room, Loki didn't move, instead putting on one of the scowls he saw Hawkeye use.
"Cure...what?" The other Hawkeye asked, looking at his double. "Coughing?" He looked back up at Thor.
"Clint and Banner are right here," Tony commented, pointing at the two as they hurried past them. He was sure he'd gotten some confused looks in return, but whatever. Tony trailed after Cap as they reached the cabin and stepped inside. "Something's not right, here. He doesn't even look like a college guy, unless he's some sort of body builder."
Oh great. Bruce had found him. Clint sank back down behind the balcony railing and groaned, slapping a hand over his face.
“Cap and Tony have been in this nice, quiet, we-get-along spree for WEEKS,” he added to Peter, trying to come up with something nicer to say than ‘look away while I shoot your boyfriend.’
Clint came over and sat beside Bruce just as a rumble of thunder sounded far off in the distance, followed shortly by a bright flash of lightning. When the flash vanished, so did all the street lights.
"H-hey...wait! Wow, okay then," Tony grumbled, realizing he was talking to thin air. He crossed his arms, glancing over at Bruce and Clint sleeping on the medical bed side by side, and raised an eyebrow. "Get a room indeed. Sheesh."
"Yeah. You only get a few days a month to do what you want and I'm pretty sure sitting around in the pouring rain for sandwiches isn't it." He gestured back to the shop. "I'll just come back some other time." Clint sighed in defeat.
“I’m gonna kill him,” he said under his breath, taking a seat with Peter’s help. Running a hand over his face, Matt sat up in his seat, pulling on a very carefully calm expression.
"Tony." Captain America stood up, leaning on the wall for support. Judging by all the wheezing, he was barely able to breathe. Despite this, Cap looked genuinely pleased to see the billionaire for once, and even managed a hopeful smile.
He let go of Bruce’s wrist, figuring that it’d be nice not to have a gross bleeding split in the back of his arm.
“Last week,” Peter repeated, staring at him. He’d thought they were being extra bitter at each other, but maybe out of jealousy, not because of THIS. Now he just felt lousy for not noticing on his own. He moved closer to Matt, slipping an arm around him. “Anything I can do to help?” A thought occurred to him, and he added sadly, “Wait, this wasn’t over ME, was it? I swear, I flipped a coin to figure out who got the weekend alone first…”
Apparently finished with whatever mixing he was going to do, Doom headed to the kitchen area and poured the beaker's contents into a large golden goblet. How vampirish of him. Cap had to wonder if the metal cup would shock him when Doom handed it to him. The masked man was offering it to him now, so he was about to find out if he accepted it.
Bruce sighed and punched the last button on the machine. Even without rushing, he was pretty sure his attempt at a cure for Cap had turned out the same as before. Still, may as well let it synthesize and try it out.
"He can hear a flag flapping way farther out than people could see it," Peter said confidently, grinning. Matt's powers were pretty amazing. Wade's were, too, although they'd managed to carefully avoid mentioning those to the Avengers so far. It was probably for the best.
Dropping his newspaper and coffee in the nearby trash can—never on the ground—Steve bolted across the street, pausing briefly to dodge one of the vulgar taxi cars. Covering his nose and mouth with the side of his coat, he ducked inside to check for survivors.
“Um, we’d love to stick around and visit, but we should go put out our campfire so it’s not burning unattended,” he told Cap and Tony. It was a reasonable excuse. The responsible thing to do. How could they refuse?
“I’m not sure where you heard about treasure here, but hiking around sounds fun,” Peter said, shrugging. “Sure, let’s do it!”
“You know, if you’d just gotten in the first time I asked, we’d both be out of the rain by now,” he grumbled. “This’s what I’m talking about. We don’t listen to each other.” Shaking his head, he turned and crawled under the kayak.
Down the beach, Peter saw T’Challa laying on a big brightly colored beach towel covered in cartoon sea creatures. He looked like he was asleep, a book sitting on his stomach.
“You mean Bruce actually managed to hit something?” Came the dubious reply. Tony seemed to think the team was pranking him or something, because when Steve came into view with Wade and the arrow sticking out of him, Peter heard him add in bemusement, “Wait, seriously? Oookay, first aid kit’s right here—you patch him up while I call 911.”
Loki stirred, rolling his head at the sound of Tony's voice. His green eyes opened slowly at first, but then he flinched at the sight of the Hulk.
"Been tracking you for miles, kid." Wolverine leaned even closer, resting his elbows on his knees. "Where's the merc?" He growled, cracking his knuckles.
The little hum of Tony's machines that was part of the background sounds in the mansion had vanished as well—the room was silent save for howling wind and grumbling thunder outside.
"Unless Doctor Doom did something to him so that needles bend off of his skin, making him look suspicious so we'll side with you. You could be a doombot."
Hovering near the fire and peeking into the cup, he saw that the latte looked expertly prepared. The lady had even poured the cream foam into the shape of a little heart. Aww. Wait, a heart?
Hello, turns out I was wrong about us posting once a week on Tuesdays--we're now posting a chapter on Tuesday and a chapter on Friday each week. ♥ Onward, to the shenanigans!
Bruce felt a heavy sort of calm fall over him. He hadn't counted on that—on being drugged to keep the Hulk away.
"No, he insisted on staying behind," the shirtless Clint explained, shaking his head. "Now we have to go back there and give that old metal perv an Arc reactor!"
“Okay, well when my phone has a charge again I’ll text you guys,” he told them. He almost just turned and walked off, but they were standing so perfectly side by side, so lined up for it… Impulsively, Peter stepped closer and hugged them both, one arm around each. “This was really fun—thanks for sticking around.”
Tony felt the hand on his shoulder and sighed, the tension draining away. He looked up at Thor expectantly.
"Probably a good idea. This shirt's thin," Bruce said, and sounded weary yet again. He should've been a LITTLE more energetic after napping most of their 10-hour road trip, but nope. "Let's go down to the beach, though, okay?" Much more quietly, he added, "Then we can talk about Cap."
He’d just thought of dating Tony. They worked together well enough and sometimes it certainly felt like they were the parents of the Avengers.
“Was that Peter’s voice?” Yet another voice asked. A moment later, Steve came around the tree behind Thor. His face lit up with a smile at seeing Peter. “Wow. Funny running into you all the way out here.”
"Jarvis, where'd they go?" Tony landed in his living room and folded his mask face up, glancing around.
Dropping his sleeping bag beside one of the tents, Bruce ran his fingers through his hair. He glanced from Thor’s sunny smile to Clint’s scowl down at the coffee pot and fidgeted.
"Get...them..out." Steve shook his head, pulling on Tony's hand and frowning. He nodded to the other two. "I'll s-stay."
"Hey, let's go out the back." He turned Bruce away from the direction of the front door. "Thor might spot us."
As consciousness returned to him suddenly, Clint's eyes fluttered open. Where was he now? He looked around the room, blue eyes hazy.
Bruce took advantage of the conversation distracting his patient, injecting Loki with something. Just as he was readying the needle and surgical thread, there was a little hum...and the lights flickered on, albeit at a very low level of brightness.
Thor brought a big hand up to brush one of her dark curls away from her cheek and tuck it behind her ear, smiling at her fondly.
Slipping out of Wade’s arms, Peter shot a web string up into the trees and swung up the hill toward the campsite. Yeah, the mere thought of having Captain America and Iron Man disappointed in his life choices made him panic a little. They had to know how hard it was to date as a superhero! Although now that he thought about it, the Bugle had just done a tabloid conspiracy theory article on why Tony hadn’t been seen with any supermodels in almost a year…
“Is he insane?” Peter pulled himself free of Wade’s grasp, turning back and sending webs shooting into the water after Clint. “What’s he gonna do, arrow it to death from the inside-out?” His webs caught on something, but the lake was too murky to see what. Figuring that either Clint or the monster was just as good because they’d be separated from each other, Peter turned and swam for the shore, doing his best to drag his catch along with him.
The room suddenly glowed green. Tendrils of magic licked out from around the hall as the other Hawkeye approached. He paused, smiling at them all.
"Uhh. No. No, we are not a couple, Thor." The trickster carefully readjusted his intonation as he noticed that he was starting to sound like himself.
Apparently one mistook that call as directed at them, because at that moment, a shiny yellow taxi with black and white checkers on the side pulled up beside them.
Bruce mumbled something about water and retreated from the couch to the kitchen. Thor made it look so easy to be social. It probably WAS easy for him—he didn't have to worry about killing people by accident.
“Here, mop some of the blood off and we’ll be able to see the damage underneath. Um, I’ve never really stitched somebody up before—do you know how to redo them?”
Ducking around the counter, he peeked down the hall to make sure Peter wasn’t standing there before he headed over to Tony.
The Jotun sat back down on the couch. His plan would have to wait. The stringy man seemed so harmless, it was mind numbing to imagine the power he had in his slim body. If only they could be alone for a few minutes without the Hulk immediately smashing him into the floor...
“I don’t know what game you’re playing at here, Tony, but I don’t appreciate it. I know Bruce shouldn’t be with anyone—of course not, his transformation is tied to his pulse!” Cap poked a finger at Tony’s shoulder and dropped his voice even softer. “We ARE the leaders of this team and we have a responsibility to be professional and focused, all personal feelings aside.”
“Deal,” Cap agreed easily, offering a hand. Daredevil took his hand and shook it, flashing a smile at Peter.
The redhead gasped and scrambled forward into the stairwell—and down the stairs. Luckily she grabbed the handrail on her way through toppling over, and wound up hanging by her arm. Her knee and elbow weren't so fortunate, and got scraped up pretty good on the steps.
Steve ran toward the voice, squinting through the thick smoke to see who it was. It was very difficult to see anything at all. Feeling carefully for an arm, he helped the woman to her feet.
Clint also perked up, sitting up and leaning over Bruce to look at the door. Or maybe to just lean on Bruce. Whichever.
He scratched his head and glanced uneasily over toward the steps up to the cabin. "Anyway, I'm going to just..." With a nod that way, he hurried off. Maybe he didn't want to hear whether Clint had actually been flirting or not.
"He doesn't usually want to CATCH Dr. Richards," Pepper pointed out, blinking. "Usually he just wants to best him or make him look bad. At least, that's what I got out of the newspaper article I read about them. I've never met Doom until now."
There was that buzzing in the hallway again...then the door popped open like it was welcoming Cap and Tony.
Not that Bruce and Hulk were the same person. They certainly had different likes and dislikes—though both seemed to get along with Hawkeye. Perhaps…all three? There was a strange thought.
"Clint?" Bruce called after him. Surprisingly, even in his spacy state he'd noticed Clint was leaving.
Crinkling the faded card in his hands, Cap stared down at his words, considering each one very carefully. It was a good thing the note card was so small or he would have rambled on forever.
"Um, no. I'm on m-my way outside. Tony's...um. Busy." Cap peeked into the medical room, trying to catch his breath. It felt impossible. "Are you alright? Your e-eyes are looking a bit...green."
"I'd better play it safe," Bruce said, smiling at him. The guy never exactly dressed up, but he looked somehow a lot more casual in pajama pants. Maybe it was the fact that they were Clint's borrowed PJ pants that was throwing him off. They were a little too big for a skinny guy like Bruce, but luckily they had a drawstring waist.
"It's been a crazy weekend. You know what? I think we need coffee. Er." The blue eyed man stared up at Bruce, thinking it over. "Wait. Can you even drink coffee?"
"Easy there, soldier." Captain America stepped between them, almost toppling over from moving. "We'll s-scan him too."
“Hey!” His grin faded as they got closer and he realized that the kayak was dragging really bad in the back. Cap’s elbows were in the water, actually. He’d seen them paddle out, so he knew that Cap couldn’t just be too heavy for the blue kayak to handle. Despite the dragging tail-end, Cap was paddling strongly enough to move them forward at a good pace anyway. Tilting his head, Peter watched as they glided the rest of the way to the shore.
“Nice try, but—” Wait. Was it September already? It was. He and Steve had been so caught up in first secretly dating then secretly being engaged that they had somehow completely forgotten about it. Apparently Peter had, too, or the air of angst would have been impossible to miss…
“We’re going to another planet if we have to,” Tony declared. With the kind of lives they led, they just might have to actually do that.
But…there was no need to hide the tackle box anymore. Once Bruce had that, he wouldn’t want to hang around Clint anyway.
"Hey, Cap—this is Clint. I know you probably still don't know how to answer this thing, but you always take it to Tony when it rings, so I just wanted to let you know that me and Bruce are out grabbing breakfast—don't freak out, we'll be back by like seven."
Clint sat down again on the table edge, careful not to lean back too far in case Doctor Doom got the idea of strapping him down again. Though that was kind of funny. Doom hadn't returned his shirt yet, either.
“No, something for smaller teams. Say, two people to a team—that way Cap and Tony can be on a team. We just have to make sure everyone partners up before we tell them what’s going on. How about a treasure hunt or something?”
“Um. Yeah,” Peter said sheepishly, snagging a cup of coffee and taking the seat on Matt’s other side. If he admitted to Cap and Tony that Wade had taken Matt’s glasses and cane, they didn’t have the context that Matt had other senses to help him out—they’d just think Wade was a grade-A jerk. “Hey, sorry we just moved in overnight. When we went up the hill back to our campsite, there was a tree through our tent,” he explained, glancing between his two ‘dads’. (If only. Sigh.)
"Yeah," he said glumly, rubbing his neck. "Um, how you doing over there Cap? Any chance of breaking outta here soon?"
"You mean the tatters of my research all over the floor?" Bruce replied dully, dumping the water glass in the sink. He sat the empty glass on the counter, looking around at the messy kitchen. There was still bow-tie pasta all over the place.
"I hope he remembers we're in here," Pepper muttered. "If I don't get some water soon, I'll shrivel up and die."
"Hawkeye...Clint." Thor placed a big hand on his shoulder, looking solemn now. "I will pry no further, but know that I respect and care for you, as always. If there is anything that I can do to aid you, you know you have only to ask."
At any rate, he got to Clint before the blonde reached the door, grabbing one of his shoulders. "I think he's the fake."
"Definitely," Steve said, getting slowly to his feet. He wobbled back and forth, before resting a hand on the wall to steady himself.
Thor! He had completely forgotten about Thor. A wave of relief washed over Steve so strongly that he plunked back down on the medical table. If there was one person he knew could pull any of them out of a pinch, it was the God of Thunder.
“…Meant that the coupon was expired, so I had to go back inside and talk with the manager because I swear to god, I’m not paying full price for a jumbo salsa jug again…”
Hey, we're written ahead enough that we're going to start posting twice weekly now for this fic! As always, comments and kudos appreciated. ♥
"Huh? No, no, that's, uh, unrelated," Peter said awkwardly. He sighed. "It's complicated, Cap. Wade's not in high school, it would be weird to have him there all the time. That, and...he's got some enemies. I don't want to bring danger to the kids at school."
"Well, it doesn't SOUND very appetizing. Skunks have nothing to do with mythical creatures like the other flavors, so I'm not sure why they went there."
"Water w-would be great." Cap nodded, returning Tony's pat. He circled back around the room to the chair where he had sat earlier. It was the only one not covered in wires and parts. The blond man sat down, leaning back against it and sighing. Vague images of Doom playing the piano flashed through his mind, yet he ignored them. The weekend couldn't get any more bizarre. He wouldn't be surprised if he found out next that Modok played the harp.
"CAP! HEY CAP!" Waving away a bellow of smoke from the door, he paused to drag the injured woman further back. "What the hell happened in there?"
"So, I am not the only sorcerer here. What did you use? Mind control? A potion, perhaps? Or was it just...pity?" Loki grinned.
"Well, you're not melting. From what I can tell, Doom didn't get RID of your super serum, he just disabled how you metabolize it. You haven't been hungry much lately, have you?"
After shoving the bag at him, Peter immediately got out the first aid kit and went to work peeling off Clint’s old bandage, dabbing at the stitches with some fresh gauze. “Sooo…”
Sounding completely unconvinced of his own words, Cap bobbed under the water and came back up, swiping his hair back from his face.
Tony looked at him, sweat shining on his brow. It was getting kind of hard to breathe without some kind of wince coming out. Hell, if Loki sabotaged him it's not like he wouldn't have died in a couple extra minutes anyway.
"What? NO! See?! See?!" Deadpool waved his arms above his head, throwing the lighter. "I do the good thing and ask his parents but that...that...that scoundrel steals him away! WHhhhhyyyyyy?!" He wailed, grabbing at Tony's shirt pathetically.
Peter nodded at Lola, stammering, “She’s…uh, your love there, you know she’s actually… Um.” Don’t panic, don’t panic, he told himself. The Spidey Sense was tingling at the back of his neck, and he couldn’t tell whether it was Loki causing it or his own anxiety over this situation.
“Please believe me when I say this,” he told the Avengers co-leaders grimly. “I didn’t deliberately do anything to hurt anyone. I’ve done enough damage for several lifetimes already, okay? Every minute of every day, I have to be careful so that nobody gets hurt. I’m doing it right now.”
Trying to figure out Peter’s would-be boyfriend troubles had been the first time they had agreed on something in a long time.
Clint was a nice-looking guy when he stopped to consider it. Blue-eyed, blond, well-toned Clint. What he saw in tired, skinny, scruffy-bearded Bruce was anybody's guess...
"Run from what?" Bruce asked, steadying himself. Wait...had somebody attacked Clint? Maybe he wasn't sitting here just because of his injuries.
Bracing himself, he ducked into their cabin. The air had the slight scent of waffles to it, and--YES, there was still some coffee left in the pot!
“Cap,” he began, frowning. “We can’t do this forever. I can’t. Okay? You and I, there’s something happening to us and I don’t like where it’s headed. Before we found you in the ice, I…”
"To insects, mere children appear as gods," Doom sniffed, turning his back and swooshing his cloak dramatically. He stuck a fist in the air. "These 'gods' have not met DOOM!"
"Like...dating advice?" He asked in a stage whisper to Cap. Bruce, who could clearly hear him, sighed heavily and rubbed one of his temples.
"And how would that help us? Unless somebody takes pity and unlocks a door so we can go inside, our only hope is to coat ourselves in newspapers for insulation."
“I have nothing to say to you,” he said, heading Thor’s way. He stuck a hand out, pointing back across the lake. “Aside from ‘get out!’”
"I hate to ask..." Cap groaned, turning back to Tony. "Can you h-help me to my room?" The captain knew that it would be a miracle if he made it back to his room on his own. He could have just slept in the hall, he supposed.
Thor appeared in the doorway, Steve cradled in his muscular arms and dramatically wrapped in his cape. They, too, were soaked to the skin, and smelled like rain and thunder.
The dark-haired man did so--and then kept moving, until he was right in Cap's space, inches from his face again.
“I love Hulk, I really do, but you’re right. I get to spend every day with him usually. Now that I’ve had some time around you, though...” Clint coughed, weighing different words. “I, um, well, uh,” he stammered. “I don’t think it’s fair that Hulk’s out all the time. And Hulk, buddy, if you’re awake, I’m sorry! Alright, but Bruce is in there too! You guys gotta share or nobody gets to play. Capiche?”
"Whatever pal! Just uh, be safe. That guy gets around..." The Torch laughed nervously, slowing down to hover over the mansion. It was indeed surrounded by a force field, which was a beautiful glimmering yellow dome. "Should we knock or something?"
"Thanks," Peter said with a winning smile, taking the offered sweet treat. Double chocolate was an awesome habit to have. Cap was pretty awesome in general, though.
Clint couldn’t help laughing at that. He lay his head back on top of the first aid kit and shook his head.
Remembering he was in the middle of a conversation with Cap, Peter snapped back to looking at him, smiling uncertainly. “What’d you say?”
"Come on," Clint pleaded childishly, sliding closer to Bruce. "Just for a few hours. Then we can come back here and I'll help you with your stupid papers."
“Here, Stark—kindling,” the demigod said cheerfully, dropping the shards on the ground in front of Tony. The billionaire would have called him a show-off, but he was too busy trying not to think about how Steve could do that exact same thing. Big strong blond guys were apparently now his type.
“Tony, he said he was nervous to tell everyone he was queer. Maybe if he knows everyone here is alright with it, he’d feel more comfortable.”
Clint tried not to roll his eyes. Cap had been going on and on about bears attacking Bruce since they got there. Now he was gonna to feel justified and make them sleep in the campsite.
“The power’s been on this whole time,” Peter clarified, giving him a hug and a pat on the back in return. Noticing how quiet it was in there, he tilted his head and frowned. “I think the rain just stopped, too!”
“Aye—fetch the bandages, he is bleeding,” Thor said, placing the also-soaked redhead onto his feet with great care. Matt’s hair was an absolute mess, hanging over his eyes. A trickle of blood ran down his chin from his bottom lip. Thor kept hold of Wade, adding direly, “I found them on the lake shore beside Loki’s camp.”
With a curious look, Bruce handed him the sunscreen and turned around so Clint could reach his back.
Peter decided now wasn't a time to gripe about how he actually hated mixing ketchup and relish. He shot a piece of web up to the nearby stoplight, swung them across the street the way they had come, and proceeded up the sides of the buildings, zig-zagging them back and forth between two as they climbed higher.
“Just let me put on some real clothes, and I’ll come along. Unless you think he’ll talk more easily with only one of us there.” There was a thought. Cap was so good at being patient and reasonable and not making snap judgments. On the other hand, Tony was the one with more dating and relationship experience (any, actually), so maybe they had this backward?
“Ah shit,” Clint growled, hurrying after him. So much for their vacation! Spider-Man was going to have a big brawl with this guy and they were going to have to go home early, tackle box or no tackle box.
"The tough part is going to be making them think this was their idea so they don't suspect we have something planned," Bruce said, glancing up at Clint. He frowned thoughtfully. "Especially since we can't say we saw it on a website or something with no technology here."
The store didn’t have any normal vanilla-with-chocolate-cookies-sandwiches, NO. They had wacky flavors like ‘unicorn’ and ‘flying squirrel.’ Frankly, all they made Clint think of was Spider-Man’s villains.
“But for real, there’s some really creepy people camped out in the woods. Big lumberjack types. I saw one break a tree with his bare hands. Why would he break down a whole tree if he wasn’t making a fire big enough to cook a person?”
The Jotun sat down willingly. First, he had to get away from the monster and his shoulder angel. Then, he had to find that lab. Breathing carefully, Loki stared down at his side and then up at Bruce, mustering up his best puppy-eyed look.
“Two hours and twenty three minutes,” Steve told him, drifting up to Tony with a big smile. The blond man treaded water easily, circling around Tony. “Don’t tell me you want more coffee? Let’s paddle out farther and I’m sure you’ll feel more awake.”
“It’s nice to meet you, too, Peter.” Lola shook his hand and then hugged her book to her chest, peering down the beach. “A couple of weeks,” she said with a sigh. For some reason, she suddenly seemed way less excited.
Steve came over to Tony, kneeling next to him. He examined his chest, eyeing the wad of cords leading out of it.
Bruce blinked a few times and just looked at him, trying to figure out how to respond. After a moment, he drew a deep breath and hurriedly shrugged out from under Loki's arm, climbing off of the couch and crossing the room to the briefcase. There he appeared to be rearranging the items inside; Loki couldn't really see what they were.
Steve hurried to get Peter a cup of coffee, handing the kid the plate with two fresh waffles on it as soon as it was ready.
Wade squeezed him tight, grinning at Peter and pointing at Matt’s back where he couldn’t see. He was mouthing something. ‘OMG’ was Peter guess.
“Did I hear my name?” Wade came charging down the hallway to join them, a sloshing mug of hot chocolate in hand. “Thor fixed the weather, just FYI. Yep. Mission Stoggers can continue!”
"Yeah, well, I'm you." The shirtless one poked his shoulder back. He squinted at his lookalike and shook his head. "There's no way my nose is that big."
Not yet anyway, Tony thought ominously, smiling at them as they fell into step and started back toward the stairs.
“Ah, man! Loki’s such an asshole!” Stepping past the very obvious Hulk prints, Deadpool squeezed into the half of the tent door that was exposed.
Cap watched as Thor stepped over beside the medical table, leaning to examine Clint’s injury. "What happened...? I should never have let you leave my sight."
"I thought you were watching," Bruce mumbled, looking up and down the street at the crosswalk they had just arrived at.
"No...that was just you." He sighed. "The one I saw last has an injury on his side, and the other one is new. He's extra aggressive."
The Hulk snorted and grumbled under his breath, but relented and did not try to attack Clint. In fact, he stepped up closer to the archer and got a wicked little smirk.
The Clint in the blanket sat down nearest the door where Bruce was seated. He sighed and pulled the blanket around him, looking longingly at Bruce through the glass.
“Hey, is there a Peter staying with you? 18? Really flexible? Super hot?” The man shouted up loudly, waving an arm.
Bruce sat back and frowned at him thoughtfully, his eyes slowly shifting back to their usual soft brown. "You'll probably have either a neck ache or a jaw ache later, depending on what that pop was, but you're okay. I'm sorry I distracted you and made you look back." He sighed, glancing down at the waves washing against the rock. "Thought something grabbed my ankle, but it turned out to just be a piece of seaweed."
Bruce quickly got to his feet, looking uncomfortable in his borrowed neon swim trunks and yellow flip flops, and started off down the beach toward the water, watching to see if Cap followed him.
“In general, dating isn’t exactly available to me,” Bruce clarified, pulling him back to the present. Right. Gay Avengers. Apparently there were a lot of them. “And nobody’s lining up for a date with the Hulk ever, so we’ve sort of accepted at this point that we’re going to stay alone.”
“That way!” Clint cheered, pointing off where he figured the sunken ship might be. His memory was a bit fuzzy, but this vacation was looking up!
"Can I go to my room now?" Loki asked, unsure if he sounded like Hawkeye or not at that moment. Clearly, he was meant to slowly bleed out from his lousy first aid skills on the couch of his enemies...
Glancing between all three of them, Cap looked sad as he got to his feet, managing to put on a more cheerful looking face as he nodded to the kids.
"Once it's done, I'll take some nice pics of it," Peter offered, brightening at the idea of Tony joining their endeavor. "Sounds like fun!"
"I hear word only through what others tell me," Thor sighed, sitting back down. "It would seem that the Captain ails from a poison of some sort. Banner and Stark are working feverishly to create an antidote."
The Hulk was picking up any piece of rubble that wasn't bolted down and hurling it after Amora, roaring all the while. It was a miracle he wasn't after Hawkeye, since Hawkeye had been the one to zap Bruce.
Bruce mumbled some sort of agreement and slowly sank down to rest his head on Clint's shoulder. Thinking of the peaceful boat on the water had agreed with his sleepless state; he was in danger of dozing off.
"Your manners are appalling," he informed Clint, crossing his arms. "Is there something you forgot to confess to me before...?"
Cap stared at Daredevil, perplexed by the sudden concern in his voice. The redhead stared back, putting on a calm expression again. Maybe he hadn’t meant to upset Peter after all.
"I—made him wait out in the rain for a long time. It, uh, it sucked. He really didn't like waiting."
"Chemistry shmemistry. You’re on your last year, dude! Who cares? Hotdogs are way cooler." The merc scooted a bit closer. "Why bother with that school BS? We could be hanging out and catching baddies all night!" He reached an arm around Peter's shoulders again—which seemed to be his thing tonight. "Or eating hotdogs." He was watching the brunette eat waaaay too intently.
“If swimming’s the plan, then I’m gonna go change into my trunks,” he said, stretching and yawning again. Getting up and moving around would probably help him wake up better than sitting there. He’d carry his coffee down the lake trail with him.
Maybe Matt liked nobody. Maybe Peter was about to get rejected. The thought made his heart pound, and he was sure for Matt it was deafening.
"Wait, wait, just talk to me a sec here!" Peter's voice drifted to him from up the stairs by the cars, and he sounded a little panicked. A glance up there told Cap that the kid was hurrying after Daredevil, who was back in his red suit with the mask off and stepping quickly toward the cars.
“Matt didn’t even know the Avengers were here until he was halfway up the hiking trail,” Peter reminded Wade, sighing. God, Cap and Tony were probably having an emergency meeting about him right this minute… “And, um, Wade, remember that talk we had about letting them assume we’re just friends? Besides Hawkeye, of course. He already seems to know everything, even that Matt’s Daredevil.”
The blond turned to rummage in their storage bag, digging out a set of plain metal cups and a container of coffee creamer.
"And I'm the fairy godmother," Wolverine snarled under his breath, which still made the little old lady ten feet away cower into her knitting bag. "That freak took my motorcycle—I'm gonna wring his ugly neck!"
"I said, did he actually say that?" Bruce pretended to be very interested in a random piece of newspaper on the ground by his shoe.
"Ah..." Bruce tugged the vest a little higher around his waist, glancing around for some sign of a blanket or other more substantial piece of cloth. "It's not...that. Um. Could you get some of my clothes from the dresser?" He nodded across the room.
“They’re Captain America and Iron Man. It might be uncomfortable for them out there, but I doubt they need saving,” he said. “Have you actually seen Peter, or Thor? Let’s focus on the plan.”
“He wants to be a better person, so that’s what I’m helping him do.” The redhead placed a hand on Peter’s shoulder and gave him a charming smile. “I promise we’ll be waiting for you when you get back.”
Without comment or breaking his stride, Black Panther walked between them and snagged a burger plate before continuing off onto the beach again.
Recalling his first conversation with Lola and how it was all about wanting to have a summer fling with Thor, Peter blushed.
The blue eyed man glanced around tiredly, before leaning against the shop's door frame. He rested his head on the beam and stared at Bruce...who had been staring at him.
Coughing, Steve woke back up. He looked confused for a moment and then stared up at Tony, placing a hand on Iron Man's arc reactor and quickly shaking his head.
Okay, so he was just dating one guy, not all over the place. When that one guy was a notorious mercenary with a reputation for bloodshed, though, and Peter had only turned eighteen in the past couple of months… Yeah, didn’t look great. They’d only been dating for like a month, but Tony didn’t know that. Peter could just imagine Iron Man and Captain America crashing through a wall and hauling his boyfriend off to super villain maximum security prison. Oof.
Pepper glanced at him from where she'd sat down on the floor beside Cap and kind of leaned on him a bit. She seemed to be worried that Doom might take him away and was keeping tabs on him. Steve seemed to be sleeping for the moment. His breathing was raspier than before, though.
Cap went straight to the kitchen, digging through the fridge. He smiled as he offered Peter a root beer.
"Woah. Aren't those things infinite batteries?" Clint said, making strange gestures with his hands. Then he peeked over at Cap and Pepper and cleared his throat. "I guess if it gets us out of here..."
“Oww,” Peter managed, muffled. The Spidey Sense wasn’t tingling anymore except faintly in the direction of Loki. Forgetting all about his civvie clothing, Peter crawled right over Wade’s shoulder to perch on his back and peek down into the water. “…Hawkeye?”
“I must leave. They will kill me the moment your back is turned, dear brother.” Or at least throw him into some dark cell in the negative zone or something.
"Whoa, wait, we could've sent BOTH of them off away from Peter for the week, and you stopped them? WHY?" He was mystified. Cap must have a good reason for this, but he couldn't think of what.
As Wade chattered away, a glint of something in the dark caught Peter’s eye. It was that woman from before—Lola?—gathering up her stuff slowly while she watched Thor and the others talking.
“How was your first day? I know you don’t get a lot of time to yourself, so I hope it was peaceful. No offense to Hulk,” he added, trying to muster a smile. It probably just looked like a cringe, but that was close enough.
As soon as they were back, Clint planned on convincing Cap and Tony to give up on the stupid camping trip and go home, where Bruce wouldn’t get mauled by a bear.
Before Wolverine could reply, a swift kick connected with his head. As he toppled, he released Peter—right off of the roof top.
Peter swung his way over to the living room, flipping down from the roof to his feet and tugging his mask off at last.
"God I hope so," the other man sighed sadly. He reached over, placing a hand on Bruce's shoulder. "We can't give up now!"
“Okay!” Wade announced, sniffing dramatically as he started to knead the blob. “Just gotta make some balls.”
"Hurt? Where?" Clint asked, looking him over. "Oh. You mean..." He nodded slowly, catching on to what Bruce meant. "Did I hurt you?" Blue eyes met Bruce’s brown ones as Hawkeye’s voice dropped to a mumble. “I didn't mean to hurt you, Bruce."
Hulk was his buddy, but he rarely ever got to see Bruce. The man had his nose stuck to his laptop when he wasn’t big and green.
"Huh?" Peter did his best to detach Wade's arms from around his waist, frowning. "What FOR? I said I had to go sleep when I left!"
Dropping the blanket aside, he ran his fingers through his hair in a futile try at making it behave. “And what’s up with Bruce? He just ran off! Forget about bears, now he’s out there with Loki and doesn’t know it. I thought about bringing Identicards, but no, I talked myself into thinking this was gonna be a nice quiet normal camping trip where the biggest thing we’d have to face was telling the team we’re engaged!” He looked like maybe he wanted to pull on his hair, but instead sighed and propped his chin up on one hand. “I just wish we noticed Loki this morning when we were all in one place.”
“Why the hell are you worried? It looks like they kissed and made up. Enjoy the peace and quiet while it lasts—they’ll find something to bicker about again sooner or later.”
With both of them paddling (or maybe just Steve putting in an honest effort), they rocketed up to the sand bar fast enough that the nose of the boat slid up onto the shore almost a foot. Cap wasted no time hopping out and hauling the kayak, Tony and all, further up onto the sandy spit. Shading his eyes, the big blond looked around for the shark before he stuck a hand out to help Tony out of the boat.
“I’m not here to fight,” he clarified, holding up the book. “I got what I came for and I’m leaving!”
Tony Stark had asked if ‘Roger Barton’ was Hawkeye’s husband. Was the man gay? Some groups on the internet thought so, as Loki discovered when he learned not to do internet searches for ‘Hulkeye.’
There was indeed a hotdog stand there, even so early in the morning. A tall, gaunt man stood behind the stall, bony white fingers holding a hotdog in one hand and a bottle of ketchup in the other.
A red masked face popped up into view. For a second, she could have mistaken it for Spider-Man, but this mask was different.
"It's okay," Bruce assured Cap, stepping back over with a small vial of liquid that looked suspiciously like the stuff Doom had put into the goblet for him. "Alright. The samples compare as close as I can get without having Doom's formula."
“Stark. I hate to be the one to tell you—and especially saying this about my enemy—but you are nowhere near good enough for the captain. He may be foolishly patriotic, overly self righteous and far too much of a do-gooder—but you are more...like me.” Loki flashed a smile, gesturing openly with both hands to Tony. “To ever imagine the two of you together is ridiculous. I can almost hear the public outcry already.” The black haired demigod placed a hand to his ear and smirked.
"Aye, I glimpsed her before. She retreated into the house," he assured Cap, pulling him closer by the arm to wrap him in a hug. "Come, let us follow her example—you are frozen!"
The skinny scientist was bobbing in the water off where Clint had heard the mutter before. He swam quickly up to the side of the rock and grabbed it, looking over at Clint with practically glowing green eyes. Hulk might not be so asleep anymore.
"I-I think he's inside the house." She covered a small cough with one hand, glancing back the way she had come at the mansion. "How did you get inside? There's a shield around the place.
Tony looked up at him with unrestrained adoration--which probably just looked like shiny-eyed drunk happy face to Steve, thanks to Señor Tequila--and patted one of his hands.
"Sure, let's see if the castle survives Steve making it first, though. No offense, Cap--you might need a more delicate touch on that." He got up and sat his drink aside, stepping over to look at the sandcastle critically, pulling out the sketches he'd made for it to compare them. "Hmm...left tower's a little short, and the parapets are gonna be crowded, but otherwise not too bad!"
"You know, that sounds like something that would happen around here." Carol sighed, watching Clint, the one that was still in the cell because he was NOT a robot sent to kill them all.
“Why even ask?” Peter sighed. “You guys obviously recognize him.” Oh, boy, were they really gonna have the exact conversation he’d been putting off in the amount of time it took Wade to run up the hill and back down again?
The storm had been swept away, leaving only thin wispy clouds drifting in a bright blue sky. Peter could see all the way out to sea now and sure enough, a kayak was making its way toward the sandy shoreline.
Tony automatically stuck a hand out and grabbed Steve's shoulder to keep from getting knocked sideways.
"Don't even think about it, sir," the AI said drolly. "I advise you to go to the workshop and replace the Arc reactor."
Just across the thinner Southern section of the water sat a campsite with big brightly colored tents in a circle. There had to be at least four or five. In the middle of the camp sat a fancy barbecue grill, a handful of folding chairs, stacks of coolers and lots of other camping gear.
Meanwhile on screen, the first teen mom was taking a walk with her baby in a stroller, stalking the overly tall haired young man that she had set her sights on. The baby's muzzle had been removed, but it was reaching out at everything it passed.
“Yeah, what a relief!” Peter said, hopping to his feet and sticking his untouched cup of coffee on the table by Tony. Grabbing Matt’s hand, he shot Cap and Tony a big smile and started for the edge of the clearing. “The old bear encounter thing, we should’ve known! I’ll bet Wade’s up there laying the tent to rest—c’mon, Matt, let’s go!” He made a big show of leading Matt toward the trail up to their campsite.
"No hard feelings here," Peter assured him, picking up the last bite of his forgotten s'more and popping it into his mouth. "It's wrong to out somebody without their permission, so that's fair. I-I guess I'm just surprised I never noticed." He turned to Cap seriously. "Do YOU need any advice? Like, if one of the gay Avengers is you, I won't tell anybody, but I'm pretty sure in the 1940s the only advice you'd get for that is 'don't be gay', so..." He smiled sheepishly. "I guess, what's a guy like me gonna be able to say that'll help out Captain America, anyway..."
"Thor's my drinking buddy. He'll be here...he's just a little slow in the head," the blond muttered. Clint tugged on his restraints. "What the hell are these made out of? Vibranium?"
"Hello?" He called, carefully stepping around the glowing fires in the smoke. The flames had spread quickly through the office building, blazing through the piles of papers and the bits of furniture that were flammable. Steve squinted, able to see someone across the room.
That kind of reaction pretty much answered Clint’s question and he wasn’t sure what to do with that. Bruce liked HIM? The walking disaster that was Clint Barton was an acquired taste. Watching Bruce, he dimmed his smile and tried to look offended.
Shrugging, the black-haired man put the other blanket on top of the first and tucked the edges in around Steve's shoulders as well. "I'm gonna go check on Pepper and then see how Bruce's doing. Tell Jarvis if you need anything, even a sandwich or something, okay?"
Wolverine just shook his head, grunting angrily. He pulled the visor of his hat down again with a big hand, glancing at Peter from under the edge.
“Oh, yeah, of course I do!” Peter’s sort-of-boyfriend looked at him for help and then coughed. “I can eat my weight in tacos.”
“YUP!” With his face glowing, Clint couldn’t look Bruce in the eye. JEEZ. Gathering the sunscreen off his arms on his fingers, he hurriedly coated his face. Hopefully the sunscreen was opaque enough to cover all his damned blushing.
After showers and dry clothes had happened, he and Bruce had settled onto the floor to play Blackjack. It was the easiest game Clint knew and hopefully that meant that it wouldn’t stress Bruce out. His first choice had been Go Fish—before he realized that that had the word ‘fish’ in it and might somehow lead to a conversation about the damned tackle box.
“I wouldn’t lecture you if you took better care of yourself! Every time I turn around,” Cap grabbed Clint’s arm and lifted it, gesturing to the blood, “you’re bleeding again!”
Those two really were the parents of the group. If they had an explosive divorce, where would that leave New York? Or the planet, when the next alien conqueror came in?
"If you were a robot you wouldn't be shaking like this. A robot wouldn't have...ah, drawn out the other guy yesterday." He coughed lightly.
"Thor. Someone has to talk to you about this. I know it will be hard to hear..." Loki leaned over and held Thor's wrist gently. "No one likes your hugs, buddy. It makes us uncomfortable."
"Wait. That stuff was made to work on super soldiers, right? Maybe it has some kind of residual effect," Carol offered. "Or he's a robot," she added, shrugging.
"Yeah, but he tried to talk to me. He asked why you changed to him." Clint snorted, rubbing the back of his neck. "Then he changed back without a fuss." The blond looked puzzled and then smiled up at Bruce warmly. "I think that was a first."
With a wry smile, Bruce swiped some sunscreen off of his nose and reached over, smudging it onto Clint's nose as well.
Why was taking him to Tony the default action? Most people would have taken him to the medical room.
Opening the door flap, Steve leaned out and zipped the window shut. Stepping back inside, he gave Wade a tight smile.
"Oh, that's not necessary," he said quickly, waving his hands and mustering a smile. "I nap upside-down on the roof ALL the time back home--sometimes it's like I don't even need a bed. I figured I'd just do that here!"
"Okay, ow. You better watch your head!" Seeing Cap heading for that side, too, the billionaire crossed his arms. "Okay, I'm pretty good at frisbee, but not three-on-one good. A little help, here?"
Tony groggily registered the sound of the bedroom door opening, and burrowed a little deeper into his hammock. Ugh, another day of playing professional, impartial co-leader with Steve, or at least a few more hours. He'd gone to bed intending to "sleep in" as long as possible in the hopes that Matt would leave and he could finally talk to Steve in private. The vacation had been so stressful so far, though, that Tony had tossed and turned (or maybe 'rocked and rolled' was a better term, because hammock) and fallen asleep in the small hours of the morning.
With a very worried frown, Cap nodded and left, probably to find Tony. Now that he had a moment, Clint was beginning to wonder about all those things Spidey had said about his two fearless leaders.
"I can't take this anymore." Clint dropped the vest down and abruptly they were drenched anew. "Are you...agh." He shrugged a shoulder. "Do you..." He shook his head, water dripping off. "Can I...can I k-kiss you, or are you going to turn green?" He stared up at Bruce shyly.
"So we don't become bug splats," Spider-Man said promptly, dusting himself off and starting down the street without waiting for Deadpool to head that way. "C'mon, I think I saw the sign you were talking about."
"Then whoever left with Dr. Banner was not what they seemed," the computer said matter-of-factly. "I can play the footage for you, sir. Barton left with Dr. Banner late last night and they have not returned."
"But Spider-Man is an ally of ours! He is no villain—this man lies!" Thor was equally deafening, and was about ready to go flying out the window to set Jameson right. It was a good thing nobody had mentioned to the Asgardian that they knew where Jameson worked.
"Yeah, exactly how old IS he, anyway?" Tony butted in, exchanging a glance with Steve. Oh, no. This was bad. For one thing, Peter didn't actually know Wade's age, and for two, he was pretty sure it would sound way older than he looked, even. He stood there for a long moment, willing his eyes to be as misty as he could make them. Blinking a few times, he focused on the fire and let his shoulders slump defeatedly.
When the car seemed to have steadied out, Steve leaned back against the cage again, grabbing the man by the shirt cuff.
“You know, that’s not a bad idea, young man.” Dropping her tote back under the umbrella, she slipped her cover up over her head and tossed it aside, starting off the beach confidently. She braided her hair as she walked, not bothering to tie it off.
As the blond made to get up, he turned and gawked at Lola’s legs as the woman stopped on his other side to admire the castle.
It’d be a shame if he didn’t, because Peter was sleeping just down the hall. If Cap had to explain it again, it'd be hard to do without being suspicious.
Tony went to retrieve some spare blankets from the closet. "I bet Bruce's already cracked the code and he's making the cure right now," he commented. "When he's not all green, he's a huge nerd, really."
Wearily, he replied, "The last Clint I saw left when I wasn't looking. I guess you're a different one."
"Yours?" Steve asked warily. "What is it that you want with Thor? He's a little out of your league in a one-on-one fight."
"Honestly?" He wasn't sure what it was. He didn't usually give Clint much thought. Then again, Clint was usually perched somewhere very high and far away, not this close to him. Not when Bruce was himself.
Cap started off down the beach at a brisk pace. Okay, he was practically jogging. He didn’t slow his pace at all as he charged up the stone stairs to their cabin.
In his weakened state, there weren't many options besides jumping out the window or hiding somewhere, and he was sure Doom had cameras all over the place in here.
“You’ll regret that, Rogers!” Loki spun on his heel and marched back into camp, wringing water from his long black hair and glaring daggers back over his shoulder at them.
“Hey, Cap?” Hawkeye asked from the back, waving a hand between the front seats quickly. “Can you hand me a soda? Bruce fell asleep on our cooler back here…”
"No, no, that's exactly what we can do," Peter realized, blinking. "The site doesn't even have to exist because we won't have a phone or computer to show it to them, so I can just explain the kayak game and say I read about it online! Yesterday, maybe. Before my phone died." Pulling said phone out of his pocket, he turned the power off pointedly.
"After you've lived in a few jungles, this doesn't feel like 'hot weather' anymore," he admitted. Clint was pretty sure he was sweating at least a little bit, though. "...I guess maybe I'm just so used to covering up anywhere there are other people, it's automatic?" The scientist offered, seeing that he wasn't buying the first excuse.
With that, he turned and dashed off after the King of Wakanda, adding loudly, "Hey T'Challa, you should play frisbee with us tonight!" It was childish and he knew it, but if Cap was being that careful not to let T'Challa hear their conversation a second ago, he probably wouldn't pursue it further. Or make a scene in front of Tony.
Then again, he's said last time that Detroit was Peter's house. What did that make Dallas, Grand Central Station?
“Good morning Peter!” Cap barked around his waffle, dropping the rest of the sandwich back onto the plate. “I’ll have another batch ready in a minute. Do you drink coffee?”
"Er....hmm." Tony paused and hovered there, bringing a hand to the chin of his mask like he could stroke his goatee through it. "Jarvis? Check in on Dr. Banner for me real quick. I mean, I'm sure he's in his room, he hasn't left it for a week, but..."
“That’s an interesting thought, but you’re dead wrong.” Slinging the pair of jeans over his shoulder, he gestured back at the door with a hand. “I’m not the one you should be talking to. That’d be Wade. He and Peter were friends way before I came along. There’s no way they aren’t dating.”
"Yup, that's us," Tony said, as if challenging her to question it. "And he's a high schooler, so...HOW do you know him again?"
"At this point I'd be happy if they didn't kill you," Peter whispered back, shaking his head. "You don't get it--they're acting exactly how they did when they thought this lady earlier was hitting on me. They must think you're my boyfriend."
“Uh huh,” Clint said, distracted by the green in Bruce’s eyes. That kept happening and he was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with him that wasn’t anger.
The Avengers had been in and out of their home all day. Just when Loki thought he had a moment to make a clone come out of the mansion and kiss him, one of the Avengers would pass through.
Starting after Deadpool, Clint felt his food sinking in. Why did Cap have to be right about eating before doing stuff?
"...Well, one of you is a sneaky bastard," Tony said, popping up the mask and arching an eyebrow. "You're gonna hate me for this, but I've got to do the other tests later—and you two get locked up 'til I get back. No tracking bracelets, just locked up."
“Doom wanted Thor TOO?” Tony nearly spat his drink. Luckily, Carol and Bruce interrupted the direction the conversation was going. The door slid open and the cosmic-powered Avengers led Bruce inside.
"Hey, he's red..." He mumbled something under his breath and then leaned back down to look at Spider-Man. "Hotdogs?"
"Just head up toward the Baxter Building," Peter said as casually as he could. His aunt looked at him oddly, but he only smiled in response and shrugged. The Baxter Building was not only nowhere near the same direction as their place, but it was also closed to the public at this time of the evening.
“No, cousin,” Loki told him quickly, quirking an eyebrow. Leaning a hand on the gate bars, he tipped his head curiously. “He hasn’t called lately. Is he alright?”
Tony, he noticed, leaned against the wall near the door and crossed his arms like he was waiting for something.
Well, nobody would guess THIS guy was Spider-Man, at least...or capable of things like climbing skyscrapers without accidentally killing himself, either. Ugh.
"Uh. Yeah." The Hulk actually sounded...awkward. He covered it up with a gruff growl and hurried past Hawkeye and into the big hole in the side of the mansion.
“Are we really gonna do this again?” Peter wondered aloud gloomily. “I care about you both. Nothing’s changed, here. I’m just asking you not to completely tank any respect Cap and Tony have left for me—if they have any left at all. They figured out Wade’s Deadpool within minutes of meeting him, Matt. Minutes.”
“No, wait.” Cap shook his head. “No, it has to be Peter. He said he couldn’t bring the boyfriend to his school. Then he said the reason was because he had a bunch of psycho bad guys.” The blond rubbed his forehead. “Wait, why would he worry about villains finding out about his boyfriend if their villains didn’t know who HE was himself? It must be Spider-Man…I guess,” Cap added, cringing a bit.
"It would clean the scrape out really well," he ventured, after what felt like a really long time. "Do you really think..." He paused, looking down into the water pensively. "If Cap and Tony really are together, and having issues, that's bad for everybody. Imagine if the team split up. We should try and help mediate."
But the kids weren’t headed for a sandcastle. They raced up to one of the giant fancy umbrellas and flung the water bucket at the woman lounging there, who screamed and jumped to her feet—shaking water from her book angrily.
"On it," Tony said briefly, turning and rocketing away. This bombing thing could wait. As much as he hated to leave Captain America and Clint to whatever situation they were in, if the Hulk got loose in New York it would be a disaster that could get people killed. Lots of people.
"Hold it. You wait up here," Tony said, rocketing down next to her. "If Doom gives his word he'll stick with it; if not, he might try and take me prisoner, too. Why? I have no idea, but I also have no idea why he wants Steve, so it could happen." He shrugged. "If it does, you're my backup—get some help, don't try diving in here after me, okay? This place has like 200 Doombots guarding it."
Thor could move very fast for such a big person. Just as Loki had started to topple, the blanket pulling one foot out from under him and the other surrendering his weight unknowingly, the thunder god swept in and caught him in his arms. Loki wound up cradled princess-style, muscular arms wrapped around his waist hugging him against Thor's even more muscular chest.
Hawkeye panted, holding his bow in a death grip. He was covered in thick slimy algae and muck, which mixed with the blood running down his arm.
"Master Stark left the Baxter Building and started to return here, but made a detour," Jarvis explained. "Sensor scans revealed a trail of magic residue from the Baxter Building out into the Hudson River. I believe he is following it."
Running fingers through his hair, Steve sat back to look at him, tears outright rolling down his face.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, shoulders slouching. When he opened his eyes again, they were soft and brown—and sad. He avoided looking at anyone, focusing on the toes of his sneakers.
"This is awesome, isn't this awesome? We should do this, like, every night. Morning. Whatever." Deadpool pulled up his own mask only enough for his mouth to be visible and took a large bite of his hotdog.
At any rate, he was totally preoccupied with this. Tony, meanwhile, had decided to "wake up" now that he and Cap weren't alone anymore. The whole awkward marriage conversation could be saved for another day, right? Right.
If they planned to actually do the race part of this, he might have been a bit more pressured, but the truth was that the whole plan was just to get Steve and Tony out on the water and then keep them there as long as possible. Well, Peter had a side plan to nudge Clint and Dr. Banner into going for a kayak ride together to cheer up the grumpy archer, too, but they didn't know that part yet. Matt and Wade were hanging out here a few more days just for the sake of matchmaking the Avengers' co-leaders, which was pretty awesome of them (even if Matt did seem kind of quiet and grumpy about it this morning.)
“What? No, of course not,” he said, raising an eyebrow. “It just startled me, and I’m pretty sure Hulk gave it quite a scare after my heart rate spiked. Like I said, the wildlife around here has never bothered me before.”
Unlike Tony, Cap wasn’t wearing sunglasses and it was very easy to see the sadness in his eyes. Slowly, he ran his fingers through his hair.
"Jarvis, can you get somebody to bring Clint the pizza from his room?" Bruce asked the computer, glancing up instinctively even though he knew the cameras were really placed just about everywhere. "I've got to keep an eye on both of them."
“How you wound up friends with the kid,” Tony prodded, shading his eyes and scanning the sky for any sign of Thor. Steve didn’t see anybody flying around up there. Birds were singing in the forest, though, and it was a beautiful sunny day now.
Steve knocked on the cage again and said in a voice as raspy as Wolverine's, "Please pull over, sir."
For as long as Clint knew the scientist, physical contact was a big no-no for him. Any unexpected contact had the potential to summon the Hulk and therefore, all the Avengers tried not to touch Bruce. Ever.
Clint followed quietly, pizza balanced on one hand and blanket held with the other. He seemed eager to escape the policemen devouring babies.
"Tony..." Pepper sighed, then coughed. She sounded exasperated. "He's been in his workshop for days. Who knows when he'll notice we're gone?"
He paused, thinking back on the chaos as Clint had explained it. "But we'll talk about all of that when we get back to the medical room." Picking her up as softly as he could, he stood up. "There's something I have to ask you, but please don't tell Tony about it, alright?"
Heading straight for the pot, Clint burned his fingers as he shook it. The satisfying sloshing sound was a relief, though. He’d had one hell of a day!
"I know that these are not the best of circumstances, but it is good to see you again, brother," he said sincerely.
He shot Steve a meaningful glance as he said it. Matt was safer sticking with them than on his own, between the super villains and the local bears.
"Have you still not put the pieces together?" Doom grumbled, lowering his hand. He seemed a bit deflated by such a response, actually. "Thor, too, is only a pawn in the schemes of Doom. He is the key, however—the one who can deliver what I desire demands the Asgardian in return. Childishly simple to do!"
Bruce coughed and fidgeted with his wet hair, which was hanging in his eyes. After a moment of this, he gave up, looking at the ground tiredly.
Bruce coughed at that—thankfully not choking on his pizza, although it might've looked like it—because he and the Hulk technically couldn't age or die. That made THEM soulless by some people's standards. Then again, the Hulk was some soulless, godless monster by a LOT of people's standards...
"...No, but I should've included you two," the armored Avenger grumbled. "What's Loki even doing here?"
"This is only the second time he's shown up on the days we agreed were mine," Bruce sighed, looking at Clint for a long moment and wishing he could add that the archer wasn't to blame for that and have him believe it. If Bruce was completely disinterested, his heart wouldn't have been racing, now would it?
Hawkeye watched him in the reflection on the shop's door for the second time. His expression was hard to read. It was somewhere between confusion and frustration.
"Well. No." Clint followed him around the bench, his feet splashing through a small puddle. "Hulk’s not a big talker, okay?"
"You okay?" Clint came in, blanket wrapped around his shoulders still. He came over and leaned on the counter beside Bruce.
Zoning back out of his exhausted thoughts, Clint frowned as he tuned into the endless chatter that was Deadpool.
Bothered, Steve knelt behind a large rock near the lake’s shore. It was up the hill a bit, which made it easy to spot the blond Adonis down by the water.
“He’s obviously trying to relax and take a vacation just like us,” Peter said hastily, sticking a hand to Wade’s back and towing him in the direction of the Avengers’ side of the lake. “Let’s leave him be!”
"Alone?" Doom looked at him skeptically. Pepper, meanwhile, was doing her best NOT to look at Doom, Clint noticed.
At that moment, Wade and Matt arrived behind Peter. Wade dropped his friend’s arm and ran to throw himself into Cap’s arms, fake-crying loudly.
"It seems Thor did not care to aid his friends," Doom commented drolly, placing the tray on the table and selecting from the beakers of colorful green and yellow liquids there.
The cabin door pushed back open, both Cap and Wade stepping out with a concerned-looking Peter in tow.
“My new friends?” Loki asked with an air of innocence as he glanced back at the camp full of people. Turning back to his brother, his smiled turned wicked. “Well, you could say they’re companions, witnesses…collateral. Only a fool goes camping alone. Haven’t you heard? There are more than bears in these woods.”
'Like the other Clint did' was practically stated on the end silently, even though he didn't actually say it aloud.
Loki snickered. It was time to move to plan C: get the Hulk to break open a big hole and then jump out while everyone was distracted. Right. That would work. Why did the voice in the back of his head say that it was a bad idea, then?
Maybe because Tony couldn't figure out exactly what, either. What did Steve want from him, anyway? First they avoided each other, then Steve made sure he got to bed okay drunk and fed him waffles in the morning, and now there was the whole family sandcastle time and 'we're his dads' to that babe in the bikini.
“I’ll help!” Tony called over the din, turning and grabbing hold of the kayak. He knew perfectly well that Steve was strong enough to carry it on his own, so he must have been sticking close out of sheer stubbornness.
Cap made his way quickly and quietly, though a bit clumsily, down the hall, keeping an eye out in the dark for any movement. Maybe the power going out was just another part of Doom's plan. He could knock out the power to distract everyone and then snag Thor without the Avengers knowing and be off. It sort of made sense.
Wordlessly, Bruce grabbed a fistful of popcorn from the bowl the moment Thor got near him, and proceeded to munch on it without looking up from the TV. He was staring through it, actually, too tired to think.
"And here I thought Steve would be the problem, with the shield-throwing reflexes and all," Tony muttered.
Peter shielded his eyes from the rain, watching the waves dashing against the beach. One tiny cloud had been whipped into a roaring rain and thunder storm in a matter of maybe fifteen minutes. There was a wall of fog out across the water, completely obscuring the sandbar where Cap and Tony had last been seen. It was a good thing he’d actually seen them go ashore, or he would’ve been worried they were out on that choppy water.
“I think I can put off getting yelled at by Jameson for a few more days,” Peter said immediately, stepping back and grinning. “Lunch and the danger room with you guys sounds like way more fun.”
“Hm?” The blond croaked, squinting up at Bruce through an eye. He chewed for a moment and scooted to sit up. “What?”
Right behind him. But before he could react, he was rolling across the rooftop—someone massively heavy pinning him down, growling.
"Getting hotdogs or whatever you said you were gonna do," the red and blue hero said, waving a hand in a "shoo" kind of gesture. "What are you followin' me around for?"
“If they are the dangerous kind of enemies, does that mean he’s a hero?” The captain asked, concerned. “I wasn’t sure if he knew about Spider-Man or not.”
“Unicorn tastes like confetti cake,” Clint replied, taking another bite. Why they didn’t just call it confetti cake was beyond him. Maybe unicorns were trendy. Swallowing down his ice cream, he lay an arm over Bruce’s shoulders and sighed. “I wonder what the skunk flavor was.”
“I suppose there’s no need to deny it,” Lola complained, rolling her eyes. “But if you think I’m the one messing up the weather, you’re wrong. I was otherwise preoccupied, I assure you.”
Why had he said they weren’t together? It sounded like Bruce wasn’t against the idea! Dammit, dammit!
Having just gotten a couple hours of solid sleep, the blond felt way better. Not ‘woohoo’ better, but better than before.
"Steve Rogers, there is no reason for you to remain weakened," Doom said, though he didn't seem surprised at the refusal. He held the goblet and swished the contents, looking down into it idly. "I only resorted to such things in the first place to remove you from the city quietly."
So he was a little bitter about that particular comment. So Steve's moping was starting to really annoy him. It was tough to tell what Cap even hoped would happen, here. If he was worried about staying in the closet, he wouldn't have wanted to try and be an example of two men together for Peter to see that that was okay. Was it just Tony in particular he had decided against, then? If so, ouch. All a guy had to do was slip up and drink half of a bottle of tequila ONE time...
"Okay, fine. They've been gone for hours, but we'll wait some more. Couldn't hurt, right?" He stepped past them toward the elevator back up to the rest of the mansion. "If it turns out they're being tortured, waiting was your idea, big guy."
Bruce would have used the box if he had found it, so it wasn’t him. Tony and Cap had both demanded that he hand the box to Bruce—so they would have given it to him the moment they found it. Same went for Peter, who had been there for the whole tackle box conversation.
"Cap seemed worried about Tony when he talked to me on the beach," Bruce said, placing his other hand over Clint's. "I think he's trying to focus on the rest of the team's troubles to avoid thinking about his own. We were meddling before to try and help them, but I think Peter being here gives them something to focus on besides themselves as well." He frowned. "We need to give them some time together alone. Separate the group somehow in a way that leaves the two of them together."
"Oh yeah." The blond looked up at him. "Everybody thinks I'm a clone. Hey." He smoothed a hand through his hair too. "I think I told you that last night."
"There you go—now you can run away if you feel that's necessary." He sighed and did his best to comb his hair out of his face, looking around the room. There was a pizza box sitting there on the floor beside them and the bed.
“He seemed kinda nervous,” Clint observed, raising an eyebrow. Or just really uncomfortable. With as much guff as Clint gave him and Tony, the man was as patient as a saint. Reluctant to let go of the scientist’s hand, Clint lingered for a minute. “I think he and Tony aren’t gonna work it out. Every time I see them, they look either pissed or miserable.”
“There’s plenty to go around,” Tony said drolly from over by the campfire. Peter felt his face heat up. Right, they were right next to the Avengers’ camp now. Thanks a lot, Hulk.
Tony didn’t want to leave Steve here, but getting Clint and Pepper out was a step in the right direction. The only other real option was to leave them ALL there and go get an Arc reactor.
Slapping a hand onto his side to show that he was listening, Loki swooned from the pain. How had he forgotten how that felt? Straightening up and taking a shaky breath, he turned around to face the Hulk.
"Look, every minute we spend bickering about this is one more minute I'm not curing Cap. This thing's really weakened him—if I don't find a cure soon, he might have trouble breathing."
Tony now looked unsure what to think, and only squinted at him a little. Peter couldn't blame him, there. His mind was racing, trying to figure out some alternate meaning for 'consider yourself single' and coming up with zilch. Maybe...since he'd been talking to Peter's ex, Wade could be confirming that she was very much over him? Great, even more lies to pile on top of what was already here. Peter kind of wished he could tell Cap and Tony the truth, that he wanted to date Wade, but Wade himself didn't even know that yet.
"Is this about spending all day away from the rest of the group? I thought Tony said this vacation was unstructured."
“I like fishing, but what I actually had in mind was swimming. The water should be nice and warm today.”
“I don’t mind. We’re gonna use it for a boat race.” Clint paid the lady and took the stack of maps, circling the small store to find Peter and Bruce. Even with the gawky kid along, they were gonna eat some damn ice-cream.
“Real soon! Bye bye, smoochies!” Wade cooed, hanging up. As soon as the call ended, Peter got a short text from Wade with a kissy face and a…palm tree?
Without comment, Wolverine hopped onto his bike, revved the engine and sped off. The mercenary watched him go, chest deflating.
Clint shifting a bit must have disturbed Bruce's silent sleep, because he stirred a little, sighing slowly. Noticing he was nestled up against someone, he suddenly froze, then cautiously opened his eyes. They were still brown, luckily.
He turned back to Loki and quickly began to bandage him, taping the gauze in place around the edges.
"What you do to Banner?" The Hulk demanded, snapping his attention back to the present. Apparently the conversation they'd had back there was memorable...
Swallowing barely chewed pancake, he washed it down with a swig of coffee as he stepped up beside Bruce.
The captain went along, climbing to his feet. He stood up slowly, taking time to stretch his back. Hey, at his age, he couldn't be too careful. His throat hurt so badly now, Doom could do whatever he wanted as long as he gave him a glass of water first.
Or Spider-Man, actually. It was no secret that the chipper neighborhood hero was welcome among the Avengers. Both Cap and Tony could agree that he was not only an excellent person and a beloved friend—but the child they never knew they had.
"You're not fooling anybody," Tony told him, patting his back sympathetically. "Bruce doesn't seem like romance is even on his radar. I'm not sure he even realizes you're hitting on him." He paused to glance out at the silhouettes of Cap and the skinny scientist walking along the edge of the shore near the waves, frowning.
While he was wishing for the ideal, he just wished they were on the fishing boat, alone, and that the Hulk wouldn't tamper with his pulse for once.
"Oh, thank god. You just, earlier you said..." He shook his head, sitting up straight. "Nah, moving on. A-hem. You got this! He already said he likes you, so there's no way to lose. Just look at him and say what you just told me."
The thin man crossed his arms, changing to frowning at the shield like it had somehow offended him. Tony had a newspaper—which was made from paper that changed magica…digitally—in one hand, the title of the cover article showing just the word ‘scandal.’ Steve was fairly certain that Tony was the only one who cared about what the public was assuming about the Avengers.
This seemed to make Deadpool extremely pleased, and he pulled Spider-Man up, then into a tight hug with zeal. He smashed Peter's face against his shoulder, rubbing his back cheerfully.
“They’ve never bothered me before,” he said, glancing at Thor. It wasn’t exactly typical for Thor and Bruce to hang out together, Tony thought. It wasn’t typical for Bruce to be Bruce instead of the Hulk, really. Great, even they got more alone time than him and Steve at the moment…
"Hey, I have a great idea. Let's all relax and order pizza. I’m sure some place has a backup generator!" People were so grumpy, they clearly didn't need to wait for somebody to cook dinner...especially if Thor had no idea what he was cooking.
This time he just smiled, though, and agreed easily, "Good thinking--we'll know where everything is, even if everybody else has to go hunt for the flags on sight. Oh, uh..." he nodded over at Matt, raising an eyebrow. "Is he gonna be able to do that?"
“PETER!” A loud voice shrieked, right before the owner slammed into the three of them. Tony stumbled as Cap did, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Peter being lifted off the ground in a pair of muscular arms. Steve caught Tony and stood him on his feet, turning to face whoever it was like he was expecting a fight.
"Heeey, Avengers, anybody home? Hopefully you're locking bad guys out with the shield, not getting locked in."
“Not right now,” he said stubbornly. “Clint needs to get patched up, Loki’s across the lake, and by the way, there’s a lake monster, too. It almost ate Clint. And where did Thor and Dr. Banner go?”
"Not love-love," Loki continued, gesturing with his hands in the air. No, he wasn’t in love with anyone. That was foolish. "Like...brotherly love."
“Well, the sun’s back, so you’ll just have to wonder about that one for now! Eheheh.” Peter paused and glanced around, realizing that the various Avengers had slowly gathered on the beach to welcome their leaders back. Even Thor and Loki—still looking like Lola—were there, arms around each other’s waists. T’challa still held a coffee mug. Dr. Banner and Hawkeye actually looked relaxed for once.
“With?” Wade asked, quirking a blond eyebrow. “Um,” he said slowly, looking them both over. Clint recognized that look—he was sizing them up. “We bros, my dudes,” the man laughed thinly. “You know, just bros!”
Though it certainly bothered Loki, he thought, unable to help a small smirk. The look on Loki’s face had been priceless.
"Yeah." Clint shut the garden fence. "I heard you the first time, buddy." The man gave Bruce an attempted playful nudge in the arm and continued on. "So, sandwiches?"
"Alright, fine. But he stays in the straps until I get back," Hawkeye muttered, heading for the door.
The scientist stopped and turned toward him, placing the hand that wasn't on Clint's back onto his shoulder.
“Like you said, it’s great for team building. The rest of the team’s over there making s’mores—shall we?”
One of those moody shadows happened to be hovering over the three of them at that moment, casting both Cap and Tony in ominous lighting.
It was a silly thought, but if a villain had actually fallen in LOVE with Peter, there was a chance that his goodness might be a catalyst for change. Some of the villains in the world had gotten that way through no fault of their own and maybe, just maybe, one of them wanted a way out.
Abruptly, Peter felt terrible for poor Cap. He'd try talking to Tony alone, he decided, and figuring out what HE thought was going on. Maybe it wasn't actually divorce yet, maybe there was still a chance. Maybe this was why he'd stowed away in a car trunk for 10+ hours.
"Hm?" Clint hummed, crawling into bed. Pulling the covers up to his chin, he deflated with a sigh. "Cap and me got kidnapped so they're making Thor babysit me until Tony and Carol get Cap and me back. That’s the gist."
Well, Tony had been heading out to retrieve Cap when Peter had had to go home...but that was as good as done, since Tony wouldn't leave Cap to Doctor Doom. Right?
“Hey other me.” The purple Avenger grinned down at him. “I've got some more of those special arrows, just for you.”
"Oh, my god," Peter groaned, slumping in the big man's grip. Being as flexible as he was, that made his torso and head hang backward like they were dancing a tango and Wolverine had led him into a low dip. He stayed hanging upside-down, though, letting his arms hang free as well.
"If he's after the impostor Hawkeye like we think he is, neither of us has what we want—maybe he'll trade Cap and the others for that so-called Hawkeye back home."
Floating above the water, kicking around like he was falling, hovered Clint. A dim green glow wrapped around him as he drifted to the shoreline. As soon as he was over solid ground, the magic vanished and he dropped onto his butt in the mud.
"I'll watch them," Bruce volunteered warily. He didn't plan on letting his Clint out of his sight, at this rate.
Glancing up the trail to make sure Wade was preoccupied with picking the best route to the “shortcut”, Peter turned his attention back to the stitches, sighing.
"Heeeey buddy," Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, said cheerily. The crazy merc was in disguise—which meant he was still wearing his usual mask, only with a sleazy mustache and giant rimmed glasses over it. To complete his look, he had thrown on a long curly haired wig that went past his shoulders in an almost hobo-like fashion. "You wouldn't happen to have a spare wheel for a Harley in there," he said smoothly, sliding a hand inside Peter's jacket to check the interior pocket, "would ya?"
“How dare you!” The God of Mischief managed, eyes on Wade as he bobbed to the surface. Loki spotted his book and a tiny umbrella drifting past them and Peter thought he could see Loki’s face redden with rage.
“That makes the trunk…Ugh,” Clint grumbled, finishing off his sandwich. “Look, I don’t care what they think. I know Hulk and I are just buddies.”
There was the familiar metallic sound of Mjolnir singing through the air, and then Thor had descended upon all of them in a swish of red cloak.
"Look, let's just keep our feelings to ourselves," Loki said at last, hugging the blanket as insecurely as he could. Maybe he could muster a tear or something and really make his brother upset!
"If there was another that he would be more loath to part with, then you could go free and they would be captive instead. The archer tells me of a woman called Jane."
Unlike him, Steve wasn’t standing rigid, braced for impact. He had a hand over his face and was shaking his head and good god—was he crying?
“I wasn’t sure you even could swim.” They were alone? Like, for real? The thought made Clint’s stomach flutter a bit, but he just smiled. Thank GOD he didn’t give that tackle box back!
“Wait a sec.” Clint grabbed Bruce and turned him back enough to look him in the eye. “Uh…” He croaked, losing his courage. “I-I should get your nose.”
That blocked the view of the toaster Bruce had been staring at, snapping him out of his daze. He looked at Clint, too exhausted to make any excuses.
"Yeah, I noticed," Clint chuckled, walking over. He paused in front of Bruce, looking down at him. "I can tell. Look. We can skip the sandwiches if you want. I know...uh." He shrugged a shoulder, mumbling and staring down at his feet. "You know."
“Uhhhhhh…” Wade began weakly, glancing at Peter for some kind of cue, but not waiting long enough to get one. “Peter, uh, went to check out my college. In one of those programs that let people…check out colleges.”
“We’ll talk to him, Tony,” Cap agreed, resting a hand on his fiance’s shoulder and turning his attention back to Thor. “I’m sure Peter is being careful who he places his trust in.”
Cap came over to Clint, taking his elbow and lifting his arm. Immediately, he frowned right at the blond.
As Deadpool was pulled up onto the roof, he gave Peter another big hug, smashing the hotdogs onto his back.
The scientist knelt down and picked the blanket up, putting it back around Clint's shoulders nonchalantly, and even patting his back.
“I don’t want to hear any debate about it. Until we can confront Loki and save those civilians, we have to keep our guard up.”
Across the fire, Peter caught another angry look being cast in Wade’s direction from Cap. The first avenger was setting up the grill like it was a guillotine.
"But you don't think I had anything to do with that...right?" Peter asked with a smile that was a little too wide. So Deadpool had taken Wolverine's motorcycle? Well, Logan's. Peter had never seen him ride it around in his yellow spandex uniform, to be honest.
"Hang in there pal, you're sounding a little faint," Tony said, trying to sound lighthearted and snarky as usual. It was difficult this time. Steve was in bad shape, and after all of the comments Clint—the shirtless one—had said earlier about Doctor Doom, all manner of god-awful things could have been going on while Tony was gone.
Tuning out Wade’s obnoxious voice and the weather, Clint frowned a bit as he listened to Peter talking.
"No, come in here. It's warm." Clint fell back down into the bed, mumbling from under the covers, "I won't bite."
Tony cleared his throat loudly and went right back to drinking the coffee once he wasn't coughing anymore.
"You're leaving?" The scientist looked after him worriedly. "Let us help you get back, at least—you're barely on your feet."
"I wish. I feel like I'm in a 50s horror movie...this place is in bad taste," the redhead commented tactfully. She then went back to coughing.
“How many colors do we have here?” Cap mumbled, kneeling to sort through the flags for a moment. “Looks like we have six colors to work with, Peter.” Standing up, he waved for Tony to follow him to the kayaks. “We’ll try to hurry. Everyone should eat lunch before we start the race,” he added in passing.
“I didn’t forget it—I LEFT it behind! We’re here for a WEEK and I’ll bet you that Bruce will spend every damn minute fishing!”
"Totally! That's all I want—just some hotdogs and a little R&R—then BAM! I'm outta here! Nope, no more New York for me—I'm off to...Detroit!" He grinned under his mask, nodding. "Yep!"
“Are you kidding?” Peter raised his eyebrows, pointing up at the sky. “Blame mother nature! We thought Thor was upset about something, but he says he didn’t do it.”
"I think you're safe," Clint assured her, rubbing his wrist absentmindedly—a look of horror intentionally on his face. It earned him a concerned look from Cap.
"Sure," Pepper replied, frowning. "Why ask, though, if you're going to ignore my advice? If you're worried about appearances, y-you've got to accept something about people right now...and that's that there's no pleasing everybody. Ever."
"It's not worth what happens if I mess up even once. After yesterday, I don't think it's possible anymore..." He sat down on the other end of the couch and put his head in his hands.
"Thor is a powerful man. Doom would only trade him for something that he finds very valuable. Like Reed Richards. Or maybe some device to help him take over the world."
Who the hell was Wentworth, Clint wondered tiredly, stepping to stand beside Peter and Matt. If they were gonna talk to Loki, he wanted to be ready to shoot him.
"Hey...hey, i-if I flatline," Tony mumbled, pausing to cough again. "Defib p-paddles...under the sink..."
The sun was just getting high enough to warm the long shadows across the beach and Cap had been sitting out there before those shadows had even appeared, grateful that the storm had whisked itself away overnight.
"…Is this weird?" He asked softly, leaning back from the scientist's hand and frowning. "I mean, this is okay, right? You don't think everybody's going to freak out, do you? Because of the Hulk?"
“Nonsense, we’d love to have you over,” Cap assured them, pulling Wade along lightly by his arm and finally smiling. “So, where do you operate? Queens?”
“Aw, c’mon,” Peter groaned, hopping to the ground and clicking on his belt light. The red spotlight shone over the smashed tent, tree branches having half-demolished the campfire ring as well. Judging by the huge footprints all over the place, either Bigfoot hated his love life as much as Cap and Tony did or the Hulk had been by.
The Jotun flinched like he’d been hit, immediately wiping off his face and raising a hand out above the water. His fingertips glowed with a magical green light.
“He came by to say good morning and ask if we could bring you this,” Cap explained, offering Peter a white T-shirt.
Across the fire, Tony got up silently and walked off down the beach the same way Peter had gone earlier. Maybe he wanted to use his phone, too.
"I do! I'm sorry!" Clint knelt down in front of him, sighing. "It was just a stupid impulse and now this is all awkward and weird." He shook his head.
Why? Why was he stuck on some stupid vacation, babysitting Spidey and his way-too-old-for-him boyfriend? WHY?
He glanced over at Clint, who had been laying on the table very quietly for some time now. The other Clint had been the one to decide he should be restrained; really, injured like he was, it wasn't like he was much of a threat.
"Yeeeaah...listen, Deadpool, Spider-Man's not down here," he said. "Last time I saw him, he was up near the front door. He and Johnny Storm showed up with...er, trouble."
“Yeah, I think we’ve got the jump on Loki!” Wade announced, hopping to his feet and holding the book up. “I took his spell book.”
"Yeah, hi... Nice Spidey shorts," he said meaningfully. Did this guy know Peter was Spider-Man? If he did, that said a whole lot about how much the kid trusted him.
"What?" Bruce stopped and followed his gaze, looking at the metal detector with a slightly raised brow. "Oh, wow. I haven't seen one of those in years."
Huffing a bit, Steve frowned and glared out the window at the beautiful semi-tropical landscape, complete with fluffy palm trees and white sandy beaches.
Loki flicked his finger, scrolling through the latest articles on his phone. It was such a hot miserable day that making mischief would have to wait until after he finished his iced coffee.
On instinct, Steve pulled Tony around behind him. Upon seeing the hand, he relaxed, though, smiling back at Tony.
"Pulse is elevated—that's normal for someone who's lost so much blood, though. We can't just leave him this way."
Slumping into his chosen seat, Peter looped an arm around the nearest support pole that hooked to the ceiling and leaned against it, thinking back on the news report by Jameson. It had said Captain America had abandoned his post. He knew Spider-Man wasn't to blame, but that didn't explain who was...
“If he knows Peter’s not here, maybe he already dropped him off back at camp,” he whispered. It seemed unlike Thor to just ignore his actual task of finding the teen and to go visit Loki instead.
"I'm s-sorry Bruce." Steve got up, leaning on Tony for support. "But first t-thing's first. If you..." He coughed into his hand before continuing. "...If you are g-going to make a c-cure -- we need...power...on." Wheezing, he shook his head.
“Hawkeye’s got broken ribs too?” Peter fell into step beside Cap, dismay probably obvious on his face. “Jeez, why is he out camping in the woods in that kind of shape? I’d wanna be home in bed if it was me.” He glanced at Clint and then back at Wade.
"Well, you are a little...thin," Clint said, looking Bruce up and down. He shuddered, his teeth chattering. "I guess I b-better go back to b-bed."
Tony raised an eyebrow, too, at Matt running over without his walking stick. Apparently, unlike Clint, he hadn’t bothered to look through the entire SHIELD database.
“Dating advice? I hope not,” Cap chuckled, already climbing to his feet. “I’m afraid I’m a bit rusty.”
"Ah. Wait. They're magnetic. I keep forgetting." Cap groaned, shaking his head. "Whatever was in that bomb is still in my system. It must be strong. We'll have to wait for an opportunity to escape."
"Too good," Loki mumbled, staring up at Thor. The dark sorcerer knew his carefully drawn eye makeup must be a horrible, smeared mess.
As soon as the alarm was off he noticed another sound. A creak on the roof. It was pouring rain outside, complete with grumbling thunder and brief flashes of lightning.
"I don't need a replacement," Tony said grumpily, sitting up with a wince. "Th-the reactor's levels...will even out." He leaned against Steve's shoulder, putting a hand on his chest. What had Steve been about to ask him, anyway?
“I was never good at romance, actually. I was small and I was sick in bed a lot. Women barely acknowledged my existence until I became like this.” Steve looked over his arms, blue eyes stormy. “…But I knew how shallow they were. I remembered the looks they gave me before. I couldn’t get that out of my head.”
"Cap's cure is still synthesizing in the lab," Bruce said apologetically. "I was hoping you would walk me back there to check on it. Tony can't keep this up forever. I'll be quiet, though, so you can think."
"Don't go, Wolvie. You can come too! Good dates always need a third wheel!" He called after, waving a hand at the quickly shrinking motorcycle in the distance.
"I’m so sorry. I forgot." He carefully started twisting the wires out again, focusing. This was the worst weekend he'd had in awhile—but at least no one had died.
Abandoning the blankets and scrambling to the opposite side of the bed that Bruce was on, Clint smoothed his hair and called nervously, "Yeah?"
"I actually left last night," he informed Johnny, shrugging. "My aunt will worry if I'm gone in the morning when I was supposed to be in my bed."
Had Tony died in his workshop? Maybe he’d starved to death, or slipped into a coma from lack of sleep. Hadn’t his arc reactor taken a hit a few fights ago? Whatever the case was, it was time for some kind of plan. Steve couldn't run off and leave the others—and he had doubts he could run at all with his lungs like this.
"No, that's the only good part—the sandwich shop survived." Clint shrugged a shoulder. "If that's what you meant." He looked up at Bruce. "I have no idea why I thought you were gay." He ran a hand through his wet hair awkwardly.
Steve almost fell over from the sudden change. His lungs still burned from whatever Doom had bombed him with. It had to be some kind of robotic something that stuck to his lungs—because normal gas didn't usually bother him. Maybe it was more of Tony's 'lost' tech.
Loki grimaced at the thought. While Thor coming home meant that he might be able to move his plan along, being locked in that cell again would make destroying Tony’s lab impossible.
Thor blinked at them, then broke into a big smile. Chuckling, he turned and hugged Lola—Loki—and planted a kiss on top of her head.
"Why are you s-so sure t-that he's evil?" Steve asked, stepping in after him. He waved a hand at Tony tiredly.
Bruce seated himself on the edge of the couch beside Loki, taking one of the gauze pads and placing it over the injury before carefully pressing it there with one palm.
Bruce placed the medical supplies on the table beside Loki, then headed back across the room and got a glass of water from the sink there. He returned, pulling out some gauze and medical tape, ointment of some kind, antiseptic...and a bottle of pills.
Instead of starting a rant or anything, the demigod slouched in his seat, propping his feet up on the empty chair next door. “…It'd be nice if our hearts listened to our heads sometimes.”
"Heeey!" Peter said brightly, sitting up and waving. "You've got a big green problem down there, I was just about to call you." He pointed down at the Hulk—as if that was necessary.
“I don’t think so,” Matt whispered back, shifting to face Peter. “Look, I was already halfway up the mountain when you called me. I couldn’t just turn back because of the Avengers. I mean, Peter, I had to meet them sooner or later.”
Phew, now that the lengthy authors' note is out of the way, let's get on to the chapter! As always, thank you for reading, commenting, and enjoying our story. ♥
“I’m sorry, when you two said ‘relaxing camping trip,’ I expected one of Tony’s resort-type places—not actual nature.”
"Unstrap me. This is boring," Clint stated dully, twisting his wrists in the straps. "It's making me think of Doom."
"I do not want him," Doom said flatly, clenching the offered hand into a fist. It sparked with blue electricity as he growled, "But an ally of mine does, and in return I shall be given what I desire..."
“I’m all for acceptance, but if they’re really together, I think we should have a talk with Peter without Deadpool there,” Tony said, frowning. “He’s a teenager. I don’t think it’s overreaching for us to be concerned about him dating a dangerous guy who’s way too old for high school.”
They all wore red… Yeah. That was the only thing Hawkeye could think of that the three guys had in common.
“Can you put me on your shoulder? We were swimming earlier, and there was a sunken ship. I’ll bet that’s where the sharks are.”
"C-come here, I'll...I can help with that." Frankly, he looked like he was afraid to move enough to stand and walk around.
The tequila was starting to hit him, a very familiar little fuzzy feeling at the edge of his mind. It was kind of a relief at the moment.
"Does anybody actually like that?" Peter wondered aloud, raising a brow. "Hey, the beach over that way is pretty peaceful. I was just over there sneaking in a phone call." He pointed back the way he had come from. "Quality sand to squish toes in, no frisbee-throwing blond Adonis types, and good cell reception I guess."
Grumbling, the blond archer shifted, yawning and stretching an arm out to dangle off the Hulk’s head. He took a moment to clumsily get his Avenger’s indenticard out and tap the glowing arrows.
Sitting up a little, Tony ran his fingers through his hair (which was a real mess at the moment) and sighed. What was Peter thinking, going off alone anywhere with Deadpool? The mercenary’s reputation for paid hits was only surpassed by how insane he supposedly was. Spider-Man, the friendly neighborhood hero who preached responsibility and self-awareness, was practically the polar opposite of him. The world at large didn’t know the worst part, that Peter was also a teenager who was still in high school.
Bruce stepped in front of the other two Clints—well, as best he could, since both of them were bigger than he was.
“Oh boy,” Daredevil sighed above them, hopping down to the ground. “Can I come in? Actually, can I GO in? You two seem like you…need to talk,” he added uncomfortably, glancing between them.
He grabbed the blond guy by the arm and easily slung him over his shoulder, taking off down the beach at a run. It was easy to forget Peter's strength, with how skinny he was.
Steve did not respond, shivering a bit. Was he cold? He rarely ever got cold. The redhead reached to feel his forehead, her hand warm against his skin.
The storm had gotten way worse. The magical residue had ended abruptly, leading to a dead end near the river. Whoever had left it had worked really hard to cover their tracks.
"You told me you know how to lure him here," Doom said, rather than answer his question. "Before I ask how, I will hear WHY you are betraying your comrade."
Scooping Peter up against him, Wade dipped him dramatically. Just as Peter was beginning to wonder if he’d get dropped, Wade leaned to kiss him.
"I shall assume he was returning and meet him halfway!" Thor was already heading for the door. He disappeared around the corner, and they could hear him calling loudly for Mjolnir.
“When you put it that way it sounds pretty gruesome,” Tony said, wrinkling his nose. “Bruce is smart—I’m betting he’d rather run to get his heart rate up and Hulk out than just let some bear maul him.” What a lovely conversation topic first thing in the morning… Tony didn’t particularly wish harm on Bruce, but the guy HAD been the one to decide to go camp out away from everybody in the middle of the forest alone. “Maybe we should pull rank on him and make him camp within sight of the tents.”
Tony blinked. He'd forgotten that fact—that Steve's serum always kept him in perfect health and youth. That he was, essentially, immortal. Still, the thought of Cap ever being with Loki of all people...
Bruce shook his hand, smiling uneasily. "Well I'm also not very smooth at bonfire beach parties, and I can't touch alcohol." He perked up, blinking as he realized aloud, "Hey, Cap doesn't drink, either. There's something to start talking to him about."
“How long have you and Steve Rogers been together? The Bugle would like me to think it’s been about five years, but I feel like that’s too long.”
Bruce wandered in through the door, glancing around. With his stubble and messy hair, the very casual hoodie and sneakers he wore with his jeans, and the slouchy elbows-to-your-sides posture, the scientist looked decidedly out of place in the photography-worthy perfection of the cabin.
“The weather doesn’t bother me. Besides, there’s not a lot of space under there. I don’t want to crowd you.”
A bit self conscious of how his bottom looked that close up, Loki sipped his coffee and scrolled through the article lazily. From her tone of voice, the author of the article seemed to favor the idea.
“’Bugs’ is hanging out with you. Sorry I adjusted my expectations,” Clint snapped back. “You corrupt this kid and the Avengers are gonna take you to the raft and throw away the key!”
"That guy doesn't just 'freak out'," Tony said, waving a hand for emphasis. "I mean, I even TAZED him once and got nothin'!"
“Better not let anyone see you with that,” he told Peter, making his way into the cave. It smelled like old plant matter and mud, but that sure beat the sewers in New York.
Bruce smiled wryly at him and reached up, pulling something out of Clint's hair. Was that...a hunk of seaweed? When...?
“Is it Matt? You guys are totes adorbs together—I’m not denying that—but come on, bugs! You and ME! We make a duo that’s so explosive, it makes C4 piss its pantsuit!” Grabbing Peter’s hand and pulling on it, Wade added brightly, “Besides, blonds have more fun!”
"Actually, I was thinking we'd try walking right through his front door," Tony said, crossing his arms and looking down at the castle.
His fiance didn’t seem chilled, but he was standing around in just his swim trunks. The Arc reactor made the raindrops near it glow blue. Tony turned and leaned into the hug, nodding to Thor.
The two others quickly resorted to childish pushing, which Loki lost, since he was apparently losing A LOT of blood. As Hawkeye gave him a good shove, Loki disappointed himself when he tipped over quite easily, right on top of Bruce.
"The formula I made is as close to the sample you gave me as I can make," Bruce replied dully, rubbing at one of his eyes. He sighed. "It doesn't seem to be working, either."
"And yet I see none of the others rushing in to aid you," Doom said drolly, turning back toward him again.
"Actually, I had no intention of coming here. I simply 'went with the flow' as the mortals say. Why have you captured Captain America and the supposed Hawkeye? If you wanted to catch Thor, would it have not made more sense to capture Jane Foster…or me?" Loki circled around Doom slowly, brushing a finger along the tops of some vials in a rack on the table.
“Yes please! I need you to help with the sauce,” Cap called casually, ducking around Peter and Wade like it was something he did every day.
“I…don’t think I should talk about it. I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.” As Steve added the last, his eyes drifted back to Tony, who was now alone on the other side of the fire.
"Yeah, thank you. I'm trying to stay out of the cabin," he sighed. "Hulk says hi, by the way. If we want to keep a low profile, we're going to have to stay me all week." Clint couldn't tell if he was happy about that or not, but he could bet that the Hulk wasn't.
"I agree with my clone," the other Clint said. "Why are we locked in here? Between Thor and Hulk, what in the world do you think we're going to do?"
Clint raced through the crowd. There were people gathered around a big office building across the street from Stark Tower and boy oh boy, was the office building on fire. Clint had seen Captain America ducking back inside after dropping a woman off just outside of the door.
"Y-you're gonna give me whiplash," Spider-Man whined, glancing nervously at the claws on either side of him. They very narrowly missed jabbing his shoulders. "If you stab me, you're gonna feel really bad, 'cause I'm one of the good guys."
“Of course we trust you, Peter,” Cap told the kid sincerely, uncrossing his arms and looking to Tony for some kind of cue, blue eyes stormy. “I think I’m beginning to understand why you were hesitant to tell us about Wade. I had been thinking you and him were a duo…not a trio. Is that why you two aren’t an item?” Cap nodded his head in Daredevil’s direction subtly.
So he suddenly found Clint interesting. He'd faced worse, right? He'd just have to come up with a reasonable plan to deal with it and follow that plan, like he dealt with every other problem.
“What?” Cap all but snapped at him, turning to frown at him. “We need to get back down to the fire.”
“You know, maybe we should wait,” Tony said hastily, placing a hand on Steve’s shoulder. He turned to Bruce and added apologetically, “This was supposed to be a really low-key, calm, PEACEFUL kind of trip. We didn’t think there’d be anything around here worth Hulking out over. If you didn’t lose your temper, could you at least help us understand what actually happened?” That was remarkably diplomatic, coming from Tony. Clint wouldn’t have thought he had it in him.
“Oh,” the man said, puffing his chest and crossing his arms, too. When he answered, his voice was pitched a lot lower. “I’m his old pal. Wade’s the name, killing’s the game—only not really, cause Spi-PETER said that’s bad! Which it totally is. Not denying that, just want to get my two cents in there that some people are serious assholes and MAYBE deserve to have their hoohahs chopped off.”
Wade quickly followed him, dragging Matt after him. The redhead hadn’t managed to grab his sandwich.
“Why don’t you even want to think about that? Is the thought of an ‘us’ so horrible? If it is, just—just tell me already, so I can stop…” Stop what? Stop being in love with Steve? Well that was never gonna happen. If Steve ruled this out once and for all, though, Tony would have something to tell himself to stop himself hoping for anything more.
The blond didn't follow him. Instead he stood by the door shivering. After a moment, he tucked his hands into his vest pockets and sighed, puffing a cloud into the chilly air. Bruce could see the reflection of those blue eyes in the shop’s window and they were looking at HIM.
“Oh, great,” Tony sighed, raking his fingers through his hair. Deep down he’d already known the crashing in the trees last night was Hulk-related, but right on their campsite? Jerk move, Hulk. “We’ll be out in a minute.”
"Um, are you sure you're calm?" Hawkeye asked, stepping back to glare at his lookalike. "That guy is the fake and I think I can prove it."
“Do you think Hulk really destroyed their camp, Tony?” Steve asked as soon as Peter and Matt disappeared up the trail to their old camp.
“I’m surprised you’ll even say ‘us’.” Tony got to his feet, too. Steve could feel the intent gaze fixed on him even when he was looking at the ocean. The wind howled furiously. The fog made the waves look like they went out into eternity. “I have no expectations here. I don’t expect you to say anything, or do anything, and so far I’m dead right,” Tony said bitterly. “But I can’t just pretend this isn’t happening to us—me. To me.”
"One of the many works of Doom," the masked man replied almost proudly. "If you cooperate, I will reverse it when Thor is mine."
Slipping his mask off with one hand, Matt flashed Peter a very handsome smile. Daredevil did indeed have red hair, as well as pale blue eyes. Before Tony could make out any more detail, Matt was walking into the cabin with the others.
He could make out the shine of Clint's eyes in the dimness—and they were still fixed on him. Another grumble of thunder rumbled.
Tony, meanwhile, rummaged for forks in the silverware drawer a little overly loudly, plastering on the most neutral face possible. Well, ouch. Ouch, ouch, ouch. If Steve thought that talk only hurt TONY'S feelings, maybe Steve didn't have any feelings involved here to hurt. It made too much sense--explained why Steve was apologizing instead of trying to continue where their talk had left off.
“We’ve managed to tell exactly one person about us,” Tony continued, tossing his hands up in the air. “Meanwhile the Hulk’s knocking trees down, Thor’s playing double agent, Hawkeye’s about to pass out from blood loss, and then there’s PETER over there with way more game than I ever had at his age! So much for a vacation, huh? Loki’s just the smug horny cherry on top.”
"You're welcome, sir," the AI replied drolly. They could all hear it because it spoke through Tony's helmet.
Tony dug in the medical bag for a minute and then pulled out a syringe with the largest needle they had seen in awhile.
“He means we’re TOGETHER together,” Tony clarified, placing a hand over Steve’s on his shoulder. “Planning our wedding, that kind of together.”
“Careful, now, you’ll cut our weekend short,” he teased. Blowing their cover probably wouldn’t make him pack up and head home, but it sure would cut to the chase about whether anybody was going to flip out and turn green over their relationship.
"Okay, Clint, I'm not sure why you're really apologizing to him, but I'm pretty sure it's not why he thinks." He turned around, reaching for his T-shirt again with a smile lingering on his face. Bruce didn't smile a whole lot, and it was kind of nice. Except for the part where Hulk thought that apology meant something weird, and Bruce totally overlooked how brown hair and brown eyes looked like HIM.
Bruce leaned back in his seat, checking that the gauze he held was still covering the arrow wound since he was now holding around Loki's waist.
"Hey Spider-Man, this is Carol. We're currently under lock down due to…” She trailed off. “What do you need?"
“Um, I think so,” Cap said, clearing his throat and again looking at Tony for a signal. “There’s enough spaghetti?”
When Tony and Wade had returned to the campfire, Peter had apparently left to talk frisbee with people; Cap had been there by himself, making hamburgers and looking more mopey than ever. Tony had decided it would be better not to try and talk things out, considering how 'well' that had gone the last few times they'd talked alone. Clearly, if Steve had any interest in him, he was in denial. Tony still couldn't figure out why he'd asked to fake being a couple and then gone out of his way to tell Peter they 'certainly weren't' together. That was just hurtful, jeez.
“No, no, he’ll be fine!” Peter told them, dashing out alongside Cap. He patted Wade’s shoulder, explaining, “He’s got a healing factor. Take the arrow out and he’ll heal right up.”
The picture had been clearly doctored. He would have remembered smooching Tony in the middle of a flower-covered archway. It was amazing how little value pictures had in modern time. Anything could be faked.
"C'mon, you know the kid better than that. There isn’t an evil bone in his body," he pointed out, "and he doesn't stand there and let other people be evil without stopping them, either. Are we talking 'code names' secretive or 'even I don't know who he really is' secretive?" He stopped short, eyes widening. "What if he's with a SHIELD agent!"
"I...do not know anymore," Thor admitted, looking guilty to be saying so. He looked down at the floor. "Jane Foster has not spoken to me in a very long time. While I still hold great regard for her, I cannot truly say that we are lovers—not when we have been apart so long with nothing to prevent either from contacting the other."
"Uh...yeah. I-I only tried the drink kind because Doom did. This's more effective. Need...titanium needle, though. I might sit on the floor soon," Bruce warned Clint tiredly.
"Say cheese!" He, Tony and Steve all smiled for the picture, posed around their rather Stark-looking sandcastle as the camera clicked.
Smooth subject change, Pete, he thought sarcastically. It wasn't like he'd TIMED the stomach growling, though...
"Hawkeye," Tony said drolly, still typing. "Speaking of, there's more than one Hawkeye at the moment—clone or Skrull or something. Bruce's keeping an eye on them." He paused, smiling in bemusement. "Oh, that's probably why he never showed up when I called for him."
Well, Steve could have done without that last one. Time had changed what words were spoken casually in public.
A few deep breaths later, he had managed to focus on Clint's eyes, but his own were still very green.
The stairwell was like a big cave—echoing far off thunder and pounding rain on the roof. It was almost surreal.
It was clear that he couldn't outrun the beast, so Loki stopped and turned around. The Hulk and the archer were said to be friends, so it was time to test that theory. Having completely reopened his wound, he pressed a firm hand over his side to stop the blood from dripping on the floor.
“Dibs on the room with the biggest bed!” Clint told Tony, brushing past him and heading down the small hallway in the middle of the back wall.
“Okay, you managed to dodge my question twice. Look, I don’t mind if you are. Just putting that out there.”
The laughing from the frisbee game had eventually stopped, and the bonfire was no longer crackling. It was just him and the waves rolling in. Sounded like the stars were making the wave noises. Starwaves. Spacewaves. Nice.
"Then let me HELP and you'll feel better," the Hulk said stubbornly, scowling down at him. "Can't turn back into Banner right now—I'm all you get, Cupid."
"Yeah, you guys don't have to be in a cell anymore. Bruce is in the medical room, hopefully curing Cap since YOU weren't any help with that..."
"Ah! Put me down!" The demigod struggled briefly, giving up at the sudden stabbing pain in his side. He sighed. "I need to sleep this off."
"Tell him I'm blowing up his house." Without further comment, he got up and sauntered off down the train.
“Loki!” Thor’s voice boomed loud enough through the sky that there was no way Steve and Tony couldn’t hear it. The big blond came flying in and landed beside the campfire, whipping the flames up in the wind. “And Peter, I am glad to see you have returned!”
"Okay, what the hell is going on around here? Why's this freak here?" The newest Hawkeye asked, gesturing to Deadpool. "What happened to the power?" He glanced around the room as they walked, noticing the blood on the couch with a raised eyebrow.
