“Those are all for you,” Tony chimed in before the server could explain. He pointed at the largest fork. “This one right here is your dinner fork. It’s for your meats and whatnot. That smaller one is your dessert fork. The larger knife is for steak, and the one on the small plate is for butter. And regarding spoons, this one is for soups--” Tony leaned over and pointed at it. “--and the other one is for tea.”
“Two sarsaparillas,” Steve answered immediately. The server nodded and walked away.
“Let’s keep it that way,” Steve said, clapping a hand on Tony’s shoulder as he walked past him. “And let’s hope that you actually remember what you agreed to come sundown I'll see you then.”
“Gah!” Wrecker cried and fell to the ground, his gun skidding across the wooden floor. “Piledriver, this is all your fault! You went and led us right to the damn town Sheriff!”
Steve stared at his own glass, drumming his fingers against the side of it. “You sure do know an awful lot about silverware,” He said, breaking the brief and slightly uncomfortable silence. “And with your fancy dress, makes me think that dinin’ like this is relatively common for you.”
Tony is sitting at his desk, nothing out of the ordinary, except for the fact that he doesn’t look stressed. He’s not talking on his phone, nor is it ringing incessantly. He’s writing something slowly and delicately, a stark contrast from the rapid, scribbly way he usually writes for work-related papers.
“No,” Steve responded immediately, and Tony huffed in disappointment. “But maybe there’s something else I can do for ya that’s just as good? Somethin' long overdue?”
Yes, yes, just like that! Strong, but with that subtle gentleness to it. Absolute perfection, much like the man himself.
the flask behind?”
Tony rolls his eyes affectionately and shakes his head. “No, no, once again your sweet-talking prevailed. I’m still putting a bandage on that thing. A big one.”
Once outside, Tony didn’t think twice about rushing into Steve’s arms, embracing him tightly.
“I just don’t want you tempted,” Steve mumbled, leaning back and folding his arms. “Temptation is a nasty thing for a feller who’s an addict.”
“I’m your only patient.”
“You seriously expect me to believe that you got in there by pure accident?”
Steve looks over his shoulder at Tony, cocking an expectant brow.
Tony just wished that it could’ve been literally
“Yes, the most special!” At least, Steve’s assuming it is.
“No such thing as a strange question, sir,” Jarvis says. "But yes, of course you may.”"
“Alright now, we’re gonna make this nice and easy for all of--” The tall one in a purple mask began before pausing, his eyes scanning the near empty restaurant. “--seriously?
The two lackeys nodded, moving toward Tony and keeping their guns raised. “Cough up the loot, money bags, whatever you got.”
Steve sighed, shaking his head and reaching for the key ring hanging off his belt. “What are the odds of that?”
“Right this way, gentlemen, only the finest table for our own Sheriff and our own…uh, Mr. Stark,” The server said, leading them to a candle-lit table in the back corner, nice and cozy and private. Not that privacy was hard to come by in this place.
“I did!”
“Don’t have to tell me twice.” Steve took a gentle hold of Tony’s chin and tilted his head upward. He leaned in, colliding their lips together in a soft, sweet kiss, which Tony gleefully returned.
He didn’t think anything could spoil this evening.
He went home with the intention of going right to sleep, but instead, he spent the better portion of the night tossing and turning in bed.
“Well, it'd been well over a day since I saw you and, uh, that’s just far too long if you ask me,” Tony rambled quickly, hoping that maybe Steve won’t be able to hear him and his shame if he talked fast. “You always come when I get myself in trouble, so I went ahead and found some. And well, you did.”
“I’m fine, really,” Steve insists. “I didn’t think it was that big of a deal because it’s not hurting me.”
other night.
“Hey, I’m just glad I won’t have to eat a whole cake by myself. My tailor will be glad, too.” Tony chuckles before he smiles brightly. “Happy March 10th, Steve.”
Heaving out a sigh, Steve slumps his shoulders and lowers his head in shame. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
“Tony, get under the table, now!” Steve ordered, and Tony didn't have to be told twice. He jumped out of his seat and under the table, catching the attention of the smaller of the two lackeys. The man smirked, cocking his gun and pointing it right at Tony.
“I think you must be mistaken.” Steve clenched his fist and swiftly punched Bulldozer, knocking him to the ground beside Thunderball. “Because I am
to try.
Had Tony not just downed an entire flask of whiskey, he might’ve been able to calculate the exact odds. Not that there wasn’t much to find out in the first place. He knew exactly how he’d gotten himself into this pickle, and for once, it wasn’t the fault of his desire for a drink.
Tony makes a small noise into Steve’s back that sounds like a laugh, and he burrows his face in further into Steve’s cotton t-shirt. “Still mad at you.”
He very well could have swung by the Sheriff’s office for a visit, asked him about how his investigating of the not so mysterious lynchings was going, maybe even made some polite conversation while he stared into those pretty blue eyes.
than enough to drink today,” Steve tsked, his brows furrowing together. “If you really wanna pay me a proper thanks, you’ll stay out of trouble and get a proper meal in you. Lord knows you don’t eat enough for how much you drink.”
Exiting Peter's room, Steve headed next for the kitchen. If he couldn't help Tony with whatever he was doing in the lab, then at least he could make sure he had some decent fuel besides coffee. Tony drank enough coffee for three people on a normal day, and it got even worse when he was pulling his all-nighters. And as much as Tony liked to dismiss all of the issues that he'd had with his heart and his health in general, Steve still believed that he couldn't be too careful.
Peter wasn't about to tell Dad about it, though. There was already enough bad blood between the two of them.
There was a brief gust of air, and the image surrounding Steve suddenly changed to what looked like some kind of battlefield. Burning fires interspersed with piles of rubble and twisted metal surrounded him, and he whipped around, his breath catching as he caught sight of Peter cradled in Bucky's arms, his limp body covered in burns and black soot.
"You're not Grandpa, Dad," Peter said gently. "And you're not gonna fuck anything up, so—"
Unless Peter was just completely misreading her signals, which he admitted was still a possibility, it definitely seemed like Gwen like-liked him.
"I'm just as real as you are, sweetheart," Steve answered. He kissed back up to Tony's mouth, his tongue splitting Tony's lips.
Finally, after the ophthalmologist announced that Steve's damaged eyes would require him being grounded for three days and his hands and feet were smeared with some kind of stinky burn cream that stung like hell and wrapped in thick bandages, he was discharged out to the waiting room, where he and Tony found Sam Wilson pacing back and forth.
"Oh, yeah? Only when you're not being weird!" Peter shot back.
“Huh?” Tony said, catching a drop of orange juice before it could trail down his chin.  “What makes you say that?”
“Johann Schmidt!” the announcer’s voice booms over the speakers, followed immediately by an eruption of cheers from the stands.  Against his better judgement, Steve glances over to his right as the tall, handsome German swimmer with the wide, cocky smile raises his hands to his mouth and blows a kiss towards the section of the crowd waving German flags and carrying signs embossed with his name.  The defending champion in the 100 free, Schmidt placed first in both his qualifying heat and his semi-final race, where he also broke the Olympic record, landing him comfortably in lane four as the odds-on favourite to win the gold.
"And you?" Steve asked in a small voice. He curled his arms around Tony's waist and pulled him close, and Tony practically melted against him. Maybe that meeting with Beck had been more stressful that he'd originally thought. "You've been running yourself ragged trying to take care of us, sweetheart, especially lately, so I'm not gonna let you forget about you."
And since Papa was about to relive some of the worst memories of his entire life, both Peter and Dad wanted him to be comfortable.
"Yeah," Steve whispered into Tony's hair. He squeezed his eyes closed, holding his husband as tightly as he dared. "I love you so much, sweetheart."
Gritting his teeth, Peter had just managed to get the hole big enough to shove Chief Stacy through when a bolt of lightning appeared, striking the fire demon directly on the top of its head. The monster immediately roared again, looking up towards what remained of the ceiling as Thor suddenly dropped out of the sky and disappeared inside it.
"On your left!" Steve snapped as he passed a group of cadets out for their morning jog, led by their squadron commander. Sam, his usual running buddy, had bugged out on him three laps ago after Steve refused to slow down to a more human-friendly pace. After getting a less-than-helpful response to his inquiry as to what was wrong, Sam had informed Steve that he didn't particularly feel like barfing up his lungs that morning and would see him at their pre-flight briefing.
"I hope so," Steve murmured. "I just hope that we're not gonna get to that point and then have someone try and tell us that he's beyond hope or something."
"Come on, bullshit!" Cap almost looked as if he was about to throw up just by envisioning himself with Tony, and Tony understood the sentiment perfectly.
But the driver only asked Steve.
"I'm unfit to be a parent," he told her the truth. "And I'm fighting a very bad man, so I'm quite busy."
Barnes didn't stab him again, but the punch Loki got wasn't pleasant, even though if it only made him laugh because Bucky's anger only meant he was on the right track to figuring Barnes out.
He went back to SHIELD requesting the gender change, and since he was Captain America, he got it. Then made a deal to bond with Wanda - not unlike the deal Tony had with May - so she wouldn't be deported.
Tony shoved him away pretty hard at first, but when Steve thought it was because they were done, Tony's suit opened up and he stepped out of it, pulling Steve back close, getting rid of Steve's belt with one move, working on his pants next.
Nevertheless, Quill had always liked music, and dancing was something they could do together for free with his mom every single night - before her illness got worse, so...
"Oh no, if you had been in my life for the last 6 years, I'd remember."
"For the record, I didn't mean all that," Bruce warned right away. "But it had to be something that's-"
Then, they fought and lost together, but also, what neither of them expected: they both survived the Snap, and after all the devastation it brought, it only made Loki consider how he shouldn't mess up something so important.
If a little bit of "Tony Stark has entered the room, so you better pay attention" drama was necessary for Bucky to have a friend other than Steve, and hopefully with time also become more trusting with the others, then be it.
"And by right you mean..."
"I believe I just indicated that from now on we were," Rhodey told him.
He was reacting to Tony’s scent. Even though he was fully aware that nothing would happen, he felt like he melting into Tony’s arms. A very bad idea for an Omega with his size on any day, but especially when he was holding Tony up, so he had to quickly pull back.
"Are you my mother?" the tiny child only looked at him with some wonder.
"Why would that make her feel better?" Coulson asks before he can rethink the possibilities.
However, what was he supposed to do if in all the possible futures (14,000,604) he saw Thanos won?
"Also, you should call them something cooler. If you were serious about the no grandma jokes, then..."
"I can," Fury grins. "And I usually do. If someone sucks, I yell at them right away, all you have to do is to report everything I say, just maybe  with less swearing."
If anything, Loki wondered if maybe he was just holding Tony back from brilliance then. Until...
"Let me guess. I either do as you say, or you'd hand me over to your friends who all want a piece of me," Loki rolled his eyes.
"Alternatively, I could direct you towards a form of communication that could be the fastest resolution of your problems, boss."
"You know, if you truly wanted to be helpful, you could just open the door," Tony told Friday. "Or shut up."
“If Thor is Tiny, Hulk sleep with Thor,” he said, taking up most of the space in Thor’s bed.
"It's already 3, and I'm going there anyway," Bucky said and came back indeed with two large portions of food.
"Why? I did all you wanted from me. I helped Thor and his friends. The pathetic little planet!" Loki hoped he yelled at Odin with fury, but in truth, he felt frail. "Why punish me like this now, when I'm already in pain... Unless you wanted me to suffer all along."
"You know how close they are..."
"Exactly," Loki hoped at least Tony getting this now would mean that Tony will stay away from him. When he could without killing Loki, that is.
"It's not. Up until to a certain point," Coulson tries to not sound insulting while telling him the facts so Rogers would get it. "Moms and daughters can bond over fangirling you, and if you'd consider trying out to be a pro, one day there would be no brand which wouldn't like to advertise with you. Even the family brands, because you're a safe bet."
Maybe Tony hated him for omitting something so huge, and how Steve was just an Omega, but he didn't seem to be able to shake the pull Steve had on him, so Steve used that.
"No more reality TV or talk-shows for you,
"I'm NOT!
He told Fury as much: his stay in the Avengers Tower was only temporary, watching Steve's back making sure he didn't do anything stupid just because of his grief, but otherwise, he was done.
Steve, on the other hand, hadn't said a word about what happened. It only proved how he didn't treat Bucky like he was his property, which was very nice of him. What else could a retired assassin ask for?
"I still won't let you fuck me."
"I don't know what you're on about, but I-" Bucky was a good enough liar, but he still lingered, which once again, just proved Loki's theory about him right.
Tony was right, and it took more time to take off Bucky's arm properly, attach the new (every part had to be in place with a precision that wouldn't let water in), and then fine-tune every gesture. They were merely half-way through, maybe, when Barnes asked for the time, and it was already 5 am.
Hearing that Steve couldn't really eat a bite, no matter how hungry he was before, and Tony must have noticed too because he stopped Steve before they parted ways.
"Trust me, he does."
Tony just started laughing.
And they were about to take off to get some food, when there was a sudden screeching noise that stopped them both in their tracks, while Jade and Wong appeared, running.
"If that's true, I hate you a little bit less," it was the closest Tony would get to a thank you, given everything.
"No, Hulk happy here. Hulk wants Tiny back! If Thor is Tiny, turn back!"
"Is it on Steve's list? I promised not to watch anything from it before he could," Bucky didn't even flinch when Dum-E almost broke his arm instead of taking it off, and Tony jumped to remedy that problem.
"You did."
"Yeah?"
"I'd rather not talk about it, he clearly made his choice, which has nothing to do with us," Bucky sighed, but just when Steve could tell him that wasn't how things were last time he checked, Tony appeared as well.
"Well, you'd be fired anyway!" Tony only gestured at them. "Both."
"What did you want?"
"Why, how long was I the Hulk?!"
Well, Loki had a good enough guess already, so he blasted Bucky out of his tent with quite a bit of magic. Only to find himself lingering in front of Bucky's tent in the middle of the night next.
situation, Strange realized when he managed to get out of under all the rubble and get to Stark, who was... having a panic attack.
"So who do you find attractive then?" Bruce gave him a wondering look.
And even if Loki and the Chitauri succeeded in conquering Midgard, what was the point?
"I'd love that, I'm ravenous."
"I am calmer than I have been for years," Pepper stated. "Why not let him speak? He's only this honest when he's drunk, and every time he acts as if he is the victim, I am only more convinced that I've made the right decision breaking up with him."
"Then let me correct the question: if you could only do one thing? Surely not lunch?"
By Pepper who sent people home first, and when Tony wanted to object, by Rhodey, who slapped Tony when he was about to object.
"Who is Mikey?"
The next time he woke, he was petted by Hulk who bought him another bowl - which Thor devoured this time without a complaint.
And he left the phone on an empty chair next to Quill, who first just wanted to leave it also, but he was too tempted. Just taking it home for one day before giving it back to Rocket the same would mean Quill could not only listen to music but maybe also watch a couple of music videos where people danced to the music.
And, Pepper was already calling him about some emergency.
“I find your speculations rude, and that’s all they are. Speculations. The scars on my body came from me being clumsy, the clothes simply were never my style despite what the etiquette dictates, and I don’t have pups because my health isn’t so good. I’m too small to have them, probably.”
"That's why you let me leave yesterday," Tony realized with some mild irritation. "You knew I'd be back anyway."
“Funny, because I’ve always wanted to share a Heat with an Alpha, but never got a chance,” it was the Heat talking. It was inhuman for an Omega not to take suppressants but not have an Alpha either then, and therefore, also punishable by the law. In theory.
"It wasn't a bad idea, after all, was it?" Steve wondered, a bit sad that it was over now that he was leaving.
And that's when it hit Loki. Steve Rogers was often put down as the boring type, and Loki himself thought that was it, but clearly, it couldn't be further from the truth.
“Any type of combat you think could be useful.”
"It's Dave, actually," Dave corrected, and left with an apologetic smile, while Bucky was tempted to smile back. He washed his hands and would have left himself, if Steve didn't stand in his way, blocking the door with his frame.
"It's part of a bigger plan," Strange tried to sound confident. So far, he had no idea how two incapacitated superheroes were better than their original future, but he had to trust the spell. "Stark, we probably should-"
"It's going to be only too funny and you know it."
"You're truly unhinged. And disgusting," the Captain told him.
"So, Doc, for every favor you do for me, I do one for you."
"I could visit you in college," Quill argued.
"Jesus, we don't eat them. They are companions."
"What were you talking about?"
"Very Alpha-like."
And Rhodey had seen Tony's records, and only knew him too well, so he must have assumed Tony had looked up his mark - which he did, even if the wrong one - and when he didn't even mention it, Rhodey must have thought it was because he wanted to ignore their connection.
"I could," Tony smiled, strangely feeling shy about the suit when he'd like to gloat about everything else.
It was a constant battle you could only lose if you let go, and Steve tried to be a connection to this time for Bucky as Sam was to him by pushing for Buck to join the Avengers, but his best friend was still just one step away from a recluse.
"I literary just... forget it. I'm going to grab lunch. Do you also need some food?"
"What else could I be after?"
"I didn't have time to rationalize anything! I had to act as I thought was for the best," Cap could probably sense he made a mistake because his expression tensed up some more.
They were having a stare-down once again, but this time it was Bucky who talked first.
"We've all said things we regret," Steve realized he should send a message why he didn't show up for work. "I'm not sure it was wise for you to let him go though. He might just never come back, and you seem to have him right where you wanted."
"You must be kidding me," Tony couldn't quite believe it. "First you kidnap us claiming it's for on our good, then you're telling me I'm a liar? I'm not in the habit of apologizing, but I meant it too!"
"Alright, but I'm getting you a bed then too, and I'm going to monitor you. If you aren't healing while donating the blood, I'll shut it down. Tony wouldn't want for you to die as well."
He began chest compressions and used Mjolnir as a defibrillator. But all his limbs were shaking, so Strange took pity on him, taking over the compressions while Steve only held the hammer that much tighter.
"And here I thought the torment of one simple pathetic mortal was a sorry excuse for the God of Mischief to even pay any mind to."
And Rocket and Groot also showed up.
"He's talking about taking us on a date," Steve tried to explain.
"I won't kill you, but I might just want a brief glimpse at your mind first, Sergeant. This won't hurt a bit," he promised to the mortal, but Barnes fought him off.
"I so knew you did," Loki huffed.
“I’ll pay them off if I have to.”
It could be only Tony who didn't notice his feelings before because he was so preoccupied with the false fact that feelings, emotions, and sentimentality weren't for Stark men.
"Every day? I have to come here every day?" Tony echoed. "For how long?"
"Yes, I mean it's horrible," Nat agreed. "But you and I, we're luckier than the others."
"Friday?" Bucky only looked in the direction of the speakers.
"The doctors didn't tell me you had memory loss as well," Tony could only tell him in a similar fashion.
Bucky only laughed.
"I can't do something else?"
"Why would I do that?"
"Well, she doesn't eat anything I give her, so if it's anyone's fault, it's hers."
"I don't care. I've had enough of his bullshit, and it's not like I'll ever have a chance to hit him again..."
“So, tell me how Obadiah is. How he treats you. Did he ever do anything you didn’t like? I was told he has an official bondmate, but you’re still listed as a first replacement.”
"I guess, with you, I like to be one."
"I wanted to summon it before, and couldn't. You, on the other hand, Captain, are like a twig, and still mightier than me."
Jarvis had tried his best to prepare Tony for what was coming, but he also wanted Tony to have some resemblance of childhood. He was the only one who said goodbye to him when Tony was sent over to Obadiah, scared, but still unaware of what was coming.
"Weirder than finding me in your bed?"
Except, they barely arrived in 2012, and Tony was reporting in the status of 2012 Steve’s ass over the comms, on purpose, even provoking Scott to comment on it too.
So when Stark only meant to incapacitate him, Barnes caught on fire. Loki used magic to put it out, but probably all it did was that he elongated the pain Bucky was in.
And when Steve tried to tell Thor how it wasn't so, Thor didn't listen, just insisted on how they should return.
"No," Bucky seemed defiant.
"Well, not anymore," Rocket just shook his head. "And just FYI, I'm dating Groot, and I don't appreciate any jokes about it."
Thor then asking him when they just barely landed.
"You're right. It's a distraction I didn't know I needed," Phil can't believe he's doing this, but he wanted something new for the newspaper (and himself), and this could be it.
"It's a girl."
"And even if you could give me a reason why I should trust you, I couldn't believe a word."
"Right?" Steve seemed to be proud of himself, and gods, Loki couldn't even imagine leaving him these days. Especially when Steve was looking at him like this, even though if technically Loki never promised to stay again after he broke that promise in the hospital room.
"If you have any request, I'd be happy to apply them," Tony offered, but it was also a trap. "After Pepper reviewed and approved them, she's the CEO, after all..."
"I didn't know!" Tony waved the sealed document, trying to get the information across. "My mark was different when I was a kid, and by the time I heard it changed, it was after my surgery, and I gave up finding my match by then."
"Not that one, silly," Jade just laughed. "The attractive one."
He couldn't even stand still, walking circles, despite being aware of how ridiculous he must have looked. Whenever he felt like this, he'd have his hands in the pocket, walk ever so leisurely, put an unamused face - if not attitude - on, gesticulate widely, and make rude remarks.
"Yeah, that could happen."
It was the first time that Thor not only acknowledged Loki's competency, but correctly guess his hidden motives, and if Loki wasn't there to witness it, he wouldn't have believed it, so Loki stopped scratching Steve's hand trying to get him to leave.
During this time, Tony had to undergo surgery, getting a pacemaker, and was examined again, and he realized his mark has changed based on the very discrete reports he got about it.
"If they train excessively, as it has been known to happen, Friday is supposed to lock them in, so nobody else gets hurt, and the damage is contained to their vicinity, not the whole Tower," Bucky explained, looking at Tony, who swiftly ignored them both, conjoined with the device in his hands.
"I guess I... can't tell how much of what I feel here is really me, and not just my instinct, and I..."
"Well, you should have let me suck your dick at least, that way you wouldn't be preoccupied with what leaves my mouth," Loki told him, and still noted with some kind of satisfaction that Steve did blush hearing that. "But it's too late now, I'm leaving. As you've said, nobody here knows who I am, and-"
"Um, so," Coulson reverts to examining the charts and graphs he printed out for Rogers, but they are little help when he can't concentrate on them. "You're popular online. There isn't much to discuss, you're doing a good job at it."
"The talk about bees and the-?"
"Now, but when I grew up, it was still... never mind," Steve considered, and judged it didn't matter still, but then Thor stopped him.
"Exactly, and you did both," Thor patted him on the shoulders with what could have been intended a friendly gesture, but when Steve only winced, he stopped abruptly. "Apologies, I didn't mean to hurt you."
Tony did, and he started talking about girl names then, so immersed in the topic that he didn’t notice when he lost Steve, who was secretly not listening, but just enjoying seeing Tony talk this animatedly about something - anything.
And the more he was annoyed by Tony's antics when he would have done the same thing in the same situation, the more compassion he felt for the Ancient One when she had to deal with him and his questions.
. All of us, Stevie, or isn't that what you said you wanted?"
"It's not my intention to kill you," Barnes told him calmly. "If it was, you'd be dead already."
"No, I meant... what are you up to?"
"You must. You have all the power of the greatest magician of the entire planet at your disposal to do it. Or is it that you can't do what us, a couple of wizards can?" Stephen tried a different approach that would have worked on him, only hoping it would have the same effect on Stark as well.
But Rogers has a patience of a saint when it came to online trolls, and Coulson expects he'll navigate this challenge just fine, incapable of being a real asshole anyway.
"You're quite horrible at apologies."
"I mean... yes?" Thor grinned. "I won't deny it if people ask, and everybody already could guess anyway..."
"Yeah… okay… okay…" Tony pressed his palm to his chest, sucking in a deep breath. His heart was racing so fast that he felt dizzy, and he still wasn't quite convinced that he wasn't dreaming.
"Oh, I know that," Steve said as he pinched the bridge of his nose. "And I wouldn't expect anything less from him. I just—Nat, he shouldn't have to be! This was supposed to be a fun weekend for him, getting to spend some time with his lady friend, and now—"
“Mmm.  A guy, huh?” Dad asked as he pulled into the Tower garage.  “I figured it’d be some old granny-type lady who’d be the owner of something like that.”
"And she met Peter," Steve finished.
If anyone would've told Tony six months ago that he'd be happily trading verbal jabs with not one but two hotshot Air Corps pilots, Tony would've laughed in their face. Loudly.
"Yeah, yeah, whatever," Tony muttered as he got to his feet, heading for the bathroom. "Can't help it if I like your clothes better than mine."
Whatever it took.
"That was kinda the point of it, Dad," he said quietly. "But anyway, I'm fine. Papa's the one who's hurt."
Ned shot Peter one of his
The man his son called 'uncle', was
Pursing his lips, Tony refilled his coffee cup and headed back to the lab, pulling up the MAUDE schematic.
"It's not up to you to understand, Captain, just to answer the questions," Davis snapped. "Now then, in the interests of time I'll forgo some of my more involved questions, but suffice it to say that you were then placed in the Stark home to act as a sort of bodyguard, is that correct?"
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. He should've known that he couldn't hide anything from Papa. And everyone always said that he was the perceptive one.
he thinks as he takes his final breath.  Out of the corner of his eye he sees Shostakov about a quarter of a body length ahead of him, but quickly tells himself that it doesn’t matter.  A silver medal in this race will still ensure him a spot on the 4x100 relay, which means he should still get at least one more gold medal before he hangs up his goggles.
"They took—HYDRA, they…" He paused to suck in air, his entire body shuddering and his teeth clenched. "Oh God, Tony they
"Shh, little guy," Papa whispered as he patted the back of Peter's neck. "I can hear your mind spinning. Try not to worry, okay?"
Tony breathed in, clenching his jaw. "JARVIS, on my mark, find the weakest spot that you can on this roof and blast it to hell, yeah? Two shots if you can do it, all three if you have to."
"You know Peter's perfectly capable of making his own breakfast, sweetheart, but I can take a hint," Steve gently admonished. "I'll be back soon with your tea."
The next three towers are taken in much the same manner, so swiftly that Steve’s almost lulled into a sense of semi-security when a booming klaxon alarm suddenly starts blaring from the main building, interspersed with an intruder alert broadcasted in German.
"Good," Steve said as he tugged Tony's face down for a kiss, one that sent warmth spreading across Steve's chest and down his arms and legs by the time they broke apart. "But now, you need food."
And while he never would have considered swimming in the past, the possibility grew on him quickly, and he was so excited when he found out that Olympic gold medalist Steve Rogers was working at Empire State.  Since one of Peter’s classmates, Cindy, takes Krav Maga lessons from Ms Romanoff and really enjoys them, Peter figured it couldn't hurt to ask if Mr Rogers would be interested in taking him on as a swimming student.
“Yeah, I think I do,” Steve says, scowling.
Ned shrugged. "Okay, whatever. I just thought it seemed kinda interesting."
hoping it wasn't another one of Thanos' goons.
"I'm ready. I promise."
"Oh, yeah. Just in time for you guys to leave again," Gwen said with a sigh. She leaned against the row of lockers as Peter tackled his combination lock. "I was kinda hoping we'd get to spend some time together during break."
"So now he's got four of the stones?" asked Dad. "You actually saw him with four of the stones?"
Howard nodded, his expression almost stunned as he gestured towards Sharon. "Ms Carter, if you will?"
"And as I've said multiple times, being a vigilante is never cool," said Mr Stacy. "That… guy wearing a red and blue leotard and flying around Queens on ropes might've been able to do one decent thing, but he was also interfering with police business and is damn lucky that he hasn't inspired some other kids with too much time on their hands to do the same, or someone could really get hurt."
"Ah huh. And when will that be?"
“Oh, really?  It’s not a good look?” Tony asked, wishing with all of his might that he could scream what he was about to say next to the entire world.  “Well, you know what else isn’t a ‘good look for the company’?  Finding out that its CFO is selling weapons under the table to the very same insurgents that Steve’s team was sent in to stop!”  Tony held up his hand, halting Obie’s protest before it could begin.  “And
on a cement floor.
As soon as the word left his mouth Steve pressed the button and immediately yanked the stick to the left, holding his breath as he waited for the master alarm to start beeping, indicating that he'd missed the window.
In fact, he'd even told Steve that before their first time, he had always kept his shirt on during sex.
"No, I wasn't—" Steve started.
It took Steve only a second for that information to sink in.
"Okay, that's definitely
Tony lifted his head, trying to ignore the deep worry wrinkle between Steve's perfect eyebrows. "Oh, and you don't? Wait, don't—don't answer that."
Steve groaned, biting down hard on his bottom lip. "Oh
Peter shoots him a look, one Tony likes to call his
“Mmm,” Tony mumbles as he sits down at the kitchen table, kneading his temples with his fingertips.  Thanks to Peter’s swimming tryout, he missed his mid-afternoon coffee break, and is already starting to feel the effects from the lack of caffeine.  Peter would tell him that his burgeoning headache means that he’s drinking too much of the stuff, which is probably true, given that Rhodey always says he drinks enough for an entire army.
"Goddamnit, buddy, you're not supposed to be here!" Dad exclaimed as he flew up next to Peter. "You just scared the hell outta both of us!"
Tony breathed in, squeezing his eyes closed as he burrowed his nose into Steve's neck. The man even still smelled incredible—musky and masculine with a faint hint of what Tony identified as vanilla, a scent he'd always loved—which was more than he could probably say for himself. Especially given all of their activities over the course of the night.
"He's been arrested," he finally said. "HYDRA's got him."
"Are your glasses okay?" Rogers asked, his expression hovering between a grimace and something that Tony couldn't quite identify. He slid the glasses onto his face, sneaking a quick but admiring glance at Rogers' broad shoulders before forcibly averting his gaze.
"Two shots seemed to have done it, sir!" JARVIS said quickly.
But now, they were all gone. Blasted into nothingness, like Bucky, and Sam, and Wanda.
If he hadn't banked right when he had he would've gone up too, and likely taken Sam right along with him.
Instead of answering, Steve drew Tony closer, placing him squarely in his lap and capturing his lips again. His arms wound around Tony's waist, pressing him against him as Tony's hands flew to Steve's hair, holding his head in place.
"From what we have seen, you are not completely defenceless, correct?" asked T'Challa.
"Of course, Captain."
And this, as painful as it was, had to be no different. His personal feelings had absolutely no impact on their current problem, and therefore had to be pushed aside, as much as humanly possible. Even with the backing of King T'Challa's warriors, the Avengers were the last, best hope that Earth had against Thanos and his Chitauri army, so he needed to step up and be the leader the team needed him to be.
"Oh yeah, that's perfect," Peter said as he lined up his camera, taking several shots from a few different angles. So far he had found that he enjoyed photography almost as much as he did painting, and that was a heck of a lot. He and Papa had been spending so much time experimenting with their new paints that just about every single wall in their new home featured at least one of their creations, including a new rendition of Mrs Bird and her three chicks that hung on the wall in Peter's bedroom. They had also given a bunch of pictures to Uncle James and Auntie Carol, Grandma, and Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky too.
"Uh huh," said Peter. "Just a bit cold."
Sam gave a shrug, downing his second glass of whisky so fast the waitress barely had a chance to set it down.
"I'm worried that you're gonna get sick, sweetheart," he finally murmured. "And with that thing embedded in your chest, I'm just—"
"Yeah, we are
Which is just silly, because the scar on his chest isn’t even that noticeable.  Certainly not the gross thing that Dad makes it out to be.
“Okay, buddy, what else can I do for you?” Tony asked.  “I’m sure you’ve gotta be hungry.”
"Okay, so... dare I ask how your run went this morning?" Sam asked, pausing mid-chew as Steve sat down with his loaded breakfast tray.
“Yes,” Steve whispered as he drew in a shaky breath.  “I was just thinking… what—what’re the odds of—
Then again, Steve was a soldier, not a scientist, so what did he know? There were probably very good reasons why the government did what they did, especially since Steve knew without a doubt that not a single Langaran citizen wanted to experience something as horrible as the Battle of the Continents ever again.
"Oh. Yeah, that," Peter muttered.
"The tenth of January, sir, of this year."
Peter gave her a wide smile. "Oh, yeah. The rest of us were so relieved when they finally quit dancing around each other too. I think deep down Uncle Bucky was still afraid it was a sin or illegal or something, like it was back in his time."
Gwen let out a heavy sigh, nodding somberly. "Okay. But can you please tell him that I called once he wakes up? I'm just worried—the whole team, we're just worried about him, and… the way he ran out of Liz's party after what Flash said to him, I just… and I'm sure you've heard that Mr Toomes got arrested? Something about some illegal weapons trafficking or something… that's what I heard from my dad, at least, but—"
, Peter thought as he pushed open the door, noticing that its accompanying chime wasn't the high-pitched sound he’d been expecting.  It was much lower, almost like the sound that certain metals made while underwater.
About three seconds later, the door buzzes open to reveal steps leading both upstairs and downstairs.  As they climb the stairs to the third level, Peter’s heart beats faster and faster until it jumps right into his throat, almost causing him to choke as they arrive outside the door to the office area.
my own, and—" He broke off then, suppressing a hard shudder as he recalled the burn of the Aminacin drug flowing into his veins as various nonsensical words were repeatedly chanted around him. He still couldn't remember all that much of being brought to the bunker or the battle that followed, mainly just bits and pieces of things, but Papa had told him that Obie and Killian's ultimate goal had been to convert Peter into another Winter Soldier, and that they had very nearly managed to do it.
"Mmm, long as it's in the morning," Tony mumbled, already half asleep. He felt Steve's fingers weave into his hair, his fingertips pressing against his scalp in just the way that he loved. "Oh gods, babe, that feels amazing."
"Steve, I don't think combing your hair again is gonna do any good!" Bucky whined. "For the eightieth time, you look fine!"
"Well, politicians only like to complain and point fingers," said Steve. "It was like that when I was growing up, and I don't see it changing anytime soon."
"Daaaddd…"
"Come in?" he said, expecting to see either Natasha, Bruce, or James, or even Nebula, the blue android-like girl who had accompanied Tony on the ship home. She and her sister were staying in one of the guest suites at the Compound and had mainly kept to themselves since their arrival, aside from Nebula's occasional check-in to see how Tony was doing.
"Okay, so do we know who accessed it?" asked Steve. "Was it Beck?"
"I can only imagine, Captain," said the chairman. "And I thank both you and Mr Stark for your cooperation, that concludes this hearing."
And then again after Steve's capture by HYDRA, when he feared that his boys might actually lose
I can’t believe we’re so close to the end! 😮
To his surprise he found Steve standing outside his office door, still wearing his sweat-plastered flight suit.
"Let's not at the moment, okay?" Tony said. He kissed the top of Peter's head, which smelled very strongly of fifteen-year-old boy sweat. "Maybe just let us get Pete cleaned up and get him some food first?"
"No, no, no, not like that! Let's go this way. There, that's more like it," Peter muttered, his fingers flying so quickly over the tiny datapad keyboard that they were starting to cramp. He'd been at it for over three hours now, ever since he had noticed some unknown person trying to mess around with JARVIS's code.
This—
"Tony," Steve said gently as he reached for his hand. "Sweetheart, I think I might have a good idea. Let's just listen for a bit, okay?"
"Yeah?"
Apparently, Peter's natural spider-vision allowed him to see past the HYDRA cloaking technology.
"Well, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted,
"I'm fine," Tony said automatically, rolling his eyes when Sam gave him one of Peter's
“Well, that was pretty smart of you,” says Mr Rogers.  “So, if it’s all right with your father, why don't we head down to the pool and you can show me, hmm?”
Steve's eyes immediately went wide, his fingers clamping down around Tony's.
There were plenty of men who had endured being held prisoner during the war, and if they could survive it, then so could he.
"So, what, they erased his memories and then sent him to work at Peter's school as a spy?"
"I know, honey." Tony brought Steve's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "Helen and I were talking a bit while you were making Pete's food earlier, and we're thinking that when Obie and Killian were trying to convert him down in Miami that his mind set up some kind of self-defence system against the programming, which is why he goes into a coma whenever he hears the trigger words."
"Good, good. You know how much Papa loves his history."
They were silent the rest of the way home, and it wasn't until they were all sitting on the squashy couch in the living room with steaming cups of hot chocolate that Papa placed his big hand on Peter's shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze.
replied the nurse. As soon as Dr Goldman was out of sight, she turned to the respiratory therapist, who was still writing down Peter's vital signs. "
"You gonna want to invite the whole team again?" Tony asked. "Another team-building field trip?"
He felt Steve's lips press against the top of his head. "Tony, it's all right," he whispered. "I'm right here."
Tony gasped as Steve flipped them so he was on top again, grinding his hips down against Tony's. "You're so good, baby, so good to me."
Of course, the middle of Earth’s first alien invasion was not exactly the best time for Tony to be ogling anyone, especially since for most of his life he had tried to convince himself that he despised anything to do with Steve Rogers.  Choosing to interpret Steve’s overall uneasiness with the modern times he’d been so rudely thrust into as arrogance, Tony had almost managed to put him out of his mind until he happened to wake up in the middle of that destroyed street to find those goddamn blue eyes—with just the slightest hint of green—staring down at him.
, if it meant that he could wind up here, in a beautiful upstate home with the very husband and child he’d always wanted.
"Uncle James told me that you weren't all that hurt, but—"
Tony nodded, swiping his wrist across his eyes.
“Good.  We still on for the Jericho presentation at the end of next week?”
as it sank into the icy Arctic water. Tony's head immediately snapped up, his brown eyes wide with fear as the street outside the Sanctum suddenly filled with the screams and shouts of terrified people, and the honking and crashing of cars.
"I will take him out," Thor finished. He clapped a strong hand on Steve's shoulder. "Very good, Captain."
—!" He cut off as his huge right foot tripped over a boulder poking out of the ground, landing smack onto his front and skidding for several metres.
"And that monitoring thing would've let someone in to mess with the programming?" asked Uncle Bucky.
"But I also know that going for weeks on end with only a couple hours' sleep isn't exactly healthy," he added. "And I just…" he trailed off, not wanting to voice the big concern that often occupied the forefront of his mind. "I just miss you."
All he'd wanted was to burn those images from his mind, to burn the ice away.
"I dunno, 'bout a seven, maybe?" Peter replied, flinching when Dr Cho hit a particularly tender spot on his knee. "It's already a bit better than it was at Gwen's house though."
There was a short pause while Peter tried to figure out if Uncle Sam was joking or not, as his sense of humour tended towards the dry, sarcastic side. But several heartbeats later when he hadn't quirked his eyebrow or done anything else to indicate that he was kidding, Peter let out a gasp.
So instead he just kissed Steve again, whispering, "I love you too, baby. Now, show me."
"You're building another suit?" Steve asked, quirking an eyebrow.
"Pete?" Tony said, relieved when Peter didn't even glance in his direction, his gaze firmly trained on his Uncle Bucky through the window. "All right, Sam, go!"
Steve was just about to reply when he heard a sudden crackling noise off to his left, causing him to jump back. He immediately grabbed for Sam, shoving him behind him just as some kind of glowing golden circle of light appeared about a metre or so away. The circle was rotating counterclockwise, throwing off massive sparks as it grew wider and wider until it was large enough for a man to step through.
“Mmm, if you say so,” Peter said warily.  “But, as you can plainly see, yes.  I have remembered my head.”
If such a thing had even existed, that is.
"Tony, let me go with him," Howard pleaded as the medics loaded Peter onto their stretcher. "Please, you need to finish your work, you know they won't let you—"
Which meant that no matter what the outcome of the battle, the team would be stuck there, in their new present.
A touch on Steve's skin startled him into looking back down. A sheet was being drawn over him, from the feet up. It was the first time his bare skin had been covered since he'd woken. The material felt both rough and slippery at once as it slid over his skin.
He had no idea.
Behind him, a weight shifted. With surprising speed Stark's arm snaked over him, hand falling on his, hard.
Day 18: Phobias
He opened his eyes to see that he was still lying there in that coffin, that there were ice cubes clattering in from the sides of it, smothering his body in a quilt of glistening white crystal, freezing and burning him at once all over.
The worst part was, Steve couldn't argue with that assessment.
But there came the squelch of more liquid squeezed out of a bottle, a steady press against his entrance, and then something was pushing into him, warm and probing. Pinned and spread like a butterfly on display, he was powerless to fight it. He tried to push back against it, to squeeze himself shut, but the sick slick of the lubricant prevented even that resistance, and the thing slipped right in, like he was made for it.
When Clint drawled, "See?" his voice came from somewhere behind Steve. Close, too close. "When he's out, you don't have to talk to him. It's easier."
Steve hesitated. He could still take the gag out, could still... what? Fighting here wasn't worth it.
Another arm that ended in something like the nipple of a baby bottle began to caress him, groping the crease made by his joined legs, his trapped cock, his ass crack, trailing lubricant as it went. When it reached his entrance, it began to coat him with the substance there, dabbing with all the delicacy of a steam engine. Steve's hands jerked in an abortive attempt to fend off the touch, and more mechanical arms came out, chirring and squealing, to hold them down, as if the rope weren't enough.
As for the despair, well.
But as an hand parted the sheet he held clutched over himself, traced down his ribs, scraping through the hair on his chest, the chilling touch sent fresh horror pouring through him. Stark at least had been flesh and blood. His new captor seemed made of ice, could command it at will. The prurient interest the man took in Steve's body, skating over his pecs, rubbing his nipples until they each pebbled up in turn, left Steve with no illusions about what he was after. If he didn't get away, he was going to be fucked by a being made of ice.
Chained to my bed, Stark had said. Used.
"Poor thing," crooned a voice in his ear, and Steve jerked again in his bonds.
He tried to get to this feet, but the collar only shocked him again. "Why?" he sobbed. "I'm going."
One of the nurses took hold of some wires that he hadn't noticed before, and yanked. They came away from his wrist and throat with a sharp sting, and the beeping cut off mid-tone.
"Put them behind your back. Lace your fingers. Good. Keep them clasped like that, and don't let go, no matter what. There's a good boy."
How many others had he done this to?
Day 1: Waking up restrained
"You were watching," Steve realized. "You've been watching all these times."
He must have drifted off at some point, because he woke to feel Stark's obvious hard-on pressed between the cleft of his butt, Stark's wandering hands groping up and down his chest, teasing at the sensitive flesh of his nipple.
Watching himself treated like a piece of meat, feeling the machine continuously using his hole, Steve sank deeper and deeper. Stark was right. This was all he was good for. Here was video evidence. It didn't matter what he felt. If even a machine wanted to ravage his body for its pleasure, he mattered even less than a metal box of wires. He was nothing, he only existed to be fucked. He'd submit to whatever was in store for him.
As he spoke, he reached for the collar around Steve's neck, and broke it off with ease.
Steve was too far gone for shame. He begged to be used. Every nasty, degrading thing he could remember Stark saying to him spilled from his mouth until he was inventing them himself, things that didn't even make sense.
"I do not understand," he grunted, releasing Steve arms to point at the screen. Steve grunted too, for a different reason, as the massive girth sank all the way in, and stayed there, impossibly large, impossibly filling. "Did the warrior not beat his opponent into submission? Why must he now quit the arena?"
"There you are," came a voice, smooth and liquid, though it didn't seem to pass through his ears at all.
Steve and Tony watched them go, with Steve wearing a rather bemused expression that Tony knew mirrored his own. "Been good for Pete having Thor around lately," he said. "Even if he can't understand why we don't use ravens as a method of communication."
"You know it does, buddy," answered Tony as he ruffled Peter's hair, earning him a playful scowl. "I should just let you do all the tinkering here, it'd probably get done faster."
"Yes, Master Peter?"
And, even better,
"So I suppose the only remaining question, is Hammer working for HYDRA or is HYDRA working for him?" asked Steve.
"You think this has anything to do with that drug Aminacin that Killian gave us?" he finally asked. "I know Bruce gave us both the antidote, but maybe some of it is still in our systems somewhere, just waiting to cause trouble."
"Oh, sure," said Steve. "And that's why you're always running on fumes when you turn in your aircraft, right? 'Cause you're just having so much fun up there, behavin'?"
Just as JARVIS had reported, Peter appeared to be sleeping peacefully, clutching the stuffed polar bear that Tony had gotten for him as a replacement for the one he had lost when their Malibu home was destroyed. His sweet, round face was relaxed with his lips in a slight pout, something both Tony and Steve had always thought was absolutely precious.
baby, I need—I need—"
"Uh huh!" Peter answered as both he and the chariot slammed down to the ground, with Peter launching another web barely a second later. "You don't have to worry about me!"
Steve was panting, his head tipped back against the couch and his blond hair plastered to his forehead as he nodded once, curling his arms around Tony.
"Tony, are you there?" he pleaded as his nanite cowl disappeared, pressing his fingers over his ear. "Tony, please come in!"
Peter shook his head, burrowing further into his blankets. "It's nothing JARVIS, just talking to myself."
"Well, how fatherly of you," said Dr Strange. "But have you figured out how to turn the ship around yet?"
Steve thought as he gave a single nod.
It made sense, Tony had to admit, and even more so given Steve's lack of relationship experience. He just wouldn't know how to play the stupid mind-games that some people enjoyed when chasing a prospective partner.
stress, but he never seemed to appreciate it when Peter pointed that out.
It also gave him an unabashed opportunity to watch Steve's face as he orgasmed without being distracted by his own pleasure. Steve was so gorgeous when he came, and the fact that Tony was the only person to ever see him in the throes of climax was so unbelievably hot that he could barely stand it.
"Steve?" Tony said, his face etched in worry. "Honey, what in the goddamn
"You're such a sap, Rogers," Tony said as Steve kissed down to his abs, which contracted at his touch. "But I'm thinking that I'm gonna need a bit more Brooklyn from you tonight."
Even Pietro and Wanda, who'd only been with the team since the end of May and were still learning how to use the full extent of their abilities, could call themselves Avengers.
And while Peter knew that his dads didn't blame him at all for what had happened, he also knew that at the moment, they had absolutely no idea of what to do next.
"Then get 'em the hell up here!"
His name was Doctor Mark Goldman, the Chief Neonatologist at Mount Sinai Medical Centre in New York City. The very same doctor who had saved Peter's life after he was born over eight weeks prematurely.
Rage flooded Tony's veins, burning through the ice. How
Steve's hand tightened on Tony's shoulder as he burrowed even further into Tony's neck. "Then we fight back, just like Peter said."
“Oh, nothing,” Steve says, waving a dismissive hand.  “It’s fine, Lorraine.  I’ll keep the appointment.”
A chorus of chuckles erupted from the guests, after which Colonel Phillips proceeded to give the kindest, most emotionally evocative speech that Steve had ever heard him give. For several minutes he spoke about Tony's incredible steadfastness in the face of almost insurmountable odds, and how his brilliant and innovative mind helped lead their entire world to where it was today. For Steve, he spoke about his unending drive and determination, at first simply to survive, and then to become the very best fighter pilot that the Air Corps had ever seen. A drive that led to him becoming the first Langaran to ever fly in space, and that also helped to keep him alive when the enemy threatened to strand him there.
"Clint?" Steve said in his Captain's voice. "What's going on?"
If Steve had thought that by halting Stark Industries weapons’ construction that Tony’s workload might decrease a little, he had been sorely mistaken.  If anything, the complete changeover into developing products such as medical devices and other useful hardware seemed like it had caused Tony’s workload to increase by at least a factor of ten.  Already he’d had to hire a dozen new engineers to help design all of the products he had ideas for, all of which would be powered by his new clean-energy power source.
Just then one of the brightest bolts of lightning Steve had ever seen lit up the sky around them, accompanied by a shocked, "Holy
"Hey, I'm just sayin'," added Sam. "I can recognise a blatant call for attention when I see one."
"You should tell him about the dance-off to save the universe, Quill," said Drax.
"I'm the one who's lucky, sweetheart. Now, will you please roll over for me?"
“But not on purpose,” Tony insisted.  He leaned closer, placing his other hand on Steve’s back.  “All parents hurt their kids sometimes.  I once elbowed Pete in the head so hard that I knocked him down.  He was standing right there in my blind spot, and I turned too fast and—look, it just happens, honey.  It doesn't mean that you don't love him.  And Pete knows that.  He’s been so worried about you the whole weekend!”
“All right, Clint,” he says as he mounts the bike.  “Go ahead and get into position.”
"Aw, man! Are you guys being all smooshy again?" Peter said as he reappeared, fishing pole and tackle box in-hand.
"Well, then that'll be the easiest thing I've ever done in my life," said Tony. "But now, we should probably go feed you, hmm? I wasn't kidding about Pete eating all of your pizza."
"Carol, get on my wing," commanded Steve. If nothing else he could help shadow Carol since his reflexes were a bit faster. "Just follow me through, understood?"
"Yeah, I know, but Dad's got us on a complete lock-down right now. None of the people here can even leave until the new security systems are in place, so…" Peter didn't add that three people had already been arrested and removed from the Compound's premises due to suspicious activity on Papa's orders. That information would only invite more questions for which they still had no decent answers.
"Now then. Mr Stark's qualifications more than speak for themselves, including not one, but two degrees from Langara's most prestigious university, one of which is in the field of thermodynamic astrophysics and of which he is currently the only expert on the entire planet."
Almost everyone was there to support them, and it made Steve's heart feel just a little less heavy.
"Well… yeah. That too."
"Yeah, we sure did, honey," Tony whispered back. "And I love you too."
Besides, Peter already had a father, and one that he obviously loved very much. And he really barely knew Steve.
And, knowing how stubborn they both were, Peter highly doubted that it had gotten resolved. The two of them could go round and round on the same topic for weeks and still not resolve things.
Steve thought as he slowly made his way towards Peter's room. There was no sense in stressing an already sick child even more by admitting that he'd discovered that his grandfather was the national pihrah.
The one Tony had so aptly nicknamed, Voldemort.
Dr Strange looked up at a pile of dust-covered debris. "Oh, let me guess. Your home?"
"Preferably without burning down the palace, correct, little sister?" T'Challa said firmly, earning an exaggerated scoff from Shuri.
"Dad, I really,
He couldn’t allow himself to break down yet.  Not in front of Peter.
Tony knew that when he pulled Stark Industries out of the weapons business it had created a pretty big void in the market, one that any number of companies would likely jump at the chance to fill. He just never thought the military would be stupid enough to…
Lorraine turns in her chair, raising an eyebrow.  “Yes?” she says.  “Is there a problem with it?”
Stepping out of the car, Steve waited until Tony joined him on the sidewalk before heading towards the store.  About three steps in their hands brushed, which Steve took as an opportunity to intertwine their fingers, flooding his entire body with a tingling sensation.
"Dad, he was pretty upset, and…" Peter shook his head, swallowing a cough. "He said something about it being the anniversary of when he was released from prison or something, but… he was slurring his words so bad that I couldn't understand most of what he was saying, and… I still can't believe he'd managed to walk all the way here, he was shaking pretty bad too."
"Mmm," muttered Steve. He wasn't about to say it out loud, but he still didn't quite trust SHIELD. Even with Fury's ongoing vetting process for his people, the fact that they were still finding rogue HYDRA agents embedded in SHIELD only a little over a year ago rankled him. "If you think that's best, then I'm sure it's okay."
"Oh, yes," said Grandma. "Joseph was the most wonderful artist. While we were courting he used to draw me pictures all the time, and I always carried at least one of them with me wherever I went. And he was also such a gentleman. Always offering me his arm when we were walking, opening doors, things like that."
"You're welcome, Miss Stacy. Have a wonderful night."
"Wow," Tony whispered once they broke apart. "That was—that was—"
That its demons were going to be particularly difficult to control. Steve's had already taken to tormenting him during the few moments he'd managed to sleep in the last three days, and he had a feeling it was only going to get worse as time went on.
"Нет," said Bucky, not even blinking as he leaned closer. "Я решил не подчиняться."
But he couldn't. Not until he'd brought Papa home.
"Really?" Peter said, feigning surprise. "That's so cool!"
There was a series of about five beeps, all varying in pitch and tone before JARVIS spoke up again.
The slightest of smiles stretched across Tony's lips as he looked at Steve.
Rogers blinked, clearing his throat as he nodded, those intense eyes of his almost boring a hole through Tony's skull.
"Seems like about half," James said, tossing Steve a grim look. "Is that what that lunatic said he was gonna do with the stones? Wipe out half of humanity?"
"It's not weakness, you know," Ma suddenly said a few moments later, startling him. She must've been seeing the others out.
"Yeah, that's true," muttered Steve, suppressing a shiver. He didn't like being reminded of Siberia, and especially of what he had found there. "Do you think this place could be a counterpart to the Siberian base? It's about the same size and design."
"Just some new web shooters. Pete made a couple tweaks to the design, so… JARVIS has 'em going up at the Compound already."
"No, Tony, it's nothing specific," answered Steve. "I mean, Nat and Wanda were in there while I was in there, and they were asking about Peter, and about how Bruce was doing, and wondering if they should go ahead and order Pietro some more shoes, 'cause he's already worn through the entire supply that we got for him when they first arrived. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but the whole time I just kept thinking about how I just wanted to get back to my son." He brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it. "I'm just tired. And I don't think it's the kind of tired that sleep can fix."
Papa smiled. "All right then. Have a nice evening."
"That's better," Steve said. He reached for his coffee, giving his stomach a stern order to stand down for the time being.
"Barton?" Tony said as Clint's face appeared on his monitor, looking as grumpy as ever. "Tell me you've got good news?"
"Steve, I know that already," Tony said impatiently. "But… damn, honey. This time the goddamn monster almost triggered
With a final wave, Peter stepped out onto the sidewalk to find Dad standing by the driver’s door of his orange Audi, waving impatiently.
"I'd like to practise giving the unprepared speeches today," Liz continued, earning a chorus of groans from the rest of the team. "Cindy, you'll go first."
Pulling up to the curb about five spaces away from the store, Steve hesitated, wringing his hands in his lap as Tony shifted the car into Park.  He’d written
“Uh huh,” Peter says, yawning as he gets out of the car.  He’s so tired that he completely whiffs the first time he reaches for his backpack strap, nearly tipping over sideways in the process.  Tony bites his lip to keep from laughing as Peter finally hefts the backpack over his shoulder, which then proceeds to slip forward and knock him in the back of his head as he reaches for his swimming bag.
"'M tired," Peter mumbled as he tried again with the backpack, this time missing his shoulder completely as it landed on one of the adjoining seats. Steve let out a chuckle from behind him as he picked it up, placing his free hand on Peter's shoulder.
"You did?" Peter asked eagerly. "Oh, Papa, that's so awesome! Where're we going?"
mine! They took it from me, and I don't—I don't know where it is, and—"
"Thank you," Peter answered with what he hoped was a kind smile. His smiles had been so few and far between lately that when he did manage one it seemed so foreign on his lips that he was afraid it looked fake. But the lady gave him a kind smile in return, so maybe it hadn't been too horrible.
The sound of the two armies colliding could only be described as epic. Steve ducked down behind his shield as he drew back his right fist, landing it square in the jaw of one of the Chitauri warriors and sending him flying. Next to him, the Wakandan warrior M'Baku let out a booming war cry as he leapt from the ground, managing to catch one of the Chitauri speeders as it attempted to fly overhead, its driver crashing to the ground with a sickening
"JARVIS, is Bucky still alive?" demanded Steve. "What's his condition?"
but he didn't want to just dismiss them out of hand either. His family had already had far too much experience with shared and prophetic dreams. After Obadiah injected Peter with the HYDRA drug CTX-616 in Afghanistan, he started slipping into Bucky's dreams once they captured him following the Project Insight debacle, witnessing firsthand the murder of Tony's parents by the Winter Soldier.
"Not yet," Steve murmured, even as his fists ached to punch the nose right from Thanos' face. The Power Stone power trip Thanos had gone on before acquiring the Soul Stone the first time around was still fresh in Steve's mind, and he absolutely did
But they hadn't been. From what both Tony and Bruce had been able to determine, the strange beam that attacked Wakanda had originated from space.
agreed Uncle Sam.
your fault, do you understand me? Don't you even be talking like that! Do you have any idea how your dads would feel if they heard you saying stuff like that?"
"What, think?" Peter asked.
Tony exclaimed. His fingers wrapped around his left forearm, squeezing hard. "You told him you knew who he was? What, are you talking in some kind of a teenage code or something?"
Wanda's eyebrows knitted together as she looked Peter up and down. "How would you be able to help the Avengers?"
"Look, I promise that if you don't end up liking it, I won't make you wear it. But I am almost a hundred percent sure that you will. Yours and Pete's suits are both about as different from mine as you can get, and I'm still making one for him."
And while Tony was by nature skeptical, and even more so when it came to anything regarding the Langaran government, Peter had always been the optimistic one. Even after he was told that he could no longer participate in gym class. Even after he was told he could no longer ride his bike or walk down the block to the corner market. Even after he had to be pulled from primary school because the doctors felt he was too sick to continue.
"Great!" He gently clapped his hand on Peter's shoulder. "Would you mind showing me some of your drawings?"
"P-Pete!" Dad sputtered as he lunged for Peter, wrapping him in his arms as Papa's long arms curled around them both, hugging them to his strong, broad chest. "Oh, Christ, Pete, you're here! You're okay! Oh God, we have
If Tony didn't know better, he would've thought that the no-nonsense pilot almost looked
"All right." Tony glanced down at Bucky, who gave him a quick nod. "We're ready."
And if the photos were able to do it all justice, Peter knew that Papa was going to be absolutely floored once he saw everything.
That hospital stay had ended up lasting over a week, and once it was over, Steve swore that he would never, ever go through that again.
"Oh no!" Steve gasped as he immediately banked to the left, twisting in the air as he pointed the nose of the aircraft straight up. Based on what he'd learned about the X-302's power source the risk of an engine stall in a straight vertical climb was pretty much nonexistent, so as long as he didn't somehow run out of sky he would hopefully be okay—
A knot the size of a marble rose in Tony's throat. Sometimes the selflessness of his son shocked even him.
They were silent on the drive back to the barracks, with Tony only releasing Steve's hand long enough to get into the car and back out of it. The weight of their combined worry was so crushing that it threatened to break them, their only hope of survival resting on the fact that they knew they were in this together.
"Yeah, I figured that out too," Peter said. "And it'll be even worse if they find out that our government was planning on using it to build weapons of mass destruction, so—"
"Tony!" he said, his blue eyes clouded with fear and pain as they studied Tony's face. "Are you—you're still real?"
"Thanks for the ride," Tony muttered as he slid out of the car. He activated the handlamp, following the bright yellow beam as it led him towards the front door and hoping the noise from the lumbering vehicle wasn't loud enough to wake up his son.
"Then you should be able to?" Gwen said eagerly, sending another rush of warmth across Peter's chest. After the whole peppermint incident Dad and Papa had flat-out refused to allow Peter to go back to Gwen's house, and while they had been able to see each other a couple of times over Christmas break, it was always at the Tower under the watchful eyes of Papa, Dad, and JARVIS, which didn't allow for very many opportunities for much of anything besides some accidental-on-purpose knee touching and elbow rubbing. They had exchanged Christmas presents, with Peter giving Gwen one of the brand-new StarkPens for her tablet and Gwen presenting Peter with an incredible model replica of the original Starship Enterprise, but that had been pretty much it.
“Steve, please, I’m so sorry.  I know it wasn't your fault what happened, and I never should’ve—”
"I'm—" Tony started, quickly clamping his jaw closed. There was no way his usual, off-the-cuff "I'm fine" was going to fly anywhere with Steve. He knew him far too well.
Papa had never been good at hiding his emotions, and even less so since the attack up at the Compound. And the intense fear that had been constantly plastered all over Papa's face ever since the Compound attack was not something that Peter liked to see.
Tony sniffed, stuffing another piece of bread into his mouth. "Yeah, but at least yours didn't dump you off on someone else most of the time."
“Uh huh,” Peter replies softly.  He cracks one eye open, eyeing Tony warily.  “You too, okay?  You talk about me getting enough sleep, when you never do.”
ever happen again. Not only was his life completely ruined, but also my mom's, my own, and—"
A loud
"Mr Stacy, it's nice to see you again," Steve said as he unconsciously reached for Tony's arm, fighting the urge to step in front of him. George Stacy was a police officer, not a government official, and ever since the theatre incident Steve had had no real reason to view him as a threat, but that damn senate hearing had gotten him so twitchy, as Peter would say, that he was even more paranoid than usual.
Pressing a kiss to Steve's forehead, Tony tightened his arms around him, begging the various deities floating around up in the heavens to let his man get some decent rest for a change, free from the nightmares that caused his beautiful face to screw into expressions of such unimaginable pain that it nearly caused Tony's heart to crack in two.
"Colonel Rhodes might've mentioned something to me about your boy this morning," he said, as if he'd read Tony's mind. "And it's not pity, Tony. Dare I say that it's actual, genuine concern."
Anything to help ease his husband's worry burden a little. Because despite Steve's ongoing discussions with Sam, his goofy time-merging nightmares hadn't eased up at all.
Steve's cheeks immediately flushed and he coughed, prompting Bucky to snort. "What, you don't think so?"
And his father's pleas, sounding like they were a million miles away.
Or in any moment, for that matter.
"Tony, they're high school students, so I would hope that none of them would need security clearance," Natasha said slowly. "But if it helps I can run some quick inquiries on their parents, just to make sure."
“Sounds good,” says Steve.  “Shoot it on over to me once you're done, okay?”
Peter shrugged. "I don't know, Dad. All I need is for you to just sign the form."
"Everything's gonna be okay now," said Image Tony. "It's all over.
"Yeah, it's better." Peter pecked her lips again before drawing her in for a big hug, inhaling the sweet lavender scent of her hair. "We need to do stuff like this more often."
"Mmm, okay," muttered Bucky. "But something tells me it's gonna be a doozy of a story."
"Die, blanket of death!" someone else yelled from a few feet away. Peter immediately jumped up, his suit's spider legs activating as he took off towards the Flash Gordon mask-wearing dude who had kicked him. He leaped up, ready to pounce just as the dude tossed some sort of electrical rope at him. As if it had a mind of its own, the rope quickly coiled itself around Peter's body as the guy yanked on it, causing him to crash onto the floor. The guy immediately grabbed for Peter, hauling him up and pointing the end of his blaster right at the side of Peter's head, his strong arm pressing against Peter's windpipe even through his suit. Peter's belly swooped in fear, his heart thudding as he scanned the area for Dad.
"Yeah, okay," he murmured as he followed Sam over to one of the public water fountains. He tried to stretch while they waited in line for their turn, shaking out his arms and stretching out his quads as he attempted to come up with yet another excuse for not wanting to buy season tickets to the Mets.
He also needed to make sure that if he did decide to stick with Steve, that both he and Peter understood all of the possible ramifications of that choice.  Ramifications that wouldn’t only affect Tony and Peter, but also every single employee at Stark Industries and everyone who purchased the company’s goods and services.
"Not to worry, Captain," said Doctor List as he withdrew the syringe, now filled with Steve's blood. "Your son will be treated very well."
"I'm still not okay with just sitting here until he turns the thing on though," Tony said firmly. "We need—"
“No, my dad should be here soon to pick me up anyway, so I should probably get going,” he added.  “But I’m definitely gonna come back here again, I still haven't even checked out the rest of the store!”
"Yes, and because of that, HYDRA took him and tried to convert him into one of their Winter Soldiers!"
“Uh huh.  See ya.”
"Ah, guys?" Natasha cut in as the suits powered up, the collective whine of their flight stabilisers almost drowning out the Avengers' comms. "Whatever we're gonna do we better do it soon, 'cause it seems like Hammer's done talking."
"I have already informed Dr Cho that Master Peter has awoken, Captain," said JARVIS. "She will be arriving momentarily."
"Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me, 'cause I don't like fish either," Peter whispered back. "Well, at least I don't like eating them. I like watching mine swim around in his tank though."
Uncle Bucky tipped his head back, running his hand through his hair. "Look, Peter, I think what I should do is tell Sam about all of this, okay? Then he and Colonel Rhodes can bring it up with Tony, and—"
As long as he would be able to escape from Gwen without a huge scene, he should be okay.
"And how far are those coordinates from Savannah?" asked Sam.
The fact that the U.S. was literally built on the backs of immigrants seemed to escape the President's thought process, something that both Dad and Papa felt very strongly about since they were both descendants of immigrants. Peter had heard the stories about Grandpa Howard's father more times than he could count, and Papa had also told him a few about when his own father came over from Ireland, trying to escape the turmoil resulting from the harsh discriminatory policies of Great Britain against the country.
"Honestly, if it hadn't been for Pete that probably would've been it for you," Tony admitted. "Although if it hadn't been for Pete then the whole basis for the argument wouldn't've happened in the first place, but anyway… I don't have a lot of experience with relationships, Steve. I'm pretty sure my longest one before you was maybe only a few weeks, and that was so long ago that I hardly remember it. My mom and dad barely spoke to each other once Howard got released from prison, and—and I guess once I got a bit older I just figured it was too much work to try and constantly make someone else happy that I never bothered with it."
"That party that Peter was invited to today. Didn't you say the girl's father works for Damage Control?"
shoulder bump from Clint. "If it will bring Wanda and the others back, we must do it."
"Uh huh," Peter said, attempting a smile. "He told me something about a belated birthday party at the lake."
"Yeah. But gods, Pete, almost seventy years of ruffled feathers is gonna take a pretty long time to soothe, and—" He broke off, unable to finish his sentence.
"Good," stated Uncle Thor. "Let's kill him properly this time."
“Yes, Mr Stark,” Pepper said after a short pause.  “I’ll get right on it.”
"Uhh, it's time? Time for what?" Peter asked, confused. "What happened to my dad, is he dead? Did Thanos snap his fingers?"
"First satellite is away!" Steve exclaimed as he sailed past it. "And it looks like it's working just fine!"
“Nevermind, J,” Tony said, waving a dismissive hand.  Because as much as he might’ve wished otherwise, there really was no good explanation for what he was doing, other than he was actually following his heart for the first time since before Peter was born.
"Yes, I do. I'd appreciate it, though." Steve dipped his head, brushing his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss. "Be careful, please."
Tony sniffed, shooting Captain Wilson a brief smile. "Copy that."
"Yep, he did, so we're all good here," said Natasha. "We'll see all of you guys this weekend."
The sight of that hateful symbol stretched across his own chest would've been enough to make him vomit, if he'd actually had anything in his stomach.
"Afternoon, JARVIS," Tony said as he grabbed Peter's satellite diagram and leaned back in his chair, tapping his chin. He was so tempted to just forget the whole thing. To just go forward with his original idea for the weapons system and hope that maybe someday down the line they could convince General O'Brien to see reason.
"To us," he said as he clinked his glass against Tony's, so sincerely that Tony could only nod as he took his sip, literally at a loss for words. After Peter was born Tony had gone on a handful of dates, none of which ever led anywhere, but then once Peter was diagnosed with his heart problem Tony immediately threw all of his energy into making sure that Peter stayed as healthy as possible, leaving very little time for anything else.
Tony's two boys. The two people he loved most in the entire world.
As soon as the last message was done Tony slumped into his chair, groaning as he poked at the ON button on the ancient computer workstation that took up over half of his desk space. He had only received it about a couple of weeks ago, after having put in the request for it—
"I wouldn't think so," Steve said. "But then again, I'm not sure exactly how they could get him to talk without resorting to some form of torture, which I highly doubt the FBI would sanction. Or, at least I hope they wouldn't sanction it."
"I'd say," Steve could only agree.
“In another life, Steve, I don’t think I’d mind. And you’ve made it through my Heat without touching me, which is only…”
“So, finally, you’re rejecting me now that you know how badly I want you?”
"I have so much to tell you."
"Ah, this isn't just a green tan, Thor. I'm both Banner and the Hulk now, in one. Actually, it's all thanks to you. You told me we were just the same, I just needed some time to accept it."
“I don’t like it. I know we owe it to everyone and ourselves to try, but... when Wanda mind-fucked me all those years ago, I saw everyone dead.”
But he did. And Steve wanted to stop him, but somehow he got sucked into it because Tony started off by pushing him into the bed without a word, settling on Steve's lap, and not only kissing him, undressing them both but... he was acting so vulnerable but still trusting with Steve, that Steve couldn’t hurt him by putting a stop to it.
Tony himself didn't even check the documents, assuming he was familiar with its contents. And perhaps Rhodey and Pepper truly treated him differently after, or perhaps they just wanted to leave him some space after the "traumatic experience", or even possibly away because Tony himself had distanced himself first from them, but nothing was the same.
"Oh, because you'd rather eat something else?"
"That's... unlike you," Steve couldn't even guess why Thor would choose to tell him now.
"I can do most of what he does," Rocket shrugged. "And if it's more of a biological matter, my teammate, Mantis can probably turn his mind back. You'll just have to get him."
"If I may," Yondu said while he pretended to be immersed in the paper he was reading. "If a pretty girl like her asks you to prom, I can lend you some clothes."
"I want you to do all of them," Fury holds out a hand. "Deal?"
It was uncommon, but sometimes similar meanings could morph into one another, and Tony supposed that the hidden "death" wasn't exactly far from "war", and maybe "merchant" was further away from tinkering like Tony liked to do, therefore the new "machine", which was freshly on his wrist, yet still invisible to the naked eye.
"Why wouldn't I?"
"I'll go with you to see her," he then manages to pull himself out of his head if only to kiss Steve now. "She must be amazing."
"I thought you were... you've just said..." Loki tried to say but was so weak that a coughing fit interrupted whatever he could say.
"No."
"I was never a mind reader either."
"Do you have a passageway between planets now, Captain?"
"No, you fucking aren't! I took you in because you saved my life," the good Captain lifted him as if he weighed nothing, and not only carried him back to bed but also basically tore Loki's clothing off. With such a fervor that the demigod first thought he went too far, and his teasing would become a reality, but then the Captain was pulling the covers over him next, still furious, but wanting nothing from Loki. "But I didn't sign up to be ridiculed in the return, so you have a choice to make."
"Maybe from the military, but not from me. You were always so popular with girls-"
"Explain everything and we shall see, right?"
Finally, when it was done, not only Loki's magic was completely depleted, but he didn't even have the strength to stand. It must have been the zeal of the battle that kept him going, but now that was gone, he literary collapsed.
If the humans knew what he was doing, even if Thor suspected, Loki was sure none of them would have greeted Loki as an Avenger now, working with them. Then even cheering when Tony told everyone they were a couple.
"I want to run away with my boyfriend, but I can't do it without a car," Quill insisted. "
And it worked, but when the devastation of New York started, Loki didn't feel any better, just loss.
"Yes, Bucky might have mentioned you have something to say to me."
"I'll be there in a minute," Thor told him, but he was intently looking at Steve.
Not so much though that Stephen wouldn't say.
He did go straight home from the magician's temple, and hacked himself back into his workshop, updating Friday about what happened while actively avoiding everyone else for now, but it was little to no help.
"I wouldn't have made the bet if I also didn't think it was the best for you and the demigod."
He didn't realize how much time had passed because unlike the others, Barnes didn't talk too much to annoy him, letting him work, sitting as patiently as a rock, watching
In a way, when Thor went to sleep on Hulk's chest that night, he felt sorry for his green teammate. Maybe even thought how he'd miss Hulk.
"Friends? I thought you were just your colleagues."
"If not, then... you did something even worse," Wong realized. "Couldn't stop at meddling with Time, you had to add Reality to the list?"
"So you're saying that hurts me?" Steve's now wondering.
And that got Loki what he wanted - surprise! wait, it wasn't - except that now Bruce not only stopped smiling but seemed tired if not fed up with the whole magic lesson, and his progress slowed.
"I begin to think you wished I was," Bucky said, because he hadn't seen Tony for weeks, and this was the first sentence he chose to open with? "Steve, aren't you supposed to be at work?"
But Hulk was free to walk the place and from his shoulder's Thor had a good view of where they were going and could try to memorize the layout faster than on his own.
Steve was relying on his missions and friends rather than to face that, but Sam and Bucky were both gone, and his superhero life as well. What was there left to save, when they were needed and had failed?
“I think you’re worse. But I can help-”
"My mistake," she shrugged, with a face that said she wasn't convinced. "I'd known him for a very long time, and I knew right away you were gay..."
"We can try that as well," Steve seemed calmer then, giving Bucky a smile. "Do you wanna go first?"
Like he had a part of him that was JARVIS.
"Nothing much yet, but don't give me ideas," and instead of intimidated, he seemed to be in a challenging mood, but two could play that game.
"But I realized I had to show you what you were missing out on," Steve added with a smile, making Loki smile back. "And anyway, you love me. It's only common knowledge now."
"Did you call somebody to do my wall, or was it you?"
"We've seen that actually," the boy told him. "There was a big fight and he-"
“I hope the pups will take after you. You’re extraordinary - as always,” Steve told him, as often as he could, hoping that if Tony heard it enough from him, one day he’ll believe it.
Rhodey just gave him a look, "What do you think?"
Which, in turn, made Steve lift him to the desk, and not only step between the mechanic's legs, flushing their bodies close together, but also let his hands roam, exploring, making Tony groan into their mouth, but then pull away only a little bit later.
"I had the inkling that they might be," Strange told him when another mortal appeared. "Ah, Wong! Good timing, I need your help with-"
"Maybe this will teach you some manners," Loki smiled, then turned to Thor. "I'm ready to go, brother."
," Tony seemed amicable now that he was leaving, only to have the reinforced metal door shut on his face before he could leave. "Friday, can you explain what is going on with this door?"
"How awful it is, when people care about you," Steve said in a similar manner.
"Maybe we could try." It was like him cooking for Wanda when he couldn't eat.
"Did you come to kill me?"
"It's too late."
Woke up in the nurse’s office still breathing while none of his body parts seemed to be broken - a miracle - but when he tried to sit up looking for his comics, he could only collapse back to the bed. That’s was only when he noticed Rocket and Groot were there.
"Friday, wasn't the Mary Poppins protocol designed for Nat and Clint?" Bucky might have not been a computer whiz, but he was secretly more curious watching Tony work when he was sure he'd go unnoticed than any Fringe episode, and remembered quite well Tony's tries to implement it.
"I was talking about the kittens," he said, unfazed. "With their tiny little claws."
"Actually, I think you'll find that this is New York. Nobody remembers, cares, and/or isn't too busy constantly being on their phone."
"But if I had requested it?"
Once he wasn’t kidnapping Tony against his will, Steve turned out to be quite charming. When Tony felt a bit better - usually after a small nap, though he couldn’t sleep more than half an hour now because of the pain - they would play guessing games. When he was worse, Steve told him stories about his past and all the Omegas he rescued, and it was a comfort.
"And one more thing. If we're to do this... I love Miek and Korg just as much the next guy, but do you think they could find another dwelling so we didn't have to be roomies with them?"
"I'll pretend you didn't just say that," Bruce could hardly speak, he was so upset. "I can't...I'm not interested, Thor, so..."
"Next time, exclude me," Stark was furious. But also, while yelling, he forgot about his breathing, and now the magic was retreating. "I'm not in the business of..."
"If you want to explain to them how you got to this predicament despite being a man, be my guest. If not, I'm all you got. And Wong, if he is ever back from his lunch break."
Was it surprising that the righteous hero of America only came with conditions like this? No. But Loki could still headbutt the Captain in frustration - just in the hopes of knocking some sense into him.
"Not that's any of your business, but your annoying little planet grew on me, and now I have a pretty good reason to try to keep it safe," Loki told him, but Stark attacked nevertheless.
"There's only one way to find out. And even if not, I'm sure Rocket would appreciate it."
"Then threw me out on a window-"
“I think he’s not only you but the real you. And for the record, I kinda like him better.”
And when they got back to Steve's quarters, and Loki was still clawing the door, trying to activate the motion sensors to get to Thor and stab him in a bigger knife this time maybe, Steve told him.
Bucky wouldn't have put it behind Steve to try to seduce him only because of pity, trying to heroically help out a friend selflessly no matter what, but this attraction didn't seem to be forced or faked.
"Tell us then," Bucky turned off the heat under the pans that were ready. "It won't matter if she figured out, if we know anyway, right?"
"And now you know I haven't been lying to you and the Grandmaster is dangerous," Loki added. "So, you need to do exactly as I say."
This was why Loki never held her or tried to visit, even if he could sneak into the Sanctum probably(?) unseen. He knew it was for the best if she never knew about him, but he'd be too sentimental to abandon her then, and just hearing this, he was tempted to tell her everything was going to be okay.
Phil might blush deeply then, thinking the Coach somehow noticed his improper behavior around Rogers, and Fury no doubt notices that, but he says something else.
"Well, I do now," Steve frowned, and Bucky tried to move him from the door and just leave, but he wouldn't stand down. "How many times did you lie to me? How can I trust you? Maybe you secretly ogled me in the showers as well."
It was everything Loki wanted, given the circumstances, and therefore suspicious.
"What?"
“What I needed to, Tony.”
"Not as much as I missed you. And I love you oh so very much, but we can't have this. Not just yet. Maybe in the future, given this vision? But now... don't make our departure any harder than it already is."
And she was right. She had her mark burnt off when she was just a baby, never having a chance to try to find her "other half".
"Why should I?" there was even less chance of Quill taking the device after that threat. "So that you could report to the teachers that I stole it?"
"I thought you said you almost destroyed the Tower several times," Strange kindly reminded him. "And besides, what else would you do?"
"I love it, but I also can't. I've been discharged, remember? And surely, some people are more capable to fly this suit, and not just one either," Rhodey said.
"How can I call on the green monster?" he asked Bruce, noting how his body looked different when Banner was slouching in it.
So he went with a cat as a disguise, and not only because he knew more about the creatures now, thanks to a page called Youtube and all the cat videos on it. He could climb up to the window of the room Steve was kept in, and get in without a problem.
"I assumed I can stay here for tonight."
Maybe because Loki wasn't the average person with average problems, but neither was Bruce, and yet? Somehow it still worked. Maybe even better than Loki would have expected.
And that was all it took for the insensitive Tony to be back, and his hundred walls were drawn up once again. It's been such a long time since he was like that with Steve that Steve had all but forgotten how easily he could slip into that role.
Which turned out to be a mistake, because it got Levi sulking, and unfortunately that meant he didn't let them get close to each other for that night, getting between them the worst times, but that cloak-mood didn't last.
"What the hell did you do to me?"
But then, only a couple of days later, Steve told him he made popcorn for a movie night and went back to their previous normal so effortlessly Bucky started to question their fallout ever really happened.
"No it doesn't, and even if you jumped, you'd survived the fall, and I sure as hell won't hurt you," Rocket said. He had enough of losing people, he wasn't capable of accepting it - even if he never really got along with big, red, so stupidly heroic robot.
"I already guessed that. But what I'm yet to figure out why do you consider yourself so dangerous."
"Gosh, sorry, not you, you're the best, helping out both Fury and us when you don't need the extra credit," Steve quickly starts explaining now.
"What have you done? I told you I made my peace with dying."
"I didn't think I kissed this bad," Steve was told by Nat he could use practice, but he was never drawn to her like that, so he didn't think he sucked
"I have been in love with Steve since forever, but waited 70 years for him to catch up," Bucky looked into Steve's eyes. "And even if he never saw me that way I would have been okay with that."
"Okay, I take it back. If you want to impress me, it's best if we don't talk, just have sex. Preferably in the dark."
So the weeks turn to months, and then, no matter how Phil would try, he also has to talk with Rogers about his social media presence. Given how he's the captain, and Coulson should have started with him in the first place, and by now basically talked with everyone else, it's not something he can put off any longer without an excuse.
"If she didn't confuse dancing and the occasional air-guitar solo with a stroke, you can," Bucky caught Steve looking at him questioningly after the "just to get me here" part, and felt more exposed suddenly between him and Tony without any clothes on, so he quickly got dressed while Tony was typing away on his StarkPhone, probably trying to see what could have gone wrong.
Put it on, and Snapped the army away, while bringing back all the Vanished. Then probably passed out for a bit, because the next thing he knew, he was in a hospital bed, with Banner irritatedly talking to him.
Loki devised like a hundred possible escape plans in just his first week there. And was about to leave truly after the first two, but then something unexpected happened.
And Loki rather thought of himself as a monster than accept the possibility that Odin might have never cared for him at all.
He also took a page from Tony's book and when they didn't see eye to eye about something (Steve would have been floored if there was anything important they could agree on), he just made a joke and moved on, rather than inviting an argument as they so often had in the past.
Tony stared in sheer awe, his heart pounding against his chest. Good lord, Steve just shot a man for him! It wasn’t the first time he’d done done it -- and it certainly wouldn’t be the last -- but damn, it never got old.
Steve’s eyes well up with tears and his hand trembles as he stares at the photo. As he stares, he sees not only the frozen moment in time, but seven years worth of memories. Beautiful, wonderful memories, all starting on this exact day, all starting with Tony.
He wasn’t sure how much exactly Steve knew about his past history with producing and designing weapons -- and the unfortunate aftermath of said weapons being used in practice. But the look Steve was giving suggested understanding and compassion, his face warm and illuminated by the low, warm light of the candle between them.
“Take you on and win,” Steve corrected, lifting the not so fearless leader of the crew up and restraining his arms behind his back. “Looks like your days of ‘wrecking’ have come to an end, partner. And nobody else move! I’ll be back for the rest of you.”
“Do you know anything about the cake in the fridge?” Steve inquires.
“Well I’ll be damned, you remembered!” Steve looked Tony over, a confused look on his face. “At least I
“Fine,” Tony concedes and he pulls back, looking Steve square in the eye. “When were you planning on telling me about
Tony gulped, shutting his eyes and helplessly bracing for the shot.
“Sometimes?” Tony says, a dubious look on his face.
“You sure about that?” Steve asked, and in the blink of an eye, he was on his feet and grabbed the barrel of the robber’s gun. He snatched it, flipping it over in his palm and aiming it at the robber's head.
So much for making it to pie. Or even to soup.
“I love you too, favorite patient.”
But Tony, despite his dismaying words, sure is sending some pretty mixed signals.
Still, he obliged to their demands, raising his hands above his head. Steve did the same, but not without a stubborn scowl on his face and a curious look in his eye. Tony knew that look well; he was plotting something.
After fussing with his appearance for a good hour or so, he headed down to the restaurant. He caught sight of Steve as he approached, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. Upon seeing Tony, Steve stood upright and grinned.
And more importantly, Tony knows it too. He snorts loudly and smirks up at Steve. “Sap.” The warmth then abruptly drains out of Tony’s expression and he bites down on his lower lip. “You mean it, right? You’ll always come home? That’s a promise?”
Steve sighs, sliding Tony’s hand off his side. “It’s just a tiny little cut, honey. I get them all the time on missions! And you know they heal fast thanks to the serum. It was way bigger yesterday.”
Jarvis nods. “Yes, I make it every year for Mr. Stark and, uh, you.” He looks at Steve dubiously. “Are you alright, Captain? You’re acting like this is the first time you’re learning of this.”
“What about it?” Steve asks, blinking down at the tiny, barely even visible wound. He forgot it was even there until this moment, and he wonders how Tony even knows about it in the first place. Then again, Tony always knows everything and anything, so really, he shouldn't be surprised.
Tony smiles, big and bright. He laces their fingers together, the two wedding bands brushing up against one another. “I’m holding you to that.”
“Well, are you going to tell me why you’re mad at me?”
?” He yanks up Steve’s t-shirt and points at the new scar on his side.
“What about it?” Tony repeats, glaring at Steve as if he just said the most ludicrous sentence imaginable. “You come home with a massive scar and you don’t think that’s something you should tell me about? I’m a doctor!”
Standing outside his window was Sheriff Rogers --
is where all the money is?” He turned to his cohort in the red mask. “I thought you scoped the place out!”
Aiming their guns, they both fired countless shots at him. Glass shattered and bullets bounced off the walls, but none landing on their intended target. Steve boldly -- and somewhat stupidly -- charged right at them, in true Sheriff Rogers fashion. He swiftly dodged each bullet that came his way, and once in a close enough range, he aimed not for their heads but for their knees, landing both shots with only two bullets. An amateur slinger, he was not.
It’s not his birthday — that’s still four months away — nor is it near any of the other Avengers’ birthdays. The next one is Hank’s, and while the two of them were good friends, Steve sincerely doubts that Hank wants a cake based on his likeness. So not that.
Tony huffed. “Well that’s hardly fair, seeing as I came as promised for you. So the
“Looking for something, Captain?” Jarvis asks as he enters the kitchen, carrying assorted dishes to the sink.
Tony had wanted to stay and wait up for Steve, but the chef, understandably so, insisted that they vacate the space and company of three notorious bandits. And really, Tony couldn’t argue with that.
A part of Tony desperately wanted to say ‘no’ and run off, save himself from any inevitable embarrassment, but he nodded and reluctantly stepped inside.
“Uh, no, just thirsty.” Steve reaches for the carton of milk that he’d been after in the first place. He pours a glass and returns the carton once he’s done, eying that mysterious cake again. “Jarvis, can I ask you kind of a strange question?”
Steve inhaled deeply. “Alright, fine, fair is fair. But just a quick one, and don’t you go tellin’ no one about this, ya hear?”
“Tony, none of your doctorates are in medical fields.”
Hopefully, Steve will never have to hear that terrible, ugly sentence -- "I'm mad at you, Steve" --
Tony shrugged his shoulders as much as the barracks would allow. “Lost my footing and fell into it.”
Steve chuckles before he leans in and kisses him, soft and sweet. He feels light and blissful, and really, how could he not be?
Unfortunately, that same old-fashioned wall clock was now telling Tony that he needed to leave in about five minutes so he could pick up Peter from school, and he had absolutely no earthly clue what he was going to tell him.  There was no way he could hide what he knew.  Peter was far too perceptive, and had always had the uncanny ability to read Tony like a book with just one glance.  He was also missing his papa badly, and in the past few days had taken to asking Tony almost every hour on the hour if there had been any news from him.
"Holy
Shrugging, Gwen popped another apple into her mouth, chewing it slowly. "It's not that my dad doesn't like the company or anything. I mean, his own officers use a lot of Stark Industries equipment, and I know your father sells it to them at very reasonable prices, probably lower than he should, really. It's just…"
All of which had been easy since there hadn't been any issues with the X-302s. In fact, they were performing so well that Tony was finding it more and more difficult to keep from repeatedly pointing it out to Phillips, just in case the old grizzled colonel hadn't noticed for himself. The brand-new arc reactor power sources were functioning even better than Tony had predicted, and judging from the near-constant banter from the pilots, they were all having the time of their lives.
Another gunshot flashed from deep inside just as Steve regained his footing, passing so closely to his nose that he felt the heat coming off the bullet as it zoomed by.
"I'm fine, Papa. It's hopefully not gonna take that long anyway," Peter said, only a bit impatiently. Steve could tell that he was nervous, with his bouncing legs and his long fingers pleating and unpleating the blankets, and also that he was otherwise trying really hard to hide it.
"Yeah. Might wanna have Happy on standby too, just in case," added Tony.
"Oh, 'cause no one's ever gotta lean around your head, right?" Bucky said, smirking as he tapped his datapad to life. "You seen the instructor yet?"
"I know, Dad," Peter said, rather impatiently. He had just thought of something, a solution to one of the programming roadblocks he'd come up against, and he wanted to get it written down before his nurse came in to check on him again.
"Leave it to Stevie to show us all how it's done," said Barnes. "Approaching my go/no-go in five… four… three… two… one… mark."
"Is that all, Captain?" he asked a few seconds later.
“So… all Strucker and his goons would need is a power source like the arc reactor to activate it?” Steve asks.  “And then they could transport themselves wherever they want?”
“Uhh, yes?” said Pepper.  “Yes, of course I can, Mr Stark.  I’m just… wow.  I—I just… I just never thought that—”
"Steve? C'mon, honey, talk to me!" Tony said frantically, patting Steve's cheek as his helmet retracted. He quickly brushed Steve's sopping wet hair from his eyes before draping his upper body over his arm, pounding his palm against Steve's back. Steve sputtered with each blow, finally coughing up at least two litres of water. "That's it, honey, I've got you. Get it all out."
Peter wasn't there anymore.
Or owning a bookstore, for that matter.
"He pointed it at your chest?" Tony asked, pointing to where his arc reactor used to be. "Like, right here?"
"Mmm, okay," Peter muttered as he pretended to study the board. "But what if we don't? Then what?"
Tony huffed as he picked up his coffee cup, downing the rest of the lukewarm liquid as Peter stood his ground. The boy was just too damn smart for his own good most of the time.
which then quickly morphed into a pretty suspicious
Tony grinned as he opened his arms, his heart fluttering when Peter stepped right into them.  His boy may be growing up, but Tony was beyond grateful that he hadn’t yet outgrown his love of hugs.
"Ten minutes to blackout."
Steve smiled, leaning over to peck Tony's lips. "Isn't that what I have you for?"
"Yeah, she's gonna be at Oxford all next summer," Peter blurted out. "She's got an interview for a physics internship there coming up next month."
"Okay, but if that is the case, then we really have no idea of what we'd be heading into," said Sam. "Without a clear view of the target, there's no way we'd know what kind of resistance they've got or even the size of the building. We could be heading straight into an ambush."
a few hours ago, so don't you try and tell me that you're just fine all of a sudden, because there's no way in hell that's possible!"
"Well, then we shouldn't keep the lady waiting," Steve said as he headed for the door, breathing in an extra deep breath once they were back outside on the sidewalk. He kept his hand on Peter's shoulder as they crossed the street, finding Gwen waiting for them with her father just inside the lobby of the station. Steve had to hide his grin at the look on Gwen's face when she saw Peter, and realised what he was carrying, something that didn't escape Chief Stacy's notice either.
The entire panic room was instantly filled with a nearly blinding yellowish light as the sceptre activated, the Winter Soldier shining it directly in Image Peter's face. Steve flinched as Image Peter let out a horrible, bloodcurdling scream, his back arching up off the table.
smiles. He tentatively reached for her hand, his breath hitching when her fingers curled around his, ignoring the amused snort that Uncle Clint shot their way a second later. Gwen's hands were so soft, nothing like his own which were drier and more calloused from working in shop and chemistry and in Dad's lab at home. Peter had suffered from pretty bad eczema as a little boy, and while he hadn't had to worry about that since his enhancements started to emerge, he still doubted that he'd ever be able to get his skin as baby-soft as Gwen's.
Pursing his lips, Steve knocked on the door, smiling when he heard Peter's weak, "Come in."
"I wish I could've too," Peter murmured. "You told me he was in the military, right? Until he got hurt?"
"Have either of you ever heard of the Quantum Realm?"
"Yeah, I'll be there."
Steve needed to think, and to plan. He needed to figure out a way to keep attacks like this from ever happening again, and he couldn't do that if his focus was even more splintered than it already was.
he thought bitterly.
"Well, thank God we're not still back in your day, babe, 'cause Pete's not getting serious about a girl or boy or anyone else until he's at least twenty-five. I won't be ready for it before then."
"Yeah, babe," Tony murmured, earning another comforting squeeze to his sore left trapezius muscle. If anyone could understand having to potentially sacrifice a few people for the sake of billions, it was Steve. He had been forced to make many such decisions during the war. Decisions that still haunted him, kept him up at night.
"Okay, fine," Peter said after a short pause. "But it's not like I don't already know what's going on. I don't need Grandpa to tell me anything 'cause I already know all of it."
"Well…" Once again Steve was at a loss for words, and it was more than a little unnerving. He'd never visited a kid before who wasn't immediately impressed with the fact that he was a pilot. Most of the time the kids' mouths dropped open as soon as they laid eyes on his uniform, but judging from Peter's attitude he was almost repulsed by it.
"No!" Tony yelped as he grabbed onto Steve's forearm, barely stifling another junky cough. "There is no way in
And he had
"What I'm about to tell you could end both my career and yours," he said. "And I'm not talking about the whole happy retirement-type end. I'm talking about a court-martial, going to prison-type end, do you understand me?
"Steve… baby, please move," Tony whimpered, rolling his hips up and causing Steve to gasp. He bent his head to gently kiss him and then propped himself up on his elbows, not breaking their eye contact as he started to move. His heart skittered at the sight of Tony beneath him, so incredibly beautiful with his glistening face twisted in ecstasy and his lower lip caught between his teeth, that Steve almost wished he could pause for a moment and sketch a picture, or even just snap a quick photograph so he could forever capture this image of his gorgeous husband. He had an entire sketchbook that he kept hidden away in his sock drawer that was filled with various drawings of Tony. Working in his lab, lounging on their bed, and many of the two of them just as they were now, naked, their bodies joined together. But he had yet to capture to his satisfaction the exact moment when Tony broke apart, the exact moment when he completely surrendered himself to Steve.
“Of course it is.” Steve takes Tony’s hand — the one with his wedding ring on it — and traces over the bright gold band delicately. “That’s a promise that I’ll always keep.”
Steve thanked the server and took his seat, frowning as he looked down at the table. “I think you gave us too much silverware, partner,” Steve said, staring at the utensils on his side as if they’d done something to offend him. “It’s only the two of us dining tonight.”
He was going to have dinner with Sheriff Rogers.
you remembered. We goin’ to a fancy ball or something?”
Or he could lock himself in the pillory, right in the middle of town, and further tarnish what was left of his fleeting reputation.
Upon realizing he’d been unarmed, the robber panicked and threw his hands up. “Don’t shoot, don’t shoot!”
Steve exhales a shaky breath. Only one way to find out what's wrong.
Steve mirrors back Tony’s smile with one of his own, his chest filling up with that distinct, soft and fuzzy feeling that only Tony can bring out of him, time and time again.
But Steve doesn’t think it’s ridiculous...even though, yeah, it kind of is. He’s a super-soldier for crying out loud, and he’s come home with far worse injuries than this. No, all Steve can think is how lucky he is to have someone in his life that cares so deeply about him. His beloved, sweet, and slightly melodramatic Tony.
with Sheriff Rogers.
Tony stood upright, rubbing at his now slightly reddened wrists. “I like to keep your days interestin’ in such a small uneventful town, Sheriff. Someone’s gotta!” He chirped, grinning up at Steve. “I suppose I owe you a proper thanks for always coming to my rescue like this. What say we get a drink to celebrate your noble heroism?”
“No, well, at least not until we have dessert. It’d be a shame to waste a perfectly good slice of pie.” Steve chuckled, his eyes locking onto Tony’s. “I’m glad you agreed to come out tonight, Tony. And I’m especially glad that I got to see this side of you, the ‘fancy’ one. He’s a nice feller, and I hope I get to see more of him.”
Had Tony not just downed an entire flask of whiskey, he might’ve been clever enough to choose the former.
For most people, this would be an easy feat, but Tony couldn’t recall the last time he’d been sober in public, nor could he remember the last time he’d been out for a proper meal with someone. God, it must’ve have been with Miss Potts during the war. Well over a decade ago. And now here he was about to do the two of them together -- with Steve! Has he ever been sober around Steve? He didn’t think so. What if he went and said something stupid or foolish? He couldn’t blame it on too much whiskey! And saying one wrong thing could cost him everything he had with Steve.
Tony jumps a little at the sound of Steve’s voice, his hands immediately sliding over to cover whatever he’d been writing. “Hi, Steve! Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you and Clint were going to do some combat practice in the gym?”
“No need to be embarrassed, Stark, you clean up nice,” Steve encouraged, turning to open the door to the restaurant. “Shall we?”
That leaves an anniversary. His breath stills and his eyes go wide. Oh god, did he forget? Panicking, he slams the fridge door shut and scans the calendar hanging on the front of it. He heaves out a relieved sigh when he sees the date — the tenth, aka,
As Tony watched Steve leave, the shock and fear dissipated, replaced with a feeling of sadness. He didn’t get it. He should be rejoicing. Steve had saved him! Steve had shot three men and knocked another out to defend him, risked his life to keep Tony safe. Yet, here was, lamenting the loss of the nicest evening he’d had in some time.
Inside the was practically empty, save for a server who was talking with the chef, and one table occupied by Carol Danvers and her feminists, seemingly celebrating whatever latest triumph they had over the chauvinistic males of the town. Carol didn’t seem to notice -- or didn’t care to notice -- Tony and Steve as they entered.
So…why cake?
Sighing, Tony looked over to the table across the way where their server was still hiding and shaking.
“Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are callin'...”
Not wanting to alarm poor Jarvis anymore, Steve feigns a smile. “Oh, right! The date must’ve snuck up on me. Do me a favor, don’t let Tony know about my little slip-up?”
“Come on, Tony, even if you’re not as ‘fancy’ as you used to be, I know you’re not as dumb as you let on. I reckon you’re the smartest feller this side of the Mississippi. Even if you do hit the bottle too hard for my likin',” Steve said earnestly, and Tony’s cheeks flushed red. “So tell me the truth -- why’d you
Is he missing something?
“Alright, a lot of the time,” Steve begrudgingly admits. “But it’s not like I’d ever do anything stupid enough to cost me my life. Wanna know why?”
Steve could easily stand in the doorway and watch the sight all day, completely content. He's sorely tempting to do so, but forces himself to step forward and enter. “Hey, Tones.”
“Happy March 10th, Tony.”
Steve leans in and kisses Tony, warm and sweet, and with seven years worth of love and passion in it. March 10th, 1971 may have just started, but Steve can hardly wait to kiss him like this again next year.
It had been close to two days since he last saw Sheriff Rogers. Desperate times called for desperate measures.
you can do is serenade me with a pretty little number.”
Steve’s prepared for a multitude of different reactions — tears, cussing, things being thrown at him. He’ll take it all, and deservedly so.
He was going to have dinner
XXXXX
“Don’t trust me not to order my own drink?” Tony asked, a smug grin on his face.
“Outed by the butler, classic.” Tony’s cheeks flush red and he looks down at his well-polished loafers. “I’m sorry, you probably think it’s strange that I celebrate this without you. And for seven years, too. I wanted to invite you, but there was the whole secret identity thing for awhile, and then I was worried you’d think it was super weird since we weren’t dating, so I was planning on telling you this yea-“
And whatever he’s writing is making him smile in a coy and cute fashion, like a lovestruck teenager doodling their crush’s name on a notebook. Steve loves when Tony smiles at him, but there’s something extra special about the way Tony smiles when he’s alone. Shields down and out of his armor, both the literal and the figurative.
“Oh?” Steve asks. “And what might that be?”
“How am I supposed to make it better if you don’t tell me what’s wrong, sweetheart?”
The lone server ceased his conversation and approached Tony and Steve, greeting them with a smile that was a little too enthusiastic. It was pretty common for the Atlas to go days without having a customer, so the man was probably elated to have not one table to serve, but two!
the first time he’s learning of this. And he still doesn’t even know what ‘it’ is.
“How was I supposed to know he’d be here?” Piledriver complained as Steve effortlessly took his gun out of his hand and picked up Wrecker’s, too. “And that he’d be crazy enough to take all four of us on by himself!”
“...oh Danny boy, I love you so,” Steve sang softly in Tony’s ear, concluding his little song. He rested his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling back to look at him. “Told you I’m nowhere near as good as you.”
The Atlas was the nicest restaurant in Timely. Granted, it was the only restaurant in Timely, so it didn’t exactly have competition. It was new, only added to the humble town a few years prior, created to meet the unexpected demand that came about when gold was discovered about fifty miles west. Timely, as a result, became a frequent stop for many looking to get rich quick. And with no real restaurant in town, one had to be added to meet the new need. While the gold and the rush to get to it had long since dried up, the Atlas remained. A shadow of its former heyday, but it was still there when the people of Timely were wanting a splurge or in need of a celebration.
, was what he thought to himself. “--uh, fancy.” Was what he went with instead.
It wasn’t one that he was certain he could keep, because he was still sipping his sarsaparilla and wishing it whiskey, but as he looked into those hopeful blue eyes, he found a desire even more worthwhile.
Steve shot Tony a dubious look, folding his arms against his chest. “...and you’ll leave the bottle
In the doorway of the restaurant were four masked men, all armed and with their guns pointed out. Anyone this side of the Mississippi knew who they were, thanks to countless wanted posters in the area — The Wrecking Crew. And they’d been quite busy ‘wrecking’ and robbing every city they visited. It was inevitable that they’d find their way to Timely sooner than later.
Finishing up his milk, he thanks Jarvis and slips out of the kitchen, swiftly making his way down to Tony’s office. True to Jarvis’ word, the door is open, but Steve doesn’t immediately enter. He lingers in the hallway, concealed by the dark shadows which allow him to watch his boyfriend for a moment.
"It's you, it's you must go and I must bide."
of nasty names — but maybe that had to do with the person saying it and the underlying hurt in the way he said it.
One that he’s been keeping for three years, seven months, and twenty-three days so far. But who’s counting?
“No, thank you, I couldn’t possibly cut the cake without Tony,” Steve declines. “Speaking of which, have you seen him?”
The server’s eyes widened and he blinked slowly. “I...couldn’t have explained it better myself.” It was almost like he couldn’t fathom the town drunk knowing so much about formal table settings. Or even just the fact that Tony was capable of speaking in a coherent, non-slurred fashion. He cleared his throat, regaining his composure as he briefly described of what today’s special would be; Tony and Steve both agreed to it.
“Really?” Steve asked, sitting more upright. “You do it just for my attention? I…didn’t think I was worth such a fuss.”
Tony doesn’t answer, but he does raise an inquisitive eyebrow at him. Steve decides to take that a ‘yes’.
It’s a sickeningly sweet, corny line that sounds like it came out of a bad Hollywood romcom. But the thing is, it’s true. It’s always true, and it always works on Tony. Steve knows this.
Steve frowns. He opens his mouth to speak, but Tony hands over what he’s been hiding — what he’d been smiling at — before Steve can get a word out. It’s a folded piece of paper with Steve’s name on it.
Tony sighed; he wanted to lie, but even the idea of doing so just felt wrong. Not with how Steve was wearing his heart on his sleeve. Not with how Steve wanted him just like this -- open, ‘fancy’, and most of all, honest. He hadn’t been any of the three in so long, and here he was trying to do it all at once. It was a tall order, but for Steve, he was willing to try. For the first time since god knows when, he
lock yourself up today?”
“You do know that can be considered abuse of the Sheriff’s protection, don’t you?” Steve chastised.
"Mad?” He asks, trying to keep his voice as even and neutral as possible. “How could you possibly be mad at me when I wasn't even here? There were no boots left in the middle of the bedroom for you to trip over!”
The darkest eight and a half minutes of his life (or at least his week) are over, the world is spinning once again, and all is as it should be. Because Tony isn't upset anymore.
“Mr. Stark is in his office,” Jarvis says. “The door is open, so I’m sure company would be welcomed, especially on such a special day.”
Tony scoffed. “I’d hardly call this a change for the better. Do you not recall how I locked myself in the pillory this afternoon?”
He heaved out a heavy sigh, burrowing his face into his pillow. How would it sound, he wondered to himself, closing his eyes and trying to envision it.
“No, no, I mean it. No more cuddles until you tell me what’s wrong,” Steve says with a touch more finality in his voice. He makes a move as if he’s going to get off the bed, but Tony grabs him by the waist before he can.
“You got hurt, Steve, that’s a very big deal!” Tony’s voice cracks a little as he speaks, a sharpness in his tone that’s undeniable. It's not coming from a place of bitterness, but one of genuine hurt. This is not just a case of his husband overreacting -- Tony truly is upset about this.
It was just the two of them.
There’s a cake in the fridge. It’s beautiful, at least three layers high, and with an intricate red, white, and blue frosting pattern that perfectly emulates a certain shield. It’s very obvious that it’s for Steve. But why?
He turns around, gripping Tony’s chin and tilting it upward. “I’m sorry,” Steve says sincerely, looking at Tony with apologetic eyes. “I should have been more careful. Sometimes, I can be reckless and stupid--”
some answers.
“War changes a lot of people. Sometimes for better, sometimes for worse,” Steve said softly. “I'm just please it changed you for the better.”
Tony mirrored Steve’s bewildered expression. He looked down at his own suit and then at Steve, who was clad in his usual vest and old pants combination. “I dressed for dinner, isn’t that what we’re doing here?”
to be perfect.
If Tony truly is mad at him, he's got a weird way of showing it.
Tony pulled back, looking up at Steve with a knowing smirk. “Oh? Well, why don’t you show me what you got, partner.”
Wrecker growled, turning to his last standing lackey. “What are you waiting for? Let’s get him already!”
“You have my word,” Tony blurted out before his drunken brain could properly properly register what he’d promised.
“I’m mad at you, Steve.”
“Hey, it’s alright, it’s—“ Tony pauses. “—wait, how did you know I’ve been celebrating this day every year?”
Steve’s brows knit together. “Anniversary cake?”
“...I think you’ve had
Now it was Tony’s turn to blush. His cheeks turned crimson and his lips curled into a small smile. “Stick around long enough and you just might,” Tony said, sounding assured and confident, like he was making a promise.
“Yeah, and the competition is still pretty steep,” Tony jokes, visibly trying -- and failing -- to hold in a giggle. “And if you wanna stay the favorite, you better make sure you follow my treatment plan.”
Tony heard the gunshot, but strangely enough he felt no pain. He didn’t feel anything at all. Opening his eyes, Tony looked up to see a small stream of smoke coming from Steve’s gun and the robber clutching his now bloody hand, his own gun on the floor by Steve’s feet.
“No.”
“For cryin’ out loud, Thunderball, get up!” Wrecker ordered. “And Bulldozer, you coward, get your damn gun back from this amateur slinger!”
"From glen to glen, and down the mountain side."
Steve snorted and shook his head. “Trust me, if I start yammerin’ with these ol’ pipes, people’ll think they slaughter the animals here, too.”
“Ah, you mean the anniversary cake!” Jarvis looks past Steve and into the fridge. “Yes, I baked it this morning. Red velvet, cream-cheese frosting, and a touch of food coloring for aesthetics. Would you like me to cut you a slice?”
“Now there’s an idea!” Tony exclaimed. “How’s about I take you out for a nice dinner? Tonight if you’ve got the time! And I can't get into any trouble if you're there to stop me!”
Tony blushed, taking off his top hat and hiding it behind his back. So much for off to a good start.
“Alright, looks like we’ve got ourselves a deal,” Steve said, grinning a little. “How's about sundown at the Atlas, then?”
“Sundown at the Atlas it is!” Tony reached into his inner pocket and procured his flask. Steve shot him a disapproving look. “...It’s not sundown yet.” He brought it to his lips, frowning when nothing came out. “And as luck would have it, it’s empty. How disappointing.”
“I was feeling benevolent this morning, what can I say?” Steve moves closer and tries to catch a glance at what Tony’s hiding. “What are you working on?”
What he’s not prepared for is Tony to smile at him, sweetly, and with a look of sheer adoration in his eye. “You’re far too humble, you know that? If I had a second birthday, aka, another excuse for presents and everyone to fawn over me, I’d take full advantage of it.”
again.
“Sorry?” Tony asks, sounding confused. “For what?”
“Like we even can move!” Thunderball complained as he clutched his bloody hand, Bulldozer still lying unconscious beside him.
“Already did. But it’s Clint, meaning I had him pinned in a whopping five minutes,” Steve says, chuckling.
“I saw the cake in the fridge.” Steve wipes away the few years in his eyes, his lips curling up into a fond smile. “And I asked Jarvis, and he told me that he makes one for you every year.”
“Because if I do die, then I can’t come home to you,” Steve says with a smile. “And you’re always worth coming home to.”
Tony sat upright, blinking slowly a few times and looking to his window. Could it be?
He’s still cuddling up against Steve, still clinging with that iron grip of his -- if anything, he’s holding on tighter than he was before -- and he’s still pressing sweet, loving kisses to his neck.
“Happy anniversary, Winghead," Tony says softly against his ear.
He hears Tony stand up and walk around his desk, and then he feels Tony's lanky arms slide around him in an intimate embrace.
Tony breathed out a laugh. “Hey now, this time you came on your own accord.” He tightened his hold around Steve’s frame, nestling his face against his shoulder. “Any chance I can convince you to sing another song for me?”
And just like the shiny star pinned to his vest, he wore it well.
“Fancy, huh?” Steve said, raising a brow. “And what made you stop being so ‘fancy’?”
“Not mad at me anymore, right?” Steve eventually asks after a comfortable, serene silence. It’s probably a stupid question, but he wants to be sure. Tony being mad at him, even when it's over trivial things, is a serious manner!
"It can wait, Tony," Steve said, but seeing Tony's expression, he added. "But I agree, there's also something I want to tell you."
(For any Omega who didn’t have a bondmate by the age of 20, the Omega hormones were detrimental, and Tony had been living with that reality, so he had a heart condition, and the illegal contraceptive drugs Obi made him take only worsened it.)
And at first, Steve didn't think he'd do it in a million years, but then somehow, years later, when Earth was barely managing the chaos of the aftermath of the Blip, and Thor bought news with the Guardians that something worse is coming, Steve did want to fight.
Some already start, but Rogers notes.
But by then, Loki had no mind to object for Tony's sake. He wanted the engineer, even if it was a horrible act for Loki to use Stark's messed up feelings like that. Loki wanted him since the first time they've met, and by then he couldn't bear to stop a very willing Tony, not anymore.
"Bruce, it was-"
"Then just tell her. It doesn't have to be complicated and a long confession or apology, but at least convey the facts that she has a right to know. Just say the words. That's how you should have told me too, so I wouldn't have to figure out later."
"Did you want me to agree or disagree with that? I can't tell," Steve joked, pretending to be.
