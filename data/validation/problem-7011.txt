It would be on the same lines as the Extremis project, but smarter. He’s at the wheel of it so it’ll be more elegant and engineered than Hansen or Killian could ever have dreamed. Frantically scribbling on the board, he begins to outlay plans for the adjustments and facilities he’d need to synthesise it. If he could inject himself with this technology, his suit would be him, one and the same. All it would take was a series of synapses controlled by a single thought and his suit would be there, ready to rebuild and adapt on the fly. The suit could rebuild itself
It takes him a while to process what the Wizard had implied. Like every apocalypse movie he’s ever seen, it’s rarely the threat itself that brings humanity to it’s knees – it’s human beings themselves, rabid dogs turning on one another until there’s nothing human left at all. Still, there might be pockets of people who believe in the Avengers. All it takes is a little faith.
Tony doesn’t realise he’s crying, his calloused hands pawing at his face uselessly. Thor has changed a lot since he’d last seen him – more than physically – he was more humble, open to others in ways he’s never seen in a God. He’s got a shared pain… Perhaps Loki is dead too. And Tony has got to stop empathising with psychopaths because, damnit, his eyes sting at the thought of Loki dying for real.
“Me and Dummy agreed it would be beneficial for you to have a good sleep, before you stumble blindly down this destructive path.”
Ghost hesitates, “Naturally, would you at least let me check that my connection to the nanobots is stable?”
Steve almost dares to hope, to believe that Tony can do it. He’s brilliant, amazing, but the thought of trying to fix this mess on his own will kill Tony. Tony’s greatest enemy has always been himself, everybody who got to know him learned that.
He takes a deep breath of Earth’s air. It’s familiar and different all at once. It’s cleaner than on Titan, with hints of Nitrogen and smog. There’s something new too, heavy and bitter on his tongue.
“Hey, hey kid,” He flicks his sunglasses down his nose, pulling Harley round by the shoulders to face him, “It’s me, the Mechanic, remember?”
However, he’s fought in battles, threw himself in front of targets to save others. Became a superhero. Hell, he even took the hardest pitch when Thanos threw a moon at him for fucksake. How much closer to the line does he have to be? He and Steve disagreed on a lot of things. Tony’s attitude, his lack of teamwork, his tendency to do something without going through the chain of command. Whether it was the journey on what had been a pleasant day of blissful ignorance, or the whole moon thing, or surviving the apocalypse entirely… He’s long past caring what other people think of him; anything else he can make up for in quick wit.
This pattern continued until time was merely constructed by his successes and failures. He’s got bruises on top of bruises, a lump on his elbow, his feet don’t feel attached to his body and frankly he’s not sure if he could handle the full body version of this.
. Steve knew that he should have called sooner; two years on the run had been hell. He was grateful for Sam and Nat because without them, he may have lost the will entirely. And then there was Bucky. He chokes on his inhale at the thought of his best friend. He’d lost him so many times, but like a bungee he’d somehow always managed to drag him back to his side. Until Wakanda. Until Thanos. Until Tony dove head first into another alien spaceship with absolutely no thought to his
. Anyone else would be grateful, glad to be on their own turf. He felt the crushing force of gravity, those 3.5 billion lives pressing against his skull.
Hearing the rustle of her fabric as she turns, Steve looks over his shoulder to Natasha. Her shoulders slump and she lets out a breath.
“I panicked, I thought you guys weren’t friends after the big fight thing.” Harley turns his back, looking at the screen with a very confused and disgruntled Steve on the other side. He picks up the old faceplate from the armour that saved him on Titan, fingers rolling over the coarse metal.
Thor was a possibility, he had missed out on the whole Accords thing so is unlikely to hold anything against him. Wong, though, he seemed like a stronger candidate – if he’s alive. Tony is thisclose to asking Ghost to look him up, when he hears the video message tone. Confused, he turns on his heel, eying it sceptically. It shouldn’t even be possible.
Tony screamed loudly, making all of them except Nat jump. He was crying too, great sobs that convulsed his unconscious body once more. Part of Steve thought this is what Tony Stark dying looked like, or maybe the brainwashing Bucky was subjected to.
“Plus, Ghost needed a little beefing up, Friday was too perky. He’s gruff as hell and can tell a mean bedtime story.” Aiming - and failing - to sound light hearted, Tony looks at the boy. Jeeze, Harley’s mom must be gone, his friends too… It has to be a really crappy situation to be ending up on Tony’s doorstep. “Hey come on, don’t make me ask him to sing ‘twinkle twinkle little star’ or something.”
These are just kids. They can't possibly know that he was stranded in the middle of space, watching as everything fell apart. It's his fault Thanos made it to Earth, their hatred is justified and it cuts through him like a knife to warm butter. People used to look up to him, but is this all he’s become?
“Rhodey’s alive,” Bruce interjects, recognising all of that bad blood he’d missed out on, “Thor too. Rocket, he’s a racoon, we’re in Wakanda right now… There are so many dead Tony.”
He'd gotten so used to people following his orders without question that, of course, the son of Howard Stark would be the one to do a constant 180 on him. Tony didn’t listen to anyone, sometimes not even himself, and that agitated Steve to no end. The truth though, the truth snuffs all that anger out. He likes Tony too much
He can’t remember the last time he slept. It feels like a never-ending blur, with the days conjoining into an unyielding stretch of his mental capabilities. The wound on his chest has started to heal properly now, with bending not seeming to cost him a few hours off his life. The skin still looks infected, an angry pulsing red, but it’s not exuding puss or anything so he’s not too worried. He’s walked off worse. Or maybe he hasn’t, he’s lay in four feet of snow resigned to succumb to the numbness of his injuries, trapped in his own suit.
His tongue feels laden in his mouth, his throat constricted with words he doesn’t know how to say. Finding his falsest bravado, he takes a breath.
was like taking a toddler to a rated 18+ movie. A real life movie with lots of blood and gore and world ending sadness.
He walks to a glowing piece of metal on the table against the wall, opposite the monitors. A memento from Sokovia that had been splintered by Thor’s lightening. It kept an iridescent glow and Tony wondered if it was connected to Thor’s hammer in some way. Probably not, though, after Mjolnir was destroyed it is more likely to be a mass of charged, useless particles. That leaves Tony with option two. His plan currently consists of hacking the International Space Station and broadcasting a frequency out there that hopefully Thor will understand and respond to. And accomplishing all of that, without accidentally inviting every alien race to Earth or not getting arrested for compromising Government property. Breathing harshly through his nose, he rubs a hand across his brow.
Injecting a small about of the bots into his right foot, he feels a terrible burning and tingle swarm into his toes. It’s like wearing a shoe that’s too small on the
He sighs, clenching his fist in the flimsy sheet. The heat of Wakanda floated through his window, as a soothing balm and warm reminder that he wasn’t under ice. It felt almost peaceful, if it weren’t for the chaos awaiting him in the Palace.
The Winter Soldier is dead. Why doesn’t he feel anything for justice for his parents? He’d tried to kill the man himself. But there’s nothing. No relief, no weight taken from his shoulders. He’s completely stunned to silence, his fingers twitching restlessly at his tablet. Maybe it’s the broken sound of defeat coming from Steve. Maybe it’s the fact that deep down he hadn’t really wanted to kill Bucky, he knew it wasn’t really his fault. He was a weapon being used by Hydra. He should have done more to help Steve.
“Nat, you look better.” He aims to sound less like he’s rasping at Death’s door, but judging by her expression, she wasn’t buying it.
“I have completed the checks on the latest iteration of the nanobots,” Ghost growls. Tony is more or less used to his general demeanour now, and the low rumble is both comforting and somewhat assertive at the same time. Like a strong Dad – or how Tony imagines a Dad would be. His experience was fairly limited, after all. It’s also hilarious to get Ghost to say ridiculous things because of the depth of his voice. In the hours he spent scouring books, he had Ghost read countless nursery rhymes to keep him amused.
Captain America, had called him out and said that when it came down to it, he wouldn’t lay down on the wire for the sake of others. As though Tony could be
With a groan, he grabs the bottle of whiskey. Scarcely managing to steady his hand long enough not to send it clattering to the floor, he brings the bottle to his chapped lips. He takes a long drag from it, choking because of the angle he’s attempting this whole operation at. He pulls the panel towards him and checks his vital signs.
Tony collapsed on his side on the bed. Everything hurt, an ache he knew was going to take a lifetime to get used to. His conscious was clouded by figures. No wonder the streets were thickly coated in ash. He needs to start on the new suit, he’d been stagnant with worry, near expecting people to start floating away before his eyes again, out of reach. He might even try to eat some real food. His heart still didn’t feel right and as he lies there in the darkness pleading for sleep to take him, he fists the shirt for comfort.
While the reality stone truly does terrify him the most, it’s the not the least containable. Time is his real concern. If Thanos closes his fist he could readily undo any progress Tony would have made in stopping him. Although, Tony suspects that like a cat to an injured mouse, Thanos will humour him. He’ll allow him feeble attempts to match a God – ha – with a fist full of the most powerful weapon, if only to make his end more satisfying for himself.
The stinging rises and he gasps out, forcing himself to fight through the pain; nothing happens. He grunts, clearing his mind again. He used to have an amazing mind palace, unfortunately situations of late have left him jumbled and disorganised.
He couldn’t listen to her. The ocean of his insecurities were already screaming the same thing in his ears. He has proved time and time again that he isn’t enough. There’s never enough of his brilliance or his madness to give. He’d love to wallow in that feeling, to give up and shut his brain off – to die and finally be at peace with the war in his brain. Nothing he has done has ever been the right thing to do. He doesn’t have the conscience of Captain America or the wisdom of Thor. But Strange gave up the stone for a reason. A reason greater than his own understanding, and he’ll have to start by making sure that the good doctor didn’t absolutely colossally fuck up.
Shameless God Of War references, and hey look, a new character to interact with everyone! This has taken a turn I didn't expect with this story so I'm excited to see how this plays out.
need to build new armour. Something that doesn’t expose his abilities and could withstand at least one of the Infinity Stones. He rubbed his temples, he needed to find someone with better expertise, but who?
The last part of her sentence is hushed, and Tony feels like he’s in the courtyard being given a cigarette to smoke by the older kids.
“Being irritable won’t deter me, and since you’re choosing to act particularly peevish today I suppose you won’t want an update on the anti-avenger climate in New York.”
There’s an Anti Avengers protest and ho-boy, is it a big one. There are Pro Avengers groups, and of course not-so-friendly-towards-Avengers groups showing up. From what Ghost had briefly filled him in on, some politicians were trying to rework the accords and get it through congress, to protect the now scattered heroes left. Endearing, certainly, but not something Tony would normally make an effort to show up to.
He raises the bottle into the air, toasting Ghost’s good idea, and that’s when he sees it. Or well him. Himself, in the reflection, along with Bruce and Nat and
It’s just a shoe rack, that’s all. Peter’s Converse All Star’s are on the first shelf, then Pepper’s heels and it sends shockwaves through Tony’s whole being. The visceral scream that is ripped from him doesn’t sound human. The carpet on the ground is hard beneath Tony’s knees, dusted in a fine white film.
“Jesus, Tony, we thought you were dead! What the hell happened to you?!” Relief, that’s what the voice sounds like.
Here’s the problem: Harley’s there. You remember Harley, right? Because Tony sure as hell does. Faux sweet, innocent looking kid with the tongue of a viper and a mass of curly hair? He’s in trouble. Or he's about to be in trouble. These types of show downs usually end up bloody; the idea of that kid from  Tennessee being stuck in the middle... He doesn't dare dwell on it. Tony’s heart thumps with a sense of hope that he’s even alive – regrettably, he has no real plan of what to do with him once he gets there. He also has no idea why Harley is in New York; maybe he does, and he doesn’t enjoy the narrative his imagination implies.
Some Vibranium would have come in handy for the basis of his new suit; toughest material on Earth would give him piece of mind in case Thanos decides to rearrange any more of the solar system. He doesn’t have any, though, and he doesn’t really fancy asking the Queen of Wakanda for a handout at a time like this.
, per se. I spoke to you that way to give you time to adjust.” If Ghost could shrug, Tony could imagine him shrugging right now, “It no longer seems necessary to keep up the façade.”
At the moment, a reporter is standing at ground level where the old Avengers Tower used to be; there are people dressed up in disfigured outfits of the various heroes, spraying the sidewalk with numerous creative and unflattering slurs. The overweight man in a Captain America suit makes a thrusting motion and then flips off the camera, which is so not Steve Tony almost laughs at it.
The retina scans work, thankfully, and the sound of hinges opening has never sounded so good in all his life. He throws the boxes of his tools onto the workbench and promptly collapses onto the nearest seat. Unconsciousness grabs him without warning, his eyes closing without his permission.
Tony is about to make off in a brisk dodge and run tactic, when an inky black portal opens up behind him and a hand reaches through. The kids look mystified, and Tony feels their shared confusion for a half second before he recognises the stoic face attached to the hand.
He can't bear his overactive imagination any longer. He’s on the floor, crying into the mud. First Peter, then Pepper. The forest morphs around him, he barely notices, except he’s now standing in a hallway.
“Oh, that,” Tony smiles; remembering the better days when the world wasn’t full of ash and hatred. “A friend wouldn’t stop going on about it, you’d have liked him.”
“Dummy, grab me a scalpel,” He jumps to his feet, suddenly invigorated, “G, can you limit the processors to just the muscles and nerves in my feet?”
The loss of Pepper brings him to his knees in a clearing. The ground is still scorched, evidence of the fire that had been. And there in the centre-
, would feel better than it did. That it wouldn't look so different, that he wouldn't be able to sense the change. The weight of billions being removed from the surface, like a physical sensation shouldn't be evident. Coming closer, it’s not just the same vestiges of rock and water that he’d left. Everything was
Tony peaks through his fingers to look at him. He looks so much older than that scruffy kid who let him hide out in his garage.
There it goes again! Her voice – he can’t ignore it. Not caring whether any of this is real, he takes off at a run into the woods.
“They’re good people. I’m sure they’d welcome you. Plus, if you didn’t care about any of your people, you wouldn’t be taking me in the first place.”
“Wow I wasn’t expecting it to be some fucked up episode of Jerry Springer, but here we are,” He gets out of his chair, wobbling on his first steps because if he thought he was in excruciating pain immediately after the fight, everything had settled into bone deep ache at this point. His vision was blacking in and out, not that Nebula noticed, and he leaned on the chair for a minute to collect himself again. “Are you injured, your robot self? Is it damaged?”
He didn’t let himself think about who hasn’t made it. The 50% of the world that is gone, selfishly, means nothing to the amends he may never get to make. He needs to apologise to them all. To sit down and watch a film with them again. To invite Peter over to try new tech. Sit in the lab with Bruce. Hack the playlist on Natasha’s Spotify. Go to the gym with Steve.
In the same moment, the politicians arrive and the people explode into violence. Bottles are being thrown, bodyguards doing their best to shield the clients from the fray. More desperately this time, Tony yanks causing Harley to slip down the bonnet of the car to his feet.
“We haven’t got much time, G, so keep an eye us, would you?” Tony says, offhand, picking up the petri dish he’d placed on the table with his free hand.
“It’s good that you’re alive, we could use your help,” Steve finally says, and if that isn’t the lowest blow of all.
The kid’s trance breaks (thank god, because Tony is so not good at this whole Dad thing), and he seems once again interested to investigate the panels and flick through some of the books littering the ground.
The tightness in his chest hasn’t lessened. His heart feels caged beneath his ribs, beating a cacophony against the bone. He rubs a distracted hand along the scar of the arc reactor; wondering for the one thousandth time whether the doctors did indeed remove all of the shrapnel. Every lungful of air is a tremendous effort, more so than usual. Breathing an uneasy sigh, his attention refocuses to the room around him instead of the display.
screaming. There should be sweat on his brow and a sob lodged in his chest – he doesn’t deserve a peaceful night sleep. Not yet.
He doesn't know where he stands with Steve, the leader of the Avengers. The good Captain, who has shown time and time again that he'll stand by what he believes to be right. He can't hate him anymore, there's nothing but gratitude that he's alive left in the gaps that two years without him created. Given his frosty reception the other day, it doesn't look like he'd be eager to work with Tony.
Tony’s interest is peaked, and with everything in his workspace back in order he thinks about how aggressively certain those kids were back in the street. Definitely not a good time for the rest of the gang to show back up. He’s got a lot on his mind now though, and since he won’t be going out again any time soon he waves Ghost off. The design of the Mark 48 needs to be worked on, there’s a plethora of Infinity Stone magic to go through and he needs to talk to Thor. He hasn’t got time for New York’s personal vendettas right now.
Since Howard died, and Obidiah royally screwed him over, Tony made the conscious choice to only let himself be the master of his own destiny. Harry Potter can shove his little underhand move right back down his own snarky throat.
Time seems to slow down then, as allows his eyelids to slip closed and leans on his hands. He’s tired, so tired, all the damn time. However, if he avoids sleep, he avoids the nightmares and it helps him to stay busy. To keep his brain focused on what needs fixing, rather than on what he’d failed to keep safe. Though his best efforts to keep his mind off of Peter, Strange, the Guardians, he can’t help himself when it comes to periods of rest. When he has to wait for something to scan, or heat up, or someone to answer his call… Peter’s apologies filter into his ears. The venom in Steve’s voice the first chance he had to be happy Steve was alive. Natasha’s face when she had told him there was still no word on Barton.
“You had been unresponsive for an hour; your vital signs were dropping. I thought that Jarvis may help you to return, but when that also failed I simply checked your contacts until someone answered. A female, Shuri, adapted the call to a video link.”
On the table, Tony stares down at his feet. He takes one of the syringes and opens the petri dish with the first completed sample of nanobots. With his free hand, he makes a small incision along the top of his foot.
“The nanobots are struggling to fully connect to your CNS, I’m investigating the fluctuating temperature. Other than that, I would call this a success, Guardian.”
inventing wrong) than he really cares to think about. From the depths of an Afghanistan cave, after having a car battery strapped to his chest, he made a flamethrower armour mash up that somehow saved his life. He invented the damn arc reactor to keep him alive. SHIELD, the largest secret organisation for protecting Earth personally consults
“I wondered why you’d been so quiet, hackers sucking up all your processing?” Tony should be more concerned that so many people have tried to call him. Had something happened? Unfortunately, his emotional instability can only handle lashing out at his AI, at the moment. “Or did someone spike your coffee too?”
Weeks could have passed and he’d never have noticed. His stomach aches, from his wounds or from hunger. Dummy is holding a cup out to him, arm turning gently to entice him. He nearly catches himself laughing at the absurdity of it, his only living companion is a sentient robotic arm. He takes the cup and checks it for liquid, and it surprisingly has coffee inside. Downing it in gulps, he wipes his lips; staring at his worktop properly for the first time.
It was malicious and he knew it. It was more ruthless than he thought himself capable. He found that he didn’t care. He didn’t give a flying fuck what monster he had to become to take Thanos on. He’d find him and make things right. As right as he could, anyway.
Tony shrugs it off. Plays it like he’s totally a-ok and everything is absolutely fine with him and the situation he’s in is unquestionably normal. It’s not, he and Wong both know, and when he picks up the nearest book, flicking through it with a dejected and absent mind, Wong doesn’t query it.
Striding down the path, he smiles small to himself. He doesn’t need Ghost to inform him that the quiet steps behind him is in fact Harley, or that the harrumph that followed was down to his own lack of reaction. The silence goes from victorious to uncomfortable. In spite of feeling the need to say something to the kid, he finds himself at a loss. If Harley’s here, in New York, hanging out with a bunch of misfits, standing up for the Avengers, then where is him Mom? And his little sister… Tony forces the bile back into the depths of his stomach.
The bots have no energy source. He’s an idiot. The world’s leading supplier of clean, affordable energy and he built a damn suit that has no battery. This is serious day one stuff. It’s using just the jumps and starts of his body, and it’s not even nearly enough. He can feel himself slowing in the air, the plates around his arm absorbing themselves back into his skin beyond his will. His right boot has given up completely; it takes all of his training to keep himself from dropping like a lead balloon from the sky. It forces him to land, not gently, still a mile from his target destination. Frustrated and disappointed in himself, he flexes his partially covered fingers.
His eyes wander to the elaborate computer system that has been set up at the end of the table. Thanks to Shuri, they actually get to keep an eye on him. Not that Tony gets to know that. She said it was only fair seeing as he technically spied on them first. Steve pulls a chair out, moving closer to the screen, with his elbows balanced on his knees. Tony is standing by his workstation (not the one in the Tower, which leads Steve to wonder where in the world Tony
“I don’t blame you if you didn’t notice,” His external walls were starting to rebuild themselves, he could be the coldest son of a bitch if he wanted to be, “I’m kinda in the middle of keyhole surgery-“
A tower of a woman pushes past him, and as he wades into the thick of the mob he finds himself weaving and bobbing blows with various people.
He glares at the panel he’s found in his hands, gripping it so tightly he can see the screen begin to invert. This isn’t how his whole ‘go back in time and save the world, again’ plan was supposed to go. There has to be a way for him to be better, he’s so sick of repeating his mistakes. Not that he is ready to dive into that rabbit hole.
The problem is, he is starting to think Thanos wasn’t wrong. Not about the mass genocide of course, morally, personally and legally Tony knows that thinking anyone has the right to make that choice is ridiculous. However, as Thanos had said, they are both cursed with knowledge.
“Yeah, guess they thought they could try figure something out by poking around in space. Thor’s axe is pretty handy for jumping planets.”
Out of instinct he heads to the common room, hoping to run into Thor, or Nat, to see a face he’s become accustomed to, a repetitive counter measure to prove that some of them aren’t lost.
Something nudges him awake. It’s a piece of driftwood. Tony is here with his lonely piece of driftwood and not a care in the world. He feverishly grins into the harsh surface. It scrapes against his cheek, the texture feeling so real and yet so far away, like he’s experiencing it through someone else’s body.
“Because, asshat, whether I like it or not I’m the one who has got to fix this mess. And you, well, you have a ship.” He was already stumbling towards her, doing his best not to look back to what was left of Peter, to his pile of vomit, to the dirt encrusted with his blood and tears.
Pretending not to hear, Tony grumbles resolutely to himself. He’s not hiding, he’s just taking some time to decompress.
The fact that the Avengers had two of the stones at one point terrifies and frustrates Tony to no end. If only they’d destroyed them while they had them. They should never have created Ultron or put that stone in Vision. For Thanos to get it from Vision destroyed Wanda as much as it did his own creation. He shakes his head, trying to refocus.
Tony leans back in the wheelie chair, hand scraping through his hair and taking a deep breath. He can feel the neurons in his brain firing away, he missed spending hours in his workshop. He always had. Unlike his father, Tony didn’t enjoy the politics of running a company and being the world’s most eligible asshole.
Bear with him a second because, holy shit, he should absolutely not be identifying with the giant purple testicle.
“Did I code sass directly into your mainframe or is that something you’re learning from somewhere else,” Tony scoffs, “And on another note, I never gave you permission to make that call the other day, so what the hell is with you?!”
He clears his throat. It’s ‘Stark’, is it. He supposes the literal apocalypse wouldn’t be enough to mend the bridges he’d destroyed with his friend.
“It’s a little late for that!” The shortest of them busts forward and storms up to Tony now that he’s on the ground, “My maw is dead and the Avengers… You were supposed to protect us.”
Tony rolls his eyes. He hadn’t managed to get Ghost to drop the whole ‘I’m from a video game’ thing, so he was forced to put up with his overextension of literal references.
Sat on the table, he braces himself for a few moments. He lounges back, like Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park, gritting his teeth until the heat finally subsides. Closing his eyes, he tries to visualise jet boots on his feet, hell he’d pat himself on the back for getting a shoe of some sort.
Life has returned to a state of near normality. There are cars on the highway, lights in the skyscrapers. It looks relatively human. The breeze is making his flight slightly colder than he’d like but it’s almost a relief to feel it. The ash that was in the air seems to have lessened, it’s not such a struggle to see and breathe.  Flight has always had a way of calming Tony, the feeling of freedom it gives is comparative to nothing.
“You knew Thanos?” Tony asks her, having already looked on the database linked to the ship. Nothing was coming up about Thanos or the stones that he either didn’t already know or had gleaned from his own niche experience.
He pulls the screen back towards him. There was a massive amount of data that he could review, ship stats and logs, current temperature and planetary units. He yawns and wipes at his eyes with his free hand. He can do this, he has to be able to do this.
His hand involuntarily fists his shirt where the remaining chassis for his nanobots crumbles beneath his palms. There’s blood everywhere, but the cauterisation of his side is holding up well enough. He frowns.
Reopening the incision on his stomach, his wobbly fingers cut a semi-straight line. Everything is red, a deep red that’s coating his fingertips and his chest. The petri dish moves in his hand. Something clatters to the floor. Tony doesn’t hear it, not as such, but he feels the reverberation of Ghost’s voice. Ghost is not capable of human emotion, although Tony can recognise the rise and fall of his inflection as dread.
“Ghost?” He tests it out on his tongue. He could get accustomed to it, and the deep growl of his voice was a soothing change from Friday. “I programmed you, just now?”
And, he can admit, his default state was being exasperated with Tony. Not with any heat, because all that anger is there to mask the
“I’ll level with you, I get antsy. I need to fix something and I kind of like the idea of you finishing Thanos off without half your robo-guts hanging out.”
Harley’s chest is heaving heavily, and they both stare at each other. Tony bursts into laughter, falling into his swivel chair with a guffaw.
He was poking far too close to the open wound that will never close inside Tony. Not until he fixes this, fixes them.
Tony has. And he hasn’t. More hands on deck means more liabilities and lives he has to keep in check. He can’t be responsible for anyone else following in his footsteps. When he says it’s a one-way trip; he really does mean it. He wished that Peter wasn’t so stubborn, the world could use a friendly neighbourhood Spiderman right now. He could use that kid's phone calls to Happy, updating him on his sandwich that day, which little guy he helped. He sighs. It’s a friend, someone familiar, that he misses most of all.
He raises an eyebrow half surprised, half troubled. Fondling the broken gauntlet, he turns an accusing gaze at the ceiling, as if he was scorning a child.
That does mean there’s a chance, a very slim one, that Tony can withstand whatever forces or powers that be long enough to hit rewind. Tony knows that the hardest part of all will be choosing when to stop. How many can he save? He already knows the answer isn’t going to be enough to satiate him.
Before disconnecting totally, Tony drops a few lines of code in. Their video feed pops back up. He watches, dejected, wrapping the bandages around his chest. His breathing is still worse for wear, but the ache is manageable. Drinking the last of his whiskey, he settles in to watch his friends from afar, wishing he could be with them, be the person who could be there for them. The news of the dead weighs on him; Ghost doesn't interrupt him as he sits there blankly, turning the scalpel in one hand once again deep in mourning.
“What about you C-3PNO,” He deflects, looking away from the illuminated screen, “That can’t have been all of your people, Guardians of the Galaxy… Sounds like a tacky band name.”
Briefly his mind wanders to Natasha, and he flickers his eyes to the panel with her little blinking light. She’d reluctantly agreed to pick up a phone from the airport on her way to Budapest, so he could keep an eye on her and she could call in if she was in trouble. What he hadn’t told her was that he’s also monitoring every camera feed he can get access to, running her, Barton and various other people through facial recognition just in case. Tony frowns. He feels like constantly counting his ducks before one of them gets blown to pieces. He shivers, the phantom feel of ash on his skin. Her light flashes on the screen, and he takes some comfort in that.
Ok, so it’s not really a good secret if he keeps telling people, however he doesn’t really fancy another fly through a rough area.
It’s soundless across both of their video feeds. None of them seem sure of what to say. Steve leaves. The remaining eyes watch as Tony collects his nanobots into a cup and finishes sewing his stomach.
Why wouldn’t he? Tony has revolutionised the tech industry as the world currently knew it. He’d heard the rumours of Wakanda, they were hard to miss, and he had no doubt that a civilisation allowed to exist and thrive without outer world influences could no doubt put him to shame. But he was one man. A brilliant brain that has been moulded and shaped and beaten. God was his brain tired. The insomnia and anguish and anger that had got him to this point would surly have driven any normal person insane.
Tony responds to Rhodey’s comment with this, finding the energy sapped out of him just from reliving it:
“I need to make a stop,” He says, wiping his hands of the grease and blood, the grazes still sluggishly bleeding, “Then I know where I need you to take me.”
The building is empty and Pepper isn't there. He sighs, nervous, she might have gone home. That sounded reasonable enough to Tony's overworked brain. A ghost town: that's what he’s been dropped into and despite being used to the feeling, he’s never truly been encompassed by loneliness like this. He picks up Dummy, a couple of tablets and laptops. The schematics for the nanotech along with some of his prototypes for the next stage, which he dumps into a box too. Dragging the best of his tools, in the first toolbox he’d ever owned (he can be sentimental, people just assume the worst in him) he manages to get all his equipment back to the ship.
“I’ve been trying to keep everyone together,” Steve laughs, humourlessly, “But everyone has someone to look for, or something to go back to… Without Buck, I, it’s just me.”
Tony… He didn’t… He didn’t… Yet, his brain kept helpfully supplying him with the basis that if they’d been together, the Avengers as a team, all of them, they might have stood a chance. Instead, he ends up hurting Tony even more.
“I’m sorry,” He says sincerely, because he is. There are so many dead across the world but to lose all these people so close to home... Superhero or not, he’s allowed to mourn his losses too.
“Easy,” Tony says, patting him awkwardly on the shoulder. He doesn’t remember this age well, spending too much time drunk or on the inside of a tool box, “I’ve made some mistakes, kid. Big ones. I’m trying to fix one of them right now.” He looks to the side of Harley’s head, imagining his own Dad having this conversation with him. Not that he ever did. “The second I got back on my feet I had Ghost looking for you.”
He places a book into Tony’s hands, and then opens a portal chucking more through with an astounding amount of accuracy.
Poking around Fury’s files back in the day lead him to all sorts of interesting information, including that of Peter Quill. He was drunk at the time though, and the memory flitters back to him on a passing whim. Guardians, there were five of them. He’d not seen antenna girl, or Nebula, so maybe Quill was expanding his band.
Rhodey for his part, bless him, sat there tirelessly listening throughout without speaking a word. He added some when Tony couldn’t continue, filling in what had happened in Wakanda. How Steve had gone to protect Vision, stopping Thanos’s gauntlet with his bare hand. The fact that Wanda somehow found the strength to destroy Vision’s stone
Then he woke up, bleary with his dirt and blood clumped hair. His arms were badly bruised, cuts and scrapes littering every body part in view. Tony spoke a few words to his – Ghost – and in true Tony form reached for a drink. His eyes were wide and horrified, the split second in Tony’s mind to flop off that bench and out of view was visible for a half second before he downed the whiskey.
All the way along his left peck, the mutilation that Steve’s shield left behind sears in his mind. The feeling of strength and anger and hatred that the good Captain had channelled as he pummelled Tony’s suit leaves him with goose bumps. His skin tingles with the phantom rip of flesh as his armour had cut into him with each swipe. The stitches on his stomach have congealed blood around them, making him wonder why he didn’t just cauterise it again. On his face were large purple bruises, cuts that lead in varying depths down his neck and frankly covering most of his form.
(It was lucky that Wong had taken a likening to him, forced or not, because without the mystical coffee portal Tony wouldn’t have gotten as far as he had.)
“For all her brilliance Tony, you’d love her,” Rhodey finishes, “There’s just too much damage. She’s been taken out of the frying pan and thrown into the proverbial fucking sun.”
Tony can see the flashing warning messages and errors on his augmented screen. Big angry red letters, a wheezing sound from his jets; he tsks, trying to push himself to fly for a little bit longer.
Rocket, the talking space racoon, spent a lot of time to begin with perched atop the oversized table. Dissembling and reassembling his gun, his gaze unfocused and lingering on something outside, Tony had sat cursed to watch this creature mourn his friends. Although Tony felt as though he’d lost everything, everyone, his team were still there. Alive. The creature seemed to understand the gravity of not hearing anything from his crew. He knew he was alone; trapped on Earth, with nowhere to go and no one to be consoled by. The guilt that Tony felt was almost as bad as the grief.
“You know what Dummy, I should have made you a coffee machine instead.” Tony says, picking up the most recent item to fall victim to Dummy’s clumsiness. “I could totally change that hand to a coffee pot and add a heating element.”
It rattles him violently this time. He pushes and doesn’t stop, despite no longer feeling his legs, or his right arm, he surges towards the light and comes to a surface. Exhausted, he takes uneven breaths of air; spluttering the water that was clogged in his lungs. There’s barely anything to see, it’s so murky, even now, on what he presumes to be the surface. His eyes squint with the effort of trying to adjust, meanwhile his fatigued frame barely accomplishes keeping him afloat.
Red flashes across his screen, and he only just manages to duck as one of the group takes a swing for his head with a piece of wood.
Today, he clips himself into one of the seats. The ship rattles and Titan moves further and further away.
There is a lot that he leaves out. Blank spaces in the story, things Rhodey doesn’t need to know, he looks like he’s dealing with enough at the moment anyway.
It doesn’t matter. There was now a half decent boot on a foot, and he must have hit his head harder than he thought because he’s standing dumbly grinning at his feet. Forcing the nanobots back into his body was harder than it should have been, requiring him to sit down again.
, electronics and building is kind of my gig. I know there’re plenty of parts on this ship. So, is there a way I can help you?”
Opening his mouth to speak, he sees Harley move a blur across his vision as the video feed cuts off. He sputters.
To compartmentalise the way Tony’s brain likes to: build the suit, distract Scrotum-Hulk and keep the fist open. He’d almost managed it once, with next to no planning specifically
?!” Laughing incredulously, her glare hardened and she pushed him roughly on the shoulder, “You cannot believe that you can undo what has been done. I saw you fight. There’s nothing left in you.”
That flip phone has been in his pocket for the better part of two years now and, like his coffee, every morning and every night he flicks across Steve’s number. It is a lot of wasted time, virtually too much for his perfectionist brain to handle.
His vision begins to blur, like everything has slowed down or that one time he got extremely high. Normally he could blame exhaustion, but he knows this is a lot worse and will take a lot more than a simple nap to fix.
“Captain fuckin’ obvious up there Ghost, just shut up for a minute,” he mutters, pulling the shirt down.
“I’m going to have to do this myself, aren’t I?” He asks no one in particular, lifting his shirt and testing the blade against his skin.
That was until Thor, with his curiously short hair and trimmed beard, had come into the room. So far as Tony knew, Rocket left as soon as any other person entered; heaving his too big gun over his shoulder, limping off to a place he couldn’t see. But Thor-
The breadth of information flowing from Wong is almost overwhelming. The guy is like an encyclopaedia of knowledge. He tells Ghost to record the audio from their conversation, because Tony’s own mind is working a mile a minute to connect all the relevant dots.
He’s lost, but who was it he heard just now? Jarvis, no it couldn’t have been. His eyes well with tears, he logically knows that it wasn't… He can’t even bring himself to say it. In his anger his arms raise and splash violently against the water encasing him, encircling him. He watches the ripples drift away in a daze. He doesn’t notice anything’s amiss until the gentle lapping of the water across his chin lulls him into oblivion once more.
He’d already been to the previews and the extended cut to that one – he can hardly believe he let it come true.
in Steve’s ears) staring at panels covered in all sorts of nonsense. He’s pacing; lips poised in thought; hands running through his hair; Dummy hovering beside him. Tony is limping too, his body tight when he moves at a certain angle and thick bandages visible under his shirt.
His head jerks up at the sound of her voice. He blinks rapidly, he hadn’t fallen asleep, he had just been waiting and then-
Looking behind him, Rhodey talks quickly to someone off camera, not even hearing the last of what he’d said.
He jumps over fallen trees, dodges under finger shaped branches and collapses nearly as fast as he’d begun. The tears start in desperation, he’s doesn’t know where to find her. Hell, he doesn’t know where
“Ghost,” He says, forcing himself out of that infinite nothing. Nothing seems particularly off, but he knows how vivid his imagination can be. The lack of a dream is more disconcerting than a nightmare. He considers what the cause could be… “There was something in my coffee wasn’t there.”
“Small rabbit,” Thor said, low and reassuring, “We’ve hardly had the time for me to say that I am sorry you now share my burden.”
Tony is slumped across his workstation. The hole in his lung is proving to be a, how should we say, major system failure. He’s not entirely sure he
This train of thought wasn’t exactly soothing his irregular heartbeat, and he forces himself to look away from the man he doesn’t even recognise anymore.
Hi there! Things are finally starting to come together, and I'm pretty happy with it for once. Please leave any comments or suggestions, I really appreciate every single one :)
“I guess this is goodbye then, thanks for being my latest designated driver,” He smiles blasé, an attempt at being confident again in spite of the
Tony’s words freeze in his mouth, his whole body changing from desperate to be talking to Steve at last, to near enough Iron Man.
Thor was standing by the window, his shadow casting into Rocket’s light. He froze, near imperceptibly if Tony wasn’t zooming his view in to focus on these two unlikely friends.
self-centred. Sure, he’s not a soldier. He can’t imagine being a part of a battalion, a comrade, going into a war unequivocally knowing that you and your friends may not be coming home. Entering a war, with that in mind, must be a harrowing experience for a coward.
“It’s been said, once or twice,” Tony picks up an ancient looking horn from the table he’s standing next to, needing something to keep his hands busy while his mind paces through this, “Thanks for the beam up by the way, how did you know where I was?”
He knew it wasn’t Jarvis – the voice that he had heard. Wishful thinking will get him absolutely nowhere. However, for now, he’s back in his body and by using an old backup file and the glory of the internet, his AI is fully functional. The AI answers to Ghost; he categorically refuses to look too far into why.
Leaving the towel discarded on the floor Tony slips into a pair of tracksuit bottoms and top from the drawers in the bedroom. What Ghost had said buzzed in his head. This Shuri is smart, smarter than him, he’ll need to be more cautious with his surveillance on his friends. Also, had he lost weight? The shirt certainly felt looser than he remembered his clothes being.
He also needs to deal with Friday. She is inferior to Jarvis – he may well just be bitter that he had become attached to Jarvis. He shouldn’t be able to build a bad AI, but he did. Friday wasn’t as quick, as friendly. She’s self-learning, in the same way that Jarvis was, but she lacks the warmth and personality Jarvis had. Damnit, he doesn’t want to start crying again. He wants his friends back. That’s too much to ask, he knows, most people leave him through a fault all his own. A flaw in his code that can’t be rewritten.
His voice is airy, light, his eyes following Dummy as his bot rolls backwards to scoot away from him.
He puts the offending mask on the table as though it were made of molten lava. His heart ticks a Morse code rhythm in his chest, an indecipherable compilation of dread and panic.
“My sister was the only reason any of them even tolerated me. And now she’s dead. Figure out where you want to be dropped or I’ll dump you whenever we enter the atmosphere.”
. He starts with something genuine, he is glad Tony is alive, so very glad. Gladder than he can let any of the ex-team ever know. He ruined it with asking Tony for help. Quite obviously, Tony was in no state to be doing anything other than healing. There were little parts of the Iron Man armour, around him, imbedded in some of his wounds. Steve’s mouth was careless, and he hid behind berating Tony to stop himself from gushing his worry all over the room.
Cold marble slaps beneath his bare feet, and the sharp pain sends him careening forward onto all fours. A few seconds later, he feels something growing around his toes. He rolls onto his ass, grabbing the offending foot into his hand. Armour plate is messily assembling itself around the sole of his foot; it’s warmer than he expected it to feel.
Taking the leap again, he trips as the boot almost completely forms around his right foot; the sudden change of weight caught him completely off guard. So did Dummy, claw outstretched and tangled in bandages standing over him. The slight and familiar trickle of blood seeps down his forehead. What did he hit anyway?
The pain is searing and Tony has to lean against the side of the books for a minute, pulling his faceplate off to take a deep, grounding breath.
The call cuts off. Tony sits there for a minute, chewing the side of his cheek; he only stops as the acrimonious taste of copper sweeps across his tongue. Abruptly, he stands.
He can tell Harley wants to comment on the fact there’s nothing but a sheer rock face in front of them; he rolls his eyes and lifts up his sunglasses to scan himself on the facial recognition software. The cliff splits and Harley makes a small gasp of surprise.
“Let’s go see what Wong has for us, hm?” He attaches his faceplate, relieved that the comms and GPS is working properly. He’s not in a full suit, but it wasn’t like he was going into battle.
“Are we seriously walking all the way to Avengers Headquarters?” Harley’s pitching voice interrupts his thoughts. “And why didn’t you tell anyone you survived?” He kicks a rock and looks into the road, “I thought you would come looking for me. Instead I came to find you only to find everyone divided! Why haven’t you defended them? Where’s the rest of the Avengers?”
The gears inside his brain were already turning, the time stone had to be the key. Thanos must be able to be summoned or tracked. An energy signature had to be left behind. Something. He just had to find it.
His right boot sputters, cutting off suddenly and haphazardly spurring into life in the same breath.
He thought the Avengers would be different. He thought he’d found a family, people he could start to let the walls down near and trust. He and Steve didn’t get on all that well to begin with, but the years had changed that. The battles and bloodshed and drinks after a debrief with Fury.
; he wouldn’t have a clue. It is an unwelcome series of thoughts, because without his panic and his fears what does he have left? The only thing he has for certain is his brain, and of course Ghost couldn’t do it alone. The fact that Dummy was in on it too, his closest friend, stings more than it should. Building robots with the ability to learn is a gift and a curse; especially when their software learns from a particularly bad role model. He takes a moment, trying to listen to his AI like he wouldn’t a close friend.
Captain America – war hero, fossil, legend – is back in the country. Not to mention the God, a talking racoon, an assassin and the Hulk. It’d do no one any favours to get them back on US soil, he’s working on fixing that, though. No, it’s safer for them to be in Wakanda. They can do good in Wakanda; there’s safety in Superhero numbers.
“Are you some kind of maniac?” Wong exclaims in return, hands flustering at his sides, “You know there is more anti-Avengers graffiti in New York right now than supportive ones? You could have been captured or beaten, you’re crazy.”
Tony winces at the tone. Is he really that pathetic? Can his own machine see all the flaws in his brain that render him unable to fully relive that experience again?
It was the reason Howard hated him so much, Tony continues fiddling with the pliers, creating figure eights and loops with his fingers, consumed by the pivotal memory of his father. Howard’s life became finding Captain America. Maybe he did truly like him, Tony didn’t know. All the can think of is the business man that ran that overactive brain; his golden goose slammed into ice with the serum that could have made him millions. He hates thinking about Steve like that; Steve only had good things to say about his Da. Nobody knew what it was like to live with the man, be looked down on by the man, be told whenever he decided to show up that he would never be half the man Steve Rogers was.
Back when the team first formed, he compiled a list of their attributes and weaknesses, determined to upgrade their suits and equipment to be revised to their quickly growing lists of enemies. He worked on an improved quiver for Clint, more flexible clothing with secret knife slots for Nat; even after Sokovia, he’d been trying to advance Steve’s shield. He had a prototype ready.
He had zoned out. Quite spectacularly. The girl was regarding him with careful guarded eyes, her own cogs physically humming and whirring.
“Right, you,” He paused, because he didn’t really remember her name, “Interstellar, or whatever,” she was glaring at him but he was too drained to care. “How’d you get here, by ship? You have a ship?”
do this, but if he can get an AI up and running while wholly delirious then who knows… He might just pull this off.
Not a question this time, thanks Natasha. That means she’s alive. The bile that’s been settling in his throat eases a bit. Banner and Natasha, that’s a start.
Steve closes his eyes tight shut, knuckles pressing into his sockets until he sees stars. He couldn’t risk losing Bucky again, not to Tony. He was selfish but he didn’t care, Bucky deserved better than all the shit he consistently got thrown at him, from way back when they were kids all the way up to now. Now, where Steve is once again lost, his best friend dead and aliens knocking at their door more often than not.
He leans forward, pitching at the ache in his face and chest and practically in every nerve of his body. He wonders how long he’s been sitting there, surrounded by the ashes of the boy he wished he’d never gotten involved with. Glancing over, he sees the girl kicking around at the dust of the planet. Just casually shuffling what’s probably Stardick or Strange or Blue Hulk… For all her composure she looks just as lost as Tony feels.
Blood was everywhere and Tony’s slumped body was twitching on the worktop. A gaping hole in his stomach nearly had Steve pushing the others out of the way to get to the screen. His first reaction was that he was recreating his time in Afghanistan, putting an arc reactor back in… He’s not convinced the truth is much better.
Harley explores the bedroom for a minute before following him into the workshop, looking slightly lost and in wonder all at the same time.
Walking through the streets of Wakanda is quiet, nothing close to the noise of New York. People are around but they keep to themselves, busy with mourning or rebuilding. The dust catches in the wind and breezes past his face, it reminds him of old warehouses and abandoned lots. It’s not a fond memory.
She flips a few switches on the board before her; gets out of her seat to face him. Her glare is like knives, and he’s had enough of those for a long while. Turning, he holds his bloody hands up in surrender.
“Yeah, it’s crossed my mind. I’m going to have a word with Thor, later. See if I can’t find out more about the oven glove of death.”
“So,” Tony leads the way, “Toilet’s over there, this is your room,” He points to the furnished room and king-sized bed he’s slept in exactly once, “If you need me I’ll be in the workshop through there. Kitchen’s down the hall, and is stocked so get yourself food whenever you want. Also feel free to leave, but for both our sake stay so I can keep an eye on you.”
He wants to call, to talk to Rhodey, or Banner, even Natasha was worth hoping for. But they never stay in the room long, always busy, always moving. He feels useless to assist in their struggles, and only thinking that he’ll annoy them or get in their way, he never does it.
A cup is being pressed to his lips. The brightness of the room is horrible and he turns away. His mouth is so dry though, that he eventually turns to the ever-incessant cup that someone is trying to put through his face. Opening one eye, he scowls half-heartedly at Dummy.
All of the fight drains out of Harley, and his face contorts into an expression Tony can’t identify. He wasn’t expecting him to be ecstatic, but he was hoping for something along the lines of happy, as a minimum. Instead, Harley looks hurt. Betrayed, even.
“Ghost, prepare the rest of the bots.” He hurries to the table, cleaning the scalpel. Using the tablet as a mirror and guided by the map he makes a small cut at the base of his neck.
He hops off the bar stool and flops weakly into his wheely chair. Pushing backwards, he spins himself the right way and catches himself on the desk by the Wakanda Monitor. He waits approximately two seconds of no one being there before spamming call. He chews on a pen in the meantime, leaning back in his chair to grab his latest coffee, pulling a face as he swallows the cold liquid.
, that’s a lot of billions without counting the rest of the universe. The shower clicks off. Tony fumbles for a towel – finding Dummy holding one for him just inches away – and sidesteps the mirror this time.
It’s the worst attack he’s had in a long time. Immobilising, but not unexpected. Arms braced on his knees, he stares at the tainted water until it finally runs clear. He stays there a while longer, finding solace in the grey tiles beneath his feet, in the fact that he can breathe with a semblance of somewhat normal.
“There have been four attempts to contact you, two from Colonel Rhodes, one from Mr Banner and one from Shuri.” Ghost says, impassively, as Tony scoots past Dummy to set up an electron microscope on the desk. “She was very nearly successful in her attempts to get through.”
He’d absolutely forgotten he had been talking to Steve earlier. Had he been waiting there the whole time?
Thank you all so much for reading! And of course for the lovely comments and all the kudos, I love you all umu
“It’s from the game you named me after, isn’t it? And you were ignoring me. I will do what I must, Guardian.”
She lands in the deserted area he’ll now call home, unknown to her is that she's practically standing on top of his building. He'd utilized some of the helicarrier tech, the reflective panels and such - not that Nebula needed to know that. Her eyes scan their surroundings, calculated and unconvinced. As quick as his failing body will let him, he gets his equipment off her ship. He’s sweating profusely by the end, breathing hard because he’s working with a lung and a bit.
He all but throws himself into the hot spray of the shower, appreciating the way it pounds against him, the sound drowning some of the loathing and fear in his mind. The dirt and blood swirls around the drain. He watches it dilute in the clean water, and wonders if it’s normal to have vicious pains in every nerve of your body. Retching, Tony slides his back down the shower until he’s sat on the floor under the cooler spray.
He’s blinking rapidly, tears flowing freely. He can’t hold them back, he hasn’t cried properly for all that he’s lost. Too afraid to call Steve’s number and have it go to voicemail. Petrified of the idea that half his friends are dead.
Logically, too, Vision will remain dead along with Gamora, basically anyone who was involved with the possession of a stone. He can imagine the rips in the fabric of time and space the extensive amount of ‘ctrl-z’ he’ll be doing will create. He should probably talk to Bruce about that. Or Thor. Also, how is he going to get into space in the first place? He hasn’t got a clue.
It’s like owning a pet, Tony thinks. A pet with more complex needs and free will, but he lives with Dummy, how hard can it really be?
It’s a cop out and he knows it. He can’t even keep eye contact with the man, coughing awkwardly and looking seriously back to his tablet. The biological nanobots he’d accidently invented were currently in the process of stitching the lining of his lung back together. The pain should be unbearable, but something about the whole situation is giving his pain receptors something else to focus on.
It was stupid and, like Steve has thought plenty of times before, infuriating. Even before the world collapsing beneath his finger tips again, Tony had Pepper and Steve had Bucky. They were two constants in both their lives. He was supposed to save them all again; sometimes he longs for old Hydra days in the war, when enemies had faces you could recognise and the science was mad but originated on Earth.
Tony rolls his eyes – exactly what he needs to add to his list of problems, teenage rebellion in all it’s glory. He takes a proper look at Harley, from the hoody that sits too big on his shoulders, to his sunken eyes that keep glancing back to the group still protesting on top of the car. He decides to use the dirtiest tactic in the book of Bad Parenting 101 - indifference.
He couldn’t count (Jarvis could) how much of his life has been spent nearly blowing himself up trying to build new things. People assume he’s a selfish bastard and, really, he does little to deter their opinions. He started out in the weapons business and he knows better than anyone that nothing will change his dark past.
he thinks irritably, compelling his limbs into action. Thank God Pepper used to drag him on her morning jogs, or he would have had to of hailed a cab by now. That's all a distant dream, somewhere deep and unobtainable in the backs of his mind. The streets are bustling, and several people are pointing at him, whipping their phones out to record Iron Man sprinting down the street. It occurs to him after the first block that he’s probably going to be in more trouble in the suit than out of it at this point, unless one hundred percent necessary. He risks a breather behind a dumpster and wills the bots back into his body, his skin crawling at the sensation of them moving.
His eyes narrow at her. The chair she’s sitting in hasn’t moved, he can just see the crown of her head, the way she coolly controls the ship. Of course, in between blacking out and being stuck in this ship, he had fiddled with some of the buttons and screens in front of him. At any point, he could have called. He couldn’t bring himself to dial the number. It felt like too much, too many emotions to be conveying across a line.
) he decides to cauterise the wound again. It hurts just as much as the first time and the area around it is blistered and red.
Not Tony, though, he grew with it, encouraged it, taunted his exhausted brain especially when he was exhausted because he had to be better. Improve, adapt and change; his tech and his brain have been his only constants throughout his entire life. His only thank you to his Dad was for the opportunities his less than desirable parenting and company that he’d been left with.
At first, he was ecstatic Tony was alive. The last he’d seen of him was the Iron Man suit heading into space. It could have been a decoy, Steve knows Tony got engaged to Pepper, but Spider Man followed him up there. There’s no way Tony would let that kid out of his sight. Steve had time to ponder this, you see, because Ghost (another AI) called Bruce and Shuri walked them through making it a video feed, for peace of mind of all parties. That was when things went south. Although Ghost had warned them, Steve doesn’t think any of them were ready to see the state Tony was in.
The books Wong had let him borrow were the worst part of it all. Even with Ghost scanning over half the material, he’d learnt very little about the stones architecture or the gauntlet. Half of his work space had books splayed across them, with every available digital service covered in annotations and ramblings from Tony’s mind. With each stone came its own board, he’d categorised it into flaws, strengths and possible loopholes.
And maybe Tony knew it too. But what had made Howard amazing in the tech industry had inadvertently made his son excel further than anyone would believe. How could that scruffy, shy boy turn into an eccentric Superhero with a family of super people?
hold Thanos back long enough to do so; until Thanos had undone all their struggle with a twist of his wrist. He spoke of the relief effort there in Wakanda, which is what they were assisting with, as well as worldwide. Shuri had reluctantly taken over her brother’s place, trying her best to control a broken Kingdom and a shattered world.
He meanders across the bedroom, changing his bandage on his chest while he moves, searching for a clean shirt. Rifling through his drawers, Ghost’s voice almost makes him jump.
So, he settles himself into her ship, resigning to remain quiet, not taking much of it in. The technology should be fascinating, the stabilisers and controls, the brightly lit panels and obvious signs of damage and bodged circuitry. On a normal day, Tony would be sticking his head inside every little compartment.
“I AM Iron Man.” He says it once, then again and again until his practically sweating with the exertion of it. Without his suit, he’s exposed. Out here? He’s a live wire, edgy and tripping, waiting for the spark to set him off.
He still had the formula for Extremis - and not the half botched one - the formula he fixed, thank you. Mixing his nanotech with Extremis had some interesting results. The first time he tried it, it blew up half his desk, which was fun. He’d been busy refining his bots after that. Making them smaller, stronger and less likely to spontaneously combust. With a couple more tweaks, he’ll get Ghost to start running the numbers properly, and after that… He’ll inject himself and hope his brain can withstand his madness one more time.
In the midst of his breakdown, he shivers. Not because it’s cold, no, the planet is actually pretty hospitable and lucky him, because he hadn’t really prepared the nanotech to deal with lack of oxygen or unknown variables of this kind. He shivers because Thanos, destroyer of worlds and genocidal maniac, knew him. By name. Tony Stark. This Titan, warlord, bigot, respected Tony Stark.
his brain helpfully supplies. He ignores it, the niggling idea that everything is so very wrong and tells himself once again that he is Iron Man. All he needs to do is to get what he needs. Deep breaths and baby steps.
Frantically, he claws his shirt off - suddenly his clothes are too tight, the room too close and the air too claustrophobic. Behind his eyelids he sees Thanos’ cruel smile, and he can smell the ash in his nostrils. He gets his trousers off and starts the shower behind him, his hands shaking so violently he clasps them together. The breath he takes is simultaneously too deep and not deep enough, his brain searching all of the exercises he knows to try calm himself down.
“Tony I gotta go, just promise me you won’t beat yourself up too much about this, ok?” Rhodey flaps an irritated hand at the person again, “If you can make it over here, it’d be great to have you back working with us for real.”
“Why are you offering that, when you are yourself in disrepair. I haven’t got much experience with humans, and though Quill had his reasons to hate me…”
“Uh,” He stutters, taking the drink anyway because he always lacked good impulse control, “Quick question, how long have we been on video chat for?”
“One second doc,” He stretches his face, swaying it from side to side, and tries to focus first on what Bruce had said, then on his stomach. His brain feels like a jumble sale, and he’s not sure on how to get it all back inside his house. Taking his tablet with an uncoordinated swipe, he cringes. “What’s the progress like, Ghost?”
Seeming to find this satisfactory, Tony swings his legs over the side of the bed. He scrubs a hand across his chin and feels the roughness of his unshaven beard. It took him three days to shower, after all, who knows how long it will take him to properly groom himself. For once, he doesn’t even care about his appearance; there’s no reporter hanging outside his front door waiting for him to slip up. The world probably thinks he’s dead anyway. That’s a thought. Tony Stark, invisible once more. It’s better off that way.
He flings everything off the table, lying himself down across it. His chest constricts at the movement, ribs clutching a vice grip around his lungs. Sputtering, he moves his shaky hands to the blade. If he doesn’t hurry up he’ll be too dead to do anything about it, anyway.
Tony sits there, his heart beginning to jackhammer in his chest. His coffee was spiked and he didn’t even notice. He’s been so exhausted and mentally drained that he would have gladly accepted a drink containing
Why Natasha is partially ignoring him is for his next stunt. The final salt in the wound Steve could throw before Nat could step in. Bucky was dead and Tony was alive and he didn’t
((Also sorry for another filler (and for repeating the Tony waking up bit, it was relevant to see Steve's POV), but we're gearing up for something big reeeeeal soon))
In the reflection he takes a moment to assess his body. It’s a bad idea. The scars stand out angry and red against his skin, proof of his failures. Reminders that he
“He’s trying to figure it out you know,” She says, after waiting for a moment for Steve to reply further, “A way to bring them back.”
“Banner,” He slurs because, sue him, he’s having both an outer and inner body experience right now; this could just be another part of the simulation after all. The extreme pain he’s in appears to lean in the favour of it being real, though. “Had a moon thrown at me.”
Sorry this has taken so long... I'm making this up as I go along and with work and everything it's been hard to get into the flow. Mistakes will be fixed soon, I just wanted to get this chapter up :_) Thank you for reading, any feedback would be really appreciated!
“Right back at you sweetheart!” The doors close as he shouts it back to her, “You know where to find me.”
He hauls himself across it, shuffling his body so that he’s no longer submerged in the water. His whole body is heavy and dripping, his chest still heaving; eyes wet from being under for so long. It’s got a musty smell, the scent wrapping around his senses and taking him away with it.
Because that’s all Tony Stark is. He’s a brain, he’s useful. Of course Steve doesn’t care about him on a personal level; only Tony allowed himself to get mixed up in that bag of emotions. Just because Tony is currently stealing glances at him, checking that he’s the same Captain America that he’d left (now with a beard, which is doing all sorts of weird things to Tony’s stomach besides the bleeding).
“3,811,409,400 confirmed deaths on this planet alone, though the responsibility you take is not nearly as accurate.”
She shakes her head, staring at the screen with Tony on it. Neither of them says anything for a minute. Steve knows this is her way to scold him, her face still tight as she watches Tony lean on the counter. He treated Tony horribly on that first live feed, and he’s not entirely sure what came over him.
“Excuse me?” He turns to her, her expression is still guarded but he can see it now, the damage he hadn’t before. The limp to her leg, the splintered chunk on her stomach.
Finally, he’s lying on the floor, two boots on his feet. He’s sweating from the exertion, a mixture of blood and salt on his shirt as he wipes his forehead. He hears the video call sound from somewhere above him. A sigh escapes his lips. Pushing back with his hands, he uses the thrusters to hover back to his feet.
A scream startles him. His hand rests over the scar, where his arc reactor used to give him comforting warmth, it used to remind him exactly what he can make out of an awful situation. The anxiety is still there, in the back of his mind, whispering sour nothings into his ears. Frustrated with himself, he clamps his hands over his ears.
Steve hadn’t got a clue what he was going to say to Tony when they were both healthy and the world hadn’t partially ended; he was at a complete loss at what to say to him now. Nat and Bruce exchanged their pleasantries, and then Tony just looked at him. His stupid calculating eyes breezing over him like Steve was the one who, apparently, had a moon thrown at him and somehow got back from outer space to be performing surgery on himself.
The kid that’s talking now picks up a brick, and it doesn’t take a genius to work out what happens next. He lobs it at Tony, who moves his shoulder slightly to miss the punt.
“If that stupid wizard hadn’t of given up the Time Stone, Thanos would never have made it to Earth. One life for billions, Rhodey, how can I ever live up to that? It’s my fault. It’s all my fault.”
Anyway, Harley and a big mob of angry people. Nothing good could possibly come from that combination. Tony inhales deeply, trying to get his breathing under control before rounding the corner. The street is thrumming with nervous energy, people pushing and shoving, news outlet vans parked in the middle of the road, people clambering on top of them.
“Sorry, it’s just… Two video game references, from you? I mean that’s Kratos. What happened to the Mechanic I knew and when did he get so cool?”
Honestly, this is going to be the slowest burn to ever burn slow for the Steve/Tony, but I promise, they'll get there!1!
“So you knew! The whole time you knew we were going to lose!?” Tony all but screams into the musty papers, swaying and almost losing his balance. He’s still losing blood, again, right.
The room is well lit and finely decorated. There's not a spec of dust to be found anywhere. The smell of books fills his nostrils, and he almost forgets that there ever was a Hulk sized hole in the neatly patch floor beneath his feet. It's homely, and the aura of arrogance has left with Dr. Strange gone. Tony misses it, even if he hated the demeanor of the man. He misses
“And IF Mr Hotshot over there can get past you, he has my explicit permission to view any files he so wishes, with your parental discretion Ghost.”
Sniffing, Tony staggered to his feet. His sudden motion surprised his only companion, who raised what was presumably an eyebrow at him in question.
“Wong, it’s been a pleasure. Could you portal me up to Stark Industries basement level and then to my super-secret hideout?”
Revolving on his heel, with a box in hand, he heads toward the rock formation he hopes is right. A lot of his decisions are made while drunk; drunk Tony lavished in the idea of a panic room… But bigger. Somewhere untraceable, known only to him. He’d prepared all the measures to ensure that his location couldn’t be narrowed down; had actually patented some of the software he used to do it.
His dream is empty and blank. He should be grateful, probably, that there’s no screaming; no Thanos, or ash nor aliens to be found. Just a simple and absolute darkness. It somehow makes him feel uncomfortable, the world is in pieces and he
“It has become a real issue.” Ghost deadpans, and Tony can’t help the snicker he makes. Ghost could make good news sound bad.
He thought he’d be used to how cool it is to walk through portals by now (for once, not into outer space and impending doom) and yet, the novelty isn’t lost on him. He’s able to get the titanium alloys he needs, along with some more specialist equipment, and move them to his den in one simple throw. It’s a high point of his time back on Earth.
“Thanks buddy,” He takes the cup and goes to drain it, finding it empty. “There was an attempt, I’d probably have done no better,” he shrugs it off, patting Dummy’s head idly and sliding his cup back onto the counter. He really was ridiculously thirsty. The nightmare was still fresh in his mind; he couldn’t bring himself to move, “Think you could try again and actually, I don’t know, put water in it?”
. He was just a kid. Tony would give anything to take his place. He’d been so busy comprehending that Peter was just ash on his sleeves and under his fingernails from where he’d been gripping him so tightly, that when everyone else started to similarly combust, he was consumed by a numbness rather than grief.
He feels the vomit rise before he leans unceremoniously to the side to spew his fancy breakfast with Pepper next to him. Pepper. Poor sweet Pepper who always seemed to be clinging to the idea that Tony could be normal. That he could be a superhero and a husband. She was just as delusional as he is. Idly, he wonders if she’s alive. The nausea creeps back up on him, shortly followed by a cold and overwhelming anger.
He was looking at his tablet with abject curiosity. He’d really created Ghost and wasn’t hallucinating. Incredible.
He threw it at the wall as soon as his conversation with Bruce ended. Why did Tony have to be so damn prideful? Look at what it had cost him, cost
No one wanted to be near Tony Stark for his companionship, he knew that even in his early days. Women would throw themselves at him, but not because he was funny or liked to listen to rock music or could build a robot from scratch using junk from your father’s garage – no. People only ever spoke to him if they wanted something. Knowing him was a trophy, he had one use and that was all.
of his foot. Or his whole foot has become the embodiment of TV static. Quickly brandishing a couple of swears, he cuts and jabs the needle into the other foot as well. Awful stinging begins to rise up his leg and he starts to panic (although Ghost doesn’t say anything) he can thankfully tell after a few moments that they’re moving back down towards his ankle.
Amazed, Tony watches as Thor arranges Rocket on his shoulder, his tail lying limp and scorched down his back. He hands the racoon his gun, which he rests besides Thor’s ear. Seemingly pleased, they leave the room like that together.
Obediently, Dummy beeps a few times. He successfully picks up the tray, without dropping the contents everywhere like Tony expected him to and brings it to the table.
Tony is drowsy. The sensation is throwing him for a loop, and he’s sure that Ghost is still talking but he’s not understanding him properly. It’s getting dark again; the alarm going off in his head is sluggish, the ice-cold fear faltering in his veins. He’s out of time.
“Great, but don’t ever use Dummy like that again. I need to know that I’m me… That it’s my brain in there and I’m the one controlling it ok?”
His mistakes were greater than all the lives that were being lost. He wasn’t strong enough or smart enough to snark or fight his way out of this one. And all that he’s left with is an empty planet filled with his empty thoughts. He wants to scream. He wants to collect what’s left of them into flasks and jars and fix this. But he can’t… He can’t. This is absolute. That much he knows for sure. He can feel it in the hollow of his lung and the marrow of his bones.
. Tony was going to goddamn figure out how to fix this mess just so that he can punch that god-awful wizard in the face himself.
Shaking his head, Tony puts down the pliers. The twinge in his chest is back, and he can hear rather than feel the force with which he’s trying to breathe. It’s one of the moments where he knows there’s an even chance of him having a full-blown attack or just defaulting to his factory settings; through his panic he notices Ghost. He’s learned that about himself, or the AI, that whenever he feels panicked, dimming the lights and playing Pink Floyd in the room helps. He doesn’t know why. Maybe it’s how it amplifies the glow of his bots, his panels, all the things he built himself to make him feel less… Lonely.
“Answer the call G,” He says, his back to the camera, body drifting towards the desk. He shuffles with the petri dishes with the rest of the bots in. “Uh hello?”
Body hitting the floor, he spasms for a minute. The bandage Dummy had dropped a while ago is close by, and he wraps it around his neck. After a minute he takes it off again, there’s no point in choking to death on a bandage; the wound should close itself soon, anyway.
“Ghost, I’ve just read all the Wikihows, seriously? I’m a genius and I’m the most qualified person here, I have to do this.”
Steve half smiles, looking down and shaking his head. “Even you look busy, I should… Let you get back to whatever it is you’re doing.”
He tinkers with the mechanics with a detached precision. Despite the intricacy of his current work his mind continues to wander across his next move here.
How many people does he have to lose, only to see himself come out ok the other side? Why is it always him who wakes up to nothing but grievance; finding out that once again he is truly alone. He’s supposed to be a genius. People needed to stop putting him on such a high pedestal because he did not deserve any of it.
Nebula waits while he gathers his things. It’s like a dream or a movie, the streets vacant and stores closed. He tries to be careful with his steps but inwardly he cringes, he's walking on what's left of people. It's enough to make him want to gag. The screens are not filled with adverts but an immediate press release from the White House. The whole city is much more desolate than he remembers. Bleak. Sad.
He’s a genius, which is accurate, and he’s built more machines (both correctly and incorrectly, but in his opinion if something doesn’t go wrong
Despite all the ways he had tried to distance himself from his father, Wanda’s vision inserts itself into the forefront of his mind. All of his friends, dead. The life he’d built with them – ruined. And it’s not just a horrifying possibility anymore. It’s his reality and just like Howard he dragged everyone he ever loved down with him.
“Mixed signals there buddy,” Tony says, eyes surveying the area. The mood has shifted from violence to passive aggressive slurs and mild defacement of public property, “We need to go.”
He reaches the Palace and is greeted by a guard who looks tired, unwavering on protecting the last Princess. Shuri has been more than hospitable, offering Steve a room and all, however he preferred to find a small place to stay in the city. It was louder down there, the thrums of life evident in the walls and shouts of passing people. He craves those sounds. He can’t stand the silence. One thing that carried him over from the army was comfort in familiar sounds – you were either pressed up against another soldier or lucky enough to get a cot in a room with many others. Nothing is more unsettling than silence, like the echo of the snap, it rips through him with the shockwaves of a blast.
“We’re making slow progress it’s a very delicate procedure, you have been out for an hour Sir. I suggest you take another shot of whisky.” Ghost says finally and Tony is more than happy to oblige with doctor’s orders.
“I’m not part of their ‘team’,” She even air quotes, which would have been hilarious if the pit of Tony’s stomach hadn’t just dropped out, “I don’t have anyone.”
So why’d he go through so much effort over the Accords? Penance. He doesn’t trust himself half the time; he’s notorious for his bad decisions. He shouldn’t have forced it on the rest of the Superhero community, though. They can’t be blamed for his paranoia.
Her smile is rueful, Steve knows her mind is elsewhere. He wonders where Thor will go, what with his people gone and a talking space raccoon glued to his shoulder. Absently, he panics about how to contact him if something big and bad comes to Earth. At this point, Earth is half beat.
Tony tries to sit up, forgetting quite brilliantly that he’s lying on his table like a flayed kebab right now. He yells in pain, wincing at the feel of movement within the wound.
Harley is sitting on the floor, cradling the mask to his face. Quickly marching over, he wrenches the plate away from him.
Sorry this took so long to update, I had to put my dog down two weeks ago and I wasn't doing great. Still not doing great, actually, but this was the first time I felt like writing so, yeah. More of a filler but hopefully more coming quicker after this.
“Jesus,” Tony says, pulling his sunglasses out of his pocket and scanning the crowd. No one seems to have noticed him yet, after all his beard has grown out and he’s in his plain black gym gear. “See him Ghost?”
Picking up the fixed gauntlets, he slides the somewhat botched boots onto his feet. It wasn’t going to be a long flight; his own sanctum wasn’t
In a weird way he preferred the anarchy; if he had nothing to do all he’d have is to sit and think about all he’s lost, from both his past and present life. Having to sort through the mess was time consuming but necessary, with losses for Wakanda taken in all factions. He wished they hadn’t brought the fight here, although he highly doubts they would have fought as valiantly as they did without T’Challa’s help.
He’s been monitoring what’s left of the Avengers near non-stop since their little talk. The room they were situated in must be that of a common room – he’s looked long enough now to see the ornate decoration, the elaborate vases and rugs. It’s beautiful and, although his soul lies dead in his chest, he longs for the warmth that he can see through the giant windows.
On any normal day, Natasha would be impossible to read; Tony’s too exhausted to be looking properly and she’s far too careful with her emotions, however, Tony spots the sadness on her face nonetheless. They’re both getting sloppy.
He shouldn’t really be pushing her, one of these shiny buttons is probably to ‘evacuate your nearest nuisance’. Absently, he wonders how fast they must be flying, and the fact that there is no air resistance or disturbance inside the ship; the pressure and physics of space continue to overwhelm him. Mars. He’s Tony Stark and his inflight experience is watching actual planets roll past his window.
Thank you all for your comments and for reading! I hope you enjoy this chapter, I'll edit the mistakes at some point... Let me know what you think (: (Also my headcannon about Thor and Rocket might turn into fanart at some point, I'll update this box if I add it)
Her voice startles him out of his introspection. The fact that she has bothered to ask him a preference mystifies him a second longer.
He’s not sure how long it will take but at this point is afraid to ask. Nebula, she’d offered over a glance of her shoulder before stalking off away from the battlefields, was her name. Her company has been amiable at best; he doesn’t particularly want to turn this into an episode from a cheap TV show where he’s constantly saying ‘are we there yet?’
Screw all of that God mumbojumbo (the irony that he is personally very close with a God, and has enough evidence to say that Gods, as a whole, exist, isn’t lost on him) with those stones you have everything you need to mess with the universe at a fundamental level. You don’t even have to be a God. I mean certainly, Thanos’ species had an advantage over a comparatively weak body like Tony, but there are no rules here. Thanos’ was just the first guy to think of and succeed in collecting all the stones at once.
“Give it time, G.” Tony ducks under some fallen banners that the demonstrators had hung all over the place.
Desperately, he tries not to picture her final moments. Hands clasped tight around the phone that she is certain he won’t call her on but finds comfort in hoping anyway. The brown Louis Vuitton shoes that were her favourites tapping restlessly on his marble flooring. Her brow creased in a frown, the piece of hair that she keeps trying to tuck behind her ear; the inner of her lip that she bites when she’s frustrated.
Pepper deserves to be happy. And dealing with Tony’s shit? Thinking that the next fight could be his last, not knowing whether he’ll be diving into an interdimensional wormhole or boarding a massive alien ship and disappearing just when the world needed him most… It’s a life best lead solitary. Solitary is an old friend to Tony, at least.
The curtains are open in the room, the sun bright and cascading long shadows across the table in the centre. He takes a seat, hard. The weight of being Captain America is crushing him now, he still hasn’t completely found the switch to just being Steve. Bucky knew it; he could perform every button press and shutdown sequence without having to ask at all. Tony could, too.
Amanda passes under the demigod’s arm, as well, biting into her lower lip to hold in her snort of laughter.
He walks the miles to the hospital. There are less and less people gathered at the hospital doorsteps as the days go by, though no less things. Steve makes sure none of them notice him. He doesn’t think he can handle any well-meaning wishes right now.
“You really think anyone could have payed off Strong for something like that?” Natasha retorts, a thin-edge to her voice. “Much less, do you think Tony would have gone along with it, after everything that’s happened?”
“Still good,” Tony affirms―less of a lie now that his own mother has successfully managed to up his adrenaline for the foreseeable future. He pats the abandoned space next to him. “Mom, please, can you―please leave Steve alone and come sit here before you give me a heart attack.”
It’s Carol, worried over Tony’s unsteady condition, that finds the note, mere moments after Tony has already disappeared beyond the atmosphere.
All of his assets were seized―including the remainder of his armours―forcing anyone remotely associated with Tony to either go into hiding or face Osborn’s deranged wrath.
Stark!” Osborn’s voice booms. He’s advancing again on the prone figure, his voice rising and rising in deranged fervour.
Bucky hefts the shield off his back. “We’ve got this,” he asserts and launches the shield with the full strength behind his left arm. The vibranium sings as it slices through the air―and straight through the chains holding Steve down.
This is the first time Steve has been able to muster enough courage―to down enough of his pride, if he is being brutally honest with himself―to begin unraveling all of the tangled thoughts and memories in his head.
There was a situation like this long ago, Steve remembers, when they were all first aboard the helicarrier.
“I was mildly joking when I said he needs a man like you―clearly, I’ve seen nothing yet,” Amanda interrupts. The rest of the room, for the most part, have gone back to not-staring, but she makes no pretense otherwise. She’s openly staring at the pair with surprised, startling blue eyes.
And now it’s too late. He can’t take Tony back, not with Osborn running the show and the entire world out for his head. Nonetheless, Steve understands with a keen dread, the danger could be just as great if Tony were to stubbornly continue his chosen exile.
“Allow her time,” was all Thor murmured, carefully setting the attaché of vials into Steve’s numb hands. “And express my regret for my harshly spoken words to our friend.”
He presses them ever closer, feels the warmth and solidness of the other man’s body―and something round and metallic digs into his sternum. Steve has half a moment of panic before he remembers: the RT. Tony’s new heart.
Tony’s eyes are just as blue as he remembers them. “They wouldn’t let me see you,” he says as if that is enough of an explanation, his voice a shaky croak of breath. He looks tired enough to collapse.
This chapter weaves in and out of present and past tense. I wanted it to sort of follow Steve's jumbled thoughts, and I can only hope I accomplished that LOL.
There is a deep, furrowed ‘v’ in the set of Tony’s brows. “I could never hate you,” he says, his voice hoarse and almost whisper-soft. Amidst Steve’s little speech, he had lowered his sole free hand to instead grasp at his trapped elbow, holding himself tightly enough through the blanket as if he could physically impede the shudders running through his body. He stares down at Steve now like this, with those eyes inlined by a miserable red. “I could never hate you, Steve,” he reiterates, and the way he says it is as if he means something else entirely.
“I know,” Steve soothes, and Tony thinks, secretly, that it really shouldn’t be so soothing. “It’s okay, Tony.”
Tony had said it so flippantly that Steve had thought it arrogance, yet all it had been was a statement of fact. Steve rubs the side of his face, as if that would ease the fatigue of carrying a mountain of guilt. How many times did any one of the Avengers think Tony arrogant when the pure opposite was in play?
” he roars, a battle cry that resonates through the forests of Wakanda. The Hulk stumbles at first, tripping over an armored leg still wrapped around his flesh. He tears it apart with scrambling fingers. He stumbles again, free, and his fist pounds on the earth. He gets one foot under him and then the other.
He took a repulsor to the chest for his efforts on that first day he had broken into the fort. It might not have blown a hole through his body like he knows it could have, but it sure as hell did more than
Steve isn’t the sighing type, but he finds it hard in that moment to withhold one. He stands and offers a hand. “Come on,” he says into the settling silence. “Let’s move you to bed.”
It takes him three tries to get the comm link on, his hands shaking too badly for the sensor to get a proper read. A burst of static greets his ear. His last source of hope. “Avengers,” he says into the echoing space of the quinjet. His voice is a hoarse mess, lacking the usual sureness with which he barks orders during missions. “Avengers, come in. This is―this is Steve Rogers, requesting”
Steve startles awake, reaches for his shield and then remembers he gave it to Bucky. Bucky deserves the shield more than he does. He marches down the hallway, doesn’t care that whoever is there can probably hear the heavy fall of his footsteps. It’s probably Clint again, he tells himself; he’s found the archer rummaging through his fridge on more than one occasion.
And in the face of Tony’s misery, Steve finds a calmness. There is a simple answer to Tony’s question, an undeniable truth that the universe itself cannot deny. “You know why.”
Steve feels pathetically useless as he stands there like a dolt. The only time Tony allows contact is right before he’s about to fall asleep or when he’s too unconscious to consent to Steve carrying him to and fro places. This is neither one of those times.
“Hush, you,” she gentles. “You did everything right and everything you could. All you need to do now is rest and gain your strength back. You leave the plummeting of that Thanos son of a bitch to me, you hear?”
Steve eyes Tony with admitted weariness until the other man gives in with a roll of the eyes and pokes a finger at his own temple rather tellingly.
S.H.I.E.L.D., frettingly wondering over the whereabouts of its current Director, was able to place a trace on the repulsor technology, which had shown a clear trajectory into outer space. From there, it had been up to Colonel Rhodes to pinpoint the not-so-logical conclusion that Tony has been secluding himself on a fort he had built on the Moon some years ago.
“‘Uce…” Tony breathes; his eyes are glassy and fever-bright. He’s on his right side, his left arm being held up over his torso by a scrubbed-down Rhodey. “D’t’urts.”
Steve flexes his fists and watches Tony pant wetly into the blankets like he just ran three marathons back to back. Tony’s forehead is lolling against his covered arm in that telltale way that tells Steve he’s dizzy enough to become sick.
as he desperately presses his ear to Tony’s chest. The blood rushing in his ears is so loud it takes him several tries before he’s able to discern that that soft pitter-patter of a beat is Tony’s heart struggling to find a steady rhythm. The fact that Tony is still shallowly breathing is the only thing keeping him from falling head first into sheer, dread-induced panic.
The action catches his breath in his throat. “I’ve missed you,” Steve confesses, soft and fervent. “Every day, every hour. I can’t think about anything but you, even when I’m dreaming.”
She, along with several others, have been taking refuge in Tony’s scattered bunkers, moving from place to place every several hours like hunted animals. Steve had only just found out about the situation this morning, when call after call started bombarding his comm line while the group caught a small reprieve.
Carol had been standing, still in the tatters of the day’s battle, waiting―shamelessly eavesdropping―until the meeting had concluded. Arms folded over her chest, eyes red rimmed, and expression thundering. She had a white card, thick and small like that of a business card, held tersely between the fold of two fingers.
after all of the bad blood between us, all of the fighting, after the last time you and everyone else turned their backs on me. And I was fine then―I
,” Blue Lady snarls. Her impatience is edged and jaded. She snatches up one of Tony’s arms, forces him up to his feet. “We leave.
no matter how much you or anyone else tried to talk some sense into me. There’s―there is a difference between standing up for what’s right and being belligerent, and I know which side I fell on. You deserve a better friend than I’ve been, Tony. You really do.”
“It’s easy,” Bucky Barnes says. “Stark made the O.S. to be near-intuitive. Feel where you want to go, and it’ll take you.”
Tony’s eyelids flutter shut, and Steve reaches for his phone. He gets the feeling Rhodes will tear him a new one if he finds Tony’s hospital bed suddenly empty.
even as his eyes welled and overflowed with tears. “Fuck, Cap,” he said, between heaving for breath his sobs and laughter barely left, “if that’s your worst, then you’re a fucking
Tony’s hair has been allowed to grow out again, and it splays out in a halo of dark waves against the white of the pillowcase. Even in his sleep, Tony looks washed out and clammy, though there are no dark circles under his eyes and his fever relentlessly burns bright. Yet, even like this, he’s easily the prettiest man Steve has ever seen, all high cheekboned and sharp-jawed. He recalls Jan once said that Tony was
Lila, who had so far been utterly entranced by the goings-on up on screen, frowns between Clint and Natasha. “What happened to Uncle Tony?”
Steve managed the dregs of a smile. “Tell him yourself,” he replied, trying for a joke that fell flat, “when he gets back home.”
“I believe you know what I will say,” Amanda says, her voice dangerously cool. She’s standing right under Steve’s nose, her chin tilted up―and, for all that she’s but a few inches shorter than Tony, she might as well have been twice as large as Steve himself. “I understand mishaps, Captain Rogers―I am intimately familiar with doing wrong to someone who should never be wronged―but I will
It’s like Tony can’t help himself, as if he has to leap at every opportunity to invalidate his value to others. It frightens him to the core that Tony has this darkness inside himself that lets him believe he’s someone that doesn’t deserve to be saved. To be loved and cherished. To be mourned if―God forbid―anything were to happen to him.
“My boy,” the woman breathes, and it is obvious to everyone in the room that her voice has become thick with tears. She’s careful with all of the lines running from Tony’s body as she takes her place besides Tony on the large bed. Carefully, with reverence, she cradles one of Tony’s hands in one of hers, and it is only because of this that Thor does not haul her away. “I thought you were dead.”
Rhodey hefts a package. “One of the Doras dropped it off―I’m still surprised they don’t have jello around here.”
There’s a brief flit of piano keys. The spotlight begins to illuminate the lone figure before the black instrument.
Other times, it makes him want to do the supersoldier equivalent of slamming his head against the nearest wall.
Thor’s eyes flit across the surroundings, observing for intruders, before he takes Stormbreaker and leaves her, guarding, before the set of the double doors.
“But it’s the only way?” Rhodey prods. He cards his fingers again through the increasingly wetter strands of hair, trying, in whatever small way he can, to keep Tony’s mind off of the massive pain he must be in. “Who called the shots?”
And, with that realization, he feels himself crumble under the weight of the world―his body folds over Tony’s unconscious form until his forehead comes to rest, consciously lightly, onto the center of Tony’s chest.
in that grey suit,” Clint summarizes to Laura later that night, tucking in the corner of the blankets around Lila. “It’s those damn high heels he wears, I tell you.”
Dammit. “He passed out,” he confirms aloud to himself. The words seem to echo back at him in the thin silence of the room.
Bruce goes taut with tension. “Tony, I know this is really hard for you right now, but I need you to
“They’re thinking of moving him out of ICU by the end of the week, if he continues to show improvement,” Tony’s day nurse, Theo, tells him.
He delicately brushes stray strands of hair away from Tony’s face. That small touch is enough to know Tony’s fever hasn’t gone anywhere, though there’s small hope in the fact that it has not risen either. It scares him, sometimes, despite Richards’ platitudes, the waves of heat pouring off of Tony, the way they seem to ravage him of strength.
He coerces himself to draw a calming breath as he reaches up to his ear to cut off the two-way communication from the comm. “Tony,” he says, “for god’s sake―” It comes out more harshly than he intends, but he can’t find it in himself to apologize either. He doesn’t know how many times he has to tell Tony how desperately he cares for his well being, for Tony himself, before it’ll sink into his thick skull.
His words seem to fall on deaf ears. “I don’t know what I’ll do,” Peter confesses, his voice wretchedly whisper-soft, “if Tony doesn’t survive this.”
―that Tony had never fought to kill during their altercations. The same could not be said for Steve.
Unstrapped as the guitar was, Tony holds the instrument at his side like a stand-in person and takes a bow to the hoarsely screaming crowd.
Spider-Man glances nervously at Barnes. “How do you know so much about quinjets? Is it, like, some secret super spy thing that they teach at the super secret, super spy school? ‘Cause I heard what you said, and I’m still not following.”
“I dreamt about you,” Tony returns. His lashes are fluttering, the spark in his eyes fading with sleep. “Every damned day on that hospital bed.” He jerks slightly, trying to stay awake. “Don’t take me back there,” he pleads.
Apparently, Extremis intakes an overload of information that likes to divulge riddled messages to Tony in the form of
They watch the soft orange lights of the city for several quiet moments, the occasional car that drives by. It’s quieter, somewhat, than the heart of Manhattan. Steve still misses the Fifth Avenue mansion.
But he’ll be damned if he can’t give the man some ease of conscience, at the very least. There’s love for Tony in his heart still, despite their disagreements, even if he knows that it will never be reciprocated. He…
Osborn’s head whips to the side, but the bullet has done nothing more than make a barely visible indentation. It’s enough of a distraction.
“They wouldn’t let me see you,” Tony says again, staring up at him from his supine form on the covers.
He steps unto the bowels of the quinjet, and Tony’s eyes fall shut in resignation. The rest of him seems to follow suit, going utterly limp in Steve’s arms. It’s heartbreaking―it
Bruce takes the opportunity to lean over Steve and snatch up the IV-connected hand. He injects some ccs into the line, much to Tony’s displeasure. “You know, when you do that, you sound like a cat,” he informs the man.
to give Tony what he wants. Everything Tony dreams of, everything he had sung for in his song in haunting, pain-wrought tones―he wants to give Tony
! It really was a joy to write this, and I really couldn't have expected all of the love I received for this! Thank you to everyone for all of your support!
Thor nods his head. “A pleasure, Lady Strong. You’ll forgive me if I don’t offer a more proper greeting.”
” his voice rises higher, closing his eyes as the song seems to sweep through him. The camera is close enough now to count the many lashes that cast faint, red-tinted shadows over his cheeks. “
But the staff sympathize with him. They give him bits and pieces of updates, but they ultimately still send him home, tell him they will call if Tony wakes up and asks for him. The director wouldn’t refuse Steve entry then, they assure.
Steve’s heart seizes. “Jesus, Tony.” He’s on his knees in less than a second flat, sinking his hand through sweaty locks of hair as he guides Tony to bury his face between the juncture of his shoulder and neck. Like this, it’s easy to feel the heat radiating off of Tony, the vibrating tautness in his bunched and strained muscles. “It’s okay,” he haltingly soothes as the collar of his shirt starts going damp; “it’s okay, Shellhead.”
Steve has a half-second to panic before he feels Tony’s arms come up in what is quite clearly an embrace. His heart thuds faster at the realization. This isn’t the first time that Tony has consciously sought out physical comfort, but very few other times has it felt as intimate as this.
He coughs with the pain and curls tighter and tighter around the arm wrapped around his waist. It hurts like a sonuvabitch. Yet nothing can compare to the pain in his chest, the ache in his left arm as his breath tries to seize and stutter with every strained beat of his heart.
“That’s―all right,” the woman replies. The lilt of her tongue, different as it to what he has accustomed to hearing, is almost surprising. “I’m here to see my son.”

,” Tony says, strained. His breath, rapid, is fogging up the mask over his face. “C’ll’me doucheb’g. N’e
A H.A.M.M.E.R. quinjet had been parked by the eastmost hangar, right next to an old S.H.I.E.L.D.-issue Avenjet, recognizably Stark's design; they had to go the long way and descend at the westmost hangar in order to not attract attention. Space was silent, but human eyes weren’t. They had crossed through the base, past the evidence of recent inhabitation―afghans and coffee cups and a random slipper―towards the muffled sounds of a commotion, of two men screaming and the thuds of a body.
Bruce looks up again, but he’s still not familiar enough with the man to understand what that blank expression means. “Rhodes?”
Disaster strikes a few days later when they receive news from Earth: Norman Osborn, under the directive of the President, has taken over the command of S.H.I.E.L.D.
It is more than a gross oversight on his part. Because now? Now, this could very well cost Tony’s life. It’s too little, too late to go back and change the past, and the nearest help is over two hundred thousand miles away.
This is the first step, he thinks as he watches Tony’s drawn face ease for the first time today. It’s not much, but, the more Tony chooses to interact with his friends―people who genuinely care about Tony, like Pepper Potts and Rhodes and Carol―the more Steve hopes Tony will see that all is not lost. That he still has a life―a
He rushes forward, swoops Tony into his arms as tightly as he dares. He buries his face in Tony’s shoulder and inhales deeply. There’s a strong whiff of antiseptic, but, just under there, a smell unlike no other.
Steve can only think that this should be Tony’s job. Tony was the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.; Tony even somehow managed to get Dugan to like him.
“What? It’s a fair question. I’ll say it again: You do look like shit.” He jerks his thumb over his shoulder at Thor, the latter of which has been standing like a sentry by the room’s entry with the pile of gifts still in his arm. “I’ve got some stuff from my kids that they wanted me to bring for you. It was a pain in the ass to hall all the way from Iowa, but it can wait if you’re not up for it.”
He wants to be there, he wants to protest. He wants to be there if Tony starts to wake up. He needs to be there.
Steve’s eyes lower to the floor, away from that piercing gaze, and Tony huffs an exasperated breath that somehow dispels the moment.
“Budge over, Miss Strong,” Natasha says, as casual as you please, having been done with rummaging through the mound of presents like a curious cat. “I need to record his face for later use as blackmail.”
Tony’s eyes fill with tears. “I wanted to―” He cuts himself off abruptly, wrenches his face away from Steve’s over his. It does nothing to hide the tears as they begin to fall, silently one after the other across the bridge of his nose and down to soak into the sheets. “Why weren’t you there?”
, hey,” Rhodey rushes to soothe, rubbing at Tony’s temple with a circling thumb. “No freaking out on me, okay? You really need to keep still.”
Just the thought of the man dead in a ditch somewhere―thank you, Tony, for that visual―has cold fear crawling through his veins, overrunning his heart with forceful palpitations.
Steve tells himself that he has no right to mourn the loss of the brief contact. He doesn’t take it personally, however; Tony can’t take invasions of space the majority of the time, claustrophobia warring at its best. “Tony―”
Tony sighs, heavy and warm into his mask. The pained frown over his visage slowly disappears as he falls deeper into unconsciousness.
“Director Osborn, sir, we’re approaching jump-drive speeds,” Agent Gormley says. “The infiltrators are being apprehended as we speak.”
Of all the things he thought to bring, an AED was the last thing on his mind. It should have been the first thing he thought about, he screams at himself,
with a suit of armor that’s shot to hell. It doesn’t matter that he fought with the best of them and somehow ended up vertically on his own two feet.
“No!” Clint shouts back. “And stop yelling, or you’ll wake up the small one!” No one bothers to point out the hypocrisy.
Peter is sitting on his apartment rooftop one night. Steve goes up the three flights of stairs to join him.
Steve sits carefully, feeling overly clumsy and large as he tries not to snag on something important―much less jostle Tony as he settles down. He presses his palm to Tony forehead and tries not to feel pleased when Tony allows the contact with barely a huff. He drags that hand down, feeling at clammy cheeks, and then closer down to feel at Tony’s pulse. “You feel a little warm, still,” he concludes. He tries not to squirm, uncomfortable, when he notices all of the eyes of the room’s occupants are staring in his direction. “Want some water? Ice chips?”
Bucky starts to walk him to and fro the hospital. He says he’s stretching his legs a bit. It’s a small bit of good that he has back. That he has Bucky back.
He leaves in the quiet of the night, through the same broken window of Jessica Jones’ desperation, with nothing but a note left on the kitchen island for Jarvis to find in the morning.
“Having your whole world turned upside down again―in the span of a year―” Sam says. “Especially in the way he did...Stark is a tough son of a bitch, I’ll give him that.”
It’s the wrong thing to say. Hulk turns the arm holding Tony close away and leans forward, looming his face close to Natasha’s. She doesn’t flinch, but he can smell the fear off of her. He pokes her shoulder with a thick finger, and she stumbles back, more startled than hurt. “Hulk know what Spider did.” He rises, folds his free arm back around his charge. “Hulk know what ‘Vengers did. Tin Man
And he never got to look Steve Rogers in the eye one last time. To hear his voice. To feel his presence.
Tony’s answering smile is tremulous. “I may want to throw something at you,” he acquiesces. He shivers violently, the metal of the cuff rattling against the frame of the sidearms. And, as if that had been a signal, what little strength he had been carrying through sheer force of will appears to slough off him by the second. “I’m...I’m, uh, pretty sure the―the thing, w’th th’...medical attention...z’, uh…”
Um. I'll, uh...go hide in the corner and pretend that this didn't take me literal months to crank out...
“We heard you the first five thousand times, Clint!” Natasha snaps. The man trapped between her thighs gurgles for air; she twists upside-down, her hold a steady trap, and uses the momentum to launch the man at the woman coming around the corner with her gun raised. Both topple into a tangled heap. “Osborn left sometime in the morning; one guess where he’s headed.”
They all come together back  in the same lab Princess Shuri had been trying―unsuccessfully―to separate the Vision from the Mind Stone. It’s been less than half a day, yet it feels like forever ago.
It is a useless endeavour―until Thor takes up the other end of the ship and grinds it, Hulk and all, to a stop mid-air.
Under his palm, Tony’s heart is galloping at an irregular staccato, thudding and fluttering in odd terms. His blood isn’t pumping right, as if the muscles of his heart were―
, he read and understood, finally, with a cold, sinking feeling, what these wars had driven Tony Stark to.
of red blood seeping between the man’s fingers. “If Thanos had wanted you dead, you would be. He spared your life.
Bruce’s lips twist wryly. Tony’s life is at stake, but the Other Guy still refused to let anyone but Rhodes near the man in question. There was no convincing and zero compromise. He’s only grateful that Rhodes, after a life spent at Tony’s side, knows just enough about the medical field to be a help rather than a burden―that, and it’s helpful that at least one of the two of them can keep their cool in the face of their friend’s plight.
’―Steve doesn’t think it helps that Tony says it with a flirtatious wink as the camera pans closer. His gaze flits across the televised Tony on the screen, studying the contrast of the red of Tony’s shirt collar against his tan skin, the perfectly trimmed shape of that beard. It’s only natural, from there, for Steve’s eyes to get stuck on the way Tony’s lips move with the song, partially covered by the round head of the microphone.
Thor supposes he makes an alarming figure, slumped as he is on the floor. But this has become his post now, the only thing that has brought purpose to him for the last few weeks. He will guard these doors―the man inside―till he breathes his last breath.
Thor hefts the gifts in his arm, but understands Tony’s meaning when the woman comes forth in the next moment.
Spider-Man bolts forward. His arm thrusts out, webbing and pulling Stark’s body away from the danger. There are streaks of blood where his body drags, dripping down and around cuts and bruises as Spider-Man half-lifts Stark into his arms and hunches over him into a protective stance.
Steve knows now that he isn’t. This can’t be anything but real―any reality otherwise would just be too cruel.
“Hey, Tony,” Clint says, “you know who really loves you?” He proffers the first present and watches with pride and something
“I don’t think I can forgive Tony for what he did,” Peter says quietly. “Even if he was trying to protect me, in his own way.” He turns to look at Steve, gives him a small smile. “But I still care about him.” His smile fades with coming memory, and he turns his head away. “I’ve known Osborn to be a horrible man, but I always thought he’d be my responsibility to deal with. Out of everyone, I never thought Tony would ever get caught in the crossfire. I don’t know why―we cross the same villains all the time―but it caught me off guard. Osborn’s obsession with me, with my identity―”
Tony stares into her obsidian eyes and prays to Thor with all he has that her words bleed true. “Okay,” he sighs. He blinks at the ground, suddenly hazy and numb. “Okay,” he repeats and doesn’t know why.
“Just in time,” Clint replies. He’s dropping each present onto a chair sitting by the bed in a neat, pyramid pile. “You got snacks?”
Steve cradles Tony’s head carefully as he lowers him down unto the copilot’s seat. Tony doesn’t struggle, doesn’t offer even the smallest of protests even as Steve takes his right wrist and tightens a cuff around it. He secures the other empty ring to the left armrest, purposefully making the position a harder one to wiggle out of. He knows Tony, and he wouldn’t put it past him to try something reckless to try to go back―his determination to keep Tony alive and healthy is perhaps only matched by Tony’s adamant reluctance to leave their lunar fort.
“Боже мой,” Natasha breathes, the dread that had been hovering over her shoulders suddenly weighing her down. “Someone get a hold of Carol Danvers. I’ll assemble a secondary team and head out―anyone who isn’t dead or dying can join. Clint, you don’t have a choice; you’re coming with. Widow out.”
It had begun in the quinjet, a mock interview of Osborn where he detailed how he was seconds away from apprehending World’s Most Wanted Tony Stark. Osborn had run through a detailed list of Stark’s supposed character defects but failed to mention what, exactly, his crimes had been other than pissing off Norman Osborn, a fact that had immediately piqued most broadcast stations. The unboarding of the quinjet was uneventful―until they had come upon the scene of Steve Rogers desperately calling for medical assistance over a supine Stark within the bowels of another aircraft. It had stopped the agents in their tracks―the cameraman was able to record their looks of uncertainty thrown at each other―but not Osborn.
All those repugnant mice who call themselves heroes, who hide behind their masks―their identities are
“Yeah, okay,” Tony voices over the sudden stillness of the room. “Can someone restrain my mother before she breaks her hand on Cap’s jaw?”
“Are you listening?” Carol says rather irritably. “If Tony comes back, you’ll be handing Osborn exactly what he wants.”
Carol had to be pulled away to deal with the Osborn situation. It’s just Steve now, with an Avenjet and little more than hope, who was left with the task of convincing Tony to come back home.
“And Osborn won’t see that,” Steve concludes with a sinking feeling. “He’ll figure you have a copy somewhere.”
He gets himself perpendicular to Tony and folds the man’s legs over one of his arms, keeping them raised above Tony’s heart level, and uses his other hand to keep track of the pulse at Tony’s too-thin wrist.
No one asks how he knows; it was Bruce’s voice that rang through the phone, not Tony’s. Tony must have said something before then, and the Hulk had picked up on the rest.
In the next moment, they’re all rushing forward as the Hulk reaches into the ship and begins to slide, delicately, a hand under Tony’s torso.
He brushes the backs of his fingers along the exposed skin of Tony’s neck, careful, and his suspicion is confirmed. Tony’s fever is up again. He tucks his arms closer to himself and grips his wrist tightly, coiled tension running through his body. “Why didn’t you tell me your fever was getting worse?” he demands, though his irritation is belied by how softly he speaks.
“Be nice to the good doctor, Tony,” Rhodey chides. He settles next to Steve with the package of jellos on his lap. “Or I’ll withhold privileges.”
It didn’t take a genius to come to the conclusion that one of the said line of dead people included him. And, true to Tony’s subconscious, which dislikes Tony on a good day, Tony’s hallucination of Steve was little better than abusive, from what he could gather.
“Whoever is giving him his facts is outdated,” Tony explains with tired, dragging vowels. He stops there for a moment, his brows knitting with pain

. Let him understand, to the very core of all that he is, that your life will be his grandest mistake.” She pauses and allows for her words to find purchase amongst the man’s panic. “Your son won’t be forever dead; don’t let his sacrifice be in vain.”
Tony’s lashes flutter, the whites of his eyeballs starting to show as they try to roll back. “Th’nk n’d to...sit d’wn…”
“Need a hand up?” Clint Barton asks but doesn’t offer said proffered hand. Instead, he stands with a bundle of presents in his arms, a petite, elderly woman at his back staring at Thor with something akin to surprise.
Tony groans, both in pain and too overwhelmed to sort through the rattle of his mind. “Don’ know,” he mutters. “S’no’ m’play.”
He packs all of his suit of armors, minus some he leaves to Rhodey and Pepper, leaves the company under Pepper’s name and S.H.I.E.L.D. under Dugan’s, erases the S.H.R.A. database from all servers except the one in his head―and then exiles himself to the dark side of the Moon, where a ready-built mansion-forte lies waiting like the embrace of a coffin.
“Only because you have the worst puppy eyes,” Bruce replies. “The Other Guy was threatening to come out if we didn’t get you some
Guilt aches deep in Steve’s chest. “Tony,” he starts, “they wouldn’t―” There’s no one else to blame. “I’m sorry,” he has to settle on. He means it with every fiber of his being. “I’m so sorry.”
Originally, Amanda (nor Clint, for that matter) was not supposed to be in this part of the series, but she, like Clint, sort of wrote herself in LOL
Tony still refuses to look at him. He shakes his head and, then, in the next moment, turns to cough into the crook of his arm. It’s wet and congested, falling from Tony’s lips one after the other like water cascading down a faucet. Steve can see the way his chest heaves even through the thick blankets, every breath he draws in only stolen for the next bout of coughing.
Now, however, he doesn’t know what he feels, other than a very obvious physical attraction. Everything and anything concerning Tony is too convoluted in a myriad of emotions.
“Ah, what!” Lila interrupts over the noise of the crowd, pointing at the screen. “They skipped over who’s gonna be on the show.”
It quickly devolved from the two Captain Americas fighting back to back in seamless harmony to Steve Rogers fighting like a man possessed in righteous rage. Osborn fell to his knees, and the world held its collective breath.
Steve frowns. In this, he is old hat at reading Tony’s body language―after all, there is nothing more familiar in Tony Stark than Tony Stark’s hate for his own self. Where pride and greed are the downfall in others, this is Tony’s. Unable to see beyond what he has been taught to learn from the earliest of his years. “Hey,” he says gently, gripping onto Tony’s knee, “whatever you are thinking right now? I can tell you you’re wrong. I hate what I did to you, that I’ve turned my back on you on the times when I should have offered a helping hand the most, and I hate even more that I’ve been part of the role that drove you all the way out here. I―I was so angry―I was
He tells himself it’s for the best―there will be no one to cry at his deathbed on Earth, either way. At least, on the Moon, he will die surrounded by his inventions rather than in a cold, white medical ward where his wrists are shackled to the bed’s railing and no one can hear the last of his wheezing breaths.
Fallon is not the only one astounded by that titbit of information. That can’t be right. After several years living together, Steve thinks he would have noticed a talent like that. “
Last week, Carol―surprisingly accompanied by Thor, of all people―came to drop off the antivirus Richards and McCoy had managed to concoct in the short time they had. Their rather unannounced visit―which Steve later realized was a complete error of judgement―had spurred a panic attack so strong that it wasn’t until four days ago that Steve finally managed to pry Tony away from the safety of his lab.
Sharon tells him to get a grip. He’s the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. now. He has missions to run, people to keep safe.
’ he mouths back and then returns his attention to the screen to purposefully miss the subsequent, silent insults being thrown his way.
He doesn’t know if it’s the headache that Tony’s been clearly nursing or genuine annoyance that makes Tony glare. “It’s a joke, Steve,” he snaps back, yet he doesn’t get up to leave like he would have a few weeks ago.
She nods decisively, an action so akinly similar to Tony it almost startles him. “Good.” She drags him down, then, with a hand at the back of his neck―and

Bucky punched him square in the face; Osborn toppled backwards, unconscious. “Sorry,” he said, entirely unrepentant, “his voice was grating on my ears.”
“I’m sorry, Mister Rogers,” the doctor says again. “We really won’t know until the swelling in his brain goes down. He’ll always have to rely on the RT node in order to breathe and for his heart to keep beating, among other things; when he was infected with that―virus.” She waves a vague hand in the air. “Well, the antivirus they gave him managed to stop the virus in its track, but it still made a lot of damage to his medulla oblongata, at that connection port he has at the base of his head. He might have been suffering migraines due to all of the strange activity he was getting from the damaged organ, may even have fainted. Any stress would have surely exacerbated his symptoms. It doesn’t help that his body would have felt like it was still under attack, so to speak; that’s probably why he developed a fever despite not being physically ill. There’s also a lot of evidence for myocardial stress in the EKG we’ve been getting; he’s scheduled for an ultrasound if his heart rhythm doesn’t improve within the next days or so. But all of that doesn’t even take into account the trauma he’s received. If―if Mister Stark pulls through this, he’ll need a lot of physio, maybe even someone to help him with daily tasks.”
Bruce presses his palm over Tony’s forehead, willing the man to keep fighting. “Don’t give up on me now, Tony. Don’t give up on me.”
was balanced on a precipice: Tony might not remember things, remember people. He may never be able to move properly, if at all. He might not be able to speak or even breathe without the machine down his throat. Maybe he would change and no longer be
Steve mouth snaps shut at her tears, how desperate she is trying to hold back all of those pent up emotions. He gives her the moment she doesn’t ask for.
It’s all kinds of fucked up, Bruce thinks, that this is the moment the Hulk decides to show up. Violently. The suit, half-trashed as it was, turns into scrap metal in two seconds flat.
“Let the invalid be, Clint,” Natasha says with a disinterested air that says she is really, very much
Tony jerks his knee back and away. He still hasn’t looked at Steve again, prefering to stare at a point beyond Steve’s shoulder.
He hadn’t been fast enough, strong enough, smart enough to protect his best friend, his partner in all the ways that mattered. He’d let himself be blindsided by Osborn through his grief and guilt of not doing something sooner, even when all the warning signs had been there.
If he had stood by Tony’s side. If he had acted sooner. If he had trusted better. If he’d been a better friend. If he’d been less stubborn. If he’d listened to Tony more.
Steve wisely doesn’t comment that, short of an apocalypse, Tony wouldn’t come back even if there weren’t a manhunt for his head underway. “I know, Carol,” he replies with patience he doesn’t feel. “We’d be playing right into Osborn’s hands and doing no one any favours.”
Stark’s body, kicked with the epic strength of an Iron Man suit, slams into the metal wall with a sickening thud and crumbles into a beaten heap at its base.
“S’rry,” Tony slurs wetly with hiccuping breaths. He doesn’t stop apologizing, quacking with how desperately he’s trying to regain his self-control. “‘Ll stop in’sec; I’ll stop, ’swear.”
So far, tomorrow marks the second week since Steve has been here, secluded on the Moon with Tony. It’s been over a month since anyone has so much as laid eyes on Tony, beyond on the brief video call Steve had with Reed Richards and Hank McCoy regarding Tony’s condition, though not for lack of trying.
Blake, dutifully already strapped in with the large tote of medical equipment on his lap, gives Spider-Man a wary eye. “Just don’t throw up on me.”
It doesn’t matter that it was Tony who single-handedly brought back all of the people the Skrulls had kidnapped. It doesn’t matter that the virus that infected all of his systems was not of his doing. It doesn’t matter that he has fought until he
Tony stares at her for a beat. “You are cruel.” It comes out more moan-y than he’d like, what with his weak voice, but it prompts Steve to drift to the other side of the bed.
They’re watching one of the few channels they get signal for all the way out here in the middle of Nowhere, U.S.A., though none of them truly seem to mind anyway. It’s late, the last of NBC’s nightly news already over and gone.
and Steve has always had trouble trying to refute that―he’s never seen eyelashes like Tony’s even on a woman.
, he thought, because that’s what he deluded himself into thinking the whole Civil War was: Tony Stark’s cold, calculated pettiness.
hey, hey,” he cups his hand along the curve of his jaw, trying to hold him up, and taps lightly at his cheek with the other, “Tony, stay with me. What’s―what’s wrong? C’mon, don’t do this―”
“Yeah,” Clint says, as if the fact that Thor is sitting on the floor like a loyal guard dog makes that debatable. He gestures behind himself, at the woman, as well as he can, what with the entourage of gifts he brings. “This is Amanda Strong―Armstrong, whatever.”
He brushes away some wisps of hair from Tony’s face, presses the backs of his fingers to Tony’s cheek to gauge his fever. “Go back to sleep, Tony.”
He thought he’d already felt the worst of the pain of his guilt. It is nothing in the face of seeing the sheer despair on Tony’s expression, the layers of hurt brimming in his reddened eyes.
Amanda rolls her eyes, but she obliges, nonetheless. “So dramatic, Tony. I’ve no idea where you get that from.”
Bruce comes over, checking over wires and tubes and monitors, as Thor leans closer into Rhodey’s space with a hopeful look to steal some of the sweets. “Has he moved?” he asks the room at large. “I’d really rather not have to stitch you up again.”
disinterested. “He’ll bust a stitch again, and then we’ll have the Hulk making a scene at the Wakandan royal palace.
And, sure enough, Bruce comes down from the transformation freaking out. “What―what just happened. Did I kill anyone? Oh, my god, is that Tony?”
Bruce’s eyes lose their focus from their work, flitting over briefly to Rhodes and then to the monitors. Neither have changed. “Tell me he passed out.”
Also, curious to know what Amanda means about being proud about Peter? Check out the upcoming part of the series, where we regress a bit back in time! It's already in the writing process, so, hopefully, it will be posted soon!
The hospital staff sends him away every day. Sometimes it’s the same anesthesiologist that had been in the operating room with Tony, sometimes one of the nurses. Yesterday, it had been the surgeon herself.
He rubs the heel of his palm, ever so gently, into the tense muscles directly below Tony’s shoulder blades and is gratified when the tension slowly starts to leak from the man’s body right along with his calming sobs.
Post-mission and post thirteen months after what has been dubbed by the media as the Avengers’ ‘Civil War,’ what has remained of the team is crowded around Barton’s TV. It’s safer here, in their own backyard, where the governments of the world would be least likely to search for them. Where it’s closer to Tony, should the man call. If he’ll ever call.
He’s stuck on a fucked up planet with a fucked up gravity and a fucked up moon―a moon that had tried its damned best to squash him like an itty-bitty bug.
There’s only so much patience to be had in the face of his worst nightmare come to life. “Yeah? Where to, sweetheart? In case you haven’t taken a
“...contacts at S.H.I.E.L.D. have been saying that Osborn has been practically dying to get his hands on a copy of the S.H.R.A. database,” Carol is saying when he turns the two-way link back on. “Of course, anyone who knows anything knows that Tony erased all of the copies when he went off-world. Though, I’ll bet he still has one floating somewhere―”
The doorsteps to the hospital get swarmed by people. Every night, they hold a vigil, waiting for a word that Tony was still alive. They leave gifts, flowers, and cards; Steve keeps the ones written and drawn by children. He knows how much Tony loves kids, that it would mean so much more to him than a teddy bear or dying flowers. There are the protestors, too, of course, the same ones that accused Tony of being the devil’s spawn during what has been coined as the “Civil War,” courtesy of Ben Urich. Those voices are quickly drowned out by their opposers, the people who call Tony an innocent man, a heroic man.

Thor settles the ship Hulk-first and allows for the Hulk, in turn, to settle the ship onto the soil. The movement is surprisingly gentle―less a bull in a china shop and more a large dog that doesn’t know its size.
“Walk me through it again,” Donald Blake demands. “Thor’s memories and actually putting it into action are two very different things.”
“Go back to sleep,” he promises instead. He brushes aside Tony’s longer fringe, presses a soft kiss to his forehead. His skin is warm. No fever. He feels cool now, after the sense memory of too-hot flesh. “I’ll be here.”
Fallon tries to speak over the crowd, jaunting quickly to meet Tony at the center of stage. They shake hands, Tony with an easy smile and Fallon ready to fall head over heels.
“I’m sorry, Mister Rogers,” the doctor says again, and there are tears gathering in her eyes. It was the first time she had seen what sometimes dragged in her patients, live on television, she had confessed earlier. There’s a sort of shellshock to people like her after violence unfolds, Steve has seen, to people who actually give a damn. “I really am.”
Steve doesn’t hesitate to scoop Tony into his arms, to walk them into Steve’s bedroom and settle Tony on Steve’s unmade bed.
Hulk picks Tony up like a limp ragdoll, the latter’s body folding with the gentle movements. His head lolls, his neck loose, so Hulk runs a careful finger under the man’s head and accommodates it at the crook of his massive arm. He cradles Tony’s unconscious body like this, holding him close to his chest, and then runs the back of a knuckle softly over blood-crusted skin―Tony’s alive and breathing, the most beautiful thing the Hulk has seen since a time too long. His lips twist with displeasure.
here Steve is dragging Tony back to all of his abundant nothing for the sake of even a glimmer of a chance of offering Tony a better hope for survival than here on the Moon, where Steve had only been able to manage the symptoms until he
The stab wound is thin and long, clean at the edges like it’s been done with something laser-sharp. There are metal particles―
He reaches twice for Tony’s shoulder before he manages to summon the wherewithal to place his hand on Tony’s free, blanket-covered arm instead. “Hey,” he nudges gently, settling on his knees before Tony’s spot on the couch.

He’s shaking, trembling so badly his teeth are chattering. His skin is shimmering with a layer of sweat, so pale his flesh looks paper-thin.

Steve doesn’t bother to reply; the protest is a familiar one. He slides his arms under Tony’s shoulders and the back of his knees and lifts him up against his chest. The blanket is dragging along the floor, probably picking up some dust, but Steve only focuses on moving quickly, setting his jaw in determination―Tony is deteriorating much more quickly than expected. To hasten, despite any impediments in the form of one highly stubborn, fever-driven man, seems to be the only logical course of action.
He can’t chance giving Tony any of the sedatives he has in stock, not with the uneven flutter of his heart.
He takes his time packing the few things he’ll need―clothes, medicine, the bare essentials―and loads it all up onto the quinjet. After a moment’s thought, as he stands there looking down at the few duffle bags in a corner by the back, he decides to take the liberty of also bringing the few things that he thinks Tony would like as a means for entertainment, but leaves everything else.
The corner of Tony’s mouth twitches minutely, unrecognizable unless one is looking for it―and Steve is; he knows how uncomfortable Tony gets with genuine praise. “
Osborn stood over the two prone figures. “Captain America,” he’d said, face masked by the metal armour, “you’re under arrest.” He snapped two fingers. “Agent Gormley, get this man in chains. He’s complicit in whatever
He knew this was coming―he has been waiting for this since the moment he revealed his identity to the world.
The entirety of the world became witness to Osborn proceeding to beat the living shit out of Stark as each shouted word went unheard, as each punch and kick went unfelt. None of the agents nor the cameraman stepped in to stop the madman. None of them moved when Steve woke up and began to thrash in his bonds, when Steve’s voice became louder than the violence unfolding before the world.
Natasha is undeterred. “That’s okay, Big Guy. You can keep him safe; I just want to see him. I haven’t seen Tin Man in a long time.”
But there was no farce. It had been obvious from the start, especially when Stark failed to react when a two-hundred-plus weight had toppled over him. It became even more obvious when Osborn kicked Stark in the side, and the man’s limbs haphazardly rolled with the momentum. It became horrifying when Osborn picked Stark up by the strands of his hair―the latter but a limp, pale ragdoll―and yelled in his face.
―” She cuts herself off as her anger bleeds over into gathering tears. Her face heats, and she bites, hard, at her bottom lip.
Danvers gives a tight nod. Her right fist clenches and unclenches, the tendons springing into sharp relief behind her gloves. Hill knows the power behind one of those―she fears for the poor sucker who gets stuck on the business end of one of them.
“You have no right,” she continues, softly enough to almost be a whisper. “You’re my friend, too, Steve; I’ve always looked up to you―but, god, what the hell were you thinking? He gave
Steve tries to contain his glee when Tony flaps a hand in the direction of Steve’s ear, but something on his face must have given him away going by the way Tony rolls his eyes good-naturedly.
“You’ll damn them all,” Tony interrupts. There is firmness even in the fragility of his voice. And an ever-growing desperation. “This is why I left. This is why I kept everyone at an arm’s length, why I―” He breaks off abruptly, breathing heavily. His chest rises and falls sharply with exertion as he stares down at the man kneeling before him. “I
“Uhh,” Bruce stutters. His hands don’t stop working seamlessly, pulling hair-thing strings taut with precise movements. “I’d like to say I could vouch for the guy, but I met him the same day Tony did.”
“Yes,” Osborn agrees, settling cozily back within the Iron Patriot, “twenty-six minutes away from all the secrets of the world’s smartest man, from
For several long moments, he holds his breath for every missed beat, every time Tony’s heart takes too long to get back in order. There’s no AED on board, he suddenly remembers as he peers around for the familiar red. This is an unfinished quinjet; some of the seats aren’t even fully installed. This was one of the last functioning ones that Steve had stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. what seems like a lifetime ago now, after the Skrulls had effectively irreparably damaged the Extremis and every last piece of technology Tony had been linked to. His head fills with a million regrets, a million
Tony immediately knows that tone of voice. “Mom―” he tries to catch her hand as she turns to stand, but she pats it back down over his lap gently.
“It must be good, then,” Natasha replies. Steve knows that look―it’s the I’m Laughing at You Inside look she gets whenever he asks about something he doesn’t understand of this century.
A section of the hull parts in half and folds inward. And there, lying so very still on the ship’s floor, is Tony Stark himself.
that the only reason why you’re so pissed off at him is because he didn’t fall back at your side like every other time before. You beat him near bloody dead, Steve,” she accuses, seething, “brushed aside every time he extended his hand to
“I have a bad feeling about this,” Spider-Man says lowly, uncharacteristically serious, by Bucky’s shoulder.
He can’t quite swallow it down. It all comes back up, violently. It’s more blood than stomach acid at this point, mixing with the ashes that was Peter.
He finishes off by strapping Tony into the regular quinjet harness, though he has to do some maneuvering what with one of Tony’s arms in a criss-cross. The shivering has died down to finer tremors, but Steve still tucks the blanket, folded in double, over him. “Are you comfortable?” he asks as he finishes making sure the blanket won’t slide off with all of the turbulence.
“Whoa, whoa, guys, this is not me! This is not me! The suit is moving on its own. Why is it―where are we going? Friday?” Bruce struggles within the confines of the Hulkbuster, trying for naught to halt the suit’s movements.
Brain damage. That’s what they were looking at. And Osborn had made it all the worse by beating Tony within an inch of his life. It wasn’t a question of
Rhodey shakes his head. He’s careful to keep his hands, still bracing Tony’s body, his arm, steady and as still as possible. “Don’t sweat it. I’ve seen worse,” he lies.
And then Tony’s nimble fingers are strumming over the strings of the guitar, the melody at a much quicker tempo. He walks one foot in front of the other, a soft sway to his hips, towards the microphone stand before him. The spotlight follows, glinting off the edge of his blood-orange sunglasses.
Then, only as Thor relents his post as door sentry to lay sideways over the small space allowed at the foot of the bed, something in Steve finally eases. They may be missing half their numbers, but their little family still manages to be complete.
Tony huffs and closes his eyes. His brows are furrowed into a deep vee, a muscle in his cheek twitching with every other movement Bruce makes. “Wha’enned,” he tries again. “Nu’zuppo be’ere.”
“Jimmy Fallon, Auntie Nat!” Lila exclaims with an almost affronted look. “It’s the only show Mommy will let me watch past my bedtime.”
Hulk snarls at her, but, this time, it is almost playful. “Punny Banner stupid,” he says. “Worry too much.”
His ward―Tony―is almost transparent in his paleness, yet the man finds strength enough to smile at his visitors. “It’s good to see you, too, Barton,” Tony manages, though his voice is weak and almost raspy. He’s sitting up today, resting over a mound of pillows, with the covers pulled up mid-chest, doing nothing to obscure the swab of thick bandages wrapped over most of his torso. “And I see you brought me a present,” he continues, after he tilts his head slightly to look over Barton’s frame.
Within the deafening noise of the crowd, Tony Stark’s graceful figure stands and snatches up an acoustic guitar that had been leaning against the side of the piano.
The air gets steadily colder as they approach the docking bay, his footsteps echoing more loudly as the halls fall emptier and wider. Tony’s shivering worsens with the drop in temperature, but it’s not until Tony makes a small, distressed-sounding
He shot Steve in the back, a paralyzer that immediately had him toppling sideways, half over Stark’s unresponsive body. There was a word of startlement from one of the agents, a sharp,
“We don’t know who’s left,” Steve says, which Rhodey follows up with, “Princess Shuri, she went down with some injuries. She hasn’t woken up yet.”
“Last set of stitches, okay?” Bruce replies in turn. Tony jumps, ever so slightly, every time he pulls a stitch, but there’s nothing more he can do for the pain.
because I was counting on it, I was―I…” He’s breathing too sharply, too quickly now, almost desperate in the way he drags in each gulp of air. His eyes, electric blue,
It’d be an hour flight at top speeds. Steve can’t move from his place, afraid that one mistimed heartbeat from the next Tony could go into cardiac arrest and he’d be too busy getting them back home to be of any use.
Tony’s eyes are frighteningly blue, red rimmed as they are. After a beat of holding Steve’s gaze―the most he has managed in all of the days Steve has been here―he breaks away with a heavy breath that ends with a stifled cough. There are sentences in that gesture, but Steve hasn’t been able to read any of them.
He gently pulls Tony out of his awkward hunch and easily moves the man in his blanket burrito until he’s lying propped up on a mound of pillows Steve had set off nearby in case of this eventuality.
Of course not―he’s Tony fucking Stark, the guy who screwed over half of the superhero community and spat on Captain America’s grave. He is the goddamn Lucifer, and it is finally his time to be thrown out of Heaven by his own brothers and sisters.
Tony shakes his head fervently. There is not enough air in his world, in his lungs, to give voice the volumes of thoughts and reasons floating through his brain why Steve has every reason
.” He doesn’t mean the rawness to slip unbidden from his lips. The blood bubbles up in his throat, and a string of it slides down his chin before he has the sense of mind to swallow the copper back down.
“Steve,” Tony interrupts quietly, the loudest register his voice can manage. “There’s nothing to forgive.”
It was a moment of anger, a last ditch effort to hurt Tony as much as Steve still hurts inside. And the worst part―the worst part of it is he didn’t do it in the heat of the moment. It wasn’t his temper that got the best of him then. No―it was something worse. It was a cold, calculated
This time, Steve can’t stand still in the face of her pain. Her shoulders shake with the sobs she chokes down―yet, at the first touch of his hand on her shoulder, she springs back like a coil, one foot drawing behind her into a defense-attack stance.
He’s seen what brain damage can do. He wouldn’t wish it on his worst enemy. And now it was happening to Tony. It
―again. “We know―I know that I haven’t done right by Tony”―he thinks about that day in Siberia, the pain still thundering in his chest a year later as Tony sung a song for the world to hear―”but this isn’t a time where we get to choose sides. Hulk, he needs
“Sure,” Natasha mutters, just barely loud enough for Steve’s ears to pick up, “‘nuts.’” There’s a double entendre to her words―Steve doesn’t know if he wants to decipher what she means.
he exclaims, and if he were healthier Steve imagines the loudness of his voice would match his tone. “I left, and it didn’t matter because the one person I thought the world of was
Natasha takes a fortifying breath and takes off after the other men. “This just keeps getting better,” she mutters sarcastically.
Tony’s sick, half delirious with a fever that keeps climbing and climbing the longer the virus works at his Extremis biology. Steve turning his back on him―something in Tony breaks.
Natasha rounds the corner from the kitchen, carrying bowls of popcorn. “What’s all the excitement about,
Pepper Potts gives a nod in affirmation, her emerald gaze the last thing Maria Hill sees before the suit’s visor slides down over Potts’ face. “Ready when you are,” comes her voice, lilted with that same cybernetic tone that all Iron Man armours possess.
“Tin Man warm,” he informs the group at large. They all blink at him blankly or, rather, at his charge, stunned beyond words. “Tin Man
Steve presses his palm to Tony’s forehead, repeats it on his cheek and the nape of his neck, and curses. Somehow, in the hour or so he had been gone, the fever had worsened. He had planned on carrying Tony off while he was sleeping and none the wiser, but there is no way the man has been resting through this, if the white-knuckled grip he has on the folds of the blanket is any indication.
Steve stands firm under her stare, ignoring the prickle of tears―he deserves that. There’s no forgiveness for what’s he’s done to Tony Stark―there will never be any forgiveness for the lies he has told, the hypocrisy of his words in years past, the emotional and physical pain he has caused.
Rhodey blinks, and the haze falls from his eyes. “Yeah―yeah, sorry. I’m just…” He trails off, unable to put to words what seeing Tony like this has done to his heart.
during the fighting over the S.H.R.A. and all the time in between since? The realization hits him somewhere deeper than empathy.
, he recalls Tony saying―in and around the wound. It’s staunched most of the bleeding, but it sure as hell didn’t stop an infection from settling in. It looks to be in the early stages, red and inflamed and sweltering off heat, though he’s willing to bet Tony is as dehydrated as a desert and this specific infection is being led by some superbug from some unknown corner of the universe―and that’s without even taking into consideration all of the blood Tony has lost.
he forges on, his syllables clipping with his increasing lack of air, “until you showed up here, after
Tony’s gaze fleets over to the near vicinity of Steve’s eyes for the briefest moment. He huddles the layers of blankets closer to his chest and doesn’t say anything.
Steve’s thumping steps halt just to the side of the Hulk’s large frame. “We know they’re friendlies?” he asks to an unresponsive audience.
He still remembers that first time he peered into Iron Man’s eye slits and found a pair of piercing cerulean staring back at him. When he met Tony Stark some hours later, he knew immediately who had to be behind that iron mask.
After all of that, after all of the pain they have caused each other, there’s little wonder that Tony still refuses to come back down to Earth, even momentarily to see a doctor.
“Of course,” Thor easily agrees. “Tony will find help in the heart of the city.” He points with his hammer, northward. “Allow me to take you there.” He isn’t asking.
Another migraine, Steve surmises with a sinking feeling. Maybe even the same one from yesterday morning. He pads over on socked feet and settles his weight on the coffee table, a pose that comes increasingly familiar these days. He examines Tony, the lines of pain creasing his forehead and how he’s sitting curled into himself with his favourite blanket falling loosely just off his shoulders.
He doesn’t understand how Tony could plead his regret and yet be unable to accept Steve’s own. They both did wrong, but Tony refuses to believe Steve could have possibly done anything other than what is Right and Good. Sometimes, it warms Steve’s heart that someone like Tony, the bravest and most selfless man he has ever known, has such an unshakable resolve in Steve.
“Hey, no, man, you keep doing what you’re doing. Tony and I’ll just to keep busy meantime,” Rhodey says, like it’s that simple. “He’s almost done, all right?” he tells Tony, running his free hand through sweaty locks. Tony leans into the touch with a pained grunt. “Almost done, T.”
There’s a maximum of two people allowed in the ICU room with Tony. Both Colonel Rhodes and Steve are named as his next of kin. Pepper Potts shows up in his stead, stays there with Rhodes at Tony’s bedside every second of every day.
“Steve,” Sharon stops him at the door to the apartment, “they said they’ll call. There’s nothing you can do right now.”
Spider-Man yelps as he scrambles to strap in, hastily pulling the harness across his chest and buckling it down. “How not gentle are we talking? Because I want to come out of this with at least three fingers still attached to my body.”
Thor frowns. He peers up at Barton, and his stare makes no mistake as to which of the two will hold the upperhand in battle. “What is this jest?”
,” it sings in a husky, sultry tone. The lines rises in pitch softly, staying in an almost whisper. It’s haunting. “
Bucky moves between them and Osborn. He’s careful in his movements, maintaining his eyes on Osborn and the huddled group of scared-out-of-their-wits agents in the far corner. It’s then that he notices. They’re being filmed. “Doc, Spider-Man,” he addresses the two men at his back, “get Stark out of here.”
Thor immediately tenses and briskly stomps across the room to dump the presents back on Clint’s arms.
“Tony, god,” he breathes, half desperate not to let the burning in his eyes fall, “what the hell are you doing here? You should be in hospital.”
Hulk huffs, annoyed, but he doesn’t hesitate in extending his hand towards the demigod. Thor grips his hand, nods at the rest of the Avengers in assurance.
A dash of pink make a valiant return to Tony’s cheeks. He covers his eyes with his palms. “God,” he bewails, “it’s like you’re making up for all of the years you couldn’t embarrass me when I was a kid.”
Despite Steve trying to usher him back to bed every other few hours, Tony has been resolutely staying by Steve’s side at the kitchen island. He doesn’t particularly offer anything worthwhile to contribute to the ongoing conversations, but Steve has found his presence rather soothing at times and a welcome distraction at others.
echoes in Steve’s mind. This feels like a dream. “We should get you back to the hospital,” he finds himself saying. He doesn’t want Tony to hurt. He doesn’t want Tony to be dead.
She leaned in, breath huffing through her nose in tightly controlled anger, and said, low and deadpan, “I hope you’re fucking happy.”
He can’t handle this. The tears begin anew in his own eyes. He can’t contain the sob that escapes his lips, the grief and suffering he has been forced to endure these past months. “Tony, I―” he manages to say before he collapses over Tony’s form, gathers the man to his chest.
And, like proper Tony fashion, the man had come to in the middle of the impromptu surgery, Bruce’s fingers and instruments digging deep into skin to suture closed the last of it.
The lights drop suddenly, enshrouding the stage in darkness and painting their living room in blue-black light. Lila’s eyes are huge, glued to the screen as they are, while Steve finds that Clint, Natasha, and Sam are watching with mild interest at best.
Tony has apologized for his side of things every other day, has even gone so far as to explain everything he ever did
This took waaay longer to finish writing than I was expecting, but, hey, extended Spring Break = more Writing Time! Yay!
Steve is respectably startled when she plants a kiss on his burning, just-slapped cheek. “Now, you take care of my boy, you hear?”
he nearly says. That hadn’t gone so well last time. “Don’t be,” he settles on, praying Tony will overlook the previous part. His right hand is shaking with unsettled tension.
