Mordo might have been many things - psychotic and disturbingly persuasive were chief among them - but one thing he was evidently
She rolled her eyes at him. “There is another one packed with your things,” she said after a moment. “In case you are… bored.”
Rhodey’s smile was razor-thin. “Not just the US. Mental health services are never exactly high up on the list, and the US isn’t the only country that takes a view of a lot of mental health disorders as misconduct. If we’re under the same requirements, then -”
“Well, I’m not gonna fight you on that, but in this instance it’s no bad thing.” Rhodey frowned, peering at him as if he could assess the state of Tony’s brain through the projection. “How’re you doing? And the kid?”
ed at him and handed him some tissues with which to wipe his mouth. “I will not enquire as to your basis of comparison,” she said, looking supremely unimpressed. Goddamnit, everyone in this fucking country hated his guts, and basically 99% of the population hadn’t even met him yet. Tony had never been so insulted in his life; wasn’t it good manners to at least
Tony patted his shoulder. “I know. I think we should get a bit more medicine in you and that’ll help, yeah?” He measured out the syrupy substance into the little spoon on the night-table and coaxed Steve into a sitting position so he could take it more easily. “How’s that?” He asked, trying not to laugh at the face Steve pulled.
“But you won, right?” Tony asked, a trifle skeptically. “You beat back Tweedledum through the Looking Glass and all is saved?”
“Than killing thirty two people and trying to abduct a seven year old out from under our noses? Yeah, maybe you shoulda workshopped that idea as little more.”
there wouldn’t be any visible tech, not if they wanted to make Steve feel comfortable. He’d taken pretty well to the Iron Man suit, but Tony still wasn’t entirely sure whether Steve had simply assumed that it was also a form of magic; certainly his reference to Galahad had raised a few eyebrows.
This was precisely the reaction that Tony was hoping he wouldn’t be confronted with. “It’s not permanent,” he said irritably, aware of just how close he was to pedantry.
He left Mordo with Wanda and M’Baku - whose shoulders seemed to have grown an extra few inches in size from sheer rage at Mordo’s audacity - and went back to their (secure, warded,
“Ah, you are kind.” T’Challa coughed, looking a little uncomfortable. “I hesitate to ask this, Dr Stark, but - is the connection secure on your end?”
Tony thought, exhausted. He had no time to spare for Barnes’s feelings, not when the kid was in danger of doing himself an injury. “OK, that’s enough, no kicking!” He grabbed Steve by the wrists - mindful of the catheters, and the dislodged face mask - and hauled him up into his lap. “No more yelling, everything’s fine,” he said, drawing the trembling child into a hug. His hand automatically went to cup the back of Steve’s head as he flung himself into Tony’s embrace. If he closed his eyes, he could hear Jarvis’s quiet voice, gentling him through his nightmares. He pitched his voice low, aiming for that same quiet tone of parental reassurance. “That’s it, now. Everything’s fine. I’m here.”
“And yet you keep yelling as if me getting thwacked by Samurai Jack was in any way my fault,” Tony said through the sudden nausea. “Where’s Steve?” 24 hours… who had been watching the kid?
Steve peered at Barton with one eye and then immediately hid his face against Tony’s side again, giggling.
“- and poach them, yes, Obi-Wan, you have taught me well the ways of your corporate dominion. I will do my very best to bring back the Wakandan version of me. Or at least arrange a collaboration of some sort.” Because he very much doubted he’d be able to tempt them away from the most advanced facilities on Earth. But maybe if he threw in access to some of the scavenged Chitauri tech as a sweetener?
He’d had a pristine example of how not to do it in the form of Rogers’s fucking letter. If ever there was a
That… that had not been what he had expected. Rage, regret, maybe even guilt - sure. He had his own fair share of those. But this…
Her mouth hung open for a second, working mutely, before she nodded, her hair swinging with the movement. Her hands opened and closed uselessly in her lap. “All right. I - I apologise.” She looked away. “That’s what I came here to say. I apologise.”
Pepper’s briefing pack had been crystal clear that the ‘secret love child’ story would be enforced from day one, in all conversations that could possibly be overheard. That pretty much meant everywhere except the secure housing set up for them, and vehicles were more vulnerable than most other locations. The driver had put up the limo’s privacy screen, of course, but that meant nothing. Not even Pepper could guarantee that every vehicle, room and public space they went to wouldn’t be riddled with bugs and surveillance equipment, so ‘secret love child’ it was. Tony only hoped that Steve would remain conked out from the journey until he could explain it to him.
“Yes.” She climbed slowly to her feet, accepting Okoye’s offer of a hand up. “You try that again, and I will gut you.” She glanced across at Minoru. “Both of you.” She said it casually.
“You know, you haven’t asked me what happened.” He reached out and poked one spindly arm. “How I know you, where you are.”
“I get that you don’t have any special loyalty to me; fine, whatever, we can agree to - look, you can be an absolute bastard to me, I don’t care. But -” He really,
But his eyes were already closed, sleep dragging him under, Steve a warm and comforting weight against his chest.
Next time: the reality of looking after a sickly child starts to sink in.  And Tony realises that things are gonna get worse before they get better.
Not with his eyes closed, and his expression so typically childlike, no. Not when he was wrapped up in Tony’s worn T-shirt, and bundled so tightly in his bedclothes it was clear his sleep had been disrupted. He was so
Tony leaned forwards in his seat, brow furrowing. The first event was four weeks ago, in a village called Inari in Lapland.
You know when you have a plan that you'll sit down and have some 'me' time to write and write and write? And then RL happens. Well, RL has been kicking my arse and I'm just relieved I managed to get some words down at this point tbh.
He cast a glance at the closed bedroom door, behind which - he hoped - the kid was still safely asleep.
The Master wrinkled her nose, as if he had said something offensive. “No. We do not use weapons in the same way as you do; in this instance, they would merely compound the damage already done. A method of entry would be a way for us to undo what has been done. Ordinarily, we would lock away the attack into another dimension, so that there is no damage here, but that cannot contain Umar. This dimension is as alien to her as any other, and so she would merely continue in her attempts wherever we put her. No, it is clear that a fixed point would be our best option, if it exists. If not, we can -” She stopped, her eyes flickering between Okoye and Tony. “There is a problem?”
Barton’s mouth was a thin line. He looked exhausted, the black eye from before in full bloom. (How long had Tony been out, for it to have developed like that, all mottled purples and blues?) He leaned forward and fussed with Tony’s pillow, then thumbed the pebble on the nearby table again until it flashed. “Yup. You remembered. Well, OK, you’re all caught up.” He looked like he wanted to say something else but he looked away instead, eyes red-rimmed, rubbing a hand across the stubble on his face. “You got knocked on the head, got concussed. Would have been OK, but -”
though. Clearly, they’d both been wrong, at least to some extent. That Tony might have had his head up his ass was not a new thought to him; likewise, the thought that Captain Perfect might have had the same. But both, at the same time, on the same point? That was more of a stretch. And yet... He looked at Barton, thinking hard. After Romanoff had absconded with the tattered remains of Tony’s dignity, who would have maintained contact between the two camps?
But no, that made no sense. Tony wasn't doing 'this', whatever 'this' was. No, it was just... it was just…
Tony’s discomfort. “Vision checked in, everyone is apparently OK. There’s been another attack, though, so - well, you get the idea.” He looked down at where Wanda was still sat on the ground slowly rubbing the back of her head. “Wanda, you alright? You didn’t hit your head or - or anything?” The pain in his chest hadn’t eased, tight as a vice around his ribcage. He wanted - he didn’t know what. He wanted to call Vis and talk to Steve; he wanted to get back there and check on Steve himself; he wanted -
Rhodey chewed his lower lip. He had his hands in his lap, clenched tight enough for the skin to be grey and thin on the knuckles. “I keep saying this,” he said hollowly. “It’s nothing to do with you.”
Steve had taken a deep breath, a look of intense concentration on his face, his small chest expanding as he tried to make his voice as low and as deep as possible.
Tony thought. He kept face as relaxed as possible. “I need some way to keep our mutual friend away from the kid. There’s only a couple that come to mind, and I’m gonna need help with either one.” Because the only way Tony could think of this becoming an even bigger clusterfuck than it currently was if Ross decided to stick his nose in.
And as for this latest debacle… he could see that his indifference was hurting her. It was obvious, in the way she had reached for his hand, and he had permitted. In the way she had squeezed, and he had… permitted it.
He scowled. He was done with apologising for Ultron, at least to his former team. It was pointless anyway; what would an apology even achieve? “We don’t know what kind of temporal event it is -”
Tony thought, irritated. If they’d done what he was now fairly certain they’d done… Some fucking dream, if Maximoff had been his cruise director... He looked down at the top of Steve’s head, at where his fingers were carding softly through the blonde hair. Sometime in the last few minutes Steve’s breathing had evened out and he’d slumped back into sleep, dozing against Tony’s chest. “Huh,” Tony said, a little surprised. “You weren’t kidding about him being tired.”
He hoped that their ride would arrive soon. The temperature had dropped rapidly as the light had fled, and if it got much colder - and if Steve’s breathing didn’t improve - he’d have to consider alternatives to staying put and waiting for rescue.
Did he want to do this with the two people who (for whatever well-meaning reasons they may have had) had done more to manipulate him over the last few weeks than anyone had done since… well, it had been a while. Maybe even as much as a year.
Hell on earth. Why didn’t I think of that? I mean, it’s not like any of this is verifiable, right?” What the hell kind of creature was this Umar, if this guy was likening running into her to an encounter with a
The kid looked terrified, tears and snot smeared across his face in picture-perfect misery. The kid - Steve - was so
“Back home?” Steve brightened so much it was almost painful to watch. He sat up and hugged his knees, suddenly wide awake.
And there was no way to portal in, of course, not unless the swordsman wanted to risk entering solid rock. So he’d have to fight his way in, following the trail laid out so plainly it was practically glowing in the dark.
“He’s asleep.” Which was probably as close to ‘OK’ as Tony was gonna get at this point in time, for both Steve and himself. He glanced across at Barton, who was very pointedly
Tony held up one hand in the scout’s salute, the other busy sliding his shoes on. “I promise. Any heart attacks whatsoever and I’ll definitely have someone stick a thermometer in me.”
Not for the first time, Tony felt a pang of unease. It was one thing to deal with a hysterical child in the base, or even at the hospital. But here…
impossibility of wanting his mother - and he almost didn’t dare believe that it was possible. That he could have this small slice of normality back.
(He’d had those thoughts himself; of course he had. If he’d died on Yinsen’s operating table, maybe Yinsen would still be alive; maybe Rhodey would still be able to walk; maybe Pepper would be safe; maybe the world would be better if -)
Sending him back to live the same life of pain and loss and trauma, to watch his mother die anyway, and to live through the horror of war….
Tony had tried to settle him down, he honestly had. He’d told him it was OK, and he’d told him that everything was going to be fine. He’d told him that it had just been a bad dream - for all that it had been during the day, with Steve wide awake - and as he'd spoken, he’d run through all the options in his mind, frantically, trying to gauge the threat at the same time as he’d soothed the child. It had to have been the mind stone, that was the only explanation. They knew that Steve was connected to the portal, and that the connection had re-established every time it was open. They knew that Mordo wanted access to Steve as something more than just a way to find Umar. And Steve had not been around Vision before, he hadn’t been anywhere near the mind stone while the portal was open. No, that was the only thing that fit all the facts. The mind stone, plus the portal….
“He’s fine,” Barton soothed, face pale, pressing him back down. “Rhodey’s fine. Steve’s fine. Everyone else is fine.” He grabbed for the pebble on the little table by the bed, thumbing it until it flashed red. “You just took a bit of a blow to the head, so we’re going to get you checked out, OK?”
God, no wonder Wilson had been willing to compromise. No wonder he’d tried to make a deal with Tony, tried to get them all to a non-violent solution. If this was one of his main objections…
At the far end of the corridor leading to their suite, a lone attacker was dispatching the last of the four guards that had been assigned to their living quarters. Three were already on the floor, their throats and bellies opened, blood puddling around the bodies. The fourth guard was dangling in the attacker’s grip, making choking sounds.
“No,” Rogers interrupts. He doesn't attempt to reach for Tony again, although he stays close. Close enough to catch him, if Tony should fall. (If Tony's body should betray him again.) “No. Not because of that. Because I want to help.”
anywhere, despite the automatic doors swooshing open periodically. Surely the wind outside would blow in plenty of debris? Where did it all go?
Surely, someone would have mentioned the tragic yet heroic story of how Captain America yadda yadda yadda. And if not the relentless Cold War propaganda engine, then SHIELD would have made a note of it somewhere. He couldn’t recall anything other than pleurisy in Steve’s official file, but…
needed Rhodey. Rhodey would know what to do; Rhodey would calm him down just by being himself. Whatever else was going on in Tony’s life, Rhodey had been his constant, his rock. And Rhodey was in surgery - or had been - and he just, he needed to see his face. To reassure himself that his North Star was still there, ready to call him an idiot and hug him in equal measure.
"Four hours, baby girl. Not a moment earlier." He wasn't going to have Vision unavailable in the event of a major attack for nothing other than a poor cellphone signal.
“What are you doing?” Steve asked drowsily, still half-asleep. He’d slept through the entire night and most of the morning, only stirring when Tony had gently shaken him awake. He blinked in the half-light of the room, watching Tony. “Are we leaving?”
“Right, you must be frozen.” Christ, he had to warm the kid up quickly. “I'm just gonna -” Still moving slowly, he started opening up the manual latches along the suit. He stepped out once it was open enough, shivered as the cold air hit him. It was freezing even in his thermal undersuit; Steve was probably risking hypothermia. “Sit,” he told the suit, and it obediently sprawled down on the ground. “Let's get you inside, okay?”
“Well,” Tony said, gathering the child up and settling him against the suit on his hip, “that’s certainly an elephant right there. I’m impressed. Where’d you see one of those?”
These are not the extent of his choices, he knows that much. He does not have to stay here, frozen in fear, waiting for the impossibility to resolve itself, for the choice to be taken out of his hands. He does not have to say here at all. Surely that much is self-evident, surely it is
Steve’s brow furrowed in thought. “Sort of. But he was also scary. He’d had lots of bad things happen, and they hurt, and they didn’t stop hurting. And then he’d also done bad things, and they didn’t stop hurting, either.” His voice dropped. “It was scary, and it
, because Tony had been at their mercy for two days and he was already ready to shoot himself). But...
And... well, it might be a bit of a crutch, but he needed to do something before he was ready to face it. “I’m going to make another call, I’ll be right back. Do
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Mordo regarding him gravely. After a couple of minutes of the scrutiny, he gave in, putting the tablet down. “What?”
"Boss, it might not be the best option to attract the attention of whoever was here," FRIDAY said in his ear, sounding worried.
OK, in retrospect, the fact that Barton wasn’t allowed to smack him in the head quite clearly didn’t prevent him from pinching Tony in places no man should be pinched. He totally should have seen that one coming.
He’d need to think on the options a little more, of course. The charges against the team were varied and numerous, and they covered several jurisdictions. Ross was only one problem, albeit a significant one. The ideal solution was of course for Ross to not know about Steve at all, which would be easiest if they stayed on SI land. Pepper had confirmed that they’d be set up in the Palo Alto area - SI held significant land there, covering both industrial and residential areas - which would mean they could get to Oakland easily enough when they needed to. Plus, it would be a decent cover; what could be more natural than Tony spending time in the office?
Tony wasn’t sure whether he should be insulted on Barton’s behalf or not. He settled for shrugging a little.
But, wait. He suddenly remembered how profoundly Lang had been rattled by the images of the killed children, all those long weeks ago in Birnin Zana; how Lang had almost looked green with the effort to keep his face still.
“... right.” He’d probably been traumatised enough for one lifetime already. God knew how fucked up he’d be by the time they managed to turn him back into his adult self.
Well, the alternative was setting down somewhere and, frankly, with the way the HUD was flickering, Tony wasn’t sure they’d be able to make it all the way to the mountains, let alone cope with a detour.
Tony was irrationally amused by her preference for Ross over Rogers as a conversation topic. “Not yet. I’ll need to get him settled in first.” There were a couple of schools on the premises that would probably work - secure perimeter, all his own people, no one to blink an eye at Barnes-in-disguise accompanying Steve everywhere - but he figured a few days getting settled in was probably helpful.
“Can we get back to me and the Boy Wonder for a second and leave my teenaged experimentation as a topic for another time, please? I thought we were flying under the radar!”
” He couldn’t think of what else to say, how to express his happiness and relief for his friend. That he could have this part of himself back. That this hadn’t been taken away from him as well.
“Captain Rogers is flying under the radar,” the king said, looking a bit bemused. “You are here on a personal visit. I cannot simply choose to leave a child in the extended care of anyone other than a family member, Dr Stark. There were certain safeguards that needed to be followed. But now that we have satisfied ourselves that it is appropriate to release Captain Rogers into your custody, we are able to proceed with discharging him from the PICU. I would have thought you’d be pleased; you have been most vocal in checking on his progress with the doctors.”
No, he couldn’t think that way. Things were already muddy enough without this; no, all he had to do was figure out a way to… well, fix things. Magically. Or - if he had his way - scientifically.
No one had a reasonable answer to this. Vision floated a couple of ideas, primarily to do with temporal mechanics, and Romanoff wondered why the temporal event had gone down at the base in the first place - was it the location, or had the attacker needed anything specific that was there? (Of course, there was no footage of the attack itself - the security system had been disabled beforehand.) Wilson thought they should go over the intelligence that Rogers had used in the first place, in case he’d been drawn there by the same thing that had attracted the attacker. (This wasn’t unreasonable, and a small, mean part of Tony was pleased at how surprised Wilson looked when Tony said he agreed.)
Oh, god, it didn’t bear thinking about. Looking after a kid version of Steve was one thing; having to deal with there being no resolution to all that had gone down between them…
A flight course was laid out for him, away from the palace and towards the mountains just barely visible in the distance.
“Yeah, thanks FRIDAY,” he said wearily, dropping the kid back inside the chest cavity. “Now,” he said, sitting down opposite the mutinous-looking Steve, “you want to explain why you didn’t listen to me? I told you to stay put!”
“Why,” Tony said slowly, each word carefully enunciated, “are you irradiating Steve’s blood with gamma rays?”
Barton rolled his eyes. “Just because you can’t keep your ward in crayons doesn’t mean the kid should suffer, oh concussed one.”
Rhodey reached over and grabbed a hold of his hand, squeezing gently. “He’ll be fine,” he said quietly. He glanced up at Wilson, who was scowling, then back at Tony. “He’s in and out of it, a lot. Clint’s been sitting with him a little bit, you know, in between getting everything ready for - uh, later. He’s been asking for you,” he said after a moment. “Steve, obviously, not Clint.” He paused. “Although Clint has, as well, but mostly he said to tell you to quit lazing around and get dressed, so.” He shrugged.
“That still splits us into two,” Romanoff noted. “Tony and Rhodey need to remain here, as do Wanda and Bucky. My suggestion is that everyone else,” she inclined her head towards T’Challa, “including you, your majesty, if you can spare the time, work on the bigger threat.”
“You’re back to walking everywhere the moment that mask is done,” he informed the sleeping child, and checked to make sure the aforementioned mask was within reach. His touch lingered on Steve’s forehead.
“I’ll bet.” He shook his head. It was uncanny. Barnes looked exactly like - but that made sense. No one memorable, no one who was known to be an employee of Stark Industries, but if there was a question raised around the identity of Tony’s new bodyguard, doubtless all any digging would turn up was that an ex-bodyguard had been re-hired. Tony would bet his eye-teeth that his employment would be backdated to before Tony ever left US soil.
looking after frightened kids was really not his forte. At a complete loss, he gathered the child back up on his arms. “I know,” he said gently. “But… you haven’t gone missing, kiddo. You’ve just been made… small.”
Before he knew what he was doing, Tony activated the repulsors, barrelling through the portal in the split-second before it closed.
and there was no healing factor; he hadn’t been breathing properly and depending on how starved of oxygen his blood had been, he could have had fucking
It's been a bit of a long hiatus! Work has been a nightmare with ridiculous hours and a lot of stress, and I've had the builders in, etc etc, you get the idea. Mea culpa for the long delay, and thank you to all those still reading. The longer I left it the harder it was to get back to writing, so I'm just glad to have got the next part out. I'm going to try to get back into a regular schedule of posting as momentum seems easier to maintain that way.
“Yeah, you’re a real prince,” Tony sneered, but he did not step away from Barton. Weirdly, Barton’s flash of rage made him feel a bit better to know that he was not the only one struggling with this. That he was not the only harbouring a grudge, or obsessing over things said weeks ago. Instead he matched his stride to Barton’s until they were almost marching shoulder to shoulder, both furious in their solidarity.
You went after a seven year old with a fucking sword, so you do not get the benefit of any doubt. You get to lay out everything you know,
It had also occurred to him - more than once - that there was really only one place that Rogers could have learned about Barnes’s involvement in the murders of Howard and Maria Stark. And unless Tony was missing his mark by quite some distance, Romanoff had been right by his side when it had all gone down.
The doctors had told him that Steve should be safe to discharge in a day or so, as long as he was confined to his bed and taking his meds. His long bouts of sleeping - interspersed with some horrific-sounding hacking - had done nothing to persuade Tony of his supposed rapid rate of recovery.
Tony thought again, and felt a pang of shame. Had he really been so wrapped up in his own mess that he hadn’t noticed at all?
All of a sudden, he got it, what had Rhodey so happy. His knees suddenly felt weak with relief. “Rhodey. Thank God.
FRIDAY seemed to hesitate. “Her Royal Highness did say that it was important she meet with you as soon as possible. At the Oakland Centre.”
The fact that both Maximoff and Barnes - the two who had had the most success fighting the swordsman - had been permanent glimpses out of the corner of Tony’s eye since he’d regained consciousness; not close enough to frighten Steve, but close enough to defend them if there was an attack. Dhakiya sending through the child’s things when the parcel would have been easily traced. And, as a final cherry on the trifle, Barton, ordering children’s toys from Amazon Prime and having them be delivered in Jabariland.
fault. He fed Tony another ice chip. “It very nearly wasn’t. D’you know how dangerous blood-thinners are with a concussion? You had a fucking cerebral haemorrhage, for fuck’s sake, you coded twice before they were able to stabilise you! Why the hell didn’t you say something?”
chose to withhold the source of her power, to pretend that she was somehow morally pure.” His rage was palpable, every muscle in his body taut. “One of the sanctums was destroyed entirely, and the other is still only partly rebuilt. Only New York stands whole, and is protected by someone who is -” his eyes narrowed, “- just like you. And you ask why
Tony thought, ridiculously, as if having breakfast would somehow safeguard Steve against the pain of losing everything all over again.
He had an hour, right? He could wait until Barton or whoever came down to get him. It wasn’t like the kid had anyone else, after all. Sure, they’d get Barnes thawed out pretty quickly, but until then, Tony could stay here. What could it hurt?
“So there is no one who could vouch for you?” Romanoff asked, almost apologetically. “You must know that nothing you have said would mean we would give you access to the child.”
“I am not interested in your defence,” the man said, and stepped further into the light. Yup, definitely hallucinating. “I am interested in what you are doing here. You, and the others that have moved into the palace. I did not restore T’Challa to the throne to have him abandon it! And for what? A European gap year?”
“Will you be able to assist him?” T’Challa said, looking a little put-out to have to say it aloud rather than have Tony offer unprompted.
Mordo, who was looking back at him with perfect understanding and not responding. Finally, he sighed, and spread his hands. “The Ancient One,” he said. There was a small smile on his lips, oddly sad. “And believe me, please, I am fully aware of how flawed my reasoning is to both blame her for withholding information from us, and to yet miss her, and wish that she was here to make this choice for me instead. That I could continue for a little while longer in my state of blissful ignorance. But there is no one else, Mr Stark. There is no higher power I can appeal to, no more profound judgement I can trust. There is just - me.”
“Steve,” he said helplessly, looking down. (He hadn’t even felt the kid grab a hold of him, let alone -) “Buddy, it’s OK -” He knelt down and gathered the child up. “It’s OK, it’s fine, don’t be scared.” The child was small and cold and rigid in his arms, his grip on Tony unyielding. “We’re not gonna fight, I promise.” He stood up, Steve wrapped in his arms. “This isn’t finished,” he said to Barton, who still had that same look on his face, worried and shamefaced in equal measure. “Don’t you think for one minute that I’m gonna let this go. This is too far, Barton. How could you?”
“Yeah,” Tony muttered, rubbing at his chest. “Barnes wasn’t the hit we were hoping he’d be. Guess he’s not as universally popular as Rogers had thought.” Barnes hadn’t been back since the ill-fated introduction. In retrospect, Tony should have probably primed Steve a little with how his bestest buddy ever was all grown up as well, but…
Minoru shrugged. “He will not give you a choice.” She waved a hand, and a portal formed by the side of the desk: the airport, where the cloaked quinjet had landed discreetly, hidden by the noise and flurry of the other traffic. The jet itself could not be seen, still under cloak, but there was a figure sat on some nearby crates, waiting patiently. He was fiddling with what looked to be handcuffs but were in fact the bracelets, interlocked.
“Well,” Rhodey said, smiling a little, “It’s not actually a lie. If anyone digs deep enough, all they'll get are my medical records.”
- was the oddest feeling. Dhakiya hadn’t thought that Steve was his, and of course all the others knew the situation, and… well, he wasn’t too clear where he himself stood on the matter. So hearing a stranger make a wrong assumption shouldn’t have made that much difference. Anyway, it was a moot point; for all intents and purposes, Steve was his responsibility. Whatever Tony did, he couldn’t escape the fact that he’d taken on a responsibility in signing those papers. He knew that, of course, and it made it a lot simpler that so far his duties had been primarily limited to reading bedtime stories and saving the kid from being shish-kebabed. But until they could turn him back…
They must be intending to keep him there for a while, if they’d hooked him up with an uretic catheter as well.
Tony closed his eyes, forcing his hand to open. He breathed deep, the pebble sitting fat and heavy in the centre of his palm. “Resume playback.”
guns with him, one of which probably weighed more than the kid. “They’re gonna thicken up the trail and set the bait in the next couple of hours. They’ll come get us when it’s all over.”
Vision said, still keeping himself out of reach, as if he could protect the child by hovering a mere three feet away.
, his hand small and still on the hospital linen, his face sufficiently similar so that Tony felt a pang of,
“I’m hardly kidnapping him,” he’d snapped at Barton when he’d wandered in to check on their progress.
That didn’t seem that likely, though; the kid had been clinging to him more and more vehemently with every passing day. Telling him about the tracker should make him
Tony spun around. “Did you know about this?” He bit out. Then, “what am I even saying; it’s a double-cross, so yeah, you were probably the architect. What, did you run out of people to turn on so you figured kids are fair game now?”
Tony laughed. “Don’t you dare, you know I have a heart condition, you absolute asshole.” He shook his head. “Listen, you know you can always tell me if I’m screwing this up - I really
Tony covered Steve’s ears with one hand, tucking his head against Tony’s shoulder. “I’m glad that my extreme mental trauma is amusing for you. Anything else you want to poke fun at?”
Even after everything that had gone wrong between them, wouldn’t Steve agree with him on this one small, self-evident truth?
) Because it was one thing to seek counselling when not on active duty. It was another thing if you were deployed. And War Machine… War Machine was classified as active deployment.
“Well,” Tony said after a moment, surveying the jam-covered child, jam-covered table, and jam-covered rug. “I guess we can squeeze in a bath before we set off.”
“And with that attitude, there isn’t a court in the land that would convict me,” Barton snapped. He fed Tony another ice chip with as much passive aggression as he could muster. “Congratulations, you were the first patient at the not-yet-complete Jabariland Clinic. Dhakiya had to scramble a neurosurgical team from Birnin Zana because we couldn’t fucking move you, on account of your brain being turned into Swiss cheese! You’ve been in a medically-induced coma for 24 hours, Tony, we thought you were fucking
, as if Tony is some helpless thing cowering in a corner, instead of glaring at him in his own fucking workshop.
Happy nodded seriously. “Don’t worry, boss. I’ll make sure he’s OK. And if this thing drags on, if you have to bring him back with you -”
. He'd spent a sizable portion of the sixteen days since the break-out looking, and he had no idea whether the lack news meant that Barton himself was with them, or Romanoff. Whether the lack of news was a good sign.)
“I’m supposed to do this stretch three times a day,” Rhodey said, his voice little more than a pained grunt. “The physio said -”
Tony flipped him off. “I am vetoing that right this moment, Legolas, don’t you even think about it. You try to lift me and I will do serious damage to your manhood.”
“You said a bad word,” a small voice piped up from behind him, and Tony nearly leapt a foot in the air.
“Believe it or not, this is him after much remedial work,” Rhodey said apologetically. “It’s an ongoing project.”
“They do that,” M’Baku agreed. He nodded back at the group of children. “You will also have one shortly, I think.”
It probably was, Tony thought, but unfortunately all of his other options were even worse. He rather thought that Pepper might disagree, though. “I need to work with Shuri on this, and she’s based in Oakland.”
Well, all right. Mordo hadn’t said, and they hadn’t clocked that ‘Master’ was a gender neutral title, fine.
Rogers doesn't look up from where he is pressing his fingers against the pulsepoint on Tony’s neck. He has a fucking
, because he wasn’t the one dealing with this. Because all the literature said that everyone was different, that clinical depression was a possibility, that the cocktail of negative feelings would take months to work through as people settled into their new normality. Because it had taken Rhodey weeks to tell him this, in confidence, and he didn’t want to betray that trust by getting this wrong.
“Fixing up the armour. Want to see?” Tony allowed him to stay perched on Tony’s knee as he finished reassembling the boot, turning the finished result this way and that so he could see the repairs.
“Steve,” he managed. His vision was almost entirely gone, now, and the cold was fast receding as well. “And I’m not swooning, I’m just, I’m just -”
The rest of them eventually shuffled themselves into the seats around the wide conference table - Wilson taking one of the chairs away to give Rhodey room to wheel his chair next to Tony - and Barton stood at the front of the room. “OK, I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, we have a major problem.” As he talked, the screen lit up with photos from the base’s storage room. “SHIELD’s old files were a little thin on ritual magic, but I've gone through what I could find and it’s pretty obvious that some sort of portal was opened up using magical means.” He didn’t need to elaborate; the photos pretty much spoke for themselves.
In his defence, he’d expected Pepper to look a little less like he’d dropped a dead mouse in her glass of wine.
He didn’t seem to understand how to play with them, Tony thought, and had half-wondered a couple of times whether he should step in, and, well
Tony got to his feet smartly. “Your majesty. Haven’t seen you for a while.” He stopped just shy of accusing T’Challa of avoiding him.
“Yeah, I guess I see why you’d have to tell yourself that, on account of having to live with yourself and all,” he said instead, and settled back in his seat.
Ah, of course. In the end, didn’t everything boil down to money? The Avengers subsidiary had been pretty effectively ring-fenced - and had been in the process of splitting off from the main SI parent company - when the whole Accords fiasco had blown up at them. Either way, SI would have an impenetrable liability shield, but that didn’t mean that the sub wasn’t vulnerable. As things currently stood, the Avengers didn’t exist in a legal sense as anything other than private security (and they certainly didn’t enjoy diplomatic immunity, no matter what anyone might have wished). It meant that the government couldn’t direct them or take charge of them, but it also meant that they weren’t covered by government guarantees or other protections if they were sued. Just like any other company operating in private security and disaster recovery, any screw-ups meant a pay-out.
It wasn’t as if the bastard cared one way or the other; this was just him trying to get under Tony’s skin. And, really, Tony was getting spectacularly fed up of everyone praising him to kingdom come like he was a pre-schooler in need of soothing, especially since the prevailing attitude to reading him in on the plans left him at roughly the same level. “And you’re spectacularly shit with him,” he bit out. “It must be a gift. I thought your past self was supposed to have raised a passel of kids, what with all the siblings and cousins; didn’t any of that stick?” He raised a hand to his head to press against the source of the headache. “And quit sneaking up on me, I have a heart condition, asshole. Are you trying to give me a heart attack?”
he thought, but did not say. Even if Barton had gone to ground, it wasn’t as though Rogers was running short on back-up.
FRIDAY’s voice was staticky, the connection from the suit to the earbud clearly disrupted by something. “He is underweight, asthmatic, and vitamin-deficient. His body temperature was 35.5 C when he was placed in the suit; it is now up to 35.6 C and will climb 0.1 C every fifteen minutes if he remains inside the suit. He has minor abrasions on his legs and he is dehydrated and exhausted.” She paused for a moment. “You have been inside the base for one hour, eighteen minutes, boss,” she said finally. “The lead lining is disrupting transmissions, and I have not been able to contact the Tower or any other back-up. If the suit does not make contact with my main presence within the next two hours, forty-two minutes, my main presence will contact Vision to retrieve you.”
He needed Rhodey; he loved Rhodey. But Rhodey was his own man, and Rhodey’s first and primary loyalty would always be to the country he served. That was good and right and proper, and Tony would never begrudge Rhodey choosing country over friendship or family, not even once. And yeah, if Rhodey did, if Rhodey were to do that… but Rhodey wouldn’t do that. He’d never do that. Rhodey would absolutely have his back, but Rhodey was a soldier, first and foremost. He put his country first.
“So,” he said quietly, “it turns out I’ve screwed up even more than I thought I had. But I guess you knew that.” Steve didn’t seem to have much to say to that, his chest rising and falling in regular movements.
being somewhat mangled in there. Okoye has the voice-activated release for Wanda's bracelet, and she opens it using the Xhosa for 'let go' or 'release'. My knowledge of Xhosa is limited to google translate, so if anyone has a correction, it would be very welcome.
He left them to it, the two vipers, and stomped back to the pilot’s console, easing himself into the co-pilot’s seat. “FRI,” he murmured, pulling the faceplate down and tuning out everyone else, “call Steve.”
put out to have missed all the excitement, but when it came right down to it, no one could agree on what to do. It was building up to a fairly full argument by the time Tony made up his mind. “If I go,” he said, and Lang paused mid-sentence to gape at him. “If I go, T’Challa, I don’t think it would be sensible to take Steve with me.” Not that he could remove Steve from Wakanda easily, of course, but the legalities of it didn’t seem the biggest issue at the moment.
Sleep did not come easily. He tensed at every small noise, getting up four times in the night to check on Steve and make sure that he was OK.
“Inside the suit,” he said. Fuck, it was cold. “It's heated, it'll warm you up.” It would also - helpfully - keep an eye on Steve’s vital stats. The suit was capable of acting as a life support system when required; if necessary, Tony could seal the kid inside until help arrived.
and if he could get Pep, Happy and Rhodey to - at least a little - back him on this, no matter how many misgivings they might have...
Steve nodded, his eyes on the book. On the inside cover there was a lovely watercolour illustration of a small blonde boy, dwarfed in his princely tunic, holding a sword up with both hands.
he’d said, when Barton had stopped by to drop off some toiletries and a copy of all the footage and data they had; Barton had been less than amused - but looking after and
“That is not what the Dora say. They say, and the courts say, and unless your little problem is solved, the papers will say, and then, oh, I might even read the paper on that day, just to see your face.” M’Baku leaned in, showing the point of his teeth in a wolfy smile. “Your compatriots are in Gorom-Gorom, hunting down abducted girls. They have left you here in my care, under my protection, and they go off, and for why? To play at heroes? Do they even have a plan, Stark?”
Tony sighed. “Right, well. It’s not like I have a lot of choice.” He looked down at the exhausted child in his arms. “Steve, buddy? We’re going to have to go someplace else now, to keep away from the bad guy. Are you going to be OK if I carry you for a bit?”
“Yeah, OK, fine. But other than that. Why did you call?” Wilson’s gaze was flinty. “How did you say Steve was doing?”
his HEAT instructor had told him when Tony had first started doing visits to fun places like Iraq and Afghanistan.
“Shhhh, come on, it’s OK, you can tell me.” A thought struck him. He’d been jumpy and frightened earlier as well. Maybe... “Did you have a nightmare? About the base?”
He doesn't know. He doesn't have the time to enumerate all the ways in which he now needs to grade the people in his life, in his space, according to how threatened he feels. “I'll tell you later.” For now, he has more immediate problems.
Tony had the unpleasant sensation that he was being mocked in some way he couldn’t quite pin down. His eyes narrowed. “You know, I’m still not entirely sure why you’re not trussed up like a turkey at Thanksgiving down in the hold. Why do you merit a seat?”
“Somehow I doubt that.” Tony grabbed a handful of Mordo’s tunic in his left hand, lifting him bodily, the repulsor in his right hand at full power inches from Mordo’s face. Wanda wouldn’t have let this guy go; hell,
Actually, now that he thought about it, he rather suspected that Shuri herself wasn’t adverse to the idea of doing this outside of her brother’s direct control (T’Challa’s blessing notwithstanding), as she hadn’t volunteered to fly back instead. Her lab had been damaged in the succession scuffle, if he’d caught T’Challa’s drift correctly, but that didn’t mean that she wouldn’t be able to rebuild it pretty fucking quickly if the occasion called for it. No, he’d bet good money that Shuri wouldn’t be volunteering to come back to her brother’s apron strings unless the world was actually ending. He couldn’t really blame her, either; T’Challa had charisma in spades, and intelligence wasn’t the be-all and end-all. Tony himself had easily been smarter than Rogers - and less easily, than Fury - and had still let them order him about for the better part of five years. “The lab’s not portable, and - look, I’m not just going to sit around here and wait, OK? I have to come back to the US. And I’m in charge of Steve, I can’t just abandon him - and he needs to be there in person for us to figure out what the hell is going on. This really is the best way of doing it.”
a ward. Are you confusing me with Batman again? Because flattering as that would be, I think I need to make it
,” he said, shouldering his way into Mordo’s personal space, crowding him back against the wall of the quinjet, “just
“I have a whole quiver of them.” Barton sighed and regarded the ceiling, hesitating. “You did well with him,” he said at last, grudgingly.
Relief was melting across Barnes’s face at this. “Yeah. Yeah, you did. It was my birthday, and you won me a prize. A…” Frustration, again, creasing his face into a scowl.
“FRIDAY. We’re going to be heading back to the US in a little bit. I need you to do some digging for me in the meantime.” The suit was already in the jet, and FRIDAY would be able to speak to her main presence through it. With any luck, she’d have most of this sorted out for him before they even lifted off. Tony had already alluded to some of this with Pepper, and between her precautions and T’Challa’s influence, he hoped that this would be enough to stall anything Ross might throw his way if he ever got wind of there being something odd about Steve. But he didn’t want Wakanda to be his only option if things went wrong. T’Challa had created the paper record for Steve, and if T’Challa changed his mind for any reason… He looked back at the closed bathroom door. “I want a third country option if things don’t work out back home. And - some thoughts on how to make sure any fall-out doesn’t hit Stark Industries if Ross decides to go nuclear.” He sincerely hoped it would never come to that, but it never hurt to be prepared.
, but he couldn’t do anything. There wasn’t enough room in his head for him, and the thing-that-wasn’t-him was still there, still trying to cocoon him in softness, and he shoved harder at it, almost frantic.
The shorter of the two doctors - the one with ‘Respiratory Diseases and Transitional Care Unit’ beneath the hospital crest - approached Tony cautiously. “May I examine him?” At Tony’s nod, she pressed a stethoscope under Steve’s oversized armour jersey. Whatever it was she heard was not good, judging by the way her face went expressionless. “Dr Stark? How long has his breathing been like this?”
There was a long pause. “Yes,” T’Challa said finally. “I rather thought you might.” He smiled at whatever he saw in Tony’s expression. “I assume you’re not here for my permission?”
At least they hadn’t dragged Maximoff with them; the last thing Tony needed was trying to fight an ECOWAS extradition to Nigeria. “There are guards,” Tony pointed out. “Many, many unfeasibly tall and broad guards. You’ve bottlenecked all entry points pretty effectively here; D’Artagnan either has to portal in and risk ending up in solid rock, or fight his way through the entire cast of the Gladiators. You could go and play hero with the rest of them, although God knows how you managed to con Vision into going along with that.”
(If Tony had been a betting man, he’d have placed odds on why no one had protested Mordo deciding to sit with Tony rather than with one of the people who was capable of restraining him. And those reasons would have started with,
The woman on the other side of Barnes - Tony vaguely remembered seeing her somewhere, although he couldn’t immediately place her - snorted at this. “You think he is an ice cube? It is that easy to take him out of suspension and put him back in it with no effects?”
“You are literally the most annoying man on the planet,” Barton had said in exasperation. “Will you just - stay put for a
, but my headcanon for the Avengers Initiative is that it's a subsidiary to Stark Industries (to prevent people from suing SI if Thor's hammer takes out their bakery shop, for instance) which of course would need to become independent if the Accords were coming into play. Either the IFRC or Save the Children federated models would work, or a UN-affiliated agency model, and I think the latter makes more sense if you're not lacking for funding. It would be self-regulating, subject to other UN instruments rather than national enforcement, and the US army wouldn't be able to overrule decisions. That said... the whole Accords storyline is a mess in the MCU so idk how much of this will remain internally consistent. Let's just chalk it up to artistic licence.
Shuri tipped her head to one side and smiled a little sadly. “I think you are enough like my brother to guess.”
“Right,” Tony bit off, “just like you didn’t place him in danger to lure this guy here?” He could feel his pulse, hot and thick, thudding in his ears. They couldn’t do this. This wasn’t - it’d been bad enough he’d taken Peter with him to Berlin, when the kid was barely in his teens. It had been awful, a mistake, and he still woke up in a cold sweat thinking about everything that could have gone wrong. And now, now, what, he was supposed to be OK with taking Steve to a battlefield? Steve, who had asthma, who clung to Tony in his terror, who was alone and helpless and
Tony glanced over his shoulder, at the still-sleeping Steve. “Well, I don’t have anything else in my day-planner other than hanging around here. Did you have some urgent appointment?”
Tony couldn’t imagine it. He hadn’t ever done anything like that himself, of course; if he’d done anything like that, a kidnapping would have been almost guaranteed. He didn’t think that’s where Barton’s story was going, not by the soft expression on his face, creased with warm remembrance, but… “Where was she?” He prompted.
!” There was something frantic in the way he said that, the cup of ice chips clattering, Barton’s eyes wide as if bracing himself against the possibility of it, as if even saying it could make it true.
He hadn’t wanted to wait until later in the day. It was nearly noon already; for all that they were flying west-wards, they’d need to get going soon unless they wanted to fly through the night. (Tony really, really didn’t want to fly through the night with a scared child, having done that once already.)
he thought, but did not say. (He still had not answered any of Peter’s messages. Better the kid have some time to cool off. Better he think Germany was an aberration, a mistake.)
“Her Royal Highness Princess Shuri relayed her compliments, and has issued an invitation for you and your ward to join her at your earliest convenience.”
Barton’s expression had settled into something carefully bland. “I was, uh, actually referring to you leaving without saying your goodbyes. Unless you think that’s gonna put you in Nat’s good books?”
That voice sounded like the thing inside him felt, shaken and scared. (It’s a child, he realised. For all that he’d thought it frightening and strong, part of that fear was because it was
Tony stared back at Lang, nonplussed. Wanda had a similarly confused expression on her face; Natasha looked carefully blank.
Tony stared up at him, barely conscious, unable to speak or scream through his exhaustion. He could see the concentration on Yinsen’s face as he gently positioned the heavy magnet, encasing it in something slimy and stinging before readying it to slide it in. (Antiseptic, he would think later. Yinsen must have bathed him in the stuff. How the hell had Yinsen kept him from getting infected?)
Tony wants to meet Natasha half-way, but half-way for that relationship isn't 'halfway to being friends'. It's mostly 'halfway to a clean slate', which sounds a bit weird, but Tony holds grudges so for him to be willing to let even part of that go is a big deal. We'll see how well it goes.
“I think you need to stay here,” Barton said after a moment. “Steve needs someone around him he knows, and if someone attacks him here you’re his best chance of getting out alive. And…” his gaze slid over to Rhodey and away again. A faint pink tinge appeared in his cheeks. “And we had to come up with a reason for you to visit Wakanda that wouldn’t be questioned by Ross. So…”
“Yeah, fuck you, we’re not doing this now.” Barton grabbed Tony’s elbow, fingers pressing in on the nerves with unerring accuracy. Tony winced as he was dragged to Barton’s side, their walk through the hospital resuming with only the minimum amount of notice from the other patients they passed. “You wanna have this out, we do this later,” Barton said under his breath. “We get this all sorted and stop the fucker who’s killing those kids and sure, we’ll go down to the gym after it’s all put to bed and beat the living crap out of each other. But until we do that, until this is sorted,
Tony took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “I’m going back to the US. And I’m taking Steve with me. Keeping him in limbo isn’t fair, he needs stability. T’Challa’s sister - she’s the one who built Barnes that arm - has a lab out there, in Oakland. I’m gonna take Steve there. I’m… I don’t know what I’m going to do next, but until we figure out how to turn him back, he’s staying with me.” He met Rhodey’s gaze head-on, shoulders squaring as if for a fight. “I’m… I’m keeping him.”
He made himself a pot with the little French press provided in the kitchenette and sat back down at the desk with the box of data. Rogers’s audio records were in one corner of the box on what he assumed was the Wakandan equivalent of a thumb drive (either that, or Romanoff had given him some decorative rocks by mistake).
them. Rhodey had only been out of hospital for a few days; Tony would have bet all the money at his disposal that he’d been warned against flying for a while yet. No wonder Wilson had gone ballistic that he’d not only flown long distance, but flown
Hands landed on him, and that hurt as well. Someone he cared about was shouting, or screaming, or crying, and it mattered, it
She stepped towards the figures, touching Steve’s face, tracing the outline as it shimmered and changed.
kind of trade, old man. I don't do geriatrics.” Certainly not when he still feels like he's bleeding out and standing upright is his achievement of the day. “No, I'm gonna need a favor. A small one, really.” He shrugs a little. “Call it a balancing of the scales.”
It took almost ten minutes of the push and pull, of the swordsman’s power testing the bracelets and Wanda tightening her grip on him. It wasn’t just raw power that was at stake, of course; they didn’t want him incapacitated if they could use him. They just wanted him… contained. Wrapped up tight inside the dampeners, held and contained and
Tony stared at the closed door, shifting Steve in his grip. The child had gone limp with relief the moment he was back in Tony’s arms, the exertion of his lunge across the bed exhausting him. He was visibly slipping into sleep, his breathing wet and pained-sounding. “Are you kidding me? I’m offering, and he -”
“Perhaps we should wake the others,” Okoye broke in gently, glancing between Minoru and Tony. “We have a long journey back.” At Minoru’s nod, she led both her and Mordo towards the quinjet, looking at Tony over her shoulder then steering both the magic-users away.
So yeah, it was entirely possible that Nat’s position had been laid bare for him. He just couldn’t bring himself to taker her word on it, no matter how appealing it might have been to think that she was just looking out for them.
“Definitely a magic user,” Barton said, his voice tight. He glanced at Tony and looked away when he accidentally made eye contact. “And whatever it is they’re planning, it’s not small potatoes.”
Certainly not when Tony was stuck halfway around the world and couldn’t poke at their tech with anything more substantial than a hologrammatic digit. Well, that was something to think on, certainly; with Mordo no longer intent on skewering Steve, there wasn’t a particular reason for them to be holed up in Jabariland. Tony could just pick up the kid, and - “Gimme a sec.”
“He hates everyone,” Tony dismissed this with a wave of his hand. The feeling was very much mutual. He might respect Richard Smith’s business acumen, but the man was Chair of his Finance & Audit Committee (as well as deputy to Tony’s Chairship of the overall Board) and therefore the biggest pain in Tony’s ass since, well, Fury.
“I need a copy of all the data you have,” he said, and Barnes nodded. “Everything, Barnes. I’ve had enough of this cherry-picking.”
Obie had asked him the first time he’d OD’d and ended up in hospital after his parents had died. (He’d OD’d before, of course, but it had never been quite as bad - or as calculated - as this.)
Wazungu is the plural of ‘mzungu’, a common word for ‘foreigner’ or ‘white skin’ in the Bantu language of the African Great Lakes. Black Panther seemed to confirm my vague feeling that in the MCU, Wakanda is the north-west part of Tanzania, i.e. west of Lake Victoria, albeit with significantly different topology!
She’d looked after Steve. She’d made sure he was OK, she’d put him to bed. And she would have - she must have - called M’Baku when he wouldn’t quieten down, to try to find a way to reassure him. She could have left him on his own; she could have handed him over to someone else and guarded him from the outside. She could have done anything other than stay with him and try to make sure he wasn’t scared.
thing I never wanted -” Her voice broke. She brushed away the tears on her cheeks angrily, scrubbing at her eyes with the same furious, helpless gesture that -
(The light was in his eyes and he squeezed them shut, trying to block it out, trying to breathe, trying to talk himself back from a gurney in another cave, years ago, the restraints inadequate against the terror and the pain.)
Barnes shrugged. “Hard to shield either of you if you’re not right next to me. Maximoff is outside the door. The Jabari guards are securing the corridors, and the Dora will be guarding the attacker, once we get him.”
He wondered if his choice to leave Mordo and the others back at the jet was overly cautious. But - no, no, it was the correct decision. If the Hong Kong temple was just as fanatical as Mordo was (and what temple did
He fought off the flare of irritation that surged through him. He couldn’t figure out what was making him so angry. Moving the kid to the US was the right thing to do. Moving himself away from Natasha, and Wanda, and everyone else who had so many opinions on what he needed to do and how he needed to feel was probably vital for his continued sanity. (Barnes and Barton notwithstanding, and it would be different when they were on Tony’s home turf.) And not letting this latest crisis distract him from preparing for the greater threats that still waited and lingered and built in the shadows was doubtless one of the more sensible things he’d ever done.
we catch him.” He looked at the child still hiding behind Tony and pulled out the smallest gun. “I assume you’re most comfortable with the suit weapons. Can he handle one of these?”
as Maximoff’s bracelet suddenly opened in response, clattering to the ground, and she reached for the swordsman with her magic.
“I gotta tell you, doc, I’ve never had to sit an exam on going to the bathroom before,” Tony tried, his voice a bit shaky despite the bravura.
“How are the others?” He didn’t even have the option of setting Steve down somewhere and going back to help; not if the guy could just magic himself back to the kid whenever he pleased. No, he needed to keep them out of reach and moving, and the best he could do was hope that there hadn’t been any further casualties. “Have they checked in?”
The bath took longer than planned. Steve had evidently decided that jam today was better than jam tomorrow (so to speak), and he took full advantage of the opportunity to cover himself, Tony, and the entire bathroom in water. Tony made sure that he didn’t drown (and that he was at least vaguely approaching cleanliness) but otherwise left him to splash about. Packing would probably be easier if he didn’t have the child underfoot, anyway. He made sure that the child safeties were on (and that idea was definitely something he was stealing and reverse-engineering as soon as humanly possible) and left Steve to amuse himself while he checked that he had all of the child’s medication and any other necessities packed. He didn’t have much of his own stuff here, obviously, having arrived in just the suit, but Steve had already been subjected to a number of losses and Tony didn’t want to add to that by accidentally leaving behind a favourite crayon or, well, whatever it was that Steve had become attached to and failed to tell anyone about. (There was bound to be something; that was how kids worked, right?)
“Umar is active again,” Mordo rasped, trying without much success to pull free of Minoru’s grasp. “You know what she will do if she is allowed to access - let
Steve submitted to being ruffled without complaint. “OK.” He grabbed on to Tony’s arm and climbed up on his lap like a child much younger, or at least one still used to being carried.
He could take the child. He could take the child, and try to find out what was happening, for good or ill. Surely even Steve couldn’t fault him for that. And besides…
All he could offer her was neutrality. They weren’t friends - they never had been, probably, because they were both too good at this; Tony too good at putting up walls and Natasha too good at wearing masks - but they didn’t have to be, not for this. They could - maybe, possibly,
A little startled - this child version hadn’t really spent any time with her - Steve shied away and hid against Tony’s leg.
“Peachy.” Tony tore his eyes away from Barnes, who seemed to be trying to disappear into the corner, and looked down at Rhodey, forcing himself to turn away. “How was physio?”
(He was at MIT, and he had Rhodey just down the hall, and he had his finals to think about, and as long as he didn’t open his eyes, his mom was back home, just a phone-call away.)
“Since - I don’t know, sometime during the night,” Tony said, his hackles rising despite his best intentions. “Look, I know I should have done something, but…” But he hadn’t known what to do. So he’d hoped it would go away, or at least wait until they were in Wakanda, in a hospital with proper medicine and, you know,
“Hey, come on, now. Come on.” Tony awkwardly gathered up the bundled child in his arms, easing the bedlinen away from his red and blotchy face. “Covering your face up like that won’t help your breathing. Come on, now.”
Rhodey waved a hand, a hint of a smile on his smile. “You’ll be pleased to know that this doesn’t even come close to making my list of Top 5 Incredibly Stupid Things Tony Has Ever Done. I’m not gonna lie, you’ve made smarter choices, but it’s not like this is coming out of left-field. You’ve always been a little soft-headed that way.” He dimpled suddenly. “Hey, does this mean that I’m gonna be an uncle?”
“What would be?” She waited a moment, then plunged on. “There’s nothing I can say that will make you trust me on this. Not when it comes to -“ She waved a hand vaguely to where Barton had exited, Steve in his arms.
“Oh, yes. Of that, you can be sure.” Mordo looked back down at his wrists, at the faint glow of Wanda’s magic on the bracelets keeping him in check.
Rhodey had to let go of his hand to use the wheelchair. Tony left his hand on Rhodey’s shoulder instead.
“I don’t know who that man is,” Steve sobbed into Tony’s shoulder, tiny and heart-broken. “But he’s not Bucky. He’s not!”
Tony glanced up. Barton was rubbing a hand over his face, fingers skirting the edges of the bruising that had still yet to completely fade.
(Because if there was one thing that Tony had known he’d always excelled at, it was in hurting people who loved him.)
He reached out and carefully took one of the little hands in his, mindful of the needle. “Hey, kid,” he whispered. “You’re doing great. I’m here, okay? I’m not going anywhere.” He looked back over his shoulder. “Did they say when they need me at the debrief?”
Tony brought him the LifeStraw - filled from the water tank on the way back - and a couple of packages of the Plumpy’nut. “You hungry? Or thirsty?” Should have probably asked that earlier, but… other priorities.
Coming up next: Steve gets out of the PICU! Tony realises just what he's let himself in for! And we find out a little more about what's actually going on...
It was a fairly ambitious piece of artwork for a seven-year-old, no matter how artistically inclined. Steve had clearly attempted to add some perspective to the drawing, because the flowers on the ground were meticulously drawn in miniature, and the curved branches of the baobab tree from the Birnin Zana palace gardens framed the scene. In the middle of it all, carefully drawn in Steve’s childish hand, was a stylised Iron Man holding the hand of a blonde-haired boy who optimistically came up to about his shoulders. On Steve’s other side was a woman with long blonde hair. She was wearing an apron.
Fuck it. He was worried. It wasn't - quite - the sort of worry that had Happy sending him frequent updates on the spider-kid; it wasn't even the sort of worry that had led him to get a tracker on Pepper, and Happy, and Rhodey (and now Steve). It was different, wasn't it? The Peter thing was pretty close, sure, but Peter... he had his aunt, and Happy was watching out for him, and the suit would keep him out of trouble. Peter would be fine, and the best thing Tony could do for him was to keep his distance. (No matter how much he might want to just check on the suit’s location.)
Wilson sighed. “I could have told her it was a bad idea. Barton, too. For a pair of super-spies, those two have the subtlety of a brick shithouse.”
rage? But no, Tony had gone straight for where the blood spatter still lay undisturbed around the corpse of their former friendship.
Tony fought the urge to laugh. His stomach was clenched into a painful knot, his chest heaving. He desperately wanted to close the faceplate, to have the familiar screen be the barrier between him and Romanoff’s disconcerting presence, but he couldn’t quite figure out a way to do so without it being a cowardly move. “I wonder what Rogers would say if he knew you shared his secrets so easily,” he said instead, trying to find her soft underbelly. “That you’re all on board with dangling him in front of a sword-wielding maniac. That - that you put him in my care. Christ, I thought you had it out for me, but maybe this is what you think friendship is like, huh? Flaying someone so they have no armour left. Too hard to break out of your pattern of looking for that goddamned weak spot.”
Tony waved that away. “Semantics. Now sit down and explain yourself, or let me get in the suit before I hit you. You heard the doctor, you’re not allowed to hit back.”
“Just lemon is fine,” Tony interrupted, looking out into the empty hallway before closing the door. He could have sworn that there were guards stationed nearby, but… Hadn’t Dhakiya said that there were guards available and within earshot? What did ‘earshot’ mean in this instance? (And how long would it take them to reach the rooms, if…) “I guess you know this part of the palace pretty well, huh?”
“Well, you’re not wrong. You’re meant to be… older. And, uh, obviously I know you. The older you.” He waved a hand vaguely. “We’re, uh, friends.”
kid to watch, and then the security to organise… So who is going to be watching your back while you walk around with a giant target strapped to it?”
“Well, according to the papers, I can absolutely change my mind,” Tony said, flipping through the paperwork, pen in hand. “All I have to do is notify the court with sufficient notice for them to make alternate arrangements.” Not that he would. If he couldn’t cope, he’d just bring in help; he wasn’t signing the kid over to some
the capitalist pig coloniser before hating him? “Here,” the nurse said, offering him a bottle of something that smelled minty. “For the aftertaste. Swish, then spit.”
So, yeah, he’d sent an encrypted data squirt via FRIDAY, and rousted Pep and Happy from bed. If something went catastrophically wrong, between them, they’d make sure things were taken care of. Themselves, the bots, the company and the staff, the kids and their families -
“You know, you really have a funny way of trying to get people to trust you,” he said. “You make bait out of everyone you’re trying to make peace with?”
T’Challa cleared his throat noisily and Tony managed to snap his mouth shut over whatever else wanted to spill out.
Something cold gripped Tony’s chest. He looked down at Steve’s messy blonde hair, at the way he hid his face against Tony’s chest and tried to block out the words.
Oh, there they were. He let Wilson slide them on to his feet mutinously, avoiding eye contact. He’d let the team look after him before - post-battle, or during illnesses - so why did this feel different?
He hoped that their welcome party would arrive soon, and that they’d bring painkillers with them. And
No, Barton had a copy of the data Tony had gathered on the bodies and the arrangement of the limbs.  He could handle it. Tony could just send through anything relevant the doctors found in their examination of the kid and…
“I figure, as long as we’re being upfront about the stabbing, we can probably do it in the chest and not the back.” He met her eyes, making his expression as blank as possible.
“She said this was everything?” Tony asked, scrolling through the notes. He’d put Steve to bed and stayed up to review the data packet that Barton brought him. Barnes and Maximoff had retired to their perimeter - joined, apparently, by Romanoff - and as it was the middle of the night, hopefully both Rhodey and Wilson were asleep back in Birnin Zana. As he was at least a week behind everyone else in intel, Tony wasn’t going to waste time on sleep. One of the graphs had a measure of the trace radiation in Steve’s system since his arrival at Birnin Zana - he’d been right about the unobtrusive monitoring throughout - as well as a comparison to the samples taken by the hospital. The samples stayed steady, but Steve’s measurements had a spike for some reason part-way through. That was odd.
He felt a pang of guilt as he thought it. Rogers’s actions had nothing to do with the kid; it wasn’t healthy to lump him in with all that had gone wrong between them. It’s not like the kid had any choice about being there.
“I’m gonna be back in a few hours,” he promised the little boy, feeling his heart clench. “I’ll be there before you wake up in the morning, I promise. I’m sorry I wasn’t there when things got scary for you today. Can you tell me about it?”
Crouched beside the pallet, Barton narrowly escaped getting punched by virtue of toppling backwards on his ass instead. “Hey, steady!”
were two very different things. And Tony was not going to put down roots here while the rest of the team(s?) went traipsing around the world to track down Dumbledore.
Steve was silent for a long time. “Does that mean - if I’m supposed to be him - is that why we’re not going back home? Because it’s not there anymore?”
“Did… did it have anything to do with you stabbing random people? ‘Cause, let me tell you, at the moment I’m mostly on
That brought Tony to a standstill. He turned on Barton, his expression furious. “In my corner?” he asked incredulously. “Fuck you, Barton, in what way are you ‘in my corner’? When you said all that crap about Rhodey? Or when you dropped everything and went running after Rogers when he crooked his little finger at you? Because from where I’m standing, that’s a long fucking way from being ‘in my corner’.”
