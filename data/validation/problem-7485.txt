Tony shivered again, letting his head loll to the side. "You're a menace, Rogers," he murmured, but it was low and throaty and Steve could hear in his voice that he was seconds from caving. "And just what else did you have in mind, hmm? We're not honestly spending all day getting seaweed wraps and pedicures are we?"
Tony moaned, shuddered again down to his toes, felt his asshole spasm weakly around Steve. More come leaked out of him, and Tony whimpered into his fists. "
"Steve, I checked your blood two hours ago, you can't consent—"
. He pressed one long, sucking kiss to Tony's abdomen. "Say that again after I show you how I look in my new outfit," he said, eyes glittering with mischief as he licked slowly at his lips.
Tony hummed, blinked his eyes dopily up at Steve. "Yeah," he said, his lips pulling into a wide, beaming grin. "I can do that. For you."
Steve narrowed his eyes. While that was true, he also knew that Tony had a tendency towards the dramatics, knew how keyed up Steve was over this whole thing — perhaps he'd simply been sitting in the other room, biding his time while Steve slowly went mad from the wait.
, Tony," Steve begged, hunching his shoulders in an attempt to make himself look smaller and more pitiful. His brows were furrowed, eyes wide and just a little bit dewy. He might have even batted his lashes once or twice.
Tony blinked away the heat and sudden moisture in his eyes. "N-no darling," he whispered, biting at his lower lip. "That's not why I'm here."
Tony let go of his cock with a lewd, loud
"So," Tony eventually said, wrapping his other arm tight around Steve. "How do you feel, honey? Did you enjoy yourself?"
"Go to sleep," Steve grunted, cuffing the side of Tony's head. Tony continued to wiggle in his arms, and Steve sighed, shifting the two of them so they were spooning, so Steve could thread their fingers together. "I'll still be here in the morning."
Tony moaned aloud, even as he felt the back of his neck heat. He scrabbled at Steve's shoulders and held on for dear life as Steve trembled and shook and kissed Tony within an inch of his life, all sharp teeth and wet, sloppy tongue. Steve jerked again, and Tony could feel another gush of come spurt out along his thigh, and Steve shivered uncontrollably, his mouth going soft and lax under his. Tony pulled him forward, so Steve's forehead was resting on his shoulder, and petted him through the aftershocks, one hand in his hair and one rubbing soothingly down his flank.
. "Sorry about that - I'll make you a better one next go-around," Tony promised, politely turning to the side when Steve started on the soaked, clinging-to-the-skin leather pants.
Oh, Tony was going to hell. "S-Steve," he stuttered, one hand shooting up to wipe at his beard (he couldn't be drooling - that would be perverse, it would be so inappropriate, but he had to check, alright? He had to be
"Awful," he agreed, spitting another mouthful of yellow-orange saliva on the cement. "'S just the adrenaline. 'Happens after a fight." And well, Tony supposed that made sense in a fight-or-flight type of way - just because the fight was over before it even started didn't mean that rush of adrenaline would magically disappear right along with it.
Steve's throat felt tight. "I'm so sorry," he whispered, face screwing in misery. He gently brushed a hand down a particular nasty purple bruise that extended all the way down his backside. "I was too rough with you."
Steve bit his lip against the sudden well of emotion, nosing into Tony's hair and breathing in deep. "Love you, Shellhead," he whispered tightly. Tony's breath hitched.
"Jesus," Steve breathed, collapsing to his knees and ever-so-carefully pressing a hand to Tony's backside. Tony shuddered, but didn't yell at him or shrug him off, so Steve began to rub gentle circles between his shoulder blades, like his mother had once done when he was a sick and weakly thing. "Is this—" Steve hesitated. "Is this because of…?"
"Jarvis," Tony started, sipping at a martini. "Will you bring me my pills? And some Zofran, if you would."
"Hey, shh," Tony murmured, twisted a stray lock between his fingers. He tossed a leg over Steve's waist, smearing come everywhere, but Steve didn't care because all he needed was Tony. One hot tear slipped down his cheek.
Steve huffed, and his muscles rippled under his skin. "You can make time," he grunted, letting go of Tony's arm, his hand coming away dripping with the green goo from Tony's skin and -
"Tony, I know—" Steve sobbed again.
"C'mon, tiger, give it to me honey," Tony urged, bowing his back as if he could cement himself even closer to Steve, tie them together tighter than flesh. "Oh-" he gasped, bit down on his lip, tried to suck all the wayward saliva back into his mouth. "Oh,
"Doin' okay?" Steve asked, low and heady as he tried to fuck him loose. There was the
Steve couldn't stop kissing him.
Steve, the tyrant, didn't seem content to let him snuggle. "Shower time, fella," he whispered, rubbing his thumb along the back of Tony's neck, and then he was helping a grumbling Tony to stand and make his way over to the shower.
Steve sighed, his breath tickling the back of Tony's neck. "It does hurt," he admitted, "but I'd rather hurt for a little bit than not give you a break while I can."
"Yeah?" Steve asked, all wide- and glassy-eyed, his cheeks flushed a pretty coral pink, and Tony wanted to just kiss him, to feel the warmth of Steve's desire on his lips, and how sick did that make him? A normal person—a
"Please," Steve hiccuped, gritting his teeth and trying not to buck too hard when Tony's fingers brushed his dick. "Just go back to
going to need to consider a more long-term solution? Was— was Tony going to have to need to call in a-a professional, because he wouldn't be able to help Steve through this? "I may need to up my game," Tony joked, trying for levity as he climbed into Steve's lap and looped his arms around him. Steve frowned up at him and Tony couldn't help the angry little prickle it sent up his spine. "What, darling? Am I that boring for you already?" he asked, a bit snidely, and Steve sighed, lifted his hands up and to either side of Tony's waist.
He knew the doctor was speaking, that Tony was dependent on him for the steps to come, that he should be taking notes and getting paperwork and aftercare instructions, but all he could think about was the half a building that had fallen on Tony and broken his leg in three places, fractured his hip, given him one hell of a shiner and a nasty concussion to boot. All Steve could look at was the plaster on Tony's leg, the cast on his arm, the stark rings of bruising around Tony's nose and eyes. He thanked the doctor very politely, then very firmly dismissed him from the room so he could frown down at Tony disapprovingly.
"Warm water?" Steve asked, and Tony hummed because yeah, that sounded wonderful. Steve twisted the taps, ran his hand under the gently running water, and when it was the right temperature he spun the attachment onto the faucet and released the clamp holding the end of the hose shut. Tony gasped, and then hummed softly when the warm water started sliding inside him. He'd felt so stuffed, and wet and messy for so long, that even the first tricklings of water in his ass was enough to make him feel clean again. Tony shifted, felt his insides start to warm, and relaxed into it with a smile.
"You are

"Hey, hey, hey it's okay," Tony soothed and moved to stand, even though his legs still felt like jelly. Steve was beside him in a heartbeat though, pushing him back into the tub with a gentle hand. Tony still grabbed onto Steve's wrist, thumb rubbing against the soft skin of him. "Hey, Steve. Darling. No one blames you, okay? None of this is your fault, sweetheart."
Steve came, and felt the blissful dark rush up to claim him.
"Of course, darling, I'm sure Steve will understand that you didn't mean it when his
" Hawkeye grunted and shut off his comm.
"Cap?" Tony asked, suddenly worried that Steve could feel his pulse jackrabbiting where his thumb was tucked around the underside of his wrist.
"I've got you, Shellhead," Steve murmured, kissed his neck, and began to move.
you, I'm not kidding, Thor—" the other man shouted again, throwing himself between the two of them, spreading his purple-clad arms out wide and trying to put some distance between the two of them.
That was… possibly one of the hottest things Tony had ever seen in his entire
Tony's back dipped and hit the bed and Steve was running his hands up Tony's stockings, spreading his legs and lifting them over his shoulders so he could lap at Tony's ass. Tony moaned, shifting in place, digging his fingers into the bedspread.
"I got you, honey, I got you," Tony soothed and rubbed his hands, soft and soothing up and down Steve's flank. "Come on, baby - scoot up a bit." Tony urged him to shuffle forward, so that Steve's cock was slipping hot and damp against the skin of his cheek. "Yeah," Tony murmured, shivering. "Just like that, slugger. Now you just— just go to town, alright? If I need you to stop, I'll squeeze your thigh just like this." Tony squeezed Steve twice in quick succession, though if he was being fair it was more for Steve's benefit than his own. Who knew if Steve would even
"You want the clamps?" Steve asked, one hand stroking idly down his side and around to circle around a nipple.
They had a lot of lost time to make up for, after all.
Tony smacked him half-heartedly across the chest. "You- you
And Steve was still.
," Tony gasped. "Darling, please, you're going to kill me, just— get inside me—"
, and you expect be to believe you can consent to
"Turn towards me, baby," Steve said, reaching his arms out, and Tony was immediately shifting, twisting his torso and legs around so he could shuffle over to the side of the bed, closer to Steve. "Good boy," Steve praised, and Tony basked in, wanted to take Steve's praise and bottle it up and keep it there forever, right below his breastbone.
Really, a shower was the best option, but Tony didn't think he had the energy to pull the plug out of his ass, let alone shower and shave and clean all the funk off of him. Tony's lips twisted. "Do you mind running the bath for me?" he asked, taking a long swallow from his water bottle and trying not to shift too noticeably. It didn't matter how he sat, how he shifted or moved his ass; the hot, bruising weight of the plug moved with him. Tony suppressed a shudder. Maybe he could get away with not shaving until this whole thing blew over.
"Good boy," Steve praised, effusive as he could make it, and Tony moaned, cock plumping up just a hair in his grip. "I'm gonna finish getting you ready now," he murmured, "and then I'm gonna take you."
Steve huffed and kissed Tony again, soft and slow. Tony hummed happily, his toes curling, and snuggled even closer, his tongue darting out to wet at Steve's lower lip. Steve hummed, pulling back so he could give Tony one, two, three separate, slow, sensual kisses.
Tony's dick may have foolishly tried to come again.
"I.... suppose we could make a day of it," Tony finally allowed, fingertips slipping along and under the waistband of Steve's jeans, the ultra-fitted dark wash pair he put on specifically to go downstairs to talk to Tony with.
"Steve," Tony whispered gently. "Sweetheart, I know it's hard for you right now, but I want you to listen to me, okay?" This was— this was all kinds of wrong, Tony, he was just as bad as Tiberius Stone, he was as bad as
Tony gasped, a shiver twisting down his spine, when one of Steve's palms slid down his hip, up the back of his thigh to cup under the globe of his ass. "Steve—" he choked out, and Steve's grin sharpened, his eyes slitting like a cat's as he massaged the meat of his ass. His other hand splayed across Tony's groin, fingers framing the obscene jut of his cock, hot and needy and dripping with his desire, and the tight swell of his balls practically vibrating with their need to come. "Steve—" Tony tried again.
"Okay baby," Steve murmured; he petted at Tony's back, slick with lube and sweat, and Tony wanted to squirm. Steve merely chuckled, dropping a kiss to his hair, and crawled to the edge of the bed. A few seconds later, the fucking machine was slowing down, and then stopping entirely, and Tony immediately gasped at the sensation, or lack thereof, almost like pins and needles inside his ass. "Yeah, look at you, Shellhead," Steve breathed out, chest heaving. Two fingers slipped inside easily, then a third, and Tony couldn't help the high whimper he felt build in the back of his throat.
It was the least he could do for him.
you."
"'V'e, never done this before," Steve said brusquely, but he did spread his fingers ever so slightly, groaned at the sight of Tony's ass stretching around him, even as Tony's insides clung to him so tightly. Lube squelched wetly, loudly between his fingers, the most intimate part of Tony's body, so sweetly opening up for him. "'M not gonna hurt you just to get my dick in you a lit'le quicker." Tony moaned below him, almost a shout, and he whined and panted and shuddered underneath Steve, his cock finally hard and flushed and pearling with precome between them. "Fellas aren't s'pposed to be pretty," he murmured, dipping his ring finger into the lube on the sheets and adding it to the two already inside him, "but hell, hell Tony, I've almost never seen someone so pretty." Tony sobbed, jerked underneath Steve, and Steve rubbed soothingly at him, inside and out.
"Face wash, I know," Steve called back, dipping into Tony's enormous shower to grab the tube from the ledge.
, Tony thought hysterically, biting on his tongue 'till he tasted blood and came, all over Steve's hand. Everything from his lips to his toes quickly became hypersensitive, bordering on painful, but Tony just kept rolling back against Steve, clenching down on every stroke so he could get Steve off. "I want— I want—" Tony choked wetly, those first few humiliating tears slipping down his cheeks and making him cough. "I want to be good for you," he finished miserably, the safest thing he could say with his legs still trembling and endorphins flooding through his central nervous system. Tony couldn't stop shivering — was sweating, but everywhere Steve wasn't touching him felt ice cold, and he alternated between crowding closer to and jerking away from Steve's touch. His face felt wet. "Please, please Steve, I just want to make it good for you—" Tony sobbed, clutching at Steve's hand and winding their fingers together. His skin was on fire. "Please, please— am I-I, am I good? Am I being good? For you?" Tony's brain was winding itself up more and more and he couldn't get it to shut off—
explode," Tony shouted, throwing his tablet at the wall.
"Can I—?" Steve blurted, immediately horrified, but couldn't make himself take the words back, even after his face and neck flushed humiliatingly red. Tony paused, his eyes widening as he looked back up at Steve, his jaw dropping a little. His hand reappeared, the digits slick and dripping, and Steve groaned aloud. "Please," Steve begged, and suddenly he didn't care how desperate, and-and-and weak he sounded. He needed to— he needed to— "Please, I want to," Steve whispered.
, Tony was going to hell—
"I'm ready, Winghead," Tony groaned, and Steve slipped his fingers under the garter and began the slow slide in and‒
Then Steve heard it again — a low, miserable whimper of pain, followed by the sound of someone being sick in the toilet. Steve was running to the bathroom before he was even aware his feet were moving. "Tony—?" Steve gasped, skidding on the tile.
"Am I going to have to walk barefoot out of this facility?" Tony said with a heavy sigh. "Someone could at least bring me a martini if I can't get my slippers."
"We could try one of the Hulk tranquilizers?"
"Darling," Tony croaked, ducking his head so he could rub the side of his face against Steve's overwarm thigh, "Darling, I— I have never wanted
Who was Tony to deny him?
"Shhh, my turn now, darling," Tony whispered. "I'm stronger than that, and you know it. I put on a big metal suit and fight the same villains as you,
Steve knew that Tony liked having spa days, that he enjoyed the time to unwind (to 'unplug', he would often say with a smirk at his own awful joke) and spare a moment of indulgence between battles. Steve also knew, unfortunately, that Tony didn't relax as much as he needed to ‒ whether he was too busy or stressed or didn't think he deserved the luxury, or that he was too stuck in his own head to the point that he thought the act of being pampered made him less masculine. Steve could see the signs of wear and tear in his long-time friend-cum-occasional-bedmate-now… partner? Boyfriend?
okay, it was
Tony huffed into the crook of Steve's neck, a little wet and wobbly. "Honey, i— it was stupid, let's just drop it, yeah?" he croaked. "I'm really, honestly, I'm fine with it."
Their date had been perfect.
-" Steve sucked at the tip of Tony's cock, at the fat, swollen head, swirled his tongue into the slit and under the crown. Steve moaned, sucked harder at him, and tightened his grip on Tony's shaft. Oh god, it hurt, almost, the intense pleasure burning through him, the hot, heavy sting of stimulation over his cock, rumbling in his belly and rising up behind his balls. "Oh, Steve, jesus, I'm gonna come-"
"Hey, hey, there's nothing to be ashamed of here," Tony murmured, fingers gently scratching at a thick furred thigh. "You've been like this for hours, right? Anyone would be ready to go off." Steve snorted, his cheeks warming to a pretty shade of pink, and Tony took the small victory for what it was. "Now it looks like this fella still needs a little help," Tony continued with a grin, fingers wrapping one by one over the base of Steve's shaft. Steve grunted, his hips jumping, and he bit down on the fleshy part of his forearm. "Do you mind if I…?" Tony asked gently.
. He just— he just wanted to make sure Tony was alright. He wanted to talk to Tony. He wanted to hold him and tell him he missed him.
he felt, leaking lube all over his legs, Steve's lap,
"Calories," Tony murmured with a lazy hand wave in the direction of probably-a-cooler, and Steve snorted out a laugh and shoved a piece of his own protein bar in Tony's mouth, his thumb lingering on his lower lip afterwards.
"Steve, p-please," Tony moaned, arching back into the soft thrusts. His throat felt tight and swollen, hotter with every swipe of Steve's thumb against his slit. "P-Please, I-I want—"
, or unable to please his lovers, or anything like that. No one he'd ever shared his bed with had certainly complained.
Steve nodded against his arm. "Please," he whispered, and how could Tony not?
Something akin to contentment settled in under his skin. "It was absolutely my pleasure," Tony whispered softly. There was only so much bravado he could display, naked in bed with Steve though, so after a moment he murmured, "...Thank you, Steve."
, he thought fuzzily, though he wasn't sure who he meant - him or Steve.
and seconds later Tony could feel Steve's come striping his thighs, his dick, his stomach, and Tony moaned weakly, another valiant twitch coming from his legs and cock.
Tony felt suddenly a little lost, tilting his head to the side a bit in his confusion. "I thought‒" he started, the words slow and sloppy on his tongue, "I thought you wanted to top tonight, honey?" They'd talked about it, earlier, like they usually did, and Tony had laid out under Steve and started going down into his headspace and‒ But this was fine, it was good, Tony could top, he just needed a minute to recalibrate‒
Emotion bubbled up inside him, swirled around in his chest and stomach, made the tears heat up behind his eyes again. "Oh, Tony, I— God," he whispered.
Another moan, almost a shout, burst from Steve's lips, and his cock jerked wetly against his stomach, a thin dribble of come spurting from the tip that Tony immediately zeroed in on and sucked from the sweet, hot, velvety skin of him. "
. He was big.
"Hey," Steve murmured, rolling their foreheads together. "Hey. Honey. Shellhead. Whatever you are thinking right now is
"Hey, hey, I've got you," Steve soothed; he rubbed a hand down Tony's flank, let his fingertips play gently along the ridges of his spine. "Don't you worry, Shellhead, I'm gonna fill you up - just like I promised."
The sensation of movement inside him, sliding hot and soft in his belly, had him sighing, and before long Tony felt like he was full of it to bursting. This wasn't his first rodeo; Tony gave himself enemas fairly regularly (for reasons both sexual and medical), but it still surprised him every time he saw the muscles in his abdomen softening, how everything just sort of… ballooned up under the pressure. He could feel it now, well up into his stomach, the strain and mild cramping, the slight urgency in his lower belly, and Tony felt himself whimper, just a hair. Even then, it was another minute or so before Steve finally turned the tap off, and then he was running his fingertips through Tony's sweat- and water-damp hair.
," he moaned, and the bedspread ripped again as Steve shook again, rolling his head to the side and into the pillow beneath him. "Tony,
Steve's breath left him in a whoosh, chest heaving, his nipples just poking out of his top. Tony couldn't help himself ‒ he dipped his head forward and latched onto one nipple, then the other, alternating between sharp bites and wet, lathering laps of his tongue.
Tony wasn't in his workshop. He wasn't in the kitchen, or his room, or any of the labs or the hangar bay. When Steve tried to call Tony it went straight to voicemail, and Steve couldn't tell if Tony's phone was off or he was just ignoring Steve's calls. Steve passed by the parlor and he could hear Jan and Wanda laughing at something on the television, could smell the snacks they'd piled up beside them. Steve hadn't been out of his room in over a week, but honestly he wasn't sure if he could handle being around people right now. His skin itched, and felt like it was two sizes too small for his body. Steve could feel himself start to sweat.
The lights flickered on and off, and Tony glared up at it. “Can you stop that? I’m trying to work here!”

Steve choked. He had never,
“I wouldn’t think so, but he always gave you more attention than the rest of us. So, to go back to your question, maybe perhaps you were stuck holding onto the past, forgetting that times have changed since then.”
“And you’ve kept your mouth shut for this long because?”
“Save the speech Fury.” Steve turned around, and as he did so, he caught a glimpse of his wings. The wings that should have been hidden away and stuffed out of sight and out of mind. “I don’t want to be a part of it. I did my duty.”
“Grounded, illnesses include asthma, nearsightedness,” the recruiter said. “Do you want me to go on? We need healthy men with the ability to fly.”

“Tell Buck I’ll build him that new sight gauge for the rifle by the end of the week,” Tony replied. “Thanks, J. Protocol six until further notice.”
As he walked away, Tony called back, “don’t think for a second that I’ve given up.”
“And my name isn’t important?” Tony snarked.
“I don’t have one.” Tony looked down. It was true: he didn’t have a mate. He had an Alpha, and a shitty one at that, one who was willing to use anybody and everybody for his own agenda. He had been in hell for years; what was the point of going back, when he was only going to flee from the hell of this to the hell of the pitiful thing he called a pack and the hell of facing justice under the Human Rights Act.
“Shut up Clint,” Tony snarked back, and he weaved his fingers into Steve’s hand. “And he was still better than you’ll ever be.”
“When was the last time you slept?” Steve inquired.
And in a moment, Tony’s eyes blaze, and he prowled forward until he was a mere foot away. “You’re sorry,” he said flatly, poison dripping through every word. “You shouldn’t get to say ‘I’m sorry’ when you put a shield through my chest. We were

It definitely took its toll on his body. Muscle mass lost, permanent bone-weariness, body barely functioning to survive. They knew that he wouldn’t last must longer.
Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and pulled him to the elevator. “I’ll tell you as many times as it takes for you to believe it yourself. JARVIS, to the balcony, please.”
Tony sits on his haunches. “I don’t need protection Steve. I can protect myself. Besides, I like it here because I can toss rocks at stupid dogs."
“I miss her already,” he whispered, finally letting Bucky pull him away.
There was a single gunshot, and Steve instinctively lifted his wings up to shield himself from the attack, turning around and stretching his wings to protect as many people as he could.
They placed the cattleprod upon his naked inner thigh, and Tony let out an ear-piercing scream.
“The one about green futures?” Tony racked his brain, trying to remember what the hell he said.
“But you’re not the one I should talk to, because you’re not real.”
Natasha nodded. “I’m sure. The plate’s his. And even if that is not entirely telling, the fact that the car had been modified to carry an arsenal of weapons does.”

It flickered again before it stayed on. Tony grumbled before turning to his work.
Steve huffs in amusement at their antics before he settles down and nuzzles Tony again. As Steve stands up, he says with a happy smile, “If anything, your friends are already packed up and ready to go." He gently nudges Tony to look at Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy crawling down the tree, cheeks bulging with what is most likely nuts.
"You can come," Steve says casually. With the way that his world is narrowed down to two points and blood is roaring in his ears, it sounds as if Steve is very far away instead of right on top of him.

And it seemed as if she had the same mindset, for she asked, “How about a dance?”
“Oh,” Steve said, looking down at his plate. But he wasn’t flightless, but he could essentially be one, with the way he tucked his wings into their brace every day. He hadn’t stretched his flight muscles in months.
Despite his words, the way that Nebula looked at him disapprovingly had him heading towards the bunks, and besides, and he
next time feel free to step in and save me!
It doesn't matter that Tony feels dirty, wet and sticky with come - Steve holds him down tightly, and all Tony can do is let his come dry on his skin as he falls asleep, wishing that he is a better person, wishing that he could love Steve the way he wants to, and most of all, wishing Steve would love him back.
Steve shouldn’t have turned, but he did because he was an idiot.
Sarah slowly walked over to him, trying to mask her fear and her sadness, coming up to hug him. But he noticed that that hug was slightly more impassioned; she was drawing away from him.
Tony huffed. “I said no, Butterfingers. We can exterminate later. Sorry, Butterfingers can get trigger-happy.”

The shower brought round two, Steve lifting him up bodily and settling him back on his cock. Water dripped into their eyes and mouths and down their bodies, drowning out their screams and moans. Steve held Tony up; Tony clung to Steve desperately, tightly, feeling Steve’s come leaking out of his ass. It was hot, and Tony cried out as Steve held his cock in his hand as he came.
For a few hours, he would grieve for all that he lost. Then he would move on.

Tony called back, “Yes, I am!” He then turned back to Steve. “What are you doing?”
One set of footsteps walked closer to the armor. “Why don’t you go see if the others need help?”
Stevens looked horrified. “I couldn’t,” he mumbled. “I really care for him.”
You must have not been able to find a real man, cuz really, stark? you traded me for a fucking playboy?
“Does that feel good?” Steve asked, moving the finger out until his finger was barely pressed within the walls of his asshole and then pressing back in, pushing until he stopped at the knuckles.
The couch looked good, but as he looked over to his kitchen, food sounded good too.
Of course not, I normally smile at my crotch like an idiot
Tony gave him a look. “You can’t be so naive to believe that you killed them because of your wings, are you?”
The touch to his fingers when Tony grabbed the cookies were like an electric shock that rippled down his spine, and his wings ached. He wanted to preen and peacock because Tony...Tony was scintillating and exquisite. Steve’s breath caught in his throat.
“What?” Steve sharply asked, whirling around.
“We are playing cars that would crash into each other!” Thor boomed while his eyes were focused on the screen in front of them.

Tony said, “It’s okay that it’s not with—” but Deborah had already moved away from them, so Tony trailed off, “—Stevens.”
Tony, as he frequently did when around Steve, opened up his tablet and grabbed the stylus to scribble on schematics so as to not let his hands wander upon Steve’s person. It was too tempting otherwise, to see Steve’s dirty suit hug his form, and Tony bit his lip, gripping onto his tablet tightly until his knuckles turned white. The rest of the flight passed with Emily Nagogski’s soothing narration on the sound system and each man lost in thoughts about the other.
Now that Tony knew, the rest of the team will know, and Steve would be kicked off the team. No one wanted a member who was death incarnate.

He accepted his fifth replacement drink a short time later, followed by his sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ones. He kept hoping that the bourbon would wash away the vision of Steve’s hands on Carol’s body, or the memory of how the love of his life smiled at someone Tony could never hope to compete with, or largely just let him forget the night completely. Somewhere between drinks four and five, he’d managed to get the money Pepper had assigned to him and had let her know he was taking himself off the clock.

A hand stopped him. “I see you’re awake, Mister Stark,” a voice said. Tony blinked, looking up at the man who touched him.
Tiny Steve was completely silent and still, completely frozen in place as Steve walked closer. If it weren’t for the fact that Tiny Steve blinked every few seconds, Steve would have thought he was a doll.
He threw his phone at the wall in frustration as he replayed the conversation in his head. “Fuck. JARVIS?”
Tiny Steve seemed content to let whatever Steve wanted to do; his body was thrumming with excitement. And because he didn’t have anything better to do, Steve followed Tony into the elevator.
The man laughed. “No, it’s not. This here, this TARDIS, she’s going to blow your mind, and she’s not a prank at all.”
“I haven’t seen this in years,” Natasha said, breaking his trance. Steve looked over to see her standing beside him staring at the thing in his hand. Glancing at his confused look, she clarified, “It’s essentially obsolete because Tony had been providing us with new and high-tech stuff. It’s a communicator, a very old one. It’s been out of commission from the Army for decades.”
I am victorious having stolen my phone back from the traitorous himbo! What did I miss?
It was a mystery in his hands. He didn’t understand why he was thinking about the Red Skull now; he hadn’t thought about him in over a century, counting all the moments he had been awake and discounting the fact that he was closer to his past than ever before. But still, earlier, back at the cafe, he was hallucinating Deborah as the Red Skull, and he didn’t know why. They were two different people, and the Red Skull had long been dead.
And now Bucky was gone too.
“This man is leaving,” Tony replied quickly as he lightly pushed Rhodey towards the direction of the door. He didn’t need Rhodey to be here; he wanted to talk to talk to Stevens more, picked up where they left off when he had to take care of class and everything else that kept him busy for the past day.
The feathers rippled as Tony laughed. “I know what you meant, Steve, I was ribbing you. You can touch them.”
RIP Steve Rogers, died eating Tony Stark’s cake
Tony drew back and looked at the man in front of him, with those azure eyes, blue like the clear sky, shiny and free, and he gave Steve a watery smile. “You think I’m the special one? Look at you, the sweetest Captain America, handsome, strong, the man every woman wants, and you chose to be with me.”
Noooo come on! Not cool
Tony grabbed him and kissed him passionately, and all Steve could inhale is Tony.

“What are you laughing at?” Tony grumbles, pelting another acorn into Steve’s stupid laughing mouth when it is clear he isn’t going to stop any time soon. Steve’s golden fur ruffles as he shakes with laughter, and the acorn falls right out of his open mouth. Tony snatches the acorn back (they’re a precious commodity, okay?) and butts him against his chest. He is lucky he only gets off with two thrown acorns, although it has been a while since Tony used them as weapons.

“Look at me, Tony,” Steve said, and Tony blinked, moaning helplessly and looking down at Steve. His lips were red, stretched obscenely around Tony’s cock as he sucked his hard length down. His legs were shaking, barely holding himself up as Steve reached up, leaving trails of fire in his wake on Tony’s skin, holding him, possessing him.

”Writing is really hard. People don’t know that. It involves a lot of introspection, a lot of wrestling with your own demons.”
“I ripped the suit to get to you,” Steve said into his mouth.
Tony couldn’t protest with the way Rhodey forcibly directed him towards the table. Those piercing blue eyes looked amused when they approached, and Tony couldn’t stop the grin on his face. “Hello again, Stevens.”
Tony stared at the Doctor, willing him to say otherwise. Good thing he had the advantage here, standing in front of the TARDIS and blocking the only entrance the Doctor had to get into to his ship.
Tony tilted his head and admired the view. Steve hadn’t noticed he was there yet, allowing for just a few moments of uninterrupted voyeurism.
The next time his eyes went up to the clock on the wall, Stark was officially twenty minutes late.
Steve moved forward, brushing his hair out of his eyes. “Um, no, sir, Mr. Stark, sir. I’m here to speak to your son.”
So he gave himself as long as possible to savor the stretch… before he looked back to Steve and smirked.
49.2 percent of the population had a soulmark somewhere on their body. It usually appeared around the 16th birthday. Somewhere out in the world, someone else would have an identical mark and that meant they were your soulmate.
His first instinct was to say that Steve’s serum would never let him contract a common virus, but he didn’t know how much Barnes knew about Steve’s real identity, so he kept that fun fact to himself. “Are you taking him to a hospital? I could probably meet you there. Although, I’m not even sure that we’re officially dating, so it might be a bit premature for me to show up for hospital visits—”
“Come around here again, and it’ll be my lawyers meeting you at the gate.” Howard motioned for the driver to pull forward, as he rolled his window back up.
Tony could tell, his hand sliding along Steve’s face and feeling the warmth of his skin. “I think you have a fever. Listen, Steve… I have a friend that’s a scientist with biology experience. We can fix this with science. You don’t have to—”
Tony’s chest itched. He ignored the tingling in his palms as he shook Steve’s hand, and then immediately brought his hand up to scratch at the center of his chest. Apparently the fact that Steve Rogers,
Being stuck with Tony Stark for an indeterminate amount of time in an off the grid house site was going to lead to his insanity or demise… whichever came first. Being on the motorcycle with the hot line of Tony's body pressed against his back had been bad enough!
"Too busy punching him in the face. Just because my sins weren't on the front page, doesn't mean it didn't happen. News flash: I'm not a virgin, either."
“How does Captain
He was just about to broach the topic of ‘hey, are you my boyfriend’ and ‘as my boyfriend would you like to put your dick in my ass’... when Cap got called up on a mission. Despite stilted messages on the satellite powered texting device that Tony had designed for him, he didn’t hear much from Steve for the next two weeks.
“What bullshit,” Cap growled. He thought about all of the men that he had met down at the VA that could use a prosthetic designed by Stark. He could fill a sheet of paper twice over with names. “I volunteer at the VA in my spare time. Have a few friends down there that would really benefit from that kind of device. Most of what they can get with their benefits package aren’t worth shit.”
Right.
“They’re full and I have a meeting in thirty minutes.”
“I consent to you fucking me,” Steve whispered in his ear.
“Sir.”
Steve pointed to Tony’s naked chest. “I hadn’t… I was so out of my head that I didn’t even see it.”
Howard Stark probably liked to think he was the reason why Tony and Meredith broke up, but in all honesty… once he confronted her and found out about the faked soulmark, he couldn’t spend another minute with her.
It was about a week after the article ran, that a new report surfaced. Claims that Joanna wasn’t quite the woman she had been saying she was.
He was gone for a week, and miserable the entire time. He started to notice his mood was becoming a problem, when his team started avoiding him and ducking their heads if they had to speak to him. He got the delegation from Wakanda safely home, before catching his own jet back to New York. He couldn’t sleep — had barely slept at all the entire trip, so he spent the red-eye flight catching up on paperwork.
“But, sir—”
“Yoga?” Tony scrunched his face up. “We’re teaching yoga now? What’s next? Massages?”
"Captain, my name is Colonel Rhodes with the United States Air Force… I could use your help with a very delicate matter.”
It was surprisingly easy to find the spot where men had Tony holed up. After watching security footage and spotting the license plate info of their getaway vehicle, he followed that information to a rundown house in Jersey.
He was quickly losing his courage. If he went back home at that point… he would never find the strength to make it back. “I’m his soulmate, sir.” He reached up, grabbing a bit of his jacket and shirt so that he could pull it down and show off his matching mark.
They got settled in over the next couple of hours — with Stark begrudgingly picking out a few books, while Cap made them a meal of steaks and canned vegetables (the steaks he had thankfully thought to buy on his way up to the house, because they definitely wouldn’t survive on what had been there).
"Yeah, I guess I do."
Pepper’s cheeks painted in a blush. “Can I use your shower?”
hurt Steve being loaded onto a gurney. He stepped out of the way, taking only a minute to note the blood soaking a bandage around Steve’s head, as he allowed the medical personnel to take the Commander downstairs. “Romanov.”
Cap closed his notebook and gave Stark his attention. “Raising awareness of a problem becomes a benefit for an organization. What if my raising awareness was what sparked those reports of sexual abuse? I’m not arrogant enough to think that I’m the reason for any of that, I’m just saying that sometimes one word can be a catalyst for change. And I’ve noticed in this society that a lot of people are afraid to speak up.”
"Hello?”
When that finally happened, Tony was in the war room listening to the analyst data on their next operation. Bravo team was set to fly out in twenty-four hours to help protect a Wakandan representative in Europe for UN council meetings. It was low-ball stuff, playing the protection game, but Tony’s main efforts as director was to make sure they weren’t focused solely on hurting people. He even had a team of scientists stationed in Africa to help with water and food conservation efforts.
“Between that fact, and the years I’ve spent accompanying Rogers on missions, I am probably one of the very few people that knows the truth.” When Tony didn’t immediately reply, Romanov stepped forward and tapped a finger against his chest, right where the tattoo laid, beneath his high-dollar shirt. “I’m sure that having multiple people pretend to be your soulmate, only for you to find out the truth… was

They were at the cabin for thirty-six hours. Tony was going a little insane by the end of it (romance novels were

Stark looked from Ms. Potts, to Steve, pausing for a moment before looking back to his assistant. “This, again? Haven’t we told Fury to stop sending us weapons requests, yet?”
. But doing one small thing while all of the other larger problems still blossom isn’t very helpful, is it? Tony Stark… willing to make a female his acting CEO, but unable to realize that his entire board of directors is male and over the age of seventy. Don’t even get me started on his
“I knew I should have had that removed.”
It was impossible to grow up in New York and not know the Stark name. Howard Stark was constantly in the papers, and when he wasn’t… his son usually was, though in a completely different light.
“Ready medical!” A garbled voice sounded through the comms. Tony stood in base of operations and watched as the communications techs handled the incoming team. The mission was a difficult one — taking down a large terrorist organization that had rooted in Istanbul. He had sent their best agents, including his second-in-command.

How had he forgotten?
“It really is a shame that he’s gay. I feel like Mr. Stark is just using him to tempt us.”
at the sight that welcomed him. At some point in the ten minutes, Steve had rolled over, shoved a pillow under his hips, and started humping the poor thing. He looked like a horny teenager, naked ass bouncing in the wind.
Stark's nose scrunched up at the idea. “It's fucking Jersey. I'm not going to be spotted walking around fucking Jersey. So I decided to wait for the calvary.” Tony leaned to the side, to see around Cap. “I have to say I was hoping to be more than a one man job.”
Why was that so hard when Steve was trying to get under his clothes? “This isn't really consent.”
Steve turned his head and kissed Tony’s palm. “I want to.”
“Mmm, you could bounce a quarter off that ass.”
Barnes rolled his eyes. “He's still Steve. Just a hornier version. And from what I'm gathering… this is an act that needs a partner and completion to make him better.”
that protects the forgotten man behind it.”
Tony wiggled a bit where he stood, trying to keep his gaze on the floor, but finding himself looking up over and over to take in everything that was Steve Rogers naked. Finally, he scratched his hand at the back of his neck and met Steve’s lust-filled gaze. “So. Do you uh… preference?”
“You haven’t been?” Minion Two sounded appalled. “The new trainer teaching self-defense on level four… he’s an absolute dream. Honestly, Tara in HR thinks Mr. Stark built a robot. Because there is no way this guy is for real.”
“Do you seriously—”
Tony looked down and mumbled, “I thought it wasn’t real.”
scream like a girl or jump when startled.
Even still, it was a job and Bucky’s company could really use the recognition, so there was no way he would ever turn it down. Not to mention the fact that he had to give Stark credit for dealing with a controversial issue like the Stane mess, by initiating steps to protect women in the future. He was all for that kind of support.
Stark huffed. “Most of those guys were around when my father was still in charge of the company. And the process to replace them is written in the founding bylaws, so I can’t exactly fire them without just cause, like with Obadiah.”
The feeling of intense longing for a person or place you love but is now lost. A haunting desire for what is gone.
"Coffee. Then sexy times."
“This was going to happen anyway. At least I planned for it to.”
Another soft, “Oh,” was the only reply.
Unfortunately that was mostly delayed by the ensuing legal battle with Obadiah Stane, who had conspired to have Tony kidnapped and later killed. Unfortunately the guy picked terrible cronies who had all flipped on him as soon as they were caught.

He finally looked across the boardroom table to meet Pepper’s gaze. She was…
Steve laughed, and for a moment ducked his head and looked like he was far away and contemplating a joke only he knew.
They were already on the elevator, and Tony turned to look at her in shock. Did she just… “No?” Tony Stark was not used to being told no.
Tony Stark was seventeen, home for Christmas and spending his time with some NYU senior instead of his forlorn family, when the kid decided that he wanted photographic proof that he had fucked a Stark. The photo, a shot of Tony laid stretched out on the bed, blanket barely up to his hips, showed the soulmark on his chest perfectly.
He must have moaned or made some other minimal noise, because suddenly a sharp blue gaze was focused on him and Tony felt his own cock twitching.
Commander Rogers was an enigma wrapped inside a taco. Or, well, maybe a pastry of some sort. Because sometimes he was sweet sugary goodness, and sometimes he was the bitterness of a dark chocolate eclair.
The room went quiet and hands dropped back onto laps. Tony didn't have to look at the big screen to see the smirk play over Steve's face.
“Yeah.” Tony's voice got a bit wispy. “Yeah.” He nodded his head in the direction of his personal suite. “Let's take this to the bedroom, yeah?”
Saying goodbye to Joanna… well, it made him realize that soulmates were absolute bullshit and he would never let fate decide who he was
“I’m—”
Even if it made Tony's chest itch.
Before Bucky could keep ranting at him, Steve's pocket began to ring. It wasn't the normal sound that his phone made, though. Instead, it was a shrill sound that immediately put him on alert.
Natasha reached out, slamming her hand onto the ‘stop’ button and causing the elevator to jolt and stop moving. “Director Stark, I hope you are aware that when you took over for Fury I did my research on you. I wasn’t going to offer my services to someone that I couldn’t trust.”
"You're a little bit spoiled, Director Stark."

There was a sudden lucidity in his voice that hadn’t been there before. Tony raised a hand up and laid it on Steve’s cheek. “Yeah, pal? You okay in there?”
"Not everyone is terrible, Tony."
Ten minutes later he was back out of the bathroom and actually
Five years later, Joanna showed up. She was everything that Meredith wasn’t, and he had no problem falling for her. When he saw the mark on her chest, he traced the tattoo in silent awe and a bit of fear.
He had just walked out of the bathroom, brain focused on
Once the elevator doors had closed once more, and they were alone, Steve struggled to straighten up and stand on his own. “Tony?”
"Was it, though? Because I've been getting gradually more depressed since I met you."
And badass women reminded him of his best friend in the war… one of the baddest.
“All of that can be tabled for a later discussion. We need to address the issue with Steve.”
Cap couldn’t help but think.
For Tony, soon to be the trustee of a billion dollar corporation… it was a
). Shucking the wrapper, he finally climbed onto the bed, straddling Steve’s lap and bringing the condom to the tip of that gorgeous cock…
Tony was hungry.
“Well, as we discussed yesterday, there is some memory loss. Our team hopes that it’ll be temporary, once the swelling goes down, but we will have a plan in place in case it’s not. He exhibits most cognitive function, though, which is a good sign. Right now it’s mostly a waiting game.”
Steve shook his hand. “So I've heard. If it's alright, I'm going to start by showing the folks here a few moves to break out of holds. I'm going to face the audience, and I want you to come up behind me and wrap your arm around my neck in a chokehold. Got it?”
Rogers was out for forty-eight hours. The doctors warned Tony that the head trauma was pretty severe, and they wouldn’t know the full extent of damage until he woke up.
Stark looked up and immediately grinned. "Captain America! Are you here to rescue little old me?”
“You had a date offer from the richest dude in New York—”
After they had eaten, Stark went back to his book while Cap found a drawing tablet in his duffel bag and began sketching to pass the time. It was quiet for a lot longer than he expected, but eventually there was a huff from across the room and he suddenly knew that Stark had reached his limit.
Steve almost groaned aloud when he rolled the condom over his dick; he'd been so hard for so long that even feeling the latex stretching over his cock had him biting down on his lip so he didn't come straight away. He panted into Tony's neck, laved his tongue along the heated stretch of skin there, gripped the base of his cock hard as he rubbed the tip of it against Tony's ass.
, fast enough that Tony could hardly catch the tiniest huffs of air when he pulled out.
Tony's brow furrowed, but then he nodded, leaning over so he could rest his cheek on Steve's shoulder, so he could press a kiss right above the wrinkle of fabric on his neck he got when he pushed the cowl back. "Okay, honey," Tony murmured, threading his fingers through Steve's, sucking another hot kiss to Steve's skin. "Okay—"
"Yes, well, this has been sufficiently mortifying," Tony said cheerily, followed by the sharp clink of glass. "If you'll excuse me, I have an appointment to get to."
Tony shook his head, barely. "Chemo," he rasped out, his voice jagged like he'd been gargling glass, and Holy God, it sounded even worse than it had after Tony had— Steve flushed, and pushed that thought to the side. Now was
. "You damn self-sacrificing idiot," he murmured, albeit fondly as he dragged Tony's knuckles up for a kiss. "You need to take care of yourself better."
" under his breath, and tightened his fingers in Tony's hair again and he sucked him all the way down, the spasming of his throat working around the most sensitive part of him.
," Tony moaned and clenched down, and Steve keened, fingertips digging in hard enough to bruise, and he was shifting back and fucking in like everything Tony ever wanted.
His cock still hurt, but here, in the heat of Tony's body, his orgasm building up in his gut and his balls, it seemed almost bearable.
"Dealer's choice, my dear," Tony eventually sighed, and Steve was nodding, lifting Tony up into a sitting position and pulling the plug from the bottom of the tub.
"There we go, darling," Tony soothed as he kept massaging Steve's hot, tender insides. "That's perfect."
," he groaned weakly, clenched his ass even as he felt more of it slipping out of him. "Don't let it out-" he gasped, his face heating inexplicably as he fought to keep it all inside of him.
"I don't—" Tony choked out, tangled up in the hot, messy emotions of everything being so plainly laid out like this. He didn't— God, he didn't want Steve to think he was
"Hell, you've got the prettiest nipples," Steve whispered, flicking at one of the hard, pinched nubs; Tony whined and panted and shifted, the tip of his cock just brushing the cushion. Tony whimpered at the sensations, suddenly aware of his cock in a way he hadn't been since this whole thing had started and suddenly desperate to shove it out of his mind. He wanted‒ he wanted‒
"You acting like an asshole isn't going to make me leave any faster," Steve grunted, finally moving to stretch out on the tile. "I know that's what you're trying to do." Honestly, Steve was furious, despite knowing that was exactly Tony's intentions. He hated being made to feel like an idiot, bumbling his way through the future with no clues on how to act or who expected what and Tony
," Steve ground out. His jaw was clenched so so tight, and his eyebrows were knit so close together. "They can't— they can't do anything," he panted out. "That's- that's what the doctor said. That I have to ride it out. And, and, and it'll either make its way out of my system, or—"
They were on the bed before Tony knew it, naked and rutting, and Tony could barely hold himself still as Steve slid a finger in him, getting him nice and wet for the
Steve grunted, deepening the kiss, sliding his hands up Tony's sides so he could tangle them in Tony's hair. He smelled so good — spicy and a little floral, some complex combination of his shampoo and the cologne he'd put on this morning. Tony hummed, clenching his fingers in the fabric of Steve's shirt.
"What do you want?" Steve hummed, grabbing at Tony's leg with his free hand. He pulled it up, drawing Tony's knee to his chest almost, deepening the angle of his thrusts. Tony shouted, bucked back against it and sobbed into the sheets. His eyes ached, burned against the hot, shameful tears he felt welling up inside them. Tony rolled his hips back to meet Steve's, tried to clench his overworked asshole to make it feel good on Steve's cock. "What do you want, Tony?" Steve asked again, and sped up his hand, jacking Tony at an almost punishing pace.
To his right, Steve was lightly dozing, eyes flicking back to Tony every so often as Jenna and Terrance worked on waxing the thick golden hair from his calves and thighs. He breathed deeply through it, as if it were nothing more than tickle (though, knowing Steve, it probably did only tickle, the bastard).
Images of Steve jerking off assaulted Tony's traitorous, overeager mind. He'd probably treated it like he did everything else:like a mission, like a
"There you go baby, that's it," Steve grunted, fingers sliding over his face, petting his hair, tightening in the shorter curls at the base of his skull. His dick bumped against the harder ridges in the roof of Tony's mouth, the back of his throat - and Tony whined, high-pitched and breathy as the dildo rammed into him again just as Tony began to deepthroat Steve's cock. "Oh, hell, Tony, that's so perfect, just like- just like that-" Steve moaned, rocking faster and faster and Tony let his throat loosen even more, let the spit and drool drip from his lips, down his mouth and the base of Steve's cock, his heavy, tight sac. "That's it, baby, that's it - let go Tony, I gotcha," Steve growled, and it came out in that low, heavy Lower East Side timber Steve sometimes got when he was really feeling it. Tony preened, even as Tony felt himself start to float, his mouth making soft
"No," Steve replied, shaking his head. "No, this was good," he reiterated, brushing an errant curl out of Tony's eyes. "Thank you for giving this to me, Tony."
. He was suddenly aware of how hot he felt all over, how his cock kept bumping against the cushion and leaving wet, sticky trails and spatters of precome on the fabric. Steve sped up his thrusts and the dildo seemed to speed up with it. "You wanna come baby? Yeah, I bet you do, Shellhead - go on, go on baby, come whenever you want, and- ah-" Steve rocked his hips again and Tony swallowed and whined and felt himself slobber all over the both of them as Steve's thighs began to tremble, to stutter in their pace. Tony groaned, his gut clenching, and worked his tongue as much as he could, trying to drive Steve to that peak.
The sad part was he really
"What happened?" Steve grumbled; he could feel the frown on his face before he was even conscious of making it. Guilt, simmering like nausea in his belly, swam up into him. "Did I— d-did I—?"
"Tony," Steve groaned, and it sounded enough like a laugh that Tony couldn't resist giggling with him, his eyes a little hot and watery. Steve reached out then, and grabbed Tony's hand, like a handshake almost, like they were making a business deal. "I- I… I would like you to— to stay with me. I don't…" Steve took a shaky breath, shook his head as if to clear it. "I don't want to hurt anybody," he said roughly; his tongue darted out to wet his chapped lips, and Tony's eyes zeroed in on the movement. He needed to hydrate; Tony should've, he really should have brought Steve some water, or some Gatorade. Maybe a few ration bars, since he probably hadn't eaten since the plane ride earlier. "You're strong, Tony," Steve whispered then, looking up at Tony under those beautiful blond lashes. "You wouldn't let me hurt you."
"I should go get dressed, too," Tony continued in a whisper, goatee prickling against Steve's sensitized skin. "Meet you in the bedroom?"
Steve blinked, heat prickling behind his eyes, and shook his head, trying to keep the sudden rush of emotion at bay. He fell to the chair beside Tony and grabbed for his uninjured hand, rubbed his thumbs across Tony's scuffed and freshly scrubbed knuckles. "Hell, Tony, of course I'm gonna worry about you. You scared the hell out of me today," Steve said; and he really had - the way the armor had dented in with a ridiculous, sickening
He tasted so sweet, a little salty but mostly just
"Shh, shh, I gotcha," Tony soothed, mouthing along the edge of Steve's briefs, tongue darting out to trace across the crease. Steve hissed, his hips jerking, and brought one shaky hand up to pet along Tony's hair, the other hand fisted in the cover on the chair, a quiet litany of

"Put your hand on your dick, Steve," Tony rasped, teeth catching at an ass cheek. "Go ahead and tease yourself."
"Hey, don't worry about me," Tony said, looking up at Steve with a small, self-deprecating smile. "I'll be okay in no time, Winghead, yeah?"
with a laugh and a little wrinkle of his brow as he fingered Tony open to take his cock.
"I know we already have one," Steve started almost shyly, "but I took the liberty of ordering a new one for the occasion."
"Bullshit," Steve said. Tony started, and Steve pressed a soft, sweet kiss to his mouth, puke-breath and all. "I love you, you dipshit. I didn't just say it because I was drugged, or because you were

"Right back at you, Winghead," Tony whispered a moment later.
"D-do you want me to get a condom?" Tony asked, his eyes wide and dark up at Steve. "I mean, I'm— I'm clean, but I know you're immune to, well, to almost anything, we've learned," he murmured with a quirking half-grin, garnering a wry huff of a laugh from Steve, "and I mean some guys prefer less mess, so."
"Bad taste in your mouth, darling?" Tony teased, keeping the more salacious remarks to himself. An alert popped up in his HUD. "Your heart rate is spiking."
"Mm, I'm not sure if I'm up for much at the moment," Tony admitted, letting himself be gently picked up and propped against the sink. Steve wet his toothbrush for him and squeezed a dab of paste on the brush.
Tony whimpered, high-pitched in the back of his throat; he was instantly mortified, one arm flying up to cover his face.
"Yeah, alright," Steve huffed, a grin peeking out from his sour facade, and he knuckled lightly against the side of Tony's skull. "Okay, okay, you're up now, I get it."
"'Tony's' just fine, my dear," Tony cooed, sucking at the sharp, stinging bite. "No need to elevate me to godhood, honey."
Hesitantly, Tony placed a hand on Steve's arm and he melted, a long, drawn-out moan ripping from his throat, and Tony almost wrenched his hand away before recognizing that that hadn't been a bad sound, but a very, very
Tony suddenly felt wrong-footed about this whole thing. "Steve, we- we had a briefing, remember?" he said, setting his drink down on one of the benches and jogging forward. "Steve, your

"I use a special—" Tony started.
"I should‒" Steve growled softly, sucking what was going to be a fantastic bruise into the junction of his shoulder, "I should go get dressed."
it. So Tony's throat flexed and he gagged for half a second before he relaxed, letting the head and part of his shaft slip down past his mouth and into the back of his throat. Steve's hips twitched, and he fucked out, and then in, shallow and torturously slow.
"Y-you-you know h-how I'm always— willing to take one for the team," Tony said, trembling, his hips hitching and rolling against the sweet sweet pressure of Steve's hand against him.
and soft and comfortable) that he nearly forgot about the blood meter waiting outside the door for them. Someone (probably Jan or Thor, or maybe even not-Jarvis) had also left a thermos filled with that ridiculous calorie-shake that Steve drank sometimes, and another one filled with soup for Tony. "C'mon over here, handsome," Tony said sleepily, even as he was making his way back to the bed where Steve had his finger dutifully out for Tony to prick. "Shake first," he ordered, and sipped at his own warm soup while Steve chugged his calorie-laden beverage. "Okay." Tony clapped his hands together, inserted a test strip into the meter.
"You don't have to be here for this, darling," Tony murmured some indescribable time later. "I'm well aware of the picture I make."

He was about to push the button on the gate, when the large thing started moving…
The cowl had hidden a perfect blush on those perfect cheeks… which really was a shame. Steve scratched at the back of his neck and continued to avoid Tony’s gaze. It was wild, and a bit hard to believe, but already Tony could see the two different men that made up one soldier. Captain America was a hardass that didn’t let anything get to him. Steve Rogers was… well, just a kid from Brooklyn. Someone that didn’t realize his own worth and probably wasn’t used to getting complimented.
“Have you been yet?” Minion One asked.
The car that pulled in was nothing to write home about, but it wasn’t hard to notice Steve’s bulky form in the passenger seat. Barnes had to physically wrestle Steve out of the car, and when he had, Steve clung to him like a leech. The feed in the elevator switched on and Tony watched as Barnes swatted Steve away, despite the fact that Steve was trying to kiss up his neck.
Rogers, instead?”
“Oh. Uhh…”
soulmate!
As soon as he made it to the elevator, he asked JARVIS to take him straight up to the penthouse. He was not in the mood for dealing with anymore business drama, so he was bypassing the research and development level for his own personal lab.
“Aah, probably best not to do it over the phone.”
All of that meant… he was qualified, yes, but totally not expecting to get a call asking him to come to Stark Industries and teach everyone interested some practical self-defense techniques.
Served him right.
Then his parents died and Tony’s life was too focused on work, to allow for leisure.
It was probably bad form, but Tony hadn’t kept up on updates about his second’s condition, apart from learning that the man had been moved to a guest suite. “Is he worse? Why didn’t they tell me?”
What he wasn't expecting, when he snuck into the house in his dark blue stealth suit, was to find a perfectly fine Tony Stark sitting at a table surrounded by three mostly naked men.
“I suppose you could if you like.” At Stark’s raised eyebrow, Steve shrugged. “My particular expertise is in linguistics. We have a wide range of skill sets within the organization. Natasha Romanov, the head of weaponry, is a chemical engineering expert. Chemistry experts. Physics. Archaeology. We have it all.”
lucky to have this man back in our lives!
Tony spent about an hour sitting in the quiet of his office, before he finally worked up the nerve to make his way upstairs and knock on Steve’s door. The man that answered looked like a haggard shell of the person Tony was used to seeing. His hair was a mess, he had a shadow of a beard starting to grow, and he was wearing his SHIELD uniform… though it was a wrinkled mess, as if he had been sleeping in it.
From that point forward, Tony kept his relationships strictly tattoo-free. He even, at one point, contemplated getting his own tattoo removed, before ultimately deciding that it would be a waste of effort. If he didn’t believe in the notion, that was all that mattered.
“Makes sense.”
Steve had been moved to one of the larger apartments, so that the doctor’s could still keep an eye on him, without watching him minute-to-minute.
It was probably completely his fault that he wasn’t able to fully commit to a relationship. It was like a part of him was always missing, though, and he could never look beyond that.
It was early, sun barely cresting over the horizon, but Steve already had energy coursing through him.
That wasn't even factoring in the worst part…
“Over a hundred men and women will be out of a job without—”
So the fact that Steve Rogers — in all of his sexed-up glory — managed to coax
Most of the SHIELD personnel had their own apartments and homes throughout the city, but there were a few apartments and dorms available for people working long hours and too tired to make it home.
and suddenly start to feel better. (This was, of course, ignoring the fact that Tony Stark was a genius and most of the world knew it.)
The auditorium was packed with people. Weren't they supposed to be working? He felt like a grumbly boss for a moment as he stood in the back and watched. At the moment the stage was empty, while people got to their seats. Finally, once people were settled, a tall blonde man in a skin tight t-shirt and loose track pants got on the stage. Tony didn't have a
Then there was the research labs. The suddenly
“Budget cuts, more like.” Tony stood up and brushed his suit pants off. “Well, boys, it has been a real pleasure. I'm going to go wait outside while the good Captain does his thing.”
Too bad lunch would be put off until his team was safely landed back at the tower.
“Again…
And that, maybe, was the best part about nights spent with Tony. Sleepy Tony didn't think twice about what he was saying. Steve kissed his forehead.
Cap finished turning on the generator in the home and walked inside to see Stark standing there looking a bit disoriented. “There isn't internet! What the hell am I supposed to do without internet?”
They had Steve’s neck in a brace and were currently working to cut away his ripped and torn uniform.
As was Thai (although
In truth, anyone probably could have handled the whole mess. It maybe would have taken local PD a little bit longer, but they still would have gotten to the same conclusion. It was Cap’s understanding, though, that Colonel Rhodes had called him so that as few people as possible found out about Stark’s disappearance. If the media figured it out, the whole thing would turn into a mess. And if Stane was behind it all, he might get spooked and up the ante on the whole thing.
Dear World… we are
smirk.
Thankfully, move one had been easy. Kicking Obadiah Stane out of the premises. Because once there was cause for suspicion, suddenly there were security videos and witness statements. The asshole had been quietly living under the Stark Industry name for years… all while making it look like trash in the privacy of his office.
“I was not expecting a joyride with Captain America. You'll forgive me if I get a little turned on. That suit plus the bike is like all of my wettest wet dreams.”
And waited.
He took a deep breath. “I’m sure you’re aware of SHIELD’s founding history…”
Howlies watching over him; keeping him company when he felt like shit and remembered all that he had lost.

“Tony.”
The moral of the story was: no one seemed to recognize that the
Well, I mean, we
“No wonder you didn’t show up for lunch,” Tony said without thinking twice.
It was Bucky who found him a job. Or, well…
Soon could mean anything.
Stark stood with his arms crossed, staring at Cap's Harley. Walking up, he pulled the extra helmet off and handed it over. “Come on. We need to be a few clicks out before I can call this in.”
“Yeah. I’m about two minutes out. Do you have a back entrance or something? I don’t want a lot of people seeing him like this.”
“Shut up, Stark.”
Colonel Rhodes requested to meet Captain America at a nondescript office building in downtown Manhattan. Then, he proceeded to explain that Tony Stark had been kidnapped some time the night before while in route somewhere between Stark Tower and the Italian restaurant he had dinner in. Witnesses confirmed they saw him get back into his car, but the car had been found abandoned a few blocks from the restaurant.
It was maybe a bit disconcerting that Steve hadn’t said a word. Once the condom was on, Tony blinked and looked up. Steve’s breathing was tense and there was something in his eyes that said he was barely holding onto the smallest thread of self-control.
Ms. Potts held up her hands, before quietly ducking out of the room. Steve took a deep breath and tried to remain calm. “Sir, Director Fury announced his retirement last week, right before the president drastically cut our funding. I’m here on behalf of the entire organization to ask for your help.”
America know the term ‘sausage fest’?”
“Wait, our?”
couldn’t handle, then the world was ending and not even Tony Stark would be able to help.
“Good. Go to the safe house as directed. We've got multiple threats still in play. I'll call with updates.”
They hadn't spent many nights together yet, despite the five or so months since Tony acknowledged their soulmarks. Neither one of them had felt any need to rush their relationship, and instead were appreciating the small moments.
That gave him pause. He reached up almost immediately to rub at the spot on his chest, but knew that it couldn’t possibly be what Steve meant. “Yeah. I’m your boss.”
… And
If you’re going to be the number one voice in any industry, make sure you’re leaving an impression on the world.
“Isn't that fashion guy richer?”

It was a bit impulsive, but the next day when he had finished with school, he hopped on a train to Manhattan. Everyone knew where the Stark mansion was, so it really didn’t take much to figure out how to get there. He got off the subway a few blocks away and shouldered his backpack as he started the rest of the journey on foot.
“He’s fantastic, isn’t he?”
Captain America is gay?”
“Obadiah Stane, yeah. He’s a sleazeball that liked to use the Stark family for their money. Suspect zero in my book.”
, looked like he was designed in a lab to be every woman’s (and man’s) perfect wet dream… was just that: a fact. Because that body
“And you didn't leave… because?”
Actually, that wasn’t a bad idea. He could use a massage…
Steve held a hand out to him. “Perfect, sir.” Once Tony was back on his feet, Steve turned back to the crowd and began explaining the next move…
“So!” Tony clapped his hands together. “It’s lunch time. Plans? No? Good. Go ahead and shower and ask security to point you towards my private elevator. Food allergies?” Steve opened his mouth to answer, but Tony shook his head. “Good. I’ll order something.”
“Special to me, right?”
“Ow! What the fuck.” Suddenly Tony was flat on his back staring up at that same
at the poor guy on the other end of the line, before realizing it was an honest call and not some prank that Bucky was playing on him.
When it was announced last year that a body had been found frozen in the Arctic, a collective gasp went out over the United States. Could it be? Really? The hero of our history books was finally found?
Tony, eyes still closed and voice still half asleep, smiled just slightly. "That's okay, you still love me."
He pointed slowly at the wall of bookshelves, filled to the brim with books. “Read?”
“Tony—”
. Now SHIELD is an organization of combatant scientists. Men and women who have fought overseas and also received a PhD or two.”
"Fucking Howard. Ask me if I'm surprised, Steve." He shook his head. "Listen… I don't know how to do this. I've hated this damn tattoo since the last time someone faked it and was going to marry me based on a lie."

out of a car window, so much as look sternly and expect everyone else to bend to him.
He actually
He also never recognized that when he wasn’t around Steve, suddenly he was a little moodier and had a harder time sleeping. A fact that became quickly apparent when the Bravo team in Vienna called for his assistance.
“Ladies and gentlemen, it seems we have finally caught the attention of your esteemed leader. Mr. Stark, welcome. Come on up.” As Tony walked up onto the stage, Steve asked the crowd, “You guys think I'll get fired for this?”
He was seventeen when the news got out about Tony Stark’s soulmark. He could clearly rememberremember clearly the moment, sitting in the bedroom provided by his newest foster family and watching the news report.
“What’s the status, doc?”
Steve rolled his eyes. That definitely wasn't the type of relationship he was looking for. He had woken up in a time where it was legal for same sex couples to have a relationship without having to hide —  he wasn't going to waste that opportunity.
bullshit. Now he was stuck with a tattoo.
“Romanov,” he turned to his left, where the woman sat with one eyebrow arched. “I want you to be the interim second, until we know Rogers’ status. Run point on this, while keeping the communications with Charlie and Delta teams open, clear?” She nodded, a woman of very few words, like always. “Good.” He turned back to the table at large, “the rest of you, maintain twelve hour check-ins while overseas. We don’t want to be surprised by fallout from Alpha team’s last mission.”
Tony scratched over the old tattoo. “Would you believe it’s because you’re my soulmate?” When that was answered with a bemused snort, he shook his head. “My dad had a love/hate thing for you. Went up and down depending on his mood. But most days he idolized you as a ‘man’s man’... so when I came out as not completely heterosexual… well, he got pissed. So I celebrated with a tattoo.”
“Okay.”
... he could tell people to shut up! “Here is how this is going to work: we are going to offer the women the highest severance pay they can think of, as well as a glowing recommendation to their next employer. We are also going to publicly apologize for allowing all of this bullshit to happen under our noses.
Barnes rolled his eyes. “He got hit with something on our last mission.”
And I’m positive that Steve would have continued on without ever saying a word — he’s got a martyr complex, after all — but his health is at risk and you need to stop being an idiot.”
“It was a pet project that my father started in the sixties with my aunt Peggy. A way of controlling intel and weapons research, while also going over data received from overseas during the Cold War.” Stark leaned forward, like he was telling a secret, “They were a bunch of spies pretending to be scientists.”
Steve loved pho, so the next outing (dinner, officially) was Tony’s favorite Indian place.
Two months before the wedding, Joanna and Tony’s PR people set up everything for an article to be run in a New York wedding magazine. Tony hated magazines, as a general rule, but was in that stage of love where he had a hard time denying Jo anything.
“Oh.”
“Tell me about it. I just spent a week babysitting an African king, because he didn’t trust my team. I want to—”
Cap nodded. Based on his interactions with Tony, and what he had read about the man, that made sense. He continued flipping through the file that Rhodes had provided him with, before stopping at the list of possible suspects. “Isn’t this the man that was just fired from the board?”
That wasn’t the part that Steve cared about. Instead, he was staring at the blurry image of Tony’s soulmark, as his hand reached up to brush over his chest.
There was a momentary silence, before Stark started to chuckle. When Cap frowned at him, he shook his head and waved it off. “I’m sorry, it’s just… now that I think about it? The idea of you cursing is absolutely hilarious. My dad… some days he hated your guts, and some days he worshipped the ground you walked on. But if he found out you —
a voice inside Tony whispered in awe.
Four? A bunch of conference rooms and lecture halls? Maybe Pepper had them doing extra training after the Obadiah disaster. At least she wasn't making him sit through it.
While the room was momentarily quiet, he realized how frustrating it was going to be, if he had to stay there for a long period of time in his Captain America get-up. The cowl was already starting to itch and cause a distraction.
Tony’s attention was suddenly completely focused on the phone call. “What happened?”
“Some. Names. How to tie my shoes. I can’t tell you where I grew up or how long I’ve worked for SHIELD. Dates are harder.” Steve turned away. “I’m fine though, thanks for checking, Director.”
“Huh.” Stark slowly opened the folder in front of him. “So you want my money. What else?”
Steve sat on the edge of the bed, and quickly moved around until he was comfortable. “I think…
as he pulled his robe on, when there was a sharp laugh from the bed.
Steve shuddered, but managed the slightest nod of his head. With that understood, Tony kept one hand on Steve’s left hip (keeping him still) and used the other to guide Steve’s cock carefully inside of his well-prepped ass.
Tony Stark did
“Fair point. So.” Tony scratched idly at his chest, before realizing what he was doing and moving his hand up to scratch at his beard instead. “I can’t help but notice that I’m now one of the few people who knows both identities. Which seems like a perfect time to ask
It took a beat, but when Steve finally turned around to face him, Tony reached up to grab the neck of his shirt and pull it down. The tattoo was there, as it always had been. The thing Tony had always hated most about himself.
He was probably doing his own version of sleeping (whatever version was possible, while upright in an uncomfortable chair), when he heard a confused voice ask, “Who are you?”
, some part of him whispered.
view from the back of the large room… until the cameras clicked on and suddenly the guy was up close and personal on the big screens bracketing the stage.
Hands went up all over the room. Tony ignored them, beginning to walk down the middle aisle of the auditorium. He raised his voice and called out, “I'll do it.”
Tony let out a faux gasp. “You cad! Next thing I know, you’ll be telling me that you drive that fancy motorcycle without a license.”
Steve was cut off by the door pushing open and none-other-than Tony Stark himself storming in like a hurricane. “Right. Pepper? Where we at? Is this the charity wanting me to sell my soul? Or Hammer wanting another partnership?”
“I considered it,” Tony answered. “After about the fifth time being slammed onto that mat. I’m not as young and spry as some people.”
“Keyword being
Stark gaped at him like a dying fish for a few minutes, before huffing and walking over to the kitchen to search through its contents.
“Okay,” Steve nodded. “Let’s do that then. We’ll do something reminiscent of dating, how does that sound? Even if it is something we keep to ourselves, so that SHIELD and the public don’t find out right away. Time spent together, even doing stuff like dinner and a movie, should help with the moods.”
He skimmed around the bed, feeling Steve’s intense gaze following his every movement, until he got to the bedside table and opened the drawer. He plucked one condom from the box, but on second thought grabbed another two and left them on top of the table (
“Nonsense, that.” Howard waved him off before the mark was even visible. “
“Are you lost, boy?” Howard Stark wasn’t the type to
So aside from the purchase of Clarabel, any other big chunks of that backpay being spent on fun things?
“My name is Bucky. I’m a friend of Steve’s. And since I’m technically his damn boss and he said he was going to work today, I got a bit worried when he didn’t show up. So I went to check on him.”
Two former employees of the global conglomerate Stark Industries stepped forward today with reports of sexual abuse happening within the company. The women, both filing the claim anonymously through law firm Nelson and Murdock, claim to have been sexually assaulted on numerous occasions by SI board member Obadiah Stane. Stane, a long time family friend of the Stark family, has been with the company since it's formation in the sixties.
"So ignore it. We can go back to how things were. It was working just fine."
Steve started kissing up Tony's neck with a moan. “Mmm, Tony, you smell amazing.”
He finally sat, but didn’t allow himself to relax. Instead, he pulled out the portfolio that had been put together by the SHIELD accounting team, and slid it across the table. “This is where we stand, financially, without the government backing.”
