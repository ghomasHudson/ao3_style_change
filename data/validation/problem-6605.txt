Clint’s dead wrong about manpower, but neither Steve nor Bucky are willing to correct him, because it’s just information that can be used against them in the end. Steve’s about to say something rude, but Bucky cuts across him, glaring down the end of his nose, at Clint.
“You’re not… hallucinating. You’re… it’s hard to explain this place.” Tony looks around them, at the Steve and Tony originals (does that make
The heavy, awkward feeling from earlier in the kitchen is back, and Steve feels a fluttering in his stomach again, but this time, instead of terror, it feels a lot more like excitement. He moves to open his mouth, to find something to say, some excuse to make, or half-assed apology for not ‘fessing up sooner, but nothing that comes to mind sounds right. He makes a snap decision, and leans into Tony’s space, brushing the lightest of kisses against his lips.
He drags his free hand through the lukewarm water—anything hotter is uncomfortable and stuffy, even two days out from heat—as he tries to figure out how to put his thoughts into words.
He reaches out for the doorknob, and starts to turn it, but something pauses him, and he turns back to Bucky. “hey, Bucky… about my parents—” a tortured look falls over the alphas face, and for just a moment, there’s something impossibly heavy in the air between them. It’s gone, almost as soon as it happened though, and Bucky shakes his head, sticking his fingers in his ears, as he walks away, like the clown he is. “later, Stark.”
Tony smiles, and shakes his head, an evil grin splitting his face. “absolutely not a chance in hell.”
Tony’s sure as hell not expecting Steve to say that, and he tries to shove down any butterflies that are currently forming in his stomach. Breakfast doesn’t necessarily mean anything – he’s had one night stands before who offered him breakfast, and they remained as that: one night stands. And he knows that the longer he postpones the inevitable, the more painful it’s going to be to say goodbye, and maybe he’s beginning to regret not taking a chance with the redhead who tried flirting with him earlier on last night. This sure as hell wouldn’t be happening with him.
Steve sniffs quietly, turning to look at the intruder on his moment, as soon as he’s aware of the sound of another human being moving. The guy got much closer than he typically would have, but Steve’s… he hates to say grieving, because Tony will come back, he’s confident that he will, but… he just looks so damn
. Tony feels something in his stomach churn, at the feeling of embarrassment, hot and prickling along his cheeks, and the back of his neck. Cap’s probably seen him in more compromising positions, but this… this hurts.
Bucky growls at the time comment, and Steve grits his teeth. “Kinda hard to move in on a guy, when you’re trying to do it, without getting all of his product captured and incinerated. Thanks for that, asshole.” Bucky’s hold on the grip tightens, with poorly concealed rage. That was the third time he had to detox on Sam’s couch, the lack of product meant cold turkey, and yeah, maybe he was still a little sensitive about it. Steve scoffs and cuts his eyes toward where Tony’s pressed up against the wall.
“Cap. Hey, buddy, ‘m sorry, dunno what happened. What happened with the battle?” Steve walks past him, like he never even heard, and Tony’s in the process of pouting and telling his co-leader exactly how heinous of a crime that is, when he turns slightly to the side, and gets a good look at the bed. More importantly, the bed, with
“oh god.” He mutters softly.  Ed stands awkwardly for a few more seconds, and then he takes an aborted half step toward the door.
"Need your cock, alpha," Tony says, words wrecked and tinged with desperation. Tony's least favourite part of heats has always been how out of control he is, how he's never in his right mind long enough into think anything coherent through. He's too vulnerable. He knows Steve would never let anything happen to him but it's still...it's still a worry. "Please. I don't -- I can't -- I need your knot."
This same pattern repeats itself several times over the next few days, much to Steve’s chagrin. Every single nights starts, and ends the same as the one before it, like he’s stuck on a rollercoaster of emotions, no way to change the outcome, and no way out but through. By the fourth night, he’s frustrated enough with himself, that he has to make a concerted effort to loosen his grip, when he hears the burner phone groan menacingly. He wishes he could say that the message that he types out is heartfelt, and concise, and eloquent, but it’s… it’s anything but. It’s simplistic, and wek, and it’s frankly the shortest thing that he could type, using the fifteen seconds of bravery he had, before it evaporated away again.
“Shh, it’s ok. It’s gonna be ok. You’re ok.” He’s sure he’s lying to her, but it’s the best thing that he can do at this point in time. he might not be able to stop anything bad from happening to her, but he can for damn sure, make sure that she’s not alone.
between them, that seems to defy all of the logical rules of every one night stand that's ever existed, demands savoring-- but never offended. “I've got some work to look over, if you want a nap?” He suggests lightly.
“Howard Stark created the Vita-Ray, Tony.” He knows he sounds angry, and he hates that, but he’ll be damned if Howards memory is misrepresented. Tony takes a step forward, and sticks his hand out, like he’s waiting for a handshake.
and what fun is the motorcycle when you can't feel any of your body parts?) and smiles. “Steve.” He leans in close again, presses a few kisses to Tony's neck and takes a moment to growl into his ear. “So Tony, your place or mine?”
“Screw you, buddy, I’m fuckin’ manly as hell.” He pouts slightly, sticking his lower lip out like a kid. He looks over the apartment for a few seconds, and sighs, before shaking his head. The bedding needs to be stripped and washed, there's the remains of a lamp on the floor that needs dealt with—round three had been… violent— and there's an overwhelming air of emotion in the atmosphere that feels like it's strangling the life out of him.
“Watch your fucking mouth.” he casts another suspicious look around them, and then jerks his head to the alley behind them, but Clint’s heard all he needs to hear.
There’s a nice, if confused looking paramedic, looking at him, like she’s waiting for the answer to a question.
Tony’s got half a mind to throw the phone across the room, see if he could break it to avoid furthering the breaking of his heart. He hates all of this, and he’s always responded to anything he hates with destruction. There aren’t any mirrors in the apartment anymore for that exact reason. None in the workshop, either, and he’s ensured that the walls are permanently blacked out. What he hates most of all is that he knows Steve’s lying. He’s trying to save face. He’s realised that the Rogues can’t stay on the run forever and is trying to make amends, or he’s trying to get back into Tony’s good books so he’ll speak to the UN on their behalf, or he’s just lying for the sake of it. Maybe he got bored and decided he wanted to screw around with Tony’s emotions.
He knows his mind’s manifestation of Steve is there, before he even turns around. His mind is nothing, if not predictable, and downright cliché. He turns slowly, and dream Steve is staring at him, that easy understanding smile locked on his perfect lips. “I’ll take you, Tony.”
Tony’s in a bed, in front of him. A hospital bed, by the looks of it, and he’s curled around a telltale bump. Steve takes a step closer, not sure what the fuck he’s meant to do, and dream Tony whines softly.
“Tony… you were out for almost two whole days, while they poked and prodded around your body, trying to figure out what happened? How… how did they figure it out so quickly in the end?” Tony squirms slightly, like he always does, when he’s uncomfortable about anything. The cut of a new shirt, tension in the tower, a battle plan that Fury wants enacted, that’s almost surely guaranteed to fail. His eyes are trained into an area of the room, the far corner, but Steve gets the distinct feeling that he’s not exactly
Long since used to his type of verbal abuse, Peter does little more than roll his eyes. “she’s not a thousand years old. Just because she’s in a nursing home doesn’t mean she’s geriatric, you Neanderthal.”
“is that so?” he settles on finally, unwilling to offer up more than that. Tony nods, like he’d been expecting an answer like that, which is more confusing than anything else is. Well. At least, until he opens his mouth again.
Tony Armstrong, is loud, brash, and interestingly enough, prone to accidents. Steve’s only been assigned to him for four days, twelve hours, and twenty three seconds, and he’s already almost killed himself a grand total of nineteen times. Most of that was resultant of the things he did in his own workshop though, and Steve’s not… exactly where his jurisdiction is there. He’s supposed to keep Tony safe from other people, so all bets should realistically be off in regards to what he does to himself, but that seems unfairly literal. Especially, considering the fact that the things he’s working on are purely for the good of other people.
“Rhodes. This isn’t what is looks—”  The beta growls lowly, and a muscle in his jaw jumps and twitches.
Tony doesn’t miss the nickname, not by a long-shot. He could have been drunk off his ass and he still would have snapped to attention at that, because while kissing and reverent, concerned looks and more attention than necessary are one thing, nicknames are another entirely. He’s known Clint for seven years, and not
He sighs, and sits up further on the couch. The prosthetics that Tony designed are fantastic, using nanites to attach into his synaptic knobs, allowing his legs to work more like they naturally would, instead of the machinery doing it all for him, but it’s still difficult to move. There’s a definite lag between commanding his body to move, and it actually obeying. When he spends something like a full 45 seconds moving around to get comfortable, and Tony doesn’t so much as look up from the rug, he scoffs, and grabs one of the gauche throw pillows that Pepper had to have bought, launching it across the room, and smirking as it bounces harmlessly off of his best friends head.
"You're okay," he says, voice barely above a whisper. "You're okay, Steve, I've got you. 'm gonna move now, okay?" And he lifts himself off Steve's cock slowly, for both of their sakes, so he doesn't hurt himself or push Steve to the uncomfortable side of over-stimulated. The second he's off, he lies down on the bed next to him, leaning back in to kiss him again. "You're okay," he repeats, even quieter this time. "We're okay."
“Disable the protocol, FRIDAY. Just… Just strip it all, ok?” he huffs out a semi-hysterical laugh. “that was a long time ago.”
Agent 13 tosses down a dossier, kept together neatly with a length of twine, though the manila folder that screams ‘military issue’ is still bursting at the seams. Whoever this is for, clearly has a record and a half.
Tony steps closer, and narrows his warm eyes at Steve. “Okay, you might be on duty, but I’m your boss, and if I say that you should have a cookie, you’re like. Contractually obligated.”
Tony was constantly turning up with injuries that looked like they might be consistent with that kind of treatment, and for a time, a period of hours really, Steve had wondered if it wasn’t possible for Tony to be the one in the suit, if he had abilities that he wasn’t letting on about. It was a good theory, and there seemed to be evidence that pointed either way, but then Steve turned up for work, another day of watching the businessman work books for Stark industries, and a petty criminal had decided he liked his chances of taking over the world, starting with Manhattan, and Iron Man had flown off to save the day, alongside a handful of other heroes, and Tony sat leafing through last quarters sales as pleased as punch, and Steve thought to himself maybe sometimes a duck was a duck, and a guy in an expensive Armani suit was just a guy in an expensive Armani suit.
Tony for his part, looks concerned, for all of a second, a single brief, momentary second, before he’s shaking his head.
Bucky thinks about the question for several long moments, and that really should be answer enough. He can remember maybe two or three times in the past couple years, their wedding night, cliché as it is. though he's certain that there were a few more times in the earlier stages of their relationship, when they were trying to figure out what they meant to each other, how to act now compared to when they were just best friends.
[I don't...  You don't owe me anything, Tony.  Believe me I know that.  but for what it's worth... I'm worried about you.  Are you alright?]
“My apologies Captain. They just said partner, and you're listed as his next of kin. Admitting must have just assumed… I'll get it fixed no problem.”  Steve waves a hand dismissively and for reasons he can't explain it feels damn good to do so.
"Journalist friend of ours told me about it a few months back," Tony says with a slight shrug, doesn't mention Karen by name because she's not involved in this and doesn't need to be. She doesn't know more about the mobs than what her job allows her to uncover. As far as she's concerned, Tony's a technician who works from home. "Night I met you wasn't the first time I'd been in there. I knew it was in Red Star territory, but I'm a behind-the-scenes guy - nobody knows I'm with the Hunt. I didn't... I swear I didn't know who you were, Steve. Only recognized Bucky because I had to sort through some of Jess' old files that caught him on camera. 'm not...I don't ever wanna hurt you, okay?" Bucky disarms his own gun, and steps toward the table, laying the weapon down, beside Steve’s.
romantic, darling.” He pulls back, and bats his eyelashes sarcastically. The laugh that follows is light and carefree in a way it hasn't been, in a while. One of his hands settles on Tony's cheek, and he smiles slowly. “'s ok to sleep if you want. I won't be
That's... A surprisingly sweet offer. It's nice, not something Bucky gets typically, but he doesn't know what to do with it right now so he makes a vague hand motion that's meant to denote 'thanks, we'll talk about it later.' Steve sighs and it's a heavy, tired thing. “I know, Buck, I know you did, I'm sorry. New kid…” he sighs again, and bites his lip, trying to find the best way explain this.” new kid, wade. Ran across him movin’ product on my side of town, busted him, told him to scram. He uses, so he had the needles on him. I took it when I confiscated the rest of his stuff.” he trails off for a second, and his eyes flick over to Tony nervously. His grip on Bucky's hands tightens almost imperceptibly. “I didn't think about it until… there was a one night stand… That redhead I went home with the first time? Two and a half weeks ago? I… He uses, it… Kinda started from there.” he sighs and addresses the floor specifically for fear of looking at Tony. “which is what I needed to tell you. There have been… Others.”
“just goes to show you, jerk, I’m not trying to prove anything, and ‘m not overheating.” Bucky looks up at him lazily, from where he’s leaning up against the wall, staring out at the beautiful sunrise.
After his night with Steve, Tony had retreated to the main base of operations in The Hunt's safezone. He knew that if he skipped a meeting and went straight back to Logan, back home, he'd get an earful from Pepper and probably protective custody from Clint - because that was a thing. They thought one of their own was threatened, they were detained in the safehouse until the storm had passed, even if there wasn't a storm and it was only a one night stand. Well, a one night stand that was meant to turn into something more, if Steve's request for another chance meant anything. Tony wants to assume they did.
“You’re fulla bullshit, Stevie. Send Tony my best.” Steve rolls his eyes, but he needs to leave quickly, to prevent the blush on his cheeks from blowing his cover.
“Don’t—” he cuts himself off, as he realizes that his word comes out laced with more growl than actual voice, dripping in alpha influence. He clears his throat, and closes his eyes for a moment or two, to focus, because if he doesn’t get it under control, he’s going to end up Voicing accidentally, and that hasn’t happened since puberty.
. I mean… I hadn’t decided.” There’s a single beat of silence there, and it tells Rhodey all he needs to know. Tony needs to talk. “forget it, you’re right, I don’t know what I was thinking. Hey, are you hungry?” typical Tony then, open up a tiny crack, and if what you see through it is anything but light, slam it shut just as quickly as you possibly can, deflect for good measure, throw out a red herring, hope someone bites. Rhodey hates Howard for teaching Tony this mental chess.
Tony takes her with the most tender grasp he can, almost afraid to hurt her. She squirms gently, and blinks open startlingly ice blue eyes, and tony could swear he feels his heart burst with affection. “Hi, baby.” He laughs softly. “hi.” He spends a truly inordinate amount of time looking down at their twins, and when he looks up at Steve, he realizes they’re both crying. He reaches out gently, to touch Steve’s face, and for the first time, in months, he’s not worried about the fallout from the Civil War. He’s not worried about Ross, or  the Accords, or any other thank that so short a time ago, seemed so important. He smiles softly, at Steve, and huffs out a quiet laugh.
Technically speaking, he can’t. all Avengers business is S.H.I.E.L.D. business, until officially declassified by the proper brass. And since S.H.I.E.L.D. is every bit as expansive as the U.S. military, declassifying missions is every bit as much a priority. Which is to say, it isn’t. but he looks over to Tony, limp and helpless in the bed, and he knows he’ll gladly face down a court martial, if it means that there’s the slightest chance that Tony’ll wake up. He still has the good sense to affect a hesitancy he doesn’t feel.
Bucky stares blankly at Steve when he finally comes back to Wakanda, relatively well groomed, and smelling of… absolutely nothing, out of the ordinary. There’s scent on him sure, his natural spiced scent, something more mellow and smooth, that has to be Suri, and even the vaguely floral scent that Bucky’s come to associate with T’challa himself, but there’s absolutely nothing different. Which is more suspicious than anything, if you ask Bucky, not that anyone did. Steve tells him he’s decided to go through with (the monumentally stupid idea of) going back to America, and Bucky just raises an eyebrow.
Knowing that he would be in trouble with Cap later didn’t change anything as he hummed, flying up the steep steps to stop in front of the sealed door of the temple at the very top. It had eight notches, and reminded him of a poker table… maybe they could play later… no, focus!
Jarvis didn’t say anything, but moved to lean against his arm. Helen, too, cuddled up against him, hugging his waist.
It was comforting, in a way, as horrible as it may seem; even through everything, his little, special Tsum was there for him, sharing a piece of his Soulmate even though he never got to meet them.
It was a joke, now, between them; he knew Peggy's Tsum wore a formal dress outfit the female officers wore, knew whoever Peggy’s Soulmate was, they would rock the world together. But even so, it was nice to have something to smile about, at the end.
But the important part was that they were safe. He had the will already updated - Pepper was CEO and had full control of Stark Industries, and Rhodey got a specialized suit just for him, along with many of his assets including JARVIS and the ‘bots - and they would be fine without him; no need to mourn someone who shouldn’t be alive, anyways.
During their shawarma feast, after he offered rooms in the Tower to nap in once Loki was dealt with, he casually mentioned they had permanent residency in the Tower if they wanted.
After everything was said and done (Fury and Howard and Natalie/Natasha stabbing him in the neck even if it was to save his life) he and Pepper just… drifted. Tony was never going to give up being Iron Man (he was Iron Man) and Pepper didn’t need the stress on top of being CEO.
“So, you are him.” His voice is quiet, but Steve can’t figure out if its disappointment, awe, or something else entirely. He clears his throat thickly, and nods, looking down at the floor between them, which has cruelly still failed to open up and swallow him.
It isn’t new. But the feeling of ice clawing its way down his spine, encasing him, and carving through his lungs, is. He stops walking, on a gasp, and closes his eyes for a second too long, and suddenly, all he can smell is snow. A winter that’s too harsh, and the metallic tang of metal that’s been left to rust. It’s too close to the scent of blood for comfort, and his stomach churns as he realizes he can smell that too. Blood, and rust, winter, and the faint ozone of an electrical short. He’s just starting to spin out of control, leaning up against the wall of the palace, when someone brushes past him, gently enough to be accidental, but just hard enough to jolt him out of his own mind. He sighs, frustrated at himself, and fixes his eyes down at the red dirt, as though he could stare it into submission with the sheer force of his displeasure.
“If… you want to spend some time with him… I have some patients I need to check up on in pediatrics, and I won’t be back for at least a couple of hours. ” she speaks to the chart, instead of to Steve, but he doesn’t care, because she said /yes/. He’s nearly overwhelmed with the desire to sweep her up into a crushing hug, but he refrains, because that’s probably crossing every line that exists in social contract, and it doesn’t matter, because she’s speaking again in the next instant. “His blood sugar is down, electrolytes are down, liver function…” Steve feels like his head is spinning, and he wants to throw up. All of that… that all sounds bad. This is turning out to be worse than even he could have expected it to be.
he moves to look through the warehouse window, peeks down to make sure that Gordon is behaving. He isn’t screaming, thank fuck, but he’s slumped over against his bonds, which means that Steve’s going to have to go all the way down to the kitchen, and pull adrenaline and a hypo out of the fridge to wake him back up. Great.
Steve hums softly, the only sign that he’s willing to give, that he heard Tony. he’s quickly descending even further into rut, and he’s not afraid or ashamed to admit that he’s losing his higher brain function, and really, words aren’t the important thing now anyway.
There’s a knock at the door, and an exhausted Famike comes in, smiling tightly up at Steve “Mister Rogers.” She’s professional enough to ignore the snort of amusement from Ed. “ah, we have some blood work back, but it doesn’t look like there should be any major problems, anything keeping him under. The presiding wants to see if he can get something of a medical history, would you be willing to talk to some of our staff about the enemy you were fighting?”
“Hold on tight, doll.” He shifts the car into drive, and pulls away from the curb. There's this myth that—well, it's not exactly a myth. There's this
“I gotta get outta here, Barnes.” The apartment can be dealt with. They have a small battalion of very discreet, very expensive cleaners for that. For now, He smiles softly, the way he only ever does for Bucky and shoves his hands in his pockets. “Lemme get dressed, take me home?”
"I like the beard," he says quietly, and he resists the urge to point out the fact that Steve looks like he's trying to copy Thor. He puts his hands in the pockets of his jeans, unsure of what to do with them. Obie always told him that his hands were his biggest tell, that he'd fiddle too much when he was nervous or intimidated, and hiding them in pockets is a habit that Tony's still keeping up years after Obie's death.
Tony’s words only serve to stoke the fire that’s already burning in the pit of Steve’s stomach, and as much as he wants to make this last as long as he can, as much as he wants to draw it out, and make Tony squirm and suffer, reduce him to a crying, begging mess, he just… can’t. he pulls back with a soft growl, and licks his lips in a way that is absolutely vulgar.
“So they take it back.” Tony’s still thinking up something to say in response, when there’s a quiet voice down the hall, that rings with the warmth of the sun, and sounds like it would float on the breeze, like the scent of honeysuckle on a warm summer morning.
to. He wants Tony. he wants all of this to be over, and if that means meeting up this close to their cycles synching up, then fuck it, that’s what’s going to happen. He clears his throat softly, and shifts uncomfortably on the bed, fully aware that he’s about to make a questionable decision at best.
“I’m not shitting you. It’s getting serious. You know he got works through Davis, if the shit he’s pushing is bad--” shady kid nubmer two interrupts the first, eyes wild and searching the area around them.
Tony doesn’t look convinced, not in the slightest, but he isn’t immediately arguing, and really, Clint guesses that’s all that he can hope for. So he smiles softly, tries to put every ounce of comfort into it, that he can. Even when the amount he actually feels for himself is… abysmally small.
Steve is universally fucking terrible at having faith in anything, but he nods, and steps out of Tony's way because it's the right response. Or, it's the rightest response, as far as this situation goes. The brunette makes his way out if the loft and down the stairs, and Steve tries his hardest not to think how he's probably making his way out of his God damned life. He turns to Bucky, slowly, and sighs.
“Tony. You really shouldn’ be up. Do you ever follow the rules?” he blinks several times, and whips back around suddenly, making the most bewildered face he’s personally capable of, when his eyes lock on…
“for being a completely different person, you’re a lot more like him that you’d think.” He says, indifferently, looking back over to the bed, where Tony still lies, puffs of air fogging the oxygen mask that’s covering his mouth and nose.
have some survival instinct - but it had pulled off to a side street after the fifth block, and Tony hasn't seen it again since. False alarm. He's definitely paranoid about meeting Steve, even if it's officially dark out, and cold enough to deter half of The Hunt's members from participating in unnecessary missions.
“Then how are we both here and there?” he gestures over to the other end of the room wildly, suddenly confused, and sporting one hell of a headache for it. (or falling 20 stories. That could be relative.) Steve prime doesn’t say anything at first, merely crosses the room, and stops behind the hospital bed, leans down low, where he can keep his face level with bed ridden Tony’s. the look he gives the engineer is soft, fond, open in a way that makes Tony’s chest hurt, and he has to look away, despite the fact that it’s technically
Skin on skin, whispered promises and moans that work into a jumble of wordless, meaningless syllables, that mean much more for their cadence and tone, than their actual meaning. A bright, burning feeling, that’s as comforting as falling asleep in the sun.
“hey, hey, you’re gonna be ok. Tell me… tell me what happened.” She stutters a few times, before she’s able to form words properly, and she chokes around a sob.
“Colonel, a squad is incoming, 2 minutes and counting.” Steve could swear the world actually stops spinning, and the moment drags on for an inordinate amount longer than it should. It’s done then. Tony was right, they should have stayed in Italy, or taken their chances with telling T’challa. Steve coming back into the country was a remarkable, incredible mistake. He growls lowly, and fixes Rhodey with a death glare. It feels like he should say something, but there aren’t words foul enough in the English language for what he feels right now. He whines softly, and cups Tony’s face gently, tilting his chin to look up at him, not unlike so many months ago, hidden safely in the summer house.
“Yeah, yeah, message received.” he says, though, there’s actually no bite to his words, no anger, surprisingly. “You should try it though. It’s sweet.” Bucky leans back, hip against the bar, as he crosses his arms, looking down the curve of his nose, at Clint.
He reaches out to run a hand through Steve's hair, pushing it back and away from his eyes. For once, Tony had fallen into a peaceful sleep, and he'd be lying if he said it had nothing to do with the scent of his alpha surrounding him as he drifted off, but waking to screaming...Yeah, more than a little unnerving.
Amnesty is… proving to be a little more difficult than they all thought it would be. Tony and T’challa are both still trying, but they’re getting nowhere fast, and at the close of Tony’s second month, they still don’t have anything definitive. Steve tries not to worry, trying to protect Tony from his own feelings, but he loses sleep over it.
It’s cruel and he knows it, but he can’t exactly say he’s sorry for it. He can’t even say he /wishes/ he was, because he doesn’t. If Steve thinks he can get by with a few messages and an apology letter that wasn’t even really an apology letter, then he’s got another thing coming.
Steve's quiet for several long, telling seconds, and when he finally does manage to speak, his voice is ragged and harsh. “It's… it's easy, Bucky. It's like it was with you. Like it is with you.” He buries his face further into Bucky's shoulder because he can't stand to see the look on his husband's face, when he hears that news. It can't be easy. Hell, it isn't easy for Steve to feel. His grip tightens on Bucky, and he draws the brunette in as close as he can. “It don't mean I love you any less, ok? Nobody could take me from you, not God himself, Jamie.”
Kissing Tony is some kind of intoxicating. Steve loses track of time, and can’t even bring himself to care about the inconvenience. He could have been kissing Tony for five minutes, or five years. he doesn’t even care. The light from the curtains is slanting, showing the passing of time, and his stomach is definitely rumbling, but he can’t bring himself to pull away, because this… whatever it is that they have, seems like a spell, the kind that breaks if either of them move.
It sounds dramatic, even when he reads it to himself. It's the truth, but maybe he shouldn't be that blunted. He sighs and deletes the message.
Harley smirks, and shoveles yet another way too big bite of overly sugary crap into his mouth, gesturing disdainfully at Peters more nutritionally sound breakfast of choice. “why do you eat that crap. Just cause your aunt’s like a thousand years old doesn’t mean you are.”
is he something, up close. His eyes sparkle with an intelligence, and a danger that's more than a little intriguing. Steve's instantly hooked, and he's already pretty sure he's leaving with this guy, if he has anything to say about it. He smiles slow and easy and tilts his chin back in an assessing nod.
"Yours," he agrees, coming back to himself enough to speak around the trapped whines in his throat. "'m yours, Steve. I swear." And there's some smug satisfaction in knowing that Steve's his, too, even if it's an unspoken thing between them. The bond mark on his neck throbs and Tony presses his head against the pillow to stifle any wounded noises. The last time they slept together, they hadn't had time to renew the marks. And Tony hates to admit that it's affected him more than he cares for, amped the whole 'abandoned omega' thing up to a twelve.
On the drive over, Tony'd noticed a cab tailing them for a couple of blocks, at the start of the journey - so Jess and Clint can stop worrying, because he
“Thanks, Fri. I’m good, I’ll get something later.” There’s another long beat of silence, and Tony’s just started to turn his full attention back to the soldering pencil in his hand, when FRIDAY whirs again, softly.
Steve doesn’t give him the chance to finish whatever that thought might be, because he’s been guilted by enough military brass, that he knows a dressing down when he hears one.
Not, mind you, that Tony can't already smell Steve from the other side of the door, woodsy and deep, with the softest hint of sweetness, like a campfire and roasting marshmallows. He smells perfect. He smells like
Steve shoots Bucky a look and he puts the gun down, finally, though his eyes are still much more than stormy. At least he isn’t planning on shooting anyone, right now. Steve sighs, and resists the urge to grovel at Tony’s feet. He said he’d find a way, so he has to trust that. Even if his instincts are telling him that it’s just a polite way to give him the brush off.
Steve sits and listens with rapt attention, hanging off of every single word that Tony says. He’s fascinated, and terrified, all at once. He wants to believe that Tony’s well again, but the reality of the situation is that he’s still banged up from the fall, he still has a long way to go, before he’s anywhere near field ready again. Steve doesn’t care if he never goes into the field again, he just wants his friend to be ok. There’s something that bothers him, something that he feels like he needs to clarify.
“I don’t… I know. I just. Trust me, I know.” He shakes his head, and runs shaking fingers through his hair. He’s too deeply into his feelings, too close to the edge of panic, and he needs to step back, or fall over the ledge. As much as he loves Rhodey, he’s part of the problem right now. If Tony wants to have any chance of getting a grip on his feelings, he needs to make sure that there’s no one around to bear witness to them. He needs machinery, simple, logical machinery.  Something he can take apart, and put back together the exact same way every time. emotions, and the humans they belong to are too dynamic. Too much variable, not enough conclusive data. Tony sighs heavily, and pushes himself out of the chair, taking a deep breath to steady himself as soon as he’s standing.
Steve can't help the sigh of relief that escapes him, he had been so fucking certain that the brunette wouldn't come to him, wouldn't want anything to do with him after everything. God knows it would serve him right. He buries his nose in the top of Tony's head, pressing a kiss there, and slowly breathing his soft clean scent. When he pulls back, a smile is on his lips.
“Now. I just… just wanna get it out of the way. Living room?” When no one openly objects, he leads the way to the cozy living room, and plops down on the couch. He leaves spaces on either side of him but the armchair is also straight across from it. He very nearly loses his nerve. He said he'd confess, and he meant it, but damn was it hard. He sighed and dropped his head to stare at the floor, fingers resting not so comfortably in his own hair. “I… I've been using drugs, the last three weeks. More than weed, I mean.” He says softly, closing his eyes against the weight of his statement.
“Yeah. Yeah, I don’t have anything. Do you… want to meet at the gallery?” he knows it sounds kind of tacky, like he just wants to roll back into bed with the guy (he does) but there’s so much to talk about, and they need to decide where this is going, if anywhere. “I’ll cook.” He tries, hoping he doesn’t sound like he’s desperately trying to cover. (he is). “Clothes on, Bucky told. The right way, this time, honey.” Tony hums, as if he actually needs a moment to consider whether or not he wants to meet up at the gallery.
"Think that'll tide you over til we get there." His mind's running a mile a minute as Steve shuts the car door for him, and he has to wonder if they'll actually make it to Steve's place or rather wind up in the backseat. Usually, Tony would cringe at the idea of something so 'teenage', something that screamed of impatience, but drunk Tony has ideas of his own on what he does and doesn't like, and the fact that they're both still dressed at this point falls firmly into the 'doesn't like' category. He feels his phone buzz a few times in his back pocket, decides to ignore it for the night. Probably only Clint.
There’s a strange energy between Steve and Tony though, something significant, that neither of them are talking about. It seems like something needs to be admitted to, but Steve can’t exactly identify what it would be. He clears his throat for the fifteenth time, and Tony finally sits up, looking over to him.
Tony manages to hold back a whine or a pout when Steve pulls back like he’s just been hit with an electric shock, and he’s more than used to Logan greeting him in the exact same way this guy’s greeting him and Steve, though something’s distinctly more… off about this. Logan always wears a smirk, and he’s usually waiting in the kitchen when Tony stumbles out of his room for food, and his body language is a lot more relaxed than this guy. It takes Tony a few seconds to piece everything together – and he’s sure he would’ve been a lot faster had he not been drinking last night – and the wedding ring he can see on the new man’s finger is more than enough of a giveaway, the final piece of the puzzle.
“Who I am, isn’t really important. What’s important, big guy, is that I have information you want.” He walks closer to Tony’s bed, and Steve feels something not unlike hackles start to raise on the back of his neck. The newcomer must sense this though, because he sits down in one of the abandoned chairs, and focuses up at Steve. From this distance, Steve can tell that he’s either an active alcoholic, or very recently recovering from addiction. He’s not sure if that makes him feel more or less sympathetic to him. maybe neither. The newcomer clears his throat again, and points to tony, like he’s not the most important person in the room . (not that Steve’s admitting to anything. He’s not.) “Einstein-Rosen bridges. You’ve heard of them, yes? Jane Foster, Thor’s main squeeze?”
"You only hold me up like this, 'cause you don't know who I really am... I've got headaches, and bad luck but they couldn't touch you, no. I'm not tryin' you only hold me up, like this..."
“Or we could open the floor to other suggestions,” Tony says, and the statement lifts up at the end, rendering it more of a question than anything concrete. “Y’know, Steve, something that doesn’t end in me dying because you left out a pretty damn crucial piece of information. ‘Oh, hey, I have a husband,’ would’ve sufficed.”
“Head back to the tower. Get showers, food, rest. You can come back any time after that, I’ll… I’ll keep you updated, as best I can.”
He whines softly into the kiss, and they're pressed close enough together despite the size of the bed around them that Tony can roll his hips against Steve's, hoping that he gets the memo.
“Juniper.” he says, softly. Confusion must be written all over Bucky’s face, because the other enforcer clears his throat and speaks again, no less quiet this time, though his vocal tone is stronger now. More sure “The main flavor. To gin it’s… Juniper.” Bucky swallows thickly, and he has to will himself to speak past the lump that’s suddenly lodged in his throat.
His fingers have started trembling where he’s working on a circuit board, accidentally frying the delicate wiring. Dum-E approaches with his fire extinguisher, and Tony barely has time to get out a, “Ah!” to get the bot to back off. He really needs to take the extinguisher away from him. Flicking his equipment off so as to not set the ‘shop on fire, he leans back in his chair, gaze gravitating back towards the drawer.
“we, ah… it would be helpful if a member of the team, anyone who knows what was going on, what the mission was, any environmental factors, could accompany him. It’ll save some time with the charting, help the doctors know what kind of tests to run.”
“Okay. That’s… how far did he fall, is there much left of the suit? Maybe we can have medical go over the footage that FRIDAY picked up?” Clint looks up toward the sky, and Steve feels his stomach flip over for every inch more that his eyes travel up. Finally, mercifully, they stop, and Steve swallows thickly.
Steve growls softly, and his hands come up to grip at the two perfect globes of Tony's ass. he kneads them softly, with overeager fingers, as his hips twitch involuntarily upward.
Tony presses himself closer to Steve, turns his head so that he can speak to Steve instead of to the ceiling.
“Stay.” the engineer says, sleep soft and fuzzy, and damnit, Clint almost does. It takes a moment or two, to convince his mutinous body to push the genius up, but eventually, he does.
Tony finds the glasses after checking five different cupboards, and decides that Steve needs to rethink his interior design choices for the kitchen. Or maybe think about investing in signs for each section. That would go a long way to helping in times like this. He lets the tap run for a second, makes sure the water’s cold before he fills it three-quarters of the way up so that Bucky doesn’t end up spilling it on himself and, if he does, there’s less to clean up. When he pads back into the bedroom, he raises an eyebrow at the way Bucky’s sprawled across the bed. One leg’s still on the floor, and it doesn’t even look like he managed to get that shoe off. With a sigh, Tony sets the glass down on the bedside table and kneels down to tug the shoe off, moves his leg so that it’s properly on the bed, and decides that it’s probably best if he sleeps on the couch for the next few hours. Steve and Bucky both need rest, and Tony’s still young enough that sleeping on a couch won’t feel like hell for the next week. Still, he runs a hand through his hair, sets about pulling the blankets back up over Steve where they’ve fallen down because it’s cold out and the last thing either of them need is to come down with something. “You’re both gonna be the death of me,” he mutters, to no one but himself.
“Don’t see the family resemblance? I mean, I know I haven’t shaved in a while, but I thought at least I’d be recognizable.” He smirks again, and tilts his head to the side in a show of manufactured adorability. “I’m his cousin. Maria’s side. The Carbonell genes always run strong.”  Famike might have said no at one point, might have insisted that he show some form of identification, or some other form of security measure, but the charm that Ed lays on thick seems to smooth away whatever remaining worries she had, and she simply smiles.
Steve has about a thousand arguments to that, just ready and waiting on the tip of his tongue, propriety, and manners, and morality aside, but with Tony in his space, he can’t seem to manage to get any of them out. He takes a breath that’s rougher than he imagines it has any right to be, and closes his eyes on a soft sigh. “Don’t suppose you’re going to let it go any time soon?”
The bar's relatively empty compared to the floor, and Tony orders something pink and fruity that definitely has a higher percentage than anything Clint'll order. As expected, he's sat down on one of the free stools for all of two seconds when Clint sits down next to him, gives him a look, and places an order of his own. Gin. Tony resists the urge to make a face.
“Tony Armstrong. Former weapons manufacturer for the Department of Defense, CEO of Stark industries, billionaire, philanthropist, playboy.” Steve raises an eyebrow at that. The name Stark, he knows.
“C’mon. I gotta go work. I got a lead on Davis.” Tony pouts, but Clint suspects that he might have done that, no matter what the hell the blond said.
Steve looks torn, honestly torn, between going and staying but hell he has to do something for Bucky right? And the longer he's staying here, the more and more he feels like he's inching toward that something being grabbing the needle and the Rock he has and giving it to Bucky just to stop the pain. He whines and rises out of bed, shoving his legs into his Pyjamas before running for the stairs to grab the paramedics. Bucky whines and writes on the bed. “why do you have to do this to us, huh? We were happy, Tony! Happily married for six years!” it's not fair not by a long shot but Bucky feels like his brain is melting and he's angry no matter if it's fair or not.
Walking through the palace is still odd, and Steve tries to make himself look as small as he possibly can, a feat that’s not exactly easy given his super soldier stature, and the fact that an alpha making an active effort to be less intimidating is apparently a walking contradiction. By the time he’s outside, where it doesn’t feel like walls are closing in on him, he’s almost talked himself out of the anxiety attack that’s been encroaching.
“Boss, it’s time for a break.” He hums to himself, a half annoyed, half exasperated sound. He’s too close to finishing off this last problem, he’ll take a break in a bit. Maybe five minutes pass, of him fiddling with the circuitry in peace, and then FRIDAY is chiming again.
For the longest time, he debates what he should say back. There are so many things he wants to say, wants to tell Steve, the most obvious one a nagging thought in the back of his brain. But he can’t make himself say that. Steve didn’t know that Tony was pregnant—Hell, Tony hadn’t known that he was pregnant until it was too late.
There’s a lot that steve can resist. Torture, suffering, shitty impulse sales based in abusive marketing. He’s strong of will, able to stand his ground more of the time than not, but one thing he could absolutely never figure out how to refuse, is Tony. the way he begs, so sweet and perfect, Steve crumples completely.
One of the decorative stock photos on the wall across from him, right next to the picture of “Melinda R., Radiology, Super Star Staff of the Quarter!”, is a seemingly innocent shot of a pretty flower, but the blood red color, is jarring. There are four huge petals clinging desperately to the hairy stem. The seed head is enormous, more closely resembling a forest, than a flower, as zoomed in as it is. It  reminds him of the stories his mother would tell him as a child, when he was coughing too bad to sleep. She was a wonderfully devout Irish catholic woman, so naturally the stories were designed to scare the daylights out of him. He remembers her telling him in hushed tones, of fairy trees, and how naughty little boys and girls that were too curious, might disturb the FaeFolk that lived in those trees, and summon a fetch, an eerie spectral copy of themselves, who would take them away to hell, never to see their mothers and fathers again. He shivers unpleasantly at the memory, and blinks hard, determined to ‘unsee’ the horrific faerie tale his mind had conjured up.
Tony's spine straightens at the sound of Steve knocking against the door, the way it seems entirely too loud in the otherwise quiet house. The TV's on low in the background, some trashy Italian soap opera that Tony long ago stopped paying attention to, and he can feel his fight or flight response kicking into gear. There's no more postponing this, really. He pushes himself up from the couch slowly, careful to not move too much because his doctors advised him to stay away from blockers and suppressants for his first heat post-surgery, allow his body to fully recover, and he's marginally petrified of Steve catching the scent.
Bucky and Steve had an open relationship, where one night stands were allowed, as long as they talked about it first. Steve didn't mention it because he was crossfaded, and obviously this is more than a one night stand. it works out, but that doesn't mean that Steve didn't put both of them in a kinda crappy position. poor guy means well. <3 feel free to come scream at me on tumblr! @thejovialkynnadyg-ray.
Steve is careful with his steps, lightly placing one foot in front of the other, and trying to be as small in the environment as he possibly can. He feels like a kid again, like when he knew he had what for coming from his ma, but she wasn’t done fixing dinner, or washing the dishes. The weight of dread presses in on him from all sides, and he’s relatively certain that he can feel himself going mad with the anticipation. Tony offers no kind of succor either, silent and deliberate in his movements. Steve’s almost ready to heave a sigh of relief when they reach the private office, because at least he won’t have to play the ‘what if’ game anymore.
“That’s the bastard that took out our last three marks, Stevie.” Steve scoffs curtly, and other than a slight twitch to the corner of his lips, his demeanor doesn’t change.
A quiet huff of breath is knocked out of his chest, when the realization hits him. Tony Armstrong is
“‘Mmh, sorry babe, never claimed to be.” Goddamnit. The pet names, the familiarity between them is still too easy, it’s entirely too comfortable, to let himself fall back into. He needs to keep his head screwed on right, it’s not like this is the time for distractions. “What’s up, Stark?” he asks, a touch more removed.
"damn, Tony, impatience looks good on you." He growls before he reaches for a condom with shaking hands and rips it open, rolling it on as fast as he possibly can. He's a little shaky with the lube, so there ends up being a bit of a mess but it isn't like he can't afford to fucking replace the bedding, so he chooses to ignore it for now. He crowds into Tony's space, and kisses the breath out of him, before lining his cock up and pushing in slowly.
He should say no, he should turn away, and be done with it, but he’s weak, and something tells him that’s the only way he’ll ever be able to have Steve. He sighs softly, but his lips quirk up in something of a smile.
Meds down, he grabs his aids and steps back into his room, ducking into a shirt, and hoodie, before heading back to the living room, to check on Lucky. As expected, he’s laying at the doorway, staring at clint with intention. The archer sighs, and nods. “Yeah, yeah. We’ll go outside.” it’s all exactly the way it has been for the last three years, and he likes that. He’s comfortable with it. Which explains why it has to go to shit, when he’s halfway around the block.
Bucky smirks softly, and shakes his head. “not quite.” He moves to walk a little further down the hall, pushing past the confused nurse who looks like it’s in her job description to argue, but really doesn’t want to. Bucky waves her off, and she goes willingly enough. When Tony stands in the exact same spot he was occupying a moment ago, Bucky raises an eyebrow at him. “are you… gonna c’mere, or…?”
Steve tenses, where he’s leaned up against the kitchen counter, and flicks his eyes over to Tony, to gage his reaction. Which is… nothing. He’s staring uninterrupted, at his StarkPad, sipping his coffee. Figures he’s used to this by now.
"I... Italy. Please." He hates asking Tony to do this for him, to go across several time zones because he's a sad sack. But the rogues have better image in the public eye, in most parts of Europe, versus where they're Villainized  in America. It's something to keep in mind, should they be spotted, and god, how he hopes they aren’t spotted. They really don’t need to be doing this at all. He huffs out a nervous breath, and runs a hand through his hair, making a quick mental plan. He needs a jet, needs to make an excuse why he's gone. Needs to tell Bucky to keep his fat mouth shut, because he’s going to know, the moment he looks at Steve’s face. It's nothing undoable. He just needs to get moving, use the cover of night to make this as invisible as possible. And then soon... Soon, he'll have Tony back, in whatever capacity it means.He shifts lightly in the bed, and his hips pop uncomfortably, pulling an involuntary growl out of him. And that’s not… that’s not ideal, is it? A sinking cold icy feeling washes over him and he whines as he's hit with a sudden realization.
Steve makes a strange little sound, that’s something between a growl, and a whine. It’s unattractive, and odd, and it hurts his throat, but he doesn’t know which sound would be better for the situation. He wants to help Tony, wants to get on with it, but..
“Yeah. He created the vita ray. Not to mention half the weapons Cap ever touched, HYDRA swag not included.” Steve feels something ugly cross his face, and a muscle in his jaw tics and jumps with the effort of restraint.
“Tony.” he starts off quietly. “I don’t know if you can hear me, but… you’ve gotta come back, pal. I don’t know what I’m gonna do without ya. Or what I’m gonna tell the team. No one knows what happened, and I hate that I wasn’t there for you. If you don’t come back, I don’t know how I’m gonna forgive myself for this.” He hates how pathetic it sounds, but it’s true. He cares about tony, more than he maybe has any logical, sane, reasonable right to. He feels like he’s spinning out of control, and has no idea what to do. He sniffles softly, and drops his forehead to the edge of the bed. “Tony, you gotta come back to me. I… I love you.” It feels odd, to say it out loud, after all of this time, but right nonetheless.
Tony makes a distressed noise in the back of his throat. That’s not something he ever wants Steve to think, that he hates him because he’s fallen into bad habits. Pushing himself up out of the armchair, he ends up kneeling on the floor in front of Steve, reaches up to try and brush away some of the tears falling from Steve’s eyes. This…This isn’t something he ever wants to see again. He doesn’t like how quickly he’s become attached, but he hates seeing how hurt Steve is, and his heart aches with each beat. “Steve, sweetheart, I could never hate you,” he says, and though his voice is gentle, it leaves no room for arguments. “And Bucky doesn’t hate you either, alright? He’s upset and, said it himself, he needs some time to clear his head so he won’t say something he doesn’t mean. He’s left so he can gather himself and not hurt your relationship, okay? And you…You just need some help, Steve. You’re not…This isn’t your proudest moment, sure, but you can still build yourself back up, and I’m gonna be here every step of the way, making sure you don’t relapse. But I could never hate you, honey. Promise.”
Tony shifts all of his weight to one arm, to reach back and lay his hand over Steve's, if only for a second before he has to return to his original position or risk toppling over. He can hold his weight on one arm, there's no doubt about that, but as disoriented as he is with heat, it's probably not the smartest idea in the world.
Steve has to use his hand to stifle the laugh that’s begging to break out, and he miraculously manages to disguise it as a cough. Tony, for his part, merely rolls his eyes, and takes another sip of his coffee. Peter’s only thrown for a second or two before he’s retaliating.
“Thanks, Nat.” he smirks, and points to a smudge on the polished wood, where his forehead had just been. “missed a spot.”
Tony huffs out a quiet breath that's almost a chuckle, and shakes his head slightly, wriggling around for a few moments until he's turned around and is facing Steve. He knows that a good few hours have passed since he and Steve fell asleep, evidence by the fact that it's sunset outside, and really that says a lot given that they met before noon and sun doesn't set until eight or nine at night in the summer. It means neither of them have been sleeping, and being together allows them to do that a little easier, even if Steve still has his nightmares.
“I… I can’t wait anymore, Tony, I need you.” He trails a hand up the inside of Tony’s thigh, lingering over his skin, letting his touch burn a brand there. He should be slow, he should be caring and kind and soft, but something tells him that Tony is just as ready for this, as he is.he sinks two fingers into his omega, and hisses out a harsh breath through his teeth, at the way his inner walls are already tightening and clenching around his fingers. “shh. I know baby. I gotcha.”
“Tony? Tones! C’mon, buddy, I need you to tell me what’s going on.” Tony gasps hard, and screws his eyes shut, against another wave of pain. His hands clutch at his stomach, as his brain flounders for words that even sort of make sense.
It’s good. It’s so fucking good, and Steve finds himself biting into his lower lip, trying to keep from either growling obnoxiously, or popping his knot after a handful of thrusts. It’s ultimately useless, and he whines frustratedly, dragging the fingers of one hand through Tony’s hair. “baby… fuck… I… ‘m not gonna last long. ‘m sorry.”
“text him, Steve.” Steve shakes his head, and drops his head back against the wall, letting his eyes flutter closed. If Bucky expects a response, he doesn’t make it apparent, and he doesn’t press for one. Steve hunkers down into his hoodie, in an effort to escape the cold that’s been one with his bones for just over three months
[so trigger warning, for minorly gruesome torture of a minor character. It’s incredibly brief, and I’ll put it between three *’s so you know where to skip to, if you don’t want to read it!]
“Home wasn't a set house, or a single town on a map. It was wherever the people who loved you were, whenever you were together. Not a place, but a moment, and then another, building on each other like bricks to create a solid shelter that you take with you for your entire life, wherever you may go.”
“I… actually, if you don’t mind… I mean, I understand if you want to back out. But… I’m ok with it.” He worries at the thick duvet, where he’s balled it up in his hands. He’s nervous, and it shows in every single line of his posture, but it’s going to be ok. It has to be, because he’s this close to having tony back again. “I’m… I’m still on suppressants. And I’ll wear patches, and scent blockers, if you want just… god, Tony, I miss you. I’m ok with it, if you are.” There’s a moment of silence between them, a few beats of nothing in the dead air space that’s significant enough to have them both on edge, and then finally, mercifully, Tony speaks.
U sets a mug of something—herbal tea, maybe, if the smell is anything to go by—on the desk next to Tony, and both bots watch him expectantly. “’m not going to bed,” he mutters, reaching out to pat Dum-E’s claw. “Too early.”
"It did," he concedes with a slight nod, and he doesn't make any moves to get away from Steve. That's certainly a warning sign - even in the medical bay, Rhodey and Claire are the only ones allowed to go anywhere near his injuries and scars. "Some guys thought they could kidnap Howard Stark's son for ransom," he says, and he wants to shrug the words off. It hadn't been his first kidnapping, and he's not sure if he's safer now with The Hunt. "Guess they wanted to scare me a little, or teach dad what would happen if he didn't pay." He's got scars from that, sure, a few down his back and one across his calf, but the bullet hole isn't from that. Still, telling Steve he was in a firefight is going to raise some questions.
“You can’t call me a Neanderthal!” his eyes flash for a second, the only sign that he’s panicking, and it’s maybe the span of a single second, before he’s continuing, assured of his own words. “My mom and sister are dead, I have no family, you’re contractually obligated to be nice to me!”
“it’s alright, Mister rogers. We’ll have him fixed in no time, our staff is very well educated.” She turns to leave the room, but stops just shy, turning back toward Ed. “sir, I’m sorry, I’m so goal oriented, I didn’t see you before. We’re trying to keep it to family only at this time. May I ask what relation you have to mister Stark? Ed panics, but only for a moment, before his brain kicks into overdrive, and works to find him a quick excuse. He smiles, saccharine sweet, and even goes as far as to bat an eyelash at Famike, who smiles and titters.
Steve blinks open fiercely golden eyes, his top lip curling in a snarl, until he realizes that he’s looking at Tony. “baby. Hey, you shouldn’t be standing.” He furrows his eyebrows together in concern, and shuffles them and their pups until he’s standing, and Tony’s in the chair he was just occupying. Steve smiles softly, and hands over the other bundle, this one with a hat that has a tiny purple bow affixed to it. Steve looks every bit, the proud father he is. “you’ve already met out son. Here’s our daughter.”
Tony’s just taken Dream Steve’s hand, is just getting ready to walk down the hall with him, when there’s a lurch feeling that stops him dead in his tracks. It’s something kind of like nausea, but with the added misery of butterflies and jitters all at once. He doesn’t make a conscious effort to let go of Dream Steve’s hand,  but the next that he’s aware, it’s gone. Dream Steve is talking to him, is saying something, but Tony can’t hear him anymore. His mouth is moving, but he’s suddenly fuzzy at the edges, ill-defined like looking at an image through a cup of water. The last thing he hears, is Dream Steve screaming his name, and then he’s blinking his eyes open slowly, to cornsilk blonde hair and big hands, gripped tightly onto the blanket.
“Tones? Tones, you here? You were supposed to head out to the compound and—” his sentence stops off short, and Steve knows he’s been spotted. His mind scrambles for some kind of explanation, anything that explains why he’s sitting in the floor, holding Tony, while the omega cowers. Rage flicks over Rhodeys face, and Steve raises his hands out to the side, placatingly. Which is maybe the worst move that he could have made, given that there’s still blood on his hands. He winces visibly.
Tony’s words have a possessive, aggressive growl tearing through his chest, and his hips stutter and still for just a moment, before he pulls out completely. He settles one hand over Tony’s shoulder, and flips him easily, so that he’s laying on his back. So they’re face to face. Steve’s quick to crowd up against him, get back into his space, and he pauses only to bend down and press hot, opened mouthed kisses to Tony’s jaw, and scent glands.
“Bucky I… I can’t, ok? I just… I can’t.” it feels like a lackluster explanation, and it probably is, but he can’t think of what to add to make it better. Fortunately, Bucky has always known when to push, and when to let it go, so they lapse back into silence, and this time it lasts, without intervention. They both turn back to the water, watching the antelope that step gingerly on the far bank of the river, dipping their sloping necks to drink their fill before the sun heats the water. When Bucky speaks again, his voice is quiet, timid almost.
“I’m gonna die, aren’t I?” Tony blinks at her, confused, at first, and then he sees it. The bright red splotches of color seeping through her shirt, and clinging to her skin. Blood. Instantly, he’s on high alert, and he’s stepping forward, eager, desperate to help. As an Avenger, he sees his fair share of blood, but he’s absolutely not prepared to see it, in this case. On a girl, who can’t be more than sixteen. Tony reaches out, and pulls her closer, reaching for her arm to look at it.
Tony makes a ‘humph’ noise as he rolls over, takes a second to notice that Steve let go of him at some point during the night, except technically it still is the night. One glance at the clock informs him it’s four in the goddamn morning, and he’s five seconds away from just pulling Bucky down onto the bed with them to get him to shut up before he wakes Steve up. He doesn’t do that. Sadly. In the end, he pushes himself up onto his elbows so that he’s in an odd half-sitting position, and raises an eyebrow at Bucky. He looks noticeably dishevelled, even in the dim light coming through from the start of the sunrise, and Tony can’t really see his eyes, but the mere way he’s holding himself is familiar. Jess, Tony thinks absently, and then he takes a deep breath because that means Bucky probably isn’t one hundred percent sober, and that’s never good. “Bucky,” he says, slow and careful, sure to keep his voice quiet so he doesn’t disturb Steve, “you okay? You wanna come sleep for a while?”
what Steve was expecting, to say the least. The room is fundamentally a Captain America museum. There are posters, cards, comics, and propaganda arranged lovingly all over the room. He collection was clearly curated by a fan, that much is evident from the inset lighting, and protective cases over almost everything. There isn’t a single speck of dust anywhere in this room, and that’s nearly staggering to Steve. If that wasn’t enough to fully rob the air out of his lungs, the centerpiece on the right wall, is. Mounted in a plexiglass case, polished to a high shine, is the dented, rusted, well loved shield that Steve had carried onstage for every USO appearance. He moves to sink his hand into his pockets, in an effort to hide the way that seeing all of this has staggered him.
Okoye is the one that ‘rescues’ Steve, and frankly he’s never been more terrified of silence. She watches him, pacing around the enclosed area of the jet, but offers absolutely nothing in terms of her thoughts, or any news on… any front, and it’s absolutely nervewracking, to have nothing to go on. He must be sighing, because at one point, she looks at him, and with the most minute inclination of her head, stares directly into his soul. He’s just about to the point of losing his goddamned mind, when she says the only helpful thing he’s heard all day. “we’re approaching Wakandan airspace. T’challa is waiting for you.” Steve’s worked up enough at this point, that that simple news is almost enough to break him.
Falling sucks. Tony doesn’t remember much about where he is, or what he was doing before, but he knows it feels like several important parts of his spine, that should probably have spaces between them have definitely been compacted. He’s… going to be feeling that tomorrow. He blinks his eyes open slowly, and asks FRIDAY for an adaptive sitrep, tell him what happened since he checked out. The various displays and lights are still blazing bright around him, so power didn’t flicker. Which means…
It’s been two days, three hours, forty seven minutes, and nineteen seconds since Steve had woken up in a fake rehabilitation room (or a real rehabilitation room, with fake décor, and a fake nurse, he still hasn’t really worked that out) and he already hates what the world has become. Everything is too loud, too bright,  too… wrong. Entirely too alien and wrong. It’s like something out of a HYDRA Christmas catalogue, tech and lights, and sounds every which way you turn. It makes him sick.
Bucky smiles softly, brushes a piece of hair behind Steve’s ear, in a motion that’s maybe a little fonder than they usually are. “Sure thing, doll.”
There’s a bad smell, he thinks. Something antisepticey, and wrong. He wonders if Steve might have cut himself or something. Maybe it’s whatever he used to clean up the blood. Wherever it came from. There’s an itch on his arm, and he reaches up to scratch at it, without looking. His heart stops cold, when he realizes that what his fingertips are touching, is an IV line.
Tony slipped off the dancefloor the second he caught glimpse of Clint over at the side of the room, heading the opposite direction, towards the bar. He knows that Clint has to have seen him, probably followed him here in the first place, checking up on him for Pepper or for Jessica, but his mental health isn't affecting the quality of the work he's doing, so it's none of their business. If he wants to get piss-drunk and jump the next thing that flirts with him, that's what he's going to do. He knows that there are drugs on the floor, knows he's
“Uh.” He says intelligently, dropping his blue eyes to the tabletop uncomfortably. He hasn’t really spent long thinking about what exactly it is that he’s thankful for. He supposes that maybe, he’s thankful for not having to carry the shield again, for being able to just
He grips Tony’s ass tightly, taking a moment to fully appreciate how absolutely perfect he looks like this. His muscles are corded, tensing and rippling in the anticipation of what’s to come. Tony’s entire body is impatient for his alpha, for Steve, and that one singular fact settles deeply into his chest and makes him growl out his satisfaction.
Tony moves to press a kiss to Steve's nose, thinking the offer over. He doesn't particularly want to take a nap, wants to get as much out of the night as he can because he knows that they'll be parting ways tomorrow, and that he probably won't run across Steve again. At the same time, a thirty-minute power-nap doesn't sound too bad, would probably allow him to sleep off at least a little of the alcohol.
“quite a collection you have here… didn’t peg you for a Captain America fan. Isn’t he… kinda overly righteous?” Steve’s damn
The anxiety isn’t new, but that fact doesn’t make Steve resent its presence any less. He’d dealt with nightmares, and persistent thoughts after coming out of the ice in the first place, after Bucky fell trying to chase down Red Skull, hell, all the way back to Azzano, when he couldn’t find Bucky.
There's no denying that Steve has a point. Even if he was capable of arguing, Tony couldn't argue with that. If they try to do this too quickly, Tony's just going to end up sore and bruised for all the wrong reasons and, really, he's been switching between a constant ache and a constant emptiness for the past few months enough to know that he doesn't want to put himself through any more pain than he has to. For a single second, he hates biology, the fact that he has to go through this again only months after almost dying on the operating table. He hates it. But he doesn't hate Steve. And it's important to make that distinction there.
The rooftop garden is surprisingly well kept, for as hot as it is, this time of year. Where you might expect there to be dead leaves, or plants scorched by wind and sun and not enough water, it’s instead, lush and green, and flowery. Wind blows through the few trees that are up here, leaving a nice rustling sound that makes a great ambience. Tony’s just relaxed, leaning up against the back of his wheelchair (the orderlies had insisted, despite them both arguing against it.) eyes closed, enjoying the sunlight on him after what felt like a week straight inside, under fluorescent lights.
“A week.” He agrees. He fiddles with a bit of fuzz on the top of the island, and speaks to it, instead of Tony. “I… I should probably wait a little longer. Take a few missions. It’ll look suspicious if I don’t and… America’s dangerous enough already. Better not to tempt fate. Tony looks like he might cry (which is a sentiment Steve echoes himself, honestly.) but he nods. They’ve decided, for the time being it’s best not to tell anyone that Tony’s expecting. Not until they have amnesty figured out, and it’s legal for Steve to be with him. It’s just a few weeks. It feels like lying, but it really is the best option. They finish off their meager breakfast (not surprisingly, no one’s hungry) and share the briefest of kisses, before they split ways. A few weeks. It’s not… it’s not the end of the world. Even if it feels like it.
wasn’t the greatest irony—or… he can’t let his mind go there, it’s been three weeks, the call isn’t coming. “Go for Steve.” He growls out, after turning off the call holding system.
“are you ok? Were you scared?” Tony shrugs one shoulder, and looks off at the farthest point of the city skyline that he can see.
Steve groans longsufferingly and punches Bucky in the shoulder, albeit adoringly. “C’mon, when you say it like that, I sound like a total pansy.” Although, to be fair, he is kind of a pansy, at this point. He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, trying to find a way to sum up the feeling in a way that makes any kind of sense.
With a bit of distance in between them, he’s actually able to look at Tony, actually look at him for the first time. he smiles softly. “Your hair’s long.” Not like he has any right to comment on it, lumberjack that he looks like. “It’s… I like it.”
There’s a teary moment or two, where Peter insists they all mention what it is they’re thankful for. Harley says he’s glad he doesn’t spend his days alone anymore, and Peter quietly thanks Tony for the care his aunt May receives at the nursing home she’s apparently in. Tony blushes prettily, and makes a few vague hand gestures, and suddenly it clicks into place, for Steve. Tony’s paying for her to be there. The moment passes quickly enough, and Tony jokingly says his thanks for the almighty coffee bean. Steve’s noticed that the engineer tends to do that, use sarcasm and jokes as a form of deflection. He wonders what it is the man has to hide from so adamantly, but three pairs of eyes are on him, and he realizes that it’s his turn.
“Awh c’mon Tony, everyone's gotta have hobbies.” He carefully doesn’t say that he loves here, because that’s a lie, and lying’s the last thing he wants to do to Tony. For reasons he still doesn’t quite understand. He also fails to mention that half of the art is his, because really, does it matter? It's not like he wants to actually /date/ this guy right? This is about pure attraction, a quick fuck with a pretty guy he met in a club. That easy. He throws open the door, and steps back allowing Tony to head in before he does. The apartment is clean, and blissfully devoid of all weapons and drugs, for once. Steve smiles gently, self-deprecatingly “Home sweet home.” Tony turns back around to face Steve, presses another kiss to his cheek because it's ridiculously difficult to say no to what his body wants to do when he's like this. There's also the unfortunate fact that he recently realized - or, it was pointed out to him by Logan and Karen - that he's a stupidly tactile person when he hasn't been drinking, and any alcohol seems to just increase that want tenfold.
The corner of Tony's lips ticks up in a smile, and he's relieved that Steve can't see it with the way they're standing. He doesn't really want to rest, never has been one to take that particular piece of advice every alpha who's ever helped him through a heat has offered, but he hasn't been sleeping much lately, either. Heading into a heat with his energy levels already below a baseline is a one way ticket to disaster. "Good to know that some things never change," he mutters, tightening his grip around Steve's waist for half a second before he lets go entirely and steps back, out of Steve's arms, much as it pains him to do so.
When he does decide he should probably pay attention to the guy he knocked into, he has to put effort into biting back about five different comments that come to mind. All inappropriate, and all things he’d regret in the morning. “Sorry. About bumping into you. Someone shoved me and I lost balance and—” He cuts himself off, stops the rambling before it can really begin. “I’m Tony.” Steve smirks again, before taking Tony's hand and kissing the back of it gently. It's a bold move, and it's a little odd for this situation, sure, in the middle of a dancefloor, but he's nothing, if not committed to his craft. He leans in close to Tony, using the thumping bass as an excuse to get close and speak right into his ear.
“And I’d give up forever to touch you, ‘cause I know that you’d feel me somehow. You’re the closest to heaven that I’ll ever be, and I don’t want to go home, right now….”
For a few seconds, it feels like freefall, like he’s hurtling toward the earth, with nothing to stop him but the ground, but then all at once, it all slams home. In something like .5 seconds, Tony feels his reality bend and shatter at the point of max resistance. He’s laying out in the bed in front of him, lifeless and still, and Steve’s sitting heavily on the uncomfortable looking chair at the side of the bed. Just looking at Tony, like he’s a broken thing. Tony has to admit, from this angle, he kind of does.
Despite the first encounter that tony had had with another person in limbo (limbo-er? Limboite? There’s a nickname there somewhere.) wandering the halls of the hospital, is more than less quiet. He’s able to go through wards and rooms as he likes, get all the way up to the rooftop gardens, and all the way down to the boiler room. He’s intimately familiar now, with the supply closets, and he knows that a nurse named Martha, in radiology, is stealing printer toner. In mass amounts. At one point, he follows a couple out of the emergency room doors, and he steps onto the sidewalk, but something worries him. Something primal, and frightened, and base, tells him that he shouldn’t head that way. So he turns back around, and heads further into the maze of medical wonders.
"Alright, you wanna tell me and Barnes what you have to tell us now, or you wanna talk about it later?"
Steve knows a stronger man would argue. a more patient man would insist on getting to three fingers, but he isn't stronger, or more patient. He's weak and needy, and he can feel the wet spot on the front of his boxers growing, and he's pretty sure he's already half out of his mind with need. He leans back and hooks his thumbs into his boxers before dragging them off and tossing them into the floor.
He moves to walk down the hall, to see if he can’t locate the teen, but a flurry of movement causes him to look back through the window. The chief surgeon looks to be closing, finishing up with several thick sutures. But that’s not what interests him, not by a long shot. There, hidden amongst surgical blue gowns, and white gauze, is a small head of long black hair, stretched far out of the way, draped over the pillows. It can’t be, it really can’t, but that’s somehow the same girl tony had just seen no less than two minutes ago. For having an IQ of nearly 200, it takes him a lot longer to recognize what’s happening, than it should. So he’s not the only one in limbo, then. That’s… that’s definitely interesting.
Clint groans, and flops over in the bed, shoving the eighty pounds of fur and raw excitement off of him. “Alright, alright.” he grumbles. He can’t hear himself, but he knows based on raw feeling alone, the way his vocal chords resonate in his throat, that his voice must be scratchy. Has to mean either nightmares, or disuse. He muses. He prays to god it is, at least, because, medical conclusion or not, cold and flu season always makes him twitchy. Has done, since-- nope. Not going there. It’s too early for that kind of morbidity, and any more ruminating on his misery, and he’s likely to forget the point of actually getting up, at all.
comments are my lifeblood. tell me what you think. tell me I'm an asshole. Tell me about the spiders that live in your closet.
shame. Steve briefly considers taking him to his actual house, but he knows Bucky would string him up for all of the neighbors to see, if he did, so he sighs, and makes a split-second decision to take him to the apartment over the gallery. It was kind of his pet project, and honestly a fair bit more personal than he would usually want to get, but Tony's too intoxicating to turn down, and he's not about to pay for a hotel, because that screams 'sleeze’. He smiles winningly and winks, hitting the fob to unlock his Camaro, the low-key car, and holds the door open for Tony.
“Baby” he teases softly, over the rim of his hot chocolate. It still won’t replace a nice cup of coffee, but he’s not going to flaunt his ability to have caffeine in front of his seven month pregnant omega. “it’s one pup, how much stuff do we seriously need?” Tony fixes him with an unimpressed look, and Steve raises his placatingly.
Steve should agree. He should sigh, and drop his head into his hands, and let it go, make a smart decision for once in his miserable life, but he doesn’t
“Do you know how long he’s been sober?” she asks softly, and steve sighs. He can picture it clearly, thanks to the serum, the eidetic memory that’s both a blessing and a curse, the chip laying on the bookshelf in Tony’s penthouse apartment. He wasn’t supposed to see it, he’s sure, but then again it wasn’t hiding either. A black thing, with golden writing emblazoned on it, the inscription simple.
“I don’t owe you anything. You, or anyone else. New York still exists because of me. I’m the reason that it isn’t a red skull shaped hole in the ground, I’m done. Sir.”
"I like it," he says quietly, before he pulls away from Steve and heads a little further into the room. Despite a few of his initial fears about this being a set-up for a hit, the apartment definitely looks like it's lived in, and doesn't look unlike how Logan's decorated his section of the warehouse. Granted, there's a little more light in here, a combination of streetlights from outside and the lights from the apartment itself, but still. There's also a distinct lack of gym equipment, but, hey, Tony's not complaining about that. He turns around to face Steve again as he tugs his shirt up over his head, because it's reoccurred to him that they're both still wearing clothes and, really, that's a shame. There are enough scars littering his torso to make anyone wary, but he knows that most of his hook-ups don't really question it, and those that do get the honest truth about where a few of the scars came from - accidents in the workshop, an intern fucking something up in the chemistry lab and making the place ignite, general clumsiness. He smiles, hopes it doesn't look too self-conscious. "Bedroom?"
Whew! sorry about that, that was uh. a long sabbatical?? whatever, I'm taking it. but I'm back! thank you all for the kind comments and kudos it... it seriously means so much to me, that people actually care about my useless ramblings. thank you, thank you, thank you. <3
James is in bad mood. Or… he was, two hours ago. At this point, he’s descended into outright pissed off. Ever since the Incident-- as he’s taken to referring to this morning, inside his own head-- he’s been keeping a weather eye on the Hunt, a rival gang. Mob territory logic doesn’t exactly follow New York property logic, though, so irritatingly enough, their territory laces over a whole lot of Red Stars, so … there isn’t much hope of entirely irradicating them. It’s a game of observe, and deflect, for now. So… here he is. In his own goddamned bar-- though it’s one of the smaller ones, a bit of a pet project for Bucky--, watching from the shadows, waiting for one of the shittier small time drug dealers, and weapon pushers, to say something that gets him closer to the gang that seems to have popped up all around him. He’d bet dollars to donuts, that they have something to do with this drug that keeps popping up where he’d least expect it. Now, he just has to find the proof. What he isn’t expecting, in a million years,  to find, is the Hunts archer. Sitting at the bar, and nursing something dark, straight, like it’s personally offended him.
an impersonator?) at the other end of the room and turns back to Steve prime/impersonator, clearly not getting it. He opens his mouth to speak, and Steve prime smiles softly. Fondly. “you’re not dead.” Tony raises a single eyebrow, and now it’s his turn to cross his arms, disbelievingly.
“Still get the cold thing, huh?” Steve hums noncommittally. Bucky shakes his head, and sighs. “Steve. Do us both a favor, and text your husband, you sad sack.” Steve’s entire line of posture goes stiff, and he stares at Bucky, frozen. How does he know about the phone? He… he hadn’t told anyone about that, save for T’challa, and even then, it was only as a matter of security. Something of a question must show on his face, because Bucky just smirks in that infuriating way of his, and taps a fingertip to his temple. Steve huffs.
“it's just supposed to be family right now, the attending hasn't been in yet…” Steve smiles at her, prettily, softly, the kind of smile that’s supposed to make you trust someone.
He isn’t going to say they’ve been flirting over the last month, but he isn’t going to discount the idea either. There’s a thick, heavy silence that falls between them, as his brain scrambles through the last 30 days, twenty-three hours, twenty-seven minutes. The serum hives him the benefit of an eidetic memory, so picking apart every interaction they’ve had since Thanksgiving is easy. It’s probably only three or four seconds of oppressive silence, but to Steve it feels like a lifetime.
“alright, Mister… Carbonell?” Ed nods, and Famike blushes again, prettily. “well, your cousin’s safe with us.”
“Your guess is as good as mine, Barnes. He left early last night. With a brunette.” Bucky rolls his eyes, and drops his head to the mahogany bar top.
Steve shakes his head and rests his forehead against Tony's scooting close enough to eliminate most of the space between them, and wrapping an arm around him, holding him close. The feeling of knowing that his feelings are reciprocated, it's… remarkable. “you don't have to apologize. I should have given it to you. I should have tried harder to find you. Given you more time before I lost hope. Stayed… Stayed off smack when I did… “ a little wave of guilt washes over him briefly and it hurts, it hurts so /bad/, but he pushes through it, because it's worth it. “I know it's… Early. I know it is. But… I've never felt as connected to anyone as you, except Bucky.
"How long was I out for?" he asks when he can verbalize his thoughts, pushing up and forward to give Steve a gentle kiss. He remembers enough to know that Steve said something about having to do work, so he pulls away after a couple of seconds, lies back down on the bed. "Get your work done?"
“Fall back! Head back to base!” He commanded in what Tony and a few of the others had affectionately termed as his ‘Captain America Voice’. Confirmations were grunted into the coms, and Steve focused on getting back to the building; he wanted to get there first to clear out any of the undead that may be hanging around there before the wounded and exhausted others did.
Did he have his bad days? Yes, all the time, but now he could manage them better; at least, he was told he was by the important ones in his life and mental health doctors -
He would remember watching Captain America’s shield go flying, catching in the light as it knocked down several aliens in one blow.
was someone roughly grabbing hold of your Tsum, a very piece of you and your Soulmate’s Soul, and being forced to watch as they threatened to hurt it in no way a Tsum ever should be.
Not just as a bunny - though JARVIS had mentioned that small animals tended to do better with human contact and affection - but Tony loved being touched, no matter where and in what form; something Steve was more than willing to give since he loved cuddling Tony as much as Tony loved being cuddled. But here, as a small bunny that just snuggled happily into your arms whenever he was picked up and held?
Steve sighed (which, history says that’s bad-) but then he just... smiled, amused and fond. It was a very warm smile; Tony especially liked that it was pointed at him.
The world dissolved, and Steve felt that familiar tug in the back of his mind. Not fighting it, he learned it was just easier if he didn’t, he blinked open his eyes that he didn’t remember closing to the smiling, tired faces of the others.
If (when) Steve got someone amazing to cuddle with, laugh with, spend time with, then it was better to cut things now than deal with the heartbreak later.
What followed was a blur of fire lit - seriously, who lit the torches down there? - passageways built like a maze (“...Aren’t we going around in-” “Shut up, Sam”), booby traps galore including spike pits that some of them swung across with a rope Hank conveniently had on hand (“What? You never know when you need a rope”), and many, many failed attempts to grab random treasures that were just the pen-ultimate tropes of movies (“Clint, I swear, if you grab that red monkey I’m gonna-”).
He absently petted Helen’s head when she butted against his leg at the end of another circuit with a concerned noise.
And for the life of him, he couldn’t understand why, especially when Steve made it plenty clear that he enjoyed Tony’s company, too.
Tony relished it, and made his heart feel all sorts of warm and gooey; even more so than when Rhodey or Pepper did the same thing.
Sitting on a pedestal, with the light filtering through the cracks in the walls to perfectly light it up and everything - weren’t they underground, though? - was the Chalice. Above it, Tony zoomed in on the faded ancient writing; Jarvis automatically translated it to ‘Temple of Zumba’, which, weird, considering what the Chalice was for, but whatever.
“I think we should check, one more time. Just to be sure,” he said, smile not leaving even when Tony rolled his eyes good naturedly before leaning up on his tiptoes to give him another kiss.
Despite the yelling and fighting noises going on behind him - they would be fine, he was sure - he hummed along to AC/DC as he popped each coin into one of the slots.
Well, there wasn’t anything to it; he was here, he was committed, (mostly, anyways) and he knew without a doubt that if he chickened out Bucky would lock him in a closet with Tony, and that was definitely
For all of how true those words were and how sincerely they were said (by Captain America, because it was only right that someone as good as him would hate someone like Tony) Tony had learned long ago to never let them see your reactions; they always did enjoy it when they saw you hurting.
For someone as tactile (and touch-starved, though only Rhodey said that… and Pepper… and Happy…) as Tony, he was over the moon, with even those small touches.
He glanced down at his Tsum, who was desperately cuddling against his side and refused to budge even when Tony prodded zir. Being as large as a medium sized dog now, the details on zir Captain America impression were uncanny.
When a few seconds went by, Steve shifted, licking his lips again, his nerves starting to get the better of him.
Either way, Tony knew the peace couldn’t have lasted, and sucked in a breath before doing what he did best: diving in head first.
And for all that he thought his younger years, living in that empty, lonely mansion under Howard’s thumb and nail was what hell was like, he’s never been more wrong.
Taking a moment to weigh the pros and cons, he mentally shrugged, grabbed the bag right from Sam’s hand - ignoring his indignant “Hey!” - and flew right over to the temple when all the guards’ had weren’t looking.
Thankfully it was a short flight to the bar, Tony easily maneuvering them through the largest hole in the roof to the room below. The reason the team had chosen it as their base, after all, was that it was both one of the more intact buildings left with four walls, making it also one of the most defensible.
