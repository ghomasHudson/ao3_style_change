Those perfectly painted on lips were pressed to Steve’s for a moment, and Tony beamed his usual smile.
Chatter filled his ears, and though much of it was French (to be expected), there was a good number of men cheering and chatting away in bright American accents.
He looked downright angelic, Tony thought.
Steve went quiet, though his expression didn’t change. The silence seemed almost thoughtful. Steve took a sip of his drink again, gaze falling to the glass when he swirled it. His response was puzzling at first, and Tony observed him for a moment more before correcting himself, raising his voice enough that those beside them could hear him.
But part of him is thinking about it like a high schooler might think about Valentine’s Day. Sure, it might hurt to break up the day before, but is it worse to milk him for all he’s got the day of and then royally fuck it all up the day after? Is it?
“No, you’re not.”
He’d give anything for Tony to feel warm.
And waited.
“Right.” Steve glanced down, pulling gently at the fabric of the pants. “Slim-fit, huh?”
Had he been less stubborn, perhaps he'd be allowed more freedom. That was one thing he admired about Tony, and it was one thing Tony did that frustrated the hell out of him.
“Just keep that up,” Steve said. “Keep it up, sweetheart, that’s good for me.”
To put it lightly, Tony was scandalized, offended on Steve’s behalf. “
“I think you and I are going to have a lovely time tonight, Grant.”

it was- a nice, familiar reread).
“Get off’a me, I need to find Netflix.” Steve unceremoniously set a hand on Tony’s side and gently shoved him back onto the couch, grinning at Tony’s small “oof.”
“Tell me where you’re going. I’ll meet you. I’ve got a plane, it’s private, I have— I have connections, I can travel.”
“Oh, yeah,” Tony agreed. “Feels like we should have done this a decade ago.”
, to say the least.”
Tony nodded. Uncertainly, Steve pulled the bin closer, sitting aside so Tony could do what he would with them.
“Oh, maybe a little bit,” Iron Man said. “If only because of his uniform.”
The responsibility, to some extent, fell onto him. He needed to make it right.
Steve sat up then, and Tony figured he deserved a look up and down the muscles of the guy’s back— what little of it he could see, at least, but even his silhouette against the window was a sight to behold. Steve reached for the tug-switch on the bedside lamp first, Tony watching the movement curiously, only glancing down for a moment to catch the time— 5:34 AM. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve was slipping out of bed, getting down on his knees and reaching underneath the mattress.
Tony would say, though it might sound like a bold-faced lie; his security’s not exactly lax, and the gun is hardly the first thing he’d reach for when the suit’s so close by.
“You know what? I think I do.”
Maybe it didn't have to be. Maybe it wasn't worth it.
Steve would say anyway, because what’s the alternative? What else would he think? Tony hasn’t given him any reason to think otherwise, has he?
It would be over soon, though, wouldn't it? It'd be over. He'd wake up alone in his room again, and he'd be able to remember that red more clearly than ever, and maybe he'd remember Tony better, too.
Tony stared, searching for anything in Steve’s expression that would indicate why, exactly, he felt the need to— but it was too much to expect from an expression, as guilt, shame, fear, awkwardness… they all looked the same sometimes.
“Which ones?” Tony asked before pausing, blinking in what looked like surprise at the words that had come out of his mouth. Nat turned to meet his eyes, the corners of her mouth forced still to keep her smile at bay.
Marshall took a seat, angling his body toward Steve. His legs spread ever so slightly. “Big fan of the tie.”
He’d heard plenty of accounts of people who felt as if the years became shorter with time. They weren’t unimportant people by any means. In fact, it seemed perfectly
Steve met Tony’s eyes, huffed indignantly, and then turned his attention back to the screen. Tony was content to settle against him and chomp some popcorn for a bit. It wouldn’t take Steve long to find the movie.
“That’s sweet, Tony, but the United States Army doesn’t really pick its soldiers based on sex appeal.”
He couldn’t name them any longer. Some of them, he couldn’t place. He didn’t know whether he’d read them months ago or decades ago, and it was as funny as it was sad. He remembered one about a bird old enough to be wearing one of those big-hipped dresses with the corset top, somewhere in Maine away from the stresses of the real world. He remembered she was in a lighthouse or a cabin or something or another on the beach, and her husband was with her, drawing the blinds every night and opening them up every morning before she woke to make sure her first sight every day was of the water.
He closed his hands around one of the smaller sketchbooks, flipping loosely through the pages. Gail was an ever-present theme, though never young like Steve knew her before. She had wrinkles around her eyes and draped along her neck, laugh and smile lines prominent. Her hands were long and elegant even in age— maybe even more so— and her hair, lightly shaded, was styled beautifully, flyaways framing her forehead and livening up her image. Bucky was in the sketches, too, though young in some of them, and handsome as Tony had known him to be from the photos.
Tony rested his hands on Steve's shoulders, lightly feeling down the sides of his arms. He stopped at the bandages and glanced up at Steve with a quirked brow. Steve was sure Tony wasn't assuming much; he'd been held captive, after all, and it wasn't like that was the worst of his injuries.
Tony Stark said things like that.
“Well,” Steve responded. It was then that his eyes landed on the wounds on Tony’s neck- the wounds that were a part of his costume- and he had the thought he could have had the night prior if only he hadn’t had his mind properly blown.
He can think his way out of just about anything. He’s gotten this far with that method, but something tells him it won’t work tonight. Maybe preserving his state of mind isn’t quite worth the effort anymore.
“Funny guy, huh?”
Steve would never admit it, but he’d read short stories about this, about amnesia. They were never the silly, so-deep-they-sounded-pretentious kind of stories, nor were they the young and frilly kinds of stories that children picked up to cry to before they knew how to feel proper. They were plain old stories, ones that might be hung up in a classroom or slipped in between two pages of the Bible if someone felt a particular kind of way about them.
“Well, all you’re doing is trying to dress him up to go hang out in some impressionist lesbian garden painting.”
, is wrong. But he’s nothing if not brutally honest with himself.
There would be no answer. There never is an answer. There won’t be, and he’s counting on that, hoping that the silence and nothingness to come will house him well.
Steve thought to himself.
“Oh, maybe. Probably not on such short notice, though.”
“Does that seem comfy, Cap?” Jan asked. “In your wheelhouse?”
That was all Tony needed to repeat the movement, inching down further and further with each passing second. Before Steve was too deep inside of him for the movement to be rendered null, he swallowed around what he could; the answering jerk of Steve’s hips was praise enough for Tony, shocking and sudden as it was.
“I don’t think you know what a Freudian slip is. I don’t think you would have called it a Freudian slip if you knew what a Freudian slip was.”
“And destroying the blueprints,” Tony finished. “And the data. How’d they even
He always wondered how he never resented them, not even for a moment. And now he thinks he knows. He turned all of it inward.
“I didn’t. I wasn’t.”
Steve didn't have the strength to take much more, and as his body went white-hot, his vision went black.
Steve took a deep breath, about to turn to look for the
Windows were popping up and closing, plenty of them consoles and progress bars and files and… images. An album. An album full of images of tropical fish. If he’d had any doubts it was Tony controlling the thing, they were alleviated. The album closed out, but the work didn’t resume.
"Your eyes are so-- You're so gorgeous, Tony," Steve said, as if he were realizing it for the first time. He wasn't. Tony knew that much.
“Right, Tony,” Carol agreed, Steve turning his attention back to her. “But this building we’re looking at?  It’s in a populated area. My best guess is that the data’s accessible from multiple points, so the only thing we
“Well—  Your eyes.”
it happen, completely unknowing.
“It was the mission, Shellhead.” There was no severity to Steve’s tone, no harshness. Tony seemed concerned, and Steve couldn’t fault him for that.
“Right, yeah.”
“Coffee?” Tony asked.
reluctant to let Steve go. He’d felt something warm, something sweet, something
And if Tony thought there was anything funny about it, well, he’d forget the next day anyway. And he’d have the leftover muffins, or he’d have the blanket to nap in, and Steve could wipe his hands of it.
The room was modest enough, though not lacking in its amenities. It was small but neat; the bedsheets were folded crisply, and there were two floor-to-ceiling windows hugging the room’s corner. The curtains, pillows, and walls were bathed in a pleasant, calming tone of blue. It may have been the nicest place Steve had seen in months, if not longer.
Tony gasped, taking the bowl of popcorn out of Steve’s lap and setting it on the table. He swung a leg around Steve’s waist, half-straddling Steve’s lap enough to see him straight-on. He set one hand on either side of Steve’s face and squinted.
He'd forgotten the question. Blue was blue was blue;  it was the color of the navy blazer his father gifted him on his 14th birthday when he'd come home for Christmas. It was the color of the Jays he'd watch in the after-school birding club, and often the color of the pen he'd use to check those Jays off the list year after year after year. It was the color of the sky, the color of ties and pocket squares hung up in his closet, the color of sapphire cufflinks and curacao and fire, even, if you fixed it the right way.
He sticks the muzzle of the gun into his mouth unceremoniously, half-wondering if Bucky would be proud that he remembers all that talk about the
according to Tony. It did, indeed, have many pockets. Steve didn’t even have much use for so many.

“We don’t have the stuff for goin’ all the way.”

“Of course,” Steve answered. Tony lingered in the doorway for a moment more, and Steve added, “Come in.”
That was part of what he liked about traveling, even in uncertain times. There was an anonymity of sorts. People knew his name, certainly, and some even recognized his face, but the further he was from home, the more likely he was to be left alone. That was how he saw it, at least. It was entirely possible he was pestered just as much, and the unfamiliarity of every new city he visited lent itself to an exaggeration of the isolation he felt.
, their gazes lingered, moments longer than Tony thought was normal. Whether or not it was reality or just a figment of his imagination-- his brain longing to stretch those moments out into infinity-- he couldn't say for certain.
to get Steve out again, to just— to just get him to leave. And Steve would. He’d get up, he’d turn around, he’d walk away. And Tony, selfishly, would put that bullet in his head knowing damn well Steve would come right back in, knowing damn well that Steve would find his body, hold his body, cry over his body—
He watched Tony’s hand— slim, a little bony, with callouses on the tips of his fingers— trace over his own abdomen, down the line of his happy trail and along the inside his thigh. He spotted the funny little quirk in Tony’s brow when he examined his own skin, seemingly surprised at the lack of spend there.
Marshall.
“Oh, yeah. The old bastard gave me the full tour, just about.” Steve took the lead, reaching up to untie his bowtie and undo the top button of his shirt while they walked. All at once, he could breathe again. “You know, I would’ve gotten it done.”
“Steve. Honey. Light of my life.”
Not fair.
“I suppose I take back what I said about your uniform, then.”
“I don’t think that’s what they meant,” Tony said. After a moment of consideration, he remedied that: “Actually, no, I think you might be on the right track.”
Steve raised his head from the skin he’d been loving on, gently touching his nose to Tony’s. He stayed like that— close— for a long, quiet moment, and Tony wondered whether he’d spoken at all or just imagined what it might be like if he did.
Nat made a face at that, something in between
“I could tonight.” It was a tad bit more teasing than Tony intended for it to come out, but in all fairness, there was hardly any other way it could have been received. Steve seemed to enjoy the small display of attitude, though, and if ever Tony were to be egged on by something, it would be that funny little smile of Steve’s.
“I made reservations at the usual place.”
He tried to control as much as he could; he imposed a strict routine on himself, though he had no way of accurately measuring how much time had passed during each stage of it. It wasn't the most consistent in these terms, but if nothing else, there was a clear and repetitive to-do list he could follow every time he reoriented himself after waking up in the cell again.
“This is our guy,” Carol said, gesturing to the image on the projector. It was of an angular looking man with dull grey eyes and brown hair slicked back and to the sides. He donned a beige suit and a copper tie; Steve, thinking there was something a bit off about the color combination, glanced to Tony to gauge the reaction of a man more fashion inclined than himself. Tony’s expression was inscrutable, eyes fixed on the man on the screen.
“I’m sure. C’mon, you gonna dance with him?”
He figured he’d been dehumanized plenty enough to be desensitized to it, but objectification was a hell of a thing.
Steve paused, gave him an incredulous look, and looked back at the screen once more.
Tony shrugged. He rested his hand on the table where his phone lay, running his thumb over the volume buttons as he spoke: “Something tells me the personality flaws don’t end with the tie.” It was a casual enough quip that it almost went in one ear and out the other for Steve, his gaze fixed on the small movements of Tony’s finger, on his long, slender fingers and small electrical burns on the side of his hand.
It was then that a rustling came from the ceiling. A cover was popped off of the large, industrial-sized ventilation tubes (a design choice, Steve had learned from Marshall’s ramblings). A hand grabbed it before it could fall to the floor, and Nat descended down from the vent gracefully. She set the cover down against the floor, careful not to let it clang, and held her arm out with her palm outstretched.
Tony envied him. Tony
He was laying in bed with that god-awful pillow hugged to his chest as he tried to fall asleep- the last step of his "daily" routine- when one of those blindingly white walls collapsed violently in on itself to reveal a vibrant array of colors Steve hadn't seen in ages. There were blues and purples. There were oranges and yellows, and Steve hadn't even
It was a childish way of viewing it, perhaps, but he couldn’t help himself; what did he want, if not someone to hold and to hold him? What did he want, truly? He would have liked to be a do-gooder, but there was no identity in that. There was nothing but the right thing— no Tony Stark, no nights of blissful romance, no indulgence nor fulfillment. The
Steve hadn't even seen those in the longest time. He'd been deprived of them as well-- and that was a funny thought, describing himself as
“Steve,” Tony responded. He stopped fidgeting, stopped looking, and- very realistically- he might have even stopped thinking, because Steve couldn’t have imagined a contemplative and serious Tony saying the words he’d said next. “Would you like to come to bed with me?”
How long had it really been?
He wasn’t sure he belonged to himself anymore, not in any capacity. He could have moments alone, certainly, and he fostered friendships and relationships and hobbies as much as anyone else did, but his body belonged to someone else. His loyalty lay somewhere other than within.
“Y’sure you want another one of these?” Steve asked. “We can chat regardless. No entry fee for conversation.”
“What’re you doing?” Tony asked, turning tiredly onto his side as he watched Steve with a dazed expression.
It was hard to feel human, sometimes, when people didn’t want to look at you that way. All they saw were the tubes, the bandages, the monitors.
He woke up in that same white room. It must not have been long after the incident, as his back still felt raw as anything and he could barely move without wincing. He pushed himself into a seated position and stared at the floor. Would it be worth it to go through the routine, then? Would it hurt more than it would help?
It was a beautiful sentiment from a beautiful man. Truth be told, though, Steve didn’t think it was possible to make up for lost time. He didn’t think he’d ever have enough time with Tony; the guy was on his mind constantly, taking up space in every corner of his mind, even when the world was at its end. They could spend the rest of their lives together and Steve would still want more, would still hope and pray that they’d meet again after that.
Tony blinked again, eyes fixated on Steve’s face, his arms, his head, his chest, his-- well, his everything.
“I can take you all the way, I think.”
for the first time in years, really, and the thought of losing it to shaky concepts like duty and loyalty was agonizing.
He thought of his mother, and how he couldn't quite picture her face, either, and how he couldn't remember whether her eyes were blue or green or grey. And he thought maybe Tony's eyes were green, and they'd been green all along, and Steve had just convinced himself they weren't. It was strange-- he used to be so certain, so able to sketch Tony's face out perfectly by memory alone.
it, though, Tony?”
“These are for more than just sex, you know. And don’t you think this would be emptier if I were getting laid that often?” Steve asked, brow raised. His serious tone betrayed the amused quirk of his lips. He took one of the condoms from its place in the tin with a light tug, flipping the container shut once more.
"Six months," Tony replied, pulling away from Steve just enough to get a good look at him. He rested his hand on the side of Steve's face, pressing a soft kiss to his lips. "But that's- That's alright. You don't have to worry about that. We don't have to worry about that right now."
Steve gave a firm nod. “Tony Stark,” he repeated, and Tony's heart melted. “Kiss for the road?”
"You need to check in with med."
he thought, alongside a million other, more pressing thoughts.
Steve laughed, rolling the condom idly between his fingers. He seemed to be in no rush to get to the main event; his
Right?
He ran a soft hand over Steve’s chest, pressing a kiss to his cheek in between bites of popcorn. Steve didn’t respond, not even with a grunt or a hum. It wasn’t terribly out of character, but it wasn’t the
He pulled Steve into another tight hug, pressing his face into the crook of Steve's neck as he suppressed his shaky breath.
He just… looked. Admired Tony’s features. Watched as he blinked and licked his lips and rolled his shoulders back. It wasn’t much, but given the lost souls Tony tended to pick up when he was seeking out bed partners, it was more than he was expecting.
He didn’t have to wait long.
Blue wasn't just blue; curiosity wasn't just curiosity. Not always.
he would have said at 8, at 10, at 13-- he may have said it more quietly with each passing year, but if nothing else, it would have crossed his mind. He was ever the pedant, at times to a fault, but a pedant with the brain of a child was often little more than a tiny person saying "Gotcha!" every so often, convinced they'd picked something apart when they had far more to learn.
He can’t do it.
“He’s gay, Tony.”
“You got the thingy, right?” Tony asked, shaking Steve from the almost hypnotic trance of the place.
Steve remembered thinking to himself.
“I draw,” Steve said that morning, backlit by the bright-dark blue of night seeping in from the window. It was quiet, and the movement of Steve’s lips was only just visible enough for Tony to know he’d spoken at all.
It was then that Tony entered, strange as usual. Steve felt he properly embodied the “eccentric billionaire” archetype, with a dash of “mad scientist.” His hair stuck up in funny ways during the day as if he’d just woken up, and that may have been the case; his sleep schedule certainly wasn’t aligned with that of any other human Steve had met before. He was the owner of his company, though, and that must have meant he could set whatever schedule he desired. He could nap at any and all hours of the day, leaving the night for his work and his tinkering (which Steve could hear quite clearly from his bedroom, as he himself was an enhanced individual, a werewolf born of experimentation, and the walls hadn’t been soundproofed).
“Aw, shucks.”
“What’s this?”
“How far’s the room?”
"... Steve?"
“It lets me access some… dangerous technology. It’s a part of me. If anyone else gets ahold of it, if anyone else tries to get this— this thing, and use it themselves, it’ll—”
is the weapon itself. And my fear, honestly, is—”
if his legs couldn’t even support the weight of some guy, but he wanted to be gentle anyway. He spread his legs, straddled Steve’s thighs, and leaned forward, resting his face against Steve’s shoulder.
Whether he liked it or not, he wasn’t Captain America.
“I heard you walking.” Iron Man shrugged, taking a step forward to stand beside Steve. He crossed his arms, and the helmet tilted ever so slightly upward; even in the dimly lit room in the middle of night, he could make out those ice blue eyes of Iron Man’s, focused on the image Steve had been looking at moments prior. “I figured I would keep you company.”
Tony let out a short, huffy laugh of disbelief. God, Steve missed his laugh so much. How could he not have thought about Tony's laugh?
“Right,” Steve agreed proudly. “And now, just in case he’s forgotten what that call is… Let’s hear it one more time.”
Steve sat up a little straighter, reaching out for Tony’s hand. He took hold of Tony’s wrist, thumb running along his skin in what might have been an attempt at a soothing touch. When Tony met his eyes again, Steve looked almost guilty.
He abstained from the fourth.
Tony stared, skepticism clear in his gaze, and stood. “Alright, then.”
He repeated the action, harder.
“I’m not really allowed to—”
“Sleep around. Don’t you? Got some belles on call where you’re from, Steve?”
To think that Tony Stark
It was a running joke for them.
of you know what a leather daddy is supposed to look like.”
Steve’s expression was hard to read, then. Tony almost felt like he was talking to an old friend, or— god forbid he let his mind wander— a plain old boyfriend. Steve showed no signs of awkwardness. He wasn’t acting as if this was strange or new or anything of the sort. He looked, to put it simply, like he wanted to be there. He looked like he was content just to be around.
“Here,” he said, grabbing a creme dress shirt and a dark brown, almost black, pair of dress pants. He set those on the bed beside Steve, stepping away one more time to reach into Jan’s accessory bin. Out came a pair of leather suspenders, coupled with a bowtie.
Tony corrected himself, not knowing quite where Steve’s head was at. He’d probably never know. Whatever this was, it felt casual and normal and
“Tony, I’ve been with the man you’ve been with, and I don’t mean to hurt your feelings when I say this, but I don’t think
Hell, he couldn’t even wait for Steve to be out the door before letting the shame set in. They hadn’t even
“No,” Steve answered. “Feel free.”
He realized what it was they were trying to do. He was certain, at least in the beginning, that it wouldn't affect him so much. He'd been through worse, hadn't he?
Needless to say, it was uncomfortable. Tony found himself sucking in a breath, jutting his chin out— anything to hide the undesirable bits of him he thought Steve might catch sight of.

“Oh, no. By the time I’m done, Winghead, you’ll
“Well, not as much of one, but.”
Tony quirked a brow, huffing out an awkward laugh. He shrugged as he idly fidgeted with his thermos. “Maybe someone’s on their period,” he said, after a moment. It was clearly intended to be a joke, but that seemed as good an explanation as any. It wasn’t like Steve could gauge details well at all, especially not from such a short moment of… possibly invasive sniffing.
“You got an army kink, Tony?” Steve asked. He watched, a pleased crinkle around his eyes as Tony fidgeted with the thin pieces of metal.

for them to come to life, and he’d be greeted with paper corpses.
"Can I see?" Tony asked.
Tony answered, “I’m meeting a partner.”
That was answer enough.

One of them had passed out already, he heard. RB2-B. The treatment was ineffective. The other two were responding as expected, he heard.
And there were more important things to take care of first. Things he couldn’t get out of his mind.
Marshall’s home was about what Steve would expect from a man like him. It was both sparsely decorated and excessive, the few pieces he
And then, it seemed, pieces fell into place for Tony almost as much as they did for Steve.
Would it be a win for them if he gave this up, too? Would it be a loss for himself?
The date went well. It went
The longer he was gone, though, the harder it was to worry. He felt so separate from his family, then. Sometimes, he felt as if he didn't exist at all.
No one was supposed to know Tony was here. Housekeeping was the only thing that made sense.
“I’m sorry?”
“I know
“I thought the note was supposed to be the goodbye.”  Tony took a seat beside Steve, bringing his knees up onto the mattress and leaning over to get a peek at the bag.
Steve huffed out a soft laugh, less humored than fond. “Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.”
“Y’could be a model in real life,” Steve said, taking the book and checking over the page himself. He gave a ‘tsk’,  opening the top drawer of his nightstand and nabbing a black pencil out of it to make a correction to Tony’s hairline. He fixed the mistake that Tony hadn’t noticed and, seemingly satisfied, set the pencil down on the carpet beside them.
“Ehh,” Carol responded. “He’s kind of got a type.”
“I was just thinking. I read that book by Wells all that time ago— oh, I can’t remember the name of it now…”
It didn’t matter, did it?
“Haven’t been since 1926, Shellhead,” he answered, bringing a hand up to wipe across his mouth to hide that he was speaking.

Assertive and, yes, a little bit funny.
“Is what alright?”
Steve pulled away from him, guiltily reaching down to tug the shirt off himself.

"I take it you're all willing to take this on without us?" Tony asked, turning his head to face the team behind them.
Tony undid Steve’s robe, and Steve thought to himself in a rather silly way:
Tony raised a brow but complied, peeling himself away from Steve’s side to sit where instructed. He leaned back and rose a knee to hold, just to have something to do with his hands. Steve picked his pencil up again, flipping through a handful of books before finding one with some blank space in it. He leaned against the wall opposite Tony, set the sketchbook in his lap, and got to doodling. Every so often, his eyes flitted up to Tony, taking in the sight of him fully.
much, according to the menu?
He didn't know. In that moment, he really didn't know. Was it worth it? Was he going back on everything he'd said and everything he'd fought for for so long, just by laying there on that table after months or years or decades (not decades, of course not decades, but he was so tired and so separate from himself and so disconnected from reality that he'd believe it if you told him it was true)?
he thinks sardonically at the revelation.
Steve seemingly blinked back to life at the call, though he was anything but lively. He shifted his shoulders uncomfortably, his movements tense and jerky.
“You paint,” Tony repeated, and he felt dumb as he did.
All together, they were a tank with mismatched wheels and chipped paint. No, not a tank- not a weapon- but a shield. A suit of armor. They were better together.
on his shoulder with his large thumb. “Never did trust a guy who takes side-bets on a chess game.”
He took a deep breath, handing the book back to Tony.
They had a sweet few minutes together, tangled together like that- like one being- and then Tony slipped off of Steve, retreating to the bathroom to prepare for bed.
Tony just had to check.
,” Steve starts, and it dawns upon Tony that he started talking at some point in the middle of all that thinking. He’s not sure what he said. He’s certain, though, that nothing of it was as eloquent at loud as it had been in his head. It never is. Steve doesn’t seem to mind. “Look at me, c’mere.”
“Well,” Tony started, tilting his head down and slowly urging Steve’s cock into his mouth. It was a tease then and nothing more, Tony bobbing his head slowly, using the leverage of one flat palm against the bed to control the rise and fall of his torso. He heard the distant, quiet
normal for him— he usually made the effort to at least
kiss Tony and leave something missing between them. He’d already crossed the line from friendship into more; what was holding him back from pushing further was unclear.
So, he stopped fighting.
He heard the word "sterilization" next, and after that came searing pain. It was a careless but generous splash of- of something hot and cold and sharp and awful, and it reeked of alcohol, and Steve couldn't-- God, he couldn't-- He could--
“I mean— You told Tony to let me finish out the mission?” Steve opened the door to the computer room, holding it as Nat slipped inside. She took a seat at the desk, plugged the thingy in, and waited.
Tony had half the mind to start forming some kind of apology, but Steve continued speaking.
Tony’s chest tightened. It was a feeling wholly disconnected from desire— in fact, if he gave himself a moment to think, he might have come to the conclusion that it was the opposite. Steve was warm, bright like the sun, and far too pure in his tenderness to touch someone like Tony— it hadn’t occurred to Tony until he saw Steve bathed in that heavenly glow. Under the dim lights of the bar, with Steve hunched over his drink and barely turning to look, Tony could have convinced himself he was worth a night with this man. He

"Your eyes."
Tony was a busy man, busy like anyone.
"How long has it been?" he asked, and the sound of his voice shocked him and Tony both. It was raspier than normal, and his tone was less steady. He supposed it wasn't too much of an issue; he'd figure it out again, wouldn't he? It was natural enough. He just needed time.
“Y’can flip through,” Steve said.
“Yeah.”
“You’ve never aspired to do anything more than this? You never wanted the wife, the kids, the white picket fence?”
“Oh, sure,” Steve replied. He was getting to the point where he would have taken one anyway. It was nice to have company.
At that point in his life, he was so much angrier. He was so much more frustrated. He was so obsessed with this idea of righteousness and human freedom, this idealistic version of it he'd seen stripped away from so many who were helpless to allow the abuse, and he concluded: never.
“So, this weapon,” Carol started. “It’s called the Avenger-Killer.”
And Tony thought to himself one night, as he lay in bed with the vision of Steve's irises practically painted on the insides of his eyelids, if there was any meaningful difference between eyes that were blue because they were made to be and eyes that were blue because they simply couldn't be anything else.
But he couldn’t ask Steve to stay. He couldn’t. This meant something to him, more than Tony ever could, and he’d be selfish to do anything but let Steve walk away.
He’d always enjoyed the sensation. It was intimate, certainly, and vulnerable in a way that made Tony feel laid out bare. It wasn’t the most dominant thing in the world— not the way he did it, at least, with the intent of being more delicate, more gentle— but he still had some semblance of control. He could
Tony met his eyes, fidgeting once more with his cup. He held his gaze, and Steve was overwhelmed, wondering what Tony might be thinking, thinking of Tony in kind, and there they were as they were always intended to be.
"Steve." Tony’s insistence was weak; he didn’t seem particularly vehement about going against Steve’s wishes, and whether it was for Steve’s sake or his own, Steve couldn’t tell. If the circumstances were different, he might have been stricter, but. They were both tired. They both clearly missed each other.
Tony, more often than not, wore the armor to meetings like this. Regardless of whether he was going to actively participate in the missions discussed or not, he treated the armor like a uniform. The suit was for Tony Stark. The armor was for Iron Man. Though Steve couldn’t quite tell the difference— both were plain old Shellhead in his mind— he supposed he could empathize to some extent. He always felt more
He'd been a stubborn man his whole life. It took a long while for him to even recognize that he experienced that grit to such an extreme degree; he spent his whole childhood surrounded by it, after all. His father fought to be seen and obeyed. His mother fought to live. When he was a young man, Bucky fought with the same vigor he did (because of him, maybe), and it was only after Bucky's death that Steve had asked the question:
Maybe it was a miscommunication. Tony was prone to miscommunications. Maybe he’d gone to the wrong bar. Maybe he’d gotten the time and date wrong.
“Could we split the difference?” Steve finally asked. It was reluctant, but he’d been reluctant going into this, anyway. All he wanted then was for the mission to run smoothly.
This piece, larger than the others and less neatly done, was of an interesting-looking man with a smart grin on his face. The lines were sloppier, less clear, as if erased and re-done. The shadows seemed either poorly thought out or far too meticulously placed, facing multiple different directions and faded at the edges. The man’s skin was smudged, some of the hatching lost to touch, and his jawline didn’t sit quite right atop his neck. If Tony had to guess, he’d say this was one of Steve’s first drawings, or something he’d done after a bad fight. Technically, it wasn’t the most sound— until Tony’s gaze landed on the eyes and focused there, an uncomfortable feeling of familiarity settling in.
Tony stood, too— no matter how reluctant Steve was to leave, Tony knew he was
of unwilling experimentation, but his weeks or months or years of captivity had certainly done funnier things to him.
Tony raised a brow, studying the half of Steve’s face he could see from beside him.
There must have been something.
so). There were often tubes involved- many, many tubes, some filled with clear liquids and some moving blood and some colorful and vibrant and almost hues that Steve might even consider pretty under different circumstances.
Almost, at least. Because there’s always an almost.
“No.” Steve interrupted all too quickly. Tony had half the mind to push, but Steve elaborated without prompting. “I volunteered. Tried to join the fight plenty of times, but— I mean, you see me.”
“Yeah,” Steve answered. “See you when the sun’s up.”
Tony shifted in his seat, his finger idly tracing around the edge of his glass. Well, he’d intended to meet a friend, didn’t he? This wasn’t quite what he had in mind, but it’d do.
And it was.
thing often removed him from himself entirely. But, oh, how grounding it was to be loved, to look in the mirror and see more than an asset.
Tony Stark’s voice followed two muted knocks on the doorway of Steve’s bedroom. Steve, sitting quite contentedly at his desk, raised his head from the book he’d been reading (
“You’re getting water,” he said, glancing back to find Tony staring almost blankly back at him. They stayed like that for a long moment, long enough for Steve to wonder if Tony was any closer to remembering his name this morning than he was the morning prior.
If nothing else, Steve won’t find his body.

Rustling came from the comms, then. There was an awkward little

“Do you want to take a break?” Tony asked, meeting Steve’s gaze once again.
And he and Carol were the support, and potentially the brute force. The “if anyone notices us, we’re going to need you” guys. Tony’s stealth armor was tanky, but it wasn’t the strongest. Jan was plenty evasive (and strong, physically, with her suit), but crowd control wasn’t her forte. Nat was well armed and well-strategized, but even she couldn’t get five people out of a facility of armed guards. She’d gotten herself accustomed to team plays, and with that came some amount of dependency.
All Steve heard then was the soft ‘click’ of the comm, and then nothing.
nonsense he'd dismissed before. He'd always appreciated the thought behind it, the nuance behind it, the
It was an
Tony paused. He sank back into his chair, though his posture was anything but relaxed. He met Steve’s eyes-
He'd dreamt of a rescue, and yet, at some point, it began to slip from his mind. It wasn't like he thought they'd given up on him; he'd just felt so isolated, so far away from them. Some days (he thought they were days, at least, but again, he could hardly tell), he was more in the past than in the future, focused more on the memories of his loved ones than the reality that he'd see them again someday.
“Business partner.” It was a half-truth. The man was, in fact, a business partner— a business partner he happened to be fucking on the regular. He’d figured it was more than that at one point, but after the multiple instances of being stood up (and after going through all the trouble to get there, no less), he wasn’t quite as sure.
Or was it little more than a promise of distraction, an offer that would pull Tony a few feet farther from the icy chill antagonizing him only to throw him back to the cold when they were done?
To lose.
“I thought I told you.”
That wasn’t quite the case at team events, though.
Tony casts a final glance at the door, takes a deep breath, and—
, then. It was really, truly safe, and not just in theory anymore. There was no need to sit by and hope desperately for someone like Captain America to save him, to pick him up when he fell. Not when Steve
It was a different kind of
But as years passed for him, life seemed to stretch into infinity. At times, it came as a comfort; he could, at the very least, give himself grace for not yet finding that love he so desperately desired. At times, it was the opposite— a cruel reminder that there would be more days just like this one.
“You’re just…” Glancing down thoughtfully at the checkerboard dance floor, Tony allowed his words to trail off into nothing.
“Whoa, whoa. Slow down there, cowboy.”
"Steve," he breathed out, voice soft and desperate, and everything Steve had been imagining.
Iron Man gave an amused little laugh, shaking his head. Steve playfully punched his metal shoulder.
The laughs and hollers became little more than a murmur once they’d exited the ballroom. It was a pleasant sort of thing to experience, almost akin to a lively child snoring softly on your lap or a unit of soldiers all far from the atrocities of war for a short while, laying together under the stars while a fire crackled beside them.
“… What just happened?”
Steve something, actively. He could look up, see how blown Steve’s pupils were and how red the pale skin of his cheeks had become, and he could know that
“Uh, I’ve got access,” Tony said. “Gimme just a minute and I’ll set that timer.”
“I see you’re not hanging around your buddies over there,” Tony said. It was hardly an astute observation, serving more as a subtle inquiry than anything. Tony watched the way Steve’s shoulders hiked up a little more at the mention of the other soldiers, the way he turned his head down again, as if remembering to keep himself in check. Tony regretted opening his mouth— there was no reason to be pushy.
Again, he asked the question:
Steve corrected himself, though he was in too deep to ignore it completely.
“And you forgot?”
It’s almost thrilling, to be so careless. It reminds him of his youth— of the youth he saw in his youth, at least, as he was rarely more than a spectator to the antics of others. But every so often, he’d be roped into something  reckless, something dangerous, and he’d feel the same bittersweet thrill that came with violent risk taking at any cost.
“Hey, don’t get things twisted. I don’t need another guy to— Alright, sure, laugh it up.”
“You need anything?” he asked, voice ever so slightly hoarse from the night.
Carol was shining, the star at the center of her chest such a perfect contrast to the red and blue of her suit, and even beside her, the brilliant patterns of Jan's wings and uniform stood out well.
The place was quirky in a homely way. It was cluttered in an organized manner, every mismatched painting beside the others in a melted asymmetrical grid on the walls. Eclectic suits of armor that would never have encountered the others in life stood opposite each other in hallways, some occupying corners as well. There was no way to escape the feeling of being watched in the public areas of the mansion as a result, but Steve found he didn’t mind it so much. It was nice to be looked out for. Perhaps he’d imbued the mansion with its own personality long ago, something caring and lovely, and found himself comfortable being enveloped in its warmth.
It wasn’t for lack of trying. He’d spoken to the doctors on the phone. He’d sat in the middle of the library in too-small chairs with maybe-outdated books on the tables in front of him, opened up to whatever page the index said lined up with “head” or “brain” or “amnesia” or “cancer” or sometimes things like dessert recipes and knitting patterns at the ends of the days when he’d resigned himself to a life of not quite
He saw his own face reflected back at him. No Tony to block the view.
“I think we might be past that.”
to suck your
“I have to head back soon,” answered Steve.
“That’s the only reason?” he asked. His tone was a little quiet, a little sly— it was intended to be a joke, but Steve didn’t seem certain he could take it that way, if the stiffening of his shoulders was any indication.
They were about 90% of the way to a plan, and with days to go, Steve figured they’d meet briefly each day to discuss, prepare, and put forth beginning steps. They’d done all the heavy lifting already, and Steve figured they had a good amount of free time given the circumstances. Sure, he had mission reports to do, and ordinarily, he’d have gotten them typed up and submitted the second he’d gotten home, but it wasn’t like his memory would fail him anytime soon. There was still time.
He got up. He dropped to the cold floor (which felt like marble, but without the marbling, and he wasn't quite sure if that was a separate thing or not, but he certainly was planning on taking a few minutes out of his day to think about it) and began to count his push-ups, slowing them down enough to draw out the amount of time he could fill up with this without fucking up his pre-set conditions. He was at 74 when he saw a hint of fog slipping down from above out of the corner of his eye, and by the time he'd hit 86, his vision had begun to blur. He collapsed to the floor before 90.
Steve huffed again.
Steve thought, and he thought everyone thought the same when they looked at Tony, whose skin was clear and fair and soft. His cheekbones were sunken in a way that would befit a corpse, though he somehow managed to look the most lively out of anyone on the team. His eyes were light (almost white), his gaze piercing, and his lips were red in a way that looked both natural and painted on, as if he were a work of art walking alongside all the average Joe’s in the world.
! Only a genius could put together something like that. And a genius he is.”
clearly proved that.
Rather than spend his time tossing and turning in bed, he decided to wander the mansion, figuring some newfound appreciation for the home he’d missed briefly couldn’t hurt. He roamed the halls, stopping every so often to sketch a particularly nice looking painting or furniture arrangement in his little pocket notebook.
“Right,” Tony agreed. “Uh, no, this is fine. This is great.”
Oh, that was beautiful. Wasn't it? Red, like Tony's robes and his lingerie, and his sheets, and the paintings on his walls. Red like Tony's suit, and red like Tony's throw pillows, and red like the bouquets of roses Steve bought for Tony every anniversary they had. It was red like the silk tie Tony wore to most public events, and red like the gemstone on Tony's engagement ring, and it had been so long since Steve had seen that gorgeous, gorgeous color that for just a moment, the threat of tears was more pressing than the threat of pain.
against Tony’s thigh. “You’re a handsome guy.”
“What d’you want, here?” Tony asked, eagerly mouthing at the side of Steve’s dick.
“I’d hate to faux-widow you.”
He woke up. He worked out. He ate- rice first, then eggs, then cauliflower. He was sure the meals must have been modified in some way, if only because he didn't think they'd risk damaging him to the point where he was no longer viable to participate (unwillingly) in their experiments. Regardless, they were unfulfilling in any way that mattered. After he'd eaten, he'd pace, and then he'd work out again (100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, warm-ups and cool-downs and stretches and whatever the fuck else he could think to add to the list). Once he'd finished all of that, he'd lay back down, and he'd try to picture Tony's face again- he'd try to picture the whole team, in fact, and he'd try to picture his mother, and he tried to picture his and Tony's penthouse, and he tried--
“Having a late night wander, Winghead?” a voice greeted from behind him— Iron Man’s, it was clear. There was no world in which Steve wouldn’t recognize those words, that tone.
Bucky might say.
he'd gotten there).
Tony’s hand rested on Steve’s chest, softly tracing around the base of the disc.
Except, it wasn't over.
“I just want to be realistic about things,” Steve said, then. “I’m not— Look, I’m at the front lines. I’m in this big, garish suit. And you’ve seen me, you know how I’m… not exactly built for war, Tony. Dying in battle, dying for my country, it’s really the only thing I can plan for. It’ll be the best thing I can do, for you and for me.”
“I was thinking,” Steve said again, “of how much he reminds me of that Time Traveller sometimes. He was all I could think about while we were back in France—
He’ll cry again. He can feel it, the tension and painful burn behind his eyes. He’ll cry again tonight. And Steve will be there, like he is now. It’s not much, but. It’s enough, he thinks. Not to keep him happy, not to fix him, not to make things much better.
"What?"
“Oooh,” Tony started. “I see now.”
Steve stepped up onto Tony's boots, wrapping his unbandaged arm around Tony's neck to keep himself secure. Tony held him tight with one arm just in case- or maybe for his own sake, which Steve couldn't blame him for in the slightest- and the faceplate dropped.
it, a life of maybe
Steve reached up, slipping his thumbs into the loops of the dress pants. It made him feel a little taller, made him stand a little straighter. He didn’t have much going for him, here, but at least he had that.
They were set to meet at 8 in the evening, in a secured hotel room just a 15 minute walk from the target location. Steve arrived at 7:45, and when he entered the hotel room, he’d found that Tony and Jan had already been there for quite some time. There were filled clothing racks along the room’s walls, shirts and pants ranging from modest black pieces to what Steve could only assume was some kind of 60’s or… 70’s or 80’s style. There were some colorful pieces, some bell-legged pants, some shirts far too tight to even fit him, and some things that… sparkled. Quite a bit.
But who is there to hurt?
“What’s it to you?” he asked, cadence near identical to what Tony’s had been.
“No, it’s not,” Steve answered.
“You know what,” he started. “So long as you’re funny about it, I’ll be respectful of your opinion.”
It was probably something along those lines, one of those a-little-bit-dumb things Tony picked up from him and didn’t have the heart to poke too much at. Steve had been through a lot. It took a lot out of him to just
Part of Steve thought to check the internet, to put every word and phrase he could remember into the search bar and let the poor thing scour the web tirelessly for any words that matched his jumbled memories. He couldn’t quite bring himself to do it, though. He never knew why.
Steve’s light golden hair felt soft against Tony’s nose as he took Steve all the way down, eyes fluttering shut so he could block out any distractions and
“Absolutely not.” Nat gently bopped Jan’s knuckles with the pen in her hand. “But you can feel free.”
I’m texting this to the group chat.” With the press of a button, both Steve and Tony’s phones went off with a little ‘ping!’
He kind of wanted to get on with his day. The whole “don’t be mournful and melodramatic” thing took a lot out of him; he knew better than to dwell. Knowing and doing weren’t quite the same, and he was sure Steve would cross his mind throughout the day (or week, or month, or…), but effort was worth something, at least.
“Maybe. You know what’s
“Alright.”
“No preferences.”
know.
But it’s enough to make the night bearable, maybe even salvageable in whatever way broken nights can be.
Steve thought he might have liked to comment on the undertones of Tony’s hair in the light or the shine of his eyes outside (perhaps even the sun-kissed pinkness across his nose and cheeks if he was blessed enough), but the umbrella’s shade was cast over the entirety of his face, and Steve was left to speculate.
“It’s just not anything special,” Jan argued. “Maybe if it had a mock turtleneck or something, or rolled sleeves. Tony, what gay stuff do guys wear these days?”
“Mm?”
, and yet there he was, trying to force a conversation with the love of his life after-- after, uh.
Tony hummed thoughtfully, letting go of the book and resting his hand on Steve’s thigh instead. “… You, uh, fuck with the line weight? Make my lashes longer? Eyes a bit closer together? Shoulders a little broader?”
He had to shift. He had to change. The world wouldn't accommodate him unless he accommodated it.
“Are we the only one on this line? Do the others know you’re talking to me like this? I could report you to HR if I felt inclined.” Steve moved, then, toward the dance floor. He wasn’t thrilled about it, but he thought the movement of it might provide a more organic route for him to scope the whole place out.
There were plenty of other drawings. Cats on the windowsill, the city skyline from what Tony assumed to be a point on Steve’s bed, trees and flowers, and all sorts of things akin to those.
“How’d you sleep?” Tony asked.
“This is lovely, Steve,” Tony said honestly, careful not to smudge the charcoal with his thumbs. “I mean, you’ve really got an eye for this kind of stuff.”
him, or whatever version of him Steve saw when their eyes met, and Tony felt a keen sense of insecurity at that, as if he and all the life he’d lived were smaller than these beautifully crafted paper idols, unable to live up to them.
But he hadn’t.
He was happy with his own second chance, as well. He'd learned more than he ever thought he'd learn in his life- more than his know-it-all 20-something year old self thought was out there to know. He made his friends, he built his family, he fought alongside them and he fought them themselves, and he learned.
Iron Man didn’t feel like a symbol any more than Tony Stark did. Even back in the day, before Steve knew they were one and the same, they both seemed to shoulder similar amounts of responsibility, similar weight.
If only he'd known then how complicated "good" was. If nothing else, he still held onto one belief: he'd rather be fighting the enemy head-on than going through the bureaucratic hellscape that was the alternative. At the very least, he could feel his progress crack and bruise and bleed under his fists, and he could hate himself for that- for the violence, for the urgency, for the eagerness- just a little bit. It was satisfying in a sick sort of way in the beginning, when he was too young and too dumb to realize that some human beings were destined to meet the blunt edge of a shield or a red-gloved fist in the moments before they met God.
“What are you, a cat?”
And, sure, it wasn’t the most original compliment Tony had ever received, but there was a charm to it, wasn’t there?  There was a charm to Steve.
He flipped the cap of his cup open and took a sip, closing it shortly afterward. Steve was so enamored by the redness of his lips that he didn’t even notice the scent that had wafted toward him until some seconds after the fact.
“Uh, uber-muscular…” Carol flipped through her manila folder of notes, tracing her finger along a page until she found what she was looking for. “Uber-muscular alpha hunk… doms.”
“He’s late.”
Tony was clad in a cheap-looking Dracula costume, one that might have been purchased from a pop-up Halloween store, and the thought behind the action was as heartwarming as it was hilarious. Steve could imagine him strolling on by in his expensive, already vampiric-adjacent clothing, seeing those funny boots and that shiny cape, and going, “You know what I’ll do this Halloween?”
“Half an hour,” he answered, barely mumbling.
“Oh, yes.”
to be the most selfish thing. He doesn’t want to be told that being here right now, wanting this
“I’m sure you would have,” Iron Man said fondly. And then, over-enunciating for the humor of it all, he added: “Because
Tony rolled his eyes, pushing himself back up enough to return his attention to Steve’s cock.
And he woke up alone. Cold.
“Tony,” Steve started, and he asked again: “Are you alright?”
that he wouldn’t shake even if he could. It was pride, in a way, though not for himself.
“Testing, testing, 1-2. You hearing me, Winghead?” Tony’s voice filtered in through the comms as Steve entered the building.
“We’re home free, and hardly worse for the wear. But Kang lost his chance to restore Ravonna to life,” the Knight asserted.
But it didn’t come. “If you’ve got an address you can jot down, and if I—” Steve laughed, a little disbelieving, “if I make it out of this, somehow… I’ll look you up.”
Tony was flawless, yes. But lonesome, he seemed not to be.
There was the same gradual decline in the quality of his living space that there was in the testing areas. The worse he lashed out, the less he'd be able to keep. At first, it wasn't the worst arrangement in the world-- though he was spiteful still, of course, given that Hydra accommodations were Hydra accommodations no matter how pretty they tried to make them.
“Okay,” Tony finally said. “Okay. And that’s not going to… blow up or anything right now, is it? Now that you’ve told me?”
Tony laughed a little, something disbelieving and sweet. “Okay. Okay, yeah, I’ll take your word for it,” he promised, figuring it’d happen somewhere down the line. Right? It had to. And if not, he could pretend just as easily, couldn’t he?
He shifted on the bed, reaching over Tony to nab the condom from the nightstand. There was a soft clink as he did, and it only then occurred to Tony that he might have been wearing dog tags. Tony set his hand on the side of Steve’s neck and traced it downward until he felt two thin, cold chains laying just underneath the collar of Steve’s shirt. He slipped his finger underneath them and pulled, his hand following the chains until the tags rested loosely on his fingers.
“Uh-huh.”
The metal underneath him was warming, and it was almost pleasant for a moment as it hit a point of warmth that wasn't so extreme. And then it kept going. And it kept going, and all over again, he felt like he'd been set aflame, and no amount of writhing could free him from his restraints.
Tony smiled, holding the bouquet a little closer to himself. “You want to come inside? We could start making up for lost time.”
, looking back) that there was some genius answer he could come up with on the spot to solve the whole 'what's blue?' conundrum.
Marshall slid off of the arm of the couch and onto the cushion beside Steve; he’d been chatting away about some art piece or another he’d purchased, something he had nowhere to put despite so many of the walls being bare.
Steve’s hair was a dusty kind of red, his eyes brown, his lips thinner and his cheekbones sharper. He didn’t feel quite like himself, but he supposed that was the point.
Tony laughed. It was quiet, sweet. “Yeah, alright. I’m guessing I can’t get you on the dance floor, then?”
He wasn't stubborn like Steve.
He’d ignore the guilt curling in his chest like the vines of a rose bush. He didn’t want the daily reset button, didn’t even want the thought of it. But he had it, and all the two of them could do was adapt.
Tony didn't, always, and that was as perplexing as anything to Steve. Sometimes, Tony talked his way out of situations that Steve thought he should have confronted. Sometimes, Tony stayed silent, and he allowed himself to hurt because he was the only one (he thought, at least, which was perplexing in its own right some days). Sometimes, Tony made deals, he compromised, he outsmarted, he escaped.
“Geez, that suit jacket with that tie, huh?” Jan slumped back in her chair, arms crossed.
They could have known each other from the moment they opened their eyes, and it still wouldn’t be enough time.
Steve shrugged.
“Ah.”
-- but for the most part, his little curiosities lay where they began. Unanswered. Neglected.
There was a flash, and Tony pulled the camera in, zooming in on his own face to make sure no part of himself had been left undone. He took a few moments to review the picture then, satisfied still, set the camera on the nightstand.
“Did they force—”
Tony smelled… off. Wrong. He smelled strange in a way that would justify the cold, Steve thought. There was a metallic layer to blood that Steve was used to smelling, and in Tony, that was distinctly
Steve’s hand came to rest on the bottom of Tony’s chin. Tony eyed him, playfully suspicious, as he toyed with Tony’s bottom lip with a thumb.
“I have butter, too. I thought— you know, since it’s bread.”
It was so much all at once that Steve wasn't quite sure he felt anything at all. His body was loose, almost limp, when Tony pulled him into a tight hug.
Iron Man stared, blinked hard, turned away. “Well.”
Tony nodded, sighing with relief as he shifted to rest on his knees. Steve’s eyes, soft and watchful, locked with his. Tony could have sworn there was a hint of conflict in his gaze or a furrow in his brow, but Tony had been wrongly sure of himself in the past. He was projecting, wasn’t he? There was no reason for Steve to look at him like he wasn’t wanted.
of her hip against Steve’s thigh, not quite tall enough to do it properly, “and getting down and dirty with it. Steve, you want something like this.”
He’ll never mention it. He won’t put that on anyone else’s shoulders. And part of him is worried about what it might turn into, what banter might arise from it;
He might’ve been able to sort his thoughts more clearly if he weren’t so focused on Steve’s silhouette atop him, the ceiling light blurring like a halo around the edges of Steve’s form. Wisps of Steve’s hair fell forward, swaying with his movement.
, every single day, hand outstretched for Tony to grab with a grin on his face and his eyes twinkling.
Tony had said to him, a bite in his voice unlike anything Steve had heard before, like he was speaking to a cruel adversary post-attack and not a close friend of his,
Tony let out a long breath, assured once more in himself.
What, indeed?
It was his own blood, wasn't it? The wounds may not have been cauterized instantly. Maybe not every prong of the... rake, or whatever it was, because
With time, he came to listen for them, closing his eyes but refraining from dozing off until he heard those familiar sounds that served as confirmation that Tony was alive and well.
“One sec,” Steve said. “Almost forgot.”
Tony laughed again, not any less awkward than the first time. “You got all dressed up to take me to a diner?”
“It’s plugged into my heart.”
Steve gave a sad smile, chewing thoughtfully on his final piece of bagel. “Look at me. Do you think I could have had any of that anyway?”
, and now he’s stuck in it, trapped by it, can’t get away from it unless he—
“Tell you what. When Mr. Stark puts that time machine of his together, we’ll go back and we’ll make fun of your old uniform together.”
Iron Man mimed zipping up his mouth and locking it with a key, tossing the imaginary key over his shoulder. “I’d hate to hurt your feelings.”
It added to the pleasant clicking of Tony’s heels on the hardwood floor. The cane-umbrella would fall on its own rhythm, connected to Tony’s footsteps but not restricted by them. It was repetitive but not incredibly so, and Steve found himself listening closely, searching for the little off-beat taps that resembled the sound of Tony’s tinkering that could lull him to sleep.
“It’s 50 degrees out,” Steve argued still. He’d give up any opportunity to admire Tony’s figure for the sake of Tony’s comfort.
“You’re funny,” Tony said to him after a moment, snapping him out of his daze.
Tony took a long sip of the drink, tired eyes glimmering ever so slightly more than they had been moments before. Steve set the cup on the nightstand, taking a seat beside Tony on the bed again.
“Do what?”
“A multi-level marketer?” Tony asked, puzzled. “What, like, as a side hustle?”
“Maybe it doesn’t have to be
"I'm home," he repeated, leaning against the armor just a tad bit more.
And though Tony had questions, he didn’t ask. He wasn’t sure whether it was out of respect or blind obedience, given that he also didn’t give an affirmative. All he did was stare, letting his hand drop back to the bed as Steve moved on. He did what Steve asked. Nothing more, nothing less.
Laying there, with the memory of his back against the sparring mat and Steve's hand outstretched for him, with the memory of Steve's eyes on his, he thought there was something poetic about all that
Tony's intelligence, his drive, his up-played hubris couldn't pull him back from it, then. His brain had been set alight with wonder and awe at the thought of Steve, the reality of the electric blue sparks that seemed to buzz off him in droves. There was no level of genius that could keep him from wondering; how blue are Steve's eyes? How are they so deep, so dark? How are they structured? What do they look like up close?

Unexpectedly, Steve leaned over to press a kiss above Tony’s temple, right where his hairline started. “I’ll show you
They came into the room. They were armored up, armed, they had tasers at the ready, and they probably fully believed they were prepared to retrieve Steve for whatever fucked up bullshit it was they wanted to put him through. He fought. He almost won.
“No embellishments,” Steve said, reaching up to lightly touch Tony’s jaw. “See? ‘s the same.”
“1926? When you were a sickly toddler?”
No blood.
That sure was a question. Truth was, Tony didn’t
, though it very well could have been projection. This wasn’t his strong suit; he wasn’t incapable of being stealthy, nor was working undercover terribly new to him, but it wasn’t his preferred method and everyone knew it. He wasn’t as easy to conceal as Nat, not as tech-savvy as Tony with all his stealth-oriented machinations. He couldn’t shrink himself down nor make himself look like just any average guy in a room.
Two drinks. He waited.
“Well, he looks both like he’s gay and like he’d brew his own beer,” Tony answered. “And the leather’s— well, there’s the implication.
And so Tony kissed him, hoping desperately that they’d ebb and flow with each other more easily if they kept things unspoken. To his relief (delight, really), Steve set his hands on Tony’s waist, tugging him closer, pulling him back into the space between his legs and deepening the kiss.
Something in him keeps in mind the eye of the public, its gaze like chains around his wrists tethering him forcefully to reality. He keeps in mind the drunks, the depressed, and all those in need who were at one point deluded into thinking he was some kind of role model, some pinnacle of modern health and recovery that he just— He isn’t, he feels like. Not anymore. Recovery certainly isn’t linear, but if it ends like this, is it really recovery?
“Easy, love.” Steve set his hands just under Tony’s armpits, gently urging him to lay his side against the mattress. “There you are. That’s good, huh?”
The relief was immediate. All at once, Tony’s body felt warm again.
Something about that loosened what few knots remained in Steve’s chest after the days they’d had; it was a sweet idea, a funny kind of thing that Steve thought he might enjoy. It was a hypothetical that would keep him up plenty of nights after that, he was sure, as plenty of other hypotheticals involving the two of them did.
Steve reached out with his free hand, appreciatively sliding his palm over Tony’s calf. It wasn’t too much of an intentional movement, seeming more like a natural impulse than anything else. It was sweet. Tony didn’t often feel casually desirable, wanted in the way that well-loved wives were when they received a goodbye kiss from their husband on his way out to work every morning, but Steve did something to him. He knew it wouldn’t last, but for these precious moments, at least, he could pretend like he’d wake up tomorrow morning and get to do this all over again.
He glanced up, caught his own reflection in Steve’s eyes, and couldn’t find a difference between himself and the man Steve had drawn so many times over.
a little more tired that day, stretched thinner than usual, Steve couldn’t tell.
done that, he’d made Steve feel that way.
Well, Tony couldn’t argue with that. He shimmied awkwardly into Steve’s lap, careful not to put too much of his weight on Steve’s poor legs. Part of him felt stupid for worrying, figuring that there was no way they’d let Steve arm a giant robot with
Steve shrugged in a dismissive sort of gesture, leaning over to press a kiss to Tony’s temple before shimmying out of the bed. He crumpled the paper bag up and tossed it idly from one hand to the other, not quite ready to leave. “I’ve gotta head back about now. It was real, real nice to spend that night with you, Tony. Thanks for letting me have breakfast with you.”
was the answer, clearly.
He didn't have to feel it to know it. Tony was there. Tony was home.
in the uniform and more
To say the least, it was sweeter than anything Steve could have expected. They fell together naturally once they’d been stripped of their costumes, Tony seating himself in Steve’s lap as if they were lock and key, made for one another. Steve groaned as he did so, hands coming to rest on Tony’s hips as Tony moved.
There was a twinkle in the man’s lightly greyed eyes, in the crinkles at their corners. His nose was ever-so-slightly bent and pointed, accent lines placed carefully and gorgeously. The lips, curled into that grin Tony’d noticed before, showed signs of wear and anxious chewing, facial hair dotted with intention above and below.
“Another night like this,” Tony started, “and I might. What’s it to you?”
Before Steve could chime in, Jan shared her opinion, clearly of the same mind. “It’s not a picnic date, Tony, they’re
, the
He didn't remember the next time they came to retrieve him, nor did he remember any time after that. What he
His eyes scanned the room as he brushed the bread crumbs off of his hands and onto his slacks. He wasn’t quite so overstimulated- not like he was in the beginning, at least, before Tony took notice of his discomfort and took steps to make everything easier to handle for him. It was a touching and not-too-invasive gesture; he’d ask people to keep yelling to a minimum and, if they were to sing and dance, do it with tact. Sure, there was a wild quality to the parties that had been diluted to some degree, but no one minded enough to break the rules, and everyone seemed to have a more relaxed (and more memorable, for some) time for it. It was still quite a lot to look at, but Steve figured he could manage that on his own.
convince himself, and he took the poor bastard back to his room, and there they were.
“Y’wanna go all the way?”
“Lovely.” Marshall flagged the bartender down, offering a smile. “Two bourbons. Neat.” He turned to Steve, then, reaching out to fiddle with the buckle on Steve’s suspenders. “Call me Jack, by the way.”
“Three days out of surgery now,” he said. “Doc was in earlier. You didn’t wake up much. She said the amount of swelling was fine n’ they’d come by to drain it tomorrow.”
here, he knew, rationally, that it had more to do with the lights, the crowd, and the obscurity of the place.
“Well, sure, but that doesn’t say terribly much. I mean, everyone knows the
Tony’s face fell. Jan went quiet. Nat— well, Nat had looked relatively serious from the beginning.
“Yeah, that sounds about right.” Tony lightly bumped his armored shoulder against Steve’s. Steve responded in kind, going so far as to wrap an arm around Tony’s waist for the picture, thumb lightly caressing the joint at which the armor’s torso connected to the upper thigh.
The lights were harsh, purples and blues and greens flashing over dark walls and the reflective dance floor. The colors caught on the bottles at the bar, painting ever-changing, wave-like impressions on the bartenders’ faces and clothes. The intensity matched the sound of the place, far too loud and cluttered for Steve to feel comfortable. He recognized the song playing, though not by name— it was the Spice Girls or Beyonce or something, one of those artists that Jess and Tony sang to when they were in the car together. The lyrics were difficult to discern, and even the melody seemed warped below the chattering of the crowd.
He knew the face to look for. He remembered every detail he’d picked up from the photograph in the meeting. He scanned the crowd for the right color of hair, the right height— and, with the image inducer, he could rest assured that no one would recognize him in the process.
Steve thought of him in kind; his mind fluttered back to his hopeful fantasy of a sun-kissed Tony smiling in the day, but more realistically (and more seriously, he thought, as he loved no version of Tony more than the tangible one), the Tony who was always in the shade and covered head-to-toe in gorgeous thin fabrics, draping across his body weightlessly and gently.
“I was thinking, too, you know. About the you from the past, and all the fight he had in him. He was
“That’s an awful name,” Nat said, as Tony faked a gag in agreement.
, and the serpent’s watchful gaze of the night before had all but disappeared into the past.
Endless days. Stretching out, longer and longer, bleeding blurrily into the next and stretching more. Fragile as he was, he thought this facet of him indestructible, like nothing could promise an end to the bitter loneliness he’d come to loathe.
He took a few seconds. There was no reason, really, behind the hesitance; no thoughts ran through his mind telling him this was something more intimate than he deserved, and no cramps or aches kept his arm from moving. He felt paralyzed in the moment, briefly wondering what this must have looked like; he found himself envying the birds outside the window and the flies on the wall, wanting badly to see how he looked beside Steve in the soft light of the lamp and the mess of having just gotten out of bed.
need from
Sam would laugh-squawk, feathers ruffling loose of his shaking shoulders as he did so. Jan’s giggles were light as air, seeming to float on wings as easily as she did. Everyone on the team had something to say about them; all the jokes were recycled or, at the very least, along the same vein as one another. So it wasn’t an uncommon occurrence for Steve or Tony to be in company with a friend and, when the other entered, the friend would exclaim in jest that they mistakenly thought they’d get to have time alone with one of the pair for once.
Another contradiction Steve found in Tony Stark: he was unpredictable and predictable. He was a rational man, clearly, and some would say he was too much of one. Steve figured you could throw a handful of variables into the mix again and again and, if you were smart enough, or if you had the tech to help you out with it, you could figure out what Tony would do under almost any set of circumstances. Steve thought Tony was consistent in beliefs and rationale, but inconsistent in actions; at the end of the day, he was under the assumption that Tony was just working with a different set of variables than Steve tended to.
this.”
Tony blinked, giving Steve that same funny look he gave the first time Steve ever said to him,
goodbye,” he said, voice halfway muffled through the bite of bagel. “Any idea where you’re heading next?”
The color blue, Tony had learned some years ago in school, rarely occurred in nature. And the things that
“Or— Wherever. Wherever you want, if we can get in.”
of color, that any blue one could see was an illusion. Tony had fought back a little bit on the wording--
“If you say so…”
Tony and Jan, respectful as they were, were in as heated a discussion as any two rich adults with eyes for fashion could be.
and how quickly and aptly it was named.
“You make a habit out of drinking like that?” he asked. He had the voice of a Manhattanite, though not quite the stature of one. He seemed to be hiding himself almost as much as Tony was, his coat wrapped tight around him and his head bent down ever so slightly. He barely turned his head to look at Tony as he spoke, and Tony could recognize the action; he was trying, however unsuccessfully, not to show his face. His hair alone was unique, a little long and a little wispy, unkempt and wild enough that it covered his eyes when he shifted or jerked.
and not-quite-Cap-but-almost-Cap it was. He’d donned the sunflower print dress shirt Tony was so keen on putting him in, matched with a nice pair of brown slacks and shoes. He cleared his throat, smiling politely at Carol before turning his attention to Tony.
“I was experimenting. That’s what they say, right? Experiment with your sexuality.”
“He passed out.”
It wasn’t a command. It wasn’t anything but a promise, and yet Tony found himself gathering his thoughts and slotting them in place according to Steve’s will. They’d take it slow. It wasn’t a command, no, but Tony made it one. He found comfort in treating Steve’s words like truths over anything else. It was easier to follow along.
was to begin with.
Wasn’t he?
Once the shirt was open, Steve lightly pushed its sleeves down Tony’s arms. It was a suggestion, and after a moment of dumb staring, Tony got the hint and raised himself up enough for Steve to tug the shirt away and discard it. Steve smoothed his hand over Tony’s side, leaning down to trail his lips along Tony’s collarbone.
And dismissed what he thought was the best case scenario before, because the
And he didn’t. Plain and simple.
before
Steve slipped his hands underneath Tony’s thighs and lifted. Though he wasn’t quite strong enough to carry Tony for any meaningful length of time, he had enough in him to lay Tony back against the bed and climb on top of him. His presence crowded Tony in a way that might have been suffocating to some, but there was a comfort to the position that Tony couldn’t quite pin down.
When the time came, he was wholly unprepared.
He looked confident in a way he hadn’t the night prior. He was cute, Tony thought, if a bit hesitant. He’d looked at Tony like a gift he wasn’t sure belonged to him— ever so carefully, he’d unwrapped Tony in the same way. It felt forbidden. Tony himself felt forbidden, both flattered and not, grateful for the fact that he was still a temptation in his age and dreading the sinful implications that followed.
Tony was frustrated enough with him, clearly, as if Steve had been attacking him directly. He didn’t speak to Steve for some hours. Steve couldn’t help but feel a dog-like sense of heartbreak when someone he thought himself so loyal to chose to neglect him, even when the action was so temporary and so perfectly justified.
He has an escape, at least. Doesn’t he? He has an escape this time.
Tony felt the sweet caress of Steve’s hand against his ribs, so tender and loving that he nearly felt like crying.
This didn’t feel quite the same, though. Tony didn’t look at Steve and imagine another face, at least not for more than a moment. When Steve looked at him, there was nothing in his eyes nor expression suggesting he felt any differently. He didn’t look at Tony like a body to be used. He didn’t look at Tony like a morbidly pleasant tombstone of a past love.
His hands went everywhere they could reach. When they brushed over the side of Tony’s neck, he found two marks- two puncture marks- and regarded them curiously.
“How do you like it, sweet pea?” Steve asked, voice low in Tony’s ear.
be blue; see, what made something blue was the presence of a
“I’ll see you soon,” Tony mumbled against Steve’s lips. “I’ll see you.”
Jan, seeming a little more comfortable with the beginnings of a plan in place, clearly thought a half-joke wouldn’t hurt: “You gonna honeypot, Nat?”
And a nice day it was. Though it was mid-October, the weather wasn’t so cool that one would feel obligated to layer up if they didn’t want to-- no one average, at least. Steve didn’t need much to keep warm, but he knew Tony ran cold. There would be times when they’d reach for the same mug in the kitchen and their hands would brush, and Tony’s skin was so cold to the touch that Steve might have thought him a corpse under different circumstances.
Steve tried to force the tension out of limbs. He could still feel the ghost of a hand on his back, the acute and sudden self-awareness of how flush against himself the waistband of his pants was. His shirt felt a little too tight then, the tie around his neck almost choking him.
It was the love without the attention, Steve thought. It used to feel horribly isolating in the beginning, back before Steve had found where he belonged. But it became familiar as all things did with time, and if he listened closely, he could still pick out Jan’s pixie laughs and Sam’s squawks and Peter’s many mouths chattering away excitedly.
“Self-destruct.”
And then he paused.
the teacher said, and Tony's brain responded,
“I’m quite alright,” Tony said. He looked covered enough, but the materials draping from his body always seemed so weightless, so thin. He wore silk and velvet (both crushed and uncrushed), lace and other sheer fabrics, and altogether un-warm clothing that would do him no good in the Autumn cold.
Instantly, Steve felt he knew the play-by-play. All they had to do was apply it to the floor plan in front of them, wait for Captain Marvel to send Wasp for recon, and once they had some info on the security systems in place, they’d bring Iron Man and Black Widow in and put the break-in in motion.
70’s. Well, Steve almost got it right. It was sandwiched somewhere in his guess.
He could hold it out for Steve. For their anniversary, maybe.
Steve got up. Steve fought. When it was right to fight- when the fighting was justified- Steve fought.
“I didn’t know.”
“Did Carol actually
“A cyanide pill?”
“I want to forget about this. C’mon, you just got home. Let’s get some takeout. Watch a movie, maybe.” Tony forces the ease into his voice. It’s a weak effort, one Steve will see through in an instant, but it’s not entirely useless. Steve knows what to do with that, at least.
“You don’t have to sort through it on your own.”
Steve took a seat at the bar and, trying not to look like he was staring, kept an eye on the target. He’d wait.
in t-shirts and jeans and plain leather jackets, but he attributed that more to the fact that Cap was a character, a symbol, than anything else.
” hips stuttering as he came.
“After all my
“Yep,” Steve confirmed under his breath. Thin, horizontal stripes of window lined the very tops of the walls; they didn’t allow for anyone to look in, really, but Steve liked them. He could see the stars through the glass, which was more calming a sight than anything else in the building.
“I like to think so. Name’s Steve, by the way.”
, certainly, but
“Okay, I—” Tony cleared his throat. Steve could almost visualize him, how he’d be talking if he were standing right in front of Steve. He could imagine Tony raising his hands from the keyboard, holding them up in a loose surrender. He could imagine the ever-so-slight tilt of Tony’s head, the apologetic straightening of his lips and downcast gaze. “Sorry, got distracted. I didn’t like how he was touching you. And I didn’t like that you were clearly grinning and bearing it when it wasn’t necessary at that point.”
“Love Actually,” Tony repeated. He reached into the bowl on Steve’s lap and popped a few pieces of popcorn into his mouth; he certainly had the knowledge of manners, being raised the way he was raised, but he threw etiquette out the window as he mumbled through his chewing. “Isn’this that corny Christmas movie that—”
It took him a long moment to realize why that felt so wrong to him. The memories flooded back, replayed in Technicolor waves against the backs of his eyelids. He felt the phantom sensation of slender hands on his torso, of metal against his side, of a little tin with worn edges, and of wispy golden hair that reflected light like the moon before the sun.
best case scenario was standing right in front of him.
All that to say.
It was a nice design choice, Steve thought. It looked expensive. It looked almost comically stereotypical.
in a year, so much to pour their hearts into, so much to work on and so much to work for.
“Do I really need to answer that?”
“Well.” Tony slipped his own jacket off, then, placing it more delicately on the back of the desk chair; he smoothed out the few wrinkles that bunched up at the shoulders, turning to find Steve staring. “You like what you see?”
He knew he cared. But it had been so long, and he'd spent so many years being told not to concern himself with trivial things like this that to return to the questions he'd had so long ago felt strange, almost forbidden. Don't dig too deep. Don't look too hard. Let it be what it is.
Something stirred in Steve’s gut at that, uncomfortable and hot. He was sure he was just concerned for Tony’s safety— everyone and their mother knew Tony had a bad habit of getting in bed with people he shouldn’t have, and this was no different. Tony wouldn’t fall in love with a villain— not one who started out that way, at least, and not one who was so openly malicious— but Steve wasn’t quite sure he had a limit to how far he’d go for the mission.
“… Tony?”
“Let me take care of you, now,” he said, calling attention to the near painful hard-on that Tony had forgotten to tend to. “C’mere, in my lap, doll.”
He could put a bullet in his head in a fit of anger, frustration, sadness, whatever it might be… and it’ll never be just for him. Some part of him will know, even in the end, that he’d have loved to be the kind of man who could guiltlessly overstay his welcome. But he’s not, and he won’t ever be— he could put a bullet in his head in a fit of every feeling he’s ever felt, and the ghost of him would kneel over his body, fading extremities shaking violently as he’d ask,
“Nothing,” Tony answers, as truthful as he can be. “I’ll figure it out.”
The Black Knight glanced down at his hands, seeming half shocked and half impressed with himself. “I struck in desperation—
seemed too simple and innocent a word to describe whatever the fuck it was that hurt
Steve laughed, though there wasn’t much humor to it. His gaze fell to the sheets, fingers pulling and pinching at them as Tony watched.
And he cries.
Tony wondered if Steve thought the same of him. They'd locked eyes so many times-- in battle, in meetings, both face-to-face and through the slits of the suit. Every time,
“We’ll take it slow.”
The Black Knight seemed re-energized at the assertion alone, his eyes glimmering not unlike his sword. “If that means you’re making me an Avenger, I accept! Though my home is in England now, I’ll answer the call when you need me!”
Steve didn’t. Steve stayed. Steve touched him like he’d touch a woman—
wrong with this, of course, as most of the time, it allowed Steve to escape his captors before he could ever really be considered a "victim of kidnapping."
“C’mere, come lay.”
“What time?” he asked.
Yes, fuck, a sweetheart like you? Of course you could’ve.”
The truth of it is, none of that was better, really. He was still prone to pensiveness as a child, and his nostalgia is bitter, ever-changing, lying to him. He read his books in the courtyard and was humiliated for it. He’d hide behind his mother and he’d be shooed into the next room (the regret on her face evident, the concern for him clear). He’d think,
“Oh, yeah? That’s something I’d like to see.” Steve let his hand slide down to the side of Tony’s face, his thumb affectionately stroking over Tony’s cheekbone. “You’re a dear.”
“Oh, yeah?” Tony asked, toeing the line between interested and prying. He always kind that way with Steve, like he didn’t know quite what was personal and what wasn’t, and he’d hate to be presumptuous and start connecting dots that Steve hadn’t already.
“That was a bit much.”
The first fix was relatively simple, and Steve had a difficult time commending Hydra (he thought it was Hydra, at least, but there was no way of confirming-- he didn't recognize the cell he'd been placed in as anything he'd seen before) for something so simple.
And though Tony wasn’t tinkering or walking through the mansion, Steve could smell his scent in the room and hear his soft breaths, and he was lulled asleep once more.
It was hot metal, being scraped down his body from his shoulder blades to the small of his back. It was then that he realized how little he'd been using his voice in the past however long it had been, because the pained scream that was torn out of his throat was more sharp and agonizing than any he'd let out before.
He almost laughed, but he’d gotten stuck on one thing she’d said.
At the end of the day, if they couldn’t wash the blood from Cap’s suit, they’d replace it. They’d scrub him clean one way or another.
“’Course.” Steve slipped a hand into his pocket, feeling around for the little device. It was about the size of a micro USB and, as promised, not visible through the fabric of the pants’ pockets. He’d find Marshall… seduce Marshall, get to his place, find his personal computer, and insert the drive. Tony would take it from there. It was an easy plan, Steve knew. For them, at least. Still, years of things going south in spy and action films had him antsy.
“Yeah, they’re… They’re really—” Tony’s voice cracked as he spoke, and he felt about as shocked as Steve looked at that. He reached up, touching a fingertip to his eye, and found it came away wet. “Uh.”
“Well?”
Funnily enough, no innocent analogy came to mind; this wasn’t a blanket draped gently over him. It wasn’t the radiating heat of a fireplace nor the comfort of a heated building after a day in the snow. It wasn’t as if Tony felt bitterly toward Steve— that couldn’t be further from the truth. There was nothing but sweetness.
Uncertainly, Tony did.
“Tony,” Steve repeats, more wounded this time. He wraps his arms around Tony, pulls Tony in. Tony’s sobs are quiet, and he knows he’s only pressing closer to muffle them, some voice in his head telling him that to cry openly is dangerous, still, after all these years.
“Am I in a pauper-to-princess movie? Is that what this is?” Tony let Jan rest a hand on his lower back, following as she took the lead out.
“What’s your place in this?” Nat asked.
“You’re not
They headed back to the mansion, the nerves came flooding back, and it wasn’t quite as nice as it had been all night. It wasn’t like Steve could follow any sort of standard procedure; they lived across the hall from each other, and any ‘I’ll walk you home’ sentiment might have been a little redundant. He didn’t want to kiss Tony and overstep boundaries. He didn’t want to
It wasn’t until Tony had finished his morning routine by securing a wig to the top of his head (a wig that Steve hadn’t ever noticed until just then), and smiling at himself, satisfied. He stood, then, and he made his way back to bed with Steve. He fished a little digital camera out from the nightstand drawer and turned it around to point at the two of them.
“Hey,” he greeted. “Watch this.” He held an opaque thermos in one hand-
“Yeah. Yeah, c’mere.”
“That’s right.” Carol pressed the button of the little clicker she held in her hand, and the image on the projector shifted. On it was the floorplan of a large, warehouse-like facility with a small ‘X’ marking one specific room; Steve’s eyes went to the exits first, then the chokepoints. His mind conjured up images of security guards— where he’d send them, what their most efficient pathing would be. He wondered idly what the colors of the walls were, what color a guard might wear, what the team would have to do to get inside the damn place and navigate it undetected.
“Then I don’t think you were with him in the same way I— Cap, hey.”
to hold makes him feel wholly unlike himself, but it’s the first thing to come to mind when he takes the little thing out from its place in his nightstand drawer. It’s unsatisfying.
“That was a compliment to Mr. Stark. As far as I’m concerned, I’ve received no compliments tonight.”
“He’s popped up at a few Speakeasy-style gay bars. Expensive ones, for all your favorite closeted CEOs and fat cats.”
He just wasn't above calling it like he saw it: they certainly made a hobby out of acting like it.
“Yeah, it is. It is. But it’s, uh, definitely not a misnomer. Someone leaked minimal trials to us, and it’s a pretty serious weapon. From what I could tell in the file— Tony, I sent this over to you, too— it’s… based on some of our strongest. Blood samples from Cap. Energy samplings from my powers.”
“May I be invited in?”
Tony felt light with relief, so light that he could barely ground himself enough to approach Steve, grabbing him by the wrist and pulling him into a long, deep kiss. Steve let the crumpled bag fall out of his grasp to set a hand on Tony’s waist, pulling him in ever closer, like they’d never be close enough.
. Believable enough for them to continue on as if it had been nothing at all.
There was detail in the face.
“You make a habit out of watching the sunrise?” Tony asked. There was no judgment Steve could read from his tone, no mocking amusement. Still, he stiffened ever so slightly, trying to will the feeling away.
“I have. You look nice,” Tony insisted. It was a funny sort of misalignment; Tony knew damn well what Steve meant, but the urge to reassure him in whatever way possible was difficult to overcome. Tony wanted to say it, maybe because he’d wanted to hear it himself. Steve was all sorts of things— all sorts of things that Tony had been, too, though he knew they weren’t the same. They couldn’t be more different.
He would never call Bucky a "sacrifice," nor would he call him a "necessary casualty." He was a kid, back then, and he should never have been out there. He should never have been fighting. But he was, and he did, and he died for it. In Steve's mind, if not in reality, that bright-eyed young kid he knew was gone.
before his gaze fixed on a man— angular, with dull grey eyes and slicked-back brown hair— approaching the bar.
He did. He wanted that badly. Another thing he wouldn’t admit.
“Okay, you’re not actually mad about me making fun of Love Actually, are you?” he asked, sitting back.
"I'm home," Steve replied, though there was a lack of... well,
They’d fallen into Tony’s plush, expensive bed together, tumbling downward in a mess of cheap fabrics and silly props, and they’d possibly been as excited and uncoordinated as they were when they were teenagers. Tony laughed, and Steve laughed with him, thinking his laugh to be the most recognizable and most gorgeous laugh of all with its low, rich timbre.
and he’d be lying to himself.
The gears turn in his head anyway.
That night specifically was October 31st- Halloween night, as everyone knew- and the mansion was filled with friendly faces, both human and otherwise. Steve hesitated to call Tony a “party animal,” but he certainly was a more-than-decent host. Tables of food spread so far across the ballroom floor that Steve thought individual desserts alone might outnumber guests, and the music that played seemed to filter through every room equally, never leaving one’s side.
. They felt so far away, then. So unattainable.
, almost— but I downed him! How, Grand-Master, how?”
That was the kind of warmth he wanted for Tony, outside of literal terms. The kind of warmth you could wrap yourself up in. The kind of warmth that made you feel at home.
Tony stayed then.
“Am I not uber-muscular? Am I not an alpha hunk?”
Plenty of folks walked around loving themselves into existence, and Tony knew that well. He never quite viewed himself as one half of a whole, never saw himself as
The team wouldn't be happy, seeing him in this condition. They'd be worse off seeing a corpse.
Steve looked down, eyes fixed on Marshall’s slender, smooth hands. “Right. Call me Grant.”
He’d leave it up to Tony.
Maybe it’ll be Jan. Maybe they’ll call Rhodey in— he’s always had the key to every door Tony’s locked, after all.
didn’t pick this mission up, why she wasn’t the one leading, but then again, he supposed that was never her style. Management didn’t seem to be her favorite aspect of the job, and she was always more immersed in the work when the only people she needed to keep extensive tabs on were herself and her targets. Jan was Jan; she had the Wasp suit and she was practiced in its use. Recon and simple locks were often her responsibility in stealth missions.
Steve paused. “No?”
Steve felt it would be unfair to associate everyone in the bar with this man. After all, it was unlikely that his behavior was representative of everyone’s, and while Steve wasn’t
He grunted in response, settling back in bed beside Tony. He set a heavy hand on Tony’s forearm, thumb rubbing idly over the skin there as he fixed his gaze on the treetops and the sky just above them.
The last thing Steve heard before the door closed behind them was, “Honey, you’re kidding yourself if you think you’re a pauper.”
“Sure,” Steve answered. “Your choice.”
“… Are you sure? ‘Cause you kind of look miserable right now.”
And Tony said to him, as shocked as Steve had felt just moments prior:
“I don’t know what more you want to hear.”
“You better.” Steve tilted Tony’s face toward himself, and Tony caught another glimpse of the softness in Steve’s wandering eyes.
He feels selfish for even letting it get this far, selfish for letting it happen, for wanting to—
It became easier as minutes passed, as the blue light filtering in through the translucent curtains faded into a delightful golden-orange. Tony found it effortless to focus on Steve’s face and the way his brows furrowed as he zeroed in on whatever square centimeter of the drawing he was perfecting in that moment.
“Ohh, yeah. Yeah, you seemed like you needed some courtesy back-up.”
“Good for you?” he asked, his voice clearly tired, even to himself.
“You’re a werewolf.”
He still asked. He still wondered. But instead of researching, he simply hypothesized. He'd ask a friend if it was convenient--
Intriguing. Disconcerting.
“No, Jack Marshall.”
“I could probably find it again. The eraser lines are kind of obvious.”
“What about you?” Steve asked, and Tony was shocked enough to flinch, however slightly. Steve gave him a look, but didn’t acknowledge it much past that.
“’s alright.” Tony suppressed the urge to cough. Allowing himself a moment’s break to enjoy the attention, he settled his head against Steve’s inner thigh, almost playfully sticking his tongue out as far as he could to lick at Steve.
“I was just preparing for a walk,” Tony explained, walking over to meet Steve at his desk. He left his umbrella (black, with a lace trim) against the doorway. The low, stiff heels of his shoes clacked against the dark hardwood floor that dressed every bedroom in the mansion. Tony held his hand out for Steve’s book curiously, and Steve handed it over with no fuss. Tony’s finger (dressed in a white glove alongside the rest of his hands) lightly traced along the edges of it, his gaze fluttering over the cover with a twinkle that perplexed Steve.
Tony laughed, though it was a hesitant sort of thing, as if things hadn’t quite clicked for him yet. “Uh, Cap? You’re not going on an… impressionist-lesbian-painting type second date with the funny new quasi-villain, are you?”
Steve was still.
was, Tony had offered to do the same, making it a battle of who could be more insistent about the whole thing). He’d set a hand on the small of Tony’s back as they walked through the halls, which were eerily quiet, eerily empty. The team was probably trying to give them space or something. Steve wasn’t going to complain.
“Very, it looks like.”
would bring to surface, but he knew well when he was being othered.  “What you said would be offensive.”
It was up to the leader of the mission— Carol, it was, this time around— to pick and choose who she wanted at the conference table. It was an odd bunch; to the left of Tony sat Jan, and across from Jan was Nat. They were the only four called, each with a different skillset and style, and even with all of Steve’s tactical brilliance, he couldn’t piece together what they were all there to do.
“This is, uh… This isn’t standard, is it?” he asked, and the expression that colored Steve’s face in response was only slightly bewildered.
As Steve set his hand on Tony’s waist, tugging Tony’s tucked shirt out of his pants so he could properly touch Tony’s skin, Tony’s mind drifted to the small but real concern that this was the kind of warmth one had to pay for. It was a lot of power to give to a man, wasn’t it? Where would he be if Steve decided to take it away now?
Walking through the mansion alone could be considered a “walk,” Steve thought. It was a large place, and the rooms were all localized on one side of it. There were a handful of exits dotted around, but Tony always made a show of using the front door. It was grandiose and almost ill-fitting, as if it was built separately from the rest of the building and tacked on at the end. Most of the walls, the counters, and floors- the chairs and tables, even- were made of a dark brown wood with reddish undertones. The front doors, though, were almost cherry. Its accents were gold, spreading upward from the bottom corners as if creeping up the sides like vines.
Steve remembered thinking, once.
“What do you see?” Steve flipped the tin open. It contained not three, but
like Tony Stark.
“What’re you up to, ‘round here?” he asked the stranger, planting himself more firmly in his seat. He raised a finger to flag the bartender down for another drink.
“Just checking.”
It could have been explained away, but it wasn’t, and that fact alone was more damning than anything Tony’s active imagination could have dreamt up.
“I—” There was a beat of quiet. Steve’s fingers traced lightly along Tony’s side. Then the bed dipped ever so slightly, and Steve pressed close against Tony, the cold metal thing in his chest soothing against Tony’s skin.  “Alright. Sleep, now.”
Distantly, he was aware of the people around him chatting back and forth. They spoke like Tony spoke, a little bit, when Reed was around. Or when Bruce was around, or Hank. They spoke back and forth as if bouncing off of each other, and Steve's chest tightened as he heard low laughter coming from one side of the room. He wasn't aware enough of his surroundings to catch exactly what it was they were saying to each other, but he heard mentions of "subjects RB2-A, RB2-B, and RB2-C," and how they were responding to similar experimentation.
There was nothing he could do. They'd proven that much.
Maybe he just couldn't, anymore.
,” he threatened, though it rang empty as he bent over to pull out a large-ish bin from under the bed. “Here.”
It’s suffocating, being on display like he is; he should feel grateful for the love, the praise, the honor that comes with being that hero for so many kids like the one he used to be. He
And Tony looked through, as promised, and found that nothing had changed. There was no point at which the man on the page wasn’t absolutely shining, even when rain-drenched or sleeping messily on the couch or irritably sipping from a beaker-shaped mug of coffee. Tony wasn’t friendly with mirrors, barely even looking at them when he got his damn hair cut, and this was effectively the emotional equivalent of a mirror with a ring light and a 10x magnifier, tinted rose for good measure.
“I’ve got a hotel room,” Tony added.
He would joke about being a hot commodity if he had the energy left to joke. He wasn't sure quite how long it had been since he was taken, but it was somewhere between... a handful of weeks and a handful of years. Probably closer to weeks, right? But maybe not much closer. Had the team been unaware of his kidnapping, any semblance of a timeline would be nearly impossible to put together. He knew they were looking, though- they had to be- and he was certain they wouldn't take too long to find him.
“It’s not
“I’ll place the order.”
He'd never quite felt it, though.
Even then, his body couldn’t decide whether it wanted to pull away or press closer, whether the touch was too much or not enough. He could beg Steve to go faster, harder, slower, softer, give him
Steve wouldn't say he'd forgotten what had happened to him- that certainly wasn't the case- but he'd been so worried about Tony while he was gone. He'd been so worried.
That Tony- usually so sharp and so quick-witted- was a little bit off, it seemed.
He couldn’t coax it out of himself. No affirmations registered as anything but noise. He grew lonelier, more frustrated, more isolated. At times, it seemed best that isolation led him to a disconnect from himself— after all, he was most effective without distractions, wasn’t he? He was the most equipped for all the altruism he hoped he was capable of, wasn’t he?
me, on my couch, in front of my TV, while I was sitting patiently…”
“You smiled! You were smiling.”
He was isolated, though, and he knew how that alone could damage even the most resilient men alive. He was isolated, and there were only so many thoughts and memories he could cycle through before even that became more of a chore than a comfort. He laid down and tried to imagine Tony there next to him, with his olive-toned skin and his icy blue eyes, but Steve found himself losing his confidence in his memory of those eyes. Tony's hair was black- jet black as opposed to a warmer shade, which Steve noticed as soon as he met Tony- but even his hair was difficult to remember too accurately. The more Steve tried to picture Tony's face, the more it felt as if he was grasping for vague concepts of what he
And he hadn't gotten much farther than that before the teacher interrupted, said "It's more complicated than that," and left it there. Tony-- young as he was and curious, bright, more lively than he'd turn out to be after a few more years of that same school-- wasn't off-put by the correction at all.
wrong. It felt wrong the second Marshall set his hand on Steve.
Tony closed the door quietly behind Steve, eyes slightly widened in disbelief as he watched Steve plop down on the edge of the bed. He huffed out a laugh, averted his gaze. “Uh, no, I— That’s really… I didn’t expect this.”
rolled it on, his forehead against Tony’s shoulder as he worked it down his length. Tony nipped lightly at his ear, not entirely sure what possessed him to do so— aside from the closeness, of course, and the desire to keep it.
“Two sesame seed bagels,” Steve said, pulling those out and setting them aside on a napkin. “And I wasn’t sure what you’d want, so I got you plain. I’m sorry if that’s boring. I wanted it to be something you could eat, at least.”
“Hey,” Steve whispered against Tony’s skin, taking hold of Tony’s wrist to stop him. “Let’s keep that on, for now.”
Anthony Stark was a tallish, thinnish man. His cheeks were sunken, but only slightly; he looked hollow those days, more hollow than he used to. His mustache wasn’t as neat as he usually kept it, his hair mussed. Needless to say, he didn’t look quite like himself.
in his tone. That was the way it was, though. Wasn't it? It wasn't a feeling. It wasn't a fleeting thought, nor was it a loosely held belief that fluttered in and out of his mind like anything else. It was a fact of life.
He couldn't see the familiar fog creep in through the blurriness of his tear-filled eyes. When he collapsed this time, there was no warning.
“Seriously, what do you do to me?” Tony leaned against Steve’s side, reaching over his arm to flip to the next page. “You make me skinnier, don’t you?”
“Mm.” Tony turned to face Steve, then, weakly pulling the blanket an inch or two further up his body. Steve took the edge of it, pulled it up harder, tucked it around Tony’s shoulders more comfortably. “Wake me up in half an hour?”
“Alright,” Tony agreed. “I’m in charge of the delete-y thingy.”
Tony made no effort to quicken his pace to reach it.
Carol met Steve's eyes, giving him her best reassuring smile.
When was it worth it to stop fighting?
It was the love without the attention, Steve thought. Except this time, it was all the love he could hope for centralized in the body of the one man whose attention he was lucky enough to hold for a few moments. He still couldn’t believe it, sometimes, when Tony turned his gaze onto him and held it there thoughtfully.
“You have any, uh… Anything you want to do, in particular?”
The time he woke up after that, they'd have his legs fixed firmly to the wall. He'd struggle still, and with each act of rebellion, he was restricted even further, until he'd wake up completely and utterly immobilized, only able to scan the room and the faces of those working on him. He couldn't even open his mouth to speak, and for them, that was for the better.
“You were playing hard to get. You
Tony Stark. Iron Man. Red and gold and beautiful. He landed in front of Steve, his faceplate lifting the second the tip of his first boot touched the ground, and the icy blue of his eyes nearly sent Steve into shock. His jaw was sharp, and the bags under his eyes were more pronounced than ever. His facial hair wasn't as neatly trimmed as it normally was, and his cheeks were hollower than they used to be.
He thought something must have been wrong with him. Maybe he
Tony took a deep breath, squeezing one of Steve's hands in his own as he considered it.
Ever the gentleman, he
would be the one to master time travel. When I first got here, I half thought he
Steve shifted his weight from foot to foot, his gaze downcast as he picked at the edges of the bag with his thumb. Tony felt guilt settle like a stone in his chest, felt the pain of his nerves stretching and twisting to accommodate it. He pushed, didn’t he? He pushed too much. Crossed a line.
Steve took a deep, probably audible breath and started on his way to Marshall. Before he could get to the guy, Tony’s voice shocked him out of his focus.
Blue faded into the background. It just
It’s not. It’s not over 18 ounces in weight, the barrel barely longer than the grip. It holds eight rounds, seven of which aren’t necessary now and might never be. It all depends on what the others do when they find it, on whether or not another round will fire when it’s dropped, on whether it’ll be labeled “evidence” or something else, something to be inherited.
“Could be something,” he answered, his voice a touch softer than it had been.
Still, he liked to have them. It was nice to have pockets.
"I'd like to go to bed with you, Tony," Steve said, more softly. He still wasn't quite... all there, and he was sure it showed, but that was alright. Along with basic human decency, of course, it was that same fact of life- they were home to each other- that made it so easy for Tony to understand.
He gets up, hands still trembling as he picks the gun up off the floor. It’s unclear in what direction it shot, and Tony’s not really of the mind to be finding bullet holes in the walls. He clicks the safety on himself, gaze lingering on the trigger for a moment too long before he shoves the whole thing a little too hard back into the nightstand, shutting the drawer.
“Alright, Tony. We’ll see  you at the debrief.”
leather?” Steve asked.
His only respite was when he was returned to his room in between their tests and their experiments, though it could hardly be called a respite after long.
When was it worth it to stop fighting?
He wrapped his fingers around Steve’s length, stroking once, twice. Steve’s soft huff of a response was enough to urge Tony on further, and he slid out of Steve’s lap, shifting to half-lay between Steve’s legs with his weight on his elbows. A hand came to rest in his hair, fingers appreciatively massaging his scalp as he licked up Steve’s length from base to tip. He was practiced enough; it would be easy to go through the motions, to follow the same trial and error he always did with a new partner. This, though, seemed too sweet to be formulaic. He was too desperate for this, too desperate to make Steve happy, to make Steve
There was something about the way they had him rigged to the table that allowed them to turn him onto his stomach with ease, and, being Not Steve Rogers and Not Quite Alive, he allowed them to do so with no issue. He wasn't really there. It wasn't really happening. It was nothing but a moment that would pass, and there would be more moments to come.
The fluorescent overhead lights never turned off. The room only seemed to get more blindingly white as days passed, and though Steve could at least find solace in the pinkish tone of his skin in the beginning, the contrast seemed less and less stark as time went on. Everything became horribly flat, and he wondered if he'd mourn the loss of the world's vibrancy more or less if he wasn’t an artist at heart.
The bartender set Tony’s drink on the counter in front of him, and Steve, without speaking, casually slid it toward himself. Tony raised a brow, reaching to take it back.
One more time, he dug his nails in and dragged harshly down, and lines of red began to follow. Red like Tony. Red like silk. Red like lace.
He just didn’t want Tony to see it and—
“Steve?”
“Take a seat at the bar. Let him come to you. This is coming from one mega-rich guy with secrets; it’s less suspicious if you can let him think he’s in charge.”
met Steve’s eyes- for the first time since their meeting. What he found was impossible to decipher. Steve stared back at him, brows furrowed ever so slightly, expression fixed but neutral.
Steve shifted awkwardly, taking a seat on the edge of the bed. He lightly ran the pad of his index finger over his nail, gaze focused on that small, repetitive movement as Jan and Tony spoke. They weren’t getting terribly heated, but they were both prone to talking a lot, and Steve
“I gave him supreme power over the
him.”
“Well, I can’t say I’ve ever brewed my own beer, but. Looks nice enough. Can’t say the fittedness’ll feel any different from my dress greens.”
Steve made a habit of checking up on Tony. Those same enhanced senses that allowed him to hear Tony’s tinkering all hours of the night also enabled him to smell quite well; he could sense variations in blood, though he wasn’t practiced nor educated enough to be able to pin down exactly what might be wrong with it. He wasn’t a
“Lord, you really know how to flatter a guy, don’t you?” Tony replied sardonically. He slid out of bed as well, kneeling down beside Steve with his hands loosely laid in his lap.
“Uh-huh. Cap, take a look at this.” Tony held up a nice, bright dress shirt with a watercolor-like sunflower pattern. It was sweet-looking, almost out of place in the dimly lit hotel room with the moon and the stars in the backdrop behind them. It seemed apt for the outdoors, for a brighter, warmer day.
There was an antagonist in the equation. It wasn’t the Avengers. It wasn’t him.
Perhaps preemptively, Tony found himself mourning the night they could have spent together. If barely-earned grief was a pool, he was just dipping his toes in when Steve interrupted him:
The thought might have made him sick, if he still felt like Steve Rogers. He wasn't anymore. Not there, at least. He'd either die there- unlikely, because of course the team was coming for him, of course they were- or he'd find his home once again, and he'd be able to ask himself questions that meant more than jack shit again. He'd be able to think thoughts that mattered. He'd be able to live.
sentiment seemed to dwindle more with each moment they spent together.
Tony watched as Steve reached into his pocket, fumbling through its contents for a moment before pulling out something rectangular and shiny— shiny-ish, at least, in the way worn things tended to be. It was a little tin, the design on its top faded at the corners. It featured a nice woman on its front, sitting calmly with her legs to her side; her hair was short and poofy, her expression barely there. THREE ORIGINAL DUBLE-TIP PROPHYLATICS, the tin read, though some of the letters were lost with wear.
Steve felt read, too open, too seen.
, no more complicated than that. It wasn't as if Tony's curiosity had been stamped down completely-- quite the contrary, in fact, as his relentless drive to learn more, learn better, learn quicker overtook him. It just happened to be... put to better things, in the end. He could certainly put a twist on his projects, just to keep them interesting, but they were ultimately for people more deserving than him of the freedom required to ask trivial questions and treat their answers with the utmost importance, day after day after day.
“I can see that.”
Steve didn’t push it. He simply slipped the coat on himself, though he knew he didn’t need so much warmth. If Tony needed it, Steve would have it on hand.
“Tony,” he warned lightly.
Tony lay back again, shifting downward on the bed so he could take advantage of the pillows he’d placed before. His gaze was fixed to the ceiling, expression inscrutable.
Steve ran his thumb over the edge of his cuff, tearing his eyes away from Tony.
"Could we go to bed, Tony?"
Steve heard quite a bit through the night. He had half the mind to ask Tony to quiet down in the beginning, but as the months passed, he found comfort in the tinkering, the footsteps, and even the occasional flickering of candlelight illuminating the gap underneath his doorway as Tony made his way through the halls of the mansion.
“Yeah.” Tony’s voice was quiet, then. When he looked back up at Steve, he offered a small smile. It was nervous, but it was a smile nonetheless.
Tony, having mustered up the courage to reach up on his own— to be more than a passive party in this— pulled at the edge of Steve’s tee.
“What are we watching again?” Tony asked, dropping heavily onto the couch beside Steve. Steve was a wall of a man, unmoving even with the deep shift in the weight of the cushion, and Tony found it easy enough to lean against him. Steve, in response, bumped his side with an elbow, his eyes still trained on the television as he fiddled with the remote.
His hand rested on the doorknob for a few seconds of quiet, the shock of the sound having kick-started his brain. It felt as if, suddenly, his mind was alight, buzzing anxiously with what-ifs. Worst case scenario, someone had found him and Steve out, and they were coming to— Lord, he didn’t even know what they’d be coming to do, but they were coming to do it. Best case (and most likely) scenario, it was a housekeeper who forgot to say “housekeeping.”
Tony stayed often.

fellas go off to fight.”
And then, for the first time in quite a long time, he felt.
— food, water, shelter, temperature control, fresh air. He didn’t want to give Tony the bare minimum. He wanted to bring drinks, meals, warmth, breath.
"Could we repaint the walls?" he asked. "Something nice? Something warm?"
The silence was cut as Tony pushed open the door to Harry’s New York Bar, a familiarly styled joint that had been relocated from the States just a couple of decades prior. He wasn’t opposed to more authentic local watering holes, but the friend he was planning to meet insisted he would be more comfortable here. He supposed he’d make the most of it. It wasn’t unpleasant.
“Didn’t get a chance to find where he kept the computer. Any ideas?”
Steve was. Always. Sure, he was out of his depth here, and sure, he’d never been a
In the fridge was a glass tupperware with already-cut lemon slices. It was a nice little touch, Steve thought— something Tony mentioned once upon a time, something that made him feel less like he was having a nurse come in to fill up his ‘thirst’ meter and more like he was staying at a luxury hotel with butler service. He said it like a joke, and mostly, it was.
He took the sketchbook from Steve’s loose grasp, staring down at the image it portrayed. A man— Tony Stark— sat loosely against the side of a bed in the early hours of the  morning, his robe half-slipping off of him and his knee bent to hold onto. His head was tilted downward, his eyes peering up fondly at the man with the pencil who’d sat behind the sketchbook as he was drawn. A mess of hair on his head stuck out in funny places, and there was a tiredness to the expression on his face that was sweet, content. It was messy and beautiful and tender in ways Tony didn’t think he could be.
“Aye, Panther, for I do sense that we are truly of one mind!” Thor, in contrast, was  boisterous. He took up space and used it well. He reminded Steve of friends he’d made among the soldiers he’d fought with— after a few drinks, at least. His voice held the kind of warmth one might feel after having a drink themselves. “Though the Black Night was not one of us when he struck, we now should make him so!”
Steve’s hair was styled like he would have fixed it decades ago. He knew Tony liked the look of it, the shape of it, how
Steve let out a huff of a laugh. He swirled the liquid in his glass again, more quickly this time, as if the movement itself was agitating. “You really know how to make a guy feel wanted.”
Steve, bless him, knew exactly what to do with that. Or maybe Tony was just easy, and Steve could have done anything to him and it wouldn’t have made a difference.
Tony was loose and pliable by the time Steve set his pencil down again, fully at ease.
“Hey, there,” Marshall said. “This seat taken?”
It was normal and yet better, somehow. Freer.
Steve watched him. Stared.
about how angular and- and shapeless his life had become until he caught a glimpse of Sam's gorgeous intricate wings and the delicately recreated feathers at the end of Hawkeye's arrows in his weathered quiver.
The man looked bright and spirited and well-loved, and the lines that had seemed sloppy before looked nervous now, as if their creator had been fighting with himself to get them right.
, and if it was lacking in this pigment, people often said it was
“What’ve you got time for?” he mumbled against Steve’s cheek.
closer, lean in closer, put a hand on Tony's shoulder and take one more step toward him, get close enough so Tony could look, so he could investigate (harmlessly, of course-- don't dig too deep, don't look too hard, let it be what it is). If only Tony could get a closer look-- at Steve's eyes, at Steve's body, at Steve's heart, at Steve's everything-- then he'd start to understand.
He stood, straightening one leg after another to get the blood flowing, and headed to the bathroom to wash up. Too exhausted to properly brush his teeth, he gargled a small cup of mouthwash, resting a flat palm on the bathroom counter to steady himself.
“I don’t do anything, Tony, I just draw what I see.”
“Freudian slip. Happens to us all, Tony, but—”
“Given how hard you are right now after almost nothing, Steve, I don’t think there’s anything you could say to me to convince me you don’t already have one.”
Because that’s the kind of person Tony is, isn’t he? Deluding himself into thinking he’s a man to clean up his own messes, ignorant to the plights of those who follow in the wake of his destruction, irradiated and disfigured by his mistakes.
“A drink,” Tony responded, his casual tone effortless in a practiced way and wholly unnatural.
“Okay.”
"Avengers," she started. Clint unsheathed an arrow from his quiver, and the lethal expression in his eyes twisted into something more eager. He glanced at Carol, who offered him an understanding nod. "Let's blow the shit out of this place."
He didn't want to come home broken. He couldn't imagine how Tony must have felt, losing Steve for so long. He was probably worrying himself sick. Steve had seen him worry over other missing heroes; he barely slept, he barely ate, and he barely took the time to consider himself as a person until his functionality was impaired enough to impact his search. Steve couldn't blame him. He would be the same if Tony had up and disappeared (if that was even what happened-- again, Steve really didn't know
The thought makes him feel sicker than he did before.
“His uniform!”
“Here,” Steve interrupted, rolling over the compliment like he didn’t know quite what to do with it. He took the book out of Tony’s hands, his own grip trembling just enough for Tony to notice. He flipped the pages himself, Tony watching his eyes as he did; his irises shook like his fingers, darting across pages as he skimmed over his own work.
“That’s, uh.” The stranger turned his head a fraction of an inch more, and Tony caught a glimpse of his eyes, deep blue with a bit of a twinkle. “That’s classified.”
Tony half-laughed, half-scoffed, pulling away the tiniest bit to take in Steve’s expression again. Steve’s grin was still plastered on his face, though not quite as intense as before. Tony couldn’t find it in himself, then, to make a comment. He just rolled his eyes fondly, settling back and focusing on the movie instead.
“So good. You’re a doll, Tony.”
, or,
That day, he happened to be wearing cotton; it was thin cotton, though, pliable and almost modern-looking despite the nigh Edwardian aesthetic Tony seemed to have adopted for himself. His dark black vest was patterned over a red dress shirt, a light tailcoat pulled over both. He wore a dark tie tucked into his vest, and- as mentioned- those bright white gloves made of what Steve could only imagine to be the finest fabric available. They clung to his skin so closely that Steve was sure he could draw Tony’s naked hands even then, and yet there was a pleasant ruffle at the wrists where the fabric bunched together, the edges pushed closer to the base of his hand by the cuff of his coat.
how they did.
“Shh, baby, movie.” Steve settled back against the couch, pressing ‘play’ on the remote. He stretched, letting his arm fall over the back of the couch. Tony wasted no time taking advantage of that, leaning back against Steve’s bicep.
and sometimes, cheekily,
Had Steve been in their position (he wouldn't be), he would have thought of that before anyone actually had to get hurt. It was almost amusing that they seemed to be hopeful about his level of obedience. It wasn't like his rebellious nature was news to anyone; his husband had mentioned it countless times, and even the fucking United States Government was aware of it. Sure, maybe the common citizen might have an idea of Captain America that was more sterilized, but Hydra? Really?
With a sigh, Tony said, “Yeah, I can honeypot. Been a while since I’ve felt a guy up,” and Steve’s chest tightened.
He looked at Tony- the real Tony, standing in front of him with his face covered in shade and his skin light as ever- and Tony looked back, and they shared a smile.
of them had, at one point, been in contact with a—
“I was kidding. It’s— Everyone has their own preferences, dear, c’mon.”
“You didn’t say dom,” Jan chimed in. “And you’re not, sweetie, I’m so sorry. You’re a dear.”
“Yeah, I’ve got Jan on standby. We planned for that.”
He didn’t realize how hard he was until Steve touched him. It was almost painful, too much, but Steve continued on. He wrapped his hand loosely around Tony’s hard-on, thumb gently caressing under the head, and began to stroke him.
Steve smiled, pocketing his little notebook and resting his thumbs in the waistband of his pajama pants. “There’s no better company I could ask for, Shellhead.”
He sits on the edge of his bed, sweatpants wrinkled and a little heavy with the sweat of the week’s nightmares and torso uncomfortably bare, given the circumstances. He hasn’t had the chest plate in quite a while, yet he still wonders how he braves each day without it. He’s woken up a handful of times, bare like he is now, having deluded himself into panic and labored breathing before realizing how far past all that he is.
He wasn’t one for bold costumes, and it was clear enough in the way he’d been dressed for the party that his input mattered little when it came to the final result. Jan had dressed him in a loose pair of slacks, some casual slippers, and a fancy red robe as if he were a Casanova. He’d had a prop pipe hanging from between his lips near the beginning of the party, but it had been stuffed into his pocket ever since he made friends with the mozzarella sticks on one end of the buffet table. He wouldn’t say he “stuffed his face” with them, but in all fairness, he wouldn’t say he’d dress like a Casanova, either. Yet, there he was.
The mansion the next night was quieter than normal; everyone seemed to be recovering from the exhaustion of the day prior. Steve understood, but couldn’t quite empathize— he felt more awake, more alive, almost buzzing with the feeling of a job well done.
He’d stopped, then, at an image hanging up of the Avengers in the main room of the building, just above the fireplace. It was sweet and homely, somewhat matching the feelings that blossomed in Steve’s own chest. He always felt that sense of not-quite-nostalgia after inducting a new recruit; there was some feeling of
When was it worth it to stop fighting?
“Just—” His hips twitched, his words coming to a brief, stuttering stop. “Just make me come, please.”
Red like Tony.
“Can I do anything for you?” he pushed himself to ask.
“What do you mean, no offense?”
Steve had no way of knowing. He was completely unaware of the circumstances of his kidnapping- he wasn't totally immune to mind-altering drugs of a high enough dosage, and it wasn't like he was invincible. You could likely manage to drag him off if you hit him hard enough to knock him down. The problems tended to arise when he woke up.
It’s not, Tony thinks. He wants it to be. He wants it to be the most selfish thing, because he doesn’t want
Tony’s response came quick, too confident. He’d given the same spiel many times before. “Oh, you know. Good friends. Had a bit to drink. Maybe we’re French— you know how it is. Besides, we’ve been here for how long, now? If anyone was going to notice you, you’d think they’d have done it by now.”
