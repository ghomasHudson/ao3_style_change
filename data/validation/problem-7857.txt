Tony smiled, probably guessing that Steve was reacting to the suggestion, however, his face turned more serious after a moment. “But you never confirmed what I suggested before. Last night when I said you were versatile, that was an assumption. Do you want to switch roles at some point? Is there something that you want try?”
It was early evening on a Sunday in the first week of December as Tony walked along the sidewalk. The chill of the air was getting cooler as the sun continued to sink. He was returning home with a box of ornaments for the Christmas tree they’d gotten that morning. This year he’d decided that they needed new ornaments to add to their usual tinsel and garland. It was their third Christmas together, after all.
The door opened and there stood Mr. Byrne. Tony would never be friendly enough with him to use his first name. “What…oh, it’s you.” The man looked disgusted.
“Well, you’re right about that,” Dugan said as he clapped a hand on Bucky’s shoulder. The anger gone as quickly as it had come and the jovial smile back on his face. “I guess it’s up to you to get the job. Wouldn’t mind calling you Sarge, Barnes.”
Tony understood where he was coming from. This was a nicer place than the boys were used to. Not extravagant, but it was certainly nicer than average. Tony just nodded. “I’ve already taken care of everything.”
However, when Steve had come out of his bathroom, pink skinned and nearly naked, it had sent a lot of confusing feelings through him, and Bucky had almost lost his nerve to be there at the sight of it. But he’d assigned himself a mission, he wasn’t going to let that get sabotaged by his damaged brain and the weird thoughts he was having. Putting his discomfort aside had been worth it because his mission was a success. He’d done it. He’d gotten Steve to talk to him.
“You and your mouth, Barnes, I swear,” Tony said as he got up and brought their plates to the sink. “You could talk a nun into doing burlesque. Damn, I almost forgot the wine!”
‘You’re right.” Tony said to calm them so he could explain himself. “But I had to speak with him after the threat he made. I couldn’t risk something happening to you, to us.”
“We’re not there yet,” Steve said. “We’re not there in our memories. We’d just gotten equipped at SSR headquarters and were getting ready to leave London to go back to the front. This looks just like that film at the Smithsonian exhibit. JARVIS, when did this change happen to the original footage?”
control yourself.”
“Too late.” Tony began, trying to work his voice into a smooth crooning sound.
“Buck,” Steve shot a warning look at the other man.
**Avenger’s Tower Bucky’s POV**
They were meant to be together, to fight side by side through life and the battles that came with it. Once they found Bucky, they would be complete again, a finished puzzle.
How Pepper had stuck with him throughout these years was a mystery. Tony was certain she must dye her hair that lovely shade of red because he knew he’d probably turned it gray with stress years ago. He was lucky she’d given him a chance at love, the first real taste of love he’d ever known. Even though he’d ruined things between them pretty spectacularly, he’d still always be grateful for their time together.
Tony’s brain shorted out because now it was just too much.
“Because I know Abraham Erskine, and I know he was there that night.” Tony answered, surprising Steve even more.
want to talk about it?”
“Merry Christmas.” They both copied and sipped at their eggnog with him. It was good. Rich and sweet with the smooth bourbon giving a slight burn as it went down. They stayed quiet for a while and enjoyed their drinks as the music played in the background. The alcohol relaxing and warming them after the walk in the cold evening air.
Their breathing was ragged as they both laid there recovering. The heat of Tony’s skin beneath him was comforting as Steve lifted his head to find Tony’s eyes.
Bucky lay still and tried to train his eyes in the darkness. The only source of light streamed in from narrow windows above them. The soft, cool quality of it told him it was night, but he seriously doubted it was the same night he’d been captured. His mouth had that grungy feeling of sleeping for too long. Had they drugged them for transport? Still, he was finally able to take in the room around him.
“So, Buck,” Steve said, “are you going to actually introduce me and Tony to your pals, or do I have to pull rank?”
Steve looked up from the pan he was tending to and smiled. “You’re just in time.”
Steve nodded. “Good, then I’d like to try that. Eventually.”
“Good choices, all. And I totally get that now that I know Thor. It could be his theme song. I should play it while he fights. It would go well with the lightening.” Tony mused. He turned to their silent companion and asked, “What about you, Robocop?”
Steve sighed. “That’s not the problem, Buck, and now isn’t the time for this conversation.”
Howard had been livid when he’d found Tony and his boyfriend fooling around in Tony’s room. He’d sent Tony away the next day, early enrollment at a new school.
This is one of my favorite chapters. The boys deserve some holiday fluff. They do say Merry Christmas because Steve and Bucky are Irish Catholic. I still snuck in some plot advancement and character development.
We finally learn why JARVIS has seemed to take a softer, caring role for Bucky. It was the reason he allowed Bucky into Tony's locked lab. He was trying to help him as Tony instructed. Artificial Life has always fascinated me in fiction, though the thought of it kind of scares me in real life. Human beings can be frightening enough.
“Yes and no,” Bucky answered. “It’s probably not important, but I thought you might want to know. Because science and stuff… What Thor said is happening. I don’t think Tony can die, not from an accident anyway.”
Somehow they always managed to get by. Through cut work hours and bouts of pneumonia that James had sworn he’d thought would finally be the end of Steve, they’d survived. Together.
Steve’s face was full of understanding. “So, we’ll do it together?”
She blushed but looked delighted. “I’m sure your day would have been just as nice without it.” She really had a sweet way about her.
“So, Tony,” Gabe asked beside him, “what’s your rank? I mean, I know you said sidekick, but you’re not in uniform. Are you the Captain’s Lieutenant? How do we address you?”
She’d been alone when he found her, standing by herself in the back of an almost empty hallway and staring at a file that he was quite sure she wasn’t really reading. She seemed lost in her thoughts until she noticed his approach and looked up. Surprise filtered onto her face to find him there with her. “Mr. Stark, how can I help you?”
narcissistic,” Steve mused, “when you’re so much smarter than everyone around you. It’s gotta be tiring sometimes, feeling like you have to wait for everyone to catch up.”
There was a knock at the door. Steve and James were still looking too stunned for words so Tony went and answered. It was the delivery boy from the butcher shop. “Excellent! Bring it through here.” As he led the boy to the kitchen, Steve and James hadn’t moved. “Just set it down there.” He pointed to the nearly overloaded little table.
“Ok, you’ve proven that you’re very romantic. Now open the letter.” Steve was trying hard not to seem affected by Tony’s attention, but the pink tint to his cheeks and the curve of his lips told another story.
“Of course, Tony.” Erskine answered with a smile before turning to Howard. “I will come by again tomorrow, and we can go over the data from the generator test together if that works for you, Mr. Stark?”
Suddenly, Bucky didn’t know why he’d chosen to come here. There was no reason for him to be here, and JARVIS had to know that. Still, something inside him wanted to enter the room behind this door, whether he was allowed or not.
. Tony thought savagely.
“And you’re not alone,” Steve added. “We’ll help. We’ll do this together.”
Bucky let out a long moan around Steve.
“I gave you a chance to set the pace,” he bit into Steve’s shoulder, making the blonde try to muffle his shout in a pillow before he released the flesh from his teeth, “but now I’m just going to use you how I want, soldier.”
***Bucky POV***
He grabbed Tony by the waist and pulled him down, impaling the man on his cock. Tony choked as his eyes rolled back, but Steve couldn’t bring himself to stop now. It was liked a dam had broken. He sat up and easily used his arms to fuck Tony, moving him up and down almost violently, and Tony moaned and cursed breathlessly the whole time as he held onto Steve’s shoulder’s like his life depended on it.
He soon moved on to the second finger, working Steve open as he scissored and fucked both of them into his tight ass.
Tony’s voice was icy to his own ears. “I’ve had just about enough of you and your shit, asshole. Say one more thing about him, and you’ll wake up bleeding in the gutter like the trash you are.”
begun to care for the two other men.
Also, I know, our poor boys, but it was inevitable. The version of himself Bucky remembered being would have some serious issues with everything Bucky has done and gone through. And we know that even in the best of times in the past, Bucky was always ready to believe that something was wrong with him. But yay Steve! He's so supportive! And look at the other Avengers stepping up and coming together. Sigh, I can't wait to finally be able able to tag, Avengers as Family. That one's for you Natasha.
It seemed as though Philips was also jockeying to be on Tony’s list as the man shredded Steve’s self-worth and dreams in just a few sentences. Honestly, Tony wondered how the man could be so thick-headed. What Steve had done today proved that he should be given a chance to fight, but the man had completely dismissed him. Tony watched it all from his corner where he was ignored.
“The man’s an ass, Steve!” Tony huffed, using one of Bucky’s favorite phrases. He shut his eyes against the annoying light the lamp was assaulting him with. Aahh, that was better. The darkness was just what his migraine ordered.
Right now Steve was failing both of them.
Steve’s mom had died when he was sixteen leaving him orphaned. James had moved out of his parents’ house the day after the funeral. Tony had gotten the impression that there was no love lost between him and his father. James’s family had moved to Buffalo not long after, though he still writes to his mom and sister.
Bucky turned to Steve and nuzzled his head into the blonde’s chest seeking comfort. “I can’t talk about it yet, what I remembered, what set me off. I promise I will because I know I’ll have to, but only to you. Then, to Tony when he gets back. If I’m ever gonna have a piece of what I lost, you’re going to have to know.”
They didn’t need to use knives or their fists when that drug hurt just as badly as anything he’d imagined, but they’d never asked one question. Eventually, he realized that this wasn’t torture, it was experimentation. He was a lab rat. Through the worst of the pain, he would try to recite his service number. Not because they’d asked, but because it gave him something else to focus on when he wasn’t screaming.
“Dugan,” Bucky told him, finally meeting his eyes. “Timothy Dugan.”
He looked up beaming to see their stunned expressions.
“Are you complaining?” Bucky asked petulantly and raised an eyebrow.
“Of the show,” Tony corrected. “He’s in charge of putting together the show. He is not the boss of you. Don’t forget that. He can’t fire you or punish you, not with Senator What’s His Name fangirling over you.”
They waited until the guard had turned to face away and begin his walk back in the other direction. Then, Steve stealthily crept up behind the man and delivered a blow to the back of his head. The body fell onto the top of a cage, and Tony moved forward as Steve bent down to retrieve the keys from the guard’s belt.
Once that was done, Tony stepped forward and signed for everything. “Any charges for service or meals will be taken care of by me. Just add it my account.”
“We got another letter from Bucky today.” Steve said, changing the entire mood of the conversation.
“It says you’re trying to talk your way out of answering my question.” Steve said. “What will you give me for the letter.”
He gave Steve a similar kiss, lightly tracing his tongue along the younger man’s bottom lip. As he pulled back, he murmured, “However, there’s only one thing that I
Steve took an unsteady breath. “Not all of us can drive a beach…”
Bruce’s smile was full of compassion as he told Bucky, “I’m glad it’s not upsetting you anymore, and that you are able to appreciate what this is giving you.”
his words. “So strong. And good. And smart. Such a good soldier. The best soldier. You’re gonna prove everyone wrong.” He could feel Steve tightening around him, which was good because Tony was struggling to keep himself together. “I
Arc reactor, Previous Status: Desired Technological Asset, Objective Level: High
It turns out Bucky could. His instructions were easy to follow, and he moved effortlessly through the steps, showing Tony exactly how to let his partner know what he wanted them to do.
“It’s more of a curse than blessing, really.” Tony said, uncharacteristically humble. “My mind never stops, and I have almost no natural social skills, I’ve had to learn to fake my way through those for most of my life. I’m also told it’s made me narcissistic, and that I don’t play well with others.” He chuckled.
“You don’t say,” Bucky said dryly before shaking his head. “Looking back, I used to think Tony was crazy for indulging you, but now I know that he just knew better than to argue. I don’t think I ever learned how to do that.”
Steve stepped forward and carefully wrapped his arms around Tony. It was a lot tighter than a normal person would embrace another, and Tony could feel the power that was barely being held in check, but it was still in Steve’s control. Tony wouldn’t have cared if he bruised or cracked something anyway. It would heal and was worth it that Steve was trusting himself and trying.
“I fail to comprehend how you can even get that fat head of yours to fit through the door!” Tony all but yelled. “You honestly can’t admit to the fact that you might be wrong and that this needs more testing!”
“What security?” Bucky finally asked. He’d tried to stay quiet and let Steve handle this, but Tony guessed that he’d reached his limit. “What does changing your name have to do with security?”
He looked across the room at Bruce from where he was laying in a recovery bed. Two hours ago both he and Bucky had collapsed at the Sanctum where’d they’d been searching for Tony. The good news was that they had probably found him. The bad news was that if they hadn’t, he and Bucky were either crazy or under the influence of a spell. Steve would probably be more upset about it normally, but Bruce had given him enough Xanax and pain meds to kill a horse.
Tony had given him that little name, and if someone had once told him he’d like being called baby boy by anyone, Steve would have punched ‘em in the jaw. But when Tony said it, well, Steve had to admit that he liked it a lot more than he thought he would, like when Bucky called him doll.
“I needed to rest.” Tony soothed him. “I’m not denying that I was injured and needed rest, but they kept pumping me full of morphine and God knows what else to keep me asleep.”
Tony felt the nails of Steve’s other hand dig into his side while the one in his hair pulled Tony tighter against him, and he slowly began to swivel his hips. “Keep your tongue out.” He ordered, then began to use Tony’s face for his own pleasure.
“Do you still love him, Steve?” Bucky asked, needing to know for some reason. It wasn’t really his business, but he would be happy for his former partners if they found each other again. It was still strange to worry about the happiness of other people, but he knew he wanted them to be happy.
“That’s close enough for me,” she said. “It’s somewhere to start. Hopefully, there will be more to find as the day passes. Pull up everything you have on the Howling Commandos with regards to the name Anthony Sutton.”
This was…Tony couldn’t even acknowledge the thought in his mind. It was ridiculous.
“Bucky…”
Secondly, I had always debated on flashing back to the present with the team after Tony disappeared. I had always planned on it being a surprise for both the readers and Tony, then I received a comment asking about it. I told them the same thing I just said. After I finished with my replies, I thought about it, and this scene sprang to life. I had to write it down because it practically wrote itself. When I was finished, I was so glad I did because I loved the contrast of Steve and Bucky to what we'd gotten used to. So thank you Zola! You awakened my muse!
Bucky hastily turned over to his back and shoved a pillow under his tailbone. He was panting and his hands gripped at the sheet beneath them, trying to be good and wait. Tony decided to reward him.
“There she is,” Tony muttered confusing Steve again. How did Tony know Agent Carter was here?
Steve smiled as he cut out the first slice. “Blueberry. It’s your favorite, right?”
“That is fine, Tony.” Erskine assured him. “I only need for you to meet with him a few times before the project is underway.”
Steve looked to the other soldiers that had gathered and were waiting. Steve reached down and pulled up the now destroyed transponder. No way Tony was going to be able to fix this much damage in the middle of nowhere. Even if he could, they couldn’t afford the time it would take. The other men waited as they watched him look at the useless equipment.
,” Steve had chuckled quietly. “
“Thank you, JARVIS.” Bucky said softly.
For their one year anniversary, Steve had been hospitalized with the flu. Tony had never felt so helpless as he watched Steve’s body slowly fail him. The fever burned too hot for him to take, and he’d eventually been unable to wake. The doctor had actually told them to prepare for his passing and send for the priest. Tony had almost punched the man. He eventually realized that he should have given Steve more credit. His baby boy was fighter to the core.
“There you are, Sweetheart.” It was his Tony, and he looked so happy. Had Bucky made him happy? He liked that thought even as he continued to shiver. “You’re OK, now. Steve and I are right here.”
His own voice kept echoing those same sentences through his mind, and Bucky most certainly tried to push them away. It was too much and too foreign, and he was too damaged to handle this. Far too damaged for too long, and it scared the hell out of him. He’d just become a person, a shitty one at that, but he was finally becoming a person. He didn’t know if he could be Bucky,
*****
“Whom.” He corrected out of habit. “Someone I’ve seen at the grocery a few times. Louise Selby.”
Steve looked down at Bucky’s red eyes, knowing his weren’t any better. “Yeah, love. They were blue and silver.”
“You were captured by enemies? Were you a soldier?”
As the big band music began to play, Bucky closed his eyes and breathed in the smell of his partner. This was one of their songs. They’d danced countless times to it together in their old, tiny apartment. Tony would softly sing the words in his ear as he held him closely, and now, Bucky knew it for what it was. Tony was making him a promise. Bucky’s eyes grew wet even as he smiled softly. Tony always kept his promises.
“Tony,” he began more softly than usual, “do you know why I am the way I am? It’s not like…You said it wasn’t unusual.”
It was desperate and pathetic of him, he knew that, but he had to hear it. He had to.
” Tony shot back.
Tony has a surprise planned for the boys. It's really sweet. The boys have a surprise planned for Tony. It's really spicy. Also, a surprise POV.
Steve sighed. “You’re such a jerk, Buck.”
He nodded happily, pleased that Bucky had put it together. “You can see his problem. I go to Ryan and tell him what Byrne has been doing. He beats the ever loving shit out of him. Then what can Byrne do? Spread a rumor about his neighbor who sold him out? I would just say that I was helping a friend and told him the truth about the guy screwing his wife. No one would believe that Byrne wasn’t just trying to get back at me, and they’d hate him even more for it.”
Tony’s head was spinning. This was a huge moment and was far more than he’d expected to get. Hell, he’d been prepared to beg and fight and blame and shame the man in front of him just to get a piece of this. But he still needed more. “I’ll absolutely take you up on that, Colonel.”
“But you still did.” Tony yawned. “Yes, you still have some things to relearn and adjust to, but it seems to me that most of those things are finer motor skills: buttons, zippers, glassware and utensils, pencils. You’ll get there. Now shush and let me sleep. I have to be up early to sneak out of this damn room, and someone just fucked me into the mattress.”
“A collection of Disney short films, I think.” Tony answered. “I saw some of the posters had Donald Duck.”
do it. It shouldn’t take you more than eight or ten hours to go through the calculations by yourself, determine if the wires can handle the current and readjust the resistor to the exact specifications needed to make the machine safe and functional. If you’re as smart as you say, it should be finished by the time I get here tomorrow morning, right?”
Tony prayed this would be enough, that their love would somehow defeat everything, that he would be able to keep them.
He wondered if Steve was experiencing another download of information too. Probably, he figured. After Dr. Banner’s explanation of what was happening to them and Thor’s big reveal, most of the team had went off to search for help, looking for that Strange guy or anyone else who might have some information about magic. He and Steve had been benched and were not allowed to leave the tower at the moment.
Bucky groaned above him as he ground his hips against Tony’s face and went even deeper. Tony’s eyes had already begun to water from the deep throating he was giving him, but as Bucky pushed further he felt the first tear fall.
Bucky was panting, trying to catch his breath as he processed everything. “Fuck,” he breathed.
Tony motioned to the chilled water on their table. “We’re fine with this for now, but could you bring a bottle of your house red so it can breathe before the food arrives?”
Tony chuckled. “Yes, I do.” He started toward the bedroom to grab a nice change of clothes. “But you have to admit it’s kind of touching that he cares so much, especially since I’m about eighty percent sure he knows about us.” Tony thought on that number. “Eh, make that eighty-seven point five percent sure.”
Bucky tried to keep his voice light. “The 107th. Sgt. James Barnes shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.” It was a small consolation that he’d succeeded in earning the rank of sergeant after all his hard work.
Bucky's terror is very understandable as it also showcases their neighbors cruelty at threatening to help send them there. For me, it's even sadder when I think of how Bucky's ultimate fate was to land in the hands of similarly cruel men. Knowing this, I don't think Tony's reaction was too extreme. If faced with the alternative, I'd rather risk a prison sentence for murder as a heterosexual man than find myself in one of those places labeled as an invert. In my mind it's self defense, and he is also protecting Steve and Bucky.
Bucky watched as all his friends stood open-mouthed at the crazy-wonderful man that was his boyfriend. It was so like Tony, and Bucky ached as he realized just how much he’d missed him. Tony had already adopted these men as his family, and he was trying to take care of them.
“Equally good choices. Remind me to introduce you both to AC/DC and Black Sabbath. There’s a chance you might not be hopeless after all.” Tony said taking another large gulp of coffee. He needed to fully wake up. Besides having to deal with Strange soon, he needed his wits about him to deal with the two 95 year-olds who put underwear models to shame. Not that he was looking.
“We’re better than OK.” Tony answered as he grabbed the other man’s hand and squeezed gently. “We’re together.”
“I cnt hlp ‘t.” Bucky said through a mouthful before swallowing. “It’s just so good, Stevie.”
Tony cried out as Steve bit down on the muscle where his shoulder met his neck, and fuck, yes, he didn’t hold back. Tony wanted the bruise, the reminder of everything about to happen. He focused on the throbbing pain Steve’s teeth had left.
“Why where are we going?” Steve asked passively as they reached Tony.
“Yeah, he woulda. Seemed pretty jazzed at the thought of beating on
“That is something else have in common, then.” The man smiled, though he looked a little wary and was staring at Tony very closely. Tony wondered if the man expected a reaction from him just because he was obviously German.
“Was she wet, Stevie?” Because of course Bucky had to ask.
“Did he say that about me?” Bucky asked as he thought about what he’d just been told.
“You’re pretty cocky for a guy who thought Led Zeppelin was a failed military experiment,” Tony sassed back. He had really enjoyed being the one to introduce Steve to the awesomeness that is classic Led Zeppelin. It doesn’t mean he still won’t tease the super-soldier about it.
He remembered how dominant Bucky had been with that girl. Then he remembered how Bucky had said it meant nothing. It was just a necessary act, however both times had involved a lot of talking. For Steve’s benefit? Or was it a shared thing? Tony could think of a few things he’d like to hear Bucky and Steve say, and a few more he’d like to say in return. Not that it mattered, he reminded himself. Hopeless.
**Six Months and Fifteen Days Ago**
It had felt so good, and Bucky had groaned around Tony in his mouth, swimming in pleasure and desperation. He’d felt Tony’s hand move down to cradle Bucky’s head, keeping him in place as the older man’s hips began to make small thrusting movements, pushing himself in and out of Bucky’s throat, sweetly using him. The sensation of being sandwiched between them as he was filled had always been intense. He’d loved the simple pleasure of it, simple because all he’d had to do was relax and let them take over.
Tony looked at Steve and said, “You already know I’m coming, so put the eyes away.”
“Well, I had already planned on taking the both of you somewhere tonight.” Tony admitted. “I wanted to do something special, but now it can be a double celebration. That’s even better.”
Steve shrugged. “It’s not our business. Yeah, it’s illegal, but we don’t think it’s right to tell someone what to do with their body. It’s just another form of bullying, going after someone cuz they’re different.” Then his eyes narrowed. “What about you? Is it a problem?”
Steve was beyond stunned by this conversation. He hadn’t expected any of this. He hadn’t expected Tony to know about the doctor. He hadn’t expected Tony to beg him to fight as hard as he could to be accepted. It scared Steve if he was being honest with himself. What was Tony keeping from him?
God help him but Steve almost wanted to throttle Bucky. Instead he just raised his voice and addressed his other teammates. “I think we’ve learned everything we can until we find Strange, or until Bruce and JARVIS can tell us if the phone has any information. We should go back to the tower. We’ll call Pepper and update her on the situation. We can also…try…”
“You do that for Bucky, not me.” Steve reminded a little breathlessly.
The sounds you make, so fuckin’ sexy.
Halfway down he pulled away, Tony watched as Bucky used his lips to push the foreskin back before circling the freshly exposed head with his tongue then digging it into the slit. He repeated the swirl of his tongue then used it to press it along the length of the shaft before moving back to gently suck the tip.
Steve and Bucky were, of course, in the more tolerant group of people. It also explains why Mr. Martinelli would have been so touched at Tony helping his daughter and valued his prolonged friendship with the boys.
“Bring out the girls!” One of the men yelled, and Steve didn’t know what to do. It’s not like he ran the show and could order that to happen.
It was all his mind could process as Steve now hammered into the sensitive bundle of nerves with every thrust, his hand trailing along Tony’s chest and tracing every scar.
“I, uh,” Steve closed his eyes again and focused his thoughts. “I took him home with me.”
The closest he could come to explaining it to himself was that he only felt real with Steve and Bucky, like he was a ghost, and they were the only one’s able to see him. Or maybe everyone else was a ghost. It didn’t matter, he supposed. This weird detachment to the world around him was the least of his worries. It had finally arrived, the night of the expo.
Steve stood at the center island of the large kitchen the team used to cook group meals. They all had kitchens on their separate floors, but they usually tried to eat a few meals together each week. He was busy mincing garlic and chopping bell peppers and onions for the large pot of spaghetti sauce he was making. The new memories flickered in the background of his thoughts, but it was much easier now to just focus on what he was doing.
This is me dipping my toe into the smut, but unfortunately we won't be fully diving in for several more chapters. Which is good because writing smut is HARD. And me being an idiot, decided to write an explicit polyamory story for my first time writing. But rest assured it is coming, and it will be the longest chapter to post by the time it arrives since I'm trying to reward your patience through this slow burn.
Bucky walked down the sidewalk on his way to meet Tony where his partner was finishing a small job fixing the lighting of a nearby bar. Tony had said that it wouldn’t take him long, and Bucky could pick him up so that they could walk home together. Steve was supposed to be meeting them, too. He had gone to drop off one of his paintings that morning and was supposed to catch a movie while he waited for Bucky and Tony to be done for the day.
Steve spoke first. “Are you alright? Do you need something?” His hands hovered over Tony’s stomach, clearly wanting to check beneath the wrappings but not sure if it would be welcome.
Tony had taken care of them in the past, and he was healing Bucky in the present. At this thought Steve’s joy and relief was muddied with worry for Tony. They had to find a way to help him. They had to bring him home.
Bucky had then said something very similar to what Steve had. Making Tony sound like some amazing renaissance man, like he was larger than life, and maybe he was. Back in his time. Now, in 1939 he was next to nothing.
He felt like a warped puzzle piece that didn’t fit in with the picture the others created. They were bright and cleanly cut while he was a murky grey with frayed edges. He wanted to lock himself in his room with Steve and just hold him as the soothing silence covered them like a blanket, but that was a cowardly thing to do. Bucky was a lot of things, but he was no coward.
“Well, Mr. Stark, to what do we owe this pleasure today that you have decided to grace us with your presence?” Colonel Philips voice was loud and gruff as ever as it pulled the attention of everyone in a fifteen foot radius.
Steve looked down to Bucky, who was helped to his feet by Tony. Steve was gratified to see that he seemed steadier. The food and water already appeared to be helping him.
councilmen. I’m owed favors by no less than
“You’re both pretty damn special in my book.” Too special, he thought, and Tony should probably stop talking. Damn bourbon. “I’ve travelled all over this planet and met a lot of people who might be considered important, but none of them have impressed me the way you two have.”
Tony watched as Steve ran his fingers along Bucky’s jaw, prompting him to open his mouth. He moved the hand back up to grab Bucky’s hair, holding him in place. Leaning his hips forward, he slid the tip of his dick past Bucky’s lips, sighing as he moved steadily forward.
“Er,” this was awkward, Tony thought. “I don’t really have a place yet,” Tony hedged. “I was looking into it when I heard the fight in the alley. Then I walked Steve home in case those assholes were still around. I guess I should really go before it gets too late to find something.”
Morita shrugged, “My friends back home call me Jim.”
Tony was speaking again, and a chill went up Bucky’s spine as Tony said he’d been holding back because Bucky believed it. The relative ease that Tony had taken them down with, and the calm detachment on Tony’s face that warred with the cold fury throughout most of the conversation spoke volumes as to what he was capable of.
That thought was like a slap in Tony’s face. He couldn’t remember exactly when he’d last called Bucky anything but his name. And his sweet boy was right, up until a week ago he would have been the one to pull Bucky to the center of the living area and dance to all of their favorite tunes as they played. For the last several days, Bucky had been trying to get his attention, and Tony had been so frugal with it.
“It’s not a big deal, but I will be happy to tell you after we decide on our dinner. Gianetta will be here soon.” Tony winked before he looked back at his menu. Everything sounded good. He loved classic Italian cooking.
It looked at the weapon. It knew it could fly. It wondered if the weapon could fly in space?
Tony couldn’t tell him that in a month Steve would be accepted into the army, and that not long after that, he’d received a serum that would ensure he’d never be ill again. He wanted to, but he couldn’t. So Tony just said, “The benefits were nice, but they aren’t needed. I’m making good money now, and so are you, and so is Bucky. Our rent has been reduced by half of what it was. Plus I’ve got my consulting job on top of everything. This is actually a good thing. I was running myself a little ragged with all the jobs I was juggling. Now, I’ll have some more time to spend on you and Bucky when he comes home.”
Joe’s answer just made Tony even angrier. Joe was struggling to speak as Tony fumed at him before he managed to get a few words out. Bucky felt his anger reignite as he realized Joe was going to call Steve a queer, but it abruptly turned into stunned disbelief when Tony broke his arm so quickly, hell it looked
“Fuck you, Barnes,” Williams sneered. “Irish piece of shit!”
“I could have been thinking of you,” Steve pointed out.
It was enough to overwhelm him, enhanced or not, and that was all on top of everything he had done and gone through since he’d woken up over twenty hours ago. Steve just tried to take it in stride. If these men could find the strength to follow him and march, he would do his best to accept the responsibility they’d given him. Even though he still wasn’t sure why any of the other more experienced officers hadn’t taken command.
Tony shrugged. “Probably still at the movies. We can go find him there. I think we’re both running a little earlier than we’d planned.”
She laughed as she set their traditional decanter of wine on the table. “Keep flirting, Mr. Tony. I know I don’t stand a chance against your loves, but it still makes my heart sing.” She gave a sly smile to Bucky and Steve.
It was Francesco who had commissioned Steve’s first, second and third paintings for his restaurant when he’d learned that Steve was an artist. Steve had been beside himself to finally be able to use the skills he’d learned in school and paint quality work for a patron. Tony and Bucky had encouraged him to go to other restaurants and advertise his abilities. He’s done many paintings for various places, along with a few murals (one of which was on the wall behind them) and sometimes window art for special occasions. He was getting paid well for it too, or at least it was much more than he used to make.
“Nope,” he said, making his lips pop around the p. “I made it. If one of you would do the honors,” he motioned with his hand.
Bucky wasn’t ready to share at the moment, and if Steve was being honest with himself, he wasn’t sure he was ready to hear it either. He would though, when Bucky finally wanted to tell him. He didn’t know how long that would take, and he didn’t know what that revelation would mean for them moving forward.
He’d also recreated their Christmas dinner, complete with eggnog, and gotten them presents. With Bucky working again and Steve not having to spend so much of his money on medicine and doctors thanks to Tony’s arrangement with the hospital, they were able to get Tony something, too.
“Keep your opinions to yourself, Barton, or I’ll physically and mentally scar you for life,” Bucky promised threateningly. He wasn’t about to let anyone make a joke out of what meant so much to him.
The asset part of him had not been happy with the thought of falling asleep in Steve’s bed like he had, but Bucky had shoved that nagging voice aside. Steve had needed him, and he had been falling short for too long when it came to Steve for Bucky to not try to get the man to talk. It had taken a while before he’d mustered up the courage to come to Steve’s floor and ask to stay with him. What if Steve didn’t feel comfortable sleeping next to an assassin?
“I’m afraid I can’t, Steve.” Tony groaned as he ground down against him. “We have to be careful, after all. Who knows what could happen?”
The joke fell flat.
Tony’s world exploded as he came. His vision blurred, and his mind shorted out and all he could do was feel. It was so intense. Steve’s promise of love followed by the order to let go sent Tony flying, and Steve stroked and fucked him through it until Tony felt his hips stop their movement as he cried out and released inside Tony.
Bucky had been terrified without remembering the reason for it. Muscle memory had taught his body to expect pain from that situation. Sometimes at night Steve had nightmares filled with Bucky’s muffled screams around the bite guard, loud enough to drown out the sound of electricity. Other nights he had nightmares of Bucky screaming as he fell from the train. Then there was the sound of Bucky’s yell as Steve dislocated his shoulder as they fought on a falling heli-carrier. His dreams were always filled with his best friends screams.
you, baby. Everything you are. Everything you will be. A good man. Who will do great things.”
Steve looked to meet his eyes, and Bucky was sure that the blonde had noticed the change in Tony too. Something was bothering the older man, and Bucky couldn’t shake the feeling that it was about something more than him leaving in the morning.
“What do you mean you promise to get outta our hair?” Steve sounded almost angry. The question seemed to make Bucky realize what Tony had said, and his face morphed into confusion before dropping into a matching scowl.
Steve knew they both needed help, but Bucky was not ready for therapy or counseling. It was still hard for him to speak to the members of the team about everyday things, getting him to try opening up to a stranger would most likely end badly. Steve had faith that they could get there though. Maybe they could go together at first, and Bucky could listen to Steve talk while he got used to the therapist.
Tony moved forward and kissed his forehead, running his fingers through his sweaty hair. “That was incredible, sweetheart.” He ran his fingers down the back of Bucky’s head to the nape of his neck, staring at his flushed skin and sleepy grey eyes. “So gorgeous.” He whispered.
They had just sat down when Steve exited the bedroom. A mess of blonde hair atop his head, puffy sleep-reddened eyes and a too big white shirt and boxers hung from him. He looked adorable, even with the split lip and black eye.
“It is I who am thanking you. You helped mio famiglia. I am happy to host you.” Martinelli turned to Steve and Bucky as he pulled open the curtain to reveal a private room. “Mr. Stark is a very kind man.”
His fingers gave a twist and pressed against Steve’s prostate, making Steve’s body jerk at the sudden pleasure. “I can,” Steve answered in a groan, only half aware that this was one of those roleplay scenes Tony had told them about. He’d never really understood the appeal before, but now he couldn’t deny that this was definitely doing something for him. Trust Tony to give him what he didn’t know he needed. “I can take anything you give me.” He promised breathlessly.
“Your key,” Tony held out his hand and waited as it was fished out of a pocket and placed into his palm. “I’ll just turn this in to the landlord in the morning as part of my new duties as superintendent.”
Steve sat on the floor near Tony’s feet drawing on a sketchpad. Tony had protested the seating arrangement, but apparently the young man wasn’t being polite. That was Steve’s “spot”. He usually worked from right there.
As he sat across the table from Bucky, Steve’s mind replayed the last twenty-four hours. It had begun with Bucky teasing him all morning about Steve’s first successful date, and while he had enjoyed doing that with Lucille, he’d also known that it wouldn’t be enough to change him and how he felt about his best friend and sometimes lover.
They weren’t able to go back to sleep after Bucky finally calmed down. Eventually, Steve decided to move them from the floor. When Bucky didn’t show any signs of objecting, Steve bent down and pulled him up before leading him into the living room. It was surreal to interact with Bucky this way, but the events of the night had obviously taken a lot out of him, and the brunet looked lost in his own thoughts.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And this is what I do,” Tony said as he paused to look at them. “Most of my life, I didn’t have family, so I learned to make my own, and it means more to me than anything I ever had. Anything. I’ve seen enough to know the kind of people you are, and it goes beyond being good soldiers. So, at least for this week, let me repay you how I can.”
. “Oh, I meant we. We are going to the future, to the expo.”
“I can explain,” he started, but he honestly had no good reason for this. He was tired and in pain, and seeing them just brought back the memory of what he’d been trying to escape.
They’d all readied themselves for bed after listening the evening news on the radio. Tony had said goodnight as the two had gone to their shared room.
Then, Tony was falling, and as the air whipped past him and the explosions surrounded them, he felt a sense of homecoming. He watched Steve’s parachute deploy below him, adrenaline rushed through his veins, and he felt alive. He’d missed this. The danger and thrill of being in the air was closer to being in the Iron Man suit than he’d felt in years.
Tony winced upon hearing that. He hadn’t thought that Steve would have found a way to let Bucky know he’d been injured, but Tony realized that he should have. He would have wanted to know if either of them had been hospitalized with what appeared to be life threatening injuries.
“Maybe,” Tony said, fully feeling how dry his mouth was. “How long have I been asleep?”
Thor had come soon after that, telling of his adventure in London fighting elves with his girlfriend or something. Asking about Steve’s heroic battle against the Hydra, not fully understanding that it wasn’t an actual multi-headed Greek monster Steve had fought. Then asking about Tony’s brave crusade against the Mandarin.
Bucky sat at the large table in the dining alcove of the communal kitchen. All of the team, minus Thor and Tony, filled the rest of the chairs with Steve sitting in the chair to his right. Which was a good thing because Bucky’s nerves were all over the place. He’d never been comfortable during the team’s shared meals, but now that he had some version of his memories back, it was a different kind of discomfort.
Steve shrugged a little. “I might, it depends. But for now I know I want Tony to take me, even if it’s just to see if I like it as much as I think I would. I do know that I will never want to change what we have.” Steve said, giving Bucky a quick kiss. “As long as you want me that way.”
Tony wanted to believe that Strange was just rude enough to ignore a knock on the door when he was expecting company, but he knew that probably wasn’t true.
The archer waved as the elevator doors closed, leaving him and Steve alone again.
The others were looking down to their friend, then up to Tony’s face that was projecting his signature look of cool confidence. Tony had had that look mastered by the age of seven. It was his first mask, long before the armor it had protected Tony. Despite his still whirling emotions and racing mind, Tony knew they only saw calm purpose.
“Really?” asked Steve, impressed.
It was silent in his wake. After a minute or so, Tony’s nerves got the best of him, and he looked over at Bucky. He was watching Tony with an unreadable expression, which set him on edge because he would very much like to know what the younger man was thinking about what had just happened. What Tony almost did to
Bucky closed his eyes and promised himself that he would do better before he slowly began to drift off to sleep.
I write this acknowledgement to honor him and all the men who fought bravely, many of whom did not make it home. To all veterans, thank you.
He gave Tony a half smile. “You know, you can call me Bucky.”
As if on auto pilot, Bucky’s feet carried him to the table he always sat beside as Stark worked on his arm. The specialized tool kit Stark (
“That depends,” Steve said slyly. “What do I get when I hand it over?”
“Was there a reason you asked, Steve?” Tony guessed why, but he wanted to hear Steve say it. If he couldn’t say it, how could he do it?
Bucky wanted to roll his eyes because he wasn’t some broken thing, but…it actually made him more comfortable that they’d thought of it. Steve was giving them space while Tony asked, and he realized how much it meant to him that they were making sure. Bucky didn’t like to think about what he’d gone through, but when he did, he felt violated. He remembered the rough hands on him as they’d strapped him to the table, the harsh pulling of his sleeves and collar before they pushed in the syringe when he’d been helpless.
Tony did not, however, voice any of these thoughts. Instead, he decided to suck it up, play nice and tell Howard what he wanted to hear. With Steve’s safety on the line, Tony couldn’t afford to be petty about this. “Thank you, that’s all I ask.”
Still…Mission Objective: Become Bucky. New Side Objective: Avoid Making Steve Sad
“Next time you two birdbrains go for some afternoon delight, don’t do it in a supply closet I happen to be walking past. Though with the sounds Sam was making, I gotta admit I’m impressed. At least your mouth is good for something other than being annoying.”
Tony’s heart broke a little at the shame in Bucky’s voice. He knew Bucky couldn’t get him a present in return because he wasn’t working anymore.
“An ingenious plan to be sure,” Tony agreed as he watched Steve set the pie on the table and grab fresh plates. “Would it ruin the surprise to ask what kind?”
“It’s no trouble at all, Anthony,” she crooned. God, he hated when people used his full name, which was probably why she did it. “In fact, I believe it would be very entertaining while I wait for my wayward daughter and the arrogant oaf.”
As Tony fell asleep cuddling up to Bucky’s left side with Steve on his right, he gently ran his fingers down the arm that lay over his chest. This arm was warm and strong and smooth, but all he could see and feel was cold, hard metal plates. He cursed the future.
“It is a perfectly safe procedure when done properly, Tony, and it helped us treat you.” Abrams paused before finishing with, “Although, some of the first images appear to have been faulty.”
“Well they should have,” Tony told him in a serious voice, “you’re worth it.”
“You’re probably right about that.” Steve agreed. “I love you, Buck. And thank you for listening before you called me out on my crap.”
They had to help him. It was clear that Tony would not go to the hospital like they wanted him to, so Bucky just did the best he could patching him up. God knows, he’d had enough practice with Steve over the years, but he was still worried about that wound. What if it got infected?
“We love taking care of you, sweetheart.”
With his mind made up, Tony leaned forward and gently kissed Bucky before turning to do the same with Steve, then he rose to his feet, and firmly said,  “I’ll be right back.”
He heard their murmured replies, “Of course, Tony.” “Sleep as long as you need to.” He dimly noted their exit as he laid there and let oblivion claim him.
Steve felt his own tears falling as he choked out his words, finally telling him everything he’d wanted to for over six months. “Don’t. Don’t do that, love.” The relief he felt at being able to say these words was nearly overwhelming. “It wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault. God, I…”
Joe’s eyes were wide as he looked into Tony’s rage filled ones.
And just like that, the spell was broken, and Tony instantly looked relieved as the other men nodded quickly. Dernier was speaking happily in French as he nodded his head, and Bucky really wished he’d had Tony teach him the language so he could understand the man.
“You like that, don’t you? The thought of suckin’ me off in front of those assholes and lettin’ them know you’re mine. That you do these things for me, only me. Show them all the things I let you do to me. Or the things I do to
“Of course we will.” Bucky answered. “Is that even a question?”
He was also helping to support them since most of his service check was directed to go to them while he was here. Tony had not been happy when Bucky had told him he’d arranged that for them. Tony snarked and said he’d just invest it for Bucky, so that when he returned, he’d be a wealthy man and would never have to work again. Bucky had just laughed because of course that was something Tony would say.
“After my education was completed, and I began my work at SI, I started to build and create. I also started to tear things down. I tore down doors that had been closed to me. I tore down business rivals. I pushed myself into the places that I wanted to be and proved to everyone that I had always deserved to be there. Not many people have the balls to stand in my way, much less tell me
The group was now at the middle of the clearing, and he saw when they spotted the gift that he’d left for them. A blood-stained pack of a soldier they’d lost two days ago was laid out next to the now smoldering remains of a “campfire” he’d had the men build. It was meant to look recently used as if the soldier it belonged to must have hidden when he’d sensed them coming. He watched it all through the scope of his rifle.
“But you’re…”
Tony gave the three a smirk with a lazy salute, turned and sauntered out of the kitchen. Yes, Tony was an asshole, but he was in good company.
“I’m fine, Tony.” He answered evenly, finally taking his eyes off the floor. “Are you alright? You said your heart was…”
Steve took the pillow from him with one hand and nudged at Tony’s hips with the other. Tony lifted them just enough for him to slide the pillow under.
Steve gave him a watery smile. “If it were anyone else sayin’ that, I’d call them a liar.”
“Tony, please,” he said in a strangled voice, “ I need more. Touch more of me…please.”
She was scary powerful, and Tony would readily admit he was outmatched with only his gauntlet against her. He wasn’t stupid enough to think he could best a higher-dimensional being who had once literally fucked the Hulk into submission. Bruce still had issues over it.
“Well, it turns out that he works with the colonel and recommended my name.” Tony told them. “We had talked about a lot of different things that day, and apparently, he was impressed.”
“For starters,” Tony began, “I used to drink a lot of it.” Steve huffed as Bucky chuckled. “Secondly, it was just the way I grew up. Wine was served with meals and at parties. I didn’t have my first beer until I went to college.”
They eventually came to a road, and just up the way, they could see the HYDRA base. It was fortress, and Tony’s glasses were going haywire providing him with information. He would keep most of it to himself; he wasn’t here to take anything from Steve. This was his mission and his moment. Tony was here because he couldn’t wait a minute longer than necessary to hold Bucky again.
Tony slowly smiled as he looked Steve up and down. “Well, I could always touch
“Are you alright, sweetheart? Is this OK?” He asked as he worked his way down the shirt.
“Then whoever said that was talkin’ out their ass.” Bucky finally spoke. “These past two and a half months have been fun. You’re fun to be around Tony. Most days I couldn’t wait to come home and hear some of the crazy stories you come up with or some of the dirtiest jokes I’ve ever heard. And listen to you talk about the books you’ve been readin’ or the places you’ve been.”
Curious at this he closed his eyes and continued with the memory. After a lot of begging, Tony had laid him on his side in the middle of bed before lying next to him in a position that put Bucky’s mouth right in front of Tony’s dick. As Bucky had taken Tony into his mouth, the other man had done the same to him, continuing the blowjob he’d been giving Bucky for however long it was they’d prepped and teased him.
Yes, she was an amazing woman, and Tony would make sure that she was looked after.
Steve grinned, “Our knight in shining armor. You always have been.”
Umar chuckled. “I didn’t realize that heroes had heroes. So much doubt and longing inside your mind.”
Mr. Gallagher was openly crying. “My son, he’s stationed there on the U.S.S Arizona. They said, they said a lot of ships had sank. My son…” Mr. Russo put a hand on his shoulder to steady him as he swayed in his grief. None of them could find the words to comfort to their friend, who didn’t even know if his son was alive or not.
“Yeah, yeah sorry, I…aahh,” he closed his eyes and scrubbed his face, willing the past to disappear, “I just…need a minute.”
Tony ran Bucky’s words through his mind, trying to figure out what had him so upset then he remembered what Bucky had called him as he came. “Sweetheart, look at me.” He said, firm but gentle, his hands still cupping his sweet boy’s face as he waited for Bucky to meet his eyes. “
Steve just nodded, face red.
The television cut off, leaving them in quiet semidarkness as they processed what they’d heard.
Tony felt something loosen in his chest, and he didn’t think it was just because of the alcohol. This really was his second chance with Phillips, with the SSR, this was his chance.
“I just scratch pictures on paper, Tony.” Steve said in a self-depreciating way.
As he shot his last one in the head, he looked over to see Steve kick a man over a railing. The blonde looked out over the factory then down and pointed, “There, almost below us. There’s a door we didn’t see before. It’s not far.”
The relief that had swept over Bucky had been immense, to the point where he’d had to sit down. As he’d asked questions, he couldn’t believe the things Steve was telling him, but under every shocking revelation about the doctors and Tony’s insistence that he was healthy enough to leave, and Steve telling how he was ending his contract with the hospital, Bucky had always returned to the thought that Tony was alright.
“Approximately, one month, twelve days, fifteen hours and thirty-four minutes after Captain Rogers arrived with yourself, Ms. Romanoff and Mr. Wilson. Sir had been working tirelessly to keep you safe and ensure your wellbeing.”
It was a good question. Bucky wanted that answer too.
“It’s melted cheese and bread that you eat with sticks, not whatever you’re thinking,” Tony told him quietly as he absently rubbed his hand.
“I did,” Dugan said. “Depression got bad and they couldn’t afford to pay all of us. So, I left. It was only fair. Some of those people couldn’t get jobs like everyone else, that’s why they joined the circus in the first place. Regular people don’t hire the deformed, do they?”
“You know you only get to come if your mouth is on me. Next time you fuck some dame all you’re gonna be able to think of is the taste of me, hot down your throat. Wishin’ it was my mouth around you or me in you. Knowin’ she’s second place at best to me. Just another quick fuck that will be gone before morning.”
When they pulled apart, Steve softly smiled at Bucky who smiled shyly in return. “I love you, Bucky.”
Tony already liked this guy.
As Steve and Tony went to leave them and continue their search, Gabe asked if Steve knew what he was doing.
*Steve’s POV*
“That’s right,” Tony’s breath ghosted against his face as he held himself above Steve’s body to watch him fall apart. His arm between them pumping fingers into Steve. “You want it so bad don’t you? I could just hold my hand here, and you’d fuck yourself on my fingers, wouldn’t you?”
Thank you all again. I don't know when the next chapter will post, but it will at least be by next Saturday. It depends on how much work I can get done.
Crap, Bucky felt awful for that. “I’m sorry.” And he was. Any officer worth their rank felt responsible for the men under him.
“So what do you think, Bucky?” Steve’s voice cut through his thoughts and pulled him back to what was being said around him.
“It was the cave.” The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them. “I, I was back in the cave. After it happened, I had nightmares all the time. I’d wake up and think I was still there, about to die.”
“If you say that you’re fine, so help me God, Tony, you will regret lying to me!” Steve was really upset. No, he was really
“You deserve so much better,” Bucky told him through silent tears. “I can’t be him. I tried, and all it did was cause this. I can’t even pretend to be him without being reminded of what I am. I hate this. I don’t want to be this way, and when we get Tony back, he’ll…” Bucky choked, “He won’t even recognize me. What if he doesn’t love me anymore? You’ll have to choose, and why would you choose me over him? I’m so fucking broken.”
Tony shrugged. “Some people don’t see it as truly topping. They would say that Bucky is topping from the bottom because you are servicing him and not the other way around. I don’t agree with this, but it is a thing. It’s considered a soft form of topping which makes you less dominant. It doesn’t really matter for us because I don’t really prescribe to labeling someone’s sexual preferences as an absolute thing. Fuck other people’s opinions.”
Dugan huffed. “That son of a bitch can’t make sergeant. Could you imagine him as our CO’s right hand man?”
Tony leaned in further and whispered, “He’d probably start by telling you to get on your knees.”
Steve chuckled. “Tony, you
Tony yelled.
“Tony, you’re awake.” He said as he walked to the bed. “How are you feeling?”
“Thank you, baby.” He breathed a kiss across his cheek. “Next time we do what you want.”
Again, conversation stopped as everyone looked at Bucky, and he felt embarrassed by his outburst. Thankfully, Barton swallowed his surprise and answered, “Yeah, it’s where I learned archery and acrobatics. It’s where I got the name Hawkeye. Why?”
It had to be there, even in this time. If he could get there, he could find some magic type-person to get him back to where he belonged. Yes, that would work. It would be fine. Tony had a plan.
“What happened?” Tony repeated softly.
Steve’s arms encircled him, and his hands ran along his chest in soothing touches. “I’m so proud of you, love,” the blonde whispered to him as he started lightly running his lips along Bucky’s throat, kissing him softly and making his breath hitch. This was more than alright.
But they’d failed. James had been recovering these last few months. They hadn’t broken him, and he’d pulled himself back from near oblivion.
Tony looked at him, stunned. “You read Harry Potter?” What the hell was in this coffee?
Steve’s voice was dry. “And you wonder what Bucky could possibly mean by you going after people.”
The aftermath of BAMF Tony. A deeper insight to Steve, Bucky and the secrets they've been hiding behind their smiles. This is the turning point, and heads will begin their removal from asses.
“I know. You never worry about yourself, but you’re gonna tap a hole in the floorboards at this rate, Tony.” Steve told him kindly.
“Well,” Tony countered, “I had a good teacher.”
“You wanna come on my dick, sweetheart?” Tony panted as he started thrusting harder into him, nailing his prostate every other time. “Wanna show me how good you are? You gonna clench around me as I fill you up?”
None of the memories he had of being with Steve included him after the serum, and Bucky was taken aback. Yes, since they’d moved into the tower, he’d seen Steve every day. He’d even seen him without a shirt while they were working out or changing in the locker room, but it had always been with clinical detachment. He’d never looked at Steve, or anyone for that matter, in a way that could be described as appreciative.
Yes, once again time seemed to be passing so quickly, but Bucky’s absence also made it seem like an eternity. Tony had felt this way since he’d first arrived in the past. Days racing by and dragging slowly, all at the same time.
“Can’t believe how much the army is bending over backwards for Steve.” Bucky shook his head as he resolutely avoided looking at the window. “I know he deserves it. He’s earned it, but couldn’t he have requested a nice boat for us?”
Tony briefly wondered if he’d have to shelve the idea of someday making Bucky a flying car. Maybe Bucky had liked the idea of a car that flies more than the thought of flying in one himself. Tony would ask when the time came.
“Wow,” Dugan said, “how much can you lift, Captain?”
Now, it was Steve’s turn to hesitate. “I need to get dressed,” he finally said as he went over to his dresser and pulled out a pair of boxer-briefs. He slid them on under his towel before removing it. He saw Bucky’s brow crease in confusion as he opened another drawer and took out a pair of blue flannel pajama pants, pulling them on before returning to the bed.
Hope you enjoyed this, and next chapter will be up within the next two weeks.
my submission.” Then he flippantly added, “It’s difficult for someone to convince me that they know better than I would.”
Steve and Tony both watched his hunger with sadness, but Steve had to give Tony credit, when he spoke again, his voice was trying to be upbeat. “It came with a chocolate bar,” Tony said as he put it down on Bucky’s thigh, “It got a little smushed, but ya know…chocolate.”
“Does it feel good, Buck?” Steve panted as he continued moving in his mouth. “I know you have a thing for his mouth.” This was news to Tony. “I bet it feels better than you thought about. Wonder how it’s gonna feel when he takes you inside him, that smart mouth you love wrapped around your dick.”
And Bucky was out. Tony watched him fondly for a few moments before he turned back to Steve.
“This is to help you, and no one here will ever punish you for not understanding something or saying no to something. I promised Steve that I would help,” Stark looked to Steve before he met its eyes again, “but not if this overwhelms you. If you allow it, I’m going to try to work quickly and help with some of this pain today. If you want me to stop, tell me, that’s alright and I will stop.”
Tony recognized Gabe Jones as he looked at them and asked, “Who are you supposed to be?”
“Wait,” Tony held up a hand, “they were glad she got to play? She’d make it up to them?” Tony’s eyes went wide with understanding. “Oh.
“Yeah,” Steve muttered, a little dejectedly, “thanks, Mister.” Then Steve met his eyes and something in them hardened. “It’s not that I don’t appreciate your help, but I could have handled it. I can take care of myself, and I ain’t no kid.” Apparently, Steve’s pride and determination were healthier than his body.
“Then we have a deal,” Tony agreed.
“It’s been said,” Steve agreed, “but I’m not wrong about this. I know you think I’m foolish and sentimental. I know you don’t believe you’re worth saving or that you can be saved, and in a way you’re right.”
They took trips to Coney Island in the summer months. The first time they’d gone, Tony knew he was a terrible person as he’d had to fight off laughter at Steve’s ashen face after Bucky finally talked him into riding the roller coaster. The urge to laugh died as soon as Steve thrown up on Tony’s shoes. Tony had probably deserved that, but he thinks Bucky deserved it more. Steve apparently thought so too because he had punished Bucky for it the next night. Turns out Bucky really liked impact play and orgasm denial, and Steve had been exceptionally ruthless that night.
Before Steve could answer, the television on the wall across from them came to life, and as they turned to look, a familiar brown-haired figure appeared on the screen.
Tony watched as the man packed his meager belongings then wrote the letter. “Be sure to tell her you’re sorry. Not for leaving, but for not doing better by her and leaving sooner.”
He just gave in to everything he felt, everything they were giving. The aftershocks were being chased away by the oversensitivity of every movement and touch.
But that’s not what had sent Tony over the edge. Able to think clearly now, he knew that his own lust had less to do with Marie and had been more about Bucky and Steve. The sounds and words Bucky had spoken were seared into his mind. He wanted to watch Bucky using those sinful skills on a willing body, maybe hear his own name spoken in that low rough voice. The look of Steve so turned on had made Tony want to wreck him even further. Slowly take him apart until he was moaning louder than Marie. Begging Tony for more as if he might die without it.
“I have to say that I’m impressed.” Tony panted as he fucked into Steve. “You take me so well. Are you going to come again already? I can feel your ass tightening around me like you think I’m going to let you come, but not yet,” Tony released Steve’s arms to let the smaller man fall forward onto the mattress and off his dick with a groan.
He reached his hand up to rub a thumb over Steve’s high cheekbone. “You can have all my days, baby. Every day and every night belongs to you, just say the word.”
“Out?” Tony asked confused. “Did we have a date? Did I forget?”
Bruce sighed as he removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. “No, Thor said he couldn’t change destiny or what was meant to happen before the curse was created. You know, major events. He never said that Tony couldn’t add to history.”
Tony just chuckled as he picked up his fork. “Well, let’s get to eating it now, I have to leave soon.”
Steve’s small smile met his eyes this time. “Let’s stick to coffee for now.”
?” Steve asked as though he’d never heard of one before. “Like while camping?”
“That’s not reassuring,” Tony murmured. “You need to go rest, take it easy, at least until tomorrow. Drink some water and have something for the pain.”
“Thank you,” he said sincerely before adding a touch of humor. “You give pretty insightful talks, did you know that?”
“Do you really think I would have been able to stop him?” Steve asked seriously because he had tried to talk Tony out of it.
“Yes,” Bucky panted from where his head rested against his forearms. “Fuucckk.”
Tony’s eyebrows raised slightly but beyond that there was no other reaction. “I’m afraid we’re going to have to be more specific here, Steve. Are you saying you want to be penetrated or you want to try submission?”
“No, it won’t,” Tony interrupted, remembering the good news he’d been coming back to share earlier.
It was clean, though. The floor looked to have been swept recently, and the sink was empty of dishes.  Steve was crossing to the tiny kitchen. He grabbed two glasses that had been drying on a towel and filled them with water from the tap. Tony mentally cringed, but kept his face polite and reserved.
“I…” Tony’s mind was melting because who the fuck knew that Steve could be this seductive? “I just wanted…”
“I…what?” Bucky asked, not exactly proud to have been caught not paying attention to what was going on around him. He was trained to be better than that.
Tony looked at the others in question, trying to read their faces before he turned back and replied, “I think they’d like to do that themselves.”
He’d learned long ago that people always inevitably find him wanting.
After another minute or so, Tony obliged and ran the flat of his tongue right down his middle, starting below the balls and finishing at his tailbone. He returned to gently suck on the rim, adding tiny licks to loosen Bucky as he grew accustomed to this new sensation.
“Thank you, Tony.” Bucky’s voice shook a little, “How…how did you know how to do that?”
“So perfect in my hand, doll. So hard for me. I love that you want me this much. Did that girl try to touch you last night, like I’m touchin’ you?”
Like a greedy child, he snatched them up quickly, eyes jumping to the picture. Tony’s jaw dropped.
“Need more, daddy,” Bucky panted beneath him, struggling to get the words out. “Love when you take me…take care of me. Love being…good for you.”
Bucky just moaned and pushed back harder on his fingers, so Tony took that as a yes. He inserted the tip of a third, easing it in beside the others. Tony slowly worked all three in, giving Bucky time to adjust, and ran the pad of his middle finger over the prostate again to help take away any discomfort.
“You know where I stand on this,” Tony replied evenly. “I don’t like it, but I will respect his decisions, just like I understand and respect your position.”
The sounds behind them were growing louder, dirtier as Tony and Steve held each other’s eyes. Tony didn’t know what Steve was thinking of. Was his arousal just a simple physical response of pent up frustration mixed with the provocative noises in the other room? Was he only focusing on the woman’s sounds, like porn? Was he looking at Tony to try to control himself by reminding his cock that he wasn’t alone and needed to behave? He couldn’t be affected  by Tony’s arousal, surely?
“Of course, sweetheart,” Tony smiled softly, eyes crinkling, before looking to Steve. “What about you, beautiful? Anything you want to know?”
Tony released the arm only to grab his shoulders to pull him down as he brought his knee up. As it made contact with the guys stomach, the air rushed out of him in a groan as he fell to his knees. Tony delivered a well-aimed punch that knocked him out cold.
“Tony Stark,” Tony mentally winced. Maybe he shouldn’t have given his real last name, but Tony was exhausted and this was all too much. “I thought he called you Buck?”
“I just suggested it and stirred the pot. Steve is the man behind the curtain.”
**Steve POV**
That really worked for Steve because he had gotten to watch and enjoy the show even more than he would have if he’d been the one orchestrating everything. As he’d looked on to Tony with Bucky, he realized that he
Steve was now moaning against Bucky as Tony pushed his tongue in to breach him, wiggling it so Steve could feel every tiny movement as it slid in further. Bucky groaned loudly at whatever Steve’s mouth had done in reaction to that. Apparently Steve was still able to focus on taking care of their love. Good.
“Mornin’ Nat,” Steve said, and everyone else murmured their greetings. Bucky just nodded to her, but she smiled and nodded back.
God, he missed Google.
After, when they were back in their apartment, Tony turned on the radio to a station playing Christmas music. As Steve took a seat on the couch and Bucky in his armchair, he went to the icebox for his last surprise. He brought out the large jug and three glasses, setting them on the small coffee table in front of the boys, as he went behind the couch to grab the final ingredient.
It was Saturday, and Tony was walking back from the hardware store with his most recent purchase. He’d been scrounging spare parts for a couple of weeks now, and he was just about ready to begin work on his newest creation. He was going to build them a washing machine. They had them out there, but they were primitive and expensive. Tony knew his would work a hell of a lot better; he’d just needed the materials to create his masterpiece. Steve was going to shit a brick. Those hands of his should be sketching beautiful, naughty pictures, not scrubbing dirt out of their laundry.
Philips’s face was the definition of apathy as Tony stared at the frown lines that dominated the colonel’s features. God, had the man ever smiled once in his life? “Son, a roll of toilet paper can be useful, but that doesn’t mean I have one on staff.”
Phillips reached into a drawer and pulled out a bottle of whiskey and two glasses. He poured each of them an inch of liquid before he pushed a glass to Tony. “Drink that.”
Trying to ignore the spinning in his head, Tony pulled himself up to sit and look out onto the street beyond the alley’s entrance. What the fuck?
Tony blew out a deep breath. “It is sometimes very inconvenient with how observant you are. Just saying.”
“I sold my suit.” He raised the bag dangling from his arm that held his new, used clothing. “Sold my shoes, my ring, my belt and wallet too. Got something more practical.” He waved a hand to motion to his time-period appropriate outfit before he pointed to the box. “Then I got some groceries.”
Bucky smiled a little. “There’s an easy way to fix that.”
Bucky smirked, “I know that, but it doesn’t mean you don’t deserve it, or that I can’t enjoy it.”
“There’s a fine line between pleasure and pain,” Tony answered simply, “especially when body chemistry is involved. It can be done to help remove a person from their thoughts and focus on what their body is feeling. Sometimes the person receiving it just enjoys the pain inflicted.” Tony looked directly at him. “Speaking of which, I first need to apologize to you, Bucky.”
Dum answered, “I have to agree with ya on that, Sarge.”
“I can’t tell you.” Tony told him. “If I say anything it could change something, and this is one thing that I can’t risk changing. Like I said, your work is too important. Can you get me in? As a technician? A consultant? Fuck, I’ll sweep the floors if I have to, but can you do it?”
“Speaking of,” Steve said looking over to Bucky. “We had hoped to talk about some things, about us. How this all is gonna work and stuff.”
“G’night, Tony.”
Right before Steve was about to go on, Tony stopped him and said, “I want you to prepare yourself, Steve. These guys have been fighting a long time. They might not be that, um, happy with the show. It’s a little too cheerful for what they’ve been through.”
“You’re better off without her.”
“We know how much you love us.”
“What…why is…Tony!” Bucky grunted in pain next to him. “How is he…there? This isn’t right…I remember…I see him…”
“Could you…” He forced the words from his mouth even though he already knew the answer he’d get. “Could you let me inside, JARVIS?”
“Well,” Steve smirked, “it went better than our first meeting in this century.”
Tony gulped. That was a less than passive suggestion. Tony should politely decline. He was going to, but then he thought of  Steve and the rumors he worried about. Tony probably should be seen out with a woman. He just wouldn’t have thought one this
“Since when do we do things the easy way?” Steve called back.
. Steve took a breath before he began a running leap off the platform. His muscles easily pushed him into the air, and he was soaring across the distance farther than what should have been possible. His body had done exactly what he’d wanted as he steadily landed onto the other side of the walkway.
He walked to the table and poured a finger of bourbon in each of the glasses before he filled the rest with the chilled eggnog. And really, the boys needed to learn new facial gestures because the touched disbelief was quickly becoming too common a thing. They needed to get used to this. Tony was taking care of them, and this was just how life was going be.
Fine. If Tony had to earn this the hard way, he would. His eyes narrowed as he told Philips, “My brain is the best part of me, not the only part.”
Tony worked hard not to let that simple statement cause a reaction. He was being ridiculous. He knew that. Bucky was just leaving for basic training not the war, not yet. He must have done a decent enough job hiding his reaction because neither of the boys seemed to notice.
Steve snorted. “Are you kidding? It was great, Buck!” Then Steve went on to recount the story of Tony’s awesomeness, from his witty insults to his effortless defense against Joe’s attack. Tony had to admit that hearing Steve Rogers describe him in an almost awestruck voice was making his inner ten-year old squeal with delight.
Erskine’s face was kind. “That would be quite the moral dilemma. Do you protect the one you care about or the future of people you don’t know? I believe it takes a person of extraordinary character to battle with this. Most people would choose what is best for them and those they loved. You are a good man if this decision is one you struggle with.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, “and believe me, I would have given anything for him to be that subtle with me growing up. Believe it or not, that was one of the most polite conversations I’ve had with Howard since I turned five.”
mistake you ever make, and your legacy will end before it begins.”
That pulled a reaction out of them. Steve frowned as he looked back down at Tony’s bloody shirt as if remembering the wound. Bucky almost tripped over his feet as he hurried the bandages to Tony. “Sorry! I forgot. Let’s get your shirt off, and I’ll help you clean and wrap the cut.”
Steve had been working with Iron Man long enough to recognize damage from a gauntlet blast when he saw it. So either Tony had been ridiculously careless with his tech (Steve didn’t believe that for a minute), or he’d been attacked and taken somewhere. He didn’t like the thought of that.
“It’s not free, it’s mostly a trade.” He corrected. “I'll still get paid, just a lower amount with the implied healthcare benefits, and I’ll still be working odd jobs around the neighborhood, but I’ll be on call for when the hospital needs me. I might even get more jobs with the hospital staff if any of their appliances break down. It’s a win-win for everybody.”
Tony eyed Steve’s straining dick then looked up to his face. “Go on, beautiful, show me how you like it.”
They all sat down to eat. At first, Bucky was too busy inhaling the food like a starving man to make much conversation, spaghetti must indeed be his favorite, but when two-thirds of his plate had been cleared (along with three more slices of toast), he finally spoke.
Steve smiled. “Good morning,” he said as he went to kiss each of their cheeks, thrilling at the knowledge that he could now do this with both of them, before taking his seat. “This looks good.”
“Good, because I was thinkin’ of you the whole time.”
“Ahhh, yes! Daddy!” And Bucky was coming. Tony’s vision nearly whited out as Bucky’s ass spasmed and clenched around him, and his hand was painted with Bucky’s spunk. Tony groaned as he felt his release crash through him, spilling into Bucky who’s twitching hole was milking him. The wave of pleasure in his body was echoed by the last word Bucky had groaned as he orgasmed.
“I’m a genius,” he said honestly. “I don’t mean that in a bragging sort of way, just the literal having an intelligence level so high it’s genius kind of way, but I made some bad choices, trusted the wrong people, and it cost me everything. I tried to start over, and I chose Stark as a joke to myself. To remind me that even though I’d lost everything, I still had my mind. Everyone thinks of brilliance when they hear the name Stark. I’m well educated, but I’ve always tried to learn more. I speak eight languages.”
He could tell Bucky was not altogether happy about Steve receiving a book about war strategies. He probably believed it would only encourage Steve to keep trying to enlist, but Tony knew that Steve would do that anyway so he wanted his baby boy to be as ready as he could be. Just like he wanted Bucky to be ready.
…oh god!”
“I don’t like planes,” Bucky murmured nervously next to him. “This is my first time flying, and I can say that I don’t like it.”
He could see how easily it could have happened, and Steve wouldn’t have known what to do. He might have hurt Bucky unintentionally. Bucky could have done that floating thing and freaked Steve out because he wouldn’t have known what was going on. Then he might not have been able to give Bucky what he’d needed because he would have been panicking when it was his job to stay calm and soothe him.
They all nodded in agreement.
Steve and him had finally taken a chance and fooled around like they used to do. No quick hidden kisses or silently jerking each other off in the middle of the night so they weren’t discovered. And Fuck, it had been good.
It had only been the next morning when he’d felt the lingering soreness and tried to diagnose what his body was recovering from. And recover it did. It was why he’d taken the risk in the first place. If he could survive getting hit by a multi-ton vehicle, he could survive a round of rough sex with his enhanced lover. He’d survived many more rounds since then, too.
“I couldn’t…she’s not, not you. This is only…uhhnng.”
A lot of people had speculated on their friendship over the decades. Friends since childhood, from the playground to the battlefield and all that, but Tony was getting the inside look. And it was more than friendship; it was closer to family. James and Steve had only each other. Tony had learned more about them last night after the whole porn incident.
He closed his eyes as he rode the wave of his climax through the aftershocks; his body still tingling. He eventually reopened them when he felt Steve gently pull out of him. He turned his head to see Bucky laying beside him and panting through his recovery.
Bucky actually laughed at that, and Steve was relieved that he was allowing himself this and trying to put the events of the night behind him. “It would be hard for it to be worse than that. How many times did I try to kill you?”
They both nodded, not sure where he was going with this.
“Most likely not,” Erskine agreed, “but I think I understand why you need it. At least, as much as I can understand.” He looked at Tony speculatively as they released hands. “It’s harder than I imagined it would be, not knowing. I want to ask if I am close. Who is the individual that will help me realize my dream, the good man who will become great.” He sighed. “Almost every soldier I see is the same. Strong men who want to be stronger. Bullies looking for a new target to attack.”
a hero, Buck. You’ve always been my hero. I don’t want anything more than you’re willing to give me, but I will take everything you have to offer. Yes, I want Tony back, and of course he would make me happy, but that doesn’t change the fact that I need you too. Can you…do you still want to be with me? Us?”
“We haven’t gone anywhere.”
Steve sighed. “I don’t think he’s ever had to use it. All the times he and his gang have gone after people, they usually just rough ‘em up and leave. I don’t think they expected Tony to kick their asses.” And he had. It had been surreal to watch.
the people he cares about that they are important. All because Tony can’t bring himself to say it.
Bucky felt his mouth pull into a small smile as he relaxed his head against Steve’s thigh again and let himself believe that. He could do this. If Steve still wanted him, then Bucky would do his best to be good for him. “Love you too. ‘Til the end of the line, punk.” He answered as he felt Steve’s fingers resume their soothing movements in his hair.
“We’re getting you out of here, gorgeous,” Tony told him as he grabbed one arm to loop around his shoulder and support him as Steve did the same for the other.
Bucky bit his bottom lip, tilted his head down and looked at Tony through his lashes. “That wouldn’t be right. What would your date say if you brought me along?”
As he and Steve hurriedly each packed a bag of what would be needed in their rescue of Bucky, Tony’s heart was racing. He had to keep reminding himself that this would work. They would find the base and rescue Bucky along with the other prisoners. Tony knew this, but it didn’t calm his nerves. Which was bad because Tony’s mouth tended to run away from him when he was like this.
“Why do I feel like I’m about to hear a but?” The man asked, resigned.
“Don’t sell yourself short. You’re far too lovely to believe that.”
“I’m kinda greedy, though. I think I’m gonna want it a lot of ways.” He twisted his hands on the upstrokes and slid a thumb over each of their slits. Steve hissed as Bucky’s hips jerked.
“Tony,” Steve said after a few moments of silence. “What was all that?”
fellas. Two people to love him and for him to love. He felt so lucky. No matter what happened to him in this life, he thought, no matter how bad it got, as long as he got to keep Steve and Tony, he would be OK. They would take care of him.
“Dates?” They asked in unison. They did that a lot.
Bucky bent down to pick up some papers that had fallen from Steve’s pocket. “How many times is this?” He asked, trying to control his anger when he saw another 4F enlistment form. “Oh, you’re from Paramus now?” He asked as Steve continued to check over himself for signs of dirt and damage. “You know it’s illegal to lie on your enlistment form, and seriously, Jersey?” He said with distaste.
Erskine nodded. “He is indeed a very rough man to know, but I admire his dedication to defeating Hydra.”
“Buonasera, my friends!” He exclaimed happily. Tony sometimes entertained the thought that the man reminded him of an older looking Italian Thor. He was just so loud and happy most of the time, as well as kind to the people in his life. Francesco was the god of pasta, and Tony firmly believed he had a magical saucepan in the kitchen that helped to make everything so delicious.
Tony felt a smile that reached his eyes appear with the news that they’d received another piece of post from their long distance partner. “And you waited to tell me why?” Tony asked without heat.
Thankfully, Tony was heading home a little early today, which was good because last night had been a clusterfuck for his plans. Yes, they’d had a very productive and healthy talk about their dynamic, and what they each wanted in this relationship moving forward. Not much would actually change between them. They would basically have what they’d already had with the addition of physical and romantic affection.
“Hey fellas, come here often?” He joked as he took off his coat and shoes.
“I know, doll, I know. But you know why we can’t. If Tony found out…” Steve gasped at something Bucky must have done. “If he found out, he might leave. He might not hate it like most people, but we don’t know if he’d be OK living with it.”
“In here, Tony.” Bucky called from the kitchen. As he crossed the small space to round the little wall that held a closet, he saw the both of them finishing with dinner.
“It’s the hill I’ll die on,” Steve agreed. “It hurt him. I know it did when I said he wasn’t a hero.”
“How the hell have you memorized the entire periodic table?” Steve retorted.
So, naturally, Steve was in the gym and was probably on his second punching bag by now, maybe his third if those new upgrades didn’t work as well as promised.
“JARVIS, play
**Tony’s POV**
Tony could see how it ate at Steve’s pride to admit this. That his physical limitations somehow made him less of a man, which was bullshit.
The lies, half-truths and constantly watching over everything he said and did had pushed him to a breaking point. Realizing he was in love with two people who couldn’t love him back was the final straw. Well, that and the crash of adrenaline after a fight and getting slashed across the stomach.
“I see your point,” Erskine nodded before he sighed. “Perhaps it is the scientist in me that hates not knowing.”
“Destiny and fate can be harsh masters.” Erskine told him. “Presumably in your original past, I never would have met you. I would have continued on my way to this diner and lived my life as I was meant to. Yet, you just so happen to have the misfortune of running into one of the few men in this city who would be able to sense that you don’t belong here. Fate? Destiny? Something is pushing you in the direction you need to go, Mr. Stark. I do not believe in coincidence anymore, not after everything I have seen.”
Steve looked at the map a few feet away as he swiftly memorized the markers and landscapes. It was one of the benefits he’d gotten from the serum, near perfect recall. “Yes, sir, I do.” Steve said as he turned to walk past Agent Carter.
Another bullet ricocheted off the doorway as Schmidt quickly disappeared, and Steve looked back at Tony. “The bastard’s lucky my SMG ran out of ammo earlier. If I hadn’t been stuck with this pistol…Fuck it, we gotta get out of here.”
“Yeah, overwhelming.” Bucky said flatly. “I think that covered it when we both did a face plant in Strange’s entryway. How do you fix it?”
“Can I see?” Tony moved to catch a glimpse over the younger man’s shoulder, but Steve deftly tilted the sketchpad away from view.
“Yes, they are.” The other man said before knocking back the last of his whiskey and standing. He moved over to a map board a few feet away, and Tony now saw that the previous HYDRA base was marked off the map. The Colonel stared at the map for a long time.
The others nodded before they began to make their way across the lobby. “I think this is the fanciest place I’ve ever been in,” Dugan muttered, and everyone, including Monty, agreed.
What was he going to do?
,” the A.I. from the footage responded. “
His vision blinking out for a second as his blood pounded in his ears. When he slowly came back down, he felt disgusted with himself.
“I passed him in the hall more than once, and he had red lipstick smeared on his cheek.” Tony said like it was obvious what that meant.
Tony didn’t understand. “But why?”
To this Bucky nodded in agreement, his mouth too stuffed with garlic toast for him to speak.
“That’s enough!” Tony said firmly, and both of their heads whipped around to him. “I’m stopping this right now before one of you says something you’ll really regret.”
Tony’s mind was working double time. Was this a casual chat between neighbors? Maybe she was just being friendly and trying to help the poor hermit out of his shell. Or was this a passive suggestion? Did she want him to ask her to the dance hall? It couldn’t be. He didn’t know how old she was, but he knew it was a lot younger than him.
“Alright Tony,” Steve conceded, “that’s fair.” James nodded at Steve’s words.
He had gotten Steve to tell him more about Tony from before Bucky had arrived. He’d made the blonde tell him more about their first meeting that went so badly. The first time they’d fought with each other before they learned to fight side by side. Bucky had been surprised to hear how rude Tony had been to Steve. It seemed so strange to him against all the memories he now had of the man because Tony had adored them.
“An appetizer,” Tony told him. “A little treat before the main course.”
So things were better. Tony had a purpose. Tony had a job, something worth getting up for in the morning and would take his mind off how much he was beginning to miss his old life. Pepper, Rhodey, JARVIS, his bots, his teammates. It was almost a constant pang in his heart. Steve and Bucky were great. Really. But Tony still felt guilty at the half-truths he told, the omissions he had to make. He was constantly walking a fine line, and it was wearing him down.
Steve’s answering smile was nearly enough to make Tony forget the throbbing ache in his back. He supposed spinal damage took a little time to get over. Tony briefly wished he had some frame of reference for this healing rate of his, but that wasn’t really an option for him. He did have Steve, however, and he would gladly make do with that to boost his spirits.
Tony thought of how to tell them the most truthful answer he could. “Well, I was actually approached because of what I know and what I can do. Do you remember how I told you about my time in captivity, and how I made a valuable prisoner?”
Bucky huffed. “I know that,” he said, frustrated. “It’s just, I’m not…”
“Buck, we don’t know where he is or how to get him home.” Steve pointed out.
, a small medical kit to add to the bag.
Bucky smiled shyly and said, “Yes, daddy.” Before he leaned forward and slid the tip of his cock into Tony’s waiting mouth, groaning softly at finally getting some contact.
He heard Steve’s gasp beside him and knew the blonde was reliving the same things.
It hurt Steve at how uncertain Bucky sounded of his new memories. “You’re right, Buck. I used to cook all the time.”
He kissed Steve once more then murmured, “Sleep, beautiful. We can talk more tomorrow if you want.”
“You got us tree?”
Silence followed Bucky’s words. They all knew what would happen, Tony more than the others. Bucky was about to leave, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He’d go to a base somewhere and train, then he’d be shipped off.
“You made him a better person,” Bucky said, breaking the silence of the kitchen. The only other sound was the sizzling of bacon and the stirring of the waffle batter Steve was making.
Bucky stopped on the next step, shock running through him. How? How was he remembering this? It wasn’t related to Stark being in his past. Maybe the memory of Stark asking about his name triggered the forgotten memory in his damaged mind. He couldn’t know for sure, and figured the reason behind it wasn’t important. He just thought back and pictured his mother’s face again.
It was cold. Steve knew it was cold. He could feel it in the air, but he wasn’t as affected by it as he knew the men were. He just hoped the march would help to warm them until the sun could rise. At least the moon combined with the light of the trucks allowed them to see where they were going. Steve’s night vision was better now, but he could imagine what the darkness was like for the soldiers following.
Bucky actually chuckled. “So did I. I’m sorry, but I just…I hated hearing that about you. Even if you were the one saying it.
The place was in full swing when they’d walked in. Couples were dancing out on the floor to songs by Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey and all the other big names he heard on the radio. They’d found Steve and Bucky soon enough.
“Is it wrong that I don’t want him change?” Bucky asked. “It’s like he’s starting to spiral, and I don’t want to lose him because of it. I need my Tony back. We both do.”
Tony nodded as he sat in the chair that would put him between his boys at the square table. He wanted them on both his sides.  “James got himself a dream job today. We’re celebrating.”
So that happened. Tony finally let himself feel the weight of his emotions. It's a good thing Steve and Bucky had his back; however he still has miles to go. Tony's life philosophy is emotional repression, but don't worry, we'll soon be back to the fluff. And dare I say a dash of smut?
“Shut up, punk, and show him the goods.” James hadn’t taken his eyes off his needlework, but his smirk was positively indecent.
Steve nodded. “It’s just a little further and to the left. Then you can rest a bit. OK, love?”
Steve laughed at this, but Bucky looked troubled. “I can’t bake like Stevie.”
“We’re so sorry, Tony.” Steve’s voice softly said next to his ear. “We didn’t mean any of it. You were right, and we’re so sorry.”
There was just something about him that drew Steve in. He hadn’t seen it at first when they’d met. He’d been too bitter and self-righteous, but as he’d grown to really know Tony…Well, he’d be a liar if he said he wasn’t fascinated by him.
“Buonasera, Francesco,” Tony answered as he was pulled into a hug. “I hear these two reserved our usual table?” He nodded at Steve and Bucky behind him.
Steve shrugged. “It’s about all I can do to help besides the cooking and laundry. I’m too sick to work at the docks like Bucky, and when I do find a job, I usually get fired for missing work to fight a fever or something.”
The husband and wife both made their exits, and Tony was left alone with his boys. “I’d say we don’t need the menus tonight, right?”
I don't really want to say much more on this chapter because I don't want to spoil anything. So, enjoy? And please don't hate me.
Tony grabbed the glass and swallowed half of it. Phillips took a smaller sip as he waited for Tony speak. His mind was still reeling. He’d had no idea this was why Phillips had always been so dismissive of him. In the Colonel’s mind, Tony was a petty criminal, no matter what his talents had been.
“So what are you doin’ today?” Bucky asked as he went to the icebox and grabbed the small bottle of milk to give to Tony.”
Tony’s hands stopped briefly, then resumed before saying. “We don’t want you to be uncomfortable with anything. If you just want to wash, and for us to hold you after that, then that’s what we’ll do. We just want to make sure you’re ready before anything more happens.”
“Well, we can just be glad he wanted to do something right in all this.” He said weakly.
***Bucky’s POV***
He thought back to their first night together with Tony. It had been wonderful, and Steve felt his skin heating as he remembered Bucky between them being so good and eager as he took both of them. He remembered the next day when their horrible neighbor had threatened them. They had been so scared, but Tony had handled everything once he’d gotten home. He’d been amazing, both with how he protected them and the conversation they’d had afterwards.
Steve looked a little relieved at that because he knew that Tony had never broken a promise he’d made. He still looked worried. “What about your contract?” He asked. “You’ll lose the hospital’s business and the benefits you got for us.”
, Tony.”
“Tony, you should be in bed.” Steve complained as he came over to help take off Tony’s shoes.
“I’m happy I met you too, Doc,” Tony said honestly. “and I’m always happy to listen. God knows that you’ve listened to enough of my problems these past two weeks.” Tony added a little more cautiously. “I appreciate what you’ve done for me, really, but I have to ask…why? Why help me? Why take the risk and trust me? Why believe me?”
“Then what took you so long to get back?” Bucky asked him. “We dropped our dates off after you left and still got home before you.”
He may not be Iron Man anymore, but he reminded himself that he was far from helpless. Yes, today had set the wheel in motion, but Tony would be damned if he was just going to lay down and let it roll over him.
The smoke around them was thick as they saw the strange blue artillery fire continue to destroy the last of the retreating Germans.
do the work. Bucky knew he was among the top of the trainees here. He would work even harder to make it to the very top. He'd try with everything he had. When Bucky shipped out with the rest of them, he would be leaving with the rank of sergeant. He wouldn’t settle for anything less.
Tony walked along with Steve, taking in the sights and voices around him. It was surreal. So different from his time and his life that he had to wonder if this was how Steve had felt after the ice. An interloper. A stranger not fitting in and barely understanding his surroundings. Some of the words and phrases he heard were odd, and he didn’t quite know the meanings even if he understood the words.
He felt the eyes of his friends and the other prisoners on him as he was led away. They’d taught him what to do in this situation at army training, tell them nothing but your name, rank and service number. Bucky couldn’t believe he was here now. As they pushed him through that metal doorway, and he heard the ominous clang as it closed, Bucky felt a tear fall.
Both of their faces were awash with anger and tears. Steve’s breathing was labored from the strain of his emotions.
It would still be better than being cold and hungry, the rational part of his mind supplied. Tony looked down and realized how incongruous it would appear that someone dressed like he was would even be in this situation. Yes, the style of his suit was wrong for the time period, but it was obvious that it was made of a very expensive material and had been tailored to his body.
Like always, Steve didn’t let him down and answered Sam’s question.
With that thought Bucky’s mind chose to replay Tony’s words during his panic attack when he was too far gone to even realize that they were there with him, holding him and calling him back to himself. Bucky didn’t think Tony had even realized he was speaking his fears out loud, but he had, and the pain in his voice still hurt Bucky to think about.
“That motherfucker,” Tony spat. “I should have broken half the bones in his body and left him in the gutter. I swear to God I’m going to kick that jerkoff’s ass next time I see him.”
“Tony,” Steve choked beside his ear, “I’m so glad you’re here. I didn’t know where you were. They brought me here and told me not to leave or tell people where I was, and they had all these papers that I needed to sign and memorize.” Steve sounded frantic as he squeezed at Tony even tighter. “I didn’t know how to find you. They wouldn’t tell me anything except that you had left.”
“Yes, Sgt. Barnes.” The accented voice answered immediately.
“That you certainly do, Irish boy,” Gabe agreed. “even if it means I have to look at that face of yours while you entertain me. You two have any gals at home waiting for your ugly asses?”
Tony had forgotten that. He really had. And it pissed him off. “That’s bullshit! Are they fucking stupid?” He vented on Steve’s behalf. “You’re a great guy. What kind of moron would ditch you? Vapid little gold diggers looking for flash instead of class, that’s who. Serves them right that they’ll probably end up with an asshole who won’t keep it in his pants while she’s home with the kids.”
Still, time marched on.
It was cold. It was always so cold here at night. The smell of dirt, blood and burnt earth, burnt flesh filled every breath he took. The coughing and moaning of the men around him were already becoming easy to ignore, background noise like the sounds of the city used to be. He tried to will himself to sleep, but it wasn’t coming soon. It was hard to sleep when he knew the enemy was out there looking for them.
Suddenly, the hand around his cock released its grip, and Bucky came with a shout. Hot warmth spilled across his stomach as his vision blurred. His head arched back as his toes curled, and his fingers dug deeper into the twisted sheets. The orgasm was intense, and his body was spasming around the dick that was still moving inside him. The pleasure grew to be almost too much as his lovers continued to move on top of him, fucking him through his orgasm and pushing him further into a world of deep sensation.
He pulled out in one long slow slide, stopping just before the head came free and pushing back in. He repeated the motion until he felt Bucky completely relax, then ground his hips against his ass, going as deep as he could. Bucky whimpered, but Tony could hear the arousal in it.
“Fuck you!” Joe spat as he lunged. Tony dodged the first punch and landed one of his own to Joes mouth, but the left uppercut from Joe got him in the jaw. His head whipped back violently as he wondered if some teeth were knocked loose. That’s when a knife came up and slashed at his stomach. Tony barely had time to jump back as he felt the blade cut through his shirt and graze his abdomen in a quick burn of pain.
The men nodded but still waited, then Steve remembered, “Dismissed.” That was apparently what was needed because the men broke away to begin following his orders. He wondered why they automatically all deferred to him. There had to be other officers here, right? Steve noticed that the men that had been closest, the ones who’d spoken to Bucky or himself, seemed the most determined to do their job well and quickly. He looked back down to Bucky who was trying to get to his feet. “You need to rest, Buck.”
he promised himself as he waited for someone to approach. No one did.
“Service topping,” Tony said kindly. “Is what I told you last night. You are in charge, but you are doing the things that your submissive wants or had asked you to do. You probably feel a great deal of pleasure and arousal providing these things, right?”
care. I know you like him. I’ve seen the way you look at him.”
Clint nodded. “It’s a good look on you.”
“Now we get to worry about other things,” Bucky said as he moved to sit up more carefully this time.
“I know,” he said easily, “but I wanted to. It’s been a tough year. For all of us. And I never had the Christmas thing growing up. I think I spent less than five actual holidays with my parents so I wanted this. I get to eat and sing songs and celebrate with my friends. It’s really very selfish me when you think about it.”
It had taken another three days after he’d come home from the hospital before Steve had allowed Tony to return to work, and that was with Tony practically pleading with him and reminding Steve that he had a job with the army, and they would want him back soon. Of course, Tony had managed to contact Erskine after his release from the hospital and let him know what had happened.
Steve carded his fingers through Bucky’s hair. “I want him to feel it, love. Want to watch him choke on you.” He looked down at Tony, mouth still open and waiting. “Ask him for it.”
“Wait!” Tony glanced to Bucky, then Steve and back again. “You
Bucky was right. Life wasn’t fair, and it was hard most of the time, but that didn’t mean you were allowed to stop trying. Because if you tried hard enough, you might finally make it to the other side of forever.
“It keeps my lip warm,” Dugan told them, “and I was a strong man act, Jones. Could lift over twice my weight and throw it across a room without breaking a sweat.”
Bucky looked up at Steve, surprised to hear him say that.
He made an effort to put aside time just for Steve after their day in Manhattan. Steve had loved the museum, and Tony loved Steve so everyone was happy. He’d taken Steve to a couple of baseball games, and they’d eaten hotdogs as they’d cheered for the Dodgers. Tony wasn’t a huge baseball fan, but again, it made Steve happy, so he was happy. Sometimes, they would just stay in and play cards as the radio softly played in the background. Those were some of Tony’s favorite moments. Once upon a time, Tony never would have believed this would be something he’d get to have.
Did they even explain clothing sizes to Steve when he came out of the ice? And it looks like he went and taught Barnes all of his bad habits. Tiny T-shirts everywhere, every day. It was distracting is what it was.
Steve watched as Bucky happily grabbed the container from Tony’s hand and began to shovel what looked like some kind of stew into his mouth. He couldn’t seem to eat fast enough, and Steve really hoped he didn’t make himself sick from eating so quickly, but he couldn’t bring himself to make him slow down.
They quickly moved into the brightly lit factory floor, and this was going to be tricky, Tony thought. People were moving all around them, working or patrolling. They crouched and moved between pieces of equipment as they made their way through the room until they came upon a table with glowing munitions. At least, that’s what it looked like to Tony before his glasses informed him what it was made of.
“Actually,” Tony said, “you will find that in my contract, that was notarized and which I also have a copy, it states that upon dissolution of the contract, it would require a formal date of termination that would also have to be notarized.”
Steve looked confused for a moment then brightened. He got up and went to the dresser, opening the top drawer, before returning with some vaseline and a couple condoms. He put them next to Tony then moved over to kneel beside Bucky’s head.
Steve frowned. “I don’t think it’s right that I…”
He’d never heard James talk so much, which he now thought was a shame because the guy was kinda funny, and that voice...
“How is he doing, Tony?” Steve asked in a husky voice from above him. “Bucky really wanted to try this. Is he doing a good job?” He lifted himself slightly so Tony could answer.
That was a nice way to put it, Tony figured.
James snorted in disbelief. “On that thing? You don’t have to be gracious, it’s like sleeping on rocks.” Next to him Steve nodded tiredly in agreement.
“Sorry, Dum,” Bucky answered, “I think the last tavern we passed was bombed out.”
“I’d never let that happen.” Tony told him firmly. “Never.”
The strange voices were lying. There was no safe, not here where it was always cold, and they were always watching, ready to hurt him again and again until he broke. Tony didn't want to hurt anymore. He couldn't survive the water again. He thrashed harder.
Tony was wiping tears from his eyes when he asked, “How’d they react?”
He understood the reason behind it. Steve wasn’t an idiot, and he knew that barely eight months of freedom after seventy years of torture and blood would not be enough to heal the damage done to Bucky. It would probably never go away. That didn’t mean that it still didn’t hurt every time Steve wanted to hug him or hold him and knew that he couldn’t.
“My little soldier,” Tony murmured before he resumed his earlier thrusts and pulled Steve down onto him. Tony’s hips and hands were working in perfect tandem as he fucked into Steve like his life depended on it. Sweat covered both of their bodies, and the hot dampness of their sliding skin mirrored the wet heat that Tony was burying himself in. It was so good, so rough. It was always this way with Steve, animalistic abandon as their two bodies crashed together over and over again.
“I’ve never needed to,” Bucky said gruffly, looking mildly aggravated with Clint.
to do today. Everything else can wait.”
“I wasn’t supposed to tell anyone, Buck,” Steve said honestly. “And I really couldn’t put that in a letter.”
part of his brain. He had a similar file for Bucky.
“I hope so,” JARVIS replied. “I was designed to be that way.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Are you telling me you know someone who sells things that have, for lack of a better term, fallen off the back of a truck?”
and write a note for his future self to not go to the Sanctum that morning. He could at least do that, right?
“I love you, too, Stevie.” He whispered. “Always.”
Ever since gaining his freedom from Hydra, Bucky hardly slept. When he did, it was usually on the floor. Fully dressed and armed, he’d sit in a corner with his back against the wall in an effort to protect himself from an attack. He’d never used the bed in his quarters, so this level of comfort and rest felt foreign to his body, even though he knew that he couldn’t have been sleeping more than three hours. This was a feeling he now remembered of a time before becoming the asset.
“Awww no, Tony,” Steve huffed. “Why would you do that? She’s gonna be expecting someone that’s…that’s not me. Someone she won’t step on.”
For one of the first times during sex, he felt that he could let himself fall, and they would catch him. The knowledge left him dizzy as their lips and warm bodies comforted him.
Bucky whined at the feeling, trying to let himself go. His fingers and toes were tingling as they curled in the sheets. Every inch of him had been rubbed and kissed and petted over the course of the evening, and he let himself fall into it. The tremors in his body continued, but he gave into them. It had been months since he’d trembled with anything but fear and hunger, and the pleasure he felt was washing all of it away.
Steve smiled a little. “Should I call you old man, then?”
Silence followed for a moment before Clint cut in looking surprised. “Hold up! Did you just make a joke?” He looked to the others as if asking for confirmation. “Yeah, I know it was dry as hell and sarcastic as fuck, but I have
Steve realized that this man must have been close to Bucky and was probably from the 107th. His thoughts were confirmed when Bucky tiredly looked back at him and said, “It ain’t that easy to kill me. You should know better than that by now, Dum.”
“Hey, love. Welcome back.”
“You don’t have to come, Tony,” Steve told him quietly as he tightened the straps more firmly for the blonde. “This is dangerous enough without risking yourself. I promise to bring him back if he’s there.”
Tony and Steve stood in silent anticipation as they waited at the bus station for Bucky to arrive. All around them were other people waiting for their loved ones and friends to return home after the months they’d spent away at army training. There was an excitement shared by everyone there as they saw the bus approaching.
“I don’t mean to inconvenience you,” Tony began, “but would you mind showing me where? It’s well past lunch, and I have a long trip to Brooklyn ahead of me.”
Tony decided that the boys had been through too much today to go forward with his plans for a special evening of celebration. He got them to relax as he made some sandwiches. Steve had balked that Tony had worked all day, and he could do it, but Tony wasn’t having it. That kind of anxiety was exhausting, and they’d lived with it all day.
“Doll, please, I need to…” Bucky begged.
It had all vanished when he’d seen Tony and Steve waving at him across the way. They had looked so happy, something he remembered reflected his own joy at being home. Tony had never looked so ruggedly handsome as he had with his thick, trimmed beard and the light pattern of bruises that were almost healed. They’d gone out for dinner at their favorite restaurant, and Bucky felt a pang in chest as he now thought about how his old friends were no longer living. He’d gained and lost a lot of friends in the course of one day. At least, that’s how it felt.
And Tony did, he wanted all of him. As Steve continued his unhurried thrusts into him, he lifted his hands to grab at Bucky’s ass behind his head and gently squeezed, encouraging him to use Tony as he needed. Tony’s body jerked when Steve’s next thrust was hard and deep.
Tony’s face froze for a moment before his mouth snapped shut. He wordlessly took the offered plate of food and mumbled his thanks. Steve would have sworn his cheeks looked flushed. Was he getting a fever?
He loved Bucky. With all his heart. He had since he was fifteen, and six years later nothing had changed that. “I love
“Nah,” Bucky said as he scanned the room again, “I’ve been to Jersey. This ain’t it.”
“That contract is now ended,” the doctor threatened. “You will be obligated to pay your bill in full before you leave; including your treatment, the tests that have been performed and your stay here. The removal of your casts and bindings will also be out of pocket since you are doing this against medical advice.”
He opened his eyes and saw the man laying next to him, sleeping peacefully. His brown hair was disheveled, but Bucky was certain his looked worse after…God, he’d had sex with Tony, amazing sex. Which only goes to show that sometimes Steve was wrong. He had taken a huge chance in kissing Tony, but it had paid off. He had thought he could keep his feelings to himself, but he soon realized he wouldn’t be able to keep up the charade much longer.
Steve gave a small smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Yeah, Buck can really move. You should see him when he’s really showing off.”
It may have been premature, but Tony was internally patting himself on the back.
Bucky could feel the plates in his arm shifting from his agitation as he pulled at his hair with his fists. His head was shaking, telling the voices
They looked mildly surprised at that but recovered quickly. Monty smiled, “Perhaps in time we shall. You may not feel the need of the title, Captain, but you most certainly earned it.”
***Avenger’s Tower***
Steve put him down and picked up his shield and bag. “Now what?”
Tony Stark? From Brooklyn?” Millie asked, surprised, pulling Tony’s attention back to her.
“We’d just turned onto the street when we saw you
Tony had woken the next morning before the sun had risen. He was still tired, but he knew there was no way he’d be able to go back to sleep. It hadn’t been a dream. He was still here on Steve and James’s old, worn sofa. Apparently, this wasn’t a spell that broke at midnight, and he doubted that Glenda the good witch was gonna show up anytime soon with a pair of sparkly red heels for him to use to get home. And that was a shame, he looked good in red.
He moved back and spread Bucky as wide as he could to watch his partially loosened hole open for him. “You’re so fucking gorgeous, honey. It’s driving me crazy, all the sweet sounds you’re making.”
“Can you feel me through him, love? Your daddy’s letting me fuck you through him. We both love you so much.”
“Did you do that?” He asked as his mind replayed what had been said on the screen.
He met Steve’s eyes and was stunned by the look of gratitude he saw there. Tony knew Steve often felt like a burden to Bucky, and it usually ate at his pride being a grown man that relied on his friend for so much knowing the weight it put on Bucky’s shoulders. Tony had relieved Bucky of that weight and let him feel taken care of for once in his life. Steve mouthed a soft ‘thank you’ before he turned back to his friend and put his hand on his shoulder.
“G’ night, Buck.” Steve yawned, “Night, Tony.”
Tony exhaled. “That brings up another topic of safe words.”
“You don’t really know me, Bucky.” And how could he, when Tony had lied since he’d met them? “The way I grew up, the way I lived, I was a spoiled, selfish asshole. I drank and partied and slept with whoever I wanted, did whatever I wanted while not giving a shit about the people I used in the process. I used them to feel better so I didn’t have to think about what a fuck-up I am. So I didn’t have to think about my dad getting drunk and beating on me because I was a disappointment. So I didn’t have to deal with him cursing at me and calling me useless and a…”
