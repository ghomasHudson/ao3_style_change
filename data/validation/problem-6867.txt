“You do know it’s just allergies, right? I’m not going to die, or even need hospitalization. The idea is preposterous. You know who could die though? Natasha. Which is why I really-”
After a few minutes Steve tenderly pulled out of Tony, and tucked himself back into his pants. Without a word, he turned and stormed out of the workshop. Tony was sure if it wasn’t a sliding door, he would have slammed it.
It smelled like piss, and it was nearly impossible to hear Sam over the commotion of the dogs. Kennels lined either side of the room, each one inhabited by a hopeful furry face. A woman was talking to them, providing information on the adoption process no doubt. Tony ignored her in favor of looking down both lines of cages.
The hand in Tony’s hair tightened. Tony stilled and rolled his eyes up to look at Steve. The man was blissed out, his pupils dilated, cheeks dusted with pink, and lips parted. And then Tony let Steve take over. His hips pushed, sliding his dick in and out of Tony’s mouth at a leisurely pace. It wasn’t long before the tempo changed, and he used his grip to shove Tony down and thrust forward at the same time.
With a grin Steve conceded a bit, adding another finger. He liked taking his time opening Tony up, feeling the resistance he started with, and the way he split and spread until he was gaping. He rubbed and pressed against Tony’s satin inner walls, lingering longer than necessary until Tony growled heatedly.
“How many have you had and how long ago?” Steve’s voice was the combination of stern and affectionate it took on when Tony was being “obstinate” or “self-negligent”.
For a few long seconds Steve just stared at him, and then his face was breaking into one of his free smiles. The kind that were rare and Tony strived to collect. “How’d I get such an amazing fella?”
Vibrating with emotion, Steve turned and swept his lamp clear off his desk, sending it shattering against the wall. “Dammit, Tony!” He turned away and wiped his hand down his face. “Don’t you get it?” He turned to look at Tony again. “You scared me! And yes, the civilians are my priority, but I can’t run the gamble on your life all the damn time. And you know what? We don’t know that more civilians would have died if we’d gone with my plan. You. Don’t. Know that.” Steve’s chest heaved.
Quickly, Steve dropped his gaze and clumsily fumbled to turn the tablet’s screen back on. At a chuckle from Tony he sheepishly looked back up.
Taking Steve by surprise, Tony grabbed Steve’s wrist to break his hold while surging to his feet. He walked forward, shoving Steve back against the nearest wall with surprising force. A picture fell. The sound of breaking glass went ignored.
The super soldier stood rooted to the spot, frowning at the floor and rubbing his thumb over his bottom lip. After several long minutes he finally looked up to where Tony left, a slight one sided smile blossoming on his lips, and eyes shining with a melancholy tenderness.
Tony noticed the change of Steve’s response. Usually Steve was bashful and shy and embarrassed after, but now it was like he was basking in them. He eyed Steve curiously, thoughtfully, before he sipped his coffee again.
Steve stood from the stool before he walked around Tony’s desk. “Because usually I’m able to actually get you to your bed, but for a reason different than what they think.” His voice was more gruff than usual, or maybe Tony was just getting turned on easily.
Wait – that’s incorrect. FRIDAY has definitely done that before. FRIDAY’s just never not told Tony who he was meeting with. Tony didn’t care for surprise visits. Or surprise anything for that matter.
Steve held the mug in both his hands for a moment before he lifted it up and took his first sip. “Is it possible to repeat a day?” He asked vaguely before he finally met eyes with Tony.
Steve just shook his head before he pulled Tony closer. “I love you,” He breathed out then started to press light kisses over Tony’s face. “I have for a while…”
It was just a couple minutes after that when the waiter brought over our food. The waffles smelt mouthwatering with the chocolate chips resting on top of them.
“Explain something else to me?” Steve pleaded with sweet eyes directed at Tony. “You’re so captivating.” Tony was Steve’s anchor for reality.
Steve grabbed the keys with his free hand, his other hand holding some protein energy drink. “Alright. I’ll start her up,” He offered with a small smile.
“I remember those!” Tony exclaimed in excitement as he hit his steering wheel. “When I was younger I snuck into my dad’s office and found those videos on his computer. Fuck, I had completely forgotten about them.”
Steve sat in one of the chairs, rigid and tense. He still hasn’t said a word to Tony or looked into his eyes. Steve couldn’t bring himself to.
“There had to be something, right?” Tony moved closer, and suddenly Steve was aware he didn’t think to pull on more clothes than just his boxers. “I can try to help, but you have to tell me what you’re hiding from me.”
Steve quickly wetted a part of the shirt with water before he dabbed at Tony’s chest. Steve focused solely on what he was doing. If he didn’t, then his eyes would betray him and wander over the rest of Tony’s still perfectly intact skin.
“You know? You’re a good man, Tony,” Steve began to blurt out in his drunken thoughts. “You look a hell of a lot better than your father, that’s for sure.”
He wanted to enjoy this moment without thinking of the loop, but the negative thoughts slipped in anyways. Once asleep, he would wake up in his bed for yet another Thursday. For all Tony would know, none of this would have happened. It would just be any other ordinary day.
It had made him want to cry in embarrassment. With abductors as inadequate as Becker and Marco, two men whose combined IQs were probably half that of Tony's, both men in their early thirties where the first pains and aches started to appear, clearly amateurs when it came to kidnapping a person, since they were barely able to keep Tony in check....with all of that taken into account, Tony should've been gone hours ago!
Jim stared at the alley wall, eyeing the mortar-filled gaps up and down, glaring hard at the red brick, as if he was willing the wall to reveal its secrets.
will go through ANTHONY STARK, in order to protect the legacy of the Stark name. The final say resides in the combined votes of the CEO-to-be RICHARD DARROW (50%), ANTHONY STARK (30%), the board of directors (BOD) (20%) and the Chairman of the BOD (1%).
Hope the contract wasn't too boring? I quite enjoyed fabricating it. Btw is the summary for this fic okay? I know there's stuff in it that hasn't been yet mentioned in the fic itself, but I still wanna know if it was interesting at all. I don't like how it turned out XDD
Tony tried to burrow farther into whatever it was that he was lying on, anywhere away from those hands. Those hands would hurt him, he knew that. They would cut his chest open and put in something hard and cold and painful.
Tony thinks. "We haven't met, at least not officially," he continues, "We do hold shared...interests, however."
After a beat, when Tony still doesn't budge, Rick grabs his wrist. Tomorrow there'll be an imprint of his hand circling it, Tony's sure.
Rick sighs at him, hands moving from the counter to hold onto Tony's hips, thumbs rubbing small circles against his hipbones. "It was fine, I got Anderson to
Tony damn near winces at the volume Rosie yells for him, dashing across the room at the sight of her omega dad. He catches her mid-leap, pulling her to his chest and allowing her to nuzzle and scent his neck as a greeting. He gently pets her hair and presses a kiss to her temple. "Hi, pumpkin."
It gave Steve a pause, but the reminder of Tony and Dr. Miller's involvement in his kidnapping had the opposite reaction to what Rhodes had aimed for; it hardened his resolve, even whilst the notion made him feel a bit ill.
"So," Rick begins once Rosie has managed to finally clear her plate, and the waiters are placing small cups filled with crème brûlée before them, as well as filling Tony's glass of wine for the third time that evening. Rick requests a cup of coffee, and Rosie is given juice to go with her water and dessert. "How is the good captain doing?" Rick asks, eyes on Tony as he takes a gulp from his coffee.
with her on most days, since she still hadn't forgiven Steve after the altercation with Tony. God knew, Steve had gotten stuck in the elevator more times than he cared to count in the past months he'd spent at the compound. And maybe that was his own fault. As it was, Steve hadn't been the most forthcoming with apologies, and FRIDAY could tell that Tony was still wary around him.
Ezekiel turned to look at him. His expression was that of cold, sinister fury, and it chilled Tony down to the core. He begun approaching him; in his hands, he held what looked like a baton. "Whose fault was it?" he asked.
"You sure? I hear it can be quite hard sometimes on mated pairs." Tony bites his tongue at Rogers' comment.
"What the fuck are you doing?!" someone asked, and Tony and Becker both turned to look. To Tony's chagrin, it was Marco, holding a key with a big tag attached to it.
Tony snorted. “Did they think you have a better chance of dragging me out here with your muscles?” He asked as he shook his head, a loose grin on his face. He was fond of the team, but sometimes they were ridiculous.
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” I groan as I slump back into my chair. Why Steve? Why not anyone else?
Steve positioned his shield between his legs on the floor of the car. Tony glanced down to where it was before he started up the car they were taking.
Steve shrugged almost sheepishly. “I had. Is there a problem with that?” He asked timidly – just in the slightest way though as if to hide it. Fortunately for me, I’ve gotten good at reading people over the years. It’s been the only thing keeping me and my business afloat.
Tony shrugged before he set it back down. “Loki should be locked away on Asgard, if Thor stuck by his word or Loki didn’t just escape—” They both looked at each other, and it was as if the thoughts popped into their minds at the same time.
Did Jarvis just say what I think he said? “No. I’m not going to hear this shit from you too,” I snap at the ceiling.
It wasn’t like Steve could escape to anywhere either. Tony could travel faster than a motorcycle with his suit – even if Steve’s motorcycle could go faster than others thanks to Tony himself. The suit, or Jarvis, could scan for his face in a crowd or whatever technological way that Steve doesn’t quite have the grasp of.
“Tony…” Steve swallowed the lump in his throat, not tearing his eyes away from the phone. His heart was hammering against his chest. This is the most hope he had for the loop to end. If it didn’t, well, Steve would be ruined.
Steve nodded with pursed lips. “It’s hard to believe that it’s over after five months of it…” He sighed heavily. “I never will like Thursdays.”
“Yeah?” Steve smiled a bit before he began to walk to the meadow. “This was here 70 years ago. It was one of the only places around that didn’t change when I woke up.”
“You can dig deeper,” Tony all but moaned as he pushed his back up into Steve’s hands. He blushed and swallowed thickly, pushing deeper. He needed to distract himself. The massage was a bad mistake.
Steve’s eyes landed on Tony and he smiled. “So, it takes you going to bed yourself to come to this realization, that I – by the way – have been trying to tell you for months, that sleep is good for you?” He raised an eyebrow to Tony with the smile still on his face.
Steve’s smile widened once he got an idea. “I have an idea then,” He stated then pulled on his leather jacket. “You’re going to need your sunglasses though.”
“Great idea. I don’t know anyone who would want to talk to Tony Stark anyways. You certainly never do,” I snap out as I slam the pen on top of the notepad. “I think we’ve got enough done for today. Anything else can be discussed on the way there about the mission.”
“It’s a blessing and a curse,” He chuckled lightly as he too got out the car. “But it always comes in handy, for multiple situations.”
Steve wasn’t sure, but he swore he could hear a snicker come from Tony over the comms. “If you’re done lecturing a bad guy, I’d appreciate the help,” He spoke through to Steve, and Steve could practically hear the grin on Tony’s face.
“Yeah. But it just so happens to line up with the others’ schedules. Or is that a coincidence?” I snap back in defense before I turn and get in the car. What the hell just happened there?
“What?” Tony questioned before he decided to change conversation. “Look, Steve, you seem like you need someone to talk to. Can you stay where you’re at for another – let’s see – 20 minutes?”
Sam shook his head with his own breathy laugh before he used Steve’s helpful hand to haul himself up. “Mister Smart-Guy over here thinks he’s funny, huh?”
It wasn’t the best way to opt out, but it could be a way, right? He wouldn’t have to wake up again, and he finally knows what it’s like to kiss Tony. Plus, no one needed him for 70 years and he helped save the world twice now, he was done. Right?
“Steve! Thank goodness it’s you,” I interrupt breathlessly before I walk a couple steps to stand in my doorway. By the look he was giving me, I’m assuming it looks like I just went a couple rounds in the bedroom.
Steve wasn’t just going to come back into his life after a call like that, or even in general. He had better things to do apparently.
Steve shook his head to himself before he picked it up without complaining. He was probably too antsy to get on the road to put up much of a fight over something like this.
His alarm went off the same as always in the morning. Steve stretched with a faint smile on his lips. “Another day,” He breathed out hopefully before he sat up in bed.
“In the ‘dream’ you were shot with something that was acid-like. It ate through your armor and got on you,” Steve paused the massage as he thought back to it. “It burned your front pretty badly. You had to go to medical for it.
He nodded as he wrapped his hand around his coffee mug, and I definitely wasn’t watching the way his forearm flexed at the grab. Who could blame me? “I’ve heard that from the others, but I thought I would let you know the offer is there.”
“Just a dream…” Steve mumbled to himself before he rolled his shoulders to shake off the weird vibe. He breathed out before he jogged the rest of the way as if to chase away the bad feeling.
“Yeah, the same goes for me,” Steve sighed as he got out the car as well. He braced his hands on his lower back before he started to lean back, effectively stretching out his back at the audible popping noises that followed.
“Because the director told you to, sir,” Jarvis replied as predicted. I just pout as I set aside an outfit for tomorrow. “I also believe you took it because of the Captain.”
Eventually he stopped going to Tony to try to figure it out. Every time it was the same thing. Of course, it wasn’t Tony’ fault. He couldn’t remember what he previously said to come up with something new. It just got tiring to hear the same exact thing.
Things between Tony and him have felt…different lately. There wasn’t another way Steve could really put it. And he didn’t know what to think about it. Mostly he just ignored it, and it seemed Tony did too. At least that way it wasn’t awkward between them.
Tony laughed at that. “I think it was a little bit of that and a little bit of a man crush.” He grinned then winked to Steve. “Although I can’t say I don’t blame the old man. He had good taste.”
Tony looked surprised and taken aback by that revelation, but at the same time he looked relieved and almost awed. “That’s…great. Truly, Cap. Very mature.” He sipped his coffee again. “Though, I do have one thing to say: we
Steve glanced around to make sure no one was around before he rested his hands on Tony’s waist, gently tugging to pull Tony closer. “We’re still on for dinner tonight?” The sweet smile returned on Steve’s face. He couldn’t stay mad at Tony, even if he wasn’t in the first place.
He spoke it so casually, but those words pushed on me until I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I don’t think he understands how much of a compliment that is for me.
“Where are we going?” Steve asked once he finally got his focus away from his thoughts. “The tower is the other way.”
He walked back towards his private room in confusion, his hands in his pockets. Who on Earth could this person be that FRIDAY wouldn’t even tell Tony who they are?
Tony laid his cheek on his arm and looked back to Steve as best as he could. “What was different then? Because that’s an awful lot of similarities.”
“Who the—” Steve turned around immediately when he heard someone on the stairs behind him. It was one of the five men. The guy pulled out his gun, but Steve was quicker and threw a knife at the guy and hit his neck.
He was hoping and praying that this was his last Thursday. But he knew – in the back of his mind – that this was still the first few. He was determined to savor this Thursday. He wasn’t able to forget, so he was going to make sure to remember this one better than the others.
Steve reached out and pulled the door open for us, letting me go in first. “I’m almost certain you already do to some extent,” He chuckled. “It’s like you never have an absence of knowledge.”
“Right away, sir,” Jarvis replied and searched through the internet and databases in S.H.I.E.L.D. for the pictures. They were pulled up within seconds on Steve’s phone, and he groaned.
As I mentioned, it didn’t want to close. I tried pushing on it, I tried sitting on it, and I even tried kicking it. The damn suitcase just doesn’t want to close.
Tony reached a hand out and gently rested on it Steve’s cheek. “Where have you been hiding these past months?” He breathed out in soft bewilderment.
One night Steve went to go check on Tony. He had been keeping himself in the workshop for most of the day. It was getting late, and Steve didn’t want Tony to sleep in a chair that wasn’t comfy or worse: not sleep at all.
Tony shook his head to himself as he worked on his nanotech. “Not the time,” He mumbled to himself. He had to focus. With this suit of armor, he wouldn’t have to wait to call on his armor in need, and he would be able to form any objects with just a simple thought.
Steve’s look softened a little before he shook his head. “Well, you surprised me, Stark. That’s a healthy mindset.”
“Tones?” Steve called out with a smile on his face. They could finally be alone with each other. “I was thinking that since it’s my birthday and all, we could take a nice, relaxing bubble bath together?”
“You know I won’t object to that,” Steve pointed out with a smile before he began to collect his own trash.
“Well, it’s America’s birthday, and Steve’s birthday,” Tony shrugged and grinned. “Besides, Steve is our leader. He deserved this.” He tried to remain casual, but he knew that Clint would be suspicious if he was sober. Luckily, Clint was not.
“Drive? What do you mean by drive there, Rogers?” I questioned with my eyes squinted at him and an accusing finger point to his face.
“Since our guy is trying to create AI’s, I figured that would be your specialty,” Steve began to say, but I had to interrupt.
A dumbfounded expression settled on Tony’s face before it was quickly wiped away with a shrug of his shoulders. “I totally knew that, pft.”
“I just mean I have to thank him is all,” Steve brushed off before he walked away to avoid her suspicious, mind-reading eyes.
Steve pushed himself away from the counter and turned around to put some bread in the toaster. “I’m guessing you’re going to go back down to your workshop today?”
Steve shook his head and pulled Tony – armor and all – into his arms desperately. “I’m going to get you out of here, okay?”
For the most part, we ate in silence after. Not our usual uncomfortable, tension-filled silences, but a regular silence. It was nice, especially as we ate.
did it. I…I love you so much.” He set the phone aside and pulled Tony into a hug that Steve needed dearly.
Steve gritted his teeth before he hung up the phone. He didn’t want to argue or for their words to escalate, especially with Tony on the way.
“Is this thing on?” Came Tony’s voice throughout the crowd. The attention was on him immediately, and Tony grinned when all eyes were in him. He was certainly not one to shy away from a crowd.
I decide on a table by the window this time. It was sunnier outside, and the lighting was nice. Steve’s hair always looks more blond in the sun. “Stop it,” I groan quietly to myself as I sit down. I needed to stop thinking like that. It wasn’t going to get me anywhere.
Steve held his almost empty coffee mug out to Tony. “I’ll take whatever you’re getting,” Tony gave Steve a questionable look seeing as Steve couldn’t get drunk. “I need the burn.”
After a couple requests on my first chapter, I decided to write a second! I know it took me four months, but I've been busy and exhausted from school and work. Please enjoy some closure! I know Tony will.
“Brother, what have you done here?” Thor’s tone was angry, but also worried for what his brother did. Steve did not look as friendly as he used to, even when in mid-battle.
“Bingo, Cap. Did you expect me not to? What, even when you deliberately dismantled any tracking device that I had for you, so I wouldn’t track you? Which, by the way, I’m pretty impressed by.”
Steve swallowed his own bite of food, maintaining gazes with Tony. “You can never know for certain about things like this. Especially when there’s nothing being done towards the person for you to know for sure.”
“Wait, is this why you both haven’t been doing as much with the others lately? And you’ve been blowing off our plans?” Rhodey suddenly asked Tony with a pointed look. “You could have just told me, Tony. We’ve been best friends since college.”
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “King T’Challa told me something the day I brought Bucky to him. That day we fought, he had found Zemo and talked with him before he had attempted to shoot himself. Zemo put us in a mutli-step trap that was meant to pit us against one another.”
He stopped walking alongside Steve and pulled a face. “Yeah, I get that a lot. Usually everyone thinks I’m too much, so it doesn’t matter. I know.” Tony pushed the words out his mouth, and Steve knew Tony could taste the bitterness on them.
Steve shrugged as he kept his eyes strained on the road ahead of him. At least I know he’s diligent. “Yeah, I see it. Though I think I’m just tired of not talking. There’s only so much quiet a man can take,” He dismissed, though I noticed how that last sentence was spoken – ironically – quieter.
Steve smiled faintly to himself as he ran his laps	. It was another sunny day and it made for a wonderful Friday.
I can’t be doing this. It’s not right. I rub a hand over my face before I step out the car as well, standing in front of the pump. I was just tired.
Tony’s confusion only grew deeper. “Well...just let whoever it is know I may be a little longer. I want to get freshened up since I don’t know who I’m presenting myself to.”
Steve nodded a bit and took a deep breath that came out ragged as his heart started to beat even faster. They both stared at the phone, no noise except for the hums of all the electronics and such running through the tower.
“Oh, fuck off,” I huff out as I send a glare towards Rhodey. “What gives you the right to say shit like that? I told you I didn’t like him and
He needed it all too much. Steve was there for hours before he exhausted himself and decided it would be better to retire for the night. Natasha would have sent him up before he could stray away from the punching bags.
What got him more stuck in place was the only thing that seemed different: Tony didn’t get hurt the same way he had before. The dream had been the foreign acid thing, and today it was some other weapon.
I put my hand to my chest, pulling on a fake hurt expression. “And here I thought you were just caring about my wellbeing, Cap.”
Tony watched Steve completely bewildered. “Steve, you’re kinda worrying me. I mean, alien guns? What, are they Asgardian or something?” He joked.
“Shit,” Tony rubbed a hand over his face. Steve was about to let go, beginning to feel discouraged, but then Tony spoke again. “I can’t believe I’m actually going with this.”
“That sounds like some sort of loophole,” Tony kept his eyes on Steve, trying to figure him out. “Steve…are you feeling okay?”
Steve sighed and slumped into his seat. “Yes, there’s something going on, but it doesn’t make my words any less true,” Steve tried to get Tony to believe him. “I promise. I don’t throw that word around.”
“What do you mean we have to go undercover? We’re just about the most recognizable people there are,” I attempt to argue back as I wave away the projections I had up. “I don’t think you’ve thought this through. Have you?”
Steve’s pout went away to put in a place a sweet smile. “Okay, fine. Let’s enjoy this.” He reached over to the back of the couch and pulled a blanket over the two of them before he wrapped his arms back around Tony.
Steve stumbled their make-out session back inside. “Too far. Here’s fine,” He motioned his head over to the living area of the common floor without taking his hands off of Tony.
Steve rubbed a hand over his face. “I just wanted to spend the day alone and away from everything!” He retorted.
Tony couldn’t help the small chuckle that came out of him before he stood. “Come on, Captain America. Let’s go check out that brain of yours.”
Steve started up their coffee machine again and started on their breakfast while Tony sat and listened to what the news anchors were saying now about them. The machine beeped when the coffee pot was ready, and Steve made two cups for each of them. “I thought you turned that shit off?” Steve asked as he set Tony’s mug on the countertop.
Steve set Tony’s now lifeless body down as gently as he could before he stood. His back was to the arms dealers, and they started to back away with guns held up.
It wasn’t like he was angry or upset Tony almost exposed them, because Steve was the one who was ready to finally tell everyone.
Tony patted Steve on the shoulder, leaving his hand there after instead of taking it away. “Let’s go then.”
The other slight problem is the technology is new, so he’s creating it from scratch. Plus, it’s going to be painful to implement the sensors into his skin in order for the nanotech to work properly.
Other Thursdays, Steve would just ask Tony for help finding Loki, even if he wasn’t declared lost yet.
Just like Tony said, within 20 minutes he could be heard speeding high in the sky. Steve looked up with a bit of disappointment before he stood. There were still people around, and he didn’t want the attention. Especially since Tony and him might end up arguing.
Steve rolled his eyes before he got in on the passenger side. Tony was joking about his stench as he had in the dream. He raised an eyebrow to Steve before he got in after.
Steve nodded a bit, arms crossed behind his back, before he made his way over to the living room. He sat in one of the chairs, too weirded out too sit on the couch where he had the night before. Instead he stared at the spot blankly as his thoughts wandered.
Steve’s eyes followed Tony until they couldn’t anymore. He downed the rest of his godly alcohol before he made his own way towards the elevators on the wall. Using that elevator, he’d have to go to the common floor, and there he’d have to get on a separate elevator to reach the housing floors for the Avengers. This of which included Tony’s suite.
And just like that, the bastard was gone. I wasn’t even able to get a word in over my dumbfounded state.
Tony tried to grip Steve’s wrist tighter, but nothing happened. “I h-had to come,” He forced out through gritted teeth. He was holding on with everything he had left. “I had to-to make sure you were okay—”
“Captivating?” Tony questioned with an arched eyebrow. “Mostly I just get told to shut up if I ramble like that.” He subconsciously swiped his tongue across his lips where Steve’s own lips had been.
Steve found Tony talking with Rhodey a couple yards away. He cut in and thrusted the microphone to Tony with a playful glare.
Fury crossed his arms and leaned back in the chair opposite from Steve. There was a pitied look on Fury’s face that was definitely a change from the usual. “I’m gonna need you to start from the very beginning, Cap. Don’t leave anything out.” He eyes Steve with a stern expression, not wanting any bullshit.
They finished their breakfast with small chatter, both being more focused on eating the food that was in front of them. Tony paid, even with Steve’s refusal, then the two left to stroll around. They walked close to each other on the sidewalks of the city, their shoulders almost bumping together as they walked.
“Look at where being cocky got you,” Steve joked lightly to try to lighten the mood, though he frantically looked around for water and rag.
He tossed his hand wraps in the laundry before he grabbed a towel to pat himself down with as he took the elevator up to his floor. Steve pulled on his suit with ease before he met with Tony downstairs, who was leant against the car they were taking together.
But I don’t like him like that. I’m not going to risk getting caught staring when it was for nothing. There’s no way I like Steve Rogers.
Tony glanced around before he set his glass on the nearest object he could reach. “J, turn on incognito mode for the common floor.” The doors all chimed together as they locked, and from the outside the windows of the common floor darkened as they denied the outside world to see what was going on inside.
“I can’t find him. I can’t—God, how are you supposed to find a trickster who could be anyone? Or anything?” Steve sat down on one of the benches and put his head in his hands. “I’ve tried to get your help on this, and Thor’s, and anyone who can help. For the past month of Thursdays since we realized it was Loki. But I haven’t even truly came close,” Steve tugged at the ends of his hair. “And Loki knows so now he—” He laughs bitterly. “Now he’s
“I don’t doubt it,” Steve chuckled as he did the same and grabbed his toothbrush. Even though Steve didn’t technically live in the suite with Tony, he had a good bit of stuff over there since they spent most nights together in that suite.
“Just so I’m getting this right, you want me to stay away from some mysterious mission that you think is too dangerous for myself yet you’re going in on it alone?” Tony quirked a brow to his friend in front of him. “Yeah, okay.”
Steve put his hands in his pockets when inside Tony’s suite, thinking back to every Thursday they spent in here that Tony has no recollection of. He wasn’t as tense anymore now that he was away from Loki’s presence, and he was only in Tony’s presence.
“I’ve slept in worse ways,” I wave off with a small smile. “Caves and all. But I will gladly take the wheel again.”
Steve had his head tilted back over the top of the back of the chair. He felt delusional. He felt like this isn’t something any sane person would admit aloud, let alone be dealing with.
“It’s not like I haven’t paid for being cocky before,” Tony chuckled then winced as the substance started to sizzle deeper.
Steve laid his head back and closed his eyes, his arms secure around Tony. “Let’s just sleep here. I’m comfortable and don’t feel like moving.” A small smile broke across Steve’s face.
Tony had a curious glint in his eyes as he pulled into the parking lot. “Jarvis, pull up on Cap’s phone colored pictures of Captain America in the 1940’s.”
“As I was saying,” Steve pulled Tony closer to his chest. “I almost didn’t realize I was scooting closer to the edge until you came up. I had been avoiding you that particular Thursday to see if maybe that would do something – which of course it didn’t – and just seeing you snapped me out of it,” Steve brought a hand up to cup Tony’s cheek. “And then, uh…” Steve’s cheeks flushed darkly. “Then we…fondued?”
Tony pulled away first with a small look of surprise on his face. “Coming out here, I wasn’t expecting that to happen.”
?” Steve couldn’t help the laugh that came from his chest as he put the butter up. “You do realize that when not counting how long I’ve been frozen, I’m roughly 30-years-old, right?” He turned around to look at Tony with an arched eyebrow, taking a bite of his toast.
There was a pause, a moment of hesitation, before Steve finally rambled out, “We had this kind of, uhm, relationship that started up most Thursdays…”
“The good parts?” Steve kept his face in Tony’s neck, thinking as his hand rubbed Tony’s back gently. “Uhm, there was this one night that I was up on the ledge on the common floor. It was the first time in the loop that I felt like I may be able to…you know.”
Tony took a quick swig of the whiskey before he picked the phone back up, his hand tight around the small device.
When he got closer, Steve saw the way Tony was sitting to where he wasn’t hurting his back. With pursed lips, Steve made his way over to Tony.
There was a dull thud from something hitting the floor before Tony peeked his head out from around the corner. He had a sheepish smile on his face. “You have wonderful ideas, Capsicle. Luckily, I had the same idea,” He stated with a proud voice before the sheepish look returned on his face. “Though… I may or may not have overdone it on the bubbles by accidentally dropping the bottle in the tub?”
“This is going to be a long drive,” I breathe out as I start to follow the directions via Jarvis. “Are you ready for it, Cap?”
Maybe while Steve took this break from the loop, he could focus on trying to figure out how deep Tony’s feelings go for Steve. All he knew beforehand – from the previous Thursdays – was that Tony reciprocated Steve’s feelings. What he didn’t know was how deep they were for Tony and how long they had been kept hidden.
I shake my head with a small chuckle, using the card key to unlock the door and push it open with my back. “You don’t want to hear what I’ve done at work then.”
After a few laps around, he saw Sam up head of him for his own morning run. Steve couldn’t help the smug look he felt on his face before he composed himself. Once – for that fraction of a second – on Sam’s side, Steve called out, “On your left.”
Tony curled his robotic fingers into Steve’s shirt, trying to hold on a little longer. “Steve—” Tony called out faintly before his body went limp in Steve’s arms.
The car ride went normal, and of course Tony joked with him about the way Steve smelt from sweating. Though once they walked through the conference room doors, all joking was halted for the moment as they saw Fury was already in there and waiting.
let any other Avengers know about this. They will never let it go, and then they’ll be the ones to make it awkward.”
Steve chuckled as he pulled on some pajama pants. “I think it sounds good. And healthy. So, I’ll make some for us when I wake up tomorrow,” He replied then got in the bed.
I scoff at that. “I am an alpha male. Our waiter just needs to get his eyes checked,” I excuse as I slide my credit card on top of the check, putting it on the edge of the table so the waiter sees it.
It had been a quiet couple of weeks. I hadn’t been asked to do a mission in those weeks, and I was actually feeling anxious. It wasn’t that I was anxious about no threats, because there definitely was some. Fury just sent others to be on the missions.
Steve climbed up the building and jumped the roofs before he got on the one where the weapon dealers were. He looked around before he spotted the door that would normally lead to the roof, and he went through there.
Steve wondered if Loki was ever even truly taken away and simply let all the Avengers think he was taken so he could do this loop thing to Steve.
I give him a weird look before I step out the car as well. This place would definitely not be my first choice unless I was drunk at three in the morning. “I don’t even want to know what you look at on the internet then.”
“It wasn’t the worst speeches I’ve ever heard,” Rhodey commented with a side glance to Tony. “Trust me.”
“Tony!” Steve yelled out, because whatever was shot at Tony was eating through the suit’s metal. Without thinking, Steve threw his shield and split the weapon in two, rendering it useless. But there were still others.
He hated being confused. Especially when something felt so real, yet it wasn’t. Like when he woke up at S.H.I.E.L.D. in the 21st century feeling like yesterday was still the 1940’s.
"That's enough," the man with the sonic taser said mildly, ignoring Tony's wheezing. He was seemingly the one running their little operation. "Just grab him and we're out. Luis, call the car."
"No, Steve!" he interrupts. "Not all of us have the luxury to feel upset. I'm doing the best I can, and so should you. Stop trying to help, because you
Tony yells again, a little more frantic this time, even if he knows from experience that it's to no avail. Rick settles more fully to stand between Tony's kicking legs, and thrusts his hips when the kiss against his neck turns into a painful bite. Tony yelps and tries to twist away.
Steve is looking loads better, with colour returning to his cheeks and the bruises fading with his super soldier healing and the drugs in his system. When it's close to noon, the doctors decide that it's time to get him to wake up. The process itself can take from the matter of hours to days even, but all the doctors do is take him off the drugs, and instruct the rest of them to be patient. Easy for them to say, is what Tony thinks of it.
submit to me, my sweet omega." Rick's pupils were dilated and his breathing heavy, his alpha side taking over as he imagined god knows what he would do to Tony. What he
Slowly, Tony pulled himself into a sitting position, but that was the extent of his capabilities at the moment; his vision was tunneling and he didn't feel like he was in control of his limbs. He was breathing in rough, uneven gulps of air and he could feel the remains of his shirt clinging to his skin, either with blood or sweat.
Sam and Bruce nodded and got up. Sam walked out of the room, but Bruce didn't immediately leave after Steve had given his orders.
The hand didn't leave his skin; fingers were now trailing his spine up and down. "Oh," Ezekiel began, voice level, "in a hurry to somewhere?"
Tony shifted his gaze to his bound hands. He tested the bonds and held back a hiss when the cuffs chafed his raw skin. The zip tie wasn't going to break, and Tony doubted he would be able to slide it from under the bed leg without anyone noticing.
He didn't seem all that particular about it, but he was wearing leather gloves, and Tony doubted it was just for the sake of a fashion statement.
close to him. His front was pressed against the whole of Tony's back and he still held onto Tony's arms, preventing him from taking a swipe at anyone or moving them away. Tony ceased with his struggling to draw in a shuddering breath when Bates pressed himself even more tightly against him. His proximity was suffocating. "Otherwise he'll find a way out of them."
With that the spell is broken, and reality comes crashing back in. Steve turns his back to Tony and busies himself with repacking the first-aid kit. His movements are a little bit jerkier than a moment before.
of this planet, preferably off of this whole universe. To do that, he needed to know how Hammer had gotten access to them. "The sonic taser isn't supposed to even exist anymore, not even on paper. How could
"Shut it, Tony," his Father snapped at him, stumping his cigar. "The deal is done. All that was left was to inform you and now that's done too. You and Richard will be wed the year the two of you've finished your studies."
Ezekiel grabbed him by the back of his neck and bashed his face into the pole. Tony felt the skin above his right brow splitting open and blood begun trickling down his face.
It was just the two of them now plus Natasha, since Jim had told Peter and Nebula to stay in the Quinjet. It would be best if they could go over this part discreetly.
He leaned in closer as Tony still processed his words, all of his energy spent on that one confession. "You don't deserve love," Ezekiel continued. He pressed his fingers down on Tony's ribs and Tony groaned. "And yet, you so selfishly crave it." He paused, watching Tony. "Tell me now. You love him, don't you?"
"We're staying here for a few hours," Becker continued as he grabbed Tony by the ankles, pulling him in. Tony let him, and when he was by the edge of the seat, kicked his leg out with all the force he could muster behind it.
"You wouldn't have had the time. That kid is a damn lightning bolt when she sets her mind to it. And likes wrecking havoc, as well." Steve laughs.
Tony bit his lip. "For the greater good," he finally replied. Ezekiel looked taken aback by the reply for a second, then laughed in Tony's face.
"Fuck you, you pea-brained evolutionary throwback," Tony spat at him, twisting and struggling to make picking him up harder than it ought to be. "It's you who's gonna regret ever being born once I'm through with you tools!"
He groaned in objection, trying to force his muscles to cooperate. His fingers twitched around the metal of the gun, and his shoulder moved slightly, but that was about it. He heard Becker finally standing up, and dread filled his mind. He was in deep shit now.
"Marco," Becker slurred, but Marco was about as useful as Tony at the moment. Tony listened to Becker's scoff, and then he was being dragged over to the duffel bag by the wall.
"No," he says, because it's the truth. "And I don't want you to try. Trust me, if anyone knows all the loopholes in this contract, it's me, and I would be long divorced if it were possible." He breathes in a steadying breath. "But it's not. Not if I don't want to lose everything that I have. Including Rosie's custody."
He had been hung there for at least some hours and his arms had officially switched from numb to leaden at some point. It would be fine with him, since at least now he couldn't feel the throbbing of his abraded wrists, but it was getting tougher to move them around now that he had been there for some time already.
Tony watches them for a brief moment, calculating his chances of taking all three by himself. He decides that bidding his time would serve him best if his wish is to not get killed. "So you, what, run this place? Want to spill the beans on that, instead? About the people you've been keeping here?"
"I want to," Steve says, and are those tears in his eyes? "Believe me, Tony, I want to. So badly." He chuckles somewhat wetly and moves as if he's about to leave.
"I wonder if you could give me one more child, darling," Rick croons at him, and strokes the exposed small of his back. The pants are somewhere around Tony's ankles. "It's a little late, but I think you could do it if we tried hard enough."
He returns to the table to find the staff already dismissed, and most of the mess cleared from the table. Only the candles, the thinned out (thinned out by Rosie) bouquet, and the wine glasses are still around.
"I told you to look away," Beard said with a low, threatening tone, staring down at Tony. Tony met his gaze unblinkingly, too bullheaded to back off now. He could almost hear Rhodey and Steve calling him an idiot for it, screaming at him to cut it out. Well, whatever, Tony knew they took provocation even worse than him, so they could go fly a kite for all he cared.
But that was Hammer's play, after all. Unlike Ezekiel who would abuse and intimidate him, Hammer would coax and bribe him. Like a twisted good cop, bad cop routine. And Tony refused to give into it.
"Right. I just wished to cheer the man up with something from his own century. Is that forbidden, now?"
Tony struggled to remember. The room was swirling, making him nauseous, and he had to close his eyes against it. "L-Last night."
"Just some harmless tests," the alpha replies lightly, taking a step forward. Tony stands his ground, even while he wants to take a step back. "You know that sometimes we need to make sacrifices to further our knowledge. You
Tony has the time to let his eyes go wide before Rick is all but ripping his shirt off of his shoulders, mouthing at the tense muscle there, and pushing Tony between his hard body and the dining table. Tony's wine glass topples over the edge of the table and explodes in a spray of shards by their shoe-clad feet.
The door by his feet popped open. He was reclined on the backseat of the car. "Time to wake up, sleeping beauty," the man at the door sneered at him. Tony finally recognized him — Becker.
EDIT: i just came back from reading all the comments from the last chapter — thank you so, so much, every single one of them was lovely!!! i'm sorry i haven't gotten around to answering them, however i still wanted to thank you guys. they are a nice motivation booster :) write you soon!
Then, she had led him to the back door and alarm bells had already gone off in Tony's head. He took another look at the waitress; she was visibly scared and her posture seemed to scream guilt.
At two o'clock, Hammer seemed bored and somewhat frustrated, and Tony was drooping in his bonds with exhaustion. Hammer was speaking again, gesturing for Bates to haul Tony back to the basement, when he suddenly stopped. Tony's focus sharpened at that and he listened; the distant sound of car tires on gravel could be heard through the poorly insulated windows.
"Have you cleaned it up?" he asks. Tony makes a noncommittal sound, and Steve sighs again, this time disapprovingly. "Sit down," he orders, but his tone is soft, so Tony complies. The alpha digs around one of the kitchen cabinets, and pulls out a small first-aid kit.
As Tony had become more and more invested in the Avengers Initiative (not a full Avenger, but all the same a team member), Rick's stance had grown even more against Tony taking any part in it.
It had almost gone all the way to court when Rick hadn't been willing to comply, but when Nick Fury had intervened, directly contacting the other alpha, he had suddenly made a complete turnabout. Tony wasn't sure what the director of SHIELD had told his company's CEO, but it couldn't have been anything good, deducing from his reaction to it. Or, alternatively, it had been something
One of Steve's arms winds around his back, the other cups his neck, holding him still. They kiss long and good, making it heated and languid at the same time. By the end of it, Tony is wet and he can tell that Steve smells it on him.
Ezekiel let out a sudden, choked off sound like he was holding back a sob. "Her wounds from the crash were not fatal, but she passed away within the week. You know why?"
s. He was panting from the struggling and his injuries were aching anew, but his eyes were unable to look away from the leather cuffs.
"Hand me that taser then," Becker said. Tony tried to twist away from beneath him, but Becker pushed him flat against the floor with no effort whatsoever.
Tony wanted to bang his head against something hard. It was going to be a long day, zip tied to a foot of a bed with two kidnappers playing with their phones.
Hammer kept on smiling. "That's right. But oh, my." He laughed again, this time at Tony's appearance rather than his manners. "What happened to your clothes? I'm used to seeing you clad in outfits that are more....well,
"Let me ask you another question, this one not rhetorical," Ezekiel interrupted him. Tony noticed that he had abandoned the baton, letting it fall down to the floor, but at this point it didn't seem to make much of a difference — Tony's body was racked with pain, high-strung with fear and misery. Ezekiel didn't need the baton anymore — he had Tony right where he wanted him.
Ezekiel's footsteps returned and Tony's breath caught in his throat as he felt the crop striking his bruised back again. He gasped and leaned forward, upper body folding over his thighs.
Bates grabbed a hold of his jaw in a manner that was fast becoming familiar to Tony; it seemed that face grabbing was a favored move among baddies who had it out for him.
Tony huffs out a laugh and watches as the blonde pours antiseptic on one of the pads. He moves to stand before the engineer. "Is it going to sting?" Tony asks playfully.
"You're saying you would let him kill me?" Tony shot back, seeing through Hammer's bluff, "You would sacrifice your
"Of course," Omega Dunn replies in a tone that implies he has no intention of calling Tony 'Tony'. "How are you?"
They split up, Barton and Rose taking off to find them a table, and Tony and Rogers walking to the line leading to the cashier, so that they can give their orders. Tony is paying, although he'd almost lost it when on their way to the shop Rogers had been insisting he'd do the paying. The omega was grateful for the captain's consideration, and tried to remember that the soldier came from a different era — one where it would've been outrageous to let an omega pay for themselves — but when the alpha still wasn't willing to understand where Tony was coming from — that he didn't need an alpha to take care of him, especially when it came to money, thank you very much — he'd begun all out arguing with Rogers. That was when Rogers seemed to get that Tony wasn't going to budge, and that this was a matter that would best be left to be, thus he'd relented, even apologizing to the omega. It was obvious that Rogers wanted to keep their budding friendship intact, even if it meant not being able to follow through with all of his principles. Tony'd calmed down with a huff, and Barton had just rolled his eyes at them, guiding Rose along with a hand on her small shoulder.
And clearly, his stress levels were the wrong thing to think about, since Rose lets out a pathetic wail at the change in her daddy's scent.
Chapter 3 continues from around where chapter 2 left off, and we are currently living year 2013. It's post-Iron Man 3 and post-Captain America 2, but pre-Thor 2!)
Truly, damn every Disney movie for getting Rose so fixated on princesses and flowers and glamour. It was only a couple months back when it was still cars and planes, and now it was
"Daddy's going to work for a while, okay baby?" Rosie nods at him absently, still completely engrossed with the cartoon, so Tony takes the chance to round the couch to get away from the kid's line of vision. "Can you keep an eye on her for me for a while?" he asks Steve. "She can finish watching that cartoon, but don't let her spend the whole morning watching TV. If you get busy then just bring her down to me and I'll figure something out for her to do while I work."
Well, if nothing else, Tony thinks they are doing a phenomenal job at keeping their affair (if one could even call it that) a secret. Lingering touches and looks, a quick scenting when it was possible. No kisses. Barely any hugging. No witnesses.
Bruce frowns at him. "Or, a nap perhaps? We've been at this for hours, and frankly, given that this isn't my field and you're running on fumes, I'm not sure how much we're accomplishing here."
At the moment, Luis and his pal — Speech Impediment, as Tony had named him since the guy seemed to be slurring his words constantly — were quietly conversing by themselves next to the back doors. Back Pain was holding the LED with a grave impression plastered on his face, as if it was some serious job he had been granted by the angels themselves. Beard was eyeing him like he was a piece of meat that had personally offended him, eyes hard and his mouth a thin line. It gave Tony the creeps, and he couldn't help stubbornly eyeing the other man back.
Next, he grabbed the blue rope and unwound it, ignoring Tony pulling on his cuffs and twisting his wrists futilely to reach the carabiner — it was no use, his fingers didn't even brush against it.
Sorry this chapter is a little shorter than usual, but I just thought that that was a good ending for now, right? I'll make it normal length next time I promise lol
When the clock ticks a little over seven, they make their way down to the common floor, Rose sleepily clinging to Tony's neck. She's not really a morning person, very much like her Daddy.
Rogers makes them spaghetti carbonara and ends up finishing the panful together with Tony and Rose. He insist that he'll help Rose with the pasta, so that Tony can eat, because Tony hasn't eaten anything since last night, and
While he was grateful for the distraction, there was a part of Steve that wanted to scream that he didn't know. A part that wanted to grab his comfortable chair and throw it against the wall. Throw himself against the wall for being an idiot and not talking his issues through with Tony before this happened.
"Stay still, or I'll do that again," Marco finally threatened. Tony had been waiting for it. People couldn't help threatening him. "I'd rather you stay conscious for now, but I'll admit you're much easier to handle when you're out cold."
In a grappling match she could easily overpower him and both of them know that, if the look plastered on the woman's face is anything to go by. What she doesn't know however, is that Tony will not hesitate to fight dirty. And if someone asks, it's for the sake of balancing the scales, so to speak.
hours?" Tony asks, fingers twisting into his bed covers. He needs to pace, but he's afraid that if he stands up he's going to leave the apartment to get to the medical facility, and he needs to finish this call and tend to Rosie before he can do that. "And why was I informed just now?"
I tell you to do on the dot, or there will be consequences. You will attend some omega classes at your school, although I'll make sure that they won't put shame to the Stark name by training you into becoming some pampered ditz. I
"I'm here to see our dear Captain, of course," the brown-haired alpha replies, walking over and bending down to peck Tony on the cheek. He's clad in one of his work attires, a stylish dark grey suit that matches the streaks of grey hair on his temples.
Tony leaned against the backrest, attempting to keep both men in his sights as he glared at them. Marco sighed at him while Becker glared back.
"Spider-Man?" Steve asked once he placed the voice and the reddish gleam of the suit he could just make out in the dark.
Ezekiel just tilted his head at him, studying him with a somewhat smug air to him. And that's when Tony realized that he didn't really have a choice here. If he wanted to survive, that is. He mentally calculated the probability of him making it one mile away from the house without food and water, given that he even managed out the front door. Next, he considered the prolonged beating that would undoubtedly commence did he not comply. Simply put, the odds weren't in his favor.
The engineer pulls out the box of sandwiches he and Rogers had prepared for lunch from his bag. He hands Rose one and then passes the box over to Barton on his other side.
[see clause four (4)]. If a descendant is not born before ANTHONY STARK turns the age of forty (40), the ownership of
Hammer raised his eyebrows at him. "You're referring to me getting kicked out of my own company, aren't you?"
but he's still asking and making sure that Tony's comfortable and Tony has never been taken care like this before--
Steve sighs and reaches with his hand towards Tony. He pauses midmotion, hesitating, but decides to just go for it. He reaches to touch Tony's injured cheek, and gently twists Tony's chin so that he can see it better.
"You don't even believe that yourself, Stark," he said once his laughter died out. "But don't worry. I know the answer."
Steve's expression hardens. "I don't understand it, Tony!" he yells, frustration making his movements less graceful than usually. "I don't understand how you can just
And yes, it would be much more bearable, but Tony wouldn't be able to live with himself were he to give Hammer what he wanted. So he said nothing.
He presses another kiss to her head, feeling Rosie slowly turn into an impressive imitation of a soggy noodle in his arms, and nods towards the preschool teacher who's making his way towards them.
but obviously not often enough that Rosie thought it was habitual. But now that he thought of it, he did often end up only cooking for the toddler and then himself just focusing on getting the girl to actually eat it. Sometimes there was just too much everything else interesting to keep her focus on finishing her plate without outside intervention.
Perhaps Tony had underestimated Ezekiel's fury, since it seemed that the man was as livid as ever after a few unadvised words from Tony.
Occasionally, he would doze off from exhaustion, which made it hard to keep track of time. However, it was now very dark outside, and Tony was pretty sure they were over the midnight mark.
Actually, it's the exact opposite. He sighs as the tension leaves his shoulders and leans more fully into the warm hand at his neck, blatantly displaying his trust and submission to someone other than Rick, his actual alpha. And he doesn't even feel bad about it, since nowadays despite the mating bond, Steve feels like his alpha, too. Maybe it's the pack mentality speaking, with what the Avengers beginning to grow more and more close, or maybe it's something else, who knows. He doesn't really give a damn anymore. Not since he almost lost Steve. As long as he doesn't get caught submitting to Steve, everything should be fine. Right?
He let out an explosive sigh of relief when they moved aside another plastic curtain and found an operating table, blessedly devoid of any dead, brown-haired billionaires.
He watched himself in the mirror as he worked; he saw a multitude of hand-shaped marks on his arms, cuts and bruises on his hands and face and his jaw was swollen on one side. Beneath the leather cuffs that still encased his wrists snugly, he could feel raw skin. Puncture wounds littered his chest, accompanied by the red flush of irritated skin where Ezekiel had electrocuted him.
Marco let out a choked sound, but remained standing as he reciprocated, punching Tony in the shoulder. Tony grunted and kneed him in the stomach, the hand holding the other man's wrist squeezing and twisting. Marco went down, falling on his front, guided by the hand Tony still had on him.
"One question at a time, Rosie," Tony says, walking up to stand by Steve's cot, brushing a hand over the toddler's head.
"You really don't listen, do you?" Ezekiel asked. He trailed the tip of the baton across Tony's chest, bringing it up below Tony's chin. He used it to tilt the engineer's head up. Tony reluctantly met his gaze. "How frustrating must that be for Captain Rogers, I can't even begin to imagine. No wonder he hates you so."
"Hello to you, too," Rick says as he reaches the couch Tony's sitting on, in his usual spot by the armrest, and bends down to kiss his cheek, right over the cut there. Tony hums and takes another sip from his scotch. "Ready for family dinner?" Rick continues.
Getting your first heat at sixteen is considered late, as the usual ages for that are between thirteen and fifteen, so even now Tony seems to be the late bloomer that his Mother once had called him. He also suspects that the heavy suppressants (courtesy of his Father) he's been on ever since one month after he'd presented have something to do with that.
Anyway, the heat comes and goes, signaling that his reproductive organs are finally fully developed. He gets a new packet of suppressants, ones that will also block his heats as well as dampen his scent and submissive urges. Not that Tony'd ever really displayed that much of submissive behavior, but maybe his Father just wants to be extra sure. Especially since he never managed to turn his omega son into an alpha, not with the drugs or behavioral camps he'd pushed him into, so now he just has to make sure that he doesn't exhibit any signs of his omegahood. God forbid.
Steve didn't have time to say anything before Natasha had bashed the doctor's face right into the metal desk in front of her.
Steve gives his neck another squeeze. A swipe of a thumb near his ear. Tony shudders, gasping softly.
"I don't know," Dina said, "I believe he's going to ask you to explain it to him at some point. That is, if he doesn't manage to reverse engineer it before that."
"That's the plan, darling," he says easily, powering up the repulsors. The HYDRA agents are just behind the corner now.
So, the fight finished and the site cleaned up, they separate in good terms, Rogers even going as far as shaking Tony's hand despite his omega status. Tony feels like his eyes are about to fall out of his head, with how wide they are. After that, Tony takes off with his new beta friend, Doctor Bruce Banner AKA the Hulk, in order to show off the Stark Tower to him. He has high hopes that he'd get to house the Avengers in the tower, renaming it the Avengers Tower when he did, but that's still somewhere in the future.
"Ezekiel, did you bring Tony wi—" Hammer's sentence was cut off when he burst into roaring laughter. Tony felt his flush deepening. "Oh, oh my—"
"Good thing you're awake, anyhow," she said, breaking Tony's train of thought, "This will go quicker if I have your help."
"That's better, isn't it," he said, as if making conversation. He reached out and touched Tony's face, ignoring Tony's attempt at pulling away. He held him by his jaw and made Tony meet his gaze. "You're much more bearable like this. When you're quiet, I mean."
Thank you again for sticking with me and these fics. I really love writing and it's super to hear you guys like reading what I've got to offer. Have a great day ❤️
“Hey, Tony.” Steve briefly brushed his lips over Tony’s cheek, and then headed for the elevator. Tony didn’t take offense to the cursory greeting, and followed close behind him. “Jarvis, Business level please.”
Tony set down his tools and wiped his hands on a nearby already dirty rag, taking longer than he needed to. “I’ll have Jarvis draw up some of the must sees for your Motorcycle Diaries then.”
“Oh, I am not dealing with this. You get to handle the backlash. I’m sending all negative press and any request for comments your way.” Pepper declared, and then turned her sharp glower to Steve. “And yours.”
Tony slumped forward against Steve’s heaving chest. The room seemed silent now with only their gasps filling the space.
It got to the point that Tony looked forward to the sound of it rolling off Steve’s tongue, of the moniker being attached to him from Steve.
Before Steve could rightfully accuse Tony of being a tease, he wrapped his lips around the head and suckled lightly. He kept at it until Steve’s hand came to rest on his head, and he finally descended down his shaft until his nose was buried in Steve’s golden pubic hair.
By the time he’d returned Steve was sitting in bed and Tony's eyes erupted with hearts. As much as Tony loved Steve’s skin tight shirts, he also adored seeing him like this. The shirt was thin with use and a little too big, and the plaid pajama pants were the kind of soft you could see.
At first Tony kept pace, unaware that Steve had given him free reign. It wasn’t until Steve’s fingers trailed back down, raising goosebumps on his heated flesh, that he realized he was free to set the pace again. He’s too desperate to retaliate for the game Steve had played. His hips slammed down, and he surged forward, smashing their lips together.
It only took him seconds to find a jar of Vaseline. He quickly applied the lube substitute to his fingers, and pressed two to Tony’s opening.
Every time Steve called him doll warmth pooled in his chest, and he didn’t feel a smidgen of embarrassment or distaste. The fact that Steve used it sparingly helped it to not lose its potency.
“Well, Captain. You certainly have been good for Tony’s punctuality.” She announced on their approach with a smirk. “He never- Oh my god!” Her eyes widened, and then narrowed as she yanked Tony forward for inspection.
The face cover slid up to reveal Tony smirking at him. “Cool down, boy scout. There’s no galactic threat or laser shooting diabolical bunnies.”
I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that going forward there is going to be some heavy angst in some of these. So, please read and heed the tags in the beginning notes!
The head of Steve’s cock pressed wet against him and Tony exhaled shakily. “Come on, then Captain. Fucking do it!”
Finally, he had Steve shirtless, and he catapulted himself forward. His mouth latched onto Steve’s shoulder before descending down to his chest to flick his tongue against one of Steve’s nipples. Steve’s breath hitched,  and Tony wrapped his lips around it to suck on it harshly.
Laughing, “it wasn’t a contest. But I’ll take it.” Steve was silent as he looked through a few. “You mind if I read some of them? They’re nice for me to look back on too.”
Tony didn’t get to finish his sentence. The dog bounded towards Steve and then jumped up on him. His paws came to rest on Steve’s shoulders and the dog barked once, the sound deep and excited.
Originally, he had been looking at puppies from a local breeder. But after a talk with Sam, he quickly changed gears. Adopting a dog from a rescue was the only option.
As his brain starts to catch up to what’s happening Tony tries to press his hands against the abdominal wound, stopped by Steve’s larger hands holding his own. There was blood all over Steve’s hands, all over him. Just before Tony is about to ask if Steve’s hurt he realizes it’s his own.
One of Steve’s hands grabbed the back of Tony’s neck, giving it a squeeze of warning, and Tony leered up at him. The more comfortable Steve got with things like this, the more confident he got exploring different facets of his sexuality. Sure, he liked his share of rough sex, but this was different. It was kink and taboo. And amazing.
And then he halted. Tony had kissed him, and Steve had returned it. Tony was in a relationship. Steve was team leader. The words that had kept the brakes on for him flashed in his head. DISRESPECTFUL. INAPPROPRIATE. ADVANTAGEOUS. UNFAIR. WRONG.
“Well, then has Thor discovered antique shops? Because these,” Tony motioned to the bar stools lined up against the island, “seat covers have to be from the 50’s, and not in a wow what a cool vintage find way.”
Perspiration trickled down the nape of his neck, his pale skin flushed with exertion. The grey shirt he wore strained to keep it’s fibers together over broad shoulders and greek god musculature. The fabric was soaked with sweat, and clung so that even through the cloth his six pack was absurdly defined. For the first time, but what wouldn’t be the last, Tony wondered if Steve wore undersized shirts on purpose.
Steve knew, now, that he should’ve tempered those fantasies, taken the time to imagine a world where Tony found him disgusting, once he knew the truth, but he hadn’t. He’d let himself hope, and he’d had his teeth kicked in.
as tight as Steve’s), and a sharp sport coat, open, over a printed t-shirt that had a picture of Steve’s shield on it (what).
There’s no warning, no precursor. Just, one day in his inbox, a very formal and clear “stop what you’re doing” from Stark Industries’ legal department.
“I’m so sorry,” Steve sighed, reaching down to meet her as she returned. She looked up at him, big eyes full of disappointment and betrayal, but tail half-wagging with hope. Hot shame dribbled down his spine, and he rubbed Penny’s ears in apology. “That was a gift, and it was very kind of you--Penny clearly loved it--and I ruined it. I really did think the wind would slow it down more, it was so light--”
was her real dad. But then avoiding Steve had left a huge hole in his social calendar, and the first thing he’d realized, with quite a bit of chagrin, was that he’d been hoarding Steve in exactly the same way he feared he’d steal the dog.
“I’m here for movie night, nobody tells me anything,” Rhodey complained, wide-eyed and absently scratching Clint’s ears. “Why is this one wet?”
The punch whiffed. Tony opened his eyes and blinked at the empty sidewalk where his wisecracking supersoldier had been half an instant ago. Screeching tires drew his eyes to the street beyond, just in time to see the familiar shape of his missing person rolling up out of a crouch--out from in front of one car and directly into the path of another. Before Tony could even shout a warning, Steve had leapt up and
He was lying at the end of a shallow, familiar-shaped furrow, the kind that immediately read to him these days as “whoops, undignified landing” but not the kind that read “shit I almost died, fill that in before Steve sees”. So that was something. But the sounds of battle were notably absent, and, unless he was much mistaken, the sun was perceptibly lower in the sky than it had been.
“Oh. Good,” Tony cleared his throat and stood up a little straighter. He was suddenly looking anywhere but at Steve, and didn’t seem to know what to do with his hands.
Relaxed as he was, Steve found himself people-watching more than he would usually dare. And why shouldn’t he? There was a lot to learn about the average Joe here and now, and it helped him to observe how ordinary people behaved in public. Secondhand information from his team only went so far, and might not always be universal. Like, for example, when Tony had mentioned that men didn’t tend to engage in as much casual touching with their male friends as they had in Steve’s day, yet here in the park today, Steve had seen no fewer than four different small groups of young people in which two or more men had been sitting or standing close enough to touch.
Steve stood at the entry to the kitchen, beaming. “I haven’t cooked a hot meal in a real kitchen since 1943.”
With Thor, Tony hadn’t quite known where to start, but they’d somehow found their way to an arcade, a go-kart track, and eventually, an ice-cream parlor that served old-fashioned hard ice cream in scoops the size of volleyballs. One of the more harrowing days Tony’d lived through without the suit in recent years, but worth it.
“I’d ask if you can keep a secret, but I know I don’t have to,” the young (young?) man said softly, eyes on his tea. “I know I overstepped, getting the blanket without asking, but I couldn’t have asked without explaining, and, well, I was really hoping Tony would be the first one to find out.”
Tony had to bite his lip. Steve was mostly white all over, but the orange on top of his head...well, it was a cowl, basically.
Tony squinted at him, incredulous, and peered at him sideways. He pointed a finger at Steve’s chest. Steve’s jaw dropped.
, didn’t it. Out of everyone he’d met in this new life, it just had to be the devastatingly handsome genius, with the roguish smile and the sparkling eyes; the one person who always seemed to know what movie Steve would like, what kind of food he should try, what sort of clothes he should wear to feel like he fit in without feeling like he was dressed in a Normal Human costume.
Clint had been first out of sheer proximity, but now Tony had his choice, and to the surprise of nobody ever, he made a beeline to the pile of red, white, and blue.
“You asshole,” Clint said with a fond grin. He collected his duffle from the floor in the entryway and slung it over his shoulder. “Take care of yourself, I’ll see you Tuesday!”
“Then you wanted to tell everyone. Which, I assume, was because the feedback had been good and you decided to you were comfortable letting the public know that you really do know how to have fun, that you have a sense of humor--about yourself, especially. Here’s the thing though, babe:
Steve laughed, and the conversation devolved into a list of increasingly improbable chores and reprimands Tony would have to suffer to atone for being anything less than ecstatic to properly meet Steve. Although Jarvis did allow that asking Iron Man to wash the outside windows on the upper stories might not be an idea entirely without merit (the apron reading “I have to be nice if I want nice things” would not likely be necessary in real life). It was all utterly silly, and went on for nearly an hour, interspersed with a good deal of reminiscing about things that were common when Steve was last awake and when Jarvis was a boy. Eventually, Steve cocked an ear toward the front of the mansion.
Clint (a tiny, stout, round little thing with even-toned grey fur all over) was happy to weave around Tony's legs but adamantly refused to be picked up. After a few unsuccessful tries, Tony resorted to fishing an arrow out of the quiver--one of the trick ones that would release a net when fired, not a pointy one--and trailing the end across the stones to lure him along. Thankfully, Clint’s arrow obsession seemed to be strong enough even in this form that he hopped along faithfully after it all the way back to the quinjet, over a hundred yards away. Tony took more satisfaction in locking him into a storage compartment than was probably healthy.
“Kitty kitty,” he whispers, almost conspiratorially, holding his hand out toward Tony, catching the morning light on the plates of his fingers and throwing arcs of reflected sunlight all over the kitchen. The glitter is very distracting, actually; Tony feels his ears swivel, the reflexes that come with this body want to catch all those sparkles in his claws and find out what they are later, after he’s got them, and he has to wrestle his own attention back to the relevant question. Steve is watching him too, now He’s smiling again, Tony even catches a flicker of his fond amusement through the bond, but this is
Tony shakes himself and settles in. Right. Steve probably doesn’t want cat-spit on his hands while he’s trying to eat breakfast. That makes sense. And he needs both hands, obviously, one for the cereal and one for his phone, which he’s just turned back on and is now slowly scrolling through. Tony hooks his paws over the edge of the table and adjusts himself until he can focus on the screen without being in the way of Steve’s arm.
A little more morose wandering brought him to the common library, a room he’d originally had installed because of the way Pepper used to talk about the library scene in
“Did you mean that?” Tony asked softly. His expression was carefully guarded now, but Steve wasn’t about to forget the way his eyes had gone wide and hopeful just moments ago.
The next day, Tony is back in the office (cranky, sporting a black eye and with his right arm in a sling, but he’s got work to do and he’s
The cat makes a strangled noise, almost like it’s about to cough up a hairball. Steve peers back at it again, but it must look fine, judging by his lack of panic.
“What…?” Tony tries, but Steve shushes him and puts the phone back in front of his face. He shifts their stance, anticipating the end of the clip, so that as the tablet flies across the screen, the two of them are facing across the living room toward the trash can it will land in. Steve pulls the phone away again, and, finally, Tony stiffens in his grip.
. Tony had to bundle him up in Steve’s jacket to get a safe grip on him, and still lost more than a few drops of blood in the process. Solitary confinement for that one.
Steve stared at him blankly for about three floors, before the image of a small glass bottle with that brand name on the front floated to the top of his recent memory.
nerve-wracking. The cardboard castle had been a good refuge from all that--while it was, admittedly, a bit of a death trap, at least he hadn’t felt so incredibly small when curled up in those little compartments. Bucky was right to take it down, though. It was kind of definitely a death trap.
talks about my husband like that,” Steve reminded him, voice shuddering around barely-contained emotion. “Never.”
hu·bris /ˈ(h)yo͞obrəs/ (noun): The act of establishing a weekly publishing schedule for a fic you have not yet finished writing.
“Have fun!” Steve called after him. Once the elevator doors closed, he let all the air out of his lungs in one huge sigh and allowed himself to slump back against the kitchen island.
“It means most of the dudes who live here are into dudes, and the girls like the girls. More or less,” Clint’s posture was still guarded, ready to bolt, apparently not at all reassured by Steve’s reaction.
What he gets in return is an avalanche of legalese to the effect of “don’t tell us what to do, we represent clients and we represent them saying to knock it off”. Steve insists that when he hears it from Steve, he will, and they insist he doesn’t get to make demands.
“We don’t get the luxury of shrugging things off because they’re ‘impossible’ around here,” Steve went on with a smile. “You saw something impossible, took it in stride, and did everything you could to help your friends. That’s not stupid,” Steve leaned forward and planted a soft kiss on Tony’s forehead. “That’s my Tony.”
“I am. Do you need that?” Tony waved a hand at the messenger bag full of dog stuff, which Steve had left on the sofa during his pacing.
“We called the listed number for this kid here, and got no answer, and the normal advice of the nice people at the desk is to keep trying for a few days, but I’m me and I have JARVIS and,” Tony stared at the dog, not Steve, making another face that Steve couldn’t decipher. He was either angry or upset. Maybe both. “I can run backwards from a phone number in ways that other people can’t. I can take that and dig down and get to street addresses and compare them to maps of the destruction, get names and Facebook profiles and memorial posts--”
sealed, fully bonded, their hearts and minds pouring into each other the way they had always been meant to. No more catching and throwing random feelings: he should have been able to look into Steve’s eyes and project the knowledge of who he was and what had happened straight into Steve’s brain, and would have followed that right up with directions to Strange’s office. He could’ve been back on his own two feet four and a half days ago, and spent that time getting to know Steve properly.
“No,” he said, stonefaced in spite of the burning feeling in his ears. “In fact I’m considering suing them for emotional damages.”
The joke, at its core, is that Steve is an old man who doesn’t understand all these new-fangled gadgets the kids use these days.
The dog had...thrown Tony off his game a little. He wouldn’t call the dog thing a mistake, or even really a problem, but her presence had made him step back, and from that distance he’d seen more clearly.
“Sounds like the team is home, unless you know someone else who’s twenty feet tall and has a friend that flies around on jet boots,” he observed, smiling.
Steve remained skeptical of Clint’s assessment, but allowed himself to be drawn out of his worry about the dog for a movie, a beer, and a chat while she continued to snooze. It felt good to have a friend around, and he was struck with a pang of guilt at having not spent any time with the team since Penny had arrived. In fact, he really hadn’t spent anything like an appropriate, proportionate amount of time with most of his new teammates even before that. It had just seemed to happen that he’d spent most of his time with Tony, which had been great, but it was definitely past time to reach out to the others as well.
“Hey,” Steve waited for Tony to look at him, brows furrowed sternly, but his tone didn’t carry the sort of dressing-down Tony was used to getting for his fuckups. “I’ll thank you not to say things like that about my teammate, Stark.”
Steve swallowed heavily, scrubbing the heel of his hand over his eyes to keep them from misting up again. “That sounds wonderful.”
Forcing opportunities for personal bonding into existence had never been his forté (see: One Friend Until Age 23) but God and Penny had handed him a bridge to Clint, and he intended to cross it. Clint himself was probably the bridge to Natasha, anyway, and that was halfway to everybody.
Jimmy leans back, palms flat on his desk, squinting suspiciously at Steve and glancing at the cameras. His body language goes wary, he fidgets with his mug and adjusts his tie as he starts to explain about ALLCAP, the channel that lampoons Cap’s journey through the future via surprisingly believable impressions and has never once broken character, and Steve is trying so hard not to laugh he can’t breathe, can’t even think about breathing. It’s all Steve can do to let him finish the description before he squeaks out “That’s my channel!”
Couple of new tags to mind! Not an especially severe case, but Tony did have one of those childhoods here, so heads up.
Oh good, just what Tony had hoped he wasn’t reading: more articles about Tony being missing. Tony hates those. They make Steve get that little wrinkle on his forehead, and it stays for hours, no matter how cute Tony is being, right here in the room. By now Tony’s pretty sure that neither of the human-shaped occupants of this house are going to put two and two together no matter how loud he meows, so he’d rather Steve just didn’t read them.
Steve nods, accepting. They share a quiet moment while Bucky tries to send back a general sense of calm and reassurance to his person, but it doesn’t echo, so he’ll probably never know if they caught any. Well, he tried. It’s not like he can do much more than worry, until he’s met them, even if they’re having strong enough shitty feelings that the bond wants to share them with Bucky every few hours.
A week later, on the red carpet outside of a charity event, a reporter is asking them a few unimportant, humanizing questions, and when Steve mentions his morning runs, she teasingly inquires whether he ever uses a workout tracker or pedometer to keep a record of how far he goes. Steve deadpans that he had a FitBit once, but it couldn’t keep up with him.
? Holy shit, I’m terrible, I’m the worst boyfriend, you shouldn’t have to resort to such desperate measures,” Tony lamented with a self-deprecating chuckle.
outside of his armor, thankyouverymuch, he’d be fine if there were stragglers, but climbing out of his main weapon in the middle of a live battlefield always made him a bit edgy.
Just when he was sure he knew what was happening in his life, he’d turn around and discover he’d accidentally adopted five tourist-tamed feral cats from the middle of nowhere, France.
The thing was, even with all he’d done for Tony’s odd friends so far, this was, still, a very unusual load of laundry. A
Fallon takes a moment to collect himself. “Thank you, so much, for that mental image,” he giggles slightly, “Anyway, I imagine there was a lot to get used to, a lot to learn, when you first woke up.”
It’d been a few weeks since hellfire and space whales had rained out of the sky over Manhattan, and he and Cap had said plenty of sheepish and sincere things to cancel out the rash and heated things they’d said on day one, and then some silly and snarky things, a few thoughtful things--one or two distressingly honest things, in Tony’s opinion--and all these things had come with a side order of street food and/or streaming TV and Tony couldn’t be sure exactly where this all was going but it had seemed to be going well.
Steve knows what a viral video is. He’s familiar with the concept. He’s seen most of the classics, in fact. He can tell you with confidence the difference between the Charlie who bites fingers and the Charlie who is skeptical of magical leopluradons. Steve
After a sufficient interval of sandwich-eating to gather up his nerve, Tony dared to look at Steve again. The big handsome goof had a smear of mustard halfway across his cheek. Tony stifled a laugh, and reached over to wipe it away with his thumb.
“This is literally the first time I’ve ever seen you interact with Penny in any way, and she’s been here for half a month.”
The panoramic views were one of the tower’s best features, after all. Nearly every room had one. Tony was used to seeing his city laid out at his feet. Every day. From one floor higher, even.
“And that one’s Garbage, we don’t talk to him,” Tony groused, stretching out an arm to try to block the grey tabby from jumping onto the sofa with them. “Go away, Garbage.”
Vision floated out of a wall, looking apprehensive, and gave Steve an uncomfortably gentle pat on the bum. “I’m so sorry. Team bonding, I suppose?” was the only explanation the android offered before sinking awkwardly through the floor. Wanda was considerably more ruthless, striding up from behind and catching him with a forward-swing on the right and a backhand to the left while he was still contemplating the linoleum where Vision had disappeared. At Steve’s aggrieved look, she merely laughed and threw an arm over his shoulder, leading him off toward the brewing festivities.
“Oh, absolutely,” Steve assures him at once. “I’m a big fan of the You Tubes,” he goes on, deliberately pronouncing it as two words and trying desperately not to fidget with anticipation. Fallon starts to say something else, but Steve can’t help himself. “I have my own channel, in fact.”
He was paralyzed, though, by confusion, at the fact that Tony appeared to have been doing his sobbing
Tony feels so utterly vulnerable, like this, but he can’t help but go limp and relaxed, overcome with a trust that’s been hard-coded in his soul since before he was born. Steve has him. He’s got Tony’s entire chest cradled in the palm of his hand, and it’s warm and solid and strong and Tony’s body wants to panic while his heart knows that he’s never been safer in his life.
The internet decides it must be Sergio Esposito, a particularly good cosplayer who’s won a number of Tony Stark look-alike contests in recent years. Sergio’s denial of his role in the video is met with just as much belief as Steve’s assertions that it’s just Tony.
This morning, he’s dressed professionally: slacks and a white button-down shirt with some sort of logo on the breast that Tony can’t read from here. His left sleeve is rolled up past the elbow, exposing a very obvious, very shiny, very artificial forearm.
Feeling affronted and personally wounded by this grave insult, Tony set off in a post-chocolate huff. Unfortunately, he was too caught up in his own internal monologue of nearly-incoherent grumbling to pay any attention to where his feet were carrying him.
High above, an enormous face looms into view past the edge of the table like the sun coming out of an eclipse. Steve stares down at him, blandly observant, still chewing a mouthful of cereal. Tony shakes off the distraction and bunches to spring again. He can’t help one more glance at Steve, though, and Steve's pointedly raised eyebrow breaks his conviction. All the tension drains out of his posture and he settles into a loaf on the cold floor.
. Whereas Tony, for his part, had so far reacted only with a series of distressed faces and strangled noises that were beyond Steve’s ability to read. He seemed to care what happened to the dog, at least, but it had also looked like he was afraid to come near it.
By the end of the week, Clint’s prediction had come true, and Steve couldn’t turn around without almost tripping over his furry new shadow. Once, he very nearly stepped on her as he left the bathroom after a shower. She’d been curled up outside the door, nose pressed to the gap along the floor; he saw her just in time, but over-corrected and went ass-over-teakettle onto the bedroom carpet. He managed not to break anything or land on her, barely, and soon enough the panic of the moment was replaced by amusement, and of course his first thought was to text Clint with the story. Clint sent back a string of laughing emojis and suggested that she might be ready to go to the park.
want to be your friend, Steve, that’s what I’m trying to say. I took the news badly, but that’s on me, that’s a completely me-problem, and I’ll get through it. I’ll do better.”
. Like he wasn’t out of place after all. Like he was wanted here. Tony had made Steve feel like he had a home.
Steve’s eyes swiveled again to all the attention-grabbing splashes of color. “That’s...not a secret, is it,” he managed, still somehow getting enough air through the iron bands around his lungs to form words. “People know what the flags are.”
Carefully now, at what he would consider to be about 5% power, Steve repeated his throw and managed to launch the toy in a smooth arc only about ten yards down the open field. Penny dashed after it again, this time able to keep pace. As the disc started to lose altitude, but before it could get lower than about five feet off the ground, she bunched every muscle in her little body and
Tony gave a wet laugh and a wetter sniffle. “That’s no excuse for being a dick about it,” he paused, and the jingling of Penny’s collar suggested that he was petting her to give himself time to think. “You deserve to be happy. I had no right to just...cut you off like that.”
“No, I already had it. Since before you rejoined the living, actually,” Tony began to saunter nearer. “Rhodey gave it to me, along with some big speech about heroes that he could barely keep a straight face through because we both knew very well the real reason was to tease me for the big box of Cap merch I tried to hang all over our first dorm room, and which he did in front of Pepper so that I couldn’t smack him for it.”
Eventually, the channel gets big enough that the talk shows the Avengers occasionally appear on get wind of it. It’s customary for guests on such shows to be given a list of talking points to prepare them a bit--nothing too specific, but the moment Steve sees the word “YouTube” on the email from Fallon’s people, he knows what’s about to happen.
“Is this...a toy?” Steve guessed. Penny was whining softly, dancing impatiently at his feet, trying to sit still and show she was being good but not managing very well, with her eyes glued on the mini-shield. She seemed to know what it was for, at least. If only she could’ve told Steve what to do with it, they’d be set. “Do I just give it to her?”
or anything, he’s no Kjellberg or Fischbach, not anything like a McElroy. You’d never hear about him on the news, but he’s got a nice respectable medium-sized following. A pretty serious hobby, verging into what could honestly constitute a career, if he’d needed the money enough to bother becoming a partnered creator. His viewers worry about that sometimes, encouraging him to get his share of ad-revenue or even start a crowdfunding campaign, but he assures them he’s got a day job. (When they ask what he does, he says he’s an Avenger, of course, and they send him winky-faces and laughing emojis in return.)
Barton slow-blinked at him, just once, and then replied: “We’re both officially fully off duty this weekend. I think she had a friend out of town she wanted to see.”
Tony laughed, but Penny tilted her head all the way back to stare up at Steve with the aggrieved gaze of a very good girl who had been wearing her OUTSIDE gear for some time now and yet was still, despite all logic, inside. Steve smiled at her and ruffled her ears. He picked up the end of her leash and she began to wag furiously, ears pricking forward.
Tony nodded slowly, not bothering to process this information he hadn’t actually needed. His eyes flitted around the room, searching for anything to kill time until he could make an even-slightly-graceful exit. He spied a half-packed duffle bag open on the sofa.
“Oh, baby, talk anatomy to me,” Tony drawled, smiling lasciviously. He settled back against the park bench and started peeling the paper back from his own sandwich. “And anyway, who expects a ten-pound dog to be able to generate that kind of force from a standing stop?”
Coffee successfully poured, he turned to leave, but was stopped by a gentle-yet-immovable hand on his shoulder, which turned him in place.
“Not on your life, Cap,” Clint swore. “I mean, it’s still a complex topic and you should probably read up and get some information from a source that’s not me, but speaking as a 21st century gay? It’s doable. I have a very nice partner, I love him very much, and I feel safe saying that in front of my friends. Around here that goes for most of the strangers, too.”
It was Steve’s turn to stand very very still and hope his face was blank, though he was sure he looked like a deer in the headlights. “So...when you say this is a
Tony stares at Steve for a few seconds, the tip of his tail tapping in agitation. Finally he lets out a tiny, resigned huff, and steps forward. He swipes his cheek across Steve’s hand, just once, and flops to the floor with his back pressed against Steve’s leg. He’s awake, because he was upright zero seconds ago, but seems determined to convince the both of them that he is now sound asleep.
Tony pulled his feet in until he could tuck his face behind his knees, wrapped his arms around himself, and cried for all he was worth. He didn’t think, didn’t process, didn’t worry. Just cried. Just let the catharsis carry him, thoughtless, to whatever was next.
Tony scooped him out of the shield and stood up. Steve squirmed a little but gave up pretty quickly.
Holding perfectly still except for his feet, Tony rotated his chair 180 degrees to look out the office door.
The monitors in the room, as well as people’s screens at home, fill with the latest video from ALLCAP. It’s titled “‘Meeting’ the Real Captain America.”
Tony ambled down the aisle he knew held the most books that suited his once-great-king vibe, trailing his fingers over the spines as he went, scanning the titles without a particular choice in mind, waiting for something to reach out and grab him. He came to the end of the first row without having made a selection, and started to round the end, making a pass by the wall of windows.
The library was a big room--not as hyperbolically huge as the one in the movie, but bright, open and airy. It extended up into the next storey, taking up a hunk of square footage that rightfully belonged to the penthouse but which Tony had happily sacrificed in order to include a few sweeping, book-lined staircases and sliding ladders for high shelves, because Pepper always mentioned those when she talked about the scene. The room was built into the narrow end of the common floor, where the curtain-wall of windows curved around the west end of the building, providing a 180-degree view from the Empire State building at the far left to the Big Green Square that was Central Park on the right.
Getting up to such hijinks with the rest of his team had been great in its own right, but more importantly, had led to his second realization: spending time with Steve had been
He was trying very, very hard not to show it, and the universe was making it very, very hard to accomplish that.
Strange had stuck around long enough to explain how he’d tracked the enemy sorcerers to their base, been surprised to find their detention area full of undeniably human Avengers (also rather naked Avengers, mostly: the type of teleportation that had been used only worked organic matter by default, other objects had to be specially prepared in order to come along, hence the piles of empty clothing and gear left behind), and subsequently defeated all adversity through general superiority in every way yadda yadda Sorcerer SUPREME, yes Stephen, we’ve all heard your title, you can leave.
“Is that so?” Steve tried to affect a tone of mild interest, but couldn’t be bothered to put much effort into the facade, with the way Tony was looking up at him through lowered lashes and from an ever-decreasing distance.
Instead, he’d arrived at their bench, exhausted and desperate, and found a Steve, and looked into his eyes, and nothing had happened.
“Oh dear. Yes you would be in on that, wouldn’t you.” Tony had been loathe to go into the details of his time in captivity, even with Jarvis, but he’d had plenty to say about how his few trips to the dreamscape from there had given him strength, not to mention some pretty decent escape advice from his ghostly soldier. “But you’ve hit it on the head there, Captain. If anyone knows what it is to keep a secret identity, it’s our Tony. He will understand.”
While Tony had been playing Real Life Neko Atsume, his team had been held captive by literal dark wizards.
It was true: the site really wasn’t even all that impressive, mostly lumps and mounds and bits of what once might have been walls, but it was old and the locals were fond of it and some Durmstrang-y assholes had taken it over for rites that got Strange’s hackles up and now here they were. Because Stephen was
With enough force of will, Tony managed to lift one heavy, fumble-fingered hand enough to release the emergency latches on his helmet. The catches flipped back with little metallic pings, and fresh air flooded in. He shook off the cobwebs, blinking into the sudden sunlight and listening for signs of trouble.
Tony arranged a second storage bin with one of his spare shirts and one of Steve’s, for the sake of familiar scents, and regretfully left the second cat behind.
For a moment, Steve actually had a little trouble reconciling what was before him now with the pajama-clad ball of emotion he’d found on the library floor. What exactly Tony had done to his face and hair was far beyond Steve’s ability to say, but he looked fresh, energized, and not at all like he’d been weeping on someone else’s dog an hour ago. His hair, unlike Steve’s outdated side-part, had been teased into some kind of gravity-defying fluff that looked effortless, natural, and extremely soft. Steve sort of wanted to pet it. A lot.
Penny seemed unconcerned with talk of her age and/or weight; her entire focus was on Tony’s sandwich. She was staring at his ham-on-rye like she thought if she hoped hard enough, it might magically fly into her mouth. Tony smiled at her, ruffled her ears, sat up and turned back to Steve.
Eventually Friday night arrived and Tony fled, grateful, into the feminine embrace of his scheduled outing with Pepper and Natasha. Man-based drama should not be able to follow him there, he thought, like someone who had never been invited on a girls’ night before.
for most of a century? It was highly doubtful this mess would ever be wearable again, but he could do his best. Maybe it’d be passable for display purposes eventually, at least. Certainly the Captain wouldn’t actually need it, once Tony could spend a bit of time in his shop turning out a replacement. Or twenty.
Eventually Tony gave up and climbed up on a relatively high wall for a better view. When he cleared the edge, he was greeted by a small grey cat, perched in the center of a pile of fabric. It stared at him, impassive.
Steve had started off with rinsing his face, but by the end he realized he’d pretty much washed his whole upper half in the sink, and felt a little foolish for not having just taken a shower. It had only been a
Steve moaned, piteously, burying his face in Tony’s neck. Tony chuckled softly. He raised one hand from its perch at Steve’s waist and brought it down with just enough force to make a sound. To Steve’s delight, he left it there, digging his fingertips in slightly to get a good handful.
Clint was the worst (always), but Steve was the kind of cat that would always be standing right where you were trying to put your foot, especially if you were carrying something heavy, expensive, or sticky, or if you were maybe on the phone and not actually paying attention and wearing hard-soled dress shoes in a room with polished-concrete floors (sorry Steve sorry sorry sorry). Sam, when not busy trying to steal anyone’s man, was that cat who would appear on any book, newspaper, or laptop keyboard within 0.2 seconds of anyone trying to use it. Thor, on several occasions, brought Tony what could best be described as
It’s not fucking fair. He did what he was supposed to do. He found his person, he looked into their eyes. That’s how it works, most of the time. People who don’t have sight often bond at the sound of their person’s voice; nature finds a way. Everybody knows the story of Hellen Keller, unable to see, hear, or speak, but bonded at the first touch of her person’s hand as he attempted to greet her in the touch-language that she and her teacher had invented.
“I did warn you,” Steve insisted, unwrapping his sandwich. “I was very clear about what happens when she sees a bird.”
, like he’d been there first, like Clint had taken something precious from him, and that feeling sat sour in his chest because he knew very well that he’d never spoken up. He’d had no claim on Steve, and Steve couldn’t be expected to go around asking all his friends if they had crushes on him before he chose one to date.
he tries to think at Steve, even though he knows it won’t work. It’s not like the bond is going to suddenly seal now, five days later.
“Just trying to think like a teenager. You don’t think he looks like a Garfield, what does he look like? A Herman? Justin? Howard.”
out and finding out--or rather, falling under the mistaken impression--that Tony would hate him for it, he’d dreamed of a chance like this. A simple, private moment. A small intimacy he could share with the fella he liked.
“All the other scents I found in the drawer had these neat little stoppers in them,” Steve explained calmly, working hard to keep a straight face and not hide behind his hands. “One drop at a time. Sensible.
“...thank you,” What else could he say, to all that? Jarvis shook himself. “Goodness, what am I saying, letting this be the least bit about me, you’re alive! After all this time, Master Tony’s doomed soulmate is alive and home! What can I do for you, surely there were things you were missing in that state, anything I can provide?”
Tony looked down at his feet. What he’d at first disregarded as a pile of rags was in fact most definitely a suit of body armor, sans sleeves. There was a quiver of arrows half-buried under it, and a bow in the grass just on the far side of the wall. The little gray cat looked back up at him with a soft “mrrrp?” and got up to rub against his legs.
Sometimes, since Rebirth, Steve’s reflexes got out ahead of conscious thought. Sometimes, he didn’t actually know why he was doing a thing or what he was doing at all until he’d done it. Then he’d look down to find out he’d just drop-kicked a grenade away from a family of civilians or crushed a robot that had been inches from decapitating one of his team. So. He’d been almost as surprised as Tony to find himself ten yards away from his previous position and in possession of a frightened, helpless animal.
Tony looked genuinely shocked for a moment, but then seemed to remember that this was what a joke looked like when Steve told it. He burst out laughing. “What happened?”
The ending scene where the little screen just flashes “TILT” over and over again as sparks fly out of it is a little fake, but it’s not done in post. It’s a fake FitBit that Tony whipped up, rigged to display whatever Steve wants and appear to short itself out on command. Steve puts “practical effects by Tony Stark” in the video description.
Every time Steve got him cornered--and it did happen, because Steve was Steve and Tony wanted to say yes to him even when looking into Steve’s Big Sad Eyes made him feel like he’d been gutted--Steve wanted to talk about Gay Stuff. He would lead into it, a bit, chat about something normal for a few minutes to get Tony’s guard down, and then suddenly he’d be asking if he should get Penny a rainbow bandana, or if he should come out publicly now or wait, or what do you think of this, or is this the done thing, hey Tony, Clint says--
So when he’d seen the original reaction to his first video, he’d thought “viral” and made the second as a sort of thank-you, as acknowledgement. He’d expected that to be the end of it.
Steve looked at the thumb and snorted with self-conscious laughter. Tony chuckled softly along with him.
Steve’s voice was shaking by the end of his declaration, but, this time, Tony was smiling up at him with the exact sort of soft, gentle understanding that Steve had so desperately hoped for a week ago.
Sam, who was now a grey-striped tabby, didn’t put up much of a fuss. After a moment of consideration and a careful, supervised period of sniffing to make sure they remembered each other, Tony put him in with Steve. Realizing about then how long this might take, Tony paused to add bowls of water to each improvised holding area. Clint tried to make a break for it, which wasted a little more time, but Tony prevailed in the end.
Tony slumped into the dining chair that Nat had left his coffee nearest to, and obediently tucked into the plate of breakfast that landed in front of him. Everything was excellent, as always, and there was far too much of it, as always, but they’d put him next to Thor this morning, which made it particularly easy to dispose of extra. With a little help, Tony managed to clean his plate by the time everyone else started to look done and ready to move on with the day. He still wouldn’t consider himself fully booted, but he’d probably crossed 50%. That was better than he used to ask of himself before operating power tools, so lab time was on the immediate horizon.
It’s only a few minutes before Steve gives up on not moving. The tension leaked from his legs, and Tony steadied himself with one hand on Steve’s hip, knowing what was coming.
Tony had been keeping them hidden in a shoe box in the closet right above his favorite Prada suits, until eventually he could no longer get the lid closed. He huffed in amusement and disbelief, shaking his head at the box. Futurist as he was, he would never have predicted he would have an overflowing shoebox of love letters from Captain America.
Porn with minimal plot. (Let’s be honest no plot.) Smut. Top Steve/Bottom Tony. Steve and Tony fight. Angry sex. Workshop sex. Hard sex. Rough sex.
Tension leaked out of Steve and he delivered a few more well placed thwacks. Each one wrung a different noise from Tony, and he found himself being more turned on by the sounds and the sight of Tony’s ass jiggling than he was by the actual act of spanking him.
Now he was headed to the shower, which he would have to turn to burning, and leave the door open so he could see that he was, in fact, in Tony and his bathroom.
He didn’t spend any second thoughts at the incidents, until he encountered the flowery painting hanging in the living room that he had definitely not purchased, nor ever would. It looked like something he’d have found in his mother’s tea room.
When Tony would touch him, or open him up, Steve’s world seemed to narrow down to just the point of contact between him and Tony’s hands. To how his fingers would curl and twist, and how they both commanded and asked. There were times that Steve wanted to be Tony’s clay. To let him sculpt and forge him into whatever the genius wanted.
Unable to not smile a bit as he sighed in disapproval he took in the damage. Thankfully, it hadn’t been anything fragile. It was just a mess.
“Yes! It was obvious. You were letting your emotions get in the way. And I get it, you’ve had to make a lot of tough decisions, and because of that you’ve lost people close to-”
When Steve caught his breath enough he wrapped his arms around Tony and held him close. The afterglow of fuzzy warmth and contentment he was chasing surrounded them like a bubble. He turned his head to press his lips against Tony’s temple, and then couldn’t find it in him to move, so he just kept them pressed there as he waited for Tony’s breaths to even out more. Even with the arc reactor removed, his lung capacity wasn’t what it used to be.
It wasn’t long before Steve was attaching the word endearing to Tony. The genius was excited about the remodel, and all the ideas he and Pepper had been coming up with. All Steve had to do was express a vague interest in the training level and Tony was off.
Tony kept smiling. “Yeah, definite selling point. Big guy needs a big dog.” He came over to stand beside Steve, looping an arm around his waist. “So, what are you going to name him?”
The effect was instantaneous. Tension drained from his muscles, and the oils cleared his nasal passages, allowing him open and clear deep breaths. Even his head felt a little lighter.
Brown eyes lifted from the floor and Tony cautiously peeked at Steve, and yup. He’s all heart eyes and gushiness, like he’s full of warm caramel. For a moment Tony thought that may be just as bad, but that soon passed and he barked out a short laugh. He’s rewarded with a grin from Steve that always made him feel like he’s falling in love again.
“Tony stay with me!” Steve orders as he climbs in after Tony. He’s pretty sure Steve believed if he ordered someone to live they would.
The shorter man didn’t answer with words. He grabbed Steve by the back of the neck with one hand, and shifted upwards while pulling him down. Their lips met and Tony wasted no time working his mouth against Steve’s, relishing in how velvet soft his lips were, and praying this wasn’t the one time Pepper and he were wrong.
And this was one of those times. Tony was 90% certain that what they were fighting about didn’t warrant this level of blow up, but the words they’d thrown at each other put them way past the point of no return.
“That’s it, Tony. Come on, doll. You’re almost there.” Steve encouraged breathlessly. His own hips were moving to meet Tony now, their sweat shining skin slapping together obscenely. Tony’s meaty ass giggled in Steve’s hands.
For a moment Steve floundered between glaring and conceding. As soon as Tony threw the word honor into the ring Steve’s shoulders sagged a bit, and Tony could practically hear the winning bell.
Sitting at the kitchen island, Steve across from him, he switched between glaring at the offending stache and his tablet. Steve probably noticed, but Tony didn’t care. Steve knewhow he felt about it.
“Um. Unless, I was wrong. And then I’ll..Give him to Peter or something.” Tony would not bring Hugo back to the rescue. Not after what he’d been through. Heck, he wanted to take five of the canines home. Sam reminded him that though most of the Avengers liked dogs, five would be pushing it, and Natasha wasn’t above making Tony’s life hell in retaliation. So he’d settled for donating them five million dollars instead.
The fresh air filled Steve’s lungs as he exited the tower onto one of the highest balconies. Tony had asked him to meet him there for a date. Steve assumed it was for a nice candle lit dinner out in the cool Spring evening air, but instead he was greeted by Tony in the Iron Man suit.
“A Mikey footlong for me, please, and one with no bun for this guy.” Steve patted Tank on the head, his smile bright and genuine, his cheeks flushed red with the sting of the air.
The floor slid beneath him as Steve began his way out of the workshop to the elevator. Tony stayed limp, and grumbled, “yes.” He could feel the rumble in Steve’s chest against his thighs when the other man chuckled.
Having taken the stairs, Steve punched in the key code to their level, and went to the kitchen for a drink first, choosing Gatorade over water.
After the limo full of Avenger’s plus Pepper, Rhodey and Happy had been cruising for awhile, everyone properly distracted by conversation, Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist and pulled him in close to whisper in his ear, “worth it.”
When Tony woke up Steve was awake, but he wasn’t on alert in the no nonsense approach he took watch. Frowning, Tony gently pressed his hand to Steve’s forehead. He flinched away but not before Tony felt he was hot. Fever hot.
Steve’s eyes erupted with rage and he took a step closer to Tony. “Don’t dare say you get it! If you did, you wouldn’t be going off plan! When we’re on a mission, in the middle of a battle, it’s paramount we stick to it!” He stepped forward again, towering over Tony. “Going off book and doing what you think is best is how people get killed.”
