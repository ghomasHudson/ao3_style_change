?  I haven't had access to the news in two decades, congratulations!  And happy birthday! You're... what, ninety-one? Ha ha!
?  Was he not content because of the terrible society he was being forced to champion, unaware of the oppressiveness of freedom?
, pay attention... there's a speech on the last page on the goldleaf paper, just in case anyone has questions about Iron Man, front page, here's the itinerary for tonight, the guest list is on the back, names in blue are ones Tony has to talk to and actually be nice to, obviously you won't know everyone, Steve, but try to start learning names because part of your job is giving those names to Tony, because he's hopeless when it comes to that, you take his phone and get any contact numbers he might need, and on page two, there's a list of--"
, goddamn hear him. He wasn't aware of anything that wasn't Tony or the dildo in his ass and he wasn't going to stop rocking into it either. Steve needed release so badly; he felt so full...
"Go on," Steve said when she hesitated, drawing her gaze back to him instead of the disapproving officials around her.
"I used to start fights with Alphas who said shit on the street all the time. I was a menace. And when Bucky ignored me it just made me play out more. I would try to go to bars because he didn't want me drinking, worried about my health and all that...but I was curious and bored. I got drunk once. He was so mad at me. It was stuff like that.  ...omegas weren't even really s'posed to drink in my century.  It was considered... you know, immodest."
Tony stared, remembering how he'd played with the model in the car.  He didn't remember the incident on screen but took a vicious joy in knowing he'd gotten to play with the model as an adult.  He considered moving some pieces around, just to spite his father.
Take it easy?  How the hell could he take it easy?  Steve's injuries, those four casualties: it was all his fault.  But he nodded because he doubted anyone would listen.  Somehow, it was making him feel worse that everyone was being so nice to him. He wanted someone to get angry and yell at him, confirm his guilt for him, validate his feelings of remorse.  He felt like Steve was too good for him but he couldn't let go of the omega.  He
"You know.  When the Alpha dies and the omega just kinda..."  Tony rolled his hand around, uncertain how to communicate the way Jarvis had aged suddenly, stopped eating, stopped sleeping, stopping
"You can't leave without even saying good-bye to George," said Banksy suddenly, desperately.  "George will be back tonight, or tomorrow morning, and he'll worry about you."
When Tony took the collar off Steve hadn't even realised he'd been holding his breath until it was gone, the loss of the heavy weight making him feel...strange, almost.
my fault, Steve.  I gave him the tickets.  I got him to that Expo.  I led him there like a lamb to the slaughter."
"Yeah but she does slobber a lot," said Cooper, shooting Lila a look.  The pachycephalosaurus in her small, fat hands was shiny with drool.
"You should go on SNL... hey!  This year, Fourth of July's on a Sunday.  Go on SNL the night before your birthday, it can be a big show, it'll be fun, but also serious... lots of celebrities go on there, politicians too, so it won't be too serious.  And maybe you could get Swift to be the musical guest.  Oh my God, it'll look great, you and her, two blonde kick-ass omegas just jamming out with the band, you know, you can do a couple of skits but also give a little speech, or whatever... oh, and you can announce the charity then, yeah!  It's live so no one will be able to stop you!  JARVIS, tell Don Roy King Steve wants to do SNL!  Get Hammond on the phone!  And contact Swift, too!"
Tony grunted, sounding pleased, and nudged Steve back.  He was halfway to falling onto the mattress before he realized Tony had undone the ties to his breeches and pulled them down over the curve of his hips.  Steve’s cock sprang free, hard and red with strain, standing up between them with beads of glistening white dripping from the head.
“Bet you’re looking forward to a real, homecooked meal, eh?  I tried to get Tony to pay more attention to that stuff, but he never could manage to get the hang of it,” Howard said with a shake of his head, glancing down into the swirls of drink before peering up at Steve. “Even got him one of those fancy oven things with the cooktop and microwave and all that for his birthday one yea.  And how do you think that ended up?  Rewired the damn microwave oven transformer into some kind of metal melter, can you believe it?”
He stared down at the blank phone screen for a moment before hitting the other number in his favorites. It rang too long, and the default voicemail picked up. Steve clicked the phone off and tried the number again, but got the same result. He thought about calling Nat back, asking her to go on over, and turned the phone over a few times in his hand trying to come to a decision.   It shouldn’t be this hard for him to make a decision, not after everything, but even small choices these days felt like someone chinking away at whatever it was holding him together.   He breathed out and forced himself to hit the button to dial the number again. This time, when the voicemail picked up, he didn’t hesitate.
“Yeah, I noticed you’d moved on.  Pretty damn quickly, too,” Tony blurted, anger spiking through him, then bit the inside of his lip.  He hadn’t meant to say that.  Okay, yes, he had, that had been the thought rattling around in his head since the fucking poker game.
He would explain and…and everything would be okay.  Steve said everything would be okay. His mind chanted it like a mantra or maybe if he thought it three times, he’d conjure Rhodey, he didn’t know, but he couldn’t stop thinking it.
Tony let out a breathy moan as he pulled away. His hands came up to cup Steve’s jaw, thumb stroking lightly across Steve’s cheek.  His eyes were dark, round pools, burning with heat and want, and whatever he saw in Steve’s eyes must have been an answer, because he leaned up, finding Steve’s mouth again.   Tony’s beard scraped over Steve’s skin, rough and brittle, but his tongue was soft, smooth, gentle as it glided across the seam of Steve’s lips, seeking entrance. The feel of it, the combination of sensations, was almost overwhelming, sending shockwaves of want cascading through him.
“You could’ve died, you idiot,” Tony ground out, then slammed his mouth back to Steve’s, teeth scraping the edge of Steve’s bottom lip, then nipping, hard enough to bruise anyone else, sending a pulse through him that apparently ended in his cock.  When Tony finally pulled back, the look he gave Steve was strange, like he was seeing something he didn’t like looking at, but was making himself look anyway, because Tony would, he would look and look and look until he couldn’t stop seeing.  “If you die for him, I’ll never forgive you.  I’ll hate you.”
“Okay, so, you just sort of can move backwards and forwards, like this,” Tony instructed, shifting his feet against the planks of the deck.  “Then to the side.”  Steve mimicked the movements of Tony’s feet, picking up the simple steps in no time. “See, you’re a natural,” Tony whispered, voice cracking on the end.
He’d liked seeing her finally happy, though.  Really happy, in all the ways a person should be.  She never asked him to move aside when Angie showed up, just made the world a bit bigger, and suddenly, their tiny house was filled with laughter and messes and tears and more love than he would have thought possible. A good life, Steve thought.  He didn’t mind not having much of it left now.  It felt right, this end.  Fitting, somehow.
He glanced back over at Steve, who was watching him with one arm laying across the car door below the window, his knuckles rubbing absently against the glass. There was a muscle ticking in his jaw.  Tony watched it pulse, counting the seconds as the silence stretched out.
“None of this is fair,” Tony snapped, then scrubbed a hand over his face and let out a breath. “It does not matter.  You have fought your war, my soldier. You are mine now. Destiny cannot have you.”
“Lost your way?” Tony repeated, though Steve could tell by the tone that Tony didn’t believe that for a minute.  “That was it, right. Got lost, wandered off, something like that? Looking for the John? Going for a little tryst and took a wrong turn at the potted plant?  Hiding from the date? She’s boring, is that it? Wants to talk about how deep R.E.M.’s music is? Thinks Perot has some good ideas, even if he looks like a missing Keebler elf.  Reads every Grisham as soon as it comes out. Wanted to join the Peace Corps, but didn’t for very understandable reasons, of course. Keeps mentioning something called deforestation,” he rambled to a stop, probably noticing Steve staring at him.
“Good, good,” Zola muttered.  “I trust you will remark upon that to His Highness.  Perhaps tonight?”
“I also happened to have the opportunity observe the Ambassador’s soldiers as their party was visiting these last days,” Tony said, clearing his throat again and sending a quick look Steve’s way.  “They seemed very close and shared a true camaraderie.  Rhodey assures me this is often the case with soldiers,” Tony began, voice sounding almost pinched, it was so clipped and precise.   Steve frowned in confusion at the turn of the conversation.  “It occurred to me that you, being a soldier, were perhaps worried about the fates of your fellow soldiers.  Most are not so fortunate as to end up where you are, after all, and this must—I can see as how it would trouble you.  It would soothe your mind to know that they were well,” Tony said in a careful, measured tone.  “You would be able to put those concerns to rest and--and move on.”
“That has been mentioned at some point by pretty much everyone I’ve ever known,” Steve admitted, mouth flattening around a chagrined sigh as Natasha’s voice seemed to ring in his ears.  A surprised bark of laughter answered for the King, who looked delighted when Steve raised his eyes from where his hands curled into fists in his lap to notice. “Sorry, I—“
." She was a beta, so it made sense for her to be here instead of Phil, even if it was more awkward.
Not a single performer had talked to him about his force bond, which Steve was eternally grateful for. They were just trying to make him smile, make him feel relaxed; that counted for a lot.
you, Donner. Look, we can't fight your battles for you forever. The only way you can be safe is if you refuse to go with them yourself. Else they'll accuse us of forcing you to stay here." Donner looked conflicted. It didn't look like he refused much throughout his life. "Please."
Steve stopped him by the door with a light touch to his arm, his expression almost...hesitant. His confidence was gone and now Steve seemed nervous, almost the same kind of nerves he'd had when him and Tony had tumbled around in bed together and he hadn't known what he was doing. "Hey," his words were soft. "I'm sorry you don't like what you see." And Steve meant it. He would never hide himself from Tony, it was warts and all between them, but that didn't mean he didn't regret upsetting him. Steve knew he could be...scary like this, that he wasn't what people expected.
Natasha held up a thin manila folder and a small cardboard box that looked like it might contain a necklace; the contents rattled.  "Steve. These are for you."
Steve had bitten into his left palm hard and made it bleed. Across the span of one cell wall he'd smeared blood across the glass in clear letting:
He caught Steve's mouth in his again, working their jaws together, still slowly rocking into Steve, feeling the omega's body wet him.  He could heard someone making muffled groans and whimpers and it took him a moment to realize it was him.
Get your ass downstairs this instant and don't come up until you've sorted things out with your Alpha.
Tony sat up with Steve and wrapped his legs around the other's waist, kissing him languidly.  He wanted to forget the bunker for a while. Forget Lab 9, forget that omega that seemed to flick in and out of existence, forget the men both he and Steve had killed.
Sam stepped forward from where he'd been leaning against the wall and put a hand on Rhodey's shoulder, tugging him back a few steps.
He wanted someone familiar.  An Alpha.  Someone who knew him, someone who knew him as more than simply
"We're not talking about you," Steve said quietly, looking a little stressed as he took another corner. He clearly didn't want to talk about it. "It's not about the simulation. Sort of. Just ignore it."
... whatever. Steve will just tell me later." Aria moved to drop down on the sofa and pull out her phone, scrolling through emails. The silence was almost awkward until JARVIS interrupted it.
He didn't get to bed until one himself and he practically collapsed into it, having physically exhausted himself.  Hopefully he wouldn't dream. Steve fell asleep almost instantly, though not before murmuring a quick prayer on Donner's behalf. All he could think about was getting Donner home safe... wherever the hell home would end up being for him.
do that, it woulda killed him!"  He was getting choked up.  Years of feeling his omega's desire... God, that had been torture.  Yet still, even though he'd always refused Steve's affection, he'd still come home every night to a warm meal.  Steve had been a good omega and he'd never even told him that.  "I stopped feeling the bond in Azzano.  Jim Morita, he was bonded, too, and they experimented on him, too, and his bond got broke, too.  And since me n' Steve couldn't feel each other and Steve's neck wasn't marked no more I thought he just wanted to start over like we weren't even bonded so... so we weren't really bonded anymore, not really, at least not like we could actually
Steve was sitting on the edge of the bed.  There was a bruise on his neck.  Tony felt sudden panic.  He remembered making that bruise.  They had been sitting on the couch, yes.  He had touched Steve's face, and Steve had closed his eyes and nuzzled into Tony's hand... and then Tony had...  he had pinned Steve down, licked him, bit him... and... then what?  Something with a computer?  Had Steve carried him to bed?  Had they...?
"You're right...men like Gideon, they're really not worth it. I bet he voted to send us to Guantanamo. Asshole."
"JARVIS!" yelled Tony, nearly tripping over himself to get Steve all the things he'd requested.  "Play some Einaudi!"
," said Banksy, giving him a kiss on the cheek before blowing past to talk to one of the teleprompters.  Tony beamed.
“...sure,” Steve hummed, trying not to feel weird about all this.  He knelt on the bed carefully near Tony’s head and curled his fingers around the other's’ shoulders.  At least he knew how to do this.  After long sparring sessions with Natasha they often tried to ease each other’s sore muscles.  Whilst they did they would talk and sometimes she would teach him Russian, a little more every time.  She wanted him to be fluent by the end of the year.  Said it was a useful language to know.  And it was good to have goals.
Steve nodded, trying to push down any nerves he had. He was relieved Tony had liked it. Steve hadn't been sure but he'd only been too shy to ask anyone else for their opinion on the matter. He thought about asking Aria, but she thought so much of him and he didn't think she could deal with him defiling the 'Cap' image quite like this. Clint would never drop it and Natasha would be too smug about it. Sam would have given him so much shit...and he already had too much dirt on Steve.
Steve looked emotional, and for once, not in a bad way. He looked overwhelmed. And he was, with a strange sense of happiness, perhaps even gratitude. He studied Tony's face intently and then kissed him again and the kiss was filthy and rough and a little awkward, lips parting and tongues nudging together, teeth clicking. Steve trembled against him. When they finally parted for air his cheeks were pink and eyes a touch darker.
"Oh no, no no no, don't go back--" protested Pepper, trying to rouse Tony.  "James, is there any more vodka on his desk?"
"Steve, you're officially on lockdown.  No leaving the premises. They want eyes on you at all times."
Steve was only semi-aware of his surroundings. All he was really focused on was Tony, and Tony being inside of him. Every moment he could he got on top of Tony or coaxed the Alpha between his legs. He ate a few pieces of food via Tiberius's instruction but really, he was only interested in one thing.
David busied himself with cleaning the wound with iodine swabs before he got out far more professional-looking bandages than the ones Steve had found in Tony's bathroom the night before. "So.  I doubt I'm here just to redress a wound." His tone was a touch gentler.
They put everything in the back of the car with Phil's help and just focused on fitting it all inside.  (At least Tony was no longer wearing his armor.)  Steve sighed as he straightened up and saw Tony peering at the board littered with small pieces of buildings and what not. "For the record," he breathed, "I didn't think Howard saw me as an equal. He just liked how much he could antagonize other Alphas via my existence." He shut the boot and went to get in the passenger seat of the car as Natasha was already starting it up.
"Have you found your bond affecting all aspects of your life, or has it been mostly personal?" asked Boswell.  "We haven't seen much of Iron Man lately."
Steve got into the McLaren on the driver's side. He'd gotten quite fond of driving the thing. He missed the agility of a bike but he enjoyed the real rumble of a real engine beneath him in a car. He glanced over sideways at Tony as he started her up.
Tony realized he had just been handed at least fifty subpoenas.  "...PEPPERRRR?" he hollered, turning into the house.
Tony grunted in his sleep and, still largely unconscious, rolled over and wrapped an arm around Steve's waist, pulling them closer to each other.
A sudden memory.  Yinsen, performing surgery on a young man, a young man probably no older than twenty or twenty-one.  Tony didn't speak Farsi, which was what they were talking in, but he'd watched, silently, as the young man cried and pleaded and as Yinsen extracted a bullet from his shoulder and stroked his hair and reassured him.  That same man had, less than forty-eight hours earlier, pointed a gun at them, and threatened them, but Yinsen treated him like he was his son.  When Tony had asked, Yinsen had smiled at him patiently and recited, "ἃ δ᾽ ἂν ἐνθεραπείῃ ἢ ἴδω ἢ ἀκούσω, ἢ καὶ ἄνευ θεραπείης κατὰ βίον ἀνθρώπων, ἃ μὴ χρή ποτεἐκλαλεῖσθαι ἔξω, σιγήσομαι, ἄρρητα ἡγεύμενος εἶναι τὰ τοιαῦτα."
"...uh... I was gonna take a break from Iron Man for a while," said Tony tactfully, reaching up to try to smooth down the hair at the back of his neck.  His fingers brushed his scar and the hair bristled even more.  He gave up and his hand dropped down.  "...maybe later," he mumbled grudgingly, wanting to give Steve
Piper had her hands over her bright-red face and was peeking through her fingers as Richard showed them diagram after diagram of different mating positions.  Tony and Eric, perhaps because they were also both a little drunk, were giggling like schoolboys.
Tony stepped over him, dropping the face plate, making a beeline for Steve.  Steve was already on the floor, kneeling.
"It wouldn't be if you hadn't spent the last month trying to dismiss your bond," muttered Natasha under her breath.  Sam shot her a look of warning. That wasn't helpful.
"I did know your father," said Fury, lacing his fingers together pleasantly.  "He was a founding member of SHIELD."
Tony watched sulkily as Pepper pulled him away from the dance floor, but there was so much good music and loud noises and colors that he was almost immediately lost in wonder.
Rhodes choked on his beer and sputtered, getting ale all over the place.  "I came to make sure you were okay," he coughed.  "How's all of it been going then? The honeymoon stuff...is that...okay?" Rhodes asked, sounding a little awkward now Tony was half licking at Steve's neck. Steve would never have the heart to push Tony away, though.
is a good thing.  Here.  For…for now.  This whole—thing we’re doing here.  I feel like I need to caveat this.  Matt?  Say something lawyerly.”
“Jarvis,” Tony began, then cut himself off and dropped his gaze to the ground, spine stiffening under Jarvis’s watchful eyes.  “It’s just a stupid mug. It’s not a big deal.”
“If you fucking apologize for that again, I really will scream,” Tony said.  “Holy shit,” he said again, then beamed at Steve, touching two of his fingers lightly to his mouth.  Steve didn’t think he even realized he was doing it. “Okay, so, you definitely kept your side of the bargain. Definitely.  Ah. So. Yeah. The plans,” he said, clearing his throat and looking over at the window for a moment. Steve watched his throat work, saw his shoulders straighten as he sucked in a bracing breath.
him, in some deep, dark way that Tony had been so careful to hide, and now, Steve would despise him.  He would know how weak Tony was.  How there was this wrongness inside him that people like Ty and Preston and others (Howard) saw in him.  He’d been so careful. So good.
“We’re seriously going to the Grand Canyon,” Tony told him, tilting his head a bit and watching Steve for long enough to make Steve feel a blush creeping up his neck. Tony grinned, and finally looked away, seemingly satisfied with whatever he saw on Steve’s face.  Awe and disbelief, probably, Steve figured.
The world seemed to move in slow motion, and then, as if someone hit a button, it sped up, so fast that Steve felt like he was reeling from some unknown force pressing down on him.  He heard a crash, and looked down, only to realize he had dropped one of the bottles he had been dutifully putting into the recycling bin that Brock steadfastly refused to use.  The air rushed out of his lungs.  His vision danced, a veil of black lace falling over his eyes.  Then it all coalesced, at once, a single pinprick, and he stared at Brock.
“Please, please, Steve, please,” Tony begged, a desolate half-moan against Steve’s mouth. “Please let me love you as you do me, as you are, not as you think you should be.  Please believe me that I do, that I will.  Forever,” Tony pleaded, punctuating each request with kisses that would have been cruel from anyone else, sharp tongue edging into Steve’s mouth with a demanding force, teeth scraping over Steve’s bottom lip, Tony’s mouth chasing his breath away.  “Look at me,” Tony demanded, shaking the hands that still held Steve’s jaw between them.  “Look at me.
Well, Steve thought with a sigh.  It wasn’t as if it was his first time trying to charm a crowd.  It seemed the whole of the city had come out to see their small parade, Steve thought a few moments later as they rounded a curve and emptied onto the main thoroughfare, the High Road, lined with its many shops, stacked like hats atop a head, and manses that seemed to barely fit in their narrow confines, as if at any moment the whole street would burst at the seams.
Steve would have noticed, Tony thought, giving the carpet a bitter, vicious kick that did nothing but leave a darker stripe where his foot had skidded through the fibers.  Steve always noticed.  Even those last few months, when he’d been all distracted with work and gone so much, Steve would have fucking noticed.  He didn’t want Steve to notice that he was falling apart.  Fuck.  God.  Steve was going to notice.  Steve was going to
Steve groaned.  His back and neck arched.  He could feel his throat working as he struggled to keep from shouting.  Pressure coiled deep and low, filling him and leaving him empty at the same time.  He wanted more.  Wanted to feel, touch, taste, wanted all of Tony.  He could want that in here.  He could allow himself to want it, in here, just for a little while, in the dark hours when he belonged to Tony.
“What you did—” Steve began, breaking off and tipping his head back, blinking at the canopy overhead with its colorful swirls and whorls.  “What you’re talking about.  It isn’t what Zola meant, Tony.  It
“She’s going to have donuts, isn’t she?” Steve asked, pulling back a little and looking down at Tony.  “Admit it, you’re ditching me for donuts.”
“What did change your mind?” Tony asked.  Someone shouted congratulations at them as they walked, and Tony raised a hand in acknowledgment, though they didn’t slow.  “Rhodey can be persuasive, but you strike me as post-nuclear-winter-cockroach level of not letting go of an idea.”
“Steve, we’re going to head out in a bit,” Jane said after putting her plate in the kitchen sink.  “Do you need a ride to class?”
It hurt.  It still hurt, even though he knew Steve wanted the company to do well.  Even though Steve was giving him what Tony had wanted for so long but never dreamed he’d actually get to have.  That was the whole point.  Building the company.  Steve was smart enough to know that he would never get anywhere with it if he didn’t exert some dominance from the get-go.  If Howard and Obie could, they’d run roughshod over him, send him out to glad-hand and give them validity with a military they’d never served while they made all the decisions.  The perfect paper hero they could put on stage and sell to the world. Tony was sure that had been the plan.
They played a few more games, though Tony didn’t ask Steve to repeat the good luck gesture.  It was that, or he was going to have to spill the drink that magically appeared next to him on his pants to hide the evidence that he was reduced to a fifteen-year-old ready to cream himself because his fake husband breathed on him.  It was embarrassing.  He’d care, but Steve seemed to be having a good time watching Tony gamble and before he quite knew what was happening, he was explaining the rules and letting Steve toss the dice.  It was absurdly delightful to watch Steve win or lose.  Tony didn’t care about the money, but Steve’s expressions ranged from looking like someone had given him a pony when he won to frowning at the table like he could will it into submission when he lost.
of crickets, Christ Almighty--“ I’ll...deal with that.  But, you can stop now. Let him...he can buy what he wants.  I don’t need to know about it.”
Obie had looked at him then, and it had been one of those taking-looks.  The kind that followed you, that you knew were still happening, even when you couldn’t see them.  He remembered hating Obie a little then.  Swearing to himself that it wasn’t true, it wouldn’t be true, he wouldn’t let it.   And yet, here he was, jealous of David and his limited edition Viagra clock.
The King’s words proved prophetic, Steve thought, some hours later when the sun was just barely touching the horizon.  Round and round, back and forth, all morning and most of the afternoon.  Each grudging admission that perhaps the King’s counterpoint had merit seemed to delight the man, who all but crowed when Steve agreed with his proposal to move the ballistas to the sides of the castle’s bastion.
He wasn’t sure who he was beseeching.  A god he long ago stopped believing in, a universe that never played fair, the doctors, SHIELD, Steve, himself.  Maybe all of them.
Steve groaned into Tony’s mouth when he felt one of Tony’s hands circle his length, lightly at first, then with enough pressure for Steve to really feel it.  He thrust into the ring of Tony’s hand, the familiar rough burn of skin on skin curling his hand into a fist against the wall next to Tony’s head, the other moving to the waist of Tony’s pants with far less coordination than he would have liked.  He felt Tony’s mouth form a slight grin against his own at his efforts, and he made himself tear his mouth away long enough to look down to see what he was doing, breath echoing in the room in sharp pants.  Tony took pity on him enough to at least toe off his shoes while Steve finally managed to undo Tony’s belt and work the zipper on the front of Tony’s slacks down while Tony toed his shoes off and stepped out of his pants.  Tony dropped his hands from Steve long enough to pull his shirt over his head, tossed it to the floor in one practiced motion, one hand immediately going back to stroking Steve’s cock, while the other cupped Steve’s jaw and guided his mouth back down to Tony’s.
“Night!” Happy replied, then opened the limo’s moonroof enough to give them a small wave as he put the limo into a three-point turn to get out of the driveway.
Tony bit his lip and swiped a hand across his brow.  His stomach roiled, but thankfully, he hadn’t eaten dinner.  Or lunch.  Or…well.  Ty said they’d grab something on the way over, but then Ty had been busy.  He was close on one of his projects. Tony got that.  That was the thing.  Him and Ty, they
“Jesusfuckingchrist,” Tony managed, his head tipping back until he was staring up at the blinding overhead lights, a deep, quaking moan torn from his throat.  Steve’s whole body thrummed with energy at the sound, his own cock a matching version of Tony’s, leaking fluid over his stomach and thighs and onto the mat beneath him.  There was something about having Tony like this that sent a heady surge of power and protectiveness through Steve. Tony and his tactile hands, always touching, making Steve feel alive, driving out everything else, his watchful eyes, seeing so much and not nearly enough, and here he was, hands immobile and eyes forced to watch only his own reactions.  Because he trusted Steve.  It was more than Steve should have, really, this faith that Tony placed in him, when he couldn’t fully return it, not yet.  He couldn’t take that chance.
They had been so young, Tony remembered, pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger as he let out a long hiss of air.  He leaned forward and braced his hands around the top of the dresser, then looked up at his reflection in the mirror.  So damn young, he thought again.  They’d paid the price for his mistakes far more thoroughly than he ever had.  He owed them this, owed them some justice, however hollow the comfort may be.  If Obie was really behind his kidnapping, the funneling of weapons to terrorists and now…now this
He petted Steve’s hair again, then a knock sounded at the door, and Tony bade whoever it was to enter.  A moment later, Cam came charging in, his face red with exertion and his breaths coming in quick heaves.
A muscle worked in his jaw.  Steve could count his heartbeats on it.  Slowly, Tony turned to look at him, steely-eyed and straight-backed, gaze boring into Steve like he could see the deep, dark part that celebrated victory at Rumlow’s fate. Could see it and understood it, and clawed open his own chest so that Steve could keep it deep and dark.
A strong profile, Steve thought.  Striking.  The beard wasn’t to hide gout or a second chin, but rather because it suited the face.  Full lips, a straight nose and eyes just slightly too wide set.  For the first time in months, Steve fingers itched for a stick of coal and a bit of parchment to see if he could capture the King’s features with any degree of skill.  He would need to convey motion, Steve thought to himself.  The King was almost always moving, gesturing, talking, expressive in everything he did.  He wondered if he could get the eyes right.  The fierce intelligence there, the constant calculation, coupled with a heady dose of interest and challenge, and an unexpected softness, almost brittle in how transient it sometimes seemed, like one wrong word or move could shatter it, and the occasional waspish hardness that seemed to drop over the King’s features like a portcullis.
“Why?” Tony asked. “What the hell does that even mean?” He meant it to sound demanding, not all whiny and pleading like it came out, but he didn’t know what to do with this whole conversation.  He wanted to go back to his room, crawl into bed and spend the next twelve hours reliving everything he’d done wrong since he got up.  As one did.
“Well, good chat. Glad we got all that out on the table,” Tony grimaced, watching Steve let out a low chuckle, which, okay, that was a positive sign. He felt himself relax ever so slightly.
“Ummmm—hmmm, I would not wait for that acorn to fall,” Kadina laughed, throaty and full of challenge.  “The King hoards his treasure.”
“Food.  Back.  No food for you,” Tony repeated, sitting up in his seat.  “Can’t have my ball-and-chain choking on his own idiocy.
“Observatory’s fine,” Tony replied.  “My mom took me when I was a kid.  It’s fun.  Kinda cheesy, you know, but fun.”  The Tesla Coil was kind of neat in a blast from the past kind of way, with its weird noise and lightning-like discharges.  Energy without wires.  That was Tesla’s goal, or one of them, anyway, Tony remembered.  Fairly impossible, at least these days.  Until someone figures out hot fusion and the tiny problem of plasma containment once you actually managed to create the reaction.  Bumps in the road to progress, Tony thought with a small smile.
“Oh, God.  Oh, God, oh, God,” Steve moaned and blew out a long, thin breath through his teeth.  A warm huff of air that might have been a laugh sent a shudder through his whole body.  The King’s tongue laved a path up and down over Steve’s hole, circled the rim, and then pressed inside, just the tip, flicking lightly against the inside of Steve’s body.  Air punched out of his chest, and some kind of keening wail built in the back of his throat, coming out in stuttering gasps of barely-there sounds.   He tossed his head side to side, and gripped the thick brocade coverlet in his fists.
“Why are you still on your farm and not off at war with your friend?” Tony asked.  “Because the harvest must be finished, the fields prepared, the house and animals settled and a hundred other reasons you tell yourself, I’m sure, but the truth is...the truth is, you can’t bring yourself to leave, can you? Why did those who tormented you suddenly leave you alone?  Because only the most depraved would fail to recognize that you were under my cloak of protection. Why are you not wed, with a gaggle of children at your knee? For the same reason that eyes which should follow you wherever you go, pass over you without seeing.  A vampire’s Claim upon a human is a bond like no other, one forged in blood and night.  You are mine.  You know it. The rest of the world knows it. Even if neither you nor anyone else is aware of why, it is there, binding you to me and pulling you away from everyone else.  You will be safe, yes, but you will never leave.  You will never love.  You are
Tony sighed and glanced over at the window, where the bright lights of the Prudential Center and John Hancock building, still small by comparison to the skyscrapers they’d seen in other places, lit the city.  He liked Boston.  It was slow.  Easy.  So not California.  He loved their townhome, with its sloped hill of a road out front and rooftop deck where he and Steve strung lights and sometimes watched old movies, all bundled up in sleeping bags or danced, when the nights were warm, to the Andrews Sisters while Steve told him about Bucky or his mom or how he’d once broken the neck of a man who couldn’t say squirrel right.  Steve would talk when they danced. That was another thing Tony had learned. Not at first.  Not the first dance, or the second, but after a while, he’d talk, and sometimes, he needed to, even when he didn’t want to, Tony knew.
If anything in these fics entertained you, a comment or kudos is the only way I know that.  Either would be appreciated!
Steve.  Steve was Captain America.  Beautiful, charming, smart, funny, kind-hearted Steve, who bought him desserts and chased down kidnappers was Captain America.  Of course, he was. This karmic shitshow was Tony’s life, after all.  He was going to, well, not strangle Natasha, because that was clearly impossible, but have a very serious conversation with her about boundaries.
“One moment, Sir, and I’ll buzz you through.  Sorry for the delay,” Agent Better To Ask Forgiveness said, turning on his heel and heading for the guard booth.
“Happy,” Steve said.  Warm pleasure spiked through Tony.  I made him happy, Tony thought to himself with a waffling sort of disbelief that made his limbs go loose.  Then, Tony caught the telltale sound of tires on gravel coming up the drive.  It took a few, discordant seconds for it all to coalesce in his head with the kind of realization that manages to creep up on you and hit all at once at the same time.
Steve sighed and rubbed at his forehead with one hand. Just get the God-damned soap, Rogers, he told himself firmly.   Finally, he grabbed one of the plain, white ones off the shelf in front of him almost at random, then picked out one that promised to smell like sandalwood, whatever that was, but he liked the print on the packaging.
Steve walked out of the tent, Bucky on his heels, and first saw the Sept, aglow with soft, golden light. Tony stood outside, Captain Rhodes next to him, resplendent in dark gray, but Steve had eyes only for Tony.  Even at this distance, Steve could see the slight relaxation of his stance when he saw Steve.  Tony wore his colors, of course, deep red, as dark as blood on snow, darted through with gold, a simple golden circlet sitting low around his head.  It was partly enameled and set with uncut gemstones, the hammered gold pieces joined together by small hinges.  Steve recognized it, only by some vague story he had heard talk of when he was younger.  The Iron Crown, the first worn by a Stark when the Lords bent the knee however many centuries ago it was.  Inside was an iron bad, on which the gold plates were affixed.  The iron had come from the sword the first Stark King buried in the ground to both lay claim to the Realm and bind himself to its protection.
“There’s a two-car garage.  And there’s the deck, of course.  Great view.  Did you see it when we drove up?  You can see the whole valley.  Really, that’s what it’s all about, isn’t it?” Allen asked, trying for chipper, but coming off a bit uncertain.
“He has already chosen you, Tony.  Inartfully, perhaps, but I believe he is trying,” Jarvis told him gently.  “He does not see that you have already chosen him, as well.”
“He seems happy about it,” Maria said with a flat sort of nonchalance that she didn’t quite pull off.  “Not that he says much about it, of course.  Not to me, anyway.  I don’t see why he didn’t go to CalTech.  It’s so much closer to home.”
The department store was brightly lit, and cut through with large, tiled aisles with bins and racks of merchandise, mostly colognes and jewelry.  White-walled make-up counters gleamed from the center of the store, with poofy, rotating chairs and black-draped cosmeticians explaining the price of beauty to avid Betas and an Omega whose fingers sported more rocks than Stonehenge.
The bed dipped and then righted itself as Steve moved his knee off the edge.  A shuffle of feet.  The rough swooshing sound of the uniform moving.  Out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see the shadows on the wall move in pantomime, and he was suddenly very conscious of the position he was in, of how he must look and that Steve was looking.  Standing there.  Looking at him like this.  Inspecting, Tony’s mind supplied and he shivered. Swallowed.  Closed his eyes and breathed out.  Humiliation burned though him.  His cock twitched.  A slow rivulet of slick was leaking out of his hole and down over where his balls were stuffed into the panties.  He could feel the thick stream of it as it wound its way down. He was sure Steve could see it, too.  His cock strained all the harder at the thought.  That made the shame worse, but it was good, too, and he didn’t know how to parse that, so he focused on the shadows.  The wall.  Steve.  He breathed out.
“You can really do all those things Tony said, huh?” Bruce asked, then whistled when Steve nodded once, jerkily, the gold discs dangling from his veil clinking as he did.  “Hell of a thing, that. If there was something like that, some kind of concoction...think of what it could do. That could...that could change the world. People would kill for something....”  he trailed off, gaze darting from Steve to Tony.
“You?  This was—how did—what in the—” Tony stammered, walking around to the front of the van where a large dent had caved in nearly the entire engine block.  Off to one side, a concrete pylon that had to weigh at least a few hundred pounds was sitting broken into three pieces.  He looked back at Steve, who was still holding the door panel, in confusion, then scanned the destruction around him. Slowly, Tony walked back over to where Steve stood.  It had clicked into place, though, not so much clicked as sort of settled over him, this terrible, wonderful realization.
“On a scale of one to I should move to Belize, how pissed is he?” Tony asked.  There was that sound again.  God, he was going to have nightmares.  “Did you know that New York City has more rats than people?”
Steve’s teeth ground together, but the jarring clack did have the benefit of biting back the retort that sprang to his lips.  He looked over at Tony, reclining in his chair with an air of disinterest that was belied by the tight grip he had on his goblet and the way his other hand curled around the arm of the chair so forcefully that Steve could see the whites of his knuckles.  Tony was not as indifferent as he wanted to seem.  Nor did Steve truly have his full attention, he realized, not when there was so much anger and pain clouding Tony’s mind.  He could, though.  Have Tony’s full attention.
“I know you didn’t,” Rhodey agreed, holding up a placating hand.  “I’m just saying what the charges are.”
. It was so bright and clear in his mind as he fell asleep, but when he woke the next morning, he was on the ground next to his pallet, his body tensed as if waiting for a blow, and the dirt in his mouth tasted like smoke.
, something could happen.  He ground his teeth together and shook his head in frustration as he dove back into the fray to engage a Doombot trying to make a bus into a battering ram.  Steve was giving orders, which the team was actually following, miracle of miracles, even Tony, because it would make Steve happy.  Well, he mostly listened anyway, so huge leap ahead, people, best to  focus on that.
“Yes,” Tony replied, drawing out the word.  “I think we can both acknowledge that I expressed a certain interest in showing my deep and abiding love for God and country—“
“After I made you feel like you had to,” Steve replied, mouth twisting around the words.  “I’m sorry, Tony.  I never meant to make you feel that way.  That’s the last thing I wanted.  And I’d never leave you, not in a million years, not unless you wanted me to.”
Steve released a shuddering breath, then closed his eyes let his head fall back against the cradle of Tony’s shoulder, both a surrender and a plea, because it was dark against his eyelids, and he wanted desperately for it to stay that way. He felt Tony shift behind him, the metal of the disc a sudden coolness against the heated skin of his back. Tony kissed the side of Steve’s head, hard and fierce, then moved the hand fisted over Steve’s heart down to cup the hard length of Steve’s cock, just holding it in his palm, warm and slick with the oil someone, probably Jarvis, Steve realized with a rush of embarrassment, kept atop a low candle by the bedside. It felt good, just to be held, touched like that.
“Here.  I made it for you,” Tony announced, holding the ring out to Steve.  It was large.  Bigger than the usual band, with a flat-silver titanium surface and a small, round chunk of etched metal sitting on the top the way a stone might.
“It was an unusual situation.  No one expected it.  Me, I mean.  To wake up like that.  And then you were there, and we were compatible, and it just happened.  Neither of us were prepared.  There were all the hormones and things got…kind of crazy.  But that’s just biology.  It doesn’t have to rule your life, Tony.  That’s not fair,” Steve continued.
“That is not what happened,” Steve said firmly.  “That is not what Zola meant. Tony, Zola is not who you think he is.”
Over his shoulder, Tony heard the familiar slide of a key ticking into the door lock and turned expectantly.  A moment later, the door open and Steve was there, all around him, enveloping him, and it felt so good, this solid wall he could sink into.  He took a shuddering breath and buried his head into Steve’s neck, where he could feel the heartbeat leap against his cheek.  A lingering kiss brushed across his forehead, and the arms that were holding him tightened.
“Perhaps he wishes to return to our furs” Steve suggested, then grinned. “It was a very pleasing evening.”
, Bucky’s voice sounded in his head.  Steve let out a sigh and allowed Cam to add circles of gold to his arms, though he balked at the ear cuffs with their delicate chains and glints of jewels.
“It was time,” Steve said at Tony’s incredulous look.   “Our allies know.  All the missions with SHIELD.  People will talk.  There will be pictures or video one of these days.  I kind of stand out. Thought it would be smart to get out in front of it.”
Only one person in the whole God-damned company had the brains to figure out something was off and the balls to do something about it.  He really needed to give Pepper a promotion.  Well, good news!  A CEO position is about to open up.  Sure, the company was teetering on collapse with the switch to clean energy, his employees’ retirement savings, heavily invested in SI stock, were slashed in half, the best and brightest were probably updating their resumes, and the Board, led by the nose by Obie, probably had a lawsuit already drawn up, but hey, every new opportunity has its challenges, Tony thought, somewhat hysterically.
The familiar walk to Tony’s chambers was largely barren, save for the guards outside his door and  a servant hurrying through one of the compound’s corridors with a stack of precariously-balanced trays in his hands, who jumped aside and bowed his head so as to lower his eyes as Steve passed.  When Steve reached the doors to Tony’s rooms, he hesitated, stomach clenching with nerves that he quickly pushed away.
“Welcome to the Stark International Exposition of nineteen-seventy-f—ugh,” Howard stopped and held up a hand in front of his face, blinking. “I told you the light’s too God-damned bright in here. It’s like fucking Christmas in here.  Who did this? You know they’re filming this, right?  I told you they were filming.  The network,” Howard said.  “This tie’s terrible,” he said, taking it in one hand and looking down.  “God, who even picked this—Maria! Can you? Damn it.  The brown with the—yeah, that one,” Howard said as he pulled the tie off with a whipping sound and snapped his fingers in the direction of a woman with light blonde hair who walked slowly over with a brown tie hanging from her fingertips.
“Oh,” Tony said, blinking at Steve.  “Well, that’s…that’s good, then.  Forget I said all that. Except any parts that were helpful with the opposite of second thoughts-having.”
“St—Steve.  Please, God, just—“ Tony stammered, the pleas ending in a nonsensical smash of letters and sounds.  It made Steve’s head swim a little, like everything in his mind was sliding off to one side, the way Tony could come apart so easily.
“So it shall be,” Tony vowed, voice low and quiet. Tony’s dark eyes were lit with the flickering light of the fire from the hearth, and Steve was suddenly conscious that they were both naked, his skin flush and warm, as much from Tony’s nearness as the fire.
“In a field battle? Six of these per thousand soldiers, two per regiment, I’d say. Arrange all of the artillery in each regiment into batteries, not spread out. Line formation. You sacrifice maneuverability, but it’s the best strategy for volley fire,” Steve said, the picture in his mind shifting, jumping forward, splitting into possibilities like threads on a web. “A loose line, better for maximizing firepower in one direction as you’d do in a field battle. You could fire probably four or five times the enemy’s volley without losing ground. Outflank the enemy’s guns with your cavalry. You’d have the advantage, even if you’re much outnumbered.”
“Exactly,” Tony answered, snapping a pointed finger in Steve’s direction.  “You were both adorable and annoying.  And you peed on me.  So, mostly the same, actually.”
Steve sighed.  Staying in bed, wrapped up with Tony all day sounded far more appealing than heading to the construction site.  He briefly considered calling in sick.  He never did that…he could take one day…but then his guilty conscience kicked in and he shifted out from under Tony’s hand to climb out of bed.  “I’ll probably be back before you have your second cup of coffee,” Steve said with a reassuring smile.
“You’ve truly never heard of anything that could cause those kinds of effects?” Tony pressed, his attention sharp on Bruce now.
“That doesn’t make sense,” Cam said with a slightly annoyed huff of air. “How can the pieces of something add up to more together than what they are apart? That is not how math works, Raj’Inama, this, I know.”
Steve’s hand stilled, and his eyes lifted to Tony’s.  “I’d like that,” Steve said, almost idly, like he was commenting on something mundane, but his gaze was sharp, dark and gleaming in the candlelight.  “I’d like that a lot, Tony.”
But, I will not be here for that, Steve reminded himself.  I should be paying attention to the comings and goings from the city, not pondering how to improve Tony’s defenses, Steve thought with a sigh, though his mind spiraled on.  The heat, he told himself, as he thought about the positioning of ready forces and longbowmen in the hills and steppes, back where the biggest menace seemed to be very determined goats.  Voices and the sound of hooves on hard sand sounded, and Steve turned to watch Tony and the others approach.
Tony let a pleased sigh slip out, then turned and wound his hands around Steve’s neck, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.
“Very well,” Tony agreed with a sigh, though he still sounded unconvinced.  He didn’t move.  Not right away, at least, just stayed there, running his hands over Steve’s skin for long minutes, until he finally heaved another long sigh and rolled out of bed and headed to the fireplace, where an iron pot hung over the embers.  He returned with a warm, wet cloth and wiped Steve clean, slowly, with an almost ritualistic care, rubbing the heated fabric into Steve’s skin in small circles as he did.  When he was done, he repeated the effort on his own torso, though far more perfunctorily.
“Ummhm,” Tony nodded affirmatively. “Pepper located her at a merchant’s in Bowerston.  She…Pepper said she wept when she told her she would be with her son,” Tony shook his head.  “Children are not supposed to be separated from their mothers until they come of age.  Cam is old enough, now, but, it still strikes me as too young…” he stopped and looked at Steve.  “A thought for another time,” he said.
“The cabin’s great. Really. It is,” Tony broke in over whatever else it was Steve was going to say.  “There’s a little pond with fish we don’t catch.  Steve likes to show them his collection of hooks, though, which I think is nice of him.  Gives them a bit of excitement.  Something to look forward to, with all that just swimming around, not being caught,” Tony continued with a nod.   Steve rolled his eyes heavenward and the corners of his mouth ticked up in a half-smile as he leaned back in his seat.  “I have my garage, with the ‘bots and all the stuff from Professor Thorne at Caltech—you saw the printouts, J, come on! All that data, and no one understands half of it. We’re just guessing. Educated guessing, but, it’s like cutting edge stuff! And Steve draws.  Or paints, sometimes, but not as much now.  Which is actually a good thing, but, ah.  Anyway, there’s a great view at night for my telescope.  It’s…nice.  The cabin, I mean.  I like it.  Here.  With the—in the cabin.”
. Don't worry about a stupid gland. But if you really wanted help figuring out where it is, I bet Gleason would know. I imagine he has to know that sort of stuff.  And at least you're
"You seem more excited and distractable than usual..." she observed suspiciously.  "I heard a crash downstairs. Is everything o--"
"It was dece."  Tony let Lydia lead the two of them through a back door into a bright white hallway, toward a pair of sleek silver elevators.
Steve shivered as Tony's question washed over him. He curled an arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him closer. He hummed quietly and nuzzled against his cheek.
"Let's go," said Sam, and a moment later, he'd unfolded a massive pair of metal wings and launched into the air.  Tony was dumbfounded; it took him a moment to follow.
Karpov was standing across the street from the hotel, his beret and military coat on, shoulders hunched against the cold.
). He left Pepper and Happy backstage, and dared the drone-filled arena outside. The crowd was manic. The main entrance had been blocked off by two tactical blasts to pillars. Steve rolled out of the way of a drone blast on stage and then slipped down, pushing through the panicking crowds towards one of the fallen pillars. Ugh, it looked heavy.
"After the fifth or sixth time you catch Tony choking himself with a belt and masturbating, you stop really noticing," said Pepper breezily.
"Irshad, I'm the president of the WORC." They shook hands too. It was all very formal.  Steve caught a small frown from Pierce and he wondered if SHIELD was unhappy with him for getting too "political."  As if he could help it.
Dr. Brennan listened to Steve with a smile.  "...I'm guessing you didn't see a lot of healthy trios in the thirties and forties," she said.  "...nowadays, it's not nearly as rare to see an omega as the father or at the head of a trio. I won't lie; it's not exactly common.  But it's certainly not taboo, either."
Steve woke lying on the floor.  Surprisingly, the floor was carpeted.  The room he was in had no windows and was lit with a soft, dim lamp.  It had the vibe of a therapy office and it was actually warm and pleasant.
"Love you too," Steve whispered, turning his head to press a kiss into Tony's hair before he let his own eyes slip shut.
"Just because he's guilty doesn't mean he knows anything," said Phil, unimpressed by Tony's theatrics.
. The heat inducer, his old mate and the fact that they wanted to use him to breed more super soldiers. None of this would be possible if he was a beta or an Alpha, would it?
"He talks to me like I'm a kid who doesn't understand anything. It's annoying. And yeah, his Alpha shot him...but DeSoto thinks it's okat because it's an accident. He's got me thinking...the stuff he said about Trickshot, that omegas can oppress each other just as bad. If I listened to what they all said to me here I would be one of them already," Steve sighed and flopped back onto the hood of the car they were sitting on.  "I got to speak to Donner more than I thought I would," Steve murmured, still sounding a little frustrated with himself. "But I can't get him out if he doesn't want out."
Pepper's head snapped up suddenly as if she's just remembered something.  "Steve," she said. "I have something I need to talk to you about. In private."  The photo and the dogtags were weighing heavy in her pocket. She'd been carrying them around, unsure of what to do.  Now that Steve was out of heat and it didn't seem like Bucky was invading his head anymore, she needed to give them back to their rightful owner.
"What?" asked Tony, who did not know how to talk to children and did not appreciate being called "mithter."
"What's that place where you cut off your hair and give it to kids with cancer?  They can have it.  Or... or maybe, uh, I don't know, uh, the... the World Wildlife Fund.  JARVIS!  JARVIS, I need you to update my will again."
The first hand began in the hundreds and rose to the thousands.  The second hand began in the thousands and rose to the tens. The third hand began in the tens and rose to the hundreds; Tony prompted lost four hundred thousand and found himself wondering, through a haze of martini, how in the fuck he was supposed to explain that to Pepper.  The most he had ever lost to gambling in one go was three million, and Pepper had been livid.
"It's fine. It's stupid. I knew it anyway, didn't I?" Steve said, not wanting to get one of his sour moods. Tony knew them well by now. When Steve got sad, he got quiet, sort of... forlorn. He'd spend way too much time drawing, or running, or sleeping. Then he'd shower it all away and pretend it never happened. But it was Tony's birthday and he was determined not to sulk. "Charlotte is right. It doesn't even matter."
"Steve's adoring fans needed to know," said Tony with fake seriousness.  He reached over and put his hands on Steve's shoulders, giving him a friendly little shake.  "Besides, if we waited to tell everyone, they would've found out.  At least this way we got to control the information.  Not
"Tony-" Steve squeezed his shoulder gently just as they were entering the witch’s house. "Tony, this is actually kinda- okay, it's scary. Tony, can you wake up?"
You could pick out the Alphas easily; they towered over the betas.  There was a guy in a bowler hat and an enviable mustache standing just behind Howard, and another one with a goatee and a beret on Steve's left, and the guy on the far right with a helmet and a bandolier and a jaunty grin.  Tony had noted, with some small sense of satisfaction, that Howard was the shortest Alpha.
"Steve. For your own sake. I would focus on the bond you have now, not the one you lost." David put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed gently. "It's been seventy years, hasn't it? That man is not the Barnes you knew."
"...setting fires?" repeated the director.  "Jesus Christ! Where the hell's Karpov?" He slammed the phone down and dialed.  The phone rang... and rang... and rang...
Happy did what Pepper couldn't; he stuffed the end of his shirt into Tony's mouth.  Tony let out a muffled growl, thrashing.  "I'm sorry, Mr. Stark," said Happy.
He was smiling a little, looking mischievous all over again. Steve leaned in to nip at his ear gently before murmuring. "I'm not as delicate as you think, Tony.  You can ask me for stuff.  What happened in Yemen was... shitty.  But we're still mates.  ...and I missed you."
As for the omega psychologist onscreen, though, Tony was intrigued.  He wondered if he could get Pepper to get him a meeting with her.  Maybe take an hour to talk to her about how omegas worked, try to make up for the last forty years of ignorance.
was going for a towel and had the decency to look embarrassed. "The last thing you need is a naked picture of the two of you in your pool Tony...."
he felt in that moment was impossible to articulate. He just shuddered against the sheets and arced up into Tony's touch, silently asking for more. Outside of his heat Steve didn't think he'd ever felt more vulnerable. But he trusted Tony, there was no question of it, it was as simple as breathing.
"You also don't wanna go into heat whilst he's going into labour," Aria pointed out bemusedly from where she'd started munching on the grapes they'd brought. "Everything okay, you two? You look... weird."
"Well, it makes sense that his brain would, wouldn't it?" snapped Tony, bristling a little.  "I thought the point of that exercise was to figure out why Steve's been mentally hunted by the Winter Soldier, not to remind him of all of his World War II survivor's guilt."
Tony put his hand over hers and tilted the decanter, pouring himself a drink.  He put one hand on his desk to steady himself and nursed the drink for a moment.
to trust him to always make the right decisions.  Being smart didn't mean he was good at long-term planning.  Rather, he tended to react to everything impulsively and emotionally and then use his intelligence to justify his decisions later.
Steve grunted. "I don't know. I feel kinda gross." He had Tony's dried semen all over his thighs. He didn't really remember last night all that well; he vaguely remembered them having sex and his nails digging into Tony's back as he pushed inside of him. But Tony had been totally out of it too, neither of them were really accountable--
?  I don't see a lot of indications that you're especially concerned with your own well-being."  She paused, then asked, quietly, "To what extent do you think growing up as an omega in the twenties and thirties has influenced that?"
Kate marched up to them. She didn't give a shit if she was treating Captain America or the goddamn queen of England. Kate was already
Tony didn't ask the question that was circling around his mind.  Had Steve said no? Had Steve actually tried to stop him? Or had he just sort of... let it happen?  And if he let it happen, why? Was it because he cared about Bucky? Because he'd given up on Tony taking him back?  Because, being an omega, he was incapable of saying no to a dominant Alpha who was acting as a protector to him?  Was it because of his heat?  Now that he wasn't in heat, shouldn't he be able to say, firmly, that he didn't want Barnes back in his life?
"Tell 'em to suck a dick," said Tony.  He was sitting cross-legged on his bed, a little pinball game in his hands.  Under the plastic there was a maze with three balls in it and the goal was to get all three into little slots at the same time.  Tony could get two but right when he got the third, one would roll out. He'd been at it for hours.
"I think we're doing good, Steve," said Tony wearily, who wasn't excited, really, because he was too hungry and tired and sore and cranky.
Dr. Brennan and Dr. Brazinski both looked at Steve pointedly.  Tony had just accidentally illustrated their point perfectly. Worse, it wasn't yet noon.
I did," Steve grimaced a little. "But I was dealing with a... a situation. You were arguing with Pepper. The fact that you were upset about her dating Happy wasn't so much what upset me; it was the more the fact that you thought that was the time to argue about it. When a trained assassin and super-soldier was on his way to kill you."
Tony wasn't sure why the hell they were meeting these people because, as he tried to point out, fruitlessly, he and Steve no longer worked for SHIELD or Fury.  Wisdom seemed thoroughly unconcerned. Maybe he knew something they didn't.
Maybe the anxiety wasn't his.  Maybe it was Steve's.  Steve looked genuinely worried and also a little incredulous that modern pregnancy tests worked.  Tony stroked his thumb on Steve's shoulder, waiting with him.
? I thought that might be nice, for when we take them off."  Steve leaned forward and kissed the edge of his jaw, smiling lightly. "Been looking into it a little bit, huh?" He teased gently. "I think it's cute that you're excited."
He knew he couldn't go with Steve on a jog outside.  He wouldn't be able to keep up.  He wondered if Steve was just going to be going around the estate-- Tony's Malibu mansion sat on almost three acres-- or whether Steve was going to leave the grounds and jog along the coast.  He gave Steve's fingers a quick squeeze back and followed Steve's gaze out the floor-to-ceiling windows.
Steve laughed quietly and moved aside holding the window open for Tony. He stepped out of the way, expression bemused as the suit clunked into his bedroom.  Tony shimmied awkwardly through the window, falling clumsily onto the floor.  All the natural grace of it was gone and replaced with the awkward bulkiness of heavy, metal limbs. "You're bossier when you're drunk," he told him, but his tone was fond.
The sunlight shimmered on the surface as ripples were created by his movement. The brilliant blue of the pool tiles just made him look more golden and the sun almost made him glow. He was certainly magnificent, but he was more than just what the serum had made him.
"Surely he should be the one worrying about that," Tiberius pointed out. "He did... well, you know."
...well, shit.  He'd been expecting a bunch of guys with guns that he could pummel.  Not people with extrasensory abilities.
Nick didn't say anything. He just continued to stare, his face unreadable. He'd never looked more intimidating.
Hey everyone. This update was one day late, because Tony ran the Los Angeles marathon on Sunday and he's feeling shit-tastic.  (Plus he's celebratorily drunk!)  (Is celebratorily a word?  ...it is now!) Thanks for your understanding!  - Sappho & Apollo
The song ended and they stepped back, not committing to another dance. Haley walked back and grabbed her (it could have easily not been hers at this point) wine up from the table. Steve didn't blame her. He couldn't imagine an auction was actually all that interesting. There was a flash of a camera somewhere; he did his best to ignore it.
"Hey, Sheriff--" Lawrence turned around. "--there's a doctor downstairs. She's the one's whose been... doing this to the kids.  Aiding, abetting.  She knows what they-- well, she needs to speak to the medical staff so they know how to proceed."
Tony had to admit, he liked Natasha in that moment.  Tony had always considered himself a libertarian, someone who was socially progressive but who felt government was inherently corrupting and that society was better off without any of the meddlesome agencies that tried to restrain it.
He picked up his phone and dialed, sitting on the edge of Steve's bed.  He thought about how he'd gotten the mugs, running a hand over his goatee thoughtfully.
"Don't worry, I'm sure they can airbrush out the bags under your eyes in the pictures," she reassured him.  Steve touched his face worriedly.  Was it that obvious he'd had a lousy night.
Then, suddenly, it hit him like a ton of bricks.  The picture on Steve's fridge, the man leaning out of a window, smoking.  The man with his shirt unbuttoned, the dog tags dangling from his neck.
Steve was a soldier but that was something Tony found easy to forget.  All week, they'd been lounging around, regular people.  Being reminded that he was a captain was a titillating thought; Tony could feel his body respond to it automatically.  Neither of them were looking down but Tony was pretty sure they were equally aware of the erection Steve was giving him.
After a thorough shower they got Donner to dress in a typical omega-style outfit; it was blue to match his eyes and just had a waistcoat instead of a jacket. He looked good in it, but when Donner looked in the mirror he felt nothing. Tom fussed over his hair whilst Chantelle talked with someone over the phone.
"It can't be fun, right? I imagine the Alphas who want someone who looks like Steve Rogers aren't the friendliest."
"Stark's been on probation for nearly three months.  Unlike you. Stark didn't steal a jet or beat up Sitwell, either.  Unlike you. Stark's biggest crime is being an asshole who got involved with this hot mess, and considering he's got more issues than a newstand, I can't say I blame him for that."
Steve curled against him quite contently, making sure to keep his hands away from Tony's arc reactor as he settled against his chest. "I'd love to," he hummed. "And I'm not bothered by assholes. In fact, I take a great a deal of pleasure in annoying them," he smiled as Tony flicked the TV on.
He never thought degrading language would turn him on either. Maybe it made Steve a bit of a hypocrite. But it was also not the worlds' business what Steve did or didn't like in bed, politics aside.
"No one's asking you to share anything Tony," Steve pointed out quietly. Bucky quite clearly wanted Tony dead too. There was no sharing to be had in any shape or form.
And the moment Steve had outgrown that he had abandoned his mate.  He felt plagued by guilt but didn't know if there was anything he could do to fix it.
. I'm fine, Tony." Steve rolled his eyes fondly. "But I don't know if my body would let me mate. It's so resistant to change. There's only one real way to find out what it will or won't do though, I guess," he shrugged.
"Stop being modest and just call Clint back," Aria told him and handed him with phone. Steve sighed with a tired smile. He leaned over to kiss Tony's forward and then went into the bedroom cabin at the back to call him back.
He checked his watch.  "We should see them soon.  They're going to go in first and clear it for us."
It was funny to see how huge Steve looked.  Tony had gotten so used to thinking of Steve as an omega that he often forgot how he looked in photos.  Appearances could be deceiving, but generally, Alphas were bigger, more muscled, than their counterparts; Steve looked
Tony grabbed his phone off his desk.  He wanted to look up honeymoons on Wikipedia real quick, just to make sure they were doing everything right.  And he was going to call Clint, too.  Finding out that Steve's fertility was high had been a nasty little surprise, and Tony wanted to avoid any more.
"...aren't you going to ask about whether or not the collar rumors are true?" asked Tony after a moment.
Donner slowly peeled away the last bits of paper from the water bottle.  "...where would you take me?" he asked in a low voice after a moment.
"Really proud of you, Steve," said Tiberius.  "And happy birthday." He pointed to the coffee table; there was a small collection of wrapped presents.  Among them, Steve spotted Pepper's small, neat handwriting (
"How bad is it?  Give it to me straight," said Tony, concentrating on helping Steve out of his uniform.
Bucky didn't seem to care.  "You went into my head. You made me think things.  I want you to do it again so I can feel him."
"You mean Project 84?  Yeah," said Tony. He propped himself up on his elbow.  "I talked to George about being there, at Zephyr Hill. To see if... you know.  Trickshot's there."
"He's sixth or seventh in line, if I recall correctly!" shouted Jameson, pausing outside the doors to a banquet hall.  "Well, here's where I'm leaving you, ladies! Behave yourselves! Come on, Stark, let's go! Don't worry about the omegas, they'll be fine..."
There was a gentle splash and Pepper glanced outside automatically. "Oh Lord," she muttered at seeing a very naked Steve. At least
Tony smiled slightly.  As a fellow troublemaker, he liked how Steve opposed authority.  He was a soldier, yes, but he marched to the beat of his own drum; Steve did things according to a personal value system and not simply because he was told what to do.  Tony liked that.
tell her I said that... but that Tijuana vasectomy was pretty sketchy..."  He lapsed into silence.  He'd been 19, and drunk, and had gotten it with encouragement from Obadiah.  It occurred to him, later in life, what a clever move it had been.  Tony's lifestyle was hopelessly reckless and if he died, Obadiah was poised to take over the company; the concern was that Tony would have an heir.  It was a ruthlessly calculating move and later, in his late twenties, Tony had found himself regretting the decision.
"Hm?" Steve blinked awake at the sound of their voices. He could feel a distant sense of panic throbbing in his chest. Was it Tony's? He frowned.  Pserhaps another nightmare? He wasn't sure. It didn't...it didn't
Tony brought Steve's hand up to his mouth and kissed his knuckles before giving him a little tug to keep walking.  He was wearing a leather jacket but he was still cold. He wanted to get back to the hotel, maybe get a Hot Toddy at the bar to warm up.  "...you gonna text Clint and tell him about his brother?" he asked, trying to change the subject. "Or should we wait? ...if the guy's... you know... not there after all, it'd be a pretty big let-down."
Steve groaned and threw his head back as he rocked back onto his alpha's cock, words completely lost to him. It didn't even hurt when Tony pressed inside. He was ready for him. He could take it. When Tony squeezed the knot in Steve whined low in his throat and nearly came right there and then. He didn't know how he managed not to.
Tony lasted a full twelve seconds post-knotting, which was, honestly, remarkably given the circumstances.  He thrust into his omega, hard and fast and sharp, and when he finally reached climax, he buried his cock, pumping his semen into the other, his mouth clamped firmly over Steve's neck, groaning low with the satisfaction of release.
"Probably trying to figure out how to work his GPS.  He was born in nineteen-eighteen, you know," said Tony.  Everyone chuckled.
"I'll turn up. Promise. I want these tracker things gone," Steve breathed. He moved to stand as the doctors went to leave.
Steve reached down to grab his shirt and pulled it on before slowly moving out of bed. And where had the bottle of wine come from? A question for another time. Steve smelled...nothing of note and frowned, hands flexing by his sides as he stepped into his living area--
"This man is trespassing, threatening, harassing, and stalking Donner Malick, who is now a client of Stark Industries... call the police.  We're suing," said Pepper.
Richards smiled tightly.  "Which is why we want you to go for 'round two,’ Captain, so we can try and work this out..."
He supposed it was a good thing, then, that they were going to see Ellis.  Maybe they could tackle some of those issues together.  Tony was pretty sure Pepper had some sort of formula for White House dinners.  30% business, 70% socializing?  Something like that.  He'd never paid it any attention; again, the open bars were
Tony set a hand on the table, offering it to Steve.  He didn't expect the omega to take it.  He wouldn't have, in Steve's position.  "Steve," he said.  "I am
"Did you have an okay day yesterday?" Steve asked tentatively, leading him into the bathroom before he moved to flick on the shower to get the water warming up. "I'm sorry I didn't really see you."
"Erm, Captain America?" She wasn't shy like Piper or Charlotte but she was still reserved. She looked at Steve's face when she spoke to him but kept her gaze on the floor the rest of the time. It looked like a learned behaviour. "I just-- I didn't think this would be your kind of scene."
"Maybe, if you stop objecting that poor stressed-to-hell woman with your Alpha gaze, I'll get you shrimp because God forbid you go get it yourself."
Steve, despite being big, or rather muscly, was especially light-footed. Of course, Natasha was far quieter than him, but then, that was her specialty. Steve's specialty, they joked, usually consisted of pissing people off; after all, he was provocative by nature. His military career had begun when he'd went on a rogue mission, to rescue troops who had been captured in Azzano in 1943, and since then, Steve had regularly defied orders when he felt it was right.
In his pocket, Steve's phone was chirping over and over as he received texts.  No doubt from Natasha.
a story that, like most television, featured mostly betas who didn't worry about things like status hierarchies or heat cycles or pair-bonding and could carry on with their normal, simple lives, doing things like cooking meth.
"Why not? I would have killed to go to college at your age," Steve said and he really would have done. If all these kids came from affluent families like Hal said then they could certainly afford it. He tried to get interviews at art schools, but every time he turned up and they smelt his status on him he was turned away. After the last one he'd broken down into a pool of frustrated tears and Bucky had rocked him on the couch until he'd fallen asleep.
Donner was staring at the floor. "Mr. Stark made Gideon real mad," he said and Steve immediately felt bad for it.
Aria cleared her throat. "You guys have been offered an interview. A joint one. Banksy has also offered and we know he's on our side, what with his involvement in Status Alliance. But I didn't know if you wanted to.  You guys need space; I'm not going to shove you out there if you're not ready. I've literally only come around to run a few things by you and then I'll be out of your hair."
Steve turned to face Tony. He didn't want to face the room. He had spotted Malick and his companion who looked like Steve; they were moving over towards the bar and in the process would go past them.
"...I'm glad you're home again," said Tony.  "...even if you come with a big crowd of protesters and Barton excludes me from your special little meetings.  I swear to God, Steve, if you come home with a special decoder ring or something, I will
"Although you are no longer employed by SHIELD, we do require that certain areas of confidentiality are maintained.  Such as your bond. We believe it is in the best interest of both of us to claim that your latest bond was an anonymous third party, as opposed to the Winter Soldier, or Barnes.  As of right now, only a select few within SHIELD know. We aim to keep it that way. However, we need your cooperation to maintain that story." Malick picked up his coffee cup and sipped it.
The man looked up at Tony, who carefully held his hand in front of his chest and rubbed his thumb over his forefinger in what he hoped was the universal symbol for ‘Play Along And I Will Pay You Cash Money.’
“Did he break a piece of furniture while doing it?” Tony asked.  Jim shook his head.  “Then you’re fine.  So.  I know you met with Steve already.  How’d that go?”
“Still sure you’ll best me, hmmm?” Tony asked, biting his lip and giving Steve a considering look. “Very well, I’ll send for you this afternoon, and we shall see.  Though, as I’ve warned you before, I’ve trained since I was a boy with the finest knights in the realm.  I think your overconfidence a tad misplaced, my soldier.”
The creature’s eyes were closed and its neck dipped back, face pointed at the morning sun.  It was strikingly beautiful in its own way. Steve could admit that now that he was fairly sure it wasn’t going to eat him, he thought with a smile.  It’s thick tentacles curled this way and that, a dark, mottled greyish-brown this morning, Steve saw, to match the rocks. Its chest was that of any other man, though tanned, and well defined, with a path of sparsely-haired muscle leading into its tentacled skirt. The blue stone necklace it always wore glinted in the sun, and it sometimes idly touched it, as if to make sure it was still there.
“I’m telling you the truth, Tony, I swear it. Question Zola’s guards who accompanied me, or Lord Hammer, if you must, though I don’t suppose they will tell you the truth now, but I tell you, that is what happened,” Steve replied.
“That good, Tony?” Conference Room Steve asked, pumping his fingers a few more times.  Tony nodded, eyes squeezed shut, one hand twined in Skinny Steve’s hair, the other curled into the grip of Helicarrier Steve’s glove.  “See?” he said, stretching up to brace a hand on the side of Tony’s head.  “We worked it out,” he husked out, dipping his mouth to Tony’s.  Tony leaned up, mouth seeking. His hands left the other Steves to wrap around this Steve’s neck, holding him there while the kiss deepened.
“Always,” Steve said softly, walking over to stand in front of Tony.  Tony slid his arms around Steve’s waist and pressed the side of his head into Steve’s shoulder.  “Always, Tony.  I promise.  You were really going to give up your dream project because you thought I might get hurt?”
“What’s it like? The whole…” Tony waved his hand towards the empty space where Natasha and Clint had disappeared. “Ignoring you thing? Kinda strange after all the completely deserved attention lately.”
“I want…I want another chance. For us.  I told you. I want us,” Tony pleaded.  He didn’t realize he’d done it, but he felt Steve’s hand warm around his and realized he was clutching it to his chest, tapping a beat for emphasis, fingers twining through Steve’s.  And, God, was there memory there, he thought, falling into the touch, the feel of Steve’s hand wrapped around his. He swallowed thickly and looked up at Steve’s face, awash in a weary sort of grief, carried for so long it could stretch over Steve like a second skin.
“Fine.  What am I looking at, exactly?” Tony asked as he held the new and improved binoculars up to his eyes.  The city sprawled out in front of him. Manhattan, then on, down to the Brooklyn Bridge and beyond, just like Rhodey said.
Steve sat down on the cot, keeping his expression carefully neutral.  He pushed the tattered blanket down and looked again at the wound he’d only gotten a quick look at earlier before deciding that wrapping it tightly would have to do until he found them some shelter.  Steve could see Tony’s eyes tracking his movements as he got the small pot of boiled snow and what passed for the cleanest strips of the lining of his uniform that he could find.  Steve dipped one of the strips into the warm water and tested it against the back of his wrist, then dabbed gently at Tony’s wound.  Tony let out a hiss of air, though he didn’t pull away again or otherwise object.
Tony had time to think the odd thought that the alien’s fingers were incredibly smooth, and then the creature closed its--his, whatever--eyes, and Tony felt the panic subside as suddenly as it had come, just like it had a moment ago, but far more intense.  It was if all the fear, the pain, the worry, every horrible scenario playing out in his head was just gone. Sucked out of him. A sense of peace filled him. Serenity. Safety. Then, unfettered joy, like the first time he took the suit flying, but not quite that, and somehow, that feeling was different than the others, but still comforting in its own way.  He felt himself relax, deep breaths filling his lungs as he stared up at the alien above him until brilliant blue eyes snapped open again.
“See?  I told you that you would enjoy yourself if you just gave it a chance!” Maria replied from somewhere in the background of the silent conversation he and Steve were having.   “What else are you up to at that house of yours?  Jarvis tells me it’s quite, er…quaint.”
The outside of the carriage was elaborately carved and painted in bright colors, with gilded lilies topping the four points of the roof and the King’s own crest over the back.  Inside, it was even more sumptuous, with soft, cushioned benches on opposite sides, which could be pulled out to form a large bed - should Steve get tired - silk-lined walls, and numerous compartments, many cleverly hidden to allow enough space for the occupants to move around.  A table folded out from under the window opposite the door, then cleverly secured in place again.
Steve’s head felt full and heavy as they walked back to their rooms, as if what he had learned came with a solid weight.  He couldn’t quite make sense of it all.  Each question that formed in his mind seemed to fork into even more questions and few ended in answers.   Cam ordered food for them and then disappeared to his room while Steve ate alone on the balcony, watching the sun go down and mentally tallying the guards on duty.  He heard Cam clear his throat from behind him and turned.
“I mean, I get it, I’m saying.  It’s fine.  You’re, you know.   You.  And all.  And I’m…I mean, you didn’t want this.  Me.  SHIELD freaked when you were, justifiably!  Maybe kind of not all with it after the whole, uh…ice thing, and their solution was, let’s face it, not the best. I’m glad I helped a bit.  You’re better, and that’s great.  It’s great.  Of course, it’s great.  Everyone…everyone wants you better.  So.  Yay for getting better, right?  Sending me away, it’s good.  Good compromise. MIT.  Yeah.  That’ll be…it’ll be amazing,” Tony choked out the last part of the word, so garbled it was barely a word.
A rush of shame twisted through Steve’s gut that he tried to ignore.  It was one thing to have it happen. It was another thing to have it said out loud.  He let out a sigh and ran a hand through his hair, mouth flattening as he looked out towards the flashing skyline.   “He probably just lost track of time.  He does that sometimes.  And there aren’t any clocks here, so…” Steve trailed off, shrugging his shoulders a bit.
“You’re standing in a dilapidated building you’re about to own, in the closet-sized apartment equivalent of Three Mile Island and a rat that is likely drunk and/or high based upon the foraging available in this place is probably going to chew your toe off tonight, all to win back the man you’re still technically maybe married to,” Pepper reeled off.
They rode into the long, shaded corridor of the stables, coming to a halt in the middle, where the ceiling opened to give light and air. The leather creaked underneath him as he slid out of the saddle, the hard earth under his feet jolting his muscles. He could feel the pain and stiffness that had settled in some leagues ago, then disappeared with the anticipation of the ride here, snap into wakefulness seemingly all at once. Steve realized he was still clutching the reins in one hand and forced himself to release them, giving the horse a pat on the neck as he did.
“We’ll think of something, Tony,” Steve said, hefting Tony closer to his chest and leaning down to press a kiss to the top of Tony’s head.  “You’re fixating on the name,” Steve said with a slight smile.
For most of human history, soulmates had been the stuff of fairy tales anyway, drifting between legend and romanticized fantasy. Fuck, when you had a life expectancy of thirty or so years, it wasn’t like you could hold out for finding your soulmate. Matchmakers could supposedly help find someone compatible, or that was how they billed it anyway, until technology replaced the village witch throwing stones and chicken bones in the dirt and trading divination for your prized cow.
“Keep your hands at your sides. Now, open your mouth for me,” Tony commanded.  Steve let his mouth fall open.  “Good,” Tony praised, his voice light. Steve waited patiently for the familiar taste of Tony’s cock sliding past his lips and settling on his tongue.  Steve wasn’t expecting the sweet taste of a plump, honeyed date to fill his mouth, and almost drew back in surprise.  “Now. Chew,” Tony said around a laugh, as if he knew what Steve had been thinking. He probably did, Steve thought as he chewed.  The date was delicious. He had eaten them before, but this one was fantastic. The sweet flavor filled his mouth as he chewed the fleshy fruit.  Tony hummed thoughtfully as Steve swallowed, and a moment later, he felt the hard edge of a goblet at his lips and drank a few sips of watered wine before Tony took it away.
To the side, Jarvis crawled out of the water, but stood there, half-in, half-out, clinging to the wooden rails of the ladder as if for support.  He was hunched over, shoulders shaking and head bowed all the way down to his chest.
“A worthy goal, Your Highness. May it come to pass,” the Ul said, dipping his head just enough to be respectful, Steve noticed.
“You’re sure?” Steve asked, prodding carefully at the spot on Tony’s forehead, just below his hairline.
“Hand to God, I am definitely letting Rhodey arrange all my fake marriages from here on out. Definitely could not have done better myself,” Tony finished with a too-bright smile.  Steve’s mouth lifted into a smile in return, but he dropped his gaze to his lap, where his hand rested with the ring on it, and then squinted up at the horizon.  I’m such a coward, Tony thought, letting his eyes shut for a brief moment and giving his head a little shake.  He was such a fucking coward.
“Ty will be here.  In the tourney tomorrow,” Tony husked out, staring up at the canopy above them where deer and pheasants frolicked amidst the swirls of damask.
“I’ll never get him out of that uniform, I swear,” Sugar replied.  “He keeps putting it off, one crisis and then another that, oh, just can’t be solved without him, you know.  Not that I want him poking around the house all day.”
“You did?” Tony asked, absurdly pleased by the thought. “Well, won’t hurt to hear it again.” Steve sighed, but didn’t protest further as Jarvis read through the Time Magazine article. Tony gently massaged Steve’s lower back and thighs, then up and down the curve of Steve’s spine until the muscles went lax under his ministrations. Steve hummed appreciatively as Tony handed him a pillow for his head.
The insanely hot guy standing in front of him thought he was here for paid-for sex. And was saying no.
Tony winced and had to physically make himself not roll his eyes, though Gomer Pyle here seemed to buy it.  In fact, the guard was frowning, looking between Tony and the tags in his hands, like he was weighing his options.  Tony’s eyes flicked to the tags in the guard’s hand.  It was all he could do not to yank them back.
“Oh, hey, you that lawyer guy?” a voice called out from across the hall. Tony turned and realized that Steve’s neighbor was standing in his doorway, holding a Big Gulp cup that appeared to contain something a little more than just slurpee by the way the guy's words came out slurry and thick-tongued.
It went on like that until Cam, courtesy of Tony, had most of Steve’s pieces lined up in front of him, with only Steve’s Bishop, a Pawn, the King and Queen still in play, though he was left unable to move his King without putting the piece in check.
The problem was, Tony had finished a race he didn’t know he’d been running, and Steve was supposed to be here waiting for him to catch up, except Steve didn’t even know he’d signed up to run.  It was frustrating as hell.
He stopped at the workshop’s threshold and watched Tony pull the fire-bright metal out of the forge, pick up a flat-faced mallet and hammer it until sparks flew.  When he was satisfied, he dropped it into a bucket of cool water, sending a cloud of steam into the air.  Something stirred in Steve’s chest, reaching, trying to claw its way out.  He hadn’t quite realized until this moment just how much he had missed Tony.  The deep aching wound inside, that part of him that he kept trying to weave together with hands covered in blood, it was less in here, somehow.  Easier. Lighter.  A few moments ago, he would have sworn it was because in here, he didn’t have to think, didn’t have to be himself, could let go, but it didn’t feel like letting go, seeing Tony there.  It didn’t feel like less of himself.  He hadn’t felt this alive since he watched Bucky fall.  Maybe before that.  He couldn’t remember, not for certain, except that each breath in here wasn’t a burden, and that was saying something.
“A welcome distraction,” Stark replied, shrugging a bit and shoving his hands back into his pockets. His voice was a bit softer than when he spoke to Brock, or so it seemed, though Steve supposed that could be the wind.
Tony stood up and walked to the center of the cell, listening.  Yep.  There was a thump.  A louder thump.  Some kind of crunching sound.  Well, that couldn’t be good.
“I—yes,” Tony replied.  She raised her eyebrow again and took a sip of sherry.  “I am.  Really. Steve, he’s…” All the things that Steve was sat there on the tip of his tongue.   Kind. Smart.  Different kind of smart than Tony, but fiercely brilliant, Tony knew.  Funny, when you knew how to read him.  A good man.  That was a trite turn of phrase, but Tony thought it may have never been more true than when applied to Steve.  None of that really told her much of anything, though.  It wasn’t what she cared about.  “I’m in love with him,” Tony said instead.  His throat clicked as he swallowed and dropped his head, one hand coming up to rub at the bridge of his nose.  “I didn’t mean to.”
, Tony thought in his mother’s pleading voice, where it didn’t sound quite like an accusation, the way it did when his father said it.   He’d managed to drive away the few Alphas who had come sniffing around by simply being himself.  Then his first Heat hit, and him with no Alpha, you’d have thought he had blowtorched a puppy by the way his parents reacted.  Not his fault his body was done playing nice.
that would feel.  Tony wet his lips.  A line of slick seeped out of him, dripping down between his thighs.  He wondered if Steve would be able to smell it when he got home. Tony liked to think he would.  That Steve would come home and find the air thick with Tony’s arousal and know how much Tony needed him.  A few strokes, just a few, and he could take the edge off. Who knew how long it would actually take Steve to get home?  Traffic.  One of Coulson’s precious forms.  Cat up a tree.  You never knew. Anything could delay him.
“We done here?” Rumlow asked.  Steve didn’t turn around.  He kept his eyes on the slump of a man at his feet.
He wondered what Clint would think of it, high up as it was and offering such an incredible vantage.  He wondered if he would ever get to tell Clint about it, or if this whole plan was doomed to failure. He wondered which outcome he really wanted, though he didn’t let himself try to answer that question.  He had been asking the wrong questions for a long time, and he was done with that now. His decision had been cast a long time ago, really. It just took him awhile to realize it.
.  Diminished, Tony’s mind supplied.  It had once seemed so big, so full of the impossible, this world outside.  Now…now, he didn’t know what it was.  It wasn’t the world that had changed, he knew, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of wrongness.  He didn’t belong here.  He never had.
“Hey,” Tony called out, waving his hand back and forth in front of him before shoving it into the pocket of his pants.  “Good to see you.”   The ‘finally’ was silent, but Tony felt it was strongly implied.
“You are fortunate I could swim,” Steve pointed out, shooting Tony a rueful look before going back to focusing on their surroundings for want of focusing on other things he could do little about.
Tony lifted his head enough to look at the door, steadfastly ajar. He wished Steve would just get it over with. Okay, that wasn't true. But, it was a good lie to tell himself, he supposed, as lying to yourself went. Lie back and think of the garage, he told himself with a semi-hysterical bubble of laughter. How many times had he let his mind fill with numbers and machines, beautiful machines that could be more real than whatever was happening to him if he let them. He could do this. It was just sex. People did it all the time. Omegas were made for this, right? It was what his body was supposed to do. Take his Alpha's knot. How bad could it be?
Okay, that last one wasn’t one-hundred percent accurate, but he had put the dishes away, done the laundry, and vacuumed the floors.
“I remember,” Tony nodded.  “You were worried about him.  Nervous, I could tell.  That he would mess up, I assumed.  Spill wine on Obie’s coat front or some such.”
It was fireworks, bursting in Tony’s chest, a molten coil straight down to his groin.  It was slow-dancing on the roof without any music, the languid wake of morning when the bed is still warm, the first rise over the top of the coaster when the clacks just start picking up speed, the last piece of an equation after the equal sign, the eureka moment when something worked, the way the sun breaks across the sky when you’ve stayed up all night to wait for dawn.
“Great,” Steve replied, though the word lacked any semblance of actually sounding like he thought it was great. He was standing there, staring at the glass doors to the suite, head down and jaw set, looking for all the world like moving was the last thing he wanted to do.
“I can't, Tony. I can't wait around for you to figure out that you had it right all those years ago. We're from totally different worlds. We got nothing in common. What are we going to say to each other to make up for that?” Steve questioned softly. “You're you, and I'm...I'm not what you need. You—right now, you feel guilty or, I don't know, maybe you want to get back at your Dad or prove something, but...you're going to think this through and, eventually, you're going to see it. I just can't stick around while you do. I can't do that again. Please don't ask it of me. Please, Tony. I can't.”
Why had he thought she would be impressed?  He couldn’t remember.  But, he remembered the eclipse, watching the sun disappear and the world go dark through the pinhole, Jarvis at his side.  The way it seemed wonderful and terrible at the same time.  How big the universe felt in that moment.
“I’m not sure what it says about my life that I find that incredibly romantic,” Tony grumbled into the cocoon of Steve’s chest. He felt Steve vibrate with a low laugh at that.
It took him a minute to figure out the door, which melded seamlessly into the wall as far as Tony could tell.  But, when he walked to just the right spot, it opened, revealing a short corridor that opened onto a large room with a huge, rounded window with a starfield behind it.  A series of panels covered the walls. Chairs, or what Tony would call chairs, hung from the ceiling in hook-like curves. There were stations that appeared to be for others to use, though they all sat empty now.
“Sorry. Sorry, I know I’m—look,  Tony, I’m not used to…this. Whatever this is.  Dating, I guess.  Last time I stepped out with someone I really liked, I think her mom drove us,” Steve said mildly, then smiled, shaking his head a little. That was good, Tony thought.  Nervousness, he could work with.
“Ah, Tony,” Steve sighed, dropping his head back against the table with a dull thunk and letting his eyes shut against the lights overhead.
“Well. Thanks for the science lesson+, Tony.  That was...clarifying.  So, ah, did you—if you’re done—did you want to watch a movie?  Or, if you’re tired, maybe some other time,” Steve offered.
Well, deflector shields to maximum, Tony supposed.  They all knew it was Tony who had been the holdout, but it wasn’t like his mom could complain now.  National security turned out to be the one thing that could trump the Mom Guilt Card.  Who knew?
—contributed to it?  And, look, I’m not saying I did or didn’t punch Stern in his fat face, but if I did, I think anyone from Vegas can tell you he had it coming,” Tony said, punctuating the last by spreading his hands wide and arching his eyebrows while the room tittered with nervous, but not disagreeing, laughter.  “But, look, say what you will about all of that. Hell, say something about trauma and how it affects people, if you want. Write about that. But, marrying Steve is the least crazy thing I’ve done,” Tony said. “And if you suggest again that it was anything else, I’m not going to be responsible for my actions.”
“Well—yeah, but—I mean, technically, he wasn’t even a terrorist, not really,” Tony sputtered.  “Look, I know that was…not the best idea I’ve had.  I got that around the time they blew my house to dust with me and Pepper still in it, okay? I don’t need a lecture on how much I screwed up.  I handled it, alright?  Not all of us are—we can’t all be perfect all the time,” Tony finished, surprised to hear his voice rising with a sudden wash of anger, though he probably shouldn’t be.  It was always so close to the surface with Cap, a potent, bubbling concoction of disappointment, self-flagellation and impossible expectations.  Quite frankly, the very last thing on his list of Things He Wanted to Hear From Steve was a discourse on how he’d fucked up Heroing 101, first with the Expo and Hammer, that weaselly little shit, and then Killian and that whole debacle.  How had this gone from a tour to pin the flaw on Tony time?
“Ah, this must be the famed Raj’Inama,” the man next to Tony said as he approached the opposite side of the table.
Cigars and Scotch.  Loud laughter that carried no hint of warmth.  Him and people like Stern and others who came into the club looking for a cheap thrill and a place to do business that couldn’t see the light of day.  Big hands. Terrible tips. He wondered if Stane remembered him. Probably not, he thought, though there was something there in his eyes when he deigned to look at Steve that made Steve rethink.
“You have,” Fury acknowledged with a slight nod. “And exactly how close are you to telling me, telling SHIELD and the rest of whoever wants to try to put some reins on you to go pound sand, huh?” he asked. “Sit down.  Please. I’m not your enemy, Captain,” Fury said in an urgent, frustrated tone. His voice sounded louder, no longer a tinny whisper Steve could barely hear. The pulsing throb in his head had lessened somewhat, though he couldn’t quite make himself relax his fists. Fight, flight, it was always a fight, he thought, then tried to focus on what Fury was saying.  Finally, Steve sat back down and watched the line of tension ease out of Fury’s shoulders. He noticed the man’s hand slide out from under his desk. Smart man, Steve thought grimly.
Tony huffed out a low laugh. “I assured him you would be fine. He was worried. I might have promised him a camel. I don’t know.”
“Technically, those were included with your purchase.  Probably not twenty at a time, but there wasn’t a rule against it,” Steve reminded him.
Steve nodded.  They walked out of the building into the night.  It was nearly dark already and the lamps were lit, casting golden halos on the ground across from storefronts blazing with fluorescent light and neon signs.  Steve couldn’t stop smiling down at Tony.  “What are you going to do with that?” he asked as they stepped down onto the wide sidewalk.
“Aww, did your daddy not love you enough as a child, Barnes?  Do you need a hug?” Phillips demanded. “Move it.”
Not going to lie, though, Tony thought, fingers plucking at the delicate, lavender fabric where it shimmered over his thighs.  He loved Steve’s big, beautiful, glorious cock, too.  Long, thick and curved ever so slightly to the left when he was fully erect, the long, wide vein pulsing down to the head.  Uncut, unlike Tony’s, which Tony found sinfully fascinating, much to Steve’s occasional amusement and, quite often, very much to his enjoyment.  He loved how much it stretched him whenever Steve took him. Even with as much time as Steve usually took to get him prepared, whenever Steve pushed into him, there was always that moment of burning stretch when Tony could barely swallow, and it felt like it was impossible, and then it wasn’t, and his body opened for Steve, all slick and so tight around Steve’s cock, like he was made just for that, just for Steve.
“I burned it. His instructions,” Bruce said quickly, nodding at Tony. “Don’t worry, your secret’s safe,” he sighed.  “I
Steve said it would be okay. Maybe.  Maybe, he could salvage things. What choice did he have?  Please, he thought to himself, please let it be okay. Just this once. It’s all I’ll ask.  He wasn’t even sure who he was asking. Some deity, Steve, the dead soldiers whose blood he could never quite get off his hands.
“I’m fine,” Steve responded stiffly, staring at the glittering panorama without really seeing anything, as far as Tony could tell.
He scrubbed the rest of the shampoo out of his hair and let the water sluice over his face, before shaking his head back and reaching blindly for the soap.  It was the green one with Irish Spring written across the top that Steve used, though now the words were roughened down by use to just a slight indentation.
“Nomadic tribes who live on the outskirts of the Ring,” Tony replied dismissively, shaking his head. “A huge, circular crater to the northeast, not too far from the Gate, though the terrain is all but impassable. Quite impressive from what I’ve heard, though the whole area is a barren wasteland. I can’t imagine why they cling to it other than superstition,” he explained at Steve’s blank look. “They scour the desert for plunder and pick off caravans who try to take the faster route and forgo paying for the privilege of the Ul’s protection. Little more than a nuisance, really. Certainly nothing for Rhodey to worry about.”
Steve heard in Bucky’s voice in his head, though Bucky had never actually said that to him. He swallowed the words back this time.  What did he care what this man thought of him? Or Brock? What did it matter?
“You’re kidding?  He’s kidding, right?  A lawyer?  Really?” Rhodey demanded, looking between Tony and Pepper.  Pepper’s mouth twisted into a frown, while Tony took a big bite of cheeseburger and leaned back against the edge of the workstation.  “Jets, Tony.  Please?  Just one?”
“I wasn't even supposed to be there. Though, that right there told me something was up with the op. They pulled us--my team, I mean--and put a bunch of green-eared grunts on your detail, which was strange enough at the time. I thought maybe you'd complained or, well, I'd had a bit of a run-in with the base commander," Steve said with a shake of his head.
.  Steve was suddenly in front of Tony, all shoulders and hands and bulk, standing between Tony and everything else.  The tension he’d been carrying drained from Tony’s body all at once, leaving him shaking as he careened into Steve’s arms.  “Tony, baby…it’s okay.  I’m here, I’ve got you,” Steve murmured into his hair, arms wrapping around him and pulling him even tighter against his chest.  “Are you alright? Are you hurt?  Who did this to you?”
Microrobots, like the one in Steve's ring, are a real thing!  MIT is very involved in this and I took the particular design of the microrobot from the design described in an article about a MIT professors work with microrobotics.
Another. He stopped counting.  Floated. A memory of his mother playing the piano came to mind.  His favorite song. He could listen to her for hours, just playing that same song.  Howard said it was the only time he could be still. He was still now, though. Still and held.  Complete. Happy, looking at Pepper, as he took her hand to help her out of the car. An alien face he didn’t recognize, but trusted and loved and missed,
Tony ran a hand through his hair and pushed his chair away from the worktable. He grabbed his coffee mug and made his way out of his workshop to the Tower’s elevator, hitting the button that would take him to Bruce’s floor. By the time the doors slid open, he had almost convinced himself he was on his own snipe hunt, but he wasn’t going to get any work done, that much was obvious, and if anyone knew more about this stuff, it was Bruce.
Steve sighed and rubbed at the bridge of his nose to loosen the furrowed ridges of his brow.   Tony needed him to do this thing for a few days, keep it professional, keep a respectful distance without getting emotionally involved, like he should be able to do, given what he did for a living, not trail after him like a lost puppy who needed a pat on the head.
answered, Tony noticed, turning back to look at their blurry reflections in the metal of the elevator doors. He had no idea what to make of it.
“We started here,” Tony said.  “Our life. It was supposed to start here.  We have the pictures to prove it.  Both of us, we kept them, hung on to that.  I don’t think we could quite let it go, you know?  We can’t go back, I know that.  But…I just thought, this is how we should start it this time, too.  Except, we do it right.  The way it was supposed to be.”
He liked it well enough.  As well as he liked anything these days.  The cabin, with its cursed painting, empty medicine cabinet and well-stocked pond.  It was…not SHIELD, with its brightly-lit corridors and sleek screens filled with information and the pills they kept wanting him to take that didn’t do anything, though he took them and gave the little paper cup back to the doctor each time with a smile that seemed to make the doctor feel better.  Everything about this place was the opposite of SHIELD.  Inverted, Steve thought, feeling his gut clench.
Steve grunted and released Tony enough to roll over and pull the drawer out.  Apparently a little too hard, because the whole thing came out in his hand. He looked over at Tony.  “Oops,” Steve said, then plucked the tube of lube out and unceremoniously dropped the drawer, along with the rest of its contents, onto the floor.
“I believe I saw your father on my way across the bridge.  He appeared to be heading towards Gulleytown, perhaps looking for you?” the man said, his voice kind and surprisingly gentle.
Tony, face-down on the couch, reached up and made a non-committal hand-waving motion.  "...I need a drink..."
.  Is that it?  That sounds right.  ...no, but seriously, you didn't hook up with anyone, right, because I kind of, you know, won you... from Justin... not that I'm saying anyone owns you, because, you know, omega rights and blah blah blah..."
The moment the jet was on the group and the back hatch was opened, they were swarmed with a team in SWAT gear holding loaded weapons, plus EMTs, plus, perhaps more frightening than either, Director Fury.  Trailing behind him was Maria Hill, Vice President Rodriguez, and a woman from the World Security Council.
"It's a huge,  life-changing decision," Danielle hummed, smoothly cutting in. "Sometimes people don't make the right decision for them because of societal pressures. It's about giving people a safe space to ensure that doesn't happen."
Perhaps "women" was hyperbole.  She was more likely a teenager, but her expression was an adult's and there were dark circles under her eyes that made her appear older initially.
With every passing second he was becoming frantic.  He'd failed his objective.  He was pretty sure that his target, the one-eyed man, was alive and also that the other guy hadn't been captured and now they had taken his handler and he was alone in the world, and everything looked so unfamiliar and strange to him.
"Got this," repeated Tony, giving Steve a wink.  He felt a pang of worry from Steve but he ignored it.  The day was nearly over and so far he was pretty sure he was
Pepper tapped her finger to her lips and shook her head.  "No, too cloying. Dial it back," she commanded. "You're at a nine, I need you at a six or seven."
"Now, Tina-" the presenter turned to the activist. "Do you think progress will actually come out of this? Do you think Captain America has the chance to cause real change or will the hype will die down?"
"Nope," Agent May said and walked behind Tony so Steve could see her face as they headed to the exit. Pepper went out first, slipping through the gap in the pillars Steve had made earlier. "You do need to go to the hospital, though, for the record."
"...you know, I don't really like it when things happen before noon.  Why does he always have to do crap like this before noon?" muttered Tony, clicking the video and wandering toward the kitchen as the baby he considered defective stopped flailing and began crying.
Steve was halfway through typing in the words 'blai-' when Tony said those three simple words. He blinked in surprise and something fluttered in his chest as he watched Tony's lips move over his hand...exploring. He felt his cheeks turn pink again but for an entirely different reason than they did before.
He reached out and pulled Steve into an embrace, nuzzling the top of his head, the soft blond hair.  "My omega... my sweet fuckin' omega, God, I missed you..." he murmured into Steve's hair, holding him.  It was impossible stay mad at Steve, even when he was acting like a brat.
Then again, he hadn't been able to picture Steve shirtless with an America flag painted across his abs, and he'd seen
"I don't know, but if I were you, I'd beef up my security protocols," said Rhodes.  "I'm gonna take this tag to Edwards and see if they can get any information from it."
Two rooftops away, the girl was standing on the edge, her hair billowing around her, and the asset felt his blood run cold because even from here, he could feel the heat of her fury.  She'd seen the knife, seen the blood.
"You know, you really make it far too easy." The voice was crisp and lightly accented. Steve instantly didn't like it. "'Megas in battle. It's stupid. All it takes is one little heat inducer and pop! You're useless."  He kept the grenade launcher trained on them, a second, smaller gun slung over his shoulder. "The funniest part is I'm going to run away from all this and there's nothing you can do to stop me."
Steve's eyes flicked out automatically, respectfully.  Tony's heart ached. He leaned down to kiss Steve's forehead before nudging himself against Steve's entrance.  Wet and warm as ever. Tony let out a shuddery hiss as he slid his length in, finding a slow, gentle rhythm. He settled his body over Steve's, wrapping his arms around him, the earlier betrayal already forgiven.
"Maybe there's like a home...for the omegas whose rich Alphas reject them, or something like that. Somewhere where they're cared for but hidden away," Steve suggested. Before this he would have thought such a thing was ridiculous but now he wouldn't put it past any of them.
Tony put his hand over Steve's on the lever.  "You could drink straight ethanol," he said.  His tone was serious.
He could not even say how long he'd been here.  No food, only a little water, virtually no sleep.  He could have already been here for days, for all he knew.  He was shaky from hunger and his ankle was not doing any better.  Trying to push Bucky away was proving difficult even for him.
The soldier felt like he might be experiencing it now and it unsettled him.  He was a soldier; he couldn't be bonded; he wasn't allowed; there was no place in his life for an omega; it was forbidden.  Yet the more he breathed and watched the blond, the more and more he felt a connection, one he'd only ever known with Karpov.
Ah, fuck me, I like him, Tony thought, a cold, tingling sensation spiking down his back and settling in his chest.
Steve released Tony long enough to grab for the bag, pulling out a finely woven blanket, embroidered with Tony’s crest, which Tony snatched from his hands and threw to the ground before Steve could protest. Tony kicked at the blanket’s corners, spreading it out unevenly over the soft sand that sank into the shallows of the pool.  Steve fumbled a hand into the bag, fingers curling around a jar, only to drop it and the bag when Tony pushed up against him, lining their cocks up and thrusting his hips forward, rubbing their lengths together.  It reminded Steve of their first night together, and he didn’t think it was an accident on Tony’s part.  This was as much a first time as that had been, in a far different way.  He reached out again and pulled Tony to him, covering Tony’s mouth with his own.  It wasn’t his best effort, all teeth and tongue and need bubbling over, but he wasn’t sure how he was supposed to think with Tony canting his hips against him, grazing over-sensitized skin there almost painfully.
“You had something else in mind?” Tony asked as he clicked a few shots on the camera, checking the digital display after each one.  “Friday, lower the lighting five percent.”
“No hospital,” Tony protested.  “Steve,” he said, more urgently, pulling one of Steve’s hands to the center of his chest and watching something like anguish flash across Steve’s stricken face as he looked down at Tony, cradled against the curve of his body in a bough of sand. Steve’s hand open and closed over the reactor spasmodically, and for a second, panic coursed through him like a current, his body jerking away in response, leaving Steve’s hand hanging in midair between them.  “No hospital,” Tony repeated, risking a glance up at Steve’s ashen face.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” the King said agreeably.  He swept a hand through Steve’s hair, then down his cheek, tilting his head to one side as he studied Steve.
Outside, a storm was blowing down from the mountains. A big one, with billowing clouds and peals of thunder heralding its arrival, bringing with it the kind of cold, wet rain that got into your skin.  It was going to be one of those nights, Steve figured, tugging the quilt a bit tighter around his shoulders.  He probably wouldn’t sleep all that well, what with the wet cold settling into his bones and his stomach acting up again.  He hadn’t been sleeping well lately, anyway.  Kept waking up in the middle of the night, trying to remember something he was sure he had forgotten, and unable to. Which, of course, meant his bladder was going to be insistent, so then he was awake and might as well stay awake, at least according to his body.
“How could you think that?  You were always the best thing that ever happened to me.  Even when it hurt.  I wouldn’t have traded any of it.  Not a second, Tony, not for anything,” Steve said, looking over at Tony with a soft, urgent gaze.
“I…do not mean to be melancholy,” Steve said, dropping his gaze down to where their hands were linked in the center of Tony’s chest.  He wasn’t sure what else to say.  He didn’t even know what he wanted to say.  Tony’s offer was still rebounding through his head, and nothing seemed to want to make sense anymore. Tony seemed to have followed his look and squeezed Steve’s hand.
He was probably going to end up there. His skin crawled at the thought, and he shook his head, trying to clear it.  If it came to that, so be it.  He should’ve been dead a long time ago.
Captain Rogers wanted to see Tony by himself, so, apparently, that was what was going to happen, and Howard could just take a fucking seat.  Tony would be gleeful if he wasn’t currently going with Option B, terrified.
“We’re...on our way to the Grand Canyon in your helicopter and you want to talk about how the military’s intelligence gathering is hampered by the digital divide?” Steve asked.
He shouldn’t have slept.  His body was alight, his mind full and his cock half-hard. He shouldn’t have slept, but he had, miraculously, dropping off some cliff inside his mind into a dreamless slumber.   Perhaps it was a soldier’s ability to take sleep where it could be found, but his skin grew warm from the fire that was stoked in the hearth and his eyes grew heavy.
“Thanks again for letting me meet DUM-E and U,” Steve said after the car pulled off their private road and onto the highway.  Steve was tapping his fingers against the car door and staring out the window where the road had been carved out of the side of the mountain.
“Of our really crappy choices?  Yes.  But, I’m not going to lie, even with the serum and the safeguards Friday will put in, there’s some risk here, Steve.  We’re way past anything you can read in Grey’s Anatomy on this. The doctors don’t even want to hear it.  They want to unplug everything and take their chances, but Tony…brain damaged?  Tony, for Christ’s sake!  I—I had to try,” Bruce stuttered to a halt, swiping a hand across his mouth.  “Look, this is me, Cho and Friday with a Hail Mary, but—but I think if we don’t do something, I think it’s going to be bad, okay?  If we do this, it might be bad anyway, but…I think it’s the best shot we have.”
“Working on it.  Team Happily Ever After.  Rah-rah,” Tony replied, rubbing his fingers at his temple again.
“I’m sorry,” Steve heard himself say. The words seemed to echo discordantly through the chamber, harsh and brittle. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he kept repeating, the words spilling out of him as he slowly slid down, sinking to his knees. His back protested as his shins hit the hard ground, sending a jolt of pain up the base of his spine, but he almost relished it, maybe private penance, but he welcomed it nonetheless. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, burying his head against Tony’s stomach, his body shuddering with the release.
“Something like that,” Steve said, then smiled and shook his head, looking up at the sun with a squint.  “What about you?  You were some kind of kid genius, right?  I remember reading a profile about you.  Said you went to MIT when you were, what, sixteen?”
White Coat One was clearly part of some elaborate ruse, Tony decided, a few minutes later as he sat on one of the barf-hiding-beige faux leather chairs that squeaked when he moved.  This was a test.  This was a test to see just how stupid he was right out of the gate, and no way in hell was he playing bait and probably literal switch with this shit.
They walked the path back to the village together, hand in hand, and Steve was reminded of his mother’s words again. A door between worlds, he thought, and I’ve come out the other side.  The desiccated village glowed with a ring of light from the fires lit by the soldiers where they camped at the edges.  The beach was almost smooth, the familiar rocks that had littered it for hundreds of years having now found their final resting place.  It was fitting, Steve thought, that the sea should deliver their cairn.  They were people of the water, and had not deserved to end in ash and smoke.
“Unbeknownst to me, my best friend hired Steve for a private dance in my hotel room, but I ended up sort of trying to bribe a politician, and, in exchange for what I keep trying to tell him is a paltry sum, Steve here agreed to be a stand up kind of guy and make an honest man out of me so as to not have to testify against me, and buy me some time to bring down a global terrorist network that reaches to the highest institutions of our government,” Tony told Barnes in one long breath while Barnes stared at him.
Tony nodded.  “It took me a long time to find and translate the ritual, and then to predict when this would occur.  As I said, the
Steve rolled his lips together and put his hands on his hips as he studied the suggestions Cam had put out for him.  They were…decidedly more revealing than what Steve usually chose for himself, Steve thought with a huff of amusement.  Cam was nothing if not direct.  Reaching out, Steve picked up a delicate chain with golden circles the size of coins dangling from the middle.
“Wow, that’s...wow,” Tony said, his voice tremorous and breathy.  “Like a hit of morphine, dopamine and serotonin. Damn, you should bottle that, Jesus…hey, listen, ah, can you maybe--ah.  Maybe let me up, what do you say?”
Steve hesitated but a moment, and added his cup to the toast, sipping a bit under his veil as the clamor settled down. Peace. But for who? He watched the Ul’s slaves move about the table, refilling goblets and plates, their thin, metal collars catching the light of the oil lamps.
“God, you’re a terrible liar,” Natasha groused, shaking her head and popping another olive into her mouth.
“Connery,” Steve grinned.  He leaned back in his seat and splayed his legs out, smiling warmly at Tony across the table.  It was…nice. This was nice.  Being out with Steve like this.  Tony paused and glanced around, where other couples and families, tables of friends or coworkers, were laughing and eating and having a night out, like normal people.  Having fun. Enjoying themselves.
“Oh, God,” Kirk grimaced and let his eyes close as his head tilted back on his shoulders, finally opening them again when he was staring at the ceiling.  “We’ll go with a no on that one then.  Fear not, unicorn whisperer, I brought party favors.”
“Uh-huh, well, if the Board wants to get outside consultants to take another look, that’s fine, but the numbers aren’t going to change,” Tony was saying while he rubbed at his forehead with one hand.  “I know what the stock hit is going to look like.  Hell, I still have a controlling interest, so who do you think is taking the biggest hit?  I’ll take care of the ESOP loss,” Tony said, waving Steve over and indicating a seat across the table.  “Food’s on its way,” he told Steve.
, and he let out a stuttering cry as the third slid inside, easier than he would have thought. The rest of the hooked end followed, pushing the rounded tip high enough to just barely brush that spot deep inside that made his body light up.
“Did you fight a lot of battles?  Did you have a sword?  And a horse?  And armor?” Cam asked, the questions coming out in an overflow of words with the sudden, ferocious curiosity of youth.
“You did well today, Small Hands,” Tony congratulated with a grin.  “A surprise awaits you in your room.  Go on, now.  Run along.”
Smart, funny, wonderful Steve, and Tony had managed to lose the best thing that ever happened to him without even realizing it.  There was some paper he signed, years ago, while Obie schmoozed and talked about new projects and handed him a bottle of Scotch, the good kind that Obie got imported from someplace he claimed to have a stake in, and at that moment, Tony had lost Steve.  All because he had been too God-damned caught up in all the things he could do to notice the shit that was going down right in front of him. Hide it in plain sight, isn’t that what they say is the best way? And Obie had been a master at it. Made it official.  Routine. All right there for Tony to see, except he hadn’t, of course. Hadn’t even been suspicious. It was Obie, and they were the good guys, he thought, mouth curdling into a bitter line. He scraped a hand through his hair and closed his eyes, letting out a long hiss of air through his nose.
Anto suspected that if that was truly how a child was created, then he would never have anything to worry about, since Tyber was never pleased with him.  He took Maara’s special medicine anyway, just to be certain. It would make his spirit hard to conquer, she said. Not impossible. Some spirits were strong enough to overcome even the medicine and mix with the Omega’s spirit to form a child.  So far, though, Tyber’s spirit was apparently not that strong, and for that, Anto was deeply relieved. The last thing he wanted was a child of Tyber’s spirit, though it seemed to frustrate Tyber to the point of rage that Anto never conceived.   It was an embarrassment that his spirit wasn’t strong enough to conquer an Omega’s, and Tyber hated him for that above almost anything else, Anto thought, knowing that he would face Tyber’s wrath each time his Heat came and went without a quickening, and that it would be worse while Tyber tried to prove his spirit was strong enough, at least until he got frustrated enough to give up for a time, blame Anto and his misshapen body and foul, unnatural spirit that was too strong for an Omega.  Anto liked the peace of that time, short though it sometimes was.
It was clearly some kind of magic to be able to capture a spirit like this, Anto thought. That was what the clan would say.  That was what Jhrvis would say. And yet, he could see how Steve used the blade to scrape the lines into the bone. It would have required skill, concentration, and a strong hand, but he could see how the slashes were made to slowly form the image.  It was both simple and extraordinary. Did the Others decorate everything like this? Did they try to bring the animal’s spirit close this way? On a hunting weapon, Anto could understand it, but you didn’t hunt cave lions, and this wasn’t a weapon, just a discarded bone Anto had cobbled together to make the man’s splint.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said, walking into the kitchen were Tony was, Jesus Christ, playing with the pepper.  He stopped rolling the shaker and tried to grab for it, nearly knocking it over before managing to get it put back in its place next to the salt.  “You look great.”
“We played for ration wafers and sheets of toilet paper, but hey, if you think you can handle that kind of high rolling,” Steve offered with an innocent smirk, hands shoved into his pockets while he rocked back and forth on his heels. A sharp ding announced they had arrived at the penthouse, and the doors pulled apart, emptying them into the suite’s living room, which was occupied by a sole inhabitant watching the basketball game on the big screen and eating one of the ten dollar packs of peanuts from the minibar.
“It’s not paints,” Tony said, then wagged his head back and forth at Barnes’ look.  “Fine. It’s not only paints.  Just, you know, something for you to do while you’re stuck here. Whatever.”
It was the middle of the night now, sometime between really late and really early, Tony wasn’t even sure.  The room was dark, save for the too-bright light above Steve's bed that gave off a low buzzing sound that apparently only Tony could hear because no one else seemed to notice.  He wasn’t technically supposed to be here, though he suspected the visiting hours imposed by the so-called experts were more to keep him from annoying them than bothering Steve.  They’d be in soon enough to shoo him out so they could change bags, run more pointless tests and scatter their bag of bones onto the ground in the hopes it told them something useful.  For now, Tony had the chair pulled up next to the bed, his head resting on the mattress next to Steve’s hip, his hand curled around Steve’s because he didn’t seem to know how to let go anymore, if he ever had.  Maybe that was what Pepper had seen, long before Tony ever did, when she’d started distancing herself so slowly, he hadn’t even realized what was happening until he was looking into agricultural land, and she was calling him from Shanghai.
. But yes, he is an Alpha," Steve told him and ran his hands down Tony's biceps. "But he's not a threat. No one's a threat, okay?"
"Personal assistant," said Pepper, glaring daggers at him.  During her time as Tony's assistant, she'd loathed the word "secretary."
Tony's grip on Steve's hand tightened a little.  "First of all, there's nothing to discuss.  I was dying and now I'm not. No problem, okay?  Don't worry, Pepper.  You
Tony shoved a pile of papers at Steve; there was a drawing and lines and lines of math.  "That's a tesseract.  It's a geometric shape... a 4D cube, basically.  Maybe 'Tesseract' is a new coding language or something... I don't know."  He looked over at Steve, and added, "Don't worry about Clint.  If he couldn't handle himself I'm sure they would call you or Natasha in."
"Jesus," Pepper muttered and went back to her seat, cradling her coffee in her hands. Steve knew it was a skinny cinnamon latte (he was a good PA, still.)
George, Donner, and Danielle all quietly agreed among each other to stay with Banksy.  He spent the first day curled up in bed, crying himself dry.
"...show me what you drew," he said quietly.  He didn't really care but he knew this was important to Steve.  If he was alone he would have liked to drink himself stupid but he wasn't alone anymore and probably never would be again.  "Can you put a shot in this?  Please?  I need it, Steve.  ...please."
"He's probably going to be fine.  The serum... altered his body in a lot of ways.  He doesn't get sick and he heals so quickly.  I'm guessing he's immune to whatever you're carrying.  Well, even if he gets the virus, it's unlikely he'd ever experience a real outbreak.  But I personally wouldn't be chancing it.  Which is what you do every time you don't use a condom.  Haven't either of you talked to a doctor about any of this?  Are you just relying on his knowledge from the thirties' and your own drunken experience?"
"Okay," he said softly, a warm kind of smile breaking out onto his features as he turned around. Tony's arm felt strong as he curled it around Steve's waist and he was tucked back against the Alpha, their bodies slotting together surprisingly well. Steve reached down blindly and pulled the duvet up over their shoulders. He sighed contently and curled against Tony, happily pressing against him as his eyes drifted shut. Steve wasn't sure he'd ever felt so safe. So... at
Donner winced a little.  "He's kicking again. I swear, this kid is going to be a soccer player."  He lifted his shirt; there was a small ripple over his stomach.
Tony had procured a pad of graph paper within seconds of entering the lock exhibit and moments later was completely immersed in drawing the designs.  He wasn't an artist, like Steve, nor especially talented. Tony couldn't shade or produce a portrait. However, when it came to mechanical details, he was second to none.  Tony had been called a great programmer and a great electrical engineer and a great aerospace engineer, but staring at the simple details of locks from the 1800s, Tony began completely engrossed.  If he had not been born into the Stark family, he very easily could have become a regular car mechanic or a machinist. He liked to work with his hands, liked the hardware of things, and always seemed happiest when he was in the shop bolting something down or welding something to something else.  In the year they'd been together, Steve had watched Tony cheerfully disassemble various devices, from the dishwasher and coffee maker to entire cars in the garage, clearly enjoying seeing the interaction of the pieces.
"Tell him Tony's very busy helping me adjust to the 21st century and we'll call him back later..." Steve told JARVIS, letting his eyes slip shut again.
"...personally, I don't think omegas should really be allowed to serve in the army at all," said Malick breezily, looking at Tony.  "...they weren't, in Steve's day. I supposed they made an exception because of his... unique circumstances. But I suppose you think
"How 'bout you? Did Clint have lots of cool comic books in his treehouse? Did you guys do each other's nails or was it more like swapping bubblegum and trading cards?"  He left out that he'd tried to track them.
Tony swatted her away.  She looked to Rhodey, silently asking, with her eyes, whether they should get Steve or not.  Whether it would make things better, or worse.
Steve didn't really have the energy to care. He just dropped down into one of the nearest seats and leaned his head back. Sitting down was his new favourite thing right now.
Another problem with honeymooning: Tony had found that the faintest whiff of Steve' arousal was enough to stall his thought process completely.  At that moment, if anyone had asked him about the tesseract or the mysterious Project Thor or even who the head of SHIELD was, Tony wouldn't have had any clue what they were talking about.  He stroked Steve's slick entrance, growling encouragingly against his lips.  He was completely unaware of the towel still draped over him.  A bucket of water tossed over him probably wouldn't have merited so much as a shake of the head.  Seeing Steve climb out of the pool and strut over with such a ridiculously confident yet understated presence... right when Tony thought he had control of his instincts again, they reared up and slapped him in the face.
Tony beamed at Steve's joke.  It wasn't exactly a joke, per se, but Tony was high and everything seemed funny and bright and colorful and he was just glad he and Steve were together again.
"For you?  Or in general?  I mean, they had workshops for guys like you, you know, with unruly omegas."
After a long moment, Tony managed to regroup enough to place a sloppy kiss against the side of Steve’s mouth.
“Hey,” Steve mumbled, still half-asleep.  Brock was already showered and dressed, and bright light was coming in the window, so it must be later than he thought.
“I didn’t...I didn’t mean to make you feel like that,” Tony said carefully, gaze watching Steve’s hunched shoulders and the drawn, tight line of his jaw.  Tony scrubbed a hand over his mouth, flattening his lips together and glancing heavenward for support or guidance, he wasn’t sure.  “Damn.  Dammit, I should’ve thought…I got ahead of myself, and I wanted to, I don’t know, show off, I guess.  I wanted…I wanted them to know you were special.  Pepper called over, you know, to tell them what to expect. She does things like that. Thinks of things.  They didn’t even know who you were.  Had to look you up in some directory, and I just…I thought, that’s—I can’t have that.  Them not knowing.  It was stupid,” Tony admitted harshly.  “It was stupid, I know.”
That—that wasn’t at all what Tony had been talking about.  They were talking about Steve’s friend. Tony was going to apologize. Again.  Or something.  They weren’t going to talk about this…this thing that wasn’t going to happen.
He wanted to look good.  He had to apologize to Steve for earlier, and it would be better if he looked good, which made no sense, but experience told him it was probably true.  It was like a no solution equation.  No matter what variable he put in, he was left with a contradiction.  So, best to aim for looking presentable, at a minimum.
Tony grinned, taking his lower lip in his teeth to keep from laughing.  Partly from Steve’s sudden lack of coordination, partly from relief, joy, arousal, whatever it was that was currently dancing around in his stomach and making him light-headed.
Once Tony got started laughing, it was hard to catch his breath long enough to stop. He’d come to some kind of end where he thought he had control of himself, then Steve would start again and before he knew it, they were acting like a couple of teens at a slumber party, cracking up just by looking at each other.
"Sleep with Captain America's mate and I ruin you," Natasha smiled, pressing her empty glass into one of the Morgan's hands before she slipped away with a wink, deadly red lips quilted up in a smile. She was probably having more fun than she had admittedly expected to.
"Don't supposed it's too late to fool around a little?" asked Tony hopefully, closing the door behind them.
to protect Steve, just like that time outside the movie theater when he'd taken on that guy twice as big as-
"Steve?  ...we're gonna do great," said Tony with uncharacteristic seriousness.  He sounded like he was reassuring Steve, even though Steve hadn't said anything.
His best metric for "normal" was Jarvis, but using one person to represent an entire group of people was obviously not ideal.  Worse, now that Tony know about his relationship with his father, he was forced to re-evaluate nearly everything.  Was Jarvis loyal because he was inherently a loyal person, or because he was pair-bonded to Howard, or because he took his job as the family butler seriously?  Jarvis was long-dead and Tony couldn't ask him.  He remembered at least once seeing bruises on Jarvis's neck and asking about them, and Jarvis laughing lightly and telling Tony he was clumsy.  Damned liar.  Tony knew perfectly well where those bruises had come from now.
Karpov sat with him until he fell asleep.  The Winter Soldier was a shaking, drooling mess.  Karpov brushed his hair off his face, feeling an almost paternal affection, mixed with disgust.  Years of delicate programming, undone in an instant. His obedient, loyal soldier, reduced to this.  And still, Stark was alive, Rogers was inaccessible, and they were no closer to their objective than before.
The asset had no idea what he meant; he just wanted to see him.  "But I want to see him," he persisted.
Bucky rolled down the window before lighting his cigarette.  He put his good arm out the window, enjoying the taste of the cigarette and the cool air on his skin.  "Oh, look, Steve," he said, pulling his arm back into the car. "...there's a ladybug on my hand."
He pulled the sleeve of wires and magnets down over his arm, then picked up a garbage can lid.  He should probably ask to borrow Steve's shield, but he didn't have time; he was too excited to try this out.
"Whatever you want," Phil told him and stood. "It's your heat Steve," he said as he offered him a hand to pull him up. Steve stood a little shakily. "Just be careful. Don't blow cover."
"What statement?  You look like an idiot," said Dan frankly.  "Hello, Steve," he added breezily, as if acknowledging Tony had brought along a dog or something.
The small group left the office and took pizza orders from the others as they left. They grabbed coats and then an awkward amount of them pressed into the elevator. Kerry glared at George as he murmured something in her ear as they stepped out of the lift.
He pressed into the omega for warmth.  Steve was not only bigger than him but felt like he was about a million degrees, a side-effect of the serum and Steve's ridiculous metabolism.
"If you get a moment alone let him know you're there to get him out. He'll probably be a lot more enthusiastic if he knows he's being rescued."
Then he gathered himself up and, with cold, mechanical precision, began making all the funeral arrangements.
The man didn't look remotely tired for 3am. Perhaps he never even slept. Steve wouldn't be surprised.
And it was all very well Tony saying he didn't have to like a soldier right now but he sure had yesterday. He'd been shot at, thrown against walls, choked... Steve caught his appearance in the mirror. He was perhaps a little paler than usual but it was the blue and pinkish fingerprint bruises on his neck that stuck out.
"If he's sorry, then he can say it to me himself," Steve mumbled. His eyes were red around the edges and his cheeks were flushed in an ugly sort of way. Donner had let go of his hand to clutch at his belly. Steve returned to clutching at Tony's shirt, shoving his face against his chest, as if he could somehow hide himself there.
Tony clung to Steve's hand.  He didn't want to be left with any of these people.  The thing that scared him most was that Tony, who had graduated in '87, a mere four years after arranged bondings were banned, could have very well been on the other end of things.  His parents had died when he was 16, but if they had lived, who knew if his father would have tried to set him up with an omega? He could imagine himself at 18, being led into a room for a "scenting," picking out one he liked, taking them home... it sent shivers up his spine and made him sick.  And like George, he wouldn't have really known better. Until recently in Tony's life, he'd never questioned omegas being servants.
"You're a good drawer. I had no idea," Phil commented as he finally glanced around. Steve half smiled.
"...I carried you," said Bucky, brow furrowing.  "You said you didn't want to mate in a cell, with cameras.  So we left the cell and now we're here. No video. Have I completed my objective?" he repeated, desperately wanting validation.
Tony watched him wolfing down food with an odd sense of fondness.  Poor Steve. He ate like a guy who had never seen filet mignon before.
Trickshot's watched Tony and Steve go, his face a stormy mask.  Tony had already begun to think of him as "Angry Clint."
Steve's words were reverberating through his head.  Hadn't Steve said he was a shitty Alpha or was that a false memory?  Hadn't Steve said that he couldn't feel him anymore, or was
"Just a Rather Very-- cute," said Coulson.  "But you're stalling.  Director Fury authorized us to use any means necessary to keep you on premises and focused on your task.  So we can do this the hard way, or the easy way.  Your choice.  But my patience is wearing out."  He crossed his arms authoritatively.
of him..."  Tony gritted his teeth.  Just the memory of it was arousing.  Tony was pretty sure he was going to be jerking off to the memory of that smell for a long, long time.  "...I don't
Tony wasn't surprised when Steve fell asleep curled up next to him.  Actually, he ended up dozing a little, too, waking up only when JARVIS informed him that the pizza had arrived.
The woman was tugging on his arm but Tony couldn't feel it and he began walking, ignoring the throb of his injured ankle, not realizing she was pulling him. The suit clanked and whirred, its gears doing the work for Tony's muscles, his own strength and agility because artificially enhanced by the technology, and, in the case of his bad ankle, replaced entirely.
"Are there any jets in here?" Steve asked. "One you could get into?  To get away?" He looked into Bucky's eyes, willing there to be an answer. "I need you to find a jet. And help Wanda and Pietro get out of here, too, okay? You've got to keep them safe, Buck; they don't have anyone else.  They're innocents.  They shouldn't be here.  And if they try and kill Stark, SHIELD will go after them... and SHIELD already wants you."
"Yours," Steve whispered and shivered a little as Tony's fingers traced over the scar. He stepped closer, neither of them noticing that the Honda was very much gone by now.
want to," said Tony, looking up.  "I really want to, Steve. I'm happy when you're happy, remember?  And besides, I want to ensure I get that birthday collar."  He gave Steve a cheekily little grin, then leaned down. A moment later Steve felt something wet between his legs.
"Take the rest of the night off, Jarv.  I'm done for now," said Tony, sounding exhausted.  He staggered over to the door, leaving the disassembled suit pieces and tools all over the shop floor, feeling wrung-out and ready to crash.  His earlier excitement at Steve being gone was replaced for a desperate need to hold and be held by his omega, who, thankfully, knew exactly how confusing and gritty and morally ambiguous war could be.
The rest of the day mostly involved them fussing over Tony. They took an x-ray of his foot, with Steve on stand-by, and then fixed it up properly. It had been a very bad sprain but fortunately hadn't needed a plaster cast. They put a brace on it to help it stay in place while it healed and gave Tony crutches which they
The serum meant both of them had heightened metabolism and a much higher demand for calories, but they didn't have that sort of time. They needed to switch cars within the next twenty minutes. Natasha has taught him well. Although honestly, in all this busy city, they might be quicker on foot.  In any case, there was no time for food, even if Steve was sort of hungry, too.
"Least you guys have pineapple," Steve pointed out quietly with a sigh. America wasn't hit especially hard by war rationing, but they weren't exactly throwing exotic fruits around for everyone to enjoy in the forties. The elevator thankfully stopped and they stepped out. Natasha was already on the phone, ordering  pizzas in fluent Italian from some, no doubt, local joint.
Tony slid onto a bar stool, grinning.  "This is fun." Tony was all about bright, loud atmospheres.  A gaggle of college students was playing darts across the room; on the television, a proper football game (with a checkered ball) was playing.
He twisted in and around the water, coming up for air occasionally before diving back down. The sun was streaming through the water, dancing over the curves of his body in the water.  He liked the movement, the freedom.  The celebration of his body, which had once been so broken and now was so fantastically
"It usually ends in a fight to death, unsurprisingly." Coulson grimaced. "Shall we get this scan over and done with?"
Malick looked thoroughly disarmed by Tony's casual demeanor.  He regained his composure quickly. "I should have known a man of your tastes had been here before," he said.  "...I admit, I was... surprised that the captain would have suggested it. I suppose that's where he got the idea."
"Yes.  That will be sufficient.  Is this the new wing dedicated to Steve being an omega?" asked Bucky, pointed.
All that relief and serenity Steve had been feeling dissipated in an instant and a heavy weight tugged in his gut. Was he going to be sick? He felt like maybe he was. Natasha was giving him one of her looks- a sympathetic look, like she was right all along but she was sorry she was. Steve didn't move right away, a lump lodging in his throat.
"Anything you want, just name it," said Tony, shuffling around some of the larger orchids to block the tulips from sight.  "As long as it's not work, I don't want to deal with SHIELD or the expo fallout or anything involving your civil rights crusade... no offense... I just really wanna have a few days that are just us, you know?"
Patriotism didn't have the same charm that it used to. That was one thing Steve had found in the 21st century... America wasn't as golden as it was made out to be back in his day.
.  But it was only a couple of years ago that those words had been spoken aloud.  In the cave, between the freezing water that threatened to suffocate him, the stinging impact of jumper cables, the burn of cigarettes, they hissed things to him he'd always sort of suspected.  That no one would come for him, because no one cared for him.  That his only purpose was to build weapons and so he might as well do it for them, because otherwise, he was worthless.  He didn't deserve the life he'd been handed and this was what he truly deserved.  He was barely truly a man, or an Alpha, or a human.  He was no one.  Nothing.
Well, that answered that then.  Steve should have known better than to expect any sort of transparency from Nick, who was, after all, a spy.  But then, Peggy had been, too, and so was Natasha.  If Steve was honest, he'd always had a bit of a soft spot for spies.
His hair was brown, not blond, and he was a little more muscular than Clint, but he looked worn and ragged, like it had been a rough couple of years for him.  He had a shadow of a beard but not a full one, being an omega; he smelled faintly of post-heat, just like the others. His expression was one of stony non-compliance.
Tony took two defiant steps toward the villa, but then, suddenly, remembered the time he and Steve had been fighting Vanko and his drones.  Remembered how many times he'd yelled for Steve to duck or roll or cover, and then fired off a shot or a laser or something, trusting that Steve had gotten out of the way.
Tony let out a noise of protest, still feeling hurt.  Christmas Eve had become one of the few intimate things he and Pepper had together, something they did outside of their working relationship.  Every year they'd go up to Mt. Baldy and drink a cup of cocoa with a shot of peppermint schnapps. They'd been doing it for a decade. The only year they'd missed was the one when Tony was in Afghanistan.
"-I like cats more than dogs," said Tony quietly.  "I think black licorice is great, gets a bad rap for no reason.  My favorite actress is Salma Hayek.  Or Amy Nuttall.  Oh!  Or Phoebe Cates.  Hers were the first breasts I ever saw.
"Flirting with girls half his age while inebriated? Touching up his exes in front of you? And, all in all, not appreciating whatsoever how goddamn lucky he is to have you? You're wasted on him, Captain Rogers. And if you only had a male mate before, and now Mr. Stark, surely you want to know what the other half of us tastes like," she half-smiled and her breath was hot against Steve's jaw.
, not sass.  Is this your new thing?  Make everything into a goddamn omega rights issue?  Make me the bad guy 'cause I was born Alpha, 'cause I happened to get lucky?  ...thanks for that, Steve."
"Fuck, fuck, fuck," chanted Tony.  He deployed flares, released the shoulder ailerons, and grabbed onto a passing radio tower
"There will be odd security team in the forest that we can pick out, but the bulk of hostiles will be in the building itself on the higher floors. Lower down will be where the actual lab is. It'll be hard to get into it. I'm hoping Tony can help us with that one."
Steve didn't quite know what to say to that. It was so sweet and sincere that it rendered him speechless. His cheeks tinged pink and his expression was raw and exposed as he watched Tony pull of his top. Steve reached up, his fingers tracing around the arc reactor tentatively before they dipped down into his abdomen.
Before he was even aware of it, Tony was standing up, keeping Steve's cheek pressed to his knee.  He stood there for a few moments, basking in it, then broke away to circle Steve, check his posture.  It was perfect, but that wasn't the point.  Tony had to make sure.  He couldn't approve of it without checking and it would be insulting not to check it, because Steve was giving him this and he wasn't going to just throw it away.  His fingertips trailed over Steve's back and shoulders, never breaking contact as he circled, wanting Steve to know he was here and he was giving him his full attention.
Tony's working fingers made him shiver involuntarily as they passed over serum-smooth skin. Steve watched Tony stand and took the hand when it was offered automatically. Their fingers slotted together just right.
"Okay, look, first of all, he's an omega, he can hit the notes.  Second, if he can't, no one will care because he's Steve Rogers. Third, there's auto-tune."
scared.  So many things could go wrong.  Tony's math was solid, sure, and his engineering skills unparalleled.  But all that was theoretical.  In practice, unexpected things happened.  The collider could fail to work or blow up in the his face.  The element might not be synthesized, or if it was, it might be too unstable to be held in the newest arc reactor, in which case Tony was a goner.
"Can I see your gross eye under the eye patch?  Seriously, I've been dying to know what it looks like."
? That was one of the first times Pepper had been rendered speechless.  And how did you console someone about being tortured for three months, anyway?
Steve looked up in alarm when he saw DeSoto. "I told you not to come in here." Maybe if he liked DeSoto, he wouldn't have minded so much. But Steve didn't like him in their personal space, not such a creepy and willing omega who stayed awake half the night just in case Tony 'wanted' him...urgh.  Steve knew, logically, it wasn't DeSoto's fault he was how he was.  But he still didn't like him.
He didn't actually have a plan for what he would do when Steve came, whether he'd spit it out or swallow it.  He hadn't thought that far ahead. Although now would probably be a good time to consider it, since Steve was swelling in his mouth and twitching and spasming under him and he was tasting Steve's fluids.  Steve consistently swallowed but, again, Steve was a rather more considerate lover than Tony.
The metal was smooth and warm and strong. Steve smiled as he trailed his fingers over the ridges and bumps. The blue light emitting from it made him feel happy...safe. He tilted his head and fell quiet briefly in his contentment.
"I need to talk to him and Pepper.  Probably more Pepper than him. You guys aren't cleared for the party you're planning, Captain," said Rhodey.  "Not considering the... situation."
"I'll go upstairs to speak with him," Pepper decided quietly and slipped away towards the steps. Her heels clicked quietly across the metal as she went.
At least Jorge couldn't.  Jorge was a beta. And also didn't speak English.  Hell, Jorge was probably Tony's favorite person he'd met here all weekend.
He didn't remember a goddamn thing from the previous night; fortunately, Steve had left a note reminding him that he'd be at Clint's.
it, Tony. And I want to be submissive for you, but in private- not in a store.  I just-- I have these insecurities about people seeing me as-- I just hated all the collars, okay?"
"Yes... yes... yes... yes..." Tony hooked him fingers into Steve's collar and tugged him to the side, pushing him to roll him over; Steve was like putty, practically mind-reading what he wanted; he was already on his knees, head down, legs spread invitingly, presenting himself, and Tony was climbing onto him, pushing himself into his warm, inviting entrance.
Tony actually gagged.  "Look, Don, the miracle of life is amazing and all but I'm a mechanic.  Your spawn terrifies me. Put your shirt down."
"I heard Stark won DeSoto last night.  ...did you hear DeSoto's story?" asked Fred, turning to Steve, eyes bright.  "I mean, come on. A week after DeSoto got shot, Tricky just disappeared. I'm telling you.  Open up Ronnie's septic tank and-- bam! Skeleton city."
Pepper smiled.  "Yes, actually. I thought she might want to talk about, I don't know... the charity, your involved in Status Alliance.  We went to dinner but it turns out her interest in me was of a personal nature, and... well. She got the wrong idea." She laughed lightly.  "My first date in three years and it's a woman. God, it was so awkward, I felt terrible. Well, we still had a nice time, we got a few drinks and went dancing anyway.  It was fun. ...don't tell Tony or I'll never hear the end of it."
