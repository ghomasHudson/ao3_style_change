Steve is too proud to admit that he misses their banter once it’s gone.
Bucky allows himself to smirk a little. “You’re in love with Sharon?”
release any kind of projectiles until I give the okay!” Steve barks, flinging his makeshift wooden shield across the field to protect The Wasp from a stray rocket launched by Shuri.
Why isn’t anyone
“We won,” he says, and feels tears sting at his eyes. He walks forward to Tony – to the body of Tony Stark. Rhodey has taken Pepper in his arms, and Steve knows it’s his responsibility to deal with the body of his fallen comrade. He closes Tony’s eyes shut with a gloved hand, digs under the armour to lift Tony up in his arms. He walks, with Tony’s limp body, his head hanging slack towards the sky. The other Avengers are falling in, murmuring his name like a prayer. “Iron Man,” they say with reverence, grief and tenderness. “Stark,” and “Tony.”
my fault, then,” Steve says, dazed. “All of it.”
“Just like her father,” Steve says, smiling up at her. “She’s brilliant.”
"Give me a break! I'm doing what has to be done.”
The noise of battle halts, and is replaced by an eerie silence.
he would,” Bruce says, peering at Steve over his too-small glasses. “I know I probably would too, even though I know how damn stupid that is. Plus, the Hulk isn’t exactly good for stealth,” he says, waving a gigantic arm in a gesture at himself. “And there’s the fact Rhodey would probably use the opportunity to say goodbye to Tony, in his own way.”
Training goes to hell.
There’s a pause, and then Tony is staring at him. Almost daring him to do something - Steve doesn’t know what.
"He’s my friend!” Steve roars, but this time his words aren’t directed at Tony. This time, his words aren’t about Bucky.
Steve though, still feels as though he's been cast adrift. He isn’t even sure how he’s meant to react to what happened. He has lost too much to celebrate, and yet he hasn’t lost enough to justify his monumental grief. He feels empty, purposeless. Sometimes he spends hours just lying down, thinking over everything. Wondering if there was a way out he didn't see, or what he could have done differently to change what happened. If they call on him, he’ll be there. But when he doesn’t have a mission, he lies restless in his new accommodation, wasting hours to thoughts about a past he can’t change.
Steve thinks.
between us it’s like there’s no space between us at all. God this sounds like a love letter. Pepper!”
He puts it off until he can’t anymore, until he risks never knowing.
Steve cowers under the offensive. “I’m sorry. I am. Tony, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to lead, without you here. I need you.”
“Oh,” Bucky says, surprised. “After all this time? Still? It’s been – what, how many years, Steve?”
Steve bites his lip, grinning despite himself. “I guess he did.”
Steve follows her, curious. When he sees Nicholas J. Fury standing on the edge of the pier, hands clasped behind his back, he feels almost disappointed. Steve wonders if he was there for the funeral, or just flew in at the right time to talk shop. As he walks towards him, he has a brief impulse to push him into the water, just to take out his restless energy on
Somewhere, outside of this dream, another Steve wants to take it all back and comfort Tony. But the Steve in the dream doesn’t stop confronting him.
“I know,” Steve says, even though he thinks it isn’t true. He’s been like this for as long as he can remember since the ice, thinking about Peggy. Feeling like he didn’t quite belong in the time he was in. Maybe – maybe there was a time he didn’t feel that way, when the Avengers were together. But that was so fleeting, and it has been so many years since then.
“You both have the singular ability to make the universe go very well or very poorly depending on how friendly you are feeling towards each other on a given day,” Strange replies sardonically. “Of course it’s a lot more complicated than that, but nevertheless, your friction in our reality brought several levels of hell down on us all.”
Steve knows that Fury wasn’t there to hear that, and equally knows Fury already knows everything that happened on that day better than Steve does.
“Good to see you alive, Nick,” Steve says. “We spent a good few weeks working out what the hell that beacon was. You could have told us. Trusted us, in case it didn’t work.”
Steve feels his heart sink in his chest. “I hope not,” he says quietly. Bruce seems to notice his expression close up.
“Besides,” Strange adds, mysteriously, “If I tell you what happens… it won't happen.”
“Why did you never summon Captain Marvel to help us before, anyway?” Steve counters. “We could have used her aid countless times.”
The drive to the tower is filled with Rhodey and Happy discussing something about a mission. Peter can only barely follow, but he figures it’s something to do with the Avengers. Shouldn’t Tony have gone with them, though, if they’re really out? And why didn’t Rhodey join?
Dr. Palmer falls quiet when Peter walks inside. Happy notices him immediately and takes a step to the side, giving Peter room to get closer. Tony is just blinking, but the moment Peter is standing next to him, he smiles at last. A cold chill passes through Peter when he sees the yellow color of Tony’s skin. That’s not how he left him last night.
Oh, this Steve’s a real smart-ass. Tony kind of likes it, if only it wouldn’t be used in such a negative way towards him.
“He said he couldn’t tell us over the phone – can you believe Thor has a phone?” Steve doesn’t smile, though. His arms are crossed over his chest, his face serious. Then he gives Tony a pointed look. “Well, what are you waiting for?”
Tony stays for about two more hours before he’s chased away by the guards. Visiting hours are over, and Steve is guided back to the dining hall where he’s put in line to get his food.
Steve groans in frustration, and Natasha and Wanda both roll their eyes as well. If they’re going to involve Tony, things are seriously going to get out of hand.
But he supposes that’s what it’s like, being a dad. It’s all about pretending to think everything will sort itself out. And maybe, if he thinks it for long enough, he might even believe it.
“Good, then I will see you in a few days’ time,” T’Challa concludes. When he steps again, Steve doesn’t follow anymore. He just stands there, watching the King walk away, feeling like he’s about ready to explode out of his own skin.
His mood changes from day to day. Though usually he keeps up a good front, cracking jokes and laughing whenever possible, there are days where he can’t keep it up and it all goes downhill. That usually means that he’s quiet, barely paying attention, and sometimes just leaving the workshop with the excuse of splashing water in his face.

“Aw, how cute, your boyfriend comes to your rescue, Eugene,” Eddie returns. He holds up his fist, giving it a short look before moving it towards Peter’s face. Despite the alcohol, Peter avoids it easily. With a practiced move, he swings his own fist in a strong hook, hitting Eddie right in the face. When he goes flying into the room, Peter realizes he might have hit him a bit too hard.
“Wait a sec, what kind of meeting?” Brunnhildeautomatically grabbed the handles of her wheelchair and started pushing her, which was kind of nice because her arms were feeling soar, but on the other side, Yaël was too headstrong to admit she wanted help. She could roll wherever she fucking wanted, all by herself.
“Anyway, great things are about to happe-“
Then he finally starts washing himself up.
“Go home. I know you’re able to defend yourself, but I just want you to be safe right now.”
“But you chose to stay behind?”
she answers. Figures, the guy really thinks everything through. He can maybe try to hack it? But then again, this is
Fun. - We Are Young
“Even when you make fun of me you need to watch your language, jerk!” he warns him. Tony then starts laughing, winking towards Peter and getting back in his previous position against Steve’s shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
Stark was never going to help her get through FRIDAY’s eye to get to Nilla, neither was Peter. Not that he wouldn’t want to help Yaël, she just knew he wouldn’t want to let her make the same mistake he had made, so she didn’t even bother asking his help. She had texted him to say good luck to Tony with the presentation today, knowing that both of them would be too busy to keep an eye on her.
(See the end of the chapter for
He decides for the cab, though, feeling a strain on his muscles ever since the fight ended. He’s sure it’s not from exhaustion since he’s fought tougher and longer battles, but it’s like he’s completely emotionally drained.
UPDATE: A sequel for the story is up! It's called 'Something About Peter' and describes the events that happened after the Infinity War! It's going to be about 24 chapters, though it could be more! It's the final part of this series (so far), so if you're interested, you can find it there!
“Yeah, possessing that guy you mentioned that wanted to kick my ass,” Peter clarifies. Harry hisses.
“Oh, fucking shit! What do you want from me? You said I didn’t have to act like a sugar-coated Betty Boob!” She was going to scratch that smirk from his face. Scratch the ‘fun fight’ part.
“Ah, great,” he mutters to himself. He takes a few more seconds before he gets onto his feet. Then, he walks out of the alleyway – he should be happy that at least nobody found him like this. “Karen, can you maybe call my Dad for me?”
“Tony, I’m-“ Steve suddenly starts, but Tony shakes his head.
Iron Man suddenly shouts from above him. Peter looks up, suddenly distracted. That seems to be enough for the man, as Peter’s suddenly pushed back by an impressive force. Landing on the car right next to Strange, Peter groans in pain. He doesn’t really appreciate the impact.
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!” Peter shouts at her. “YOU SHOULD BE AT THE HOSPITAL!”
it. He never really did.
At eight, like always, Happy is ready to take Peter home. With the promise that Peter would stay over for the weekend again, the two part ways; Tony getting back inside the building, and Peter driving off with Happy. One look at his phone indicates that there’s still no answer.
“Great, the Goblin,” Peter mutters. He didn’t even know the guy got out.
Peter presses his lips together, wondering why suddenly Tony is reacting like this?
The rest of the drive it’s more one-sided banter between Rhodey and Tony. Once they arrive at the airport, it’s like Pepper has just lost all the patience she has again. Ushering everybody through security, they get themselves to the location where the aircraft is supposed to come down. It seems like they’re right on time, too.
I feel like I need to point this out, though: Peter's too much under the influence of the suit. He's aware of what his Dad said about the Infinity War and what happened there, but his mind can't process it yet, being too hyper and distracted because of the suit. It's all going to sink in soon enough, but I just felt like I needed to explain this bit. Of course he cares, just not right now!
“Dad? You’re back already?!” Peter calls back, trying to get out from his own trap on the ground. Tony just stands there, holding the two mugs into his hands and frowning down at his son, who is looking like somebody has been using him as a personal punching bag.
- hungover Peter
Oh, maybe he should try to breathe, too.
This guy kept raising questions, but right now she was still too shocked to think about it. The last inches of dirt, he removed with his hand after jumping into the grave. Yaël couldn’t see him from where she was standing, but only a few seconds later, she saw him climb out again with the unconscious Yaël on his back. He quickly glanced back at the castle.
He pays attention to class, answers the teacher’s questions and makes notes. It’s the only way for him to keep himself from thinking back about yesterday. Tony will be leaving tonight, all the way to Wakanda. But Peter doesn’t really want to see him right now. Not because he’s angry, but because he’s ashamed. He’s been a pretty crap son, after all.
“Do you really think someone completely mortal, like humans, can survive an outrageous smash from the Hulk? I mean…”
“Okay, let’s do the dishes…” she mumbled to herself as she put away her wallet. Wade may have broken all of her plates but her glasses were still alive and kicking… and filthy from the evening before. Yaël opened the tap and put it on hot. Then she walked to her little radio and plugged her phone to it. There was this song she wanted to learn to play somehow, also one of Wade’s. Where was it? She kept scrolling.
“And get another detention for trying to make the teacher believe you’ve got a robot called ‘dummy’?” Peter asks, now laughing genuinely. As Tony writes stuff down (only positive things), he, too, chuckles a bit because of it.
“The fuck, dude?” the Parker-kid asked. It was loud enough for the owner to hear.
Peter thinks bitterly, realizing how utterly useless the spider-sense has been right now.
“You going on patrol tonight?” Steve asks. Peter shrugs.
“How’s the wound?” Tony suddenly asks after packing away all of the suit-components, only to work on it later on. It bugs Peter a little bit that he’s going to finish it without him, but Tony keeps on insisting that he wants to keep the end result as a surprise.
His thoughts on the whole superhero-business get pulled away when his name is called out by his uncle.
“Apparently, Johnny and Wade are taking care of that part,” Tony says, though not exactly sounding confident about that. Pepper nods, throwing away what Bruce made and beginning from scratch.
FRIDAY counters. “
“Sure, I could use some time with friends,” he returns.
“You WHAT?!” she shouts. “ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU REALLY THINK TONY WON’T FIND OUT?!”
Though this thing between them hasn’t been going on for more than a month, the way they’re acting now is almost as if they’ve just gone back to the very beginning. They’re awkward, almost even cautious around each other. In other words, they’re just acting like stupid teenagers that can’t get their heads out of their asses.
Felicia lifts up an eyebrow, but accepts the handshake, seeming amused as well.
Steve hadn’t even realized that, during this mission, he’d started to call the tower just that. ‘Home’… It was where they came after chasing down another bust. Every lead they followed ends up with them arriving too late. There were only small indications that proved somebody had been there before, but never enough clues.
The last thing Yaël saw before waking up was that his eyes grew big out of surprise, even shock maybe.
- massive moodswings
“Well, I preferred the red hair,” Tony says in honesty. Natasha looks back at him, unimpressed. Her once red curls now straightened out and bleached into a light platinum blonde. It’s been cut shorter again, and from afar, she would not be recognized. Probably, in combination with her identity mask, she can get away anywhere, despite being a wanted fugitive.
“Yeah, I wasn’t supposed to. Who would want a sixteen-year-old in Space, after all?” Johnny laughs. Then he slaps Peter’s shoulder and jumps off the table. “Now please, tell me you’re not one of those guys who dabs his way through conversation? Did you ever pull a Killer Clown prank on anybody?
FRIDAY responds sadly. Alarms ring immediately inside of Peter’s head after that.
“I’m not sure, I woke up somewhere in an alleyway and I’m trying to get out,” Eddie responds. He slowly gets back up, shaking his aching shoulders loose before turning back towards Peter. His blue eyes meet his (behind the mask) and he gives him a light smile. “You’re the Spider-Man, aren’t you? The real one?”
‘Good,” the Cat returns. She puts a hand on Peter’s cheek (over his mask) and gives him a long look before pulling up her leg, initiating a kick. Peter jumps out of the way, making a back flip and landing a great distance away from him.
“What movie?”
Peter smirks, realizing he hasn’t been spending much time with his new friends lately. Sure, Wade still stalks him daily, and he gets to see Wanda almost every other day, but Yaël’s been pretty absent from his life the past few weeks.
Strange nods again. Peter clears his throat.
“PETER PARKER?” he almost shouts, mostly trying to just wake Peter up. It works; the teenager startles and drops out of the couch, tangled into the blanket.
“Show me those drawings,” Tony says, taking the pieces of paper Steve hands him and giving them a look. “You know it’s illegal; you’re like the most beautiful man on Earth, the kindest, super strong
my friends are.”
And when he receives a text from that all-too-annoying Wade, telling him that he should go to that girl’s apartment – Yaël, Peter reminds himself – and that they should meet up with him in the park, Peter only hesitates for a few seconds before turning into action and grabbing his bag.
“We need to get these hands checked, Tony. I think you actually broke a few fingers,” Steve says, and with that he helps the man get up at last. With an arm wrapped around him, Steve supports Tony out of the building through the private exit. It’s Steve who drives all the way back to the compound, and they’re both completely quiet the entire way.
The days went on like that. Yaël went to work, came home and got beaten in every single training. Well, that was because, at first, she didn’t want to hurt Clint too badly, so she didn’t show him her fullest potential. Even though that made her an extremely easy victim for Clint. Dr. Cho didn’t say a thing about her coming over every evening after training to get her wounds healed, but Yaël could hear her sigh.
“Sweetheart, you know Peter’s not in any danger right now, right?” Steve asks carefully. Tony lets out a sniff, breathing out heavily through his nose while keeping his eyes closed.
“Sounds intriguing. So you don’t exactly make art yourself?”
After that, X said goodbye to Wade and before rolling himself out of the door, he turned to Yaël with his typical sweet smile.
, but I kind of need some proof for it, you understand?” he stumbles out. Dr. Cho doesn’t look up, instead removing the ninth shard.
“Yes, a bit, sir.”
And he means it.
FRIDAY adds, making Francis look up, much like everybody does whenever FRIDAY speaks out. It’s not often that she makes an ‘appearance’ in Stark Industries when Mr. Stark isn’t around, but somehow she seems to be following Peter around.
” FRIDAY adds. Peter sits up in surprise, dropping down the banana before managing to finish it. Then he looks up at the ceiling, shaking his head in panic.
Tony nods, turning from Steve to head towards the door.
Peter nods, agreeing with that fact. He’d been there during the protest, after all. She dragged the whole decathlon team along! It had been cold, snowing, and even Peter, who was wearing his suit underneath, was shivering from it.
When the two are at the kitchenette to start with the dishes, Peter sees Vision stare back at Bruce. He’s silently hovering in the air, probably not even noticing it, while he’s drying off one of the plates Peter’s just handed to him.
“I’ll get them in Peter’s bed. I’m sure he won’t mind,” he says. Hilde then rolls up her sleeves and walks towards Clint instead.
"I'm sure you've checked the news already?" Rhodey starts somewhere in the middle of their dinner. "Crowned favorite couple of the year, can't say it's really that much of a surprise, right?" Rhodey smirks at the couple seated next to Peter.
“Shut up,” he responds with red cheeks. Tony can’t help but laugh even more. He knows that Peter and Wanda will never be a thing, but he can’t help but want to tease a little bit about it. Peter’s probably not even ready to think about new romance, right now. It hasn’t even been a year.
?” he prompts. “Iron Man?”
He puts all the effort Tony deserves from him into choosing his costume and his character, mentally reciting the backstory he’s settled on just as diligently as he does when he has to go undercover. He spends an age in front of the mirror practicing introducing himself with his chosen name, repeats his date of birth, address and social security number until they feel natural, thinks up a whole load of tiny details Tony is never going to ask him for but will hopefully make his character feel less like a cardboard cutout and more like an actual person.
Sure enough, by the time the doors open in the lobby and Steve starts to steer them back to the party, Storm is smirking every bit as widely as Bucky used to whenever he came across Steve talking to Peggy. “So Stark thought I was you, right?”
If Tony wants Steve to dress up as someone else and act like they’ve never met each other before so Tony can pick him up at the Stark Industries party tonight and they can have pseudo-anonymous sex in the workshop, Steve’s going to do his best to make sure the experience is everything his boyfriend is looking for, and even if the pickup part feels strange to him he has absolutely zero complaints about the bit where they’re going to head down to Tony’s lab and…
Sadly, as Steve walks him to the elevator and they head back downstairs, he also looks like he’s working out things Steve might have preferred him not to.
The uniform came from Natasha, because of course she knows how to get a set of dress greens in precisely his size at almost zero notice. She didn’t ask why he wanted it, and Steve chooses to believe it’s because she’s respecting his privacy than because she’s already figured it out.
The glass walls of Tony’s workspace come into view, still transparent, not yet frosted the way they are when Tony wants privacy, and Steve finds himself faltering momentarily because that’s Tony, his Tony, and he’s got his hands all over someone who is
He’s at the gala before Tony, but that’s both normal for any place they’re travelling to separately and exactly what Steve was hoping would happen this evening. Getting here first means he can find himself a safe place to observe the room from, somewhere with poor enough lighting that no one will recognise him as Captain America (he considered adding something to help disguise his face a little, glasses or facial hair of some kind, but all he can picture is Tony leaning in for a kiss and Steve’s hypothetical fake moustache sticking to his face instead when he pulls back again, so he’s going without) and wonder why he’s in a uniform other than his usual red, white and blue, hopefully a place he won’t have to engage in too much conversation before Tony shows up.
, because he knows Tony secretly likes that. He’ll introduce himself with his admittedly unimaginative pseudonym, explain why fake him is there, and ask if there’s somewhere more private they can talk, at which point Tony will put the moves on him and they’ll advance to the part of the evening Steve is a lot more familiar with.
Steve isn’t entirely sure about this whole roleplay thing. He knows other people enjoy that kind of thing and he’s not one to begrudge anyone something they enjoy, but he’s spent too long on the USO circuit pretending to be someone he isn’t to really see the appeal in doing it himself.
is the kind of thing likely to get Tony in the mood, even if it comes with Steve’s very best attempt at a flirtatious
The only thing in Steve’s brain after seeing that is
Tony looks from Storm to Steve and back again, his thoughts practically painted on his face:
It’s just instinct to turn towards the speaker, one Steve has followed through on before he can think better of it. He regrets it, because he’s essentially confirming his identity rather than playing the part he’s assigned himself, then regrets it even more when he sees who has approached him.
“Yeah… I think that would be best.” Storm looks relieved, and not unreasonably so, given that he’s spent the last who knows how long being accidentally harassed by one of the richest and most powerful men on the planet.
Surely not.
“Captain Rogers?” says an officious voice, just as Steve is about to leave his safe corner to get hit on by his boyfriend.
followed by
Steve fidgets through the elevator ride, then practically marches down the hall to the lab when it stops.
No one but Steve, anyway, and he’s waiting until the initial gawking fades a little and he can get close without drawing too much of an audience.
“Who are you?” he demands coldly.
Tony opens his mouth to reply, probably not all that kindly, and it is definitely time Steve steps in, before Tony says something he’s going to regret later, once he figures out what’s going on.
, Steve thinks, trying very hard to work out if he knows anyone by that name. It takes a few seconds of mentally cycling through his friends and acquaintances to get to Johnny Storm, AKA the Human Torch. Steve’s never seen him without the flames, but since he would definitely have noticed if there was a man on fire in the room he has to assume he was in his regular human shape, which Nat and Clint have insisted looks weirdly like Steve.
Steve falters, just for a moment, and then Storm shoves Tony away, expression closed off, posture screaming an instruction to back off, back away, he’s just not interested.
Storm looks at him like he’s lost his marbles. “Johnny,” he says slowly. “I was introduced to you maybe fifteen minutes ago?”
It takes a moment for Richards to register that Steve has interrupted him, his expression so profoundly baffled that someone who didn’t know him might think this was the first time it happened.
“Well, we do look alike,” Steve replies, deciding feigning ignorance is absolutely the way to go.
It’s obvious when that happens, because the crowd parts like the Red Sea, everyone wanting to gaze upon the great Tony Stark, no one quite ready to be the first to approach him.
, the most brilliant man Steve has ever met, and in the unlikely event his brilliance fails him his ability to cause a scene is possibly even more legendary.
Storm nods, looking like he’s giving Steve credit for making the effort but absolutely not buying it. “Yeah, freaky, that, but he was also hitting on me pretty hard, and he was really surprised I wasn’t into it. Something I should know about that, Cap?” Just in case Steve hasn’t picked up on his meaning, he waggles his eyebrows suggestively, a gesture Steve finds frankly disturbing on a face that looks so much like his own.
Instead, Steve allows his attention to wander, Richards’ voice fading until it’s little more than background noise as Steve mentally goes over the next steps of his plan.
He’s aware it’s probably not what Tony would have expected, that Steve would approach this new twist to their relationship with all the same seriousness he has when he goes into battle. Then again, his friends insist on teasing him for his ‘Boy Scout preparedness’, so perhaps Tony knows full well that Steve has mental pages worth of plans, everything from what he’ll say to what he’ll do to how he’ll stand, not to mention half a hundred attempts to predict Tony’s replies and his responses in return.
Steve allows even more of his attention to drift away from Richards’ diatribe, his gaze roaming the room, looking for Tony.
“Sue said I was to keep Johnny out of trouble tonight, and I shudder to think what he and Stark might get up to if left unsupervised,” he explains, then immediately launches back into his unsolicited critique of the Avengers’ fighting style, still seemingly unaware of his audience’s complete lack of interest in the topic.
Tony would have noticed the man he was talking to wasn’t Steve, wouldn’t he? Even if he’s expecting Steve to be playing a role, pretending not to know him, he’d be able to tell the difference.
That, Steve thinks, is a very good suggestion.
“Did you see where Tony went?” he asks, cutting Richards off in the middle of a diatribe about how Steve shouldn’t allow Thor to spend so much time off-world, what kind of leader is he, etc etc etc.
(Well, he’s thinking it’ll probably start with him on his knees, and possibly finish with him bent over Tony’s worktable, but everything in the middle is still open to suggestion.)
Steve.
“Johnny Storm,” he explains. “The Human Torch, which might explain why you don’t recognise him?” He waits until Tony is frowning slightly less before crossing to Storm and saying, “You want to go back to the party, son?”
Unfortunately, Richards seems to be every bit as oblivious as Tony says he is, since he begins talking about the Avengers’ last face off with Doom and doesn’t seem inclined to stop anytime soon. Steve usually does his best to pay attention when a person thinks something is important enough to overcome their reluctance to bother Captain America – at least, he does if it’s not someone he’s actively in the process of fighting – but he has to confess he starts to tune out Richards somewhere around the time he starts pointing out all the things Steve’s team did wrong and all the ways the Fantastic Four could have defeated Doom sooner.
But Tony’s asked him if they can give it a whirl, and Steve… Steve loves him enough that, on the rare occasion Tony wants something enough to ask for it, he has to have a hell of a lot better a reason than not seeing the appeal to say no.
“Hmm? Oh, he and Johnny went in that direction.” Richards points, slightly further than the average person might be able to point.
He’s Lieutenant Steven Smith, recently returned from service overseas and instructed by the brass to use any means necessary to get Tony Stark to agree to design for them again. Not weapons, just body armour, because he doesn’t think
“Tony?” he asks a few seconds later.
Steve doesn’t roll his eyes. He wants to, definitely, but he doesn’t. “Tony
Steve doesn’t jump straight to panic, because Tony is a grown adult, more than capable of looking after himself. If someone tried to make Tony leave against his will, he would have done everything within his power to prevent that happening; maybe he’s not Iron Man without the suit, but he’s still
, which, as it happens, is spectacularly unhelpful, and definitely the fault of all that PR training Pepper and SHIELD have insisted on.
“Excuse me, Doctor Richards,” he says, more concerned about how Storm might react to Tony coming on to him than he is for any of the social niceties. “I should check on my teammate.”
“Uh?” Steve asks, not really understanding the metaphor. Tony just shakes his head.
Banner stops working and considers him for a moment. “You know, you’re really not as heartless as Tony always made out, are you?”
It’s a good idea as it turns out, other than the vastly increased rate of property damage that comes from housing heroes together. They all get along, more or less, and the collection of exuberant personalities help some of the older Avengers – Wanda, Rhodey, Bruce, Clint - not dwell as much on the ones they lost.
“Steve?” Pepper’s voice calls out from behind him. He turns around, and finds her with Morgan shyly tucked behind her legs. “You okay?”
Steve blinks. “Why? What did he say?”
“I – I don’t-”
Steve laughs bitterly. “I wish someone had told me that years ago, too.”
Steve exhales.
“Fuck,” Rhodey swears.
What – what do you mean –
The dream shifts, changes. Steve sees them seated all around him – the Avengers. They’re laughing together, years ago, crowded over a table at a small, dingy restaurant.
“Thanks, Nick,” Steve says, even though he hasn’t yet quite grasped what Fury is talking about.
“In Asgard, we celebrate, Captain,” Thor says gruffly. “For our friends have surely ascended to Valhalla, the hall of heroes, for their good deeds. And that is no thing to mourn.”
“That’s not fair!” Bruce howls. “He’s in my pants!”
“For what it’s worth, Tony would have wanted you all to get absolutely trashed in his memory. I believe he would have considered it an insult if you don’t cause at least two international incidents tonight,” she smiles. Thor claps her roughly on the back.
Steve looks around him. Most of the Avengers are here, and happy, and Steve wishes he could join them. But all Steve can do is think how much Tony and Natasha deserved to be here too, and there’s an invisible wall that seems to block him out from the others. Even their voices seem strangely out of focus and muted.
He’s been avoiding Bruce, because the mournful, disapproving look he knows he’ll get is a hell of a lot more intimidating on the Hulk’s features. Unfortunately, he gets called in to run tests with the transporter.
Steve sits in silence with that thought for a minute. “It doesn’t seem fair. He spent all this time warning us, and he had to die for it, too.”
“Sure you are,” Clint says. “And my mother’s the empress of K'un-Lun. Well, you don't know my mother, but-”
it says in brashly scrawled script, and Steve feels his throat constrict a little.
“You don’t need to remind me,” Clint says sourly.
“I will,” Steve promises.
“I hope you know what you’re doing,” Bruce says, measuring out Steve’s shoulders for some sort of calculation. “But,” he says, pausing, looking for something. “Ah. It's probably best that it’s you.”
“You truly are good, Steven Rogers,” Thor declares.
“We’re here,” Clint adds. “You know, or any of your other friends. We all deal with it in different ways. But we need each other. No man is an island, and all. I wish – I wish someone had been there to say that to me five years ago, to tell me to go to Nat, when I was dealing with the Snap. And now I can’t take back that time.”
“Sorry Captain!” she grins in reply, not sounding sorry at all. “I didn’t account for some of these magical energies in my calculations!”
He goes about life as before, but it’s off-colour, as though it were coming through a badly tuned television set. The world hasn’t yet righted itself around the five years of grief – nor is undoing that damage as easy as they had once thought. Some people didn’t come back. Killed at the wrong instant, in a car driven by someone who disintegrated or under the medical care of someone who was in the unlucky half. One of the men Steve went to support group with e-mails him, says he wants his advice – he has to choose between his new relationship and his old lover brought back from the dead. As it turns out, snapping the fingers of the Infinity Gauntlet didn't make all of the world’s problems go away.
Morgan is quiet and still, like Steve, but Steve doesn’t know whether or not she knows exactly what is happening. If she’s anything like her father, she’s smart enough to know. Maybe she’s not old enough to know how to process it yet. Maybe she’s not old enough to drink through the pain.
The funeral is just two days later - quiet, private and peaceful.
Steve holds up a hand. “I’m the only one who can lift Mjolnir,” he says. “I’m the only one who knows exactly what went wrong in 2012 and 1970 now that Tony is… gone. The other Stones are easy by comparison.”
“Tony-” he starts, then swallows, starts again. “Tony and I didn’t always agree on everything.” He pauses, words already betraying him. Everything he’s ever done for Tony is so goddamn inadequate, and now this, a final insult for Steve to toss onto the pyre.
“FRIDAY, override code B498-1-Stark-J-543,” he says, knowing the code by heart even though he’s only read it once. His heart is already beating faster than it should in the situation; especially when he promised himself he would only use this one in case of danger.
“Wade and I came by car,” Yaël adds. The others don’t have a way of returning home,
“Yeah, well, all of that aside, let’s get to the actual business, shall we?” Cho asks. Tony leans back in the bed, looking at the Doc and giving her a nod. He can sit back and listen for a bit. “Your vitals are currently normal. The results of your blood-tests seem a bit deviant, but nothing indicates that you are in direct danger. Despite that, the injection you’ve performed on yourself could have been extremely life-threatening to a point of paralysis had you missed your target.”
“If I must," Steve sighs.
“What was the other option?” Steve demands, talking over him.
“I’ll find a way back, Bucky,” Steve says. “I promise, no matter what happens, I’ll try to find a way back to you. This you, the one in front of me.”
“Damn straight,” Steve mutters, and Strange actually chuckles.
you. As in, past tense. What you need is too late buddy, sorry.”
“I’m so glad you’re not dead, Buck,” Steve whispers, and Bucky pats him on the head consolingly.
“That was not your decision. You would have done the same in his place. I know it.” Thor pauses, and looks out the window once more.
Bucky catches him at the end of a shift guarding the Stones, and pulls him aside. “You’ve been out of it for weeks, Steve. We’ve all noticed it.”
but it’s like, when I’m next to you and we don’t have these
He keeps walking. They form a procession behind him.
“You probably won’t have to wait very long at all,” Steve chuckles. “Time travel’s convenient like that.”
“But I’m getting off track, and back on this damned argument. Again. Why are we like this? All I want sometimes is just you and me, Rogers – Steve –
“We never truly know what we have until it’s gone,” Thor chuckles. “That is the folly of all beings, across all galaxies.”
“Come on buddy, wake up.”
“It is hard to celebrate when we have lost those we love,” Thor observes. “I almost think it fortunate that most here did not know them, so they do not mourn and suffer as we do.”
“We need to get you to a hospital,” Bucky says. “And most of these people, for that matter.”
Steve suddenly sees himself laughing with Tony and Nat somewhere on a couch, watching television with the other Avengers. He knows Strange is right.
Steve didn’t know the answer to that. All he knew was that the present didn’t feel like home to him at all.
“Me? I just want peace. But, turns out resentment is corrosive and I hate it.” Tony is watching the water shimmer on the lake. Steve feels overwhelmed with guilt once again, and grief for the time they lost fighting each other.
forward into Mantis.
Steve thinks. Tony talked about him to Pepper. Complained, probably. All this time, all these years separated and angry at one another seem so idiotic and fruitless now.
He remembers, so long ago. A decade ago, when they were both so much younger.
“You think he’d try to take her place?” Steve asks, casually.
“Don’t break your promise, then,” Bucky allows, smiling. “I’ll be waiting for you.”
“Spider-Man, get it together,” he snaps, and the kid wilts under his disapproval. Steve feels bad immediately. It’s hard on the kid too, being in an open training field with nothing to swing from. Completely out of his element. But he has to get used to it – that’s what training is for. So nobody has to die needlessly.
Bucky shrugs. “I mean you haven’t talked about her in a while, but I didn’t know there was someone else. In fairness, it’s been five years, and-”
“Sorry. Look, this clearly isn’t working with everyone doing whatever they want. Line up, and we’ll run some basic combat drills. And no talking, until I say so.”
“Are you alright, Captain?” T’Challa asks, and Steve snaps back to attention.
“Wise of you,” Strange murmurs, flowing down the staircase as though he’s walking on air rather than wood and carpet. “Or rather, wise of Banner, perhaps.”
Bucky looks alarmed. “Woah, there. It’s okay. Hey, I didn’t know this – you guys went to 1970? – Man, nobody tells me anything, but I guess that’s fair-”
Clint and Sam happen across him when he’s shooting mindlessly at targets.
“Steve,” Bucky says. He might have been saying his name for a while. Fondness for his best friend breaks through, overcomes him, and he gets up and hugs Bucky fiercely.
He’s halfway turned to the man beside him, before he remembers Tony isn’t there.
“I wish we could have done this while you were here.”
“What? I made it for you.” Tony says.
“Then why are you here?" Tony asks, slowly.
Steve doesn't know where his unkind thoughts come from. That Pepper can finally get a break, that Morgan won’t have to grow up with an alcoholic, irresponsible father. There’s an anger inside him that’s wholly inappropriate for a funeral. He’s so angry at Tony, and he doesn’t even know why. For dying? For leaving his wife and kid here, alone?
A weird expression crosses Bruce’s face. “And that’s… if you’re asking what I think you are. I mean, if you’re going to do that anyway. What’s another minor deviation from the plan, right?”
“The truth is I don't wanna stop,” he admits. “And to not die trying would be nice.”
“You stole that from Lord of the Rings,” Clint accuses, turning on him, and Sam chuckles.
“I can’t help it,” Steve admits. “I saw her. When I went back, with Tony. I saw her in 1970, and she was so beautiful, and I couldn’t talk to her, and I-”
. Just you and me, doing something together, something stupid like going to a museum or fighting an army of a million slugs and that sounds
“What is it?” Steve says, frowning.
“Well,” Bruce sighs. “You gotta love Thor, but he’s a bit of a hazard these days – the racoon told me he barely got them through their mission to Asgard, and Thor was sober at that point as far as I’m aware.”
He pauses for a moment. “And Loki,” he murmurs quietly. “My foolish, brave brother.”
“What does that mean?” Steve snaps. “We
“I – suppose. Black, please,” Steve says, nonplussed. Strange ushers him through to a sitting area, the antique armchairs far too beautiful and expensive looking for Steve to feel comfortable sitting on. Strange procures a teapot from the air and delicate matching tea cups alongside it.
"Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're gonna have to make a choice,” Tony says, eyes on something in the distance. Steve feels like a ghost to him. The anger, frustration in him comes like nothing he’s ever known. He wants to scream, so he does.
Steve wants to feel a drive to do something, anything, but protecting the Infinity Stones becomes his only reason to get up. He thinks more and more of Peggy, and Tony, and of how he did wrong by both of them. If he took the Stones back, was there a chance he would see Peggy again? Could he see Tony again in 2012, and apologise – even for something he hadn’t done yet?
“You weren’t at training,” Steve says mildly.
He watches the scene play out like a movie, the grieving boy, the sobbing wife – widow. The sobbing widow. Tony’s dead, the smile fading from his lips, the light gone from his eyes.
“I do.” Steve replies, and twines Tony’s fingers between his.
“Thank you, Thor,” Steve says, clinking his glass against Thor’s oversized tankard. Thor smiles at him, and gets up to join the others. “Who wants another round?” he roars, to cheers and whooping noises.
Too late to do anything. Tony’s already halfway to ash.
“I didn’t send him to die.” Strange rebuts, irritated. “I told him there was one outcome I could see from that point, and of millions of possibilities-”
Sam shrugs. “We only have the time we get given, Steve. All we can do is decide what to do with it.”
“Your pretty speech over Stark’s corpse implied you would.” Fury says, turning to face Steve properly for the first time. “Something about protecting the Earth, if I recall?”
Bucky sits down next to him then, just waiting with him in silence for several minutes. Finally, he turns to Steve, metal hand clenched tightly around his drink.
Steve frowns. “What do you mean?”
“It’s going to be me,” Steve says, final. It’s the first time he’s felt like their leader in a while.
“There are so many universes,” Strange starts. The scene shifts, and he’s there again, in a different place and time, with Thor beside him. Now Bucky. Now Hulk, and Natasha.
Unbidden, Pepper’s voice comes back to him.
“In another time, perhaps,” Thor says sadly, shaking Steve’s hand with the aggressive motion of someone who never learned how to do it properly. “And - there’s one more thing that I may have forgotten to mention.”
He writes two letters. One to Sam and Bucky, and a shorter one to the team.
Strange sighs, and puts down his cup and saucer on the table. He waves his hands about and creates a portal, through which Steve sees himself – a version of himself. The background is foreign, but it’s definitely him.
“I won’t,” Steve says firmly.
Thor considers him, and nods. “Thank you for being a friend, Captain.”
“I wish there had been some other way,” Steve whispers.
“To our fallen comrades,” Thor says solemnly, when they have gathered. “We celebrate our victory and mourn your loss. Vision, our wisest friend. The Black Widow, our kindest Avenger. And Iron Man, without whom none of us would be here today.”
“Of course,” Sam says softly. “Just letting you know, if you need someone,”
“Yes,” Thor says, mournfully. “The Trickster God, mortals call him. I know he caused you pain, I know he did wrong, but-”
“What is this about, Steve?” Bucky asks. “If you won’t talk to me – I know this sounds stupid, but when I came back – in Wakanda, they have people you can talk to. They have psychologists here, too. But they really helped me, like you wouldn’t believe.”
There’s a pause, as though this dream-Tony is assessing Steve’s reply.
He bolts awake in the middle of the night, Nick Fury’s words coming back to him. The clock on his bedside table reads 3:03AM in glaring red letters, and Steve sighs and rubs his eyes.
He tells the old team that he’s going to take the Infinity Stones back on his own.
“I appreciate that,” Steve says slowly. They walk off, leaving Steve alone with his thoughts, but he’s barely picked up his gun when he senses someone else emerge from the shadows.
Strange smiles, that irritating, arrogant smirk that seems to imply he knows all the secrets of the world.
“She moved on though, right?” Bucky tries. “I mean, she had a husband. And kids. It wasn’t like she spent her whole life waiting for you, Steve.”
“This may surprise you,” Fury says, addressing the lake again, “but I was actually quite fond of Iron Man. You know, we talked once, years ago, and I knew then that it would probably end like this.”
Yaël could not think of any other reply than just sticking out her tongue.
Peter turns back to the café, seeing the people inside laugh at some sort of joke somebody said. Even Natasha is smirking a bit, though she rarely laughs fully, even with the Avengers.
?” talking to Fury surely wasn’t as pleasant as talking to X. Fury sounded way more…restive. Probably because he didn’t like her anyways.
“I don’t tell them.” Nope, nope, that wasn’t right. Steve shouldn’t hide his relationship from everyone.
He can understand the tests they’ve been doing. The blood reports indicate strange valuables that seems to change with each test, stabilizing more and more towards the end until it comes close to resembling a normal blood report.
FEAST is located in an old school. A couple of the old classrooms have been used as sleeping-quarters, but most of them serve for specific sessions. They could be something creative, or something informative. FEAST’s purpose isn’t just to give the homeless shelter, but to also help them back on their way.
“Okay wonder-trio, what’s with the staring at my junk?” Tony suddenly asks with no shame at all. Natasha doesn’t need to look up to know Steve’s face is already red. “I mean, I know I pack some good stuff in there but I thought you knew you won’t ever get it?”
“I- I will,” he promises. Peter squeezes his hand again and goes to sit back down on his chair, shuffling it closer to Tony this time.
“So, since when exactly did the Goblin escape?” Peter tries to ask the moment they touch ground on the roof. So far they haven’t been spotted yet, but he knows that it won’t be the case for much longer. As he speaks, he hears his voice shake a bit, revealing a sudden emotion he knows hasn’t subsided yet – it probably never will.
“Language, Peter,” Steve adds with an annoyed face. Peter ignores him.
Gwen shrugs. “Venom from another universe. This is Peter,” she says, introducing Peter at last. “He’s your-“
Before she knew it, she was undressing in the fitting room. Wade kept throwing in clothes. Somehow, he knew her sizes exactly, which was a bit freaky as Yaël didn’t even know them herself. He was right, though. She deserved some new clothes. Being a teacher, she couldn’t walk around like a complete sloth, just because she didn’t have the money to buy stuff before, right? Plus, this was an excellent distraction.
“I suppose it’s time to leave,” Bruce adds to that. He takes Peter by the shoulder and nods to Vision. “Where’s the exit?”
Now he quickly understands how it got its name.
It’s when he’s out of the room that he notices something hanging on the front door. It looks like a letter, maybe? Peter blinks once before walking up to it. Standing in front of it, Peter recognizes Johnny’s messy handwriting.
Chapter warnings:
“The toaster would not need an AI, per se-“
Now, he knows it’s Ned. Because Ned has selected his own personal ringtone on Peter’s phone. While everybody has the tone Gwen chose all that time back, Ned has his own little tune that would warn Peter immediately that it’s him. It was
“Wilson, you mean? I don’t get it, everybody finds him annoying but he’s been nothing but kind towards me,” Steve says with a frown. Peter snorts. Tony is still half dead next to him.
Id-Jit: Peter finally finishes his bot.
“So you’ve had a crap week,” Tony mutters. Steve just snorts ironically.
“Why?” he asks, curiously. MJ just shrugs.
- Criminal Steve
“No, it’s alright. Jim has already offered to help me with it,” she says happily. ‘Jim’ is May’s nickname for Rhodey. “The loan you gave me is help enough, Tony.”
“You’re right,” he mumbled. “Maybe I should just stop going to church, right?”
close to punch you right in the face, so don’t tempt me further.”
“Oh, Jesus… I’m not a go-“
And he tells T’Challa so. He agrees.
When he hears a light snore, Steve looks back up.
“Sure, why not? You want to join?”
“That’s different,” Peter whispers at him.
Yaël started making contact with the water to attack the green weirdo as she saw someone else sprint towards Peter too. It was a blond, shorthaired man with a bow lifted in his hands, ready to shoot.
Peter opens the door, but doesn’t say anything. Rhodey gives him an unimpressed look.
“Sure, but after last night it brings up some questions into my mind that I’m not sure I want to know the answer to,” Tony admits. He looks up to the ceiling, leaving a hand on his chest while the other one goes behind his head. He hears Steve sigh again, but where he thought he would have reached out for him, now Steve just copies Tony’s position. Once they’re side-by-side, on their backs while looking at the white ceiling, Steve finally holds out a hand, keeping it up in the air in Tony’s eyesight.
“You weren’t taking this seriously!”
FRIDAY explains. Tony sighs, putting his hand behind Peter’s head while he rocks him up and down.
But this girl had a little problem with impulses. In her anger, because she wasn’t finished with raging just yet, she called another number. As soon as someone picked up without saying anything, Yaël calmed down. Rage made place for shame as she didn’t dare to say a word anymore. She almost hung up again, but X started talking.
He continues the game without explaining anything to Johnny, who walks to the couch to grab the phone.
He’s taking it back into his hands.
“And he kicked our asses, in case you hadn’t noticed?” Rhodey counters.
“You’ve been…
“I can go home,” he mutters out. He didn’t even have to build that machine. Hell, he’s been hacking through SHIELD’s files and he didn’t even need to. Quickly, he turns towards Steve, taking his hands into his own. “I need to go, Steve.”
Steve frowns, pointing a finger up at him. “Listen up, Stark, I don’t think
Oh, it’s Steve… For a few seconds, Tony stops, looking at the figure on the ground, spitting away some blood.
“Who do we have here? Care to join us in the next match, mini-Stark?” Clint jokes without removing his eyes from the screen. Peter, who has just entered the room with a bag of chips in his hands.
Tony nods. “Yeah, but I didn’t miss, did I?” Tony returns. Natasha rolls her eyes. Clint snorts.
Chapter warnings:
“Ah, you know,
“Eh, it’s not
He wonders how he’s going to get there, though. He can’t just walk in there as Peter Parker, now, can he? But going in as Spider-Man would mean that he’d have to walk through the forest after the buildings stop. Maybe he can just get dressed on his way after he gets out of the taxi?
“Why are you even interested? I thought you didn’t like me that much?” Peter asks then, trying to get something out of Happy now that he’s actually gotten a few words out of him.
“Alright,” he says. Then he stands up. “Alright, now I’ll have to face my- uh- Steve…”
she responds. “
“Yo Peter.”
“So that’s why Charles told me he felt a bit suspicious about you!”
Yaël turned around, almost feeling the steam coming out of her ears, and faced her students.
“I love you, too, Tony,” Steve mutters out. The arms around his shoulders let go as Steve stumbles over his edge. He can’t help the small groan coming out of his mouth. He presses his head on Tony’s chest, feeling his heartbeat calming down under his ear.
“I thought I was born without any powers… That’s why I’m not always that good at controlling them, I gained them too late I think,” she mumbled.
“I’ll bring you with my motorcycle,” he said while washing his hands “I always have a spare helmet with me.”
“What’s going on here, are you keeping Ned from hanging out with me?” Peter asks, putting his hands on his hips as he tries to look taller than he is. Like this, he only realizes all the more how much smaller he is in comparison to Flash.
So instead of talking with Aunt May, Peter takes his jacket – since it’s softly snowing again – and walks towards the nearest subway station. The drive to the cemetery isn’t a long one, and nobody’s paying attention to him while he’s walking through the different graves around him.
his mind feels obliged to remind himself. “Now, let’s get started.”
“You have a son? That wasn’t on the internet?” he asks. Tony just snorts.
“Do you think somebody poisoned him?” she asks with a shaky voice. The way she speaks, Tony can tell she’s trying to hold back her tears. He’s not going to comment on it, because he’s pretty sure he’s in the same state.
She seems to catch his nerves somehow, because her eyes rest on him for one short moment and then she drops the papers away and gives him a long apologizing look.
“Oh I wish your Uncle were here, he would be so proud of you,” Aunt May continues on. Peter catches the tears in her eyes, and wonders if it really was such a good idea to tell her already. Especially when she starts pressing a few kisses on his forehead and keeps his face in a strong grip to keep him from pulling away.
“Yeah, been busy,” Tony says, leaning against the wall. Peter frowns when he sees the massive black eye he’s sporting. Holy crap, he’s been busy, indeed!
“IF HE’S LIKE A SON TO YOU, YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE LEFT LIKE THAT!”
“Intern!” Peter shouts out, interrupting Gwen before she can say it. It’s instantly, a reflex, but one Peter doesn’t regret. When Gwen gives him a confused look, he shakes his head.
“Fuck,” he grits out. Steve gives a strong thrust. Tony literally cries now from the sudden shift.
“Uh, hi fellas! What’s going on here?” he asks casually, trying not to think too much about the fact that there’s a gun pointed at him.
“I, uh, last I remember I was about to attack a giant wolf on the Bifröst. Did we lose?”
“Never mind,” he muttered out. “It’ll pass.”
Peter sighs but shakes his head.
“Not on ‘dad’-level yet?” Yaël asked.
“She’s not in town,” Peter clarifies. “There’s no-one else at the compound qualified for this.”
“Wouldn’t that be the best cliché?” she suddenly asks. “The guy and the girl get back together in the end, and they forget everything that happened?”
“Nothing yet. Short of travelling back in time and prevent Thanks from ever getting all these Infinity Stones,” Loki offers.
“T’Challa planned for this. I didn’t know you were here. Wakanda, of all places?” He shakes his head, lets out a shaky breath, and then he turns around on the spot. He only manages to make two steps before he’s stopped again. Steve’s strong hand is on his arm, his skin burning Tony where they’re touching.
“Uh, that’s MJ,” Peter answers in response. Harry lets out a loud breath.
? What’s going on?”
“Hey Karen,” Peter greets the AI the moment the mask is covering his face.
“Well, then, I suppose it’s time for lunch. C’mon, team!” Clint calls out. “Bye Pete, we’ll see you in a bit!”
Everybody nods in understanding. After all, Thor is a king. They couldn’t expect the guy to just drop everything and come and pick up his friends. It’s still weird, in a way, to have two king-friends now.
“Of course, he wouldn’t be Tony Stark if he wouldn’t want the serum out as quickly as possible,” Banner continues. He takes the papers back from Peter and then leans back against the glass fence.
having to talk about it. The only reason she has it is to make sure James isn’t going to go crazy from the lack of it.
Peter turns to look back at his Dad, seeing him laugh with the King and Natasha. He looks happy, for a change. It’s really good to see him like this.
“Everything alright?” Peter asks, a bit concerned as to why Steve would drive all the way here. The man just nods and lets out a small chuckle.
“Steve, you go to bed, I’ll take over” she says without even looking at Tony. Steve sighs but stands up, giving Tony one last glance before heading towards the door. When he passes Natasha, the woman stops him shortly to give him a light kiss on the cheek. Then she whispers something to him, which Tony can’t hear.
“Yeah, a daughter. It’s a girl, we called her Zoey,” Francis says, looking proudly at the same picture before putting his phone away. Then he clears his throat and looks back at Peter. “Listen, it’s probably not any of my business, but Stark’s been treating you right, right?”
“Then what makes you keep on thinking he’s suffering from it? From what you’ve told me, the only suffering he’s been doing is to be apart from you. There’s only one thing and that’s you, Tony. Nothing else.”
“This spider is not going to sleep until she knows her nephew-spider is safe,” she says. “Go on to bed, we’ll bring you guys up to date tomorrow.” Barnes leans forward to kiss her on the cheek before he follows Clint and Sam to the door. They nod towards Scott and Hope.
“O-okay,” Flash stutters out. He jumps out of the Audi and instructs his date to do the same. The blonde girl looks extremely annoyed at that. Peter smirks once he’s behind the wheel. Just to get some payback for the past few years, he ‘accidentally’ bumps up against a few parked bikes and a trash can.
“Uh, alright,” Peter says, and in obvious hesitation, Peter reaches for the door and opens it up. When he’s outside, he waits for a little moment longer before closing it again and starting to walk back into the apartment complex.
Peter catches up with the classes. He might have missed a semester, but it’s still easy enough to follow. With the agreement that he’ll do those exams he’s missed anyway later in the summer holiday, Peter’s pretty sure he can finish this year easily.
He gets his plate, receiving a friendly look from the lady who serves it. Everybody is
son.”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks, clearly unsettled.
“Sorry I’m late, I had to do some last-minute shopping,” he says holding up the bag.
Steve sniffs. There’s the first tear already… He hates feeling like this.
“And then there was that attack, and you got separated from us,” Aunt May then continues. “We looked everywhere, but all we heard was ‘Iron man is here, Iron Man is here!’, as if his presence should have meant that we were all saved.”
“You sure I can’t ask you to let me in?” he tries.
Tony nods shortly, remembering indeed how he went to Washington after hearing what happened, but refusing to see Steve empty-handed so he went on a wide search for the shield. When he’d been in the hospital room at last, he’d been shocked at Steve’s state, never seen him so beaten up. That had also been the first time Tony met Sam Wilson, who had been waiting for Steve to wake up.
“C’mon Johnny, I don’t want to go to that stupid party,” Peter returns. “First day of school starts tomorrow and I need to be awake for it. Besides, you know I can’t drink!”
“Nobody knows,” Yaël returns. “Heimdall thinks it has something to do with the heart of the dying star restoring itself. The whole deal about this hammer is still pretty much unknown to us.”
Peter can’t read the rest of the article when it ends on the page. He’s sure there’s a continuation to it, but it’s not on the backside, and where-ever the journal is, it’s not here. Peter puts it back down and takes a step back from the desk, passing his hand through his hair while resting the other on his hip.
“Thank you, Mr. Stark,” Peter answers shyly, accepting the pen Tony offers him and then signing his name. After that, Tony offers him another empty form where he needs to fill in his own stuff.
“Uhm, let me see… Null, en, to, tre, fire, fem, seks, syv, åtte, ni, ti.” Wade clapped for her way to enthusiastically
Aware that there’s no micro around them, and that nobody can hear them, Tony whispers in Peter’s ear.
The two give each other a wide smile, and then they continue their dinner. Tony doesn’t touch his glass at all, his mind on Peter each time he eyes the red wine inside of it.
He’s done some crazy shit to get his high. It’s also the reason he got himself admitted after a while. Or… well, that’s on Obey if he’s completely honest. That traitor has at least done one good thing for him, though surely he’ll find out it was for selfish reasons if Tony digs deep enough.
Since Yaël still wasn’t able to drive a car, she had to take a bus. Luckily Stark Tower was so important in New York that many busses had a stop in front of it. Charles disappeared again as soon as they got off. Yaël walked in and immediately moved towards the elevator.
.” Rejected again, Yaël sighed. Great, this way she’d never be able to pay her bills. Well, she couldn’t even pay the psychiatrist, the one who should help her getting her shit back together actually gave her even more stress. She had been counting her saved money again and again, but it simply wasn’t enough.
“I don’t really think it’s my place to give you a hard time about that, Peter,” Tony says, hating himself for it because he knows he’s right. He’s got no right to scold Peter for punching another kid, no matter how much of a bully he is.
“Yeah, she said she needed some time with her people again.”
But after a while, they must continue, and Peter is put back in his seat after Karen urging him on to listen to the big guy who’s speaking. Peter heard him say his name in the beginning, but he has absolutely no clue what it was.
“This won’t take too long,” he assures him.
Peter nods. “Sure, have a good flight.”
“Oh, Peter, did you need something?” he asks.
“Peter, honey, wake up,” Yaël heard someone sob. The question echoed in the dark. Suddenly, Yaël started seeing a few shims, that colored clearer and clearer the longer she looked at it, like it was some sort of Polaroid-picture.
Tony doesn’t speak, instead just walks up at Rhodey and wraps him into a tight hug as a greeting. It’s strange, but at the same time extremely relieving to see the guy stand up on his own two legs again, without the help of his high-tech prosthesis.
“Oh, you haven’t met her yet?” Wade asks. Then he’s finally trying to move from his ice cold prison, but obviously isn’t able to move. “Come on, I want pizza. Yaël, get me out of here!”
Though Steve noticed a bitterness in her voice. He knew Pepper hadn’t reacted too well about the new suits, and the Iron Legion. She had even returned to Malibu for a few weeks after the repairs were done. The only reason she was in New York right now was because of a series of business-meetings she had to attend as CEO of Stark Industries.
“Okay okay, rewind, not only do you know practically
“Yeah,” Wade added “I heard he was is a pretty bad condition.”
“Oh, hi,” Peter greets her with a smile, holding up a hand in a wave. In all honesty, he wouldn’t have thought she’d even talk to him again. “How are you?”
“More impulsive than your Dad?”
Maybe he
After the game of laser tag with Wanda, Peter and Vision (who, according to Yaël, had been cheating since he can walk through walls and so randomly appear to shoot at someone), they all went to the living room.
Falcon picked the Goblin up again and pulled him back in the air. Yaël looked back to see what was happening to Peter. Bow-guy almost got him out of the water. Then, all of a sudden, something happened above her in the fight between Falcon and Goblin which caused a big blow. Dust flew into Yaël’s eyes. As she rubbed her eyes, cursing, she heard a weird swirling sound, getting louder and louder. Out of the blue, Yaël got knocked against the ground.
“Ah, yes, I suppose it’s about time I get to visit Aunty Peg as well,” Tony says, grunting when he stands up from the couch. Peter sits up before falling down now that his support is gone, and drops the tablet.
Next to the compliments, she understood the med-thing. She had forgotten her sleeping-pills that night too and that had given her even more complications than just waking up next to her friend. Not that she was minimalizing his reaction, though.  His pills-flaw just gave him a totally different error than hers, though they both ended very emotional after that situation.
They look scared, shy, but at least healthy as much as they can be while being stuck in a burning building. The younger boy starts rubbing his eyes, drying away a tear.
“N-no-“
“Now, for crying out loud,
- Super Soldier Serum. Think about that for a moment.
“I, uh,” Ned says unintelligible, but Peter then cuts in.
Bruce sighs, giving Tony an apologetic look before lowering his head. “All signs lead to it, yeah,” he admits. “Though we still don’t know for certain, and there’s still many more tests we should do before we can get to any form of conclusion.”
Anything more, at least.
Steve nods, though only hesitantly. Tony stands up on the tips of his toes and presses a gentle kiss on Steve’s forehead before pulling away completely.
Tony jokes. Peter snorts in response. It’s good, having Bruce with them again. It lightens the mood a little bit at home, and Bruce is also good in keeping Tony in line whenever he’s neglecting his health. Whenever Tony starts a discussion, Bruce just warns him about feeling green again. After that, Tony always listens.
“Yeah, well, I can see the resemblance,” Bruce says. Then he stands up, dropping his empty cup of tea down on the table. “Now, Dr. Strange, is there anything else you need? Or am I allowed to take my best friend’s son back to his home?”
Tony goes through most of the journals, coming to the conclusion that these have all been written by her. That means that they still have Richard’s files to look for. He pulls the box towards the door, making sure that he’s not going to forget them here. As if on cue, a text message comes up from Steve.
They must’ve something to do with why Fury doesn’t like her and why she is locked up in this ugly ass cage.
And when Peter feels relaxed again, at least as much as possible, he opens up the door and gets out of the stall.
“No way,” he mutters, jumping inside of the building. He drops down next to the man with Dr. Strange, who is creating some weird orange symbols that give light out of his hands. Peter would have been more impressed, but there’s no time for it right now. “Dr. Banner! Where have you been!” he shouts.
Of course Yaël did know who it was. She quickly threw the sponge back into the sink and walked to the door. There was no time for awkwardness, anger or disappointment, as soon as Yaël opened the door, Steve took her in his arms and hugged her tightly.
At some point, Peter had told Yaël about his past, the whole messed up stuff with Harry and Gwen… That was a true eye-opener to her. Peter was no regular kid, she always had known that with the Spider-Man stuff, but his emotional baggage was way heavier than she had thought. This kid grew up too fast, which explained his responsible behavior. But he also managed to stay kind and humble, of course he was also sarcastic, but he never meant to really hurt someone. So at that point, Yaël started looking at him like he was an equal, like he was twenty-four too. Not that she ever looked down at him, but he suddenly wasn’t a simple teenager anymore to her.
Yaël had seen Scott talking fights out with the kids too, he had a lot of patience for them. She, on the other hand, was very bad at comforting people. It was like the students could feel that, because they never went to Yaël with their problems. Maybe that was for the best. Yaël could imagine herself panicky patting someone on his or her shoulder to comfort that person and then trying to get away from the conflict because she wouldn’t know how to handle.
together. Tony brought in big buckets of popcorn, and Steve brought the drinks. Peter takes place on the left side of the couch. Tony is next to him, leaning against Steve as the two share their popcorn together.
Steve sits down next to Sam on the front row. The priest starts talking, but all Peter can think about is his father next to him, at the verge of tears but unmoving to say the least. The thought came to him that it’s a bit of a dick move of Steve to sit away from him, but Peter quickly counters that thought; he’s heartbroken as well. Both are grieving about her passing. They’ll probably need a little bit of time.
“The action’s just coming from everywhere, isn’t it?” he asks as Sharon starts to collect her things. She just laughs nervously.
It didn’t take her too long to fall asleep herself.
“But if you do, why did you break up with me? Why did you sleep with me one moment, and then dump me the next?”
?” he asks with a clear urgency in his voice. Steve seems to startle upon hearing his name. Once he sees Tony there as well it seems like he’s hesitating on going his way or staying where he is.
“Hah,” Yaël answered “I thought you knew that I knew and I really didn’t mind so-“
“If you want, I have a couple of good doctors who could take a look?” T’Challa asks. Tony blinks twice before shaking his head.
“FRI, give me some music, please?” he asks. By now, she’s probably given up on trying to get him to change his mind. Without any further objection, she starts up ‘I walk the line’ from Johnny Cash. It’s a strange choice, but it’s fine enough.
And Steve smiles slightly with his eyes closed, one of his hands going up to Tony’s hair to pass his fingers through it. Tony likes that, after all.
Or if it’s even a good idea to share the information with him. Surely, Peter probably already knows, if that DNA-test is something to go by, but does he need to know that Tony knows?
“Tony,” he says, trying to get his attention. Tony looks up at him, trying to figure out if Steve is disappointed in him. “If I understand correctly, you say it’ll happen, but not in the coming few years. Am I right?”
After the subject, Yaël and Logan both waited until all the students were gone, like normal teachers do. They packed their stuff and walked out, Logan first and Yaël right behind him.
Much like the fact that he feels tired 24/7, or that he keeps on being spotted on patrol without remembering going. He doesn’t want to alarm Steve, so instead he told him about school, Aunt May, Shuri fixing Rhodey’s back.
Norman stops his movement, now instead staring at where Mary is touching him on the arm. Tony is pretty sure that he’s frowning, though he can only see his back. Good, Mary’s making sure that he’s not turning around.
“Dude, who shat in your coffee this morning?” Peter asks.
And much like Thor suspected, the preparation of the great hall had been finished. There are white drapes all around, flowers, candles, and even a few golden ornaments. The many chairs don’t look that expensive, but the thrones on the other side of the room does.
“So… you’re lying to Iron Man now?” he asks, not understanding. Peter sighs again.
He gets dressed quickly, making sure his hair is not too much of a mess. Then, in a hurry, he gets out of the bathroom to grab a quick breakfast. He’s glad he packed his bags yesterday, so he doesn’t have to worry about that anymore.
Tony shakes his head. Better not, too. Tony doesn’t want to end up like the Osborn-kid.
Steve nods hesitantly. He gets another quick kiss from Sharon before the two of them get out of the elevator. Sharon quickly winks at Tony before the doors close again. He notices immediately when Steve lets out a relieved breath.
“Yeah, thanks! I’m Peter,” he says as an introduction. The girl gives the hand an amused look before taking it.
And everything froze again. Yaël turned her eyes and stopped walking since Raidowasn’t able to follow her anymore.
“2016. He’s the one who approached me,” Tony answers truthfully. He knows he could screw up the timeline like this, but as horrible as it is to say, it’s not like Mary has long left to cause a catastrophe. “Listen, I know that you never wanted me to know about him, but things are as they are and I love him more than anything in the world.”
“I’ll explain it to MJ, you’ll get Dr. Banner?” Harry asks. Peter nods, leaving his room again to get to the workshop. Bruce is there almost all the time when he isn’t in his guest room in the apartment downstairs. He’s got a whole floor to himself, according to Tony the same one he had when the Avengers used to live here, still.
He didn’t listen.
“’Mornin’,” Yaël mutters while getting herself to her coffee machine. Peter gives the purple-haired girl a long look, raising his eyebrow at her while she grabs a mug from the counter.
So, yeah, maybe Tony might have a little collection of his relationship with Steve stashed somewhere in his hard-drive. It’s actually quite lucky that the back-up is stored in his mind as well.
“We just need to know, Nat! It’s fifty bucks!” James complains. Natasha rolls her eyes.
Pepper asks. Peter can’t blame her; after all, he never really calls her up for a chat.
It’s not shouted, nor actually spoken. It’s almost as if it’s coming straight from his head. Tony looks around for a bit, seeing nothing other than stars. He reaches out a hand, and much to his surprise he can actually take one of these stars between his fingers.
“Excuse me?” she stammers out. She takes a quick look inside the house, as if she’s heard something. Nothing happens, but she doesn’t seem to lose her guard a she gets herself outside and nearly closes the door behind her. “Listen, Tony, I know you miss me, I miss you, too. But I just can’t do this anymore.”
“Sam, watch out!” Wanda had yelled at him as she was just going to send out a force of energy, but he wisely closed the door immediately after he almost got hit by one of Yaël’s ice-spears.
Maybe he should just bail today, right? Stark didn’t look all that well today, either? Maybe they’re both just not… ready for it. Maybe they won’t ever be ready for it? Maybe it’s better if Peter just keeps this to himself, right?
He’s not surprised when a large gun – is that one from Natasha’s collection? – is pointed at him. Barnes is standing on the stairs, Steve is still on the ground, keeping his shield in front of him. Tony can see him lower it the moment he sees him walking inside.
“What was that for?” Peter asks in a huff. The Cat lowers his mask again, giving him a light smile.
love him, he didn’t have much else to say. After all, when he was the one in Peter’s shoes, he didn’t need people coddling over him all the time.
But, why is Peter feeling so strange, all of the sudden? Almost like… he’s excited or something?
Pepper shakes her head. “Tony was never going to sit by and watch other people save the world for him, Cap. You know that as well as I do.”
This time, Tony is sitting across the table from him, in one of the meeting rooms of the Compound. Steve opens his mouth to say something kind, but Tony attacks him before he has a chance.
The last dream he has, Tony is sitting on the edge of the same pier where they held his funeral. Steve sits down on the pier next to him, his jeans sinking into water that isn’t wet, or cold. Everything is unnaturally still. Steve wonders if this is Tony’s heaven, or some version of it.
“Do you trust me?” Tony asks, finally.
“Well,” Bruce says finally. “If you’re going to take them back, you should talk to Strange before you leave. His teacher is the only reason I know we have to take them back in the first place. He might know something else important, in case we screw it up again.”
“Steve, I don’t know if you’ll get this,” Tony starts, then pauses. “Look, okay. I know, this will sound stupid, but things just don’t seem to be working out lately, and sometimes I worry you’ll die, or I’ll die, and we’ll never kiss and make up, and honestly? I’m right, Rogers, and you’re an arrogant prick, and if I die at least I’ll die with you knowing that I was right, but-”
Strange laughs. “What isn’t? The millions of other possibilities and universes are just as important as ours. Every choice you make is far more significant than that of the average man. Ideally, someone should have infinite knowledge for such a life.”
“No,” Strange replies. He’s looking at the tea as he pours it, but Steve thinks he sounds a little regretful, at least. “I knew this was how it was going to happen. But if I had told him, he might not have done it. Or perhaps; the path where it happened was the one I didn’t tell him. But he knew just before it happened. For what it’s worth, he seemed at peace with the realisation.”
“I’m just telling you this because Stark was too proud for his own damn good,” Fury says, and sounds sad for the first time. “And because you were right. Stark would have wanted the Avengers to go on. So I’m here to tell you that the Avengers will go on, and you can be their leader if you want it. If you don’t, we’ll have a problem, because I can’t trust any of these other idiots as far as I can throw them.”
He swivels on his chair and yells at the doorway behind him.
He gets more than a few dark looks, but they follow his instructions without complaint.
After the blank, gloomy apartments Steve has been staying in, he finds himself strangely enamoured with Strange’s home. Perhaps it’s the smell of dusty books that reminds him of his old life, before the war. Sunlight streams through the windows in an ethereal orange light, and Steve reflects that when he was younger he might have been more astounded by being in the presence of an actual wizard. He misses that easily impressed innocence, like his past self is someone foreign to him now.
It’s the eleventh hour, and Steve has drunk a fair bit. More than a fair bit, with his metabolism. But he feels stone cold sober as he opens the envelope from Tony. It’s not a letter, as Steve expected, but a thin USB, comically low-tech for Tony’s tastes. He probably would have thought Steve wouldn’t have had much by way of modern gadgets. But Steve still kept all the tech Tony had given him a decade ago. After all, it was Stark-made; they still worked like a charm, even after all these years.
Steve almost regrets coming. “Whatever you think is important, then.”
“What just happened?” someone asks beside him. Steve’s vision blurs.
War Machine lands beside him, and grips Steve’s shoulder with his armoured hand. It’s too strong a grip, and yet not strong enough - a poor shadow of another hand, in another metal gauntlet.
“I know. But…” Steve picks up his tea, and sips it. It’s the perfect temperature, naturally. He feels a little resentful that some people can have magic abilities like that. “But it just doesn’t seem fair - why that was the only option.”
It’s Steve’s attempt to do what Fury wanted and lead a giant team of heroes, but he feels rudderless, overwhelmed by the change in numbers and dynamics between people. Everyone starts chatting to each other and showing off, and Steve feels himself grow more irritated by the second.
Bucky looks scared, and then resigned. “It’s your life, Steve. You’ve more than earned the right to do what you want with it.”
Strange considers him for a moment, holding one hand upwards and twirling magical symbols around his index finger. “Many things you should know, entire libraries of things. A few vital things of importance, but none to do with time travel – or perhaps everything to do with it. It depends, I suppose. How much you want to do, or not. Everything depends on the human heart, in the end.”
of two lives, one lived and one unlived. Steve doesn’t know whether he needs to just let the dead lie. What was the right thing to do – to give Peggy the love story she deserved? To make sure he didn’t fight with Tony in other futures? To save Bucky from ever becoming the Winter Soldier, or SHIELD from Hydra agents, or come back to this time and keep fighting for justice here?
“Indeed! Lady Stark speaks truly. Let us celebrate with joy the lives of our fallen friends, and the victory they brought!”
“Losing someone just as you reconcile with them - I know what that’s like too.” Steve wishes he didn’t.
“The Ancient One knew that the condition of giving you that stone was that you would return them to their rightful place. A universal constant, you see? At least, if we can help it. Other things don’t matter as much – other things shift and change, but some things affect the fabric of reality more profoundly.”
work, and I’m not crazy, and I know you feel that too. And then it’s like-” the Tony on screen snaps his fingers, “-wham, suddenly we’re at each other’s throats and everything is going wrong, absolutely everything in my life, and in the world, and with the Avengers, and I don’t even know why. I don’t know why you can’t just. No, okay, that’s not fair, we’re both stubborn idiots. We both fucked up. I guess what I’m trying to say is I miss you, and it’s not the same without you. And I hope one day we can get over this garbage because it seems pretty insubstantial compared to us working together as a team. I feel like – we could have been really close friends, you and I. And if I die, that’s pretty much the only thing I’ll regret.”
“I was thinking,” Bruce says, “I wanted to get a message to Nat.”
He takes the body to the ruins of the Compound. The Avenger ‘A’ has cracked in half, and the image somehow finds a new way to break Steve’s already aching heart. He climbs the ruins, lays Tony’s body at the top of a mound of rubble, and turns to see a constellation of faces staring up at him from below.
“Thanos killed my people before the snap,” Thor says, his voice heavy with grief. “The Asgardians who fought him didn’t return when Bruce undid that. I lost – my brother, and – Heimdall, and -”
“I’m so fucking torn up about Nat I feel like going back to being Ronin,” Clint admits. “Killing people, to feel like I’m avenging
When he sleeps, he dreams of Tony as he first met him. Obnoxious, arrogant, infuriating Tony Stark, the Helicarrier a blur around them.
“He isn’t – wasn’t – my closest friend,” Steve says, bemused. What was Strange talking about?
“It wasn’t the only option.”
“Alright,” Steve says. “I know. He sacrificed himself for us. I know that.”
“Do you?” Fury asks. “Do you know how much he actually cared about all of you? About you, Captain?”
“To Tony Stark!” Rhodes shouts beside him.
“Would that be a bad thing?” Steve says hesitantly. “For Rhodes, I mean.”
“Yes. They’re right,” Wanda says sadly from behind him. “But it’s not too late, you know. For you, years ago.”
“Did Tony know?” Steve asks, suddenly, remembering. “He said that you knew how to stop it, that we had one chance. Did you tell him he had to die?”
He turns to face Steve, finally, searching for words.
“She got the job done, and most of us are still here, so why are you complaining?” Fury replies, eyebrows raised. “Lord knows you have made the wrong decision enough times now to be a little less arrogant.”
Steve and Thor sit in silence together, watching the rain. Steve feels closer to Thor than he has to anyone in a while. Finally, Thor breaks the silence.
“That’s noble of you,” Steve says mildly.
“Well,” Tony replies, looking at Steve with exasperated fondness. “I got your second chance right here, Cap.”
Steve doesn’t argue. He sits down on a broken wall, and stares at his hands. When the medics eventually come for him, spirited there by Doctor Strange or some other power, he knows not – when they come for him, they find him unresponsive and unwilling to leave. If he leaves the battlefield, everything really will be over. If he leaves Tony’s body, he might not ever see it again.
Steve waits.
“Then there’s Clint, and he’s good, but too compromised by his guilt over what he feels was him killing Natasha – not to mention he’s not as superhuman as the rest of us,” Bruce continues, mildly. He’s typing numbers into a keyboard now, and a hologram of some sort of schematic beams into the air between them.
“Hello, buddy,” she says fondly before walking off. Peter smiles at the sight.
Than the sun"
Summary for the sequel:
With his hands in his pockets and his eyes looking down at the ground, Peter isn’t really aware of what’s happening in front of him, which is why he’s taken by surprise when he suddenly walks up against somebody.
Also, I'm sorry I'm giving you all this drama. Things really are going to get better after a while. It's just not SOON
“Shit dude, I’m sorry I wasn’t looking where I was walking,” the woman says. Peter’s eyes meet her greenish-brown ones. She looks tired, smelling of alcohol. Peter just clears his throat, watching her black hair move in the wind.
Why did she follow this big old raisin? He was even making her feel awkward, dammit!
Maybe it would’ve been better to go outside, but Yaël really didn’t feel like it, so she quickly grabbed the vodka ant went back to her living room and sat down. This wasn’t right, she thought as she put her forehead onto the cap of the bottle. When she opened her eyes, she saw the number of Peter’s therapist laying on her small table. This was her last option, she had to make the phone call.
Now I'm just about ready to sleep, I've almost fallen asleep three times in the past half hour, so it's probably time. My bed is already inviting me back in!
Then Happy hangs up, and Peter rolls his eyes again. He leans a bit to the side to check along on the holographic map coming from the device.
Peter turns around when he hears his name called out. A few times, he blinks. For one part because the sun is almost literally blinding him, but secondly because he’s not really sure who is talking to him. It takes a few seconds for him to place the neat brown hair and the dark blue eyes of Felicia. It’s strange, just for a second her voice sounded like that of… no way, not possible.
“Steve, honey, can I just have a quick word?” Tony calls out, nodding towards the door.
Suddenly, Yaël’s surroundings changed. Tony, Peter and Steve turned to shades and then disappear to make place for a new shade. Again, after looking at it for a few seconds it became clear: it was Peter falling. Now, Yaël really, really wished she could look away, but she had to be cursed, because the only thing she could look at, was how Peter knocked against the ground in a murdering tempo.
Steve’s memory has always been exceptional since the serum, but he’s never realised what a double-edged sword it could be.
“Say it,” Steve says, his hands shaking as he sets down his tea.
Never one to mince words, Nick Fury.
“I’m home,” Steve says, simply. In that moment, in the logic of the dream, it is somehow true.
Pepper has words of thanks for everyone who has come together for him. She never wails, or weeps, just smiles through glistening eyes and looks peaceful. Perhaps there’s a part of her that can finally rest now that she won’t have to wait and wonder where her husband is, and how he’s doing. Whether he’s alive or not. For his part, Steve doesn’t cry at all, doesn’t even come close to it. He feels like the Tony Stark who laid down his life is a total stranger to him suddenly, given tribute in this small wooden house on a lake in the middle of nowhere. His wife and kid and shed full of gardening tools make him look like he had the life of any other ordinary American man.
friends, Fury. I know how much he cared, alright, I know we both screwed up, and now he’s dead and I can’t change any of it, so what is the
He doesn’t open the envelope. One morning, he holds it in his hands, turning it over and over like he used to turn over his presents before Christmas. But just like a Christmas present, he feels like something important will be lost once it’s opened. Maybe it’s just Tony swearing at him. Maybe it’s just a single photo of Iron Man with his middle finger pointed up. Until he opens it, Steve can pretend there’s something that will give him closure, will make the wasted time they spent fighting justified somehow.
Steve leaves the body there, and stumbles down the rubble, tripping on his way down. Bucky is there to catch him and hold him upright.
“Dad’s the best Avenger,” Morgan says, and her round face breaks into the first smile Steve’s seen on her. “You’re Cap, a stinky mean-face. He told me who you are.”
“Huh?” Steve asks, but when he turns around, she’s gone.
didn’t choose to end half the universe. You can’t help your ignorant actions, your path, or your heart. You were born into this new time too late, and you fought with Stark too early. None of what happened is your fault. It’s simply the flow of events and consequences, nothing more.”
After those incidents, they work on the transporter with renewed conviction, ever paranoid that someone will eventually fight them for it and win. If they wait long enough, Steve is sure the forces of some distant galaxy will come to claim their prize – even if there’s clearly no match for the Avengers on Earth.
“Your caped crusaders did what they had to,” Steve says, coldly. “Nat and Tony – they gave up everything for it. Why are you here, Fury? Are you going to ask me to bring the band back together already?”
“I get the feeling you’re going to leave me waiting for a long time then.” Fury walks away, then pauses and turns back.
“Then you know why I cannot look them all in the face now, and pretend I am fine,” Thor says seriously. He sips at his can again. “Before, I would numb the pain with games and drink, and somewhere in my heart I hoped Loki was just playing dead. Or that we could undo all of Thanos’ evil. But now we have, and I am none the richer for it.”
“A word of advice; sometimes you have to go back before you can move forward. I won’t hold that against you. But others might. Be kind to them.”
“Everyone just moves on,” Thor says. “Everyone else got back those they lost.”
“Thor.”
“What can I say,” Fury says, turning back towards the house and clapping Steve on the shoulder. “You’ve earned it, Captain. Think about it, won’t you?”
Steve smiles. “We’ll always be friends deep down – the six of us. I wish I’d known what we had, back at the beginning.”
