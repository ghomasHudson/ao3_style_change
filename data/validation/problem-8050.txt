“Stop,” Tony gasped, waving his arm in the air.
It was also clear that neither man was aware that the new feelings they were harbouring were reciprocated, but they needed to figure that out for themselves. Steve tucked his legs up on the chair, twisting around to press the side of his face to the leather wing, eyes fixed on his two best friends.
“Oh.” There was a whine of helicopter blades, and Tony cursed. “They’re coming back.”
Steve snorted with surprised laughter, then broke into full, chest-shaking peals. He reached out and hauled Tony into his arms, throwing him over his shoulder until they were both laughing. “Alright, mister.” He stood and headed for the door, Tony in tow. “I think we have several weeks of cuddling to make up for.”
The penthouse freezer didn’t have anything good in it, so Tony trotted down the few flights of stairs to the shared floor. Bruce and Thor had done the shopping this week so it was sure to be sugar heaven. It wasn’t surprising to find Clint perched on one of the kitchen stools, flipping through a book. His insomnia was even worse than Tony’s.
“Well now I’m cold. Come back up.”
Two, that he'd turn out to be, by far, the smartest student there - possibly even smarter than the teacher.
And again.
“Everything is just fine, Mrs. Barton. Thank you again for opening your home to us,” Steve said politely,
Strucker sneered. “This seems to be the only way to get rid of you, Captain. You have some blessed life that stops me from killing you, but I don’t need you dead, I just need you gone. So…” Strucker stepped forward and the four HYDRA agents restraining Steve backed him towards the cryo chamber. “Have a good nap.”
“Of course I am, frequently and without remorse. He gets all kinds of special attention.”
That's it for Starkbucks bingo! Yay!
“Goddamnit!” Tony swore. “Will you just -”
Steve peeks over his shoulder then smiles. “That colour suits ya.”
“Some of you are going to have to share,” Laura said, offering the table an apologetic smile.
“Awfully forward,” Tony teased.
Fluff, family, outsider POV, surprises.
Tony didn’t let go of his hand. “You’re welcome.”
"You know…" Tony breathed. He took Steve's hand. "I find I really, really do." He stood, and Steve drew his hand to rest on his stomach, palm flat, warm.
Steve slipped his leg between Tony’s and stroked his fingers up the back of his hair again. “Oh yeah?” he hummed. “I’ve got some plans of my own, mister.” He grinned when Tony’s hips rocked forward a little. “Also, I’m pretty sure they’re called ornithologists, not owlologists.”
Steve snorted. “Your toes are always ice cubes.”
Results from this experiment have been disappointing at best. Subjects are widely disparate in terms of vital statistics and sexual performance. It's entirely unclear if this is an accurate subset of Earthling representation.
The breeze picks up again, and Tony rubs his hands together, curling over himself to try and shield his naked body. He’s in an alley, it seems like, or behind an apartment building. There are metal dustbins crowded up against a brick wall, dry leaves, and old, crumpled newspapers collected in nooks and corners. Tony has the urge to open one and do the classic time travel check, but he doesn’t have to, he knows where he is.

“You know flour isn’t a dangerous contaminant, right?”
"Tony?"
“Yup.” Tony peeled the top off a container of fried rice and handed Steve chopsticks.

“Oh… uh…” Tony twisted out of Bucky’s hold and shuffled awkwardly. “Great.”
He laughed and clapped the man on the shoulder. “Thank you. Your performance was delightful. I guess I’ll just have to wait and see who it was from. I hope they make themselves known to me soon. I’d very much like to thank them.”
Steve gripped the back of the office chair in front of him. He needed to just say it and get it over with. He'd already wasted enough of Tony's time. "I'm really sorry," he started with, "to interrupt your work day, like this. I wasn't really sure when was a good time."
A loud buzzing shocked Tony out of sleep and he blinked around in the dark for a moment before he realized it was his phone ringing. There were only three numbers programmed to override his do not disturb.
Steve leaned towards him, hesitating this time, but when Tony tightened his hold on Steve’s hand and leaned in too, Steve tipped down the rest of the way and pressed their lips together. This time, Tony was able to sink into it with nothing but pure pleasure, all the fear and guilt gone away. Steve wanted this, wanted
Bucky climbed onto his knees on his own bed and looked out the window to watch the snow pelting down. It was Christmas Eve, and neither of them was going home.
Tony stretched, everything snapping and popping the best way possible. He arched his back, unsticking his sweaty skin from the sheets. Bucky and Steve were flopped out on either side of him, Steve’s fingers on his wrist and Bucky’s ankle hooked over his. Satisfied didn’t even come close to covering it. Tony grinned up at the ceiling and let his eyes close.
But for now? Tony sipped his wine with a soft smile.
"I'm thinking like the next ten years. Maybe fifteen."
He’d told Pepper that night on the phone.
They slammed together, the drug in Tony's veins singing again, cock hard and leaking where it was trapped between their stomachs. He jumped up to hook his legs around Steve's waist, and Steve set off, carrying him towards the elevators, mouths locked together. "We should tell the others… possible alien invasion…" Steve muttered between kisses.
Steve searched the apartment, but it seemed Tony wasn’t here. Then he saw the light spilling out of the bedroom door. “Tony?” he tried again, pushing the door open. And there was Tony, laid out on his bed. He was unnaturally still, not curled in a ball like Tony normally slept, but sprawled out on his back, arms folded over his stomach. “Tony!”
Steve looked back at the painting. “It can wait. I mean, it won’t ruin it if I don’t finish it now.” What was happening?
“I know. I need that.”
Tony took a deep breath and looked up, ready to confess, but the words died on his lips. “Is that a cat carrier?”
And why couldn’t it have been
"Probably…" Tony's eyes were still stuck on the hallway where Bucky had just disappeared.
Bucky sighed, but whipped his spatula around the bowl vigorously, nearly spraying cake mix across the kitchen counter. Steve yelped and smacked his shoulder, but when Bucky stopped, sure enough, the batter was smooth.
Basic Measurements:
"No thank you." He glanced at Tony as he disappeared through the doorway and his expression broke Tony's heart.
“It will be. You’ll see.” Bucky patted him on the shoulder then turned back to the bowl. “Okay. Read it out again.”
Steve gabbed an afghan off the back of the couch and slipped out the door after him. Tony’s head popped up at the noise, over the back of the swing.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and kissed across his bow, down his cheek, and along his jaw to his throat. “We have to start celebrating your birthday right at midnight. It’s important.”
“Oh. My ex.” Tony flashed the handsome hunk a smile. “He’s gone. Out of the picture. No more. Hurricane’s all mine.”
Steve turned to look down at Tony and caught the wicked gleam in his eye. “You don’t think I give you special attention?” he shot back.
Tony bounced on his toes, his stiff leather shoes creaking from disuse. He tugged his cuffs down to his wrists for the seven hundredth time. He could hear the murmur of voices from the other room; his entire family was gathered in the hall - aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents - and Tony felt the pressure of several generations resting heavily on his shoulders.

Laura and Steve’s voices rumbled outside, but they were talking too quietly for Tony to make out the words. Steve was out there, though. This time, he was sure. He stood up and shook out his arms like a boxer getting ready for a fight.
“Yeah. That’s all it is.”
"So, uh. I came to ask you if you could help me figure this thing out." Steve held up the tablet with a sheepish grin. "Maybe we could grab dinner and you could tell me all about the years I skipped?"
"Yeah, same knee is acting up. From the thing with the car." People swarmed the set around them, resetting and adjusting things. Claudia appeared at Tony's side wielding a makeup brush and Jeffery was already re-swooping Bucky's hair. "That was good, though."
"Oh, no. Uh." Tony landed next to Steve and flipped the faceplate up. He dropped to one knee and watched as Steve looked down at himself with dawning horror.
His voice made Steve jump. Tony had known he was here all along. The open door started to take on a different flavour.
He paused outside the window and couldn’t help watching for a moment. This man - he didn’t even know his name. He looked at the chart a nurse had hurriedly scratched out, flipping to the second page. Steve Rogers.
"Where does it go?" Anthony's face came out of Steve's shirt.
"Tony. What are you doing?" Steve asked from the couch in his living room.
"I'm okay." Steve took a moment to really think about it when Tony's brows creased. "I really am. I mean this isn't - I -" Steve stuttered around admitting that he'd pictured this, them together, but not in this way, not when it wasn't this choice. But it seemed he didn't have to say it.
JARVIS's subroutines informed him that it was time, once again, to run a complete self-diagnostic. He activated the necessary processes and redirected resources from unnecessary tasks to ensure the self-diagnostic was efficient and complete.
"Mr. Stark, as per my programming, I must report an error with my self-diagnostics."
“Thank you.”
“Okay? Are you kidding? This is -” The back of Tony’s eyes prickled, and he let out a tense breath. “This is really all I’ve ever wanted. Family. If you’re willing to let me share yours.”
Tony let out a shaky breath. That was - that was good. “Okay, yeah me too, like way too much probably.” He snuck another chaste kiss before shifting out of Steve’s space in case anyone had their camera phone out. Steve set off walking again, Tony’s hand still caught in his. Tony wiggled his fingers until they were wound more firmly together. Steve’s hand managed to fit perfectly in his.
There’s a blue wire and a red wire. Tony cuts the blue wire.
“Isn’t it about time you took a rest?” Tony called, and Steve’s head twisted up from where it had been bent over a fluffy, green bush.
He didn’t want to wake Steve, and he didn’t know his apartment well enough to know where he might find another blanket, so Tony curled up under his sad little corner and tried to sleep.
“Oh, come now, between friends. You two are…?” Greg raised an eyebrow, and Steve scowled down at his drink.
Steve shrugged and forced himself to stay where he was. "Been better."

And he did. He knew it the second he looked up and locked eyes with the man he was destined to be with. He just didn’t expect it to happen in the emergency room of Mercy General at two in the morning on a Wednesday.
Just a little thingy that fell out of my brain.
Tony shrugged. “Apparently.” It felt more like a question -
Tony started laughing, and Steve was briefly distracted by the way the corners of his eyes crinkled. He could see why Tony had earned his playboy reputation; he was painfully attractive in person. “I’m not going to call the cops, ‘Captain’.” He smirked, and Steve’s breath caught.
The room fell silent, neither reaching for more food.
Tony wasn’t that different from being there with Tony, plus everyone else. Clint sat in Bucky’s lap and whispered thing in his ear that made him laugh then punch Clint on the arm, but Tony didn’t sit in Steve’s lap. He pulled his chair close when they sat, and only rested a hand on Steve’s forearm now and then, but for Steve, that was almost as much as a lapful of Tony. He was so close, smelled so good, and his fingers kept petting over the petals of the flower in his lapel.
Tony gathered Steve up in his arms and fired the repulsors. He landed on the tower's landing pad and walked right into the penthouse where he deposited Steve on the couch. "So what can I get you, my dear? Juice? Tea? Grilled cheese? Hot water bottle?"
Tony wafts the puppy in Steve’s direction, making her floppy ears bounce. “What do you think?” Tony asks, sighing, eyes still fixed on Steve. “What should we do?”
“You’ll never believe what happened,” Tony said. “I was just giving a ticket to
"Don't be sorry, Tony," Steve said. "It's okay." He cut off with a gasp as the creatures started moving Steve closer until their bodies were a scant few inches apart. Steve loomed over Tony, their height difference maintained even with the tentacles supporting their weight.

Or he wasn't there.

Tony doesn't like Steve.
“If I take you across the street for a burger, is it going to ruin this, or can it wait?”
“Come here,” Steve whispered, drawing Tony back down onto his chest. He rolled them over until Tony was on his back, caged in Steve’s arms. Steve drew a line of kisses along Tony’s collarbone. He breathed him in. “You smelled different, under the spell. Now you smell normal again. Like home.”
The dance was hopping already. There were tables surrounding a huge dance floor and a live band. The dance floor was already full, couples and groups bouncing and swaying to the music. Their group claimed a table, and Clint dragged Bucky off to dance with a smirk.
“He’d come too, if you asked.”

A tiny compass appeared in the corner of the screen, and Steve pointed east, headed for the water. Once he was free of skyscrapers, Steve took a chance to look around and really take in his surroundings. The sky was clear and bright blue, though off in the distance, Steve could see the dark roll of a threatening storm. The water was rough today, dark and white-tipped, but, encased in the gold-titanium alloy, Steve couldn’t tell if it was windy or not. The armour seemed resistant to being pushed off-track, the repulsors firing alternately to keep him steady.
Tony knew, consciously, that it was only his brain projecting his own fears on Steve, but he couldn’t help but hear those words over and over in his mind in Steve’s voice. He was trying. He was trying to do more. But he kept failing.
Tony threw his pen aside. “You weren’t listening, were you?”
He didn’t know Steve that well, not yet. They’d been working together for a while, but Steve was hard to get close to. He was closed off and quiet - always polite, but Tony could see more and more the toll that playing everything close to his chest was taking on him. And he didn’t seem to have someone, like Tony’s Pepper and Rhodey, to vent to, to be himself with, to leach some comfort from.
Tony nodded.
A cloud of gas exploded from the fox and obscured everything in the room. It lined Bucky’s throat and he coughed violently, waving his hand and trying to find clear air. There was a loud creak of a window and the gas started to float out of the room.
“You really didn’t, doll,” Bucky insisted. He set the pretty cake box down and popped the sides open to reveal the most beautiful cake Steve had ever seen. Smooth white icing was covered in a web of perfect, sugary caramel, and it smelled heavenly, like white chocolate and sweet buttercream.
“More critical than… getting your driver’s license address changed?”
“Cap!” Tony screeched over the comm, but Steve didn’t have a choice.
Tony shook his head. “No, I don’t. But don’t think it’s anything wrong with him,” he hastened to add. “I’m sure he’s a great guy. I mean, if he earned your affection, he has to be. But I can’t be around you two together right now.” He tipped his chin up and met Steve’s eyes. “I’d just managed to work up the courage to tell you how I feel about you when you started dating him. I don’t handle jealousy well, Steve, and I really, really don’t want to ruin our friendship because I can’t fake it around him. I think it’s best if I back off a bit until I have some time to process this. Some time to get over you. It’s not your fault or his. I just -”
Steve put a flat palm over his forehead. He was still burning up. “Tony you have to take your medication.”
They'd used condoms. Steve was on the pill. And yet.
Steve has a mission that doesn't go quite right.
At nine-forty-five, and without a single letter added to his crossword, Steve decided that if Tony couldn't go out for dinner, Steve could at least bring something down to him, maybe bask in his company for a little while. He couldn't reasonably call it anything other than basking. He groaned and ran a stiff hand over his face. Why couldn't he just man up and tell Tony why he wanted dinner to be
“-ck,” he finishes, in 1941. His stomach lurches as if his lunch was teleported two inches to the left of everything else of his, and then he looks down and realizes something else is missing entirely. Apparently, the Time Bomb doesn’t do fabrics.
"Oh." Tony frowned and shifted away a bit. "Sorry. I was just teasing, honest. I didn't mean to bother you."
Steve rounded on Greg, mouth opening, a threat and a plea both trying to squirm out of his throat at the same time. But Greg cut him off.
But Steve laughed, creases crinkling the corners of his eyes. “It’s fine. I’m not much for ceremony, anyway. Thank you, Tony.” He gestured towards the small stage at the back of the room, unused chair piled up on it. “Want to sit for a minute?”
“What?”
“What do you mean, lumpy?” Steve leaned over the bowl, and Bucky poked the mixture, raising doughy clumps to the surface. “Hmm. Stir it harder, I guess.”
“Me too.” Tony kissed him again. “Of course, I didn’t feel the need to replace you with a hundred little, yellow, furry butts.”
Steve had come so many times, he could feel the slickness of the slide into Tony, fluid leaking out with every pull back and dripping down their thighs. The tentacle around Steve's cock, squeezed and rippled, stroking the base as he pulled out and massaging Tony's insides when he plunged back in. It managed to shift and move so that Steve could feel the full, hot clench of Tony's body while adding slithering pressure in all the right places.
“So… it was a date?”

The song cut off abruptly; Tony’s hands stilled. They both sat in silence for a long time, unmoving. Finally, Tony whispered, “I don’t know how it ends…”

“No, no. Don’t be sorry. I’m so glad you came. So glad.” Tony reached out and twined his fingers with Steve’s, thrilling when Steve held on, squeezing Tony’s hand. “You really want me? I leave dirty towels on the floor.”

Steve sighed. “Yeah, I’m home.” He didn’t sound quite right.

Tony stared at Steve a moment longer then suddenly staggered to the side and sat down hard on the edge of the desk, his hand coming up to scrub over his face.
He had a feeling he knew what Steve had seen, so once debriefed, he took the elevator up to Steve's room and knocked on the door.
Steve swallowed heavily and focused on the road, worried that if he let any more of his brain think about Tony’s tongue stroking along the underside of his cock he’d come right then and there. Steve glanced over to where Tony was twisted on the seat and saw the bulge in his pants that said it wasn’t just Steve who was enjoying this. Tony moaned, the vibration making Steve gasp and kick his hips up, and Steve couldn’t resist dropping a hand to Tony’s hair.

He could see Steve and Bucky up on the beach. Bucky was sprawled out on a lounge chair, fitted swim trunks hugging his thick thighs, bare chest glistening with sweat. Steve - his beautiful ass on perfect display as he bent over - was delivering a piña colada to his boyfriend.
“Mr. Stark!”
Tony blinked at him. This conversation had taken a wild turn. “So you’re not dating?”
Steve shrugged. “Okay. I’m going as far as Oak Hill. You’re welcome to join me as long as you like. Or if there’s somewhere you want to get off, just let me know.”
“No way. You’re a pretty adorable drunk, though. I’ll admit that.”
the hugs more than anyone else who said, "for exam luck!" and laughed as they quickly pulled Steve in with one arm then released him again, or the shy ones whose friends pushed them towards him. Tony was always in a hurry, always stressed, always had at least three bags - heavy-looking bags - and his smile never reached all the way up to his eyes, at least Steve had never seen it do so, but they were usually covered by dark sunglasses, regardless of the weather.
A flash of lighting was followed by a low rumble of thunder, and Steve watched Anthony's tiny hands flex against the glass of the window. Rain pummeled the building, the loud rush of water blocking out every sound except the ceaseless rolling and rumbling in the distance. Steve leaned against the wall and took a sip of his tea. "What do you think, bud?" he asked.
“I don’t mind.” Thor made his way around the room. He lifted the glass bottle from Steve’s drink. The label was peeling a little and underneath he could see a second label - the real label. He tugged the fake label off and read what was underneath.
“Because you’re brilliant and amazing and kind and this -” Tony grabbed his ass again, and Steve smacked him away, laughing.
Nose rolls over, clutching his face and wailing, and Tony pushes to his feet and grapples with Giant Forehead. Steve is fast in his grip, grunting and whacking at anything his short arms can reach. He’s holding Forehead off, Tony has to give him that, but he’s not making much headway, and sheer righteous fury is only getting him so far.
In the video, Bucky put the phone to his ear. A moment later, he smiled. He turned away from the camera, but his voice came through clear as day. "Hey, baby, how are you?" A pause. "Tony just left. Do you want to come over now? Class is over in an hour."

“Wanna try it?”
Steve traced the curve of Tony’s lips with his eyes.
Steve lights up, beaming, glowing, and Tony likes to think that he’s happier now, that even though that kid in the alley had no idea what horrible things he was about to face, go through, that Steve’s come out the other end happier. “Oh, good,” he says softly, Brooklyn accent leaking back in at the edges, and now Tony’s smiling too.
“Next year, though,” Bucky said, curling around Tony from behind. “Next year
Bucky led the way to another door that looked like a closet, but when he opened it, music, smoke, and laughter poured out. Steve stepped through, and it was like stepping into another world.

It was nice to have a lazy Sunday at home, the team spread around the tower but still together. Nat knew Clint was on the roof, Bruce was in the gym, Thor was in his room, and Steve and Tony were behind her, bickering good naturedly over a chess set.

Steve sighed. They actually did look really comfy. He grabbed the last pillow and the duvet and shuffled off the edge of the bed. He snuggled up against Bucky’s back, tucking the duvet around all three of them. Tony purred and reached around wildly until Steve grabbed his hand and wound their fingers together, resting them on Bucky’s hip. He nuzzled his face into the back of Bucky’s neck. The soft, gentle presence of the two of them made all the tension melt out of his body.
The director appeared at Tony's side. "We're starting on page 147. Ready?"
“You’re The Captain, right?” Mr. Stark went on. “Saw your tag on the factory in Brooklyn. I especially liked the one of me but my suit is made out of money. Classy. This one’s good too, though.” Mr. Stark pushed off the wall and walked over to the mural, stepping up close to peer at it, mumbling something else about “red.”
It was more a promise than a kiss, but Tony still flushed from head to toe. All he could do was nod.

The whole set went silent. "Um," said the soft voice of the script supervisor's intern. "I don't think that's the line?"
The shower, on the other hand… Tony dropped his clothes in a haphazard path to the shower stalls at the back of the locker room. He was hard before he even turned on the water, remembering how many times Steve had pinned him to the mats with his ungodly thighs. This crush was getting slightly out of Tony's control. Steve would always be, first and foremost, Tony's friend and teammate, but the fact that he was also the focus of several frequent and intense fantasies involving candlelight, a fireplace, and a bear skin rug, made it hard to remember that sometimes.
Tony swallowed heavily and worked his eyes open bit by bit until he found Steve’s soft, blue gaze blinking back at him. Though, there wasn’t much blue left with how blown-wide his pupils were. And it was

Captain America having a temper tantrum at Tony Stark’s wedding probably wouldn’t go over too well.
“I’m not hungry.”
Steve made his way to the doorway then stopped, stunned.
God dammit. How much time til you publish?
Steve reached across the table and gave Tony's chilled hand a squeeze. "Hey, I get it. I used to be really scrawny, really sickly. No one wanted to hang out with me either. It'll get easier, when you're a little older and there's not such a big gap. And hey, I have a few friends who are seventeen - I just turned nineteen, but my friend's sister, Natasha, is your age, and I love hanging out with her. You could come to our parties."
Tony sniffed back some emotion that dared to leak out. “It’s fine.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“That’s alright.” Steve dropped his cheek to the top of Tony’s head. “This one’s on the house.”

catching the dog under his arms as Tony caught him the same way. “Rowdy! What are you doing here - get down!” Rowdy dropped his paws to the floor and wagged his whole body, wriggling his way around the two of them. “What’s he doing here? I thought you were coming straight here from work?”
And his mom had been right. It felt exactly like coming home.
"It's a problem?" Bucky's stomach was starting to twist. Tony seemed upset, but he didn't know why.

“Oh. They were going to call you.”
He watched Tony spin Justine effortlessly around the dance floor, dodging her gown with grace. That had always been the difference between them, between him and Tony. Tony was graceful, suave, charismatic.
Fluff!
Steve was only gone for six minutes.
Steve nodded, but the movement was short and sharp, barely more than a twitch of his head. Tony’s soulmark ached.
“Two sugars,” Steve said, then he stilled, heart dropping down into his shoes. It took a moment for what he’d said to sink in, but he saw when it clicked and Tony looked up from his phone, brow twisted in confusion.
"I'm such a goddamn coward I waited until I knew you wouldn't be able to answer the phone to call. Fuck… Yeah I've been tracking you. Bet you love that too. I dunno, Maybe you do. You probably like that I care where you are. I don't know if that pisses me off or - Fuck..."
Steve’s fingers ran through Tony’s hair, and he whimpered and pushed into the touch. The stone floor was so cold and Steve was so warm. “I know.”
It’s a long time before Steve pulls back, licking Tony’s taste - coffee and peanut butter and quite a bit of mud - off his lips with a happy sigh. Tony is blinking at him like he’s been struck across the face and he can’t remember which way gravity is supposed to go. He’s got the puppy up in front of his heart like a shield. She flops her mouth open and grins at Steve, tongue lolling out. Steve bends forward again until his forehead kisses Tony’s, and Tony’s eyes flutter shut for a moment.

“You’re doing great. Try going up a little higher so you don’t have to worry about buildings.” Tony’s voice was crisp and clear through the helmet speakers.
“Just tell him the truth, Tony, and you can look for her together. I’m sure she’s fine.”
Tony was too asleep to remember and hold him to it anyway.
Steve continued his path around the room, until his gaze settled on yet another table that was situated up on the higher level, but set away a bit from the main press of bodies. There were four men at this table, also dressed more finely than the others, but with an air of propriety about them that had Steve wondering how they were connected to the club. He knew Fury was the manager, though he'd never met him, but Bucky talked about an owner too, frowning every time he did.
Steve propped himself up on one knee and folded his arms over the back of the seat. "Still want to share my outlet?" He bit his lip and raked his eyes down Tony's body. He really was even hotter in person, and that was saying something.
"Alright, I'm getting you coffee."
He had to fight.
“I want a divorce!” Tony proclaimed followed by a rustle of fabric that sounded an awful lot like him being gathered up in super soldier arms.
“I want you,” Steve said firmly.

“Oh god.”
Tony rubbed the scrub brush over the plate without paying it any attention. It was clean now, but he kept tracing careful circles around and around the china, the warm, soapy water, long having turned cold and greasy, but he couldn’t find the energy to turn the tap on again.

Steve stood and held out a hand. “Okay, Tony. Marry me?”
The heart Tony was no doubt handing to the Prince right at that moment.
“Noooo,” Tony whined. “Tog. Hi.”
We're back! After a hiatus for work and school and life and pets, we are back into Trouble. There's no telling how often we'll be able to post, but here's a Little Bit. We missed this family too much! This is set just before the move from Steve's apartment to the new apartment.
Tony barely had time to wonder before the creature who had abducted him advanced again. "No. No. You keep your slimy tentacles to yourself. Put me back. Right now." Tony scrambled backwards until he hit the wall, but the creature didn't seem to care about his movement or his words. It stretched towards him, unhesitating, and curled a tentacle around each of his wrists.
Happy Ults Day!!

Tony panted around the gag that stretched his lips wide and rolled his wrists in the restraints that locked behind his back. Steve’s big, hot hand stroked up the length of Tony’s cock again, and he moaned, spit dribbling freely down his chin.
“It’s a story about two people,” Tony started.
“Steeeve,” he tried instead, soft and sweet. He moaned. “I need you. Please.”
“Since when do they mix grounders with flyers?” Tony asked, the screams of the Skrull crowd dimmed in the hallway where they stood.
Tony tipped forward until his forehead hit the mattress. Steve reached out, wanting to feel his hair, know he was real, but right when he made contact, Tony shifted up again, and Steve found himself cupping his cheek.
Steve slapped a palm flat on the table to punctuate his words, legs tensing like he was going to stand, but he sunk back down, his other hand clenching and releasing again by his side. Hill, Fury, and Rumlow were getting more and more visibly frustrated, and none of them seemed to notice that Steve’s rope was stretched extremely thin.
“I know you didn’t.” Tony grinned. “You were too busy making googly eyes at my boyfriend, there.”
“What’s wrong, gummy bear?” Tony asked, setting his book down.
Tony spun in place, his glittering finery catching the moonlight. “How do I look?”
“Yeah.”
Fuck - he needed to come like this, with Steve’s tongue inching deeper and deeper inside him, first hard and pointed then soft and soothing, but never relenting. The chains were so taut, Tony’s arms were aching, his fingers tingling with pins and needles, but he couldn’t relax, every muscle in his body screaming
. Steve kissed Bucky then travelled back down Tony’s neck to the curve of his collarbone. Tony sighed and sunk back into Bucky’s hold, eyes fluttering open and tipping up. “Uh guys?”
Tony's legs clamped around Steve's hips as the creature thrust Steve deep into him over and over, the tentacle in his own ass finding his prostate and torturing it relentlessly. The tentacle around his cock stayed there, pulsing around him with every thrust, curling around inside Tony in a way that must have been driving him crazy.
Tony sighed. He had screwed this up so fast. "Look, if this makes things too awkward, I can just -"
Steve had him almost folded in half, cock pounding deep in Tony’s ass with every snap of his hips, when he finally pressed forward and moaned out his release. His cock throbbed where it stretched Tony’s rim, pumping come deep inside him.
The rain slowed for a moment, the window whipping it the other way, and Steve caught the soft strains of Tony whistling a tune in the kitchen while he cleaned up from dinner. He looked over his mug at his fiancé, unable to hold back a smile. Tony's hips shook left then right as he wiped a cloth over the granite countertop. Steve tipped his head to the side, finding an angle that let him see all those curves…
Steve tightened his hands on the steering wheel. “Not very safe…”
But a drug was hardly needed to make him lose his head when the tentacles finished exploring every inch of him and began unerringly torturing the parts that made him gasp and groan the hardest. A thin tendril wound around his cock from base to tip, its point teasing the underside of the head, and he wondered if it would push inside as another one had to Tony. He tensed, half horrified and half desperate, but it didn't explore his slit, choosing to pulse pleasantly around his throbbing length instead.
Tony tried to stay awake.
“Evicted. Immediately.” Tony poked him the side, and Steve laughed. They fell silent for a moment, and Steve thought Tony had fallen asleep until a soft kiss pressed to his collarbone. “Yeah,” Tony whispered in the dark. “They’re pretty damn cute.”

“Fucking A.” Rhodey hung up.
“Because you asked me to.”
"Whoa, what's going on down here?" a new, familiar voice cut in, and Steve sighed with relief.
“We don’t have house rules for chess.”
Ant finds something he shouldn't.
Subject: You Can't Make This Shit Up
Tony lurched up and wiped a hand over his cheek. "Hey, Steve. I - uh -" His voice hitched. "I wanted to get the freshest hug of the day so I got here before you opened." He stood there, looking small and a little broken, his endless bags a mess around his feet.
“You okay? Mission go okay?” Tony danced his fingers over the buttons and snaps of the armour Steve hadn’t removed yet. It was stiff and unyielding under Tony’s touch, but he found the edge of Steve’s collar and slipped his fingers down to stroke through the fine hairs he found at the nape of his neck.
“Yes, please.” Tony’s smirk softened into something warmer, and Steve sipped his gingerale to push down the sudden knot in his throat. “You’re hot, you’re talented, you’re smart - assuming those murals are your design. As long as you’re single and interested, I would very much like to go out with you.”
The bad man slumped down in his chair, ready to eat an entire pint of ice cream, but when he turned in his seat, he saw something on his desk. It was a box, wrapped in shiny, red paper, and on top was a big, fancy bow.
The challenge is to write a fic that uses three of the top ten tags for stony+uni. I picked Ults and I had to laugh that Internalized Homophobia was on the list hahaha. I love Ults <3
Tony’s mouth twitched up. “Rematch?”
“We did,” Steve growled.
Steve snorted. “Yeah, but no one calls me Stevie, these days.”
"I think I still have my powers." Steve held out his good hand and Tony took it. Steve tugged and Tony tried to pull back, but Steve easily hauled him forward until Tony lost his balance and tumbled into his lap. "Oh."
(Originally
“I don’t know. I don’t think so - maybe. We don’t have candy in the house so this is his first time eating a lot of it.” The man’s breath stuttered and started, and Tony shot him a concerned look. The last thing he needed was both of them out. But the man squared his jaw and took a deep breath instead of breaking down. Tony turned back to the boy.
Steve traced a finger along the edge of Tony’s jaw, reactivating the burn of last night’s bite. “Memorizing you.”
“I looked all over the apartment for her and I couldn’t find her! I assumed she got out and was going to be murdered by a raccoon!”
“With Solo in it by any chance?”
The rest of the evening was soft and sweet, and Tony did his best to push stressful thoughts of Bucky out of his mind. He ate spaghetti and drank wine and curled up in bed with Steve that night, cozy and comfortable in his arms. But with the light out and Steve's breathing soft and slow, Tony couldn't help but think about how nice it would be to have Bucky pressed up against him on the other side.
“Bleh.” Tony rolled out of bed, making sure to crawl over both supersoldiers, dispensing knees and elbows with extreme prejudice. He padded down the hall and into the nursery where the wailing got louder. “Oh, Peanut, what do you have to cry about, huh?” He scooped his daughter out of the crib and pressed his lips to her forehead. “You don’t have to pay taxes, you get to do tummy time instead of board meetings, and you have three amazing daddies, two of whom will love you no matter what, and one of whom will love you as long as you don’t turn out to be a Yankees fan.”
"Oh." Tony blinked at him then hurriedly took another sip of his coffee. "That's maybe the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me."
Tony had paid about sixteen hours and seventeen types of paintbrushes ago, so when Steve stood, Tony bustled him right out the door before he could get engaged to any other famous artists who also happened to not be Tony. They set off down the street, Steve radiating the healthy glow of a man in love and Tony radiating, he suspected, the surly funk of an engineer who got one-upped by a woman who had two different coloured socks on.
Steve smiled shakily and crossed the lab to settle on a stool next to Tony, ankles hooked on the bar so his legs folded up like a little kid’s. “So, um,” Steve started awkwardly. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in a little while. Everything okay?”
"Uh, yeah. I would hope you don't go around dropping other mens' wallets."
sir. But you're going to have to leave."
“Dance with me.” Tony held out a hand.
“I know, but this’ll only take a minute,” Steve pleaded. “FRIDAY says it’s going to be cloudy soon.”
because right now Tony’s marvelling at the amount of space in the four-inches-too-short khakis he’s wearing and wondering if the serum went all the way down or if the rather startling measurements JARVIS had taken for Steve’s suit redesign last year were canon from the start. But Steve, it seems, can’t read his mind, because he just shrugs and leans up against the wall beside Tony.
"I understand." He was being patronizing now. "There's a contact form on the website, where you can submit your comment and -"
Tony laughed. "Private planes get grounded when Toto finds himself out of state too, you know."
Up in the tallest tower, on the farthest island, under a dark storm cloud, the very bad man was very angry.
It was entirely too adorable how much of a zombie Steve was in the morning.
“Fight’s not over yet, cap.”

. “Right. Okay.” Despite the absolute humiliation of it, Tony couldn’t seem to school his face into indifference. “Guess I misread…”
Steve blinked at him, tilting his head in question.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Steve burst into helpless laughter. “Oh my god, did you really save that from your twenties?”
“Awesome. Let’s go.” Tony turned and marched off down the alley, but Steve called after him, stilling him.
“What? Steve.” Tony pushed himself up of the couch, tablet forgotten, heart in his throat. “Wow. Uh. I’m really flattered, and obviously you’re gorgeous and amazing, and who wouldn’t want to go out with you? And as I’m saying this I’m realizing I have no idea why I thought this sentence was going to end with me turning you down so, uh, yes. I mean, you don’t need Grindr to ask a guy out, Steve. You can just do it. And he’ll say yes. Apparently. With enthusiasm.”
Tony paused. “Yes?”
“We should take him out in the snow today,” Steve said, after the soft silence had stretched on long enough that he thought both the Starks might have fallen back asleep.

Tony's cue was a loud bang, and he jumped up and fired several blanks from his prop gun. Voices called more effects cues in the background. "It's pretty obvious, Bucky," he whispered sharply. "Why don't you just tell me the truth?"
“It’s raining,” Natasha protested, but she let Tony draw her out on the patio. It was raining, but it was light and warm, the fresh, soft rain of spring.
“Do we have time?”
“I know.”
“God, it killed me to say those things to you, Tony. I just needed you to leave. And I didn’t want them to see that you could be used as leverage against me. But I guess I’m not as good an actor as I thought. They must have seen something in my face and they sent someone after you. I’m so sorry I put you in danger. I went after you, after they left, to tell you everything, and I found the wine bottle broken on the sidewalk -” Steve’s voice broke.
“Wow, that much? Really?”
AoU, angst with a happy ending, feels, a distinct lack of bedsharing.
“Good morning, sweetheart.”
“Isn’t it about time you took a rest?” Tony called, and Steve’s head twisted up from where it had been bent over a fluffy, green bush.
Next to the bush was a small square sign that said,
“Too long.”
Then he drew the lone man with intense eyes, gorgeous clothes and a working man's hands. Steve sketched the sharpness of his jaw, the clean edge of his beard, and the high-class cut of his suit. But he couldn't get the eyes quite right.

Steve’s jaw snapped closed as Hill cut him off yet again.
His eyes were just drifting shut, the call of a nap on this lazy Sunday afternoon too strong to resist, when a soft strain of music wafted through the door, as if carried in on a slight breeze. Steve opened his eyes again and looked towards the hallway, like he could see the source there. But, of course, the music was too slight, too soft, to be that close.
“I just left to go get the mail and I come back to find you’ve turned our apartment into a strip club,” Steve said.
“Stop worrying and kiss me.”
Tony sat at his computer in his private study, spinning idly in his chair. He couldn't believe that  not only had they found the one and only Captain America, and not only was he alive and well, but he was joining the Avengers.
“Yeah…” Tony tugged at his own pants, which Steve could feel were rapidly becoming a problem. “Lots of time for practice.”
Steve rolled his eyes, but he let himself be led away, down the hall. He’d warn Tony about Greg later.
Subject: Re: Fwd: Care to comment?
Steve turned and stared at him, wide-eyed, the others so distracted by their yelling that they didn’t seem to notice the two Avengers suddenly blinking at one another.
"And - Action!"
“But they taste better when you bring them home yourself,” Steve finished.
“Yes.” Steve’s voice, on the other hand, was rock steady. “I didn’t want you to go that night, so I lied.”
“I don’t want to waste any more time,” Steve whispered, kissing Tony between each word.
Tony looked up from his book at the shuffle of lazy footsteps coming down the hall. He smiled when Captain America appeared, in all his Yummy Sushi pajama glory, eyes still half-shut and a pout staying firmly fixed to his face.
“Yeah?”
Square: "I hate magic"
Bruce hummed in sympathy, eyes cutting over to his carefully handwritten formulas.
Tony stilled, sighing, then turned around, trying to ignore the looks that were immediately thrown his way. "What do you - wow."
Tony jolted awake to the sound of a high-pitched wail through the baby monitor. “Whose turn is it?” he muttered.

Subject: Re: Fwd: Care to comment?
Three months later, Tony and Steve had soundly beaten Natasha and Clint at euchre and Steve had grinned across the table at Tony. “How are you liking me now?”
It was a slightly different Steve every time, after that, but Tony still always knew it was Steve. Sometimes, he could sense their teammates in the background, but it was always Steve that touched him, whispered sweet praise in his ear, promised him that he’d be okay. It was always Steve that drew pleasure from his broken body. It was Steve who told him it was okay to let go, that he’d catch him. That he didn’t have to shiver anymore.
That could be nice, better than if he was cruel or abusive, but Tony had always dreamed of having a husband who loved him, a partner. He knew lots of couples who loved each other, even if his parents didn’t always seem like the prime example. Tony was ready to love him, whoever he was.
Ant watches The Lion King.
They varied wildly in ages, young men and old men alike, plenty looking like they'd just finished up a hard day's work and stopped in before heading home to the missus. Steve scowled at that. He knew all too well how often men like that didn't make it all the way home.
“Yeah?”

Tony hunched down behind his sunglasses and powered down the street, keeping his chin ducked. It was bad enough he'd lost his wallet that morning, bad enough he'd been recognized at Starbucks and mobbed, bad enough the board meeting had gone to shit, but now there'd been a scheduling mix-up with his driver and he had to walk home.
"It sucked up a binky, Tony. I don't think that's normal."
And he could feel it: Tony wanted this too.
Tony knocked on the doorframe, but the Steve-shaped lump under the sheets didn’t move. “Steve.”
“You have to go to prom with me.”
Steve nodded, but the movement was short and sharp, barely more than a twitch of his head. Tony’s soulmark ached.
Steve tilted his head with curiosity. “What do you mean?”
Tony grinned, shark-like, then flicked his wrist and the armour

“Have some caution there, Mr. Stark,” Steve warned with a smile. “Thor said the spell would wear off in four to twenty-four hours and I don’t want you to suddenly find yourself fifty-two again at the top of a tree or Mount Everest or something. Or wearing a ski mask behind a teller desk.”
“He falls in love.” Tony’s voice had dropped low, rough and breathless. Steve swallowed heavily, charged as a livewire. “But his friend doesn’t know. And he doesn’t know how to tell him.”
Tony closed his eyes and balanced the phone on his ear, listening.
"Did you ever think about getting tested?" Tony asked, kicking his feet back and forth where they hung off the edge of the table. He stared up at the ceiling.
“Together forever."
Steve's face fell. "Oh. Shit."

“Oh.”
“Oof!” Tony startled out of the doze he’d drifted into when a heavy weight landed on his lap. He blinked awake, the book he’d been failing to read slipping from his fingers.
“He’s great. We’ve filled the whole house with epi-pens and he’s thrilled about outlawing peanut butter.” Steve smiled, and Tony’s heart started to pound. “You’re not easy to find, you know. I went back to the hospital a few times, but it wasn’t until I talked to one of the nurses that I figured out you’re not an ER doctor at all. You’re a specialist who happened to be passing through.”
Steve?
“And the door was locked…”
Steve grinned. “They’re all named Tony.”
Steve’s eyes snapped back up to Tony’s, shining with emotion. “
Steve whimpered as Tony was shoved down far enough to choke, Steve’s cock hardening against his will and pressing into his throat. He was cutting off Tony’s air supply, but he didn’t have a choice. The tentacles were like steel rods binding him in place.
Tony moaned and arched up against him, making Steve's hand clench into a fist where it was held fast at his side. He tugged on Tony's fingers with his other hand. This was not how he'd envisioned their first time together. He no longer struggled, sure that it was pointless and also worried that he'd hurt Tony by mistake. And with the drug flushing through him, it was getting harder and harder to want to fight. The tentacle behind him worked its way a scant inch into his ass and a whole new collection of nerves burst to life, shocking a moan as wanton as Tony's out of his throat.
Two days later, the very bad man was dressed from head to toe in his finest clothes. Tonight was the night he would finally have his date with Tony Stark. He had the ticket for the seat beside Tony, and after a full night of wonderful opera, he would admit that he was the gift-giver and Tony would be so grateful they’d go out for coffee after and Tony would fall in love with him. It was the perfect plan.
talking to you. Your perspective on colour theory is so refreshing!”
The ice cream carton squeaked under Tony’s too-tight hold and he dropped it with a low rumble that definitely wasn’t a growl.
“Steven.”
"Yeah."
He straightened his clothes and walked across the room then settled on his knees beside the bed. This was it - he’d finally have the love of his life all to himself!

Maybe Tony could have both of them after all. They were here, after all. That meant something.
"Good afternoon, sir. How can I help you?"
Tony met Steve's eyes over Ant's head and knew he was thinking the same thing.
Steve shot the ceiling a concerned look. "What? No he's not. That was hours ago, JARVIS."
“Fuck you,” Steve growled, struggling again, muscles clenching with each shock from the cuffs. He was drained, and the adrenaline that flushed through his veins was only serving to make him panic more, not giving him the strength to escape. He’d thought this base was mostly empty. If he’d known it was still in use, he would have called the rest of the team in. Steve squeezed his eyes shut as they pushed him in until his shoulders hit the back of the cryo tube. His heart was racing, breath coming in short gasps. He was going to lose everything again.
Tony was already in a booth by the time Steve caught up, a waiter filling two glasses of water. Steve slid in on the other side. Tony tapped his fingers on the tabletop. “So what do you charge?”
“Well, except that the man’s son has been dead for fifteen years. The gardener swears the house has been haunted since the day he died, and he finally manifested and killed his father. There isn’t a single other suspect and I’ve been working my ass off for the past four days, but I haven’t been able to come up with a single thing. Steve said that Natasha said you had a knack for thinking outside the box and you might be able to give me another perspective. I’ll pay you.”
"No problem. Should I go?"
he hadn't been touched like that in so long. It had his head spinning almost immediately.
They’d all stayed up too late last night, and he was fully expecting to hear Anthony break into grumpy sniffles as he woke, but instead, he just hummed and sighed to himself. When the humming broke into little babbled “Da”s, Steve wriggled out of Tony’s arms and out of bed. Tony whimpered then grumbled, his arm reaching for the spot where Steve had been, but Steve only smiled at him as he crossed the room. Tony’s bare back caught the startlingly bright morning light, and Steve paused to tug the too-thin blanket up over his shoulders.
Another orgasm - he'd lost count of how many he'd had now - was fast approaching, and there was nothing he could do but give in to it.
“Happy birthday,” Steve said, and Tony beamed.
Deathlok swung his fist, and Tony dodged it, dipping under his arm to knock him back with a repulsor blast to the face. “You alright there, Steve?” he quipped. “I seem to remember you having more stamina.”
Sleep didn’t always come. Sometimes ice water rushed into Steve’s lungs when he closed his eyes and he gasped awake again. On those nights, he wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and shuffled down to the shared kitchen to drink tea and look at the debris scattered around the room that reminded him he had a family now.
Blood: Unknown

The coffee maker hissed out the last of the tepid, brown, coffee-like water with a strangled gurgle, and Tony picked up the mug and turned to stare down Steve Rogers. The cup shook, but Steve politely ignored it.
Steve and Bucky shared a look. “What?” they asked in unison.
Steve sighed. “You don’t have to pretend, Tony. I know things are going to be weird now. I think it’s pretty obvious how I - uh - how I…”
Heartbroken, the bad man flew away.
The man handed over the wallet, and Tony took it. He opened it on instinct, and the billfold parted, stuffed with cash. "There's like over a thousand dollars cash in here and you're giving it back? You know you could wrack up like ten k of Switches on the black AmEx and I probably wouldn't even notice, right?"
Steve turned to go, but Tony slammed his hand against the wall, mere inches from Steve’s head, halting his path. Tony leaned in until he loomed over Steve, caged between his arms. The arc reactor, freshly returned to his chest, ached, but he ignored it, focused entirely on the suddenly smaller man trapped by his body. “Oh no, sweetheart. That’s not it at all.” His voice rumbled, low in his chest. Something new, vibrant and needy was curling to life inside him. Tony’s fingers itched to move, to grab. He pressed closer. He growled. “You, like this… makes me want to
He lay there for a painful, sleepless hour before he decided it wasn’t worth it. He’d rather lie awake with Tony than be anywhere else in the world.
“Mutants fight,” Steve parroted blandly.
"Okay." Tony led Steve into the workshop, heart overflowing with affection. A game, a movie, it wasn't much, but if it was all Tony got, he'd take it. Then he looked down and realized that Steve was still holding on to the hand that Tony had helped him up with, and he showed no signs of letting go any time soon.
"You gonna play this one for anyone but an empty bar?" Steve teased.
Steve looked back at the silent, imposing armour where it stood against the wall. “Okay…”

When they settled on the final prognosis that Steve would just have to wait it out, Steve immediately dropped to his feet and made a beeline for the door.
Steve shuffled back and something hit the ground with a thud, then his head appeared, dotted with tufts of fluffy white dust bunnies. "You're always looking. What did you ask me?"

“Oh, you -” Steve broke off with a growl then he reached out and hauled a laughing Tony into his arms. He threw him over his shoulder, surprised by how light a Tony in his twenties was, and made for the quinjet. He dropped Tony in his seat then sat beside him, legs thrown over Tony’s lap to pin him where he was.
“No. I can’t move that. It’s too late. And there are chopsticks everywhere.”
Tony dropped his face in his hands and scrubbed hard. “Fuck, Steve. You can’t - you won’t - I asked you to leave me alone so I could get over you and instead you kiss me and tell me you like me? You can’t do that. You have a boyfriend. I won’t be a homewrecker, okay? Just let me go.”
Steve kissed Tony again. “Deal.”
Steve nodded. “Okay.”
A lot of you asked for Tony's POV of this morning, so here it is! :D
Thanks to fan for the prompt!
There was something playful in Tony’s voice, so Steve took a breath then took a chance. “No… just kind, attractive regulars.”
A loud buzzing shocked Tony out of sleep and he blinked around in the dark for a moment before he realized it was his phone ringing. There were only three numbers programmed to override his do not disturb.
Clint didn’t have a cat did he? Tony had definitely seen the light flicker as if feet were walking past the door. He turned the knob as silently as he could and pulled the door open. The hall was empty. He sighed.
“What are you doing here?” Tony asked, stalling. It was pretty obvious what he was doing here.
Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, the two Ultimates left the frame of the cameras and headed back towards the van, hidden around the corner.
For Happy Steve Bingo!
It seemed like hours ago that he’d stopped shivering.
Steve held up the mug. “Tea?”
They brushed their teeth side-by-side in Tony’s bathroom, then changed, Tony out of his clothes and Steve into his pajamas. They divided up the blankets, half for Tony and half for Steve, and Steve tucked Tony’s tightly around him until he was very nearly swaddled, his feet firmly wrapped up snug. Steve kissed the end of his nose and pulled the Tony sushi roll up against his chest, his own side of the bed a mess of random quilts and sheets, piled on him haphazardly. “Goodnight, Tony,” he said.
Clint scoffed. “Come on, Stark, are you high? There’s no way you can beat Steve. He’s chemically enhanced.”
“I don’t want to fight you,” Tony said again, stronger this time. His frustration made the armour ripple all around him, fading out and reappearing in a wave across his body.
Steve laughed silently, not wanting to wake Tony, but knowing he was shaking the bed. He couldn’t help it, though. There was a petulant sort of softness in Tony’s sleep-voice, and it was too adorable. Steve shifted around under the too-tight covers to pull Tony closer. “Hey, Tony?”
“Morning, darling.”
Steve’s hands slipped back, parting Tony’s ass to let him dive deeper, licking harder now, then sucking, teasing Tony’s rim into softness. The pleasure that built was the deep, low, intense, almost painful kind, and Tony knew he was going to be sobbing, begging, before he came. It was futile to think that Steve might fuck him, might touch his cock, Tony knew he wouldn’t, and he was forced to sit there and take it while Steve licked him into a shaking mess.
"Do you have a Grindr?"
“Sorry.”
“Touch-starved,” Tony finished.
“Decent?” Steve asks, still not turning around.
Steve laughed. "Sure thing, Tony."

Tony’s favourite mug was on the counter.
Steve’s hand came up to cover the spot Tony had kissed.
The tile around the drain cracked and more tentacles appeared, followed by the coiled mass at the centre of the creature - because that's what it clearly was, a creature. It pinned Tony easily to the wall, winding itself around his arms and legs, binding him. He stared up at it in growing horror as more and more of it wrapped across his shoulders, around his waist and between his legs.
Clint scoffed. “Come on, Stark, are you high? There’s no way you can beat Steve. He’s chemically enhanced.”
But then Tony pointed one way, towards the auxiliary garage, and Bucky pointed the other, throwing his hands in the air when Tony crossed his arms and shook his head. Tony turned away, marching through the snow towards the garage, and Steve watched as Bucky stared after him for a moment then reached down and packed a ball of snow into his metal palm. He shaped it then lined up, sniper’s eyes going narrow and focused, and then he let fly.
“Tony? Are you okay?”
“I’m sorry.”
funny," Bucky said between peals. "It's fucking hilarious. Oh my god, Tony. I got weird because I realized I was developing feelings for you two, and I didn't know you were open to a third. I thought if I was around you both, it'd be obvious - no offence but Steve is a little more perceptive than you - and if you knew, it'd make things awkward. Also thought Steve might be upset with me since I'm here all day groping you and macking on you and he's stuck back in L.A. getting only pieces of you through Facetime. Thought that if I came over when he was there, he might give me a stern talking to about feeling up his man."
"I'm okay," Tony said.
“Yeah. I’ve got a lot of younger siblings, so she’s used to kids. She’s such an attention hog.” He rolled his eyes, but Steve could hear the affection curling through his words.

"Just tell them you're with me. I get one free drink a night. If you don't want it, save it for me, yeah?"
“Probably no one these days also saw you get spun around the roundabout so fast your pants flew off, though.”
He supposed the other reason why he’d been putting this off was that he so desperately didn’t want to run into Steve upstairs in the hall, brushing his teeth in his stupid adorable sweatpants. Tony would almost inevitably say something idiotic and make this fight stretch out even longer.

“Tog,” Tony whispered into Steve’s lapel, and Steve smiled.
“I put him to bed,” the man gasped, hands opening and closing pitifully at his sides. “I was up late working and - and I heard a noise so I went to his room. I - I think he was eating his halloween candy instead of sleeping. There were wrappers on his floor. But - but -”
He was just drifting off again when a small noise broke the early morning silence. It wasn’t a full Anthony giggle, just a tiny, infant sigh, a huff of breath. Steve shifted away from Tony a little, inclining his head towards the monitor to catch any other noises.
Steve marched into the arena to the jeers and cries of the blood-thirsty alien audience. Tony watched, stomach in knots, as Steve's powers were stripped away. He looks so small, so human, so vulnerable out there, and Tony rattled his chains, wishing he could take his place.
"But you wish it weren't there."

"It's okay to not be okay, you know. We don't have to talk. I just want you warm and dry."
Steve's jaw was tight, eyes fixed on the faucet. "He's okay," he said, but it sounded too unsure. Steve dipped the paper towel under the water then crouched in front of Ant. "Give me your hand, honey." Ant was still crying too much to listen or care, so Steve took Ant's wrist and tried to twist his hand up.
"Shit. I hate you so much, sometimes."
going to play?"
Steve nodded, then stepped forward again. He cupped Tony’s face with his hands and pressed a soft kiss to his forehead. “That’s true, but that’s not why I want you. I want you because you’re mine, the other half of me. I want you because I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. I want you for the you I’m so excited to get to know. I want you.”
Thor gestured at the screen. “I’m attempting this video chat with my Jane, but, though I can see her speaking, I can’t hear anything. Something ails the computer.”
Steve pinned Tony with a penetrating stare, but the other man didn’t waver. “Alright… but the money goes to charity. And the loser cooks dinner for the winner.”
Tony spread his hands wide. "And rightfully so. Cause that doesn't sound like me at all."
“You’ll give me a lift?” Steve finished, breathlessly.

It chimed, and opened, and Tony led Steve down a hallway, muttering, "Just through here." They stepped into an empty office that clearly wasn't Tony's, didn't look like anyone's. Just extra space. Tony closed and locked the door behind them.
Steve laughed as they stumbled back into the penthouse together, and Tony feared his heart might burst with all the love he tried to fit inside it. He was never, ever going to give this amazing man up.
The wait was long enough that he had just about decided that Steve wouldn't answer when there was the click of the lock and the door swung open. Steve was damp, hot steam still pouring off him, but there was still a tightness to his jaw and a pink tinge to his eyes.
Steve snorted out a laugh. “Tony do you talk in your sleep?”

Tony’s eyes narrowed.
"It's very, very important. Maybe if you could just get him on the phone, then I could -"
But Steve only had eyes for Tony. Tony, who was smiling at him like the world had suddenly righted itself, which, Steve supposed, it had. Steve broke into a smile of his own, and Tony’s widened.

"Yeah. Sorry. Whoa. Just - Wow. You're pregnant."
"Yeah, it's that you hate my boyfriend."

Tony pulled open the car door and pressed forward, predatory, until Steve tipped back in his seat and let Tony climb up into his lap. “Come on, this is better than our honeymoon. Just you, me, and the open road.”

And -
Tony reached up and cupped his jaw. “I wanted us to grow old together.”
Steve laughed. He reached out and, moving slowly and carefully, curled his hand over Tony’s again. “You’re not going to fuck it up,” he whispered conspiratorially. “But we can practice if you want.”
Tony groaned and flopped back into his seat, filling the cab with the sound of his heaving breaths. “Guh,” he said, and then he laughed quietly. “Wow. I can’t - I think my brain is -” He waved his hand. “Wow.”
“What?”
Steve shot him a brilliant smile. “Nope!”
Steve tipped his chin up and pressed a kiss to Tony's lips, lips he's wanted to kiss for so long he couldn't remember a time when he didn't crave them. And this wasn't the kiss he'd planned for, yeared for, but it was still soft and warm, and Tony sighed and opened for him, tilting into the kiss. It was an apology for what they were facing, but also a promise that he'd be there, they'd face it together.
Now it was too late.
Steve couldn't help but look over to see if his two tables of interest were watching, and found the single man with the intense eyes was, completely absorbed in Natasha. The other table seemed entirely unaffected which only solidified Steve's belief that whoever they were, they were involved in the ownership of the club.

“You did,” Bucky said sharply. “Two of them.” His voice softened. “Tony, please don’t go. What’s really wrong?”
Tony laughed outright, the pretty sound twisting Bucky's stomach in knots. "So you're asking me? Don't you think that's just as weird?"
“What does it -?” Steve cut himself off. He should just say thank you and leave. Just say thank you. And walk away. Because they had to be able to do this or -

Bucky sighed and burrowed closer into Tony. “Warm down here.”
Tony laughed and pulled his boyfriend down until they were wrapped up together in their silly little nest, Steve in his earplugs, Tony in his tight, taut blankets. Now, Steve could mess the rest up and throw them all over the bed, and Tony wouldn’t even notice. And Tony could babble on about whatever he wanted and Steve wouldn’t hear him.
The waiter placed a menu in front of him. “What can I get you to drink?”
Tony whined, writhing in place as Steve slowly impaled him on his cock. God, he was so big, stretched him so wide.
"No? When then? Cause rent's due next week." Bucky sat on the end of the bed by Steve's feet. "You know I'd work night and day if it meant you got to work on what you love. You're my brother, Stevie, and I'd do anything for you, but Fury doesn't have more shifts to fill for a saxophone player. He needs a bartender, though, and I can't do both at once. You've got a crazy good memory, you can carry big crates, and you're good with people, which is all you need, and he can be sure you won't be stealing booze from him."
Steve could feel Anthony’s cheeks split into a smile against his chest, but he stayed quiet until Tony leaned up and kissed the tip of his nose, then he broke into sleepy giggles.
Rated: T
But Steve wasn’t like that. He’d never been great at sleeping. When he was young, his aches and pains would flare up at night, and, more often than not, he’d have an asthma attack as soon as he did fall asleep which would leave him gasping for breath, exhausted. And even when all of that was gone and he was strong and healthy, he still struggled to sleep. No one slept well in the army. A combination of being packed in like sardines, the weather, the bugs, the mud. It all made it nearly impossible. A lot of people did better when they got back, but Steve never adjusted. He’d lie awake, and it would be either too loud or too quiet, no matter what.
Tony let out a long, slow sigh then leaned forward until his forehead hit Steve’s chest. “I can still feel it. I can feel him in my head, whispering in my ear.”
Steve reached out and ran his fingers over the back of the armour’s metal finger. He could feel the ridge from each articulated plate, flexible yet melded so seamlessly together. Iron Man looked down at him in the dark of Tony’s empty workshop, expressionless.
Steve's jaw dropped. "Video?!"
Steve nodded. "We were. Plus I was on the pill. And yet. Neither is a hundred percent effective."
But that was probably his only choice; he just kept putting it off.

“Right…” Steve stared morosely at the uneven cake until Bucky wrapped his arms around him and dragged him back over to the couch. He backed Steve up and pushed him down then climbed into his lap, kissing him silly. It wasn’t long before the cake was shoved entirely out of Steve’s mind.
Tony and Bucky rolled around in the snow for a moment, each trying to get enough of an upper-hand to rub a gloveful of snow in the other’s face, but only succeeded in getting both of them even more soaked. Bucky finally managed to get Tony flipped on his back and shoved snow down Tony’s shirt. He grabbed Bucky’s arm with his gauntlet and locked them in a deadlock. Both their chests heaved, eyes locked on each other, and Steve pushed up out of his chair, peering over the back to get a better view. Neither man was moving…
Steve’s eyes narrow and he looks at Tony like he’s reading his mind which is
“It’s fine, Tony. It’s not your fault.” Steve buried a kiss in Tony’s hair. It was getting a bit sweaty for him inside the too-small-for-two-people sleeping bag, but Tony was clearly still freezing, so Steve snuggled him as closely as he could and tried to radiate more heat.
Getting caught out should have made Tony more reluctant to go back the next night, but he couldn’t help himself. The lure of Hot Window Guy was too strong. Tony hung back in the shadows by the bus stop to watch, and this time Hot Window Guy didn’t notice him. Tony watched him change the display to watercolours and sighed to himself when Hot Window Guy stepped down out of the window and disappeared. He had it so bad.

Two pink lines, eight weeks later.
“You tease!”
“I -” Tony snapped his mouth shut again and shook his head. “I tried to kill you,” he finally choked out.
“I finally got up the courage, you know?” Tony rested his chin in his hand. He poked the wireframe in front of him idly with the point of his pen and watched a large indent appear in the wing of the prototype quinjet remodel. “Finally… and now he’s dating that guy from the grocery store.”

“That doesn’t mean anything,” Steve growled. He forced his fingers to relax where they were gripping his cup, sure it was going to pop in a spray of ice and glass any minute.
Steve managed one of his fries. They were surprisingly good, even though they were orange. “I was just hoping to barter my way out of jail, honestly.”
"Hoping to find someone to share the incredibly exorbitant fruit platter I'm guessing the airport hotel is going to send up when they realize I'm staying in one of their rooms tonight?"
Tony imagined it wouldn’t be two for much longer, not this time.
“Well in that case…” Tony gestured Steve up to walk in front of him. “Welcome to Malibu. There’s nothing like the view.”
Tony leaned over the fence to get a kiss. “As long as I get to help you wash this -” Tony brushed mulch from Steve’s arm “- all off, then it’s a deal.”

"Hey!" Tony crossed his arms. "Not funny."
Tony’s eyes popped wide, and his mouth fell open. Steve followed his line of sight. About fifteen feet away, a young man - maybe 17 or 18 - was walking across the park, earphones in, glued to his phone, with a leash looped over his arm. His free hand was stuffed in the pocket of his jacket, and he nodded his head along with his music while he walked. He had the floppy, unkempt hair teens seemed to wear these days, and his pants were distressingly baggy. And he was slouching.

When the broken part had been replaced and the reactor was back in one piece, Steve sat back, expecting Tony to pick it up, but he had both hands braced over the edge of the desk, knuckles white. “You can just slot it in,” he said, strained. “It’ll click.”
Tony chuckled. “Adrenaline junkie. Knew there was a reason I liked you, Cap.”
“Okay.” Bucky watched him for a moment longer, then nodded to himself. “Okay.” He shuffled off, leaving white footprints across the hardwood.
Tony mumbled, eyes blinking open. He took a moment to focus on Steve's face. "God, it's so much Steve," he whined. "They're
“You’re welcome. He’ll be alright. I’m heading out so I’m going to hand this off to Dr. Cho. She’s amazing. She’ll take good care of you.”
“Thank you.”
“Tony, I took her to the vet for her shots. I put it in the calendar.” Steve was doing his disapproving face and Tony pouted back.
“It’s okay, Tony. It’s all going to be okay. I’m coming to get you.”
“Well, I didn’t have much of a choice,” stumbled out of his mouth before he could stop it, and Tony smacked his hand over it to stop anymore insults from tripping out.
Tony plowed through the door of the apartment. "What did you do?"
Bucky sat up sharply. “What? Why? What’s wrong?”

Anthony apparently thought through his options. "What is it?" he finally asked, and Tony laughed.
"Uh." Steve blinked. "I'm pretty sure that's not what my bio says."
Tony frowned after her, down the hallway. He didn’t have a three o'clock.
“We’ll be alright,” Nat said and Steve let out a long slow breath, and turned to catch her eye.
“It’s not too soon?”
Steve and Bucky shared a look. “Is it… is it that important to you that we keep this a secret?” Steve asked.
"I can shower again." Steve started leading Bucky out of the living room.
Steve gasped as Tony’s throat contracted around his cock again. He twitched but the tentacles wound around him prevented him from moving. It was almost a relief, now, because his self control was so dental floss thin that without the restraint he was worried he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from fucking down Tony’s throat.
Steve never slowed, winding Tony up into madness as his nerves went overboard with sensation. Tony took two handfuls of the front of the Captain America suit, pressed his forehead to Steve’s and hung on for dear life.
“Right, of course. Sorry. I know I shouldn’t have come and bothered you at work, but I didn’t know how else to get a minute alone with you.”
Tony opened the doorway to a pile of blankets. He tugged at them until Steve’s face was revealed. “Hi.”
"I think he likes it," Tony said, hands on hips.
But he couldn't speak, and he couldn't move. When his hand tried to come up on its own, however, the creature responded, twining tightly around his wrists and raising them over his head. It backed him up against the smooth cool wall and pressed him to it, hands pinned over his head. Tentacles petted down his sides, their slick, soft skin like a hundred thousand feather-light tongues licking him all over. He groaned and rocked his hips forward, his impossibly hard cock weeping and throbbing as he spun towards yet another inevitable release.

When Steve felt himself teetering on the edge of yet another orgasm, the point of the thin tendril pressed against the slit of his cock while he was still inside Tony. It was extreme stimulation - every nerve in Steve's body on fire with pleasure - and he cried out against Tony's mouth, hips stuttered forward as he pointlessly chased a more it wasn't possible to find. His cock throbbed, spilling even more inside, and Tony moaned and clutched him closer.
None of the clothes fit quite right, but they cover Tony’s junk, and for the first time since landing, he lets out a full breath. He tips back against the wall, and closes his eyes for a moment.

Tony, for his part, is completely covered in mud. He’s wearing the undersuit with a pair of sweatpants over top, that are also covered in mud. He has what seems like half an oak tree in his hair - which is sticking up completely wildly - and he’s clutching a dirty puppy to him like if he lets her go, she’ll cease to exist.
Steve held Tony close, arms latching behind his back, and kissed him stupid, the cool breeze whipping away the hot flush that burst on the back of Tony’s neck. “God, I missed you so much,” Steve whispered.
“I thought you and Jan broke up?” Clint asked.
“Mmm. Missed you.”
Steve finished tucking in his laces and stood. He rummaged around on the coffee table and came up with a blue-covered book that Tony remembered Bucky reading lately. “Here you go, babe,” Steve said, handing the book to Bucky. He traded it to Bucky for a kiss, then took one for free from Tony. “I’ll see you guys soon.”
The very bad man arrived early, settled in his seat and waiting. And before long - there! Tony appeared, looking stunning in a perfectly fitted suit. But a moment later, the bad man wanted to scream. Tony had brought a date of his own! Captain America, no less! How dare he.
"What's wrong? Why are you calling? Is everyone okay?"
Steve grinned. “True.”
Tony looked up and realized there were two men in tactical gear in the basement with them but they filed out at Steve’s command. Steve pulled his helmet back on - somehow keeping Tony from falling one-handed - and carried Tony up the stairs and out the front door of the house. There was a large, black van idling in the driveway. Steve opened the back door and sat Tony down, feet hanging over the back bumper. He produced a blanket from somewhere and pulled it around his shoulders. “Tony?”
“Hold on, baby,” Steve whispered, words tight with arousal. “You can do it.”
"'The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another his mother called him -'"
Tony shrugged. “Whatever. I’m having a great time travelling, so it’s all for the best.” His eyes slid over towards Steve again, darkening, and Steve felt his cheeks heating.
Tony let his eyes fall closed as he sunk into the sensation. Steve had Tony pinned down with one hand fisted tightly in the hoodie, right over Tony’s hip. His other hand slipped between his legs to rub slick fingers around the edge of his hole. Tony felt his body open up, welcoming Steve in, and Steve slid one finger inside until the edge of his glove pressed roughly against his rim. “Fuck.” He writhed, but Steve’s hold was tight and the pressure from his mouth was intense, so Tony was forced to suck air in between his teeth and keep still. He lifted his arms and folded them over his face, the too-long sleeves of the hoodie flopping over his hands.
Steve leaned in closer, one hand sliding down over Tony’s hip, slow, and firm, and
Steve blinked awake, smacking his dry tongue against the roof of his mouth. They needed to get a humidifier or something; he always woke up parched here. Tony was curled in the curve of Steve’s body, one hand tucked under his pillow, the other resting lightly on Steve’s bicep where it was trapped under Tony’s neck. Steve snuck his free arm under Tony’s shirt, pressing it flat against his chest and got a sleepy, little groan in response.
When Forehead smacks Steve across the ear so hard Tony can hear it ringing himself, he gives up on catching his breath and throws himself into Forehead’s side.

No mercy.

By the time they got to chalk, Tony was so completely in love he spent the rest of the walk home looking up art classes on his phone. Because there were only two more days in the sale and then what was he supposed to do?
Steve stood on the patio until his alarm went off an hour later, then packed up his sign and hustled off to the T. While he rattled in the subway car on the way home, he dug his notebook out and checked off the boxes on his list. For the hundredth time, he rejoiced in his perfect memory. It let him run his experiment without trying to discreetly mark down the hugees with people watching. Fewer people would want one, probably, if they knew it was for his sociology class. He liked to think it brightened their day, though, even if it was all in aid of a credit. In fact, the more he thought about it, the more Steve thought he might still do it once in a while, even when his class was done. It shouldn't have been surprising how many college students were in need of a hug, but it tugged at his heartstrings when people burrowed in a little deeper or held him a little tighter.
"What did you do?" Tony repeated. "During your afternoon lecture?" he prompted. "Something happened?"

Outside, Bucky gestured wildly back towards the compound and Tony stopped, turning around. He spread his arms wide, a classic “Tony defending his point” stance, and Steve chuckled. He had no idea what they were doing outside, but it looked like they were heading somewhere. Either that, or they’d gotten into one of their ridiculously overheated, tension-filled arguments and had gone out into the snow to literally cool off.
“You’re sure? I can delay this.”
Bucky frowned at his laptop, casting back. He'd started the Zoom meeting ten minutes before his lecture time. He liked to watch the students file in as if they were really in a classroom. Parker had been showing everyone his cat. "No. I really can't think of anything. You were here when it started."

Tony pulled them both into the penthouse then immediately took all his clothes off. Steve watched, helpless, as Tony gazed at himself in the mirror. His chest was smooth and perfect, no lines, no scars. Well -

“Fuck, Tony,” Steve breathed, when his orgasm had abated enough to speak. “You’re the best thing I’ve ever fucked.”
“Two hundred bucks,” Tony said, smirking, eyes never leaving Steve’s.
Steve left his paint behind and trotted after him, having no other option. He couldn’t run, that would just lead Tony straight to his home - right to Ma, who would not be amused. If he went with him, he might be able to convince Tony not to get him in trouble, maybe offer a trade. He could clean off the paintings in exchange for not going to jail.
Tony buried his face in Steve’s shirt and breathed him in. “Thank you, darling.”
“Because the whole world wants to see you two together, and I'm…”
He kissed him again.

“Tony? What’s wrong?”
“Alright.” Steve made sure the sleeping bag was tugged tight around their necks. “Are you warming up?”
Tony’s lips are cool, but Steve warms them quickly with his own. Tony blooms against him, the puppy pressed tightly between their chests. Steve traces the edge of Tony’s lips with his tongue, cataloging that too and the soft noise of surprise it startles out of Tony’s throat. A throat Steve wants to kiss, taste, nip as well, but that would involve moving away from Tony’s mouth, and - well -
Natasha smiled indulgently. “He’s probably on the roof. He’s been up there a lot with the B-team since you left.”
“Because I packed the cushions?”
Their boyfriend?
Tony shifted again, poking his phone, but he jostled it too hard, and it smacked his long-empty coffee cup, making it rattle on its saucer. Steve startled up, as if out of a dream. He looked at his watch. “Oh gosh, Ms. Fortis, I’m so sorry. I’ve kept you so long.”

"Yeah." Steve let out a slow breath and pulled Tony even closer.
And Tony was pouting too.
Steve blinked at them. “Okay… so Tony why are you on the floor too?”
“Wait, Tony. Please.” Steve released him when Tony stopped and turned back towards him. “Did you - I mean - Did you mean it when you said you’d go out with me?”
A soft knock on the door startled Tony’s back ramrod straight, and he shoved the case back in his pocket, breath evaporating out of his lungs. A moment later, when he hadn’t managed to say anything, the door creaked open and a face peered around it. “Hi?” the man said.
He’d tried to make it work, hooking up with other people who had given up the search, or had lost their mates, but it wasn’t the same. He didn’t know what it would feel like when he found his mate, but he did know this wasn’t it.
“I know. Me too.”
Steve went to the library every Tuesday afternoon, filled a bag until it was bursting, and then read during nearly every spare moment he had, and Tony
Tony’s not about to argue with the guy that knows his way around, so he lets himself be led. What he’d assumed was the end of the alley, actually isn’t, and Steve shows him how to shuffle around the end of the fence until they’re in a closed off area behind a boarded up shop.
"Oh, yeah, of course."
"Hey, JARVIS?" he asked, stepping back into the elevator. "Where's Tony?" If he was upstairs in bed or out of the tower, Steve would eat the sandwiches himself and try not to add a pint of ice cream straight from the tub after.
Tony had been jealous before, but not like this, never like this. It wasn’t bragging to say that if he set his sights on someone, they were usually into it. Sometimes for the wrong reasons, but…
"Hey, JARVIS. Read me my journal entries from age fourteen on, anything that mentions Cap."
“You’re like - legitimately a really good person, aren’t you?”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony said softly. “I’m so sorry. But it’s okay. You didn’t lose us. Just a week, I promise.”

Tony gave him an only slightly shaky thumbs up. “So par for the course then.”
He tasted like coconut.
Tony bit his lip then opened his mouth to speak, but Steve cut him off. “Mark.”
“Not fair…” Bruce echoed, fiddling with a collection of test tubes.
“Ready?” Steve asked, breathlessly.
"It's a date."
Steve snuggled up on one side, Bucky on the other. “How does she do that?” Bucky asked.
So Tony curled up on the porch swing and rocked gently back and forth, waiting for morning.
“God, Tony. Of course. Nothing I want more.” Steve nipped a kiss to the underside of Tony’s jaw then wriggled his way down the bed to settle between his legs. He pulled at Tony’s boxers, and working together they managed to get them off. Tony put his feet back on the mattress, knees folded on either side of Steve’s shoulders and breathed out heavily when Steve drew a line of hot, wet kisses up the inside of Tony’s thigh.
"I love you too, Jason," Bucky whispered against his lips. He grinned. "Like a house on fire."
"Steve…" Tony's gaze met his.
Steve pushed off the couch and went to the kitchen, making grilled cheese sandwiches on autopilot while thoughts of Tony continued to roll around in his mind. What if Tony really had meant for this to be a date? That's how he imagined it would happen. One day, Tony would just say "Hey, Steve, we should take this to the next level, right?" and all Steve would have to say would be, "Yes," and it would be easy and happy and perfect.
Blood: Unknown
“Yeah?”
“I know. It’s dumb. But I want this year to last forever.”
Steve shrugged and smiled. "I don't know what that is."
The store was on day eight of a two-week sale on art supplies they’d labeled “Try Something New!” where a new art medium was deeply discounted each day. Normally, this would affect Tony not at all, since he couldn’t draw his way out of a paper bag, but he’d happened to walk past the window in the evening of day two and screeched to a stop.
Half the firm crew pouted - they'd only just started - but the director nodded. "Two minutes. Make it quick."
He shuffled across the mattress and leaned over the edge.
“Why not?”
The two men stood close together in the hallway, talking too low for Tony to hear. But he could see Steve smiling. They were close to the elevator, and Mr. Apparently Spending the Night Now appeared to be on his way out while Steve was going to turn towards the kitchen.
“No, you didn’t.  Don’t lie to me, Steven. You had no idea I was here.”
Later that day, the door to the workshop opened, and in walked the man with a star on his chest. He greeted Tony softly, then asked what he was looking at.
"Okay, wonderful." Tony grinned at him, and Steve grinned back until they were just two naked people sitting on a bathroom floor, holding hands and grinning stupidly and someone was going to have to end this. "Okay. I - I think I'll shower in my own room." He started to push to his feet, but the movement seemed to knock something loose, and he gasped.
Tony shuffled up against Steve’s side then turned them away from the tower and down a side street. The ice cream place by the park would still be open. “Still is,” he said.
Tony sighed. "Yeah, okay. Another night then."
"Trying to sort out which shoes to pack now and which to keep out. Between the three of us, we have a shocking amount." Steve paused, his fingers twitching against the collar of Tony's shirt. "I should get back to it."
The first thing Steve registered was the beeping of monitors and how hideously dry his throat was. He tried to clear it, but it wasn’t working. He tried again.
“Practically an adult.”
“Sure you don’t want help with that?” Tony asked, and Steve traced his eyeline down to his crotch.
“Stop right there, Rogers!”
“Thank you.” Tony took the case then fumbled out his own. “Uh - here.” He was supposed to say something nice here, something grateful, thanking Captain Rogers for taking him, but he couldn’t remember the speech his mom had made him practice over and over in front of the mirror. “I can’t remember what I’m supposed to say,” he admitted, then frowned when he realized that was probably worse than saying nothing.
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.

Today, Hot Window Guy was in the process of dismantling the soft pastel display and replacing it with Copic markers. He fit easily in the window space, several inches shorter than Tony - and Tony wondered more than once if that was why he’d been assigned the daily task - and his dark, fitted jeans hugged his rear snugly as he bent to stack a pile of books at his feet.
"I really am sorry."
“I’ll always find you,” Tony said. “I’ll never let them take you for two hundred years. Never. I love you too.”
Tony picked up the watch. “Someone sent this to me, and I don’t know who.”
“Having a bit of a day?” Steve hazards, with a twitch of his lips.
"[Russian] - Cause he's from the 1940s so there's probably a lot he wouldn't know, and I could show him. If you know what I mean..."
"But first?"
“What? You - You’re not serious?”
Two strong arms wrapped around Tony from behind and one squeezed. The other was holding a glass of red wine. Tony took it and twisted around to get a kiss from Bucky. “Thank you, sweetheart.” Tony took his place on the couch with his wine and was soon joined by Bucky on the other end, feet tucked up and the well-worn afghan tugged over his bare legs.
Any cried harder and tried to squirm away, and Steve looked over his head at Tony. Tony wished he had some words of comfort or encouragement, but all he could do was mirror back his fear. When Ant wouldn't hold his hand still, Tony was forced to grip his elbow to keep his arm in place while Steve peeled his fingers open and got a good look at his hand. He dabbed the damp paper towel to his skin and it came back sickeningly red.
For tonystarksnipples to cheer her up while sick.
Steve spread his hands. “Whatever you want. I can just sit in that chair, bring you water, food, whatever you need. I can guard the door if it’d make you feel better. I can book another room, be down the hall just in case.” He paused, swallowed. “Or it can be how it used to be.”
Only, it’s not a new voice. It’s Steve.
Tony spun in place, his glittering finery catching the moonlight. “How do I look?”
. How on Earth was he this lucky?
For Happy Steve Bingo.
“Mr. S- Tony. I don’t know what to say. I -”
“I wasn’t that fond of you either.” Tony pressed even closer. “But we figured it out, yeah?”
Steve danced out of the way, icing bag clutched in his fist, laughing. He made it as far as the living room when Bucky tackled him to the ground. Steve spun in his hold and squeezed the bag, squirting a line of blue icing down the length of Bucky’s nose.
“I get it,” Steve growled, crossing his bony arms over his thin chest. “You still love me, but you’re not attracted to me like this. It’s fine Tony. I wouldn’t be either. You don’t have to make excuses. I’ll stay away until the magic wears off.”
Steve’s hand slid over and covered Tony’s knee. “No, of course I don’t want to break up. I never wanted to break up. But if you want to, if you still want to… It’ll hurt. A lot. But I understand. If you don’t want to be with me anymore…” Steve’s voice broke. “I’ll let you go.”
“Thor’s Skype isn’t working right,” Steve explained.
“No… home…” Tony smacked his lips together, trying to rub wakefulness back into his eyes.
This is for my bday prompts for vaticancameos186 who wanted: "Tony being really jealous of someone who he thinks Steve really likes, but of course, at the end , he's set straight by Steve. Would be awesome if Sassy!Clint and Exasperated!Bruce is featured, but final decision is upto you, of course."
Tony startled away from the fridge, a bottle of Gatorade in one hand. “Jeez, Cap. You scared me.”
Steve twisted his face to press it into the crease of Tony’s arm, breathing him in. “I hate the cold.” There was a hairline fracture running through his voice.
Tony sighed. "Shit. I didn't mean to tell you like that."
“Did you guys make that for me?” Tony asked, hushed.
Tony blinked at him. “So you could ask her out, obviously. She was into you, and you obviously adore her.”
, Tony prayed desperately,
“Remember who gets sent the first pictures?”
Nat could hear the rustle of fabric as Steve shrugged. She could imagine the cheeky smirk he’d be shooting Tony. “Just because you don’t know them, doesn’t mean we don’t have them.”
Steve shook his head. He crossed the gym to stand in front of Tony. “Tony. Why are you avoiding me?”
Subject: You Can't Make This Shit Up
Steve wriggled his way down to press a messy kiss to Tony’s lips. “I love you.”
"Of course." Tony wasn't going anywhere for a long time.
“It was sent by a private courier,” the AI replied, and Tony was curious.
“You’re shivering.” Steve pulled Tony even deeper into his hold, and the warmth flooded his veins like a shot of brandy.
Mr. Stark cleared his throat. "Ah. Yes. Well. How concerning…"
"I'm so lucky to have you," Steve whispered into Tony's hair.
But Steve shuddered and sighed, eyes fixed on the mess covering his stomach. "It's okay, Tony. It's okay. I - I don't - it's -
“Only if you come with me,” Tony said stubbornly.
“It’s fine. She’s just happy to be touched, honestly.”
Steve hummed with pleasure and closed his lips around the head, sucking lightly before swallowing him down. Any blood that had been dilly-dallying about in other places of Tony’s body immediately got with the program and charged south until Tony was so hard he could give gold-titanium alloy a run for its money.
"I know. That's why I want both of you to be happy. Cause I love you so much. And I know you love me, and we're safe and secure. Besides, you're going to be spending a lot more of the next three months with Bucky than with me, so maybe it's a good time to feel things out. I have to go back to L.A. tomorrow anyway. You should talk to him, just the two of you. Explain everything."
Steve stabbed a piece of bitter, underripe cantaloupe with a fork. “It’s not your fault, Stark. You shouldn’t have to deal with my shit.”
I call your voicemail sometimes. Then I delete the message."
Tony resisted the urge to say,
Tony always knows how to fix it.
“Hey, Duckling!” Steve turned him to face the window. “Look! It snowed!”
There was someone he wanted to ask. But that someone had just asked him. Sort of. “No. There’s no one.”
and Tony was a good boy, so he wasn’t going to come.
For Happy Steve Bingo!
Steve looked down at his plate then back up at Tony. “Isn’t that what we’re doing right now?”
Tony swallowed heavily and was shoved unceremoniously out into the sand ring. Green grins surrounded him on all sides. He tracked Steve’s steps as he crossed the other side of the colosseum. Not Steve - Cap. His opponent. His target.
There was nothing but Steve and the cocoon of tentacles they were nestled in now. Tony didn't have to move to seek more pleasure - their captors controlled everything. It was so easy to sink into their hold and the solid warmth of Steve around, inside of him.
When Steve’s lungs started to burn, Tony pulled back, running the tip of his tongue over his bottom lip as he sucked in a sharp breath. Then he looked down.
Steve straightened up and shook his head affectionately. He was beautifully messy, the soft, summer wind doing nothing to whisk away the sweat that plastered his hair to his brow. “You love it out here. Besides, it’s not compost today, it’s food.” Steve pushed the leaves of the plant back, and Tony could see a little, green ball, just starting to blush orange. His lips quirked up into a smirk. “I’ll grow it, you eat it. Deal?”
Bucky shook his head, but let himself be taken away. All in all, it was nice to be out. He wanted the world to know that the two best men in the world belonged to him, wanted to scream from the rooftops how much he loved them both, how grateful he was that they loved him, loved each other, albeit in a different way. It was perfect and beautiful and deserved to be celebrated.
"Yup."
They hung in complete silence for one slow breath then Steve reached out and grabbed a stool from the corner. He pulled it up to the other side of the desk, facing Tony, and settled on it. He laid his hands flat on the desktop next to the pieces, careful not the touch anything. Tony’s fingers twitched and shook, but Steve’s were rock steady. “What do you need me to do?” he asked, voice pitched low since Tony was so close.
Tony looked deeply uncomfortable. "You don't have to buy me coffee, Steve. I'm like, really rich."
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF MY TEAM ANGST RUN. Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
Tony broke the surface of the water with a gasp. He flicked his hair back and tipped his face up to the sky, feeling the water droplets on his skin start to evaporate already in the baking, midday sun He ducked underwater again, pushing forward with strong strokes, and popped up again closer to shore.
Steve sat on the exam table, crinkling the paper under him and looking abashed. “Hi.”
“It’s never a bad time for you, Capsicle. Come on in. Take a seat.”
“That feels so good,” Steve breathed, and Tony choked a little, moaned, then picked up the pace again. “You like that? Being told how good you feel, how good you are?”
Refusing to miss him this time, Steve took off after the sound. Tony disappeared around the corner, and Steve crept after him, watching as he slipped out the front door and onto the porch. Steve looked out through the window and watched Tony settle on the porch swing, one foot tucked up, the bare toes from the other foot stretching down to rock him slowly back and forth.
Steve hummed again, and Tony sobbed, twisting. Steve’s tongue pushed forward, deeper, and he pushed his chin up against Tony’s perineum, working his prostate from the outside. Tony’s cock swelled impossibly harder and leaked, two fresh waves of pre-come spilling over Steve’s pale skin. Steve’s fingers dug in harder and he started to rock Tony back and forth, thrusting with his tongue. Tony’s ass was wet and sloppy and so, so needy, and all he could do was hold the fabric straps and let himself be moved, eyes hot, and throat dry, and cock
"I'm going to take this little monster for a walk." Clint dashed out of the workshop and into the elevator.
“Yeah. It was really windy the night we got him. Plus he is a little hurricane.”
When they parted, Steve struggled to catch his breath. “Really?” he couldn’t help but ask.
"Your side being that it's better to pretend to be my boyfriend, in front of my actual boyfriend, than deal with every woman at this party flirting with you?"
“It’s a big decision.”
He’d just check. If Tony was asleep, he’d go to sleep too and maybe tomorrow they could start fresh.
Tony said “affff” solemnly, then rattled his trowel around inside his bucket while Steve continued to dig halfheartedly in the damp sand. Tony’s trowel lifted, then froze, and Tony made a noise not entirely dissimilar from the one last week’s mugger had made when he’d turned around and found himself face-to-face with Captain America.
“Oh fuck, fuck, fuck, Steve please, oh my god.” Steve’s hot tongue pushed up against Tony’s hole, and Tony jerked against the chains. That
Steve’s cheeks lit up like a fireworks display, the flush cascading down his neck and into his collar, and Tony knew he had him. He rolled his hips again, rubbing his skin against the gap where Steve’s sleeve had pushed away from his glove. “Since you asked so nicely,” Steve muttered, dropping down to suck Tony down his throat again. He lifted his hand and wiggled his fingers, and Tony stretched up to pull a lube bottle at random from the drawer. He handed it down, and Steve drizzled it over his fingers without pausing his thoroughly devastating blowjob.
Steve's eyes dropped to Tony's mouth, his tongue darting out to lick his own. "I…"
Steve laughed. “Also a win. I do love you. So much. This afternoon was fun, but I’m glad to have my Tony back.”
"Cut!"
Tony burst out laughing. "Yeah. Yeah, that I can do."
Rating: E
Tony thought, and then there was the distinct feeling of gravity twisting in a way it absolutely should not. Tony struggled to breath and then -
“Hmm…” Tony shifted in his seat, moving closer. He started folding up his woolies and setting them on his bag down in the footwell.
Steve took three steps towards the bathroom then stopped. He’d been kicked out of his own room. It was as good an excuse as any to knock on Tony’s door. He took one more step then screeched to a halt. The door at the end of the hall was opening.
“I can’t believe I’m painting a mural on my own wall for once.”
They stopped when Tony’s phone started blasting its obnoxious, eighties rock ringtone, startling all of them. “Hello?”
“He’s practicing for my birthday present,” Tony said.
They shuffled towards the door, and Nat heard Steve whisper, “Holy shit,” under his breath.
Deathlok growled and charged forward. Tony tried to dodge again, but he was too slow, and three hundred pounds of metal and muscle crashed him through the closet door and pinned him to the far wall behind it. “Stamina?” Deathlok growled. “How’s this for stamina?”
The End.
Steve hit the floor, knocking the breath out of his lungs, his helmet skittering across the tile.
“What do you want, Tony? Please tell me what you want before it really hits. I need to know what’s okay.”
“I have the tow company number right here in my phone!” Steve sing-songed.
"I should think so. Cause if you did, that'd be a bit weird."
Bucky’s window opened automatically, and Tony cut through, corkscrewing through the air to slam to his feet in the middle of the open plan apartment.
For the Regency square.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve from behind and burrowed his face into his neck. He was warm and solid, steadying. “I stopped at the apartment and grabbed a few things. I want to spend the night here.”
We were talking xkcd in Team Canon chat and I couldn't help but give it a try! XD

“He’s alive.” That was Steve. Tony knew his voice. He purred into the firm heat of Steve’s chest as he settled in his arms.
“You sure?”
"Tony… are you okay?"
Tony looked up at him. "I'm so sorry you had to do that alone. And go to the doctor alone. I'm - I'm so sorry."
Tony stopped, peering at the white boxes and trying to figure out what Steve was talking about. But they weren’t dog houses. There weren’t any dogs in them. “Oh,” Tony said. “The
"I'm guessing it was another day with no mail from the papers."
"Shit. Are you okay?" Steve stepped closer, reaching out but not quite touching.
“Thank you,” he managed to get out, figuring he might as well placate him for now. Steve stood to go, needing to tell Tony. Even if he was being nice about it now, Greg having that information was a weapon he could unsheathe at any moment. He had no proof, but it seemed the popular media didn’t need that, nowadays. “Excuse me.”
"Nope!" Mr. Stark set the soldering iron down. "Won't be necessary. I'll look into it."
“It’s okay, you’re fine.” But Steve could see the way he shifted and squirmed and the pinch to the corners of his eyes.
Steve stepped aside and revealed the cake as Bucky stepped forward and threw his arm around Tony’s shoulder. “Welcome home, babe.” He kissed Tony’s cheek, and Tony leaned into it, but his eyes didn’t waver from the cake.
Steve twisted a little, trying to keep his eyes on the now empty highway, but distracted by the way Tony moved into his space.
turn around, but that would earn him at least another smack, probably worse, and as much as he loved testing his boundaries until they creaked, his ass was smarting now and he didn’t particularly want another.
Tony’s lips were warm and soft against Steve’s, not practiced or fancy, but comfortable and confident. He leaned forward against Steve’s chest and tipped his chin up to angle the kiss deeper. Steve’s arms were full of Tony’s solid, warm weight, and he could taste the hint of cherry soda on Tony’s tongue when he parted his lips and let it dart inside.
"Hot…" Anthony murmured and then he tipped sideways until he was leaning against Tony's shoulder. His eyes closed, his hand sliding down his tummy, through a mess of cracker crumbs, mouth hanging open.
“Yeah?” It’s barely a word.
“Uh…” Steve frowned down at the cash register. It didn’t seem like Tony was going to let this go. If he refused to explain it, they’d probably lose a customer, but if he did, Tony would be so freaked out by Steve’s weird obsession that Steve would probably lose his job. “It’s nothing, really…” Steve said quietly, praying that Tony would brush it off.
[11:37] Steve: And I assume something horrible is happening.
Fluff, established relationship, laughing, love.
“Oh my god, Steve?”
Steve’s eyes started to heat again. “We broke things off for a reason, Tony.”
Tall, blond, and broad-shouldered, the man - Captain Rogers, he hoped - was dressed in his dress blues, the buttons shiny and the creases razor straight. He had a kind smile that tweaked up one side of his mouth higher than the others, and a hesitancy that made Tony breathe out a relieved breath.
he growled, chest vibrating, and Tony tipped over the edge with a startled cry. He came hard and fast and completely out of his control, spraying come over his chest and up to his chin, splattering the front of Steve’s armour with white, sullying the star over his heart.
He takes another step, and he’s right at Tony’s side now, almost touching him. The puppy looks up and wags her tail, squirming in Tony’s hold, but he doesn’t let her go. He turns and looks at Steve now, with those melted chocolate eyes, and they flicker a bit - just a bit - and how has Steve not noticed that before? Not noticed the way heat creeps in at the corners of Tony’s expression whenever Steve is near?
“Two hundred bucks,” Tony said, smirking, eyes never leaving Steve’s.
“Oh right. It’s next week? Okay. What should I wear?”
Tony stilled, on his way to the workshop door. “Bucky?” A new layer of adrenaline flushed over the first. He and Bucky hadn’t spent an inordinate amount of time together since he’d moved to the tower, but all the time they had spent in the same room had felt
"I'm pretty sure if I told my therapist about all these late night calls she'd tell me it was a self-destructive cycle or something. I can't stop though. If I don't have the phone, then you're - Anyway. It doesn't matter. You'll never find out."
Stuckony!
"Sure. I'll grab a table in the corner."
He distracts the thugs long enough that Tony manages to tackle Crooked Nose to the ground and get a good shot in that’s either going to rename him as Straight Nose or Even Crookeder Nose. Blood spills down over his cheeks and mouth and Tony’s fist.
Steve covered Tony’s hand with his own where it still rested on his sleeve. “I already like you, Tony. A lot.”
[12:02] Steve: Tony, please call me.
Tony ducked his head as he grinned. “Fair enough.” He hopped up on the edge of the stage, and Steve sat beside him, a careful foot between them.
This was their favourite game, Steve taking his time, Tony begging for more, faster. Tony was pretty sure they had about an equal win-rate, and he was also pretty sure that he was a shoe-in tonight. He pulled out all the stops, moaning, gasping, rocking up to meet Steve’s shallow thrusts. And, sure enough, it wasn’t long before Steve’s hand clenched around Tony’s thigh and he pushed forward, sheathing himself fully inside Tony with a gasp.
See baby!Tony/Ant in the Iron Man sleeper

Next up was a thin, pale, shapely woman named Deborah, 31, sporting a fitted red dress. She was cute enough that Steve swiped right, but no message popped up.
Ultimates, Secrets, Greg, fluff.
“I love you. I don’t want to break up.”
Deathlok leaned in, lips peeled back in a sneer. Despite the damage and the scarring, one blue eye met Tony’s and it was all Steve. Still Steve.

“It’s all yours,” Steve agreed, shedding his pants and underwear. Steve crawled back up over Tony drawing a path up kisses up his chest. Tony was warm and solid in his arms, and he couldn’t help pausing at Tony’s left hand, rested on his stomach, and kissing the place where a golden band now sat. The rest of Tony’s clothes disappeared in a heartbeat.
But that was nothing to the nervousness he felt waiting for the door at the other end of the room to open.
Tony imagined it wouldn’t be two for much longer, not this time.
What could it be?
Steve laughed. "Getting paid just takes all the fun out of something, though, doesn't it?"
For Serenity on the MCU discord who gave me the idea!
Thor grinned and tossed the bottle in the garbage.
Set shortly after the epilogue of Trouble.
Tony burst into fireworks, and when the flashes of colour and light disappeared he was flat on his back on the stone floor of the cell, shaking with bone-deep cold instead of pleasure. He couldn’t help wishing he could stay in the fantasies just a little bit longer.
“I - well, yeah. Of course. That sounds wonderful.”
Tony cut off with a muffled gasp as Steve hauled forward and pressed his lips to Tony, arms gripping his biceps almost hard enough to bruise. He was warm and soft, and
Tony laughed. “Are you going to dodge me for three days every time we fight?”

It made sense, in a sick sort of way. If Steve went soft, he wouldn’t be able to choke Tony and an orgasm was the best way to make that happen. Then any pain would be Steve’s - the sharp shocks of overstimulation - and Steve would vastly prefer that.
Tony froze. Steve Rogers was asking him about Grindr? Who had even told him about Grinder? Who had told him about online dating? Who had told him about
Tony ground his teeth together. “I’m handling it.”
“I’m single.”
“Don’t worry. It’s of no consequence to me who my brother is sleeping with, and it’d take up far too much of my time trying to keep track anyway. If you’re pleasing him for now, all the better. SI stock goes up when he’s in a good mood, and I’d like my company in good shape when I get it back. I’ll keep your sordid little secret, Captain.” Greg laughed again, not kindly.

“You are.”
Bucky looked up to see Steve handing Tony a glass of scotch, watching on with barely contained amusement. "I'm going to have to say something at the beginning of next lecture, aren't I?" Bucky whined.
“So you hung around in alleys waiting for me to show?”
“Thank you. Well, as long as everyone’s okay, I’ll head back to bed.”
Steve hadn't figured out who Tony was until the next morning when he woke to delicious, expensive, Italian roast being delivered by room service, and found Tony on the balcony, speaking briskly on the phone in what sounded like very confident, if not perfectly fluent, Mandarin. They'd had breakfast, Tony working, and Steve reading the paper, then shared a kiss, a thank you, and gone their separate ways.
Steve flushed. “I think it’s really incredible. I can’t believe you built that. I mean, I can, because you’re really incredible, but… um.”

“I know.”
Steve, on the other hand, was completely immune to coffee and entirely susceptible to the king-sized, AirCell™, MemoryLux mattress Tony’d had installed in his room. He was also susceptible to the draw of Wikipedia keeping him up until well past bedtime.
“Yeah?”
"Sometimes, I walk past your room, and I miss you so damn much it makes me want to break things. Or build things. I miss when things were easy… Fuck that. They were never easy. I miss when
"Then you need to hang out with nicer people, geez."
“Okay, I just have to ask -” Steve took a deep breath. “Did you feel it too?”
"Your flight too?" Bucky asked, watching Tony scowl at his phone.
“Umm… actually I was thinking maybe I wouldn’t go.”
"What would the meeting be regarding?"
Tony thought. He would very much enjoy the show. “Who is this from?”
“Me too.” Tony pressed his face to Steve’s chest. “I wasn’t sure if you’d want to see me.”
Every time Steve spoke, Hill or Fury or Rumblow would interrupt, and Tony had given up on trying to interject on his behalf, besides, this meeting had gone on way past Tony’s expertise and solidly into military strategy. He wished, not for the first time, that Rhodey were here.
All songs released in the 1970s!
Steve had really been hoping this would be the former; he was looking forward to dinner with Tony. They went to lunch a lot, but there was something cozy, and off-the-clock, and
"All my sensors indicate that Mr. Stark is in the shower, Captain Rogers."
"Right…" Some night when Steve wasn't there. Cause Bucky, it seemed, hated Tony's boyfriend. But Steve loved Bucky. And Tony loved Bucky. And they just…
“Pff, tea is nothing. Nice try, Rogers.”
“Come on, man, we said no friends or family.” Rhodey pointed accusingly at Clint.
Tony waited for the punchline. Or for a piano to fall on his head. When neither of those things happened, he decided all he could do was tell the truth. “I thought it was a date too.”
Tony woke up appallingly early the next morning. He pressed a kiss to Steve's cheek, careful not to wake him, got dressed, and headed off for make up. Bucky wasn't there, but when Tony arrived on set, he saw him chatting to one of the sound guys.
Tony hadn’t stood a chance, really. Now they were gushing over acrylics and gouache, and Tony was the wobbly, squeaky third wheel, who tried to break into a polite, interested smile whenever Steve shot a look his way. But those looks were getting fewer and farther between, and, really, at thirty-six minutes, it was time to admit your date was now on a date with someone else and bow out gracefully, right?
"Did Captain America just make a joke?" Tony's eyebrow quirked up.
“Yeah…” Steve sighed again, burrowing his face under Tony’s jaw. His breath was warm but his nose was cold. “Just a long couple of days.”
“Deal.” Tony held out his hand, and Steve shook it.

Steve looked about thirty seconds from needing a paper bag.
Bucky sighed and dropped his chin to his fist, watching Tony up at the chalkboard, carefully copying out a formula from his homework sheet. When he'd decided to take these night classes, there were several things he hadn't been expecting.
Tony grinned like a shark. “Pick out a ring, Bucky Barton, cause my last name’s Stark.”
“Since when do they mix grounders with flyers?” Tony asked, the screams of the Skrull crowd dimmed in the hallway where they stood.
“You don’t get on with your folks?”
He reached the hospital and bolted through the front doors, letting his uniform speak for itself when the shocked security guard flinched in his direction. Tony’s room was on the third floor. He slowed as he pushed through the stairwell door out into Tony’s hallway. It was quiet. His feet didn’t seem to want to carry him any farther but he pushed them on, kept going until -

Bucky glared, the effect somewhat dampened by the cloud of white hair sticking up around his face and the smears of flour over his cheeks. “I -” He rolled his eyes and folded down over the counter with a groan. “I squeezed. With the wrong hand. And the flour bag… exploded.”
“…Friends with benefits?”
“Tony? Come on, stay with me.”
Steve pressed himself to the wall and made his way down the hall towards the sounds of battle. Another explosion rocked the foundation of the castle, and dust poured down from the ceiling. Steve dipped his eyes to the ground and blinked, keeping the showering of brick dust from falling in his eyes.
Thanks to wynnesome for helping come up with this idea!
"Well then." Steve pushed up to his feet and held out a hand for Tony. "Let's see what this body can do."
Their hands were still wound together, but more like an embrace than a challenge. The back of Steve’s hand was pressed to the table, Tony’s lying placidly on top.

All of this was so new, Tony wasn’t quite sure how to categorize it. Steve and Bucky had started dating, but hadn’t told anyone. Tony, as it happened, found out only three days later and the resulting
Steve shifted, and Tony could feel the bulge in his pants, hardly contained by the kevlar padding.
Tony snorted and was set off into wilder peals. “Baking what? A life-sized Hulk cake?”
“Thank you. Must have dumped them in there by mistake.” Steve started lacing up.

When the numbers on his tablet screen started blurring together, Tony pushed up off the couch and wandered into the penthouse kitchen. It was late - or early depending on how you looked at it - but sleep eluded him, and now he was hungry.
Steve pulled back to furrow his brow up at Tony, and Tony bit back a bereft whimper at the loss of wet heat. “Aren’t you too tired?”
There was something pained and defiant in Steve’s eyes, almost begging Tony to tell him to fuck off, needing that punishment or closure or something. And Tony knew the feeling, as surely as he knew that it would never be that easy.
Steve brushed his fingers over the front of the reactor once more then stepped back. “Tony? Anytime.”
Rated: T
Bucky grabbed Tony's face between his hands and pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Like a house on fire. Let's get this shoot over with so I can see Steve before he leaves, yeah?"
Tony’s brow creased and he rocked back on his heels. “Unless - oh were you going to ask someone? You just said last week you were gonna go stag with Bucky and Peggy, and I thought maybe you wouldn’t mind. I’ll split the money with you. It’s mostly just to see the look on their faces.”
Not wanting to waste time starting up his computer to check the schedule, Tony made his way down the hall to his exam room, and knocked before opening the door.
The blindfold meant Steve had no idea what was happening beyond what he could feel, but every now and then, Tony would twitch or whimper. Steve couldn’t help but imagine the tentacles exploring Tony further, curling between his legs, touching him. Guilt soured the appeal of the fantasy, but his body didn’t care. Steve whimpered out apologies as his cock shifted in Tony’s mouth, cutting off his air supply.
Steve wasn’t supposed to be prone to damage from cold the way a normal human was, and if he was, if he needed the heat packs stuffed in Tony’s shoes and the extra coat he’d wrapped around his shoulders, then they were in trouble. There was only enough for one.
It was easier, with the whole group. He could convince himself that this was no different than if they’d gone as a group of friends. But when he stepped out of the bathroom in the extremely luxurious suit Tony had somehow acquired for him - perfectly fitted - Tony stood far too close and tucked a white flower in his buttonhole with a smile. It matched the one Tony was wearing.
“Very good hands.” The hands in question burrowed under the waistband of Steve’s jeans. “Very good… but I’d rather they were all over me than digging around in that uh -”
Tony raised both eyebrows, wondering how Steve intended to finish that sentence - toys? - but that made Steve cut off and bite his bottom lip. "It's - it's fine. If you help me upstairs, I can…"
And yet, back in his own room was no better. Steve piled on all his blankets and before long he was warm again, but he couldn’t sleep. All he could think about was how Tony’s face had fallen when he left.
“Oh shit.” Bucky grinned back at him. “Guess I have no choice then. Your boyfriend don’t mind?”
The cover was off the drain, and a long, thin, dark purple
"He didn't give me his personal number," Steve gritted out.
“Sergeant Barnes’ floor.”
“Yeah, and his new boyfriend.”
“I think I’m going to die of boredom before exposure,” Tony sighed, rolling from the moth-bitten couch onto the floor and letting himself flop there.
"Oh, god. The serum. It's gone. I've lost my powers."
“Best birthday ever. All I ever wanted was you two.” He leaned back against Bucky’s chest and Steve leaned down to kiss him silly. Bucky buried his face in Steve’s hair and everything was warm and perfect and
For the first time since the drug had hit, Steve felt his head clear and his body breath a heavy sigh of relief. The intense need was still there, but diminished somewhat by his last orgasm. He shifted back a bit, the tentacles allowing them a few inches to breath, and he caught Tony's eye.
“This neighbourhood ain’t welcoming to that kind of shit.”
Besides, they were never cold when they fell asleep, tangled in each others arms, sweaty, sated, huffing soft breaths against the skin of each others shoulders. It was hard to think about needing heavy blankets then.
“I just came to bring you dinner.”
Captain America, in full uniform, was running down the stairs and charging across the floor to where Tony was. When he saw Tony, he
“I said no. I didn’t want to dance with him.”
"Well." Tony smoothed his hands over the keyboard and lowered himself gingerly back into his chair. At least the most embarrassing stuff had been inadvertently censored. He just needed to explain the first few lines. "So, when I said perfect guy, what I meant was -"

Then the lights went out with a pop.
He shouted and stomped and threw every plate from his cupboard on the floor until they were all smashed. Up on his screen, his secret cameras were supposed to show Tony admiring the watch, putting it on, hoping to find the one who’d sent it and thank them. But instead, he’d given the watch away, without even wrapping it around his wrist. The nerve!
“You say that like you think I’ll give one shit, darling.” Tony started unpacking styrofoam and laying it out on the table.
“You have to! J locked the tower down, oh my god, Bucky. What are you doing?”
"'And it was still hot,'" Steve read softly. He closed the book.

“Are you sure?”
“For your paintings.”
Steve paused, ears straining for the sound of engines one more time, but there was nothing. Help wasn’t coming.
Tony refilled his glass, spilling four hundred dollar scotch on his desk and nearly soaking the photo. No one had known the Batman was Wayne back then, but Cap had clearly known because in the corner of the photo, Wayne had written
As soon as Tony was gone, Steve let himself sink to his knees by the side of the lake, fairy wings drooping into the damp grass. Tony looked beautiful in his magical clothing, but Steve had thought he was beautiful from day one, covered in dirt and soot and bruises, cowering in the corner of Stane’s stable. Tony’s wish had been to go to the ball and meet the prince he’d been destined to marry before his father had died and his fortune had been lost to Lord Stane.
There was a brief pause, then J began to read.

“So.” Tony looked down at the scattered containers, open dip packets, and spilled noodles. “Conclusion is…”
It had been a fabulous night, one of the best hook-ups Steve had ever had, and now he was about to have one hell of a souvenir, and he needed to let Tony know.
“Oof!” Tony startled out of the doze he’d drifted into when a heavy weight landed on his lap. He blinked awake, the book he’d been failing to read slipping from his fingers.
"I have a job."
“This has been the best year of my life, too, but I think we can do even better, don’t you?”
in strong, beautiful cursive.
They would have to run, now, no doubt pursued on both sides, but at least they’d be running together.
Tony managed to behave himself as they flew back to the tower, then he sprung out of his seat and dragged Steve off towards the penthouse. Steve let himself be dragged, unable to hold back a smile of his own. It was pretty wild to see Tony like this. His features were softer, smoother, his face a little rounder, and his trademark goatee was missing. They’d estimated that Tony had been blasted back to around twenty-three or twenty-four, and it was hard to believe he was around the age Steve had been when he’d joined the army.
Steve crouched down in front of Tony again who reached for him, a huge grin plastered across his face. Steve tugged him into his lap and held him on one knee while they petted the dog again. She sprung to her feet and shoved her face into Tony’s stomach making him screech with laughter and fist a handful of her fur in each hand.
“Or you could, you know, help.”
Brett was an immediate no, the popped polo collar enough on its own, but when matched with his Trump hat, Steve barely paused long enough to read his name.

“Just one request,” Tony says, hearing the footsteps of their teammates down the street.

“It is,” Steve said softly. “It’s my responsibility to bring us together, keep us all safe. Teamwork is vital to that.”
"You'd do this with me? I mean, you - I - I don't think I'd be a very good father…"
Now that he was properly awake, Steve realized the voice belonged to Tony. He blinked in the dark until he found Tony’s face, eyes still closed, concern furrowing his brow. “Tony?”
“I would give you the world if I could.” Tony pressed a kiss to the side of Steve’s face, and to his surprise, Steve leaned into it. “They’re going to come save us. We’re going to be okay. It’s going to suck for a bit, but we’re going to be okay. And you don’t have to be strong for me all the time, darling. You can tell me how hard it is. You can fall backwards; I’ll catch you.”
“Tony?!”
“Super sure. It’ll be good data, actually. See how it handles different proportions.”
Tony's stomach dropped with disappointment. He'd thought they were flirting, but clearly they weren't. He resisted the urge to sigh. "Well. I can see how a man wouldn't want for much with that waiting at home. Where's the almost?"
Rise posed
"Hey!"
“I know, but it’s what you want. Right? I read that right?” Tony turned Steve until he could see his face.
“I can sleep at the end of the book, JARVIS, right now we’re go-go-go. Because deadlines. And potatoes.”
“Cap?”
“You and Peter both,” Steve replied with a smile.
Just two more bingo squares left!
Tony let out a tense breath. “Okay, perfect.” Tony pushed Steve flat on his back and twisted around so he was half on top of Steve, Steve still half in his lap. “Plenty of time to enjoy my last few hours as a spring chicken, yeah?”
Tony shoved his hands in his pockets and huddled his shoulders up against the wind. It didn’t matter that hot tears were sliding over his cheeks; he was all wet and wind-flushed anyway - no one would notice. No one would care. No one was even out here.
Tony blinked then spluttered, “What - I - no, you can’t - no -”
Steve grinned down at him, then leaned back, tucking his pencil behind his ear. “But I knew you were here to catch me.”
Steve smiled as warm as he could and opened his arms, drawing Tony in against his chest. He held him tightly, one hand coming up to cup the back of his head. "Don't worry, Tony, I always save the best one for you."
The very bad man thought and thought and finally he came up with a plan.
They shambled back up to Steve’s room, hand in hand.
"No. No you're not. I've - there's something for me too. Has been for a while," Tony admitted. "I -" He leaned in closer. "Can I kiss you?" he whispered.
Thank you to sheron for the prompt that inspired this piece :D
to show me the rest."
The wedding reception still raged on down the street, but Tony had slipped out early, feeling the thudding of his heart low in his core. This was going to suck. A lot. But he had no choice.
It was always the same for them. After they fell into bed together - after the touches and the kisses, and the laughter, and the pleasure - Tony wanted a glass of wine and the TV, Steve wanted a quick jog on the treadmill downstairs, and Bucky wanted to curl up with his book. Soon, Steve would come back up and they’d all three crawl into bed again, this time with sleep on their minds instead of other things.
“Not telling.” Steve nuzzled into his neck. “I promise you’ll like it. It’s just ten of us. Nothing big.”
“Sweetheart…”
“I think everyone else is up,” she said, with a knowing twinkle. And Steve resisted the urge to blush. “I just wanted to make sure everything was okay. You don’t need anything do you? More blankets?”
Tony pulled back and raked his eyes suggestively down to where Steve’s top button was popped open. “I more meant because then we get this honeymoon, but sure, get all sappy about it.”

"We should probably just leave him alone until then," Steve said.
so I think we should make the most of that too.” He reached around and shoved his hand in Steve’s back pocket then squeezed. Hard.
Tony reached towards his dark shape and wiggled his fingers, knowing Steve’s super-powered eyes could pick him out. Steve crossed the room in two strides and folded over Tony, arms working their way under his back so he could hold them close together. “You’re wearing my clothes,” he growled softly.
Steve took a shaky breath. "Yeah.”
Bucky laughed and it was like warm tea settling in Tony’s stomach. He turned his face to grin into the pillow. “Alright,” Bucky said. “Anything for you. Happy Birthday.”
“Uh…”
a dog person, and he had to admit, it was pretty amazing watching Tony enjoy that so much. He also hadn’t known you could get dogs that small that weren’t quite as… pocket-y as the purse-bound dog in the building. Steve shook himself. It would be stupid to think about getting a pet for a kid that wasn’t really a kid. Tony wouldn’t be a baby long enough for it to matter.
Steve was clunking, awkward, unsure.
But three days later, Mr. Stark still had not looked into it. In fact, he was doing very little in the way of work as nearly all his time was spent with Captain Rogers.

Left alone, Steve suddenly felt like all eyes were on him, watching, judging, but those people were here too, so there was nothing to judge. He found a small table tucked in the far left curve of the circle and sat down at it, his back to the railing leading up, facing out to the rest of the room, the stage to his right.
“This feels like a trap,” he muttered.
Tony takes a sharp hit to the jaw and tumbles backwards until he’s pinned against the wall, but his own knuckles connect more than once, and he’s pleased at how well he’s holding his own. Then he hears a new voice shouting from the end of the alleyway.

"I know, but he's clearly uncomfortable around me, and I don't know, maybe I said something that upset him? And if you talked and explained, maybe he'd tell you what I need to apologize for. And you two could even date without me for a little while and see how it went and if he wanted to get to know me."
Tony reached down and pulled hard on the seat lever, dropping Steve flat and knocking a gasp loose. Tony bent down and kissed Steve hard then worked his way along his jaw to behind his ear. He nipped at his earlobe then leaned in and whispered. “From the fact that I already called a tow truck ten minutes ago and a town car is on its way to take us the rest of the way to the very fancy hotel I booked for us so we can enjoy each other for the next sixteen hours.”
He’d show up in Antarctica for Steve though.
"Are those?" Steve leaned. "Duck band-aids?"
“I think I just did. See you later.” Steve pushed to his feet and walked out, leaving a stunned Tony behind.

Steve chuckled in reply then pushed up on his elbow to look down at Tony. He pulled free with a wince and a sigh, and Tony squirmed as lube and come spilled out after him. He traced the edge of Steve’s jaw with a single finger, and Steve’s eyes fluttered shut then opened again. “Nowhere else I’d rather be…”

Tony remained unmoved. There had definitely been some cheeky grins and doe eyes. “Look. It’s like - imagine you met - uh - Einstein. In a cafe.”
He frowned. The scent clung to the back of his throat and stayed there, making the gay, lively room suddenly feel cloying and oppressive. He eyed up a couple at a table to his left, their heads pressed close together as they talked. Steve couldn't help but wonder if the man had a wife waiting at home… a kid…
It was cold out there.
Tony pushed back to his feet, ignoring the way his legs shook, and lifted his hands again, squaring up to fight.
“I just have to push one button…”
“I’m feeling young and reckless,” Tony said, eyes twinkling, “better get me home and out of harm’s way.”
“What?” Iron Man repeated, and then the faceplate popped open.
Tony nodded. “Cap - Captain Rogers?” He cleared his throat.

Something stirred deep in Steve's gut. He couldn't say he wasn't interested. "You sure you want to see this naked?"
“Oh, fuck, no. Tell me you didn’t tell everyone else,” Bucky begged. “Clint will never let me live this down. Steve will take my oven away.”

Steve was his soulmate. Tony had felt it the second their eyes had met. Surety had surged through him, pulling an intense wave of affection and longing with it. But it hadn’t been the time, with the boy’s life at risk, and now Steve needed to be alone with his son.
“Hey, Tony.” She grinned at him.
“It’s the only way down, Iron Man!” he called back as he launched himself across the floor towards the window. He curled up into a ball as he collided with the glass and heard a cacophony of cursing flood the comms. Wind whistled past as he plummeted towards the ground, holding the shield underneath him to try and take some of the impact.
And tonight. He’d shown up with a bottle of wine and a flyer for a new pizza place, planning to joke about cooking for Steve. They were going to watch The Princess Bride - Steve had never seen it. But instead…
Steve was slick and hot and huge and every push deep inside Tony set off a new barrage of fireworks under his skin. As much as he wanted to watch, Tony’s eyes fell closed again as he arched back on the sheets, hips kicking up to meet Steve each time he bottomed out.
Tony chuckled and shook his head. “Not a chance.”
One hundred and forty-seven pounds of fur and excited affection flung itself at Steve, and he rocked back against Tony’s chest with an

“I think two hundred years ought to do it,” Strucker said.
“Oh my god, we’re stuck,” Tony hollered. “We’re going to die here, naked, trapped between two beds. Housekeeping is going to have to rescue us.” He snorted and set off laughing again.
“God, Tony.” Steve slumped back on his heels and let out a long, slow breath.
Steve stomach dropped out. “Oh god, I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have taken that from you for a stupid bet.”
“Okay.” Everything about Tony softened. “Okay. It’s okay, Steve.” He dropped his eyes to the floor then smiled. He rolled his gaze back up, his soft smiling twisting into a cheeky grin. “When you’re ready, though? I don’t think I’ll mind.” He winked then climbed up into the front of the van to talk to Clint and Jan.
He just couldn't do it anymore. This had to be his last attempt.
“Steve - will you -” Tony wiped away an imaginary tear. “Will you sleep with me?” He popped open the case to reveal two bright orange earplugs, specially fabricated to fit Steve’s ears exactly.
“Oh my god,” Tony repeated for the nth time.
“Steve, please. You can call me Steve. Is it alright if I call you Tony?”
“I’m sorry I made you think you were crazy for seventy years,” Tony says, not sure what kind of Hallmark card this situation calls for.
Tony squirmed where he sat. “There's… there’s one thing I’m worried about,” he admitted.
Tony’s hands clenched on Steve’s hips. Everything ached with longing, with despair, with loss. He wanted to be free of it, just for three days, he wanted to give in. “I want it to be how it used to be,” he said, and he hated how broken it sounded.
"I - nothing's wrong. Everyone's fine. I just…
“Hmm,” Greg hummed. “Run off and warn your sweetheart.” He shook the ice cubes in his glass and his voice dropped low, almost contemplative. “We may loathe each other… but he’s still my brother, Captain.”
"It's not that kind of situation," Steve said tightly. "Like, I said, it's personal. I need to speak directly to Mr. Stark about a personal matter."
It was a bit silly, sure, but Bucky and Tony weren’t wrong. It was warm and comfy down here.
Steve poured it in the cake pan and put them in the oven. They both hovered nervously, watching the timer countdown. “We can’t stand here for thirty minutes,” Steve said,
Steve grinned and tugged Tony back down into his arms. “I wouldn’t dare.”
Steve grinned. It was a position he was painfully familiar with, and there was something gratifying about seeing it directed at someone else for once.
“Don’t you want to go dancing?”
“…Feel?”
Steve tried not to blush as he realized he had no idea what Bucky even liked to drink. "I'm with Bucky Barnes?" Steve tried.
