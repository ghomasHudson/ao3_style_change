“Uh, yes, you do,” Tony counters, throwing one naked leg over Steve’s waist. Steve has this weird thing where he kind of makes Tony want to be an octopus, just so he could have eight arms touching him at all times. “Now shut your pretty mouth and go back to sleep.”
“Steve,” Tony interrupts him, and he hates what’s he about to say as much as he knows it needs to be said. “We’re not married.”
Well, okay. “Clearly we haven’t done a good enough job selling that, though, if she thinks you’re gonna cheat on me that easily.”
Steve frowns. “You shouldn’t drink anything stronger,” he says, and it sounds grandfatherly to his own ears, but he doesn’t care. He barely has the chance to talk to Tony anymore – the least he can do is tell him the truth.
He takes the time to investigate the bedroom, instead. It’s a nice way to keep his hands occupied as his mind races at light speed.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “I… suppose so,” he admitted. “I always thought I had a way with dogs, and people talked about it, but I never thought it was something…”
There’s no cause for alarm, though. It’s just Tony, hurrying inside with rushed steps, moving through the crowd to reach his seat. He’s wearing a grey suit that’s definitely more expensive than anything Steve's ever owned, but his tie is a little crooked and his breath is uneven. He’s wearing
“Madam?” A weak voice called. Tony jumped, startled – Ayesha’s guards. To be honest, he had completely forgotten they were there. “What are we supposed to do?”
As Tony’s hand takes him to his climax, Steve can’t help but think this—Tony laid bare, at his most open, lost in ecstasy—this isn’t his. This—this burning, stunning fire that’s in everything Tony does—it’s not his life. It’s at odds with him in ways so fundamental Steve can’t even begin to process the idea of having it.
On his way, Tony takes in everything around him, trying to note the details of whatever is different about the place in Steve’s head. Unsettlingly, though, everything seems to be exactly the same as Tony remembers the real compound to be like, back then. He even comes across Natasha on the way, and she greets him quietly with a smile. If Tony didn’t know better, he’d say he went back in time.
Tony doesn’t seem to mind, though, his smile growing, his hand clutching the sleeve of Steve’s jacket. He leans forward, his head turning so he’s turned towards Steve’s ear. He tilts his chin and his goatee touches Steve’s ear, sends a shudder through his whole body. “Then what are we waiting for?”
“I… don’t know?” Tony said, sounding perplexed by the question. “I mean, we’d probably need to get you a new wardrobe, in the first place. Not that you don’t look cute walking around in shirts that could swallow you or anything, but it would hardly be practical in the long term.” His voice travelled to Steve’s chest, sweet but clueless, completely unaware of the thought that had been frightening him for so long. As if it was unthinkable. “And, uh, I guess JARVIS would need some upgrades to take into account when ordering food, to watch for your dietary restrictions. And—I don’t know, what else would you need?” he mused, and Steve could see his face clearly in his mind, his tongue sticking out as whenever he thought of something new, his bright, clever eyes already filled with ideas. “Oh, yeah, of course—physical therapy for your back, probably.”
Steve’s hands hurt, and he realized he was clutching his elbows, embracing himself as he sat up on Stark’s couch. He had
Steve frowned, puzzled but relieved, and waited until the stranger’s silhouette disappeared in the distance before going home.
“Yes,” he says - too breathlessly, perhaps, too fast, but he—he doesn’t know how to do this, how to match Tony’s smoothness.
The song changes to a slower melody Steve doesn’t recognize. Tony adjusts almost immediately, pulling Natasha closer and turning their small show into a slow, steady sway. His lips curl in a smile, his laugh lines evident in his cheeks. It’s not his wedding, but it could be, from the amount of presence he hands to every step he takes. He makes it seem so easy it could almost be rehearsed, but there’s a natural quality to his every movement, perfectly in tune with the rhythm, almost as if the music was made just for him.
“Or—or maybe I can, but I shouldn’t, and I also can’t, I. I really think I can’t. It’s just, I don’t know. Anything that hurts, hurts more coming from you.” He inhaled, air filling his lungs like needles. “Like… a million, a bazillion times more. I can’t explain it.” He exhaled, his chest empty, his eyes burning. “Don’t ask me to explain it.”
The thought hits Steve like a brick on the back of his head. He shifts in place, his mind a mess, unable to follow its usual course of thoughts, inebriated by Tony’s presence. The casual talk, the closeness, the excessive friendliness – is Tony flirting with him? The idea sends a rush through his whole body, but he—he isn’t sure; and, even if it is true, he doesn’t know what to say, how to reciprocate. The only thing that comes to his mind, clear and desperate, is what he can’t say:
It was the email’s fault, Steve knew. All this time – nearly a year without speaking – and Bucky chose to send him an email.
Of fucking course, Tony doesn’t sleep. He doesn’t think he has ever felt less inclined to sleep in his life, and that’s something, coming from him.
And now, there Tony was, counting Steve’s breaths in the dark, and maybe he had fallen asleep already, because they were beginning to sound—strange.
When they finally get out of Tony’s cabin, the door closes behind them. They stare at each other, standing awkwardly.
The goal was, in Bucky’s words, to catch up. He and Gail were doing fine, the email said, but they – Jesus fucking Christ –
Stark scoffs. “I think he will, darling.” His casual tone is forced. “We—me and him—we have definitely not done anything even remotely close to this.”
“SHIELD has informed him we think it’s best if he doesn’t have a Twitter account,” Natasha, who’s there to have lunch with Pepper, says, and even through her supreme spy training Tony can tell she has to try hard to keep an even expression. “For his… reputation.”
“I want to start by thanking you for all the aid you have provided us,” he says, and there’s a rehearsed quality for every word. He himself doesn’t seem comfortable saying it, as if he’s only doing it because he must. “Without your generous contribution, we’d be doomed.”
Tony isn’t oblivious to his look, quirking up an eyebrow and giving Steve a wicked grin as he leans forward and palms his thighs, opening his legs. “Glad to please,” he says with a wink, and Steve lets out a surprised laugh that ends when Tony covers his mouth with a kiss.
The elevator stopped and the doors opened, and Tony almost breathed a sigh of relief, until he realized that meant he'd have to take Steve's hand again.
He doesn’t really know where he’s going with this. He only knows there’s a pulsing urge in his chest to try to make sense of everything he’s seen so far. He wants to ask
Steve looks away, at the ground, his expression growing pained. “You and Ms. Potts? I knew there was something between the two of you, before, and—and then, I mean, you talked about her so often, and you call her ‘love’ and everything, so, I thought…” He turns towards Tony, those bright eyes looking impossibly blue with that same shy, hesitant hope. “Aren’t you?”
When Tony comes, Steve feels his spunk fill him up, and a part of him wishes it could just stay there, not leak out. He wants to keep Tony inside of him as much as possible.
(If Tony is honest, it’s not that he never blamed Barnes for his parents – especially not there, at the bunker, when it felt like the world was falling over his head. It’s just that afterwards, that blame was too hollow to hold onto, and, when he was forced to face the prisoner behind the Winter Soldier’s terrifying aura, Tony couldn’t blame Barnes any more than he, as a teenager, blamed the car’s brakes.)
“Good?” Tony asks, and the hesitance is his voice is too much. Arousal floods Steve’s every thought, and it feels absurd, downright
Tony also asks a lot of questions. Sometimes his questions make Steve tense up involuntarily, but most of the time, they’re small things, details about Steve that no one else ever cared to know. He asks Steve what he thinks of rainy days (
There’s a sound similar to the ghost of a muffled laughter next to him. Howard turns to find Tony, scribbling a piece of parchment on his lap.
“Anthony will be so happy to have you around,” Stark insisted. Steve rolled his eyes – he vehemently refused to refer to Stark’s cat as anything else. “Please. I’ll give you fluffy pillows.”
“Okay, so, anyway, Sinatra kind of worked. And I thought, I mean, I wanted to… I wanted to talk to you. So I thought I’d text you – keep it very casual, low pressure, nothing that could scare you off – and just… keep it going. Slowly.” His face is all flushed now, and he’s panting, breathless, as if the effort to speak is really big. “And, again, it kind of worked. But then it didn’t, and, look, I’m overextending myself over here, right? But I just felt that, that I really needed to say it, all at once, so everything is on the open. All the cards on the table, that sort of thing.”
sincerely worried that just his presence could tip Steve off to the fact that this wasn’t his dream world.
with Steve, to fight against what he’s saying, to prove him wrong. He wants that to not be Steve’s fantasy, he realizes, because he’s terrified of what it means, to think there’s even a chance something like this could happen in the real world.
Which makes Steve realize that, even though they looked nothing alike, even though it didn’t make any
Which leads him to theory number two, one of the simplest: it’s a generational thing. Steve was born in a different time, a time where, if you wanted to have sex with a girl, you had to get ready to marry her and father her children. Therefore, he just doesn’t know how to navigate the many intricacies of modern dating. Of course he wasn’t going to get handsy after a few months – his perception of what a relationship entails is just fundamentally different.
“Yeah, yeah—he’ll show up, okay?” The man bristled, stepping forward and raising one hand in Steve’s direction. “Now, while we’re at it, can you give me this one back?”
“The new design for Rhodey’s HUD? Wasn’t that what you were working on?” Steve asks, and Tony feels a little grateful for a familiar topic. Speaking about work – that’s safe.
“I didn’t know,” Tony hears him saying, and it’s the hesitance in his voice that makes him alert. “Uh. I didn’t know you liked this… sort of thing.”
“I already told you,” Steve grunted. Then, after a second, he added, “You don’t have to sleep on the floor.”
The honesty in Tony’s voice is almost too much. It’s hardly the first time he’s said those things, but every time, his words travel through Steve’s body, curling in his stomach, the pleasure in hearing them in a permanent battle against his instinctive embarrassment for wanting to. He opens his mouth to say something - he doesn’t know what - but he never finds out, because in the next moment Stark’s mouth is over his nipple, covering it with a wet, open-mouthed kiss, his tongue dragging over his sensitive nub as his lips suck like he’s never wanted anything else, and Steve can’t say anything, can barely think anymore.
Jarvis arrives with the wine bottle, freezing and shining with small drops of sweat. Howard swallows at the sight. Just one drink, he thinks. Just one drink and it’ll all be good.
in its usual simple, casual meaning, and the utterly other-worldly, mind blowing, frankly almost terrifying concept of dating Steve Rogers. Dating is easy, but dating
Tony’s eyes darted around, quickly making an inventory of the room. No doors other than the one that had closed when the servants left. And they walked through so many corridors to get here… It was unlikely there was anyone nearby to listen to whatever would happen to them.
“Don’t be jealous,” Stark says. Then he smiles, and Steve can catch a glimpse of that same strange, subtle sadness. “I’ve got problems of my own.”
“…I’ll call you before I leave for dinner,” Steve’s voice whispers, and Tony only vaguely registers it, focused on the warmth of Steve’s breath against his skin. “I love you.”
“I could do this all day,” Steve says, eyes fluttering closed, focusing on the feel of Tony’s body moving close to his. His cheeks hurt from smiling. “You know,” he adds, frowning a little, when the first song from earlier comes up again, the singer boasting about not being in love. “I couldn’t have picked a song more inappropriate if I tried.”
“You. Uh,” Steve stutters, blinking rapidly, as if he’s waking up from a trance. “You should, uh. Take that.”
“I need to talk to you,” he bursts out instead. Steve, sitting on the couch, raises an eyebrow, but nods encouragingly towards the spot next to him.
Perhaps, Howard wonders, she already knew, then, that she would leave. Perhaps she was trying to compensate for leaving way before she gathered the courage to actually do it.
“He might be a little confused,” Bruce says, examining something in his tablet. “Nothing serious, though. His brain seems to have handled it very well.”
Steve presses his lips together in a thin line, and Tony can see that for what it is, an attempt to get his bottom lip to stop shaking. “I’m sorry,” he says, his voice so small.
When they finally got to the entrance hall, right before the stairs, Steve lowered his hood, panting. Stark, next to him, was similarly winded, as well as completely soaked. “Jesus,” he said, leaning forward and placing his hands on his knees. “What
He made a post on Facebook, and, talking to a few people from the shelter, managed to gather together a small search party. However, even after two days, they didn’t find a single sign of the missing Pomeranian.
“I’m surprised you let me in,” Rhodey comments, in that casually annoyed voice he gets when he wants to fight Tony on something, but doesn’t have the energy to do it.
Stark’s eyes were penetrant, even as he made a flippant gesture with his hand. “A friend of mine took over as CEO. I still help with R&D, but I was never fit to be the head of a company in the first place. And even then…” He took a deep breath. “I don’t think you got this correctly, to be honest.”
Okay. Sam is easy. Tony’s always liked the real Sam - he can probably handle a dream version of him.
They both sink onto Steve’s couch. Steve busies himself taking off Tony’s sneakers, a little horrified by how wet his socks are. If Tony weren’t so upset, Steve would use this opportunity to make a point about the importance of function over style when it comes to shoes. He doesn’t, though, rubbing the towel in fast strokes against Tony’s feet to warm them up.
body. He didn’t want him to pay any more attention to it than it was strictly necessary (maybe not even that).
Stark didn’t say anything, and the silence stretched long enough for Steve to feel embarrassed. He parted his lips to speak, but then Stark’s hand hovered over him.
Tony’s jaw clenches. “No, actually, I’ve solved it. Cap is just taking a nap, taking advantage of the opportunity to get some beauty sleep.”
“Right,” Tony interrupted. He was, slowly and with very long breaths, regaining some presence of mind. “We’re very, very sorry. We… got a little carried away.” He winked, laying a hand on Steve’s waist.
“Not really.” Rhodey sighs, and Tony notices for a moment how tired he looks, with a pang of guilt in his chest. He left all that shit in Rhodey’s hands. “Just what his data already told us.” He raises his hand and gestures at Steve casually, voice gaining a rehearsed tone. “Nanotech injected into skin to make the brain project pleasant illusions for an undetermined amount of time. Or, as the internet prefers to call it,” he makes a face as he makes finger quotes. “A ‘dream machine’.”
The movement was so fast Tony almost tripped as Steve seemed to lose his balance for a moment, stumbling a little backwards. Their noses bumped awkwardly, and Tony quickly adjusted his head. The contact with Steve’s mouth was almost shocking, warm in a way that felt disruptive, confusing.
“Yeah,” Tony says. He’d be upset, but, honestly, he’s a little filled with a scientist-like wonder at the thought Steve could genuinely think that. Not only because it’s something he didn’t foresee in any of his theories, but because he has a feeling there’s an insight there he hasn’t grasped yet, but he feels he’s very close to.
Steve clenched his jaw. He didn’t like the idea of Tony looking at his file—ridiculously, he was embarrassed at the thought of Tony reading his long catalog of ailments, enumerated like an exaggeratedly extensive grocery shopping list.
Steve pauses for a moment and then smiles, as if Tony’s suggestion is actually a great idea. “Okay,” he says.
“I did,” Steve says, reverently, running his fingers through Tony’s hair. “And I liked coming over, too. I might not be able to help with story time, but I’m okay with doing other things. The people in the kitchen seemed a little overwhelmed.”
“Uh, right,” Stark said. He didn’t coo over the dog at all when Steve handed him over, which bothered Steve more than it should. “You see, he’s notoriously camera shy, that one.”
Tony rolls his hips forward, a hurricane of kisses and touches growing more urgent, more intense. He scrapes his teeth over Steve’s nipple, then sucks on it, hips keeping up friction against Steve’s needy, leaking cock.
Steve nods. “Okay,” he says, turning towards the door. He can’t help but stop, after a few steps. He draws in a short breath. “Tony?” He turns, and Tony seems surprised. Steve clenches his jaw. This is definitely not proper one night stand behavior, but it feels wrong, to not say it. “Thank you,” he blurts, his face hot, forcing himself to not look away. “I… Uh, you were really… just… Thank you.”
Steve nods, and Tony smiles at his hurry, at his effort to agree very clearly. “I. I want that, too,” he says, voice very small.
Besides, Tony thinks, walking towards the door with large, nervous steps, no one said the fantasy had to make sense. Dreams rarely do. Maybe he’s about to walk outside to Steve being happily married to a young Peggy Carter, even in the future.
Stark exhaled slowly. “Like the fact that up until that point, the only good thing I ever did was changing the direction of the company. Aside from that, I had completely wasted my entire life.” His mouth twisted as if he had swallowed something bitter. “And I think – I mean, I can’t remember everything exactly, but I’m… I’m pretty sure a negotiation took place. Somehow. Wherever I was.”
His voice sounded so small. Tony’s stomach twisted, guilt curling in his belly. What the hell was wrong with him? He should have never brought this up at all. It wasn’t the time or the place, and it had been
As the lights went off, though, he felt a light, soft thing touching his feet. He laughed and squirmed as the ticklish sensation of what were undoubtedly Frodo’s licks climbed up his leg. Then, he felt Frodo’s weight as he climbed up the couch and settled on Steve’s Dummy-free leg.
“You…” Steve started, defensive, when his attention was diverted to something much more important. “Oh, no.” He turned around, frantic. “Where’s the other one?”
“Uh,” Tony said. Of all things Ayesha could talk about, Tony certainly didn’t imagine she’d ask them a question about gender roles. “Well, it’s not really… I mean, that’s. Kind of an outdated concept.”
“If we are indeed the same person, I think I can safely say I know what you have in mind,” Stark drawls, slowly. His eyes are back on Steve, though, as he takes a step closer, stopping in front of him. When he speaks next, it’s almost in a whisper: “And I can hardly say I’m opposed to it.”
he can do to show Steve that he values him for reasons other than his cute, perfect, perky ass. At this point, Tony thinks, the fact that he
“Come on, we need to go home.” Tony stood back up again, trying to see if he could win by force. He pulled on the leash and Steve whined and Tony immediately loosened it because he was a goddamn idiot. “Crap, did that hurt?”
Howard’s hand is a flash in the air between them; a quick but strong sound, not unlike a whip, bounces off the walls. Howard barely feels the moment of contact between his hand and Tony’s face, only seeing it when Tony’s head snaps back.
First of all, it’s too quiet. Usually, by now, the kids are very excited about story time, which means they interrupt the story constantly, asking questions and making weird, random commentary. So, the quietness from the room they’re in, interrupted only by a sole low, monotone sound Tony assumes is his husband’s voice, is an immediate concern.
Tony raises his eyebrows, turning back towards the chair. There’s nothing on Steve’s face or body other than the restraints, no cables connecting him anywhere. “A wireless signal?” He comes closer, thinking a loud. “Of course not, why would it affect only him? But if it isn’t…” he trails off, a bitter taste filling his mouth. He turns towards the panels, watching the data flow, a feeling of bile rising up to his throat. “Nanites,” he says finally.
“It’s a king-sized bed,” Stark added, quickly.  “I’d stay in the opposite corner, you wouldn’t even know I was there. Four people could sleep on it like babies.” Steve widened his eyes, unable to stop himself from wondering if Stark knew that from first-hand experience. “Hell, I’ll build a pillow barrier between us if you want to. Or, or you can take the bed, and I’ll stay on the floor – hardly a first, for me.” He tilted his head, eyes shining with concern even as his voice lightened. “I just don’t think you should stay alone tonight.”
Steve can't think. He can only feel the sparks of pleasure Tony’s fingers send down his chest, the warm, wet feel of Tony’s mouth, now at his jaw. “I--” he tries, but it feels impossible to say what he wants aloud, even though he knows it, deep down. Ridiculously, he’s suddenly embarrassed, as if hearing it in his awkward, strained voice would somehow break the spell, somehow change Tony’s mind. He swallows, though, pushes the discomfort away, determined to answer. “I… just…”
And Tony—see, this is why they should have talked. They should have talked, and they should have done it
What he hadn’t imagined, though, is the gentleness with which Tony’s hands climb up to his wrists, how he lowers them with a smile so tender it melts away the rush, steadying the beat of Steve’s heart. “Let me,” he whispers, fingers coming up to Steve’s collar.
Tony snapped a picture with his phone, because fuck if he was gonna miss an opportunity like that, and then raised an eyebrow at him, moving his leg a bit, and Steve leaned towards the free space on his chair and dropped a tennis ball on Tony’s lap.
“Oh, I just remembered I didn’t ask you last night,” Steve’s voice comes from behind him and Tony does his best to not imagine him in various states of undress. “Did you finish the HUD?”
He can imagine the way Tony’s mouth would feel, pressed against his. Tony’s goatee would scratch his chin, and he’d grin after they broke apart, his eyes very bright, like liquid gold. He’d smell of cologne and a hint of metal, and Steve has the feeling he’d like the metal more. And Tony would hold his waist and pull him closer to the dance floor, annoying and amusing Steve at the same time with his constant fast-paced quips, elegantly guiding their movements as if Steve’s body was an extension of his own.
He wants to stop looking, but he can’t really look away, because it’s not like Steve can catch him staring this time, after all. So he just watches, drinks in every line of Steve’s face. The beard is an addition that seemed jarring at first, but grows more natural every time Tony sees it. It makes him look older, dangerous, like a true criminal on the run. But to Tony it stings a little just because it reminds him of the time they spent apart – it reminds him of dreams of cupping Steve’s smooth face and feeling his silky skin against his, and it reminds him those dreams are long gone, fading in the space between them as the years had passed.
“You know, whenever I imagined you doing that, the scenario was a little different in my head,” Tony said, walking towards the Tower.
Steve smiles, and it’s that same smile from before, easy, overflown with affection and fondness. His hand travels up Tony’s face, fingers tousling his hair, sending shivers all the way from Tony’s neck down to his toes. “I’m guessing someone has been in the lab too long again.”
Steve didn’t know Tony could dance, but now, it seems stupid that it never occurred to him. Of course he can.
“No, Cap. As you know, it’s not very easy to kill me,” Tony said, and to be honest, he didn’t—he didn’t even know what made him say it, really. Maybe it was because he was pissed at the ridiculous situation they were in. Maybe it was because he was tired of dancing around that One Funny Time where they beat the shit out of each other.
“Take better care of him next time,” Steve said, severe. He considered asking what Stark was even doing there in the first place, but at the end of the day, it was none of his business. Maybe Stark was visiting a friend who lived around there, and the supposed following had been just a coincidence. Besides, Steve had more important things to worry about. “What about the other one? I didn’t see pictures of you with him.”
Rogers arrives a few hours later. When Howard enters the throne room to see him, he barely recognizes the man he saw a few nights ago. Rogers’ face is flushed and there’s a barely contained smile on his lips. The man looks downright
“Well, you know me.” Tony sounds breathless, the corners of his lips quirking up as he speaks. “I’m always up for a risk.”
“I,” Steve started saying, then cut himself abruptly, because the notion was too absurd to even say it. He tried again, “I’m… a demigod?”
“I was so sure it was today,” Tony says in a small voice. “Happy even asked me, because of course, I must have told him the date before, but I
“Oh, don’t worry, darling,” Stark says, and something in his voice suggests a familiarity that should have been impossible between the both of them, having just met. Yet Steve has the distinct feeling they’re in sync, as if they both instantly know how they want to play this, and the thought goes straight to his cock. “I will.”
For a moment, Howard wonders if he should knock. He and Tony don’t actually fight very often – they don’t spend nearly enough time together for that. Perhaps he could attempt to reach out, to ask what is he working on...
“No,” Tony breathes, and it’s only then that Steve realizes he sounds exhausted, and looks it too. “No, I mean—I was supposed to have arrived earlier, but I forgot the flowers. And I thought about calling Happy and asking him to take me to the store, but he was already on his break, and I think he’s going to meet May, and—” He stops himself, seemingly realizing his rambling. His eyelashes are dark with water, one or two drips still holding in between a couple of them. “I thought I could just get to the store and pick up the flowers myself. Of course, that was before the world started to fall apart.”
Humiliation burned Tony’s cheeks. He opened his mouth to reply, but Steve interrupted him: “It’s not any of your business when Tony wants to look at me.”
Steve took advantage of the momentary distraction to escape from Tony’s grip, but fuck if Tony was gonna let him off that easy.
“Oh, my God,” Steve says, a strong flush coloring his cheeks. “So, the—the movies… And that time in the kitchen… And all those times you’d—” He stops himself, taking a hand to his face. “Oh, my God. This is fondue all over again.”
Steve thinks of how many times Tony has done that. It’s insane, for him, to think that someone - multiple people - once had Tony’s hands on them and just lived their life afterwards as if nothing happened. Every touch on Steve’s skin feels like a mark he’ll never forget.
Steve stood in silence for a moment, and then the unwillingness of being unfairly rude to Tony won out his conflict. “Okay,” he said.
He feels Tony’s hand on his hair, lowering to stroke his cheek, and he turns his face to press a kiss to it. He knows he must be a mess, flushed and sweaty with his lips still puffy and glistening from Tony’s slick, but apparently Tony doesn’t mind, because his mouth descends on Steve’s in a deep kiss. Steve’s lips part obediently, letting Tony’s tongue coax the kiss slow but through, as if Tony wants to taste himself in every part of Steve’s mouth.
, the proper answer echoed in Steve’s head, just as he actually opened his mouth to say, “No.” He swallowed. “It’s… fine.”
He just can’t dance. He missed the chance to learn from Peggy and then never took the time to learn it from anyone else, and now… it feels like it’s too late.
His blunt tone makes the familiar tingle of anger climb up the back of Howard’s neck. “You wish to marry my son? Tony?”
“Not yet,” Howard replies. He’s a little taken aback; Jarvis rarely asks for explanations. “There are questions I need to ask first.”
In the second picture, though, they are definitely posing. They are in front of a huge statue Tony guesses must be a monument of some sort, though he doesn’t know where. Tony is wearing sunglasses and, this time, his arm is on Steve’s waist. Steve’s beard is more of a scruff, and his face and arms are all red, definitely the result of a light sunburn. He’s smiling, though, his hair incredibly light, falling over his forehead. They both look so touristy and happy it’s almost offensive. Tony is wearing a fucking Captain America T-shirt.
“Did he, uh,” a voice cuts through the silence, and it sounds so hesitant that it’s with quite a shock Howard realizes it’s Tony’s. “Did he say when?”
It’s still not any easier to watch. Steve is restrained on the table, and if he were anyone else, Tony would guess they had arrived too late, just from how pale he looks.
“Okay,” Tony said, even though it was not okay at all. He was worried, and he was nervous, and he was
“He’s quite stubborn,” he says. It’s the first thing he’s said to Howard since the slap. It’s also – Howard frowns as he notices – a rare moment where his voice sounds lower, a far cry from his usual mouthy rhythm. A ghost of a smile even appears on his lips. Howard hadn’t stopped to notice, but it is perhaps the first time he’s smiled since that day, as well.
hurt. It occurred to him maybe Tony had been working very hard on reverting him back to the serum because he knew how awkward it would be to have to break things off between them entirely because Steve now looked like a malnourished fourteen-year-old.
interested in his conversation with Steve – which, to be fair, probably exuded a strong “couple fight” energy. “I never thought you’d forgive me. I thought—I
But Tony just smiles, his eyes with an alluring spark, leaning closer. “Yeah?” He says, grinning as if Steve has said something really daring. “Lead the way, Cap.”
They never really talk about it (of course they don’t), but Tony is aware that it isn’t a serious thing, what they have. It
The flush finally appears in Tony’s cheeks, but it’s not of shame, but anger.“He’s not—” His mouth shuts with an audible click and he stands abruptly. “I should go.” He turns on his heels as quickly as possible, walking in large strides towards the door.
Rhodey wouldn’t say anything, just nodding quietly and changing the subject, because he was a good friend like that.)
message, he never mentioned. Tony imagined he must have chalked it up to their initial hostility, which was a totally fair impression in those first few months, where, if Steve had pigtails, Tony would’ve had a hard time taking his hands off them. Either way, he was just grateful the subject never came up.)
, he couldn’t help but imagine how it would feel to have Stark even closer – to feel the silky touch of his skin, the weight of his arm, the raspy sound of his breath.
Tony’s hand snaps forward to hold his arm, keeping him steady. “What happened? Why did it take you so long?” He asks, frantic, and it occurs to Howard he was clearly waiting to see the result of the meeting. Then, disgust crosses his face. “You’re drunk.”
But this doesn’t apply to Steve. In fact, Tony finds that the more he finds out about Steve, the more he wants to know. Even now – with Steve away, with the mere thought of him hurting Tony’s chest – this is still true. He wants to know – he wants to understand. He wants to… to not understand, either, if that’s what it takes. He wants…
But Tony isn’t exactly looking for answers. Instead, he’s been given one big, overwhelming, impossible answer, and now he’s scraping for questions that might help him make any sense of it.
The worst part about this theory is that, even though there’s no material evidence to support it (and Jarvis is vehemently against it), it has a tendency to spiral so much in Tony’s head it becomes almost credible. Maybe Steve just sees him as a friend. Maybe he wasn’t sure of how to turn Tony down, at first, worrying about what that would do to the team, and now he’s almost stuck in this situation, having to deal with Tony constantly. Maybe the reason he tenses up anytime Tony makes an attempt to lay his arm over his shoulders or to lean a little closer is because he doesn’t want to touch Tony at all, but doesn’t know how to let him down gently. Maybe, maybe, maybe.
After they’re done, he presses kisses all over Steve’s shoulders, caresses his hair, and maneuvers them until Steve’s got his head on his chest.
All of Ross’ men are laying on the floor, some knocked out, others tied up, waiting for the arrival of the CIA agents who are supposed to clean this mess up. And what a mess it is – Ross had apparently taken chasing Steve’s team to the levels of obsession he previously reserved for chasing the Hulk, to the point where Ross was unhappy with even the idea that they could get a pardon through a diplomatic negotiation. He had decided to take matters on his own hands, and Tony can only imagine the paperwork that’s gonna come out of this.
Tony knocked on the room’s door, not wanting to just type his code into the entrance panel and risk catching Steve in a compromising position.
The wedding is the most colorful, cheerful event Steve has been to in years. He’s pretty sure it’s not actually the main ceremony - this one, he’d bet, took place in private, without outside guests. This, Steve guesses, is a party meant more for the public than for the engaged couple – though they seem to be enjoying themselves well enough.
If he’s completely honest, when he takes the elevator up the Avengers tower, the only, sole thing he’s hoping for is to see Tony’s face again.
And Tony is, of course, standing right next to Steve, because they had been tangled together less than a moment ago, when Tony stripped Steve’s shirt off him with precise, determined movements.
That, at least, was true. The pain had varied in intensity since the first hours after the serum was removed, growing and lessening at random intervals, but never truly vanishing.
“Nope. I said it first, I proclaimed it, it is now written: you’re the ridiculous one.” Tony shakes a finger in his direction in mock accusation, then settles his hand back on the table, after a moment. Their fingers are dangerously close. “Seriously, though, what I mean is, we can talk about this stuff. I mean… Really, whenever you want, I’ll be glad to hear it.”
It’s a quick kiss, but—but it’s fucking hard to make it quick, that’s what it is. Steve’s lips are so soft, so plump and smooth that Tony can’t help but imagine how it would be, to open his mouth and capture that lower lip between his teeth. He doesn’t,
Tony clenches his hands into fists. Just like with Steve in the bedroom, he almost wants to argue, to say Barnes he’s wrong, he
Tony lets out a noise, quickly forcing his eyes away from the sight of Steve’s big, warm hand interlaced with his and the thin, discreet gold band, right on Steve's ring finger.
“That’s… that’s great,” Stark said, and it was probably Steve’s imagination, but his voice sounded a little strangled. “I’ll turn the lights off, then, if it’s okay with you, darling. If… if you need anything, please, don’t hesitate to wake me up.”
His heart feels strangled, as if someone is squeezing it so tight it’s a miracle it can still contract enough to keep beating. His next words come out roughly, his voice hoarse: “Love you, too.”
“’Course he does. He damn well should, that punk.” Barnes’s smile grows fonder, and then a spark of suspicion crosses his face. “Why are you asking me this? Trouble in paradise?”
As hosts, the Sovereign had many chambers, Tony noticed. He and Steve walked past endless golden corridors (
It’s as pathetic as it is inevitable. He blinks himself awake and he sees Tony right beside him, body curled up and eyes closed, and the rest of the room might as well just stop existing.
They kiss for a long time before Tony’s finger pushes for his entrance again, and this time it’s easier – it slips inside, a pressure that feels a little strange but not uncomfortable. Tony introduces a second finger, and it burns a little more this time, but then he starts a circular movement, pushing deeper. It’s painful for a moment, but he keeps moving, and then--and
His tone of voice leaves little doubt about what he is asking, and Steve feels his face heat as he immediately denies it. It’s an insane question, of course – these things don’t really
“Wow.” Tony shakes his head in an exaggerated disbelief. “Twenty years of friendship, and that’s the faith you have in my abilities? I mean, I guess I should be glad we’re at least putting it all on the table…”
It’s hard, though. It’s hard to reconcile the Steve who kissed him, the one fluffing his pillows and calling him “sweetheart”, with the Steve he knows and remembers (the Steve who left, the Steve who was never his to stay in the first place).
“Yeah. I guess I. Did. Maybe.” He sounds like an idiot, so he searches for an excuse, desperate to find anything while his brain is too focused on the way Steve’s eyelashes look when he closes his eyes. “I… I need some sleep.”
When they part, Steve turns to look at Stark. His eyes are chilling, the blue pupils darkened as they land on Steve’s lips, no doubt slightly reddened from the kissing. “You seem nervous, darling.”
“I’ll fill them for you later,” he bullshits blatantly, and the sleepy haze isn’t enough to keep Steve from raising a dubious eyebrow at him. “Okay, FRIDAY will.” Steve keeps staring, squinting his eyes in a way that’s desperately cute, which is what pushes Tony to full-blown insanity. “Fine, we’ll fill them together.”
“It’s okay,” he forces out, his voice hoarse. “Really, you—you don’t need to apologize, it’s, it’s fine. This,” and fuck, is it hard to focus, what with the feeling of the floor coming down beneath his feet and the horrifying realization his eyes are starting to burn. “It doesn’t have to be anything you don’t want.”
Captain Rogers doesn’t seem very impressed with it. He walks inside with slow steps, his posture straight. He is a tall, burly man, wearing dark garments that Howard suspects may be the only piece of clothing he has that hasn’t yet been tainted with blood of the king’s soldiers.
Then Steve opened the door and Tony was certain he could not live with that. He just couldn’t. He’d die in those four minutes, because Steve, like the giant asshole he was, had decided to take a morning shower, and he looked refreshed and beautiful, cheeks flushed and hair brushed back. Fuck, even his beard looked like it had been conditioned, which Tony was pretty sure was impossible, since they hadn’t brought any products.
Steve takes a moment to go to the bathroom. After he comes back, though, he finds that most people he could strike up a conversation with are busy. Sam and Bucky are whispering in each other’s ears, and, by now, neither of them even bothers attempting to pretend there isn’t anything there, so Steve knows to just leave them alone to avoid awkwardness. Natasha is talking to two Dora Milage he doesn’t know, Rhodes and Okoye are still dancing, and T’Challa seems unable to even see anyone other than Nakia, as she grins wide and spins in her ceremonial garment.
Then Stark parts his lips, head tilting to fit their mouths together, and the kiss grows deeper, though never losing its slow, steady rhythm.
Steve would be lying if he said his first reaction wasn’t to coo, because, well, they were adorable, both small balls of golden fur. “Hey, there,” he said in a soft voice, and both poms leaned forward, eyes shining. “Where did you both come from?”
Tony would deny it to his final breath, but he’s shaking as he approaches Steve’s body, so unbearably still in that fucking chair, and starts undoing his restraints. “We’ll fucking see about that.”
“You’re heavy,” Tony complained, even though Steve wasn’t, not really. He was just a small, fluffy dog, but Tony felt the need to at least complain a little to stand his ground.
Tony steps forward and takes his hands to Stark’s shirt, unbuttoning with too much hurry to make it seem casual. When he finishes, Stark’s torso is fully exposed, and Steve’s eyes widen; he knows what Tony is going to say before he says it.
“There you go,” Tony says, as the door closes. He turns toward Steve, and just that makes Steve’s heart pound too heavily on his chest, and he thinks he won’t be able to go through with it. Just with Tony looking at him like this, he already can’t breathe.
Perhaps he’s feeling ill, Howard thinks. The thought is not strong enough to be a concern, but it still makes him strangely uncomfortable. He grasps the goblet’s stem before raising it to his lips for another sip.
“Dance with me,” Steve says. His voice isn’t as firm as he’d like, coming out softer than he means to, but he extends his hand.
Rogers complies, though there’s a muscle clenching in his jaw that tells Howard he’d rather not to. “There wasn’t anything sudden about it,” he murmurs before drinking, so low Howard almost doesn’t hear.
“There was an explosion,” he said. His memory of it was fuzzy, twisting and growing distorted under the enveloping, overwhelming memory of the after.
For his part, Steve isn’t doing too bad either. He spends most of the time in an interesting discussion with General Okoye about training routines, taking mental notes of a few tips. Then, Rhodes, seemingly in a moment of bravery, whisks her away for a dance.
“Nope,” Tony replied, popping the last syllable with a deliberate casualness that just looked, well, very deliberate. He twirled on his chair, looking at Steve. “He asked me to do your checkup today.”
He shifts, leaning a little closer. Tony’s cock touches his cheek, wet and hot, but Steve ignores it, tilting his head until he finds Tony’s balls, nuzzling them just the slightest.
Barnes raises his eyebrows, and then he smiles playfully. “Cap?” He asks, but Tony barely registers it. “Someone’s in trouble.”
Then he wants Steve to hold him, as he certainly would. He wants Steve to run those gentle hands over his back, pull him closer, hug him. He wants to let Steve take care of him, to hear him whispering words of love in his ears. He wants to whisper back. He wants this to be it, just like he wanted when they fell asleep in bed, last night. He wants this to be real.
Howard bites back a curse. Not even asking a question can be simple. “By the Gods, Tony,” he growls, genuine frustration slipping in his words. “You can never make anything easier, can you?”
stage, it was hard to notice, because they didn’t sleep together that often. Now, though, they spend most nights altering between which bedroom is closest, and Tony realizes it doesn’t really matter if they’re in Steve’s floor or his penthouse: Steve always wakes up at an ungodly hour. He doesn’t even need an alarm – no, he’ll just naturally be up before the birds, pressing a small kiss to the back of Tony’s neck before rolling off the king-sized or queen-sized bed, depending on which bedroom they were in.
“Hmm,” Stark hums, as Steve’s touch descends to cup the front of his crotch. “I see that you can also –
“Come in,” Tony says, his nerves already acting up. He knows he needs to be more convincing this time, so he lies on the bed and messes up the pillows and covers, as if he’s just woken up from a long nap.
Unlike her previous partners, Tony seems to be actually guiding the dance, instead of struggling to keep up with Natasha’s pace. The music isn’t slow but it’s far from a pop song either, so they have space to be playful, Tony spinning Natasha and then catching her and smoothly dipping her almost to the floor. Their movements are just dramatic enough to be impressive without ever verging on the edge of silliness. Steve is far from the only one watching them now.
He had never seen Steve cry before. It felt – outrageous, wrong. It made Tony want to do absurd things.
“Which one of your doctorates led you to this groundbreaking conclusion?” Tony replies, focused on his latest modification of the nanites. He raises his head, though, even as he keeps working with his hands, modeling outcomes for FRIDAY to calculate.
Steve tilts his head and eyes him over the counter. He hesitates just for a moment before deciding the risk is worth it. “I don’t like alcohol breath,” he says, finally, feeling only a slight flush of his cheeks as does it.
On one of their first nights together, Tony is a hurricane, letting words and confessions slip in between sucking marks on Steve’s skin. He takes Steve as nobody ever did, and Steve feels conscious of every inch of his body, as if it comes alive just by becoming Tony’s.
(Sometimes Tony gets those dreams – dreams of Steve stepping inside the lab. Steve walking straight to Tony and taking him in his arms, his smell a sweet, musky scent flooding Tony’s senses, whispering things in his ears. Sometimes he whispers
Steve feels himself flush, even though he doesn’t really have anything to be embarrassed about, and ends up looking away himself. He feels silly and incredibly awkward, all of a sudden. He wants to loosen his tie, which feels hot and tight around his neck, but that would be inappropriate. His eyes end up darting down, at a forgotten truffle he now remembers he is holding.
It’s all so fast Steve barely has the chance to react. Before he knows it, Tony is back at his side, though not as close as before. He pushes a flute on Steve’s hand. Steve thinks they should probably toast, but Tony is already taking a sip of his – a sip that drowns out nearly half the glass.
When FRIDAY says Rhodey and Bruce are on their way, the panel above them flickers light blue, casting a pale glow over Steve’s face that makes Tony miss his eyes. Decades could go by and Tony is certain those eyes wouldn’t change, that same unwavering, strong blue gaze that could warm him right to his toes and simultaneously make him feel colder than ever.
Steve raised his eyebrows. “Is he yours?” he asked, uncertain. In his arms, the dog only nestled closer, not showing any sign of recognition.
,” he gestured awkwardly at the Pomeranian strapped to his chest, “made us run into you at the park, and now you’re
He turns his head to sneak in one more kiss from Tony before closing his own eyes, and, as he drifts off to sleep, his last thought is for someone who isn’t there:
Steve clenched his jaw, quiet anger emanating from him like waves. “No. This conversation is over,” he turned his glance momentarily to Ayesha’s bodyguards, as if challenging them to say otherwise. “We are leaving.”
“Wh—what the…” Steve started. The dog yapped as if in response, and he did a pirouette. “How is he—How is he doing this?”
His hand lands on Steve’s forearm as he leans closer, eyes going half-lidded. Tony is pretty sure he must be giving him the
His hands were big, Steve noticed. They moved with innate elegance, but there was an undeniable strength to them, and he was reminded of the fact that Stark did some mechanic work at times. Heat curled low in his belly, and he thought,
Again, he doesn’t need to look to know Rhodey rolls his eyes. “You suck at playing dumb, Tones.” He walks towards Tony’s worktable. “Nothing yet, huh?”
“It’s easy for the villagers to have faith, Captain. They don’t have anything to lose.” Howard studies his face carefully, his mind wrapping itself around this development. “And assuming you’re right – you would climb on the throne ready to share it with someone else? With my son?”
For a moment he stood there, in silence, and it was legitimately impressive how quiet Steve got in such little notice. As if he stopped breathing.
“Tony, this…” Steve's eyes dart away for a moment, looking towards the room around them, and Tony hurriedly leans closer, so close he can feel Steve’s hitched, panicked breaths.
“What about the other Ross?” Tony interrupts. He’s tinkering with a gauntlet on his hand, trying to see if he can do anything to send signs to the nanites in Steve’s body.
“Come here,” he says, his voice as soft as it can be. Relief colors Steve’s features, and when he comes closer to sit, Tony can’t help but touch him, coming closer, their legs resting against each other.
as their mouths parted with what surely were some gross smacking noises, and Tony found himself neglecting small details such as the danger they were in or the air they needed to breathe, in order to chase Steve’s mouth again, again, and again.
It’s legitimately like someone turned off the sun. So, really, nobody can blame Tony for saying, “I didn’t know it.”
“Gotta get you out of these pants,” Tony says, opening Steve’s zipper and pulling them down. Steve helps by kicking them off, and Tony’s hands immediately climb to his thighs, squeezing before he gets to his goal, Steve’s boxers, which he strips off incredibly quickly, as if they’re offending him.
Tony feels his body tensing, hyper aware of the proximity between them as if they haven’t spent the night spooning.
Steve stayed silent for a moment, but then he couldn’t help himself anymore: “But I won’t need it, right? I’m—I’m getting back to normal soon.”
Tony just stares. For a moment he’s concerned Steve might be waiting for an explanation for the queen-sized bed, and he’s worried about what to say, when—it hits him.
Tony shifts in his sleep, and god, does Steve love him. He loves him so much it’s embarrassing, loves him so much the thought clenches his stomach, makes his eyes burn.
The realization dawned on him only as Stark turned on the lights, and Steve couldn’t breathe, his gaze unfocused, chest heaving as he tried to calm himself down, to grasp onto reality,
(If Tony’s honest, it still feels a bit unreal, to him. It feels like he’s working backwards. He had imagined he’d been avoiding Steve by now – pretending he wasn’t around, maybe fighting with him over petty things when they had to talk to each other. In a way it feels like he’s been robbed of this, of this… anger. And that stings, really, because it’s almost dangerous, to peel this anger off. What’s underneath scares Tony most of all.)
) talks about the subject. “I mean, there wasn’t Tinder, but people still went out, got naked and bumped uglies. It wasn’t the dark ages—and, for that matter, people were having sex in the dark ages, too.”
He lowers his arm, watching redness begin to bloom on Tony’s cheek. Tony’s face is still turned away, on the position Howard’s slap left it, as if he can’t bear to turn to look at him.
“Uh,” he stammered, wide, brown eyes blinking rapidly. A pair of sunglasses quickly went from hanging at his collar to his face. “No, nothing. Uh. Bless you,” he said, and turned away and walked—no, nearly ran – in the opposite direction, apparently forgetting he was meant to be heading the same way Steve was.
Steve feels strangely comforted. For a moment, he wishes Tony would meet his eyes, but he doesn’t even know what he’d do.
“Tony,” he croaked, a little unsure of what to say. “That’s—that sounds like a lot of work to keep a ninety-pound asthmatic on the field.”
didn’t fly inside the apartment, which Steve appreciated, because the dogs were already freaking out enough without finding one of their own who could defy gravity. They all got used to each other pretty quickly, though, with only Lola choosing to stay away while giving Steve a look of deep, wounded betrayal.
“And so I want you to know this isn’t—this isn’t, like, an ultimatum or anything. I know it may look like it, I had this whole thing planned in my head but I ended up forgetting it, but I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I’m… I’m really happy with what we have, right now.”
That’s… a little surprising, if Tony’s honest. As much as he had joked about it to Rhodey, a part of him
Steve can’t help but smile. Having finished opening Tony’s shirt, he raises his hand to Tony’s face, gently cupping his cheek: “There are lots of lines in New York,” he says, even though he knows for a fact that if Tony had ever used the subway more than, maybe, once in his life, he wouldn’t find it hard. He keeps this knowledge out of his tone, though; the difference in their upbring is always jarring when it rears its head like this, and he knows it makes Tony feel uncomfortable and guilty, even though it’s not really his fault. “It can be complicated.”
“I’m afraid not yet, Captain,” he says, taking a bite of his beef. It’s juicy and succulent, a fine distraction from the bottle that he can’t bring himself to ignore. “I want to ask you a few questions.”
“Feels good, huh?” Tony whispered, sounding amused, and Steve almost instinctively attempted to straighten his back. “Hey, relax. It’s supposed to feel good, you know.”
Rhodey’s face grows sympathetic, and he gives Tony’s shoulder a gentle squeeze. “Look, I get it. This whole thing is new to you, and you don’t want to risk it. But you need to be honest with him, Tony. This is bothering you. You’re craving that cheesy shit.”
“Nope. You don’t.” Tony’s hands take no prisoners, climbing back up to Steve’s hair, fingers going through fine, blond locks in a firm, steady caress that earns him another sigh.
Tony frowns. He honestly frowns, because if there’s one thing he knows for sure about his and Steve’s relationship, is that they
“I’m running models on how he’d react if we use your nanites,” Bruce says. His voice sounds worried. “And I don’t think his brain is going to take it if we turn them all off at once.”
Steve’s bottom lip shakes, his eyes glimmer and Tony feels as if he's intruding, for seeing that. It’s such raw, bare pain, it doesn’t
“Here.” Stark set up a pillow at one end of the couch, unraveling a blanket right over it. “Do you need anything else? A glass of water, maybe?”
In a separate cabinet, there are all his suits, and then, at the end of the closet, there’s a specific one in a garment bag.
There was an unbearably long silence, before Tony’s voice betrayed him. “I know,” he said, faint but certain. “I… I do know that.”
If somebody asked Tony what would happen the next time he and Steve saw each other, he’d say they would fight.
“I’m fine,” he said then, because he was. “Can I go now?” He hated sitting there in the lab, feeling exposed and pitiful. He was tired and frustrated and he wanted to go for a run or punch a sandbag, and he couldn’t do either of those things.
He decides not to watch for Tony’s reaction, standing up and walking quickly to his bedroom. He picks up a sweater from his closet – it’s a little loose on him, so it should fit Tony just fine – and a pair of sweatpants that, come to think of it, are probably Tony’s anyway. On his way back, he also comes by the bathroom, picking up a comb.
“Lord Stark,” he says, and Howard gives him a nod and motions for him to stand up again. He complies a little too fast. “Thank you for meeting me tonight.”
After reversing the Snap, a distance had taken place between them, coloring their every interaction. Even if he claimed to not hate him anymore, Tony wouldn’t touch him in the same casual way he touched everyone else – he couldn’t even stand too close to Steve without shifting, placing his hands in his pockets and looking uncomfortable in a way Tony Stark never did. For a while, Steve had the feeling Tony didn’t even want to look at him anymore, always avoiding his eyes when they spoke.
Steve can’t stop staring. They’re close enough to give a wonderful shot to a paparazzi lucky enough to stumble on the scene, but it’s clear from their faces they’re having fun, whispering things to each other and grinning between steps.
“My specialties.” Tony gives him a thumbs up, then turns towards Rhodey again. “Watch over us, buddy.”
He trails off, staring at Steve expectantly, and Steve feels dizzy by that gaze, shifting in the same spot. “Me?” He echoes, confused. He thinks of the grace of Tony’s movements guiding Natasha across the dance floor, of how easy he made it seem. The heat in his cheeks sinks to his neck, his stomach mimicking its movement with dread. Steve forces an awkward chuckle. “No, I don’t think so.”
Steve is still next to him, though not spooning him exactly. He still has one arm over Tony, in a clumsy, but so casual gesture of intimacy that it makes it hard for Tony to think of what he will do now, what is his next step.
Steve’s eyes are wide meeting his, and Tony feels like he’s gonna die in the moment of silence that follows, when Steve doesn’t say anything.
was definitely a word their people didn’t know), following Ayesha, who, to be fair, did walk fast when there was already a red carpet in front of her. Small blessings.
Tony opened his mouth to reply, but he was interrupted by the sound of Steve pushing back his chair and jumping to his feet.
, in fact, seemed to be inside – that is, aside from one very small, very significant machine irradiating a green glow, that turned its rays towards Steve the second he saw it.
Howard takes comfort in the fact that Rogers seems to be as displeased by having to perform this ass kissing as he is by receiving it. He nods, encouraging.
When Tony speaks, his voice is much softer: “I like spending time with you. Even if it’s, uh. To do nothing.” He shuts his mouth and swallows. “Sometimes that’s. That’s all I want.”
Then, he felt a light pressure on his ankle – the tinier Pomeranian had decided to take a direct approach on his apparent mission to get to Steve’s lap.
Tony laughs, his smile bright, eyes crinkling. The collar of his crisp, white shirt contrasts with his tanned skin. He is the most beautiful person Steve’s ever seen, period.
Steve takes a moment to answer, so Tony was right, he was probably getting ready to sleep. “Sure.” He gives a light squeeze around Tony’s waist, and his beard scratches the back of Tony’s neck, not helping the whole shivers situation at all. “What is it?”
“Okay.” Tony nods and shifts closer, body curling up against Steve’s, feeling the warmth of his large frame. “I guess we’re, uh, in agreement, then.”
Tony lets out a sigh that he seems to have been holding down for hundreds of years. “I forgot the flowers,” he says.
Howard laughs. He can’t help it – it’s an honest, full-blown laugh, the type he can’t remember the last time he gave. “Love? You come inside my castle to jest with me, Captain?”
Rogers smiles. “I agree.” He reaches forward and takes his own goblet, filled with wine, and takes to his lips in a modest sip. Howard vaguely thinks he’s only doing it out of politeness. “Have you reached a decision about my request?”
She used to laugh when Howard carried her to bed, way before Tony even dreamed of being born, and in bed she was all raspy whispers and sighs, muffled moans and words stretched out by her slurry voice. She’d whisper of love, then, and Howard, a man who had never believed in such a thing without the influence of alcohol, often whispered back.
“Right.” Howard nods, slowly, as he feels the pleasant burn of the liquid down his throat. “You must also know that my son has no manners. He holds very little regard for the rules of royal etiquette.”
For some reason, that made Steve’s cheeks warm a little. He hurried to change the subject. “Uh, you mentioned something like – guiding people. What does that mean?”
“Leave me alone,” Steve said coldly. From the little he knew about Stark’s public persona, he guessed this was probably a schtick of his. Maybe his fans liked it, but Steve didn’t have to entertain him any longer.
When he arrives to the gym, he feels his stomach churning a little in expectation. In a way, this is the first time he’s seeing Steve in two years.
“Good idea,” Tony says, and Steve’s hands lower to Tony’s wrists, which is good, because Tony’s hands should be under the control of someone else right now, stopping him from writing
“No reporters here to see your act, punk.” Bucky bites a piece of pizza he’s holding. His eyes quickly wander off Steve, finding Sam across the dance floor, and a flush colors his cheeks.
discuss strategies. The morning and afternoon were incredibly busy, full of different meetings and presentations, so Tony and Steve didn’t have to do more than stand next to each other, smile a lot, and hold hands on occasion.
Steve is taking everything at such a glacial – ha, ha, ha, get it? Ice? Okay, fine, maybe the sexual frustration is getting to him a little - pace. He just can’t bring himself to ask.
“Here.” T’Challa pointed to a crate in the far end of the hallway. He didn’t have to, though – the dog’s loud whining spoke for itself, rising above any of the other regular sounds coming from the rows of cages.
had promised not to make things inappropriate, and, who would have known, he wasn’t the one who did. Steve shut his eyes and drew in a sharp breath, well aware of his humiliation, already waiting for Stark to turn on the lights. Maybe he’d laugh at Steve, or maybe pity would be written all over his face—Steve wasn’t sure of what would be worse. “’s cold,” he said, too surly for someone in his position, as if this was all Stark’s fault.
As the clothes keep coming off, Steve, a little embarrassed, has to admit he’s risking hurting his neck by how fast he keeps turning from one Tony to the other, not wanting to miss a single movement, so he decides to go sit on the bed, where he can watch them both.
A loud, high-pitched noise made him jolt, and Stark scowled at something behind his shoulder. “Stop that, for God’s sake,” he chastised, and he actually sounded
chimes in, and now Tony hates him with a passion. “You instructed me to stop you in case you ever tried to ignore Miss Pott’s calls again.”
The thought hurts like sharp glass inside Steve’s lungs, but it feels wrong to complain, when just the prospect of them being in the same room together once seemed impossible. In light of all they went through, Tony just standing next to him at their friends’ wedding, talking about truffles, seems like a miracle.
Howard draws in a deep breath. It’s been years, since the last time Tony drove him to do something like this.
Lola, who had been chewing on a once-squeaky toy, tilted her head at him, not buying it. Only a few months away from her eighth birthday, she seemed to be growing rather judgmental with age.
“Here,” he says, stretching the sweater’s head hole to beckon Tony to come closer. He does, and Steve pulls the sweater over his body, enjoying the feel of the wool over Tony’s solid, lean shape. “Take your pants off.”
Steve wants to cry. He wants to scream, to fall to his knees. He wants to find out how it feels to hug Tony, to hold him in his arms when there is still life in his body.
So he left, almost running to the gate. He wasn’t sure if he would find the missing dog, but damn if he wasn’t going to try.
Steve can’t speak, so he just nods, and Tony does just that. He curls around Steve’s body and holds him as if he’ll never let him go.
“You made that very clear.” Steve’s voice is light, and Tony feels his lips pressing a kiss against the back of his neck, a wave of shivers following the tiny touch. “Still. I don’t think it could ever have been different.” His hands travel up and down, in steady, comforting lines over Tony’s chest and stomach. “I can’t imagine not falling in love with you.”
“Gotta say,” Tony commented as he placed his hands on the area under Steve’s shoulder blades. “I thought you wouldn’t let me do this. Almost asked Bruce to offer it instead.”
“Yeah. I… I mean, I think it’s great, of course.” Tony smiles, because, well, duh. Steve smiles back, but his is a little more subdued. “It’s just… still very different, I guess.” His hand goes to the back of his neck. The look on his face – Tony already knows what it means. It’s Steve's face when he reminiscing. “Back then, you didn’t talk about it. You tried to not let it show, because if you did, you’d be in trouble.”
“Yeah,” he muttered, and, although he kept his eyes closed, in his mind he could see Stark’s smile. It oddly made him want to smile back, and his mouth curled a little against his common sense.
He hears the door opening as Steve leaves the bathroom, and the sweet smell of shampoo and soap floods the room. Tony inhales deeply and tries to forget that Steve must be changing right next to the bed.
“It happened a week ago, sir. I believe you were quite sleep deprived, but it was still a very clear command.”
This logic turns to dust a second later, when Tony starts kissing back, and everything Steve has that even remotely resembles a rational thought vanishes at the scorching heat of his mouth, at the feel of his scruff burning his lips, at the way Tony’s hands descend to his waist and pull him closer. Tony’s body is firm and lean against his and suddenly every layer of clothing Steve is wearing feels like an inconvenience.
He runs into Tony hours later, when he’s walking back to his room. He meets him in the hallway and they almost bump into each other, Howard losing balance at the startle.
(The memory has him, out of control, and Steve suddenly feels the weight of a small, triangular shape; pressed onto his hand with anger and bitterness. He can’t speak, blinking too fast, his eyes burning. He lacks the voice to ask:
unbelievable, some would say,” her voice cut through his thoughts, sharp and gaining steam at every word. Tony’s head snapped back at her, and he noticed her two assistants with their backs straight but eyes focused, as if they were ready to jump into action at any moment. “In fact, once I heard it, I couldn’t help but wonder how could two people with such a turbulent history end up together.”
“I suppose so, yes,” the man says, and Steve believes him. He’s tall – Steve’s height, easily –, broad-shouldered, and he has light, piercing blue eyes instead of those brown orbs Steve loves so much, but he is, definitely,
So Tony is back at number two. And, see, this one – it makes Tony’s heart ache, sometimes, because he so wishes he could take matters in his own hands, here. He wishes he could grab the lapels of Steve’s old, grandpa shirts and kiss the life out of him, regardless of who saw it, to show Steve it was okay, he can have this now. He so, so can.
He smiled as he closed his eyes. For all the shock Tony’s revelations had caused, now he felt strangely certain of the rightness of it all. Tony was meant to be here, Steve thought, they were meant to work together, and now, ready to drift off to nice, sunny dreams, Steve couldn’t help but believe everything would work out perfectly.
“I think our lives are gonna be a lot easier,” Steve pulls Tony closer, feeling his chest against his. “If from now on you just assume the answer to this question is always ‘yes’.”
“’Course they would,” Tony replied – immediately, so certain, as if the possibility of the contrary didn’t even occur to him.
“You… Excuse me,” Howard forces himself to say, a hint of annoyance slipping under his bewilderment. He feels as if he’s being mocked somehow. “Ask me for what?”
“Don’t worry about it,” Steve said. His head was still spinning, but now, staring at Stark and vaguely conscious that Dummy had started roaming across the room in what appeared to be a victory lap, he couldn’t help but smile. “Are you two hungry?”
“This isn’t a hallway conversation,” Stark said, stepping forward and taking the Pomeranian on his arms. The dog – Steve couldn’t see it as anything but – wriggled a little in protest. “Oh, come on, you’ll have time to cozy up to him later.” Stark turned to Steve, his expression a little hesitant. “Can we continue this in your apartment? Because let me tell you, some alcohol would not be a bad idea.”
But at least it seemed like the Sovereign were buying their farce. They even invited them to a special, private dinner the next day, after the daily meetings were over. Tony thought it was a good sign, even if it meant they’d have to fake for a little longer than usual.
“Hey,” he says, trying to pull Tony slightly, to get him to turn around. Tony resists, both because he’s a coward who can’t handle looking at Steve right now, and because he feels like a coward for asking this in the first place. In a way, it feels invasive, like he’s poking inside Steve’s mind as he’d poke an engine, trying to find out some part that would make everything around them make sense.
a date either—Steve had said he was hungry, and Tony had asked if he wanted to get dinner, but then Steve said “sure, there’s pasta in the fridge”, and they had ended up eating in the living room, plates full of large portions of heated up pasta from lunch (which, against all odds, tasted really good).
Once he finishes updating himself, Tony starts thinking strategies. The slight glitch when Steve felt his discomfort was dangerous, and Tony can’t let that happen again. He has no idea how Steve’s brain would react to Steve breaking out of the simulation without the nanites being turned off – would a different fantasy immediately replace the failed one? Or would he just be stuck in a blank coma, maybe indefinitely? Whatever it is, Tony doesn’t want to find out.
“Now, I don’t think you should get the fun started without us, baby,” Tony says, and in a moment he’s by the bed, landing one knee on the space between Steve’s spread legs and taking his mouth in a deep kiss. His lips are hot, still flushed from the contact with Stark’s mouth, and the awareness of that fact sends a wave of arousal down Steve’s body, making him moan into the kiss.
And, sure enough, there was Stark, standing across the hallway, tilting his head towards Steve as if he was actually worried.
Stve barely manages to focus enough to start sucking, however, because in the next second Stark’s finger is entering him, and it’s barely stretching him, not nearly
– you can also, oh, be quite the menace,” he stutters as Steve’s hand goes up and down, palming Stark’s cock over the fabric.
He came to their room early, to meet Steve for breakfast. His play, he had decided, would be a very effective one, a true classic: he’d act like nothing had happened.
“Hey,” he says, pulling Steve’s waist closer, getting the earlier kiss back with a peck on Steve’s lips.
There’s a long stretch of silence before Tony replies, his voice small: “I don’t want to rule anything.”
-ing at the right moments, and in no time Steve is grinning again, glad to be explaining something to someone else for a change, feeling in the loop.
When Tony comes, Steve looks up, and sure enough, he is a vision, so beautiful Steve can barely believe. Steve swallows his spunk, greedily sucking on his now softened cock; he can’t help it. Tony pulls back, and Steve’s mouth releases him with a light popping sound.
It’s just that looking at him brings back the image of the most painful things Tony’s ever felt. Things like the images of the hand who strangled his mother or Steve Rogers turning his back to him.)
display of all the qualities Tony could never have. That, combined with resentment from his dad’s stories and Steve’s own poor first impression of him, had resulted in absolute disaster, but now being around Steve is far from a hardship. And it’s not just something Tony wants, either. It’s good for him. It makes him want to be better. Sometimes – when Steve gives him that small smile and looks at him with those bright eyes shining with something that makes Tony feel like floating – it makes him feel like he
, and he looks up and notices the way Steve is looking at him. It’s an even bigger shock when their mouths crash together, Tony’s body roaring to life in a manner he frankly hadn’t imagined would happen with Mr. Capsicle, of all people.
Tony hums, clearly already beginning to doze off, and Steve nestles closer, his head over Tony’s chest. He’s overwhelmed by that same warm, gooey feeling, and his body feels like goo, too, melting against Tony’s.
It was a pretty standard op, just some regular ass-kicking in Midtown. Today’s lunatic did manage to get a hostage, but Tony and Thor had handled it very well while Steve, Natasha, Clint and Hulk took care of his minions. In the end, nobody got wounded. The guy’s boyfriend hugged Tony, in armor and all, when he bought the man back safely.
Steve took a deep breath, closing his eyes, and considered his question. His body was, against all odds, actually relaxing against the bed, and he could feel his eyelids getting a little heavier, the exhaustion of a terrible night finally hitting him.
“Oh, don’t be fake,” Stark chastised, but he was smiling, seeming a little pained. “Anyway. Once I started taking control of things, I realized I wasn’t fully informed of what was really going on under the tables of the company. You see, I was technically the one who ran it on paper, but in reality, I mostly contributed with the projects. Whatever else was happening didn’t matter, because… Well, frankly, because most of the time I was too drunk to care.” He looked at Steve directly, and though his speech never changed, his eyes suggested every word was taking great effort. “So I found out the company was double-dealing – actually, scratch that—the guy I
Steve held him close, watching as he nestled to his chest, his dark eyes blinking slowly as his body relaxed. He looked so sweet and comfy that, though he knew that wouldn’t usually be advisable, Steve leaned forward and pressed a kiss to the puppy’s small forehead.
And that—well, to say it caught Tony off guard would be an understatement. He had just stared at Steve for a moment in silence when Jarvis helpfully jumped in to inform him of the reservation's time. Steve had smiled, and Tony had gaped at him like a fish, and, just like that, he had a date with Steve Rogers.
Stark opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, Steve saw the tiny Pomeranian strapped to his chest, in a papoose.
actually interesting. There was a lot of history and culture they couldn’t even imagine. Steve, Tony noticed, was often captured by the information presented to him, leaning forward with a small frown that was ever-so-slightly different from his frown of disappointment. He’d nod along with some of the presentations and even tilt his head a little when he heard something particularly intriguing, in a rather cute way.
“Hello to you too, Cap.” He raises the glass he’s holding in a toasting motion. Steve notices the emptiness, clenching his jaw. “Oh, relax.” Tony waves him off. “It’s only my second one.”
The door opens, interrupting Quill’s chatter, and Rocket’s head shows up to say there’s a problem with the sound system.
Tony swallows, as if he’s recovering, then smiles – his smile is large and apologetic, but so damn gorgeous, Steve can’t even find the words for it. “Sorry,” he says. His hand goes to his own tie, loosening it and pulling it off his collar. He shakes his head, looking at Steve full of wonder. “It’s just… I think you’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen naked.”
“I always did like cherries,” he muses, and Steve tries to roll his eyes, but he’s stopped by the light touch of Stark’s thumb against his areola as he draws a tiny, nearly
Steve’s eyes are drawn to Tony’s cock. The sight – long, flushed, so, so beautiful – makes Steve’s body react almost involuntarily – he pushes back again, remembering the feel of Tony inside of him, stretching him out, and he
Steve frowns. His face is still so close, Tony can see perfectly the little wrinkle it forms between his eyebrows. “Something wrong?” He asks, sounding genuinely confused, and Tony’s mind, like a whirlwind, tries to grab onto concrete details to form an answer, but he’s stuck looking at Steve’s face. He can still feel Steve’s breath on his mouth, and his face tingles at the contact with Steve’s beard, and Steve has a light freckle right under his eyebrow, and it’s so light and small it tugs Tony’s heartstrings and he finds it hard to breathe.
He took frantic steps, and it was a miracle he didn’t knock his toe on anything as he walked around the couch. Steve had his face turned towards the cushion, and Tony could see his back, see how he was shaking. His sobs were being muffled by the cushion, and he had no idea Tony was there, awake.
“You know.” Steve shrugs, but he doesn’t sound casual at all. “Just… being together. I.” He swallows, his eyes snapping to the ceiling. “I thought, I dunno, that you’d find it a little cheesy.”
Tony presses his lips together in a thin line. His eyes must spell out the anxiety spiral in his head, because Rhodey’s face turns more determined.
Steve presses a light kiss against his shoulder. “I like taking care of you,” he says, both too casual and too honest.
Steve almost jumps when a few notes of music start playing. It’s not loud, just enough to fill in the background sounds. When he calms down, it’s pleasant, though, and he feels his nerves easing a little as Tony comes closer.
safe, like this Steve is deeply familiar with this happiness, like he knows it’s his and it won’t ever go away.
For a moment, Tony didn’t say anything. Steve’s face burned, heat concentrating dangerously in his vision. He blinked rapidly to avoid any further humiliation.
Howard blinks. For an insane moment, he thinks Rogers is joking, but the man would have to be a complete lunatic to make a joke such as this.
Steve shot the food a worried glance, and Tony didn’t need to read minds to know he was thinking they shouldn’t eat it. His gaze found Tony’s, and they had a silent battle over it – surely Ayesha wasn’t going to
. It’s just… so ridiculous, so juvenile. It’s absurd. It should be hilarious, but instead, Howard finds himself growing angry.
Steve’s next breath is sharp, and it reminds him that the only thing he wants to breathe right now is Tony’s cologne. “I…” He can’t even bring himself to feel embarrassed for being so obvious - the only thing he can think, right now, is that if there’s even the slightest chance Tony might want him, he needs to take it. “I have a room at… Thor, he got me a…” He's frustrated with himself, his face burning, for not being able to say it in the same smooth way Tony would.
“I thought you wouldn’t be in the city”, Steve agrees slowly, trying to find some common ground. Tony nods emphatically.
“I called Quill,” Steve said, his expression a good indicator of how that conversation went. “He said ‘oh yeah, she has a thing for blonds.’”
Steve’s heart hammers in his ribcage as response, just the proximity of them already making his blood rush, and Tony can definitely tell, because his hand reaches for Steve’s chin, pulling him into a firm, reassuring kiss. Steve can’t help but sigh at the contact of his mouth, lips parting as if on cue as he feels the delicious, familiar touch of Tony’s lips and tongue.
“Well,” Ayesha said, with a gesture towards the food. There were two large trays in front of them, one carrying a very colorful salad of fruits and vegetables Tony didn’t recognize and one carrying something that resembled a very large casserole. “What are we waiting for?”
“Come on, that’s not true,” Tony replies, a grin on his lips. He leans his head forward, and that’s a talent Tony Stark has, making the impossible seem very easy. “I could—”
Tony leans in. “It must be shocking,” he says, studying Steve’s expression. “Seeing it all at once, and with so many people on your back, too, trying to get interviews, get you to speak at Pride…”
In his absence, an incredibly uncomfortable silence grows. Steve feels heat prickling his neck, and he can’t help but risk a glance at Tony, who’s staring straight at him. His eyes find Steve’s, bright and challenging.
Sam arrives a moment later. Sam - wonderful, kind Sam – sees him and smiles, understand his choice without Steve needing to explain it.
. Stark chuckles, rubbing his erection up and down the crack of Steve’s cheeks. Tony grins against Steve’s jawline, and lowers his hand to remove his own boxers, hurriedly shifting to kick them away.
He loosens Steve’s tie slowly, then runs his fingers over the blue silk, removing it from Steve’s neck and setting it aside carefully. Then his hands descend down Steve’s chest, finding the lapels of his jacket, pushing it off him. Tony’s hands follow the jacket’s path down his arms. Every moment is slow, but not hesitant – it’s deliberate, like the kiss, as if every second of it matters just as much as what they’re about to do.
After hours walking around his neighborhood, Steve was feeling a little defeated. He also didn’t find anyone looking for the puppy, online or otherwise, which proved to him that, unfortunately, the dog probably
Tony takes a sharp breath, focusing on his own hands. Not looking at Steve makes it slightly easier. “It’s just… Don’t get me wrong, I’m okay with taking things slow. Totally okay. But I just, I was wondering a little about… exactly how slow you want to take this.” He pauses, for a second, but the silence terrifies him, so maybe he should just keep talking. “Like, the other day in the kitchen – you just… froze, and, shit, wait, I didn’t mean—that wasn’t a joke or anything, I swear. Uh, anyway, the point is, I guess it would help if you gave me some pointers. About… about what you’re not comfortable with, or anything.”
want to be good for him, too. When they first met, part of Tony recoiled, using quips and snarky cynicism as armor against that sincere, goddamn
(Tony knows, because if Steve had ever looked at him like that, Tony would have probably deserted all his responsibilities and beliefs and joined the Rogues on the run. He probably would’ve ignored the U.N. and the government and
This wasn’t Steve flustered or nervous because his acting sucked. This was Steve’s tension in Cap mode – Steve’s tension when he felt there was danger in the air.
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Obadiah says, as if he’s talking to a child. “It’s dangerous for the Captain to veer into the city. We have negotiated through a messenger. He has never been here before.”
So Tony can understand why Steve could be feeling a little hesitant about diving into a relationship with another man. Steve is already having to adjust to so much, being in a different century – it makes sense, then, that having to adjust to actually being able to live his sexuality in practical terms would be something he’d delegate to a second plan.
Tony resisted for about thirty seconds before he sighed, cursed his life, walked towards his former nemesis turned somewhat friend turned secret crush, now in dog form, and picked him up in his arms.
, he spreads his ass cheeks and presses his erection between them, his hard length pressing over the fabric of Steve’s underwear.
He half-expects Tony to snap back, but instead he just keeps wrapping the thread around his index finger and pulling so more of it comes out. When he speaks, his voice is distant, as if he’s speaking from miles away.
“Take this off,” Steve demands, retreating just enough to touch Stark’s crotch again. Stark barely mumbles a reply and Steve’s already feeling him moving on the bed as he pulls his underwear off.
The first one is that Steve is worried about Tony’s history. Which, okay, fair – the long line of women (and men) who woke up in Tony’s bed only to be greeted by a robotic disembodied voice telling them a car was waiting outside argues against him, Tony knows. Yes, nowadays, it stings a little that Steve would think he’d do something like that to him, but, honestly, in 2008, he might just have. So he can’t fault Steve for wanting to take his time, for making sure Tony is serious about this before jumping straight in.
Before him, slumped on the ground, lying there with its four paws spread out comfortably on the asphalt, was an adorable, blue-eyed Corgi.
“One sec,” came a voice inside, hoarse in a way that sent embarrassingly tingly shivers down Tony’s spine.
“Oh,” he says, as if he’s just realized their presence. His flush deepens, Tony notices. Steve has kind of an ugly flush, that shows up in red spots coming up from his neck as well, instead of sticking prettily to his cheeks. Tony sticks his hands in his pockets to control his itch to touch it. “Hi.”
A soft meowing sound announced Stark’s cat’s presence. Steve felt as it climbed next to him, curling in a warm ball next to his thighs.
Natasha had said. He turns towards her. She’s typing commands on Ross’ computers, no doubt trying to get all the data she can find.
Tony spends a while drawing armor schematics in the sand for the mini Bartons, until they get tired and decide to go ask “Aunt Nat” for piggyback rides.
“I know,” he tells Barnes, because of course he does. He knows how Steve is – has literally seen inside his head now – and he knows how much they can hurt each other, and he knows he wants Steve with every fiber of his being, so much it pains him to think about it, and somehow, being wanted back doesn’t make it any easier.
“He says he wants to know what you’ve decided, sir,” Jarvis says, twisting his hands. “He says… He says ‘go away’ is not an answer.” He pauses for a moment, then adds: “He says he will continue to come until you answer him.”
The restaurant worked, too. It was a discreet bistro not too far away from the Tower. The food tasted delicious, and Steve cleaned up his plate with such voracity that Tony simply had to convince him to order dessert. Steve complained a little, saying it wasn’t fair to let Tony pay for everything, but Tony won the argument, promising he’d let Steve pay next time (Steve didn’t even blink at the suggestion that there would
“Mmm,” Steve hums, which makes Tony raise his head, because usually he’s the non-verbal one during mornings.
It doesn’t take much work with the comb to fix the mess Steve made with the towels. Still, Tony hums as Steve continues, small, pleased noises seemingly coming from the back of his throat, each one filling Steve with nearly unbearable fondness.
After Steve finds out Dog Rates, it doesn’t take him long to find Thoughts of Dog, which he finds even more delightful. He shows it to Tony during breakfast, sitting next to him on the counter as they go through the tweets together.
“Not late at all,” he whispers back, grinning and leaning in again to taste Steve’s smile. “You’re just in time,” he says before their lips touch, feeling giddy. Because, really, when he thinks about it, now he gets to start dating Steve twice.
Fortunately, the crying was unwarranted. From what Steve could tell, Lola had probably slipped while running through the leaves on the ground, as she had already done multiple times before. She was now huffing happily, her paws spread as she lay on her belly, and Steve had the keen feeling she was basking in being the target of his attention. For such a cute, peaceful, old dog, Lola sure could be manipulative when she wanted to.
Speaking of kids, Clint’s catch up to them immediately, surrounding Tony with excited voices and even more excited questions.
“Stop,” Tony whispered, and he knew his breath must have tingled Steve’s (soft, so, so soft) lips, from the way he felt Steve’s body shivering. “Just. Stop saying words.” their noses brushed again as he spoke, and Tony found he didn’t mind, not even a little. Steve had a great nose. “Don’t say anything ever again.”
“Well,” Ayesha’s voice sounded hesitant, but calmer than before. She raised her tone, clearly addressing Steve and Tony, but Tony didn’t bother looking, focused on trying to get Steve to turn towards him. “It seems to me the two of you are clearly delusional, but you do seem sincere enough. So I thank you, in the name of my people, for sharing your honest stupidity with us.”
“Yeah, I got that.” Tony circled him, not letting his eyes off Steve’s body. Steve tightened the cross of his arms. “Bruce’s data didn’t mention anything about it bothering you, but I guess it should have been obvious. It just slipped by us.”
He stands up. After assessing the nanites’ genuinely impressive capacities of fooling his brain, his mind gets consumed with curiosity over Steve’s fantasy. It’s still the 21
It takes barely a few strokes of Stark’s hand for Steve to come. His body quivers and trembles, his vision momentarily washed over in white light. He feels as if he climbs and explodes, floating down afterwards in a light, slow motion, as if carried by the wind.
Steve vaguely acknowledges the bed shifting for a moment as Stark leans to open the drawer and grab the lube. “Oh, I bet he isn’t. But this isn’t just about him.” Stark’s hands find the back of Steve’s thighs, caressing his muscles in an upwards motion. “You said he’s pretty everywhere. I intend to see to that
Then Tony pulls away and takes a deep breath, resting his forehead on Steve’s shoulder. “Jesus. Look at me—said I was going to do what you want and then practically hump you like a horndog.” He props himself up by his arms. “Give me one second.”
“I just wanted to make sure you weren’t getting any wrong thoughts.” Steve sounds a little hesitant too, as if he’s also feeling the tension. “You’ve never said anything like that before, and the last thing I want is for you to doubt us.” His voice grows firmer as his words come out, as Tony’s chest grows tighter. “We can talk about this, if you want. We can talk about anything.”
So he had run his mouth. Of course he had. He shouldn’t have said anything, should’ve just apologized and went back to bed, but Steve was
But now, that’s clearly not the case. Whatever world Steve dreamed up, it apparently has a place for Tony.
Steve is right outside the bathroom door. His hair is longer, his beard is still there, but there’s something about
“Hmf,” Tony says, slightly muffled by the pillow. He isn’t capable of stringing together anything more coherent, so he can only hope Steve catches the crystal-clear disapproval in his grunt.
“You know. The—the people-thing. The you-thing. Love. Call it however you want.” He shrugs, his voice going faster at every word. “The point is—I’m not good at it, at all. But trust me, I’ve been worse. And, lately, after everything that happened, I guess I… I thought I was getting kind of good at it? I mean, I thought I had at least gotten a grip on how it should go, and I was trying to… To make it easier, I guess. To… to do it right.”
Hot anger boils in Howard’s stomach. “You might enjoy mixing up with all sorts of people, Tony,” he spits, his voice dripping with disdain, leaving no doubt as to what class of mixing he’s referring to. “But I’m a busy man, and I can’t bring myself to learn the names of every poor bastard who makes sure the horses don’t eat themselves to death.”
“Okay, that’s enough,” a voice said, and Steve looked up to find the man who had been following him a couple of nights ago. It took Steve a moment to recognize him, though, because the man was sharply dressed in a fancy suit unfit for a dog park, unlike the casual clothing Steve had seen him in before. Only when he noticed the sunglasses hanging from his collar, did Steve realize it was the same person.
Steve's orgasm washes over him, and he comes all over his belly with a loud, embarrassing high-pitched sigh. It’s blinding, white-hot pleasure that stops Steve from seeing or hearing anything for a moment, and then he sinks down, boneless, into the mattress, Tony’s thrusts growing shorter and more urgent.
And then Mr. Clean turned out to be named Drax, and he turned out to understand everything in the most literal way possible, and, well, before Tony knew it, as far as the galaxy was concerned, he and Steve were married. Twice over.
Tony’s heart feels so swollen it’s going to sink down on his chest, and he’s really in overwhelming levels of love with this man, because even the image of him strongly concentrating on getting the kids’ dishes clean so they can eat their next meals is enough to make him feel like swooning. He runs his hands up and down Steve’s biceps.
“Okay,” Steve says, after a moment of hesitation. He walks towards the bed and pulls the covers, clearing a spot for Tony.
“I’ve said my piece,” Tony interrupted, because, at the end of the day, it was true. He had. “I created the issue, I apologized, and I meant it. Not much more to do there, I’m afraid.” Steve’s gaze was impossible to read, so Tony turned away from his face, towards the elevator. “And now, I think we have bigger issues to focus on, if you don’t mind. You know, things like the victim of Midas who wants to get into your pants?”
intense and unforgiving as soon as he opens his eyes, a shock that makes him feel blind for a few seconds.
“Sorry,” Natasha says from the water, not sounding sorry at all. The children, all around her in their little floats, don’t bother with the courtesy.
Steve placed his hands in his pockets, stopping at a traffic light, knowing the man was likely to catch up to him. If it was a robbery, Steve at least could make sure the guy didn’t see where he lived. Besides, the street was empty, which meant no innocent passerby would be at risk in case of a confrontation.
Tony ignored him, pulling his phone from his pocket, pressing a few buttons on the screen. “I suppose it’s a regular back ache, so there’s really nothing to prescribe other than an analgesic. If you were going to stay like this in the long term, the obvious suggestion would be physical therapy, but by all accounts, you should be back to physical perfection soon, so it’s a little pointless.”
Tony walked towards the middle of the suite. A big couch sat at the center, in front of an empty wall where holograms of “
A few moments afterwards, he receives a lengthy message of Steve saying he just found the cat in the picture had died, but she had apparently lived a long and happy life and so he hoped Tony wouldn’t be sad by finding this out.
…” He waits, the line ringing on the other end, pacing, pressing the phone to his ear way too strongly. “Come on, pick up, pick up… God
Tony has many, many theories to explain Steve’s lack of physical affection in their relationship. Some of them make sense, others are just purely delirious. Over time, though, and with Jarvis’ help, he has managed to bring it down to three.
Tony’s hands were shaking. He couldn’t do this. It was—it was crazy, and stupid, and yet, he was going to do it, wasn’t he? He shut his eyes, remembered the weak, muffled sob he had heard a few moments before. God help him, he was going to do it.
Tony gives a short nod, but his eyes never waver. “Can’t dance,” he says, slowly. “I know.” Then, in a second, before Steve can even process it, his hand is at his neck, fingers touching the nape of his hair. “In that case,” Tony whispers, his voice a purr, tantalizing, his lips so close to Steve’s he can feel the brush of his warm breath. “Why don’t we do something else, hm?”
“Even if I—” Tony’s mouth snaps shut and his jaw clenches. He blinks incredibly fast, and in a second, he’s looking away, turning towards the table. “Okay.” He takes a deep breath, and Steve frowns, torn between worry and the clutching anxiety of somehow having said the wrong thing. “Okay, no dancing. Uh, I—I think I’m gonna get a drink, do you want any?”
Steve’s eyes went wide, and, for the first time, he felt nothing but sympathy for the man in front of him. “I’m sorry.”
Steve is sound asleep by now, so he probably doesn’t notice it, but it’s fine. Tony can tell him in the morning – and again later, in the future, as many times as Steve wants. Again and again.
There’s so much more Tony wants to ask. So much he wants to say, to throw on the table. In a way, he realizes, he wants to
Which leads him to the original question: Tony never, in a million years, thought Steve would want to date him. The entire thing felt surreal and dream-like, and, yeah, maybe he’s a little afraid of poking at it with extra demands. Any desire to bring the topic up easily turns to dust whenever Steve gives him one of his shy smiles and asks if Tony wants to go for a walk at the Brooklyn bridge next morning. The answer is always yes, and, honestly? Tony feels pretty lucky already.
“Sorry,” he grunts, even though, if he’s honest, he’s not sorry at all, and especially not when Tony shrugs the shirt off, letting Steve see his dusky nipples; his lean, compact shape; and the small, glowing triangle at the center of his chest, radiating blue light that colors the bronze skin around it.
“You know that’s not what I mean,” Rhodey replies. He runs a hand over his face, pinches the bridge of his nose. “Tony, maybe you’re not the best person to handle this.”
He shifts on the bed without thinking, his discomfort too much to bear, and of course Tony notices, his eyes snapping to him.
Steve rests his cheek against Tony’s warm skin, his face tinged by the blue glow of the reactor, and he wishes they could touch like this, outside of the bedroom. He wishes and wishes and wishes – as Tony drifts off to sleep, Steve, who hasn’t had a sip of alcohol, feels drunk on him and wishes he never had to sober up.
But opportunities such as this, Howard knows, are rarely offered without caveats. And the main thing that’s unsettling him, right now, is that, although he can see how accepting Rogers’ offer could benefit them, he has a hard time figuring out what’s in it for Rogers himself.
“Hold on,” Tony whispers. “Hold on, I’m not done yet. You dreamed up this world where things had to be different for us to be together, but see, you were wrong about something, as you often are: I love you. In that messy, fucked up world we’ve got, I already love you.”
“Hey, you,” Steve says, and—He’s not talking to him, Tony thinks. He—he must be talking to Barnes. Steve would never look at him like that.
“I’m thinking of injecting some of the armor’s nanites into him,” Tony says, pretending to not hear Rhodey’s clear concern. “Bruce is coming over tomorrow, he’s gonna make an estimate of possible side effects, and then we—”
Tony’s hand flew to his mouth to stop himself from cursing as the sharp pain climbed from his foot to his ankle. It was too late, though, and he saw how Steve’s back stilled immediately.
He rolls away, and Steve has to fight back a whine at the cold that hits his body at the absence of Tony over him. It last barely a moment, though, because in one second Tony’s back, his muscular thighs evident as he kneels in front of Steve.
He cursed, fist pushing back to slam against the door in a way he would never admit how painful it felt.
all over again – the pain, the fear, the excruciating heat – and although his eyes were open, it was as if his body hadn’t fully emerged yet, as if it was permanently trapped in the dream.
“You’re sensitive,” Stark declares when they break apart. Steve can’t bring himself to respond, because Tony’s mouth finds a spot right below his jaw that makes Steve let out an embarrassing noise.
It was such a jarring sight, compared to Steve’s dirty, old futon, that his stomach twisted. Everything about the bed was decadent and so unlike himself that he couldn’t help but think
A few, fine strands of light escape through the curtains, letting Tony know it’s probably too-fucking-early o’clock. Steve is standing up, right next to the bed, and even in the dark Tony can see he’s wearing a t-shirt, which, no. He shouldn’t be wearing clothes. Who let him put on clothes?
just… But it all fades right after the victorious fight against Thanos, their bodies both reeling with adrenaline, and Tony unable to think of anything that isn’t
“Goodnight,” Stark whispered, and his voice—it curled up around Steve like a rope, and he felt himself turning, wanting to come closer and yet frozen in place.
They fuck. Of course they do. It takes, what—just one battle for them to fall back in bed together again.
“Yeah,” he says, his voice so faint he barely recognizes it. “Yeah, I—I did. Even. Even earlier, I did.”
It’s such a strange feeling, having time as an ally rather than a curse, but Steve comes to accept it, gets used to it. He talks to Tony a lot, loving listening to his voice, loving making him laugh, loving even arguing with him when they inevitably do. He loves Tony’s skin and his armor, but above all he loves the spot where they meet, where one ends and the other begins. That place inside Tony that’s so bright Steve thinks he may go blind and not miss being able to see.
, turned to look at him, and his face was pained and frustrated. His features were reddened by a heavy flush, the type you get after some heavy exercise, and he was beautiful, because he was Steve. “Just—just let it go, Tony, okay? It’s pointless. Just forget it.”
Stark shoots him an annoyed look, and Steve probably interrupts a sharp reply when he asks, “Do you and… you know, the, uh, the other me. Have you two ever done this?”
Steve let himself be carried, throwing his head back, watching things moving past them. Lots of people awwww’ed at them on the way, and Tony played the part of a grumpy owner, refusing to stop for anyone who wanted to pet his cute new Corgi.
“You don’t carry dogs into the rain. His fur will get wet and he might catch a cold,” Steve said. The Pomeranian, however, was strangely dry, his fur sticking out from the papoose in a cute way.
“This isn’t funny,” he said, snapping his arm away from Stark’s hold. “Look, I won’t pretend to know what your deal is, but I’ve had enough. Maybe the tabloids think it’s funny for you to act crazy to get out of trouble, but I—”
“Not a habit,” Tony replied. He was feeling similarly breathless, as if the blue of Steve’s eyes was stealing the air right out of his lungs. “But it could turn into one. If, you know. If it sounds like. A good idea.”
He ends up by the desserts table, which is not a bad place to be. He entertains himself with chocolate truffles as he watches the dance floor fill with people. Wanda and Vision spin together as if oblivious to the music; Rhodey and Carol are laughing and having a contest of steps; and Natasha goes by many partners, always swift and graceful. Steve distracts himself a little, watching her. Her movements carry an incredible preciseness he usually only sees when they spar together. She dances with Thor for a while, but his moves seem to be a little too exuberant for her; Bruce steps in, but he’s too tipsy to keep up; and then, finally, Tony appears by her side and enlaces her waist, getting a smirk in response as they quickly fall into a synchronized movement.
“For everything. For leaving. For… for not being honest with you.” Steve shifts. His face heats. This isn’t easy, even now that he knows Tony’s feelings. He isn’t sure it will ever be. He just knows he desperately wants to do it anyway. “I thought… I never thought you’d want anything more, and, even if you did, you… You could do so much better than me.”
Busy holding a baby, Tony considers ignoring it, because Steve had been so nervous and excited to come along with him for the first time to the Smithe Home for Children. It’s fair to allow him some alone time with the kids. From the time Tony has spent with them (almost three months, regularly, now), he has gathered that they can be very fun little monsters, and he wants Steve to get the full, surreal experience of trying to tell a coherent story to a group of five-year-olds.
“This has nothing to do with history class, and everything to do with the fact that people are people, regardless of the time period.” Rhodey pulls the linen to his side, taking the thread out of Tony’s hand. “And also, if there was one thing the Allied forces didn’t care about, was waiting until marriage to get laid.
Steve moans against Tony’s cock, and Tony’s hand goes to Steve’s hair as he jolts, his hips arching forward. Steve looks up – he loves the sight of Tony like this, breathless and flushed, his tanned skin glimmering with sweat, brown eyes half-lidded as he looks down.
He may as well think aloud, because Rogers seems to fully understand what he means. “I could provide for him,” he says, a pleading note in his voice. Howard tries to detect a performance in his expression, but can’t. He desperately wishes for wine. “After—After we…”
did a number on me last night,” he scrapes his teeth over Steve’s throat, looking up just to see his cheeks darkening even more. “Almost rode the life out of me, in fact.”
“Hmmm,” Tony hums, pulling away with a broad smile. “I was hoping I’d get to see that.” His hand climbs up Steve’s thigh as he speaks, settling on the curve of his ass. “This laugh of yours—I swear it must have healing properties.”
the reactor. He loves the faint blue glow that comes from it, loves the fact that Tony’s heart is so huge and so bright it needs to be plastered on his chest for the entire world to see.
“I will see him tomorrow,” Howard declares, half-distracted by the wine goblet and the way its gold reflects the lights of the chandelier. “Send word for him to meet me after dinner.”
But he wants. He wants Tony, and he wants Tony so much it hurts, as if the intensity could burn a hole in his chest. And he wants all of this – the burn, the nerves, the fears. And if Tony wants it too, if Tony wants him
everything changes, pleasure building inside Steve at every flicker of Tony’s wrist, and his body starts bucking back, wanting to sink further onto Tony’s fingers.
Steve can just stare, wordlessly, as Tony goes on. He seems to notice Steve’s expression, though, because he takes a sharp breath, visibly trying to reign himself in.
“—Stark,” Tony heard, his head spinning as it did when he woke up too suddenly after a vivid dream. “Captain Rogers, Mr. Stark!” The voice called again, growing more frustrated.
Tony kind of wished that would have happened. And yes, of course, it would have killed them both, but—maybe, in the long run, that would still have been better than what did, in fact, happen.
Tony watched him warily, and then his face softened, though he still looked a little pained. “Yeah, I imagined that.” His eyes studied Steve, who crossed his arms in reflex. “How are you holding up?”
The wedding is unlike anything Steve’s ever seen. Neither of them are wearing bridal gowns. Valkyrie is in armor, and Carol has on a fitted, red suit Steve suspects might have been Tony’s suggestion. It’s less of a ceremony and more of an incredibly cheerful party in the Asgardian ship, orbiting around Earth. Booze is passed around everywhere, and although there are no waiters, there’s a huge table with food that never seems to run out.
“Relax.” He spread some more oil over Steve’s lower back. “He’s the healthcare professional, I get it.” Steve almost opened his mouth to say that clearly, he didn’t, when Tony’s thumbs pressed on his lower muscles and he inhaled sharply instead. “But I’m not so bad, see?”
“Right,” Tony’s response is a little strange, almost robotic. Steve wonders if there’s something he’s missing, some crucial component of one night stand etiquette he just isn’t aware of. “I suppose you’re not hungry either, are you?”
“Yeah, yeah, fine, you’re adorable,” Tony said, raising his arms in defeat. “Though, to be honest, you’re always adorable, it’s just that now you’re consciously using it to your advantage. That spell turned you into an evil, manipulative fur ball.”
“Oh, yes.” Howard grins and snaps his fingers. “Of course. How could I not remember a kid who once worked on the stables ages ago? I obviously have nothing better to think about.”
Steve’s heart pounds in his chest. His hands close into fists at his sides. Being left alone with Tony is a painful reminder of all the other times they were alone, and of how those times won’t come back.
as if he was a baby. “Well, maybe Anthony, but he coughs up fur balls – he’s hardly in a place to judge.” He paused, then added, his voice much softer, “I wouldn’t tell anyone. But, of course, it’s just an idea – only if you want to.”
Stark’s mouth curled as if he was fighting back a smile. His eyes sparkled with something Steve didn’t understand, and he continued caressing Steve’s hair, his hand descending down the side of Steve’s face to tuck a strand of it behind his ear.
The loud roar of thunder made Steve’s stomach sink. He was now two streets away from the park, and he could easily get home without getting caught in the rain, but what about the dog? Could he have found shelter somewhere? Or would he be walking alone and terrified as the water drenched his fur?
“Fine,” Howard acquises, his head already beginning to ache. He places a hand on his temple, rests his elbow on the chair’s arm. “I’m giving you this, because—because deep down, I know how it goes. And you know, too.”
“Oh, yeah,” Steve says, a hesitant smile already blooming on his face. He turns further to show his phone exclusively to Tony, signaling for him to lean further so their heads are closer, which isn’t a configuration Tony minds, at all. “See, it’s very simple – they post a picture, and give it a rate. At first, I thought it seemed a little harsh, because, really, which dog should ever get a low rate, right? But, see—all their rates start out at ten.”
He dreams of Steve. That’s not new – he’s been dreaming of Steve since he fell from a wormhole and woke up blinded by a smile and blue eyes looking at him as if he was worth looking at – but this time it’s different. Tony won’t be able to remember exactly what was the dream when he wakes up, but he will remember the franticness of it, the desperation – as if something terrible is about to happen, as if they’re running out of
and suddenly Tony hadn’t cared exactly what was he saying, as long as he could make him stop somehow.
So when Steve asks if he’s free tomorrow night, Tony really, really wants to kiss him. He doesn’t, though, instead tilting his head to the side in a way he knows is charming (hey, he’s allowed to employ some of his moves) and saying, “Always, Cap.”
“Yeah?” Tony says, and maybe it’s because he’s so close, but his eyes– they are incredibly bright, light brown turning slightly honeyed on the edge of his pupils. It’s Steve’s turn to swallow. “So, uh, so you think maybe, you could, possibly, maybe, want—I mean—would you…?”
Howard finishes pouring wine onto his goblet when he turns to look at Tony. He is dressed properly in a dark red garment, his hair brushed back in a way Howard is certain was Jarvis’ doing.
The memory sent a shiver down his spine. Not wanting Stark to notice he was distraught, he turned quickly to the couch, hurrying to lie down.
Steve’s chest tightened as he took the way to get back home. He could only pray the dog was alright at this point, and, though he knew there wasn’t anything more he could do, he still felt sad and anxious, desperately wishing he could still help in some way.
him there. Stark’s behavior was abhorrent, but nobody deserved that, or at least Steve thought so - and so he had allowed Stark to sleep on his couch a few times, and dragged him back to his own apartment when he couldn’t do it on his own. Holding Stark’s head when he was throwing up his guts in the toilet was far from Steve’s idea of a pleasant evening, but, well, someone had to do it. And it wasn’t as if he had anything better to do, anyway.
—” He thrusts forward, hands going to Steve’s ass and tightening it around his dick, and Steve has no idea what he’s saying, no idea what sounds are coming of his mouth, except that they all mean
seductive look he ever gave anyone, because this moment needs to be straight from the hall of fame of Tony Stark’s moves – and, well, Steve set it up for him so perfectly: “Well, fortunately, you don’t ever have to find—"
“Steve?” Stark called, and it vaguely occurred to Steve it was probably not the first time he'd done that. “Darling,
Tony thinks. And it’s true, but it doesn’t change the hurricane of feelings messing up his head. It’s as if the knife was replaced by a thousand small, sharp needles—the pain follows no straight line, twisting and curling in on itself, impossible to distinguish where it starts and where it ends.
be. It’s too fickle: they can spend months without touching each other and then fall into bed at the drop of a hat, for unspecified reasons – a look, a flush, a little quirk of Steve’s mouth that’s just impossible to ignore.
be heading out – it was only his unusually messy hair that convinced Steve that the man had probably been sleeping.
The wedding picture makes him feel antsy, too anxious for Steve to get back, so he focuses on the other one, the tourist picture. It’s so damn cheesy, they look ridiculous. But now Tony isn’t thinking about the disgustingly couple-y vibes that the picture emanates.
“Would it kill you to take this seriously?” He bristled, his voice betraying just a tinge of controlled anger.
don’t,” Tony whispers in Steve’s ear, and he knows he’s playing dirty with how syrupy his voice sounds, but hey, all is fair in love and war, and trying to get Steve to sleep in on a Saturday like a normal human being might take a lot of the first, but in practice it’s more like the second.
Howard’s feels his eyebrows hit his hairline. “Doesn’t this man have a war to fight?” he demands. “How much longer can he keep going through the city without alerting the king’s guards?”
Tony knows he should take the time before turning. He knows. But the thought of Steve Rogers, alive and awake, in front of him, is enough to make all rational thinking leave his head, and he turns immediately, like a planet chasing the Sun’s orbit.
“But it happens,” Tony helps. Then he opens a mischievous grin to the kids. “Lucky for you guys, that means
When he finishes, Tony’s eyes are closed, and, when Steve steps away to place the comb on a side table, Tony clumsily reaches out for him, shifting the duvet enough that his arm looks like a foreign object, raised awkwardly under the covers.
Steve feels his flush descending to his chest. “Thanks,” he says, because he doesn’t know what else to say.
“Shh,” he whispers, when Steve stutters that they should talk. They’re not good at talking, and right now, for their luck, they don’t
There must be something in Steve’s eyes, too – something more than what his words say, something brighter and warmer that’s almost blinding as he stares at Tony, something that makes Tony confident enough to lean forward and press a kiss on the top of Steve’s head.
There’s a moment of silence, where Tony can hear Steve finishing changing. Then he feels a light touch on his shoulder. He sits up quickly, almost as a reflex, but thankfully not shrugging Steve’s hand off. When he turns, Steve is wearing his workout clothes and staring at him with thoughtful eyes.
It all seems to happen at the same time: Tony’s grip on his hair strengthens and Stark’s finger starts teasing the rim of his hole. Steve gasps, and Tony takes advantage of the opening to pull Steve’s head forward, feeding his cock to him in one swift motion. Steve shuts his eyes, his lips stretching as he nearly chokes from the quick intrusion, but it’s good, to taste Tony on top of his tongue, to feel him pulsing against the inside of Steve’s mouth.
“Oh, please,” Ayesha said, with an eyeroll. “If even a glimpse of what you told me is true, Captain, it’s a wonder the two of you can even stand next to each other. And you want me to believe you’re married? Happily in love, after a fight that broke your entire team and made you spend—what, was it two or three years apart? I can’t recall.”
Steve’s smile grows. “I missed you, too,” he says. Then, he leans over the counter and takes Tony’s drink out of his hand. “But this was your last glass.”
Then Tony’s gaze lands on Steve, and, look—he can’t help it. Even after almost a year, he’s still not fully used to the idea that he gets to call this man his husband. Right now, positioned in the most uncomfortable way in a chair that’s about five sizes too small, holding a tiny children’s book in his hands and frowning as if trying very hard to convey all the nuances of the storytelling with his voice, Steve is just the most adorable thing Tony’s ever seen, beating even sweet Dorota, whose drool is still on Tony’s shirt.
(Sometimes, in the years they spent apart, Rhodey would ask about Steve. He wouldn’t say his name, though. He would just stop, take a sip of his drink, and lay his eyes on the side of Tony’s jacket where the inside pocket was, where he knew Tony carried the phone, even though Tony never told him.
“Oh.” Stark blinked. He looked a little flabbergasted, and then swallowed, shaking his head. “Okay. Okay, uh—come with me, then, darling.”
Tony eyes the mighty buttocks, because of course he does. They’re not Steve’s, but you have to work with what you got.
with Steve. Sure, in the past, people had flirted with him, sometimes, fascinated by the idea of seducing Captain America. It never amounted to anything, though, because Steve never knew how to take it further. His flirting skills were something the serum never managed to enhance. The closest he ever got to an actual fling had been with Sharon, when adrenaline and gratitude resulted in one kiss that never managed to evolve to anything meaningful, cut short by Steve’s time on the run. After that, obviously, dating was the furthest thing from his mind.
“True,” Steve said. He pinched the bridge of his nose, looking very, very tired. Tony wondered if this whole thing was at least one tenth as hard for Steve as it was for him, but he highly doubted it. “We’re lucky she just assumed we were going through a crisis.”
This gets him a half-laugh, Steve’s eyes sparkling with something resembling hope, and that’s it, Tony’s done. Even though both of them are a mess of tears and snot, he presses his mouth against Steve’s in the sloppiest, saltiest kiss of all time, probably, but it doesn’t matter because it’s Steve mouth and it feels so good. Tony doesn’t care—he’d kiss Steve everywhere, anytime, and now that he can do exactly that, it’s not gonna be some gross bodily fluids that are gonna stop him.
So there he was, walking outside of an alien spaceship, to meet a new race of beings, find new technology, and get to know an entire new planet and culture – all while having to be Steve Rogers’ pretend husband.
He and Tony hadn’t seen each other, after Steve left the room in Wakanda. They had, however, talked more than they used to. Tony texted him, just a week afterwards, a picture of a cat wearing a Captain America-themed costume. Steve had been weirded out, because he was certain he hadn’t licensed anything of the sort – he told that to Tony, who asked,
Stark follows him, and Steve sees stars as they both fall in sync, each pushing even deeper inside him. He clenches on Stark’s cock and hears him make a strangled noise. Stark’s torso goes down, over him, and his hands find the mattress at Steve’s sides. His movement never slows, though, growing even faster as he lets out an endless flow of praise that Tony quickly joins in, saying Steve feels good, so perfect, so
Steve finds out how Tony hugs, how he kisses, how he makes love. He finds out how Tony blinks himself awake in the morning, how he likes his cereal, how he shivers and sweats in the middle of a nightmare. He finds out how Tony dresses himself, how he showers, how he stumbles in bed after a long stretch of work. He finds out how Tony’s hands touch, how his eyelashes flutter at every sunrise, how he hums when he kisses.
Steve raises his eyebrows. The question is odd, but, like with everything related to Tony, he doesn’t understand it enough to pinpoint why. He’s a little overwhelmed by being the focus of Tony’s attention so abruptly after months of distance, as if he’s been ambushed by a miniature hurricane, but he desperately wants it to last. He searches for words, but finds none—he can’t figure out anything he can say to make Tony stay closer for longer.
Stark is clearly not one to back away from a challenge. “That’s kind of you to offer, darling.” He lets go of the buttons and opens his arms in a clear invitation.
The kids still have a lot of questions, but Tony lets them talk, taking advantage of their agitation to wink at Steve, who raises himself from the tiny chair and passes him the book.
,” he says when Steve takes one of them in his mouth, his tongue circling over it like a piece of candy. “Damn it, he’s right. You’re an absolute menace, it never fails to amaze me.”
Tony wants to hate him. He really, really does. Bizarrely, though, he finds that it’s harder to hate Barnes when he’s not thinking about things other than Barnes’ own fucked up existence. It’s easier to hate Barnes more as an afterthought than as the sole focus.
When he finishes picking the room and the bathroom apart, Tony sits on the bed, trying to get his thoughts in order.
“Are planning to smother me with covers?” Steve ignores him, having a little difficulty opening up the duvet – it’s a little overwhelming to hold. “Is that what we’re doing?”
“I’ll take your word for it.” Sam chuckled and shook his head. “I can’t believe I actually thought you meant it when you said Anakin would be the last one.”
Seeing Steve’s efforts, though, the children’s open disinterest stings a little – Tony wants to tell them all to stop being spoiled brats and give some appreciation to this man who’s trying so hard and just looks so cute in the child-sized chair. He wants to tell them that, by getting Steve Rogers’ attention, they’ve already peaked in life at five-years-old, so they might as well enjoy it.
,” he purrs, and Steve swallows hard, raising his hips more. Stark laughs, palming his ass. “So eager, darling.” He drags his fingers over Steve’s buttock, finding the band of his underwear and pulling it.
“That is my gift to you,” Howard continues. “Even if it takes years and I’m not here anymore to see it, when he leaves, when nothing you have is enough to make him stay, you will remember this talk, and you will be ready.”
“I was going to,” Stark’s voice sounded a little strident, and he spoke so fast it was hard to make out what he was really saying. “I really was, because again, I didn’t think it was true—didn’t
Steve’s hand goes down, blindly finding the band of Stark’s underwear, his back pressed to Stark’s chest. Steve pulls it, causing a light snap, and Stark gasps against his mouth.
“I know,” Clint says bluntly. “It’s Dog Rates, Cap. They have over eight million followers. It’s a huge account. Everyone knows it.”
Tony inhales deeply. There’s a spark of guilt in his stomach. Asking Steve questions is one thing, but this feels like deliberately snooping inside his mind, digging into memories and feelings Tony has no right to know.
He looked at the two quiet servants for a second, unsure if he was meant to help himself, but since they didn’t move, he decided to go ahead.
The dog raised his head slowly, seeming hesitant. Then, a moment afterwards, his demeanor instantly changed. His tail raised and waved, happily, and he came closer, allowing Steve to pet his nose.
They spend a while kissing, Tony’s hands everywhere on Steve’s body, over his clothes. Some of the touches don’t even feel sexual, as if Tony is just feeling his shape, his lines. Steve takes advantage of the moment to do the same, running his hands over Tony’s lean muscles, wishing he could memorize the feel of every inch of skin.
“No,” Tony answers, entirely too fast, from the look on Steve’s face. “I just need to… clear my thoughts a little.” It’s not even a lie, but Steve’s blue eyes find his and Tony feels strangely guilty anyway.
It’s probably a testament to how right Rhodey is that Tony doesn’t even dispute that. He looks away, his stomach churning.
He spends the rest of the afternoon using dream FRIDAY. He has to give it to Stone Industries: it’s truly amazing tech, keeping an entire universe alive in Steve’s head. He tries to catch up on details of the fantasy he may need in order to talk to Steve without getting caught blindsided. Aside from their marriage (which, apparently, was a very discreet ceremony that wasn’t covered by the media, but Tony refuses to look for photos or videos, for his own sanity), everything seems to be… very normal. The Avengers are all the same, all residing in the Compound. Barnes, Tony is relieved to find out, is not part of the team, but apparently, he visits regularly.
slow. Steve loses track of his mouth, of what he says. He loses track of the words Tony whispers into his neck, of the endless flow of curses and praise.
“I had a fiancé,” he said. Why he was telling Stark all this, he didn’t know. But Stark didn’t seem to mind, nodding without any confusion, as if Steve’s words were making perfect sense. “She didn’t—”
He picked up his phone from his pocket, intending to text Bruce to ask how much more would the spell last, when Steve started nuzzling his leg with his nose.
The main problem with this theory is that… well, after almost three months of completely chaste dates, Tony isn’t sure what
His heart seems to stretch to include every moment, every nanosecond, becoming bigger than Steve ever thought it could be.
All things considered, there are two courses of action available: what he needs to do and what he wants to do. Deep down, Tony is aware that the two of them don’t intersect, not really, but Tony’s ability to figure out the best possible plan for any given problem is only matched by his ability to stick his fingers in his ears and go
“Here.” He leans forward and motions for Steve to raise his hips, propping a pillow under him. Steve’s heart pounds heavily on his chest as Tony comes closer.
them at a private dinner everyone else saw her take them to, right? It would be monumentally stupid of her. There were other ways to get rid of them while raising less suspicion, if that was what she wanted to do. And why the hell would she want to do that, anyway? Just because Steve didn’t let her get into his pants?
“Yeah, I got that.” Tony shifts, uncomfortable, his hands flying to his pockets. “Mind you, did you think candle lit dinners are just a regular thing men do nowadays in platonic friendships? Because that might explain why you’re having a hard time finding gym buddies.”
“Yeah,” Tony says frantically, even though his voice shakes, and his face is so warm, and fuck, he’s sweating. Steve is now holding his sweaty hand. “I’m just. I.” He bites the inside of his cheek so hard it nearly draws blood, trying to make his next move careful, but it works as well as it can be expected. “I’m not wearing mine.”
On the weekends, after their first walk of the day, Steve would leave the three of them at Sam and Bucky’s apartment and head down to the shelter where he'd had Monet checked for a chip and now volunteered.
Stark laughs, humorless. “No. No, we aren’t. I…” He takes a long breath. “I don’t think this would be something he would want.”
“I didn’t see you during the ceremony,” he says, not so subtly changing the subject. From the way Tony’s eyes dart to his face, he definitely notices, but, thankfully, he doesn’t push it.
He learned that from Maria. She spoiled Tony a lot, when she thought that would awaken some feeling of motherhood inside her. She would give him all the sweets and toys he asked, even as her gaze grew bitter at her newfound duties.
, he thinks. But infatuations are fleeting. A million years ago, Maria had been infatuated with him.
“…No,” Howard admits. “No, he isn’t. But it is what is expected of him. The Bains’ allegiance to this house has only grown more admirable as the years went by.”
Steve feels a knot in his throat. Last night had felt like a dream, but now reality is sinking in, and it’s nearly claustrophobic, having Tony so close and knowing he won’t be able to have him again. Memories of his actions flood his thoughts, and he feels himself blushing at the things he’d said, how transparent he was. Just the memory of the pleasure makes his skin prickle, hot at the thought of Tony over him, but...
“No, my lord,” Obadiah says. Howard barely resists the urge to roll his eyes. He spoils Tony too much, not nearly as much as Maria had, true, but... “Though I assume he must be waiting for a swift reply. We don’t know how long he can stay in the outskirts—"
Maria, Howard thinks, her name echoing in his head like a single note from an old, sad melody. When he’s alone and his tongue tastes wine, it’s easier to remember her. He remembers her laugh and inquiring, curious eyes; remembers how she had sat on his lap on their wedding night, and how she’d recoil in bed years later whenever Howard slumped down to fall into a drunken slumber, very careful to not even risk touching him.
He looks around, vaguely acknowledging Natasha’s presence along with many panels showing a flood of data. His gaze darts around the room, and he stops in his tracks when he finds what he’s looking for.
imagining Steve hooking up with Ayesha, which didn’t help at all. “Okay. Maybe we should play along with her? Like, lean into this angle of a just-for-appearances couple? I suppose it doesn’t really count as lying if they think we’re just lying to ourselves.”
“Hey,” Steve whispers, light in a way that lets Tony know he’s definitely smiling, and a part of Tony wants to cry. He wants to cry, because the most fucked up part of everything is that it feels so
Tony probably shouldn’t be annoyed about it, because Steve is always so careful to not wake him up, but he is.
Music plays loudly, but Steve doesn’t even recognize the language the song is being sung in. He’s near a window, hearing battle stories from Thor and Sif, when a fight breaks out in the opposite corner of the room and both of them have to go break two drunk Asgardians apart.
Steve’s eyes find his, though, and whatever he sees seems to reassure him enough, because the room around them starts going back in focus, taking shape and going back to look like the real world.
“You’re killing me here,” Tony breathes, his hand running through Steve’s hair. “Shit, you’re beautiful. I know if me and him keep echoing each other it will start to get creepy, but—” Stark laughs, and Tony’s mouth twists in a grin. “It’s the truth.”
“Seriously?” Sam had asked, sitting on Steve’s couch and petting Anakin’s belly with his feet. Despite his mocking tone, he had Monet on his lap, and was now scratching a spot behind his left ear. “What about this little dude gives you ‘dead French guy obsessed with landscapes’ vibes?”
Tony has the feeling that he’s gonna love cleaning poop and having to entertain overly excited drooling dogs as much as Steve loved trying to perform for a bunch of five-year-olds, but, hey. There’s no harm in trying, especially if it makes Steve smile like that.
“I wouldn’t want to overstay my welcome.” Then he gazes over at Tony, and there it is, that same sadness. “Sometimes three is fun—other times, it’s a crowd.”
“Wow. Is this where you tell me you are quitting the Air Force to pursue your true passion as a historian of sexual customs?”
He says Tony unlike any other word he’s said until this point. A softness slips through every letter, a touch of wonder in both syllables. For one second, the name of Howard’s son sounds foreign to his own ears.
God, was he tired. He worked a double shift at the store during the day, which was already mentally exhausting without taking into account that he had insisted on helping a few customers to the car with their bags, which had been a strain in his back. It was almost like a betrayal, that a bad dream had caught up to him in a night where he should’ve slept like a baby from sheer exhaustion, and now Steve yearned to get back to his bed and continue where the nightmare forced him to leave off.
Tony opens his mouth to reply with what is hopefully a collection of very creative ideas that are also nearby and accessible at this very instant, but he’s interrupted by the full smash of a beach ball right on his face, so strong it nearly knocks him to the ground.
Steve thought. Tony hadn’t seen the weird curve of his back, how one of his shoulders was slightly more elevated than the other one, or how his spine stuck out against his skin, as if he was going to break with a single touch. He hadn’t seen any of it.
Steve takes a sharp breath. It shouldn’t feel big, to do something like this, but... it does. It feels as important as the times Steve has faced threats against the world, and even a little scarier.
But this one, it’s not—it’s not quite a dream, it’s a memory. It’s a memory clear as crystal, clear as the ideas that used to spring into his head endlessly every single day.
“Hey,” Tony says, soft and friendly, and his voice is like a warm blanket. Steve wants to curl up in it, to curl up on him and never let him go. He stares at the ceiling instead. “Slept well?”
lately?” Steve opened his mouth to reply sharply, but Stark raised a finger at him. “I get that you’re not a fan, but a few things happened early this year that even you must have heard of.”
The first one shows him and Steve in suits. Tony doesn’t recognize the one he’s wearing, so he suspects it was probably custom made for the occasion; Steve’s is a dark blue, perfectly fitted. In the picture, Steve is grinning wide. He has his arms wrapped around Tony’s waist and a dot of white foam on his nose, which Tony can guess is cake frosting, because it’s all over his own face in the picture, too. He’s also laughing, hands on Steve’s shoulders and head thrown slightly back, eyes shut. Steve’s gaze is on him entirely. Neither of them is looking at the camera.
, Rocket had said, nonchalant, after sharing the story of the one time their people deployed an entire fleet because of stolen batteries.
, and they enjoy his performance of the story, especially the high-pitched noise he makes for the chicken’s lines.
Rhodey doesn’t take the bait of his childish answer, instead coming closer to also watch Steve’s vitals, looking over Tony’s shoulder.
Tony had thought about it (by God, had he thought about it) but anytime he thought he could take the initiative, something on Steve’s demeanor would seem to stiff, too skittish, and then it wouldn’t seem like a very good idea.
“And you still haven’t seen anything yet,” Tony continues, his hands going slowly to Steve’s hips, sliding over to his ass. “When he’s on his knees—let me tell you,” he gropes Steve’s buttocks firmly, spreading them a little, “he’s pretty
yet,” Tony says, his mouth moving against the sensitive skin, playing with the bruise he’s just made.
It didn’t make any sense. Steve was being overly paranoid. Tony tried to use any previously unknown telepathy powers he had to tell him that, but Steve just kept staring when they were startled by the sound of Ayesha chewing.
Steve took a breath. He actually did it, as if Tony’s words were hurting him deeply, and, oh, God. “Okay. You don’t need to forget it if you can’t, but, Tony, just for the next few days, pretend it’s not a problem, okay? Later, I—I will stay out of your way, I promise. But just now, while we still need to keep the lie going, let’s just—”
to have Steve holding him, his solid and warm presence more comforting and wonderful than anything Tony’s ever felt. His body relaxes against his better judgement, melting against Steve’s in a way that draws an unexpected sigh out of Tony’s lips.
The topic of sexuality comes up right after a mission, of all times. They’re both already in their casual clothes, most of the debriefing hell thankfully already handled (except for the report that, of course, Steve will submit later).
By the time they got home, though, Tony’s anxiety had resurfaced again. Even as he grinned at Steve and continued to talk normally, his hands twitched hopelessly in the pockets of his jacket. He wondered if Steve’s occasional lingering gaze was enough of a hint of what his reaction would be if Tony tried to close the evening with a goodnight kiss.
